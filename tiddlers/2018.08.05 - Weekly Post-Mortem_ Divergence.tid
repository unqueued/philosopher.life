---

* We ended up going in a radical direction on schoolwork. I'm glad
* I did make progress on IJ and Lost in the Cosmos
* I am not going to contact [[R]] right now, but I may visit her instead.
* I finished {[[Help]]}, and I am working towards [[FTO]], including Stephen Dougherty.
* Didn't do much DND stuff.
* I was wrong about the technical hiatus to some extent. I am glad that it continues to develop, but not at a breakneck speed, I suppose.
* This is an unexpected set of responses. I don't know what happened, but this week is much better that I'd have expected given the level of divergence.
