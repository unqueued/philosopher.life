title: 2007.07.05 - Family-Guy-Esque Life Update

As usual, a fairly interesting week or two. Beware a post with no transitions. I’m just regurgitating thoughts…it may go on “family guy tangents”…

j3d1h has had an odd diaper rash for a week (she very, very rarely has a diaper rash). We are good about cleaning her (k0sh3k especially), but this diaper rash was very weird. It was a bit all over, but it was heaviest on her lower back…weird. So, we tried different rash-creams, and nothing worked. It would look like it was getting better, and then all of the sudden, it would get worse. k0sh3k took her to the doctor (regular checkup) and we found out that j3d1h has eczema.

Ironically, diaper rash ointments tend to remove and eliminate moisture, which only makes eczema worse. We have a special eczema cream, and I’m sure we’ll be careful to make sure it doesn’t get any worse.

Switching topics…

I also wrote something interesting:

———————————

The Equal Pay Act amended the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1963; it provides that where workers perform equal work in jobs requiring “equal skill, effort, and responsibility and performed under similar working conditions,” they should be provided equal pay.

Essentially, the law also reads:

If an employer asks me to perform an unequal amount of work, then I should get a proportionately unequal amount of compensation. If I am asked to perform using a higher amount of skill, responsibility, and comparative effort than others around me, then I should be provided higher pay.

Expecting more work from an individual, but not paying for it is a form of discrimination. Munesh, and by proxy his supervisor(s), discriminates against me.

The degree of satisfactory work (quota) is clearly defined per task. Take for example Outbound calls which require 8.6 per hour (adjusted to show the actual quota) equates to 65 calls expected in a 7.5 Hour period of production (breaks and lunch do not comprise productive time). To meet expectations requires 65 call in a work day.

Munesh has directly told me he will raise my ‘individual quota’ above everyone else’s quota to 75 per day (as opposed to my co-workers’ 65 calls per day). He has explicity stated several times over the year that those who do not meet their quota will be endangering their employment and future written references. According to Munesh, by not meeting 75 calls per day, I risk termination of my employment and a poor reference letter. I make the same wages as my fellow employees. Why should I be required to perform tasks of higher skill and effort without being paid for them?

Munesh requires that I perform 8.7 hours of work for only 7.5 hours of compensation while my co-workers are only required to perform 7.5 hours of work to receive 7.5 hours of compensation. This is discrimination.

There are two solutions:

If the quota were universally changed so that everyone was required to work 75 calls per day, then I would not feel discriminated against.

If I were paid for 8.7 hours of work instead of 7.5 hours of work, then I would not feel discriminated against.

——————————

I have no idea how it will work out. I know that I can’t goto my supervisor, or his supervisor, or even her supervisor about this issue. I’ll either goto HR or the VP (he is a good guy, and I’ve seen him “weigh-in” before on behalf of small folks like me in regards to similar issues) for advice about it.

For now, I am working to find a new job entirely. I’ve applied to many jobs just within Humana (and I’m applying outside as well). I need 30k + benefits a year for our family to do this with breathing room (kids aren’t cheap).

Moving on (no transitions for you…):

I got a jump-drive with 2GB on it for 15$ (that is a steal!). It is a very neat device, and I’m sure, it will be archaic within a year. 2GB is still a good deal of info. The 5GB will be what matters, as it will catch up to one-time media storage like DVD-R’s.

Speaking of Gift-ish buyable things:

k0sh3k and I have decided to work together on our birthday gifts. We are getting teh gr8 bukz (I have to teach mom some l337 speak while I can). I think this will be a wise choice for our childrens’ education. No matter where we are, we have the heart of Western thought summarized for us…and it will be important for our children to be educated in such things.

Speaking of which, I don’t exactly know how we will go about teaching our kids (I’m honestly not a good teacher…but k0sh3k is awesome). Reading and math are everything. I look at all other topics as advancements to these fundamental topics…these are the modes or languages of all other scholastic pursuits. Obviously, I wish to concentrate on the modes first. I suppose I will need to add logic and music to the list of modes as well. Hrmm…but school requires more. Trades, travel, dealing with society, and other “extras” seem to be relevant experiences. How does one pack all that in? I honestly have no idea how I can give my kids better than what I had, lol.

One major issue is knowing the line at which I will force my children to do something and when I’ll just let them start and stop at whim. Learning about frogs is about them, reading certain types of fiction is just up to them…but, as we move closer and closer to the fundamental modes we begin to see more necessary bodies of knowledge. I don’t want to eliminate their interest in the necessities, I’d much rather they strive to learn and grow in those areas just from plain curiosity, ambition, and self-growth rather than just because I said to do it.

I suppose I look at everything we do as a parent as a form of education. We are conditioning our children (influencing, manipulating). Do I trust my gut/instinct? Should I? Definitely a difficult proposition..this “raising the kids” things appears to be a solid challenge. I am responsible for what they become (in part).

Of course, we all know all of this. We’ve known for a long time…it is just more relevant to me when I am in the midst of such decisions.

I’ll tell you one thing though: parents wing it. Straight up. No lies. At some point, no matter how prepared you are…you will wing it. We might say life is improvised…even though there is only one perfect script to follow.

oh snap….btw, to family members who read this:

The Tattoo-word is out. Grandpa and grandma know. They caught k0sh3k and I…they were fairly polite, we played ‘light-hearted’ defense fairly well. It was clear they believed us all to have them…they saw mom’s…LOL! Of course, Grandpa and grandma were not terribly happy about it.

I always wonder about the generational gaps (a fascinating concept to me). The ebb and flow of “memes” in generations, the biological differences, the change, and especially the similarities…these are important things to watch. what is the statistical relations between my parents and their parents? How will k0sh3k and I, and our bro’s+sis’s, be similar/different to our parents? How about our children? What aspects of these things are good, and what are bad? If good, what can we do to promote such things, and if bad, how do we eliminate the cycle? How should such evidence influence our perception of our grandparents, parents, selves, and children? But, be careful not to be wrapped up in identity…unless you identity is simply seeking God’s Will. And, insofar as this would be God’s will, you should purusue it. I think we can deduce several uniquely hard to understand elements of God’s Will for familial relations and so on from studying the generations.

Oh, they saw our tattoos at Ann’s July 4th party. I was surrounded by Old Southern Republicans…Always a long event. Morons. Anyways, the party was short for us (j3d1h needed a nap)…and we had a good visit. The house was clean (not for long I assume).

k0sh3k’s Morning sickness is an all day sickness, and it appears to be getting worse and worse. Thankfully she can take her Medicine to have fewer Migraines. Throwing up sucks still. I’m trying to keep her eating because if it gets even worse, then she might not be able to eat (or keep it down). I’m not worried at this point. But, I will keep watching.

I’ve begged people to post on the forum…I realize I need input. I need to formulate the picture, and the innovation might require some questions from outside sources.

We’ve been making awesome proxy cards. I clean cards off we acetone, erasers, and sandpaper. Dry em, print them, and dry them. Beautiful proxies. I can get cards that look identical…I could use them in tournaments…even sell them (which I won’t…obviously).
