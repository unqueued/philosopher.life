TUE 9:43 AM
Good morning. =)
TUE 9:53 AM
How's school going for ya?
TUE 9:53 AM
Not bad so far!
TUE 9:55 AM
What's your least favorite and favorite classes so far (I know it's early), and why?
TUE 9:56 AM
Also, do you know what you final semester is going to look like?
TUE 9:56 AM
Least favorite? Maybe American lit because it’s not as stimulating as the other classes. 

Favorite: I really like my theory class but I’ve been interested in mythology and native religion since I was a lad.... I can’t choose yet.
TUE 11:32 AM
All of the core classes are done. The rest are generic 400/500 ENG classes. I can pick whatever fulfills that requirement I think.
TUE 11:32 AM
IIRC
TUE 11:32 AM
Awesome.
TUE 11:32 AM
That is a good position to be in.
TUE 11:32 AM
I think so. :) id like to take one more creative writing class..... but we’ll see.
TUE 11:34 AM
I don't know what kinds of creative writing classes are available to you. Is there something in particular you would shoot for?
TUE 11:35 AM
What Lit genres are most lit?
TUE 11:36 AM
I don't know enough amount American Lit to say.
TUE 11:36 AM
about*
TUE 11:36 AM
They offered a 600 level fiction writing class this semester that I wanted badly but it didn’t fit in with my core classes. :’)
TUE 11:36 AM
:fire::fire::fire:
TUE 11:37 AM
hehe
TUE 11:37 AM
If they offer it again, I’ll snag it for sure.
TUE 11:40 AM
There’s also a novel writing class that went on last semester but it was online only.
TUE 11:41 AM
Hoping that comes back in a classroom setting.
TUE 11:41 AM
Yeah. You do any online classes?
TUE 11:41 AM
Unfortunately, I'm not self-motivated enough to make it work.
TUE 11:41 AM
They cost way too much at uofl for them to be worth it.
TUE 12:16 PM
Is there a difference between in-class and online pricing?
TUE 12:16 PM
Regular prices are included with tuition which is roughly 6000 a semester.
TUE 12:26 PM
An online class goes from 2000-5000 IN ADDITION TO tuition.
TUE 12:26 PM
What?
TUE 12:27 PM
Are you saying online classes are more expensive?
TUE 12:27 PM
Yes!
TUE 12:27 PM
...
TUE 12:27 PM
So you would pay the 6000 then whatever else the online is.
TUE 12:27 PM
It’s fucking stupid and evil.
TUE 12:28 PM
I do not understand this world.
TUE 12:28 PM
Obviously, they make more money doing this.
TUE 12:28 PM
I legit don't understand how.
TUE 12:28 PM
I went to ectc for a year and took all online classes.
TUE 12:28 PM
They were 200 each.
TUE 12:28 PM
And that made up my tuition....
TUE 12:29 PM
Reading about it.
TUE 12:30 PM
I think in time it will shift.
TUE 12:31 PM
UofL may still be paying initial startup costs, and I assume the marketing is expensive.
TUE 12:31 PM
Maybe.
TUE 12:32 PM
But still. It’s insanely expensive.
TUE 12:32 PM
They already don’t have room for students on campus.
