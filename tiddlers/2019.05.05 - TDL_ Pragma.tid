* Finish laundry.
* Work. 
** Keep your paperwork the same across the board now. Strike first.
** 24, Book, TT, and CI. Noice.
* She needs the VPN up. Too busy?
* Consider basket formation for laundry instead. I'd rather hunt.
** You can change the shelve sizing, after all.
* I want that nightly cache reset. FF is a huge fucking blob (as always, I find a way to turn it into a dumpster fire <3). 
** Interesting snafu on their certs. Was corrected mighty quickly too. Sounds like Defcon1. Glad they took it seriously because it raped me pretty hard.
