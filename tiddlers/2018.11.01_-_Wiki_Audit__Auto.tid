title: 2018.11.01 - Wiki Audit: Auto

I still am not happy with the [[Autogen]] approach. I want fine-grained, detailed control of where objects go, in what order, but I also want to click a button and everything goes to sane default locations. Have and eat it too.

Now that I'm going the tag based link list route, it's even easier to spin up a thousand tiddlers.

---

Added [[Monthly Auditable]] because I want a one-stop shop.

---

I switched naming on [[titletag]]s due to actual tag usage. I don't like that I've lost this complexity and naming, but I think it's the price I'm going to have to pay for now. =( Ugh. You know, if I find this wasn't worth it, I can always just delete the tags quite easily. I can always move back to doing it by hand. I will get used to my power tools.

Dream for [[Wiki Audit]]:

* A tool which highlights linkable words or phases in the body of a tiddler, click-activated for formatting as link.

[[2018.11.01 - Self-Dialectic: /b/ Contra]] demonstrates to me that I don't have an effective enough method for searching (unless I'm going to bruteforce) for a tiddler which speaks to the relationships between [[/b/]] and {[[About]]}. Basically, I think I may have asked some version of this before, but I don't know how to quickly find it. This is a serious kind of problem worth solving on this wiki. I need to become a fucking grandmaster of searching this thing (not just categorizing and linking it together). 

It needs to be more than "contains: [[/b/]] + {[[About]]}." That's way too fucking broad. They actually need to be in close proximity. The Context-based search is close to what I'm talking about here. This seems to be a generalized kind of query that I can improve upon and make as a consistently functioning tool, right?

---

I'm arguing with [[j3d1h]] about whether or not we should move to another kind of hosting here. Because we serve a single static index.html file, we really don't have to host it ourselves. The work seems largely irrelevant, and I'm not paying more than a buck a month for hosting this. We're going to try hosting it on https://m6ram.github.io.

It ended up being a lot easier than I thought it would be. Set ATL to https://live.philosopher.life. It appears the load times are significantly improved. 

[[m10: h0p3's crontab]] now set for [[wiki-live-git.sh]] minutely (no room to make mistakes now, lol). At this point, I have little reason not to include the signature within the wiki itself.

I can't say it's radically faster. I could setup Watch for faster realtime, but a minute is fine with me. 

It shaves off .5s for my desktop, and about 8s(!) for my phone. That's not nothing. There's still improvements that could be made, but not much more. I think the splash screen (https://tiddlywiki.com/prerelease/#Creating%20a%20splash%20screen) may actually work, but I don't understand if gzip really enables that. I'm going to find out, eh? =)...Currently 22MB down to 7.7MB. That's still ridiculously fucking big. ZSTD appears strictly better in my usecase, but I'm also not qualified to say that either. This

Now, I'm in charge of the backup, and someone else is in charge of the primary. That's fine with me, haha. 

The throughput difference is evident. And, the bandwidth limit is essentially limitless. It's free hosting that I can push a diff to minutely.

This little jig, `<<list-links "[tag[FoobarTag]prefix[2018.10]]">>` is all I need for [[Monthly Auditable]]. It does the trick. 

This is yet another strike against the need for hardcoding so much.

Drunken spree on ASCII and Unicode all up in this bitch. I adore the changes to $:/language/RecentChanges/DateFormat ROFL!
