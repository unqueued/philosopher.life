Been a week! I'm checking in: how are you doing?
SAT 7:15 PM
I talked to Matthew very briefly, but I uh am so socially awkward I didn't do a good job connecting. You think he would enjoy chatting with me (he might not have the time)?
SAT 7:15 PM
How's the router, btw?
SAT 7:16 PM
We are good just getting ready for Christmas. I’m sure he enjoyed chatting with you and probably felt the same :see_no_evil::slightly_smiling_face: he can have a hard time tell he gets to know ya well enough!! The router is awesome not one single problem so far:hand_with_index_and_middle_fingers_crossed:
SAT 7:23 PM
Awesome. I am glad it is kicking butt.
SAT 7:27 PM
What you guys doing for Xmas?
SAT 7:27 PM

Yup well since I work up until Christmas Day I have to do what I can
SAT 7:34 PM
Indeed.
SAT 7:34 PM
I hope you get paid well; you work a lot of hours.
SAT 7:34 PM
Inconvenient hours too.
SAT 7:34 PM
Yea I do but that absolutely about to change- I had to set some boundaries and she hired another full time person. I’m not saying I won’t work as much because we still have our business to run but I can’t be here 300 hrs in a month- no sir!

SAT 8:01 PM
As soon as we can I definitely will be sending you an invite
SAT 8:01 PM
You don't owe us anything! We are happy to have neighbors that give a shit at all. Lol. I have a hard time making friends with any of my neighbors these days (but, I may be doing it wrong).
SAT 8:02 PM
But, we would be happy to get together again, of course.
SAT 8:02 PM
No worries and no you aren’t doing it wrong people aren’t always personable sometimes- it has nothing to do with you! We enjoy you guys very much and trust me are by far perfect!
