* Disconfirm My Bias

*** I am glad to see people actually working on this. I am forced to admit that DARPA has generated very useful things.

* Think About It
** https://www.justsecurity.org/52346/age-unregulated-social-media/

*** I have yet to see significant software from China emerge, although it is clear they have taken some tools and improved/used them significantly better than anyone else. I do not see innovation come out of them, although I do see excellent manufacturing.
