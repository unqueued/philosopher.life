title: 2018.08.02 - Reddit: Clearcut

https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy+DepthHub+InconvenientDemocrats+LateStageCapitalism+LifeProTips+Marxism+PoliticalPhilosophy+QuotesPorn+TheoryOfReddit+TrueReddit+UnethicalLifeProTips+leftrationalism+lostgeneration+modded+philosophy+psychology+science+slatestarcodex+socialism+todayilearned/

Down to ~20. I dropped about 10 subs today. Some standardly conceived high signal-to-noise ratio subs got cut. 

I'm trying to slash through some of the philosophy subs. 

QuotesPorn and TIL are Titlesubs that are super awesome still. Psychology has a lot of garbage, but it's also non-trivially useful too. I'm trying to spend as little time on reddit as possible here while getting the most from it.

I can't cut the Reddit habit; it's simply too important to my hyperreading.
