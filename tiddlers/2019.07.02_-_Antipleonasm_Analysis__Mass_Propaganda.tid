title: 2019.07.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Mass Propaganda

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.

I appreciate the hypernormalization claim in Arendt's words. I think there are many kinds of predictions about the claim that every statement from those in power is a lie anyhow. From the beginning, it is clearly political theater. That comes in some wide ranges. Some consider it the only way to do business, others because desensitized and apathetic, etc. [[Memetic Warfare]] taken far enough demotivates people from even reaching for reality or owning their identities [[irwartfrr]] sufficient for even recognizing the warfare for what it is. It is so rare that I meet someone who believes in objective truth and seeks it (though I find many who claim they do). Mass propaganda is sophistry, and it warps philosophical discourse into a relativized Alice's Wonderland playground for deceivers and rhetoricians to centralize power. Anti-realism is a profound memeplex, and it is pushed by the Rand-Locke memeplex in convenient locations. The superior tactical cleverness attributed post hoc is something I see in most tribes today.

People, in general, are profound liars as well; it is extremely rare to find one who isn't constantly lying to themselves and others throughout the day. It's so pervasive, people don't even call it lying or are unable to even perceive that's what they and others are really doing even after walking them through it. Deception is part of the social fabric of any power-centralizing (i.e. capitalist) culture, including totalitarian regimes.<<ref "t">>

In contrast to Arendt's opening claim, I look at mass propaganda and find their direct audiences flee from believing the worst (except about their enemies, terrorists, pedophiles, criminals, poor people, etc.) in most contexts. I am, of course, a pessimist and someone who sees way more darkness in the world than most: [[ridtyawtr]]. Reactionaries have to think the world is better than it is, they have to believe capitalism is making progress, and they have to ignore (or better yet never see) some terrible truths about the state of affairs in order to maintain their self-serving perspective. [[Saint Chomsky]]'s analysis is much, much more accurate.

I wouldn't call that cynicism about just anything, but it is some kind of cynicism about reality and accountability in how we construct our narratives together with integrity. Those who don't think they have an objective moral obligation to constitute themselves with [[The Moral Law]], to seek coherent truth in their [[4DID]], are part of the problem. Even some non-trivial percentage of the professional philosophers (sophists) I know don't believe in the truth.

I hate that Nietzsche was right about the pomo-apocalypse. I fear I am becoming a quietist with the anti-realists. There's nothing to say to Cratylus insofar as an interpretation about realism already required one to beg the question of it. I am sad to see that illness spread through almost everyone to a significant degree. I am going to fail, but I have to try.
