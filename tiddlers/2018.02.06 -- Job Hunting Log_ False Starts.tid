I really need to dive in. I really feel like a failure on so many fronts. It sucks.

* Completed my daily searches for pipefitter positions.
* Applied: https://iapwe.org/apply-49613/
* Applied: http://apply.brightservices.net/ 
** Called them first, we talked. Asked me to fill out application and call back. Was at lunch. Secretary says she'll call me at 2ish.
** It's a temp/headhunter agency.
* Added Milligan to my daily search pattern
* Scoured Craigslist
* Visited Milligan's camps, but Garland was out.
