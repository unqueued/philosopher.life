You any better? How has your week been?

Still mostly a madhouse here getting things together. I'm feeling better, probably 80%.

We have couches to sit on now. \o/

How about you?

How's [[AG]] and [[UJ]] doing?
Thu 9:03pm
That’s true
Thu 9:13pm
They are good —[[AG]] has turned the corner of hating McDonalds to instead liking to buy things

And she has a bday coming —we are gokarting and axe throwing
Thu 9:14pm
Sounds like a badass bday! =)
Thu 9:14pm
I hope so

We are betting that Gpa and [[L]] are going to win the races hehe
Thu 9:15pm
[[UJ]] has started back at the gym and is sore but working at it
Thu 9:16pm
Ugh. Good for him.
Thu 9:16pm
No fun.
Thu 9:16pm
He is braver than I ....the once or twice I work up enough umph to go —I ride the bike and do leg things...I have noodle arms like [[L]]
Thu 9:18pm
Hopefully, we'll get to having a Fitness Routine going again here someday.
