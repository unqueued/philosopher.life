title: Life of Fred: Advanced Algebra

We began Advanced Algebra today. A significant portion of it is just review of the previous book (yay). 

We covered graphing conics, ellipses, circles, parabola, and hyperbolas. 

We dove into functions more than we have before.

f(x) notation is extremely similar to our work in symbolic logic. 1-1 functions, functions onto, and 1-1- correspondences were covered. Considering how functions are understood in terms of ordered pairs and their relation to our graphing was neat. f:A->B notation was new as well (I didn't see that until mathematical logic!). 

I fear I don't have many things to directly teach them in this book. We can cover the concepts, but I'm not a master of them (or this seems too easy now?). In any case, we should be moving onto Geometry soon enough. Afterwards, I will have the kids go back to completely the Pre-Algebra 1 book and moving through all the books. Then we will do Trig together.
