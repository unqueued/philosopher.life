title: 2019.08.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Hang the Capitalist

!! Respond to the following gem:

We would hang the capitalists with the rope that they sell us, but if we were to hang the last capitalist, another would appear to sell us the rope.

Psychopaths make a choice not to empathize where they are morally obligated to. The turn it off when it is convenient. We all make moral mistakes (well, technically, there are some possible versions of each of us from any given point on our timelines that don't, by definition), and those are the result of choosing not to empathize with [[others]] and exercise [[The Golden Rule]] [[irwartfrr]] to our contexts. Generally, aint nobody who is perfect, and aint nobody who is perfectly imperfectly. Thus, we all sit on a spectrum of fighting our egoistic urges (generally prizing our selves above others, but there are exceptions), and almost none of us escape psychopathy (I certainly don't!). Capitalists have habituated their psychopathic vices. 

To claim we can't be better, to claim we don't have a choice in who we are, to claim the impossibility of socialism (which this sentence may be doing, and it may not) is maliciously defeatist. I agree with the prediction, but it is not an absolute description of all possible transworld identities available to us. I appreciate the hyperbole nonetheless.

[[T42T]] obligates violence in some contexts. Never forgetti.
