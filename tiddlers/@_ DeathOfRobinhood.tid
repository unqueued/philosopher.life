Things that leap out: Arendt's concept of the will; Disney's chunking of the will; as an animator, assuming non-propositional processes when thinking motive and sequencing out actions. 

I haven't watched Quinn's Body Beautiful yet, but will get to that to see what I'm missing.

I'm recently revisiting Donald Crafton's [[concepts|https://www.academia.edu/34912973/Animes_Actors_Constituting_Self-hood_through_Embodied_and_Figurative_Performance_in_Animation]] of embodied and figurative performances, and Herhuth's article will, I hope, help inform how I think about performing in embodied mode at least.

That is a great intersection for us! This is good work too. Thank you. What leaps out for you here?

Thanks for staying up to compose that entry on Moral Luck. I'm sorry for worrying you. The news I received does not affect me directly, but people for whom I want better things. I could feel my heart beating in my chest all night, but I'm to blame. My reasoning is childish and I appreciate your instruction.

If you have a collection of quotes sitting around somewhere, I would like to read them; you know how to pick out the [[salience]]. There is something special about [[antipleonasm]]s. I would argue, in your shoes, that Christ is something like an antipleonasm (in terms of moral responsibility only the //finite// aspect of the [[fff]] is applicable). I'm extremely curious about your numinous/voluminous claim. I stand on quicksand trying to reason about how the transcendent becomes immanent to any [[dok]]. When it comes to [[faith]], one of our strongest disagreements will be about the conditions of freedom; that may also be worth our attention.

Yes, I got stuck on that Booth quote and thought the possibility that someone somewhere might benefit from a visit from some reddit nomad was worth the time to it took to share it.

Don't worry about taking a lot of time to respond, or even about making your responses to me especially sophisticated. I'm still working of my response to the other half of our earlier exchange (the 'God email') and am coming around to the idea that the numinous does not necessarily reside in the voluminous :)

I am a fan of [[that quote|https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/c9pafd/william_booth_on_loneliness/]]. I take it you've been reading //Friendship at the Margins//. The letter is taking forever, btw. I'm sorry.
