title: 2019.06.26 - Prompted Introspection: Living the Dream

!! What do you really like about where you live?

I love my answer here: [[2017.11.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: Mountains & Forests]]. Our internet has improved year after year. I don't complain about it anymore. In fact, we're supposed to be receiving gigabit speeds here in a bit (though, I'll believe it when I see it). 

I've now lived here for several years, and I still don't really know the area. I regularly use my GPS to travel around town. I live on the internet, in my head (up my ass), with my family, and in the world of ideas. It's where I really do my living, and my geographic location just isn't too important except insofar as it enables my family to at least survive (if not thrive at times). My wife is the same. We are homebodies, and we live in surfing, media, walks, fucking, meals, and discussion. I love the mountains, but I would be fine without them as long as these other conditions are met.<<ref "r">>

I can say my particular apartment complex has gotten more ghetto, but I don't mind. I don't really belong with anyone besides my family, but I think we are fitting misfits with our neighbors. That said, excepting [[The Janitor|Afterschool Teaching]], I've not met a moral person yet since living here. I'm afraid that is the case no matter where I go.

Living here has had severe ups and downs, and the future doesn't look so good. I'm going to enjoy what we've got while we do while still fighting for what matters most. There is still [[hope]]. I'm living the {[[Dream]]} with my best friend in the world and our children. It is my honor and pleasure.
