title: 2019.10.21 - Afterschool Teaching: Grin

Opened up a book of timesheets, and someone wrote: "[[gh057]]" with an artistic squiggle underneath, lol! `/grin`. It's a present for me! I'm the only person who was likely to see that page since I'm the only person who goes back through them to fill out my paperwork. 

Paperwork was cleaned up some, and prep was so fast we had time to talk. Carson had a good week with her family. She spent much of her time announcing her engagement. Carson asked me about how I homeschool, etc. 

I butted heads with everyone who felt the kids should remain isolated by their age groups. I'm the only person who believes they have a moral right to mix with other ages. Their argument was that the 8th graders discussed content which was too mature for the 5th graders (oh, god forbid!). "But, I never even heard those words until I got into high school." Spare me, asshole. They look at me like I'm retarded for questioning it. `/facepalm`. I totally get having people with similar homework being together, and I can appreciate isolating the fools where necessary, but this is not justified prison behavior. I've asked them to question their beliefs here, but I can see they will fail.

Whitney pointed out that parent-teacher day is coming up, and we will have nowhere to go. We contemplated ending the program during that time period and perhaps requiring parents to speak with teachers. Matt only saw parent/guardians for 4 of his 120 kids last time. 25% of my students miss over 10% of class days. Self-fulfilling prophesies. Yeah, seems like glorified babysitting.

I am surprised by the number of bumps and high-fives requested from me. The curve is wide; I'm truly hated by several (understandably). It seems like everyone enjoyed their break though. Two people performed some kind of reading (beyond vidja games, texting, and instagramming). I connected as best as I could.

I was required to take up the report ~~cards~~ sheets for photocopying. Delp was pleased, but I wasn't. I only have two students who have managed straight A's. Average grade is around an 82. Abysmal to me. =(. These kids could accidentally shit out an A in many of these classes. 

Not much homework today.

My students and I talked about why I prefer to have my music sitting on my hard drives. They've never heard of someone doing that, and so I had to explain the difference between streaming and what I do. 

MadameM came with me today as I took the 7th, 8th, and the 6th which Carson didn't want (she sent the handful of students who wanted to be with me as well ;P). MadameM does such a good job talking with my roughest kids; I'm not even in the same league. She's apartment hunting for a job in SC for helping kids in juvie. This would likely get in the way of her college education. I'm choking back tears begging her to take her full ride to UT. She just smiles at me, telling me her mother says the same. You're killing me. Her sacrifices for others (even if ignorantly) to the point she isn't even going to do right by herself (and likely not the greatest good in the longer term, admittedly). I probably do not merit being in the same room as this blinding woman. This 19yo kid walks on water.

6CM and I played magic. He went and spent his money on a starterpack. Lots of boys played with us today. 

6JR asked me not to be angry like the other teacher because I found he had snuck an apple. Naw, kid. I know you are hungry. I made sure he got another one. 

8J read dirty jokes. It may have been stilted, sounding like an 8yo reading, but at least there's something he finds worth reading in front of others. They laughed that I laughed with them. Well, I'm not stopping him from valuing reading, but I asked him to not be so loud in case someone wanders by in the hall.

"Make sure you hide that away before you go into the halls, 7C," "Hide what?," "[[Right]], [[good]],"<<ref "t">> "`/grin`"

10T and I talked about college and welding. He doesn't have a dad, and his mom clearly works her ass off for him. Long conversation.

I sat with my children until they were picked up. 7CM came to sign her sister out. She is looking happier now that she's at another school (kicked out of this one). Fly, child.
