title: 2017.08.03 -- Prompted Introspection Log

!! Why did you end your friendship with Nyles? Why did he make you sad enough to end the friendship? Are you happier because of ending the friendship?

I had been drifting away from Nyles for a while during my depression. I think he was an emotional vampire of sorts. I think he did not return the respect I gave him. 

In part, our interests just diverged. I lost interest in magic, for example. We talked league a bit, but we didn't really play much at the same time. Theorycrafting wasn't as fun. Politics and ethics were kind of one-sided. Our experiences were vastly different. There wasn't much pointing to bouncing ideas off him, and it wasn't enjoyable talking to him. 

His visit with my family cemented my view of him. There was a particular moment in the magic shop that I saw that he just lacked charity and the intellectual integrity to have humility. It was the final straw. I realized who he was, and that our relationship wasn't working. I just let him go.

Nobody likes losing a friend. Was it the right choice? I think so. I could be wrong, but I'm not convinced it was a healthy relationship.
