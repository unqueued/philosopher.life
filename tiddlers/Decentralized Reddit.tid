You have to make money as a developer.

Build a tool that everyone hosts. [[Outopos]] style is fine. Direct users have to participate in the network and donate RAM/CPU/Storage/Bandwidth, etc. to the network. That buys them access to be lurkers/viewers of the content. 

* Pay to view private content networks
* Pay to search/filter (and have others search/filter for you)
* Pay to participate/submit (metafilter style), which is very anti-spam.

This looks like some generic blockchain bullshit, I fear. It would be very hard to take down, censor, and it would be the cheapest possible infrastructure (because it would be user-run). 

Could go DAO style. Or I hold the master key, and everyone else has their own. Developers can be paid to contribute from this fund, and even join the DAO as fulltime developers.
