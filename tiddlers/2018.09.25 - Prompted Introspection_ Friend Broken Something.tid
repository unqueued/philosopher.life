title: 2018.09.25 - Prompted Introspection: Friend Broken Something

!! Has a friend ever broken something or yours? How did you react?

Okay, so I know friends have broken things of mine before. Those things can't have been very important to me because I can't remember any of these instances. Shit. I'm losing my mind here. How can I not remember stuff like this? I'm not sure how I reacted, though I can probably guess depending on the context. 

Okay, so I can recall times I've broken other people's things. It's easy to point out my own errors, rofl:

* 9, my mother's lamp playing with a ball in the house
* 10, the basement window playing wallball
* 10, the basement window playing wallball
* (le sigh) 10, the basement window playing wallball
* 14, my mother's special white vase ...playing with a bouncy ball. GODDAMNITY@!#$ROIADS:asl;kdjawgf
* (...I like balls)

Wait, I remember. My friend ripped my shirt at 16? playing football. He felt bad and asked to buy me another one (he knew I was poor). I told him not to worry about it: I mean, cmon, we are playing football!

Oh, you know, my brother [[AIR]] ripped a shirt of mine at 17(?). He actually wasn't being kind, but he's like 6 years younger. He realized he made a mistake, and we just let it go.

Look, I know people break things. I just can't remember this stuff well enough. I think that can often be a good thing though. Jubilee! Forgiveness is an important concept to me: [[2017.07.08 - Prompted Introspection Log]]. I can't say I'm great at it, but that is one nice part about losing my memory. This is super common as you age. Bad things are culled away, and it's one of the reasons people confabulate about the past and hold nostalgic perspectives. I don't know if this has evolutionary advantages or is just an accident. Alright, so I've decided there is at least one good thing about my memory fading so crazy hard; let's hope I can remember it.

I've had my heart broken too.

I'm forced to look at this through the Hohfeldian property rights lens. What counts as breaking again?
