title: 2019.07.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Talking

* Woke at 11
* Had my offspring do their chores.
* Coffeebliss
* We all talked, had coffee.
* Hotdogs, watermelon, but didn't have the grill or picnic for fear of rain (never hit though)
* Swimming
* Lots of talking about everything under the sun.
** Tons of philosophy, RP, thinking about family, work, etc.
* Talked about Final Fantasy. I'd like to play some kind of MMORPG with my offspring. They need to know the experience, and it's important that it can be something they can walk away from.
* Ribs, watermelon, brussel sprouts, pineapple, wedges
* Talked
* Some kind of chocolate liquor that was the tits.
* Watched some music vidyas
* Walked and Talked
* //Lucky Number Slevin//, and halfway through they remembered we had seen it.
** Hilarious mirroring of [[2017.07.01 - Carpe Diem Log]]. But, it was different today. I'm not sure what to make of it.
** Fascinating to see what is the same and what is different here. Lol.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4, dog-tired, woozy
