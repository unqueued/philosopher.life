title: 2018.07.06 -- Prompted Introspection: Beauty

!! What is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?

I would argue it must be my representation of [[The Beautiful]] itself (the representation stuck in my mind, not the wiki, obviously). Platonists be Platonizing. This has a [[gfwiwcgws]] component to it, as well a unification/resolution problem with exactly how the aesthetic relates to [[The Good]] itself. I'm not in a position to answer this question in a significant sense.

To me, spiritual experiences can be artificially induced, but the certainty of meaning at the Kiekegaardian religious layer is perhaps the most beautiful thing I've ever encountered. It's addictive to the point of bias. But, I aim for anti-luck contextualist confidence, not certainty!
