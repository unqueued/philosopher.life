Good and you?
Nov 6, 2019 6:39pm
Yup. Solid, grinding along.
Nov 6, 2019 8:05pm
Trying to prep what we can. Still another 2 months before we head out.
Nov 6, 2019 8:05pm
We will miss you guys dearly ðŸ˜©
Nov 6, 2019 8:49pm
We're going miss you guys too. As much as we are excited to move, moving away from the people we care about is awful. =(. I am glad we are good about chatting. That will be the way we get to stay connected!

Also, how's your new position going?
Nov 7, 2019 12:40pm
Has your schedule normalized somewhat for ya?
Nov 7, 2019 12:40pm
Definitely-  I hope we can all stay in touch for years to come! New position is great very happy very appreciated kids are awesome! Everything I thought I was moving here for so I really cannot complain. Weâ€™ll probably end up moving closer this way thatâ€™s the only thing that kind of gets to me itâ€™s a 25 minute drive every morning. But itâ€™s all good well worth it as far as my schedule goes itâ€™s been kind of crazy only because itâ€™s me and eventually one other person and Iâ€™ve been covering for her until she can start plus parents are leaving for Chicago tomorrow morning so I will be covering the weekend and the new girl starts Monday.

Nov 7, 2019 2:33pm
