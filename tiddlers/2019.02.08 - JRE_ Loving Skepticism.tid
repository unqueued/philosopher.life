Still at the party. Sorry.
FRI 5:56 PM

I called my brother up twice. He took a nap after getting home. There was no party. No one showed, and that seemed to be what he found after asking around. He is now convinced organizing isn't as big a problem with these folks as he initially assumed. It may just take years to earn their trust.

I asked him to look at [[EFF: Cover Letter]]. He read it right there on the spot with me (I wasn't anticipating that).<<ref "2020.02.08-1">> I'm grateful. My brother is exceptionally kind. His compliment was that it was genuine, and he said he has no idea how to write this letter to maximize my odds of getting this job. He tells me they are looking for someone who has a bigger name, who has more credentials, who has larger networks of people to draw upon, etc. I agree with him: I am basically a nobody. It's highly unlikely they are going to even take the time to give me a real look. He's convinced someone is just going to throw away my application without a second look. He thinks (and so do I) that my only shot is to catch someone's attention long enough for others to think I'm worth a deeper inspection. My brother is consistently cynical about my {[[dreams]]}, but he lets me down gently. I'm grateful to have someone just tell me like it is, even when it hurts. Our predictions are the same. 

I appreciate that my brother does not conflate description with prescription here.<<ref "2020.02.08-2">> It's not a matter of competence in his eyes (at least if I understand him correctly); I'm just not immediately recognizably cool or sexy enough. I appreciate my brother's preferences for the wisdom of the crowds too, especially since he often doesn't trust himself.

He said I might find some [[others]] though. That might be right. It would be awesome to know anyone at the EFF. Lol!
