* Think About It

*** I've found the most important hack is knowing what is salient in the first place. Cultivating my attention on what matters is the never-ending first step. I find programmers are excellent at reasoning about means to ends (coding specified machines), but I've not met many who can reason about [[The End]] terribly well. Most don't even believe meaning is real all the way down.

*** And, yet, I found the tools enormously valuable as starting points. I always researched it carefully for my professors or myself. Ironically, I don't give a shit about accrediting, but I do care about whether or not people are actually learning to put together [[salient]] arguments given what is at their disposal (sometimes, those can't be nicely peeled apart).

*** Except, percepts are far richer than that. It's probably petabytes or radically larger. Picking out that 1.5MB signal from the noise is quite a feat.

*** And, yet, you still haven't distributed the means of production. That is the fundamental power differential.

*** So close. Despite the trash I talk about academia, the transformation is far more extensive than this article implies. I heard this argument plenty in grad school too, and it's important.

*** I grant that we should be concerned with how education is bent to serve the interests of the elite. I am obviously opposed to the claim that education itself is not valuable, but I'm fine ripping apart the market of mere signaling. Bloomberg isn't careful enough, even if I adore many of the moves here.

*** It has been invaluable to me to study how other people define me and my age group. Turn your realpolitik goggles on. Be aware of the predation. Understand what you are reacting to and undermine+overmine it wisely. You must locate yourself in [[The Great Human Conversation]] and material dialectic. I cannot say I have succeeded at the task.
