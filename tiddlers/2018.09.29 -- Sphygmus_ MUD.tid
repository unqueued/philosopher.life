title: 2018.09.29 -- Sphygmus: MUD

You have updated your site; it's started to have more shape. You have an aesthetic entrance that I could not have conceived of. It is a joy to refresh your site in my browser each day. I have two immediate thoughts come to my mind.<<ref "l">>

You are purposely reaching for your audience first before yourself. It's clearly art built specifically for others! I'm excited to see it unfold. 

The second thought is that it reminds me of [[MUDs|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD]]: I mean this as a compliment. It's more narratival than I imagained a wiki could be. It reminds me of a living game! Perhaps it is a semi-graphical MUD. I played Everquest for many years (and many other RPGs). At the moment, or at least so far, it feels like an introduction to a platform for hosting your interactions with avatars/penpals while weaving a story together. It's a quest! Your wiki is inviting and provocative! 

I'm incapable of doing what you're doing here, and I probably don't understand it well enough. I could easily have misinterpreted or misunderstood your vision. I'm just thinking out loud, trying to understand what you are making as you design it. You might not fully know what you want it to be (I barely know for my own wiki), and I don't want to be an annoying "backseat driver" asking "Are we there yet?" or anything like that. You may change it radically many times, and I have no idea where you are going with it. I'm enjoying thinking about it though. It's fascinating to watch you build. I'm watching you craft in awe.

There is a possibility you are in a deep think! If so, please ignore me. Don't let me distract you from your creation. Talk to me only after you've caught your breath at the surface. I'll be watching and cheering you on as you dive.

Also, how do you get the "created | last edited"? I want that! How is that not default behavior in TW?
