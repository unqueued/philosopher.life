title: 2019.03.24 - Prompted Introspection: Bone Flute

!! What musical instrument(s) do you play or wish you could play?

Serendipitously, [[The Remodeling]] from yesterday included this question: [[2018.01.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: Musical Instruments]]. I'm going another route.

Lady Melisandre, granter of wishes, I wish to work on your musical instrument as you play my bone flute. I have practiced, read books, and greatly enjoy some kinds of music. It would be quite the honor, pleasure, and a novel experience I'd never forget.
