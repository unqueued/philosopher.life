title: 2017.01.10 - Letters with R

//This is the first letter I actually launched from this site. I'm lucky to have had [[R]] to listen to me. She may have been the first visitor; I'm not sure. Even the domain name is old! This correspondence sits in stark contrast to the oldest [[Relic]] on this wiki: [[2016.10.17 - Letter to Mom and Dad]]. Unfortunately, I have little record of the first few months of this wiki. I cannot begin to tell you how many tears I shed in beginning this project. It has been so costly to me.//

Hey R,

Here is the site you are looking for:

https://h0p3.xyz

I suggest starting with the About wiki page.

Fun facts:

# h0p3 = hope (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet)
#Traditionally, getting your computer to print "hello world" on the screen is the first program that every newbie writes in a programming language.
#The top-right hand corner has a double arrow to open the sidebar. You can see recent edits there (among many other options/tools).

Let me know if you need anything. It is very much a work in progress.

You can reach me at this e-mail (or however you wish).

Sincerely,

h0p3

Hi, h0p3.

Still reading. You are a brilliant writer. And you are boldly honest. I appreciate that. It is rare.

I see your struggle. I will understand more as I get deeper into it, I am sure, but I am not offended or angry at all. Our perspectives are different, but I respect your willingness to chase the truth. I also see the despair that is chasing you. Keep ahead of it, and send out a clear signal if you sense it closing on you. We are here, and we will help.

I know that you worried on some level that I would break contact with you out of shock. Worry less. I am right here and I am not going anywhere. Lean this way when you need to lean. I choose to believe that the faith you lost will find you. I know you won't deny me the comfort of that belief, even if you find it highly unlikely.

Thank you again for trusting me with this level of transparency. More Later.

Love you! 

R

Hey R,

(I'm sorry, I didn't know the last half of your first name was capitalized.)

Thank you. I don't have the words to tell you how much it means to me that you are listening and talking to me about this. It is encouraging to not be so alone on this path.

Love,

h0p3
