!! What is the best way to educate the world on lead and how it affects people, just one person at a time?

This is such an odd question, Samwise.<<ref "f">> What I find most interesting about the question isn't //what// we'd be teaching, but simply the //how//. As usual, I'm going to point you to decentralizing power in general. It turns out that education is entangled with broader kinds of power. The real question is how to get people to engage in serious dialectics with each other. How do we turn people into philosophers?  

This reminds me of the Unity of the Virtues. Saint Plato and Saint Aristotle saw so timelessly. The convergence of many answers into one beautiful answer is sometimes inevitable. Ironically, the Neo-Aristotelians will tell give you a non-cognitivist answer that borders on claiming there is no calculable truth to the matter, `/facepalm`. I get that we can't be ideally perfect; we are [[fff]]. I see the [[infinigress]]es here enough to agree to crucial critiques of codifiability. 

It turns out that teaching becomes radically more complicated with machine learning and biotech. There is a dialectic process that I simply can't predict. The transhumanists may be correct about that singularity. The ideal may rapidly ratchet up beyond what I can predict.
