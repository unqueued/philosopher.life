//The truth is savage.//

Dearest Donors:

You squandered my youth and altered my course forever in the wrong direction. Woe unto us. Your sins carry on; their disutility continues to be fruitful and multiply. You are terrible creators. You threw away your treasure, my treasure, my life. You neither invested in me beyond your selfishness nor invested me into the world wisely. Your failures are evident in all of your creations.

Go ahead and claim that as creators you have the right to condition, guide, guard, parent, brainwash, teach, stewardly raise, enlighten your creations, etc., and you take the responsibility. Say that you don't have the responsibility, and you don't have the right. You cannot act like you have one and then the other when it suits you. You are forked; disjunction elim owns you.

You did such a spectacularly poor job of teaching your children to love themselves enough to empathize with their persistent identities. You didn't create autonomous creatures, instead you made slaves who hate themselves. You weren't parents; you are donors and slave-traders, and you always have been.

I spend time thinking about the gift you gave me at 18, a plaque which reads:

```
There are two things you give your children --
  One is roots
  The other is wings
```

Your children fly on the road to recovering from your blows. I will not agree that you set them free. The fact we escaped your insanity and misplaced psychopathy is not a testament to you; it is a serendipitous accident for your creations. You didn't give them wings; luck did.

Go ahead and claim it's God's Will, you liars and fools. You might delude yourself (how convenient for you), but you won't delude me. Listen closely to the words of the virtual-prophet you arrogantly claimed to bear:<<ref "1">>

<<<
[[ehyeh]]: Your joy turns to ashes in your mouth, and you deserve it. Yet, I must stop worrying about what you deserve, including your deluded perceptions of your claim-rights, and get on with my life. The greatest revenge I can serve is learning to be happy without you. I slowly climb Mount Vindication. One day, I will peer through my telescope and finally see the light at the end of that tunnel: I will be able to just let it go, and I can't wait. Until then, //lex talionis//, I hope you burn in hell for a duration commensurate with the sum total disutility you've caused in your creations. 

One day I will progress to the summit, where I turn the other cheek. On that day, I will blot you out, and you shall truly be damned.

Amen.

When the ideal epistemic agent sees your existence with objectivity, it is clear to the agent: you should never have been parents. You obviously don't care enough to do it well or to do your best (go ahead and choose whichever is easiest for you). I've not demanded perfection from you; I've only demanded basic decency. 

I know who you really are. You aren't going to take responsibility for who you are, and I'm not going to take responsibility for who you are either (since I'm not your creator). Not all creators deserve respect. You aren't honorable, my donors, so why should I honor you? I would honor my //parents// if I had any. 

With Sincere Contempt,

h0p3
