You should play games all the time, and that way you'll be prepared for emergencies.

Casual practices are fine for addressing casual situations, but when a significant issue arises — one requiring deliberation and with significant priorities on the line — your casual practices will be insufficient. You will fail, and you will hurt people.

When we're deciding what restaurant to visit, there's no real way to lose: it's a date night, it's a family night, it's a night out! Ramen, spaghetti or udon, you can't fail. That's what makes it a perfect opportunity to try co-cognition in the form of a game. Write your options down. Hold a Rock Paper Scissors election. Roll some dice — even deliberate randomness is a higher-order form of collaboration than the familiar "friendly debate". When the stakes are low you have a chance to practice something that becomes difficult in times of tension: intelligence.

Casual conversation is rife with injustice, imbalance and bias. It's no way to run a country. It's no way to run a business. It's no way to run a household. Practice process. Become reflexively intelligent.

Practice [[right]]; practice process discipline [[irwartfrr]]. Practice for [[W5H]], [[gfwiwcgws]]? Life has a meaning and purpose beyond the one you give it. Prepare yourself for the angels, demons, and helpless in the desert. You aren't going to defeat Golem by accident; to whatever extent you ought, you must justifiably habituate and accumulate the memetic and material capital sufficient to answer the famine and the ~~f~~beast. Play life like a vidya game which matters all the way down: [[Applied Computational Existentialism]].

Learning to wrestle correctly even in slow and light environments provides a scaffolding and direction for wrestling hard. Part of playing a game wisely is anticipating escalations in difficulty. 

Of course, we don't mean mere intelligence here, we mean the sort which is wise, which picks out what actually matters in the context of all contexts as best as possible. Otherwise, there is no reason to prepare or practice which is categorical, and this would be reduced to a flimsy hypothetical imperative.
