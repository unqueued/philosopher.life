title: 2017.06.05 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.06.04 - Philosophy Probe Log]]
** I had literally nothing to say. It wasn't even that interesting. I just shat this one out. I don't want to do more like these. I think this log is failing. In fact, I'm killing it. That is not the quality of work I want to create. If I change my mind, I'll revive it from the graveyard.
* [[2017.06.04 - Family Log]]
** I love my family. I'm really glad we do these logs. I enjoy taking the pulse and thinking together with them. 
* [[2017.06.04 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** This may be short, but I like more than the Philosophy Probe Log.
* [[2017.06.04 - Link Log]]
** Short.
* [[2017.06.04 - Diet Log]]
** DCK makes me not hungry at all.
* [[2017.06.04 - Cry Log]]
** It can be good to shed tears.
* [[2017.06.04 - Wiki Review Log]]
** I was talking to my family about this log during the meeting. My wife thinks it is a good idea. So do I. I'm hoping that eventually, my children will be doing the same thing. I want them to literally have a conversation with themselves and to think about how they want to continue building and improving upon this practice.
* [[2017.06.04 - DCK Meditation]]
** I'll ask my wife to look over it.
* [[2017.06.04 - k0sh3k's Wiki Log]]
** I adore my wife. I know she's been having a rough time. I really want her to do with us, desperately.
* [[2017.06.04 - 1uxb0x's Wiki Log]]
** I'll have to ask them about magic today.
* [[2017.06.04 - j3d1h's Wiki Log]]
** Not much to say. The diet log is more consistent. We'll get there.
