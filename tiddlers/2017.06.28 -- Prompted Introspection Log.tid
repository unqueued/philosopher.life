!! Are you addicted to social media?

I forgot I wrote about this a bit before: [[2017.05.27 -- Prompted Introspection Log]]

Define addiction and social media. 

Presumably, you mean by addiction a dependence with negative utility or some unacceptable opportunity cost. This, of course, is far more complicated than it appears. I worry you will simply slip into saying truisms or smuggling in significant normative content. 

I don't know how to define social media either. You go first. Watch me blow your line-drawing up. You are such a fucking idiot, Samwise Gamgee.

Alright, this wiki may be a kind social media, right? I'm being social with myself, and there are people who read it. It is fairly unidirectional, admittedly. It isn't a rat race with anyone but myself. My reputation is irrelevant. My social standing is almost irrelevant in this wiki. It's not the norm. I am dependent upon it though. But, I would strongly argue against it lacking utility for me. So, not an addiction, right?

I use Reddit and HN a ton. I don't really use them socially anymore though. Are they bad for me? I've definitely wasted time on them. But, I've also changed my life reading them many times over.

Thus, my answer is no.
