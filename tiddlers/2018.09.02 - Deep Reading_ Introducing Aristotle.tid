When I look at the emphasis on particulars, I can't help but see the context relativized. The forms of all contexts and emergences in OOO flattened. Point to any set of things, and it is a particular substance/form, right? 

Ultimately, [[The Salience]] must give us far more. I do not accept the denial of metanarrative. Even the call to flatness is metanarrative which implodes on itself.
