title: 2018.06.11 - The Matrix: In the beginning...

The movie is one of my memetic talismans. I take it with me on all my journeys. It obviously stays with me as I jump from existential vortex to vortex. That is no accident. It's profoundly correct to force us to reconcile with many of the fundamental assumptions of philosophy (which just so happen to be the axioms which justify our reality maps and identities).

Much of who I am I owe to this film.

Being ridiculously Straussian, might we say that the trinity reminds of the dialectic, with two wrestles and third sublator. Usually we think of it as two, sometimes three, and sometimes one. It's like binary with an emergence computational property arising from it. Being and Non-Being enable for the world to not be flattened into being all the same. There is difference in the world, and thus meaningful meaning. 

Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, Hinduism, and Judaism

Escher, Neuromancer, Ghost in the Shell, 2001: A Space Odyssey, kung-fu

Power, existence, eternal life, the meaning of life...it's all there.

Morpheus paraphrases the Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi when he asks Neo, “Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you weren’t able to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world?

Interpretations of The Matrix often reference Baudrillard's philosophy to demonstrate that the film is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries. The influence of the matrixial theory of Bracha Ettinger articulated in a series of books and essays from the end of the 1980s onwards was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock[74][75] and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel.[76] Bracha Ettinger's matrixial theory is referred to explicitly quite late in the film through the expression "primal matrix" but it is visualized from the beginning via the alliance between Neo, Trinity and Morpheus, their "co-birthing" in a womb-like "shareable time-space", their co-existence in different dimension at the same time, their relation to the maternal oracle and more. Her "archaic" matrix is always in the now and the future, depends on human affects and desires, and proposes a different relations between the symbolic and the real. This Matrix is fragile yet it is resistant to the dominating Matrix of the mechanical coded simulated and manipulated consciousness that forecloses and rejects it. In the Ettingerian matrixial sphere freedom goes together with responsibility. The links between Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the Oracle, right from the very beginning and all along the film, manifest the possibility of "transconnectedness" in proximity and in distance, which is not global and can't form a "web of webs". Its webs are always specific, invested by an "Eros of borderlinking" and related to different processes that Ettinger has named "metramorphosis" (feminine-maternal-material morpheus).[77][78][79][80] This is then another kind of Matrix hidden behind the Baudrillard kind.

Why don't the agents not hear him? How are they not visualizing this? How do they not know he's in the other cubicle? Why aren't they monitoring the other humans in the building with him as they do in so many other contexts?

We see the architect scene when the Agents first acquire Neo.

Philosophers lead two lives. Caught between two worlds.

Agent Smith says only own life has a future, but he doesn't specify which. 


They got the Star Trek "bug" moment down pat.

Why aren't they more directly following Neo? Why don't they just assume his shape once he can see Morpheus. They don't need a bug for that, right? What does the bug even do? 

Why does Neo recall the dream of the bug only after it is taken from his body? Wouldn't have known it was real before that?

When it rains in The Matrix, it rains hard.

The down the rabbithole sound reminds me of ketamine (or vv.)

Again, define "The Construct"?

How humans are energy sources makes no sense. That we help the great computer/machine, I believe. The entropy issue is hard to escape though.
