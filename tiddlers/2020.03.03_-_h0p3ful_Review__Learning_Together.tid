** I still don't know how to do this well enough with you, btw. We're learning together.
*[[2020/03/02 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: Appearances]]
** [[YWSOAM]]. It's yet another blessing and curse.

** People are going to hate your brother without justification.
*** I work extremely hard to show him what consists in his [[dignity|VOI]], to demonstrate what it means to be [[other]], what is up to [[him|ROG]], hand him every survival tool and lifehack for him I can find in the desert, and attempt to help him own himself as thoroughly as possible. I am definitely a scared dad. I know how the world has treated me, and I know he is in for some serious hell. 
**** Don't get me wrong. You don't have it easy either. We know that. That's part of what you and I are working on right now too. 
*** In an unfortunate number of cases, I can protect you from people xor I can "protect" you from the truth. 
**** I am sorry, Alia.
** It's significantly easier to find friends online than in the offline world. We've talked about this many times. 
*** And, of course, school will probably be the strongest windows of time you have available to connecting with people deeply. It's going to be hard to find people who can understand what you do, who care about what you do, who can see what you do, or who can do what you can do. Blessing and a curse. 
**** I am working hard to make sure you are not lonely, that you have support, that your independence is not isolation, that you develop healthy, functional, profound relationships with people. 
***** From my [[arrogant]] perspective: Most people are not as smart as you are, and most people aren't as good as you are. That doesn't mean you can't make connections.
****** I also hope you learn how to set aside what I think, to build your own. To see just how retarded your father can really be, and know that his flaws are going to show up in your code (even without your ability to have done anything about it so often). I am not a good dev in too many respects. 
** Gotta say, this one is super heavy hitting. I hope it's something you'll continue to think about. Friendship is such a crucial thing in life, such a hard thing to define, and one which I have so inadequately been able to prepare you for. 
*[[2020/03/02 -- Life Log]]
** We did one math video. We finished where we were, and then we went on a detour. 
*** I'm glad we did too, since freewill and fate are important concepts. Matches our book as well.
** I appreciate the honesty in your story telling. I also admire its plainness. In time, I am going to bet that streaks of [[salient]] things will pop out or be generated in these.
*[[2020/03/02 -- Wiki Log]]
** You are fascinating. I know it. It baffles me when people I find fascinating think they aren't. I don't know what that means well enough. 
*** I think you also should be very careful in how you compare yourself to me. We are living in different contexts. That isn't to say there isn't a context of all contexts, and that isn't to say there aren't universals, and that isn't to say there isn't a particular set of permissible or one specific thing you ought to pursue in a given case. But, it means that you must engage in profound translation.
*** You might find a lot of people don't find you fascinating, but it turns out that popularity is not going to be the best signal in many contexts.
*** It's pretty hard to bond when you don't share the same interests, and it's even harder when your interests seem obscure, difficult, unfun, overly precise, or too particular. You should ask yourself: "fascinating from what perspective?". 
**** Let's be clear: your goal is not to make yourself fascinating for me (but, there may be some use to making yourself fascinating to me, and you'll need to think about that wisely). Your goal isn't even to make yourself fascinating in so many respects to other people (though sometimes you will be obligated, and these must be considered wisely). You've gotta pick out what is [[salient]]. It's such a hard thing to do. I'm giving all the tools I can.
*[[2020/03/02 -- To-Do List Log]]
** You have a very thorough and elegant bullet-point styling. It's ideal looking, and I appreciate that. I wonder if it's too clean sometimes, and you should feel comfortable making it messy. I don't know how to balance those well enough. It is better to just get it out sometimes and continue sorting through the puke. 
** I appreciate how you are talking to yourself directly (perhaps from multiple angles). It's so wise. It's shockingly hard to do well enough. 
*** You are putting together an epicly hard puzzle of yourself, this changing, autonomous, looping creature. 
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
**  [[2018/03/03 -- Wiki Log]] is beautiful and right: it's good. It's the correct direction, method, and picks out the salient particulars. That should grow.
*** If word counts help, then use them. I think that eventually it isn't so important (and there are other kinds of qualities to measure). What counts as good structuring of any concept or thought is a massively hard problem. Building good incentives and measurements for yourself is wise (which isn't to say we can't overshoot the golden mean here).
*** I don't know what consists in writer's block well enough. I am glad you practice. Make it your habit, a profound one. You have toolsets that most writers could only {[[dream]]} of having.
