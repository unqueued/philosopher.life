title: 2019.03.19 - Prompted Introspection: Vocational Guidance

!! Name someone or an event that guided you in choosing your vocation or work.

Dr. Becker's Ethics class. He graduated from the same seminary as my donors, in the same timeframe, was a pastor, and he could speak my language while bridging me to philosophy. He was exactly what an autistic adolescent PK needed to hear. I hate to say it, but he would hate large swathes of my work.<<ref "d">> I am forever grateful to him. He was a graceful introduction to so much of what matters to me. I still find his collapse of consequentialist and virtue theoretic reasoning into teleology [[beautiful]]. It has been influential to my willingness to bite the unificationist bullet all the way down in moral philosophy.

The dude is alive. I could reach out, but I'm not convinced I will be of any comfort or use to him or [[others]]. I've considered many times, but I still don't think I should. It's so weird to feel grateful and unable to express it. That keeps happening on the wiki. I shed tears, and I wish I knew a way to connect us in a meaningful, plausible, and painless way. I can't close the gap, but I wish to honor the man.
