His false X-chotomies are annoying me a great deal. It's a rhetorical device that sweeps us into his perspective without really even attempting to be open to the possibility that there are other possible answers. These are Sunday School tactics. It's sophistry. Of course, he may try to hide behind the "Parody disclaimer," but I'm not buying it. 

Yet, he still makes good points. His illustrations are worth pondering. I'd have liked a tidbit at the beginning which talks about the nature of these multiple choice questions explicitly. I would absolve him, especially because the rest of the content is valuable.

Percy fires off facts about human sexuality without context or citation. Unfortunately, his picture is incorrect. I used to believe these statistics in the way he has presented them as well. I hold him accountable to his conservative outlook here.
