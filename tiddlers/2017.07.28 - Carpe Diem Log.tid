title: 2017.07.28 - Carpe Diem Log

* I slept too much. I could feel it. That said, the alarm clock woke me up out of my dreams. 
** I'm probably feeling depressed. I must take DCK this weekend. I probably shouldn't take cannabis, as I'm not completely certain I'm passing these tests (the line isn't very bright on the test). I could be called upon any week now for that Yates job. 
*** I have no idea how I'm going to handle it. I would like to have a way back int the door here if I ever needed it. I definitely want to thank them. I doubt they will take it gracefully, but we'll see.
* I felt anxious, but also happy. I love Fridays!
* I packed the remaining stuff into the car (a single load that I can't pack the night before).
* I worked hard.
* For lunch, I went to Wendy's again for the wi-fi and dollar menu. The dollar menu worked, the wi-fi didn't this time. =( I was really hoping to talk to my children and wife.
** Fear not! For soon you shall have tethering and they will have phones!
* At 3, I hit the "Home" button. It was so satisfying. I wore my sandals for the trip too. 
* The car ride was one of the worst of my life. My GPS unit took me on difficult back roads with stop light towns the whole way. It took an extra half hour. My car was dying, my phone didn't work. It was fucking awful.
* I got home, got my hugs, and took a shower.
* Kids installed their new mattresses.
* Inform the Men!
* We got pizza and beer, and we watched GoT.
* Fell asleep to Tosh.
