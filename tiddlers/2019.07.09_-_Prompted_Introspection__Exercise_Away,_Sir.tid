title: 2019.07.09 - Prompted Introspection: Exercise Away, Sir

!! Do you exercise? How has your exercising changed throughout your life?

I am pleased to have a better answer to this question than last time: [[2018.01.22 - Prompted Introspection Log: Exercise]]. 

Exercise has been on the upswing for me. It helps with my depression a bit (though not ideation). I've been doing [[Fitness Routine]] regularly with the offspring. I like how we've reduced it down. I'm especially in need of stretching and regaining my sense of balance. The muscle packs on fast enough, and I'm glad the offspring have a chance to begin to understand what it means to work with their bodies (homeschoolers, eh?). 

I've been walking a lot, and we even walk for [[Family Time]] now. I've not been swimming, but I've been sending my offspring to swim. I've enjoyed playing frisbee with everyone as of late too.
