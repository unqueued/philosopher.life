title: Wiki: /b/ as Wiki Mechanic

Whenever I have a /b/, it's because I don't know where to put it, how to name it, how to categorize, etc. Or, rather, I don't know how to do it better than I'm doing it. Some instances will be more specific in their /b/ness (belonging to a particular directory, for example), and at the top (most generalized), it's just [[/b/]] in {[[Dreams]]}.
