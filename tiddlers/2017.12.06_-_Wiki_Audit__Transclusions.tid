title: 2017.12.06 - Wiki Audit: Transclusions
type: application/x-tiddler

Let's be honest, I'm lazy. I don't want to constantly code pretty links `[[foobar|link]]`. 

I'd rather have foobar1, foobar2, and foobar3 all point to foobar1. Transclusions are an ugly hack, but they work. I use them for the [[TLD]]s and for crucial terminology. 

Sometimes I use transclusions to build molecular objects, but that is uncommon.

I prefer to explicitly point out when I have transcluded. I do this in the title, at the very top of the page, in a footnote, or elsewhere. 

Here's the standard format:

```
//Transclusion: [[Foobar]]//

---
{{Foobar}}
```
