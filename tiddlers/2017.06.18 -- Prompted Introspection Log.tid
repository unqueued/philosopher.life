!!  If you had to describe yourself as a color, which would you choose?

Throw me 'dem softballs, kid!

What does it even mean to describe yourself with a color?

I'm Caucasian, so white or beige or some such Causasian skin coloring. I'm not really monochromatic either. I'm hairy too, and even that has at least 5 shades. No, that's not what you mean. Ok, fine.

Are you asking what color my parachute is? Business-lingo-ified existentialism. Puh-lease.

Okay, do we mean the myriad of culture interpretations of colors? Like the poetic symbolism of Red, and so on? Oh, you want to be a smartass and say all words are like that, don't you? Lol. Fine.

Can't you see that I think this question is a bit stupid?<<ref "1">> 

Fine. I'll try to answer the question. I'm not dodging it. And, I won't give you an ironic answer making fun of you and your stupid question. 

I think Black is the color which I identify with most.<<ref "2">> Yup. Edgelord at your service, m'lady. I like the definitiveness of black. I like how black works with all colors. I like how black is necessary, feels unconditional, and somehow both natural and unnatural at the same time. I like the look of it too; it's easy on the eyes.

I think choosing a color is literally just a dumb social game we play with each other with arbitrarily imbued meanings (in a far more arbitrary sense than language in general). 

See, these are all stupid fucking answers to a stupid fucking question.<<ref "3">>

<<footnotes "2" "But, you already knew that, didn't you.">>

<<footnotes "3" "I don't know who I'm talking to either. But, no, the fact that I chose the question is not something I'm ignoring or is lost to me either.">>
