Just because you forgive yourself doesn't mean I have to forgive you, particularly when you continue the same injustice. Also, you have no working theory for when absolute forgiveness is morally obligated. I have forked you before on the fact that God's Mercy is morally obligated of him. You are in an even worse position for humans.
