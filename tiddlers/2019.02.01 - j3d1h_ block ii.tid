capitalists steal labor wooo
and even if you are payed in return you have to be payed fairly or it's still theft
DAYLIGHT ROBBERY

was gonna make a point that, if someone puts more labor into one of your objects than you did, it's theirs isn't it?
but i guess it makes more sense to say that it's still yours as long as you have not given it away for them to work on

just like you can observe a physical object

so piracy is always immoral in any case? (a: yep, to an ip theorist)
what about remixes? (a: [getting there])

because of 1uxb0x's point: murder is only wrong because you do not have the right to that person, and therefore are not allowed to mix your murder-labor with them as an object
so if you're king of everything murder and slavery aren't problems
