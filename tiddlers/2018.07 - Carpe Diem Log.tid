!! Audit:

* I have to say that post-mortem is the right word. I continually remind myself of my ineptitude. That's okay. How else am I going to get better? I will be as plastic as I can be, and I'll try to train virtue with what I have. I can't expect to change myself overnight.
* Yes, my daughter has matured tremendously over the past few months. Both my children, in fact. I'm glad to see it.
* The facelift on m10 has been absolutely wonderful. I loved the move to KDE, but I loved the move to i3 even more.
* IJ is now a kind of joke. That's okay. I'll get it done when I do.
* I can feel my brother [[JRE]]'s pain in here. 
* This has been a month of high variance in utility. It has had high highs and low lows.
* Augmentation is so common, I've even stopped mentioning it by and large. This is fine with me.
* PPP vanished. =/ I'm sad.
* I continue to lecture my children quite a bit. I hope to start recording far more of it. It's valuable.
* I sleep schedule has fallen into my old pattern again. I am forever a nightowl. I am getting enough sleep though.
* Some of our projects were pretty awesome.
* There were major power outages in our apartment complex this month.
* I rejoice at the chance to contact The Others.
* My wife has been exhausted.
* This has been a bumpy, difficult month. We got a shit ton done though.
