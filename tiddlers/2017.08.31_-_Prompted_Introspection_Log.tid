!! What makes a good Helper/Apprentice?

* Your goal is to make yourself useful.
** Justify your existence on the jobsite.
** Find work to do as best you can, and find work that pushes your understanding of the job.
** Always have the crucial tools for the job on your person. 
*** Flashlight, tape measure, marking instruments, notebook, watch, knife, etc.

* Proactively anticipate the needs of your journeyman before they ask you for it.
** When you get really good, it is anticipating their needs before they even realize they'll need it, or before they've thought that far ahead.
** In a sense, the goal is to understand all the trees of means to your team's ends, to see the process at every little stage, to learn the ins-and-outs of why the trees are structured that way, handling novelty, etc.

* Ask yourself what you can accomplish without being taught how to do it, and also ask yourself what you can accomplish without being told to do it and why. 
** These are two lines you are constantly pushing.

* Good for?...Myself, of course. Thus, a good helper/apprentice is rapidly and constantly improving, seeking to become a journeyman.
** Recognize that the people around you have a vested interest in not giving you competitive advantages. 
*** They only want you to learn enough to be useful to them and no more.

* Tool and Asset Accumulation
** People who possess and know how to use the right tools will accomplish tasks with significant competitive advantages, with less risk, and with more room for error, etc.
** You must invest in yourself professionally. Pick up the right assets necessary to move forward.
** This includes training. Branch out, far, wide, and deep.

* Build a professional network
** Being a journeyman isn't enough either. You must have the right contacts and relationships to succeed in many cases.
** You must open doors constantly and maintain bridges.
*** You are fighting through a tide of nepotism, corruptions, and selfishness in general.
