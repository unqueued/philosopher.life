title: 2018.08.29 -- Sphygmus: Find The Others

//Below, you'll find Sphygmus' words. They have been kind enough to write code for my own wiki, and I aim to respect that gift. I usually quote. I part with that convention here. I will need to think about how to celebrate such a gift more effectively. I am considering modifying the authorship of this TW, field adjustment, or a tag. I'm not sure what mechanic serves us best.//

Today, when I was catching up with your wiki, I noticed you emailed a professor at my hopefully-soon-to-be alma mater. I read the article you'd mentioned and realized - I had taken a class from this professor.

I'm fascinated by the pattern-seeking of my mind to find meaning in these connections - they are random, and yet your email to my one-time professor feels like a way to start the conversation I have been drafting in my head for a while. 

You have become entangled in my mind, alongside my many other unsuspecting mentors, both well-known and obscure. The lives of so many people intertwine in weird and intricate ways, braiding together and apart.

At some moments I check your site from a distraction-impulse, seeking either to avoid some emotion or fill some unconscious need. At other moments it stems from a desire to reach out and connect, to spend some time contemplating the thoughts of a fellow nomad.<<ref "LG">>

I was turned off by the language in your top level directories when I first followed a link from kickscondor to your domain, but returned to dig deeper. I feel a resonance, something that pulled me back and keeps me returning.

I have many thoughts about things you have written, that I have read. Many of those thoughts do not feel fully formed, or I worry that they would not stand up to your scrutiny. Forgive my fumbling first attempt at reaching out.
