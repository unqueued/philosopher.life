title: What Next?

Despite my life falling apart in the past few years, my family's lives have improved significantly since the move. Actually, I feel like my life has been coming together too. That has been hope-inducing and purpose-giving to me. I need to figure out what I'm going to do now. 

The reason I have to live right now is the happiness of my children. I must pursue that purpose with zeal. I can't let that flame die out. Of course, if my childrens' happiness is my telos, then I will have many instrumental values through the necessary conditions for their happiness. [[What is necessary and what is sufficient for eudaimonia?]]

How can I give my children my best? What is best for them? How can I make them happy? Who are they, who will they be, and what do they need? What is my vision for my children? How are the most likely to achieve the highest average utility?

My first practical thought: I'm going to help them become computer wizards and systems-gods.<< ref "1">> They could be jedi-hackers. But, of course, my first thought is too narrow. It is really only a gateway to a broader set of things my children need for the future. They have tobe  philosophical too. They need to find love, to be challenged in the right ways, to figure out their own goals, etc. Achieving happiness is not simple. I need to create [[eudaimonic lifehackers|Eudaimonic Lifehacker]].

Academically, I must help them to:

* become proficient in practical life skills
** Basic accounting and managing their personal finances
*** Do they have a basic understanding of economic, financial, and monetary concepts and principles?
***Do they instinctively look towards with the world in a utilitarian mindset (the only moral perspective which relies heavily upon the frontal lobes)? 
**** Do they practice self-control, planning, and delayed gratification?
**** How much do they use reason to dictate their financial (or even life in general) choices?
** Home economics
*** Can they troubleshoot problems in objects around the home?
*** Do they cook, clean, and organize their home? 
**** Can they make their home a palace they enjoy habitating?
*** Can they gracefully handle having other people in their home (in various contexts)?
* acquire a formal trade skill
* habituate constructive social skills
* round out their education with laser-focused depth in humanities
** I have a very strong point of view in the humanities. It is part of my art and craft in philosophy; the root of the humanities just is my techne.
* become language learners
* become effective self-reflectors




May they be jedi-lifehackers. When they decide to leave my nest, they will have a very practical tool for the [[uberworld|The Uberworld]]. 

How can I raise jedi eudaimonic lifehackers? What is the virtuous character?

They need to learn:

* how to learn
** broadly: what to learn, why, how, from whom, in the right way, at the right time, and so on and so forth
** how to practice
** how to curate information
*** learning which information to curate and why
*** learning how to build their curation toolset
** to develop and tune a bullshit detector
** how to organize and reassess their reality maps
* to consistently engage in the growth cycle of: taking healthy risks, getting hurt (while sometimes succeeding to varying degrees), and learning from their mistakes 
**i.e. to habituatally improve upon their risk taking algorithm in the rewards system of their mind
**to fail over and over and over, and to not give up
** to see the costs of being the kind of person who gives up easily (to be motivated to avoid it)
** to learn how to pick their battles and goals well, and how to mentally land on their feet after they fall
*** to accept failure, to roll with those punches, and to move on
** to constantly analyze their work+life goals
* to work hard, fast, and efficiently
** to convert work into games they find fun and interesting
** to automate work, to offload the heavy-lifting, to passive gain income
** to see the value in their work, to see its limits and potential
*to see their future selves as part of their authentic self. 
**They must recognize and identity with their 4th-dimensional identity. 
**They must plan and think about who they are becoming, because that just is them. 
** They must learn to empathize with themselves, to talk to themselves, to care about who they are. 

Of course, I need to be a much better role-model in this respect. How can I hope for them to succeed if they don't a blueprint to follow?

I can't teach them or motivate them (or help them learn to teach and motivate themselves) without empathy. I have to understand them to teach and motivate them. My goal is to empathize with my children. I must develop reliable, accurate, and rich theories of their minds, and consistently elect to fire off my mirror-neurons to put myself in the hypothetical world generated by the programmatic details of my theory of their minds. I need to get to know them as well as they know themselves, or I at least need to do my best. I can't understand their individual needs or tailor my parenting to them without empathy. 

They need me to empathize with them, that's what loving them is all about. To guide them wisely requires the resources and love to develop a habit which trains me to gutterally enjoy (to like) empathizing with them in all contexts, since after all, that is the only way in which I will have the virtuous disposition, perception, and gutteral reflexes to be a an excellent (arete) parent (MacIntyre's virtue of the practice).

On a different note, I now see that I have to help my parents develop reliable, accurate, and rich theories of my mind, and that can only be done if I can do the same for them in a bootstrapping process. It can't be all on them to find their way through my desert. I have to lead them down my very odd network of thoughts. It is my responsibility to engage them in this way. They need my help to empathize with me. 

Alright, so I have answered "What's next?" or "what it is I'm going to do now" with educating my children correctly and helping my parents understand me. Both of these, fundamentally, are about learning how to be more empathic. I must trust in empathy. I must trust my [[Kantian Intuition Network]] (KIN), and I must do it regardless of the conclusions of my [[Redpill Intuition Network]] (RIN). It is a kind of faith, but even RIN must accept that the bottom of epistemology is obviously faith, it is the only solution to [[the foundation problem|Epistemic Foundation]]. 

''KIN'': RIN, can't you see
