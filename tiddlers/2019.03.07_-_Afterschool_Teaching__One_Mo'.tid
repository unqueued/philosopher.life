title: 2019.03.07 - Afterschool Teaching: One Mo'

Daniel is here today. Mitchell is taking Delp's position. 

5KA and 5TG are not a good pair. I aim to give free rein during snack, but I'm not going to allow psychopathy.

Daniel joked that I think he is naive. The dude's hilarious, and he's gotta be to survive as a fat, homosexual, black man in this region. I am respectful and go out of my way to make sure he knows I'm safe (I know that must be weird to see so much disagreement from me and the other direction). I don't know how to be useful enough to this young man. He obviously want to do [[good]] as he understands it (and it's practical enough). We talked about movies. He knew I'd like //Split//. He asked me if I have a FB. I feel bad about trying to answer this question. I think I should give him my number though in case he would want to talk. 

I'm blown away by 6JK and 6AB today. Normally, I have trouble with them. Talk about biology with them, and they light up. We had a good conversation. We rabbitholed. It's good to see them light up when we talk about what matters. I'm still surprised. My predictions are wrong, as usual. I should just predict my predictions are wrong and never predict any value in trusting them ;P. One of my favorite parts of speaking with kids is having the chance to do what I do with my own when I say "I don't know." Oh, that's when they get super curious ('cause I usually know).

9TP and I talked about welding again. I gave him what little advice I could. I don't have a book to give him. 

6DM choked someone. Oh, dude. Why? I can't allow that. He warmed up a few minutes later though. Regardless, that kid is interesting and personal. I am trying to be of service to him in our conversations.

I see where 8Cf gets it. Her dad makes sense of it. Good for her.

Mitchell finally disappoints, the other shoe drops, and so on. He really does value sports that highly. My god. I understand a kid making the mistake, I don't understand someone in his position making this mistake. 

We talked about 6Df. He pays attention, and I'm pleased by that. I can see he is generically a good father. I'll take that. 

The kids are fed, they are safe, they do make some progress, they get their homework done, and they get the chance to be themselves. I hate being so practical, god damnit. I'm a subversive prison guard, but not terribly effective.
