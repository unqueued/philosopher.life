title: 2018.12.09 - MTG Log: My Daughter Is Cheatyfaced ;P

Son:

Mulled. Vial, waste, port, piledriver, mountains. Ugh. He is wasted and the sole mountain is ported. I cratermaker his vial, and he takes too long to figure out he can port my port. I vial matron for ringleader and get all the cashmoney next turn. Game.

Son:

Skirk, mountain, waste, port, chief, chainwhirler, ringleader. Whirler makes it keepable. He's on the play with lackey. I'm drop skirk. He port, MWM. I mountain, pass. He matrons->Krenko. I have incinerator now, and I'm sandbagging chainwhirler since he's just sitting with his army; I drop warchief instead. The fact is that chainwhirler is only scared of one card and otherwise is a one-sided wrath that only gets more CA if I wait. He wastes me and drops two vials. I ringleader for fucking gold: trashmaster, lackey, incinerator. I do not see how he wins now. Chainwhirler + incinerator wipes his entire board. Lackey->Ringleader for 4x including Krenko. GG.

Daughter:

She figured out we can use my son's instance. She mulls. I keep lackey, vial, matron, waste, port, etc. She caverns, pass. I mountain, lackey. He caverns, and I don't have to worry about incinerator! Connect, warchief, waste her, vial. She drops land pass again. Connect, matron->ringleader. I port her on upkeep (zomg). She drops skirk. I vial pile, swing with all but lackey. She blocks piledriver. Port her remaining mountain. I ringleader->(2xwarchiefs), vial one, swing out the game.

Daughter:

Keep waste, caverns, lackey, MWM, ringleader, matrons. She goes mountain, pass. Ouch. I caverns, lackey. She blows up my caverns, with nothing to drop! Play waste, lackey->trashmaster. She stingscourgers lackey! Jesus. Topdeck caverns like a boss and play lackey, swing and block. She warchiefs, I warchief (we all warchief). I swing with all, including lackey. She blocks him, pass. She warchiefs. Incinerator, MWM, swing her down to 3. Too much tempo to overcome. We're both sitting on 4-5 cards we can't eke into play. Ouch.

She demands rematch. The roflstomps are bad.

Daughter:

Kept caverns, vial, skirk, warchief, stingscourger, MWM, whirler. She goes lackey. Ug. =( Let's hope she doesn't have waste or port. She does. =( TOPDECK PORT, Vial. She wastes my port. God damnit. She MWMs. I ramp vial. She echoes, drops another port. She swing MWM and friend, I drop mine. Yay. Vial warchief. Upkeep, vial whirler then add counter, play cratermaker, swing for 9. She ringleaders for matron, inc, chief, krenki. I swing out though.
