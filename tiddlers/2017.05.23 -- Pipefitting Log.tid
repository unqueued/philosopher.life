title: 2017.05.23 -- Pipefitting Log

I was measuring the fabrication when the teacher came in. He asked me if I had a dream about it last night (I guess that means he realizes I've been thinking about it at home; he regularly tells the others to study at home). It was off by half an inch. So, we took the flange off and repositioned it. Everyone helped us move the fabrication and mount it. It fit quite well. We could have gotten away with not moving the flange, but I'm glad we did. It was beautiful.

The teacher thought our vertical pipe was not plumb. We showed him it was. Thus, in order to find another flaw, he said he wished it was connected to the second fabrication we'd be making. He saw the fabrication sitting there the entire time and said nothing before. Lol. I suppose he needed something to complain about to feel like a teacher here. Instead of removing the fabrication, pulling it apart, etc., we decided to do a 'field modification.' Basically, we made a saddle, and cut a hole with a special drillbit (3" in diameter), and tacked it on there. We had trouble figuring out how to 2-hole the vertical pipe with a horizontal flange (we used the square with a level with the midpoint of the level on a "0" line [which we drew for making the saddle in the first place]). We got there though. This part took quite a while. 

Afterwards, our teacher told us he wanted 45 degree fittings with an offset (it sounded like he wanted a 45 degree roll) on the second fabrication. It also sounded like he wanted a rolling offset, and possibly a special offset if we needed. We struggled quite a while to figure out how to do the math. I felt like an idiot the entire time. According to my math, it isn't possible. That's fine.

Eventually, the teacher came back and rexplained the possibilities. He told us to think about it on our week off. I'm just going to do a flat offset to a T-fitting fairly highly up. That juncture is going to be very crowded. So be it.

Class is officially canceled at this point until next week Tuesday.

Chris said something interesting. He knows a manager at Eastman, and he thinks he may get an interview in August. He said he might not finish the course, and had already talked with my teacher about it. It sounds like he'd get a maintenance job. I told him to go for it and to continue applying. Soon enough, I will do the same.
