title: 2019.02.22 - Prompted Introspection: Flower Gift

!! Tell about a time you were given, or gave, flowers.

I gave a corsage to the smartest girl in my middle school.<<ref "2019.03.02">> I made it myself. No, I'm not smooth or well-socialized. I reasoned that she would like the flower, so I gave her a flower. I was correct in that one case. I'd rather talk than worry about flowers. I probably fail my wife a great deal on this front, lol. Gifts are one of her primary languages of love.
