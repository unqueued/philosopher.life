[1:08 PM] h0p3: How goes it?
[2:11 PM] Shp: I look at you as the guy who broke free, ventured out from the cave and came back with info about the world outside. I only see the shadows and I want to know what you have to say about the objects casting them and whatever else is there - but I feel reluctant to ask because I think at least part (if not most) of your wiki is about that.
[2:27 PM] h0p3: I am a madman, lol!
[2:28 PM] h0p3: Don't feel reluctant about the fact that it might be written in my wiki (or embedded in part of what it means to be in the process of writing such a thing).
[2:28 PM] h0p3: Also, I'm AFKish, work, but I will be responding!
[2:35 PM] Shp: I'm not really here either so we ain't gonna dive deep today :D
