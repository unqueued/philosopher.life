Deeply contextualist, fractal, and anti-hierarchical. Dominant languages have non-universal scope in the dialectics contained in the rhizome. I don't think this work could get more postmodern if it wanted to. It appears to be comfortable with its vertigo. The writing itself is structured in virtue of the contents it reveals. It's actually humorous that way. It proves its own point.

That said, I can't say I understand the work. I'm not sure if it is meant to be fully understood either.
