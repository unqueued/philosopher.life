We talked about dodgeball with the pig. `/giggle`

The chemical plant is slow work. He is annoyed that his apprentice doesn't show fitting respect in some cases (his complaint sounded reasonable to me), especially given some dogwhistling. I suggested my brother consider contracting. He said he doesn't think he has the emotional energy for it but would think about it. I think that's fair.

We talked about the weirdness of my kids and the alienation we experienced as children. He feels like I had more of a social rules book than he did growing up. I there is a difference between having the affective book built into you and being able to cognitively reverse engineer it. It was an odd conversation.
