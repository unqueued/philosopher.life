title: 2019.11.26 - Prompted Introspection: Effects of Violence

!! What effects does watching violence have on people?

Depends on the violence and the people, I assume. I believe this is an unsettled matter. I'd be surprised if it had no effect whatsoever, but I have no idea what those effects would be. I assume there's an extremely wide range, especially since the very concept of violence is much broader than most people realize.
