title: 2017.06.22 - Pipefitting Log

Today was quite productive. I immediately started working on my alignment dogs. I had 8 blocks cut out. I did some measuring and marking, and then I started cutting with the portaband saw. My teacher saw me doing this, and he confronted me. He was disappointed that I didn't take his advice on making them taller.

He seemed to ignore the fact that most of them were already cut before he said they weren't tall enough. At that point, I thought it would be fine to just keep them matching. I'm also convinced, after looking at his, that mine will be just fine. I have over double the thickness of his dogs. 

I think he felt disrespected. He's not a man interested in rational argumentation. I tried to offer my reason for me why I thought my alignment dogs would perform at least well enough. He said they'd work, but it isn't what he wanted. He told me his dogs were just an example. I should have done as he said not as he did, I guess. He called my alignment dogs "beefy" and I think he felt like I had wasted this very thick scrap plate by cutting them short as well (but, I think it was mostly the respect issue).

/shrug, it is what it is.

I kept on trucking. It took all morning to cut them, clean them, and make them safe to handle. I think they look excellent. I'm pretty convinced they will do the job. I'm considering asking the CNC class to drill the holes through my alignment dogs and thread them too. I think that would make them really special. We'll see if they can safely do so. I only have 1" plate, and I probably need 1.5" plate to really do it. I could grow them with welds (I could make buttresses too!). I'll have to think about it. I'm missing the necessary bolts/threaded rods to move any further anyway.

My teacher decided to spend his time with us in the shop (quite rare) working on a project for another building. He even had me cut some aluminum sheets for him for his project. I didn't mind. I'm not sure if this was meant as a punishment or a way of mending, or nothing at all. It was difficult to read. 

While I was working on the dogs, I also bounced back and forth to my group working on the 1.5" socket weld spool for the simulator. I was letting them do the drawing and initial measurements. I've done it many times, and I think it is fine for me to sit this one out. They have dozens of times. That said, every time I would visit, they were waiting with questions for me to answer. I clearly had to help them visualize it, do the harder measurements, and do the math as well. They got there, eventually.

They started cutting pipe, slowly. Chris managed to do very little today. He was straight up lazy. He had no intention of working on the project if I wasn't doing it with him. Lol. He kept making fun of Luke who was working on the fittings. I told him that I was here to practice, and I admired what Luke was doing. Hell, that's what I was doing too. I'm not sure what has gotten into Chris. He seems to be disillusioned. 

Chris cut pipe, and I did the grind work for all but two of the pipes. I'm very fast (and safe!). I think I could outpace the next two fastest students combined. Luke wanted to restart because the pipe was a thicker schedule than usual (probably Schedule 80), and he noticed halfway through that his fittings weren't fitting on his pipes. They fit on mine though. He clearly wasn't grinding much. I thought it would be far more work to start over than just grinding a bit more off his. The rusty pipes are a pain in the ass, I grant. But, moving from tigerpaw to nice thick disks handles the problem just fine. 

After lunch, our teacher took Chris and me into his office. He explained that he would be calling one of his old bosses at Jacobs, a man that was fairly high up, to try and find us jobs at Jacobs. He said he wanted a picture of our current simulator to send him. He also said, /drumroll please, that we needed to finish our books very quickly. Rofl! He was almost panicked about it. He said that we really needed to finish that third book as soon as possible so that we looked better in front of the guy hiring us. Lol. Mind you, this was my argument weeks ago. This is a reversal of his command from the middle of last week. Now he seems to agree with me. Lol! What is happening?

I'm thinking my teacher is finally realizing that he is coming to the end of what he can provide us in this class. He doesn't want to do the 4th book either. We are miles ahead of anyone who has ever come through his class except for people who have been pipefitters for years (and we still destroy them on isometrics and doing it the "right way"). 

I need to make up for this "disrespect." My wife says chocolate and alcohol might be gay appearing. But, who doesn't love chocolate and alcohol? I need to find another way. I'll think about it. Ingratiating myself is perfectly reasonable; it maximizes my utility. Would I suck a dick for a million dollars? Fuck yeah, I would. Give me all the dicks; fit those pipes in my mouth. Shit, I'd suck a (clean) dick for $10k at this point. That would change our lives. Being a teacher's pet costs me far less at this point.

I forgot to mention, JR was just sitting with us all day and screwing around on his welding. He doesn't push for things to do. I kept trying to suggest he follow the path that our teacher and the welding Instructor, Dale, had set for me (and the rest of the welders). He wasn't having any of it. My suggestions fell on deaf ears. JR's entire family welds. He's convinced he's good at it already and going to master it next week when he visits them in Florida. His peer Matt, dumb as he is, is a much better welder than JR. Matt doesn't let on how much experience he has. He is a true southerner.

Luke did the tacking, and I did the fitting. Chris let me do the fitting since he realized I don't get as much practice as he does. We did make a mistake. Ultimately, it doesn't matter who hands me the pipe, I'm responsible as the fitter for everything. So, I made the mistake. I should have double-checked. It was a very easy mistake to fix though. They walked away while I did the grind work, and I switched it the other way. Boom, 3 minutes. 

The teacher had to leave early, so we had to clean up and leave early as well.

Also, my teacher said something odd at the end of the day. He asked me if I was going to show up next week because he said (I believe he said) he wouldn't be here. I'm not sure why. These were the student holidays we were to supposed to "make up" for (since we took off earlier last week when we weren't supposed to). Uhhh...Dereliction of duty, sir. He said it was fine if I came in, and he encouraged me to go to the welding class. I have to admit, I'm not sure if anyone is going to be there though since I assuming the welding class will be gone. Am I just straight up missing next week? That would be so weird. 

I should leave some tools out of the toolroom for myself. I need access to do things.

Also, I called up the Thompson number. It wasn't a direct line. I'm beginning to learn it never is.

Also, the sprinkler job is in Knoxville. =/ Might as well go Boilermakers at that. I'm going to hit up the plumbers in the area. I have plenty to learn, but I know my pipefitting will be useful to them.
