title: 2019.05.09 - Prompted Introspection: Special Place

!! Where is a special place you go to so you can be alone?

It used to be this wiki, but I'm not completely alone here anymore, lol. The obvious answer is my head. There's a sense in which I don't care where I physically am, as long my basic physical needs and comforts are met, thinking to myself is the special place I go to be alone. If I could give that up too, I would (and, I'm trying to). 

I feel lonely fairly often, despite the wonderful people in my life. I'm probably not nearly as connected as most people (at least partially my fault). The despair of loneliness is sometimes the [[right]] thing, even if it sucks. It is sad to see my mind deteriorating before my eyes (and I probably have little choice in the matter), so my special place can be a sad one in many cases. It's not all grim though. I still have a sense of [[hope]]. =)
