title: 2018.06.25 - Self-Dialectic: New

Represent my internalism in an externalized model.

I want to program my virtual machines from which my Daseinic self emerges using epicly powerful and utilitarian existential Virtualization-APIs of all kinds, Plan-9, Rust, Go, Python, Bash, Symbolic Logic, and Ithkuil. I need to be the best full-stack developer of my identity, from soup to nuts, the nitty gritty of hardware all the way to the nitty gritty of software. I must see the spectrum of computational, functional mapping between the infinite [[dok]] of hardware infinitesimals to the infinite [[dok]] of software infinitesimals. 

I need Rust for that safe, pre-optimized modeling, zero-cost abstractions, beautifully built from a SO metacognitive perspective with profound toolsets and community cooperation elements.

I need Go as an accurate, dummy-proof, reasonably fast and secure, language for prototyping my way to learning the radically different Rustic way to do it. It's a stepping-stone and a strong part of development without preoptimizing our language before we are ready for it.

I need Python because I need to leverage all the libraries! I need to be able to write idiomatically in pseudocode to myself.

How do I engage in self-dialectic as effectively as possible? How do I program myself as best as possible? The algorithmic usage of this wiki is effectively a gateway between myself and my self-made representation of myself (probably by several orders of thought).

I talked about contextualism, anti-luck (ghettier), and the fundamental internal/external problematic of philosophy found in debates in all fields. The rationalist modeler vs empiricist Daseinic perceiver. The self-dialectic of our verbal and quantitative narratives, our self-representations of ourselves to ourselves.

It's clear that being autist for me means that I'm exceptionally good at building certain kind of virtual machines to run in my brain. I can attend to the details of details in an empirical, externalist kind of reliable indicator in specific realms with a profoundness few possess (a double-edged sword that makes my models often wildly inaccurate!). My raw talent is spinning up experience machines of rich detail and internalist exactitude. Somehow, this feels externalist to me though. I can still see something without the rich models that some people have. I'm not sure how best to describe it computationally. 

My attention to the details in my Virtual Experience Machines is extremely high. I have a precision few possess, and deep-seated natural Bayesian tendancy that lends itself to certain contexts and is debilitating in others. I am good at being lost in that world. I live inside my own head with remarkable proficiency in some respects, even though I lack the metacognitive wisdom to be second-ordered about my identity, to be autonomous and exercise the right kind of executive functioning as neurotypicals do in some contexts.

Can I use my externalist standards of hedonic and eudaimonic happiness to train my fastmind to become increasingly virtuous, to literally become more virtuous as an internalist using externally recognized standards of reason?

I need to maximally lower the friction of my self-expression. I have to try to express the dense map of myself to myself. I need to make leaps of logic and then fill in the gaps; I must model harder than an autist generally does.

There is a way in which spinning up and entering virtual experience machines puts me into a ready-to-handed present-at-hand mode.
