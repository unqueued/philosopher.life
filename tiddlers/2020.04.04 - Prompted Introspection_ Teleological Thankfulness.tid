title: 2020.04.04 - Prompted Introspection: Teleological Thankfulness

!! What are you thankful for?

[[2018.07.03 - Prompted Introspection: Thankful]] and [[2019.12.31 - Prompted Introspection: Thankful]] point to crucial places for me. It's a [[good]] thing that my [[Be A Good Dad]], [[Be A Good Husband]], and [[FTO]] {[[axioms]]} also pick out what I'm thankful for in no small part. I'd like to be more specific and varied.

Despite a world which I see in crisis, I'm thankful there's still glimmers of radical [[hope]] available. I don't predict we'll use our freedom wisely, but I can see we could. It's not futile, nihilistic, pointless, purposeless, meaningless. I like that my [[Lifetime Projects]] are pointed at what I get to be thankful for.
