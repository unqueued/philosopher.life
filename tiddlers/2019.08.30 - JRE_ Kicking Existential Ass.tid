title: 2019.08.30 - JRE: Kicking Existential Ass

My brother got off early today, but he also had to show up insanely early. I'm thankful he finally got one night of good sleep; that's hard to do with a baby. He's having difficulty with people who are cop-apologists (as in: it's good they beat up that drunk guy), people who favor violence against babies of their enemies (can you imagine someone actually uttering the words "fuck that baby" and mean it?), and people who see the union as yet another hierarchy for the sake of egoistic ladder climbing. 

My brother is way too hard on himself too. He holds himself to this insane standard. So what if Rebecca and her mom (though not her sister) have an easier time getting the baby to hush? There are likely genetic and memetic factors outside his control here, and he does help that baby all the time. The sound of a baby crying drives me insane too, and I think my brother is far more rational and self-reflective than I was. He names his irrationality, and he's so constructive. I think my brother and Rebecca are taking care of a very difficult baby too: that child is addicted to meth. The child comes from a radically hard set of circumstances, and they are working miracles with that baby. It's stupid hard for all parties involved. My brother has a right to be frustrated, furious, and exhausted; he's handling it better than I could too. Like the sad philanthropist, my brother's actions have moral merit especially because he acts from duty rather than because he gets the warm fuzzies from doing it (which isn't to say emotional reward isn't a good thing, but it is not the fundamental factor in determining merit).

It's a hard time for him. I don't mean to diminish it at all. From where I stand, even though his circumstances might be taking it to him and getting powerful licks in, the man is kicking existential ass.
