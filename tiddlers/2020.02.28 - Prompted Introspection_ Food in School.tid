title: 2020.02.28 - Prompted Introspection: Food in School

!! Should junk food be banned from schools?

Healthy food in significant quantities at zero cost should be available. Tax the fuck out of junkfood. Teach kids to like nutritious foods, and make sure they pay nothing for it. This shouldn't just be my nation either. It is a crime against [[Humanity]] that we have undernourished children throughout the world (and we, the powerful, are the guilty).
