title: 2017.10.26 -- Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.10.25 -- /b/]]
** Something like that.
* [[Life of Fred: Kidneys (Intermediate Series)]]
** Excited and a bit scared. I hope I am kind and do a good job.
* [[2017.10.25 -- Apology Log]]
** Writing this helped me realize what I needed to do.
* [[2017.10.25 -- Yearly Audit Log]]
** Feels glacial to me, although that probably because I've spent much time on these pages before (although, it doesn't look like). 
* [[Lost Dreams of {Focus}]]
** Maybe the wrong title?
* [[2017.10.25 -- Link Log]]
** Edited a grammar-thing
* [[2017.10.25 -- Prompted Introspection Log]]
** That is harsh. But, it is important to be honest. It's the only way we can improve.
* [[2017.10.25 -- To-Do-List Log]]
** No Cannabliss
* [[2017.10.25 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** It's like I forgot about the [[Apology Log]]. I worry there are too many moving parts on this wiki sometimes. But, I think I just need to give it time. 
* [[2017.10.25 -- Carpe Diem Log]]
** Edited and filled it out.
