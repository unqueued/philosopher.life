!! If I could change one thing about my spouse/lover, what would I change?

Now //this// question is what I'm talking about! Fuck yeah. [[2018.06.25 - Prompted Introspection: Spouse Adjustment]] is hilarious. 

Okay, it's weird that I have actually turned down sex more in the past year than I ever have. That's crazy. Does this prompt actually work? She's not an ace, but tends toward it. She clearly loves me when she so generously gives it to me in asking me to give it to her. Of course, I'm the one that can barely refrain from reaching to hug her and then grab her ass every single time. It's obsessive. She goes out of her way to help me with my skinhunger and horniness. 

Okay, it's also weird that she has been taking her wiki far more seriously these past two years. Seriously, does this prompt actually work? We've been building as a family together, integrating the tool into our lives. I'm grateful that she takes the time to systematically engage in it with us.

Hrm. I'm surprised by this prompt, even if it is epiphenomenal.

Okay, so I will shoot for another. Let's go for the big one:

I would want to limit some of the stresses in her life. I don't know what in particular to change though (which is fine, right?). I'd want her to get back to sleeping like we did in our 20's. I don't want her to fear living in the ghetto, going hungry again and again, fighting in a dog-eat-dog world to survive, living and suffering needlessly in pure chaos, or any other k0shiqua-inducing caged-animal events. I'd want her to feel free, fulfilled, and somehow able to reconcile a world in crisis with her purposefulness in a peaceful manner. I want my wife to be at peace. I don't know how to do that wisely enough.
