Hey [[Kicks]],

We reach yet another interesting place in our relationship! Deny the cards all you want; it probably doesn't matter. You give us your offline voice, and I feel happily obligated to reciprocate. Here you go, homie.

Of course, we prefer no other human saw it, but that is up to you.

[[Love]],
