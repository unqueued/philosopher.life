title: 2018.05.15 - Polymath Craftsman: Liar

Contradicting what he said yesterday, and last week, and from the first day we started this job, I asked Colton point blank: "We're doing one a day now, right?" in front of everyone this morning. His response, "No." He said nothing else. He's clearly lied to us.

He must have felt bad partially because he said to not work too fast an hour later. He's completely full of shit.

We did two lights quickly. We left a third for after lunch. Have I mentioned that Colton is a liar? 

Speedy Gonzalez meal again. I'm enjoying the protein and AC.

I wish I had the ability to just believe my darker gut instincts about people. I think I would have been less disappointed and angry. In either case, I may be pissed. Knowingly being led around by a charlatan is also degrading.

It started raining, and we finished off most of the 3rd. I'm playing slow the entire time. Nice part of being a CW is how little accountability I have.
