title: 2018.10.21 - Prompted Introspection: Arctic Climate

!! How would handle life in an arctic climate?

Probably better than most because I prefer to spend my time indoors. I'm a hermit. I live in my living room whenever I can. Presumably, for me to survive in the arctic, I'd have all the necessities. Presumably, my family would be with me. That would be a fascinating experience for us. My wife would absolutely despise aspects of it! I think my children would find it boring. I think we would do well enough though since we spend a ton of time engaged in activities which don't require us to be outside. I would not prefer the arctic, except insofar as we might have security.
