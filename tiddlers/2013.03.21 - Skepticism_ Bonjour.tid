Legacy of Skepticism – Clark



754

Is the skeptic examining our fundamental beliefs or about our empirical knowledge which comes after those fundamental beliefs?

What do these reflections reveal?

Start with Humean skepticism of our fundamental beliefs “outside our studies”

Is Moore's defense/proof rational and effectual or impotently dogmatic? The everyday domain being immune to skepticism.



755

The domain of instances of “plain questions.” Skepticism is ineffectual against plain questions. “Implained” skepticism can't overcome the context, and it must “change the subject” to get anywhere.

CS = Common sense (general propositions...??)

Dreamland and Lilliputian Skeptic....Meta-CS is not really Moore at all.



756

How broad of the dimensions of the circle of the plain?

Physiologist lecturing on mental abnormalities…example.

Twin propositions point out the ultimate logical sin, “’propositions’ outside contextual wedlock…’language on a holiday’”

Plain language is something we need to be cautious about using as epistemologists.



758

Moore is right if there is nothing beyond the plain.

“Are there material objects?” and “Can we know that there are material objects?” and “Can we ever know that we’re not dreaming?” are philosophic rather than plain.

Sopoforic’s example
