title: 2017.06.19 - Pipefitting Log

Today was difficult. We covered "Aboveground Pipefitting," which Luke pointed out was ironic since that should be damn near everything. I did learn a lot though. I feel much more comfortable in the realm of flanges and gaskets. I studied all day for it, and I didn't take the exam until the very end. I knew I didn't do well; there were many that I had to guess on. Still, I got an 85%. That is miles better than failing. 

Luke was told to do 1.5" Socket weld for the simulator. I don't understand why. I'm not going to question my teacher on it though, as he seemed testy about it. I will think about why though. He spent all day just trying to map out the simulator onto an isometric drawing. Also, I learned what the fabrications are called when you do them in stages: spools. He didn't even draw out the spools, it was just the simulator. It took him all day. That was a 2-hour job at max, and I even helped him with the top measurements. 

I was told to show JR how to do two-holes. So, I did. Screwpipe is easy once you understand the need to get it right the first time (i.e. tighten it as you go). JR and Matt are now separated since JR is obviously much more intelligent in some respects (although, still an arrogant young fool like me ;P). 

After work, I went to Kingsport to speak with Jacobs. They said the positions were already filled. =( The lady at the front desk was unimpressed with my half year of experience (as she should be). But, she said she would pass a message along for me. I said I thought I was a unique candidate, and that I would be worth their time. We'll see. I talked to TEC too. I have a number to call tomorrow. They don't have anything immediately open either. =(...

But, that is okay! These are mere roadblocks and barriers. I will sit in EC tunnel until I sell my Cloak of Flames for what it is worth.
