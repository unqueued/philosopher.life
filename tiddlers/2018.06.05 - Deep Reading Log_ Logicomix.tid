Jesus. This book has turned gut-wrenching to me. I see myself doing the same thing that is literally driving them crazy! Yikes! Can I do it more wisely? Ought I even go down this path? Do I even have a choice? What would it even //mean// to not engage in it? I fear this is all I have left, the only option. I am trying to hold it together, lol!
