title: 2018.08.14 -- Sho: Ed

Sho and I will probably be leaving messages for each other over Signal. She types very quickly, and is very good at dumping out her thoughts instantly. I think I can type as fast as she does when I know what I want to say. I don't normally know what I want to say though.

I was invited to their blog. I talked about it with her. 

I also may have upset Ed with my openness and straightforward approach. We'll see if and how he responds.
