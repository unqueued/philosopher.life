!! Audit:

* I missed a few days toward the end, but I also had a couple days with multiples.
* I can feel the difference in my Chromium Extensions.
** I need to continue evolving this toolset. There are a lot of hacks here.
* The texthacks have been a stand-in for i3/xdotool/AHK approaches for now. I can see I have a lot of room to grow in that area.
** Now that I've split off the development environment from the final product, I have a kind of degree of freedom that is hard to fathom.
* Bob has been a bitch to wrestle. It's not performant, it has bugs, and there are lots of gotchas.
** But multiple tabs and editing from multiple computers simultaneously is just that fucking powerful.
* This log is frenzied.
* I feel so slow when I see this. Yeah, I got a shit ton done in a month, but I didn't get nearly as much as I'd have liked in that timeframe.
** There are people that spend far less time and seem so much more productive. Yeah, well, I'm stoopid sometimes, lol. =)
*** Compare yourself to yourself. Just make the best version of you that you can, homie.
* You know, I could look at this like I have too much on my plate, but I can also just celebrate that I have a plan and things to do. I'm grateful to have any foresight at all on this wiki.
** Think about how many times you've looked back and wished you had a plan.
