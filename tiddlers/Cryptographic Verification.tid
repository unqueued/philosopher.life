!! About:

//Even when we don't have the moral right to say just anything, we must always enable and maintain the political right to free speech, especially for our enemies and outgroups. Speak and sign digital Navajo, decentralize information power, securely communicate with [[others]], own your voices and minds insofar as you ought, and exercise your political rights or you will lose them. This political action page exists for those cornercases...//<<ref "ir">>

Like any tool, cryptography can be instrumentally used for good or evil ends. Cryptography provides us the means to semi-automatically generate particular kinds of trust, and it must radically serve as part of the foundational digital infrastructure we use to construct and maintain our [[T42T]] relationships in the digital age. Our moral (though obviously not current political) rights to anonymity and privacy scale with the power differentials between political adversaries. Information advantages must always benefit those at the bottom.<<ref "ia">> All else being equal, as a matter of [[The Golden Rule]], those with power must be radically transparent before those who have none, and those who have no power have the moral right to protect their information from the centralization of power.<<ref "ult">>

Applied appropriately, cryptography acts as a pre-emptively enforced cluster of Hohfeldian rights against your loved ones, friends, anons, skiddies, blackhats, dark-triads, transnational corporations, Big Brother, Capitalists, Peter Thiel, le ilerminaty, aliens,<<ref "al">> and a remarkable number of legitimate adversaries, which at times may even include ourselves.<<ref "st">> It is your moral obligation to own your data and effectively decentralize power [[irwartfrr]]! The workers must own the means of production; we must equalize asymmetrical information power dynamics as best we can. You owe Humanity a profound contribution to and participation in an information system meant to serve those who need it most.<<ref "f">> Using cryptography correctly is a realpolitik behavioral vote for the decentralization of power.

Official distributions of h0p3's Wiki include a [[Real-Time Embedded Wiki Signature]] for verifying the integrity and authenticity of your copy. The hash and signature of that hash are injected into that tiddler for every published edit. 

I previously used PGP (GnuPG as my last tool) to sign this wiki. PGP has to be one of the worst "best in class" toolsets I've ever used. It doesn't "just work," and it desperately needs to. Instead, I'm attempting to cut out the middleman to more directly use the crypto library I actually trust. I generate signatures through [[PyNaCL|https://github.com/pyca/pynacl]], a gorgeous binding to the state of the art [[NaCL|https://nacl.cr.yp.to/]] crypto library.<<ref "2">> I believe my key will be useful until quantum computing becomes feasible.<<ref"3">> PGP buys the same verification as my process. The difference is that my process is literally programmable in every major language. It ain't pretty, and it might even be awful, but it works.<<ref "ps">>

!! Principles:

* Continually improve this process.
* Build tools which maintain fitting degrees of privacy, anonymity, authenticity, and integrity in my context.
* Enable surprising portability, decentrality, and distributivity.

!! Focus:

* [[Real-Time Embedded Wiki Signature]]
* [[Master Ed25519 Public Key]] for h0p3's Wiki:<<ref "mk">>
** 5b0addf64aa52a67ac9c59031e7c15919717df39146c2d995f7f0745a2fc8fe2
* Current Slave Ed25519 Public Key for h0p3's Wiki: 
** 5249578e4cdfaec1484f0083df3e8b6e4af0cab0288c8156c31d6e94efe58308

Authentication is fairly straightforward. Download a copy of the wiki, and make sure the filename is `index.html` (or modify the script). Create and run [[the following script|embedded-sig-verify.py]] in the same directory as the html file.<<ref "nacl">>

{{embedded-sig-verify.py}}

To be clear, you're going to have to initially trust the public key is h0p3's to begin with.<<ref "tt">> Further, if you trust the signature verification of the checksum, and you trust the checksum of index.html (if the hashes match, you should), then you trust index.html. Thus, this authenticity+integrity verification process demonstrates you possess a bit-for-bit copy of the original signed by someone who possesses h0p3's private signing key.

Please note the key used to sign this wiki is obviously sitting on my hard drive. I can never guarantee I'm clean or that someone else doesn't possess the current slave private_key. Hence, I have introduced the [[Master Ed25519 Public Key]] to afford myself the opportunity to semi-conveniently revoke (and create) this wiki's current slave key from scratch in an emergency on a clean box.

Because of the way Tiddlywiki's node.js server compiles this .html file, downloading from a web server will not provide a bit-for-bit copy.<<ref "per">> [[My daughter|j3d1h]] and I are working on that. For now, use resilio, git, or a direct download method.
