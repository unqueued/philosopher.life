I have a tattoo the  algebraic function of a verticle asymptote. Specifically a function that has the answer = -∞.  This equation, and the idea of the answer itself is a symbol of the neverending quest for all things emotional and mental. It is as if the closer to these answers I get the further away I remain. That does not mean I have not, or will not make the attempts. But Funny enough.

The idea of chasing an end, but never actually obtaining it. Chasing an answer, to never hear it, racing towards a feeling of happiness that exists, but you will never reach it.

Due to the infinite and contradictory reflections in my own self.

I love your tattoo. =)

I understand many people would find this talk to be pointless or even woo. I do not.

I am cautious around the word infinite. I think we are finite creatures trying to understand [[The Infinite]].
