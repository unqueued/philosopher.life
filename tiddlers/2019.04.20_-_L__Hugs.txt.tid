We’re working on it. And by we I mean [[K]] and mom are out shopping at the moment. I hate grocery shopping so I opted to stay home and chill with dad and [[AG]].

I successfully avoided shopping today as well. It is magic.

Those floors and the paint are looking pretty awesome, eh?

It is!

Mom and I definitely have similar tastes. The gray makes me happy.

It’s cool to watch them peel back the layers of this house and slowly make it better.

Aye. They have worked very hard these many weeks.
SAT 3:06 PM
It’s definitely paying off. That little room has really come together. \o/

It makes me happy that my old room is a library now. Probably the best thing they could have turned it into.

Truly a gift.

Those floors are especially pimp. Perfect color.
