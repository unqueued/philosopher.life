title: 2020.04.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Where Are The Angels?

* Woke at 10
** Gorgeous sleep.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Walked and talked with myself.
** Lots of thinking about the world. Fuck.
* Encouraged my offspring. Much easier when it's not my topics.
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** We had a leisurely and more wandering talk today.
** Talked with me about his [[vidya]]. Dark Souls 3. 
*** He's trying to mod it, but having some troubles.
*** He thinks he cheeses games, but I think he's just finding the correct way to play them in his shoes.
**** He had fun while accomplishing le objectives. Seems hard to beat.
** 3 weeks until scope
** Keto diet has been okay for now.
** Talked about sommeliers, tools, etc.
* Omg...I have a favorite holiday. I never realized it. I have turned into one of them.\
* Dialectures!
* Shopping
** Even more rules now. Interesting seeing the adjustments.
** We have apples. =)
** I'm still fogging up my glasses. 
** I did not see any angels around. They seem to be getting scarcer. I do not understand what is happening.
*** There are still tons of pigs out though.
* Organization
* Walk with wife
** Bliss. Best part of the day (sorry, [[monster]]).
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Pizza, salad
** //Dominion//, my son decided not to troll us tonight. Markets, Workshops, Gardens, and I was the one who decided to end the game.
*** I think my daughter isn't enjoying it so much. Hrm. What game would she love to play?
* Talked with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
** He had to work a 12 to deliver. 
** My phone or the connection wasn't working great; will find solution someday. 
** He explained the difference between the Art Director and Director. 
*** Reminds me of various kinds of requirements for programming. 
*** He wears a lot of different hats.
*** He made a strong point about the writer's guild (he motioned toward before). 
*** My gut still feels the pull of the Art Director doing quite a bit of the Director's work, overlap, etc. 
**** As usual, I am missing a piece in my brain.
** He's been helping a guy who is self-destructing hook up with more folks to talk with. 
*** Seems exceptionally important with so much social distance.
** Married life is kicking ass for him. 
*** Like a pure honeymoon for them.
**** Part of what is wonderful is the simplicity.
*** He asked me about my first year.  
** Cups came in. 
*** I'm glad they'll be using my macaroni art (which I like) to drink with; it will serve a practical purpose. 
** He's been sharing food and getting to know his neighbors.
** He asked me to consider having a time where people can just come to the house, like a house church. 
*** It's a good idea. I want to have real relationships with my neighbors. [[Tasha]]'s family has probably been the most successful mutual neighboring I've had in a long time.
** We talked about my worries, paranoia, and pessimism. 
** Selah has not been able to work with her students because schools are closed. 
*** Some parents are in over their heads without her.
* [[vidya]]: Priest. We have to pause every 15 seconds to fucking talk about it, lol. 
** Never did get to Sapolsky.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]: I did what I could with what I had. Sad.
** I think they appreciated it.
* [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]: [[Epistemic Paradoxes]] pomos (limited)
* [[vidya]]: Tiktok with my offspring.
** They have noticed the amount of wealth in many of the vidyas.
** Thank the lawd for Reddit's curation.

* Fireman Time!
