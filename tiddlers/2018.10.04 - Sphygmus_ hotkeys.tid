title: 2018.10.04 - Sphygmus: hotkeys

just popping in to say - I'm watching your wiki auditing with interest! Crib as much or as little of the flexbox stuff from my site as you want. :)

I keep struggling with wanting to link to or transclude specific sections of tiddlers, and the resounding answer from the google group and github being "put it in its own tidder."

(see, I usually have one "Log" tiddler going each day that's my scratchpad for to-dos, random thoughts, just anything that I feel like writing about that day. In addition to the carpe diem and wiki review logs I've been keeping. So I want to pull threads out of the daily scratchpad logs, but I also want to preserve the context of the train of thought that day...but maybe that's what snapshots are for...)

anyway hotkeys! for some reason, they don't work if the editor toolbar is hidden, only when it's visible. I'm guessing that's what's happening for you here!

cheers, sphygmus
