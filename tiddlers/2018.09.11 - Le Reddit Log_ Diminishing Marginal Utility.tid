title: 2018.09.11 - Le Reddit Log: Diminishing Marginal Utility

I'm glad you are making some important arguments here. I want to add to it. First, it's not just "easier;" there are other utility generating considerations of money (some of which are just as "difficult"). You may be interested to consider that the current average "line" for diminishing marginal utility is ~115k annual income in the US (of course, context matters). Building your own wealth to about ~4 million, living off the interest, and spending your "retirement" on vocation appears to be the current softlimit of where wealth and income clearly benefit average Americans. There are, of course, utility monsters and people who can literally generate more happiness through money (but, again, they aren't the average). I think it's important to see that this amount of income and wealth makes someone upperclass (I hope you aren't implying otherwise).

Happiness, imho, is not sufficiently reducible to hedonic utility, although I consider it necessary.
