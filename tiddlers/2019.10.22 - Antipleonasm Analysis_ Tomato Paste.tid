title: 2019.10.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Tomato Paste

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad. Philosophy is wondering if that means ketchup is a smoothie.

Nuh uh: that's just, like, your opinion man. Damn, I adore this quote.

Wisdom picks out what is [[salient]] in what can be perceived (though even Daseinic perception of anything at all is a special case), including separating knowledge from less justified belief. Note, of course, that wisdom is deeply concerned with relating our beliefs with our desires [[irwartfrr]]. Knowledge cannot be acquired without intentionality, and insofar as there is a [[good]] of a practice and a teleological being toward which (with a means to ends relationship), desire (and hence wisdom) relationships are necessary to knowledge. Some kinds of knowledge aren't relevant enough to be worth acquisition, but it may be better than nothing prima facie (though we can throw up consequentialist failures). 

So far, I think that example of wisdom is radically practical, to the point of misunderstanding the necessity of theoretical wisdom. It's crucial to see that even knowing a tomato is a fruit is also philosophical. There is nothing that can be experienced, desired, or known which isn't philosophical. However, some problems are more fundamental and [[salient]] than others, and I think it's fair to say they are more philosophical. 

Unfortunately, I have no idea how to speak of this as a virtue spectrum. Perhaps:

`Practical-------------Ideal-------------Esoteric`

Ugh. These aren't the right words either. Yeah, it's a damned hard problem. Of course, plenty of people will consider that definition of philosophy to point to the esoteric. As always, it depends on the context.
