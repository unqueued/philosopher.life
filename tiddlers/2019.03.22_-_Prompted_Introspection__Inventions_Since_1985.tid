title: 2019.03.22 - Prompted Introspection: Inventions Since 1985

!! What are some major inventions that happened during your life time?

I'm not quite sure what counts as an invention. The lines are blurry for me, though I can tell you that discovery is always an appropriate term.<<ref "p">> Unfortunately, I'm also blurry on discovery in [[dok]], but I just don't know how to do conceptual analysis all the way down. Alright, with some of my caveats out of the way, I'll give some more standard looking answers.

Multi-threaded programming and hardware came alive. Strong forms of virtualization, mobile computing, and the hatching of The Internet especially. Computers start eating the world, integrating into our cybernetic identities beyond our imaginations. Quantum computing, ML, and Orwellian surveillance are infecting everything. Computing has to be the largest portion of the list. GAI is coming; it is known by even the commoners. 

The acceleration of change is unprecedented. Globalization and deglobalization contractions in the material and memetic dialectics are mind-boggling. Postmodernism continues to sweep through us as the largest human pyramid in existence is assembled through near-perfect competition. 

China rises. The EU obtains. Power centralizes into transnational elites among oligarchic regions. The contradictions build. Golem gathers. Will [[Humanity]] be able to answer the crisis that will bring an end to the anthropocene era? Stay tuned.
