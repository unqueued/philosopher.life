!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Unhappy events abroad have re-taught us two simple truths about the liberty of a democratic people.

The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State itself. That, in its essence, is fascism -ownership of government by an individual, by a group or by any other controlling private power.

The second truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if its business system does not provide employment and produce and distribute goods in such a way as to sustain an acceptable standard of living.

Preach, yo! It's not just abroad, and transnational power is even more infectious (they obey no rule of law). Somehow the centralization of power becomes even more dangerous when we accelerate it with modern technology.

It turns out that an acceptable standard of living is contextual, relative to others, part of how we collectively cooperate, and about maximizing the minimum. Teddy might not fully recognize that. I can see some Neolib interpretations or dog-whistling made possible with the quote as it stands. I think the spirit of the claim is pretty obviously socialist.
