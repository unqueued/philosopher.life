I'm worried this book won't be all that much different from the last one. It is interesting to me that this professor would write this book given his employer. It is ballsy.

!! Introduction: Popular Paperbacks and the Transformation of American Liberalism

The readability/generalization is not scientific at all, but I think it's an interesting lens. I'm not sure we agree on what counts as mass media this point either.

1972 McGovern commission, anti-labor unionism and Business Roundtable

Umm...I fear you are not nearly charitable enough to how we can and should interpret Kant. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know Nozick viciously abuses deontology. Kant is exactly what solves this problem for us. He is giving us a computational model of [[The Golden Rule]]! Liberalism merely pays lip service to such a thing; they bow to Kant only to appear legitimate. Your last footnote on Kant suggests you are open to a different interpretation. 

I appreciate the disclaimer on your target and what you hope to achieve. I may not think it's the most crucial aspect of this, but I think you offer us another tool. It is one of many to help us see this OOO elephant.

!! The Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic of Mass-Market Fiction

I think you rely upon a kind of weak Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis.

You are correct that the consolidation of the media is a fundamental component (and kind) of the centralization of power. I think we don't necessary assent to such a thing just by consuming from that tit though, although it may often color our perceptions out of the gate.
