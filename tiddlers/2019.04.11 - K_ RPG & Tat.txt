THU 9:16 AM
Thanks! You as wel
THU 9:37 AM
Well
THU 9:37 AM
Here's the link to my final project: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ABa1hu48XD3BALmVaPzPSS1gkV-a3Up9
THU 8:40 PM
It's really not worth playing, lol.
THU 8:41 PM
Also- I aced that Fight Club paper! But she wishes I talked about schizophrenia more in reference to Capitalism, but an A's an A.... How are you?
THU 8:41 PM
Yay!
THU 8:48 PM
Firing up my VM now
THU 8:50 PM
I am embarrassed to have my name on it.
THU 8:50 PM
But it got me an A
THU 8:51 PM
A is an A.
THU 8:51 PM
Neat.
THU 8:58 PM
Yeah it's cute isn't it?
THU 8:59 PM
It is. I bet your teacher has never received anything like it.
THU 8:59 PM
She's really excited to see it on the projector hahaha
THU 8:59 PM
Perfect time to easter egg the class
THU 9:00 PM
Man I really wanted to include secrets, but that sounds like extra work.
THU 9:01 PM
Sidenote: RPGMaker MV is a GREAT program.
THU 9:01 PM
Lol. yeah.
THU 9:01 PM
This job sounds absolutely awful to me, but have you looked into whatever it takes to build the pulpy fiction/lore for vidya games?
THU 9:12 PM
The problem is, I would only be happy working for Square Enix and it's pretty much unattainable.
THU 9:13 PM
Lol.
THU 9:13 PM
I'd rather be an author anyway.
THU 9:13 PM
;)
THU 9:13 PM
Aye. Plus, lot of the vidya game companies suck.
THU 9:14 PM
I've had a good day. Been busy. Having trouble with my server I bought...it's crazy loud.
THU 9:15 PM
It's more about the politics and money than the integrity of telling a story.
THU 9:15 PM
Awwwwww
THU 9:15 PM
Maybe it needs some cleaning?
THU 9:15 PM
new fans?
THU 9:15 PM
Nope. It's crystal clear. I've never owned a blade server before. This model, even after updates, is known for running it's modular fans at 100%. It's meant for a datacenter, not a home.
THU 9:16 PM
Also, I wrote something silly while drunk, but it is not for faint of heart: https://philosopher.life/#Boogerpicking
THU 9:16 PM
Maybe you could sound proof a small alcove?
THU 9:16 PM
Oh shit- I'm excited
THU 9:16 PM
I'm 90% sure I'm drilling a hole through the wall to the little shed out back. The problem is you can hear it through the walls outside, and I don't want maintenance or some person thinking I've got a meth lab or who knows what in there.
THU 9:17 PM
Will attempt to soundproof.
THU 9:17 PM
The hacks the hardware are ugly. I just don't want to give up on it though.
THU 9:18 PM
As a chronic nose masturbater, I approve of your post, lmao
THU 9:19 PM
Good idea!
THU 9:19 PM
Lol
THU 9:19 PM
Look, boogers are uncomfortable.
THU 9:19 PM
Get that shit out
THU 9:19 PM
haha
THU 9:19 PM
Preach, lol.
THU 9:19 PM
I'm almost two drinks into this new paper, I'm sorry.
THU 9:19 PM
Sometimes it's the best way to write.
THU 9:20 PM
It's not working well for me. xD
THU 9:20 PM
Opening paragraph was strong, but now i'm floundering.
THU 9:20 PM
