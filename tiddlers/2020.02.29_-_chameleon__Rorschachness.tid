title: 2020.02.29 - chameleon: Rorschachness

"""
[10:39 PM]  chameleon: Noticed you watched the Watchmen show
[10:39 PM]  chameleon: wondering if it's worth it
[10:39 PM]  chameleon: have you read the original comic?
[10:39 PM]  h0p3: Yes. Fan of it. Sitting on my toilet right now.
[10:39 PM]  h0p3: Show is not awful.
[10:39 PM]  chameleon: tfw both talking like rorschach
[10:39 PM]  h0p3: Just doesn't stick for me.
[10:40 PM]  h0p3: :slight_smile:
[10:40 PM]  chameleon: I actually adopted his speech pattern for an RPG character, though she's not much like him
[10:40 PM]  h0p3: I'm not a fan of the way in which rorschach is portrayed in the show.
[10:40 PM]  chameleon: I thought for her it could get across that she struggles to communicate what's going on inside, she's smarter than she can express, etc.
[10:41 PM]  h0p3: Certainly makes for an interesting RPG kind of injection, template, or model
[10:41 PM]  chameleon: I watched the a-S-x video about it, he's been taken up as a symbol by white supremacists, right?
[10:41 PM]  chameleon: in the show's canon
[10:41 PM]  h0p3: Aye. It's a far more negative portrayal.
[10:43 PM]  h0p3: You have a good day?
[10:44 PM]  chameleon: yeah, pretty good! we had some bbq and sorted out the latest (hopefully last) round of paperwork
[10:44 PM]  h0p3: Delicious and productive. Noice.
[10:44 PM]  h0p3: May it be smooth sailing for you.
[10:44 PM]  chameleon: the deadline is april 20th (nice) but we got it done early :slight_smile:
[10:44 PM]  h0p3: ;P
[10:45 PM]  h0p3: I still need to get taxes done here.
[10:45 PM]  chameleon: that's one last thing I have to do; I got my p45 back from my former employer, so I need to get my UK tax returns done
[10:47 PM]  h0p3: hopefully you did overpay and you get some money back, eh?
[10:48 PM]  chameleon: almost definitely, since my tax situation was very simple
[10:48 PM]  chameleon: I was paying PAYE, and according to my father they charge you tax on your income as if you'll work for six months
[10:49 PM]  chameleon: *a year, not six months
[10:50 PM]  chameleon: so I will have overpaid by a lot since I only worked six months of the tax year, if that
