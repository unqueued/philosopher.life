title: 2017.07.25 -- Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.07.24 -- Link Log]]
** I had many philosophical links backed up. I must admit, I don't feel like I have time to be careful, methodical, and academic about philosophy now'n'days. I have to rely upon my gut (which I often did anyways), and I have to make more blink of an eye guestimations and quick perception checks.
*** Utimately, that means I can't fulfill my philosophical vocation as well as I'd like. Perhaps it is just a season of life.

** This won't be nearly as much of a problem once I can tether with 4G. It's been many years since I've needed to do that. I'm so used to working with wifi up at all times.

** Edited.

** No, it's not a bad thing. Go for it.

** I must admit, the log feels short. That's okay though, right?
* [[2017.07.23 -- Prompted Introspection Log]]
** That said, I'm still not cool enough with my black friends to drop N-bombs, clearly.

** Well, the car is now having trouble. /fingers-crossed
