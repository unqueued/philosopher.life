title: 2017.03.01 -- Pipefitting Log

Chris works hard. I admire it. I appreciate it. He realizes I'm waiting on him to catch up, and he's even apologetic about it (I tell him it isn't his fault, and I do not make a big deal about it). My partners weren't convinced we were off on our 6-piece-90. It was. I then explained how I wanted to fix it (went through the options with them). Grinding discouraged them greatly. I wasn't going to give up though. I continued, and I fixed it. They were surprised it worked. Regardless, I was happy about getting it done.

Afterwards, I was assigned to teach Chris the 3-piece-90. He did a good job. Then we moved to a 4-piece-90. He's still working on it. I'll help him with grinding on this one. 

I adore grinding. It is a form of sculpting. I like to sculpt.

I also asked if I could learn to weld and work on personal projects on Thursdays. My teacher happily agreed. Yay!
