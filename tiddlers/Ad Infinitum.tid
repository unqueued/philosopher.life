title: Ad Infinitum

<<<
An infinite regress in a series of propositions arises if the truth of proposition P,,1,, requires the support of proposition P,,2,,, the truth of proposition P,,2,, requires the support of proposition P,,3,,, ... , and the truth of proposition P,,n,,âˆ’,,1,, requires the support of proposition P,,n,, and n approaches infinity.

Distinction is made between infinite regresses that are "vicious" and those that are not.

How do you know when an infinite regress is vicious? I think it would be hilarious if the answer itself boiled down to an infinite regress. It may require formal question begging.
