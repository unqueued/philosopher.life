!! CHAPTER 1 - ALTARS AGAINST GOD - Ravi Zacharias

Altars against your particular version of the Christian God, right? I suggest you must argue against not only atheists, but also agnostics, deists, spiritualists, metaphysicians, non-Christian theists, and even plenty of other Christian sects throughout history which may oppose non-trivial components of your arguments.

<<<
...asked what on earth I meant by the term God...I suspected the question was both hostile and intentional
<<<

One should ask for definitions in dialectics. Here's the ever-evolving primary thrust of mine: [[The Good]]. Obviously I don't think this is an easy problem to solve. I suspect the way you've phrased this is also hostile and intentional rhetoric. See? The actual argument founded on our definitions is all we have to convince others in a way that respects their personhood. Will you provide us a good definition to wrestle with? Are you open to the possibility your definition is wrong or that what you've defined does not exist?

<<<
I asked him what he was denying.
<<<

This appears to be a rhetorical tactic. It is your job in the dialectic to give your definition of your beliefs first, and it's your opponent's job to be able to reiterate it back to you as a steelman that you can agree to. That's not what the above line of reasoning is meant to achieve.

I feel the pain of this issue. Construction is always way harder than deconstruction. You have to have something built before you can tear it down, though. 

<<<
It is fascinating to talk to a strident atheist and try to get beneath the anger or hostility.
<<<

Do I get to say a similar line about Christians? I find this remark not only unnecessary but hypocritically holier-than-thou. I would know. I've been a hypocrite here.

Let's be clear, when I walked into a church as a Christian, I generally found about 2% of them were legitimate believers. My low opinion of Christians (and humans in general) isn't new. To be fair, I've literally increased that amount to 3% since losing my Christian faith. It's remarkably difficult to get beneath the hostility of many Christians as well.

I think this line is meant to virtue signal to particular Christian tribes who rely upon and are exceptionally open to emotional persuasion. It leaves room for the "not all atheists," while intending to push people to unconsciously assume the opposite.

<<<
God is a trigger word for some that concentrates all his or her stored animosity into a projectile of words.
<<<

Seems like God is a trigger word for anyone who understands the concept, theist or atheist. Are you sure this isn't undue ad hominem? If you replaced the word "God" with "Atheism" here, it might be applied to you.

<<<
But as the layers of their thinking and experience are unpacked, the meaning of atheism to each one becomes narrower and narrower, each term dying the death of a thousand qualifications
<<<

That's what unpacking meaning is like. When you use an adjective to describe God, you've "boxed" God in. This narrowing happens to theism just as much as it does to atheism. You don't get to just help yourself to the emotional claim of "death of a thousand qualifications" when you have the same problem. This is a dishonest way to understand the process. It reminds me of those who offer spurious dismissals like "they are just playing semantics" or "they are splitting hairs," etc. That's exactly when you should be most suspicious. Integrity is about being willing to walk you all the way down to the bottom to the best of one's abilities.

<<<
Oftentimes, the description is more visceral and is discussed with pent-up anger rather than in a sensible, respectful discussion.
<<<

Agreed. I suggest you're failing here in the first two paragraphs at this very task.

<<<
More than once I have been amazed at the anger expressed by members of the atheist groups at one or other of the Ivy League schools in the United States to which I have been invited to speak, anger that I was even invited and that I had the temerity to address them.
<<<

Of course, malice can be expressed in emotions beyond anger. I fear you're engaging in rhetoric right now. 

This also may be an anti-intellectual dogwhistle, even setting aside the controversy surrounding your claimed and implied credentials.

<<<
And, dare I say, had I been a Muslim speaker, there would have been no such dissent as I faced.
<<<

You probably shouldn't dare. Let's be clear, a non-trivial percentage of professors are openly Christian. They also don't own a corporation that pulled in $27mill last year through speaking engagements either. Your opening lines are crafted to show you are persecuted because you are Christian. This is patently false. I've had several Muslim professors as well, and they had to tiptoe far more than the Christians I've met.

I've studied theology, biblical exegesis, and philosophy of religion in many classes. We've had honored religious guest speakers, symposiums, conferences, etc. of people of many faiths (most of them Christian, at my schools). 

When I was a Christian, I don't think I was treated disrespectfully. I've had two professors I've had major beefs with; one a biblical studies teacher from Harvard and another an atheist logician from Cornell. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to wrestle with both men.

Perhaps it depends far more upon the kind of speaker, their message, and their motivations. If this is the kind of argumentation you provide, which boils down to rhetoric, I can see why you've been dismissed.

<<<
Evidently, being able to instill fear in people has a lot to do with how much freedom of speech you are granted.
<<<

Yikes. This isn't even trying to be objective about Islam at all. It isn't even trying to be charitable. This is pure rhetoric and idealogy. 

<<<
But alas! For some, at least, civil discourse is impossible.
<<<

You are proving that right now. I will hold you to the same tone-policing standard here.

Let me also voice my concern about those in power (and you most certainly are wealthy while also wielding a powerful voice over many fundies) calling for civility. It is often used as a weapon to silence others without due process or justification. 

<<<
To her credit, at the end of a lecture, one senior officer in one club stood up and thanked me, a veiled apology for the resistance vented before the event. I did appreciate that courtesy.
<<<

Woe is you, millionaire, getting paid to "preach." I'm Straussianly charitable at this point. I think your work is realpolitik rather than academic.

<<<
This unfettered anger on the part of some is quite puzzling to me...I never recall feeling any anger or hostility toward those who believed differently than me, no matter how ludicrous their beliefs may have seemed to me.
<<<

Is it puzzling? Your argument appears to be thinly veiled anger to me. The use of rhetoric instead of argumentation is obvious. I think this is meant to confirm bias, not convince the opposition with reason. Ultimately, this is a false virtue signal.

<<<
But the likes of Richard Dawkins are renowned for their bullying and mocking approach toward opposing views, an attitude from an academic that makes one wonder what is really driving such an intense temperament.
<<<

You are falling short of the same standard. Of course, the dialectic can be inescapably violent in its wrestling, even when we aim to be as kind as possible (nice is not equal to kind).

Further, the dominance of the Christian memeplex in Western cultures (and hence as imperialism in the world) needs to be recognized. We must also not fail in the "is/ought" distinction here either. There's a reason you have folks as loud as Dawkins, and you need to pay attention.

Let's be clear, it's just as easy to point out figures parallel to Dawkins who claim to be Christian (or theists of other faiths) who can be accused of the same charge. Are you going to be objective enough to point those out? I fear you are one of them, except without authentic credentials.

<<<
If Donald Trump had said the same, there would have been a session in the British Houses of Parliament to decide whether or not he should be allowed into the country anymore.
<<<

Redflag. Take it from someone who predicted Trump's win before the end of the primaries. I've seen this book pop up in /r/The_Donald as well. Again, I think this is a tribal dogwhistle.

<<<
I would rather trust the judgments of a good and gracious person than one who spends his time and energy in mocking people and their sacred beliefs. And he is not alone. The hallmark of the so-called “new atheists” is the anger and ridicule that is hurled toward anyone’s belief in the sacred.
<<<

Are you not doing that? You have more lipstick and rouge here, but that's basically what I'm hearing from you too. It might help to first concede some ground where you objectively ought and then point out the flaws. I could write a book on what I think of contemporary Christian sects as well.

I also think this has a rhetorical curve to it in which it's designed to make it easy to believe that just because someone isn't Christian (since even non-Christian theists will disagree to the point of mocking your sacred beliefs too) they aren't good and gracious. There is some serious [[T42T]] give and take in the dialectic, and I don't think you are pulling your weight in cooperation here.

<<<
Need I add, not all atheists have the same disposition.
<<<

Good! Why is it necessary or what even gives you the justified right to make the claims above, then? I hate to admit it, but I don't think you mean to make use of this fact, which you may just be vacuously conceding for the sake of appearances. The systematic (which doesn't make it valid or even rational) point of view you present otherwise contradicts this claim.

<<<
Many have remarked that they have been able to take only so much of Dawkins and his followers and then stopped even reading them.
<<<

Dawkins has some unscholarly qualities, but you've generalized here without paying Dawkins his due. Dawkins has done some truly scholarly work. Some of his barbs are right on the money. You want me to read you for your argument rather than your rhetoric, right? That's what I'm doing. Peeling out the actual argument from your sophistry. Your argument is bad so far.

<<<
Whatever worldview we espouse, dialogue and debate should take place with civility and courteous listening.
<<<

Let me say, I often distrust those who call for civility. It's a redflag. That doesn't mean everyone who claims it is wrong or doesn't mean it. But, it's an important dark-triad characteristic among rhetoricians, politicians, and those who aim to manipulate. That isn't to say I don't agree to the need for civility, but it is a profoundly misused call in the dialectic. I guard the claim closely, since it's easy to abuse tone-policing without substance.

<<<
The pulpit can sadly be a place of bullying people into guilt and remorse and other emotions that make them want to escape from the voice hammering away at them, to say nothing of the anti-intellectualism among Christian ranks that brands even a hint of philosophy or science heretical.
<<<

Good. This is a start to responding. I hope you live up to it. You have a lot of redflags here. Developing objectively good epistemic justifications, especially in communicating with others, is extremely difficult.

<<<
History has taught us to beware of extremists in any camp that sacrifice cordial conversation at the altar of demagogic enforcement...And rarer still is the ability to defend one’s beliefs with reason and experience.
<<<

Are you sure you are really doing that? I think reason can be violent, even when communicated as kindly as possible. This reminds me of a Chesterton quote: "Reason is always a kind of brute force; those who appeal to the head rather than the heart, however pallid and polite, are necessarily men of violence." There's a reason the Greek philosophers physically wrestled and used it as an analogy. The Hegelian dialectic is quite violent. You slay ideas, and ideas live in people (they comprise our identities to some [[dok]]), even if you do so as humanely as possible.

Well, I'm here to wrestle kindly with you, nomad. Let's see if you have what you say you do. Show me the money. Talk is cheap, but the truth conveyed in words is priceless. Show me you're justified in what appears to be underhanded argumentation in our dialectic.

<<<
Like that Indian, we often ask questions that are manufactured to trip up the other person, while having no answers to the question ourselves.
<<<

Red alert. This claim is arguing that we don't have a right or duty to be deconstructive in the dialectic. It is the equivalent of saying "listen to me, and don't argue." That is a huge redflag. 

It is a moral requirement of correcting our representations/models of reality (our [[axioms|Axioms of h0p3]] that we ask questions we ourselves cannot answer. It is of conceptual necessity that we engage in this epistemic work! You are asking someone not to be rational deep down and to buy what you are selling without inspecting it from all angles. Dangerous cult-leader salesman!

The conversational implicature here, of course, wields "manufacture" as some kind of malicious entrapment. It is as though we send someone a deconstruction that destroys everything, but don't face it ourselves. It implies that someone is being unfair in the dialectic. Are you absolutely sure the other side is doing this to you, Ravi? I think you need much, much better reasons than you've provided to explain and justify such a thesis to fideism in your own system. 

I hope to see some rational respect for the atheist's perspective, especially since you expect it from them. These kinds of questions are not conceptually wrong; the motivation matters and application matters. 

<<<
Everything ultimately came from Nothing
Order came from Chaos
Harmony came from Discord
Life came from Nonlife
Reason came from Irrationality
Personality came from Non-personality
Morality came from Amorality
<<<

That's as fine a starting place in philosophy as yours. It's poetic, but the gist is worth our consideration. Obviously, it gets messy real fast. The hermeneutic spiral may buy you far more than you wish to grant here, too. That list may look like anathema to many Christians (and many other non-Christian theists, spiritual atheists, and even some atheists), but they need legitimate arguments against it. Ultimately, you paint too broadly without being safe in how you generalize.

<<<
But more than that needs to be asserted. The questions in life are not just in the sciences. They are not just of mathematical or empirical measurement.
<<<

So, I agree more needs to be asserted. I'm also not an empiricist or a rationalist, but I think that knowledge is necessarily (though perhaps not sufficiently) justified through Bayesian reasoning to some [[dok]]. Representationalism is one of the fundamental problems in philosophy. 

So tell me what isn't ultimately going to be something you discover through deduction (mathematical reasoning) or induction (empirical reasoning). You will have profoundly solved something with it. You don't get to just help yourself to your claim. You've claimed to have solved the unification of quantum and relativity theories in physics analogous to philosophy here. This is part of the Copernican revolution still ongoing since Kant. You don't get to say you've solved this universally without a groundbreaking argument. You don't get to sidestep the Copernican Revolution in philosophy. You are required to respond to it in the dialectic; it's your obligation to Humanity.

<<<
The scientist may have his subject well in hand, but still have unanswered questions on the meaning of life, while the person next to him may have unanswered questions on the value of the constants in the early formation of the universe, yet have the knowledge of what life really means.
<<<

This is anti-intellectualism, non-cognitivism, and profound failing to appreciate what counts as epistemic justification. It reminds me of the noble savage claim, even as found in virtue theory.

I am happy to deny that empiricism sufficiently gives us ultimate knowledge by itself. Science can only ever give us the instrumental means to our ends, but never the intrinsic ends themselves. However, your claim is that scientific empirical knowledge is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing the meaning of life. That is a profound claim that flies in the face of thousands of years of philosophy. Even the Christians I respected as an educated Christian would never have agreed to such a claim. 

You tell a story but do give not even the kernel of an idea that justifies why empiricism isn't necessary (even if it's insufficient) for securing the means to our ends. You really can't know what "one ought to do," "how one ought to live," "who one ought to be," or the "why" of anything in the end, that which is necessary for [[The Telos]], without also understanding a wide variety of scientific empirical models necessary for it. 

<<<
He may have in his heart the deep conviction that this present sorrow is only a punctuation mark because eternity awaits. One discipline may answer “how” in a material explanation, but the most important question answers the “why.” Why is it that we are here in the first place, and who will see us through the anxieties and pains of life itself? These questions are different yet equally relevant, but for different reasons. Life requires some understanding, and the struggles we face need explanatory power. It is when we get the two subjects and their reasons for existence mixed up that we end up with verbal attacks and needless hostility.
<<<

Are you missing the point? Leibniz asks us "Why is there something rather than nothing?" You should accuse the man of deism, and he certainly didn't hold onto any notion of Christianity you preach. 

You are being purposely obtuse. The atheist above claims, "Everything ultimately came from Nothing" and is trying to respond to it. The "how" does take us to "why" up until the "is/ought" leap of faith (which should be taken with maximum information in hand). Even the atheist (or deist, which I'm going to bet you think of as roughly an atheist) is responding to exactly that.

You imply that the problem exists between "materialists" (or physicalists, or logical positivists, or empiricists) and those who are answering some metaphysical questions as perhaps naive realists. The problem, of course, is that one can be an atheist without thinking this is a materialist problem at all either. The atheist you quoted is very clearly talking about metaphysics to my ears. The "why" is definitely there to me.

Furthermore, the story of Einstein is bizarre. Anyone paying attention to Einstein's point of view knows he's quite worried about these issues. The story is another attempt to engage in the noble savage fallacy. I hate to break it to you, but science should profoundly inform the nature of the "why." You don't get to just cut out empiricism, mathematics, or modern intellectual work when it suites you. Christianity has a duty to live up to science's epistemic standards and beyond (that doesn't mean disagreement isn't possible: far from it). If the memeplex fails in this respect, it is not more epistemically worthy in the dialectic.

<<<
Many an atheist asks questions for which he or she admittedly has no answers or believes the answers to be “on hold,” but we are expected to give credence to the whole worldview for merely raising the question.
<<<

Many a Christian and non-Christian theist as well! You don't get to apply a double-standard here. In epistemic humility you must own up to your weak points and make sure you aren't being a hypocrite. Surely you expect the same of your opposition.

X asks Y a question Z that X cannot answer. If Y cannot answer the question Z, then Y has to be honest about. That doesn't mean X is correct en toto, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't ask question Z. This is about reigning in our axioms. We have to be minimalist (though not necessarily reductive) in a way to safely unblur the problem. Exactly how best to do this is exactly what epistemology is looking at.

I'm not convinced the atheist is also making an argument which is merely reducible to lobbing unanswerable questions. This does not do justice to the history of atheist thought or theist thought either. Again, I think you wield rhetoric rather than a valid argument.

To be clear, skepticism is generally the result of employing a high epistemic standard for our context. Are you sure you have the right contextualist epistemology, Ravi? The bracketing of perceptions, the solipsistic doubt, and the willingness to doubt that far down is a fundamental attribute of a good philosopher, someone who has the possibility of generating and maintaining deep integrity. I worry you are confabulating your way to not having to face doubt, avoiding wrestling with your faith, and essentially finding ways to lie to yourself about the motivational and epistemic content of others because you don't want to consider the possibility that your reality map is profoundly wrong.

There are some kinds of axioms we can put on hold. The belief in God is one of them. And even a good theist must wrestle, Israel. You're wandering the desert poorly if you don't doubt effectively. Ultimately, skepticism cleanses and coherentifies our justificatory and explanatory models. It's necessary to cull and update our beliefs. That's what intelligence (ultimately wisdom is a kind of intelligence) boils down to in some crucial respects.

<<<
This book is about examining the “gods” secular thinkers “worship” and how repeatedly they leave their own questions unanswered.
<<<

Good! So far, your examination looks to be a strawman filled with redflags, false dichotomies, and red herrings. I'm worried you really don't even begin to see the real problems. 

I also want to point out, many people who define theism would not conflate those "false idols" with "gods" that are "worshipped." Let me grant you this: everyone must take up [[axioms|Axioms of h0p3]] in faith. There's no escaping that. But, even the atheist can grant this (many do). It's pretty uncharitable to say they believe in a god when they explicitly claim not to. Are you sure you haven't conflated faith in axioms with faith in gods? I don't see why we should agree.

Lastly, are you going to engage in the same practice about your own unanswered questions? This is a wise commitment to make if you aren't applying a double-standard. This work so far is dripping with bias and rhetoric though.

<<<
I have dealt with the philosophical debate on these matters in other writings.
<<<

Your record has been called into doubt. This writing also detracts from our systematic reading of your other work.

<<<
But hopefully, more than that, we will state why the answers of Jesus have stood the test of time, truth, and coherence.
<<<

The fitness of a memeplex doesn't make it right //tout court//. Perhaps you have committed the naturalistic fallacy, conflating the "is" with the "ought." Might does not make right. Survival of the fittest, even for ideas and belief systems, in [[The Great Human Conversation]] is not sufficient. I admit, the most fit are often among them, but not all. There are evolutions in our memes which aren't necessarily adaptive or optimal for continuing their lineage by any stretch. 

<<<
Remember the insight of G. K. Chesterton in his book Orthodoxy that, for the atheist, sorrow is central and joy peripheral, while for the follower of Jesus, joy is central and sorrow peripheral.
<<<

My Chesterton quote above is a problem for you. Chesterton isn't always right either, obviously. Why should we agree this insight is correct? 

Let's be clear, the people who score among the highest on hedonic and eudaimonic happiness ratings live in largely atheist societies. Theists tend to be happier in theistic societies, and atheists in atheistic societies. The placebo of prayer actually generates prudential justifications in epistemology too. None of this, however, is an argument towards alethic validity!

The whole point of joy, sorrow, pleasure, pain, and essentially existential satisfaction may be reducible to theism in some respects, but you need a radically better argument for this claim. You don't get to just help yourself to it.

<<<
For the Christian, it is reversed: The foundational questions have been answered and only the peripheral ones remain in doubt.
<<<

Yikes. No True Scotsman problem. Let me suggest that even orthodox interpretations of the Judeo-Christian tradition see the remnant as still lacking answers to the foundational questions. The arrogance in your statement is profound. It's time for you to list out what counts as The Epistemic Foundation. It's ballsy to say you have it. 

To someone who has studied the problem of Foundationalism for a long time, I can tell you that is an absurdly strong claim to make. Again, it's beyond the Copernican Revolution paradigm shift to say you have it. Cough up the reasons. If they are right, surely you will be able to explain them. Yes, a good wrestler defeats all comers in the dialectic.

Otherwise, I suggest this is just an attempt to cover up a lack of actual justification for foundational questions (which has been my experience with Christianity).

<<<
My favorite essayist, F. W. Boreham, has written an essay entitled, “A Baby’s Funeral.” Anyone who has read Boreham knows the beauty of his language and the depth of his writing. He has authored over fifty volumes of essays.
<<<

Nice virtue signal.

I gotta say, stories and illustrations have serious emotional content to them. That's exactly why we have to be careful with them. It's easy for people to be manipulative with parables. The meat of the argument needs to be reason, not emotion, even if the emotional content is necessary for juicing our intuitions. 

<<<
You see, there is an intellectual side to life but also a side to life where deep needs are experienced. We falsely think that one side deals with truth and the other with fantasy. Both need the truth, and the elimination of one by the other is not the world in which God intends for us to live.
<<<

Agreed. Both sides are necessary for the dialectic. Many profoundly influential atheists are making this exact point, and you shouldn't even remotely imply otherwise. Problematically, why should we think this is a matter of God's intentions? You don't have a special argument here for God, even if you are correct about the necessity of balancing the relationship between our verbal and quantitative reasoning as well as our neo-cortex and limbic systems. Knowledge is a result of networks of cognitive and non-cognitive computing processes in our body, but you've done nothing to damage the atheist's position or bolster your own at a conceptual level.

When Socrates says, "Virtue is Knowledge," that's exactly what he's pointing to. Be careful to admit the syncretism that has completely revolutionized the Christian memeplex over time. You are strawmanning the atheist here.

<<<
It is my hope that the reader will stay the course with an open mind to judge fairly how unique and splendid is the message of Jesus Christ, reaching to the deepest hungers and questions of the heart and mind.
<<<

But you aren't keeping that open mind for atheists.

Let's be clear, I know many atheists who are very learned about the best arguments for theism (often possessing significant knowledge of many religions). The proportion of theists who understand the atheist's best arguments tends to be lower than the atheists I've met regarding theism. I'm surprised you don't have anything to say about agnosticism here either.

Openness, as a psychological characteristic, is something I expect from mature atheists and theists. It is quite possible Ravi's demographics tend to be more fundamentalist (something which is correlated with lacking openness). We must think carefully about that.

Furthermore, you have no argument here about why atheism (nor the other religions) aren't just as capable of "reaching the deepest hungers and questions of the heart and mind."

<<<
To be truthful, I wouldn’t waste a solitary moment in this task if I didn’t truly believe that as the world is skidding out of control—politically, socially, economically, and racially—Jesus’ answers are unique and true and provide the only coherent worldview, combining truth with relevance to bring hope and meaning.
<<<

That's exactly why I'm writing this wiki, except I don't think Jesus or Christianity is the answer. Just because you said Jesus uniquely solves the problem doesn't make it so. Again, I think you are attempting to preach to the choir, not actually convert anyone. You are propping up delusional self-righteousness with platitudes: I'm sure it sells a lot of books and speaking engagements.

<<<
The follower of Jesus sees what is happening through the lens of how Jesus describes the human condition and the answer He gives. The contrast with the secular gods of this age is huge. A fair-minded person must at least give a hearing as to why that is so and, if indeed the answers of Jesus open up vistas for one’s own individual life, see the world through a different set of eyes. With that goal in mind, I enter into this journey of thought.
<<<

Yes, I expect the same of Christians towards all the other religions and non-religious perspectives as well! Seriously, why do you think the other ~2/3 (or more) of the planet are wrong? Have you deeply understood their perspectives? Have you been as charitable to them as you expect them to be of you? When was the last time you cracked open the Quran? Can you talk about the 5 pillars? From a comparative standpoint, are you religiously and atheistically literate?

<<<
When Mortimer Adler, the editor, was asked why that theme occupied such length when many other notable themes were given less space, he answered without hesitation, “Because more consequences for life and action follow from the affirmation or denial of God than from any other basic question.

The questioner was silent and nodded.
<<<

That doesn't make Adler correct. I happen to think it is, but the argument for it is a more complex one than is implied here. I think [[The Good]] is God though. More importantly, God doesn't have to be anthropomorphized, which I suspect is being implied here. There are more fundamental questions in philosophy actually, but I agree they eventually point at the answer of some kind of god. I just don't see why it's the Christian one. The philosopher's god tends to make more sense.

The silence claim isn't an argument either. It's a feel-good redflag rhetorical story. The use of this anecdote is biased. You have to give us an argument for why the thesis is true, not an illustration that someone else believed it.

<<<
Yes, indeed, more consequences, on every matter of value and relationship, follow from one’s genuine belief or disbelief in God than from any other issue. This alone ought to remind us just how critical is the foundation to every life when it comes to God. The follower of Jesus Christ must take serious note of this. That belief has meaning and must make a difference.
<<<

Yes, indeed, you have restated your thesis. I hope this repetition doesn't count as your argument. Your conclusion is a far cry from the supporting the claim that Christian belief in the Christian God is the best answer to this fundamental question.

<<<
I will never forget talking to a former Muslim who had committed his life to Jesus Christ and who gave me a fascinating word picture. He drew two circles and put a small dot in each of them. Pointing to the first, he said, “As a Muslim, I believed the circle to be my faith and the little dot to be my life.” Then he pointed to the next circle and said, “Now, as a follower of Jesus, I have seen the difference in the cultural tension. To many Westerners, the circle is his life and the dot is his faith.”
<<<

Let's be clear, the circumpunct symbol is an old symbol used in many faiths. It has profoundly shaped Christianity as well. Gnostics are famous for it. The Muslim's interpretation, of course, is but one. The things which the circumpunct has represented, the evolution of that concept through [[The Great Human Conversation]] is more complex than what is demonstrated here. This illustration is not a great support for your thesis because it's not clear that Christianity is the best conceptual framework to interpret this idea.

<<<
"But faith seldom enters the conscience as a conviction."
<<<

Again, faith in axioms is not the same thing as faith in God. Do not conflate them. This is an ugly sleight of hand.

<<<
The real world is considered intellectually rigorous, and the world of ultimate reality—faith—fanciful, not to be entertained in factual terms.
<<<

The word //faith// has taken on a specific connotation in plenty of contexts. Avoiding unnecessary fideism is not the same thing as avoiding faith altogether. We should be exceptionally careful in selecting that which we take up in faith. 

It's simply not fair to atheism to paint it this way. If you want the rest of the world to agree to the "but not all Christians," then you better do the same for atheists (and not merely pay lip service to it).

<<<
How fascinating that is. So the values by which we live are parked on the shifting mix of quicksand the skeptic calls “faith,” while the world of pragmatic and real understandings is supposedly built on the bedrock of the sciences called “reason.”
<<<

The people I know with a background in the philosophy of science are highly aware of the methodological restrictions, complexities, failures, and limitations of empiricism. There are also aspects of this "reason" which are good things to take up in faith. Logic, for example, is something I take to be constitutive of reasonable faith to some extreme [[dok]].

The definition of //Reason// is a fundamental problem in philosophy. You aren't allowed to paint this as an atheist's or empiricist's problem alone. This is one of the equivalencies of the fundamental problem in philosophy. It includes questions like: what counts as knowledge, knowledge of what, etc.? Even the Christian believes they are engaged in reasonable reason and faith, and they must defend their point of view in [[The Original Position]]. That's just what the Golden Rule really means (and I say that as someone who denies constructivism).

<<<
If he is right, I will go so far as to say that the West is on the verge of collapse at the hands of its own secular intellectuals.
<<<

I think it's collapsing due to a number of theists and atheists; there are sheep and wolves on both sides. Acting like Christians aren't responsible at all is patently ridiculous. Do I really need to go through church history here? It's such a strong claim to say it's even primarily the fault of secular intellectuals. You need an argument. 

Here's some pushback: even as a theist, I had to admit that the overwhelming majority of the most intelligent people I'd ever met weren't Christians, and many weren't theists either. I can look through history and point out theists and atheists who changed [[The Great Human Conversation]] forever as well. This doesn't make Christianity wrong, but it should give us pause.

Dark triad characteristics, failures to engage in [[T42T]] Golden Rule reasoning is really at the heart of the Crisis of Capitalism, playing iterated zero-sum games of perfect competition (or morally worse), and the exploitation of others materially and memetically. I think most people are evil to some [[dok]], including Christian theists, non-Christian theists, atheists, agnostics, etc. The privation of [[The Good]] and, relatedly, [[The Right]], is the fundamental problem here, regardless of the other empirical and historical claims you take up in what may be proudly blind faith.

Your tribe has a non-trivial hand in the collapse, sir. You are part of the problem, not the solution.

<<<
The Christian faith brings with it convictions by which to stand and build a moral framework. The secular thinker, with his implicitly amoral assumptions, imagines that knowledge without a moral base has enough sustaining power. It simply doesn’t.
<<<

That's a stunning lie! Disabuse yourself of the notion that secularism and moral anti-realism are identical. I happen to agree that [[The Good]] just is god, and the basis of [[The Right]], but moral philosophy is justifiably open to a large number of conceptual stances. I know a number of people that claim to be secular and whom you would call secular who also very clearly believe in [[The Moral Law]]. I don't think they understand the implications fully, but I would say the same about Christians, theists, atheists, and everyone (including myself). 

This is a purposely deceptive strawman. This is like calling anyone secular a Nazi or something ridiculous like that. 

It's also important to see that the Christian faith needs to demonstrate why it's better at explaining morality and giving us a framework than all the other belief systems. I actually think very Straussianly orthodox Christianity has some excellent properties to it. I can find [[The Golden Rule]] in a number of religions and cultures though. It's a common game theoretically sound point of view on altruism and [[treating the other|Find The Others]] with respect.

<<<
The value-less culture of today will not be able to withstand the attack.
<<<


That is a sweeping generalization. I also think it's a failure to even understand the various attempts to address postmodernism. It's easy to rail against postmodernism, but it's much harder to defeat it when you realize that postmodernism takes modern approaches to the nth degree. Postmoderns are drowning in meaning; that's the problem! It's not valueless, even if the wrong moves result in it. Defusing that bomb is a task that you simply aren't appreciating enough, Ravi.

Culture is simply more complicated than you want to admit. In fact, the dark-triad's values aren't valueless, and that is exactly what makes them so dangerous.

The inability to see how Christianity itself is part of the problem is insane (even from within the Christian's paradigm).

<<<
Indeed, the preservation of a nation’s ethos is at stake at all times. 
<<<

Nationalism is immoral, and that's obvious even from within Christian axioms. Get past your dispensationalism, your belief in geographic tribes, and your reliance upon terrible political philosophy. Even a Christian should be a cosmopolitan. It's pretty obvious that we don't want certain nations to preserve their ethos. We are each memetic and cultural elitists. Why should we actually care about a nation's ethos as opposed to Humanity's at large? This is inspiring to the patriots who have conflated their faith and their national citizenship, but that doesn't make it a good argument.

<<<
So I ask: Should one’s belief in God and destiny be more important than life itself?
<<<

Can you first answer what it means for X to be more important than Y? How do you epistemically justify it? What is the best explanation of this foundation? Only then, after you can answer those kinds of questions, are you allowed to effectively answer yours. There is a philosophical foundation which you require before you can even access your question.

The belief in destiny isn't even a settled matter in Christianity by miles. There are huge theological quarrels over the issue. You don't get to help yourself to this either.

<<<
The irony is that for the atheist, the answer can only and ultimately be found in one’s political theory or, by default, in one’s cultural cradle, and cannot be mandated by a supervening worldview that pursues truth as an objective fact over and above all else.
<<<

This is a fraudulent argument, yet again. Why is this conceptually necessary? Why do you think atheism is fundamentally amoral and subjectivist by definition? Why do you think they don't have access to objective facts and truth? Just because you say it doesn't make it so. 

Look, I'm not saying you can't give an answer at all, but I'm saying you haven't given even the basic outline of an answer. This is a line that Christians use to dismiss atheism without nearly enough evidence. When you go to see the foundation of morality, you will see it is taken up in faith. Why it must be Christian, however, is something you won't be able to provide on a strictly moral foundation. 

You aren't in a position to claim a personal God (part what I take you to mean by theism, since you conveniently do not give us a definition) is conceptually necessary for even the possibility of [[The Moral Law]]. I grant that you need a telic concept of [[The Good]] to get to [[The Right]], but I don't see why we must accept that foundation as God in Christian sense (or even in the standard religious sense).

<<<
Every other discipline is dismissed as being outside truth, reflecting merely cultural and career desires. That’s all life is about. The naturalists control truth and then give license to other disciplines to live without absolutes. That is the deadly fallout.
<<<

Atheists are not necessarily naturalists. You need an argument for why you think they are conceptually linked (bad news for you on this front). It's like saying people with lots of melanin pigmentation in their skins are necessarily evil; it's that profoundly unjustifiable. It's ridiculous. Go on, attack naturalism (and you fail hard in that arena too), but don't conflate it with atheism.

Some of the most moral humans I've met were naturalists. I don't think they are right about their justifications, but their conclusions tend to be radically closer to the truth than yours. I say this while completely agreeing that naturalism has unfairly shaped discourse in philosophy for the past century. You're doing a bad job of showing why. There are much better attacks on naturalism than your strawman.

<<<
The naturalist is somewhat like that. Unable to respond to where the truth leads, he is useless to a person hungering for rescue and safety for life itself. He just states what is and does nothing about what should be.
<<<

Good. You are much closer to the problem here. Unfortunately, you have to give an account that has an "is" to it of how "ought" arises which is a plausible explanation. It turns out to be very hard. The naturalist's assumptions don't lend to that account on my view either. However, again, the atheist need not be a naturalist at all. This conflation is tiresome. You can't really call yourself an educated person on the matter and make mistakes this large. It's like calling yourself a mathematician but not having studied algebra. 

<<<
Why do I make the connection between a nation, a people, and a culture? In the current climate, the political arena is fraught with language and views that are scary and disorienting.
<<<

The reason you make the connection is directly because it's an arena that scares and disorients people. You are engaged in sophistry. 

Let me grant that every effective systematic philosophy must explain what it means, how, and why we ought to interact with others. It's far from clear why your systematic perspective is the right one. You have your own specific brand of Christianity here, too; what makes it the right one?

<<<
In one instance, a trail of lies makes no difference to the electorate, proving that the most valuable thing in human discourse, truth, is an expendable value if power is obtained. In another instance, even extreme and sometimes pejorative statements on people and views don’t seem to matter, and the dignity of office is replaced, once again, by the quest for power.
<<<

I see your goal is to point out a false dichotomy. This language defining the sides is vague on purpose because we can all seem to make something fit into it (even when we disagree on what/who belongs where). Obviously, I take your initial claim - "you are talking about this because it scares people" - very seriously.

<<<
Candidates coming to the fore propound ideas that are creating anger and protests that make the future very fearsome. For one, “dishonest” sums it up. For the other, “disrespectful” or worse, “prejudice” is the charge. Whether these are legitimate assertions or not is secondary to the assumption that morality matters.
<<<

I grant the necessity of studying eschatology and existential threats. Are you sure this is the best way to describe or reduce it? Why should I think so? Moreover, why do you think your conception of morality is somehow better than mine, or an atheist's, or any random person's? Even your basic moral realist claim here requires significant legwork in philosophy which you've failed to provide. You are continuing to be realpolitik here.

<<<
Ironically, the protestors protesting the candidates themselves resort to injurious means. But what is obvious is that statecraft has become soulcraft, and a nation that formally wishes to deny God finds its imperatives in a deadly mix of conflicting worldviews and hate-laden words on a path to power. What has happened? The answer is clear. The discussion in the public square is now reduced to right or left, forgetting there is an up and a down.
<<<

So, statecraft as soulcraft is older than Christianity. Plato's //Republic// and //The Statesman// are solid examples (and, in fact, via St. Augustine, it defined Christianity through syncretism, and it still does). Let's be clear, it's a huge leap from the claim that "being a good citizen is conceptually linked to being a good person" all the way to "being a good citizen is conceptually linked to being a Christian" (or even a theist as you would define it). It seems like all the real work is in explaining why Christianity is definitionally better than all the other options, and you've not done that.

I'm not saying you can't make these links outright, and I'm not tone-policing here either. It's your duty in the dialectic to magnanimously state your thesis clearly, actually support it, then conclude its completion. Be prepared for the possibility of losing. You actually have to cooperate in the dialectic. Perhaps that is what you take yourself to be doing here. It's pretty obvious to your opposition that you aren't. You don't get to just claim victory here. 

I also must point out that "hate-laden" words is something you need to define. I know a lot of Christians who are going to think that even a fairly neutral, kindly explained critique of Christianity is tantamount to radical persecution, i.e. that any criticism which calls their worldview into doubt is unquestionably "hate-laden." 

I grant the dialectic is a dangerous wrestling-battlegrounds. At least one of us delusional and radically wrong about the nature of reality, and in a sense, our identities are at stake. Unfortunately, some people you take to be hateful are actually just highly effective (and more justified), even in their kindness and honor. You suggest it with lip service earlier, but it's not obvious you take that possibility seriously. 

There's also something wrong here when you imply the political landscape is dichotomized, but that we are all ignoring the false dichotomy. That's not what demographic studies show. It's way messier, and almost everyone I know believes there is more than right and left (and legitimately acts on that belief). This sweeping generalization is not accurate, and that is a redflag.

<<<
These matters alone remind us that we had better understand this philosophy called atheism and why it leads where it does.
<<<

I'm not convinced you even have a solid grasp of where atheism can possibly lead. You should not imply that it has a singular path or end, either (you have an ambiguous statement here which is slippery). You agree you want to know your enemy, but it's not clear you've actually stepped in their shoes. I've yet to see your charity.

Your problem might be that you think Christians have a monopoly on fundamental wisdom. You have to give an argument for it. You have to explain and justify why articles like The Bible are universally and categorically authoritative in all contexts. So far, you've been handwaiving. 

<<<
Strange, isn’t it, that atheists in the West want the term marriage redefined while their counterparts in Russia and China will have nothing of that redefinition? Both have their own reasons, and there is no common point of reference. That’s precisely the edifice built on the bedrock of naturalism. 
<<<

This isn't just atheists, but a ton of theists as well. Look at Millenials and Gen Z: even those who remain Christian or theist still have very high rates of accepting non-traditional definitions and structures of marriage from legal, moral, and religious perspectives. You don't get to just pin this on atheists. That's patently false and misleading. You also don't just get to help yourself to even the implication that redefinition is a bad thing.

Russian and China are incredibly complex cultures, and you also don't have the right to make those statements. I'm also wondering if there is a Red Scare dogwhistle-like face to this argument. 

Do you really think we there is no common point of reference? Consider this: 

`a = a` or `P->Q, P; therefore, Q` or etc.

I think even the use of the English language is a rhizomatic set of things we hold in common. You are purposely overstating your position. 

I don't see why you get to dump this all on naturalism. Further, you continue to conflate naturalism with atheism. You also completely ignore the problem of other religious traditions here. 

<<<
Each person is a law unto himself.
<<<

Pure subjectivism and postmodernity are mind-blowingly hard problems. I doubt you have background in the problem of autonomy as well (which literally means "self-legislator"). Practicing faith really is about binding ourselves to the best axioms/laws/reasons/systems we can find. 

I'm worried you accuse anyone not Christian, but especially atheists, of automatically being relativists and naturalists who are responsible for the downfall of the political world. Christians are also responsible for the problems you're seeing here. 

<<<
Remember in the Old Testament when people wanted a king and God said that He wanted to be their ruler? The people fought back and said they wanted to be like every other nation and, in fact, have somebody else to fight their wars while they could go about their lives. They got what they wanted and found out that the greatest battles were ultimately for the rule of one’s heart. Once that becomes autonomous, culture and politics become lawless. And when those battles are lost, the war that looms is of huge proportions. This is, at best, the unintended consequence of atheism.
<<<

Why do you think atheism is fundamentally going to lead to anarchy, lawlessness, or evil? Why should we accept your conceptual conflations and unjustified causal claims? 

It appears you are arguing against autonomy only when it doesn't give you the answer you want.

The Christian Memeplex is a mental virus (like all memes) in the minds of networks of human specimens through history. It's clearly done good thing and bad things in politics. You aren't even trying to fairly reason about this; instead you foist all the presumed evil consequences onto atheism. Atheism's various memeplexes just haven't been nearly as powerful as you imply, unless you mean to say anything which isn't Christian is functionally atheism (and even then, Christianity has been very powerful).

<<<
We think atheism is some kind of newfangled thinking, that science and its bequest gave way to autonomy and our solitude in the universe. That is simply not so. The formalization of it and giving it intellectual respect may have taken time, but the question goes back to the beginning of time.
<<<

You are denying that it's newfangled thinking, but I don't know why the rest of us should be taken to have made that assumption (why agree to "we" here?). I assume atheism is much older than theism. Theism is a very complex set of beliefs that primitive primates had to take time to evolve. That memeplex had to emerge from atheism. This is the dialectic. You start with the "nothing" and build (or discover) "something." Christianity is much newer than many other formalized belief systems. The initial questions, of course, are old. 

<<<
Right from the start the question was not the origin of species but the autonomy of the species. We are more prone to quote from the Wilberforce/Huxley debate or the Galileo/Church conflict than to look back and see where such real tensions began.
<<<

Why should we agree that to that timeline? Whose question is this? The problem of autonomy, as a concept, may be just as old as the concept of the origin of species of any kind of evolution. It is obvious, however, that you need an origin of the species before you can evolve to have autonomy. I don't see why your notion of these tensions is meaningful here. You don't resolve them at all, either. This line of reasoning in general seems irrelevant.

<<<
We think Darwin buried God, but in fact, in Genesis 3, the very first in the created order wished to bury Him too.
<<<

Who thinks that? Are you sure you are engaged in apologetics or confirming the bias of those who want to dismiss the opposition out of hand with a strawman? Darwin is not the end of God at all. I'll agree that science poses problems for several lines and sects of many religions, including Christianity, but I know plenty of Christians, non-Christians, and atheists who can see the above is poor reasoning.

Furthermore, you don't get to invoke the Bible as authoritative until after you justified why it's authoritative. You don't get to use it itself as the reason for its own authority.

<<<
All the way to Calvary, the first attempt at death was the death of God. The killing of God was followed by the killing by Cain of his brother, Abel. The Bible addresses this conflict from the pre-Mosaic era. After all, the battle in Genesis was really based on two questions. The battle between theism and atheism is the oldest philosophical debate.
<<<

Why should I think it's the oldest philosophical debate? It's among them, related to them, and perhaps even the most fundamental of them. That's not the claim it's the oldest philosophical debate, though. You are overreaching. I don't see why I have to buy the Christian metanarrative here either. You are telling a specific group of Christians what they want to hear, but you aren't making a good argument in general.

<<<
What are the two questions that existed for humanity from the beginning of creation? The first salvo hurled against God in the Garden was “Did God really say?” In the gospel story, the temptation of Jesus resurrects the same question, either by questioning a text or by wrenching it free from its context. The test brought to Jesus in the desert, the same test brought in the Garden, was “Has God said?” and “Is it true?” Those questions implicitly asked whether there was an up and a down. Is there a prescriptive backdrop to life? Can I not be my own definer of good and evil? Am I subject to some higher non-tangible authority?
<<<

Why should we agree these are the questions from the beginning of creation? Why can't it be the "implicitly asked" questions which are obviously more fundamental in the epistemic foundation? It seems to me you have a serious uphill battle. Again, you have not provided evidence for the Christian metanarrative.

<<<
The key here is that he simply does not believe God would reveal Himself in propositional truth. Paine didn’t invent that predicament. It existed from the beginning. Revelation was not in a vacuum of belief. Revelation was sustained by evidence and propelled by a reality check, time and again. The very means by which we ascertain truth is not merely an inner voice but the rationale of why we are here in the first place.
<<<

I can agree that Reason is at the core justifying itself as an axiom. Why should we think Christianity or any religion is that? You don't get to just help yourself to this, either. Again, it appears that which cannot be doubted by definition is immutably constitutive of Reason. What is mutably built on top of that may also be constitutive, but you have to start arguing for your other axioms through at least coherentist perspectives (if not externalist as well). 

<<<
The question should really be why we even think of a supreme being. Why do we ask if there is a sovereign power over the universe?
<<<

What makes you think all cultures do ask those questions? It's pretty obvious they don't ask or answer like the Christians in many cases, as well. Why should we assume God is a sovereign agent or has power? You don't get to just help yourself to stuffing arguments into our mouths here, unless you really are just preaching to the choir who wants to be told they were right all along without any argumentation. 

Even if they did, should that count as an argument in favor of it? 

<<<
Is it because we are deluded into thinking there should be, or is it because reason demands a cause and a purpose?
<<<

You don't get to assume that the Principle of Sufficient Reason (where you are driving at, I believe) results in Christian belief, or even a belief in the theist's God. Telic reasoning does not require it. You've swept the alternatives under the rug and attempted to force a conceptual relationship here that isn't necessarily true. That is deceptive.

<<<
Is it possible that deep within our hungers is this quest to know why we are here in the first place, and the naturalist’s cavalier dismissal of that question falls upon questing souls that search for a reason as much as the body yearns for water?
<<<

Again, "atheist" is not the same as "naturalist". You also have to resolve the problem of other religions and establish the authority of the Bible (good luck) as well. You are trying to compress your opponents into a strawman here. 

You aren't being fair to naturalists either. You don't have sufficient reasons to stereotype them as cavalierly dismissing that question. Many just answer it differently than you do. Let be me clear, I think naturalism is an utter failure, too, but your reasoning is unacceptable.

<<<
There were no professors of science in the original created order to question revelation.
<<<

I suppose it depends on what you mean by "original created order," and that is not something you get to help yourself to without justification, either.

Many intelligent people think the Bayesian method of empirical reasoning is fundamental to any kind of intelligence (that doesn't make them right, but it should give us pause). Responding to Kant is what we are still doing today. Induction is a process of modeling, and that's really what scientists are doing. I don't see how we aren't scientists who also rely upon axioms. 

Questioning revelation is also at the heart of orthodox Christianity.

Your claim appears to have a lot of emotional content to it. I see a lot of Christians who hate academia. This plays nicely as emotional appeal, but it's not an argument.

<<<
From deep within the human soul arose the challenge for autonomy over against a boundary within which to live. So let’s get over two blunders—the one that thinks this is modern man in revolt, and the other that thinks intellectuals disbelieve in God and only the naïve or stupid continue to believe in God. I have met intellectuals on both sides of the issue, and it is not merely an intellectual struggle. It is a struggle of bridge building, of trying to tie theoretical structures to heartfelt and heart-hungering realities.
<<<

I agree to several of the moves you make here. However, I don't see why those two blunders are truly blunders. Insofar as emotional reasoning from our limbic system is fundamental to our ability to engage in the dialectic, I agree there is a unification process in our reasoning which isn't reducible to mere cognition. It is, ultimately, a struggle to be wise. Belief in [[The Telos]] is belief in some kind of God, imho. I see no reason to think it's the Christian one.

Your arguments have been an emotional rallying cry. I don't see the bridge-building here.

<<<
The second question that originated in Genesis came in the form of a challenge: “You will not surely die! You will be as God, defining good and evil.”
<<<

I think you misrepresent your opposition, including the non-Christians (and even some Christians). Maybe this is how one ought to interpret Genesis (debatable), but this isn't a charitable representation of your opposition. Again, see the various problems surrounding the Biblical authority problem.

<<<
For Darwin, as for our polite modern thinkers, hell is anathema.
<<<

Well, hell is supposed to be anathema, right? We shouldn't want it. You mean the possibility of it. Well, the vast majority of humanity doesn't believe in the Christian's notion of hell (plenty of Christians don't either!). Why should we agree to your particular beliefs? Don't you need to give us public reasons?

<<<
Why would any self-respecting human being think up hell?
<<<

Traditionally, the social Darwinian story tells a story about primitive humans started a rumor/belief-system in hell as a method to subdue other humans, to prevent "might makes right," and to make moral or religious reasoning play a bigger role in how we interacted with each other. It may be a plausible story, and I'd like to see why it's wrong. Regardless, that people don't like the idea of hell isn't an argument against the belief there is no hell.

You have to give reasons for your construction here. Why does it represent reality more clearly than the other models?

<<<
Interestingly, these who challenge the existence of God are the very ones who are willing to punish others for their beliefs.
<<<

It seems pretty obvious to me that the Abrahamic faiths have been notoriously wielded to punish others for their beliefs. In fact, I can see persecution caused by almost all parties here - theist, atheist, or other. You aren't even attempting to see the truth here. This is pure ideology.

<<<
“Destroy the livelihood of those who believe in the sanctity of marriage!” 
<<<

This is scaremongering. Those who are destroying our livelihoods often include Christians as reactionaries and Capitalists. The notion this is connected to the sanctity of marriage is a non-sequitur. This is not logical; it's designed to generate anger to blind someone into thinking it's a justification. When the merit of your argument only exists in virtue of the emotions it causes, you have an argument which bears much closer scrutiny.

<<<
“Don’t give them a place in academia if they really believe God exists!”
<<<

Belief in God is not the same as belief in the Christian God. It's clearly not an accident that you continually make this error. It's not a slip of the tongue.

Many academics do believe in God, even the Christian God. And you should be worried that many of the smartest people on the planet have profound disagreements with your perspective on God. It's time to cough up a real argument.

<<<
Such is the retribution of self-worship, imposed by those who call God vengeful, a “joy-killing monster,” and “a freedom-restricting tyrant,” if you don’t give Him His due place. Fascinating how we wield power when we own it and then mock others with power for giving in to the same expression.
<<<

You don't have to self-worship to call the Christian God such things. Not all your opponents do either. You are painting with a broad brush.

This issue doesn't arise without cause either. Christian Theology has a very serious problem. Resolving the progressive revelation in Biblical interpretation is incredibly difficult. Are you sure you are being fair here? Even the most learned people I know on this topic will eventually admit they don't have a solution other than hoping it's true when pushed carefully. Demonstrating how the NT is a coherent extension and fulfillment of the OT is one of the fundamental tasks of Christian studies. Own up to the difficulty of this. You should. The last line here is borderline incoherent. Please, spell it out. I think you are wielding it hypocritically.

<<<
The enemy of our souls basically counters the claims of God, not merely by questioning them, but then by asserting that by disobeying God’s commands one will actually be promoted to taking God’s place.
<<<

The problem of autonomy isn't resolved anywhere, from what I can tell (and it's one of my areas of competence). This is an important problem, though, since you aren't going to be able to talk effectively about what it means to even choose God, either. I strongly doubt you've resolved the Arminian/Calvinist debate that Paul speaks about. Accepting that, you must also then extend the same charity to non-believers. I think you have a double-standard here.

Lastly, you need reasons to call non-Christians (you probably need to expand that far for your argument) the enemy of our souls. I just don't see it.

<<<
Once again at the heart of all temptation is the desire for autonomy and power.
<<<

You don't get to help yourself to and then discard autonomy only when it suits your purposes. You need an argument.

<<<
The human scene was steeped in the battle for autonomy and power right from the beginning.
<<<

Dominion and stewardship were gifted to us on the Christian view. Autonomy may be part of the imago dei (or in fact is). I think you aren't even engaged in good scholarship of The Bible itself here. You are scaremongering towards authoritarianism.

<<<
It is fascinating that the “world’s brightest mind” thinks an intelligence possibly exists out there that could destroy us, but no intelligence exists as Creator.
<<<

I've ridiculed Hawking plenty. He doesn't speak for me. The above is clearly rhetoric as well. Also, note the difference between agreeing to a transcendent creator (which is still a far cry from arrogantly thinking it is a personal God who is somehow anthropomorphized into a person like us) and considering the evolution of other finite creatures elsewhere in the physical universe. These are radically different. 

<<<
Another personal note, from having lived in Cambridge in the early nineties:
<<<

Redflag. You keep acting like you are an elite academic. Don't get me wrong. I can point to a history of people who were clearly doing amazing work outside of academia. I don't see a reason to think you count. I think you are a conman.

<<<
What does it mean to be an atheist? What does the “ism” of the atheist hold? Is it monolithic? Are all atheistic systems the same in political theory? How did that philosophy become a formal system, and how does one respond to its claims?
<<<

Note, of course, that you have to not only defeat the atheists, but the majority of humans who hold a religion different from yours. In fact, it's pretty clear that plenty of Christians would find your claims unacceptable as well.

I also think the "ianity" of Christianity has the same kinds of problems, including being monolithic, political theory, and formalization. What system of thought doesn't?

<<<
Let’s go back to the philosophical and categorical roots of this so-called belief, to its philosophical and cultural viewpoint.
<<<

"So-called" is pretty ridiculous here. Are you arguing against a figment of your imagination? This is rhetoric, again. This is about emotional persuasion far more than the truth. This chapter is not meant to convince your opposition; it's meant to blindly inspire fervor in those who already believe as you do.

<<<
The very Greek word from which we get atheism is really a simple conjoining of the negative with the divine.
<<<

This is a trickier problem than you imply. I'm not sure atheism is conceptually denying the divine. It is denying a Theistic God. There may be other conceptions of the divine they accept, defend, agree to, etc. If you are really trying to effectively argue to a non-believer, you'll have to admit that you are facing many other conceptions of the divine, of gods, of what matters, etc.

<<<
The alpha is the negative and theos is the word for God. At its starting point, from the very structure of the word itself, the philosophy of atheism means no personal, self-existent, autonomous, intelligent first cause of reality.
<<<

Note that they deny the conjunction of those things. They aren't conceptually denying a self-existent first cause of reality. They are denying the personal God of the Christians, though (among others). 

You still have to define autonomy for me at this point. You wield it like a schizophrenic.

<<<
Ironically, in particular cultural milieus the word gets watered down so that in the days of the early Church, Christians were called atheists because they denied the existence of the gods of Greece and Rome. By the seventh century, Muslims branded Christians polytheists because of their cardinal doctrine of the Trinity. One can readily see how important it is to understand, from the orthodox point of view, what the beliefs really are rather than attributing cultural nuances to a system.
<<<

Uh, I don't see why you can escape cultural nuance. I consider religions to at the very least be memeplexes which help comprise our cultures (and those which are right have a correspondence to something real). They are cultures unto themselves. The history of the Christian memeplex appears to be a result of evolution, and you are going to need an argument to show how it's somehow more special than that as well.

<<<
People such as Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, Krauss, and others who promote the aggressive side of this belief muster not a single new argument to defend their position.
<<<

That's not obvious at all. This is hyperbolic, too.

<<<
That is why even other prominent atheists or agnostics consider them an embarrassment and say so.
<<<

We are outside of a popularity contest here, right? Does prominence matter that much? It's a problem for you either way, here.

<<<
The well-respected Encyclopedia of Philosophy edited by Paul Edwards defines atheism as follows: “An atheist is a person who maintains that there is no God, that is, that the sentence ‘God exists’ expresses a false proposition… a person who rejects belief in God.”
<<<

This is what a scholar would turn to: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/. Please, read it.

<<<
Now this latter assumption is terribly prejudiced by culture and, one might dare say, flies in the face of how philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a longtime member of the faculty at Notre Dame, would describe belief in God—a “Properly Basic Belief” so common and so self-evident to the masses of humanity that, to them, no defense is needed. Of course, other philosophers take issue with that and say that in any debate this description would not stand the test of argument. Plantinga contends that the masses of people are not in the arena of debate; they intuitively believe that there is a power greater than themselves, and they seek ways in which to connect with that supreme being. Raised in India, I have seen this firsthand. Though it was not my personal belief, it was indisputably intrinsic to the mainstream of life, both for the unsophisticated and the highly educated.
<<<

That the masses agree to something isn't an effective justification in this arena. When you are writing an apologetics book, even to the layperson, you don't get to help yourself to the basic belief. You have to attempt to give the formal argument.

<<<
It is important to recognize that the Greeks, who really are the forerunners in systematic philosophical thought in classical philosophy (and as an extension of that came democratic government), attempted to define ultimate reality in abstract terms. Their musings and ponderings on ultimate reality cause some to even argue that Plato was probably moving toward a high monotheism. Whether one accepts that or not, what is important is that in their view, ultimate reality was inseparable from virtue and ethical norms.
<<<

I think you need to follow how your own belief system is profoundly affected by different interpretations of Plato. It's not clear to me you effectively appreciate that. Plato's concept of [[The Good]] transformed the Judeo-Christian concept of God you hold today.

Not all Greeks were Platonists, either. There are many schools of thought to consider.

<<<
For many in Greek thought, the power of reason was supreme, and the freeing of philosophy and science from the mystical was a deliberate and purposeful discipline.
<<<

Eisegesis. Many philosophers we admire were shredding sophists. Yes, they did call into question religious perspectives. These philosophers were screaming about the nature of the mystical. You aren't even trying to pay attention.

<<<
But, I repeat, for the Greek thinkers, though they did not posit a God, one thing was certain—virtue and harmony were the emergent implications for life.
<<<

Wrong. Several posited a God of some kind, and I'm not talking about the mythology. Look at Plato's Good (which you only briefly consider), at Pythagoras' cult, at Aristotle's Thinking God of Metaphysics, etc. They didn't posit your God, but that doesn't mean they didn't believe in any God (although, they certainly influenced the memeplexes you hold today).

Virtue I agree to. Harmony only insofar as it is virtue, I agree to as well.

<<<
Actually, that philosophizing would fit into Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and the new tolerance of Western Secularism.
<<<

Your categories are misleading. It's similar to the problem of referring to atheists as naturalists. You seem to see patterns, but then when you go to draw the lines, you do so disingenuously. You can make your point without the sweeping argument here, and you should.

<<<
That is the new god of this age. One look at this and you can see how a political framework addresses the soul of a people when God is not known or sought.
<<<

Again, I remind you that your target here is not merely atheists. It's non-Christians in general. Your categorization is self-serving.

The claim "God is dead" is a valuable one to consider, I agree. You don't get to dismiss secular traditions as the source of what's wrong in the world without an argument, though. It's pretty obvious that a number of atheists and non-Christians are profoundly responsible for what is good and right in the world, as well. It's also pretty clear that the political frameworks we face are sometimes negatively influenced or even crippled by Christians. I'm not going to let you off the hook here when you are this sweeping.

<<<
We can readily see how critical it is that values be upheld for the public good.
<<<

The standard warcry. Why should I take up your values? What are the universal values? They begin long before the discussion of Christianity in the dialectic.

<<<
For now, we see how the early Greek philosophers and early nontheistic spirituality or mystery religions believed in a structure of virtue for one’s individual life and destiny.
<<<

It's not clear that you do at all. You've not even touched on virtue theory.

<<<
There were, however, very important differences in terms of why they thought this way and what they believed the purpose of life to be.
<<<

This is the problem though: you don't appear to understand what their beliefs really were. Why should I grant you these moves?

<<<
That, to me, is key. As I have travelled for some four decades and have literally met with thousands of individuals, either one-on-one or in small groups after the public forums, there are really a handful of questions that emerge.
<<<

That doesn't make them the right questions. That doesn't mean you were looking correctly. Anecdote often has problems, but I think it's all we have sometimes. What are you to do if I can say I've also got plenty of experience, but my results contradict yours?

<<<
The first question is of life’s purpose and meaning: What does life and living really mean?
<<<

I don't think this is the first phenomenological question. I think that question is begged initially before we hermeneutically spiral around to consciously evaluate it. I grant it is a version of the most important question, though. I do appreciate that aspect of your argument.

<<<
Then there comes the question of pleasure and enjoyment: How do I fulfill my desires?
<<<

Why should I agree this is the question that follows? In fact, this appears to be more explicitly asked before the other from what I can tell. Think Kierkegaard's stages here.

<<<
The pursuit of pleasure is at the core of our existence.
<<<

That is an assumption which seems pretty easily denied. Is this more rhetoric?

<<<
We work, we earn a living, we return to our homes, but then we make decisions for our enjoyment: Are there any boundaries for pleasure? Then there is the third question: What does one make of all the suffering and pain we see in this world?
<<<

These are //excellent// questions, but I don't think you've organized or understood their relationship well enough in these few lines. You've forgotten several other areas, including epistemic normativity, philosophy of mind, metaphysics, etc. We all have common sense notions, but that's the point. You've got to have the doxastic material to work with in the first place. In a way, I see this as the question of how to be the best philosopher we can be in each of our contexts.

The third question is anathema for you. The problem of evil is one of the reasons I moved to being a deist rather than a Christian. Standing where I am now, I think it rules out the agency of God (I'm aware of the workarounds, but this appears the most plausible option to me). You won't be able to satisfactorily respond to it as a theist, imho.

<<<
There you have it. Meaning, pleasure, pain. And all of these hang on the hinge of the fourth major question, a very defining one: How and why am I here in the first place? 
<<<

I don't see why it hangs on that. You need an argument for it. I agree they are obviously related, though.

<<<
That defining question is answered confidently by the atheist that we are here by accident.
<<<

Plenty of atheists agree. Not all do. More importantly, and I have to keep saying it because you continue to make this unsavory move: you have to show why Christianity is superior to all the other paradigms. The issue of accident or intention can be interpreted differently in many of them. I think your claim is a sweeping generalization again.

<<<
Turn back the clock and try the same thing again and it will never happen once more. Our presence is a cosmic accident for which there is no script for life or preassigned purpose. But let us be absolutely clear: The atheist has placed all other definitions of life’s imperatives on this one hinge, that we exist on this earth and struggle with human personality, morality, and reality without a personal, moral, or real first cause.
<<<

Whoa. You don't get to help yourself to that claim about atheism. It's obviously conceptually open to at least some of those properties. You are strawmanning hard here.

<<<
That’s the leap of faith—to believe that ultimately life is matter and that it therefore doesn’t really matter. If you submit to the first conclusion, you are inextricably bound to the rest that follow.
<<<

I'm fine with having a serious beef against naturalist, materialist, and physicalist positions (although you need to show your work). You can try to show how it's ultimately reductive to the point of collapsing moral realism. You don't, however, get to paint all of your opponents with this brush, and you shouldn't even remotely imply it. This is deceptively self-serving. You are fishing with keywords to persuade without a sustained argument.

<<<
Gould states unequivocally that meaning is not decipherable by us. No higher answer exists, he says, and we have to find the answers on our own terms. This incredibly answerless answer is what sends Western values on the slippery slope of nihilism.
<<<

What do you think Nietzsche was saying? That's exactly what he is worried about. Resolving postmodernism is our plight, and Christianity has been crumbling under its own epistemic foundations. Very few things seem to stand up to this beast. Furthermore, your example only shows one minority, imho. The "not all" problem is a big one for you.

<<<
 But there is more. If meaning is not within the purpose of our existence, the second struggle is whether to seek a boundary for pleasure or eliminate all boundaries.
<<<

This is not clearly written. I think specificity here is exactly what would reveal your argument to be fraudulent.

<<<
The difference between a nontheistic religion and an atheistic worldview is literally worlds apart.
<<<

Peel apart nontheistic and atheistic for me, please. We may even have serious problems in the conceptual analyses of religion and worldview. I'm worried you are being inconsistent too. It's time for definitions, sir.

<<<
The difference comes from the explanation for theistic thinking. Both the realities of pleasure and of pain demand answers and explanation, whether life has meaning and whether there is a solution to the problem of pain. To arrive at a formal and creedal denial of a supreme being opens the door to all kinds of debates and arguments on the entailments of such a hopeless foundation.
<<<

Why is it hopeless? Why does the problem of pain or evil require a supreme being like yours to solve? The problem of evil is likely an unsolvable problem for you. I consider it a reasonable argument against the Christian God (and even Christians should admit it's a real problem). I think you  choose to call something theist whenever it suits you here. 

I say this as someone who also thinks there is [[The Unmoved Telos]]. To some [[dok]], I want you to be right, and I think you are about there being objective purpose and meaning. You aren't giving the argument though.

<<<
From that starting point the remaining three answers are literally up for grabs, so let’s see how the religious nontheist and the secular atheist deal with the entailments of their starting points. When you start off with “no god,” you end up with the strangest of mental manipulations to keep you from the logical arc of reasoning.
<<<

Why should we agree? I'm afraid your claims are themselves "the strangest of mental manipulations to keep you from the logical arc of reasoning." Looks like projection to me.

<<<
And the first mistake for the atheist is to position science into doing what it was never supposed to do.
<<<

I'd argue Christians and other theists often misposition science. It's also not clear that atheists always (or even usually) make a mistake here either.

<<<
Has anyone provided a proof of God’s inexistence?
Not even close.
<<<

Nor a proof of God's existence, not even close. The issue of epistemic justification here, of course, is not going to be based on certainty, at some level. Proof requires context, too. Even the logical possibility of something doesn't give us epistemic justification, and what counts as a "good reason" seems to be our starting place. The problem is, you have to engage in that before you even begin trying to give reasons for the authority of the Bible or the existence of God.

This call and response rhetoric is gross. 

<<<
Has quantum cosmology explained the emergence of the universe and why it is here?
Not even close.
<<<

I'm of the belief it can't. But, I also think it's important to see science as a conversation and method which doesn't take itself to have solved this problem, and in another sense, shouldn't try to either. Regardless, it's still on your shoulders to show us why your Christian cosmology explains it. To yours I say: "Not even close."

<<<
Have the sciences explained why our universe seems to be fine-tuned to allow for the existence of life?
Not even close.
<<<

Actually, I think science is the only tool that has allowed us to even understand the conditions. The clockwork teleological problem is still a matter of faith in either direction. This does not help your case.

<<<
Are physicists and biologists willing to believe anything so long as it is not religious thought?
Close enough.
<<<

Yikes! Redflag! 

Note, of course, religious thought is different from Christianity and theism. You are lying through your teeth here. Don't you see why people scoff at Christians who take this line of reasoning seriously? It's really awful.

Take it from a man who grew up in that background. I know the mistake because I've made it.

<<<
Has rationalism in moral thought provided us with an understanding of what is good, what is right, and what is moral?
Not close enough.
<<<

I don't think you can even define rationalism (a very technical word). And how would you know? You have to give an argument here. Why should we think you have the answer here? Why is your approach more justified?

<<<
Has secularism in the terrible twentieth century been a force for good?
Not even close to being close.
<<<

Not everything in the 20th century has been terrible. I'm not sure how to make this judgment. The argument, however, sounds like an appeal to nostalgic conservativism and emotional traditionalism. I don't see why you get to claim secularism is responsible for all that is bad. You do realize, of course, that it's ridiculously easy to point out where Christians and the Christian memeplex are profoundly guilty of evil in our world, right? It's not obvious to me that you, your foundation, your sect of Christianity, or even Christianity at large is a good thing anymore. This is, of course, a [[gfwiwcgws]] kind of problem.

<<<
Is there a narrow and oppressive orthodoxy of thought and opinion within the sciences?
Close enough.
<<<

How is your unjustifiably narrow line of reasoning not just as problematic? Evangelicals are notoriously narrow-minded; when it comes to the Big5, they score low on openness. Are you sure this is where you want to go? You're in trouble.

Science narrow in its empiricism isn't oppressive at all. Your position is simply anti-science, and I say that as someone who rails against scientism  (albeit, I think we have different approaches to how we define and reason about scientism).

You know, I intensively believe in objective moral truth. I have strong opinions about it, and I've spent a lot of time studying it. I'm quite educated in the matter, and I have a very narrow point of view. [[The Right]] is the universal normative context of all particular contexts, thus it is quite narrow. I'm fine with narrow, but only insofar as you can stand toe-to-toe in the dialectic through justification.

<<<
Does anything in the sciences or in their philosophy justify the claim that religious belief is irrational?
Not even ballpark.
<<<

Perhaps not all religious beliefs, but surely some. You aren't even trying to look at this carefully. This feels like a 2-minute hate speech.

<<<
Is scientific atheism a frivolous exercise in intellectual contempt?
Dead on.
<<<

Why do I not get to say the same thing about what you are saying here (albeit //anti//-intellectual contempt)? Don't get me wrong, it fills me with glee to show that philosophy is the master discipline. You aren't practicing philosophy well, though. You haven't put the sciences or scientists in their place.

<<<
One has to commend Berlinski and others like him for calling the bluff of those hiding behind science and making sweeping assertions against belief in God. In fact, there is so much contradiction even within the exact sciences that anyone who speaks for all obviously does not respect the different disciplines within science.
<<<

Yet you have made a lot of sweeping generalizations presuming to speak for all.

<<<
In Western cultural speak, we have basically gone from being a rootless society to a ruthless society.
<<<

You are overidealizing here, imho. I think it was virtually always ruthless.

<<<
I know scholarly thinkers in the field of chemistry who have issued challenges to others, asking them to show evidence from chemistry that the move from primordial slime to Homo sapiens is even theoretically possible. Professor James Tour of Rice University is one such scholar. In fact, cosmologist John Barrow said to Dawkins, “You have a problem with these ideas, Richard, because you’re not really a scientist. You’re a biologist.”
<<<

I don't mind prioritizing the disciplines for epistemic justification. Philosophy is king. Even religious studies is a subset of my own discipline. Regardless, Dawkins really is a scientist. I really disliked the man as a Christian, but I still read his books. 

Science tends to rely pretty heavily on decentralizing consensus and peer review. That may be a monkeywrench for you here.

Furthermore, this looks like a signal to creationists rather than a good argument.

<<<
Interesting, isn’t it, how the methodology and implications vary between the disciplines? 
<<<

Interesting, isn't it, how asking vacuous questions doesn't always provide an argument?

<<<
In America, we say that we are a nation of laws. That sounds fascinating. Are we implying that other nations are nations without laws? No culture on earth has more laws than the Islamic world. Their laws extend to what you eat and when you eat, how you marry and whom you marry, how you bank and with whom you bank, when you fast and how much you give, which way you 
<<<

You sure there's no Islamophobia here?

<<<
So we are a nation of laws. Let’s move further. To use a metaphor, law forms the roots from which our culture is built.
<<<

Why should I agree to that claim? That's not a metaphor; that's an assertion that requires justification.

<<<
The trunk then becomes the political system; the branches and the leaves or the fruit of the tree become the expression of the culture. That’s the figurative description of how we build a culture.
<<<

I think you are radically oversimplifying the notion and origins of culture. What does your mistake really imply? It seems authoritarian and fundamentalist.

<<<
When you think about it, it is actually circular. We act as if law just came into being and is self-evident. The question should really be, what holds the law in place?
<<<

Human laws are a subset of culture (or subculture). Trying to make sense of your metaphor: the whole tree, roots and all, is culture. The metaphor isn't working nicely for you.

<<<
The laws that legitimized slavery were railed against by a moral intuition that this exploitation and dominance of a people was morally wrong. Ironically, in their songs both the slave and the slave owner called upon God to rescue them or validate them. They weren’t calling upon nature to do so. Even in the context of the dominance of the Indian people by the British, Bertrand Russell, of all people, said that it was doubtful the plea from reason would have succeeded against the British except that it appealed to the conscience of a Christianized people.
<<<

I think this is one of the reasons I don't trust the moral intuitions of most people. I've studied moral psychology enough to realize what deontic and virtue theoretic actually looks like. It's very easy to see people using their moral intuition to defend slavery. I still see it today! It's another reason why I expect really good reasoning, not emotional arguments from apologists.

This is always the problem with manipulating people's emotions. It is effective, but that doesn't mean we have the right to do so. Justification of coercion is mandatory, and you don't have it. That's exactly why I think this book is outright immoral. Solid Christian apology, as far as I can tell, only ends up buying the logical possibility of justifying your private faith, but doesn't give you solid public reasons that everyone should agree to.

<<<
This is where worldviews come into play. What holds the laws of a nation? It is the moral soil that must hold the roots.
<<<

Legal positivism is probably correct about the basic analysis of the concept of a government and law. I agree the underlying justification, however, must be moral. Unfortunately for your argument, non-Christians and atheists are both quite capable of providing this justification.

<<<
Law, philosophy, love, education, justice… all are built not on reason alone but on moral reasoning. This is the discipline under which atheism fails, and the ideas of atheism will be crushed under the very system constructed to make the one who points the guilty finger ineffectual.
<<<

Why would you think atheism fails here, except that it simply suits the worldview you hope to impose on your audience without reason? Reason is the only way to respect each other's autonomy. (Oh wait, you don't respect that either). 

<<<
The hunger of the human heart is for meaning, reason, purpose, and value, and atheism simply does not have either the answers or the explanatory power to make it possible to build a life on the foundation it offers.
<<<

You have to have an argument. Again, I also think you have to show why Christianity, as opposed to all the other religions, provides a better answer.

<<<
That is why some of the best of them discover at life’s termination point that their philosophy was reasoned into irrationality and their temporary victory, pyrrhic—it cost the victor more than it cost the vanquished.
<<<

I agree that finite reason breaks down when reasoning about the infinite (although that is being very generous to your claim here). I think you aren't being charitable. You claim victory without having actually run the race.

<<<
The chapters to come show the difference between Jesus and secular “isms” in the why of life itself. Our first comparison will be a deeper exploration of atheism—the general “ism” underlying all other secular worldviews. Then we proceed chapter by chapter to confront the secular gods that guide our neighbors and our nation. So far we have glimpsed only the tip of the iceberg. Let’s see where the differences really take us.
<<<

Calling the atheist's belief "secular gods" isn't charitable. Without a definition of God or gods, you aren't in a position to assert it. The odd part is, I'm willing to grant some version of the fact that everyone must have faith, but I just don't see why it's a faith in a God. I agree there is a "Bob" turtle of "turtles all the way down." Now you have to show why the Christian God is somehow going to be a better explanation and justification than what atheists or all the other religions provide.
