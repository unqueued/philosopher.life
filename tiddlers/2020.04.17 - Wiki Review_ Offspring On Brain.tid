** I'm glad she has her doors back.

** We're going to get in a grind-groove that makes sense. I need to keep looking at this with a broader scope. It's easy for me to see only the details of failure and not the general successes (and failures, lol). 
* [[2020.04.16 - TDL: Garden]]
** Lawd knows, I'm demolishing food in the house.
*** My bro doesn't think it makes sense for me to diet with him.

** She must have been feeling at least somewhat better. Relief for everyone!

*** I would be so honored to have a relationship with my offspring where we can talk about everything. Not easy to normalize it.
