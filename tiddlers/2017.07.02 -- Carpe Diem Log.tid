title: 2017.07.02 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up early. I tried sleeping, but I couldn't. I had to pee, and I couldn't because my wife was in the bathroom. My need to pee made it difficult to sleep.
* I whizzed and had some fireman time.
* I didn't use DCK today, but I will tomorrow. We are foregoing our standard Sunday family time since it has been busy.
* I talked with K for quite a while. We got to know each other even better, which was wonderful.
** We went over my substance use and his hangup/history (step-dad) with it. 
* My brother came, and we talked as men for several hours until the rest of the family came. 
** We talked about L's biological donor, relationships, etc. 
** Hell, we talked about a wide variety of topics. It was quite philosophical. 
* They came home, and my wife and I made the sexy times.
* After showering, I made lunch. We had deli sandwiches. It was great.
* We then chilled, talked, etc. 
* We started DND, and it was epic. 
* Afterwards, we made dinner and watched The Boondock Saints.
