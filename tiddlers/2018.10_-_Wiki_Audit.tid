!! Audit:

* Holy fuck, I am doing a great job! I am immensely proud of my work here. I feel like I'm moving mountains. I am literally all smiles right now.
* Lots of linebreaks. Awesome. That's a damned good sign in my eyes.
* My daughter has helped me so much this month; it's ridiculous. How many 12-year-olds can do this? This isn't even where she is most skilled! 
* The dynamic content (from within the static file) is excellent.
** You know, I could technically cut down on filesize this way. It is, technically speaking, a form of compression. But, frankly, it's not much, and I'd much rather have the footholds and precompute.
* It's clear that I'm simply not working fast enough in [[The Remodeling]]. It's going to take forever!
* God damn, you can see the telic flow, the planning, the evolution, the moves. I ADORE what I'm doing here.
* I tried a lot more new things in the wiki this month than usual. I'm clearly sifting for [[Diamonds]] and [[Redpills]]. 
* I've been using [[Remembrall]] and especially [[Pin]]. God damn, [[Pin]] has been saving my butt in my [[Wiki Audit]] this month.
* Search, tagging, and structure only continue to be more important to me.
* My fetish with hardlinking has not been in vain, but I'm forced to make sacrifices. I can feel the pain here. I feel like I've been hedged-conservative about the matter.
* Voldemort, rofl!
* I have to admit, I feel like I'm running a million miles an hour in a thousand directions. I've turned my manic state almost to 11 and left it there. I do love the grind.
* I am hoping that integration into my life will become simpler. I am hoping that after [[The Remodeling]], I will understand my wiki in a natural and automatic (in my head) kind of way. I'm trying to train my [[fastmind]] here.
* This log has been the fucking allstar this month! I hope that continues, and I hope I don't get burned out.
* I'm clearly still worried about my naming conventions, but I am pleased that what I've done has held up so well under the moves to automation. Some of what I've done has made [[The Remodeling]] so fucking easy, like it was born to be remodeled.
** The problem, ofc, is that I have no idea how to continue making "wise" moves like that for future remodeling. I'm flying by the seat of my pants here, and I know that there is some profound modeling problem in the way that I engage in computation (despite some of my virtues and effort).
* [[Alias]] is fucking [[Leet]]. It has immediately made life on the wiki better.
** Tagging has not yet mattered to me except insofar as it has enable me to automate tiddler creation and list rendering. That is okay that because those are non-trivial things. Look at the number of tiddlers I'll spin up in a day simply because it is two clicks away.
* I am being redundant, but I can't help it! TiddlerTools has been fucking amazing. I am SHOCKED more of these tools don't exist. Batchfuckery is awesome.
** I suggest most people are more careful and have less content? 
*** I've been holding out for far longer than most too.
* I desperately want 5.1.18 to come out!
** KeeBoord
** Possibly Autocompletion for links
** Loading animation.
** Kin
* I want to work towards absuing the code plugins more
* I would adore a way to include (and cleanse) my dotfiles (or encrypt them without)
** Representing specific parts of m10's filesystem in general would be fine with me!
* Flexbox, as a project, died for me. It's simply not worth my time. This works well enough on all my devices. I handled the egregious problems with percentages.
* I've engaged in far less scripting than I anticipated I would. This has been outstanding! It turns out, I really can solve more of my problems in JS than I thought I would want to.
** That said, I've had to resort to python and xonsh (mixed with i3) several times. That's cool. You gotta do what you gotta do.
* No problems dating, though I still have that title mangling problem from TW itself. Odd.
* This has been an intense month.
