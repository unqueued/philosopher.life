Btw, you've been buttdialing me a bunch lately.
THU 9:08 PM
The kids and I (both at home and at school) have been screaming for your attention seeing if you'll notice, lol.
THU 9:09 PM
Lol

Putting in my notice tomorrow (hopefully two or more weeks). [[k0sh3k]] has the job officially (barring background check, which is clean). 
THU 9:11 PM
Feels weird to lose my place in the world.
THU 9:11 PM
or part of it*
THU 9:11 PM
Congrats, and sorry it feels tumultuous already
THU 9:12 PM
Hopefully more opportunities that fit with your homeschooling goals near your new home
THU 9:12 PM
The benefits are insane.
THU 9:13 PM
Oooh, do tell

Seems like excellent health insurance through the school. 5 hours tutoring per month for my offspring through the school on whatever subjects (sweet). In 6 years, they pay 16.5k per year for tuition for each child (doesn't help [[j3d1h]]). [[k0sh3k]] can audit whatever she wants. Paying 2k to help us move, with relocation agency to help us find a place, etc. 
THU 9:15 PM
And wages? /Drumroll
THU 9:15 PM
70k
THU 9:16 PM
16.5k at any school?
THU 9:16 PM
(not insane wages for the area, but liveable!)
THU 9:16 PM
Aye, very nice :)
THU 9:16 PM
Seems like any school, but I only have a small blurb to go off of.
THU 9:17 PM
So if [[j3d1h]] waited 6 years she would be... 20?
