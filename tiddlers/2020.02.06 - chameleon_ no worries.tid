Hello [[h0p3]],

Thought I'd send a quick reply to your [[@]] and clarify a few things.

> I appreciate that you are so thoroughly and charitably considering my correspondence with DeathOfRobinhood. I'm sorry if it makes you sad or angry.

Eh, sadness and anger are fleeting. They pass in time. Part of learning to live with my mercurial self (I feel things very strongly and often very loudly!) is not hanging onto them too long. That's one of the things [[The Buddha]] has taught me and which I cherish to this day. I cannot seem to stop myself feeling things strongly, but I can stop myself from hanging onto them and ruining my day. So, there's no need to apologize.

> I totally get how it feels alien (I think I'm often an alien speaking with aliens). I'm grateful that you would spend so much energy digesting it; if it turns out not to be fruitful in our relationship, I apologize.

I feel there's some pearls here I hadn't seen when I wrote that journal entry. I think I made a snap judgement at too early a phase. Consider it venting to myself ;)

I'm soldiering on with it, cracking jokes and having fun. I think I'll get to the chickenscratch next, but I'll save actually doing it for the weekend when I have more time for wiki-ing. In the meantime, don't worry about this little chameleon, I'm more resilient than I look!

Your friend,
