title: 2019.08.27 - Prompted Introspection: Arrogance

!! What trait do you most deplore in yourself?

My [[arrogance]]. Sometimes, I have to be Aristotelianly magnanimous. Too often I am certain or take leaps of [[faith]] to which I have no right. It's one thing when my arrogance affects mostly me, but it's another when someone else is paying the price for my evil. It is a hard line to walk.
