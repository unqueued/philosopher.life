title: 2019.06.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Bit of a Joke

!! Respond to the following gem:

I should say that when people talk about capitalism it's a bit of a joke. There's no such thing. No country, no business class, has ever been willing to subject itself to the free market, free market discipline. Free markets are for others. Like, the Third World is the Third World because they had free markets rammed down their throat. Meanwhile, the enlightened states, England, the United States, others, resorted to massive state intervention to protect private power, and still do. That's right up to the present. I mean, the Reagan administration for example was the most protectionist in post-war American history. Virtually the entire dynamic economy in the United States is based crucially on state initiative and intervention: computers, the internet, telecommunication, automation, pharmaceutical, you just name it. Run through it, and you find massive ripoffs of the public, meaning, a system in which under one guise or another the public pays the costs and takes the risks, and profit is privatized. That's very remote from a free market. Free market is like what India had to suffer for a couple hundred years, and most of the rest of the Third World.

Capitalism obtains, and I consider the opening claim irresponsible hyperbole. It's better to say countries and business classes have corruptively harnessed governments as arms of capitalism. The free market gives rise to centralized power, monopolies, and its inevitable self-distortion. It will always contradict itself. Obviously, the suffering brought about through the market is something capitalists and reactionaries aim to externalize, mercilessly exploit, rationalize, and manipulate the rest of us to accept. Indeed, private power is protected; that's what capitalism and governments have generally done since they've existed. That intervention is turbo-charged and perhaps growing unstoppable through automation. At least until possibly GAI, the mindless machines will not rise up, but they replace human labor (including in the protection of capital and elite power) to the extent that we may not be able to rise up what would otherwise be human power in the dialectic. I'm worried the usual contradictions of capitalism can't arise.

Building governments which are radically resistant to centralizing power is one of the goals of socialism. Recursive patterned redistribution which would make Nozick choke on his tomato juice appears to be necessary to that end. Decentralizing the means of production of any form of power is a progressive process. Marx was basically right on that point. I still see Hegel's idealism in that material construction of heaven of Earth.
