title: 2019.04.04 - TDL: Wheels

* Maybe we can wait a day. Low of veggies.
* Parts haven't arrived. I still have cleaning I can do. 
** My son did a good job with the tools.
* Work, ofc. I'm ready for us to chill.
* Much reading to do, and your browser overflows with big projects.
* Feels like spinning my wheels. Lol. Keep going?
