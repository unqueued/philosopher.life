title: 2017.04.10 - Realpolitik Speculation: The Renewable Resource

Do you know there are plenty of non-human creatures which enslave other creatures? There are insects which farm and cultivate other insects as well. Classism is built into the very structure of creatures; it's how we understand the social functions, dynamics, relationships, structures, and emergences of higher orders of those species. Humans are no different in kind, only in complexity on this point.

At some point, we have to see that all species which are capable of this will do this. We have to realize it is written into our DNA, that it just that egoistic, intelligently selfish behavior maximizes utility. Humans farm humans. That's what the Hyperclass does. It uses humanity. They enslave us. They destroy the planet and sacrifice our happiness for their own selfish ends. We are just otherized, objectified things and tools to the kings of the human pyramid. They step on us, program us, throw us away, and keep us in various kinds of morally unjustified coercive cages.<<ref "1">> They farm us to extract our value. 

Seriously, it's why they favor high populations of uneducated poor people (with notable exceptions, at least by appearances). It drives down the cost of labor, just as long as they aren't paying the governmental upkeep costs on maintaining The Human Farm. We are their most valuable "renewable resource." The Most Dangerous Game isn't to kill a human, it's to enslave them. They are very good at playing this game, so good at it that many of us don't even see it for what it is. They slip the yokes on us without us revolting. They have truly "broke" our society in; they've domesticated us into capitalism.
