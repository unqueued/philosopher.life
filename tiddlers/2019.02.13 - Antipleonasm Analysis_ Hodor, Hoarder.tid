title: 2019.02.13 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Hodor, Hoarder

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
If a man has an apartment stacked to the ceiling with newspapers, we call him crazy. If a woman has a trailer house full of cats, we call her nuts. But when people pathologically hoard so much cash that they impoverish the entire nation, we put them on the cover of Fortune magazine and pretend that they are role models.

Preach, yo! Don't you understand? They //need// that much money. There's no such thing as diminishing marginal returns. Furthermore, they have an unconditional right to it. It doesn't matter how many people suffer: they don't owe anyone a god damned thing. That's what self-ownership means, after all: nobody has a claim right to you beyond making sure you don't kill them or steal their property. Surely property rights have nothing to do with consequences, right? 

Property, of course, must simply be the result of legitimate acquisition and transfer, and provisos are a gaslitic lip service to the veneer notion that we are willing to compromise at some later opportunity. Clearly, we must celebrate the centralization of power begotten for the sake of power. If we can brainwash enough people into believing they are temporarily embarrassed millionaires, teach victims to unquestioningly blame their disenfranchisement on themselves, and act like no other power distribution patterns are feasible, we can generate an army of reactionaries sufficiently large enough to act as a giant wall of subdual to prevent the revolution in the material dialectic and force the Overton window into a comfortable window of egoism. No, hoarding isn't an addiction. You see, it only appears to affect others, and there is no such thing as the moral law.

A shitty poem for this momentus occasion:

<<<
There is no moral law.

And even if there were a moral law, it's only a conditional social construct.

And even if it were unconditional, there's no reason to think it applies to me.

And even if it did apply to me, there's no reason to believe it //ought// to override my other desires and reasons.

And even if it were overriding, I've not broken it.

And even if I broke it, I've not really broken it that badly.

And even if I did break it badly, it wasn't a big deal.

And even if was a big deal, it wasn't really my fault.

And even if it was my fault, I didn't mean it.

And even if I did mean it, you deserved it.
