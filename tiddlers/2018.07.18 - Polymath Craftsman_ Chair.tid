title: 2018.07.18 - Polymath Craftsman: Chair

The chair I sit in many hours each day is very well used. It's got a handle for adjusting it into a rocking mode. I don't generally care for it, but I don't want to disable it. Unfortunately, it's worn enough that eventually it slips and my potential energy is released. It's very unpleasant, the feeling of instant falling. My son and I made a duct tape nubbin and taped the other side as well. The real fix would be welding the bar a bit further, but I don't have the equipment.
