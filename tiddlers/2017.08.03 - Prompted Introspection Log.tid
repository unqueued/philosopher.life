!! Why did you end your friendship with Nyles? Why did he make you sad enough to end the friendship? Are you happier because of ending the friendship?

I had been drifting away from Nyles for a while during my depression. I think he was an emotional vampire of sorts. I think he did not return the respect I gave him. 

In part, our interests just diverged. I lost interest in magic, for example. We talked league a bit, but we didn't really play much at the same time. Theorycrafting wasn't as fun. Politics and ethics were kind of one-sided. Our experiences were vastly different. There wasn't much pointing to bouncing ideas off him, and it wasn't worth talking to him. He didn't care what I thought.

His visit with my family cemented my view of him. There was a particular moment in the magic shop that I saw that he just lacked charity and the intellectual integrity to have humility. It was the final straw. I realized who he was and that our relationship wasn't working. I just let him go.

Nobody likes losing a friend. Was it the right choice? I think so. I could be wrong, but I'm not convinced it was a healthy relationship.
