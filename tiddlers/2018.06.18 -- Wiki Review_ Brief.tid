** My children and I talked about this feud today. I've extensively covered how it's not their fault, even though they are affected by it. I've explained my position, that I'm biased, that they will need to see all sides of the story, and that they will have to reflect on it for themselves for quite a while. I assume this will be a topic which will require serious discussion again and again.
