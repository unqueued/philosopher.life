Oh, I keep forgetting to ask.
WED 8:18 PM
How is your face doing?
WED 8:18 PM
You started getting some feeling back. I saw in the video. It looked good.
WED 8:18 PM
That's a great sign, right? I mean...it's supposed to take months sometimes for the lucky 85%
WED 8:18 PM
Also, I forgot to ask (I'm good at forgetting): how's Rebecca doing? She still feeling sad as of late?

Phone tag for a bit. Bro fixed his sink without any of the supplies he bought. I think he was Hank-Hill-bummed a bit not to need to get his hands dirty, but it's probably more of a testament to him just knowing what he's doing in the first place (which, ofc, he will deny).

He was working on his meatloaf and talking about food with me. 

My bro has an 18yo coworker who loves eyebleach. My brother avoids things which make him sad (which I don't always agree with, but I can in this case). 

We talked about my day. Pretty normal. I forgot to ask about his face! Oy. Messaging him.

It was a short but sweet conversation.
