title: Outopos: Voting

//[[2018.01.06 - Philosophipolitical Prescription: Ideal Voting System]]//

How does one engage in effective ranged voting in Outopos? 

Do we really want to directly elect people? It would be so much preferred to be indirect in many respects. Imagine a world in which I assigned values to just the people I know (and anyone I directly sought to rate even if I didn't actually know them [ugh, this seems to be a problem]), and they assigned values to just the people they know, and so on. Can a vote be coalesced from just that information in a decentralized or even federated fashion? Can there be no centralized coalescer while still achieving these goals? Would that be an effectively democratic vote? Could such a system be gamed? How resistant to gamesmanship is this method?

Who does the tallying? Is it possible that my own shard will negotiate a tallier? Can we federalize together? Who is the tallier of talliers? Fuck me.

I need someone with expertise in at least two if not three fields to help me even settle the matter. There doesn't appear to be a good way to do this. 

Sticking to the friend-2-friend model and going nowhere beyond that is about as safe as I can make it. I could at least poll my friends in a vote, leveraging their opinions. This is much easier to do in automated resource-trading game than in the social and political sense over the actual wire.
