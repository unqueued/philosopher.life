Capitalism does not permit an even flow of economic resources. With this system, a small privileged few are rich beyond conscience, and almost all others are doomed to be poor at some level. That's the way the system works. And since we know that the system will not change the rules, we are going to have to change the system.

-- Martin Luther King, Jr.

Capitalism is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone.

-- John Maynard Keynes

<<<
...it was natural and perhaps human that the privileged princes of these new economic dynasties thirsting for power, reached out for control over government itself. They created a new despotism and wrapped it in the robes of legal sanction. In its service new mercenaries sought to regiment the people, their labor, and their property. And as a result the average man once more confronts the problem that faced the Minute Man.

-- Franklin D. Roosevelt
<<<

<<<
Unhappy events abroad have re-taught us two simple truths about the liberty of a democratic people. 

The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State itself. That, in its essence, is fascism -ownership of government by an individual, by a group or by any other controlling private power.

The second truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if its business system does not provide employment and produce and distribute goods in such a way as to sustain an acceptable standard of living.

-- Franklin D. Roosevelt

All things are subject to interpretation. Whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power not truth.

Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.

If a man has an apartment stacked to the ceiling with newspapers, we call him crazy. If a woman has a trailer house full of cats, we call her nuts. But when people pathologically hoard so much cash that they impoverish the entire nation, we put them on the cover of Fortune magazine and pretend that they are role models.

-- B. Lester

<<<
We have to understand very clearly that there's a man in our community called a capitalist. Sometimes he's black and sometimes he's white. But that man has to be driven out of our community because anybody who comes into the community to make profit off of people by exploiting them can be defined as a capitalist.

-- Fred Hampton

There is only one way to achieve happiness on this terrestrial ball, and that is to have either a clear conscience or none at all

-- Ogden Nash

<<<
Economics in the 20th century “lost the desire to articulate its goals”. It aspired to be a science of human behaviour: a science based on a deeply flawed portrait of humanity. The dominant model – “rational economic man”, self-interested, isolated, calculating – says more about the nature of economists than it does about other humans. The loss of an explicit objective allowed the discipline to be captured by a proxy goal: endless growth.

-- George Monbiot
<<<

<<<
Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.

-- Carl Sagan

Referring to your employees as "family" is the corporate equivalent of telling a prostitute "you love her."

As capitalism matures, it's clear to anyone with a thread of financial literacy that most wealth is created through capital gains rather than salary. We're approaching a state (at least in developed countries) where productivity is so high, that you can literally park your money in 500 of the biggest businesses and you're almost guaranteed a 7% annual return (if you hold stocks for the long term).

Using the commonly accepted safe withdraw rate of 4%, if you inherit $3 million (which is not even that much), you can safely collect $120,000 of capital gains/dividend income every year without doing anything. This also frees you up to work on other things that will acquire you even more wealth. People whose parents didn't leave them a large inheritance have to rely on salary, which is taxed at a higher rate and more difficult to earn.

In effect, late stage capitalism becomes the anti-thesis of the spirit of capitalism - devoid of competition, free innovation, and upward mobility. In an ideal capitalism society, the most talented should earn the most, but the compounding effect of capital makes it so that whoever holds wealth the longest earns the most.

When the entirety of your earnings are exhausted on food and shelter, your labors are no longer viewed as an opportunity for economic advancement, but rather as an act of self preservation. In the real world, that’s called Slavery.

States within the global political economy today face a twin insurgency, one from below, another from above. From below comes a series of interconnected criminal insurgencies in which the global disenfranchised resist, coopt, and route around states as they seek ways to empower and enrich themselves in the shadows of the global economy. Drug cartels, human traffickers, computer hackers, counterfeiters, arms dealers, and others exploit the loopholes, exceptions, and failures of governance institutions to build global commercial empires. These empires then deploy their resources to corrupt, coopt, or challenge incumbent political actors.

From above comes the plutocratic insurgency, in which globalized elites seek to disengage from traditional national obligations and responsibilities. From libertarian activists to tax-haven lawyers to currency speculators to mineral-extraction magnates, the new global super-rich and their hired help are waging a broad-based campaign to limit the reach and capacity of government tax-collectors and regulators, or to manipulate these functions as a tool in their own cut-throat business competition.

Unlike classic 20th-century insurgents, who sought control over the state apparatus in order to implement social reforms, criminal and plutocratic insurgents do not seek to take over the state. Nor do they wish to destroy the state, since they rely parasitically on it to provide the legacy goods of social welfare: health, education, infrastructure, and so on. Rather, their aim is simpler: to carve out de facto zones of autonomy for themselves by crippling the state’s ability to constrain their freedom of (economic) action.

Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.

The idea of saviors has been built into the entire culture, beyond politics. We have learned to look to stars, leaders, experts in every field, thus surrending our own strength, demeaning our own ability obliterating our own selves. But from the time to time Americans reject that idea and rebel.

These rebellions, so far, have been contained. The American system is the most ingenious system of control in world history. With a country so rich in natural resources, talent, and labor power the system can afford to distribute just enough wealth to just enough people to limit discontent to a troublesome minority. It is a country so powerful, so big, so pleasing to so many of its citizens that it can afford to give a freedom of dissent to the small number who are not pleased.

There is no system of control with more openings, apertures, let leeways, flexibilities, rewards for the chosen, winning tickets in lotteries. There is none that disperses its control, more from complexly through the voting system, the work situation, the church, the family, the school, the mass media - none more successful mollifying opposition with reforms, isolating people for one another, creating patriotic loyalty.

1% of the nation owns a third of the wealth. The rest of the wealth is distributed in such a way as to turn those in the 99% against one another: small property owners against the propertyless, black against white, native-born against the foreign-born, intellectuals and professionals against the uneducated and unskilled. These groups have resented one another and warred against one another such vehemence and violence as yo obscure their common position as sharers of the leftovers in a very wealthy country.

!! Unknown Homemade:

* We would* hang the capitalists with the rope that they sell us, but if we were to hang the last capitalist, another would appear to sell us the rope. 
* Owners of capital will stimulate the working class to buy more and more of expensive goods, houses and technology, pushing them to take more and more expensive credits until their debt becomes unbearable. The unpaid debt will lead to bankruptcy of banks which will have to be nationalized. 
* Systematic benefits in a society are dispersed from the top down, and its sacrifices emerge from the bottom up.
* Moral employment has all but ceased to exist (if it ever did) because we simply cannot avoid being paid by evil people to support or build projects used for evil purposes.
* Corporately sponsored school programs exist to ease the scarcity of particular functions and lock participants into a climb up the ladder of starvation while distracting them inside a constructed hyperreality narrative. When education is infected by business interests, it fails to develop well-rounded, free as in //liber//, citizens who effectively participate in social, political, and economic life. Education impairs enslavement; it is the key to decentralizing power, socioeconomic mobility, and being paid the real value of your labor.
* Here is why slacking at work isn't theft: they are trying to take you for everything you are worth. They are not making a good faith effort to fairly pay for your labor, so why should you make a good faith effort to give them any more than they've paid for? This is David vs Goliath in a might makes right arena, thus you are entitled to play underhanded. But, in this case, you aren't even taking what wasn't already yours to begin with.
* Pleasurable activities which prevent capitalists from exploiting you will be artificially regulated, censored, legally limited, and socially distorted in order to funnel your pursuit of happiness into channels which those in power control and benefit from.
* Human Resource Departments see you as a vessel of capital wrapped in liabilities which prevent them from fully exploiting you. HR exists to help the company legally (but not morally) extract maximum value from you. Make no mistake: they aren't your friend.
* Loitering is taking up space without spending money.
* Without the vulnerability of physical proximity, your overlords take virtually no risks in exploiting you.
* Those organizations which tend to have higher degrees of cooperation gain a competitive advantage; thus, capitalism induces cooperative power dynamics within corporations to maintain survival fitness in the market. However, this is not the claim that capitalism efficiently generates cooperation which maximizes global utility.
* Psychopathy rises to the top in capitalism because those who compete with their moral gloves on will never maintain competitive advantage over those who don't play by the moral rules. Evolution is selecting for increasingly effective psychopaths to prey upon and enslave humanity.
* Not all prisons have physical bars, and not all slaves wear physical chains.
* Insider trading is only punished because it affects wealthy people.
* A socially liberal fiscal conservative is someone who claims to support civil rights while supporting political economic systems which  trap them into poverty. They receive the benefit of feeling like a good person without actually doing anything to help those in need.
* When the rich rob the poor, it's called business; when the poor fight back, it's called violence.
