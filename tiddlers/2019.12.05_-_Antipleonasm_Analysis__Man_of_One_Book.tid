title: 2019.12.05 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Man of One Book

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
; Cave ab homine unius libri.
: Fear the man of one book.
<<<

That has a split in it. Crucially, a man (1) can have read only one book to be a "man of one book," or the man (2) could have selected to master or rely upon primarily one of many books he's read. We might fear each for different reasons. Further, when ought we fear the one-booked man? It's not clear we should in all cases.

(1) is most likely lacking breadth, in variety, in various kinds of literacy necessary to reason about the world effectively enough. Note, of course, we cannot necessarily blame (1) for only having had a single book to read. Most humans in history have never had a physical book to read (though we might talk about other kinds of literacy), and they are exceptionally at the mercy of moral luck. I tend to be far more worried about those who have access to all the books they want and still have only decided to read one.

(2) provides another kind of problem wherein we have to ask which books are most [[salient]] in various contexts. Not all books are equal in each context or even the context of all contexts. We must weigh and prioritize our books, and that's a deeply problematic task. Someone who has prioritized or even mastered a single book presents a strong point of view which is dialectically sharp. 

Both men may have something in common: they have what may be considered an overly-narrow point of view employing the perspective of a single book. Pointy things can burst our bubbles. Pouring all your marbles into specialized silver-bullet baskets can have significant game-theoretic properties as well. 

Dialectically, we might conceive of the books of all possible books as an interesting choice for the one-booked man. Likewise, reductive books on such a universal book may come in various [[dok]] of [[salience]], and we might fear some one-book men more than others (for various reasons).

I don't fear all persons of a single book. I hold some of them in extremely high regard. Saint Oliver Sensen is a (2)-one-booked man, and it's a powerful [[gem]] through which he understands the world. I'm lucky to have learned from him.
