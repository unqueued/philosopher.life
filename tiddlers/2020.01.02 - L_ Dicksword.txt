I hope today goes well for you all! Good luck with the move and all that.

[[k0sh3k]] makes it sound like some craziness happened, but I’m sure I’ll hear about it when you all have finally settled down. d(￣ ￣)
Jan 2 10:25am
Thank you. I think we're going to need it, lol.
Jan 2 10:30am
Something something you’ll laugh about it one day?
Jan 2 10:33am
Yesterday, while removing the water connections to the washer,  a pipe in the wall burst. It started pouring out of electric sockets, all parts of the ceiling, and I couldn't turn the water main off (and I don't have my tools).
Jan 2 10:33am
Water was eventually turned off by maintenance, and we had to clean up water damage and there was no more water (which makes cleaning difficult, and living).
Jan 2 10:34am
Today, everything is packed. Literally just trying to get our leashed cats into the car. Ranga was fine. [[j3d1h]] let go of Meow, and the cat freaked out and ran into the thornbushes. Took an hour to find her ([[k0sh3k]] was in tears at the thought of losing her cat) and another to eventually get her. Everyone is cut up, but we are on the road.
Jan 2 10:36am
Also, I want to make it easier to stay in touch. Would you prefer we move to Discord for our chats? (I would still like to keep Signal as a backup tool, and a tool I can use when sending you keys/passwords/etc.)
Jan 2 10:37am
Hopefully, we will laugh about this clusterfuck. It is not the worst move I've had, by a longshot.
Jan 2 10:37am
That vacation was wonderful; hard to come back to the rest of reality, lol.
Jan 2 10:41am
I feel that. Sorry for the space — [[K]] had a doctor’s appointment and we’ve been flying around all ever since lol. Sounds like you all DID have quite the adventure!
Jan 2 3:00pm
As far as using Discord, I am more likely to see and respond there but I am also trying to make an effort to reach out to you more this year. So whichever place truly works.
Jan 2 3:00pm
If moving to Discord would be a pain for you, I am content to stay here.
Jan 2 3:01pm
How did the appointment go? Good news, I hope.
Jan 2 3:01pm
Side note: the thought of water pouring out of every socket sounds both terrifying and incredibly surreal.
Jan 2 3:01pm
Yeah, that was weird to see.
Jan 2 3:01pm
It was fine! Basically, she said he was just experiencing acute constipation which is pretty normal when you are doing things you don’t normally do and eating things you don’t normally eat.
Jan 2 3:03pm
Good.
Jan 2 3:03pm
So it sounds like those days of inactivity and eating junk food did a number on him ʅ（◞‿◟）ʃ
Jan 2 3:04pm
Lol. That emoji is wonderful.
Jan 2 3:04pm
You’re welcome ;D
Jan 2 3:05pm
Discord will lower the friction for you. It works on all my devices, so it's not painful to use. As long as we have Signal available (even if we don't use it), then I say we head over to
Jan 2 3:05pm
Discord* (wrote it in Discord too, lol)
Jan 2 3:06pm

[3:05 PM] h0p3: Discord!
[3:06 PM] h0p3: :slight_smile:
[3:06 PM] Sohalia: Or as [[K]] and I call it - Dicksword!
[3:07 PM] h0p3: preach
[3:07 PM] Sohalia: Lol
[3:08 PM] Sohalia: But all in all it’s good to know for the future — we have to walk around a bit or do some form of exercise on vacation just to keep him healthy.
[3:08 PM] h0p3: I should have done more walking too
[3:08 PM] Sohalia: Staying more active is a goal of ours this year anyways, so it works out.
[3:09 PM] h0p3: I am looking forward to finding a walking path out next to our new home.
[3:10 PM] Sohalia: Dude, I am already jealous of the gorgeous things you will see up there
[3:11 PM] Sohalia: Our neighborhood isn’t bad, but it’s not super great for walking.
[3:11 PM] h0p3: Next time I see you, you'll be ripped. You'll be veins and sinew. Shredding phone books (though I do not know where you will find them) and kar-uh-tay chopping iceblocks.
[3:11 PM] h0p3: I think the most important part for me is being able to safely walk in a mindless way.
[3:12 PM] h0p3: I'm usually wandering off in my brain, and I can scarcely pay attention to where I'm going. It's like real life, but wrapped up in this metaphor or something.
[3:13 PM] h0p3: You guys do the dance dance revolution kind of thing? [[K]] seems like he'd enjoy it.
[3:14 PM] Sohalia: We have considered it, though the modern version requires a season pass and it’s annoying.
[3:17 PM] Sohalia: BUT I think it would be a fun way for us to work out together. That’s a good point.
[3:20 PM] Sohalia: Is it weird that I always wanted to be fit in the “flexible lean” sorta way but never really got there? Like the thought of yoga (without all the spiritual hoodoo) really appeals to me, I’ve just never actually made it as far as consistently doing it.
[3:24 PM] h0p3: You keep the bar so high, lol. I'm going to shoot for "still able to tie his shoes" and "can suplex his offspring" when it's clutch.
[3:25 PM] h0p3: I like yoga, but I think the calm meditative aspect is probably what is most valuable about it. Seems to take too long for what you get physiologically.
[3:25 PM] h0p3: Here's what I do with my offspring: https://philosopher.life/#Fitness%20Routine
[3:27 PM] h0p3: Lots of quick stretches to chain together (use these for physical work), and minimal strength training which doesn't require much equipment (pullups being an exception) but hits almost everything.
[3:27 PM] h0p3: I'm supposed to do cardio, but that...that's work.
[3:28 PM] h0p3: I'm going to blame my laziness asthmar
[7:07 PM] Sohalia: That link didn’t work for me for some reason, but I dig what you’ve told me
[7:07 PM] Sohalia: Also, you played a song at the beginning of our trip called “I Fink U Freaky” and I have not been able to get it out of my head since ♪( ´θ｀)ノ
