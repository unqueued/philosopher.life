Hey, how was the date?
MON 5:51 PM
Also, let me know if and when I can try to setup piracy and the VM for you
MON 5:52 PM
Fuck dude. [[JRE]] just told me Jay ghosted you. I'm so sorry. I love you. I wish I could hold you right now.
MON 9:27 PM
I do not understand people.
MON 9:28 PM
I don’t understand either. I don’t know what wrong with me that make people do these things.
MON 9:37 PM
I don't know what's wrong with him. You deserve to be treated with respect.
MON 9:39 PM
You must be in the dumps.
MON 9:39 PM
Your roommate know?
MON 9:40 PM
I want to drink my self into oblivion.   
No she doesn’t
MON 9:40 PM
You should tell her.
MON 9:41 PM
I’m tired of dealing with emotions right now.
MON 9:41 PM
K
MON 9:41 PM
Want to hear a song I found today?
MON 9:42 PM
Please
MON 9:42 PM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxg4C365LbQ
MON 9:42 PM
Maybe it's too simple, but I have to say, it still owns me.
MON 9:44 PM
This would be so cool on a. Surroundsound system
MON 9:46 PM
You have surround sound?
MON 9:46 PM
oh
MON 9:47 PM
nm
MON 9:47 PM
No
MON 9:47 PM
Lol
MON 9:47 PM
Yes, it would be cool
MON 9:47 PM
I found two other songs yesterday.

MON 9:47 PM
did you see the photo on this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5XKTIZ6nUM
MON 9:50 PM
i cant stop looking at it
MON 9:50 PM
aye, that photo is something else!
MON 9:52 PM
thanks for sharing with me. i needed this
MON 9:54 PM
so what did [[AA]] have to say?
MON 9:55 PM
Ha, it's np. I'm glad to have someone to listen to music with.
MON 9:55 PM
also, I have one more that I want you to hear (and then I will stop spamming you)
MON 9:55 PM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY66fdMt4vc
MON 9:55 PM
I think this artist is a genius or something
MON 9:55 PM
i really like the start of it
MON 9:56 PM
It's like a darker Daft Punk
MON 9:57 PM
ha we were thinking the same thing
MON 9:57 PM

MON 9:58 PM
I have not added today's chat yet.
MON 9:58 PM
give me a sec still reading
MON 10:03 PM
better than I thought it would have gone
MON 10:08 PM
brb need to use the restoom
MON 10:08 PM
Yes. She even went out of her way to install Signal. I think it's awesome.
MON 10:09 PM
back.
MON 10:14 PM
cool
MON 10:15 PM
she seems to care but i think im to skeptical to say anything
MON 10:15 PM
It's okay. Let me be the guinea pig.
MON 10:16 PM
You get to watch and see if it's safe to come out.
MON 10:16 PM
Personally, I am convinced.
MON 10:16 PM
It is clear she put some serious thought in her initial response, and her actions continue to back it up to me.
MON 10:16 PM
The only way she could pass the test any higher would be to engage my dissection of the book she sent me, but I'm okay even if she doesn't at this point. She reads the wiki. That alone is enough evidence for me.
MON 10:18 PM
your base line has been met.
MON 10:19 PM
I appreciate your skepticism though, and I'm not saying not to be skeptical. I'm clearly not a good  judge, lol.
MON 10:19 PM
true that!
MON 10:19 PM
i am a bad judge as well.
MON 10:20 PM
/high5
MON 10:20 PM
bad  judges unite

Our theme song is apparently incredibly leet.
MON 10:21 PM
i cant stop cry/lsughing
MON 10:22 PM
this ones interesting i was expecting a big drop but it didnt happen
MON 10:23 PM
i like it tho
MON 10:23 PM
aye
MON 10:23 PM
it is low key
MON 10:23 PM
wish they would remix it
MON 10:24 PM
but then they wouldn't be "bad judges"
MON 10:24 PM
and we'd have to kick them out
MON 10:24 PM
lol
MON 10:24 PM
i needed this laugh thank you'
MON 10:25 PM
ha, it's np. just shootin' the shit
MON 10:25 PM
... never heard this term either  "shootin the shit"
MON 10:25 PM
lol
MON 10:26 PM
you'd think a gay man would know that one
MON 10:26 PM
lol
MON 10:26 PM
right!
MON 10:26 PM
Still on my bucketlist, unfortunately. [[k0sh3k]] will have none of that, lol.
MON 10:26 PM
TMI* ofcc
MON 10:27 PM
she doesn't know what shes missing lol
MON 10:27 PM
rofl
MON 10:27 PM
It's weird because I regularly fuck my own ass. The fact is that prostates are just better for it.
MON 10:28 PM
We get all the fun equipment minus tits.
MON 10:28 PM
(well, I moobs)
MON 10:28 PM
amen
MON 10:28 PM
have*
MON 10:28 PM
lol
MON 10:28 PM
lol
MON 10:28 PM
this is why men are better.
MON 10:29 PM
jk
MON 10:29 PM
^^^^
MON 10:29 PM
i cant tell you how much this helped me
MON 10:30 PM
i needed this
MON 10:31 PM
=)
MON 10:31 PM
sorry not trying to bring the moment down
MON 10:32 PM
Naw, I think it gives it light.
MON 10:32 PM
"gives it light"  i like the way you say that
MON 10:33 PM
you are right
MON 10:33 PM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MmW_GOFS8I
MON 10:34 PM
Maybe that's how I will explore music from now on.
MON 10:36 PM
Just randomly type shit in
MON 10:36 PM
Hope for gold
MON 10:36 PM
the ladys in this vid are  very muscular
MON 10:36 PM
I have grown to appreciate muscular women
MON 10:38 PM
Someone needs to be doing all the pushin, and I'd rather be the one with the cushion.
MON 10:38 PM
lmao
MON 10:39 PM
have you ever watched leo and satan?
MON 10:40 PM
watching now
MON 10:41 PM
yes, [[j3d1h]] showed me this
MON 10:41 PM
or [[1uxb0x]]
MON 10:41 PM
I don't remember
MON 10:41 PM
sugar trip episode
MON 10:41 PM
Watching now
MON 10:41 PM
lol
MON 10:42 PM
I've never gotten to put that sugar on my pancakes before
MON 10:43 PM
lol
MON 10:43 PM
whom ever made this is awesome as fuck
MON 10:45 PM
lol
MON 10:46 PM
I finally finished that letter to kicks
MON 10:50 PM
took me an entire month
MON 10:51 PM
can i see
MON 10:51 PM
well yeah
MON 10:51 PM
=)
MON 10:51 PM
head to FTO (Find The Others) or look up kickscondor
MON 10:51 PM
on your wiki?
MON 10:51 PM
aye
MON 10:51 PM
lol
MON 10:52 PM
I try to put it all there
MON 10:52 PM
Image attached to message
MON 10:55 PM
How did you do this!?
MON 10:55 PM
Google =-)
MON 10:55 PM
I did try making my own ASCII images of The Starry Night.
MON 10:55 PM
It’s beautiful
MON 10:56 PM
There are some details mine captured which were better, but whoever made this nailed it so fucking hard.
MON 10:56 PM
I like how these simple character capture is so effectively.
MON 10:56 PM
Agreed
MON 10:57 PM
I can’t stop looking at it
MON 10:57 PM
Me too!
MON 10:57 PM
I find it mesmerizing
MON 10:57 PM
Dude next time we can trip together we have to look at this
MON 10:57 PM
fuck yeah
MON 10:58 PM
I don't have any experience tripping with ASCII art
MON 10:58 PM
well, very little*
MON 10:58 PM
I don’t either. Heck it might not do anything but worth the try
MON 10:59 PM
my HPPD kicks in pretty easily
MON 11:00 PM
really?
MON 11:01 PM
yup
MON 11:01 PM
ceiling and floor patterns, impressionist paintings, and extremely rigid but detailed patterns give rise to it for me
MON 11:02 PM
I consider it a gift.
MON 11:02 PM
Not everyone does.
MON 11:02 PM
i agree with you
MON 11:02 PM
i wish i could have that
MON 11:03 PM
although i would be distracted a lot i would think
MON 11:03 PM
It is also possible that it has other distortions of the eidetic structures and assumptions about reality I take up, but I cannot tell if you those a gifts, neutral, or maladaptive.
MON 11:04 PM
Sometimes it can be disorienting.
MON 11:04 PM
Reminds me of the disorientation after using VR like [[JRE]]'s Oculus Rift.
MON 11:04 PM
interesting
MON 11:05 PM
I am very glad that we have had the chance to use shrooms
MON 11:05 PM
so i feel stupid
MON 11:06 PM
i was navigating the wiki
MON 11:06 PM
(no reason to feel stupid; the wiki is very poorly constructed...it takes work to get your bearings on it, imho)
MON 11:07 PM
(but, that's okay...wikis can be cool even when they are messy)

I think it makes more sense to do it over text, that way you can read it multiple times
MON 11:20 PM
Yes, I do hear you!
MON 11:20 PM
You use voice, I'll type out the answers.
MON 11:20 PM
or whatever is comfortable
MON 11:20 PM
wow thats fucking loud
MON 11:20 PM
lol
MON 11:20 PM
sounded clean on my end
MON 11:21 PM
i just had the computer to close i think
MON 11:21 PM
ah
MON 11:21 PM
you on your phone typing this?
MON 11:21 PM
nope
MON 11:21 PM
computer
MON 11:21 PM
ah, k
MON 11:22 PM
oh, I misunderstood
MON 11:22 PM
sorry
MON 11:22 PM
cool, so what do you want to change?
MON 11:22 PM
(exploration is also quite useful, but we should work on anything specific you want to change)
MON 11:23 PM

MON 11:22 PM
Cool.
MON 11:23 PM
Sec
MON 11:23 PM
goto here:  $:/ControlPanel
MON 11:24 PM
or the "control panel" button
MON 11:24 PM
Head to the "Info" tab at the top
MON 11:24 PM
Then the "Basics" tab below it
MON 11:24 PM
Then go down to Default Tiddlers and change it to the name you want.
MON 11:25 PM
Then go edit the tiddler named "Root" to the specified name.
MON 11:25 PM
The reason to do this is so that whenever you tiddler is open, the "default" tiddler will be exactly as you've specified
MON 11:25 PM
Btw, your question is excellent, and this is very good practice.
MON 11:27 PM
(also, in case it matters, you can take screenshots with your laptop and send those to me)
MON 11:28 PM

MON 11:28 PM
(the "Prt Sc" button does it)
MON 11:28 PM
Damned good question. Editing special system tiddlers like the control panel requires manually saving (I have no idea why they don't fix that). The encircled checkmark in the top right corner will be "red" (given my color scheme) if the wiki is NOT saved.
MON 11:29 PM
Click it
MON 11:29 PM
[[j3d1h]] and I should have set everything else up for you to automatically save.
MON 11:30 PM
Normally, if a tiddler "saved" then the wiki will automatically save (and automatically upload to the rest of us)
MON 11:30 PM
You need to put double brackets around "Ant's Melody"
MON 11:31 PM
like this: [[Ant's Melody]]
MON 11:31 PM
in your control panel
MON 11:31 PM
ahhh that might be the problem
MON 11:31 PM
The double brackets are the "link" syntax
MON 11:31 PM
Your wiki is being transmitted to me over resilio sync automagically, so I can see from here as well
MON 11:31 PM
If you ever want me to publish this alongside the rest of the family's, you let me know.
MON 11:32 PM
I previously had "https://antsmelody.philosopher.life/" setup (actually, I even had https://antsmelody.life//  setup too, but I couldn't afford to keep paying for it)
MON 11:33 PM
currently, this is entirely private between us, and it will stay that way until you tell me otherwise
MON 11:34 PM
Image attached to message
MON 11:35 PM
that's right
MON 11:35 PM
Completely irrelevant to your task, I need to make one change, in "Title of new journal tiddlers" I suggest it say this: "YYYY.0MM.0DD - $(currentTiddler)$:"
MON 11:36 PM

MON 11:36 PM
check your bookmark in Firefox
MON 11:37 PM
It may be set for "Root"
MON 11:37 PM
just nix everything out after "index.html" in the properties of that bookmark
MON 11:37 PM
(This is not a guaranteed fix, but I believe this is the problem).
MON 11:38 PM
if you give me permission, I will login to your computer as well
MON 11:38 PM
Image attached to message
MON 11:39 PM
yeah, the fix I said is what you need
MON 11:39 PM
change the firefox bookmark
MON 11:39 PM
I hastily set that bookmark up
MON 11:39 PM
Can I give you control of my computer?
MON 11:39 PM
it's my fault
MON 11:40 PM
sure
MON 11:40 PM
You just say it
MON 11:40 PM
and you did
MON 11:40 PM
What do I need to do?
MON 11:40 PM
sec
MON 11:41 PM
k
MON 11:42 PM
sorry, I've learned that nomachine does not update itself correclty on arch; I've already setup the network and tools for you -- I don't believe you need to do anything. I'm updating. Should be able to login. Permission, in this case, just meant a verbal permission.

Can you do that one more time

1 HR AGO
Take your time.
1 HR AGO
I just want to see that you've got it
1 HR AGO
btw, having the wiki in it's own workspace maximized is AMAZING.
1 HR AGO
btw, Resilio sync is working great
1 HR AGO
I can see edits within about 20 seconds
1 HR AGO
Nomachine is much faster, ofc
1 HR AGO
What goes there?
1 HR AGO
Hehe, that blasted Windows key
1 HR AGO
Good. Make sure you get the capitalization correct. "culinary" and "Culinary" are different in TW's eyes
1 HR AGO
I didn’t know that
1 HR AGO
It's important to see that the tag needs to match the name of tiddler which has the snippet of code. Change it however you wish. Make sure they both match.
1 HR AGO
I want to show you why when we have the chance
1 HR AGO
lag
1 HR AGO
Give me sec

1 HR AGO
A lot to learn
1 HR AGO
Yes. And, we are here to help.

What does the open tab mean?
58 MIN AGO
It tells you what is currently "open" in the story river
57 MIN AGO
which, atm, is nothing
57 MIN AGO
Ahhh ik
57 MIN AGO
Ok*
57 MIN AGO
we could also tag all the current tiddlers with "Ant's Melody" and have them automatically generated with link lists....
55 MIN AGO
but, I actually think it's worthy trying to write it by hand until you are sure you want to automate it (and understand exactly what you are trying to automate).
54 MIN AGO
I am missing steps here. I am so sorry that I can’t follow right now.   

I am getting the bare basics here but i am missing something
53 MIN AGO
That's okay. It's a lot to take in.
53 MIN AGO
Right now, you can use the "new journal tiddler here"
53 MIN AGO
and just start adding stuff
53 MIN AGO
I thought I understood but I think I am wrong
53 MIN AGO
That is progress!
53 MIN AGO
To know that you don't know
53 MIN AGO
Seriously, I'm showing you a ton all at once
52 MIN AGO
You are doing fine.
52 MIN AGO
It is better to write it down and figure out how to organize it later than to not write it down at all.
52 MIN AGO
I’m sorry I can’t keep up
52 MIN AGO
Naw, don't feel bad about it.
51 MIN AGO
You have no idea how long it took me to learn some of this.
51 MIN AGO
I think you should be pleased.
51 MIN AGO
Go make a journal in each of those tiddlers.
50 MIN AGO
just say one word in each if you want
50 MIN AGO
That will solidify it for you, imho
50 MIN AGO
Think of this as a big object that you add to and change over a very long time.
50 MIN AGO
It cannot happen all at once.
