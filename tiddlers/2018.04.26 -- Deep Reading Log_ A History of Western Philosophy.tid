title: 2018.04.26 -- Deep Reading Log: A History of Western Philosophy

It's interesting that Russell spends time on the Judeo-Christian tradition. I wasn't sure if he would. I'm glad he does though, as it is clearly fundamental to Western philosophy. 

Augustine was brilliantly batshit on this account. I love it.
