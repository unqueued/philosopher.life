title: 2019.01.30 - Prompted Introspection: Oversleeping Incident

!! Have you ever had an incident because you overslept?

I am positive I have. I'm having a hard time thinking of one off the top of my head.<<ref "t">> I can recall sleep making it so I didn't get to do what I wanted to do. Shit. I must be losing my mind. This is such an obvious question: I should be able to come up with good examples.

<<footnotes "t" "I can recall my old friend [[ALM]] oversleeping and not coming to my wedding ceremony; it was a weird moment. [[MWF]] and [[SLT]] complained that my in-laws were late (the amount of 'unforgivable' murmurs, lol...). No, that day was still amazing.">>
