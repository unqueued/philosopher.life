I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.

I think hate is caused by pain. Of course, we can be wrong about what caused our pain. We can hate for the wrong reason. We can be destructive. Hate, conceptually speaking, is not always wrong, and perhaps it isn't even always a bad thing. Is it bad to hate bad? That is odd to say.

This quote attempts to undermine, to open the door, to help us empathize. I appreciate what it is doing. It is not accurate enough.
