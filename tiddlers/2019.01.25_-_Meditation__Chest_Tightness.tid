title: 2019.01.25 - Meditation: Chest Tightness

Breathing exercises this morning post-foot-routine. I'm glad I do that. I know it's not the hard kind of meditation. I tend to be dazed and relaxed (ish, though sore) when coming out of sleep.

I stretched and flexed like I do on construction sites. I did a few yoga poses. I also did some push-ups (I can sense weakness in my right upper shoulder; usually my wrists hurt first).

I can't get rid of my anxiety, but I am grateful to be able to recognize it and not spiral out with it. I have to gently try again and again to coax my chest and shoulders to relax. The moment I head down a train of thought, they tense up yet again. I am not kicking myself, as my wife has asked. I will just suck at this for as long as it takes. You gotta start somewhere, homie.

I have not walked with my wife. She keeps dodging me here (perhaps understandably). I need to walk.
