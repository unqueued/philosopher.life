Fun grammar lesson I just learned about context changing the meaning of a sentence.  If your girlfriend is rummaging through the qdoba bag to find her food and you say, "I had the corn salsa," it conveys a very different meaning than when you yell it from the bathroom, lol

I'm still thinking about vidya games worth playing together, btw.

I also think it would just be cool to surf the web with you with voice chat or regular messaging.

It has been a highlight of the year for me to be able to play WoW with you.

Most of my surfing is videos, which wouldn't work that well I think
OCT 12 11:16 AM
Kind of a solo activity I think
OCT 12 11:16 AM
That's true, it is more solo-oriented. Though, to be fair, the vast majority of my WoW play was solo.

The kids and I spend an awful lot of our funtime just showing vidyas, talking about memes, etc.
