title: 2019.05.31 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Property Rights

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Property rights are not like other rights, contrary to what Madison and a lot of modern political theory says. If I have the right to free speech, it doesn't interfere with your right to free speech. But if I have property, that interferes with your right to have that property, you don't have it, I have it. So the right to property is very different from the right to freedom of speech. This is often put very misleadingly about rights of property; property has no right. But if we just make sense out of this, maybe there is a right to property, one could debate that, but it's very different from other rights.

I love the attempt at being technical. I get the gist of it, but this is sloppy. There are many kinds of property rights, and the rivalrous aspect of property is not so obviously cut and dry.

More problematically, all Hohfeldian rights clusters in the material world can be described as variants of property rights, including free speech. Descriptions of what is politically owed and to whom will fit physicalist specifications. To say I have a political right to stand on the public sidewalk and tell passersby they're going to heaven or hell is to say others have a political duty to me not to prevent me from doing so to some set of specifications. Among the many ways you could shut me up, you aren't legally allowed to push me off the sidewalk, gluegun my mouth shut, or set off explosives next to me (though these are true even if I weren't speaking). If the law is followed, you won't be able to get police officers to eliminate my right to speech either, and that can be understood in terms of a large set of rights to physical objects (including our own bodies and voices).

There are legal ways to interfere with free speech. We do ostracize people for saying things we don't like. We use our power to incentivize and disincentive many kinds of behavior at large. Freedom comes in degrees here.

Lastly, to some extent, I am property to myself. That which is a property of someone can still be a rightsbearer. At least some property has a right.
