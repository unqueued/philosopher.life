title: 2019.04.23 - Wiki Review: GoT is Hilarious

* [[Tutoring Bidness]]
** I'd rather give it away for free to those who can't afford it.
* [[2019.04.22 - BDS97: Mockups]]
** I'm super doubtful that the purpose and ideology of [[Atropos]] won't be immediately obvious. He clearly knows more than I do though, so I'm going to think more about it.
* [[How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy]]
** It is my honor to speak with [[Sphygmus]]. She seems like she's doing well to me. She also gave me the idea to instead go for microdosing on the tab.
*** Also, pipe for DMT and Salvia plant, homie!
* [[I Am h0p3]]
** I think this still has more editing to go.
** Is it a coincidence that I have a stranger who has visited my qTox home today? If are you reading this, I am listening. Welcome, nomad!
* [[Family Time]]
** The most difficult part is getting the kids to sit and talk with each other. 
* [[checkbob.sh]]
** We had considered going the systemd route. Meh. 
* [[2019.04.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: GoT]]
** Completed.
** GoT has been garbage for several seasons, and the clusterfuck is so funny, I'm now back to enjoying the show again. They can't resolve it, they keep throwing nostalgia and characters on the screen haphazardly, and the plot doesn't make any sense. It's forced. You can't live up to the first season.
* [[2019.04.22 - TDL: Plate]]
** I love when I've already knocked out most of my list by midday.
* [[2019.04.22 - Wiki Review: Congeal]]
** There continues to be a war of the [[title.Title]] of the family log.
* [[2019.04.22 - Prompted Introspection: Family Time]]
** My brother has been in my thoughts quite a bit!
* [[2019.04.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Tet]]
** Edited.
** I'm interested to see what my offspring start saying in their own [[Antipleonasm Analysis]].
* [[2019.04.19 - Tasha: Bday]]
** I'm convinced he wasn't interested from the discussion yesterday.
* [[2019.04.21 - Tasha: Yall]]
** We talked with them for a while yesterday. Talked about a range of things, including teenagers. 
* [[Encrypted: Killcoin]]
** You are welcome, sir.
