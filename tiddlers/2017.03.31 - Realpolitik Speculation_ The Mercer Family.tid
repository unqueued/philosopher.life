title: 2017.03.31 - Realpolitik Speculation: The Mercer Family

I've been dancing around this family for a while. I've noted many times how much power Bannon has, and I've even touched on [[Cambridge Analytica|2017.02.14 - Realpolitik Speculation: Automated Memetic Warfare]]. Both are funded by the Mercer Family.

Essentially, the computational Hedge-Fund Manager Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah are part of the core reason for how Trump was elected president. They are dark-money demagogues. Think 21st century Rupert Murdoch meets the Koch brothers, but quieter and far more intelligent in some respects (but just as crazy). They may be the most successful supporters of the Alt-Right we've seen so far. They obviously know how to spend their money effectively (except for that whole Cruz thing). They are incredibly talented at betting on the market, and it seems like they have the knack for political betting as well (not these two are that far apart). Their goals are terrifying, and they are sadly very successful at achieving their goals. 

Let's see, they:

* bankrolled Bannon and Breitbart. 
* bankrolled Kellyanne Conway's superPAC.
* injected David Bossie from Citizens United into Trump's campaign team.
* invested in Cambridge Analytica, and are clearly committed to memetic warfare against the People of the world.
* painted Hillary as corrupt; produced the hit piece book entitled //Clinton Cash//.<<ref "1">> 
* have masterfully herded, converted, and redirected the growing insurgency and discontent with the hyperclass towards red herrings and into the arms of Trump.
* had Rebekah planted in Trump's transition team.

 The Mercer's, alongside Putin, are in non-trivial ways responsible for the mass psychosis we're experiencing in the United States (and perhaps the West at large). Of course, controlling POTUS is not the same thing as controlling Congress itself (the much more powerful political body). I have no idea how much power the Mercer's ultimately wield, especially considering how effectively private and secretive they've made their lives.

<<footnotes "1" "Let me be the first to throw stones at the Clintons. They are corrupt. However, we should still be worried about the Mercer's fairly absurd propaganda. I believe the Clinton's are war-criminals, and murderers too, but Bob Mercer thinks they are murderers in the more standard sense too, lol. Maybe he knows something I don't (and he very well could), but the evidence isn't there.">>
