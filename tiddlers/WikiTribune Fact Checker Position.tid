title: WikiTribune Fact Checker Position

To Whom It May Concern,<<ref "t">>

I respect the truth. That's why I became an academic philosopher.<<ref "p">> I'm not a journalist, and I've never been a professional fact checker, but I do know what it means to charitably seek neutrality in writing papers, interpersonal dialectics, and research. My family, friends, and students have often turned to me for researching and fact-checking claims in many arenas. I want to do it for Humanity.

I strongly appreciate the value of wikis. You're reading my unconventional personal wiki right now, and I'm radically transparent.<<ref "k">> Here's my [[Master Curriculum Vitae]]. Please explore this wiki to gain as much perspective on who I am as you wish.<<ref "h">>

WikiTribune is first discussed on my wiki here: [[2017.04.25 - Realpolitik Speculation: Rectifying Our News Process Disintegration]]. I've been using WikiTribune as one of my sources of information for my [[Link Log]] since [[2017.11.29|Filterlist: WikiTribune]]. I value the work you do because I use it! You're key to my [[hyperreading stack|Link Log: The Stack]]. I personally need you to succeed, and more importantly, I think many lives are on the line if you fail.

While my political and moral perspectives are radical, I strongly value neutrality in journalism. Something has to serve as an epistemic core and neutral starting place, and WikiTribune fits that crucial purpose. I think WikiTribune is part of the means to respecting the dignity of Humanity. ''Please give me a chance''. Let me throw myself into this vocation!

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
