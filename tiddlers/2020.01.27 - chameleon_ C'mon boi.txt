Please don't waste your time on chess. C'mon boi, don't be a fool.
[4:09 PM] chameleon: Hehehe
[4:09 PM] h0p3: Lol
[4:09 PM] h0p3: So tempting
[4:09 PM] h0p3: I have so much I need to get done though.
[4:09 PM] chameleon: I was warned by a player at a chess club "this game will eat up your life"
[4:09 PM] chameleon: That's why I stopped taking it seriously =w=.
[4:10 PM] chameleon: We can have a game sometime if you're not too busy
[4:20 PM] h0p3: ran into something neat: https://forums.hipinion.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=134083
[4:26 PM] chameleon: Haha, nice
[4:26 PM] chameleon: No-one talking about my wiki yet =w=.
[4:29 PM] h0p3: I never know who will be interested in the wiki (or why).
[4:30 PM] chameleon: It's a mystery
[4:30 PM] h0p3: Usually, I'm pretty saddened to see that the people who call themselves my friends barely even look at. I think you have to be the sort of person who likes text?
[4:31 PM] h0p3: Do your friends and family read yours increasingly?
[4:31 PM] chameleon: Maybe they haven't taken the time to learn the format (core daily requirements and such)
[4:31 PM] h0p3: (mine generally don't...too weird and too much work for them)
[4:31 PM] chameleon: My husband doesn't read it
[4:32 PM] h0p3: It took a while for my wife to become interested in it.
[4:32 PM] chameleon: An irl friend showed interest but no idea if they actually checked it out
[4:32 PM] chameleon: I honestly don't know who my readers are :)
[4:32 PM] chameleon: Apart from you and kicks, really
[7:14 PM] h0p3: I am a fan of being able to switch between [[New]] and [[Recent]]. As your reader, I would definitely use the "open all" macro (saves me a couple a clicks, so not a huge deal).
