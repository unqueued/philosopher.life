*** Looking into it.

*** Oh, Nautilus, I love you. If I had money to pay for the content I consume, I'd surely pay you.
*** A topic I am always interested in. What the author is pointing towards is the spectrum of psychopathy. He explicitly points, but he can't go around accusing (that would make him a jerk, right?). 
*** Here's an important line of argument he didn't present you: psychological egoism is a descriptive fact. What emerges from it are higher ordered kinds and degrees of seemingly altruistic and psychopathic beliefs, desires, and behaviors. Essentially what the author really should be talking about is how we deal with the desire to escape feeling the pain of others. He needs fundamental metaethical reasons to rule out the conceptual possibility of the normative acceptability of psychopathy to any degree or kind and barring that, he needs a justification for line drawing on that spectrum. Without it, all he is doing is pointing his finger at you, hand-waving, and ultimately virtue signaling.
*** He's right that empathy is the key to not being a jerk (i.e. moving away from psychopathy towards altruism), but there are other normative content claims about how we use the ability to feel what others do (lots of kinds of claims). Empathize in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, etc.
**** It is weird to see that there are varying degrees and kinds of empathy in psychopaths, and perhaps we must say the same about altruism.
*** Let me add, this is the kind of claim in ethics that we all want to agree to. It's popular with everyone. Sometimes for the right reasons, but not always.

*** I understand the desire to cough up the redpill as a description. It is hard to envision a prescription that isn't selfish about it. It's like I'm asking us to be who we aren't, to do the impossible. Lol.

*** Agreed. I'm also poor at MOBAs, imho. It took me ~200 games to reach Platinum-5 in League; I'm not very good at it, despite trying hard (it's very frustrating for someone who is generally naturally good at anything he applies himself to). My excuses: it's radically different to me from other kinds of games, I despise the controls (let me rant on this), and I learn things through meta-analysis, not in-game play. I research and study, but I don't have the guttural skill. I'm also highly tunnel-vision oriented, unable to see the full map with consistency (even after practice). This is part of the reason my ELO is Diamond in competitive ARAM, but Summoner's Rift is much lower. I have a difficult time understanding how others are going to think and behave except when I'm putting myself in their shoes, doing the "what do I think is rational?" to-and-fro dance with myself. I can only do that effectively in some cases but not others. Something is missing to my intelligence, something crucial.

*** Ah, this is the archetypal category for bloomberg...
*** So, let me guess, you want to strip away other forms of taxation, especially since the vast majority of the wealthy's capital isn't in land.
