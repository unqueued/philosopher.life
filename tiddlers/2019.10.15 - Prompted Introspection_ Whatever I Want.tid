title: 2019.10.15 - Prompted Introspection: Whatever I Want

!! If you could do whatever you wanted to right now, what would you do?

Couldn't be more timely: [[2017.12.23 - Prompted Introspection Log: Wish]]. Sounds about right to me.

If I could do whatever I wanted to right now, I might fall asleep. I'd rather be sleeping than writing this late at night. I wish I had done my writing earlier in the day rather than waiting. If I could snap my fingers and solve all le problems, I would probably still have problems to solve on the treadmill.
