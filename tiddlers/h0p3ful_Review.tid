!! About:

//I love you.//

Accountability is expensive. We've worked hard to get here, [[WINTCIS]]. I [[hope]] we use this practice to embed our wikis in our lives more effectively. Making it a kneejerk habit is no simple task.

!! Principles:

* Do a [[Wiki Review]] for your offspring.
* Don't forget [[Yearly Cross-section]] commentary (from the outside).
* Do it live, side-by-side if you can. Talk. Code review together.
** Stream isn't as good, but we should practice.

!! Dreams:

* I'd like to see tiddler linking automatically handled in some fashion. 
* Could automate the push from wiki to wiki.
* Find a way to make [[Wiki: Chromium Setup]] to have zero hiccups with offspring's wikis.
