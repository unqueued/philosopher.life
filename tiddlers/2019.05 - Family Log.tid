!! Audit:

* I can tell my children did most of the writing. I am glad they did.
* Letter-writing has been emotionally intensive and I've not been great at it. What's new? =)
* We've started a lot of projects with the kids.
** Psychology instead of pure CS.
** Omegle
** [[Clicker Heroes]]
** [[Greek & Latin Roots]]
** Library volunteering Fridays
** Swimming and [[Fitness Routine]]
* My son is enjoying his computer, and my daughter isn't enjoying hers. 
* My offspring are quick to be thankful for when they are given concrete things.
* I adore that my son works on egalitarian thought. I hope he never gives up.
* It's amazing to me that we still had [[Family Time]] even at the hospital. 
* As usual, the kids are in good health and the adults are not. I'll take it!
* I'm so glad we do this log. It doesn't capture [[Family Time]], but it's a pulse. There are many pulses in my wiki.
