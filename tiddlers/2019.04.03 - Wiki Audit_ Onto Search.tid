title: 2019.04.03 - Wiki Audit: Onto Search

I adore [[Firmcoding]] and the buttons we can build with them. We're taking a break on automating [[Prompted Introspection]] because we have much bigger fish to fry in [[Search of h0p3]]. The fact is that dumb users like me would greatly benefit from a visual abstraction for building arbitrarily complex filter expressions and hybridizing search tools together. This is what is amazing about Locator; it's a visual way to narrow searches, and that's exactly what I want on [[FO]]L steroids.

Stuck Commander in the Control Panel (tagged and added caption), and also changed Computer Musings + /b/ to `accu-rel-lists` firmcoding. Basically, it's the same as `rel-lists`, except it only shows the stuff from/including a set date onwards - currently, set to 2019.04.01.
