[06:07:56] Tjandamurra: "Deviation from the normal". What is "normal"? Depends if the sample was skewed. And skewiness is hard to determine without having the whole population in the calculation, not just a sample of the population. 
[16:59:52] h0p3: Aye. I hear that. The quote also uses the word "norm," which is more concerned with standards or rules which we're typically expected to abide by.
[17:01:36] Tjandamurra: And who decides what the "norm" is? Seems to be that the norm for the rich and political class is much different to those down the food chain.

[pending] h0p3: I am deeply concerned with how we fairly determine the standards we live by. It is common for those with power to construct laws which protect and continue to centralize that power in the hands of the few. Similarly, social conventions are always shaped fairly. 
[pending] h0p3: I'm especially concerned with how we justify coercion and normativity.
[19:00:38] Tjandamurra: I agree. Everyday see examples of this in our country where corruption and lies from the politicians is accepted and not challenged by the complient main stream media and yet innocents are hounded. Now some industry groups are calling for wage theft not to be a jailable offence, and yet if an employee takes from the till, they go to jail for a crime. Seems often that there are 2 sets of laws and norms - one the rich, who have it all, and another for the precariat/unnecessariat.
[19:03:18] Tjandamurra: https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/10/28/wage-thieves-jail/ . To me, theft is theft and underpayment of wages is theft. Same as non-payment of superannuation which is like your social security deductions.
[19:04:48] Tjandamurra: More protests from extinction rebellion, and I say good on them. https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/state/vic/2019/10/29/tense-scenes-outside-melbourne-mining-conference/
[pending] h0p3: Preach, yo! =)
[pending] h0p3: I should add that theft and ownership become complex objects and processes to safely reason about, particularly when it comes to justification. The problem you bring up ('And who decides what the "norm" is?') is crucial. There is an ideal objective answer (which perhaps we never reach), but we can be practical in reaching for the best possible answer available to us here. 
[pending] h0p3: Just to illustrate the problem, the homeless mother who walks into the superstore and //takes// the baby formula to feed her hungry child has not stolen what wasn't already owed to her (it was already hers). It is theft given the legal positivistic sovereign's definition, but moral ownership is all that can be justified.
