** Excellent read. Everybody should study the history of computing.

** Let's be clear, AI building AI within set parameters and with working building blocks we've already constructed. It will be a much larger leap forward for AI building AI to generate its own kind of meta, parameters, building blocks, etc. Human involvement is still key at this point. The full-blown accelerated singularity isn't here yet, yo.
** We should be worried about this kind of move though. The further away these block-box programs design each other, with less and less human influence and say-so, the more ethical lines will be crossed. We will not even see it, and we will not be able to understand it, until it is too late. You should be very worried about AI evolving out of our moral parameters when we are designing AI to escape our human parameters on purpose.

** I'd like to caution that even these people have been discriminated against, they are just too stupid to realize it, or too willfully-ignorant to accept the possibility. 
** I think comedians, philosophers, journalists, and truth-tellers are also exempt. But, overall, this is likely quite right. At least in my poor experience, I find that people who knee-jerk react against PCness are privileged and idiotic in a particular way.
