title: 2019.01.18 - Afterschool Teaching: TGIF

I think I forgot to mention, but we had a snowday (or, the mere prediction of snow caused schools to be let out early). Cool.

Whitney and I discussed the inspection. I can appreciate her mixed feelings, confusion, and a desire to please everyone. We walked though the distinction between social convention (including what it takes to keep the job) and moral law. Since I'm completely new, I'm still following their lead (including here). She either follows the standard which we are held accountable to in keeping our jobs (and then the conflict above us will have to deal with it or explicitly lower the standard [or step on us]) or we take the rationing and order of the food served (since much of it is already going bad) into our own hands. Without more information, I think she can reasonably choose either way. She wants to follow the rules and let management deal. Cool. I'm with her; unified front in this case.

Whitney and I discussed the difficulty of actually teaching anything given the conditions available to us. The downtrodden have so few resources. It was overly optimistic to think I would be able to teach them much of anything. It is easier with the older kids, but it doesn't appear solvable. I can appreciate being so tired after being in school for 7-8 hours. Another 3 hours is just not going to happen without profoundly voracious students. I despise the pragmatic here. It is costly to their identities.

Whitney asked me how much I made, and she was disappointed that is wasn't a leap up from what she makes (college student). She felt like I should earn more given my credentials, and I responded that we both should earn more because we both had a right to a living wage (that's a fine start with folks; it's hard to get them to see more is possible and morally required). She laughed about the fact that I'm the most educated person in the building but made so little and also wasn't considered qualified to teach. Yeah. I hear ya. Socioeconomic signaling is a game of lies in Capitalism.

She might not be bright, but she actually cares about those kids. That woman deserves so much more credit and income than she gets.

7Sf continues to come into the room early to leave her stuff. She's not supposed to, but she adores exercising her teacher's pet privileges. 

Mitchell has confirmed my opinion about the 5th and 6th graders, and he is beginning a more radical approach. Interestingly, Whitney is taking the younger group today. I do not understand why. 

I can guarantee that some of the 5th graders have complained about my style, `/shrug`. I am glad to see at least a tad more honesty. I had a teacher tell me these were the worst 5th and 6th grade classes they've had in a while.

VP Mitchell has continued to make moves I like again and again. He has recognized that 5NP needs to be isolated. That kid is a contagion that (in his words) "feeds on every person in the room." That is a fascinating phrase. I concur, doctor.

Friday is designed to be a chill day. Older kids had no homework, and they wanted the computer lab. I offered to help the highschool helper with her homework, but she was uninterested. 

Eventually, I chatted with Mitchell. He's a careerist, but he makes sane arguments. He's not interested in the truth, but he does have effective means to ends reasoning about some pragmatic aspects of teaching. We walked each other through a glance of our histories. We talked about each age range (and I had several questions for him), he explained the restructuring of many things since he was appointed VP, and I got to watch him interact with parents. He's a smooth operator. Considering he has been doing this longer than I've been alive, I'd predict so.

I figured out why I was oddly handed the easy upperclassmen today (that's not Whitney usually). Matt and possibly Whitney(?) had surprise guest speakers come in to present (to the lowerclassmen) Jordan-Peterson-esque doubletalk prosperity gospel, including Christian proselytizing in their script (which I nabbed out of disgust [Jesus would have been flipping tables]), solid nationalism, and (I shit you not) an explanation of why you shouldn't value yourself except insofar as you are productive in the workforce (that was half the seminar). Of course, it was fun and games, and Matt and Whitney are hyping that shit up. I've been to enough religious brainwashing events to know it when I see. I'm all for getting kids to study comparative religion and start asking the real questions in life (we don't do a good job). That's not what this was by any stretch. Matt, of course, tried to get rid of me instantly when I stumbled upon the scene.
