title: 2018.05.04 -- Polymath Craftsman: Testing

Checking the thermometer on my "study" bottles. I'm aiming for the low to mid 90's. Too cold or too hot is a fail.

I took out my electrician tools, cleaned them up, and put on my special anti-rust oil on them. I want them to last for a long time. I also removed some objects which weren't clearly useful to me.
