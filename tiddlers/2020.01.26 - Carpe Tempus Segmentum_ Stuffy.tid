title: 2020.01.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Stuffy

* Woke at 10:15
** Stuffy. Doesn't feel like enough, it should be.
* Did not head out with fam, but saw them off.
* Read
* Fireman Time!
* Chess
* Trying not to eat like a pig. 
** Fruits, veggies, or fast. Doubt I'll keep it up, but it annoys me that a pair of my pants are too snug.
* A sad conversation in which my offspring observed that my anger is likely to overlap or that my fuse is more likely to be shorter for both of them when one has already lit it. =/.
* Called [[Charlie]]
* Called my brother, [[JRE]], and he called back.
** Everyone is healthy. Woot!
** Social worker said two people are looking to take custody, but one failed the test. The remaining candidate, the boy's grandma, is sick and on a fixed income; she may fail the test as well. If so, the boy goes up for adoption. It was awesome to hear my brother warmly hoping for the possibility of being able to adopt the boy.
** We talked some dumb shit, and my brother had to go. 
* Family Time!
** Prepped
** Sat and talked in our living room.
** Family Walk
*** Went and grabbed potatoes and other things.
**** On the way back, someone pulled over on the side of the road to ask if we needed a ride. We do look like a poor bunch, especially carrying a sack of potatoes, lol. That was generous of them.
*** Modeling together
* Ribs, wedges, salad, and even cake! Lol.
* Read+Write
* Chess
* Tried going to sleep at 2...
** I fucked up laying on my belly. I'm a belly sleeper, and I miss it so much. Coughing fit lasted until 5:30am. Fuck me.
*** I don't remember when I actually fell asleep.
