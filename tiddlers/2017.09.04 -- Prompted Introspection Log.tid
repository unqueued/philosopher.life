!! Your male donor, MWF, thinks you are Libertarian. Is he right?

For now, given my understanding of it, no. I fight not to be one. I grant only what I must. There are, of course, many definitions.

Even a philosopher not paying very careful attention to my argument could easily mistake my Thesis and Dissertation as arguing for Libertarianism in many respects. 

While it was empathizing with the Libertarian, arguing from his own positions, that allowed me to show why Libertarianism fails to uphold IP, that doesn't mean I'm a Libertarian. Far from it. 

It appears these people do not associate Libertarianism with capitalism strongly enough. They do not see that one can be a socialist that denies intellectual property, censorship, and many kinds of authority (without giving up being able to agree to an ideal, maximally and fairly empathic government). 

Meh, I don't think he's right. I don't think he really knows what it means. He has a Pauline addiction to obeying those in authority. That's his fundamental problem here, and it has twisted his conception of the world around him.
