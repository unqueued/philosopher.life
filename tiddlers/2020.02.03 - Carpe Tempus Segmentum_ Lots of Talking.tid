title: 2020.02.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Lots of Talking

* Woke at 10
* [[JRE]] called me from the road. 
** He's got the day off. Asked to speak with my offspring. Neat.
* Read+Write
* Dialecture
* CS Projects with offspring
** I don't know how to make projects they can work on together. And, as far as group work goes, my son is not consistent in attempting to pull his weight (and I don't wish to weigh my daughter down unjustifiably).
* Dialecture
* Read+Write
* Called [[JRE]]
* Walked with wife
* [[k0sh3k]] made us breakfast for dinner. 
* //Battlestar Galactica//
** We are trying again. =)
* Nap
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Tried sleeping for hours, and I didn't follow my own advice for insomnia. 
** Fool. =)
* When my wife woke, we talked shit about Iowa.
* Sleep by 6:45?
