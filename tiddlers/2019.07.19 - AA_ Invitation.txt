[[AG]] and I got sunburnt—hopefully your kidlets did not
FRI 2:23 PM
[[AG]] is a lobster—I just have a little on the shoulders
FRI 2:24 PM
[[k0sh3k]]'s been getting burned really fast lately too. Like, 10 minutes out in the sun sometimes can make her red. Aloe ftw.

Thank you for taking them. I think they had a blast these past two weeks.
FRI 2:26 PM
Yep me too
FRI 2:26 PM
Oh good. [[AG]] had so much fun with them

I enjoyed talking with [[j3d1h]] —[[1uxb0x]] was good too just not as talkative
FRI 2:27 PM
He has ups and downs. Sometimes he is as talkative as I am.
FRI 2:27 PM
If [[AG]] would ever like to stay with us, that would be great. She can have [[1uxb0x]]'s bunk.
FRI 2:28 PM
She would like that

We are homebodies, but I don't think that would drive her insane.
FRI 2:28 PM
She is a homebody too
