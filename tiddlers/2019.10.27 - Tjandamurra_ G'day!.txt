[15:36:51] Tjandamurra: G'day there. Interesing website but a bit confusing to navigate my way around - mostly ancient I be.
[16:44:04] h0p3: Heyas! It's a pleasure to meet you.
[16:44:44] Tjandamurra: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/27/australian-bird-of-the-year-2019-vote-for-your-favourite?CMP=soc_568&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1572208616
[16:44:51] h0p3: I'm sorry the site is hard to navigate. It's not just you. I don't know how to make it easier to navigate at all.
[16:45:26] Tjandamurra: It is OK, just have trouble with my ancient brain accepting new ideas and concepts but I will get there. 
[16:45:52] Tjandamurra: The link is for checking out Australia's Bird of the Year 2019 if you care to read
[16:46:02] h0p3: Aye. Looking through it.
[16:46:25] h0p3: Do you have one you've voted for?
[16:46:38] Tjandamurra: Some awesome birds there. Many of them we have here where I live, but many are from the coast and down south. Not yet, still pondering my decision.
[16:47:43] h0p3: I find birds fascinating, though I do not understand enough about them. They are crucial examples of many things I aim to understand about nature.
[16:48:01] h0p3: There is a cool book on them which you might enjoy (let me know if you need a copy): https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Birds-Jennifer-Ackerman/dp/0399563121
[16:48:26] Tjandamurra: Superb Fairy Wren I reckon. They live around here, and often visit, hopping around our feet looking for food. I live in the bush. We have about 600 acres of native forest bordering a National Park of about 80,000 acres.
[16:49:19] h0p3: Wow. That's awesome. 600 acres is a ton.
[16:49:58] h0p3: I live in Johnson City, TN, US.
[16:50:10] Tjandamurra: Birds are very smart and many are good at problem solving. Crows have worked out how to eat cane toads and not die. They flip them on their backs, and attack via stomach to avoid the poison glands on the backs of the toads. 
[16:50:30] Tjandamurra: I can say your state name, but not spell today.
[16:50:36] h0p3: I live on a mountain top in a small apartment with many other people around me. They installed non-native trees which are dying, but the woods around us are gorgeous.
[16:51:37] Tjandamurra: If you use google maps, search for Beebo Qld and swap to satellite view, and you will see the country where we are. Upstream along the border river, is a feedlot with 75,000 head on feed destined for Japan.
[16:51:48] h0p3: Crows are strong teleological, instrumental reasoners. They are highly social too, with excellent long-term memory, and they can even communicate representations of states of affairs (even the appearance of enemies and predators) to others, including their young. It appears they might have an oral tradition!
[16:52:40] Tjandamurra: Because of the drought here, native trees are all dying along the ridges. Desertification is enroaching rapidly. The fires on the east coast, are in rainforest areas, so dry that they are like tinder boxes
[16:53:54] Tjandamurra: Yep crows are smart bastards. They will sit in the trees, when I walk out even with stick in my hand. But the moment the stick is a rifle, they disappear. They used to steal our baby chickens when we had chooks. Just like the big goannas did.
[16:55:44] h0p3: Ah, yes, that sucks. Does this pose a threat to your residence?
[16:56:10] h0p3: Also, you are out in the boonies. Your internet connection pretty decent out there?
[16:56:32] Tjandamurra: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jandamarra - where my handle comes from. No fires around here at present thankfully, but dry lightning storms forecast for next few days. I have satellite connection but don't get the speeds I pay for.
[16:57:05] Tjandamurra: The managers of the national park do regular low intensity burns to keep the fire load low, and maintain all the firebreaks well.
[16:59:03] Tjandamurra: After breakfast, todays job is carting water for us and the native animals and birds. There is a big pool on the river crossing into the next state. I will need 3 or perhaps 4 loads of 2000l (err about 400 gallons per load)
[17:00:15] h0p3: You using barrels to transport it?
[17:00:40] h0p3: Do you have to treat the water?
[17:01:02] h0p3: And, how often do you need to cart water?
[17:02:18] Tjandamurra: Many in the local towns have fibre to the premises, but out here, our phone exchange is too old to be upgraded to ADSL and we live too far it. So satellite is the only option. I use what I know as IBC - 1000l plastic container in a steel tubing frame. No the water is only used for plants, animals and toilet flushing. We still have rainwater for cooking drinking washing dishes and clothes. I have to cart 2 loads every week, 
[17:03:06] Tjandamurra: The roos (kangaroos and wallabies) are drinking about 300l per day out of stock troughs
[17:04:20] Tjandamurra: They are so skinny, and many are dying from lack of feed. The storms are going way to the north of us or way to the south and we are missing out. No local farm work for past 3 season now, as no crops planted.
[17:05:58] h0p3: This is a shitty question, but does there come a point where it gets bad enough that you might have to migrate? If so, how worried are  you about this?
[17:06:41] h0p3: Also, aside, I adore your quote: "Blessed are the cracked for they let the light shine in" more than I am able to quickly explain to you. It's gorgeous to me.
[17:07:45] Tjandamurra: Not at all, have been thinking about it. But where to go? that is the problem. too expensive living in towns and cities and most have the same water problems we have or soon will have. Many towns within 300km radius will be out of water by xmas. Water is being carted into many others already.
[17:08:52] Tjandamurra: As long as we have rainwater, will be OK. New bores (I think you call them wells) are being drilled for local water supplies, and I can buy from there. But being on pension, it is just another expense that is hard to stretch funds for.
[17:09:07] Tjandamurra: I think it is a Spike Milligan quote.
[17:10:05] h0p3: Long-term, global warming and the crisis of capitalism pose a significant threat to your way of life.
[17:13:05] Tjandamurra: It pays to have a good sense of humour - it helps the days go by. I think capitalism and neoliberalism is destroying the planet, not just here. I have recently come across a book Donut Economics by Kate Raworth, that combines the 9 planetary boundaries as well as social measures that we need to have to have a chance of survival.

[17:13:28] h0p3: Thank you for the link. =)
[17:14:32] h0p3: My sense of humor is a work in progress. Super painful.
[17:15:24] h0p3: I apologize for doing this mid-conversation, but I have to leave for a few hours for Family Time (https://philosopher.life/#Family%20Time). I sometimes do not respond immediately (though I aim to be available for realtime chats). I am grateful for all messages you leave me, and I will respond when I have the chance.
[17:16:08] Tjandamurra: I have 2 dogs, a red and a blue heeler or australian cattle dogs. They are going off at present barking at something I have not seen or heard. All good mate, I do understand as it is tucker time (breakfastO for me. I will do, and share some photos as well of the country here, and where we have travelled.
[17:16:19] Tjandamurra: Thank you for the chat. Namaste.
