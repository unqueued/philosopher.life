title: 2018.10.29 - World of Warcraft: Eudaimonia

Back to my old drug. Was going to try a new class, but frankly, I'm pretty set on a priest.

Hail //Eudaimonia//, Undead Priestess. Wish I had passthrough because the game continues to crash for no reason. When it's not crashing, the game runs perfectly.

Streaming error. There are no definitive solutions from what I've gathered. Might need to boot into windows for this too. Ugh. That does not inspire hope.<<ref "3">> Fuck me. I do not want to boot into that hot garbage.

Virtualbox 3d is a complete failure. VMWare is not running. Gonna be work to even see if it is remotely playable in VMWare.
