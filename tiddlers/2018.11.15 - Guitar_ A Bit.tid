title: 2018.11.15 - Guitar: A Bit

Caffeine obviously helps me. I feel very crisp with caffeine. I practiced 3 Celtic and 2 Classical at least 3-4 times each. I went at full speed and pushed the boundaries on several. As usual, I have none memorized, but that's okay. I have no intention of doing so. I think they are very different songs at different speeds. Full speed is the way I usually like them the most, but they can all be very sad, drifting songs if I want. I like that too. Not all pieces can do that. I wish I understood why.
