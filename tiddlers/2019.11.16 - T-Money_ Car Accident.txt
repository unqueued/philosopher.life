Work after work. Glad to have something don't half assed.
Nov 15, 2019 10:09pm
How are you and yall doing?
Nov 15, 2019 10:09pm
Done*
Nov 15, 2019 10:09pm
Excellent, will protect those nicely.
Nov 16, 2019 11:20am
I'm a fan of the rustic look.
Nov 16, 2019 11:20am
We're doing well enough. Saturday seems to be triage-upkeep day for the offspring. It's the day I get to spend with my wife too. 
Nov 16, 2019 11:21am
I'm doing well enough. Been an emotional week, but productive.
Nov 16, 2019 11:22am
I feel you on the emotional week.

One car accident on i75. I'm sore. But nothing broken. Walked away.
Nov 16, 2019 12:24pm
Yikes!
Nov 16, 2019 12:53pm
I'm glad you walked away. That looks awful.
Nov 16, 2019 12:53pm
You going to see a doctor?
Nov 16, 2019 12:53pm
I did the day of the accident. Had xrays of chest and hand. Just bumps and bruises. I still think I have a cracked rib. But they don't do anything for it. I think I broke my tailbone too. Something else they don't do anything for. Lol
Nov 16, 2019 1:18pm
Man, I hope you can take it easy.
Nov 16, 2019 1:18pm
Thankfully my hand is OK. Just sprained. That's my money maker.
Nov 16, 2019 1:19pm
That's going to take quite a while to recover from.
Nov 16, 2019 1:19pm
That is true.
Nov 16, 2019 1:19pm
Small blessings
Nov 16, 2019 1:19pm
Is everyone else healthy?
Nov 16, 2019 1:19pm
That happened Tuesday when we had our first snow. I was driving too fast in the Interstate.
Nov 16, 2019 1:19pm
I hate driving in snow/ice. I'm going to have to learn.
Nov 16, 2019 1:19pm
Yupp. Sniffles but otherwise healthy.
Nov 16, 2019 1:20pm
Good. 
Nov 16, 2019 1:20pm
You have had a crazy week dude.
Nov 16, 2019 1:20pm
Mwe are going to look at property closer to my work. I'm refusing to commute 180 miles a day. Even if it means I stay in a hotel until we figure things out.
Nov 16, 2019 1:21pm
I would do the same in your shoes if I could.
Nov 16, 2019 1:21pm
I see way too many wreaks. It's just a matter of time.
Nov 16, 2019 1:21pm
Your time with your family matters.
Nov 16, 2019 1:21pm
That's hours out of your day you don't get to be with your daughter.
Nov 16, 2019 1:21pm
Yeah. Well even if we find a place. We will likely be separated during my work week.
Nov 16, 2019 1:22pm
For a couple of years. But I'll be home for my 3 day weekend.
Nov 16, 2019 1:22pm
=( That sucks.
Nov 16, 2019 1:22pm
I'm sorry.
Nov 16, 2019 1:22pm
I've had to live away from my family on weekdays, and it's pure hell.
Nov 16, 2019 1:23pm
This isn't my first time. It sucks. But better than driving.
Nov 16, 2019 1:23pm
You can still develop profound relationships with your daughter remotely.
Nov 16, 2019 1:23pm
Indeed. With Technology it is very easy. We have the same plan so we can video chat.
Nov 16, 2019 1:24pm
And, I think it's crucial practice for the 21st century. One day, she'll be all growed up and may live in a big city or something far away. Having that infrastructure, practicing with each other constantly, etc., probably for the best in the long-run.
Nov 16, 2019 1:25pm
And she is old enough we can openly talk to her about this and she understands.
Nov 16, 2019 1:25pm
I'm chasing that kid around. Lol
Nov 16, 2019 1:25pm
Aye. It's going to accelerate, imho (that's what it has felt like for mine at least).
Nov 16, 2019 1:25pm
She ain't getting away.
Nov 16, 2019 1:25pm
ðŸ˜‚
Nov 16, 2019 1:25pm
She's your child; she's going to do what she wants in the end.
Nov 16, 2019 1:25pm
Lol. I despise how true that statement is.
Nov 16, 2019 1:26pm
Lol
Nov 16, 2019 1:26pm
If we do it right I'll only be away 3 nights a week. And home Thursday night for a 3 day weekend.
Nov 16, 2019 1:27pm
And if we do it right we build more equity in property.

This is what we are going to look at. With strong potential for building a home. In the future. We have always wanted a cabin on the middle of the woods
Nov 16, 2019 1:38pm
I'd Prolly just get a larger used camper and live out of it. For a few years. Or a cheap mobile home. Lots of hidden costs though. No water, electric or septic on it currently.
Nov 16, 2019 1:40pm
It's so expensive to upgrade. Seems like it might be cheaper to buy properties which already have the essentials up front.
Nov 16, 2019 1:43pm
Your right. But in this area. 25min from work. To find a mature wooded parcel is difficult. I am not a fan of fields. Which require grazing animals or leasing for hay or just bush hogging.
Nov 16, 2019 1:50pm
Lots of homes on small lots that might be a better move in ready. If you check out the pics. You can see the appeal to the hermit in me.
Nov 16, 2019 1:51pm
I saw. Appeals to me too.
Nov 16, 2019 2:29pm
I am hoping it isn't too mountainas
Nov 16, 2019 2:35pm
It was nothing but a moutian.
Nov 16, 2019 9:22pm
Lol
