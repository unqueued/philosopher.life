*** I think viruses are alive, and I think memes are viruses, and I think that innoculation makes sense. I think this is a very abstract and inexact way to talk about something that is very complex, but I like it. In the same way that we see memetic weapons being created around us, I think we might just be able to created memetic medicine. In a sense, I feel like [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]] is supposed to do that.

*** I am not surprised Krugman thinks this. I don't think he fundamentally understands the technical capacities, limits, and flexibility of the construction of this technology either. I'm betting he has other reasons that he's not pointing to just yet.

*** First stone problem for me here. I was a dumb man.

*** Hrm...is that right? If it is, then I am really not seeing the fabric.

*** I am worried that such tools will ultimately be used to censor and shape the public will to even worse positions. We need an arbiter, a beginning point that we can trust. Trusting trust is the hard part of this process. The hack may be necessary, even if it is likely to fail. I don't know.

*** Ah ha, they are very worried about it too, and they should be. Here is my worry: like DES and AES, they may be able to break this. There is a serious problem in allowing them to monitor and trial it. I want to see more transparency in this process. It is one of the fundamental saviors that might be available to us.
**** Classic McEliece with 1MB keys sounds interesting. That they are targeting very small plaintexts makes sense, as we will just use for the handshake.
