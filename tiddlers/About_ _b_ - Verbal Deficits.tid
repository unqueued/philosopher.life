title: About: /b/ - Verbal Deficits

I believe my verbal deficits are something for which my quantitative mind bends over backwards. There's an insanity to how I must bend my perception to see or express the truth. It's rube-goldberg-machine-esque, an anti-pattern that only works in this "only man who can drive his own car" syndrome.

Somehow, my quantitative reasoning is quite normal either though. So, take this with a huge grain of salt.
