* [[2017.06 -- Family Log]]
** This may be something I look upon more fondly long-term.
* [[Lucky Number Sleven]]
** Yay! I really love that movie so much. It is surprising how it is so rewatchable. Knowing the twist doesn't ruin it. You get to see all the breadcrumbs.
* [[2017.07.02 -- Carpe Diem Log]]
** I didn't use DCK.
* [[2017.07.02 -- Prompted Introspection Log]]

* [[2017.07.02 -- Diet Log]]
