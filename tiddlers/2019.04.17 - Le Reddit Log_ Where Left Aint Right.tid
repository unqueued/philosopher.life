title: 2019.04.17 - Le Reddit Log: Where Left Aint Right

https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/be5hb5/what_are_some_of_the_worst_tendencies_on_the_left/

I'm probably not in the best position to define the Left (it's really big, fragmented, and not monolithic), and some of the worst tendencies of some Leftists aren't unique to Leftists. I'm lucky to have any Leftists in my life.

One of my largest problems with some of the Left: denying the political (which is not the moral) right to free speech. Of course, cutting through the noise and curating signal requires building our own filter bubbles based upon trusting others to some extent, and so I'm all in favor of wisely censoring our own media diets for ourselves individually (though, we still have duties to read and respond to our enemies), but I'm not in favor of censoring what others can access and silencing others for everyone (though I'm completely in favor of argumentation and punishing immoral behavior). To my eyes, this is a technical problem in failing to own and maximally decentralize communication infrastructures.

Decentralization is an extremely difficult problem in computer science (and hence power structures of any kind), and the Left still doesn't have workable theories for constructing conceptually necessary federated and centralized powers (such as the Rule of Law) through [[profoundly decentralized means|The Original Position]].

I find some Leftists have conflated niceness with kindness. There is a time and a place for asswhoopin'. Even [[The Golden Rule]] ([[Tit for Two Tats|T42T]]) demands we flip tables and defect against those who play Always Defect or [[Pavlov]] in iterated prisoners dilemmas. Violence is morally obligated in many contexts.

I've found plenty of Leftists who aren't interested in providing accounts of metaphysics and metaethics, which are necessary tentpegs to place in the desert. Unfortunately, I see a ton of anti-realism (in a variety of topics) from Leftists. We have to be able to justify the why of what we owe to others. Unfortunately, effectively responding to Individualism is a much more difficult task than it initially appears (even though it seems obvious at first glance).

I'm surprised by Leftists who exhibit nationalism. Relatedly, Leftists from wealthier backgrounds often fail to realize that initial successes in implementing the distribution of the means of production and decentralization of power on a global scale will entail significant sacrifices in their lifestyles and hedonic pleasure.

I'm convinced many Leftists have misunderstood their Hohfeldian rights clusters, and they take themselves to have a self-ownership that is still too individualistic. I'm convinced we have profound duties to others, and that logically entails we each own each other. This is a hard conceptual pill to swallow for many folks.

Ok, I'll bite at that last section. What are those duties, and how are they justified?

The ideal, top-down answer is The Categorical Imperative, and the pragmatic, bottom-up, heuristic is The Original Position. This is the duty from which all other duties emerge and are justified. It's essentially the Golden Rule, about not making an exception of yourself. This has serious complications, including codifying our maxims with the particularities of our contexts. It is not feasible for me to enumerate the infinite number of universalizable moral truths (which are logically equivalent to each other since they have the same semantics in all possible worlds; it's one big necessary truth-ball) even if I had them (and I don't!). I do not claim to have a complete theory of moral virtue, but we have to try for one (that too is our duty).

Here's some casuistry to juice your intuitions:

To say I absolutely own myself means to say that a 4-year old girl drowning in the pool next to me does not have moral claim right on my body to save her. To say I have a duty to save the girl is to say the girl has a moral claim-right on my person (even if only temporarily). To the extent that I have a duty to her is the extent to which she owns me (and, also, therefore, the extent to which I do not own myself). All else being equal, The Categorical Imperative clearly justifies a perfect moral obligation to this drowning girl.

I think I hold a minority position here, but I'm convinced realist, externalist, and primarily cognitivist variants of Neo-Kantianism and Neo-Aristotelianism form a strong Foundation in metaethics and epistemology which Marxism often lacks.
