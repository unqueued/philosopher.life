Unhinged individualism can only ever dialectically generate golemic towers of babel which collapse upon the contradiction of assuming the finite can generate its own meaning. GÃ¶del, save us. We cannot coherently beg the question of being our own [[Foundation]]s. Of course, insofar as even well-made democracy is a tyrant over the correct end of the bellcurve spectrum, collectivism is unhinged. We clearly have a vice that leans toward individualism though.
