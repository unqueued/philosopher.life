What is Economics?

The word 'economics' is from the Greek for Î¿;span style=&quot;font-family: Tahoma&quot;&gt;á¼¶&lt;/span&gt;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;ÎºÎ¿Ï‚ (oikos: house) and Î½ÏŒÎ¼Î¿Ï‚ (nomos: custom or law), hence &quot;rules of the house(hold).&quot; The word of course has morphed several times to include and consider several ideas. The earliest definitions of political economy were simple, elegant statements defining it as the study of wealth. Later definitions evolved to include human activity, advocating a shift toward the modern view of economics as primarily a study of man and of human welfare, not of money exclusively. Formally speaking, Economics currently refers to the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. How blah!? How bland!? How inaccurate!?...The tide is changing; the meaning of economics is evolving.;/font&gt;&lt

I mean to outline a trend in the meaning and pursuit of &quot;economics&quot; which I find, in large part, has been overlooked by even those who work in that field. Essentially, I am inclined to believe a.) The formal definition of economics is evolving and b.) Economics is verging upon the actual study it seeks (which is very surprising), and c.) Economists, who generally gravitate towards furthering economics as a &quot;science&quot; will come to find they have been pursuing something which they do not consider to be science (they may even be appalled at what economics really means).

Mainstream economics begins with the premise that resources are scarce, and secondly, that because resources are scarce it is necessary to choose between competing alternatives. Of course, because economists must analyze the meanings of choosing between alternatives, understanding choices by individuals and groups has become central to modern economic theory to an extent that psychological analysis and decision/strategy-making concepts are now the cutting-edge of this field we call &quot;economics&quot;. Economists believe that incentives and desires play an important role in shaping decision making. It seems like I've heard these claims before *cough....Only fairly recently have economists begun to speak the name of their true (and supposedly new) doctrine. Economists now borrow concepts from the Utilitarian school of philosophy, claiming utility is used as 'analytical' concept within economics, though they claim to appreciate that society may not adopt utilitarian objectives. They are begging the question about our motives and decision-making, as if egoism is absolutely true, but then they go on to protect their beautiful secular â€œscienceâ€ with a contradiction saying &quot;it doesn't apply to everything&quot;. 

This concern with utility is most prevalent on a microeconomic level; some economists extend economic analysis to all personal decisions (ahha! a smart lot of them). Of course, it is easier to see the &quot;math&quot; behind individual decisions, and so, as macro-utility is much more complex, it hasn't caught on as effectively. Butterfly-effect anyone? An alternative can be thought of as a vector where the entries are answers to questions like &quot;How many eggs should I buy?&quot;, but also &quot;How many hours should I spend with my kids?&quot; and &quot;Which candidate should I vote for?&quot; These micro-economists, which appear to be &quot;rogues&quot; of their subject, on the cutting edge, are simply extending the meaning of utility within economics to what philosophers have always understood utility to mean. Economists are on the cusp of the meaning of value (one that implies morality!!). How dangerous for them...

As usual, economists will blather on, saying that the relationship between economics and ethics is so &quot;complex&quot; yet &quot;separate&quot;. Many economists consider normative choices and value judgments, like what needs or wants, or what is good for society, to be political or personal questions outside the scope of economics. They go on to say that once a person or government has established a set of goals, economics can provide insight as to how they might best be achieved. It is odd that economists have this separation of positive economics (&quot;what is&quot;) and normative economics (&quot;what ought to be&quot;). They cannot be divided. In order to do solve positive economics, you'll be forced into making normative economic claims. Blind people. The transformation of the subject begins.

Anyone who knows anything knows that utility is unforgiving and completely universal. It mathematically divides up metaethical values among the many things of this world (although we do see amoral strains that act as a social virusâ€”eventually contradictory). It is all or nothing. If you claim egoist utility, then youâ€™re going to be applying this reasoning to all aspects of life. It is ironic, and blatantly compromising of their thesis to apply utility only in matters of wealth, but not to all areas. What has occurred is that a formally â€œsecularâ€ idea has evolved several times into a pseudo-science which requires psychological, mathematical, and now philosophical analysis to determine the who, what, where, why, and how of â€œwealthâ€. Moral claims are not secular ones. And, this pseudo-science is less and less secular (much to their dismay). The irony of Economics is that their â€œstudyâ€ required them to work through a great deal of things to adjust their initial definition of wealth (and value), only to discover they started a hollow study. Economics, after looking at its conclusion and where it is heading, is not a synthesis of other fields, but simply a direct portal into already existent fields of study (namely philosophy/religion).

Economics began as some study of money. Probably, much as the alchemist who wishes to turn rock or iron into gold through some magic item, the original economists sought to make money through the mathematical study of an &quot;economy&quot; (which is some vacuumous space that somehow relates to the world, we know not how). If only there was some formula in which economists could crunch numbers to decide &quot;which stock is going up today?&quot; Of course, these economists (frontiersmen, pioneers in a &quot;new field&quot;) quickly found that they had more homework to do before they could reach these riches through simple deductions. (Although, one must ask: &quot;what are riches&quot;...something they should have asked long ago). They conclude that money makes you rich.

What is money? I'll be brief; it is the quantification and qualification of value that allows for universal exchanges within a world of comparative advantages. My time here becomes your time spent there. Value my friends, money attempts to represent value (albeit, it does so poorly). In reality, the economist no longer seeks to study money, they wish to study value. 

The concept of value is central to economics. Economists say that an observable measure of it is market price. Again, they see value through a lens of pure material wealth. Hard currency lends credibility to this &quot;value&quot; concept. They assume that value in economics is DIFFERENT than say, &quot;moral value&quot;. Dumb! We already know that value is value, and that it exists in virtue of its worthiness of pursuit. There is no difference. Morality, therefore, must have a price tag, else money means nothing. Economics, in virtue of studying value at all, MUST be a study of all value. 

But, if it is a study of all value, then it is a study of morality! It is the study of God! Isn't economics the pursuit of truth? Isn't economics just pointing us towards the same thing as philosophy and religion? Think back. What is &quot;wealth&quot;? What is &quot;value&quot;? They are those things which are worth pursuit! The economist claims that money is worth pursuit as it is a currency that translates for other values. While they look at monetary decisions, and begin upon utilitarianism, they are blind to the very basis of their subject. 

We do have to ask some questions though. If money really does have &quot;value&quot;...then it could be used to trade for other things of value that we wouldn't have expected. All things which have finite value can be bought with money, correct? Would this allow you to buy a person if a person had finite value? Or...what about exchanging money to makeup for negative values you've imposed on the world? What is &quot;production&quot;? 

A new light shed on economics as a study of true value means we are forced to redefine key principles and components of a subject that once dealt exclusively with material wealth, translating a small study into an already much larger one that involves metaphysical value to be considered. Or, we could just scrap it. Now, while economists are slowing progressing towards the inevitable truth, I question whether they will ever take that leap. Would they be willing to accept these statements? Probably not. They are likely dogmatically complacent in their religion of money. Economics is a falsely secular concept. They use utility and egoism to defend material wealth. Idolaters.
