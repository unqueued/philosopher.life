title: 2017.12.26 -- Computer Musings: Decentrality

Confirmed IPFS/IPNS is doing its thang. Forgot to switch on my daemon (I thought I did with --now flag, but no go).

gtk-gnutella setup. I wish had I more control over the icons in KDE.

Turned off my giant Resilio Syncs. This is the wrong tool for the job. I hate to say it. Will I just byte the bullet and go for rsync?

Cockatrice installed.

Trying Zeronet build again.

i2p and tor mostly setup. Daemonized, yes, but still some configs to work through.
