title: 2017.03 -- Homeschooling Log

This was a difficult month. We're still morphing because I will be working outside the house. We're getting there. It is clear that [[j3d1h]] is functioning better than [[1uxb0x]], but she is older (so she should). It did not use bullet points here, and instead I focused more on a written narrative. Perhaps I should use both.
