Still not feeling great. I've got moving chores to get done, but I'm not in a rush.
Jan 7 11:54am
Need to complete monthly audits and move onto my yearly audits (hopefully)
Jan 7 11:55am
Working on some CS projects with [[j3d1h]], cleaning and writing with [[1uxb0x]].
Jan 7 11:55am
How about you, homie?

Iâ€™ve got work today and playing a new visual novel later with some friends. I want to hit the ground running on drafting this year and get a fully complete outline finished by the end of February. 

This weekend I want to fill out my teaching application too and start poking around at the GRE
Jan 7 11:57am
Also I have doctor paperwork to fill out for Friday and next Tuesday.

Sounds like immediate fun, and long-term work.
Jan 7 12:30pm
Hopefully, by Fall, more pieces are going to have clicked together.
Jan 7 12:31pm
What's the writing piece on?
Jan 7 12:31pm
Also, have you considered doing a visul novel yourself?
Jan 7 12:31pm
Thatâ€™s the problem. My old work in progress is too flawed to continue. Iâ€™m looking into ways to bolster that old narrative with new life but itâ€™s going to take more time I think. I need to mull it over longer. 

Iâ€™m interested, but I have no expertise in creating visual assets plus Iâ€™d rather write a more traditional book than waifu bait. ðŸ˜‚

Maybe some day. ðŸ‘€

If I truly wanted to write a VN, it would be trashy as fuck. Hahaha
