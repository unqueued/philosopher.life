How's your day going?
THU 12:33 PM
Pretty good —it’s a good day to do some math!
THU 12:34 PM
Are you still snowing it up?
THU 12:34 PM
! =) It is a good day to do math. You sound lucky today, partner.
THU 12:34 PM
There is still some snow on the ground. I assume I'll have school tomorrow though (right?).
THU 12:35 PM
I'm reading to get back into it.
THU 12:35 PM
But, I've not wasted my time. Reading and writing my butt off, as usual (don't worry, it's still there).
THU 12:35 PM
Maybe —it’s supposed to snow/ice tonight
THU 12:35 PM
Oh.
THU 12:35 PM
Well...Maybe not?
THU 12:35 PM
I don't pay attention to the weather. It's a bad habit.
THU 12:36 PM
Glad to hear you haven’t lost your butt —losing mine would help my weight and center of gravity issues but I don’t see it happening
THU 12:36 PM
I am well rested —hoping to work on cleaning things so we can work on the floor
THU 12:37 PM
Have you heard from either brother lately?
THU 12:38 PM
[[AIR]] has become unconnectable for me. I can't reach him. =/
THU 12:38 PM
Ack that can’t be good
THU 12:39 PM
Does that happen often?
THU 12:39 PM
I think he opened a long list of my "how are you doing?"s (I get message viewed receipts over Signal) and that was it.
THU 12:39 PM
That is sometimes part of his cycle.
THU 12:39 PM
I know he's gotta be in a ton of pain.
THU 12:40 PM
Yeah sometimes its hard to communicate when you are really far in
THU 12:40 PM
My heart is heavy for him
THU 12:41 PM
[[JRE]] seems to be doing okay. We're still in good contact (https://philosopher.life/#:JRE). I think it's been an emotional two weeks for him, understandably.
THU 12:43 PM
Understandable

THU 5:24 PM
I want that job.
THU 5:24 PM
Wow that is made for you
THU 5:53 PM
Or at least you would do very well
THU 5:53 PM
Thank you! I think there is like...a 1% chance to land a dream job like that, but I'm gonna try.
THU 5:54 PM
Good you should go for it
