title: ARAM

* [[ARAM Compositions]]
* [[The Perfect ARAM Champion]]

I love poking. I love the constant teamfighting. I love constantly dodging skill shots. I love the itemizations. I like how the objectives are clear. More importantly, I like how I can focus. I'm terrible at reading a very large map. I enjoy seeing the full map right in front of me. It's honestly just more fun, even if the strategy isn't as deep. I've even touched greatness, having had a couple masters players and even one challenger in my games (and I'm a plat-5 player on SR). People tend to be nicer on ARAM too. It's wonderful.

I generally hover between 1600-1700 rating (roughly top 5-10% of the ARAM population).

* Champions to get on ARAM account:
** Nami
** Jhin
** Caitlyn
** Malzahar

General Theories:

*Pre-Game
** Use an ARAM-only account with champions that are either fun to play (even when you are losing) and/or boast incredibly high winrates. If you can play tanks well, then do so. Find a style that fits you and round out from there. The more champions you own that you want to play, the more likely you'll end up with something you'll want to play. 
** You should have runes, masteries, and item builds prepared for all your owned champions and an idea of what you would do in general for free-to-play champs.
*** You shouldn't have to spend time thinking about these things or waiting in the fountain.
** Be absurdly conservative with your rerolls. Try to trade whenever you can. Otherwise, call "rr" for appearance's sake, and cross your fingers. I suggest waiting for at least 20 seconds to reroll, since someone may dodge (if they really dislike the comp) or they may reroll into something they would trade to you. If you don't like the composition or your champ, you can always dodge. I don't suggest dodging after a reroll (since you lose it if you are the dodger). When I don't have rerolls, I am far more likely to dodge. Wait to dodge until the last 5 seconds, as someone else may dodge before you (so you don't pay the penalty).
*In-Game
** Mana and hp regen are really fundamental to outlasting your opponent. A champion with 10% health is often effectively removed from combat. They are just waiting for the most opportune, highest-utility method of killing their character off. Winning the wars of attrition in trades/poke are key before many all-in initiations before pushing for objectives is the name of the game.
** Scaling runes, Armor and MR, are obviously best. Choose your penetration. Done.
