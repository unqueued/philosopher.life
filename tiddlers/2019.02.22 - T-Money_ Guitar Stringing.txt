I agree that moral success is not a result of how much money you make or how big your house is. I am convinced that being moral is extremely hard work. When I see Zach choose to give up his millions to the less fortunate, I'll take him and his advice more seriously. Success, which I take to be Eudaimonia, is non-trivially a result of moral luck. Some people have to work crazy hard just to survive, and he makes no room for it. The man is speaking from a place of privilege.
FRI 7:15 PM
Feeling good is not the same as being good.
FRI 7:15 PM
I agree that we deserve to have the chance to rest and relax, and I agree it is part of successfully achieving eudaimonia.
FRI 7:16 PM
I do not think everyone is morally responsible for being unable to follow that advice. I consider Zach part of the causal forces for those who are not so privileged.
FRI 7:16 PM
The ridicule you receive for your degree is absurd. Anti-intellectualism is a disease. I'm sorry you face it. I too have to hide that fact from most people.
FRI 7:17 PM
I agree that education is necessary to flourishing! I am radically opposed to the notion that the point of post-secondary education is for acquiring to credentials necessary to virtue signal in markets. Knowledge is for a much more valuable existential transformation. I say that while also agreeing to the claim that education systems have a profound capitalist infection.
FRI 7:19 PM
Your boomer meme is hilarious. =)
FRI 7:20 PM
I do hold that generation responsible for our predicament.
FRI 7:20 PM
I love the work on the guitar =)
FRI 7:21 PM
I like how you kept the black band on the sides too.
FRI 7:22 PM
Thank you for all your responses. You know I like to send you memes and other random quotes as potential ice breakers. You are under no obligation to respond at any given time or for any length. But in all honesty I sincerely appreciate your input, Outlook, life philosophy
FRI 7:22 PM
Heck yeah. I'm glad you send me things for us to talk about.
FRI 7:23 PM
That's how it is done.
FRI 7:23 PM
Keeping the sides black and the neck and headstock black was actually the easy way out. Way too many curves and radius is to attempt to sand. It took me about three hours to do the back and the front. But I think I was successful and getting a mild Road worn look. And the best part is after sanding the front and scraping it to mimic a guitar pick I used old oil and grease to fill the crevices and make the front look dirty before applying a clear coat.
FRI 7:24 PM
I agree, that is much easier. It also looks better.
FRI 7:26 PM
I suppose I wasn't thinking of Zachs quote from. Any other point of view except I'm lazy? And I like ideas that make me feel good about myself that don't require drastic change.
FRI 7:29 PM
I'm not like crazy lazy. You see I'm always doing shit. But I literally don't do shit after work during the week. I wont even drag the trash cans back from the rd till my day off. Walk right past dem bitches. Haha
FRI 7:30 PM
But after a 14hr day with driving... Who would.
FRI 7:31 PM
Lol
FRI 7:31 PM
I did not dissect his position in society as a reason to gain depth or knowledge from his ideas. Although privladged. So we're many men who we take advice and ideas from.
FRI 7:32 PM
Though that is not my claim.
FRI 7:33 PM
OK. I misunderstood then. Fair. And I'm driving and there was like two words you used I didn't get to Google.
FRI 7:34 PM
Fag.
FRI 7:34 PM
Lol
FRI 7:34 PM
No. Kid or wife tonight. Just did my liquor store pickup.
FRI 7:38 PM
Back to the house for my Kratom dose. And guitar stringing session
FRI 7:38 PM
That sounds like a pleasant evening. =)
FRI 7:39 PM
As long as I don't drink too much are sir texting old girlfriends I'll be just fine. LOL
FRI 7:39 PM
lol
FRI 7:40 PM
Has almost cost me my marriage one too many times. Lol
FRI 7:41 PM
Kratom turns your libido to about zero. So that helps
FRI 7:42 PM
Well, I hope your guitar is the sexiest thing you play with tonight.
FRI 7:44 PM
Hahaha.
FRI 7:59 PM
Nice.

This is what you miss out on not being on social media.

FRI 8:42 PM
Monica, clearly
FRI 8:42 PM
I had the biggest crush on nacy carrigen.
FRI 8:43 PM
I hated Tonya.
FRI 8:43 PM
Understandably. Straight gangsta.
FRI 8:43 PM
Tonya was the gangsta. Knee taker. Nacy was the one who got hit.
FRI 8:44 PM
Aye.
FRI 8:44 PM
I'm not quite sure how best to define social media. I spend a great deal of time reading the ephemeral words of others though, particularly over Reddit and Hackernews.
FRI 8:45 PM
I have a maymay section in my link log you might enjoy: https://philosopher.life/#Link%20Log
FRI 8:46 PM
It must have been the crotch shots in those outfits when they did the splits and spun and circles. One leg in the air.
FRI 8:46 PM
Always been snout the brunettes. And I was Prolly 9....
FRI 8:46 PM
Needs more bare tiddies
FRI 8:46 PM
It takes alot out of me when I read one simple. Article on your wiki.
FRI 8:53 PM
The link logs, thankfully, aren't really articles. They are just a bunch of links with a few comments.
FRI 8:54 PM
Your writing style is cumbersome. Not in a bad way. In the way my mind can capture it all without slow reading and diliberate processing.
FRI 8:54 PM
Cant*
FRI 8:55 PM
I'm sorry. It really isn't concise (though it is precise). One day, I hope to be in a better position to help people understand it.
FRI 8:55 PM
It may be the case that I create an addition, more straightforward layer that sits on top of the wiki (and if you want a more complex answer, you can click on it).
FRI 8:56 PM
That's. Why I liked after-school. It was much easier to read. And I liked the window to you. It seemed more straight forward.
FRI 8:56 PM
More narrative oriented too.
FRI 8:56 PM
I think the [[Link Log]] captures my identity far, far more effectively though.

FRI 8:57 PM
There's an example one (I don't know if you got to see one).
FRI 8:57 PM
No need for apology.  I just know few hyper readers. And the style is not intended for skimming. Not well.
FRI 8:58 PM
Hm. That is actually how I define hyperreading. I think it is skimming to find the diamonds and redpills in the rough. Deepreading is when I'm engaged in close, paranoic, detailed, slow, contextualized, systematic interpretations.
FRI 8:59 PM
I skim news and shit and other articles, forums, for instance I did alot of research before I began the guitar process. But mostly skimming.
FRI 9:05 PM
aye, makes sense
FRI 9:05 PM
I spend most of my time on social media looking at stuff for sale. Then researching things I am interested in to find out their worth and stuff about them.
FRI 9:06 PM
I research alot about my old truck. And entertain ideas about utilizing different frames from other vehicles and what not.
FRI 9:06 PM
Researching what transmission from what year figs what engines and blah blah....
FRI 9:07 PM
I  have seen that, lol.
FRI 9:07 PM
Researching your interests makes good sense to me.
FRI 9:08 PM
I don't know how you could effectively do so much of what you do without it.
FRI 9:08 PM
I often find little to no substance to my questions. I should. Be more active in forums.
FRI 9:09 PM
Including the forums I am a member of.
FRI 9:09 PM
But I'm lazy.
FRI 9:10 PM
I wing it, alot. And just do and think on the go.
FRI 9:10 PM
It is not clear to me that you are lazy, btw.
FRI 9:11 PM
I think you have some executive functioning disorders and schizotypal characteristics (as do I!).
FRI 9:11 PM
I agree you are the 'wing it' sort in many contexts, but you also appear to have enough experience to back it up. When you feel out of your element enough, you don't just dive in arrogantly, imho.
FRI 9:12 PM
Even in your discussions with me, I see your couched reservations and disclaimers as a reasonable caution.
FRI 9:13 PM
Agreed. On all accounts.
FRI 9:13 PM
Your still a fag
FRI 9:15 PM
Stringing the guitar. And Prolly fixing to start drinking hard liquor.
FRI 9:15 PM
I will. Make. Less and less since. Please feel free to ignore at any moment, for the remainder of the evening.
FRI 9:16 PM
Fair warning.
FRI 9:16 PM
No, it's not a problem. I have to drop AFK without warning all the time.
FRI 9:16 PM
You know I'm going to respond to you, and I know you do too. IM is beautifully asynchronous.
FRI 9:17 PM
I'm also getting wasted tonight. 14 years of marriage.
FRI 9:17 PM
Congrats!

Weare coming up on 10!

I'm in love with this chep guitar now. Totally changed the sound. Sounds way better and louder and brighter.
FRI 10:52 PM
I am uncouth.
FRI 10:52 PM
I have played several instruments since I was 9, and I can't tell the difference between a $200 guitar and a $2000 guitar.
FRI 10:53 PM
It's not Taylor. But I'm just happy with the way it turned out. Looks like I could. Have tried to "road wear" it more. But I was kinda scared. Didn't know what to expect.
FRI 10:53 PM
A real guitarist can make a $50 guitar sound like a million dollars.
FRI 10:54 PM
I'm not that guy.
FRI 10:54 PM
I need a good guitar to make. Me sound better.
FRI 10:54 PM
Preferably with distortion. Lol
