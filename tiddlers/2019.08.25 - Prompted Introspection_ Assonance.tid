title: 2019.08.25 - Prompted Introspection: Assonance

!! What historical figure do you most identify with?

Am I not entertained by this: [[2017.05.22 - Prompted Introspection Log]]? Who is the most annoying, autistic, arrogant, addicted neckbeard in history? That's who I identify with. I'm an ape and an asshole. Could I ever live up to [[Saint Diogenesocrates]]? No. Way too cool for me.

My life has some wonderful aspects. I feel like the shards have been glued back together a bit. I've felt more like a whole lately (which isn't to say I've done a good job). I hope to become more grateful while still fighting for justice.
