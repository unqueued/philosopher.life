title: 2018.01.07 - Prompted Introspection Log: Relative Occupation Strangeness

!! Do any of your friends or relatives have strange occupations?

My family is filled with teachers, scam artists, and what you sometimes get when you combine the two: preachers. Do I look like I know what a jpeg is? Yes. I'm just kidding, of course.

In any case, there is some strangeness in the occupations we take. We are a somewhat rootless family, nomads and gypsies. We belong nowhere, it seems. I'd say we are a fairly weird family, although I may not be the best judge of that. I felt like I got to peer into the lives of many people growing up as a pastor's kid though, and I think we were averaged a high degree of strangeness.
