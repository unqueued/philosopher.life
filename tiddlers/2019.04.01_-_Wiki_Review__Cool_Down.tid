** He's having lots of ups and downs at work. I'm thinking with him, but I fear I'm not being useful enough to him. I can't see far enough there.
* [[2019.03.31 - JRE: Disruption]]
** Not sure if we can [[ltf]] in chat enough.
* [[2019.03.27 - Tasha: Gruffly Shoots]]
** My humor sucks. I just don't know how to joke with folks.
* [[2019.03.31 - Tasha: Dumbo]]
** They live extremely busy lives. It's weird to see that level of Stockholm syndrome regarding capitalism. I assume I have been that way for a long time too.
* [[2019.03.25 - T-Money: Bifurcation]]

** He uses the concpet of hivemind a lot, but I'm not sure if he's all that careful about it. 
* [[2019.03.28 - K: Fido]]
** I am surprised by the number of movies he watches for school. Times is a'changin'.

** He plays a ton of games. Lives in them. I have been there.
* [[2019.03.31 - K: Mid-Sermon Chat]]

** Nope. She doesn't care.
* [[2019.03.29 - Jop: Prep]]
** I'm glad to see her reaching out to me for [[smalltalk]]. It is better than nothing. Felt like I was in Asia for a few minutes.
* [[cruise control]]
** Silly. Perhaps it will become more valuable over time, but I have no idea. It doesn't matter if it doesn't.
* [[Inside No. 9]]
** Stunning show. Had to say thank you. It is rare that someone recommends a show which just fits.
