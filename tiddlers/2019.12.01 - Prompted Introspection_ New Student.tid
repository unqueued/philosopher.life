title: 2019.12.01 - Prompted Introspection: New Student

!! What advice would you give a new student?

Oh, I like the depth of my answer in: [[2017.05.17 - Prompted Introspection Log]]. Ultimately, the question is what are you a student for? MacIntyre is correct from the perspective of a positivist attempting to provide a neutral answer, but he misses the point. It depends on the student in question. As expectations scale with the student, so should the advice. I like how a student is being a student in thinking about the advice on how to be a student.

I think a brand new human student is a brand new human. They learn on their own for quite a while. All one can do is facilitate it.
