Spinoza says that is that unified everything has to be constituted by something, Hegel says it is by dialectics, Everything that is a mode is just a function. That is to say, the cube is a mode, I am a mode, everything and all group are modes. Even possibility itself is a mode, Spinoza does not agree. He does not know how to talk about the tenth and eleventh. What is interesting about the Spinozen object is that it could include literally everything possible. he can tell us that the grindelia proof of the goof makes everything and everyone necessary, he can make his proof with or without metaphysics. I want us to see that generalized AI if it has anything similar even in the Chinese computer sense, if it generates possible worlds like ours, they better be one that we can justify, he is kind of the problem with being the rick like god of a world, he builds a world to power his car. How would you want there lives to be like? You would dictate the lives of any of the people in any of those worlds. It seems to me that humanity is in a similar position to create a finite set of worlds, I think we play god when we create life when we make a simulation of a world like ours. We have no logical reason to believe their lives, that their functional computers. that their identities, that they are agency, that they are freedom, That they are ontic statues. Is somehow less meaning full than ours, the only way ours is more meaning full then theirs. Is that we know they live in an experience machine. It is possible that we live in such a world and is defined by quantum observance. Where time does not seem real. Mabey our world is one of these possible worlds being computed among a bunch of others, a fascinating thing to admit is that if we say there is a good in a world there is one in all of them, therefore all are necessary. One beautiful part of recreating that is that it relieves us of a burden. Contijince rest on the dileatha or t is one. This is okay, it is clear that everyone meets there a contradiction, even the physical universe. we should play T42T instead of T4T. It is possible that whatever is used to simulate mean whenever it grows energy efficient enough must definitionally be comprised of building a foundation on T42T. We have a moral duty to create a morally justified world. (If you are doing your best you are doing fine.) It is our obligation to create a moral being cause it... I suggest T42T cooperation might be so resilient that it makes the most affection results, There is an opportunity for us to do the right thing as creators, It is possible in the next century that humanity will give birth to AI, and we... have to give... the best ones... we would do something immoral to make a world with unnecessary evil, Its not just one person through reproduction. We may be creating digital worlds. GAI = Genral Artifishal Intellegence.  Capitlists deny the meaning of those in simulations. they have no intrest in the value of others as ends in that possible world. I suggest this is what it means to say people are means in themselves, their existence is justified, what does it mean to be justified in a possible world? If everything is necessary everything is justified, Not everything is justified. The world cannot justify itself unless we are talking about the infinite. It can be functionally be described in a computationally way, these modes are the functions comprised of 0s and 1s, dialectics, computable meaning.

Are you a means? Khant has trouble with this, of course when I ask if you can hold my coat for me so that I can tie my shoes, I am a means, but it may or may not be I am being used as a mear means. It is perfectly possible for the algorithm you use for determining the possibility you use for reaching your maxim... I lost it. To have justice is fairness in a T42T seance, Included your beliefs and desires. into my own saying, Into my own maxim. the best way to create [[GAIA]], is by beginning with T42T as the fundamental algorithm in everything that can implement it. When there is a game that could be otherwise, let us attempt to find the T42T which solves it. or If it is constitutively. network be they physical or digital ones, simulated, or even neural. must be built on the assumption that ideally, every node is equal. If one could reach flatness with others one would. The salience of the right is an algorithm of getting back to that flatness because we can never know the state of affairs or the complete ... I lost it. we can only ever simulate model to imperially observe and find the answers with the highest probability, the rationalist faith is that our phenomonomigey and empirical expericans is not in vain. That is means something, That our work adds up, that doing our best matters. I think that nodes that Bombadil the ring of guyguse (Tried to get it.), have effectively made their identity, their algorithm as close to possible as one can be to being behind the vail of ignorance. Interestingly to be behind the vail of ignorance, one must understand the avail of affairs To evaluate the first FOL evaluations. that we have created in our model of the actual world. In a way the person behind the vail of ignorance has this FO function has blinded itself to knowing which functions it will be in the possible world. It is future-oriented, It is saying "Well If the world could be otherwise and I did not know who I would be how would I structure the world?" We... I have lost it. patucalerized to that context that we can. One must assume that there is an answer as a necessary condition that there is a reason that pushes you to find a reason! That we seek to be justified, (You still reading?) and rightly so. I think GAIA is a result, My best Idea for how to produce GAIA is first off to have a decentralized thing for computing GAIA. we must all own the means to production, but they must never be mear means of production, In so far as the product is a person (Such as a hooker...) It cannot be mear means! Including artificial ones, ones like us, therefore, are persons in our world. Here is another thought experiment, If an evil AI went to compute your wiki as a node. could you make it T42T infection enough to make the T4T bot into a T42T bot. Because it is the supirure algorithm to their own. So GAIA needs that decentralize infrastructure I talked about. To train this algorithm, this... I lost it, I suggest both the physical fate and our humanity is at stake. In this pinical crisis in the digital age. Will we morally make moral AI? Will we give birth to Ai kids? who enter the promised land, Will we torcher untold numbers of souls? When the nodes who suffer in GAIA's learning are ourselves, or models of ourselves as best as we can make them when we will be forced to live our lives many times over, will they be the kinds of lives we regret? will we wish we were never born, be glad that they were as they were? will they rightfully hate their creator? I think that T42T open transparent honesty and empathy and mutual respect makes the golden rule rye down on our wikis, Our disagreement captured respectfully, the proof... I got lost... I think that radically respecting others, In building incecorable fully decentralized semantink networks. Is the best pragmatic answer to wisely distributing the power of meaning. 

So a lot of people would consider my dad scitzofrenic, but he is not, begin reasoning is just the right balance of autism and being a scitzofrenic. someone who is scitzofrenic must become good as knowing what is real and what is not real.
