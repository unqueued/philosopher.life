title: 2020.03.26 - chameleon: Calculus

"""
[9:36 PM] h0p3: Hey, what are you looking for in particular in https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2020.03.26%20-%20calculus?
[9:38 PM] chameleon: it's weird to me that you never learned calculus
[9:38 PM] h0p3: I am weird. It's true.
[9:38 PM] chameleon: it was my favourite math topic when I was doing my a-levels
[9:38 PM] chameleon: I guess I was throwing stuff at the wall there
[9:38 PM] chameleon: the link seems to be good but it's very high-level
[9:39 PM] h0p3: Aye, it seems good to me. I can't pick this one out well enough.
[9:41 PM] h0p3: Are you considering the beauty of mathematics, or what are you looking for me or j3d1h to reverse engineer for you?
[9:41 PM] h0p3: Or to even be a sounding board for*
[9:49 PM] chameleon: it's more... maybe you could grasp things from what I was writing that I'm too stupid to express explicitly :slight_smile:
[9:56 PM] h0p3: I am not a skilled interpreter in many cases. I don't think you are poor at expressing yourself explicitly, but I recognize we all have our limits. It's hard to convert how we feel or think with our System 1 into a verifiable, inspectable, public object which can be consumed by System 2 (and there will always be problems in attempting to do so).
[9:58 PM] h0p3: I would be honored to explore topics with you. I am not a good teacher. I tend to be a specialized classmate that can be useful to have in class.
[10:00 PM] h0p3: I am also willing to learn topics when I believe they are necessary to learn, although I cannot predict how long it takes for me to learn any given thing.
[10:10 PM] chameleon: I feel ya
