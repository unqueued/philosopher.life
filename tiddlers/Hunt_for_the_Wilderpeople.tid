title: Hunt for the Wilderpeople

//Here I pretend to be the philosophically inclined, redpilled version of Dr. Fred de Rosset, blessed be His name.//

This film is a drug. It is, as they say: //dope//. It has clear cult classic appeal. It has the impact and hallmarks of a //Feel Good Film//. It was uplifting. Of course, that which makes me happy in the short-term does not necessarily make me happy in the long-term. Know thyself, and thus, know thy drugs. It makes me happy, therefore a grumpy, redpilled fool like me doesn't trust it, especially because people made money from it. This movie made me happy. But, should it make me happy? 

Perhaps you think I'm sabotaging my own happiness. Perhaps you think I'm ungratefully looking a gift-horse in the mouth. Perhaps you think this movie doesn't actually have anything to say, that it doesn't mean anything, and that I should just enjoy it without thinking about it. I'm not so convinced. There is an element of sophistication to this movie which we should not overlook. Of course, you might claim that rigorously examining the film would be missing the very point of it, as if entering into the Heideggerian Present-at-Hand mode is exactly what it is preaching to us not to do. As far as I can tell, this movie fits into that canonically patterned oscillation between the Romantic and the Rational in the history of the Great Human Conversation. It cries out to us about the relationship between our Fastminds and Slowminds. Pay attention! 

I cannot neglect the profound components of non-cognitivism and religiosity in this story. Forgive my distrust in or of my feelings. If you had experienced the pain I have, passing through the spiritual fires and existential school of hardknocks I did, you would be wary too. My goal is to understand the intellectual substances I put in my mind in roughly the same respect that I understand the physical substances I put in my body. Why does it make me feel and think the way I do? How does it affect me? Is it good or bad for me, and why? Let us be wise in our critical examination of this film. 

I must parse this experience and investigate the phenomenology of this film like I would any mind-altering substance. It's a matter of risk analysis. What is the core of its memetic power and affective hold over me? Why should I take its message to be authoritative? Why should I trust the motives of the authors? While it feels like I'm in the author's good hands, that doesn't make it true. Have I been sent a propagandistic memetic bomb or door to utopia?  Is there a meaningful message, or was this merely an enjoyable ~2-hour masturbatory film? Do I have an existential threat to neutralize or a friendly antidote to my own poisoned soul to embrace? The devil always looks delicious. Raise your shields to full power!

Not to be dismissed, even parts of the film itself could support the claim that I'm justified in employing a Straussian interpretation of it, in being: rebellious, hypercurious, imaginative, analytic, and paranoid about its message. Although, ultimately, it is not clear what counts as the definition or role of reason in this story. Humor is disarming. Does it always tell us the truth though? Hmmm...not obviously. The worry is that this is a rhetorical Trojan horse, a heretical device. Do not //Slip//!

What does this movie really hold in store for us? What is the meaning and purpose of this film? Why was it made? Who is it for? Who are the villains and heroes of this story, and why? What are its themes, aphorisms, quotes, and principles? Why is it so successful at affecting me and people like me? Why does this drug hit us so strongly? 

In a sense, I'm begging to see how the sausage of my-happiness-from-watching-this-film is made. While dissecting such experiences may cause them to lose some of their luster, I do so as a matter of practical wisdom. I'm here to interrogate my drug-dealers and scrutinize their wares.

!!Opening Intuitions, Feelings, and Gut Instincts:

To start, I often compare things I don't know to things I know better for illumination. 

If Tim Burton made a [[Deadpool]]'ed, [[Indiana Jones]]'ed version of Happy-Happy-Joy-Joy Kiwi [[Deliverance]] it would be this film (you can bet your ass that M. Night Shyamalan came rainbows watching this movie too). I gutturally associate this film with [[Lost in Translation]], [[The Royal Tenenbaums]], [[The Grand Budapest Hotel]], some [[Little Miss Sunshine]], and a hit of [[Shaun of the Dead]]. It has some of what I take to be the usual Oceanic senses of humor, aesthetic, and storyline (at least for the handful of Oceanic films and shows that are famous enough that I've seen them [I'm not a connoisseur]). 

Like any good theatre, this movie hits you right in feels, a variety of them. 

The Hunt for the Wilderpeople:

* satirically lambastes the Kiwi judicial system
** It takes particular aim at racial discrimination, especially found from colonial to indigenous populations

* is poignant, charming, sentimental without being unbearably clich√© or boring. 

* is eccentric, idiosyncratic, and charged.

* is disorienting, absurd, and slapstick

* is super cute, warm, and ironic.<<ref "1">>
** It is so cute that a non-trivial portion of fat people in our population who are overly-sensitive trigger-warning-prone about their weight would laugh at the fat jokes because they are that fucking cute.
** It's cuteness allows it to touch us. We are willing to make ourselves vulnerable to it.
** It's absurdly GIF-quotable.

* is deadpan farce.
** It causes you to burst out laughing at its absurdities. It's a work of art.
** It's filled with a series of exaggeratedly fortunate and unfortunate accidents.
*** It's supposed to feel serendipitous, "wonderful" in the sense of "fanciful," and ultimately religious.
** They stuck their tongue in my cheek. 
** It's realistic and unrealistic at the same time. The contradictions stream out, and because we can disarm the contradictions by accepting its humor, it becomes surreal to us.
** It is absurdly redpilled in some respects, and absurdly bluebilled in others.

* rides the edge of not being disarming enough.
** It's incredibly optimistic while being hilariously tragic. 
*** You want to be cynical as you watch it, but God damnit, it's just too cute and funny.
** is filled with hope that is temptingly believable.
** It's like we're experiencing strong anti-hate emotions while running through an obstacle course designed to make us hate.
** It damns society while forgiving it.
** It forces you to empathize with the characters, and some of the jokes pull you out of empathy. It's like you are zooming in and out of empathy.

* is fast-paced in its delivery of conversations and literally sprints through the chaptered plot-line.
** Character development is honed to an art-form in how quickly the audience comes to understand and love these characters. 
** The scenes are so sparse yet rhythmic.

* has bad-on-purpose B-rated-film audio.
** It's retarded bad, and it adds to the comedic effect of the film. 

* feels like an R-rated PG movie.
** It's got some Disneyfied (closest to [[The Lion King]] in multiple respects) [[Kill Bill]] gore action going on.

----

!! Characters:

There aren't many characters worth examining in this story. It is very brief in a sense.

* Ricky Baker
** is a fat, delinquent protagonist who we initially see as having no future in society.
** is a wild child hooligan outcast of civilization. Whatever kind of wilderness there is in civilization, he seems to have explored it.
** is not loved. His own bloodmother abandons him. Nobody wants Ricky, except Bella and Kahu.
*** Paula only wants him insofar as he is useful to her career or other aspirations.
**** Ricky is a nuisance, professional marker, and a number to process to Paula.
*** Kahu's father appears to use and objectify Ricky as well.
** calls his dog Tupac instead of a matching "Zig" to Hec's "Zag."
** struggles to be self-sufficient, but in pursuit of that comes to recognize the value in being dependent upon others. He does want family.

* "Aunt" Bella
** is pragmatic, brutally honest, filled with gusto, and has a healthy dose of wilderness in her.
** is spiritual and attempts to live off the land (although, obviously doesn't when it suits her).
** pierces Ricky's defenses right out of the gate, but at the same time pokes fun at him almost mercilessly.
** offers dangerous options and puts Ricky in riskier scenarios than we might expect a motherly figure to do.
** passes away very abruptly.
** took pity on Hector. Bella didn't seem to need anybody, but rather needed people to take care of. 
*** Hector needs Bella's help. There is an asymmetry of needs here.
** is the Earth mother figure. She is warm, nurturing, loving, but not safe.

* Hec, "Uncle" Hector
** oozes fake machismo (Neill is quintessentially not that in any of his movies) which is meant to drive the cartoonish picaresque wilderness storyline.
** is an illiterate ex-con manslaughterer turned half-savage bushman, but oddly enough has a hard to pin down civility about him.
*** He doesn't seem to trust language in general.
*** He slowly comes to appreciate the value of reading and literary self-expression
** is stoic and self-sufficient.
** is remote, at times rude, mildly misanthropic, and prefers nature to civility.
** has an unclear but somehow believable connection to his wife Bella. 
** doesn't want to father Ricky.
*** After some negotiating, Hector begrudgingly takes care of Ricky in the bush. At the end, Hector learns to read and function in society as well. Ricky has an impact on Hector, and vice versa. They empathize with each other, and it's the core of their survival in the wilderness.
*** They obviously have much in common, despite the oil-and-water vibe, as they are both victims of "civilization."

* Paula
** is a  bureaucratically motivated social worker.
** hunts Ricky and Hec.
** chants "No Child Left Behind." 
** undergoes a kind of Dolores Umbrification.
** isn't an authority whom we should trust. 
*** Her motives and execution are all suspect.

* Psycho Sam
** is a paranoid, wiry lunatic who is delusionally detached from reality.
*** It is most unclear what counts as valid authority in this film, but Psycho Sam's character is meant to motivate the claim that we must trust authorities beyond ourselves though.
** He's a bad example of merging the urban and the bush. He doesn't do it in a healthy way. 
*** Psycho Sam isn't naked, so he hasn't gone completely crazy.
*** He's not naked, but he's half-naked. On the front, he has clothes on, but on the back-end, he's gone bush.
***Part of the problem is that he is alone. He doesn't have someone to balance him. 
** Hector rejects civilization, although seemingly in a more sane way than Psycho Sam.

* The Minister
** is played by the director of the film.
*** He's breaking the fourth wall, in a sense.
** has a message for us. But, what is it?

* Kahu
** I do not understand her role at all, except for us to assume there is a kind of undue hope for Ricky.

!!Quotes and Dialogue Analysis:

I was going to do a complete analysis of the transcript, but I'm not convinced it is necessary. It's probably not worth it, and I don't see hints of a deeper narrative to inspect (even if I don't know what it means). If for some reason I believe my analysis is wrong though, I may need to revisit this option.

<<<
One day you're here, and the next day you're in a box
<<<

Yup. Classic. Carpe diem. Yolo. Buddhism knows what it do.

<<<
All Eyes on Me
<<<

Perhaps a playful knock at Millenials, or humanity, or maybe it is to be taken more literally.

<<<
You know, sometimes in life, it seems like there's no way out- like a sheep trapped in a maze designed by wolves. And you know that if you're ever in that situation, there are always two doors to choose from. And through the first door- oh, it's easy to get through that door- and on the other side waiting for you are all the nummiest treats you can imagine- Fanta, Doritos, L&P, Burger Rings, Coke Zero. But you know what? There's also another door, not the Burger Ring door, not the Fanta door; another door that's harder to get through. Guess what's on the other side? Anyone want to take a guess? Vegetables? N-No, not vegeta- No. WOMAN : Jesus? You would think Jesus. I thought Jesus the first time I-I-I-I came across that door. It's not Jesus. It's another door. And guess what's on the other side of that door? WOMAN : Jesus. Jesus. Yeah, Jesus. He's tricky like that, Jesus. So let us pray, to Jesus, please, and make it a bit easier to get through those doors, uh, to find you and your bounty of delicious confectionary. Thank you, Selena. Take it away.
<<<

This is probably the most cryptic but important dialogue in the film. The Minister just is the director. He's breaking the fourth wall to tell us something. What is he really saying? It seems like he doesn't actually answer the question in any meaningful way. That might be the point. I don't know. It obviously has a great deal of sarcasm in it. Nietzsche would be amused.

<<<
It's not a thing. It's just- You just get it. It's a... Oh, it's a way of, um- it's a way of figuring things out without having to think too hard or... or talk, more importantly. You know, most people who die in the bush- they're found naked. Ew. Yeah, they panic, and they think their clothes are slowing them down. They throw them away, and then the cold gets to them. But the trick is- this is the knack- you stay calm, you look for water, you follow it to high ground until you can see what's going on.

This was actually genius. It was one of the clearest, most direct examples of [[Fastmind]] virtue-theoretic reasoning I've ever seen in a film. It could hardly have been more direct, except for being more technical.

It is befitting that it is not explained in a philosophical rigorous manner, using the standard terms of art. Virtue theory's argumentation towards inarticulacy, non-cognitivism, quietism, innate, nature-based, faster-acting, emotional reasoning is crucial. It argues for affective rationality in the face of a frontal-lobe rationality mindset. It's a key to practical wisdom. It's about having the right dispositions, salient perceptions, and virtue-theoretically trained emotions and gutteral, blink-of-an-eye inferences about the "moral" world. It's methodical means to pursuing eudaimonia.

<<<
Oh Sinner Man, Where are you going to run to?
<<<

Perhaps a red herring. Likely not.

<<<
You don't trade family for anything.
<<<

I know many that do. Where's the argument kid? If family just is a social construct, and we make of it what we do, this could just be relativized into nothingness. I like the thicker than blood approach. Taking it to the Nth degree can be non-intuitive for most people I know.

!! Keywords: 

* Ornamental
* Rickytown
* The Knack
* Gangster -> Outlaw -> Skux

I have nothing to say about these at the moment, even though there is plenty that could be said for them. 

---

!! Themes:

* There are deep asymmetries in how different kinds of animals are treated. 
** The murdering of the pigs. The rejoice in violence towards them. The smaller animals were skinned as well. You gotta' eat, yeah. But, you don't hunt horses, and you protect your dogs.
* How grief is handled
** Hector stuck Bella in a box. Ricky takes her with them, converts Hector. They take her to where the sky and the Earth meet to let her go. 
* The extinct bird represents this idea that man can live outside the structure of society.
** They are going to find that bird. It is a kind of freedom.
* It has the nostalgic, sirenical call of Romanticism. 
* Escapism, Survivalism not just on a physical level, but also on a mental level.
* Authority
** It examines authority and those who don't fit the mold. In the end, they have to find a way to work within the system yet still be themselves and escape it.
* Pop Culture
** There is an interesting mix of the old legends, the Maori, and pop-culture references. They all take pop-culture to be a new religious iconography. They see themselves as characters in pop-culture. Pop culture is a lens through which the young "process" themselves and the world around them.
*** That's ironic, because I ask myself which character in this movie I'm like. Who do I personally identify with on the show, and when?
**** Psycho Sam, a bit.
* Food is odd
** Paula gives granola, dried fruit, and chocolate
** Bella gives you meat, sausage, pancakes, and "real" food.
** Hector gives you eel. 
** Ricky tries to eat stupid food. Salad and treebark.
** Psycho Sam has food that ought to be civilized. He has dusty biscuits that aren't good anymore.
** Kahu, the chick on the horse, his first true love, also gives him sausage. 
*** He ends up with her and her dad.
* Family isn't defined by blood but by shared experiences.
** Memetic networks, rather than genetic networks, are the fundamental structure of family.
* It's got that "O Brother, Where Art Thou" outlaw protagonists searching for meaning, freedom, and family kind of thing.
* Haikus
** Some dark shit in them.
* Coming of age
** Not your normal telling of it
* Growth

!! Meaning:

Whatever it means, it is meant to hit us right in the feels. The memes are strong with this one. It has a message too on the order of magnitude of [[Dogma]] and [[Donnie Darko]], or not?

The funeral scene, in handling the pain of evil, is the heart of the message. The Sermon of the Doors was meant to show us that turning away from impulsive, short-sighted, psychopathic desires of the world and taking the other, harder-to-pass through looking door of Empathy will actually make us happier. Or, maybe it's going for a less prescriptive existential claim. I'm not sure.


---

!! Purpose:

* To make us believe in humanity again.
* To cause us to empathize with humans again in a respect we lost before.

I'm okay with that.

I despise how it fails to give us good reasons to accept its blind optimism and hope.
