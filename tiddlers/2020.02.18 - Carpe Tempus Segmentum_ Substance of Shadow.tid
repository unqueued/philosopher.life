title: 2020.02.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Substance of Shadow

* Woke at 11
** My head, ouch. Okay. Need water.
* Meditation, vits, coffeebliss, [[Fitness Routine]]
* Offspring check
** My daughter was hacking away at her wiki, my son still asleep.
*** He's not being careful with his alarm clock.
* Dialecture
* Failed to find a solution for [[GR6A]]. =/.
** It's pretty close to a problem I have too, as I'd like otherwise deadlinks for tag pages to do that exact work generically. Maybe we'll find the answer in the future.
* Read+Write
** Loving the mic. We're practicing remote.
* Dialecture
** [[My Rainbow]] and [[Self-Dialectic]].
** My daughter has been a razor with strong descriptions today.
** Offspring both argued successfully that we will wait to engage in [[hyperconversations]]. Alright, so we wait.
** Thought about [[kicks]]' and [[DeathOfRobinhood]]'s words.
* Cleaning, hanging stuff
* [[JRE]] called.
** He's fucking sick again. This is crazy. Maybe their immune systems are weaker? Could just be all the public traffic from the baby. Rebecca hasn't recovered either. Two different illnesses, it appears. 
*** They are doing a good job of keeping their head above water, relying upon their good savings and support network.
**** My brother has become so much more frugal since he became a dad. He spends his resources generously with [[others]], but not on himself. 
** Talked about my penis not working as well as I'd like. 
*** I'm glad that my brother can laugh with me about it. 
** Had a Birbiglia discussion again. 
*** While I see the spirit animal claim, and while I concede plenty of commonalities for him, I think there's a significant difference between him and Birbiglia: my brother actually cares about doing a good job as a father, and that's exactly why he's been so hesitant to become one. Birbiglia motioned marginally at that concern, but it was not the primary reason.
*** I can appreciate that my brother feels guilty and embarrassed about it. I think he's too hard on himself here. No his actions aren't as ideal as he'd like, but he's been fair in navigating here.  
** He told me about Matthew actually being frightened of seeing my brother with a tissue in his nose. The baby hasn't been frightened before, to my brother's knowledge. I'm not even sure what it means to say the baby experienced fear well enough, but he did.
*** My brother is good at understanding his baby.
*** Brought up [[MWF]] shaving in front of us to show us the transformation.  
** He didn't have much time or energy to talk (quite understandably), but I'm grateful that he took the time to call me.
* Walk and talk with myself
* Snuggles with wife
** Her period is harsh AF. Taking it out of her.
** Thought the dialectical concern with estradiol levels made sense.
* //Battlestar Galactica//
* Red Beans and Rice
* More thinking about P2P
* Read+Write
* Blankets for folks found.
* Clean
* Sleep by 4
