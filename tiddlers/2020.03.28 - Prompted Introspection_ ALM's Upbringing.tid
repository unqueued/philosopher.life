title: 2020.03.28 - Prompted Introspection: ALM's Upbringing

!! Consider some of the parents others had growing up. What type of person would you be if you had grown up in those situations?

If I had grown up in [[ALM]]'s place in his household, I'd have been forced to play more sports. Although I'd enjoyed the competition, it would have been a waste of my time. There's significant dark-triadic features running through his mother's side of the family (I've met a decent number), and that would not have been fun to deal with. Life would have been wildly simpler, more stable, predictable, rooted, and discernable. Of course, I'd have been more likely to be trapped in a smaller world of evil. Would I have met a person like [[h0p3]]? Haha. Sheeeeit, ninja. No.
