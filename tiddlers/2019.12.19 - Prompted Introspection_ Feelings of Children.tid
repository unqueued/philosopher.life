title: 2019.12.19 - Prompted Introspection: Feelings of Children

!! How do you think the new child would feel?

Oh no, I have no idea what this question is about! What in the hell are you talking about, Samwise? 

I have no idea what a new child feels. They clearly have intense feelings, a wide range, and the answer depends on the context. I think the feeling and perceptual abilities of newborns and toddlers are simply jaw-dropping. 

My daughter is fairly neurotypical, and I swear even her personality as a 1yo shows up as a teenager; she's always been sensitive, expressive, and shocking in some of the leaps she makes. Perhaps I'm a poor judge as an autist though. It's just weird to see even young children almost innately make inferences and empathize in ways that I've had to work so hard to reverse engineer.
