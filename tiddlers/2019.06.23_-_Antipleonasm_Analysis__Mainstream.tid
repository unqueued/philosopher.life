If I was in the mainstream, I'd began to ask myself what I'm doing wrong.

Perhaps I don't know how to draw the mainstream lines. [[Saint Chomsky]] is a celebrity to me. Anyone who has studied anything even related to linguistics has run into him, and a non-trivial percentage of Overton Windowed persons have heard of him. He's not allowed to have a voice across any major platform though. The average person probably doesn't care too much what he has to say (though they should, and I think many people would recognize the value of what he says these days if they were going to listen). 

I [[hope]] he becomes wildly popular among all classes and generations. He won't, as he points out. He says the ugly truth. It has been a privilege to think about some of his famous quotes for these months of [[Antipleonasm Analysis]].
