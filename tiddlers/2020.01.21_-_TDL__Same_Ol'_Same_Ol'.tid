* Still can't find the modem. Perhaps I need to go purchase one (I swear I have one though...I didn't toss it, right?). 
** Look again.
* Need help with couches. 
* Tacos
* If we can, let's see the car. I'd like to have that small vehicle available for her asap.
** Although, her immediate supervisor lives very closeby, and has already offered to rideshare when necessary.
* Rooms need a big push. Offspring have just failed, utterly.
* Sleep moar.
