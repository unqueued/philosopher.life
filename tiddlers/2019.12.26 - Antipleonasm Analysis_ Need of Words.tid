title: 2019.12.26 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Need of Words

!! Respond to the following gem:

: No need of words, trust deeds.

I guess I don't need your words? Or, you mean that I shouldn't trust words, only deeds. But, when I put your words into action wrt your words, I have no need of them? But, your words are the result of a deed (and, I'm not qualified to tell you what isn't fundamentally performative about language).

I am a fan of the spirit of this claim. I'm not convinced that need and trust are the fitting words here (nor do I see why that relationship is best). Need for what, and trust for what? Meh. I'd prefer to say that words are necessary but insufficient in so many contexts. I'm not going to peel words out of deeds so cleanly though. Unfortunately, I'm not in a great position to define what kind of action in a moral medium isn't linguistic or symbolic. Fuck. This is a much weaker claim that I thought it was.
