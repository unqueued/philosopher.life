title: 2019.10.12 - Prompted Introspection: Gift Question Again

!! If you could give any gift in the world, what would you give and to whom?

Oh, Lady Melisandre, you do me the great honor again. Alright, [[TPK]] [[Socialism]], a gift which can only be given by everyone on the planet to everyone. That gift is in this world. I suppose you mean a giant piece of material, but it turns out that one could probably re-arrange the world, some emergent object, which maximizes the odds of a revolutionary [[TPK]] on the spot (and, you've not even given me time limits). The question is about me giving a gift from my shoes.
