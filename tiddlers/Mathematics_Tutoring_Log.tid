!! About:

//Be wise, be humble, and be kind.//

We're going to walk word-by-word, step-by-step through //Life of Fred// from pre-school through Calculus (or however high we can go). I'm going to introduce my children to this world through the best medium I can find. We are going to walk to the doorstep of Mathematics and pass through it. I want my kids to see and have what I never did.

This is one project of many to help my children love mathematics. We are going to grind like I know how to grind. We are going to live and breathe mathematics. At the end, we are going to walkaway better for it. We will see the landscape. We will have built something that lasts for their lifetimes. 

Your children are bottlenecked here, and you must show them the way. There is a landscape to explore, a world to reinterpret, and a set of tools that open doors. You must not push them too hard. Be wise in how you set your expectations, in how you motivate, and in how you teach. This is a race in which you must pretend it isn't a race.<<ref "1">>

As always, be a good father.

!! Principles:

* Read the lessons, you solve the problems, talk about the answers, rinse and repeat.
* 30 minute increments with 5 minute breaks, until it is time for lunch, stopping, or some other consideration.
* No useless interruptions, but good questions are required. This is professor/student relationship time. 
* We are going to do it the slow, hard way in the fastest and most narratively interesting way I know at the moment.
* Notes will be taken in our wikis, including answers to problems sets. We will build trophies for ourselves.

!! Focus:

* I have stopped for now. After 6 weeks of work over 2 months (2 weeks were off), it is clear that I need to separate my children here. My son wishes to pursue Khan Academy for mastery, and my daughter will continue pushing solo through the course. They were tutored in algebra, and that's a great start. While overly ambitious, we really accomplish enormous amounts. I'm very pleased.

!! Dreams:

* I want my children to take Calculus at 13 years old at Milligan College. I can get them there. They really can do it. It's on us all to do a good job. This is a goal we can work on together.
** And, even if don't, for whatever reason, I want them to have the best Mathematics education I can give them with what I have available to me. I will do so kindly with gentle expectations.
