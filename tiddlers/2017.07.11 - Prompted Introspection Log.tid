!! What was the best news you ever received?

Probably the day I heard I would be receiving a full scholarship at Tulane for a PhD in philosophy. It felt like the heavens opened up for me. That was some damned good news to me. 

What is news? When my wife agreed to marry me, it was someone telling me something I didn't know. When the doctors told me my children were healthy, ditto. That may have been news. These are obviously far more important to me than my education. I guess they don't fit the question so well for me because I had more faith, anticipation, and assumptions that these would work out. They were less surprising to me, although they were relieving and wonderful!

I guess what makes "best news" takes on a kind of unanticipated element to me. Maybe that's not rational.
