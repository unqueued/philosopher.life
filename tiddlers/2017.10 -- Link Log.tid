!! Audit:

* This month has been a flood of information.
* I am linking more and more to aggregation sources.
* I've added several archetypal comments, and in doing so, I've had an easier time categorizing the "harder to categorize."
* I continue to have many links for //my dearest//.
** I have a harder time coming up with links for my son, but he is young.
* Archetypal comments allow me to be lazy in my evaluation and commentary.
** This can be a bad thing.
* I have a very wide variety of sources.
** Few standard news sources like Reuters, AJZ, and other cultural/governmental looks though.
*** Is this a bad thing? I only have so much I can look at. I need meta and analysis above all else. I rely upon expertise all around me.
* I feel like I'm controlling the flow, but that I can't truly process it all.
* My anxiety is correlated in timing with my Link Log expression...
* This is stream-of-conscious writing like [[/b/]]
* I've found many rabbitholes and sources this month.
* Increasingly redpilled.
* I have focused a lot on China and Russia.
* It was an extremely productive month. Good job!
