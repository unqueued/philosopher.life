<<footnotes "r" "I've decided to use RSS when I want to see everything that comes out asap. If I can afford to not see it all, if it requires hyperreading because there is too much, or it's not relatively time sensitive to me, then RSS isn't worth it. Also, I'm resisting 'fun' RSSes with all my might. So many webcomic drugs I want to mainline right now.">>
