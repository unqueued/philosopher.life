* Cmon. =)
** You are, like, the worst, dude. 
* MWC and Goblins are joining the crew. Show 'em how it's done.
** Probably end at 4:30. Your wiki crew also needs lab time.
* I guess we're doing ribs tomorrow. We have time. 
** I've been in the mood for stirfry. There's great options. 
* Maybe redo the way your laundry and clothing system works. You can make it even easier on yourself. Why not? 
** A few baskets would handle it nicely. It's not like you use drawers; it's just a fucking shelf dude. Let's go for it!
* [[m17]] need not be terribly functional (I just don't have much writing time while I'm with my students). But, if we move, I need to be ready?
