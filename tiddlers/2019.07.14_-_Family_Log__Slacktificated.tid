** Kind of good!
* j3d1h
** Normal
* k0sh3k
** Headachy - stupid rain
* h0p3
** Sleep schedule has gone even more bonkers w/out the kids here; but, overall, I've had very little stress

---
!! What happened last week? How and why did it happen? Name at least one happy and one unhappy thing.

* 1uxb0x
** I've been the one mostly washing the dishes
** Liked being at JRE and Rebecca's house
* j3d1h
** Been having a lot of fun at Uncle JRE's
** Technical difficulties (PLEASE STAND BY) getting everything in the wiki
* k0sh3k
** I got the ILL manual done
** I over-enjoyed some honey bourbon
* h0p3
** Had an interview; pleased that I got to have an interview, but sad to see it really was not a good fit
** Enjoyed my week; this time away from the kids has been a very interesting time for reflection and thinking about what life might be like 20 years from now, or what life might have been like if I hadn't had kids
*** It's also been good to have some perspective on ways to not stress so much when the kids are here and how to make the most of the time when they are

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I think I mowed the lawn well for a beginner
** I'm glad that you've been finding ways to be helpful while you're visiting; it's part of being a good guest, to find ways to help your hosts
** You've been a decent sport about the VR system, 'cause I keep beating you at Rock, Paper, Scissors
** I'm grateful and surprised that you did your wiki work over the course of the week - not everything, but I'm thankful you had stuff. You proved my assumption that you wouldn't have anything wrong, and I'm grateful for that.
* j3d1h
** I'm happy that I actually cooked a couple times this week, 'cause I didn't think I'd be doing that
** Thank you for giving me the rest of your game-play time often; it's really kind of you
** You did a good job hacking your way back into your Prompted Introspection
** Thank you for being so easy to get in touch with over this week
* k0sh3k
** I finished the ILL manual and training, and I think I did a really good job with it; also, I finished wiki revision! (Yay!!)
** Thanks for writing down my hair care stuff
** Thank you for helping me with my cover letters and for thinking about it with me
** Thank you for being patient while I didn't respond to you the whole week - I'm sorry
* h0p3
** I think I've done a lot of FTO work this week that has been fruitful
** Thanks for putting up with the technical problems and helping me fix them - specifically, for my devices for this trip
** I'm glad you did the interview - but I'm more glad that you turned down a position that was immoral; your integrity keeps showing through
** Thank you for dealing with us being gone - it probably has been a bit weird
