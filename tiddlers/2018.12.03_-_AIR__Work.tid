I listened quite a bit this conversation.

My brother is still thinking about looking for new work. He may have to move away, and he is worried about his roommate. He is exhausted and has no time or opportunity to learn like he wants. He's having a hard time keeping his head above water: capitalism sucks. I'm feeling more hopeful for my brother than he is. Hrm. Maybe I am not understanding clearly enough.

He told me his phone is having a hard time messaging Apple products. He's calling me through Signal itself.

I brought him up to speed on what's happening in my life (basically the contents of my wiki). After that, he had to go.

Hope your day is not terrible, and I hope your boss looses his voice forever.
