* I often type the exact name of the tiddler I'm looking for in the search bar, and I wish anytime I wrote an exact match, that would be shown at the top of the search list.
** I have no idea how to fix that.
*** Nm. [[j3d1h]] pwned it. Includes ol'voldy too. Case sensitive, and "Exact match:" doesn't pop up unless you strike.
* https://flibbles.github.io/tw5-relink/ does not work in the wiki.  Propagating tiddler name changes across links is strong. 
** No idea about the performance, and if it breaks, it could get ugly.
