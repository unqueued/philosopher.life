!! Audit:

* These are monstrously huge. My poor computer has been taking the hit. Chrome, memory whore that it is, has been wrecking it. 
* I keep adding new archetypes. I should keep that up. 
* I have a ton of links that don't have commentary. I'm okay with that. This is, again, a collection above all else. Annotation is nice, but not required.
* Most of the time, my children do not even look at the links I've collected for them.
