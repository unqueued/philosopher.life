title: 2019.02.13 - Prompted Introspection: Competitiveness

!! Are you competitive? Tell about a competition that you participated in.

My 5th grade class was the only class in the history of Mannsville Elementary to defeat the 6th graders in tug of war during their wonderful track'n'field event. We were the champions, I tell you what.

Of course, I am competitive. I adore games. Competition offers me a benchmark to interpret my progress. I have worked hard not to misinterpret how it defines my value. My goal is to compete with myself, even as a metagame which emerges from competing with others. 

Dialectics must serve a purpose. Wrestling must be in the name of something. What is worth fighting for? 

As I age, I find I'm more selective about what games I participate in. Even the terms of winning continue to evolve. Most of the time, winning for me is about the degree to which the people I'm playing with fulfill their potential in the dialectic [[irwartfrr]]. Don't get me wrong, sometimes that means I must do by dead-level best to win the initial game. [[The End]] is what matters. Did we do our best? In the end, while my effort influences others, I can only evaluate myself on whether or not I did my best.
