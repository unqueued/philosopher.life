title: 2019.09.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Capitalism and Catholicism

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Those who claim a natural link between capitalism and democracy are cheating with the facts in the same way the Catholic Church cheats when it presents itself as the "natural" advocate of democracy and human rights against the threat of totalitarianism - as if it were not the case that the Church accepted democracy only at the end of the nineteenth century, and even then with clenched teeth, as a desperate compromise, making it clear that it preferred monarchy, and that it was making a reluctant concession to new times.

It is disingenuous to ignore history and the dialectical [[4DID]]s of hyperobjects even as large as the Catholic Church. Of course, the explicit memeplex of decentralizing power via [[The Golden Rule]] is several millennia old in that lineage, including syncretism. A Kantian Neo-Platonist is going to look at the Two Greatest Commandments in [[awe]]; it captures the Kierkegaardian problem and henotic foundationalism so [[antipleonasmic]]ally, and so there are contexts in which I think they have been and are //supposed to be// the obvious and most straightfoward "natural"<<ref "n">> advocates of democracy and the rights of persons. Of course, we all should be.

I'm not apologizing for the abuses of [[power]] I generally find in almost everyone who wields it, including this ancient self-described Universal body which has historically been a corrupted state actor all too often. The Catholic Church has many individuals who have been responsible for capitalism as well. We must throw stones here, however, I have also met The Remnant before, [[gems]] and my [[others]]. So, the caveat must be presented. It's difficult to speak of it monolithically, but we must. I am sure Sir [[Zizek]] knows all this as well.

Here is the difference for me: the Catholic church can possibly be a version of itself while being an advocate of democracy of human rights. Parts of them have done it, and some still do; it is possible for the whole to be righted with [[The Good]] (however unlikely). Capitalism, however, cannot be itself while advocating for democracy and human rights; that's not what capitalism is by the assumptions. Now, you might think egoism with some basic side-constraints counts, but you have already misunderstood the fundamental metaethical position at stake here. What counts as moral merit? Oh, it's not utility; there is a principle, [[The Moral Law]], which must precede it. You cannot build the [[Good]]will on selfishness without a hermeneutic circle that transforms selfishness into selflessness [[irwartfrr]].

Capitalists are openly aiming to enslave others; it is built into their very framework. Acting like they are democratic and in favor of human rights is a facade. It's not conceptually possible to respect the dignity of [[the other]], to be moral, to build radical decentralization, and to generate consistent sacrificial trust on the assumption that we ought to pursue our own self-interest before all else. That's the difference.
