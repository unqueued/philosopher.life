title: 2020.02.07 - Wiki Audit: The Remodeling

* Purge, retagging, dealiasing, fixing links, and minimal commentary.
* As usual, tempted to walk through the levels of these links. That is a very expensive thing to do. 
** [[The Remodeling]] is a triage when it comes to Dynamic content for now.
* Alright, for tagged content, I'm switching up to <<tag "Autogen">>.
** Will continue pushing that direction, and if I'm wrong, I can switch to [[firmcoding]] for them.
* Merged a purged into [[2019.01.29 - Wiki Audit: crypto]]
* Molecularization and munging for olevolded employment log and [[The Library at Mount Char]].
* [[j3d1h]]
** Set conditional reveal on "Dynamic" (unlikely) and "System" for [[X-Section]]
