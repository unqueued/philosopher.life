MON 12:36 PM
Thank you. =)
MON 12:36 PM
You too.
MON 12:36 PM
Tha K fully I have zero responsibility right now.
MON 12:36 PM
Gorgeous
MON 12:36 PM
I hope use the time responsibly.
MON 12:37 PM
you*
MON 12:37 PM
So far two weeks wasted besides the cigar box guitar.
MON 12:37 PM
Probably being hard on yourself. Plus, you have to rest.
MON 12:38 PM
I am hoping tomorrow I get 4-6 weeks more off and I want to do some deep work. Both mentally and physically.
MON 12:39 PM
Sounds like you need it!
MON 12:39 PM
/fingers-crossed
MON 12:39 PM
If I go back too soon lockheed risks I injuring myself on the job. Then it becomes a workers compensation issue.
MON 12:40 PM
I suspect I will get the time I need. I am. Making plans for the time. I have wasted enough already.
MON 12:41 PM
It is wonderful that you possibly have the opportunity to recover and rebuild.
MON 12:41 PM
Number 1 (lose as much weight as possible) Adkins/ paleo diet. (talked to jumis awhile. Back he has beat MS with diet and exercise and looks like a damn body builder)

No 2 get sober, like real sober, stop crutxhing. I. Have my anti anxiety when I need it for weekends only and outing events. Otherwise complete sobriety.

No 3 strengthen my body with physical therapy. (considering a 30day trial membership to a local gym) I can do alot of good using low weight high reps. Helping to exipididte the weight loss.

No 4 concentrate on working on my old truck. I have so much to do, including getting the transmission rebuilt,  assembly of. New engine, disk brake upgrade ect ect


My body is going to act like a bitch and I know I have to rest too. But in this time. I have to find out what my true limits are and I have to strengthen my core.
MON 12:49 PM
I suspect the reason I am. In pain is due to my massive increase in weight and loss of muscle. Too much senditary in my work and life.
MON 12:50 PM
I am going to push myself and my body and my mind. All at the same time. I hope I can be self disciplined enough to be able to succeed.
MON 12:51 PM
At least it sounds good =). I won't discredit complete failure. But I have to do work around the house to see if u can even return to working on helicopters.
MON 12:53 PM
Constant bending, twisting, up and down stands, up and down off floor or creepers. Hunched over in lots of very uncomfortable positions.
MON 12:54 PM
Well, I will join you in the weightloss goal.
MON 12:55 PM
If my body won't let. Me do it. I'll. Just have to move into the office I guess.
MON 12:55 PM
I am going to start Wednesday. The day after I get a full treatment plan.
MON 12:56 PM
I. Lost 40lbs in less than 4 months by diet alone.
MON 12:56 PM
Didn't exercise once. Lol
MON 12:56 PM
I began cheating on the weekends, I could. Have lost more.
MON 12:57 PM
Takes a year for your metabolism to register that is your official weight too.
MON 12:57 PM
I don't have nearly as much discipline; 40lbs in 4 months is outstanding.
MON 12:58 PM
I gained it all. Back. Plus another 30 lol
MON 12:58 PM
I was losing 1lb a day. Sometimes more, sometimes. Less. Usually right at 1lbs a day.
MON 12:59 PM
But moving from enjoying food to just eating to sustain was hard.
MON 12:59 PM
I remember I helped my sister in law move from Somerset to Georgetown. Her husband has two replacement hips. And she is older. So. I told. Her. If you box it up, I will load it up. I loaded an entire rental truck by myself. Of course I used dolls whenever I could
MON 1:02 PM
Long story short.
MON 1:02 PM
She got chicken that night. And u was still dieting. I asked for grilled.
MON 1:02 PM
All they had was crispy.
MON 1:02 PM
I remeber peeling the crispy off the chicken and throwing it in the garbage.
MON 1:02 PM
I was devestated but so proud of myself. To be OK with that.
MON 1:03 PM
I'm from Georgia and live in ky... Fried chicken is life blood.
MON 1:03 PM
Lol
MON 1:04 PM
I hear ya.
MON 1:04 PM
That's terrible.
MON 1:04 PM
It even sounds like blasphemy!
MON 1:04 PM
Lol. Guys at work were so unsupportive. They would sneak little Debbie's every where and definintly micro managed "watching and commenting" on everything I ate.
MON 1:06 PM
But at work was easy. The at home was hard.
MON 1:06 PM
Bifurcation between what your family eats and what you eat sucks.
MON 1:08 PM
I've found it easiest to do the fruits and veggies until dinner
MON 1:09 PM
then I can have what they are having, but try not to go overboard.
MON 1:09 PM
The wife eats healthy. Poor thing is just a bigger girl.
MON 1:09 PM
Yeah. The one plate thing.
MON 1:09 PM
I noticed at about week two my stomach had shrunk. And I was unable to finish my single heaping plate at dinner.
MON 1:10 PM
Lots of big salads. And meat and veggie
MON 1:10 PM
I have spent a few minutes. Maybe 20, re reading your response to an old convo and reviewing my online graphs thay explain the shifts and how. These thing effect the market. (all in isolation, holding all other things constant)
MON 3:00 PM
The theory is solid. I cannot refute. But we are not in a vacuum.
MON 3:01 PM
And as I spoke last night. I don't know that is quality use of my time. It gives me. No. Pleasure to attempt. To. Prove or persuade you.
MON 3:02 PM
I do not live by a golden rule. I don't have a moral compass that gives. Light to a greater cause. I am just an arrogant overeducated grease monkey.
MON 3:03 PM
That is the hazard of being my friend. =)
MON 3:04 PM
I will certainly be a pain to deal with then, lol.
MON 3:38 PM
I would suspect that you have been called  a pain in all manner of opinion.
MON 3:51 PM
Oh, yeah, lol
MON 3:51 PM
As I know I have. From friends, strangers, wife, child, family, and the like
MON 3:52 PM
:man-shrugging:
MON 3:52 PM
:joy:
MON 3:52 PM

MON 4:02 PM
I also read this article earlier and it just reminded me.
MON 4:02 PM
I like talking with you, learning from you, having difference of opinions with you. But I don't like arguing with you.
MON 4:03 PM
Never have.
MON 4:03 PM
Most people don't.
MON 4:03 PM
I'm pretty sure we narrowed our difference of opinion down to this one simple fact. I am not sympathetic to the average crack whore, you are.
MON 4:05 PM
We used those words as well.
MON 4:05 PM
Lol
MON 4:05 PM
I think it's a difference of opinion on whether or not there is objective truth, good, and rightness.
MON 4:05 PM
Is reality perception or is there a truth.
MON 4:06 PM
We have been here. More than once.
MON 4:07 PM
It was fun back when we got to hang out.
MON 4:07 PM
It will be something that comes again and again in our conversations.
MON 4:07 PM
I have incredible tact. I should have been a politician.
MON 4:08 PM
I can evade generally
MON 4:08 PM
Redirect. Defer
MON 4:09 PM
I let you. =)
MON 4:09 PM
Why wouldn't you? It's ok to be a pain. Nobody wants to be a straight up. Asshole.
MON 4:11 PM
=)
MON 4:11 PM
Lol
MON 4:11 PM
Uh, I actually think that you choice to deny the golden rule just is choosing to be a straight up asshole to Humanity. You are responsible for it. Maybe that's not what you want though.
MON 4:12 PM
That's what's at stake here.
MON 4:12 PM
It's my obligation to punish that behavior in dialectics. That's also part of the golden rule.
MON 4:13 PM
But I do treat others the way I want to be treated.
MON 4:20 PM
I have be touted by the ladies who work in the tool crib as the most polite and well mannered person there.
MON 4:21 PM
Lipstick and rouge.
MON 4:21 PM
I apologize quickly with my wife or child if I find myself. Out of line.
MON 4:22 PM
It is easy to be kind to those you love and even work with.
MON 4:22 PM
Even evil people are kind to family and friends.
MON 4:22 PM
What, say you, is expected of me?
MON 4:23 PM
Well, first, you say you deny you live by the golden rule above. I think you need to pick whether or not you do or intend to. =)
MON 4:23 PM
Maybe I drive too aggressively on the Interastate?
MON 4:23 PM
You drive inebriated too.
MON 4:24 PM
No, the golden rule means caring about those who you cannot benefit from in the least. it means that the starving kids down the street, 100 miles or 1000 miles away are serious problems that keep you up at night. You have to search for answers.
MON 4:25 PM
It's about not making an exception of yourself, enabling sociopathic egoism, and believing you don't really owe anyone anything unless it makes you happy
MON 4:25 PM
I suppose I shouldn't have said I don't love by the golden rule.
MON 4:28 PM
Live
MON 4:28 PM
I'm trying to make it through this life. I help, I care about the children more than any adult.
MON 4:29 PM
I argue aganist drug test for food stamps
MON 4:30 PM
To the idiots at work.
MON 4:30 PM
Explaining that just cause mommas a crack whore doesn't mean her kids should starve.
MON 4:30 PM
Those are admirable, of course. The Golden Rule extends quite far.
MON 4:31 PM
I'm noting simple things, but I am not dropping my status in this world to help the needy.
MON 4:31 PM
I have never volenteerwd at a soup kitchen or been a missinary
MON 4:32 PM
Maybe I am the asshole. I see that.
MON 4:32 PM
But I make no apology for my temperament or position.
MON 4:33 PM
And maybe I should.
MON 4:33 PM
I admire those who dedicate their lives to helping others and I would love to be in a position where I could not compromise my lifestyle but still help. Others.
MON 4:35 PM
"So it goes"
MON 4:37 PM
You kick me right in the feeling. I don't have but one left.
MON 4:40 PM
It stays hurt most of the time.
MON 4:41 PM
:pensive:
MON 4:41 PM
=(
MON 4:44 PM
I still think free markets with limited regulation and a proper safety net it the quickest and best way to bring economic prosperity to 3rd world. Nations. If only America could stop interfering, dumping, and using extensive protectionist measures.
MON 4:51 PM
I am not alone in that thought.
MON 4:52 PM
