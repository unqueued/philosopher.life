title: 2019.06.27 - Prompted Introspection: Luck Afloat

!! Are you ever lucky? Tell about it.

How am I supposed to top or even modify the answer in [[2017.11.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: My Luck]]? It's right on the money.

I can say that the past year and half has helped me not take smaller things for granted, and I feel like I continue to narrow down what really matters to me. While I can be unlucky in many respects, the sum total seems fairly good in many respects. I don't take that luck lightly, and I consider it to be a source of incredible moral obligations to [[The Others]] of the world. I think I barely hold onto my sanity, will to live, and [[hope]] itself. Yet, some of my luck keeps me afloat.

I continue to feel luckier and luckier in our homeschooling. The opportunity has required enormous sacrifice, but the payoff has been ridiculously awesome. I am less and less scared about my son's survival, and both continue to make huge progress. My offspring may not be perfectly prepared for the world, but I'm proud and lucky at the same time (which usually don't go together, but there is a split in what I'm responsible for here).

I've been really lucky to meet [[others]] online that want to have a real conversation. It's nearly impossible for me to have one offline of any depth, though [[T-Money]] has been a wonderful readdition to my life. I've certainly felt lonely, but I've also been touched by many in the desert. 

I feel lucky to have stumbled upon so many of the joys and interests in my life. It's not that I didn't attempt to create my own luck in some respects, but it's still luck snowballed.
