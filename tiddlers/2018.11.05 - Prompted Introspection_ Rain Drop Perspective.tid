title: 2018.11.05 - Prompted Introspection: Rain Drop Perspective

!! Pretend you are a raindrop falling to earth and describe your fall from the clouds.

I answer this question about a year ago, [[2017.12.02 - Prompted Introspection Log: I'm a Raindrop]], and I still remember it. I'm going to try another route.

AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! I'M FAAAALLLLINGGGGGGG!! Then I 'asplode.

I think OOO, hard-problem dualist panpsychism, and perhaps even panentheism may have something to say to this. It seems possible on this question that I, as a raindrop, was conscious of my formation. I think that's far more interesting than the fall. ''I'' cannot answer the identity problem.
