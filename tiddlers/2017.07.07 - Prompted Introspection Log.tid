!! How has your birth order/characteristics of siblings affected you?

I can't answer this effectively in a single log-post. Samwise, you're an idiot. That said, this is, of course, an important question to be able to answer for oneself. 

Many people consider this astrology, folklore psychology, etc. It is my opinion that academically rigorous psychologists have realized just how unscientific, unreliable, and poor their knowledge really is on the topic. They realize they can't back it up, and they remain extremely skeptical for good reasons. That said, I think sometimes we are forced by pragmatism to put our tentpegs down. Thus, with that caveat in mind, I will answer the question.

Being the oldest often means:

* Higher IQ
* Higher Testosterone
* Received the most single-child treatment (for a while at least). Being the first to do things also made it feel single-child-like in some minor respects throughout my upbringing.
* Guinea pig for biological donors
* Most similar to my biological donors of the siblings, higher conformity rates, etc.
* Getting stuck in the "Third parent" role at times
* Extremely high expectations and earlier maturation requirements
* Highly ambitious, disciplined, mastery-oriented, motivated, achiever, dominant, bossy, Type A, direct, etc.
* Received higher rates of abuse than siblings
* Most influenced and hurt by authority, and dependent upon approval

I think lots of birth order tropes and patterns are telling us something that is often accurate, even if they can't be academically scientifically verified. I realize one's gut instinct is no replacement for hard science. I see the phenomena in front of me though, and I don't have good explanations otherwise.
