Need to clean the house this weekend
FRI 1:46 PM
oh no =/
FRI 1:47 PM
:confused:
FRI 1:47 PM
Is it the flu, you think?
FRI 1:47 PM
Preach on the cleaning. Our living room and the kid's closet, those are my goals.
FRI 1:47 PM
I dunno yet —there has been a flu like virus going around
FRI 1:47 PM
:mask:
FRI 1:47 PM
lol
FRI 1:47 PM
It maybe nice enough to work in the yard outside but I may have to spend the weekend on the couch comforting our little dog . He hurt his back again
FRI 1:49 PM
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
FRI 1:49 PM
Poor little guy
FRI 1:49 PM
It would be a shame if I had to sit and work on my video game with him
FRI 1:50 PM
=)
FRI 1:50 PM
([[UJ]] and I may have to fight for this hard duty hehe)
FRI 1:50 PM
How are the kids? And the after school?
FRI 1:50 PM
lol, does he play that game too, btw?
FRI 1:50 PM
No he is playing red dead redemption 1 and 2
FRI 1:51 PM
Neat. I have never played.
FRI 1:52 PM
I think your choice sounds more fun to me ;P
FRI 1:52 PM
Everyone is healthy. My son is more productive sitting next to me all day. We drive each other crazy.
FRI 1:52 PM
Yeah focused time is good but hard
FRI 1:52 PM
Thank you for encouraging L to find a job she is happier with...I think any place would be overjoyed to have her
FRI 1:56 PM
[[j3d1h]] is working on [[Firmcoding]] for me in the wiki. [[1uxb0x]] is setting up a custom desktop environment in linux designed for controlling virtual desktops and windows through keyboards and automation (lots of things to configure). [[1uxb0x]] is working on Khan to solidify everything, and [[j3d1h]] is working on number theory (I'm at the point where I can't help the girl much). [[1uxb0x]] finished Dune but doesn't want to write about it, and [[j3d1h]] is crawling through The Chosen. Their humanities seem decent otherwise.
FRI 1:56 PM
It has turned my stomach inside and out. I am trying to be as careful as I can.
FRI 1:57 PM
I know she is tenaciously hanging on willing improvement but I hope she finds something she loves to do
FRI 1:57 PM
We that love her want the best for her
FRI 1:58 PM
:heart:
FRI 1:58 PM
Preach.
FRI 1:58 PM
She doesn’t see her value as great as I do —now granted I am very bias but I know she can do great things
FRI 1:59 PM
Aye. I am in agreement. I aim to help her escape a trap and do what she enjoys. I know it seems like a mountain to climb, and she doubts whether or not she can.
FRI 2:00 PM
I've begged her to head into chemical engineering for a long time. I will continue to do so. She has developed lots of valuable softskills to boot, and that will mean a lot.
FRI 2:01 PM
There is a huge difference between how she spoke of working her last engineering internship and this job.
FRI 2:01 PM
I have no doubts that she will do great. I keep throwing job offers at her and even offered her use of my car if needed —I am probably too pushy
FRI 2:02 PM
Yeah —they still want her up there at her first internship. They tried pretty hard to get her in for an interview when she graduated with her MBA. Now granted, I really wouldn’t want to have her that far but I know there are opportunities close
FRI 2:03 PM
My problem with her current position is a moral one. I think switching is a change to hit two birds with one stone.
FRI 2:04 PM
chance*
FRI 2:04 PM
Yes I can understand that —read it too
FRI 2:05 PM
I appreciate how you love her :blush:
FRI 2:05 PM
She's my sister. =)
FRI 2:05 PM
Yes she is
FRI 2:06 PM
[[AG]] is gearing up for her formal coming up next month
FRI 2:06 PM
Neat. Is she excited?
FRI 2:06 PM
We ordered her a dress :dress: and made arrangements for hair and makeup (neither are my forte)
FRI 2:07 PM
Yes very excited
FRI 2:07 PM
She is going with a guy that has been her best friend since kindergarten
FRI 2:07 PM
The math genius, yeah?
FRI 2:08 PM
Yes
FRI 2:08 PM
Awesome.
FRI 2:08 PM
Happy for her —hoping they have a great night
FRI 2:08 PM
Rock on. When is it?
FRI 2:10 PM

FRI 2:11 PM
Oh, I forgot to answer one question: afterschool is going well. I'm able to help kids, and that has been a valuable use of my time. I'm still learning to model the environment and process. I can see I don't belong, but that's okay.
