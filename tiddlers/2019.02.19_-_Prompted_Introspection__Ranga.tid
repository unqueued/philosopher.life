!! Do you have pets? Tell a story about one of them.

I do. My cats, Chairman Meow and Ranganathan, are my only pets. I try to write about them here: [[Kitty Kat Korner]]. 

Ranga is fascinating to me. I think he is a worldly cat, and he sometimes feels like an outsider in our house. It really all started with my life wanting to walk him on a leash in New Orleans. The leash never stuck, but she planted the seed for him to want to go outside. Eventually, he became an 80% outdoor, 20% indoor cat. It has been difficult to accept all the consequences of having cats, especially a cat like this one.

Ranga has clearly experienced significant violence at the hands of dogs. He doesn't seem to like any species besides humans. He's extremely friendly with humans. He is used to being petted and getting food from people around the neighborhood.
