title: 2018.09.22 - Prompted Introspection: Dream Concert

!! Imagine you are attending your dream concert?what songs would you want to be played? What does the stage look like?

See: [[Music: Library]]. Love to see the best performers (or originals composers) of the classics. Go top to bottom. I don't care what the stage looks like, or if I could have anything, it would be a solution to the crisis our world is experiencing. 

I think the Metalocalypse intro "stage drop" is funny, minus the murders. A pitch black or pure white room would be great. I want to skullfucked and cry. So, lube and tissues, please. LSD would probably be nice.
