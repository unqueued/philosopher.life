title: 2019.03.02 - Prompted Introspection: Mrs. Cox

!! Tell about a neighbor you had a hard time living next to. 

Ah, my memory fades in and out. Where I grew up, about 10% of the population was a clan who sported the lastname "Cox" (or so it felt). Beware the country mafia, bless your heart. They were the primary druglords, farmers, and politicians of the area. Some kids starved, most eked it out, but a select few came from families who owned mansions, all the land, 4-wheelers, businesses of the town, vacations, horses, ostriches, lakes, and nepotistic social networks. To say wealth and the means of production were centralized even in the microcosms of the middle of nowhere is an understatement.

I lived next to Mrs. Cox. No, not my 4th Grade Teacher, Mrs. Cox, who fawned over her prodigy, whose sons owned old Ferraris and new computers, and who eventually had a mental breakdown (that was a weird year), though these women were related. No, not my false-virtue-signaling Sunday School teacher, Carol Mae Cox,<<ref "c">> who worked at the courthouse<<ref "f">> and would get charges dismissed for people (or more), but these women were mother and daughter. No, not the Mrs. Cox of the cabinet-making-factory in the civilized city 20 minutes away from us who singlehandedly paid for the existence of the primary church on the Mannsville Methodist charge those many years ago when there was still a circuit,<<ref "t">> but these women were related.<<ref "m">> No, I'm talking about The Mrs. Cox to you, thank you very much.

IIRC, she was the grouchiest and perhaps one of the most powerful women I have ever met in my life. I have met many matrons and patrons. She was Queenpin in the Cox family. Oh, Mrs. Tibbs, Saint Laura, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Mozel, you were more decent and humane than this woman who had everything and nothing.<<ref "r">> She was insanely evil. I never saw a sparkle of righteousness in the woman, not an ounce of generosity, not a bit of kindness, not a whiff of [[love]] from this woman to or for anyone else. Ah, but we respected our elders at all costs. We would visit her sometimes. She was responsible, in no small part, for what that community had become, what her children and their children became, and so on. It's amazing to see how her house was so small, her geographic legacy next to the parsonage and across from the elementary school, and behind us a field for horses with the creek behind it: when her vampiric power structures were not to be trifled with. Madame Flannery O'Connor knew what it do.

At least she let me beat the dead cornstalks in her garden with tobacco sticks. We lived //The War//, אלייג'ה ווד.

<<footnotes "m" "Don't get me wrong, the men were just as evil. They were violent, they were corrupt, they stuffed ballots, they would be cast out into the slums if they did not become slavemasters.">>
