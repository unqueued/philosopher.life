title: The Problem of Undeserved Grace from God

Everything God does is morally right. God would always do exactly as He did in a circumstance and nothing else. Essentially, there is no such thing as permissibility and option for God. God is morally obliged to do what He does. What He does is right by definition. He is unchanging and unwavering in this respect. 

These claims are not difficult to swallow for the orthodox Christian. 

Further, salvation is thought of as a gift. God offers it to us out of mercy. We think of it as undeserved grace. But, I think the above claims contradict such thinking. 

God’s offering of grace is obliged. He has a duty to offer it. Duties have corresponding rights. Thus, we have a right to that grace, assuming we meet the conditions to acquire it (however one acquires salvation and justification). So, assuming one meets those salvific requirements, God, in his moral splendor, is morally obligated to save you. It isn’t undeserved mercy and grace, but rather it is required by the moral law, and by the very nature of God, that He save you in such a case.
