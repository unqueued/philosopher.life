My brother talked about a very long evening at the training. We talked about the morality and legality of restraining, the differences in authorities he faces, and the considerations of the infants that make this less likely to be a worry at all.

My brother talked to me about calling [[AIR]] who dismissed him quickly. =( It's probably the ol' yeller clause. Apparently, he offered to go with [[AIR]] to see our donors. I explained that was clearly what [[JRE]] wanted for himself, but that wasn't what [[AIR]] would want to do (at least to my knowledge). My brother had a decent time with our donors. Good! Gotta say, I think my brother is going to attempt to cross those lines with me again; he's going to have to wrestle much harder next time with me if he does. I do see the possibility of middleman triangulation, deception, confabulatory peacekeeper, and unjustified approval-seeking in him.

We talked about his job, about a buttdial voice he left me, and a discussion he had with a flatearther. He spent social capital kindly yet again in a group setting.

My brother has been feeling a bit neurotic. He woke up crying deeply after a dream about our donors before seeing them. 

We talked about GPT2 and [[AIoutopIA]] as he got high, lol. I'm afraid I've done just a shit job of explaining myself. He had no idea that I've been talking about this for quite a while (I think it's clear he hasn't been listening or reading too carefully either). I am bad at explaining. My brother is so kind in not calling what I have to say bullshit, lol.
