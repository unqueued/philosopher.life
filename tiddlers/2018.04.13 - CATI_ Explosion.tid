The claim that we can't have knowledge beyond what it appears to us, we'll never get to the thing in itself, etc. Transcendental epistemology is concerned with how the human mind structures things. Analytics did this with language, and Continental philosophers with phenomenology. We've been prohibited from doing metaphysics. 

Two reasons we can't "get at the world":

* Berkeley's Argument
** Do you think possibility entails conceivability? Further, if you don't think something is conceivable, why should you believe it's true?
** Thus, he argues for empirical idealism.

* Correlationism
*# We can't have knowledge or coherently talk about a world external to human minds
*# Kant's view shows that we get into contradictions
*#* Finite and Infinite space don't make sense...
*#* We can only talk about what we can conceive of; can't have knowledge of a world independent of what our mind brings to interpreting our world, the noumena, etc. We can never get to infinity.

Harman is a philosopher of finitude solves this by denying the Correlationism but agreeing to Berkeley's argument. Tristan Garcia (what Cogburn translated/wrote on) denies both.

Mystics often say they can't put it into words. This is in every religion. Perhaps that's an important sign about the nature of language, knowledge, and conscious experience. They are piecing together pictures of a hyperobject. 

Green orb "is being and becoming." It is totality that we are separate from. You're separate from the totality are you part of. It transcends you, but you can't transcend it. 

Hegel thought it was the end of history that justifies/righteouses the totality paradox. Sounds wrong to me too.

Are we stuck in this Kantian prison? 

Somehow, I cannot buy the unified world-spirit, pantheistic, universal organism, or Spinozistic model (because I believe in contingent truths).

Temperature Reliabilist Thought Experiment: he can reliably tell the ambient temperature, but he doesn't really know the temperature. This is externalism. He's justified, but he doesn't grasp the meaning of what he is saying. He doesn't have the belief (not a complete enough one at least, on my view). 

# Eternity in every moment.
# Divinity in every particle.
# Unending path

The eternal dao cannot be spoken. 

True contradictions require coping. 

What it is to be an object is to resist undermining and overmining. Enclosure paradox, like Russell's paradox. Being outside totality that you are a part of.

I'm so out of my league right now.

Hrmm.  

The fact that logical positivists could not verify the claim that "all and only propositions verifiable through empirical observation are cognitively meaningful" is another variant of the problem that Godel is absolutely smashing. I suggest that "observeable" is another way of saying can be communicated in language to our mind through sense-organs, but Godel has already explained the problem of language here. I suggest that Wittgenstein has also done this.

Fuck me. I have to go to bed. =( - I'd stay up till 5am, but that is not healthy for me. I cannot afford to be manic about this, even though I'm finally seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.
