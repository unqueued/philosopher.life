I can't type or cube. They feel foreign. The gliding of keys and cubelets isn't natural in this state. That or they aren't who I am. Spurts of my abilities come out at unexpected times. This is dissociated me. This is part of shaping myself? Who is doing the shaping? What an unanswerable question! Ofc, it's me. Cold insanity required for change. This is the Potter's Hand. It is messy work.
