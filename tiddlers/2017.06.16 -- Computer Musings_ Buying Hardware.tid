title: 2017.06.16 -- Computer Musings: Buying Hardware

This article bugged me:

* http://www.pcworld.com/article/3200767/gaming/xbox-one-x-pc-build.html

Of course, a female wrote it. I don't know what to tell you. Perhaps systematic sexism and cultural bias has generated a self-fulfilling prophesy. I think they were paid to say this bullshit. The claim is that you will struggle to build hardware even comparable to "loss-leader" hardware you'd find on an Xbox One. Let me dispell this bullshit for you right now. They have a mixture of ad-paid bias marketing manipulation and incompetence here. I smell Apple fanboi mixed with Consoletard. Disgusting.

She gave two builds. I'm going to wreck them both.

I built to her first build's initial specs (which far outstrip what an APU is going to hand you).

I can do it for $200 less than her stupid pricing, and I get better parts too! 

This has 1TB more storage and my video card is significantly better than her choice. I threw in a wireless card to be cute, since she complained about it. Obviously, anyone who gives a shit will be wired, no if's-and's-or-but's about it. 

I do not include an optical drive, and that's because I'm not an idiot. The best way to watch media or play games hasn't been through optical media in over a decade! I keep my optical drive in my primary machine only as a legacy device, just like I kept a 3.5" floppy drive until 2012. Seriously, I care about legacy. But, I'm not retarded; I don't use the thing but maybe once or twice in the lifetime of a computer. I'm going external next time.

Note, I am below the $500 pricepoint. Let me grant, this system runs hot, but will be perfectly stable. Also, don't buy Windows, idiot. 

The better-than-xbone-1 for $500 or less myth is debunked. Still crushing it.

Alright, onto the second "upgraded" build, which is $818.

My initial thought: they chose the terribly priced i5-7400 with Passmark score 7443 for $180. For $10 more you can buy the i5-7500 at 7981. Why the move from AMD to Intel here? An AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core at 8942 is $80 cheaper than her choice. Don't get me wrong, the reason to choose Intel is single-threading. It's the king.  If multi-threading was really what mattered, stick to AMD.

Vitally, I still don't see games that are significantly multi-threaded. If you really just care about gaming, there is no difference between between 2 cores and 32 cores. It's really hard to write code that will actually make use of more cores. The author chose a dumb compromise. If you care about single-threaded and you want series multi-threaded performance, then buy a better CPU, else choose for price efficiency in single-threaded.

Until I find the i5 variant, these are two correct possible roads to take:

* $329 -- Intel Core i7-7700K @ 4.20GHz at 12178
* $150 -- Intel Core i3-7350K @ 4.20GHz at 6925

Let's be clear, her choice only has 75% of the single-threaded performance of either of my chips. I can pay $30 less and still completely wreck her chip in single-threaded performance (what matters; this was the reason to go Intel instead of AMD), or I can pay $150 more and buy a chip that not only has a heft single-threaded advantage but can also fucking destroy in the multi-threaded department.

For the AMD fanbois (and I do prefer competition!), the AMD Ryzen 7 1700X is at the same pricepoint as the i7, and it does 14865, but the single-threading is still worse than all of the chips we are considering here. It's really bad when a $150 chip wrecks your +$300 chip in the most important performance metric for non-parallel tasks (and most parallel tasks should be handled by your GPU).

Alright, I've gone over her arbitrary budget by $37, or 5% of her cost more, because this was the correct price point. Obviously, we can crush her performance at the $818 price point, but this is where raw price-efficiency should actually take us. 

Let's be clear, for $37 more, we pickup:

* a fucking SSD, which everyone post 2010 should be using in their machine. 
** Even for a gaming machine, you'd be retarded not to get one. In fact, for the previous rig, I'd take a 120GB SSD instead of a 1TB HDD and just live within my space means.
* a significantly stronger single-threaded CPU which remains quite competitive in multi-threaded performance against most consumer chips
* 16 GB of RAM, not 8GB. Again, welcome to the 2010's.
** I've had Chrome break 8GB of memory usage (with standard extensions). 
* A GPU which destroys, jumping from 7957 passmark to 11015.
** The heart-and-soul of a gaming rig. Dump your money into it.

Note, it would be easier to go Z270, and I have forgotten a cooler. I have a bunch laying around. Throw $7 extra if you need one. 

I'll tell you this isn't the machine I would buy for myself. I would jump for the i7, and at this point, I'd jump for 32GB of RAM too. But, I don't need that much GPU either. When I do, I'd rent it (but I'm not actually rendering games on my screen at that point).
