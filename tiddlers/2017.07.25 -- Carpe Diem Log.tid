title: 2017.07.25 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up before the alarm. I got some good sleep, but I was still somewhat sleepy.
* I tried pushing bricks out, but didn't have much success.
** Some is better than none.
* I worked hard.
** I feel like I got my bearings somewhat at my new jobsite.
* I talked to Tim at lunch. 
** I had Bojangles for lunch. I just needed a place with AC. The problem is everything is way out of the way.
** Perhaps a new job in 2 weeks. We will see. I am wondering what I should do about rent. It really depends.
* I took my THC piss test. Failed, as expected. Good to know.
* I tried calling JRE. No dice.
** I hope I'm not annoying him. I always talk about work with him. Maybe I need to talk about something else. Right now, that's the subject that is ruling my life and that I'm having to digest. 
* I talked to Armstrong about lots of things.
** He's an idiot.
** He's incredibly selfish and non-reflective (although, he considers himself quite reflective).
** He had no reasonable answers to my questions. =(
** I'm convinced he doesn't know much about investing and almost nothing about politics.
*** His world is very shallow. =(
* I showered. I love showering after work.
* I talked to my wife. =) It was wonderful to hear her voice and see her tits.
* Fireman Time!
** My wife constantly arouses me. I can't help it. She's a tease that has too many bad Southern Bell Christian habits to be sufficiently naughty for me. It happens with almost all of our conversations (even when she's wrong about some Television show).
* I ate some food, surfed, etc.
* I talked to my children.
** I really hope they finish their work tonight.
* I talked to my wife again.
** She does not interpret Mr. Robot correctly, imho.
* Surfed and wrote.
* Pushed out serious bricks. Woot!
* I gave more thought to buying phones. I want to wait yet another week.
* I've been very itchy today. 
** Although, I find the itchiness incredibly arousing at times too. This is weird. My soft blanket over my itchy spots heightens the stimulation, no doubt.

* Maybe a bit of surfing and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia to fall asleep.
