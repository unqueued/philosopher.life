title: 2018.01.10 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Hobby

!! Tell what you like about one of your hobbies.

Hobbies are weird. They come and go for me. I sometimes pick them back up, but I often don't. I wouldn't say I get bored of them, but I would say that there are simply other things which are more interesting or useful. That isn't to say I outgrow them either. I look on them fondly. Do I still have the right to call them my hobby if I don't engage in them often? I don't know. How does one draw that line? Are you asking me about something I do often, and how often?

Magic the Gathering is a classic hobby of mine. I was pretty damn good at the game. I was a mod at [[http://mtgthesource.com]]. I've won decent money at it (had to file taxes for it). I worry, of course, that it wasn't a worthy investment of my time. I wish I had been more productive in some ways. I wish I built things that mattered more. I hope to steer my children towards drugs that do things.
