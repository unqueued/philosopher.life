What are you up to today?
JUN 13 10:06 AM
Good! I'm glad you are feeling better.
JUN 13 10:07 AM
Discussing scientific method, empiricism, writing our bot scripts for Clicker Heroes in iterations, and trying to use it as a metaphor for other things.
JUN 13 10:08 AM
Gonna keep applying to more jobs.
JUN 13 10:08 AM
Doing some work around the house.
JUN 13 10:08 AM
I have a book that is due back in 2 weeks, and I need to finish it.
JUN 13 10:08 AM
My 50-page letter to kickscondor is nearly complete, and I'd like to keep pushing in that.
JUN 13 10:08 AM
That’s not a letter. It’s a dissertation.
JUN 13 10:09 AM
There's a decentralized tool call "Dat" that I'm going to think about and explore more. I'm considering using a VM that will allow you to simulate thousands of computers at once to see how this tool scales (since, to my knowledge, no one has built this).

JUN 13 10:09 AM
Ooooo that’s cool sounding!
JUN 13 10:10 AM
My friend T-Money has been writing letters to me as well. It's an expensive task, and it's not one that I find many people engage in these days. It adds up though.
JUN 13 10:11 AM
I've already written a book to kickscondor, basically. There are very long letters I've written to him.
JUN 13 10:11 AM
I will probably only to get some of my list, and that's okay.
JUN 13 10:14 AM
Any, how about you, what are you doing and thinking about today?
JUN 13 10:14 AM
Work, finishing Saturday’s session, and raiding tonight I think.
JUN 13 10:17 AM
Today is Thursday!
JUN 13 10:18 AM
I'd be interested to see the relationship between your planning (the input) and the notes (the output). I assume the planning is an expensive.
JUN 13 10:19 AM

JUN 13 10:19 AM
Ill do a separate notes doc this time so we can compare.
JUN 13 10:31 AM
I’ve been meaning to do so for the longest time. Not sure why I haven’t done it yet.
