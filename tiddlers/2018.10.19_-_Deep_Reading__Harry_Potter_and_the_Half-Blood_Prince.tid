title: 2018.10.19 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I wish we found out Voldemort's experience of HP's thoughts/feelings through their connection before this book.

I don't understand how or why Dumbledore makes his teacher selections. He is socially adept, no doubt. Smooth AF.

Is this the best book of them all? Maybe. Dumbledore and Snape are so important to me.

Again, magic should be way sexier. Hermione would find me pathetic. =)

The teenagers really do care about defeating evil. I don't think these people are real for the most part.

The DADA score for Hermione makes no sense.

Think Rowling's gives lots of entrepreneurial hope to kids. Fuck that.

Why doesn't everyone wear shield stuff permanently, long before this? These gizmos would have existed all along, be commonplace, etc.

It is clear to me that the power dynamics of this world make no sense whatsoever.
