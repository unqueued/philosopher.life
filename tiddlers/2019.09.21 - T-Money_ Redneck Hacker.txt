Cute as a button
SEP 21 8:08 PM
Thanks. I'm always excited. We tend to be one of the largest campers during vintage weekend. By no means the nicest.
SEP 21 8:27 PM
Most people actually bought their camper to restore.
SEP 21 8:27 PM
I always appreciate your "Fix Her Up New" restoration point of view.
SEP 21 8:28 PM
I bought an old camper and found out it needed alot of work... Years later here we are. Happened by happenstance. I was just trying to get Kathy out of a tent.
SEP 21 8:28 PM
I appriciate potential! Always.
SEP 21 8:29 PM
Also. I am curious as to what you deem my fix her up new view is.
SEP 21 8:34 PM
Oh, no idea what to call, that was just a term.
SEP 21 8:35 PM
Not for arguments sake, just to understand.
SEP 21 8:35 PM
You try not to waste things. You try to build DIY. You see potential, and you actualize it where others wouldn't. I like that you go for redneck hacks (though, they are hardly unsophisticated).
SEP 21 8:36 PM
I take that as a badge of honor. I often feel very satisfied with some of my meager accomplishments. Sometimes due to the simplicity or using what I had laying around and making it happen.
SEP 21 8:37 PM
I build stuff from dog houses to whole barns alot by winging it and moving on the fly. So you are very on point. And yupp, that is my attitude.
SEP 21 8:38 PM
My 12volt sprayer is a redneck hack using the old water pump from the freshwater tank on my camper, an old backpack pump sprayer, and  some fittings from the  Lowes.
SEP 21 8:39 PM
And a 5 gallon water tank for at home water cooler.
SEP 21 8:40 PM
I think I made a video of it. Very proud of that one.
