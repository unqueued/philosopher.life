title: Cryptocurrency Casino

The goal is to build a scaling casino in which you can gamble in any cryptocurrency. New currencies come and go, and we should make it easy to accept them.

Gambling in cryptocurrency seems like a worthy enterprise. I can only see it getting bigger. Regulations would be low or impossible. Access could be difficult, but theoretically high. I believe the online casino business is going to be huge, and it is going to be extremely cutthroat. For all I know, it already is. I think it is still in its infancy though (if only because cryptocurrency is still young). In many ways, other kinds of games, even mainstream games, have gambling already embedded in them; they don't use cryptocurrency though. They are subject to sovereigns that we an avoid if we plan correctly. They will not be without problems though.

Casinos are going to torpedo each other, DDOS, attack, etc. Security will be very difficult in some respects, and yet, there are many tricks. One of the goals of any casino will be to completely isolate the actual payment processor from the client/UI which is accessed by a gambler. In a way, we want the client to be spammable, benign, useless to attack, easy to setup, and powerless to influence us. The actual payment processor, where the random rolls happen and where we send and receive money, needs to be deeply hidden. Layers of darknet would be useful here because anonymity is key. There are a ton of Opsec problems too.

Getting people to use the casino has tons of problems. There is likely a significant psychological element to getting the right rewards payoffs, flashing delights on the screen, etc. One worry is that instant gratification is key, and that damns my plan entirely. If so, then gambling will require them buying digital "chips" (our own currency) to bet with. They could then "cash out" whenever they wanted to. That lacks trust, I think, but it may be very profitable for some.

Further, we should just keep all transactions for each currency on a ledger. We can show each bet, the ID of the transaction, with win or loss. If they win, we send the twice the money back to that wallet. If they lose, we keep the money. This ledger shows up in the client UI. It's a way to demonstrate the fairness of the casino, to show transactions in real time, etc.

There are many kinds of betting patterns. Let's stick with a classic one. Casinos which appear to be "provably" fair (49.5/50.5, or something like it), will be trusted. The goal is to create a casino that appears to give you 49.5/50.5 odds of winning any bet, but to be far more unfair than that at the right times to maximize profit. The odds of winning and losing need to scale with the ratio of the size of bet given the total amount of money the casino holds. As a bet approaches the total, the odds of them winning must decrease exponentially. Essentially, small bets should win more often than big bets, the smaller the bet the more likely it is to win, and the bigger the bet the more likely it is to lose. Importantly, it needs to be hard to see it in the numbers. People could analyze the ledger and try to spot patterns. We need to make it difficult to see. 

Consider an instance of betting. Say the bet amount is B, and the total funds available to the casino is T. If B >= T, then they automatically lose. We can't or won't pay it. They lose on the spot, and we have at least doubled T. 

Importantly, the odds of winning need to continually shift to try to align the W/L ratio to 49.5/50.5. If the current W/L ratio is 49.5/50.5, then our unfair curve is normal. But, if the W/L is 45/55, then we need to change our unfair curve to be far more fair. In fact, for low end bets, it should be quite favorable. A minimum bet might, for example, have 75/25 odds to win! We would literally be paying our minimum betters for the opportunity to normalize the W/L ratio. It's vital that we push up that 45/55 winloss ratio towards 49.5/50.5 in order to appear fair. Honestly, the curve only needs to be normalized in one direction. I don't see us having a problem in the other direction ever.
