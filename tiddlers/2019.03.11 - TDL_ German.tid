title: 2019.03.11 - TDL: German

* I should consider writing these at the end of the night.
* Read+Write (shocker :P)
* [[k0sh3k]] might have moved to Wednesday, so maybe not pizza. Lots to eat though.
* [[j3d1h]] wants to do some German. Cool.
** I'll burn 30 minutes of CS, and the rest comes out of humanities. My time is spent on memorizing 1000 highest frequency words or roots (digital flash card it) and then pure mechanics/syntax. You should be adept at translating with tools. Show me tooling, please. My goal is for you to develop the ability to merely read German on my time. You have proof, or this doesn't happen. Recall, German is difficult to learn, easy to master; it won't be easy to get over the hump.
* Work
* Still not doing m16 or muh letters. Alrighty.
