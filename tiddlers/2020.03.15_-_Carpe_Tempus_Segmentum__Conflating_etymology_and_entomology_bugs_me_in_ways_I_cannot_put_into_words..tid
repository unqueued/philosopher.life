title: 2020.03.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Conflating etymology and entomology bugs me in ways I cannot put into words.

* Woke at 10
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Talked with [[BCS]]
** Two hours. Longer than I predicted, and I'm grateful he would take the time.
** Introductions and explanations from where we are coming from.
** My goal is to read and speak up with him, asymmetrically here. 
** Asked if I wanted to syndicate. I don't think I'd be useful enough to him there.
** Thankfully, was not bothered by my thorny argumentation style. Good.
** Walking through his work with a finer-toothed comb.
* Read+Write
* [[Family Time]]!
** Planning
** Accountability
** CV19
** The first half was crazy rough.
** Life got much easier with dinner.
*** Chops, asparagus, potatoes and gravy, zucchini, apples
*** Dinner was delightful. We are renewed people at the table so far. If [[m16]] wasn't my ball and chain, the tabled area would be my favorite. 
*** Epic MWC v MUC match. My son finally sealed the deal with triple capsize recursion, could never get a final swing. Excellent game.
** No one-on-ones, no walk. =/
*** Just not enough time in the day.
** Joyful reading through our wikis.
* My wife had work today from home trying to plan...
** She's the only librarian in her library considered critical. Lol. Of course. 
*** Lemonade time: it's an opportunity to generate equal-footing as a noob.
* Walk and talk with myself
* Never did get to VC with [[gh057]]. =/
* Called [[AIR]]
* Read+Write
