Hey [[L]]! =)
WED 2:02 PM
How's your day going?
WED 2:02 PM
Not too shabby! Wednesdays are usually when the work week calms down so I’m trying to get all my stuff done now. And outside of work, Thursdays are my guild’s raid night so I’m pretty excited about that.
WED 2:12 PM
That sounds delightful. I'm glad the middle of the week is a bit easier on you too.
WED 2:13 PM
It’s always good to have things to look forward to. Makes the days go a little easier.
WED 2:25 PM
No doubt. The grind has a set prize at the end of the tunnel.
WED 2:26 PM
How’s your day? What did you end up drunkenly posting about?
WED 2:26 PM
Didn't get much down.
WED 2:27 PM
Ended up falling asleep, lol.
WED 2:27 PM
My day is good. Heading to work right now.
WED 2:28 PM
Kids are taking practice ACT tests today because I'm curious.
WED 2:28 PM
Poor things. Testing sucks.
WED 2:28 PM
Had some interesting conversations with folks online.
WED 2:29 PM
Oof. Yeah, standardized testing is a beast of its own. Being good at it, or at least calm during it, is important.
WED 2:29 PM
Someone said my wiki made them feel bad after looking at it for a bit. So, I'm striking up a conversation with them.
WED 2:29 PM
They have never taken a test before, so this is good practice.
WED 2:30 PM
Oooohhhhh
WED 2:30 PM
I feel like the phrase “feel bad” has a weird connotation. Did they mean guilty, self-conscious, or what?
WED 2:31 PM
No idea
WED 2:55 PM
The person thanked me for it though. So, it can't be that bad.
