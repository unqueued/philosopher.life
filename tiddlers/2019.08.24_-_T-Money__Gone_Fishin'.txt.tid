So I went jug fishing when I was a kid with my best friends dad and my friend a few times when I was a kid.
AUG 24 11:30 PM
I remember it cause we caught 10 and 20lbs catfish like nothing. It was crazy. So the guy who I bought the bought from had like 20 homemade jugs with pvc and pool noodles and reflective tape. Done well. He gave them to me.
AUG 24 11:31 PM
So Thursday I ran jugs by myself.
AUG 24 11:32 PM
Yesturday we sat them late and got them late this morning. This evening we set in daylight let soak for about 2 hours and then got them back. Lots to learn. But lots of fun.
AUG 24 11:33 PM
Sounds like a blast. =)

The cat fish was good. The other fish we couldn't figure out what was it was. Some hybrid.
AUG 25 12:02 PM
Left it in bucket of water too long and it died, and got left even longer. So we ended up being safe and eating the fresh caught catfish instead.
AUG 25 12:02 PM
The catfish was wrapped up in the trees/reeds. And then wrapped around a log. I had to pull the log up and unwrap it. Was unsure if we had anything.
AUG 25 12:04 PM
The little fish ate all the bait but only caught two fish. Got to see maybe a half dozen big snapping turtles come up for air and see a huge gar fish swimming.
AUG 25 12:05 PM
At night!

Sounds tribal, one with nature, Romantic
AUG 25 12:05 PM

AUG 25 12:05 PM
We're good. Grinding away.
AUG 25 12:05 PM
I try to grind on the weekday. And it lay on the weekends. Do You think you grind to much? Joking.

Play*
AUG 25 12:07 PM
We get playtime, no doubt.
AUG 25 12:08 PM
Though I aim for even our playtime to often be useful to us
AUG 25 12:09 PM
I try to use any moment I can to teach my wife or my daughter. Even some of the most trivial things can be helpful.
AUG 25 12:10 PM
I sucked up every bit of knowledge I could find as a kid related to sustainable living, survivalist. Stuff like that. Lots of boy scout stuff.
AUG 25 12:11 PM
You wp ld be amazed. Only boy scouts and sailors know their knots.
AUG 25 12:11 PM
Maybe a few rock climbers.
AUG 25 12:11 PM
I saw it often in the trades, particularly the older folks and those who did a lot of critical lifts.
AUG 25 12:13 PM
Indeed! Rigging is crucial in how you position the load and straps, ropes, cables and chains.
