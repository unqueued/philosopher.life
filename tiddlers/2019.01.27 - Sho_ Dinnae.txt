dinnae takeit personally, dude. more laziness than anything!
8 HR AGO
ha, it's fine! I hear ya.

sometimes i am in the mood for the deep thoughtful philosophical intellectual curiosity stuff. sometimes i'm really just not lol
8 HR AGO
as far as i understand this daseinic thing, from what you've said, it's interesting
8 HR AGO
in that sense, aye, i think the cat is a person
8 HR AGO
but on that basis i think a lot of things are 'persons'
8 HR AGO
including possibly/likely plants, at least on some level, even if in a way so alien  to us we cannae detect/conceive of it
8 HR AGO
Aye. That's the hard problem of consciousness and maybe even Object-Oriented Ontology. I have no answers, lol.
8 HR AGO
upon reflection, it would be disturbing if you thought you did :joy:
8 HR AGO
Well, I think it's our job to uncover the most plausible answers we can. There is a difference between putting our tentpegs down and believing with a sense of certainty we are correct.
8 HR AGO
Both are commitments.
8 HR AGO
oh for sure, i would never suggest not theorising/hypothesising ;)
8 HR AGO
in fact, i seem to have quite a low opinion of humans who dinnae hahaha
8 HR AGO
c'est la vie!
8 HR AGO
peace =)
8 HR AGO
?

I mean, it's kind of war in life to put out tent pegs down. Hard to be peaceful in the dialectic. I also hold a low opinion of humans who don't wrestle for the sake of not having to wrestle.
8 HR AGO
I'm mostly annoyed by the sheer numbers who appear to not realise there is even a wrestling match going ON in the FIRST PLACE
8 HR AGO
but, aye, i get ya ;)
8 HR AGO
that said ... tent pegs, war ... continued existence necessitates the death of other beings/life. so in a way, to subsist is war.
8 HR AGO
no  matter how much we want to  be peaceful and nonviolent
8 HR AGO
btw, my dinner is about ready so i will be back sometime lol bye! hugs to [[k0sh3k]]!! :)
8 HR AGO
