hardware question!

yesterday i spilled coffee on my laptop :( :( :( :(

We reacted in flash time and got it tipped/drained/dried as best we could do. THANKFULLY all seems to be well - except my Enter/Return key, the main one.

It just has nae response.

Thankfully I've got a number pad to the right which has another one, so it's just an extra stretch to get to which I imagine I'll get used to in time anyway (mind I type for a living!)

but i was wondering whether there's anything i might be able to do, simple, to fix the Enter key.

Like, should I pry it off (gently, when computer off) and get in aboot with a cotton bud and some alcohol? for instance? might that help?

Or would you advise me just to leave it and adapt? Thoughts, please, and thank you!!

If it doesn't work, no harm in trying to take it off. You might want to look up the model to see if there's a special trick to it (depends on the keyboard). My bet is that it can't be fixed. You can also buy a replacement keyboard altogether.

I would attempt to replace it rather than live with it. I also type a fuckton, and I could not imagine living without my "enter" key.
Mar 11 11:38am
I'm sorry about the spill =(
Mar 11 11:38am
It's built in to the laptop...
Mar 11 12:22pm
Yup.
Mar 11 12:23pm
You can look up how to take it apart to replace the keyboard.
Mar 11 12:23pm
Oh JESUS
Mar 11 12:36pm
Yeah. =(. Sometimes the key will naturally fix it itself with drying. Has that happened?
Mar 13 1:15pm
No ðŸ˜• and I found a few others dinnae work, nothing critical but....
