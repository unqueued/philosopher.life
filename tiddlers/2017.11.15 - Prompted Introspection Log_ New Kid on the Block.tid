title: 2017.11.15 - Prompted Introspection Log: New Kid on the Block

!! How would you feel if a new child moved into your neighbourhood?

Generally, I wouldn't give a shit. We live in an apartment complex. People are always moving in and out. I would probably care more when I saw multiple kids moving in, as I find demographic shifts interesting. If there was nothing special about just a single kid moving in, I don't see why I should care.

Of course, I would hope that they would make a good playmate for my children. In particular, I think my daughter needs to find peers, but that's really fucking hard to do. Regardless of fault, I am a poor rolemodel for my daughter in this respect.
