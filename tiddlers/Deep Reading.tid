title: Deep Reading

!! About:

//Hell or heaven, dive in. Take the risk, pay the price, and experience the truth. Don't be a lazy fucking idiot. Never deny yourself the opportunity to read sources deeply. How many times must you learn this lesson?//

<<<
To read without reflecting is like eating without digesting.

-- Edmund Burke 
<<<

Here I document my progress in deepreading sources of any kind. I generally deepread books, but there are some hypertext rabbitholes which merit the same [[dok]] of charity and extensive scrutiny.

My illiteracies are source of shame. I have to take a breath and remind myself that my primary schools were among the poorest of the second to last ranked state.<<ref "t">> I learned alongside the truly poor in what are essentially the third world boonies. I have done well for myself with what I had, especially as an autist. I have made progress before, and I [[hope]] to do it again.

Do what you can, homie. Enjoy what you can. Maybe you can't fix your stupidity, but you gotta try. You may never be well-read, but that doesn't matter. Spend the rest of your life earning your own approval in this practice. Like all humans, you deserve to be a literate man. Seize it! Throw yourself into the depths of Humanity.

!! Principles:

* This is an annual log.
* Curate source to your context.
* Read with your family.
* ~~Pix~~ Write or it didn't happen.
* Destroy the sunk cost fallacy
** Put down your reading sources if they aren't worth reading.
** Be aggressive but not lazy or confabulatory.
* Scale your investigations and digestions appropriately.
* Wear your Straussian, Montaignian, and other hermeneutical+motivational hats where appropriate.
