!! About:

//Hell or heaven, dive in. Take the risk, pay the price, and experience these virtual worlds. Don't give in to being a lazy fucking hedonic idiot, and be honest about the fact that you don't want to try. Suffering builds character. It won't hurt to be in pain for a while, right? Never deny yourself the opportunity to read sources deeply. How many times must you learn this lesson? It's a damned shame, I tell ye'hwhat. Do your best, sir.//

<<<
To read without reflecting is like eating without digesting.

-- Edmund Burke

We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.

-- Robin Sharma, //The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari//
<<<

Welcome to my treasury of marginalia and stream-of-conscious<<ref "s">> digestion wherein I reckon with external long-form narratives. May I one day become proud of this directory.

I'm constantly preaching the //Liber// gospel of books and freedom to my chillun. [[You Think It's A GAME!|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OchyYnlHTdo]]?<<ref "g">> Even if only for them (and obviously it's not just for them), I need to practice what I preach to have the right to say "do as I do" rather than "do as I say, not as I do." I must fight to avoid the blissful shackles of hypocritical ignorance.<<ref "f">> Literacy is a practice of classical leisure for a reason. Here I document my progress in deepreading sources of any kind. I generally deepread books, but there are some hypertext rabbitholes which merit the same [[dok]] of charity, empathy, and extensive scrutiny.<<ref "h">>

My illiteracies are a source of shame. I have to take a deep breath and remind myself that my public schools were among the poorest of the second to last ranked state (at the time).<<ref "t">> I learned alongside the truly poor in what were (and still are) essentially the third world boonies; a lot of kids only had meals at school.<<ref "p">> I have done well for myself with what I had, especially as an autist. I have made progress before, and I [[hope]] to do it again.

Do what you can, homie. Enjoy what you can. Maybe you can't fix your stupidity, but you gotta try. You may never be well-read, but that doesn't matter. Spend the rest of your life earning your own approval in this practice. Like all humans, you deserve to be a literate man. Seize it! Throw yourself into the depths of Humanity. You are not alone.

!! Principles:

* Transclude where appropriate.
* Read with your family, and keep an annual log in //Focus://
* ~~Pix~~ Write or it didn't happen.
* Destroy the sunk cost fallacy; aggressively put down your reading sources if they aren't worth reading without confabulation. 
* Curate and scale your investigations and digestions appropriately.
* Wear your Straussian, Montaignian, and other hermeneutical+motivational hats where appropriate.
