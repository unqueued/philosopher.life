title: 2019.09.16 - Afterschool Teaching: Todalab

Whitney was there early today, though she didn't do any prep. Social dominance theory in action. We talked about how my weekend went. What I do with my time is so boring to her. She offers the passing gestures of someone who doesn't care at all, lol. I am sure I made (and continue to make) the same error. I smashed through our prep and spoke with my highschoolers for a bit.

Delp is requiring us all to head to the lab, but wasn't direct about it. He pretended like I had a choice in the matter (cute). I walked through the rooms I'd prefer to be in one at a time (him shooting me down again and again), and then he decided to explain our position. He's going to have to command it. He pulled me aside about it later. Deceptions and trying to make me think it's my idea (a tactic I eventually find from many people) are not going to help you here. He will have to pay for a dialectical extension of his identity in this case.

One-on-ones were smooth enough. 5KR told me about her therapy, and it went well. I'm glad. Lots of my children skate on Fridays. Everyone had homework.

I got to see [[gh057]] for 10 seconds. Mondays are difficult days for connecting with him.

I was not alone today. Matt took the 5th. That made it considerably better as I babysat and made sure all my children did their homework. 

5NP came to yet another agreement, but I'm sure it will be forgotten.

6KM and I are wrestling. Zero hesitation lying in her, and her [[arrogance]] is [[beautiful]].

Some of my catfighters hugged today. I have no idea how or why, as I've assumed my mediation has failed. They figured it out, at least for a while.

I played plenty of whackamole with my troublemakers in between generating plausible deniability for enabling freedoms within the library. The popos office is in the library (with her walking in and out), with a teacher and the librarian walking through, it was crucial that I could demonstrate their breaking school policy was outside of my sight. I cannot train my children to break rules wisely quickly enough, but this, ofc, is a test I have and generally do fail all the time. 

I've had to be fairly serious and impatient in my wrestling with many of children. Let's see if it curbs what I see.

7CM is looking awful; something happened this weekend. She randomly picked up her phone and threw it at the wall (bursting into pieces). She looks like she's been through hell. She eventually had to just sit in the office.

7C did have 8N's phone. He apologized. I think it was an accident in this case. She was cool with it, so I am.

8HM and I talked about her building her family's house this summer. She deserves so much more than I can give her.

We had a classroom lecture/Come to Jesus moment about why we were in the lab, what it's going to take for us to stay in here, and why I'm here. I desperately want more for them. I got some pseudo-amens about the prison. I hope some of them will take me up on dialectics and building things in our spare time.

My robotics crew worked on their robots.

7DM gave me a hug (even more open with me after having discussed autism). He said he wants to work on wikis with me. 5CF briefly wanted to try programming, but lost interest (understandably). 6JR is working on Python, and he said he wants to work on a wiki as well. 

Delp and I were working over walkietalkies, but it's very hard to hear. I ended up using the phone a lot for clarification. He doesn't know my children's names, as they point out. 

We had some dancing in the lab. Herding cats went okay though. 

The night ended with me handing him the brownies my daughter made for him.
