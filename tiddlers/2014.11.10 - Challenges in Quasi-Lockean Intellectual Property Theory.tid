title: 2014.11.10 - Challenges in Quasi-Lockean Intellectual Property Theory

Intellectual property (IP) rights are an increasingly vital area of philosophical inquiry in a global society dependent on information and intellectual labor. This paper investigates the challenges faced by a quasi-Lockean IP theory used to determine, explain, and justify moral, private IP rights. The status quo of legal IP rights, or something quite like it, is sometimes defended on quasi-Lockean moral grounds. This paper describes significant challenges for such an account, and provides reasons to think the status quo of IP rights, or similar states of affairs, may not be justified on Lockean grounds. 

I begin this paper by providing context and laying some groundwork to show where this extended IP theory is positioned in a general landscape of property concepts and theories. We will consider the basic and foundational quasi-Lockean theory for physical property and examine the standard Lockean IP extension built on top of that foundation. From there, I will offer a series of objections to this extension. In particular, I disagree with Lockean IP theorists about the targets of IP rights, the need for a property theory regarding non-rivalrous objects, the coherence and viability of rules and mechanics for IP acquisition, and the soundness of domain selection for IP rights. The standard quasi-Lockean IP theory may lack the explanatory qualities we should require for agreeing to the limitations on our freedom that it would impose. Ultimately, I advocate a non-interference right rather than private IP rights. In considering an alternative view, I will explore the possibility that discussions of IP have been too narrow and offer possible exceptions to this right of non-interference.

!!! ''Groundwork Property Concepts and Narrowing Our Focus''

IP is a hotly contested topic in philosophy, law, political science, library science, and other disciplines as well. Generally, the topic of IP is approached as a set of legal rights resulting from laws constructed by a legal system. Naturally, philosophical discussions of IP tend to revolve around political philosophy more so than ordinary moral philosophy. Granted, even in these discussions, IP laws are often justified on moral grounds. The normative force of an IP right generated by positive laws, however, isn’t necessarily based solely on moral grounds. Further, the construction of positive laws may often require certain kinds of pragmatic sacrifices which moral laws need not make. Depending on how we approach these issues, positive and moral laws can differ widely in many respects, and IP is no exception. 

This paper will focus on a modern quasi-Lockean framework for moral IP rights employed to justify and maintain the status quo of legal IP rights (or something similar) found in many Anglo-American nations.<<ref "1">> Before we dive in, we need to lay a basic groundwork. The topic of property is plagued with problems of definitions and challenging conceptual analysis, and we should briefly consider what we mean by property right. 

Generally, a property right is a bundled set of rights for some set of people concerning the access, use, or control of some set of objects. The origins of these rights are usually a set of rules (positive laws, moral laws, etc.). These rules bind a certain society or population. Property rules generate property claim rights for some set of people and corresponding obligations toward the rights-holder(s) regarding that property for another set of people. There are different classes of property rules and rights, including private, common, and collective. We will focus on private property.

Private property rights are often what we have in mind when we think of property rights. Broadly, some private entity (an individual or corporation) has some set of rights to access, use, or control some set of objects. The bundles of control, access, and use rights tend to clump together with a similar scope for private property rights. To a significant extent, the control over private property belongs to the private property rights-holders.<<ref "2">> Of course, private property rights don’t necessarily have to include absolute control over some set of objects.<<ref "3">> 

Legions of philosophical perspectives surround the theory and practice of property rules and rights. The view I will dissect in this paper aims at moral, private IP rules and rights. This narrows the discussion considerably, since much of the literature on property focuses either on a legal realm or on traditional objects of property rights (e.g. land and other strictly physical objects). In this paper, we will see a tension between proponents of private IP rights and what I believe is the more intuitive and defensible position: a non-interference right which enables us to use our minds as we see fit.<<ref "4">>

There are different kinds of philosophical accounts and justifications for the lineage and development of moral, private IP rules and rights. Outside of Hegelian accounts, we generally hear two kinds of arguments today in favor of moral IP rights: utilitarian arguments concerning incentives and quasi-Lockean stories involving entitlement to the fruits of intellectual labor. 

As we shall see, Lockean IP theorists need a convincing story which explains the metaphysical and physical relationships between objects and owners. In contrast, utilitarians don’t necessarily need to provide that sort of story. Utilitarianism can demand national holidays for Cthulhu or require other ostensibly bogus obligations or rules, and that would be fine if it maximized utility. Utilitarians need to tell us a potent epistemic story. Lockean theorists, however, need to present us a potent ontic story.<<ref "5">> Many of us may already buy the Lockean ontic story for the usual sorts of private physical property, but it is unclear whether a clean, relevant, and comprehensive ontic story can be told for intellectual property.

We will focus on a modern, quasi-Lockean perspective.<<ref "6">> The basic quasi-Lockean story for private physical property seems to have the ring of truth to it for most people. At least for physical objects, this account sketches a genealogical distribution and justificatory story which many of us take for granted. That foundational story, on which the IP story is built or extended, goes approximately like this:

Objects generally start out as being unowned, with the exception that we own ourselves to some significant extent. We have a basis for thinking that objects (since we are objects) can be owned. Further, we have practical reasons and needs for the use of resources and objects. Many objects are finite, and we assume there must be moral rules which govern how these unowned objects are appropriated and/or distributed.<<ref "7">> 

Barring some set of conditions, when someone becomes the first to occupy or fittingly mix his labor with some unowned object, many of us have the intuition that he appropriates that object.<<ref "8">> Roughly, he appropriates this object because he owns himself and his labor, and therefore he is entitled to the suitable fruits of his labor. In particular, his entitlement to the fruits of his labor only applies to labor upon objects he already owned, or unowned objects.<<ref "9">> Somehow, his labor imbues an object, perhaps becomes part of that object (or the object becomes an extension of his identity), and since he owns his labor, he appropriates the object. Exactly how this plays out is not clear. There could be many ways to explain this particular part of the story.

What we have here, then, is some set of moral rules which we believe generate some set of private property rights for him with regards to the object he appropriates. Unless there are some intervening reasons or moral obligations, he will have a bundle of moral, private property rights to that object. Applying this process over and over, and in conjunction with the valid transfer of acquired properties (consensual trading, selling, giving, bequeathing, etc.), we see the skeleton of a broad genealogical picture of moral, private property rights and a basic justification.

There are many objections one might raise to this Lockean story, particularly regarding labor mixing. The notion of imbuing unowned objects might sound mystical to certain folks. Further, it isn’t clear precisely what rights resulting from mixing one’s labor ought to be included in the overall bundle. However, I’m not trying to debate the merits of this foundational, unextended quasi-Lockean perspective for physical objects. Many people at least see some merit in the notion that we own the fruits of our labor to a large extent. There seems to be a common sense notion that when you chop down an unowned tree and build a chair from it, you own that chair. Let’s assume the story works.

The quasi-Lockean IP theorist claims we can extend this basic theory for physical objects to intellectual objects. Can and should this story be extended to include intellectual property? Intellectual labor is a kind of labor, after all. At the very least, you surely own your thoughts, which is a kind of fruit of your intellectual labor. What other possible products of intellectual labor are you justified in morally, privately owning?

!!! ''Extending the Physical Property Framework for Intellectual Objects and Labor''

As far as I can tell, there isn’t a thorough, well-articulated, soup-to-nuts account of the IP extension of the Lockean physical property theory. What I have found is a loose collection of generally agreed upon assumptions and claims surrounding a sketch of an extended ontic story.<<ref "10">> It seems many IP theorists take such an account for granted and work from these assumptions; they are more likely interested in broader issues and questions which arise from or before such an account rather than the mechanics and internals of the account itself. That’s fair, though, since we have to start somewhere in the dialectic. What follows is my attempt to charitably construct an outline of this standard account. I will eventually argue that when we take a closer look under the hood, such an account is unintuitive and lacking in explanatory power, but I want to do my best to present their case.

For the standard Lockean IP extension, a litany of activities is thought to fall under the umbrella of intellectual labor, including inventing, innovating, writing, recording, systematizing, creating, and discovering. What are the fruits of intellectual labor? Beyond our mere thoughts and the physical objects we create, the standard answer is some sort of abstract idea, a metaphysical object or entity, often referred to as an intellectual object. 

We are forced to ask, then, what is an intellectual object? This is a tricky question, and the standard approach generally tries to evade talking about the critical metaphysics underpinning an answer. We seem to assume some robust sort of metaphysics in asserting the existence of these intellectual objects, although it doesn’t have to extend all the way to an extreme framework like Platonism.<<ref "11">> The answer to this question is not clear, and that’s okay. It may be difficult to defend a robust, systematic position in metaphysics (especially if you focus on ethics and political philosophy). The standard approach jumps ahead and answers a different question: What objects are the IP rights targeting? If we can answer this question, perhaps we can begin to clarify the fruits of our intellectual labor.

There seem to be two paths one could take. One path, the intellectual object thesis, is the claim that an IP rights-holder has a bundle of property rights targeting the intellectual object which has been created or discovered. This path entails the possibility that metaphysical entities or artifacts can be owned; they are themselves the targets of IP rights. The other path, the manifestations thesis, is the claim that an IP rights-holder has a bundle of rights concerning the use and distribution of humanly-made physical manifestations or expressions of an intellectual object. On this view, IP rights target the physical instantiations of intellectual objects, not the intellectual objects themselves. 

If the Lockean IP extension is built on the intellectual object thesis, it has a targeting mechanism quite similar to the underlying physical theory. Essentially, the fruits of intellectual labor are intellectual objects, and those objects are the targets of IP rights. The initial difference between this version of the extension and the underlying account can be found in what type of objects are targeted by the property rights. Directly owning metaphysical entities, like intellectual objects, is a significant departure from the physical theory. The targeting principles of this extended theory seem to parallel the unextended account, but the ontic story may be a bit different and more complicated because the type of object targeted is so dissimilar.

If, on the other hand, the IP extension is built on the manifestation thesis, it does not depart from the unextended account in terms of the type of object targeted by property rights. Property rights from both this extension and the underlying theory exclusively target physical objects. The manifestation thesis based extension radically departs from the unextended theory in the targeting mechanism. 

For unextended physical property rights, the object with which you mix your labor is what you directly own. According to an extension built on the manifestation thesis, however, you don’t own what you’ve created or discovered precisely, which in part is thought to be the intellectual object; rather, you have property rights to the corresponding humanly-made physical manifestations of that intellectual object.<<ref "12">> As Adam Moore explains it:

<<<
Rights do not surround the abstract non-physical entity, or res, of intellectual property; rather, intellectual property rights surround the control of physical manifestations or expressions… Intellectual property rights are rights that surround control of the physical manifestations or tokens of ideas.<<ref "13">>
<<<

This shift in targets may not be without reason. First, dealing with physical manifestations has far less mystique about it. This shift in targets grounds the discussion for folks who want as little do with metaphysics as possible. Secondly, when it comes to enforcement (which isn’t necessarily something a moral theory has to be concerned with), it may be more practical to target the physical instantiations. Lastly, some people might be persuaded by this case: if an intellectual object were directly owned by someone else, then I might be violating his rights simply by thinking about that object. This would be intolerable to many of our intuitions, and might lead someone to say the intellectual object isn’t directly owned, but rather the physical objects corresponding to it are the targets of IP rights.<<ref "14">> 

What it means to create a physical manifestation of an intellectual object can be non-obvious. Here is a fairly straightforward example: when you compose your own piece of music, you have created or discovered some intellectual object specifying a series of sound waves. The abstract specification or represented configuration of sounds waves is the intellectual object you’ve created or discovered.<<ref "15">> The corresponding .flac file on your hard drive is a physical expression of that intellectual object. If I were to code, record, compose, or copy a representation of that precise series of sound waves onto a CD, I would have created a physical manifestation of the intellectual object you labored to create or discover.

Given the extension built using the intellectual object thesis, you own the intellectual object directly. That specification of sound waves is yours. I’ve violated your IP rights by not getting your consent to use your intellectual object. On the extension built on the manifestations thesis, however, you own the physical manifestations, including the CD I burned. Presumably, if you had IP rights surrounding the physical manifestations of that intellectual object, then I’ve trampled on them. 

What if I created an adjusted manifestation, whereby I changed just a tiny bit of one of the sound waves? Overwhelmingly, and regardless of which thesis is selected for the extension, IP theorists believe I’m still violating your rights. My adjusted manifestation is considered a derivative of your work. That my manifestation was similar enough to your manifestation or the corresponding intellectual object is sufficient for claiming I’ve violated your IP rights. 

We can flesh out this view in at least two ways. It is possible that when you create or discover an intellectual object, you’ve really created or discovered a family of them which are sufficiently similar. Every manifestation would then directly correspond to some mirror-image intellectual object. The intellectual object thesis might lean in this direction. Another possibility is that you’ve only created or discovered a single intellectual object, but there are families of manifestations similar enough to the original, mirror-image manifestation.<<ref "16">> The manifestations thesis may be in a better position to adopt this view.

Eventually, however, there comes a point where I have made so many adjustments to the series of sound waves that I have a different song entirely, and, essentially, an intellectual object which you didn’t create or discover. 

While unstated, it may be assumed that intellectual property rights do not exist until there is some kind of humanly-made physical manifestation of the intellectual object. Presumably, this is for a practical reason: how else would we know someone had come up with or discovered an intellectual object? Technically, however, a moral theory isn’t conceptually bound to such practicalities.

Vitally, and regardless of the thesis selection, IP theorists believe the domain of protected objects is a limited subset of all intellectual objects. This domain is comprised almost entirely of works of copyright, patents, trade secrets, and trademarks. Each subdomain is generally associated with a different bundle of rights.

Those are the essential background points. There are numerous other factors and possibilities we could take into account. For example, some Lockean IP theorists may wrestle with possible proviso considerations, such as a spoilage or waste proviso, a charity proviso for those in extreme need, or the standard “enough, and as good left for others” sufficiency proviso.<<ref "17">> Other theorists may appeal to a more strictly historical Lockean perspective, attempting to ensure supreme and detailed compatibility between historical Lockean theory and an IP extension.<<ref "18">> I’ve set aside these kinds of considerations since I’m simply after the core and most widely accepted stance.

Given this standard background, the story of this quasi-Lockean IP extension for intellectual objects and labor goes something like this:

Someone intellectually labors; she creates or discovers a previously non-existing or undiscovered intellectual object. If the intellectual object falls into one of the protected subdomains, then either the humanly-made physical manifestations of that intellectual object are candidates for IP protection (manifestations thesis) or the intellectual object is a candidate for IP protection (intellectual object thesis). Using the manifestations thesis, the current and future humanly-made physical manifestations of that intellectual object will be the targets of her IP rights. Using the intellectual object thesis, her IP rights will target the intellectual object.

Since she owns herself, and she owns her labor, including her intellectual labor, then she will appropriate either the intellectual object or the humanly-made physical manifestations corresponding to the intellectual object she intellectually labored to create or discover. 

Barring some set of conditions or intervening moral obligations (presumably analogous to the unextended physical property theory), she will have a bundle of private, moral IP rights to either the intellectual object or the physical manifestations of this intellectual object, wherein the exact bundle is specific to the subdomain of the intellectual object. This bundle includes property rights to derivatives. 

At first glance, this seems like a reasonable story and a fairly appropriate extension of the Lockean theory for physical property rights. Many people seem to buy it. Creators or discoverers of intellectual objects are compensated for their intellectual labor. It feels like justice has been served when that occurs. While that is alluring, we must ask: Does this IP story work? Does it satisfactorily extend the initial physical theory? Do we need this theory? 

Almost everyone would agree that when you chop down an unowned tree and build a chair from it, you own that chair. IP stories, however, don’t seem as intuitive as this chair story because there are significant differences, glitches, and gaps. The rest of this paper is devoted to examining problems with this sketch and considering the space of arguments and dialectical moves available to the quasi-Lockean IP theorist to rebut these challenges. 

!!! ''Non-Rivalrousness and the Manifestations Thesis''

There seem to be at least two exceptionally compelling and intertwined reasons for wanting moral, private property rules and rights.<<ref "19">> First, many vital resources are finite, and we want a moral framework to account for fair and legitimate appropriation and private ownership of those scarce resources.<<ref "20">> Second, barring some intervening considerations, you should own the fruits of your labor, lest society verge on mass theft and possibly some form of slavery.<<ref "21">>
 
Generally, for physical objects and properties, both reasons matter. However, it is not clear that both reasons are relevant enough to intellectual objects and labor to result in IP rules and rights. In particular, intellectual objects are widely considered non-rivalrous. I can use an intellectual object (e.g. thinking about it or creating a physical manifestation of it) without directly impairing anyone else’s ability to use that intellectual object. 

An intellectual object can’t be consumed or destroyed. We can all simultaneously use it. Unless we have really good reasons showing otherwise, shouldn’t everyone have fair and complete access to non-rivalrous objects? Do we need a private property theory for non-rivalrous objects? It doesn’t seem like we do. 

Consider the number 2. This is an intellectual object. We can’t consume or destroy it. We can all simultaneously use it. We can all think about it at the same time. We can all concurrently create physical expressions of it by writing the numeral down on a page. We can all employ it in counting our thumbs without impairing each other. Like all other intellectual objects, its consumption is non-rivalrous. It is radically different from any physical object, since only a finite set of people can use a physical object in any given period of time.  The number 2, unlike physical objects, is available to everyone for all time.

At least to my intuitions, the obvious starting place for non-rivalrous objects, such as intellectual objects, would be no property rights, or perhaps a general right to non-interference concerning the access and use of those non-rivalrous objects.<<ref "22">> Fair and unlimited use is always possible. We need fantastic reasons to justify limiting the initial freedoms of people, and it isn’t easy to see why we need to put restrictions on the use of and access to non-rivalrous objects.<<ref "23">> 

I am not claiming that IP rights are irreversibly or conceptually illegitimate because intellectual objects are non-rivalrous.<<ref "24"> Rather, the non-rivalrous aspect of intellectual objects are significant prima facie reason against private IP rights, one which may be overcome with an effective argument. The non-rivalrous nature of intellectual objects shifts the burden of proof onto the Lockean IP theorist regarding why these non-rivalrous objects can and should be privately owned, particularly via labor-mixing acquisition.

Note, however, a Lockean IP theorist could rely upon the manifestation thesis, and in doing say claim that intellectual objects aren’t directly owned. On the manifestation thesis, IP rights target the physical manifestations of intellectual objects. Physical objects, however, are finite and rivalrous. Thus, one path available to the IP theorist for avoiding the issue of justifying the private ownership of non-rivalrous objects is by claiming the objects at stake here are actually rivalrous – namely, the physical manifestations.

Assuming we buy the manifestation thesis, if the only objects which are owned in this IP story are physical objects, then why do we need an IP story at all? We already have a theory to explain how physical objects are acquired. Why doesn’t the unextended Lockean property theory already explain the phenomena? The IP theorist relying on the manifestation thesis must offer a convincing argument for this. 

Here is an example of how the unextended quasi-Lockean property theory for physical objects might operate:

Let’s say you take the time to paint a fantasy landscape. You labored on physical objects previously unowned or owned by you, and the result is a painting you now own (which just so happens to correspond to a particular intellectual object). You then proudly show me your painting, and I love it. Later on, I paint my own fantasy landscape identical to yours (corresponding to the same intellectual object). I labored on physical objects previously unowned or owned by me, and the result is a painting I now own. That these paintings share the same intellectual object borders on irrelevant to the matter at hand. On the unextended theory, we each own our paintings that we labored to create. We both receive the actual fruits of our labor, the physical objects we each created, and that seems to be the end of the story. 

The same kind of story could be told in countless different ways, whether it’s about making a hat for ourselves, farming, or making a fire by rubbing sticks together. Any kind of human labor is going to require intellectual labor, and the correspondence to intellectual objects just isn’t relevant to the resulting rights. If we take the quasi-Lockean IP argument to be claiming that one owns the physical manifestations of intellectual objects, rather than the intellectual objects themselves, then it isn’t clear why we need to extend the basic, physical Lockean story. True, your labor required some intellectual labor, but what kind of labor doesn’t? 

Further, why should I not receive the fruits of my labor? The IP theorist must provide a compelling case. We need to see why it matters, in terms of ownership rights, that I’ve duplicated your work.

The IP theorist may be tempted to argue that you put forth more effort to create your work of art than I did, and so it isn’t fair that we both arrived at owning identical objects. There are at least two problems, however, with that claim. First, the results of our labor are not necessarily identical. For example, you owned your piece of art before I owned mine (many differences in results may follow from that). Second, even if the results of our labor are identical, is it really morally relevant in a Lockean framework that you worked harder for your results? 

Not everyone finds themselves in equal conditions genetically or circumstantially, and sometimes it takes differing amounts of labor to arrive at the same results. If the foundational Lockean perspective is actually going to drive the extension, it would be improper to dock people for having intellectual advantages which were outside their control. That simply isn’t what the Lockean perspective is about. I had a circumstantial advantage you did not have in creating my painting, but that wasn’t entirely up to either of us, and I don’t see why it should affect either of our ownership rights in a strictly Lockean story. 

The IP theorist may be tempted to fight back and claim that I’ve stolen your labor, even if only indirectly. But, how? Did I, to any degree, take anything from you or extract labor from you without your consent? No. You consented to everything you did. I didn’t take your painting or labor from you. I took nothing from you. It is up to the IP theorist relying on the manifestations thesis to demonstrate the theft occurring in this case which motivates an extension of the basic Lockean account. 

I agree with the intuition that there is something cosmically unfair about our labor/results ratio. A Lockean account, however, is the wrong story with which to argue about the type of unfairness found here. Fairness in the Lockean story alone is about being entitled to the appropriate fruits of one’s labor and preventing slavery, and not really the end distribution of ownership rights given how much we’ve labored.

Assuming we buy the manifestations thesis, the IP theorist needs to provide us a good argument for why we need to extend the basic Lockean story for physical objects in the first place. The IP theorist needs to convince us that theft is occurring, and I don’t see how they can when they assume that only physical objects are owned. Essentially, the path to avoiding the justification of the ownership of non-rivalrous objects, via switching the targets of ownership from intellectual objects to the corresponding physical objects, is fraught with challenges. 

A Lockean IP extension built on the manifestations thesis is likely unacceptable for at least two reasons. First, we don’t have a good argument for why we should switch targets. If we assume the fruit of intellectual labor is the intellectual object, then why isn’t that the target of IP rights? Surely it would be the obvious choice. Second, we say you “use” an intellectual object when creating a physical manifestation of it. The rights which prevent me from creating a physical manifestation of the intellectual object you created or discovered are rights concerning the use of that intellectual object in a particular way. But that seems to imply direct ownership of the intellectual object.  

The best version of the Lockean IP extension seems to rely upon the intellectual object thesis rather than the manifestation thesis. For the rest of the paper, then, I’m going to assume the path of the manifestations thesis is not taken. Instead, I take the quasi-Lockean IP theory to be concerned with the ownership of intellectual objects themselves.<<ref "25">> But, if we take up the intellectual object thesis, then we go back to the initial problem with the private ownership of non-rivalrous objects. The burden of proof is on the IP theorist to demonstrate how and why a non-rivalrous object could be privately owned to any degree.<<ref "26">>
 
Perhaps the claim that laborers are entitled to the appropriate fruits of their labor might justify the private ownership of these non-rivalrous objects. If so, then it is up to the IP theorist to demonstrate why the reasons for entitlement are so potent they override our initial non-interference rights to non-rivalrous intellectual objects, enabling the private ownership of these non-rivalrous objects via intellectual labor mixing. 

It makes sense why we want a property theory for being entitled to the fruits of our labor regarding rivalrous objects. When someone steals the taco salad I’ve made, they’ve stolen my labor. In contrast, when someone builds an identical taco salad after watching me build my mine, I still have my taco salad. My labor hasn’t been stolen from me. Maybe building his taco salad was easier for him, but so what? I could have just kept my taco salad, construction techniques, and recipe a secret, but I didn’t. In this situation, where has the theft occurred? More importantly, it isn’t clear why I should own a non-rivalrous object such as the intellectual object of a taco salad. We need reasons to justify a property theory for objects which don’t intuitively seem to need one.

!!! ''Unexplained Intellectual Objects, Derivatives, and Mechanics of Appropriation''

Since the IP theorist cannot or should not employ the manifestations thesis, then he must instead argue that one owns intellectual objects themselves. Justifying the private ownership of non-rivalrous objects alone is an uphill battle. However, a Lockean account of IP is open to a network of other challenges as well. There are significant gaps to the operation of this ontic story which need to be explained because limiting our freedoms via private IP rights requires a worthy and comprehensive justification.

The standard account generally doesn’t specify many elements of the metaphysics in the ontic story. I sympathize with the desire to minimize the reliance upon metaphysics, but it seems reasonable to ask for a clearer account of the nature of intellectual objects and how the process of appropriation of these abstract objects functions. 

The fact is that intellectual objects are less understood than, and very different from, trees and chairs.<<ref "27">> To arrive at private IP rights, a significant amount of work needs to be done to show how the analogy between the physical and the intellectual or abstract honestly holds, but that requires understanding the nature of intellectual objects and how ownership could possibly operate in the first place.

We don’t know if an intellectual object is actually a single intellectual object or if it is really a collection of many intellectual objects. We don’t know how intellectual objects relate to each other, either. It is unclear where derivatives end and original works begin. We don’t know how or why to draw lines of similarity and define derivatives. 

Science provides us a clean causal story for physical objects, and the unextended Lockean theory seems to add only a pinch of metaphysics to the ontic story. Lockean IP stories, by comparison, aren’t as clear (perhaps unacceptably so). Intellectual objects don’t have a nice timeline; we are much less capable of understanding their beginnings and ends. We might not even know precisely on what we intellectually labor. We have a fairly clean ontic story for physical objects and property, in which we work on unowned physical objects or objects we already own. We don’t have a similarly clean story for intellectual objects and labor. 

We can’t just bypass or merely guess at how these concerns work out. It is crucial to have some understanding of these sorts of issues in order to justify and know our various IP rights and obligations. The IP theorist needs to show he isn’t making it up as he goes; we need to see why the practical IP rules he enshrines aren’t arbitrary.

We need to know what counts as violating IP rights. For example, duplicating a modern Mona Lisa is a violation, but it isn’t clear if duplicating just a quadrant of the Mona Lisa is a violation (or why). It isn’t clear what principle we would use to determine how many particles must be duplicated or unaltered before a tribute to the Mona Lisa is a violation. 

Similarly, from our music example: at some point, I can speed up your song enough that it is a new intellectual object. We don’t know how much I need to speed up the song before it is no longer under your umbrella of protections. What rule governs this distinction? Further, we don’t really know why it is acceptable for me to play 5 seconds of your song on the radio without your consent, but not 50 seconds.<<ref "28">> For whatever rule we might use, it is hard to see how the rule itself could be defended on strictly Lockean grounds.

Unfortunately, IP rules and rights tend to generate conflicting intuitions all the time. Consider a case in which I’ve removed 50% of the sound waves from the original piece of music; surely that isn’t a protected derivative. Precisely how much is necessary to remove in order to avoid generating a derivative is another issue, but let’s assume 50% is fine. What if I’ve removed 50% of the sound waves, but none of the removed sound waves were in the range of frequencies which humans can hear? Or, consider the fact that our auditory systems are scientifically known to play tricks on us (filling in the gaps); what if I made radical alterations to the sound waves (producing many gaps), but humans couldn’t sense the difference? Suddenly, many IP theorists would be inclined to go the other direction and claim infringement. We need good rules that draw bright lines to answer these questions.

If you make a detailed mural on a wall, and I duplicate it in a tiny bitmap image, I’m still thought to be violating your rights. Lossy-compressed works of art are still derivatives of the original. Is there a point at which I’ve made such a tiny, compressed image of your mural that it is no longer considered a violation of your rights? I don’t know how or why we can draw that line. It can go the other direction too. If I make a tiny bitmap image first, and then you make a detailed mural on a wall which just “fills out” the details, you seem to be violating my supposed rights. Why and how?

IP theorists accept that computer generated objects are protectable under IP rules. This is interesting because it allows for a brute force thought experiment which applies to most kinds of IP. For example, it is extremely common for images and music to be computer generated today. What if I systematically create all possible previously unowned pieces of music and image bitmaps on a supercomputer?<<ref "29">> It seems like I would have an incredibly extensive set of IP rights. Anyone making any sort of music or image would be violating my IP rights. This is intolerable to the intuitions of most IP theorists, but they have to give reasons why I wouldn’t have appropriated all of these corresponding intellectual objects.

Consider a case in which you invent the combustion engine, a 2-stroke engine which can only use 91 octane gasoline as fuel. Do you have an IP right to the very general notion of a combustion engine or only a specific kind? To some intuitions, it would seem like I’m still violating your IP rights if I build an almost identical combustion engine which can only use 85 octane gasoline as fuel. What if I built a 4-stroke engine? What if I built a similar engine for diesel or even a non-petroleum fuel altogether? It is unclear when progress in the arena of engines is no longer a violation of your IP rights, but rather something counted as my invention. An effective IP theory requires justified principles or rules which draw these sorts of lines.

Or consider the case of the wrap dress. Diane von Fürstenberg designed the wrap dress in 1974. Despite the fact that von Fürstenberg is still living and still designing fabulous clothes, the wrap dress pattern, an intellectual object, is not considered to be her IP – anyone is free to buy a knock-off version or create their own. Why isn’t that intellectual object protected like other sorts of designs? It isn’t clear why Fürstenberg hasn’t acquired IP rights in these cases, and why these knock-offs, which appear to be derivatives of Fürstenberg wrap dresses, aren’t considered actual derivatives or duplicates.
  
As far as I can tell, all intellectual properties have these sorts of problems. These cases demonstrate how our understanding of intellectual objects and derivatives is filled with guesswork. My gut instinct is to claim derivatives are actually different intellectual objects entirely, and if the Lockean IP theory works at all, it should only grant IP rights to the original, but none of the derivatives.

If we don’t have effective reasons to include derivative objects under the umbrella protections of the original intellectual object, then all that is left are ownership rights to the original intellectual object. Depending on how detailed we take an intellectual object to be, that could mean IP rights are much slimmer than we thought. If these objects are detailed enough, it is possible that only one physical expression could correspond to an intellectual object, but then, by definition, no duplicate would really correspond to the intellectual object.<<ref "30">> Defending derivatives is likely crucial to the IP theorist’s view, but it is not obvious why we should buy into the notion that there are derivatives.

Even if we were to get past some of these line-drawing metaphysical problems, the actual mechanics of appropriation and the resulting IP rights aren’t clear, either. For example, what if multiple people independently create/discover an intellectual object?<<ref "31">>  Many timeframe and epistemic issues arise from this which fuzzes our understanding of IP rights and appropriation. 

If I’m the first person to create or discover an intellectual object, then supposedly I’m the owner. It is quite unclear why my creating or discovering an intellectual object at some point in time and place should result in rights which have anything to do with your independently creating or discovering the same intellectual object at some other point in time and place. An IP theorist could claim that we both somehow deserve shared IP rights, although it isn’t clear what those rights should look like (nor how we might know there was another creator/discoverer who also had shared rights). 

There are also many categories of intellectual progress which require stepping-stones to advance. Consider a case in which I’m inventing the car. It seems like I’m relying upon numerous other intellectual objects which I don’t own. I’m standing on the shoulders of giants.<<ref "32">> Am I allowed to invent the car if you own the wheel? Even if I can invent it, why would I own it? Almost any creation or discovery of an intellectual object relies upon a web of other intellectual objects (which supposedly may be owned). It is not clear if such creations or discoveries should result in IP rights, and even if they did, it is unclear what the bundles of IP rights should be, how they are distributed, and why. 

Further, is it enough that I simply dreamt up the basic notion of a car in order for me to own that intellectual object?<<ref "33">> That might not be enough. How much of the schematic do I need to have generated before I’ve really created or discovered the car? It would seem odd to require a working prototype; many patents are granted without one.  We need to know how much and precisely what kind of labor is necessary and sufficient for acquiring an intellectual object.

For example, a nature photojournalist, David Slater, was in Indonesia when a Macara nigra monkey swiped David’s camera and took a famous selfie.<<ref "34">> Who has the IP rights to this photograph? Some people think Slater performed an appropriate kind and amount of work to have acquired the rights simply by venturing into the jungle of Indonesia, taking pictures, and accidentally earning this prize experience. Others think his luck just isn’t sufficient; after all, David didn’t take the picture, the monkey did. At what point does intellectual intent (rather than mere accident) play a role in intellectual labor mixing? The IP theorist has to provide a theory comprehensive enough to draw the appropriate line and justify it.

These are some of the many gaps in the ontic story which the quasi-Lockean IP theorist needs to fill in order for us to even understand what it means to be entitled to the fruits of intellectual labor. Without knowing what it really means to be entitled to the fruits of intellectual labor at this practical level, it is hard to see why we should agree there is any entitlement.

!!! ''Unexplained Domains of Protected Intellectual Objects''

Not all intellectual objects fall into the domains protected by IP. These kinds of domains are generally codified in Anglo-American laws, but they also happen to be, by and large, what IP theorists are trying to defend and justify.<<ref "35">> Unfortunately, it isn’t clear how to provide strictly Lockean arguments in favor of these particular domains and their various quirks. 

The different domains of IP each come with a different bundle of rights. For example, a copyright is associated with rights and obligations quite different from trade secrets or patents. In a utilitarian theory, we might be able to provide significantly dissimilar utility stories for intellectual objects divided into domains of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and patents; hence the differences in the bundles of rights associated with these domains might be justified. Unfortunately, it isn’t clear how the differences in the domain-specific bundles of rights can be justified on exclusively quasi-Lockean grounds. Additionally, this may be a disanalogy with the unextended physical property theory where, unlike the IP extension, instances of private appropriation of physical objects generally result in a highly similar kind of bundles of rights.

These domains are accompanied by some odd bundles of rights which aren’t easily explained. There is a tradition of upheaval precisely at the point of identifying which bundle of rights is awarded for each domain; IP theorists and practitioners disagree on the correct bundles. A copyright, for example, hasn’t always been a lifetime property right (alternatively, some copyrights only extend for a certain number of years beyond the life of an author), nor is it necessarily a kind of property right which can be transferred to others indefinitely.  That you own something only for a limited period of time, and that you have impaired or limited control rights is odd. If there are Lockean IP rights, why would the ownership durations and control rights of these properties vary? It requires an explanation. We can justify these quirks with incentives-based utilitarian reasons for creative expression, but it isn’t clear how the strictly Lockean IP theorist can defend such quirky limitations on bundles of private property rights. 

Consider patents, which award a powerful monopoly over all expressions and implementations of an intellectual object for decades. Eligibility for the bundle of rights afforded by patent protection requires non-obvious novelty and usefulness. Maybe we can quickly defend novelty in terms of differentiating intellectual objects and ensuring a new intellectual object has actually been created or discovered.<<ref "36">> What rule draws the lines for usefulness and non-obviousness, and why should we agree to it? Even if we could provide this on Lockean grounds, we also need reasons why usefulness and non-obviousness are necessary for these IP rights. 

Trade secrets can have quirky bundles of rights, as well. For example, trade secret rights lapse when the owner communicates the secret to the public. But why should that communication matter? I can’t think of another kind of property in which my telling you about my property results in the lapse of my ownership rights to it.<<ref "37">>  We can see the word “secret” is in the name of this domain, but the Lockean IP theorist has to give us reasons why concealment could be so crucial for having and maintaining an IP right in the first place. 

I have sympathy for trade secrets. For any intellectual object which I alone know about, there is a natural pseudo-monopoly to that intellectual object. If I discover the recipe to the greatest hot sauce of all time, and I only make it for myself, and I never allow others to know about it, then it seems to result in something like an IP right. It would be immoral to torture me to release my secret information or to hack into my computer for my secret recipe.  Of course, the wrongness of these acts has little or, indeed, nothing to do with violating my supposed IP right. This natural pseudo-monopoly doesn’t need to be explained in terms of a real property right. If you aren’t precluded from figuring out the recipe for yourself and making your own hot sauce, then my secret is just a secret, and not obviously an IP right. An IP right should preclude you from discovering the recipe and making your own hot sauce. It isn’t clear why, on Lockean grounds, a trade secret should result in an IP right rather than just a natural pseudo-monopoly.

Trademarks are no exception to this unexplained quirkiness either. Trademarks are restricted by common, everyday language. You can’t own a word or symbol (or any other object which communicates semantics) which is an ordinary expression. What rule defines ordinary everydayness? What if trademarked words or symbols become ordinary expressions? We need clear rules and, vitally, justifications for those rules. While I can see how the utilitarian position might explain and justify these issues, I don’t see how the Lockean position can.

Admittedly, I am very sympathetic to the notion that people are morally obligated not to lie about who they are or who produced a product in the vast majority of circumstances. For example, I wouldn’t want Blackwater Security Consulting masquerading as UNICEF or the Red Cross since BSC and its various agents, services, and products don’t deserve the kind of respect or trust earned by entities like UNICEF and the RC. At first glance, that does seem like a trademark issue. These kinds of obligations not to deceive, however, aren’t necessarily tied to intellectual labor-mixing or anything which the Lockean IP extension provides.<<ref "38">> We can give other moral reasons not to deceive. 

Going back to the painting example, if we replace the painting with some other object, let’s say a chair (which also has a corresponding intellectual object), the IP theorist would surely claim no theft has occurred when I duplicate your chair. The chair could be a piece of art and/or an invention (I suppose it could technically fit any of the domains), but the IP theorist doesn’t think it can be covered by either copyright or patent protections (even if you were the first person to create a chair or a chair like that one). Why is the intellectual object corresponding to the physical painting ownable, but not the intellectual object corresponding to the physical chair? We can fabricate a utilitarian argument for this difference, but it is not obvious how the quasi-Lockean IP theorist can offer an effective argument for why certain intellectual objects which initially appear to fall under the protected domains end up not being protected. 

More problematic, and broader as well, the IP theorist needs to give a clear and effective argument for why only certain domains of intellectual objects are protected in the first place. This division needs an explanation; else the targets of IP protection seem arbitrary. What is the domain creating rule?  Why should only certain kinds of fruits of intellectual labor be open to ownership? These domains which are assumed to be protected require justifications.

I worry the quasi-Lockean IP theorist is forced to inject utilitarian justifications into his argument. In most IP discussions, this is generally how the domains are justified. I’m not against a mixed-method approach to justifying IP rights. The problem, however, is that this injection sullies the Lockean approach. The Lockean approach is interested in applying principles of justice, not utilitarian distributions. Once you bite the bullet in employing utilitarian justifications, why not stick to utilitarian arguments for IP? So many problems disappear when you do that.<<ref "39">> I’m going to set this aside since I’m investigating the merits of a purely quasi-Lockean account. Unfortunately, I don’t see how this justificatory and line-drawing work can be accomplished without utilitarian reasons.

There may be strictly Lockean paths for justifying domains, but they aren’t easy to provide. Consider the domains of mathematical equations, numbers, and other logical intellectual objects. These domains of intellectual objects are resoundingly rejected as being ownable. Why is that? It is common sense to us, but we need reasons for why numbers and equations don’t fall into the domains of privately ownable intellectual objects if there are somehow other intellectual objects which can be privately owned. 

The Lockean IP theorist may respond that these intellectual objects predate us.<<ref "40">> We merely discover them. One path available to the Lockean IP theorist is to claim intellectual objects like numbers and equations can’t be owned because they are discovered and aren’t created. Between the intellectual objects corresponding to a painting and a number or equation, it seems somewhat plausible to think that the painting’s intellectual object is created while the number or equation is discovered. Perhaps the distinction between discovered and created intellectual objects is a relevant way to cordon off the privately unownable intellectual objects from the privately ownable. But, even this view may generate conflicting intuitions for the IP theorist.

There is a world of questions and problems which arise from the philosophies of mathematics, information science, and computer science that bears upon the problem of domains for IP. For example, many assume computer programs are the kind of intellectual objects which can be owned. But, depending on your stances in these philosophies, you may be forced to concede that intellectual objects such as computer programs are mathematical objects. If mathematics can’t be owned, then computer programs couldn’t either. A host of similar problems can arise. Justifying boundaries for domains in Lockean IP theory requires an enormous set of controversial views on ontology.

In any case, an abundance of problems surround the formation and execution of these domains. So much rides on these unanswered issues. If IP theorists can’t provide a good reason for the domains, then it seems more likely that either all non-rivalrous intellectual objects can be privately owned or none can. Since the Lockean IP theorist already agrees that intellectual objects of most numbers, equations, and the chairs can’t be privately owned, then none of them can be privately owned on Lockean grounds.

!!! ''Non-Interference Right and Exceptions''

I agree we own certain fruits of our intellectual labor. The physical manifestations we create are byproducts of our intellectual labor, and the unextended quasi-Lockean theory for physical objects makes sense of this appropriation. Our thoughts are products of intellectual labor, and we own those (even if we don’t own the corresponding intellectual objects), and that probably has something to do with self-ownership rights. We don’t own all the fruits of our intellectual labor, though. I deny that we own the intellectual objects which we create or discover via intellectual labor. 

Private IP rights acquired via labor mixing mistakenly limit our liberty. These obligations prevent us from creating, discovering, learning, experiencing, copying, building upon the work of others, and using our minds in the ways we want to use them. I’ve tried to point out how quasi-Lockean IP theorists haven’t given us a coherent functional framework of reasons for why and how non-rivalrous objects, particularly intellectual objects, could be owned. Lockean IP theorists haven’t given us sufficient reasons for restricting individual liberties.

Along the way, I’ve suggested an alternative view and what I believe is a more plausible starting place for the Lockean. On solely Lockean grounds, we should either deny IP rights altogether or claim a general non-interference right to use and access intellectual objects. I prefer to think of it as a right to non-interference. This view maximizes our personal freedom and protects our self-ownership. 

IP rights are usually thought of as private property rights, and discussions tend reflect a very narrow conception of what counts as an IP right. My claim that we have non-interference rights to access and use intellectual objects doesn’t fit the normal discourse on the topic. Depending on how we flesh out property rights, it is possible that even the generalized non-interference right to intellectual objects should be classified as a type of IP right, even though it isn’t anything remotely like the standard, private IP rights we usually talk about. If what we mean by an IP right simply is some sort of right to an intellectual object, then perhaps I’m arguing for a kind of IP right.

A non-interference right is basically the claim that it is almost always (given some provisos or constraints) immoral to prevent people from using and accessing intellectual objects. Perhaps we really do have moral duties toward each other to refrain from interfering with how other people use their minds. It’s a positive thing! Denying any and all IP rights fails to capture this obligation and protection. Hence, I prefer to think of my view as promoting our personal rights rather than denying there are any IP rights at all, because I think we generally have moral obligations not to interfere with how people use their minds and intellectual objects. 

Admittedly, I’ve raised a number of objections to private IP rights in this paper, and we might worry a few of them somehow stick to the non-interference right. I’m not convinced, however, that a general non-interference right requires we deeply understand the metaphysics behind intellectual objects. Most of the objections I’ve raised just don’t matter if we aren’t thinking about private IP rights. Essentially, a non-interference right seems far easier to justify and doesn’t seem to require nearly as detailed an ontic story as private IP rights.

Lastly, while I’ve insisted on a non-interference right, it is certainly possible I’m wrong, or that I’ve overlooked some important exceptions. Perhaps I need to take a step back, since there may be unorthodox cases in which intellectual objects can be privately owned, even if not acquired via labor-mixing. The reasons for the possible private IP rights, however, aren’t based on Lockean grounds (although these reasons may be compatible with Lockean thought). Again, these unorthodox cases aren’t usually thought of as being IP rights, but if an IP right is simply a right to an intellectual object, then perhaps these unorthodox cases count.

In taking a step back from my blanket claim of a non-interference right to intellectual objects, I am also going to push back against an overly narrow understanding of IP rights. Just as a non-interference right might not normally be considered a genuine IP right, the exceptional domains for private IP rights which I have in mind are not usually considered genuine IP domains.
 
Perhaps there are certain intellectual objects which no one should use. Consider a doomsday device which can destroy the universe. Maybe that is the sort of intellectual object for which no one should build physical manifestations or even schematics. Presumably, we all are morally restricted from using that intellectual object in some ways. At least on some moral theories (which quasi-Lockeans may accept), we might say that my obligation, in this case, corresponds to a claim right each other person has against me not to use the doomsday intellectual object in certain ways (for example, it may violate their self-ownership rights). That seems to be a very specific bundle of ownership rights to the intellectual object, and it seems to be an exception to a non-interference right.

Maybe only governments and their officials have certain ownership rights to intellectual objects for nuclear weapons. Perhaps nobody except vetted librarians and scientists (for the sake of knowledge alone) should use intellectual objects concerning smallpox. These might be instances of private property rights to intellectual objects, albeit these rights are acquired in odd ways. 

We might interpret certain kinds of personal privacy rights in terms of IP rights. If I had a moral right to have my medical information not used in certain ways by others, then maybe I have a particular kind of IP right. My private data or private intellectual objects are really mine, no matter which server they live on or the paper on which they are recorded. 

Perhaps even censorship, duties against child pornography, and plagiarism can be understood as unique strains of IP rights, even if they aren’t justified via labor-mixing acquisition. This expansion of what it means to have some bundle of ownership rights to intellectual objects isn’t well explored. So many rights and obligations we wouldn’t normally think of as IP rights may actually be IP rights. Depending on how we define property rights, and how we flesh out our various obligations and rights, it is possible that some private IP rights exist.<<ref "41">>

There may be some moral limitations to how intellectual objects can be used, accessed, or controlled, based on claim rights of specific agents, governments, or corporate entities. If there are cases of private bundles of ownership rights to intellectual objects, they don’t seem to be due to any sort of labor-mixing acquisition. These rights are likely justified on other moral grounds. I’m not defending the claim that there are any private IP rights. Assuming the metaphysical framework/story can be structured clearly and reasonably, however, I’m certainly open to the possibility.

In any case, these possible exceptions seem to neither demonstrate the viability of the standard quasi-Lockean IP theory, nor interfere with the claim that we all generally have a prima facie non-interference right to use and access intellectual objects. I’ve agreed to the possibility of IP rights, but they are justified on other grounds – specifically, non-labor-mixing grounds. From what I can tell, Lockean IP theorists have yet to offer a potent ontic and conceptual tale which would convince us that there are limits on our freedom of use and access to almost all intellectual objects.

!!! ''Conclusion''

Perhaps we can accept some version of the unextended quasi-Lockean theory for physical property rights. There’s just something about chopping down an unowned tree and building chairs you subsequently come to own which is just common sense.<<ref "42">> I don’t see, however, why we should accept the quasi-Lockean IP extension. The standard Lockean IP theory has too many unexplained, and perhaps unexplainable, challenges. We might be able to justify moral, private IP rights connected to intellectual labor via utilitarian or Hegelian accounts, but I don’t see how an exclusively Lockean account can succeed at this particular goal. 

Essentially, I don’t think the quasi-Lockean IP theory should be used to justify the status quo of IP rights (or anything like it). It’s more plausible to think we have a non-interference right to use and access intellectual objects, perhaps with some exceptions for other moral requirements.
