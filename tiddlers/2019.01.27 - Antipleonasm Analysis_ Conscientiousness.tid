title: 2019.01.27 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Conscientiousness

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
There is only one way to achieve happiness on this terrestrial ball, and that is to have either a clear conscience or none at all
<<<

It is fascinating to see how the Big5 personality trait has converted this notion into goal-directed, organized, non-impulsive, consequentialist reasoning. This quote isn't talking about the mere quantitative aspects of having a conscience; it's clearly talking about the qualitative. Indeed, if you ever cross someone's sociopath, you'll know they can be extremely Big5-conscientious. How else can they use you like a tool and play you like a fool?

I love this quote. It aims to define happiness as not mere hedonic pleasure. It shows that moral resentment and contentment are meaningful eudaimonic notions. I suggest it is vital that we also recognize how this is only a necessary condition even if it's insufficient.

Also, pro-tip: if you jump in the air, in that brief moment, you might not be "on this terrestrial ball" (depends on how you define it). Maybe you just need stay airborn. This quote is delightfully practical about our [[fff]] nature. I don't mind the black and white dialectic either. Even if it's too extreme, it appears close to the correct answer. I suggest happiness can come in degrees (and not just kinds).
