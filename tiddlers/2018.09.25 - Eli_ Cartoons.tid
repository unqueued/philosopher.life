Hey Eli,

I'm glad to see your response. You give me plenty to think about. 

Speaking of: I liked your fly agaric mushroom picture. I think mushrooms are fascinating creatures. I've never actually tried that species in part because you have to forage for them (since they can't be easily grown). Even with the opportunity though, I don't like getting sick (I mean, who does?), and I've not read enough to know if the psychoactive properties can be extracted to eliminate nausea. I used to grow psilocybe cubensis, but from what I understand, these different mushrooms do not offer similar experiences.

To h0p3,

Sorry for the delayed response! I've been swamped. I'm going to respond in chunks:

Don't worry about it! Writing letters is a luxury, and I take us to be writing when we can. Hopefully your swamp has been the good kind!

I appreciate your chunking. That's the way I like to do it too. I think it gives us a chance to pick and weave threads into a coherent fabric.

> Your post on Adventure Time made me smile. I'm not sure what it is, but cartoons tend to be among my favorite style/kinds of shows; they're consistently worth rewatching to me.

I love cartoons, animation, and comics. I agree that they are worth re-watching. I've been slowly working to catch up on ''Adventure Time'', and am looking forward to doing the same with ''Steven Universe''. I recently re-watched much of ''Batman: The Animated Series'', I was shocked with how well it held up. It is a remarkable show.
<<<

Me too! I basically can't fall asleep anymore without a cartoon I'm intimately familiar with. An earbud, no visual, and I can eventually drift off. We're watching these [[TV: Library]] to build some common stories in the family (huge linguistic shortcuts). Venture Bros, Archer, Rick and Morty, and [China, Il] are shows I consistently rewatch and fall asleep to.

I've never seen //Steven Universe//. I know nothing about it, but it looks interesting. I've grabbed the first season, and I'll try it with the kids tonight. I really like watching with them because we get to talk about it. We've developed this habit of pausing shows to talk about them.<<ref "g">> One of my favorite parts of cartoons is how they enable me to suspend my disbelief (which I can be downright awful at). Comedy opens me up too, and cartoons often pack a humorous punch. Animation sometimes get to tell it like is when other formats don't or can't.

Comics are something I enjoyed as a kid but unfortunately stopped reading for a long time (oops!). I don't really understand the difference between a graphic novel and a comic (so you might not think this counts), but I've been picking a few of them these past couple years. I adore a series called [[Saga|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_(comics)]].<<ref "s">>

//Batman: The Animated Series// was very good! Or, I have fond memories of it, but I actually don't remember the show anymore (my memory can be pretty awful). I hate to say it, but I'm scared to watch it again these many years later. Batman was an important figure to me (the movies and comics as well). I fear one of my hero characters is not going to live up to my adult scrutiny (//The Dark Knight Rises// pissed me off). Lots of things have bugged me about the character over the years, and now I'm stuck. This is a comic about a cartoon (and more):

Maybe I need to sack up and just watch it again. I fear this thing I loved, this part of who I was, has been a lie that will disintegrate if I take a hard look again.

> I am curious about your Song as wiki claim. I love Music and wikis, but I fear I'm missing your point.

I think my post may have made it sound more philosophical than intended. It was more of a comment on form, than anything else. I've been listening to a lot of music which heavily feature sampling other songs. I've been listening to one song, and then listening to as many of the songs the initial song sampled as I can find.
<<<

That's neat. It sounds like a cool way to explore music. I imagine it takes some work to find what samples are used. I wonder if you have any chains in your graph of songs that sample other songs that sample other songs, etc. I'm still trying to figure out what I'm doing on this front. I've relied upon Pandora and accidentally picking up music for a long time. I wish I had a better curation/recommendation process. None of the tools I've tried seem to do a good job.

> I am sorry I frightened you. You are right: people are unpredictable. I appreciate your willingness to watch, think, and speak again. I've clearly been wrong about you. I'm sorry.

No apologies necessary, but thank you kindly. It is much appreciated.

> Anarchism is a word like Liberal in that it has many definitions. What do you mean by anarchism? When you are an anarchist, what kind are you? When you aren't, what are you, and why?

Anarchism is most certainly a word with a more solid definition than I invoke when I use it. I agree with the two flavors you described, but I think my use of the word may be sloppy.

I appreciate your asking me more specifically what I mean by anarchism. I've been thinking about it.

I guess it boils down to, I believe that if people in general were "good" (that is itself a hairy subject) then we could all be trusted to do our own good, with and for each other.

…I preemptively apologies for my sloppiness here. I'll continue to think on this.
<<<

I hear that. I appreciate your willingness to keep thinking about it. 

<<<
Biopower.

I must admit I am by no means an expert — you seem to know much more than I. I brought it up because I've been thinking about it in the context of the internet, and gatekeepers to the internet. How this power effects folks, and is wielded.

I'll do some more work here, though, and keep thinking it through.

More soon,

Sincerely,

Eli

Biopower appears to be a good conversation starter and language for describing the issue; the problems are so large that it's like climbing a couple mountains before we can even begin see what the real challenge is. The complexity of computing is too abstract, lacking that tactile concrete brick'n'mortar feel that forces one to confront the beast engulfing us. I don't know how to stop the gatekeepers, but I'm trying to find it. 

I definitely feel an affinity with the Indieweb movement (not sure I agree on everything, but that's cool), and often I think they point to one of many possible requirements necessary for solving the larger problem; your site is a clean example. I'm grateful that you are thinking more about it (there aren't enough of us doing so, imho), and I will be interested to know your findings. I feel like a failure on this topic here; I can barely convince my own family and friends to take this challenge seriously. I feel like we're frogs being slowly boiled alive. 

Sincerely,

h0p3
