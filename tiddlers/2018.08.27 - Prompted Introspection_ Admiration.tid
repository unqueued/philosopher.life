title: 2018.08.27 - Prompted Introspection: Admiration

//Whoops!//

!! What trait did you admire in a relative, friend, classmate, or coworker today?

My son's willingness to be wrong and try anyways. Sometimes that boy is fearless in the face of humiliation because he knows it's the right thing to do. I adore how hard he tries to communicate, which is difficult for an autist who didn't begin speaking until he was 4. I feel like he has a non-trivial understanding of his limitations and self-awareness well beyond his age. I love his effort, especially when it's painful; it makes me proud and shames me at the same time. I hope to live up to that standard.
