title: Introducing Baudrillard: A Graphic Guide

It's interesting when the professor is so different in writing than in person. I assume it really depended on who you were to the man. If you were his brother and confidant, he probably sounded like his writing to you. In broader realtime dialectics, he was more reserved, uncertain, and paranoic. That sounds normal to me.

Fair criticism of Sartre to me, lol. Does seem superhuman. Still, not sure what else we can do. I've heard Baudrillard is a pile of shit too. =)

---

I don't see how we can escape categorizing culture. You must attempt to say something constructive and structured in order to get at the ineffable inside or out. Oh, I realize there are cultures which abuse that tooling (maybe all do); call Reason a necessary evil if you must. 

---

The sorcery of the spectacle is [the result or is constitutive?] of the relationships of people mediated by images. Kant is buttfucking us hard right here. What isn't an image if we never have access to the things-in-themselves? What doesn't count as spectacle? I aim to push for speculative realism here.

Yeah, collector regressing to fill in his incompleteness. Reasonable psychoanalysis to me. I don't think objects absorb cultural anxiety though; I think we are simply aware of how they make us anxious in cases where we want to say they absorb. I agree that "what man lacks is always invested in the object" is not only a problem in capitalism but perhaps agency within The Dialectic.

Consumer freedom means freedom to regress and be irrational

Preach, yo! I cannot fucking stand it. I agree you have the right to be gibberish for a bit, but I don't think in general. 

Weird to associate pleasure with duty rather than enjoyment. But, if you deny moral realism (cmon, he does), then "fun morality" is going to have that "duty" attached. 

Logic of the Consumer Object:

# Functional logic of use value (hammer hits nail, instrument)
# Economic logic of exchange value (exchanging the hammer for money as commodity)
# Logic of symbolic exchange (wedding ring)
# Logic of sign exchange value (fashion systems)

I see no reason to immediately buy the claim that symbolic exchange is opposed to abstraction of economic and sign exchange, as though it were open-ended and didn't accumulate meanings, or profits, or alienate, or split people from their identity, or eliminate their social place by inserting them into systems of objects. Why should I think that? Symbolic markets are quite real.

I'm glad he changes his mind and agrees that signs can be an accomplice of capitalism. I think he fills in some gaps in speaking of ideology as a dialectical market. One of my worries is that he will reduce is all to mere simulated market without making any room for objective meaning. In a way, his point of view still appears reductive into anti-realism. 

The Kantian worry rears it's ugly head here too. Tell me what isn't a sign in my [[phenomenology]], please? It is here that I put my foot down and will not claim it is all an illusion. This is a gap I'm afraid Baudrillard might not fill or recognize correctly. He is after social dynamics, but there is a deeper epistemology problem I'm after.

---

It's interesting to hear that reality colludes with signs, that signs allude to reality but excludes it. He must still answer me: what isn't a sign? This is a strong realpolitik work, but it appears (:P) philosophically weak in the general ontology/epistemology problem. It is also possible the author simply isn't careful enough with their words.

---

I agree the "meaning of meaning is infinite implication." Instead of dispensing with metaphysics into vacuous internalism though, I take it to be the structure of Platonic F-ness. [[The Foundation]] does not reside in me because I'm finite, and hence I think Derrida and Baudrillard are going to have to dispense with objective meaning (and I think they do). Of course, they don't get to help themselves to their own theories in the end (though they may argue for a hermeneutic circle or a Wittgensteinian ladder). 

Note that "meaning of meaning" is semantics of semantics. The indefinite referral of signifier to signifier may not exactly be that, but in any case, the solution is to accept actual metaphysics rather deny it. More importantly, however, I just don't see why "even signs must burn" on my position, and I don't know what it means to sign it from your position either Baudrillard. 

---

I agree culture is the production and consumption of signs, or at least some ridiculous percentage of it. Freedom and responsibility are in there. Our Hegelian identities in the dialectic not going to be easy to pin down, imho.

<<<
Culture is no longer a "living body", the presence of a collectivity (religion, feasts, storytelling) producing signs. Now signs produce cultures.
<<<

Either it never was a living body, or it still is. Your [[phenomenology]] is filled with signs. Your choices produce signs. I agree to a paranoic view of most homo sapiens and memeplex evolution in our species; deceptive reference, spoofing, and an unwillingness to be accountable to foundations of meaning result in a lot of computers computing garbage.

Baudrillard criticizes everything except some Romantic notion he conveniently can't pin down. He's a quintessential postmodern even in his destruction of other postmoderns. Everything is a mirror, a reference, a means; all systems of thoughts are exploitative illusions. Homie's a hater. Lurv it. Note, of course, he still can't define [[W5H]] any end, meme, production, or cultural artifact is authentic, genuine, or meaningful. It appears his own his system targets his own system even if he acts like it doesn't. Standard pomo hypocrisy.

Regardless, I'm enjoying the ultra paranoic evolution of his thought. He takes the notion of exploitation super cereal, at least for a while.

---

Baudrillard's antihumanism seems incoherent. His attack on feminism made no sense. He's obviously [[redpill]]ed in some respects, and he appreciates the market of signs. I don't see how he ever has anything objective though, and hence, I don't see why his entire theory can have merit in itself.

---

It's fine sociology and cultural criticism. I think I could get along until hit hopeless turn into pure cynicism where he becomes simply an observer waiting to die. 

He is the high priest of postmodernism. He's reduced the world to material, internalism, and relativism. This book is worth another read.
