title: 2019.11.16 - Prompted Introspection: Prejudice

!! What are some examples of prejudice?

I do a fine job in: [[2018.04.24 - Prompted Introspection Log: Examples of Prejudice]]. 

Priors are necessary to empiricism, including rationalist structural ingredients necessary for being Daseinic. We are constantly making judgments. That's what we are doing in picking out what is [[salient]]; it's intentionality, the telic process which is our plight. Prejudice is necessary. There are limits to how much we can change our prejudice, and we are obligated to take corrective steps (as a trite, oversimplified example: double-blind auditions for musicians). We compute with our {[[axioms]]} in the [[hope]]s of not only fleshing them out, but coherentifying, and testing for more [[salient]] options. It's an [[infinigress]]ive bullet we must all bite, a leap of [[faith]] in our autonomy.
