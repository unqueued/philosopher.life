title: 2019.01.05 - Prompted Introspection: Confidence

!! What gives you confidence and why?

I will upfront say there is a difference between what should give me confidence and what in fact does. I would argue I give myself confidence through empirical, Bayesian, externalist, probabilistic inferences. I would like to think that I find a semblance of reason in context, that justification is the root of my confidence. Time and time again I have confidently proven my previous confidence wrong. It is my plight.
