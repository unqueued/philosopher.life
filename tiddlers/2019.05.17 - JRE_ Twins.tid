We talked about his work and dealing with co-workers. I complimented him on the way in which he bends over backward to be fair to those over whom he has power. He brought up the difference between my responses and our donors' responses to his explanations. Obviously, I don't think they have his interests at heart, nor do I think they aim to have a charitable interpretation of him. They don't have any intention of being honest either or being willing to wrestle about the matter, nor do they attempt to evaluate it afterward in a meaningful or objective sense (they seem to confabulate events conveniently). 

My brother is having more pain in his shoulders and back. His rehab is helping, but it sounds like it's going to take some time. 

The meds aren't working as well, but no restless leg syndrome. He sees the doctor on the 28th. Good! I'm hoping he continues to press to find the best solution he can.

They were offered twins which they aren't licensed to care for. I'm glad they turned it down. I don't know how much time my brother has before he has a child.

My brother is worried about not doing any more woodworking, and we talked about changes to my [[TDL]] approach.

My son and my brother have been talking recently. That's awesome. I hope it continues.
