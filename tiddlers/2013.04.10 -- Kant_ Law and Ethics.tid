title: 2013.04.10 -- Kant: Law and Ethics

Rights and coercion are fascinating topics because they rest upon whatever (if any) gap there is between justice and morality. I’m still unsure how Kant generally characterizes the relationship between political normativity and moral normativity (are they unified? Is one a subset of the other? Are they completely separate realms?). It seems to me that Kant would need everything else to be dependent upon the CI, after all, it is the supreme principle.

Oddly, Kant has such a narrow view of what counts as freedom, it seems to me that even systematic manipulation, as long as it has certain results, should not be a problem for him (it might even be recommended by the CI – it is difficult to tell).

Metaphysics of Morals (pp. 6:229-239, 306-314)


6:230 – “Right is the sum of conditions under which the choice of one can be united with the choice of another in accordance with universal law of freedom.”


6:231 – Authorized coercion of those who infringe upon…??


6:232 – “When it is said that a creditor has a right to require his debtor to pay his debt, this does not mean that he can remind the debtor that his reason itself puts him under obligation to perform this; it means, instead, that coercion which constrains everyone to pay his debts can coexist with the freedom of everyone, including that of debtors, in accordance with a universal external law.” But, I thought a right was about “reminding” someone of their obligation, as you explained in class?


6:234 – Distinction between equity (right without coercion) and right of necessity (coercion without a right).


6:234 – In the Jointly owned trading company example, Kant is saying that judges without data won’t rule in favor of increased profits for the harder working partner. He is saying that with data, equity requires the judge to rule in favor of it though, right?





‘Toward Perpetual Peace’ (pp. 8:365-7)





Seel: ‘How Does Kant Justify the Universal Objective Validity of the Law of Right?’


Considers a “strong correspondence between” rights and duties, where rights are an entitled to authorized coercion, limiting others to their duties.


Freedom (independence from external sources, such as another’s choice) is the only original right of persons.


Does he justify this?


Seel argues that the “doctrine of right is dependent on the Categorical Imperative concerning the universal validity of the fundamental law it sets forth.” (76)
