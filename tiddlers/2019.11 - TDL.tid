!! Audit:

* It has some journal content in it, no doubt.
* I did not get laid nearly as much I hoped/planned.
* There's plenty of [[Calendar]] work here (which is what it ought to be).
* Meal-planning has been relaxed, but it's not been more stressful.
** Yet*?
* House is partially set to go. I'm excited by that.
** I'm glad we've been doing it piecemeal.
* The break was excellent. 
* We've had a lot of social gatherings.
** Sad to see [[R]] and [[CH]] do not have time despite a 3-month window. 
*** The political divide grows. 
*** I think I'm going to stop talking as much about it because I think it only brings pain. I'm the keeper of the record in case the truth is ever in dispute.
* It's been difficult piecing together the move given the unknowns.
* I like the way we do groceries. Asking if we can wait one more day or so makes sure nothing goes to waste.
** EZ-mode stoic practice too. We are not always so lucky to have plenty.
* You've had a lot of transitions this month. It's only going to speed up and go berserk for the next two.
* You aren't exercising enough. You need to push so you won't be sore. 
* Also, you need to burn the remaining cannabutter. 2 Ounces lasted you 4 years (including giving plenty away). Rather not see it wasted. Would be surprised if you have 7 hits left.
* You have to call [[Charlie]] earlier. He's not picking up for almost anyone, but he said you'd be more likely to succeed. 
* JSON project hitting a snag in Xonsh. 
* Lots of juggling and weighing in here.
* Oh, I like that "I challenge you" line. =) 
** I challenge you to challenge yourself explicitly...
