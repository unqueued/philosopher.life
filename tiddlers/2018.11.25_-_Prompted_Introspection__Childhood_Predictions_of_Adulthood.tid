title: 2018.11.25 - Prompted Introspection: Childhood Predictions of Adulthood

!! When you were a child, how did you imagine your adult life? How is it similar or different to what you imagined?

I thought I'd be a scientist, mathematician, or a prophet. Close enough.

Being so gaslit, purposely kept ignorant of myself and the world, never having understood I was autistic, being raised in poverty, and being trained to see the world through a Capitalist's lens: I thought life would turn out much better than it has. The [[Redpills]] have been quite painful. Disillusionment is hard work; understanding what is real and actually possible is difficult when you've been conditioned so strongly against it (especially when those who ought to support you are actively working against it).

I didn't predict I'd be in so much pain.
