title: 2019.09.22 - TDL: Don't Fuck Up

* Keep working for your public children. Make it count. You don't know how much time you have left with them.
* Your offspring are failing dramatically. We can have great discussions, but the results are not there. This is in no small part your fault.
* Roast, veggies
* Remember, you get 2 hours with WoW. Don't fuck it up.
* A bit of cleaning would be nice.
