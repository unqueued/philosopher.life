title: 2019.11.29 - Computer Musings: Bob Update

None of the computers liked me today.

#Tried to update Bob
#*Website did not update
#*It ended up eating New/Recent
#Fixed the folder
##Stop the sync
##Take a previous copy of Bob
##Rename it/remove the previous
##Set Resilio to target that folder
#Imported today's tiddlers
#*For some reason, the dates were all over the place
