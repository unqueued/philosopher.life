title: 2019.02.05 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Support Our Troops

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The point of public relations slogans like “Support our troops” is that they don’t mean anything… That’s the whole point of good propaganda. You want to create a slogan that nobody’s going to be against, and everybody’s going to be for. Nobody knows what it means, because it doesn’t mean anything. Its crucial value is that it diverts your attention from a question that does mean something: Do you support our policy? That’s the one you’re not allowed to talk about.

Preach, yo! I've been a fan for almost two decades now, and I'm going to continue my nuthuggin' and dickridin' here. Rhetoric will always be susceptible to this abuse. Yes, we have yet another example concerned with information power centralization. 

This meaningfully meaningless rhetorical device perpetuates itself as a memetic weapon in neutralizing dissent in personal dialectics, and those who have no interest in the truth will parrot whatever is necessary for feeling like they've won the argument. It's about silencing opposition through whatever means are necessary (rather than the fairness of philosophical argumentation), and that includes treating others as mere means. There are a number of different kinds of immoral behaviors which surround this slogan.

The slogan is pure bootlicking. I've always fucking hated it, and I've often been punished for even kind articulations of my problems with it.
