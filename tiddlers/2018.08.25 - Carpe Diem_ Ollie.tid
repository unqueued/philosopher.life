title: 2018.08.25 - Carpe Diem: Ollie

* Woke at 9ish?
* Inform the Men!
** A fart caused a riot.
* Shower of the Gods!
* Read+Write
* Went shopping for groceries
* Before we threw away the messed up skateboard we found, I performed some ollies and a threw a kickflip for my wife. She was truly unimpressed by muh skater skills. Apparently, overweight 33-old men can't be cool? Lol.
** My fucking tendon cannot take that much punishment, let alone my decades long Osgood-Schlatter.
* Walked with wife
** Le QTÏ€ continues to walk when we do. I think I am somehow more embarrassed than my wife (although, I will summon the courage).
* Pizza and fruit
* Read+Write
* Talked with ALM
* Called JRE, Charlie, MB, and T-Money Moore?!
* Read+Write
* Pizza
* McCain is dead. I threw a tiny party; I'm happy to see that two-faced piece of shit is dead.
** Not actually a party like we threw for Scalia's demise.
* Fireman Time!
* Bed by 1:30
