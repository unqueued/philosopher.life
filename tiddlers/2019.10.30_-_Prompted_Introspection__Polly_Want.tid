!! What kind of animal would you like to be and why?

//Like// to be. Okay.

A mutated Daseinic long-lived bird with Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder, Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory, Quasi-Williams Syndrome, and the most permissive, ridiculously wealthy, and protective owner who paid for tutors, an unlimited next-level-birdcrack button which allows me to trigger the experience of The Sublime at-will, and a custom machine to allow me to talk straight into and with a computer (and I'd like some secondary vision interface tool injected straight into muh brain), probably contained in VR simulated on a self-healing wetwear computer. I'd have chosen a pig, but they seem more likely to die, and I'd be disappointing too many Saints with my choice, of course.
