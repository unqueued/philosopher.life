title: McManus: It’s Nostalgia That’s Driving Modern Politics

https://merionwest.com/2018/09/10/its-nostalgia-thats-driving-modern-politics/

<<<
Nostalgia for the past has long been a powerful political emotion.
<<<

It's worth looking into the physiological basis of nostalgia as well. You will find our memories are sculpted as we age, stripped of many kinds of memories, and the past begins to look better and better. There are also particular ages that we simply have stronger memories of than any other points in our lives (also nicely connected to nostalgia phenomenologically).

Confabulation is a very serious problem. We cannot trust our memories for this reason as well. This is one of the reasons I use my wiki so obsessively. History will always be a fertile ground for manipulative storytelling.

<<<
Individuals on the far left have also expressed nostalgia for the politics of the past. 
<<<

I'm glad I don't have to call you out on it. =)

<<<
There is the current surge of 80’s fascination present in pop culture milestones like Stranger Things or the blockbuster IT, the prominence of vaporwave (a musical style characterized by remixing pop hits of the past), and the return to blatant sentimentalism in television and literature.
<<<

Oh, I think I see your previous comment about my wiki's style in context now. I'd say I'm just now the age to really start having nostalgia, but I'm pretty convinced every generation has committed this crime about as much as mine does (it might also just be more blatant to me directly because I'm experiencing it). I suggest distinguishing the "rise of nostalgia" from the obviousness of nostalgia in contemporary culture (and the rates of each) is an undecided empirical matter. Yes, I do cling to what I love. I wouldn't say this is mere sentimentalism. I suggest several aspects of my wiki are bleeding edge; to my knowledge, there is no personal wiki in the world anything like mine. I've tried to maintain what I think is valuable while making progress.

Capitalism is what is left when beliefs have collapsed at the level of ritual or symbolic elaboration, and all that is left is the consumer-spectator, trudging through the ruins and the relics.”
<<<

Now you must accuse me of this biased lense, please. I am actually convinced psychological egoism has always accurately described the vast majority of the ~100 billion human specimens to have walked this planet (and, yes, I think even most cooperation is best explained on these grounds). I am not convinced the above quote only applies today at all! I have very serious doubts about most human societies through history here.

Let me remind you that I think the description of humankind isn't our prescription.

It seems that capitalism builds its own ritual and symbolic elaborations, but for some (but not all) of us, these are false idols. Unfortunately, I think most rituals and symbols have been utter bullshit. Finding what really matters is no easy task.

 This is why Fredric Jameson argues that the predominant aesthetic style in post-modern culture is a nostalgic “pastiche.” 
<<<

This is tendancy I suggest: pomo denies authenticity and causes us to reminisce (and build in virtue of this emotion) for a time when we still felt like the world was real. It is as though we are either being ironic in our art or wishing we were somehow ignorant and living in a different experience machine.

<<<
In a Hegelian sense, we are left without something to define ourselves against, and so we become indefinite ourselves. 
<<<

Wait, why should I agree we don't have something to define ourselves against? I love a lot of the moves you are making, so perhaps I'm missing your point.

Postmodernism is my enemy, it is depersonalizing, derealizing, deuniversalizing, denarrativizing...I can feel the incoherence course through my veins, and that's exactly what I'm attempting to surgically remove and respond to in this wiki. I'm here to fight meaninglessness. Somehow there is a reality to the privation of [[The Good]]. That is my enemy.

<<<
The danger of political nostalgia according to this lesson is we risk fetishizing the past and not recognizing that it, like our own time, was characterized by major problems.
<<<

Good. Preach.
