!! Audit:

* Overall, the children have been significantly happier this month. That is not nothing.
* My children didn't try harder. They have to figure it out. =(
* Drugs clearly helped me. 
* I'm so glad the itchiness is basically gone. 
** Coconut oil is preventative!
* I didn't accomplish as many of my goals as I usually do. It's been a crazy month, of course.
** We all screwed up a bunch here.
* Kids feel better, the adults do not.
* Compliments are "thank you" heavy.
* I must say, I feel like my children are still recovering from a whirlwind of a year. Give it time.
* My wife has been plagued by staffing problems and bureaucracy.
* Perhaps gaming is a bad idea? I don't know.
* Our financial position has improved tremendously.
** I would like to thank my father-in-law and my brother JRE.
