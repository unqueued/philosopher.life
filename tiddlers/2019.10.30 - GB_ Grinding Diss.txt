Hey man. Been busy. Putting in 6-7 hours a day on the diss, 7 days a week

Days are good. Trying to keep my head down and just work, not think about other things. How are you doing?

Sounds like a heckuva grind. Sounds like a good approach.

I've long thought I was destined to be a janitor. Might go that route as well.
WED 4:22 PM
But, nothing up front for me until we can settle in.

You're not destined to be a janitor. I think you're a teacher. Or a hacker lol

If you're a janitor, you're Good Will Hunting
