How's the weekend going for ya?
Nov 3, 2019 11:54am
This is a dumb question, but do you think I should join Facebook? In a way, I miss out on a number of models of people.
Nov 3, 2019 12:58pm
Who are you and what have you done with [[h0p3]]? üòÇ
Nov 3, 2019 12:59pm
Lol! =)
Nov 3, 2019 1:00pm
Zuckerberg is that you?
Nov 3, 2019 1:00pm
I‚Äôm having a good, albeit busy weekend. Business as usual. 

I would love to be Facebook friends with you. You only need to put up what you‚Äôre comfortable with.
Nov 3, 2019 1:00pm
Since I‚Äôm pursuing a career in writing, that will require me to live in the public eye, so I‚Äôve embraced social media as a necessary evil.
Nov 3, 2019 1:01pm
Plus if my enemies truly wants to spy on me, then they can do so via other avenues just as easily as FB.
Nov 3, 2019 1:02pm
Lol
Nov 3, 2019 1:02pm
I still think my paranoia is all-too-often rational on this one, but I've little to lose on this front.
Nov 3, 2019 1:03pm
Plus you can see all my Minion memes üòÇ
Nov 3, 2019 1:04pm
Yes- I would love to connect with you on Facebook in addition to Signal and Discord. :)
Nov 3, 2019 1:05pm
I think I've embraced social media pretty radically too. Someone who wants to get to know me and participate in my life has a dope vehicle to do so in my wiki (though it is disorienting at first). But, yeah, I've certainly not embraced most kinds of corporatized social media. Like, I consider it my moral right to ask for similar social practices, but I recognize FB and other tooling lower the friction for you.
Nov 3, 2019 1:05pm
Huh. I never thought of your wiki as a form of social media... but you‚Äôre right.
Nov 3, 2019 1:07pm
It‚Äôs just served up a little
Bit differently!
Nov 3, 2019 1:07pm
Aye. It's radically freedom-respecting.
Nov 3, 2019 1:07pm
About owning our data, the way in which we craft our words, the structures of the stories we tell ourselves and others. There is autonomy in the practice because I'm not forced to play against some corporations feed algorithm, I get to choose how I will box myself in (rather than being forced to use the constrained and commodifying boxes they require), and I own the process of building the process.
Nov 3, 2019 1:09pm
I'm a huge fan of personal sites that are as personal as it gets, something which was still pretty big when you were first born. 
Nov 3, 2019 1:09pm
I realize that you have to worry about optics. Your image, brand, presence, etc. are going to be important. I don't deny it.
Nov 3, 2019 1:10pm
So, it makes sense to me why you use the channels you do. Even [[k0sh3k]] has a FB account simply because it's required for communicating with her co-workers.
Nov 3, 2019 1:10pm
Actually the other day I was thinking about websites. The first time I was given a presentation on them I was like...7! And it was at school haha
Nov 3, 2019 1:11pm
Yeah, I‚Äôve given up on the dream of unifying all my communication channels. Instead I‚Äôve developed a system to bounce between them almost seamlessly.
Nov 3, 2019 1:11pm
That reminds me, sorry I‚Äôve been quieter recently. My resolve to do my daily good mornings has waned in month 11. Coupled with commuting to school and the final semester workload it‚Äôs been harder.
Nov 3, 2019 1:12pm
I‚Äôm going to try to finish strong though with all of those aspects.
Nov 3, 2019 1:12pm
Nothing to be sorry about. [[K]], you are obviously one of my best friends, and I know you've been busy. There aren't many people who so consistently listen and speak with me (however insane and grotesquely Joker I may be). At some point, it's a honor that you do so.
Nov 3, 2019 1:14pm
‚ù§Ô∏è
Since we have this moment to speak, what‚Äôs new with you guys? I bet [[k0sh3k]]‚Äôs exciting job news has things in a crazy flux for you all
Nov 3, 2019 1:15pm
I‚Äôm currently working on my old English translations (my classmates are little bitches that complained about Beowulf being too hard so we‚Äôre doing The Battle of Maldon now)
Nov 3, 2019 1:16pm
You should try to do some Beowolf anyway. Fuck 'em. 
Nov 3, 2019 1:16pm
Hahahaha
Nov 3, 2019 1:17pm
Fortunately we did the whole battle with Grendel before we switched.
Nov 3, 2019 1:17pm
You might check out that Grendel book, btw. Short, neat.
Nov 3, 2019 1:18pm
Yeah, we're piecing it together. I don't know how smooth the transition will be. I've put in my two weeks (or however). [[k0sh3k]]'s soon-to-be ex-library is in a lot of trouble without her.
Nov 3, 2019 1:18pm
She runs that place, and she's the best they've ever had (by their own admission). 
Nov 3, 2019 1:18pm
Looking for a replacement to pass institutional knowledge and distribute her workload across what remains. May be a hiring freeze in the library given how the humanities continues to be under radical attack at the school transforming itself into a diploma mill.
Nov 3, 2019 1:19pm
Working on trying to attend the cabin vacay. It's right on the line for us, since [[k0sh3k]] starts work 5 days later. So, we'd have to move immediately after the trip. Lots to do.
Nov 3, 2019 1:21pm
That sucks. But it‚Äôs cathartic to know that your work made a huge difference on our department. [[k0sh3k]] will certainly be missed there.
Nov 3, 2019 1:21pm
Yeah! If it works cool. If not that‚Äôs okay too. Life changes take priority over vacation. :)
Nov 3, 2019 1:22pm
Wow I didn‚Äôt notice those typos haha. What I mean is that [[k0sh3k]] did a good job.
Nov 3, 2019 1:31pm
Hey. Have a great day :)
Nov 4, 2019 9:35am
Yo, you too ;P
Nov 4, 2019 9:35am
Got any cool plans today?
Nov 4, 2019 9:36am
I have a great deal to finish in my wiki. I've got work. School with the offspring.
Nov 4, 2019 9:47am
Thinking about how our move is going to go.
Nov 4, 2019 9:48am
Noice. I have one final book to read for this semester then I can shift gears to my myriad of papers.
Nov 4, 2019 9:48am
Yeah moving is stressful.
Nov 4, 2019 9:48am
Haha
Nov 4, 2019 9:48am
You are so close to the end.
Nov 4, 2019 9:49am
You have a good date with [[L]]?
Nov 4, 2019 9:55am
It‚Äôs both emotionally satisfying and absolutely terrifying.
Nov 4, 2019 9:50am
It was good. She‚Äôs horribly stressed out and I just want her to feel better. Once her big work event is over on Wednesday she should start to be much happier.
Nov 4, 2019 9:57am
I think our date helped a little bit. At least I‚Äôd like to think so.
Nov 4, 2019 9:58am
Good!
Nov 4, 2019 9:58am
Have you read (or played) I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream?
Nov 4, 2019 1:09pm
[[L]] and I echoed an analysis video on the text yesterday and she remarked that it sounded like something you might like.
Nov 4, 2019 1:10pm
Watched** wow that autocorrect.
Nov 4, 2019 1:10pm
Didn't know it was a game.
Nov 4, 2019 1:13pm
Never read it, only heard of bits.
Nov 4, 2019 1:13pm
Sounds fucked up, lol.
Nov 4, 2019 1:14pm
I haven‚Äôt read it either, but I‚Äôve watched gameplay and heard a lot about the story. Apparently the short story is relatively....well short. I might actually read it.
Nov 4, 2019 1:15pm
Partially reminds me of: https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk
Nov 4, 2019 1:18pm
I very much liked that //Ex Machina// movie. 
Nov 4, 2019 1:19pm
You‚Äôve doomed us both. Hahahaha
Nov 4, 2019 1:20pm
That‚Äôs an interesting thought for sure.
