title: Business Cards

My daughter helped me make them today. The front looks absolutely fucking sick (thank you, dear). I've never seen a QR code like it before, and the color gradient was a nice touch (we tested it quite a bit against our screens at size). We put some thought into it. I think they look great (ofc I would!). 

Rounded corners, 19 pt super, "soft touch" (matte).

Front:

Pseudonymized Back:

I have another set with my other information which doesn't include any of the crypto. Besides the font and background, the only thing in common really is the title at the top and the "Site." It looks very clean.

The Pseudonymized back is cluttered, but I think it's a worth price. I considered QRing it as well. I chose just the BTC (no ETH, despite my belief in ETH in the long//er// run), and perhaps should not even have that. It's a swiss army knife of crypto there. I'll give that card when I prefer not to give my name IRL.

The font is not narrow. I still prefer the thin width on the wiki. I really do have to see a lot on my screen at once. Monospace is too fucking wide, despite it being incredibly useful in many cases. 

Admittedly, this site is not mobile friendly. I use it on my phone only when I absolutely must. In time, I expect to see higher and higher resolutions on our phones. It will still be difficult to read, but that's because I'm reading this beast on a 42" screen. Anything less is really not seeing what I'm seeing. Making it mobile friendly isn't high on the list. The inclusion of QR code is perhaps just a vexing toy. I do not know.

The card really does have to flaunt it. Here I brainstorm.
