title: 2018.04.20 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Fighting on TV

!! Do you think there is too much fighting on t.v. Why or why not?

This is a mildly dated question. I cut my cords a decade ago (torrents were always a blessing to me). But, I've always watched lots of video content. That said, the amount has been decreasing over the past few years. I spend more time reading, I think. 

This question is ambiguous. What is fighting? Do you mean physical violence? No. I have no problem with it. I think it is crucial that people are familiar with evil, experience the pain of others, and know what it really means. Fighting, of course, can be more broadly understood. For example, dialectics are fighting, political debates are fights, etc. 

I'm not the sort that thinks we all just need to "calm down." It's obvious that the world could possibly be radically different, and it should be. We have to fight for that. I would say, however, that much of the fighting I see on mainstream media outlets tend to be esoteric, propagandistic, hyperreal, and essentially not the right kind of fighting, i.e. [[irwartfrr]]. I wish people to be more philosophical, less selfish, and less anti-intellectual. I wish people actually cared, but it probably requires a very systematic set of battles to win that war.
