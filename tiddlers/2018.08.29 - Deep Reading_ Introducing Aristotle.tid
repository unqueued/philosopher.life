title: 2018.08.29 - Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

I think the categories are contexts or linguistic-epistemic-context constructors or something like that. Even substances are their contexts likely. Individual perspective, an OOO kind of problem. I don't know what it means to compute without categories, which are just another way of contextualizing forms. There appear to be an infinite number of possible contexts, so how do we escape the [[infinigress]] and the related relativism of it? How do we defeat the flatness? We must posit a salience which rises from that flatness, an objective metanarrative context of all contexts, a category of all categories, etc. Yes, indeed, I think that their use of Russell and Wittgenstein here matters quite a bit. Ultimately, we have the [[CATI]] dialetheistic henosis foundation issue which cannot be resolved except by faith alone. 

I'm very pleased to be going over an intro book. I think a lot of philosophers would consider it beneath them. Perhaps I have lost my touch and that's why I find it interesting. I would like to think it forces me to think at the mile-high level in a pleasant way.'

[[The Good]] appears to simulate itself in thinking about itself, and that appears impossible to my finite mind. Deflationary, cautious minimalist metaphysics that is sufficiently honest will still result in the all-encompassing and infinite.
