title: 2017.07.24 -- Pipefitting Log

Jaye beat me there today. We sat in our cars talking to each other while I wrote. Terry's crew showed up at 7:30. We immediately set off. I showed Jaye the weld he'd be making on the double 90 piece that took forever to fit up on Friday. 

After looking at it, I saw it. It was off. The centerlines of the outlet and the double 90 coming out of the underground pipe did not matchup. I was heartbroken when I saw it. I pointed it out to Jaye. He saw it too. I knew we'd have to cut the pipe and insert a nipple. Jaye went and got Terry. Terry came over and started chewing me out.

He told me that if I can't do this job, I needed to just leave. He went on a diatribe against me. Again, I was told I deserved to be cussed out. He was pissed and just abusive. Mind you, this is the man who was in charge of the fitup. He could have seen this himself. He even took the measurements for the last pipe on the run between these two pieces. He didn't see it either, or if he did, he purposely sandbagged in order to chew me out today (which is what Jaye thinks he did). 

It is strongly my fault, although not completely. It was off by ~2". I went over my math again. It was correct. Thus, the problem was the initial measurement. This was a very hard measurement to make, mind you. The pipe wasn't plumb in any direction, and the distance did not lend itself to any of the tools in our possession. I did the best I could with what I had. A good foreman with a green worker would take the time to double check the work, particularly at crucial points like this one. IIRC, he gave me an idea of it, but not much more. I need to learn to be careful.

Making mistakes costs hours of work. Terry was pissed, but he should have caught this as well during the fitup. He could have at least been relieved that I caught it before the in-position weld to finalize it. He didn't want to see what I did right even in the midst of the mistakes. 

At least we found it. It would have been even more frustrating to go for the final fitup to see how bad it was off. Although, I must admit, I didn't make the measurements for this final pipe, and I'm worried that it will still be off. We will see. There are other variables at work here, especially after we cut the pipe and add the nipple. It shouldn't be off, but it could.

After he was done chewing me out, Jaye apologized for even talking to Terry. He said that if he thought Terry was going to react that way, he wouldn't have said anything. I'm not so convinced Jaye didn't know Terry would do that after seeing Terry's behavior for 2 weeks. I think there was an element of posturing to what Jaye did. He doesn't like snitching though. I'm not sure.

I spent quite a bit of time getting the measurements taken. I wanted to get it right (I did before too).

After the measurements, Jaye told me he talked to Terry again about it. Jaye said he wouldn't have brought it up to Terry if he knew that Terry was going to react that way. Jaye said that Terry said that he didn't mean anything bad by it, but that he just wanted me to know. I'm not sure how much I trust either Jaye or Terry at this point (even though I like Jaye).

We decided to keep the bottom 90 in place. The fitup on that was very hard. Might as well preserve that work. I cut the weld on either side of the outer end of the nipple connected the latter 90 (no more grinding). Jaye agreed to weld without bevels to keep the pace up. It took quite a while to make these cuts, and it sucks doing it in position. 

Jaye and I talked about racism and conspiracy theories again. He has a funny "white person" accent imitation he likes to bust out. Whenever I ask him to repeat himself or fail to understand his meaning, he dives into it. Lol.

By lunch, we had added the nipple and fitted it back into place with a root. Everything appears level, plumb, and squarely oriented. The measurements looked clean from either side of the flange to the pipe we're connecting to. I also measured teh pipe we have ready for it. It looks like it is a bit short, but should work just fine.

After lunch, Jaye finished the cap while I mounted the butterfly valve. We then mounted the control valve. The final pipe fit like a glove, thankfully. It was mounted before 2:00pm. Terry had expected we would take longer, I believe. He was worried we would be working on it all week, according to his previous argument. It didn't, and I think he knew better. 

Terry called up Barry. We can't work on our previous job inside because they are still painting. It wasn't going to take a day, it's going to take 2 weeks. Terry doesn't want to waste our time up on the roof, he says. Instead, he's pushing us off onto another foreman. Barry is sending us to Bull at a nearby school tomorrow. Sounds good to me. Bull and his welder (65 years old, I hear) are old school and very relaxed according to Terry. I hope that is true. We will find out. I could use a foreman that takes it easy on me.

My question, which I dare not ask, is if I'm really be moved off this job because I'm too incompetent or incompatible with my foreman. If it isn't a performance or personality conflict, then is this really just because he doesn't want to waste time moving us to the roof and back down? I'm not in a position to interpret Terry with enough accuracy at this point.

Jaye and I exchanged numbers. I messaged him the information. We are meeting at a Bojangles close to my residence. I have to wake up half an hour earlier, unfortunately. That's okay though. I'm hoping that Bull will be lenient in terms of scheduling as well. I intend on arriving early no matter what, but I kind of like not actually working for the first 30 minutes of my shift waiting on everyone to show up. It's nice. Speaking of which, I have no idea how much impact this will have on my hours. Hopefully, I'll maintain the income. Maybe I should put even more effort into tracking and planning this part. I'm not sure if there is anything to gain from it though.

Afterwards, I was asked to construct two more support stands. I take this to be busy work. From the sounds of it, he only wanted two. Now he wants four. Let me interpret this act charitably: he's trying to allow me to stay on the clock. I appreciate that.

I also checked Terry's outlet. It wasn't plumb, and it was off by a quarter inch. He can force that. Still, he's not exactly living up to high standards either.

At the end of the day, I packed up all my gear (lost my ghetto alignment bar somehow, but picked up threaded rod to replace it [which sadly works even better]) and talked with Terry. I asked him if I would be joining him after the paint was done. He said that was up to Barry. He said he was sure we would work together again though, and he said he was surprised they sent me to him in the first place instead of where I was going. I thanked him for letting me learn from him. He apologized for snapping at me. We shook hands, and I left.
