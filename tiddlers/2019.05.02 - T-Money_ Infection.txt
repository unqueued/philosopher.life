THU 12:12 PM
Yup.
THU 12:13 PM
Multiple whammies in there. I'm opposed to borders of nationalists (though I'm opposed to the Libertarian exploitation of migrants as well).
THU 12:15 PM
You would.
THU 12:22 PM
How r yea?
THU 12:22 PM
Reading and writing, homeschooling, bit of cleaning. Doing okay. Systemic fungal infection from stress.
THU 12:23 PM
How about you?
THU 12:24 PM
More about the systemic fungal infection? And what kind of stress are you dealing with?
THU 12:29 PM
I'm OK. Exciting to be going back to work. Looking forward to gains in weighloss
THU 12:29 PM
Just normal stress, that's what happens to me when I'm stressed. I become inflammed and immunocompromised.
THU 12:30 PM
I am excited for you too! =)
THU 12:30 PM
Where is the. Location of this fungal infection?
THU 12:30 PM
I ask. Because I battle with an skin infection
THU 12:31 PM
Pretty much everywhere, my arms are the worst.
THU 12:31 PM
That's crazy man. You've seen a dermo for it?
THU 12:31 PM
I get an uncomforyable skin yeast infection in the folds of my skin sometimes.
THU 12:32 PM
Best solution. Weight loss.
THU 12:32 PM
It's not bad enough that I'm going to pay for a doctor's visit yet.
THU 12:33 PM
Ah.
THU 12:38 PM
I go to the doctor as needed.
THU 12:38 PM
Like when my body is covered in a rash.
THU 12:38 PM
I'd go
THU 12:38 PM
;)
THU 12:39 PM
We live on considerably less income.
THU 12:39 PM
You have health insurance don't you?
THU 12:39 PM
I am impressed that you choose to go though. Lol.
THU 12:39 PM
If it's like like bro I'll pay for the visit.... Especially if it comes down to one of your kids man.
THU 12:40 PM
Please call or text. I will gladly help.
THU 12:41 PM
I appreciate that. Thank you. It's not bad enough yet. I'm following the same routine that I used to fix it last time. I think it will subside.
THU 12:41 PM
Your old and dumb. You can't help that.
THU 12:41 PM
The kiddos though. That is not an empty offer.
THU 12:42 PM
They get their yearly checkup, all their shots, etc. We do have insurance, it just doesn't cover much, lol.
THU 12:43 PM
Yeah. Mind doesn't either. It's 14k a year then a 3, 200 dedutable.
THU 12:44 PM
It's downright robbery. But whatever.
THU 12:44 PM
Again. Just text me or call if shit ever gets weird and you don't have someone to turn to.
THU 12:45 PM
No strings attached...
THU 12:46 PM
Aye. I know. =) I wouldn't want to take you up on your generosity unless I was very hard pressed. We're doing well.
THU 12:48 PM
I get reminded of that everyday when I work with my middle schoolers. Some of those kids break my heart.
THU 12:49 PM
I just want to iterate it's there. If you ever need it. And I can't help the world. But I can offer to help those close to me.
THU 12:49 PM
I might be a capitolists. But I give when I see the need.
THU 12:50 PM
I have had to turn down a few single guys who were in hard places. Close friends. But I felt they hadn't exhausted their options.
THU 12:51 PM
They of course found a way. And they didn't have kids
THU 12:51 PM
I'm no monster. [[h0p3]]! Libertarian capitolists or not.
THU 12:53 PM
I won't ever be able to live up to your high expectations. But I do what my mind and heart compels me to do.
THU 12:54 PM
When it's easy
THU 12:54 PM
Lol. I am touched that you offer your help to me. Luke 6:33.
THU 12:54 PM
I don't help people move. (got fucked way to many times on that)
THU 12:54 PM
I think help close friends and family is still different from how we lead our lives as political animals toward humanity in general.
THU 12:54 PM
I'm not an animal.
THU 12:55 PM
I am!
THU 12:55 PM
I don't think we are //mere// animals though.
THU 12:55 PM
A fuzzy teddy bear with a loud ass mouth.
THU 12:55 PM
The worst kind, like a nightmare Xmas present.
THU 12:55 PM
If I was in a fight I wouldn't call you for backup.
THU 12:55 PM
Depends on the fight.
THU 12:56 PM
Passifist. You'd psyco analyze everyine and have us crying and hugging
THU 12:56 PM
Lol
THU 12:56 PM
I think I'm growing up to be a hippie.
THU 12:57 PM
So what things on the job will have to change, if anything for you?
THU 12:59 PM
Squatting instead of bending. Paying attention to staying in akward positions for a long time.
THU 1:00 PM
Work is going to be easier to adjust to. It becomes habit. And you just do it. The repetitive motions I will change to more back friendly. Just ergonomics.
THU 1:01 PM
Work on the farm, garage, my passions and projects. These are the things that have and will have to be altered significantly
THU 1:02 PM
Looking to sell off alot of projects.
THU 1:02 PM
I have downsized over the years. But hard pill to swallow for a man with big dreams and who always pushed to finish jobs.
THU 1:03 PM
That sucks. =/
THU 1:04 PM
I assume you will move to indoor projects, like playing music with your daughter?
THU 1:04 PM
Also, reminds me of you: http://wearable-chair-reviews.com/
THU 1:04 PM
this past week i have seen a big difference in pain. as in actually having no pain. at least until i do stuff.
THU 1:05 PM
i cut the grass and got laid the other day and could barely get out of bed to piss
THU 1:05 PM
worth it. but man, sad reality.
THU 1:06 PM
First week back might be a killer.
THU 1:06 PM
But, I assume it will even out  some.
THU 1:06 PM
yes in reflection over the last 7 weeks i have revaluated my life thousands of times.
THU 1:07 PM
i saw my addictions controling me, my desire to aquire material and actual wealth controling me.
THU 1:07 PM
just down a dark path. my daughter is my new main focus and my wife.
THU 1:08 PM
just needed to reset my priorities.
THU 1:08 PM
did some light soccer with samantha yesturday and we played music as well.
THU 1:09 PM
Noice. That is lovely.
THU 1:10 PM
looking to elimiate 75% of our debt by the end of the year. so really puts a damper on disposable income. but revaluating my job and the time i get to spend with her. it is so precious. and she needs me right now more than she ever will. over the next 8 years or so.
THU 1:11 PM
i am prepared to take a massive pay cut and career change to be able to be with her more.
THU 1:12 PM
but this time i reconize it isnt for selfish reasons.
THU 1:12 PM
I'm sure she will treasure that time with you too.
THU 1:13 PM
i need to keep the depression at bay. i can deal with my anxiety.
THU 1:14 PM
but as i have grown older. my depression lingers, it is dark, deep, and debilitating.
THU 1:14 PM
but you know what i mean.
THU 1:14 PM
hell youve got hives.
THU 1:15 PM
from LIFE!
THU 1:15 PM
Lol. I hear that.
THU 1:16 PM
so on another note.
THU 1:18 PM
what kind of guitar strings do you use?
THU 1:18 PM
I have no idea.
THU 1:18 PM
I work with a guy who makes guitar strings, but I don't know the first thing about them.
THU 1:18 PM
I've never had to restring my guitar, but I have had to restring my banjo.
THU 1:19 PM
i dont know how often you play, or what level you play at. so i dont know if you would appricate them.
THU 1:19 PM
ive never heard you play so im not sure is what i mean.
THU 1:19 PM
I'm a beginner who plays rarely (forever a beginner).
THU 1:22 PM
yeah but your like a savont. so you could be like eric claypton level
THU 1:23 PM
and being humbl
THU 1:23 PM
Lol. Maybe as a kid. I think my magic is gone.
THU 1:23 PM
I just play for fun and emotion now. I like celtic and blues fingerstyle, and I play simple songs.
THU 1:24 PM
well, if you havent put a new set of strings on your guitar in the last year.
THU 1:25 PM
you probably should
THU 1:25 PM
and i want to recommend elixir ultra light strings with nanoweb coating
THU 1:26 PM
its what i use on most all my stuff. but this last guitar i put a set of non coated medium strings on it to try to get a different sounds.
THU 1:26 PM
way too rough to play. switched them out yesturday with the elixirs and its like a different guitar.
THU 1:27 PM
Highly rated strings. It's nice to have instruments and tools which complement the user, become extensions of us, and still get a deliciously new feel out of an old object.
THU 1:29 PM
indeed. this was on my relic guitar. so the brand new guitar i got and then made it look like shit.
THU 1:31 PM
lol
THU 1:31 PM
i encourage you to restring. the ease of which a new good set of strings plays will inspire you to play more
THU 1:32 PM
even for just a short while.
THU 1:32 PM
Like getting new bearings for a skateboard.
THU 1:33 PM
polyweb or nanoweb. depends on how particular you are.
THU 1:33 PM
i still kick myself for losing that skateboard you gave me.
THU 1:33 PM
i loved that thing man.
THU 1:33 PM
I successfully performed an ollie this past year. I'm so proud of myself. I'm lucky I didn't break my neck.
THU 1:34 PM
i didnt lose it. i just left it in the basment inside danforth for like 4 hours. and it was gone
THU 1:34 PM
heck yeah man!
THU 1:34 PM
Well, I hope whoever took it put it to good use.
THU 1:34 PM
nope. i hope they break their neck
THU 1:35 PM
theifs...
THU 1:35 PM
lost like 3 bicycles there, a skateboard, and a few other things.
THU 1:35 PM

THU 1:37 PM
buddy of mine gave me a board and trucks. so i did the same thing you did, used large soft wheels and good bearings to try to recreate that board.
THU 1:37 PM
That pic was only about a year and a half ago! BTW. I had a much better skater coaching me and it took alot of tries and falls to get that cool shot. Lol
THU 2:02 PM
It's a great shot. =)
THU 2:03 PM
