Good morning ‚òÄÔ∏è Happy Saturday!! How are you guys!?How did [[k0sh3k]]‚Äôs interview go?
OCT 19 10:13 AM
Hey! =)
OCT 19 11:46 AM
We are doing well. [[j3d1h]] is off painting some walls at the church. Everyone else is reading and writing. 
OCT 19 11:46 AM
[[k0sh3k]]'s interview went well. It was an insane trip for her, balls to the wall, one thing after another.
OCT 19 11:47 AM
They picked her up and sent her home in a fucking limo, lol.
OCT 19 11:47 AM
We don't belong there.
OCT 19 11:47 AM
We find out in a week or so if she becomes the final candidate (at which point she needs her current co-workers and employer to write letters of recommendation so they can sweep for redflags).
OCT 19 11:48 AM
Aww well don‚Äôt be so quick to say you don‚Äôt belong there! No matter what it‚Äôs a great opportunity and there‚Äôs a great possibility for you guys to remain humble & happy regardless of how anyone else would be living! I‚Äôm sure she needs all the positivity she can get in this moment. It does sound intense!
OCT 19 12:07 PM
Relaxing Saturday for everyone it seems! I‚Äôll try and keep my music down over here üòâ
OCT 19 12:08 PM
I thought you would be happy to know I‚Äôm quitting work! This time for good no if ands or buts- it‚Äôs time to get the fuck out of there! I already have an interview with another family tomorrow. If all goes well moving forward is just more ideal right now than working anything out!
OCT 19 12:09 PM
Ah, yeah, I think it would be amazing if we got to go. My hope is at 33% chance, since we found out there were two other candidates. Good odds for winning the lottery.
OCT 19 12:11 PM
And, no worries on the music, mine is always blasting (unless there is a show on).
OCT 19 12:11 PM
And, fuck yeah to quitting!
OCT 19 12:11 PM
That is fantastic.

That‚Äôs where I am
OCT 19 12:12 PM
I was told her mom was discussing my pay as if I wasn‚Äôt worth it.
OCT 19 12:13 PM
Disgusting.
OCT 19 12:13 PM
And a few days before that she sends this message to us (me and the other girl working there)

rofl, that is fucked up
OCT 19 12:20 PM
I‚Äôm done [[h0p3]] they can‚Äôt afford to pay me but are in Florida right now in their private penthouse on Naples beach- all brand new clothes and private jets
OCT 19 12:21 PM
A capitalist aims to pay you as little as possible to get you to work as long and as intensely as possible as the circumstances allow (including whatever is left of their own conscience). She has no intention of inspecting that cognitive dissonance.
OCT 19 12:22 PM
It‚Äôs a fucking joke
OCT 19 12:22 PM
Nope
OCT 19 12:22 PM
We talked today Esteban and I that is very similar to fascism-
OCT 19 12:23 PM
Hands down. And yes that‚Äôs not to far from Capitalism they‚Äôre all in the same boat if you ask me!
OCT 19 12:23 PM
It is an insidious form of fascism.

OCT 19 12:24 PM
God damn! ROFL.
OCT 19 12:25 PM
Or maybe it‚Äôs this? Shit at this point It‚Äôs all the above
OCT 19 12:25 PM
I hope your next job will be significantly saner (which isn't to say you won't face similar exploitation).
OCT 19 12:26 PM
Not going to worry about that nor speak it into my future! I know there are good people who are considered and value other peoples time and effort.
OCT 19 12:28 PM
Not to say you are wrong by any means
OCT 19 12:28 PM
I guess I‚Äôm just wanting to be optimistic and start doing what I need to do to not work for anyone
OCT 19 12:29 PM
Sorry if I was aggressive
OCT 19 12:29 PM
I just am over a lot of it -
OCT 19 12:30 PM
Naw, lol. I think you are way calmer than you should be. I'm pissed on your behalf.
OCT 19 12:30 PM
Not lashing at you lashing at the situation
OCT 19 12:30 PM
Oh if you only knew
OCT 19 12:30 PM
I‚Äôve had to do a lot of talks with Jesus
