Hey, I get to choose the quotes here. I'm taking it easy today because I'm feeling sick. I'm going to shoot for optimism today, something [[hope]]ful. That's totally like me and stuff.

I've seen this sentiment captured in many places. It's got that [[Carpe Diem]] + sucking out the marrow thing going on. I appreciate how it highlights that we define ourselves through stories, and it celebrates our memories as essential to having any [[phenomenology]] to our [[4DID]]. It reminds me of that //Hallelujah// song too. Maybe the quote is patronizing, and I don't think that's what one ought to say to someone who is grieving (though I cannot say I know what to do other than hold someone and cry with them, unless I'm in my problem-solving mode and believe it can be fixed).

This reminds me of relationships more than anything. I've met people I will no longer be able to meet again for various reasons, or I won't be able to communicate how they really matter in a way which will be valuable to us, or shit just went all wrong. I want to celebrate what was [[good]] about our relationship, to cherish it, and to be grateful. It's one source of burning [[hope]], I take it.

Plus, don't I look prettier when I smile? People like me when I don't have my sour face, right? =)
