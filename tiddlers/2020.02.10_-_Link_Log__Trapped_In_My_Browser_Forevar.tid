* Think About It

*** Uh, evolution is a fine word. The issue at stake is the [[dok]] to which we are each a locus of control. [[W5H]] are we free to do otherwise, including fighting back against egoism that naturally evolves and arises in the state of nature. That is where your argument is really pointing though; you've just not got the background to explicitly develop the foundations to your argument.
*** It's true that I am hyperprivileged in many respects. Owning your data is still doable in the first-world though. Most of the people I know really are responsible for their choices in this sphere. They've systematically chosen to sell us all out.

*** This is exactly why fundamental decentralization is necessary. Even though I hold Wikipedia in such high regard, they are still the point of failure. Epistemic authority must be distributed, and I want voting and the trust I've built across my networks to determine what shows up on my pages (and I also want to see the other opposing clusters!). It's such a hard problem to actually build out, and we're losing that ability as the internet continues to centralize.

*** When you finally cough up a socialist argument which follows from this, I'll believe you mean it. Right up to the edge; it's only appearance.
