* Properties
** Quadrilogy
** Just Infinite Jest

**** Even open with TLDRs on gradient in succession, down to the elevator speech abstract? 
*** Cascading [[footnotes]]. 
** [[Straussian]] Dialectical [[Good]] & Evil Dualist's Interpretation. Two stories.
** An Ultra-Dialectical Theory of Dasein
** ASCII Art, duh.
*** A comic reduction.

!!! ⦗Pre-Wiki⦘ 

* Properties
** a.k.a. {[[Vault]]}
** As linear as can be, second-class wiki mapping.

** Short-stories, anecdotes, impressions at best, sadly.

!!! ⦗h0p3's Annotated Theory of Hope⦘
