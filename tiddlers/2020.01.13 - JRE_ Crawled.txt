How did he react to it?
Jan 13 1:29pm
I was all "omg thank god, I thought you was full retard..."

It's a means to an end for him, once he figured it out he seemed more intent on finally getting to what he wanted to crawl to

Boy is off the races now.

Work was fine, has been nice being with a much less cliquey group, went in on the defensive, but its proving to be good

Heck yeah. I'm glad. Nice to be able to have your guard down.
