!! What happened last week? Have you been happy this past week? Why or why not?

* 1uxb0x
** I've been very happy this week. The only time I wasn't was Monday, the worst day of them all. Starting school again sucks.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** You did great in your work logs this week.
** You did a great job writing in your programming log, in particular. It was very well-organized, and I loved the examples you give.
** I am glad you are the kind of person who likes to cuddle. 
* j3d1h
** I'm glad to see you using chat tools to talk with me, and that you landed on your feet after losing your game privilege.
** You are doing a great job on the art piece for your dad.
** You are actually making something for X-mas, which is really awesome and meaningful.
* k0sh3k
** Thank you for making baklava for us.
** Thank you for helping me find presents for dad and my sister.
** Thank you for having an open ear and giving me an advice about the problems on the wiki I had this week.
* h0p3
** I'm sorry for not doing my schoolwork on Monday. I know I made it a very difficult day for us.
** Thank you for helping me figure out mom's gift.
** Thank you for being the kind of person who works hard to make relationships work. You see people as fundamentally evil/egoistic/selfish, and yet you go out of your way to see them in a better and charitable light individually.
*** My march towards the redpill is not done hastily.
