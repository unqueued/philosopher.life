[12:23 AM]  h0p3: Noice. Gratz.
[12:24 AM]  h0p3: Anything stand out for ya?
[12:25 AM]  chameleon: husband's deck is so big-brained
[12:25 AM]  chameleon: it's one of these play-on-every-phase pieces of shit
[12:26 AM]  chameleon: he came first today

Much Abrew: Bant Enigma Pod (Standard, Magic Arena)
How good is our new enchantment Birthing Pod—Enigmatic Incarnation—in Theros: Beyond Death Standard? Let's find out!

[12:26 AM]  chameleon: apparently very similar to this
[12:29 AM]  h0p3: Nifty. That is much like a Pod deck (and before that, Survival of the Fittest).
[12:29 AM]  h0p3: I like the toolbox and heavy stack abuse.
[12:30 AM]  h0p3: Reminds of a haiku from Vintage:  I see 10 Birthdays; My Grandkids grow old, move out; Please resolve Brainstorm.
[12:31 AM]  h0p3: One of the reason Top got banned in Legacy. Logistically, it is annoying to play against, especially in timed rounds. Last 5 turns taking 20 minutes is ridiculous.
[12:36 AM]  chameleon: told him the haiku, he laughed out loud =w=.
[12:39 AM]  chameleon: I feel like asking you to friend him now
[12:39 AM]  chameleon: he loves talking magic
[12:40 AM]  chameleon: hang on, I should add you to the s.c discord
[12:41 AM]  chameleon: it's my friend server basically. lol
[12:44 AM]  chameleon: the abyssal's name is magnus on discord
[12:44 AM]  chameleon: i think. he might be called AbyssalDad on s.c

gpg -o muhinfos.txt -d muhinfos.gpg #faster for you than keying up

password = `<only-the-coolest-girl>`
[4:50 PM]  h0p3: Let me know when you grab it.
[4:51 PM]  chameleon: there are lots of cool girls!

[4:52 PM]  h0p3: I was going to wait until I finished my letter, but that's taking forever. I don't ask you to recriprocate here. Keep your identity safe until you are strongly convinced you want to share it.
[4:52 PM]  chameleon: thank you!
[4:52 PM]  chameleon: alright! You can delete it whenever =w=.
