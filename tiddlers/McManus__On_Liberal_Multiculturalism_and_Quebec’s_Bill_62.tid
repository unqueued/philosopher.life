title: McManus: On Liberal Multiculturalism and Quebecâ€™s Bill 62

<<<
Compelling Muslim women to take off their religious headgear treats them primarily as members of a religious community condemned by the majority, rather than as individuals who possess rights to express themselves regardless of what the government and its supporters might want. 
<<<

It's inexcuseable censorship. Even if I have a moral problem with that religious headgear, I don't consider it my political right to force them not to express it. 

<<<
Democratic majorities are certainly entitled to enact policies which express their cultural traditions.  
<<<

I do not see why.

<<<
Bill 62 is a discriminatory bill that targets a vulnerable religious minority
<<<

Preach.
