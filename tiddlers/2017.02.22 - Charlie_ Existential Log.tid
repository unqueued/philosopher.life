title: 2017.02.22 - Charlie: Existential Log

I had a very good 3.5 hour conversation with [[Charlie]], my new friend (we've been acquaintances for a long time). He is amazing. He's an autistic savant.<<ref "1">> C is a fucking genius in disguise or imprisoned by his autism. His formal, official education is no indicator of his knowledge or inferential capacities at all. If sum IQ were reified into marbles, and intelligence broken into different kinds of baskets, [C] has profound imbalances in which baskets nature dumped the marbles. The sum total of marbles is very high in certain baskets, but perhaps below average in others (social skills vary wildly in him). The learning disability in one space is so striking against the genius in other spaces.  

He's a man of deep innocence and profound curiosity to me. He is obviously self-taught and susceptible to the people he trusts. I take myself to be responsible for not damaging that innocence. 

Talking with him is revealing to me. I connect parts I did not before because of him. He follows arguments very well and sees the threads weave where others wouldn't in his position. He's almost too smart for his own good. I hope he has more self-control and self-preservation built into him than I do. I worry that my philosophical demons will be communicated to him, that I will infect him. I think I am poison for this man. Most people are immune to it because they cannot see what I do. [C] is smart enough and wired in the right way to catch my memetic viruses when I sneeze. I feel like I am doing a disservice to his happiness by talking to him. Like, if I were a real friend, I just wouldn't be myself around him because what I really believe and think is a true danger to his mind and happiness.
