title: 2017.08.10 -- Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.08.09 -- Unschool Log]]
** Yay. We legitimately had a decent day of unschooling. This might work.
* [[2017.08.09 -- Carpe Diem Log]]
** I really do spend all day at work.
* [[2017.08.09 -- Prompted Introspection Log]]
** David can see I'm a complete noob still. 
* [[2017.08.09 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** I'm glad that I added the [[Highdeas Log]]. This wiki started out while I was high, and it's predecessor as well. This is excellent. It's evidence that I'm existentially and ethically productive on it.
* [[2017.08.09 -- Pipefitting Log]]
** Brief again. You are still getting your bearings and worklife flow going. Keep at it.
* [[2017.08.09 -- ALM Letter]]
** I'm not sure what he feels about it.
