!! Audit:

* I love rabbitholing on this log.
* I wish to point out how I've had a lot of link work elsewhere on the wiki. This is my standard stack. I like that.
* Some of my longest link logs have been in this past month.
** And, yet, I've obviously posted some of the shortest in this month as well. I get done what I can get done, I suppose.
* It's clear that certain categories have little or no commentary whatsoever. I feel more compelled to say something when I don't know or feel something odd is going on.
* I've been spending more time dealing with SSC.
* My Maymays are dark and educationally-oriented.
* ChapoTrapHouse has become a wonderful place for me. I wish I knew how I found it. I want to continue to move into new subs.
* There are days where I also have almost nothing to say. I'm just cataloging.
* The title.Titles show that I find it to be a flood of chores
* It's clear that I can't remember even most of this. I hope that it forms impressions and nudges in my Fastmind.
* My family hasn't been making us of the links I find for them. =/ That makes me sad. =(
* I covered an insane amount of content. =) Good job, homie!
