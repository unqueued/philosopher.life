My brother seems to interact with Raylan particularly when he knows he is being watched by his SO. When he knows she is coming from another room, he jumps into action to play his part. I understand where he is coming from. 

I've tried to convince my brother to find his purpose, boldly. I can't do it for him, but I can try to point out what it means to do so, give some advice as a nomad, etc.

We seem to be far more disconnected than usual on this trip. The lines of what we can and will talk about, I suppose, are drawn. It's still surprisingly isolating here at my brother's. I'm grateful to see him and be with him, even if much of our time appears wasted.

Disconnected is the word. I'm definitely feeling that in many respects. It is difficult to tell my wife that she is literally in charge of the trip to see my donors. I have already had too much of a hand in helping bring it into being. If she really thinks it is important, despite my radical disagreement, then she will have to do it. It's like going to Church. 

I am glad to have an anchor, even if it disconnects me from everything but myself in many respects.
