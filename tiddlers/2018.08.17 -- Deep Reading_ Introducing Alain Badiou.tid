title: 2018.08.17 -- Deep Reading: Introducing Alain Badiou

I'm getting annoyed with this book. Badiou appears to want to have his cake and eat it too in normativity. Postmodernism is a beast to slay, and he doesn't really seem to get it deep down. He's worried about the problems, but it appears to be handwaiving that gets him past it. I'm at the point where I just don't see the reason to continue reading the book. The categories and reasoning that connects the dots seem completely pointless. Thus, I will put this book down!
