Hope you have a great day today
TUE 8:33 AM
It's gone well. How have you been up to?
TUE 3:41 PM
Working hard today and going to class. Yourself?
TUE 3:58 PM
Yeah, work. [[k0sh3k]]'s been sick today. I'm hoping it will pass quickly for her.
TUE 4:22 PM
Poor thing. :( flu?
TUE 4:25 PM
I am not sure. Could be. She's ridiculously busy too. It's a bad time for her to get sick (not that any time is a good one).
TUE 4:26 PM
How's KH going?
TUE 4:26 PM
Haven’t been able to play it for a few days. :(
TUE 4:26 PM
Too busy.
TUE 4:26 PM
That sucks =(
TUE 6:04 PM
Meh. Spring break is only a month away!
TUE 6:26 PM
I finished the rough draft of my paper too
TUE 6:26 PM
Yay! I love that you draft.  I made the mistake of not doing so way too many times.
TUE 6:40 PM
Funny thing is, my drafts look closer to the finals for school work.
TUE 6:43 PM
But I can’t do that for my creative writing. :joy:
TUE 6:44 PM
Would you consider taking another look at my paper? It’s complete more or less now and I’ve done an accurate new critic reading to the best of my knowledge. I’d love to hear your perspective.
TUE 6:50 PM
Reading now.
TUE 6:52 PM
I also am not qualified to tell you what your teacher (or her discipline) is expecting.
TUE 6:53 PM
Antinomy may be worth further explorations. It is a fabulously difficult problem.
TUE 6:54 PM
The Other branches into a lot of places, imho.
TUE 6:55 PM
Should you be talking so much about Wordsworth? Are  you allowed to access that in this style of interpretation?
TUE 6:57 PM
I have no idea how far you should contextualize it.
TUE 6:57 PM
I'd want to know more about your theory on New Criticism.
TUE 7:00 PM
I'm a footnote whore, so maybe that would a reasonable place to add it (if that would be important to you).
TUE 7:00 PM
Look, I'm a noob here. I'm in no position to tell you if this is in the new critic style according to an expert. I can tell you that if feels like you've violated the principle here and there.
TUE 7:01 PM
But, maybe that is the whole point!
TUE 7:01 PM
I'd like to have seen a contrast between following the true new critic and without. Show me why your way is superior.
TUE 7:02 PM
I treated Wordsworth as a character, but I also allude to his intent in my last paragraph. Which is a violation of the practice. Lol
TUE 7:02 PM
I hear ya. Lol.
TUE 7:03 PM
When you can steelman New Criticism and still destroy it, that's when you've got 'em.
TUE 7:03 PM
In any case, I appreciate you taking a peek at it!
TUE 7:04 PM
np =)
TUE 7:04 PM
What are you up to tonight?
TUE 8:08 PM
[[j3d1h]] didn't finish her schoolwork (normal), and we've had a row over it. I may have to take her phone from her. [[1uxb0x]] finished his work (extremely abnormal)...that desk is doing him wonders (he made dinner with me). They are doing the kitchen now.
TUE 8:11 PM
[[k0sh3k]]'s chillin.
TUE 8:11 PM
I'm getting drunk, supposed to work on my EFF cover letter (I'm going to ask for your help, with a fine-tooth comb or TNT bombs if you can), but I'm stuck thinking about this:

I would love to proofread your cover letter! It would be my honor.
TUE 8:15 PM
Looks like your work is starting to have some reach in others! :grin:
TUE 8:15 PM
That’s wonderful
TUE 8:15 PM
Thank you! It would be my dream job, lol.
TUE 8:15 PM
It appears that there are dozens of us!
TUE 8:16 PM
I need to watch Arrested Development. Badly.
TUE 8:17 PM
Shall I put it in the sync?
TUE 8:17 PM
If you’d like! We have [[AA]] and [[UJ]]’s Netflix though.
TUE 8:17 PM
Netflix has been a beautiful attempt to answer piracy. I remember when they just mailed you shit.
TUE 8:21 PM
That was interesting haha.
TUE 8:35 PM
I think they still do tbh
TUE 8:35 PM
:thinking_face:
TUE 8:35 PM
<3, indeed, digitally.
TUE 8:36 PM
Arrested Development is a show that you can watch a few times in a row and still find spectacular new jokes.
TUE 8:37 PM
All too often, they don't deliver a punchline for several episodes.
TUE 8:37 PM
I'm slow at this thing, but I'm getting there.
TUE 8:37 PM
I’ve seen 6 episodes? But it’s been YEARS
TUE 8:37 PM
It's delicious in its depiction of humanity.
