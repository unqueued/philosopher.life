The ravings of a madman. Ignore at will, please. =)

Content-wise, if you like OC and personal sites (as well as an interesting point of view), I recommend checking out this conduitic digital library: https://kickscondor.com

    hope did you create an account on hipinion.com just to post that reply

    this is maybe the weirdest thing that has happened to me on this website

I did. Serendipity. =)

I was surprised to see my wiki mentioned. Your comment made me giggle, so I thought I'd drop in.

Don't be a stranger, tsargaritaville. It is my honor and privilege to speak with people in the open. If you haven't already, hit me up.

    I like the idea of maintaining a personal wiki but jeez I don't think all the "content" I've ever generated (online or off) is even close to a fraction of what's on that site

    anyway great job h0p3, maybe you'll post here sometimes

Thank you for your warm hospitality.

If you ever want help making a Tiddlywiki or sharing it, let me know. I'll do my best to help. I'm lucky to know a few people who maintain some fascinating wikis (https://sphygm.us/ and https://wiki.waifu.haus/).

    I really like that rainbow sidebar graphic on philosopher.life

Me too. =). It is a reminder and a spark of brightness for me in what can sometimes be dark times and spaces. Also, I'm a fan of that Grendel book. I need to get back to reading moar.

Sadly, due to the home I was raised in, I didn't. I was lucky enough to participate in the explosion of the internet in the 90's though.
