title: 2018.08.29 -- Wiki Audit: Music

New log: [[Music: Exploration]]. I don't know why I didn't do that all along, right? Seems like such an obvious thing to think about.

There's a way in which a non-trivial portion of what goes into this wiki is what I'm experiencing on the web. I spend large portions of my day on the web, and this is a catalog of it. Normally, I would try to think about how to automate that ask. I'm not sure if I can do that nicely though. There's a way in which I think it has to be done by hand. Only I know where it belongs and why? Maybe. 

Ugh. I'd need to containerize FF way fucking harder to do this. And, frankly, containers are not nearly performant enough. I feel like I already push FF to its limits. Maybe this is a long-term kind of problem to worry about. I do like that I'm asking how to automate this kind of stuff. 

The speech-to-text transcription issue for [[BAGD]] seems like another solid example. Eventually, I want to talk into my wiki and edit from there. I'm still constructing the bigger picture, so that's okay.

Admittedly, while I've been exercising [[FTO]] hard, I've just not spent nearly enough time working on {[[Principles]]} like I should.
