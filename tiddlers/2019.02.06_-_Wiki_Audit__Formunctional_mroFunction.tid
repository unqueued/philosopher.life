title: 2019.02.06 - Wiki Audit: Formunctional mroFunction

[[Sphygmus]] seems to not only be offering different styles to her wiki (and [[kickscondor]] to href.cool), but perhaps also gesturing to us that the choosing the form of the doorway is going to be functionally valuable (beyond looking awesome). I am obviously a noob here. 

I am reminded of colorblind mode for games, for which I am grateful. Similarly, I need dark mode for my light sensitivity (such a picky bastard, I know). 

Jed has (perhaps jokingly, maybe?) claimed he cannot read anything on my site due to dyslexia. I'm briefly considered it here: [[2018.12.12 - Wiki Audit: Switching]]. Skinning my site may be functionally valuable. 

What are the functional contexts where the form matters?<<ref "i">>

* Mobile first design
* Dyslexia

So, I've added "ALIAS/LINKS/POPUPS constructed via filters" to [[Wiki: TDL]]. I suppose that could be made firmcoded. I'm not sure it's important enough. I want to be able to point to dynamic constructions with am internal link alone.

Hrm.

Is it possible to choose a CSS-based look for a wiki from the URL in the same way that we can choose the storyriver?

I envision bookmarking/syndication/function-cosmetics to be a kind of input from the URL into the html file. I don't want to store cookies and shit on people's computers. I want them to choose the doorways from the URL bar or inside the wiki itself.

As usual, I feel like I'm just reinventing the reinvention of the wheel here. There must be countless better ways to do it. 

What are the limits of this input mechanism? Can I feed it a complete stylesheet of my own design? Are there more important kinds of injections to consider? I can only assume browsers aren't designed for this to be taken to an extreme.

It's fascinating to see Google may have the URL disappear or at least appear different as they shape the web into infantilized-usability. Am I ruining the URL in the same way? Tinfoil hat question: are they going to be opposed to this kind of URL-based functionality? They are moving to other methods of tracking users. They want control of your URL bar; they want to mediate all interaction to the web.

Will Chrome eventually destroy parts of what I do in my wiki? It is possible.
