title: 2017.03.27 -- Pipefitting Log

The bookstore said to hold off on the rack. Apparently, the director wanted something that curved, and another person didn't want us to drill in the brick. So, that is on hold, perhaps indefinitely. That's okay though. I had a good time getting it ready.

We took our test. I got an 88 =/, yuck. I knew what I did wrong though. The curriculum is actually pass/fail. Still, I would like to ace it. I have 4 more tests left in my second book, and 9 more in the third book. This can be done in around 7-13 weeks, and I'll still be crushing it. The other guys want to push even faster in these books (Chris does as well as I do, but Nash is barely passing these tests), and I just don't think it is necessary or wise. I want to keep up though. I think I can study on our April break to prepare to take a bunch of exams when we get back. Technically, I have ~34ish weeks of class left (I don't anticipate being in class that long, obviously). I don't see a reason to push faster than I want to though, since there is no way that I can finish before July-ish anyways, and even then, I technically still have to show up to class (or co-op).

Also, I should push hard. Even if I'm done with the content of the course, I can at least continue working on welding and possibly Millwright. They'd let me, I think.

I'm putting the cart before the horse though. Speaking of rocking it, and yet failing pretty hard today (but not giving up, ofc! ;P): I also did poorly on my second simulator piece today (relatively poorly). We put it together (we being Chris and I; Nash did about jackshit today, as usual), and dragged it over to the simulator to mount. We very quickly found out we had the height on the top leg wrong. I immediately knew what we did wrong. It took me a couple minutes to convince the other guys what we did wrong. We forgot to subtract from our initial measurements (we had obviously planned to do it, and we took the measurements for that purpose; we just didn't follow through on a single piece of subtraction [I feel like an idiot, to say the least {ofc, we all make mistakes!}.]). We took the top leg off, and I quickly cut and threaded it to the right size.

We put it back together and tried to mount it again. We were off, again. This time, I have no idea why we were off. We decided to cheat: to stovepipe it (however minorly). We partially mounted it (heavy mother fucker, just holding it). Nash was here to "help," but clearly had no idea what the problem was. This kid can't actually do the work. Nash did not understand what he needed to measure. He finally figured out after we were holding this heavy monster trying to explain it. It was off by 1-9/16". This part did not make sense. Our math was right given the measurements we had. The construct itself also measured out to our schematic's specifications. The only other option was that our initial measurements were wrong. 

It is weird to be off by that much and not immediately have a good explanation. My theory, at this point, that we failed to measure from the correct points on the flanges. It's my responsibility to get it right. I'm going center to center from now on, and I'm going to be even slower in my graphing. Anyways, we chopped the toe off the leg, and I did the cutting and threading (since Nash was too lazy, and Chris is legitimately worried he would continue to cut too short [which is fair; my records of our job show he continues to cut too short]). We put it back together and mounted it. It fit. The teacher smiled as I explained what we thought went wrong. He said good job and to move on.

We then started the 2" simulator stage. We drew it up and took the measurements. Cool fact, given the position/direction of the 2" flanges, we didn't have to measure the distance from the flange to the simulator backbone. Between the flanges and the floor, we could get everything we needed. It is trickier now with the 1" and 1.5" simulator stages already mounted; they get in the way of accurate measurements. We did what we could, and then we did the math. Everyone agrees it should work (consensus and commitment: go teamwork!). We went center-center on everything this time. We were careful on our floor measurements. Next time, I'm just going to pinch the plumb-bob and measure it to the pinch mark. This was one has a valve built into it. The teacher told me to "wing it" on figuring out the valve takeouts (since he didn't know a better way). Lol. Alright. I can do that.

Tomorrow, we'll bang it out. You know, I think I'd like to double check my measurements for the schematic itself yet again. Couldn't hurt.

At the end of the day, my teacher asked me if I had seen Randy. I said, yes, and that Randy gave me some books to read. He "guessed" they were history books. I'm 90% sure that my teacher knew I had seen Randy (they talk), and had probably heard from Randy himself. 

Also, this is third time I've found Harold with my stuff. It was two pieces today: my tape measure and the two-holes that I "checked out" from Tim, on loan, basically. Multiple people have experienced this. I'm annoyed by the tape measure, but I was actually a bit pissed about the two-holes. To a small degree, that's my reputation on the line if they get fucked up. I told him not to touch my things without my permission, and that included the two-holes since I was responsible for their well-being (we'll see if he's assholish enough to retaliate). The teacher, apparently, already knew about it. He had been watching the table that took our things. He gave me permission to be more aggressive about it (but I won't; there's no value in it), and said the kid would have his fingers broken if he had done that in the field. Apparently, our teacher will be giving us a serious talk tomorrow about it.
