title: 2020.01.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: DMV Fail

* Woke at 8:30ish
** My wife is crashing through each morning. She's not a happy camper lately. Red tide sucks.
* SUV inspection
** Passed. 
** Talked with a random fella'. 
* Fixed my wife's phone (for now). 
** I'm surprised by the way it has been performing so many updates (which is rarely the complaint I would have in the Android ecosystem).
*** <3 LineageOS usually (not perfect in many respects though). If we go with another for her, maybe that's where'll go.
**** Or graphene/copperhead
* DMV gave us the run around a couple times
** Their site is not accurate, sadly.
** Difficult time proving residence given their timestamp requirements. Unfortunately, we're racing against car insurer.
** No way for us to drive the car, sadly. Still, we'll get there. I'm glad to have it.
** Probably spent at least an hour driving. 
** It was recommended that we show up twice more rather than trying to push registration through on same day (can but won't be solved on their end because of incompetence/monopoly/funding problems...but, no we'll send our best and brightest to help build the private sector and improve the lives of the wealthy).
** Looks like it will be yet another week.
*** And, perhaps she'll have to cut into a day with PTO for the license.
* Date!
** Pizza. 
** I think we are both feeling off, disappointed in the jankiness of this month too.
*** Grateful that it hasn't been worse, and it easily could have been catastrophic.
* //Psych//
** Nap. No idea how long I slept.
* Read
* Dialecture
* Made curry and brownies with offspring
* Chess Network
