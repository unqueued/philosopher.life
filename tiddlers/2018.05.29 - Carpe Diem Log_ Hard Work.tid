title: 2018.05.29 - Carpe Diem Log: Hard Work

* Woke at 8 in bed
** I had major dreams about my wiki, socialism, and AI. I am increasingly convinced everyone should be introspective in this way.
* Fireman Time!
* Checked on chilluns
* Read+Write
* Cleaned up my area, tools, etc.
* Talked with JRE
** He seems to be feeling anxious about his job, life productivity, and relationships. I wish I could give him an answer. I'm not even sure I understand what he is anxious about. I tried to figure that out. I may have failed.
* Called Charlie
* Read+Write
** I pushed very hard
** One of the nastier headaches I've had.
* Made burgers, fries. It was nice. =)
* Tried to chill, as my wife commanded. I'd say I did poorly at it. I will try harder at chilling! =)
