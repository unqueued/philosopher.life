title: 2019.05.21 - Prompted Introspection: Walk & Talk

!! Tell about something that you and your siblings do together now.

We walk and talk on our phones. My brother [[JRE]] and I have paths in our homes and around our neighborhoods we walk while we talk. We talk to each other while we are out and about too, but I notice more and more we spend our homelife time with each other. I grew up thinking remote relationships were fundamentally lacking, and while I wish I could hug my brother at least twice a day as I do with the rest of my immediate family, I think the bulk of our relationship and shared [[Humanity]] is quite functional even over the wire.

[[YSB]], walking is important to the talking. I don't get to read my brother's wiki, but I get to know him and how his life is going about every other day. We average communication about every other day! I think talking with my brother is my favorite thing to do with my him. Our other activities, while fun and interesting, are simply secondary.

I don't have the opportunity to speak in depth with many people. He's a [[gem]]<<ref "g">> of my life.
