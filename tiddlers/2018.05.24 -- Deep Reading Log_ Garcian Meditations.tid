title: 2018.05.24 -- Deep Reading Log: Garcian Meditations

Here I once again wrestle with my teacher's (Jon Cogburn's) work. Let me see if I have anything to say on the matter.

"I no longer see the thing, but only see either that which is the thing or that which the thing is." (FO 130)

-- Cogburn, Garcian Meditations, pg. 14

Perhaps you are talking about the difference between bottom-up reasoning of the autist and top-down reasoning of the schizophrenic. We have access to the percepts or the model of the percepts, but never both to the N^^th^^ degree at the same time, the Bayesian perfection, the limit of certainty.

<<<
Our explanations of an object's parts or the relations that the object enters into always leave something out.

-- Cogburn, Garcian Meditations, pg. 14
<<<

That is because we are finite and cannot compute the infinigressing dialectic between the autist and the schizophrenic into a unified singularity of knowledge. We ultimately cannot wrap our minds around a true contradiction that only the Inconceivable Computer can.

<<<
Garcia and Harman's principal anti-reductionist claim is first and foremost about the limits of predictive explanation. Good undermining and overmining explanations help us to predict the way given systems will evolve. For example, my intuitive understanding of human psychology grants me knowledge that it isnot a good idea to pester one of my collegues about modal logic when he is scowling. Asking him questions during scowling periods reliably fails to yield help.

Predictive explanation is Reliabilist, Probabilistic Inferentialism, i.e. Bayesian Externalism, right? Yeah, Dr. Roland scowled a lot with me. I suppose that's why I covered modal logic with you, Cogburn. I'm grateful to have experienced his scowls, none-the-less.
