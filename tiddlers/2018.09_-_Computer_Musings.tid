!! Audit:

* Oh, indeed: Fuck Spectrum!
* My wife woke me up one morning to ask why my tablet was submerged in water. Well, I just curious how long it would take to die in the water. I thought it would very quickly die, but it took many hours.
* I talk about my past more than usual here. It's not just gibberish; there are stories, lol.
* I made a serious mistake on Manjaro, I believe, though I'm not sure what it is...I couldn't pinpoint it. Python ecosystems weren't always functioning for me this month. I feel like an idiot. 
* We've had some device/part deaths this month. It's not been a difficult computing time for me though. In fact, I've barely worked on computing at all, lol.
