Trick or treat at the campground, while I bank fished the low water of lake Cumberland.
OCT 22 7:43 PM
Last weekend.
OCT 22 7:43 PM
Did yall do anything fun, and how are you?
OCT 22 7:43 PM
Looks like you all had a good time. =)
OCT 22 7:48 PM
I did. It was mentally better than most. I did not participate in the trick or treat frenzy. I was on the lake with fishing gear, golf cart and guitar. My wife took those pics.
OCT 22 7:49 PM
Lowered my stress substantially.
OCT 22 7:49 PM
Good for your blood pressure and peace of mind.
OCT 22 7:50 PM
Not a lot of activities that match fishing in that respect.
OCT 22 7:50 PM
We did our usual weekend. 
OCT 22 7:51 PM
I have began a quest to master cat fishing in Lake Cumberland. (few people do it). Very little articles on it. Lake Cumberland is know for small mouth bass and striper fishing. I had some insight to jug fishing by my former best friends dad. And lots of pond fishing.
OCT 22 7:52 PM
I have been reading alot, learning alot, no spending alot of money, but devoting time.
OCT 22 7:53 PM
I love catfish, channel cat and I'm not fishing for trophys but I really wanna learn the art of self survival and best ways to make that happen.
OCT 22 7:54 PM
My boat lost a $400 rod and reel in a bass tournament this past weekend.... (that's nearly 1/3 the price of my entire boat)
OCT 22 7:55 PM
My boss *
OCT 22 7:55 PM
That is painful.
OCT 22 7:55 PM
I find it halarious. And insane. Who spends 400 on a fishing rod.
OCT 22 7:55 PM
Lol
OCT 22 7:56 PM
Missing the point of that hobby, no doubt.
OCT 22 7:56 PM
They have a 5 fish limit and are required to catch and release. But there are 100+ boats in these tournaments.
OCT 22 7:57 PM
I can't wrap my head around it. I have lost the desire to hunt deer. It is too easy and no thrill to me.
OCT 22 7:58 PM
But fishing is different and I really wanna be good at cat fishing.
OCT 22 7:59 PM
Sounds Romantic.
OCT 22 7:59 PM
It's interesting everyone has dad's and grandpa's that that them all they know. My grandpa taught me to cast and how how to fish in a pond behind his house. And how to clean a fish.
OCT 22 7:59 PM
But not what bait to use in certain lakes during what time of year and what depth to fish at blah blah. Everyone else has the upper hand
OCT 22 8:00 PM
Aye, I have good memories of learning to fish too.
OCT 22 8:00 PM
I like learning my research as well as trial and error. Catching a nice sized cat fish is very rewarding.
OCT 22 8:01 PM
Science.
OCT 22 8:02 PM
You should escape for a guys only fishing trip. We can actually fish instead of just drink. Lol
OCT 22 8:02 PM
It's especially pleasant when are predictive reasoning turns out to be correct.
OCT 22 8:02 PM
Ah, it's not the same for me anymore.
OCT 22 8:02 PM
How so?
OCT 22 8:03 PM
The actual process isn't interesting or fun for me. It turns out that when your predictive modeling becomes too accurate, it's not as exciting anymore. It doesn't fit on my hedonic treadmill anymore.
OCT 22 8:05 PM
Maybe it will again someday.
OCT 22 8:05 PM
Oh. When was the last time you went fishing?
OCT 22 8:06 PM
The predictive modeling is horseshit.
OCT 22 8:06 PM
Lol.
OCT 22 8:06 PM
Been several years.
OCT 22 8:06 PM
Otherwise you'd be a sponsored fisherman.
OCT 22 8:06 PM
Lmap
OCT 22 8:06 PM
Lmao*
OCT 22 8:06 PM
But I understand if it doesn't interest you.
OCT 22 8:07 PM
I think you've misunderstood my predictive modeling claim, but I can appreciate what you are saying.
OCT 22 8:07 PM
As I have grown in intersted in deer hunting.
OCT 22 8:07 PM
I make no claim to being skilled.
OCT 22 8:07 PM
(miss communication and I'm fucking with you) just playing.
OCT 22 8:08 PM
"The actual process isn't interesting or fun for me. It turns out that when your predictive modeling becomes too accurate, it's not as exciting anymore."( could be interpretated as you have mastered this skill.
OCT 22 8:09 PM
And are no longer intersted due to its lack of challenge.
OCT 22 8:10 PM
I see that. =)
OCT 22 8:10 PM
I knew you didn't me that.
OCT 22 8:10 PM
But I took theboppertunity to joke. (I tried.)
OCT 22 8:11 PM
Lol, I appreciate that too, thank you. I'm often not fun to joke with.
OCT 22 8:11 PM
And the age old phrase "that's why they call it fishing, not catching" come to mind.
OCT 22 8:12 PM
No mattwr how good you get. Sometimes nothing works.
OCT 22 8:12 PM
And I think I like that about fishing thr uncertainty and unpredictable nature leaves so much to be learned and so much just up to chance and nonsense.
OCT 22 8:13 PM
Natural Poker
OCT 22 8:14 PM
Skill and luck, both rewarding
OCT 22 8:14 PM
Much quieter
OCT 22 8:15 PM
More importantly I appreciate the opportunity to provide dinner without killing a deer by baiting or stalking. I like deer meet.
OCT 22 8:15 PM
I know alot of guys who are so tied up in the trophy. It is disgusting.
OCT 22 8:16 PM
I spent lots of winters processing deer in middle and high school for my former best friends dad. He also had a deer cooler/processing house.
OCT 22 8:17 PM
Hard to find the games most worth playing. Just got finished playing a unique private WoW server (https://project-ascension.com/).
OCT 22 8:17 PM
Friends or strangers?
OCT 22 8:17 PM
Deer meat is excellent.
OCT 22 8:17 PM
Strangers, but played with my brother.
OCT 22 8:17 PM
It is, but actually small does taste better than big bucks.
OCT 22 8:18 PM
I have too little experience to know. I've probably only had deer a dozen times. I've enjoyed it every time.
OCT 22 8:18 PM
Most wouldn't argue that. But I ate deer every night Elbow deep in processing someone's deer or skinning and gutting them. Then cooking tenderloins and checking sausage for spicy Ness.
