I am very bored
1 HR AGO
Set up a virtual machine!
1 HR AGO
Try new software out.
1 HR AGO
(read and write about it ;P)
1 HR AGO
(I keep notes about my computing; some things become so technical you can't remember everything)
1 HR AGO
I read that fake wiki page but I don't know how to use it or what to do with it
1 HR AGO
Fake wiki page?
1 HR AGO
What does fake mean?
1 HR AGO
That's what it said it was
1 HR AGO
?
1 HR AGO
Ah.
1 HR AGO
=)
1 HR AGO
Yeah, it's fake like that.
1 HR AGO
Sometimes fake things, like fictional stories, are worth thinking about.
1 HR AGO
You probably have to enjoy reading and exploring a lot to use and enjoy that wiki.
1 HR AGO
Your own words said that I ain't trying to be mean I can't figure out how to read the story
1 HR AGO
So what sounds like fun to you?

Well I used VMware and built a virtual machine and it worked with my drivers but it encodes video like crap I have it enabled in the bios too, don't know what to try next
35 MIN AGO
You'll need to setup passthrough.
34 MIN AGO
If your encoding is GPU based.
34 MIN AGO
I did
34 MIN AGO
the CPU end of things which be extremely performant.
34 MIN AGO
No it's cpu based
34 MIN AGO
You handing enough cores to it?
34 MIN AGO
Don't know I enabled 4
33 MIN AGO
Got 4 left
33 MIN AGO
The CPU instructions from the VM are passed directly to the CPU.
33 MIN AGO
on the host machine
33 MIN AGO
If it is setup correctly, you should not be able to see a significant difference.
32 MIN AGO
It does fine except for video encoding
32 MIN AGO
Right, I'm saying that should be almost identical.
32 MIN AGO
Maybe I should enable more cores
31 MIN AGO
Let me try it again fresh start might fix it
30 MIN AGO
CPUs are built for virtualization these days. It should be almost native. Try virtualbox as well.
30 MIN AGO
(VMWare has the best performance in my benchmarking of the type 2 hypervisors)
30 MIN AGO
K
29 MIN AGO
What you said
29 MIN AGO
I'll be interested to know your benchmark differences.
28 MIN AGO
I'm going to try to allocate more ram
27 MIN AGO
Too
27 MIN AGO
