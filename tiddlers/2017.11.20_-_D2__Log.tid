Drunkenly lost my Hell meph map on the sorc. Meh. Perhaps I should just explore maximizing countess. She's clearly very important, and now I have nothing to lose. 

I need a 5 socket ethereal Berserker axe for Death Runeword. It is an insane runeword for PvM, which is all I do. It would radically change at least 2-3 characters. Smiter and Frenzy are cumming rainbows at the thought, and even the Kicker and possibly Fury Druid would love it. CB is broken.
