I'm pleased to [[hear from you|Contact]], nomad. Please let me know if I can [[help]] you. I'm currently in the process of moving, and I'm sometimes not as fast as I'd like to be in correspondence.<<ref "c">> I [[hope]] you can forgive my tardiness here.

<<<
yes!! this would be fascinating!
<<<

I think so too! As usual, I don't know well enough where to begin (or to end). I've had fun searching for you in the desert. Are there particular places you'd like me to look at and wander? One common problem I face in my unfortunately disorganized communications is a non-trivial asymmetry in the rate at which I get to explore and understand [[The Other]]. Perhaps in contrast with many of my interlocutors, joyously, I think you have quite a bit of starting material for me to dig into and think about. That said: I welcome any guidance you would give me. Further, do you have any preferences for our communications or directions for our relationship? You speak with (and perhaps connect together) a great number of people, and I'd like to understand your approach.

Of course, I must ask: what questions do you have?

I'm pleasantly surprised that you cc'd the e-mail. I'll be sending the link to this letter to both of you. 

(Aidan, please free to join us. It would be my honor to speak with you as well. May there always be room for one more!)

<<<
Where are you based btw? 
<<<

I live in Johnson City, TN. I'll be moving to New Haven, CT in a couple of weeks. I think we'll live within ~2 hours of each other. That's neat. Maybe we'll have the chance to meet up as well, assuming you'd be down for it.

<<<
You are SO inspiring
<<<

That is very generous of you, high praise even. I don't think the vast majority of people would agree with you (understandably), but I'm grateful that you find something valuable in this pile of mine. I hope to be meaningfully useful. 

Relatedly, one of your lines has caught my attention especially:

<<<
...[[my ultimate objective is to learn everything I consider fundamental to existence|http://www.geo.brown.edu/geopeople/grads/Chen/]]...
<<<

Oh, this one stands out to me! I think highly of this objective and perspective. I cannot claim to be as effective as others, but I'm doing what little I can with what I have to find answers. Coming to grips with my ultimate objective has turned out to be quite difficult. I'm fairly awful at putting my finger on it. Maybe it will be a crucial area for us to explore, though I am not in your league when it comes to science. You are quite the outlier in the room. I will listen carefully.<<ref "t">>

No doubt, it is my honor to meet you, sir.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]

p.s. If it matters, I'm hardcore INTJ. Some of the most interesting people I've met over the years are INTPs. Perhaps that will be a lens for us to understand the nature of our relationship; I do not know.<<ref "o">>
