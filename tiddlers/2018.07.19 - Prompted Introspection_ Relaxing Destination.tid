title: 2018.07.19 - Prompted Introspection: Relaxing Destination

!! Where would you go to relax and why?

This is a surprisingly hard question to answer. I readily admit that relaxation is necessary. I'm also the sort who understands the ancient notion of leisure as edifying oneself in one's libre time. Often, I want to extract value out of my relaxation time. I want to go hard (although, maybe I'm delusional in thinking I'm actually going hard). I relax with my wife, veg out on shows, etc.

I do not take time to sit in silence too often. It is maddening instead of peaceful. I can't stop thinking. I'm rarely bored because I have the opportunity to direct my {[[Focus]]} to something which happily holds my attention. 

I have tried clearing my mind. It doesn't work. Maybe I've not tried enough.

In any case, relaxation is a difficult topic for me. Where would I go to relax? Preferably to sleep. At least parts of me to get relax during sleep with some effectiveness. I can never get enough sleep. Sleep is the little death, practicing for the Big One.
