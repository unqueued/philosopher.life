title: Jesus Among Secular Gods: The Countercultural Claims of Christ

My goal is to read this charitably but also critically, as I would in academia. I'm not writing a paper here, but I will be keeping commentary, as though I'm engaged in a conversation with the authors. Expect the standard quote-and-reply. If Ravi and Vince were in my class, or I in theirs, this is what I'd say.

* [[Initial Background on JASG|2018.08.11 - Deep Reading: JASG]]
** I have some worries about the authors (particularly Ravi) and the RZIM institution.
** This book is meant to be read by laypeople, but it appears more interested in persuading than teaching.
** I'm concerned this book is designed to reinforce (or even merely confirm the bias of) those who already believe rather than provide arguments which are convincing to everyone.
** I'm reminded of this: https://merionwest.com/2018/07/10/what-is-a-post-modern-conservative/

* [[JASG: Chapter 1]]
** The chapter was dishonestly uncharitable in its dissection of atheism.
** I'm disappointed by the use of rhetoric rather than valid argumentation. There were a ton of redflags in here.
** Normally I wouldn't need to be so thorough, but it's systematically wrong.
