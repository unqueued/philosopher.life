Sorry, I did have something to say, but it was late last night. Loading speed on TW sucks across the board. Node is not nearly as performant as it should be. Imho, it's one of the reasons TW can't be mainstream.

That server should be written in C++, Rust, Scala, or something fast (and maybe even safe ;P).

Also, because you are literally killing me with your jokes, I thought I should contribute ([[k0sh3k]] prods me often with them):

A few years ago, you could get air for your tires for free. Now it's a $1.50! You know why? Inflation.

yeah, I can feel my wiki getting slower the more I add to it
1 HR AGO
yeah =(
1 HR AGO
It's not significantly noticeable right now but I imagine it might be in the future
1 HR AGO
Single-file is still as fast as it gets.

I can see where devs are coming from when they write electron apps (discord is maybe the fastest electron app, I'll give it that) but idk, I've read that there are performance disadvantages compared to a native app and I can feel it

This is where I don't understand how people can choose Atom over Sublime Text -- there's such a huge difference in loading times when you first open it
1 HR AGO
Aye.
1 HR AGO
not to mention atom breaks code highlighting on super-long lines
1 HR AGO
and doesn't have a split line selection function
1 HR AGO
one of my pet peeves. :P

If I had it to do all over again, I would become an expert in Spacemacs.
1 HR AGO
I'm too old to learn that new language now.
1 HR AGO
(even though that language is older than me ;P)
1 HR AGO
vim/emacs are so foreign to me!
1 HR AGO
(that's a great joke, btw!)
1 HR AGO
Also, you thinking about joining the Discord server?
1 HR AGO
i already did ;)
1 HR AGO
totally went stealth ahah
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
idk, IRC / chatroom culture is another area that's completely alien to me
1 HR AGO
I either interact and feel like I'm being annoying/overbearing/"that person", or I interact and feel like the conversation is happening around me but not with me? so I end up just lurking haha
1 HR AGO
some people seem like naturals with it though
1 HR AGO
Yeah. I am not generally a natural with it. Still, it has a different feel that the forums.
