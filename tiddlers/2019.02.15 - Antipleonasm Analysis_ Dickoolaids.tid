Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.

Kill me, Prophet Sagan. I shall tear my clothes, put on sackcloth, sprankle myself with ashes, and wail.

Drop your Pinkerism, add in: a heap of relativistically selfish ethos, dark-triadicism epidemics, a centralization of power beyond what you've imagined, all the philosophical material you yourself lacked, a globalization you still could not have predicted, a declining infrastructure, the massive incarceration of the public, the dismantling of education, disappearing safety nets, targeted brainwashing, the ills of LSC, global warming, hyperreality, skinnerbox societies, tragedies of the commons, profound poverty, spikes in suicide rates, the loss of existential value, the commodification of everything, meaninglessness, and [[hope]]lessness. I live in a dystopia.

Nobody gives a shit about wisdom. Shall I suck the koolaid right out of your dick, sir? You are right on the money.
