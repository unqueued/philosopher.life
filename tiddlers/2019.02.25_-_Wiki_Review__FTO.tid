title: 2019.02.25 - Wiki Review: FTO

* [[2019.02.19 - AA: Ewww]]
** Why is she confused by it? I'm not so good at reading emoji. Didn't realize she was confused. This particular [[redpill]] is not comfortable to swallow. I despise that it's true.
* [[2019.02.20 - AA: Memoriam]]
** That seems like a reasonable thing to offer. Maybe it wasn't?
* [[2019.02.21 - AA: Distracted and Chasing Myself]]
** I know she dislikes nudity. The movie is amazing though.
* [[2019.02.23 - AA: Talking A Storm]]
** It's fascinating to see her decide to have me connect with her youngest daughter immediately after visiting my donors.
* [[2019.02.18 - K: Telepathy]]
** Cool to see his carpet-bombing technique. I suggest he has not learned the correct lessons from me still.
* [[2019.02.19 - K: Today]]
** Not interested.
* [[2019.02.20 - K: Target]]
** I suggest this was the story. It's an interesting way to tell it. 
* [[2019.02.21 - K: Story?]]
** Never got to hear it. I wonder what was lost in translation. I think I'm looking back through our conversations far more than he is. That's okay.
* [[2019.02.22 - K: Short]]
** I find it is easier to have a real conversation with him on weekdays.
* [[2019.02.19 - L: Refuse to Honestly Face The Music]]
** It sucks. I need to stop refusing to honestly face the music of who she is as well. 
* [[2019.02.21 - L: Honestly]]
** I just need to accept them.
* [[2019.02.22 - L: Honestly]]
** The redflags are there.
* [[2019.02.18 - JRE: Low Dose]]
** He is feeling off. =(
* [[2019.02.24 - Family Log: stuffthings]]
** My daughter is hilarious. I think I've been seeing her come out of her shell more and more...and, look...it's a goth! What is a comfortable, self-confident [[j3d1h]] going to look like? I would not want to be on the receiving end of her asswhoopin's.
* [[2019.02.24 - Self-Dialectic: AI]]
** Edited.
** GPT-2 is impressive, but it's not close enough. I still have time, I believe.
* [[2019.02.24 - Saint Plato: First Contact]]
** A moving experience to me.
* //j3d1h: Symmetry//
** Renamed. It's dated, keep it dated.
** Good news, she is finding literature.
* [[j3d1h]]
** God damnit, Bob.
* [[Saint Plato]]
** We're coming. The road to you is difficult. I have to show them the aerial survey map more effectively first.
* [[2019.02.24 - TLDR: A Car Ride]]
** I roared laughing. It is rare that someone knows exactly when to call me a pussy.
* [[2019.02.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: No Pain, No Gain]]
** I'm feeling more comfortable responding to her. Tentpegs make it easier to raise a tent. Who knew?
* [[2019.02.24 - Prompted Introspection: War]]
** Edited. `/squint` is that you [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] and [[Realpolitik Speculation]]?
* [[2019.02.24 - Wiki Review: Backpat]]
** Jung keeps popping up. Maybe he's my unconscious archetype.
* [[2019.02.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sabbath]]
** Completed.
** Of course, I took my own advice and went to sleep early that day.
* [[Be A Good Husband]]
** You are doing such a good job...Lol.
* [[2019.02.24 - Wiki Audit: Popups]]
** And, yet, it still might not work out. I'm really missing hoverlinks for the reviews alone.
* [[2019.02.24 - TDL: Never Too School]]
** I'm glad to have a particular corner to look at in their wikis.
* [[2019.02.24 - KevinKniveK: Donâ€™t Do It]]
** Glad to hear from him. I'm surprised by the 1%. He must have read a lot. His poem is excellent. =)
