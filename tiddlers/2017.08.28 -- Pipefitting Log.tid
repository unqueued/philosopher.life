title: 2017.08.28 -- Pipefitting Log

The new living room arrangement made it easier to grab my stuff and go. Wearing my new shirt and vest, and I'm hoping it will be comfortable. It looks good, and feels decent. Working in it will tell. Also, I'm not sure why the laptop didn't sync. When plugged in, it is set to not suspend. Go Sublime text editor!

Chris and I talked about the job on the way. He's really unhappy with how much rigging and ironwork he is stuck on. I've been lucky enough (and pushed for) any and all fitter type work I can get. In a way, this is excellent experience, but in another, it almost doesn't feel like a complete pipefitter experience exactly. I'll take as much and whatever I can get though. Right now, money is the key. After that, experience, networking, and understanding the lay of the land. 

I was sent straight to the major pipe section with the header alongside Chris-M. We were taking measurements, marking lines, and trying to interpret the drawings. We are going to be mounting pipe finally.

One of the giant 30" pipes rolled over without anyone touching it right next to us. That could have killed us. We did not report it because we didn't want anyone to get fired. I still may tell my foreman about it. I know one of the riggers saw it.

Break!

I ran around trying to be useful. I obviously did not understand how to help them because I did not understand the prints well enough. I was barely catching on the entire time. But, this was a conversation between a fitter of 25 years and one of 40 years. I shouldn't feel bad that I didn't understand because it was clear that they barely understood. They spent a long time trying to figure it out.

I was going to help pull a measurement we were missing to rig a piece into place. We have to do it weirdly so it doesn't roll on us. Going to fit a 90 in the air between two pieces. Don't know how far to pull off the building though, and we have to make our own measurements now. But, I didn't get to help. I was pulled off pipefitter helper duty to be the red barricade tape monitor. Ugh. Fuck that. Still, pay me $23.80 an hour to do it. Fine with me.

Lunch!

Looked for materials to build the missing part for my fitup tool. Couldn't find what I needed.

I told Dave about the falling pipe. He says he saw or knew about it (both). He apologized and said it was partially his fault. He said there was going to be a meeting about it (after all, this is near miss territority).

I pulled a couple measurements and danced around some pipe, but not much actually fitter work. Instead, I sat as the barricade monitor almost the entire time. Boring as fuck. Kill me, please.

Break!

After break, I decided to try and weasel my way out of barricade monitor work. My journeyman saw it and decided to help me out; he told me he didn't want me to do it either and gave me some fitter tasks. I marked lines for supports we were rigging+sliding underneath the 42" pipe. I didn't do muhc more than that besides push bricks.

My journeyman saw that I was having difficulty understanding the iso's we were given (since everyone is having difficulty), and he told me not to feel bad. He said it would be impossible to understand them on my first try, and that it would take years to be able to successfully navigate the world of tricks you need to know to understand them (and get passed the mistakes in the drawings themselves).
