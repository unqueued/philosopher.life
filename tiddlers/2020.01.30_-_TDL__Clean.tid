title: 2020.01.30 - TDL: Clean

* I need a place to hang our coats. 
* Let's keep cleaning. I really don't want to move again immediately, and hopefully this will help with what I think are allergies.
* Offspring must decide the meal entirely.
* Offspring should talk with their uncle.
** I also need to speak further with my daughter about the class. Seems like a good plan.
* Dining Room should be organized and prepped. Not that we have chairs and a table to eat on, but we will eventually, right? 
* Catchup on wiki, homie.
