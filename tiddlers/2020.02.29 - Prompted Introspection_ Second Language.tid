title: 2020.02.29 - Prompted Introspection: Second Language

!! Should students be required to learn a second language?

I used to think so. It depends on the student and the situation. A lot of English speakers would be better off becoming fluent in some other part of [[The Great Human Conversation]], and the global consequences of this policy could be more beneficial in some cases. I'm a fan of quant-oriented second languages too. For example, I think everyone should learn some basic symbolic logic. "Language" can be a very broad thing here, but that isn't the intention of the question. From what I can tell, learning to master new practices (which may just be languages) is necessary for becoming a virtuous agent; at that breadth of a definition of language, the answer is: yes.
