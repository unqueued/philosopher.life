Assuming SSDs ever become cheap enough per TB, I'd like to one day build a complete mirror of libgen and myanonyamouse. I may be able to work a deal out with bib and ebook.farm as well. It may be the only kind of data I really want to hoard in the end, and I'd like to be able to serve it anonymously.

I think I'd actually use a TW front end to it as well.
