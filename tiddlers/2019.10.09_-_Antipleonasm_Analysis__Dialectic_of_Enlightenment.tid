title: 2019.10.09 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Dialectic of Enlightenment

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Because too much thinking, unwavering autonomy, makes conforming to the administered world difficult and causes suffering, countless people project this suffering, which is in fact socially dictated, onto reason as such. Reason is supposed to have brought suffering and disaster into the world. The dialectic of enlightenment, which must indeed name the price of progress, all the ruin wrought by rationality in the form of increasing domination of nature, is in a sense broken off too soon, according to the model of a state of being whose blind impenetrability seems to block any way out. Thus the fact is willfully, desperately ignored that the excess of rationality, which the educated classes complain about and which they register in concepts such as mechanization, atomization, and massification, is a lack of rationality, namely the extreme form of all calculable apparatuses and means of domination at the expense of the goal, a rational human orderâ€¦ Rather than either positing rationality as an absolute or rejecting it as an absolute, reason must attempt to determine rationality itself as a moment within the totality, a moment which has admittedly become independent of this totality. Reason must become aware of its own essential natural character.

That is quite the riddled tentpeg you've got there. Reason, of course, is an [[infinigress]]ively difficult self-defining concept to analyze, all the way into [[faith]] in [[The Dialetheia]]. It's a weasel word which smuggles content and begs questions against anything. It is wielded to define normativity, purpose (or purposelessness), and the limits of anything which can be communicated. 

I agree that many people have misunderstood the cause of suffering, especially unjustified suffering. It is often the lack of reason which causes those who are reasoning to suffer extra to fix it. As //The Last Aristotelian//,<<ref "c">> I think it is the bulk of the telos of humankind. Of course, I am not claiming enlightenment thinking is all that rational, namely wise, especially not as it is traditionally wielded.

What is [[beautiful]] about this claim is that it points out how the focus upon means gives rise to a contradiction with the end. Utilitarian calculations into [[infinigress]] freeze or destroy the point of doing them; certainly, that can't be the answer the machine was aiming for in the first place. There are leaps of [[faith]] to be made, rules-of-thumb to hone, and iteratively improved voting infrastructures to reconstruct. [[TPK]] is doable.

Unfortunately, you fuck up in denying rationality as an absolute in metaphysics, conceptually, in theory. Variations of Hegelian thought which begin in assumptions of materialism, including subjectivism or constructivism, have already missed the point of Reason [[Itself]].
