title: Wiki: List Mechanics

* Numbered Lists are lexically-ordered
* I use standard bullet-points the vast majority of the time.
** Nesting is an incredibly potent tool.
* Alphabetical lists are purposely trying to show zero lexical-ordering, although lacking alphabetical order is no indication of lexical ordering.
* Bullet-points are encouraged; often they are seeds.
** Fire your Bullet-point shotgun from the hip. Remember: "Killing with the point lacks artistry, but don't let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself."
