Just sharing a simple bash script I use to quickly make a new tiddler with some default parameters and open it (in sublime text as I already set sublime text to be the default program to open .tid files) on my mac:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

TW_LOC=...EDIT THIS TO POINT TO YOUR tiddlers/ DIRECTORY...
TID_TAGS="[[TEMPORARY TID]] EDIT"
TID_TEXT="My New Tiddler Text"

if [ "$1" == "" ]; then
    TID_TITLE="temp"
else
    TID_TITLE="$1"
fi

if [ ! -f "$TW_LOC/$TID_TITLE.tid" ]; then
    echo -e "Creating new empty tiddler with name: $TID_TITLE.tid"
   
    echo -e "created:" `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S` "\nmodified:" `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S` "\ntags:$TID_TAGS\ntype: text/vnd.tiddlywiki\ntitle: $TID_TITLE\n\n$TID_TEXT" > "$TW_LOC/$TID_TITLE.tid"
   
    open "$TW_LOC/$TID_TITLE.tid"
else
    echo "Error - file with name $TID_TITLE.tid already exists."
fi
```

    * It has one optional parameter which is the title of the tiddler. 
      **  If no title is given, it just uses "temp". 
    * If the file exists, it prints an error and does nothing
    * If the file doesn't exist, a new tiddler is created in TW_LOC with configurable tags and text. 
    * It assigns UTC time to created and modified

This is very simple and in no way deals with any corner cases like titles with punctuation, etc. It has served me well for quickly jotting down notes, so I just share here in case its useful to others as well/

Best,

Diego
