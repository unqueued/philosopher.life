title: 2018.12.27 - Prompted Introspection: Inventing for Convenience

!! What one thing could you invent that would make your life easier?

I don't think I'm all that inventive. I consider myself good at sometimes coming to eventually understand systems through repetitively walking through a huge number of percepts which enable me to build increasingly accurate models (since I'm not naturally talented, it comes with hard work). I hope the approach/method of overlapping my understanding of these systems and climbing those ladders of [[hope]]  through my wiki will be my invention. 

Does this really make my life easier? Well, it depends. The usual [[gfwiwcgws]] considerations apply. What is the goal? Only then can I determine the easiest means. I suppose defining that goal is my current goal of the wiki, lol. So far, [[T42T]], [[Outopos]], and [[The Original Position]] are the practical things I can implement and invent around.
