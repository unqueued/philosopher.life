title: 2017.08.12 - Pipefitting Log

Went to the doctor. Eczema and possibly a fungal infection. Definitely stress. Got steroids injected into my butt. They gave me two different prescriptions, and we'll see 2 weeks from now.

Bought a new lunch bag. Going to be taking larger lunches. It stores my breakfast and my lunch, basically. Will have a pocket for my phone. Need to watch out for the condensation inside. No go, homie.

The flashlight is working, needed for EDWC (Everyday Work Carry) kit. My new tiny, thick, and rugged moleskine notebook will fit nicely in my pocket. It finally frees me up (went for graph paper too, which will make reasonable isometrics). 

Reorganized tools, yet again. Found a basket in the house for my EDWC for the car. I want to assemble and disassemble when I get into and out of that car. 

New wipers for the car. Dark and stormy, not so good, especially with no AC to handle the fog. 

Have a checklist of things to do. Writing them out. Will hopefully finish car mirror, prepping my meals for the week, going through our tools in the house (and making a set for my son), working on my phone, an external battery for my phone (resilio is a huge fucking whore), and anything else I can think of. I want tomorrow to be as "day of rest-like" as possible.
