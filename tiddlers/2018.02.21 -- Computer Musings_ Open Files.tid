title: 2018.02.21 -- Computer Musings: Open Files

I think deluged's problem may be that it has too many open files.

`lsof | awk '{ print $2 " " $1; }' | sort -rn | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20`

In both `/etc/systemd/system.conf` and `/etc/systemd/user.conf`, below the `[Manager]` line in each add the line:

* `DefaultLimitNOFILE=999999`

Restart!

`ulimit -a` should show `999999` for `-n` file descriptors.

Brought back fail2ban, turned off the cronjob restarting.
