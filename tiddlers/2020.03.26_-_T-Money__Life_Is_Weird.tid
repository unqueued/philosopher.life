How's your week going?
Mar 25 12:39pm

How is yours man? How are you guys?
Thu 7:31pm
Life is so weird right now... It's very hard to say how I'm doing.
Thu 7:32pm
Hey dude!
Thu 7:53pm
We're hanging in there. Been extremely busy, but not as productive as I'd like.
Thu 7:53pm
I feel like we are making progress in school and arranging our house. We've been here for 10 weeks, and everything is still having to adjust for my wife working from home.
Thu 7:54pm
Days are intense.
Thu 7:54pm
Everyone is healthy, we have food, we feel safe in a local sense, we're getting along and bonding, and we're working hard on what matters to a reasonable degree. I count myself lucky.
Thu 7:55pm
I can imagine life is exceptionally weird for you. Your transitions, unknowns, and the monkey-wrenches the world is throwing cannot be easy.
Thu 7:55pm
Yeah. I'm just rolling with the punches. Life a bitch when it's "normal days" why would this be any different! Lol
Thu 8:08pm
How's your family doing?
Thu 8:09pm
Stir crazy. But healthy and productive. We just got orders from department of defence that we are considered essential to homeland security and defense. Therefore if they state is shut down. We can continue business as usual. New job is suppose to start April 6th. They asked what airport I wanted to fly to Denver... I suspect that may change next week. I have been clear with my current work that I don't want to leave untill all things are finalized with new job. They are cool with thay.
Thu 8:12pm
That is awesome to have that kind of flexibility.
Thu 8:13pm
My boss even said if I got there and it didn't work out to call him and he would take me back. Which is reassuring. Since I am the only income as of right now.
Thu 8:14pm
Sounds like you are well-positioned.
Thu 8:15pm
I have tried. Lots of anxiety running high. But... Not much differnt than a normal day just a different senerio. I've changed jobs alot. So I have grow calloused to the process. But with everyone working from home. The transition is kinda weird. Had to get ahold of people.
Thu 8:16pm
Hard*
Thu 8:17pm
I can appreciate that.
Thu 8:17pm
I think anxiety is running higher for most people, and learning to live so close with some and so distanced from others is expensive.
Thu 8:17pm
Indeed. I see alot of presidential potential in KY current governor. He has been doing very well.
Thu 8:19pm
What are you liking most about what he's doing?
Thu 8:21pm
The calm tone and disposition during his daily briefings. The reassurance to his constiuants. His demeanor is awesome.
Thu 8:39pm
I can appreciate how a calm demeanor can be useful.
