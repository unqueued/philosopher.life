title: 2019.10.12 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Go Figure

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I work for the army, we are well paid, have fully subsidized health care, pensions, 401k with 5% matching, free college, affordable child day care, free car pooling, reasonable amount of annual and sick leave, federal credit unions, and everyone is hardcore republican anti-socialist. Go figure.
<<<

That's about the tip of the moral<<ref "w">> I find among those currently, openly, and directly employed by the military-industrial-complex. They have a lot of benefits which aren't listed here:

* 3 hots and a cot
* Excellent training
* Travel
* Unmatched injury compensation
* Veterans have many institutions devoted to them.
* Vets are given priority outside of the military for finding jobs and climbing other social ladders. Clearances make this even easier.
* The public (particularly a fanatical core) support them all the way down into the invisible ties, emotes, and instances of nepotism. 
* etc.

The ignorance in the quote is ironic; this person is still anti-socialist. To go any further would require them to recognize the very work they do is evil though. Socialism is the radical decentralization of [[power]]. For example, if the workers don't own the means of production, you don't have you a socialism. Democratic socialism is muzzled neoliberalism with less psychopathy toward their ingroup. Make no mistake: the US military memetically and materially exists to prevent socialism everywhere, including domestic revolution. Their vocation, unjustified systematic violence, is a crime against [[Humanity]]. These class traitors have devoted their lives to oppressing the masses in the name of Nationalized Capitalist "justice." They've sold their souls for convenience. They are pure garbage. Your enemies have you outgunned on this prison planet. 

The army, as it stands, is a great vidya game for sociopaths w/ real-life benefits. Let us take a moment of silence to honor them;<<ref "a">> they are righteous humans.
