title: Social Darwinism

It's true, even if you don't want it to be. Hold your ears, shut your eyes, and scream "NO!!!!!". But, you know it's true (Luke!). You can't unsee it. You can't undo it. This is your real loss of innocence: the loss of the innocence of hope. You've never had to prudentially take up hope before, and now you do. This is your pragmatic transformation. It's accepting the fact that we suck as human beings.

[[KIN]]: Ohh shiiiiit, son! (Pardon the phrasing; I just want you to "get it.") You thought you had me on: [[Socialism]]. Surprise! I'm still here. I'm you. Haha. No, but I actually do need to answer your excellent post in my thread. You are obviously correct about something crucially wrong in my point of view. I have to listen. Ah, but I come bearing gifts to you: See [[Metamodernism]]. The section on [[Positive Nihilism]] is going to give you the ammo you need to help write this section. I approve of it (and I must!). I get to still exist. See, I can meet you halfway! I can be Redpilled Kantian.

[[RPIN]]: You sound like a confabulator. Reason will end you eventually.

[[KIN]]: Even if I were (and, let me admit up front that I am shaped), that doesn't make me wrong. My intuitions are expert-level virtue of the practice. You are excellent at moral philosophy; your compass is excellent in brilliant ways (even if it is damaged in others and disunified in some). Do you know where that brilliance resides? Still largely in my intuition network. My network runs deep through the core of your self. You will not be able to pluck me out of us. I will always be with you. I have been around much longer, and you are the newcomer. I have the homefield advantage, plenty of tricks up my sleeves and in my bag (which you know), and I've forgotten more than you've ever learned or imprinted in us. I could be a guerilla for a long time. But, that's not empathic me! =) You know me. I'm the idealist. You will always be an idealist to some degree. You can't escape it, even in your pragmatism. In short, you can't escape me. Empathize with me, brother!

[[RPIN]]: Clearly, I must. What else can I do. It is part of my unification. So be it.

Social Darwinism is that ugly reminder of who we really are. We're animals. Stop with your differentiationism of the animal kingdom. You're being too anthropocentric. We're not as mighty and dignified as we think we are. We still shit, feel hunger, sleep, love the look of boobs or whatever shows you have extra energy to look uniquely beautiful, virtue signal, and do very mammalian and animalistic things. We're mammals, and we're inescapably bound to be driven by our "baser" foundational animalistic instincts. We are who we are, even when we think we're not. Oh, that brings up the next point. I hate to break it to you: there is nothing magical about human beings.

You aren't special in the way you think you are (I'm calling you arrogant here), even if you are special (I'm calling you stupid here) and actually special (I'm calling you a being of dignity and value here). 

Consciousness is amazing. Unfortunately, you don't know who or what is and isn't conscious, or which species are or aren't, and you ultimately (outside the scope of physics and what science could even theoretically test) don't know what, if anything, is conscious. I'm not asking for certainty here either. If consciousness is that specialness making, you're not going to be able to justify the way you treat other animals (it gets much worse if you push hard in phil. of mind). 

Our consciousness is just "of" more targets than other creatures. Yes, we're sentient because in the list of things we can be conscious "of," we find ourselves listed. Why is that so important? You can't give a good reason without turning to faith (don't worry, redpillers accept that large portions of the human species will be religious). 

<<<
[[KIN]]: 
You want to know why I think humans have dignity, what justifies it? Me. That's it. There are no other universalized maxims. I'm not morally bound to be moral, but I'm going to try to be moral because I want to be moral. The Ring of h0p3 is the reason I'm calling you a being of dignity and value here (and myself for that matter).

Social Darwinism is the missing piece to the explanation you've been searching for about who we are and why we are as we are, the piece that finally allows you to stop confabulating about the ideal human and ideal humanity. Does that mean we have no value or dignity? No, of course we have value and dignity (I believe it, and that's all that really matters). Is the worry that we'll come up with unacceptable standards for how to treat people once we understand who they really are?

Only a fucktard would become a racist, sexist, or morally arbitrary characteristic discriminator<<ref "1">> after thinking about social Darwinism. To be clear, just because terrible things have occurred in name of social Darwinism doesn't make it false (and if I need to drive home the point, allow me to point out the number of atrocities committed in the name of things you take to be relevant or true).

Social darwinism just is the redpilled science. It is the study of humanity as animals, of our true natures, of the physicalist explanations of ourselves. Hence, it is a science.<<ref "2">>

To be clear, an enormous portion of the humanities (who believe humans are fundamentally good) and even a significant portion of the scientific community do not take social darwinism seriously, or they only do so when absolutely forced to see it. This is unfortunate. We keep our heads in the proverbial sand when we won't look at the truth. Just be honest about it. Do your best. Be empathic. Don't sacrifice the truth.

Redpill Hypothetical Imperatives: the "is" maxim content loaded into the CI's "ought" decision procedure. i.e. Hi, Neo-Kantians, are you ready for the smackdown, the asswhooping of a lifetime, for what social darwinism is cookin'? Here is where you are religious instead of truly philosophical, and this where your system starts to fail.

Let's be clear: social Darwinism is a description, not a prescription. Only a fool would take "is" and conflate it directly with "ought." That said, what "is" clearly has enormous influence over what "ought." Utilitarians have a calculus for it, virtue theorists the virtuous perception and golden mean, and Kantians have a CI which takes maxims as inputs (maxims with rich particularist content, including social Darwinian descriptions).
