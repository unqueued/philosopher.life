title: 2017.06.15 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.06.14 - Carpe Diem Log]]
** I'm glad I do this bullet-pointed rather than in more narrative form as I do for the Pipefitting Log. 
* [[2017.06.14 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** Almost a throwaway question. But, in a way, I'm spending my time solidifying my new redpilled outlook on life through these questions. Some are more straightforward than others to answer.
* [[2017.06.14 - Diet Log]]
** Filling the EQ void. 
* [[2017.06.14 - Wiki Review Log]]
** Yup. Keep it up! Never give up!
