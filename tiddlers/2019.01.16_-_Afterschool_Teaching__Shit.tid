title: 2019.01.16 - Afterschool Teaching: Shit

Today has been pretty awful. We did get a shipment of food, and that's when the snack lady inspector comes. It's fascinating to see the timing. She was expected to come earlier, but we were running on fumes. They only buy food once every 2 months, and it is expected to last. I see 3 weeks of food. The inspector knew my name. I'm glad I had done all that was required of me. She was chewing others out.

She complained that we hadn't given two portions, which is required by state. That's hilarious considering how we aren't given enough resources to even do a single portion. She had us correct "our" error. She is clearly a paperpusher.

In fact, that is the goal of this institution. It justifies itself through paperwork which paints false pictures, externalizes liabilities, and builds enough bureaucratic layers that nothing can penetrate it.

For example, we had to make our own copies of their report cards for our own paperwork (which was pointless). Mind you: we are babysitting. Our goal is to make as much paperwork as we can to "prove" something that isn't actually happening at all. That is pure simulation. I can see the structure rise well above me. Of course, all the liability is shifted to us. 

Matt showed up an hour late. He complained on behalf of other complainers. The power trip is excellent. He also just sits in the office now; paperpusher rising through the ranks. I have been handed the worst of the bunch solo, and three other adults handle the easy crowd. The kids were poorly behaved today, but I was able to get most of them to finish their homework. 5LL, 5NP, and 5NcP were monsters. I'm using the tools at my disposal. They lie constantly; I thought my children were liars, but holy fuck, this is the next level. 

I have a cop just sitting in front of me. He's cordial and stupid enough. Fine by me. I had to sit quietly as the adults in the room spoke about how much they love President Trump. I'm not fucking joking. The cop commented that I am the silent type that he wouldn't want to mess with; he said my focus was like a laser in the conversation. Lol. I know what this means.

Matt continues to insist that one of his primary duties is to ensure nobody has any sexual thoughts, discussions, or can even openly admit it.

At the end of the day, I discussed the inspection with Matt and Whitney. I realize Matt thinks I'm his competition and don't align with his worldview. He continued to attempt to dodge the issue (trying to act like there was nothing wrong about it...he hopes to be one of these people), but I'm mean in the dialectic. `/shrug`. 

I told the extended adolescents (those frontal lobes are still developing...poorly) they were doing good work after making the point of how those above us did not as I was leaving. Hilariously, Matt felt I usurped him and attempted to wrestle the position back (it was cute). I'm glad he heard me.

I suggest there is a non-trivial chance the manboy will attempt to get rid of me; this is his town, his school, etc. He charmed our supervisor to get rid of the last person (oh no, she was "weird"). My credentials and Delp will still mean something for a while.
