This is a shot in the dark. `/gulp`

Hi, I'm [h0p3](https://philosopher.life/#h0p3). No, no! Please, don't run away! I'm sorry I frightened you. I mean you no harm. If you have the time: I just want to talk. I'm sorry that I smell so bad, that my face is so ugly or scary, that I look and sound mean, and that I'm really weird (perhaps much weirder than you feel comfortable being around normally). I just want to be your friend! Yes, I'm a little crazy, but that doesn't mean I'm not worth your time. It's lonely out here in the desert, nomad. Let us [talk](https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3) and get to know each [other](https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others). 

Too slowly, I have learned that conversations are a sacrament. Let us break bread together. The world needs us to be empathic enough to engage in sustained long-form conversations. I want to penpal with you over my wiki. It is my privilege to speak with you for a few minutes or a few decades. At the very least, I assume I can be a source of amusement to you, like a clown or a jester. I [hope](https://philosopher.life/#hope) we build something so much more than that though.

I suppose I should start out by telling you some standard things about myself. Who am I? Hrmmm,「(°ヘ°). I'm still trying to work that one out of and for myself. [Labeling](https://philosopher.life/#Alias) ourselves and [Modeling](https://philosopher.life/#Public%20Self-Modelers) each other's minds isn't so easy, but it is our plight. Well, this list might not make a ton of sense at first, but it's a pretty quick way to enscapsulate me:

* a biological computer based on axioms and ruled by laws.
* a xennial, American, highly-educated, working class, cosmopolitan.
* the husband of k0sh3k, father of j3d1h and 1uxb0x.
* a pipefitter, teacher, amateur computer scientist, philosopher, and recovering academic.
* a grey hat computer zealot, socialist freedom fighter, monkeywrencher, renegade thinker, and guerrilla librarian.
* autistic, depressed, anxious, obsessive, emotionally scarred, lonely, hikikomori, entangled in a volatile fight-or-flight response cycle toward the world.
* a neurotribally alien human being who likes most people less and less the more he gets to know them.
* a poor, broken man, and a box of contradictions, with few options, a chip on my shoulder, and a bleak outlook.
* a reality junkie, cynical skeptic, (moral perfectionistic) idealist, contemplative psychonaut, and introspectionist with a sensitive moral compass.
* a hermetic hermit lost in the desert, voraciously hungry for mythemal fruits from the Trees of Life and Knowledge, wrestling with himself and the transcendental.
* seeking to be as excellent as practically possible, integrated, well-constituted, unified, empathic, authentic, knowledgeable, enlightened, justified, useful and productive, acceptable if not worthy, and happy.
* Externalist, Platonist, Marxist, Rawlsian, Computationalist, Mystic, existential-skiddie.
* finding himself; finding h0p3.

I try to capture a clearer, more organized, and much larger picture in my wiki (hey, let me know if you want to set one up too; I'm happy to help you). Maybe it's confusing (it is for all too often). For lack of a better term, I'm trying to upload my mind into [my wiki](https://philosopher.life/). You can determine for yourself whether or not you want to be friends with me using the best information I could possibly give you. Be patient, please. It will take a moment to load (or a minute if you connection isn't so great) because it's not a small wiki (currently ~30MB of almost pure hypertext, or ~60 novels, categorized and very searchable). Please let me know if I can [help](https://philosopher.life/#Help%3A%20On%20This%20Wiki) you.

Real friends are hard to find. I'm excited to hear from you.
