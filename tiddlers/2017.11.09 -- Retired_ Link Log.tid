!! About:

//Where my long-term drug-use transforms into a demonstration of my confirmation bias before your very eyes.//

For better or worse, digital //pharmakeia// (drug use) is a fundamental force in my life. I have mastered many digital practices, including curation and hyper-reading the web. Here I document much of my practice.

I think I'm an exceptional link and tool aggregator.<<ref "1">> My taste is impeccable. I have so much hipster style (suck it). Yeah, I'm pretty cool, man. I was an internet addict long before even using the internet on a weekly basis was socially acceptable. I'm literally an autistic savant with roughly ~50,000 hours spent on the interwebs.<<ref "2">> I do not exaggerate when I tell you that I am virtuous at the practice of using this drug.

I'm pretty fucking OG. I've been around the block, there and back again, and have forgotten more than you will ever know. You could never catch up to me even if you wanted to. You will never see what I have seen, explore the dead roads I've been down, or experience The Stack exponentially grow as I have. Oh, the stories I could tell ya, young'n. I'll learn you somef'n yet, chill'n.

I am an expert witness of this network.<<ref "3">> I'm what you might call "well-read" in this domain. Here I get to be a gatekeeper because I am a Grandmaster.<<ref "4">> I'm an internet guardian, protecting the sacred grounds from intruders. Get off my lawn! 

I'm an internet scholar in addition to being a philosopher. I'm still a low-class user just like you, but with more time and willpower (or lack thereof) on his hands. =) Surely, you must fall on your knees before this delusional manchild internet addict. 

You are so very welcome to the fruits of my labor. With my virtuous perception, I pick out the morally salient features of the web on a daily basis. Come, partake with me. Take a hit.

Lol.

No, but for real,  I am always sifting through the sands of the internet for diamonds. Even when you become adept at turning and tuning your signal-to-noise ratio up as high as you can in a constantly evolving landscape, most of what you see is still bullshit.<<ref "5">> You're happy to have seen many things, but they usually have a single-use appeal to them. Some links are worth keeping though, and some moreso than others. Furthermore, it's important to document your information sources, your consumption habits, and the inferences you make about this flood of data. Normally, I just bookmark them in my browser.<<ref "6">> Since I'm trying to centralize my data and maintain control of it, I'm going to try to migrate that bookmarking data and my daily curation practices to the wiki instead. 

For now, I won't worry about trying to categorize it. Although, ideally, I would get there. That is really its own giant project. Right now, I'm taking baby steps, one droplet at a time. Bit by bit, byte by byte.

<<footnotes "6" "Unfortunately, for my first decade, I barely even bookmarked (not that they would have survived linkrot, and thewaybackmachine.org was a blip; browsers were also very rudimentary). I memorized the URL, IP, or even how I got to a location. I didn't realize it would be worth cataloging. Even the bookmarks I had were lost because I didn't take the time to transfer/sync them to my new machines. Much progress has been lost because it wasn't recorded. Although, even those things which I didn't bookmark ultimately played into how I thought about and used the internet (and perhaps life in general).">>
