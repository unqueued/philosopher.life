House is an ironic-doctrinaire mix of right-brained intuition, left-brained statistical skepticism, and a complex-but-black-and-white moral compass. The fact that most of us understand absolutely nothing of the medical jargon in the show underlines the fact that House’s appeal lies at a doctrinal level.
<<<

Yes.

<<<
Trust your right-brained pattern-spotting. Be a skeptical, data-driven empiricist. Add a moral compass. Tie it all together with storytelling. Be aware of, and exploit, the flawed doctrines of others. Do not be concerned about the morality of this: doctrinal flaws provide the moral justification for their own exploitation.<<ref "2019.03.26">>
<<<

Ah. I feel like I have the first half. The exploitation, however, I do not have in me. One day I might, but I don't see it. It is exceptionally Libertarian though. Why should I not be concerned about it? It will drive me insane not to use people as they clearly use me. Is this really the only way to be happy? 

What kind of exploitation? Escaping from doctrines because of their flaws is a kind of exploitation that I find moral. But, using others based upon their beliefs not so much, except insofar as those beliefs are flawed and I have profound ends. Wearing makeup is kind of like that. Manipulation is morally obligated in some cases, but I fear I will cross a line I've no right to. I just don't see it.

The quora question is worth thinking about.

You then sort out three types of model building blocks in the phenomenology: dynamics, constraints and boundary conditions (technically all three are varieties of constraints, but never mind that).

Omg, he's doing philosophy again! Yay!

<<<
So I operate by the vague heuristic that if I pay attention to things on the edge of the mainstream, ranging from motorcycle gangs to extreme couponers and hoarders, perhaps I can make more credible progress on big and difficult problems.

Or at least, that’s the leap of faith I make in most of my thinking.
<<<

Ah, I see. Yes, sir. You are correct. How else can you see the outline of things, the change? The essence of the thing itself can only be revealed after you have a form. You aren't looking to be well-rounded in any mainstream sense. You're only going to get the same wrong answers that everyone else gets in that arena. You must throw [[/b/]] magic into it. You need randomness, edges, and the unexpected. Insight sometimes can only come from left field.

Why do you think I'm even reading [[Ribbonfarm]]? Ribbonfarm is actually Alt-Right (although, incredibly genius compared to most alt-right work). It's worth our time. Intellectual integrity is very much about looking at the corner cases. One must be antipleonasmic, find the shortcuts, etc. This is just that.
