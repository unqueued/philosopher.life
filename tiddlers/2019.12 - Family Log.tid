!! Audit:

* Uh, we forgot to do a [[Family Log]]!
** Fuck. I'm surprised we missed one. Hrm. Not on my machine. [[j3d1h]] is the only likely person to have a copy if we did it.
* Bliss is, ofc, amazing. I've been fine without it though, calmer, and without racing nearly as much.
* So many goodbyes. It was rushed.
** I don't know how many of my relationships are going to last. =/
*** People thinking //reading// is expensive. My goodness, writing is wildly more expensive.
* I'm so grateful we had a vacation as an eye of the storm. 
** It completed many things for us.
** It gave us a great deal to speak about.
** It was relaxing (though intense).
* We are as awful as ever at completing our goals. Lol.
