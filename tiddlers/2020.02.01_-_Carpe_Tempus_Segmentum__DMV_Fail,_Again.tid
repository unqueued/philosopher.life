title: 2020.02.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: DMV Fail, Again

* Woke at 8:30?
** Nope. Not even close. 
* DMV
** Waited for a long time. Interesting room to be in. 
*** Noise gets to me these days, but the people-watching is interesting. 
**** I like those times when I see another people-watcher. They get an eye-brow and a smile.
** Donuts
** We had the exact documentation. Same man saw it, and he apologized. We did everything right he said, and it didn't matter. Uh, fuck, dude. C'mon.
*** My wife was pissed. I was so tired, it blew by me. I could only comfort.
*** It's so weird what they take to proof of residence. Common sense evidential reasoning would be noice, but even the policy is absurd here. Lease, renter's insurance, non-dated mail from plenty of institutions, etc. were no go. 
**** He advised us to send ourselves mail from different return addresses, since that was the "sure-fire" way to guarantee it quickly. Wat. Rofl. 
**** Even the proof from USPS themselves wasn't good enough! 
*** I've never had this much trouble before. This is crazy. My assumption is that post 9/11, we're seeing a giant squeeze, especially in a wealthy per capita state like CT which actively wants to dissuade people from living here.
** Hail Mary, we drove to another DMV (recommended). They don't do driver's licenses? Lol. But, they do registrations. The officer told us to head to another, and he thought we'd make it back in time. He wasn't paying attention to the clock.
** Well, we are getting our butts kicked by some dumbshit. Alrighty then.
*** We gave up on the day after that. Lol.
* Nap.
** So grateful.
* My wife is my hero. During my nap, she secured more time for us and finished autopays.
* Offspring tasked.
* Date
** Sushi. Expensive AF. Pretty amazing though. I'll probably eat only straight sashimi and eel the next time. I'm there to eat trustworthy raw fish. It's that simple.
** I think it made the day all better.
* Talked briefly with [[JRE]].
** Said he would call me right back, but he didn't. =/. Welp, man has a baby. I bet his night got busy quickly.
* Nap
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Uncomfortable sleep by 3?
