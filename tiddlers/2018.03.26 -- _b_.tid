I am not convinced that people generally do the right thing for the right reason. Thus, I believe vegetarians and vegans are generally merely virtue signalling with no other substance beyond it. I am a differentiationist as well. Refraining from eating animal product is much easier to signal than refraining from capitalist tendencies.
