Itâ€™s going. Got a surprise presentation dropped on me yesterday and no time to work on it. The usual. ðŸ‘€

How are you?
OCT 18 12:38 PM
Yikes. Sorry man.
OCT 18 12:39 PM
That is no fun. 
OCT 18 12:39 PM
I'm good. Not much sleep, but plenty of thinking.
OCT 18 12:39 PM
Good to hear! Got any fun plans for the weekend?

Mostly just thinking. I've been ruminating on and constructing my letter to DeathOfRobinhood. It has been expensive to think about and write.

Charitably exploring my paranoia as usual, lol. =)

Thatâ€™s a massive mood. Haha

I need an extra day in the week. I have a short story brewing and no time to do it.
OCT 18 1:01 PM
Lots of cool ideas tho

Preach. We need a genie.

Oh, I have a show recommendation (which you may have already seen): //The Boys//
OCT 18 1:01 PM
Iâ€™ve heard itâ€™s good! Worth bumping to the top?

It is the best superhero show I have ever seen. It might be stronger than Deadpool (it's certainly more rewatchable). 
OCT 18 1:03 PM
But, I do not know how much you will like it. My brother told me about it several times and it sat in queue for a long time. I'm glad he recommended it, so I'm just passing it along.

If you need a copy, lemme know. I can push over our sync.
