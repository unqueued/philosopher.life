title: McManus: Post-Modern Trumpism and Loneliness: The Rise of Vulgar Authoritarianism

http://newpol.org/content/postmodern-trumpism-and-loneliness-rise-vulgar-authoritarianism

<<<
 Modern Germans were lonely
<<<

That could just be a re-expression of what it means for power to centralize, for communities to dissipate, for the spread of distrust, etc. Chicken or egg, possibly. It's a clean correlation though, I do not deny it.

<<<
 the appeal of hard right movements to lonely individuals.
<<<

Abused, gaslit, learned helplessness, outgrouping harder and harder. I've lived with these people for most of my life. I think a lot of them know something is really fucked up, but they just don't know where to point the fingers. 

<<<
It seems strange today to think of how anyone could be lonely. Technology, especially telecommunications and the internet, have brought about a global village where billions of people can interconnect with one another in an instant. 
<<<

Despite our efforts, we still know the names of only a couple of our neighbors. We initiate [[T42T]] often enough, but it doesn't matter. I actually think it is a global moral failing (obviously, those in power are the most responsible). Convincing people not to be selfish turns out to be a really hard thing to do; we really could succeed though ([[ridtyawtr]]).

Virtual vulnerability is just radically different than being in person where your mirror neurons are firing off towards even the mechanical aspects of the human sitting in front of you. Empathy in the 21st Century is much harder.

<<<
Moreover, the economy is booming. After a recessionary dip in the last 2000s, the 2010s have seen recovery and job expansion in the United States and many other OECD countries.
<<<

Booming for whom? You and I may have serious disagreements over employment numbers and their meanings. 

<<<
Any yet hard right movements like Trumpism thrive because people say they are deeply anxious and losing their country. They feel alienated and like they no longer connect with their communities. 
<<<

Losing their status, identity, etc. People really do think they are better than others and deserve more. People dehumanize because it's convenient. I'm always amazed by people who stop looking at the news because it makes them sad. They really don't want to feel the pain of others to the point that they'd rather ignore reality.

Binding together the alienated is exactly what the Left must do. It simply costs more cognitive and affective load, especially when you've been brainwashed, to internalize Leftism. The local vs. global computation is simply much harder for the Leftist (though, they are more accurate, imho).

<<<
capitalism-for all its variations-has an uncanny ability to transform societies by liquidating barriers, including moral barriers, to the pursuit of profit.
<<<

Preach.

<<<
In effect, capitalism produces social difference by encouraging people to express their individuality through consumption. 
<<<

Agree to the spirit, but I want to say that opportunity costs are just that. I'm open to the possibility that choice just is consumption of our resources/time/energy toward a particular end. That's not what is usually meant by the term.

<<<
Far from being an ally of traditional, “Christian,” society, it has demolished even the possibility of tradition. And it will continue to do so at an accelerating rate.
<<<

Capitalism IS the tradition. Escaping the State of Nature and practicing [[The Golden Rule]] is likely historically quite rare.

<<<
 The vulgar authoritarianism of Trumpism is the result of these radical trends in our society.
<<<

Fair enough. Defeating authoritarianism while maintaining an effective Rule of Law built on decentralized power is a very hard problem for us all, of course.
