* Woke at 7:30ish
* Woke kids for school
* Read+Write
* Just doing a daily Annihilus Charm run after leaving D2 on overnight<<ref "2018.12.24">>
* Also, the market just crashed on cryptocurrency. I had a feeling it would. Glad I got out just in time. The risk wasn't worth it to me. 
** But, now I'm tempted to invest once it bottoms and flatlines.
* Paid off car
** Need to get paperwork done.
* Picked up packages.
* Bought presents for my extended fam
** Knickknacks 
* Picked up wife, we made Fish stirfry

** My wife forced me to stop take my kids out onto the rink to practice. My kids are too scared to learn. I'm failing them in taking calculated risks, expecting pain and bearing through it. 
* Inform the Men!
* Office and couch.
