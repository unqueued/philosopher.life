title: Rust: Conventions & Stylistic Idioms
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!! Thaw / Frozen:

You should comment about mutability and ownership.

```cpp
let x = some_value;
...
let mut x = x; // temporarily mutable, "thawed"
...
let x = x; // no longer mutable, "frozen"
```

!! Whitespace for Chained Methods:

When you call more than one method with the .foo() syntax, introduce a newline and other whitespace to help break up long lines. 

```cpp
io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
           .expect("Failed to read line");

// Write in the style above instead of below:

io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
```

!! Constant Naming Convention:

Rust constant naming convention is to use all upper case with underscores between words

```cpp
const MAX_CORES: u32 = 8;
```

!! Snake Case

Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names. In snake case, all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.

```cpp
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```
