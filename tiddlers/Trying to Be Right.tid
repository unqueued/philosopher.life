title: Trying to Be Right

Family of Arguments: [ [[Arguing Against Reason]] ] -=- [ [[Less Wrong]] ] -=- [ [[Doing Our Best]] ] -=- [ [[My Purpose]] ]

Doing your best just is the definition of rightness. Do your best since it is the best you can do (beautiful circularity).

----------------------------

I have been told many times that I need to stop trying to be right. I suspect this is an attempt to prevent me from thinking on my own and from disagreeing with them. Perhaps it is a plea got something else (call me out on a strawman, but steelman my argument as well); they didn't say it well though (and I'll show you why).
Can you be wrong in trying to be right? Sure. We can say you didn't "try to be right" in the right way, or i.e. you failed to be right. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try to be right.

Trying to be right is aiming for excellence (//arête//) against some standard of the good of X, the F-ness of a practice. 

Is "trying to be right" aiming for perfection? Not directly in any maximally ideal sense (as a final end, a final goal, yes, but we quickly must realize that only partial perfection is possible for us). We aren't ideal (we are finite, fallible, etc.), and thus it wouldn't be practical to aim for ideal perfection. But, whatever is practical for us generates a line of maximum potential (each passing moment, experience, and modification of our lives may result in this line moving). The goal is to reach our maximum potential, to be excellent in context. If that isn't the telos, then why be excellent? Why be right? What are we aiming for? How is that not a new kind of "right" to aim for?

The problem is intractable. You must beg the question. Not caring about "being right" results in much higher degrees of logical inconsistency, disintegration (to some extent), and frankly gives you no metric or method to find happiness. If happiness is your telos, then you do care about being right. If you were to care about what God says, then you do care about being right. If you care about anything, then you do care about being right, being right towards, being right with, acting rightly, thinking rightly, etc.

Are you really right when you say I'm trying too hard to be right? How hard are you trying to be right, and why? Isn't it obvious that there are fundamental things we have to try hard to be right about? Don't you see the very concept of morality, of the normative, of the Right? 

Try to be right. It is obviously an axiom (even the very concept of axiom begs the question). 

Here is a not put-enough-together argument, which is sad considering how long I've been working on it (it is a long told philosophical story running through many cultures; we must wrestle this meme). This is my best rendition of it (which is dreadful, abysmal, and not well expressed). It is the Hermeneutic Circle I'm most worried about:

Right, Righteous, //riht//, //gath//, united, standard of unity, the Good of unity, Righteousness, //díkaios//, Righteoused, Justified.<<ref "1">> //riht//, //gath//, //arête//, and //díkaios// have fundamental links (there are many words for it), and they clearly have some crucial relationship with The Good. I know you see them. That pattern is not an accident. Plato, Aristotle, and Kant saw it deeply.

We pursue the Good.<<ref "1.1">> The Right is necessary as a means to the Good. It is our Plight to seek the Good via seeking the Right. Thus, we pursue the Right. This is the pragmatism of perfection. Doxa and Praxis must be welded together here in the "right" way.

But further, we can never have the Good in and of Itself.<<ref "2">> It is the nature of the Good that we can't hold it, that we can only partake of it. We can only dance in the whispers and shadows of the Good, and that is only by being Right. We can't be perfectly Right, and that means we can't be perfectly Good. We can't really understand the Good in its entirety by definition.<<ref "3">> We are less than, and that's okay. It is untouchable and unknowable; it is Kant's metaphysics. But even the Mighty Kant can be wrong.

Unfortunately, upon much closer inspection, after actually seeing the corners which skepticism (from Analytic, Continental, and Eastern traditions) has //rightfully// driven us into (they have shown us the boundaries, outlines, and cores), it becomes apparent that the best answers demonstrate that no system of Right (or the pursuit thereof) can be logically consistent (cannot be Right with itself). Rightness is incomplete, and it appears by definition. It's unintelligible not because we are fallible, finite, and mere mortals, but because it actually isn't conceptually possible. I pursue a thing which doesn't exist in pursuit of the Good (which may Itself simply be a construction of our minds if we do not reduce it to Instrumental Reason). I want to do a Right thing, to partake of a Good.

As much as I railed against Post-modernism before understanding it, now that I see it and realize what it is actually about, I weep. I cannot unsee it. In pursuing the Right, it is clear that my starting place made uncorrectable assumptions. I need a new foundation for pursuing the Right and Good (and maybe even those concepts must be reinterpreted, but I would have no idea where to begin and why). 

My only hope is to find a Metamodern solution. What fundamental philosophical paradigm answers postmodernism? I assure you, it is not by going backwards (although, we must very carefully understand our predecessors; we must learn from the past as we attempt to create our futures). Postmodernism is extremely successful because it will take whatever you feed it and reduce it to absurdity using the very standards you accept. Postmodernism is a very deep problem. 

I set out in 2010 to answer it. It took years of training to even begin to understand how large a creature I was wrestling, that I had it by its toe, and it had me pinned like a bug. I'm here to rally against it again. I want my life to be meaningful and intelligible to me. Ultimately, I am still pursuing some kind of Rightness and Good, but I do not understand them well enough.  

----------------------------

Doing your best just is the definition of rightness. It's the "ought" implies "can" rule. "Can" here is a very complex capacity, and we have yet to even prove our freedom. But, even if we needed to hedge, even if we assumed for practical and epistemically prudential reasons a metamodern morality and our agency, when we get past the skeptical baggage, we are still left with an emormously complex question of what counts as "can." Without it, we cannot answer "ought." 

Here is the [[Neo-Kantian Slip]] that I hate: 

In their skewed understanding of human nature, they lose sight of The Good and The Right. They correctly lower the standards, but where they have put the standards we should be aiming for is much higher than they've accepted. They legitimately think they are good people. Any serious Kantian knows they are a bad person, that we are all bad people. I see them as people who selfishly confabulate and eisegetically inject a false interpretation of [[Metaethics]] that has lowered the bar enough that "coincidentally" justify and show they are good people. They move this goal post so as to maximize their happiness while still having the ability to virtue signal from. I'm serious. My professors really thought they were good people deep down; not one would honestly and outspokenly call themselves out. Sure, they would give you a politely humble response if you asked them, but that is not who they were. That's not who any of us are. We really do suck. Just because we suck doesn't mean nobody has dignity.

Perhaps even Personhood dignity and respect should come in degrees. I've been too dogmatic about it (and yet have made argument in that direction countless times). 

I have long had a struggle in me. Do I see people as sinners, saints, or something in between? Who are we? What? How? Why? When, Where? Who? Tell me. I need to know. There are big differences in the kinds of inferences we ought to make when the glass is half full, half empty, or something else. 

Beyond some basic theory of economics/financial principles/etc (an enormous portion of the Bible worries about money and power), the Bible and Economists share one fundamental thing in common: people are selfish, they are sinners. They see the same thing, they just use different words to describe it. Crucially, while the Bible and Economists are studying the same thing (who we are) and come to very similar descriptions of who we are, they do not provide the same prescriptions about who we should be. 

This is why I've had such a hard time being a businessman. It's why I stopped going into business and started going into philosophy.

<<footnotes "1" "St. Paul was crucially onto something, dare I say he was //right// in important ways. I have studied the concept of Justification - it has been central to my philosophical training (and to my academic work on this subject over the past decade and a half). I think in at least a minimal way, I am justified in my understanding of justification.">>

<<footnotes "1.1" "Which may simply be an idea, a concept. I do not think it is a Being anymore, and I do not buy Plato, Aristotle, or Judeo-Christian Gods (or any other gods for that matter).">>

<<footnotes "2" "Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and Gödel know it (in different ways). I see that they know it. I've yet to consult Spinoza (I have my suspicions); we will see what that monster has to say. I can rarely give higher praise to a claim or concept when all of them agree (across the gulf of time, those memes must have been mighty strong for these geniuses of geniuses of geniuses to have agreed to such a powerfully cosmos-defining claim [St. Anselm, among a great many others, agreed too, but I'm hesitant to put him on the previous list because...look at that beautiful list.]), and yet I know I run the risk of Appealing to Authority.">>

<<footnotes "3" "I just sweepingly defined 300B.C.-1400AD on the topic. Arguably, we are striking at the very core of The Great Conversation, i.e. The Humanities Project. It may, to some minimal extent, be ineffable to us. It is the Gödellian Incompleteness of our existence.">>
