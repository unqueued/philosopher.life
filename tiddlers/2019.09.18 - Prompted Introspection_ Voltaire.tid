!! What is it that you most dislike?

We're not talking about [[love]] here directly. I dislike the fact that the world isn't as such that I can just be drugged out my mind 24/7. I wish I had the opportunity to speak with people who were interested in the branches of philosophy I'm interested in. I dislike unjustified aspects of the world. I wish it were continuously becoming the best possible world at each contingent branch.
