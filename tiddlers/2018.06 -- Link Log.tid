!! Audit:

* Maymays are quite abundant. I leave them up for my family especially. It's a quick way to communicate a great deal.
* I've largely avoided posting any videos for a long time. I strongly prefer text. But, it's starting to slip in. That's okay. I need to grow accustomed to just making links to content, whatever form it may be.
* Disconfirm My Bias often catches me by surprise, and usually in a bad way. I like to be surprised.
* I see that I repeat many of my links. My memory is failing me.
* Tagging for my children would be nice, but I think it's just fine to post a link multiple categories. The vast, vast majority of the time, it fits into a single category. I am sure most people would find this move repugnant.
* Scientific America and Nature are on my shitlist, but I can't help but read them. Also, where the fuck has Nautilus been?
* I've been spending more time thinking about what links to send to whom.
* Lots of shorter posts this month. I'm totally cool with that.
* Perhaps it looks stupid to others, but I'm always pleased to see my SCWR rabbitholing. It's a beautiful process to me. I fear I can never do it enough.
* I still can't find a rhyme or reason to when I elect to comment on links. I do try to always comment on the //Think About It// category.
* Often, my comments aren't that valuable. That's okay though. I can't expect myself to do everything well.
* I'm enjoying the "smash" sessions. I've noticed that what usually happens is that I will read it when see it, then let it sit. When I come back to it a few days later, I make my determination about whether or not to even put it in the link log. 
* I'm proud of the diversity of my sources. Admittedly, I do not spend enough time thinking about what my enemies are saying.
* This log is a fuckton of work at times, but I'm honestly proud of it. 
* If there is a skill I hope to pass onto my children, this is one of them. I want this to be a core epistemic practice of their lives.
* Categories are comments, even if they aren't justifications or explanations with any significant [[SO]] aspect to them.
* Sometimes I feel like a chicken-sexer with my 6th sense.
