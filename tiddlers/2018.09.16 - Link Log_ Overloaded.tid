*** I feel that conviction. =/ I'm not sure what I can do about it.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption#Modern_period
*** I have enormous respect for those who help the poor and needy, especially with huge commitments. Unfortunately, I'm coming to see that our adoption rates might also be a sign of a kind of capitalist business.

*** Wife gave this to me. Looks very interesting. I think my work is still too fringe and unsettled; I also don't think the wealthy would ever want what I do.
