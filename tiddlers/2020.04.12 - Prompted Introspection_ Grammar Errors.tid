title: 2020.04.12 - Prompted Introspection: Grammar Errors

!! How do you react when you realize you've made a mistake?

[[2018.07.14 - Prompted Introspection: Reacting to Mistakes]] is still correct. I should give some examples in subsequent answers. My grammar is awful, and my word salad is problematic: I often make dumb errors in my speech and writing. It's common for my family to pick it out with me. I'll have a range of responses. Sometimes they'll have filled in a gap for me, and I'm just grateful and glad to have help in smoothing out the communications. If it's a really bad fuck up, I'll just start laughing. Other times, it can be a nuisance or grammar-nazi-trolling, and I'll be, "yeah, yeah, okay, so...". When I feel it's pointlessly used to detract from the conversation, I may launch into a diatribe about the duties of audiences, the demands of charity, and so forth. I feel a deep connection with my son here.
