title: 2018.09.07 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

These books continue to get darker. There's more death. Rowling sits on Voldemort forever in this series, and then it starts to unfold rapidly into a monster.

I truly hate the Dursleys. Yes, it's bad that I hate, but it isn't wrong. This is one of those slippery slopes for the Fundamental Misattribution Error.

I am reminded of Penn and Teller, where Penn is meta enough to point out that he is mean to an audience member so as to make the audience feel less horrified when something bad happens to him on the stage. That's here too.

Personally, I think the sharp political distinction between wizards and muggles makes no sense. This has the Alice in Wonderland problem...the same stupid fucking trope of "magic is just now being revealed again into the real world." Yuck. This tribalism, gnosticism isn't coherent.

Classism is loud and clear, yet we still magically get to have our cakes and eat them too because HP does live in a wealthy fashion in many respects.

My brother is beginning to think I won't love this series anymore after this read through. That might be true. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to close this chapter then. =)

I'd like to see more shades or [[dok]] of slavery in here. Ultimately, I'm worried Rowling is still a capitalist paying lipservice.

As usual, I have my disdain for sportsball playing such a huge role in our lives. There are much better ways to spend our lives, energy, curiosity, etc.

I used to be able to enjoy concerts, loud classrooms, and crowds. At this point, my aural sensory interpretation systems are easily overwhelmed. I think there may even be physical damage to my ears. I've long adored ear protection and headphones. I'm too sensitive. I would not enjoy being in the stadium without some augmentation. This issue started in my 20's.

Feels like the KKK. Also, the dark mark is quite the stamp.

Reputation is so important in this story. It's a force!

It's weird, but the Weasleys were an important image of family life for me. I needed sane points of comparison to my own family life. The work/life balance is loud and clear.

I wonder if Skeeter is actually some person in Rowling's life. 

I feel the pain of having shitty clothes, etc. Mrs. Weasley is the bomb.

I agree that people should learn the darkarts. You should learn to hack, you should learn how to fire a gun, you should actually engage in the double-edged swords that have negative connotations. You have to gutterally know how to reason about it. There's a censorship problem here that always annoyed me. Umbridge takes it even further, obviously.

Admittedly, I think of the ghosts are limbs of the school's building. They tend to be mobile fixtures to my eyes, even when I try to empathize with them.

McGonagall reminds me of Ms. Smith so much. I feel like there's too large a gap between us. It's incommensurable. The spirit of who she is, however, rings loud and clear in me.

I <3 Hermione. She's one of the reasons I chose my wife. She might be one of the most moral characters I can think of in fiction.

Okay, the moves to legit wizard competition as the star competition/attraction is like academic team, but way, way, way fucking cooler. 

The age magic isn't used effectively in the world given what they believe, imho. Also, hoodwink doesn't get enough attention given the original caster.

I think the sexual charges begin in this book.

Also, I love how they love Hagrid. That has always mattered to me.

The curses are fascinating, of course. Charmed moody was still interesting.

This entire book feels contrived. I don't think the tournament would have happened at all. The cheating/helping/nudging/shaping is all wrong.
