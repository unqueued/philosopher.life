How goes the trip?
Jan 3 1:26pm
2 hours away from our new home.
Jan 3 1:26pm
Woot woot!
Jan 3 1:26pm
I am sitting on the couch â€”contemplating laundry...or a nap
Jan 3 1:27pm
Or laundry and a nap?
Jan 3 1:27pm
=)
Jan 3 1:27pm
Nap definitely, laundry if you have the time, imho.
Jan 3 1:29pm
Verizon all worked out?
Jan 3 1:29pm
You start back up on Monday?
Jan 3 1:30pm
Verizon â€”waiting to hear from the little old ladies in Florida that they have their accounts settled
Jan 3 1:31pm
I need to call Carmenâ€™s relatives and get his phone settled
Jan 3 1:31pm
Ah, that sounds pleasant.
Jan 3 1:32pm
Yep
Jan 3 1:32pm
Yesterday was fun â€”needed a phone on the account to make changes...but Carmen wouldnâ€™t let us take the phone...
Jan 3 1:33pm
So...tried to reach the most tech savvy of the little old ladies but she was on a plane...
Jan 3 1:33pm
Reached another of the ladies ...all she had to do was read the number off of her text....
Jan 3 1:34pm
Took 5 mins ...3 calls and two texts because the first number expired by the time she read it....ðŸ˜”ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜Š
Jan 3 1:35pm
Was actually kinda funny
Jan 3 1:35pm
Like remote phone tag herding geriatric cats.
Jan 3 1:36pm
Yep exactly
Jan 3 1:36pm
We are dog sitting for our dog sitters ðŸ˜Š but Remy is an awesome dog so thats ok
Jan 3 1:36pm
Very cool. More playmates, I assume.
Jan 3 1:37pm
Yesh! Prim loves Remi!
Jan 3 1:37pm
I adore it when animals just get along.
Jan 3 1:42pm
I think Prim loves her because she is young enough to plau
Jan 3 1:42pm
Err play
