title: 2019.04.03 - Afterschool Teaching: Chess

Whitney felt off to me. Her reaction times aren't normal with me, past the paranoia threshold too. I have no idea what's up. It is true: few adults directly speak with me unless by necessity. The kids are far more open to my weirdness. Part of the issue is that I only signal agreement when I'm in agreement, and that is a dangerous thing to do in heavy outgrouping conservative environments. Even my refusal to engage in a topic gives away a general direction, and that is a strike against me. It's much easier with kids who expect authoritarianism (which they will get when I am convinced that is necessary) and instead get treated like young adults in many contexts. I'm not here to save the crystalized adults; I'm here to save the kids by planting corrupting seeds of doubt, curiosity, and wise rule-breaking.

Whitney agreed she handles 5th grade boys much better than I can, and I handle the older kids better. Either way, I'm grateful for her help, particularly with the little monsters who don't need no father figure (thank you very much).

We stood around until I found out we were waiting on an eccentric high school teacher who brought the chess club to teach whoever wanted to learn how to play chess. Praise jeebus. I sung their praises to their faces, thanked them all, etc. The teacher understood it meant a lot to me, and she thanked me for making the evening a success. This is what my children need. I adored how many of my kids joined us, even though it miffed Delp, Whitney, and Matt. Fuck 'em. This was amazing. 

All the kids got to play, and I dunked when they asked me to play (I prefer to watch). I should not induldge it: blowing fools up has always been my favorite pasttime in vidya games, especially those who have more time and money sunk into a game.<<ref "n">> It's fun playing the athletes who were are hypercompetitive, playfully screaming, and trying to cheat. 

Interestingly, the 4-5 year old daughter of the teacher was kicking butt. Her focus was strong for her age. I lavished that child with praise for her effort, resilient willingness to make mistakes, and her focus (but I do not tell her she is smart [though she is clearly bright]). I learned the teacher homeschools her own while teaching in public school. We had a good deal in common, except...they used some Bob Jones curriculum. I should have known from the combo-overs. 

I was, of course, intensely curious. I interrogated the living shit out of her cocky highschool sons (only after praising and commenting on their blitz and bullet games). As for their chess, it's easy to watch from the sidelines. They also played by strict tournament rules; you could see the signs and physical mannerisms as they played in silence or with brotherly banter. I pointed out an error, and they chose to end the game over it. They play to win, and it's clear they play often (but they do not study either, that is obvious). Of course, the idiotic competitor in me considered giving my kids a month to destroy them, but I think it isn't a wise use of our precious time. If they want to do it, I'll help them, but it is better to work on more valuable practical and theoretical problems.

The mother was a careful one in how she spoke with me. Caveats and slow rolling, it was highly incremented and she made solid inferences. She is different. We will get along as long as I do not reveal my heresy. She ended up wanting to move her rated and unrated tournaments to our school instead. It's well-suited for it. I told her I am powerless, and directed her to those asses she needed to kiss. She asked me to push the tourney, but I later found it will cost people money to play. That money is used to finance sending her own children to tournaments. Fascinating moves.

<<footnotes "n" "Naked rogues fucking elitely geared toons always made my day. Though, lvl 19 twinks with very specially quested and crafted gear broke the game. My priest was immune to death unless I had 3 twinks on me (and even then, I usually couldn't be taken down). I love turtling.">>
