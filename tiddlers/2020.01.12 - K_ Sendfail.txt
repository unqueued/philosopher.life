Feeling like shit, but it's okay. No pressure, so it doesn't feel like hell. =)

Odd problem, can't send to you from m16, but works on my phone. Just your account too, lol.

Anyway, feeling like shut, but that is okay. No pressure on me, so it doesn't feel like hell. ðŸ˜€
Jan 12 2:51pm
We are doing family time now.
Jan 12 2:52pm
Huh. Maybe I can check the settings and figure out what the issue is.
Jan 12 4:15pm
I might need to relink it with my computer.
Jan 12 4:17pm

I have relinked. Not sure if it works now or not.

(I didn't do anything, so might be central server-side)

Wooo!

9:08 PM] h0p3: Yeah, I can't send from monster-17 either. It still might be my end (verification may have failed for some reason?). Also, I'm happy to use Discord with you, as long as we have Signal as our backup for sending sensitive information (keys, passwords, etc.).
[9:09 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Sure-- I'm ALWAYS  on here
[11:30 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Hope youâ€™re having a great day!
[11:30 AM] h0p3: You too, homie. :slight_smile:
[11:30 AM] h0p3: I'm still feeling like shit, but that is okay. No insurance until Feb 1, sadly.
[11:30 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Holy shit. That sucks.
[11:31 AM] h0p3: What you up to today?
[11:32 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Working. Been trying to cancel my appointment with the hospital tomorrow since Friday. (They keep giving me the run around)
[11:32 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Iâ€™m afraid theyâ€™re going to slap us with a cancelation fee or a no show but I started the process of trying to cancel well outside of the 24 hours window.
[11:33 AM] h0p3: That is super annoying. Their failure to note it on the account is not something you can do anything about. =/
[11:33 AM] h0p3: I'm surprised there is a fee too.
[11:33 AM] h0p3: (well, only partially surprised)
[11:34 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Nope. They require you to call to cancel it. When I can get someone on the phone, they transfer me somewhere else and I have to leave a damn message.
[11:34 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Itâ€™s mega dumb.
[11:34 AM] h0p3: That should count as proof for them (not that they will see it that way).
[11:34 AM] h0p3: Layers of phone tag; not their problem.
[11:35 AM] Ardent_Assailant: They might not even call me back. Thereâ€™s no way to expedite the process.
[11:35 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Itâ€™s whatever though. Haha
[11:36 AM] h0p3: I t ' s j u s t a c a n c e l l a t i o n
