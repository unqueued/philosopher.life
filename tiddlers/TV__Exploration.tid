title: TV: Exploration

//I'm hunting for narratives worth my time. This exploration is curatively for the sake of [[TV: Library]] and capturing some sense of [[Deep Reading]]. I must hyperread for the [[salience]] and digest it when I stumble upon it in the desert. In time, perhaps this will become an [[APFVD]]ed [[directory]] with a more scientific bent. For now, I capture and study.//

; 2019.10.20 - Killing Eve
: Piss Off You Silky Uncanny Nutter Sleepless Uma Pink Panther Debureaugratifying Bournic Bullshat Lana Del Rey Dexter. I'm fully erect minus the product placement in the opening episode. The story rapidly becomes incoherent though still fun.

; 2019.10.20 - Legion
: Completely unreal, gently overtempo'd, neuro-atypicality, projection, and superpowers. Maybe Wes Anderson meets (Requiem for a Dream + Resident Evil + Samsara + Split) divide by 3 has a baby with Fallen equals Alice Flew Over The Demonic Xmanland. It is very difficult to capture the [[phenomenology]] of psychosis and delusions. My brother showed me a scene from this one! Mixed feelings about the CGI, but overall extremely beautiful. [[k0sh3k]] makes the call.

; 2019.10.19 - Living With Yourself
: Solid premise. Hello, Trek and Parfit. Still can't tell if they can spend the premise correctly.

; 2019.10.15 - The Boys
: I am lucky to have a brother who knows me. On the fucking money. It's allowed to have the bullshit I usually find in superhero stories because that's the point. I've bet my pecker my wife is going to laugh or cheer during a scene in episode 4. Music is delightful. Has a bunch of shows it reminds me of, yet it is entirely new. My son says he sees me in all of the boys in one. 

; 2019.10.14 - Love Island
: My offspring and I are having a blast. I am hawt for the narrator, ironically ironic. You cannot criticize the show by definition. If you took a shot for every time someone says the word "like," you will die in minutes  from either drowning or alcohol poisoning. Bubbly is now a swearword. Getting past two episodes is an endurance contest: not worth your time or soul.

; 2019.08.11 - Ping Pong
: AWWWWWWWWWW YEEEAAHH, boi. Wow. Eye-popping. Psychedelic, kind, pure dialectics, and the characters are almost real. They fit existence into ping pong. I love ya, ping pong. It is the best animated show I've seen since Rick & Morty. It is rare that a [[hope]]ful show sticks with me. This one does. I ran through it fast, then I walked it down.

; 2019.07.14 - Russian Doll
: Binging this. Lit Groundhog Day redeux, far more realistic fantasy while somehow everything is romantically connected, individualized in exploration, open-ended, magnetic characters and world-building, timeline questions abound, I hate the way they test and model with a passion, boundaries and mechanics are unique, and I'm fucking hooked. May this show never end. Plus, she is retarded hawt. This existential thriller is holding me by my raging clue. It's phishing me to death. I wish they had a persistent wiki from episode to episode, but appuruntly, that's muh job.

; 2019.07.13 - Neon Genesis Evangelion
: We made fun of it the entire time. My wife is hilarious to me when she is drunk. We were troped to death. I needed way more tiddies.

; 2019.07.12 - Dirty Money
: Pornography. It's like watching a surface critique of capitalism without actually addressing the underlying [[power]] structures. This is the kind of slick move I expect even neoliberals to be able to vacuously virtue signal about without actually paying any political price. Until you can argue for the workers owning the means of production, you're merely feigning outrage.

; 2019.07.11 - Transparent
: Cinematography is on point. So far, it's just about wealthy people. I like the youngest woman to some extent, the rabbi too. Everyone else seems like garbage. My wife, of course, predicted it from the name before we even got into it. I love how much nudity is in this show, ofc. It is rare that a show gives me an erection these days, noice. Unfortunately, I don't think it accurately captures the plight of most of the trans I've met.  Omg, I forgot I've seen scenes from this. Transparency is sad in this show.

; 2019.07.10 - Castlevania
: Gorgeous. Two-color art is in your face dialectical. Some cool things, but the story just doesn't grip me.

; 2019.06.04 - Nailed It
: Obnoxious, capitalist, overproduced, bad voice-overs, amateur reality TV, and it made me laugh several times. I binged S1, and I'm not watching another.

; 2019.06.03 - Good Omens
: I didn't love the book (even though I desperately wanted to), and the show is solid but not for me. Glad it was a miniseries, and I love watching my wife watch it.

; 2019.05.30 - The Promised Neverland
: I am trying to like it. Lots of good things. Fairy Tale, Giver Farming, Xeno, etc. But, brain-eating theory is retarded, mthrs ur nmy, the standard incoherent anime narrative and dialogue, unreasonable love story, romanticism, the conflict/antagonists make no sense (it's terrible storytelling), overplayed suspense/paranoia, and the glorification of mental prowess sans philosophy.

; 2019.05.21 - Letterkenny
: S1 completed. I can see why [[T-Money]] likes it. It worships the archetype he wants to be.

; 2019.05.14 - The Heart, She Holler
: Schtick is consumed within one episode. It reminds me of Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell. Good show when I'm feeling extra absurd.

; 2019.05.14 - LA to Vegas
: My wife is enjoying it. It is watchable, but I feel like my life is slipping before my eyes. It feels like a waste. Still, I like watching with my wife.

; 2019.05.14 - Difficult People
: is a difficult show to have the will to watch for even a few minutes.

; 2019.05.14 - Bravest Warriors
: Adventure Time with more middle fingers. `/yawn`.

; 2019.05.14 - Black Dynamite
: Dynomite. I feel like a teenager with this show. The Boondocks, Archer, Shaft, and Venture Bros had a baby. Tits and violence. Count me in. Flashbacks to children with facial hair are hilarious. Lots of detail, and the animation is on point. Reference heavy. Wish they just went full X-rated. The inferences are perfectly terrible. I adore it.

; 2019.05.07 - AP Bio
: Cute for 10 minutes, but not for me.

; 2019.05.06 - Superstore
: Ugly Betty Redeux, Not Marxist Enough. We watched it all.

; 2019.03.31 - [[Inside No. 9]]

; 2019.03.24 - Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency
: I don't remember why I got this, but I did. My wife adores it, and I enjoy it. That is a winner! Plenty of irony and little word puzzles to disentangle. The show is hilarious, surreal, pseudo-spiritual, and mysterious enough. It's an existential jester. The show quickly went downhill for me. Once you get the schtick, there's not enough substance. My wife, of course, is enamored. I am lucky to lay my head in her lap.

; 2019.03.22 - [[Love, Death & Robots]]

; 2019.01.09 - Bodyguard
: Gorgeous in appearance. Plenty of suspense and ominous feeling. It's paranoic. Who doesn't like cloak'n'dagger? It's fragmented, and trusting authority is complex. In fact, I can't trust any of the characters or even the story-teller/narrator. I'm reminded of several stories. The logistics and relationships are not realistic enough. It detracts from the story for me. Not a fan of police apology Needs more tiddies. I appreciate a willingness to even consider the possibility of a deep state. It's interesting to see the main character pulled in so many directions. "For the children" terrorism, etc. is reasonably here (I'm not done with the show though). Memory/accounts of events: these aren't doubted nearly enough. Also, I kept saying he looked like Robb to my wife. Only after our second Google was my honor restored. Thus far, I think this show appears to favor surveillance more than it attempts to warn us about it. I do not know enough (ironically) about the adversaries. It is over the top though. The main character is too obviously cursed.

; 2018.11.16 - Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell
: Actually in hell. Too Many Cooks dude?. Hackin' it in hell, lol. Squidbillies reference. The sheer competence of the intern that can't "hack it". Love how when "he" has a bad game, he thanks Satan, which is the opposite effect. Lol. Watched 3 Seasons. A fine show. 

; 2018.11.16 - Mostly 4 Millennials
: Vape culture. It's like Nickelodeon 90's kid insanity. TerminILL. Everyone is disposable. Stoner retardation, random distractions. I can't tell if it is celebrating or making fun of Millenialisms. Pomo irony and hyperreality. Hidden + Candid camera bits. Interview talkshow gaslighting. I like how the use of technology just is the joke. Clearly interested in memetic virality, fads, etc. Vine, selfy, shortclips, advertisements, filters, everything is staged. I don't think you are supposed to like it. You hatewatch it. Distractions are reality; reality is a distraction. Ann Coulter is the interviewee. Wow.

; 2018.11.09 - Tender Touches
: Perfectly awkward. I'm embracing his culture! Lol. It babbles a lot. This show sucks.

; 2018.11.09 - Mob Psycho 100
: Colorful, solid music. Trippy even. Faces are hilarious. Backgrounds vs. foregrounds are constructed very differently. The story sucks. Completely One-Punch Man feeling to me. You watch this for the visual art; the story is a disgrace. Someone should strip out what matters and build music vidyas with it.

; 2018.11.09 - Hot Streets
: Pure insanity. Has a Rick and Morty feel to it. Roiland's voice? We'll see. Creepy scoobs. Random.  Nobody to talk to. The price we pay to have anyone in our lives. These are the costs of not talking, lol. Yup. Roiland.

; 2018.11.09 - Black Clover
: Asta Yuno. Christian Magic Anime Theme, again. Conflation of magic and nature. Powerlessness and ridicule. Be Attractive; Don't Be Unattractive. Grimoires are gorgeous, but I loves me a library. More power comes from within bullshit, as though you can overcome your moral luck by definition? Rival aspect is different. Four leaf black clover. Magnanimity claim, "I will be King" to start off the journey. We are meant to think he's stupid. Le Demon Clover.

; 2018.11.08 - The Jellies
: Retail employee's, entitlement, narcissism. Family Guy. Money is at the center of the episode. 90s reference hole. ADHD.

; 2018.11.08 - Off the Air
: Trip art. Graphically impressive whirlwind. MUSIC SCENE. They sped it up! No! Shepherd and Cyriak. Collage of pieces, good taste.

; 2018.11.08 - Neon Joe Werewolf Hunter
: Goosebumps meets CSI spoof with all the necessary sound effects. Tragedy is economic opportunity. "No we don't". Neon Joe is Bayou Charlie Kelly with a license to kill. Bad acting is perfect. Who doesn't love lesbians? Plenty of creep factor, but I think it is the uncanny valley. Beautifully irreverent; keepin' it real. Why are they kicking the all-in-one casket? Lots of little oddities. Coma conception; sex is hilarious on this show. Wolfsense tingling. The screaming into microphone reminds me of aliens warning each other or something.. Half the dialogue is mangled

; 2018.11.08 - My Hero Academia
: Quirk is power. All men are not created equal. Gotta catchem all. X-Men, Heroes, etc. Baby Jesus radiating light. Normalcy of inequality. Cannot draw an ass to save their lives. The centralization of power, the market harnesses quirk. As always
: deviation from the norm will be punished unless it is exploitable. Richest hero of all time. that's why I go to school too. EEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. No. I'm done.

; 2018.11.08 - Mr. Pickles
: Metal; Appearances are deceiving. Demonic possession. The Unknown Demon of the town. Soyboy. Over-the-top like Superjail. Conartists everywhere. A boobjob for a boy, rofl. Wat. Shockart. Meta about its own stupidity. Leave it to Beaver hell. Rapidfire. Schlow down!. Sexual humancentipedes.

; 2018.11.08 - Dream Corp LLC
: All the messed up interactions. Wunderbar. Informed Consent. Let's calibrate you. Scanner Darkly. Turned fucking gorgeous in the experience machine. The cinematography is actually fitting. The Cell, Tron. Trippy. Stick up for yourself. The shortclip schtick might work here? Big names?

; 2018.11.08 - ballmastrz 9009
: Radwars, lol. Celebrity competition, post-apocalyptic. I have seen this animation style(s).  Japanimationized Superjail. As it asks: what is the point of the game? Undead ruler. Game saves humanity from itself (for the god(s))!

; 2017.08.19 - Atlanta
: This is an incredible show. Glover is a genius. I don't love all of his work, but sometimes he hits it right on the money.
