My bro called me back. He had a knife pulled on him as a "joke" at work for going hard with an actual joke. My brother and his apprentice were understandably freaked out by it. My brother handled himself well (plus, with BJJ under his belt, grappling is not something this kid would want to do), and recognized the kid had no idea the seriousness of the action. My brother asked to be transferred, but he decided not to say who pulled the knife. The kid apologized, and my brother told him not to tell anyone since it would ruin the kid's career (the bosses's boss wanted to fire the guy on the spot). My brother and I walked through it, and I think his reasoning is on the money, sacrificial, and he picked out what was salient in the context (which, obviously, I've failed to do justice in my hearsay).

Matthew probably was sick, and now my brother and Rebecca have been feeling it. They are convinced they won't have Matthew much longer, but the kid is doing so much better. Foster parents par excellence.
