!! Respond to the following gem:

The most effective way to restrict democracy is to transfer decision-making from the public arena to unaccountable institutions: kings and princes, priestly castes, military juntas, party dictatorships, or modern corporations.

[[Saint Chomsky]] preaches the decentrality gospel yet again. Privatizing power-over [[others]] into the hands of the few is what occurs in the psychopathic state of nature. It's possible the world could be better, but I don't predict it. It's such a difficult contradiction in me to overcome. I feel like giving up. 

I wonder what the stoics would say about worrying about things which are not absolutely out of our control but almost entirely or most probably out of one's control. Unfortunately, I think once you've seen how green the grass can possibly be, you can't unsee it. I am not sure how not to be consumed by it with integrity. It sounds like learned helplessness. It's fight, flight, or...fall asleep, and I'm exhausted.
