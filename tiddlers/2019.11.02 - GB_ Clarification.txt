What do you think about the [[REDACTED]]?
Nov 2, 2019 2:50pm
I think they are sexy, and they'd do the job.
Nov 2, 2019 2:52pm
Right. Seems like a nice all in one package in terms of capabilities
Nov 2, 2019 2:53pm
And not too expensive
Nov 2, 2019 2:53pm
That is something I would want to buy anonymously. 
Nov 2, 2019 2:53pm
Yes, I am still planning to do this btw. I'm just concentrating on work first
Nov 2, 2019 2:53pm
For sure. I'm trying to figure out how to do that
Nov 2, 2019 2:54pm
I won't be able to set the standard for trust for you here. The minor warning I gave about this paranoic rabbithole shows up here pretty strongly.
Nov 2, 2019 2:55pm
If it were me, I'd still build this by hand with used parts.
Nov 2, 2019 2:56pm
Yeah but you have expertise and capabilities I don't lol
Nov 2, 2019 2:58pm
I think if you want to do this right, building this by hand is not the hard part. 
Nov 2, 2019 2:59pm
The [[REDACTED]] would make a lot of elements of this much easier for a layman like me
Nov 2, 2019 3:00pm
It would, no doubt.
Nov 2, 2019 3:00pm
It's faster.
Nov 2, 2019 3:00pm
I think finding a way to procure one with a modicum of anonymity is easier than building an equivalent
Nov 2, 2019 3:00pm
Btw I haven't been doing too much research. I happened across a reference to the [[REDACTED]] on a thread
Nov 2, 2019 3:02pm
But I've done a tiny bit of research on [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:02pm
Excellent!
Nov 2, 2019 3:03pm
I think I'm going to have to use [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:08pm
From what I gather, [[REDACTED]]. That should be enough to identify it
Nov 2, 2019 3:10pm
You have [[REDACTED]], right?
Nov 2, 2019 3:10pm
No. If I did this would be no problem. And the vast majority of [[REDACTED]]
Ah, I forgot what you might have on [[REDACTED]].
Nov 2, 2019 3:13pm

Which I know is usually considered bs security. In this one specific case it helps security slightly lol
Nov 2, 2019 3:13pm
Well I have candidate [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:14pm
What information do you have to find this [[REDACTED]]?
Nov 2, 2019 3:15pm
[[REDACTED]]. Without it, mot much lol
Nov 2, 2019 3:17pm
You have to know something about [[REDACTED]] to find the right one. An address, for example, would at least be something.
Nov 2, 2019 3:18pm
Well I know the [[REDACTED]] but not which [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:19pm
You can't break into them all, and even if you could, you'd then have to find the needle in the haystack. 
Nov 2, 2019 3:20pm
Probably have to find a specific location, and then you walk by for [[REDACTED]].
Nov 2, 2019 3:20pm
Well with [[REDACTED]] get that info passively
Nov 2, 2019 3:21pm
I've considered that. Doing old fashioned surveillance to narrow down location. Which would obviously help tremendously. But it carries obvious risks
Nov 2, 2019 3:21pm
Depending on the [[REDACTED]] size, you may have to relocate this object many times.
Nov 2, 2019 3:22pm
Safer to do it once.
Nov 2, 2019 3:22pm
What so you mean?
Nov 2, 2019 3:23pm
Do
Nov 2, 2019 3:23pm
It's not too big
Nov 2, 2019 3:23pm
You generally want a fairly strong [[REDACTED]].
Nov 2, 2019 3:23pm
I really wish I had turned to the dark side before [[REDACTED]] lol. Finding [[REDACTED]] would have been incredibly easy
Nov 2, 2019 3:24pm
I think with a [[REDACTED]] I won't need to break in at all
Nov 2, 2019 3:24pm
Depends on how you do it.
Nov 2, 2019 3:25pm
From what I gather the [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:25pm
I think it makes [[REDACTED]]. 
Nov 2, 2019 3:25pm
No I mean I can [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:26pm
To do that of course I'll need to first identify [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:26pm
You'll also want it to be [[REDACTED]]. 
Nov 2, 2019 3:26pm
[[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:27pm
Yeah I know. I'm going to get [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:27pm
[[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:27pm
Yes, I see.
Nov 2, 2019 3:27pm
I thought we were going to avoid [[REDACTED]].
Nov 2, 2019 3:28pm
It sends up a redflag.
Nov 2, 2019 3:28pm
Maybe I'm misunderstanding but from what I gather, the [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:28pm
Well depends on the type of attack isn't it? I was always planning on [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:29pm
What sorts of red flags?
Nov 2, 2019 3:30pm
Alright, so you are going to [[REDACTED]] in an area, grabbing [[REDACTED]], so that you can sift through the information you've collected about each [[REDACTED]] to figure out which [[REDACTED]] matters to you, right?
Nov 2, 2019 3:41pm
How do you know you can [[REDACTED]] the computer itself? 
Nov 2, 2019 3:47pm
Some [[REDACTED]] are easier to recognize or defend against than others. I would be slow to do [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 3:49pm
The [[REDACTED]] is a lower risk.
Nov 2, 2019 3:51pm

I may [[REDACTED]] (apparently you can modify the [[REDACTED]] so that it can simultaneously [[REDACTED]]), but that's not ideal. I would prefer to [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 4:06pm
I don't know I can [[REDACTED]] the computer. I'm going one step at a time. First I need to [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 4:06pm
I mean I suppose I only need to get into [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 4:07pm
But I could also [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 4:08pm
As you've asked, I've been digesting this and exploring what these choices really mean with you. I am your friend, and it is my job to push back and identify my problems with the plan, maxim, etc. You are increasing my belief that you will do this (as I've said, I've been doubtful). Have you decided if this will be good for the [[REDACTED]]? That is the key moral question I still have (though I have concerns about whether or not you will do this in such a way you can't be caught). Deontically, you have an uphill battle for why this deception is acceptable. Virtue theoretically, just gut-checking here, it feels like there are better options for seeking [[REDACTED]] justice. I see some reasons to think the [[REDACTED]] have made mistakes which justify significant defection in your iterated prisoners dilemmas with them, but the outcomes for the [[REDACTED]] become exceptionally crucial then. Every [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 4:58pm
I've thought about these things, and I appreciate you bringing them up
Nov 2, 2019 5:26pm
I don't think I have better options for seeking [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 5:27pm
I think a virtue ethical perspective already will bring in supposedly deontic concerns. I'm not sure if I can address them to either of our satisfaction
Nov 2, 2019 5:28pm
[[REDACTED]] Is that justified? I don't know. Will it have overall bad consequences for [[REDACTED]]? I can't know that. If [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 5:30pm
But since [[REDACTED]]
Nov 2, 2019 5:31pm
[[REDACTED]]
