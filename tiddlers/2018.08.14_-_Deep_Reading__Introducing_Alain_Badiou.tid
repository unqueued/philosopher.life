title: 2018.08.14 - Deep Reading: Introducing Alain Badiou

His point of view on love is a mix of some claims I strongly agree with and those that I don't see how he can defend. 

The spirit of the claim, of love as a kind of existential risk, is something I can agree to in [[T42T]]. You have to assume you aren't playing a zero-sum perfectly competitive game for the strategy to be correct. However, he then goes on to claim that sex can't happen between friends. 

Again, I don't see why the 4 Badiou-ian categories or sources of truth are the correct ones. How do they justify themselves? I think he wants to dismiss philosophy not done from that framework without enough justification.
