My brother is experiencing some tremors and itching; he calls it mini-restless leg syndrome. We talked about his meds for a while. Vibrid worked, and if enough time passes without efficacy like it, then he may have to keep hunting for something like it. It is backup plan.

We talked about homeschooling. My offspring are supposed to write in their writing log and a [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]. I still want to practice having a remote relationship with them, but otherwise I think it's awesome that he has free reign to do whatever. I hope they chill and have fun, or maybe work on the house or an experiment, or whatever. It's totally up to them, and I think that's a great thing.

My brother's coworkers make fun of him for trying to understand people (accuse him of having a psychology degree, which he does). They also think it's insane that he talks to his family about everything. 

His boss did a "let me do that," but then later talked with him about the overall structuring. My brother convinced him to stick with the old Tim's idea instead of redoing everything for a bad, tiny thing.

We talked about the wiki, transparency, privacy, depth in relationships, what counts as deception through omission, and distinguishing justified from unjustified deception. We talked about the public+privacy tooling my daughter is building, the Tyrion Trick, and what it means to present different faces, doorways, or reductions of the entire wiki. Integrity and accountability were core topics.

One excellent point my brother made with a coworker who criticizes character but not some other attributes: people seek privacy generally because they don't want anyone to contradict the confabulated stories they tell themselves about being a good (and hence well-integrated and coherent) person. It's part of why they hypocritically don't actually learn how to privatize against centralized power, but only against other individuals in their lives. Privacy is similar to freespeech in that I pursue radical political tools for the poorest and weakest of society, but I don't think most people have a moral right to be who they are, to have much privacy, or to say just anything. We discussed privacy differentials. My brother continued to sum it up and branch on the topic. 

We talked about The Poisonwood Bible a bit. He considers it inevitable that my offspring will stop revealing so much with me. I am trying to hand them the tools to do it well and wisely. He thought about what it may be like for them to write their own Poisonwood Bible experience of being raised by me. May they have epic notes and structures they've built for telling and retelling themselves the stories of who they, I, and we were, are, and will be in this world.

I think I did most of the talking today. That isn't so common.
