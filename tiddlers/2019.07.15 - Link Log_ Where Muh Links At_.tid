*** `/facepalm`. Fine, except neither have a cogent foundational theory of metaethics. They can be bedfellows though, but both are huge bodies of thought.

*** That sounds like sublation to me. I have no idea how to talk about such mediation. I suspect they are more meshed and gunky, coming in [[dok]], and perhaps evolve with the individual more than is known.

*** Hegelian treat. youtube-dl subs are no go. I suggest using your arrow keys. 
**** I do not see why it isn't Platonic or Leibnizian (or Spinozan). Am I too Straussian, or not enough? I must be a fool. It's [[The Infinite]], and it describes/computes itself. I am afraid I cannot speak to its consciousness; I will take [[The Dialetheia]] vow here as well. It is fine with me if it both is and isn't because I am not outside, even nothingness is not outside it. My words are absurd. I do what I can.
**** I agree he is the second-coming of Kant. And, look: "Freedom and reason are nonsense without each other." That is the most Kantian sentence ever uttered. He means something entirely different from Kant too! Lol. I am glad to see the "insofar." And, yes, Spinoza is saying that too. Incompatibilism can still fit in that description, as far as I can tell (though it is ugly, and I have not seen another philosopher go this far).
***** Transworld identities give room for REAL freedom and a kind of meaning that Hegel did not see, though his argument can account for it. It's why his ethics suck (or are non-existent).
