title: 2020.03.30 - Prompted Introspection: Happy & Unhappy

!! Am I happy with my job, life, and situation? What parts are good? What parts are bad?

I feel like I gave generic answers to [[2018.06.24 - Prompted Introspection: Generic Q]]. It's true: these are generic questions, I answer them in more detail with my usual [[CDR]]s, and it's fine to give some high-level generic answer here. My read on the union was entirely misguided. I'm disappointed, but I'm glad. I did plenty of job-hunting, and it's clear that capitalists' systems have not found me useful enough. Okay. I'm really glad to have been able to do [[Afterschool Teaching]] (despite so much that was wrong with it). My idiocy still bore some decent fruit. The rest of my answer is generically true today as well, lol.

* Job
** I'm a dad and a philosopher. I am happy with what I get to do. I can't say I do it well enough. 
** I feel like I have more direction in the desert whirlwind. It might not be something other people explicitly or consciously value much, but I'm okay with that to some [[dok]] (approval seeking in [[The Golden Rule]] [[irwartfrr]] is a hard problem). 
** Slowly, my [[Lifetime Projects]] are being built.

* Life
** My days are vivid, spaghettified, and fragmented grinds. My life is filled with good conversations, learning about people and the world, and many luxuries. I'm a lucky man. My [[vidya]] [[game]] is hardcore (I don't know many people who would want to engage in it like I do).
** There are 10,000 things to do, and I'm still narrowing it down. 
** It's a relief to accept what is not up to me, and I hope to select the [[stoic]]'s immutable features of the world with integrity. 

* Sitcheeayshun
** Looks much worse. CV19 seems to be blackswanning us. Election cycles are more broken than usual. Grasps are tightening, and the poor are being sacrificed. I'm afraid for tomorrow even, as I know many people will not be able to afford rent (despite what temporary protections are put in place). I predict food storages and even larger breaks in supply chains. I'm actually having to think about gardening again. The idea that my wife could technically lose her job is pretty terrifying, but she is lucky enough to be employed by the most powerful institution in the area. It feels like it's only accelerating.
