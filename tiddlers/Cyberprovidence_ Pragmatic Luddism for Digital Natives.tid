title: Cyberprovidence: Pragmatic Luddism for Digital Natives

The Amish and Mennonites I grew up around got some things right. I sometimes embrace a hedged-conservatism that few people with my academic and technical knowledge appear to respect because it's paranoic, extremely negative, too open to the possibility of categorizing humans as evil, metaethically perfectionist and essentialist, and ultimately, extremely inconvenient on a large number of fronts.

Intelligent luddism is concerned with understanding and mastering our technology, and not the other way around. It's about making sure we maintain our autonomy while still enabling ourselves to live good lives through the grace of technology.
