title: 2019.11.23 - Wiki Review: Interpretatin

* [[2019.11.22 - Prompted Introspection: Safesex]]
** I'm lucky to be able to just let go. There aren't many places in my life where I can.
* [[2019.11.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: RWing]]
** I'm glad you stayed up to write. Screw your sleep.

** Okay, [[Straussian]] autist alert: I suggest he knows exactly what he says he doesn't know, lol.  He knows the toy (best we know how) we are building for him, which is why he points to it. I'm going to have to ask for more software references. 
*** If I'm forced to advise, I suggest separating the project into two. I don't think you can predict long-term stability of the browser hole-poke, let alone across platforms (mobile just doesn't work correctly). Prototype and then probably Golang (I despise my answer). 
**** He's a busy man. This project is huge to do correctly.

** It sucks that she's had this migraine for days. 
*** Spending spoons on socializing on her days off (beyond the usual) is perhaps not respecting her needs effectively enough either.

** So, the other interpretation is that he's play-acting like he's dumb (obviously, that is absurd) as deference; and, I aim to preserve the dignity of the argument he presents.
*** I am the worst interpreter sometimes. My assumption is that everyone sees what is meant long before I can with a zillion facepalms as they watch me completely go in the wrong direction.

** I have no idea how much revamp, but there's work to do. I'm hoping that my letter will enable me to flesh it out. 
* [[Game Theory]]
** Meh, pure [[PH]]. Turns out I should wait.
* [[2019.11.22 - /b/]]
** This also reminds me of the marbles and baskets analogy I'm forced to use. I have such a terrible foundation all too often.
*** I hope my son will never suffer the same way.
* [[Hall of Fame]]
** Sadly, even when I can identify when someone is making fun of me, I rarely can pick out the [[dok]].
** Not all my relationships require someone to make fun of me. I don't think I can recall the last time my brother [[JRE]] did; we aim for self-deprecation. Or, somehow, there's no doubt, and he knows how to say it to me such that I can't even see anything but love in it.
