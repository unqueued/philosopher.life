Self-storytelling, autonomous projection of projects Dasein Deep Self

The correct way to build the Perfect Competition Tournament of dialectics of IDPs is non-obvious. 

How do you build models of how everyone has been playing? You build emergent agents that dialectically balloon up into a world in which you face. How do you face the emergent adversary of [[The Other]]: The External World you probabilistically must model, having both the rationalist's conceptual-dialectical required faith and the Bayesian's dialectical tested empiricism? 

My assumption is that the big boys are already building more functionally rich contexts for perfectly competitive tournaments built for [[TANN]].
