title: 2020.04.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Oops In Muh Base

* Woke at 8
** Woke up from a happy dream, and I just felt good. Wat.
* Walked and talked with myself
* Read+Write
* Cleaning
* Wonderful morning with the family
** Dominion and Anomia
* Read+Write
* Walked with my wife
** Talked with Paul. 
*** He's doing alright.
** Well over three hours. 
*** Down to the bridge, all the way to the other side we've never tried, up Skiff, around the usual shopping areas. Lots of new places we've not seen before.
** Found butter for my wife!
** We had some mediocre Thai food, but I'm glad we tried it.
* Nap while watching //Avenue 5// with my wife
** Odd show.
* Fireman Time!
** It's great to watch porn with my wife. 
* Read+Write
* Offspring aren't done with their work...
* [[JRE]] called me
** Catscan went well enough (had to eat for his antibiotics, but this was a nono for the scan). I'm glad he has antibiotics. I get the feeling he's going to be okay, but we will find out.
*** Wants to make a video of the scope coming out of his mouth for the colonoscopy, have something to show guests. Lol! I think that would be amazing. 
** Rebecca is doing a lot of professional development.
*** My brother finds her job exceptionally boring.
*** He's still feeling a lot of relational heat, I think.
**** He sees signals that are completely invisible to me. He's sensitive to others where I am a blockhead.
** He's been waking up earlier to be with Matthew.
** He had a frustration with 3 pounds of beef he left at the store, and it took an extra half hour to resolve the problem.
*** There was a dudebro who helped him out.
** We talked about the economy
*** I think I annoyed him, but he was gracious about it. Told me not to worry about it.
**** I think he already understood what I was saying, even though I was saying it poorly. He gives me a lot of slack for my gibberish and wandering.
** We talked about his computer. Games crashing from lack of memory. 
*** I'm surprised. 16GB is plenty. 
**** Can't reproduce, don't know the exact error, hasn't searched for it. Seems like 8GB is quite doable (his system seemed lean enough to me).  
*** He's not able to play new AAA titles on highest settings. 
*** I think he's partially not joking about throwing money at the problem.
*** 15-40 tabs in Chrome. 
*** We want something different from our computers. 
** We talked about [[Captain Fantastic]] again.
*** He was surprised that I cried in the movie (he knows I cry in many movies, but I cried a lot in this one).
*** Pretty sure I bored him, lol.
**** I realize my brother does me a great honor in talking about my retardations.
** My brother also talked about an engineer talking about motors in a thorough manner for his job. Sounds like he had a blast learning about it (even if the other electricians hated it).
*** Mr. Black story came up again. My brother reaches for stories he knows I can understand. I wish I were better at doing the same for him. 
** I'm so glad my brother rushes to take care of his son. He's a good dad.
