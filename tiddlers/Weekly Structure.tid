title: Weekly Structure

This is a template. It's a generalized gameplan and not an exact schedule. This is about contemplating the overall everyweekliness structure of our lives. Obviously, we must be flexible. It's the kind of thing we naturally keep in our heads, but it is also something worth writing down for more objective analysis. We may need to change it. When I get out of my Pipefitting program, I may be forced to travel for long periods of time. We will need to think about and plan around these kinds of generalized structures. I can certainly do it by hand in my head, but it may be easier, more efficient, and less stressful if we wrote it down for everyone.
