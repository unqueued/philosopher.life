How's the job transition looking and feeling so far?

&& it’s great got the position so far in March I might die to get it going :joy: no jk it’s just I’ll be working for the new family on my days off and still for Katie because I have to obviously work what I have committed to. Then once I go in to April schedule myself between the two appropriately. But over all I scored- only 12 minutes from home $15 an hour for an infant boy. The parents seem cool as a fan- originally from Arizona. At least the mom is. And she is totally flexible on schedule as well so we can still travel or I can work as much or as many as long as I do at least 25 hrs a week. Exactly what I was looking for- God is good:pray:
