So my app is in for grad school ...here we go —basic program to teach math in a community college
THU 10:07 AM
That is awesome!
THU 10:18 AM
What program?
THU 10:18 AM
How long does it take to complete it?
THU 10:18 AM
A year and a half? Depends on how much work each class wants
THU 10:19 AM
Really just need 18 grad hours in math
THU 10:19 AM
What parts of math will you be focusing on?

Neat!
THU 10:20 AM
My co-worker is learning math-classes that remind me of this quite a bit.
THU 10:22 AM
Teaching math sounds like a wonderful dream. I wish I could do that too, lol. The pay at the community college may actually be worse, but I bet you'll enjoy it even more.
THU 10:23 AM
It starts at 5hundred something a credit hour
THU 10:24 AM
But it will just be an extra/summer job
THU 10:24 AM
I would need to retake/review my calc classes to do calc based stuffs—it’s been a while
THU 10:25 AM
Ah, you've been thinking not just about what you want to do this summer, but with many of them. That sounds like a wonderful summer job.
THU 10:26 AM
I have no doubt your calculus review will go fine for you.
THU 10:27 AM
I think it would be great :blush:
THU 10:27 AM
On the odd chance something happens at this school, I should be able to be state certified in math as well as chem.
THU 10:28 AM
Just planning ahead...
THU 10:28 AM
[[UJ]] has a principal interview at a small school north of Fort Knox today
THU 10:28 AM
Noice! I am happy to see everything coming together for you both. The ups and downs seem to be adding up.
THU 10:30 AM
I like that you have a contingency plan in there too.
