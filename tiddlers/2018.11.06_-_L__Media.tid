I'm 30 seconds into a show, and I've decided you must watch the first 30 seconds of it.

Would you like it in our sync?
2 HR AGO
lol!
2 HR AGO
Sure xD
2 HR AGO
Why only the first 30 seconds?
2 HR AGO
Currently 10 minutes 35 seconds, and now you must watch 10 minutes and 35 seconds.
2 HR AGO
It's wonderful.
2 HR AGO
Metal Kawaii
2 HR AGO
if those can go together, this show does it.
2 HR AGO
S1 loaded
2 HR AGO
You can throw Resilio Sync on your phone too and just watch it from there.
2 HR AGO
lol... I believe there’s a band that does in fact combine those two things
2 HR AGO
Babymetal I think they’re called?
2 HR AGO
Exploring them now
1 HR AGO
Hehehe
1 HR AGO
Have fun with that. XD

How was work today?
1 HR AGO
It was... stressful.
1 HR AGO
I feel like every day I get closer to this event something else goes wrong. Murphy’s Law is kicking in hard.
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
I'm sorry; that sucks
1 HR AGO
Such is life I suppose.
1 HR AGO
It does, but I’ll be alright.
1 HR AGO
Trying to mitigate stress with reading/playing video games. The reading has helped.
1 HR AGO
I forgot how much I loved it. Want to get back into it for realsies.
1 HR AGO
Whatcha readin'?
1 HR AGO
I still have oodles of books at yours/[[k0sh3k]]’s recommendation to read too. But having a list is nice. :3
1 HR AGO
The Witcher series
1 HR AGO
Heard the games were good and am playing a D&D character whose class is based off of the series
1 HR AGO
Ah, cool.
1 HR AGO
So I thought I’d do some “studying” which is more I just wanted to read a good fantasy book.
1 HR AGO
Having to Google. I'm only distantly familiar with it.
1 HR AGO
It’s a polish series translated — became wildly popular once the video games, especially the third one, came out.
1 HR AGO
The third game won hundreds of awards, brought lots of attention to the lore and such.
1 HR AGO
What are you up to? Other than watching angry yet adorable anime I mean.
1 HR AGO
Tried fixing the dryer. Worked for a few minutes. Heat died on it again. Fuse I just installed would need to be replaced, but no point in replacing until I know why it blew. All of what I know what to do (which is little) has been done. I will be calling maintenance to have them take a look at our exhaust piping (since I can only reach so far into the wall).

yesterday was a day of socialization for me, made new friends
1 HR AGO
Voted for my wife several times
1 HR AGO
Working on the wiki. Part of this pioneer.app VC bullshit thing just to see what folks think. Some people think it's cool, some really hate it. Makes sense.
1 HR AGO
Working on my son's docking station; I'm having to set it up for him from scratch. That's been disappointing.
1 HR AGO
Finishing letter to Sphygmus. She built some custom CSS for my wiki, and [[j3d1h]] and I have made it so public letter writers have a "voicestyle" where there is a custom font, coloration, etc. for each person.
1 HR AGO
Well, we worked further on that.
1 HR AGO
I have now been asked to play WoW and EQ. Setting up servers, but I think I don't want to play. I really don't have the time.
1 HR AGO
Expecting to hear back about the job this week. We'll see. Will continue applying.
1 HR AGO
Raylan leaves tomorrow. So, [[JRE]] is feeling it hard.
1 HR AGO
Kinda feels like life is moving in slow motion or something. Not sure what I think about that.
1 HR AGO
Oh, I finished an amazing book: The Ego Tunnel
1 HR AGO
Sounds like you are busy — I could see why playing WoW/EQ isn’t really on the table rn
1 HR AGO
What do you mean by moving in slow motion?
1 HR AGO
I have no idea. Still thinking about it. Just a feeling.
1 HR AGO
Interesting...
1 HR AGO
I feel like these past few months have absolutely flown by... it’s frustrating.
1 HR AGO
I suppose it’s a part of growing up though.
1 HR AGO
Aye. Like the months fly by in fast motion, but I'm moving in slow motion through time.
1 HR AGO
Oof... yeah, exactly.
