!! Audit:

* So much Fireman Time! Lol.
* I worked on enriching my gratitude this month, and I can see it.
* Black coffee and 85-90% dark chocolate are perfect together.
** Though, I still can't taste the difference between the budget stuff and the fancier products. I'm glad! Lol. Who the fuck wants to refine their palette for that? Does it demonstrate your class? Lol.
* The tags are pretty. They haven't served any purpose whatsoever. But, that's okay. They might! I don't know where I need them yet. The "Diem" tag (too lazy to figure out how to just put the tag in TWcode here, lol) could come in handy if I try to expand this project again.
* My sleep is getting worse. Back to vitamins. Ketamine continues to inch further. I have had several intrusive thoughts.
* Again, I have the "spinning my wheels" feeling here, even though I certainly worked hard.
* When I think very locally, my life is quite pleasant. When I start think to globally, when I see what I owe to others, when I see what we owe to each other, when I reason about the state of affairs at large, I'm getting crushed. That's the cost of being moral though.
* Gut, sleep, and brain are off this month. Own up to it, [[h0p3]].
* I have been exceptionally social this month. I'm proud of myself for that.
* I've also been spending time watching TV with the family more than usual.
