I will respond in greater detail to your note later, but let me hit a couple of things really quickly before I head out to help a family with funeral arrangements. These are things I don't want you to wonder about. 

I do not consider you a toxic person. I think of you as a seeker. There is a huge difference. 

I am delighted that you and my brother are talking. [[Charlie]] is a great person once you get through his barriers.  

Love you!

[[R]]
