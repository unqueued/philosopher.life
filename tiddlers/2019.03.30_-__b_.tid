//Fuck Capitalism Append License Sketch...clearly, I am still not ready. //

//In perfect competition, those who do not abide by [[The Moral Law]] will maintain the competitive advantage over those who do. //

The above license is only granted to entities that act in accordance with the following requirements:


!! Definitions

* Employees include, but are not limited to, temporary hires, interns, contractors, hourly workers, and salaried workers.
* Non-compete, non-disclosure, whistleblowers, etc. would be fleshed out here.


!! The Easy

* The licensee must not, explicitly or implicitly, request or schedule their employees to work more than 45 hours in any single week or work 10 hours consecutively.
* The licensee must grant 5 days accumulating paid sick leave, 5 days of unscheduled paid personal days, and 15 days of paid vacation days per year to each employee.
* The licensee does not enforce, enter into, extend, or renew any non-compete agreements with employees.
* The licensee does not enforce, enter into, extend, or renew any non-disclosure agreements with employees.
* The licensee awards 1% of the value of the company to successful whistleblowers.


!! The Hard

* The licensee pays at least a minimum wage defined by the collective vote of least paid 10% of employees.
* ...Yeah, but the workers have to own the means of production.

Outsourcing and black markets, yeah. Seems like workers owning the means of production is the only out.
