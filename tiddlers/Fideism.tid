title: Fideism

//The truth is whatever you can't escape.//

What does it mean to take sides with faith? I agree faith and reason are different. Faith is the sum of the assumptions we take up before we start making inferences. Faith is a set of {[[Axioms]]}. That we can be [[SO]] about our faiths and desires just is the source of our autonomy. That we can coherentify, modify, doubt, seek justifications, and wrestle with our faiths in hermeneutic spirals is exactly why they are so meaningful. To what principles and beliefs will be bind and constitute our identities with, and why?

There is a sense in which faith is independent of reason. It conceptually begins before we can continue to reason (though it is reasonable to start with axioms). It ought not stay independent of reason though. Insofar as fideism is deadset on reliance upon faith rather than reason, it is hypocritical and incoherent itself. I consider fideism to be the denial of realism insofar as it denies an objective link between epistemology and ontology. 

I agree that [[The Good]] as a religious concept is inescapably self-referential. It seems to me there is infinite work for we [[fff]] to compute that enables us to realize and act upon our faiths more fully which is meaningful and morally obligated. Fideism is skepticism wielded poorly. 

Perhaps I can only ever increase my confidence in the claim that I can never be certain about that which matters most. Insofar as I could be certain, the game is over. I do seek [[The End]].

Notes from [[k0sh3k]] 2/10/19: 

One of the beautiful aspects of faith is that it gives you, in faith, a license to be wrong. But how wrong can you be - what is that license? It's why I expect people to choose their faiths so wisely - I have a ridiculously high standard here. That's because I am dialectically wrestling with my own faith, and expect us all to wrestle just as hard.
