That’s good... my birth father came into town to visit Thursday. [[L]] was sick Friday. Saturday we went to Churchill downs and gattis for our niece. Sunday was Mother’s Day so we hung out with [[AA]] and them. My parents too. I helped them remodel their upstairs.

Today I’m gonna work, and prep for both a one shot tomorrow and a session for Saturday.
