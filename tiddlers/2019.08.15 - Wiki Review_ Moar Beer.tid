title: 2019.08.15 - Wiki Review: Moar Beer

* [[2019.08.14 - Afterschool Teaching: Blur]]
** I'm hoping today I'll have more time to write and talk with the kids.
* [[2019.08.14 - Wiki Review: Head Above]]
** Edited. Not a popular thing to claim for those with my training.
* [[2019.08.14 - TDL: Transitions]]
** I'm not able to control a complete keyboard. I do not understand why the n52 isn't standard equipment for professionals either. I'm going to become the best kiter on that server in time. =)
* [[2019.08.14 - Prompted Introspection: Violence]]
** Edited. Aside, I'm enjoying [[chameleon]]'s work on [[Prompted Introspection]]. I've never seen anyone outside my family do them. It pulls her onto the pages of her wiki too.
* [[2019.08.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Yale!]]
** Completed. Beer hit the spot.
* [[2019.08.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Visionlessness]]
** I have been feeling super hopeful with these analyses lately. Lol!
