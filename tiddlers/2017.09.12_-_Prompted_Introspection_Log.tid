!! What do you think of //The Help// so far?

It hasn't made me cry yet. It has an odd pace to it, and the switching from one character's point of view to another's is an interesting device. I like how the narrators see themselves as being good. They all tend to demonize the same people though. The author is gunning for it, and I am fine with that.

I don't know how far I am in the book. The characters are all female so far. Men are almost irrelevant to the plot. That's fine though. I enjoy seeing through the eyes of these characters.

Audiobook form is amazing in this case. Voice actors bring perspectives to life. 

I find myself rooting for the characters. I do chuckle sometimes. Maybe I will cry. So far:

Not amazing, but not worth my time.
