title: 2019.07.30 - Prompted Introspection: Halping

!! Describe a time you helped someone.

Sam the wisest of 'em all,<<ref "c">> I'm halping you write nĭ hăo. Hello! You must be so relieved. Perhaps just as trying to relax is a paradox, in writing this post, in answering your question, I'm helping you. By the time I'll have finished writing this paragraph, it will be true. No need to thank me.
