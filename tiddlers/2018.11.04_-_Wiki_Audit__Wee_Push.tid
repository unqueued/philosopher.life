Wow. I did not realize I had been speaking with [[2017.02.22 - Charlie: Existential Log]] way back then. Neat.

Clearly, [[Realpolitik Speculation]] had many [[Computer Musings]] in them as well. This is a spot where I should have used tagging all along. /welp, I'm gonna make mistakes.

[[RPIN]] dominates the dialectic in the early stages of the wiki. I'm dropping [[redpill]]s left and right. I am //still// unsure how I'm going to display this. Tagging is going to be absolutely necessary for it though. This is a mechanic that has been {[[About]]}-based from the beginning, and I've done a terrible job explaining the story. I hope to finally have something which makes sense. I'm grateful to have the chance to explain this narrative in [[The Remodeling]].

Completed 2017.02! It would be outstanding if I could finish 2017 by the end of this month.
