!! Audit:

* I love that I've given epic answers to some of these questions and can just point to them. Copout, non-answer, whatever. It works for me.
* The [[agi]] considerations are strong in this. The codificationism virtue theory problem is quite clear. I'm glad to get us to that precipice.
* There's solid [[FTO]] work in this log. I'm pleased about that. =)
* I love to be a smartass in this log. It's fun and funny to me.
* I am super lucky when Saint Diogenesocrates shows up.
* I'm not doing a great job of mining my wiki for examples of answers to these questions.
** Eventually, [[Search of h0p3]] will give me the necessary tooling to build custom search options just for this particular log.
* This log has become far more {[[Dreams]]}-oriented. Usually, I think of it more {[[vault]]}-oriented. I like this shift!
* I love the unicode strikethrough effect. It's fuckin' clever.
* As usual, this log is close to my heart. It pulls me onto this wiki so fuck hard.
