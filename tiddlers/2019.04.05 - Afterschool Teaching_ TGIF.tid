title: 2019.04.05 - Afterschool Teaching: TGIF

A new person, Whitney's friend, Peyton graced us today with her presence. We talked about their math classes and what we were doing for the day. Smalltalk everywhere.

We had a lot of students leaving early today.

6AB had something go very wrong as he was eating. He was crying, but he wasn't choking. I'm not sure how the peanut butter hurt him, but it looked painful. We tended to him.

No one had homework, and it's a freeday. I took a bunch to the lab. No one played on the computers though: we talked philosophy and played chess. It was fantastic. I got to treat them like my own children. We talked about what little chess theory I understand. We talked about narratives and games (I showed them that fortnite vidya too). We talked about the nature of argumentation and rhetoric. 8Gf is bright, and she got it. We talked about virtuous perception and wisdom. 

5HS is always there to the end. I talked with her for half an hour. She loves her pets. She's a lonely girl in this custody battle.
