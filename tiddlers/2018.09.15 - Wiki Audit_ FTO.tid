title: 2018.09.15 - Wiki Audit: FTO

[[Find The Others]] got a bit of cleanup. I need to recognize when a relationship is sitting there, when it's active, when it's probably dead, etc. [[T42T]] violations perhaps merit very clear inspection? I feel like I'm failing hard here. [[FTO]] takes up an enormous amount of my time.
