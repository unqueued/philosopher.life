Living like a FB Dev is not the same as merely living (well or otherwise). You sound like you are trying to rationalize (not just explaining, but justifying) their behavior.

I would agree those in poverty are not in a position to leave their job (and even then, I'm willing to consider options). Devs in Silicon Valley do have a choice though. You are correct to identify capitalism as a fundamental problem, but you've conveniently minimized their privilege too far in this case. They don't get to say "capitalism made me do it." They really did and still do have an opportunity to be moral, costly as it may be to their standard of living. They are part of the problem because this just is their expression of their moral preferences.

They might not be able to prevent evil, but that doesn't mean they should actively participate in it. Just because you can't stop the Nazis doesn't give you license to be one.

I hold programmers responsible for what they program, especially anyone living above the poverty line. There is no justification for their behavior. It's plain evil.
