title: 2019.02.07 - Wiki Review: Titletastic

* [[2019.02.06 - JRE: Shweet]]
** My brother is getting happier, more constructive, and I'm so proud of him. That dude is kicking butt.
* [[2019.02.06 - KevinKniveK: To h0p3]]
** I'll get there. 10,000 things. It looks like he needs to think too.
*** I'm watching people wrestle with it. What does it mean to be yourself? One of my concerns with people who use their real names and connect their work to their real names so explicitly is that they want to be famous, but only if they like that fame. Give yourself away anonymously as best you can folks (I realize it can never be solved). 
* [[2019.02.06 - Charlie: Vibrations]]
** Edited.
** I know Charlie's problem: he doesn't doubt others nearly enough (though he has plenty self-doubt in many respects).<<ref "2020.02.07">> 
* [[2019.02.06 - Afterschool Teaching: Chromebooks]]
** I'm feeling awful for my kids at school. Watching them is killing me inside.
* [[Artistic Idols]]
** ROFL, yup.
* [[2019.02.06 - Wiki Audit: Formunctional mroFunction]]
** [[Tri-Force Spamming]] is messy. It's more spirit than letter. I don't have time to catalogue it all. =( 
* [[2019.02.06 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Rand Dumbly Close To My <3]]
** Edited.
** REKT, BIATCH!
** However speculative, the amount of technical work in there is astounding. Well, here's hoping a learned philosopher will one day make use of it (or maybe [[GAIA]]).
* [[2019.02.06 - Prompted Introspection: Famous Places]]
** Maybe we'll get there? Probably not.
* [[2019.02.06 - Wiki Review: Jokes]]
** I think the [[KKK]] tiddler is hilarious.
* [[2019.02.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Breakfast]]
** Completed
* [[2019.02.06 - TDL: Zero Tolerance]]
** Well, I'm on my way.
