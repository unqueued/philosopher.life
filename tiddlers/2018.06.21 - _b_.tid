It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission because it's easier for someone to justify (i.e. it's computationally, economically, and socially cheaper) to themselves the disapproval embedded in forgiveness than the approval granted in permission.

Schopenhauer might want to debate it: having the desire for something is sometimes (somehow) more satisfying than having satisfied the desire itself.

I've decided that I've only been a fully functioning adult since ~25 years old at the earliest, where my neo-cortex physiology has finally completed its maturation. Autonomy, of course, comes in degrees.

One interesting aspect of being a cosmopolitan socialist who lives in the US is realizing that if my dreams for the world were to come true, I would probably not see improvements in my standard of living. In fact, I think parts of my life would become considerably less well off. I think this is true in the short term; a decade of socialism would radically alter the planet. 

Part of my optimism in my ideal conception, of course, is that I have metaethical perfectionist tendencies. A lot of what I literally value in my life I take to be universally valuable for those living today. This would not sit well with many others, but I am prepared to defend myself in the Kantian courtroom.

As your intelligence rises, what it means "to be moral" places limits and imperatives on you (and your moral expectations of all of us) which the less intelligent cannot begin to conceive.

It bothers me that people don't see the necessity of Rule of Law, for a criterion of authority, for an imperial (only centralized insofar as it is necessary for decentralized) power over all of us. Somehow, they do not believe (or want to believe, perhaps even actively aim to disable or participate in) we can decentralize this, and I think they do so for malicious reasons. I can never accept an anarchist's position except insofar as we agree that those currently in power do not deserve to have it. The pursuit of constructing morally justified governance, however, is where we part radically.
