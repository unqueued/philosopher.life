So how often do you get together with your friends each week?
THU 11:31 AM
How's it going?

Hi [[h0p3]]! Sorry I missed your notifications — work was nuts and we had family over last night.
SAT 9:15 AM
To answer your question: I try to talk to my closest friends as often as I can (depends on the friend) and see them... once a month if possible. Harder sometimes than others. 

And I’m doing well! I managed to snag an entire week off from work and I couldn’t be happier. Also, reading about your after school teaching is enjoyable. You would be trying to make the guy watching your drug test uncomfortable. XD
SAT 9:17 AM
As far as a place to start with math... not sure if this will help, but my mom used to play a game with her kids called 24. You get four numbers and have to manipulate them mathematically to get the number 24. You can use multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction.
SAT 9:50 AM
Awesome about the week off. I hope it will be relaxing and/or productive. =)
SAT 10:19 AM
There are those that I converse with about once a month, though that begins to feel just like a network or acquaintance to me. I am still thinking about the issue. It is something I talk about often with [[JRE]].

What you up to today?
SAT 2:32 PM
I was driving down to e-town (hence the silence) to see friends before we are held captive by, er I mean go to visit family.
SAT 2:35 PM
Lol. Well, I hope it is an enjoyable day for you. =)
SAT 2:37 PM
It will be! I’m not terribly excited to stay at my parents’ house, but mom would be very sad if we didn’t. At least it will be nice to see everyone.
