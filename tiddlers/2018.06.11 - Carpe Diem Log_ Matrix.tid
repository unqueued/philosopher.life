* Woke at 9:15
** My dreams continue to be quite intense. I'm sorry I can't remember them. I know I had strong emotions about them.
* Chillun hadn't done shit
* Encouragement
* Read+Write
* Coffeebliss
* Fireman Time!
* Tacos and watermelon
** I'm so pleased to have watermelon. It's the autist's delight.
* Jop actually setup a sync with me (wowsers, very few people I know take the 5 minutes it takes to do so).
** I sent her some audiobooks (she asked for me to pick...I feel unqualified). 
* We watched [[The Matrix]]. 
** I was captured by it again.
* Fireman Time!
* A beer (what is the world coming to?)
* Bed by 1:15
