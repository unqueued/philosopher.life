MAY 1 12:57 PM
Reading and writing, teaching the kids, and will head to the middle school to babysit and talk one-on-one with many (I hope to be useful to them). Still working on that letter, and I've had a systemic fungal infection (usually a sign of stress in me) and inflammation; hopefully, will be done with the first draft soon enough. Dryer broke, and I'm tired of fixing this one (we got our money's worth, gonna shoot for a different one if we can, will be using an outside drying rack until then).
