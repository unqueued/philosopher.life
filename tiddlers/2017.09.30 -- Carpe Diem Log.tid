title: 2017.09.30 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Woke before alarm
* Worked hard
* Stopped listening to //Redemption in Inidigo// at the third to last chapter.
** It was a Stephenson disappointment. I don't know how to satisfying finish that book anyways. I saw it coming; the name alone. It failed, hard. But, I'm glad I "read" what I did.
* Started listening to //The Nix//.
** Terrifyingly real to me. Hilarious too.
* Talked to JRE
* Cannabliss
* Bath of the Gods!
* Tacos
* Writing
* Talked to the kids about my new goals:
** [[The Year of Philosophy Tutoring]]
** [[The Month of Mathematics Tutoring]]
** I want to complete the Month after my job is done. 
* Writing
* Venture Bros to fall asleep.
