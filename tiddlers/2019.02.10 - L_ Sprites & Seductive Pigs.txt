How's your weekend been?
SUN 2:29 PM
Heya [[h0p3]]! My weekend hasn’t been bad, but definitely tiring. Took my sister and cousin Emily to a concert last night. Definitely felt old the next morning when my ankle randomly hurt and I didn’t want to get out of bed because I was so tired. xD
SUN 6:54 PM
Lol XD
SUN 6:55 PM
Not exactly a relaxing weekend but good nonetheless. Hoping this will be something she remembers fondly!<<ref "2020.02.12-1">>
SUN 6:55 PM
Yes. They will be good memories! =)
SUN 6:56 PM
\o/
SUN 6:56 PM
I’ve also been trying to be better about talking with my dad, because I know I don’t do it enough. [[K]]’s insistence on keeping up with everyone is rubbing off on me, which is good because it’s something I am admittedly horrible at.<<ref "2020.02.12-2">>
SUN 6:57 PM
Lol. That is awesome. =)
SUN 6:58 PM
Speaking of, I owe your wiki a solid catch-up read and am frustrated that I have yet to give it one recently.<<ref "2020.02.12-3">>
SUN 6:58 PM
There is a place you must look before all others, since I need to finish it like yesterday.
SUN 6:59 PM

SUN 6:59 PM
It's coming along. I thought I finished it. Last night I decided I wasn't done.
SUN 7:00 PM
The section in the middle set off by linebreaks is random noise.
SUN 7:00 PM
I have two rickrolls in the letter. =)
SUN 7:01 PM
I may focus on using it as a mental break from work this week<<ref "2020.02.12-4">>
SUN 7:01 PM
Yessssssss. Ancient internet memes are what I live for.
SUN 7:01 PM
Speaking of, Emily (my cousin on dad’s side) is a living internet meme and it was just the best thing. It was both sad and hilarious to me that [[AG]] had no idea what we were talking about when I’d parrot something back to Emily.<<ref "2020.02.12-5">>
SUN 7:02 PM
lol
SUN 7:02 PM
That sounds like [[j3d1h]]'s BF.
SUN 7:03 PM
He hilarious. He was spongemocking and dropping all the dank maymays with us in Discord.
SUN 7:04 PM
[[h0p3]]
SUN 7:05 PM
[[L]]
SUN 7:05 PM
I just heard you say “dank maymays” in my head and I can’t handle it. XD
SUN 7:05 PM
lol
SUN 7:05 PM
[[K]] is giving me weird looks cause I just burst out laughing. Curse you for making me actually lol and not just blow air out my nose.
SUN 7:06 PM

SUN 7:07 PM
Lol!
SUN 7:08 PM
Just to be clear: I am too old to say that phrase, correct?
SUN 7:08 PM
(see, this is a difficult one for me. I like the maymays.)
SUN 7:09 PM
As someone who is still a child at heart, I don’t think you’re ever too old to say things like that. It’s just funny to hear/read you say that because it reminds me that you can flip between super-serious-philosophical-mind and brain-fart-let’s-giggle-at-dumb-shit. It’s wonderful.
SUN 7:11 PM
Lol!
SUN 7:12 PM
That is immensely high praise, thank you. I aim to do that.<<ref "2020.02.12-6">>
SUN 7:12 PM
It’s my favorite thing about you \o/
SUN 7:12 PM
\o/
SUN 7:12 PM
Speaking of memes: I have successfully infected my older coworkers with my meme-isms
SUN 7:13 PM
Well, that is the balance I'm trying to strike in the cover letter too, btw!
SUN 7:13 PM
With their knowledge or without?
SUN 7:13 PM
Good to know! I will keep that in mind.
SUN 7:14 PM
I'm sayin', did you provide them the dinkin' flicka wisdom of going mach 5?
SUN 7:14 PM
Oh definitely with their knowledge lol
SUN 7:14 PM
What memes do they drop like its hawt now?
SUN 7:14 PM
lol... no, just “low key” memes like saying RIP for everything and my own weird sayings like calling things gucci<<ref "2020.02.12-7">>
SUN 7:15 PM
Or I’ll send them wholesome animal memes. Because who doesn’t need some cute animals every now and then?
SUN 7:15 PM
It just makes me laugh when I hear them parrot my ridiculous dialect back at me. Apparently my terribly unprofessional dialogue is infectious.
SUN 7:16 PM
Good! Some memes are that worthy.
SUN 7:17 PM
How old are these people?
SUN 7:18 PM
Like 40's?
SUN 7:18 PM
Some of em yeah
SUN 7:18 PM
Others in their early 30’s, which I grow ever closer towards.
SUN 7:19 PM
I just realized my sister is 15 years old as of last Monday. FIFTEEN, [[h0p3]]. WTF.
SUN 7:19 PM
Ancient.
SUN 7:19 PM
It is hard to imagine.
SUN 7:20 PM
3 years from now, that girl is voting, payeen 'er beels, #adulting
SUN 7:21 PM
*young woman
SUN 7:21 PM
See, I still think of her as so young, and she obviously isn't.
SUN 7:21 PM
I hope to become her friend too.
SUN 7:21 PM
I do too... she still acts so young. Gosh, she is so ridiculously innocent for a fifteen year old. Despite being the exact same age as her cousin they are practically worlds apart. It makes it hard to relate to her at times, honestly.
SUN 7:27 PM
It makes me wonder if this is how you and [[JRE]] felt trying to relate to me. Maybe even still?
SUN 7:28 PM
Sometimes, that does happen. I think that happens to all of us sometimes. There comes a point where it's quite a bit of work to share our reality maps with each other necessary for relationship-progress.<<ref "2020.02.12-8">>
SUN 7:31 PM
This is one of the things which makes having profound friendships as I age harder and harder.
SUN 7:31 PM
There's more and more story to tell.
SUN 7:31 PM
Few people who are willing and able to pay that price.
SUN 7:31 PM
Your frontal lobes are finally crystallized.  You are officially an adult brain: ╰(˙ᗜ˙)੭━☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ
SUN 7:34 PM
XD
SUN 7:34 PM
I forgot you were collecting those!
SUN 7:34 PM
_(┐「ε:)_
SUN 7:35 PM
lol, [[j3d1h]] and I are debating what that is...[[k0sh3k]] too now...
SUN 7:36 PM
The adults say: "pig"
SUN 7:36 PM
[[j3d1h]] says "person"
SUN 7:36 PM
It’s someone lying on their side.
SUN 7:36 PM
Yes!
SUN 7:36 PM
Perhaps strangely seductively?
SUN 7:36 PM
I think I have another one hold on
SUN 7:36 PM
_(:3 」∠)_
SUN 7:37 PM
Lol
SUN 7:37 PM
That is one sexy pig. I see a snout!
SUN 7:38 PM
Bacon. Please do me.
SUN 7:38 PM
[[j3d1h]] knows it is a person!
SUN 7:38 PM

SUN 7:38 PM
[[K]] has told me to calm down xD
SUN 7:39 PM
NEVERRRRRRR

SUN 7:39 PM
It’s perfect xD
SUN 7:40 PM
In all seriousness though, it’s true. It’s difficult to find people who are both genuinely interested in you enough to reach across that gap AND genuine enough at all to actually care. [[K]] and I have been realizing that more and more lately.<<ref "2020.02.12-9">>
SUN 7:45 PM
That is a painful lesson. I am sorry.
SUN 7:46 PM
It’s alright, I think it can be worth the struggle.
SUN 7:48 PM
Preach. =)
SUN 7:48 PM
It may be worded differently, but it is not unlike your Find the Others journey yeh?
SUN 7:49 PM
Aye. That sounds right to me.
SUN 7:51 PM
On a lighter and entirely unrelated note: I have an strange obsession with bringing my D&D characters to life by making character portraits. The problem is, I’m not an artist so I do so using avatar creators. So I am semi-actively seeking a character creator that has all of the options I want... which is probably unrealistic. I have found some decent free ones, but I am still not satisfied.
SUN 8:00 PM
I wonder if that means I should just try to make my own?
SUN 8:00 PM
I don't know enough about the avatar creation world to say if it's worth it. I suppose it depends on what you are after.
SUN 8:01 PM
You should show me some avatars and tell me when you like or don't like about them.
SUN 8:04 PM
Hmm... something that would allow me to make a D&D 5e character portrait (so, with all the races of D&D) with enough options to make characters more unique like freckles, scars, beauty marks, etc.
SUN 8:04 PM
Ah, that should be easy. Give me a sec.
SUN 8:04 PM
...or not because my phone is stupid. Hold on. XD
SUN 8:05 PM
So here are two different sprites I made for a tiefling paladin in my party:
SUN 8:07 PM

SUN 8:07 PM
Both were made in the same creator. I honestly hate the horn placement, as this is the only style really available. Part of that is the creator uses Fire Emblem sprites which is fairly limiting. I had to specially color her horns and eyes in the second sprite picture (using Paint) because I was so unhappy with the first one. It took me two hours to add those details.
SUN 8:09 PM
That particular creator does not have options for things like glasses or scars so I have to add it all manually. A labor of love, but not worth it if the game isn’t long-standing. :/
SUN 8:10 PM
I have made at least three different variations of my own character sprite for the same game, a young half-elf cleric. Here are two of them:
SUN 8:13 PM
Hrm. Maybe you should make your own.
SUN 8:16 PM

SUN 8:16 PM

SUN 8:16 PM
Lol!
SUN 8:16 PM
That is cool.
SUN 8:16 PM
Both are fairly different, but the first is the closest I’ve come to actually being happy with his character portrait.
SUN 8:17 PM
The second is a “make your own LoTR character” creator
SUN 8:17 PM
Which isn’t awful truthfully, but isn’t as detailed as I’d like.
SUN 8:17 PM
[[h0p3]]... I am so picky. XD I should just make my own. Not sure where to start though.
SUN 8:17 PM
Lol. Picky is good.
SUN 8:18 PM
I do think you have to make your own.
SUN 8:18 PM
I've asked [[j3d1h]] to think about it.
SUN 8:21 PM
She will know far better than I would.
SUN 8:21 PM
Oooh, good good.
SUN 8:22 PM
I am willing to build it as a side project because I am stupidly passionate about making the person in my head more tangible.
SUN 8:23 PM
It would probably be easier to just learn to draw, but I think building a program would be more educational.
SUN 8:23 PM
Neat.
SUN 8:24 PM
How far do you want to go with it?
SUN 8:24 PM
Hmmm... I want it to be simple enough sprites but with more creative detail options. So... as far as I need it to for the characters I make.
SUN 8:26 PM
But I will start simple and work my way toward more complicated as best I can. >_>
SUN 8:27 PM
It’s a weird thing to be passionate about, but I am a simple woman. lol...
SUN 8:28 PM
How education should it be? I think learning to use a drawing program is quite educational. Building your our program from scratch is going to be far more difficult, imho.
SUN 8:31 PM
educational*
SUN 8:31 PM
Hmm... maybe I should go that path.
SUN 8:45 PM

SUN 8:46 PM
If you are making a sprite a week, I think it's better to do it by hand. If you want to make 10,000 sprites. I would want to do it programmatically.
SUN 8:50 PM
If this is about more than sprites, if it's about learning to code using a project you care about, this is a fine starting project.
SUN 8:50 PM
I think the personal touch is what I’m going for. Some way to make sprite art easier would ultimately be better, which now that I’m thinking about it would probably be easier than starting from scratch.
SUN 8:51 PM
Right.
SUN 8:51 PM
It may develop into both? We shall see.
SUN 8:51 PM
It is a quest I have accepted for myself because the itch has yet to be scratched.
SUN 8:51 PM
They appear to me to be very different toolsets.
SUN 8:54 PM
They have overlap though.
SUN 8:55 PM
True. I will have to mull it over.
