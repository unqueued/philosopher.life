* I cut a bunch, including http://reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/.
* It's fascinating to me how I don't have any tech-related subs at this point. HN has me covered. 
* I feel like an idiot for not keeping AskHistorians in there (who knows, maybe I'll change my mind again!).
* ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM has been fucking hilarious.
** I had to do a double-take to figure out whether or not they were serious; Top fails me here because some of the best posts are lampooning that very mistake.
** I adore these Humans.
* Jung and Taoism are in there. Meditation subs are out. I am interested in continuing my exploration of these points of view.
** Let me say, I have profound doubts. At the very least, I need to become fluent.
