title: 2018.02.21 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Human Vampires

!! What do you think about people who take advantage of others?

I think poorly of them.

I am not shocked anymore, but I am still somehow surprised. I just haven't effectively understood the depths of human evil. It is clear that I trust people too much, that I give them the benefit of the doubt so richly undeserved with a mindless consistency that demonstrates I'm an idiot in this respect.

Humans really are garbage, by and large. There is beauty and good, but I think we're mostly failures. When I see humans taking advantages of others, I see dark-triadic vampires. I see the lack of empathy for others. I see naked zero-sum game-theoretic egoism. I see 'might makes right,' and just another expression of evolution. I think this is reality.
