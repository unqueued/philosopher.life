!! Audit:

* I answer "my wife" very often to these questions. She is clearly deeply integrated into my identity. =) I love that.
* Hikikomority, lol. Love it.
* My answers have become shorter, perhaps. I'm doing my best with these Sunday school questions.
* Stoicism has clearly been on my mind.
* I've not spent as much time directly speaking to my interlocutors as of late.
* I am referencing my work in the wiki more and more. I think this is a good thing. It shows that who I am can now be more effectively referenced. I need 'dem pointers!
* I am pleased that I take the time to point out my limitations. This is healthy.
* I have edits to make.
* There is great darkness in me this month. I see it plainly on the page.
* I obviously thought many of these questions were stupid. But, I also recognize that many stupid questions still bear fruit. It's a learning process, and I'm trying to be objectively charitable enough that I have the integrity to look at The Other's perspective of myself.
* I see the drugs in my life, and I think they are coming into more and more control.
* Lol. Non-answers are still reasonable.
* The Redpills are finally setting in. I don't feel the vertigo as strongly, although it is still there.
