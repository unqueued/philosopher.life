It's taking a giant fucking swing at Google. It's gorgeous from the beginning. Love the interplay of the sizes alluded to in the name.

Holy Moly, this book is talking about it! I'm very pleased to see it.

Collaborative Filtering, that's a good word for it. I have many variants of such a thing I use everyday for maximizing my signal-to-noise ratio.

"Measuring Sentiment," all I can hear is Humean Computation Theories of Mind.

It seems to me that when I hand over my writing to a machine, it is not me doing the writing. I am allowing something else to be the übermensch in the dialectic. I'm submitting to the "will" of the functions/principles of something external and heteronomous to me. Perhaps this is an authenticity of autonomy kind of problem. I warn you, there appear to be a great number of autonomy problematics.

However, we’re only going to optimize when the algorithm is done. If we start optimizing now, it’ll hurt our ability to improve the algorithm.

KISS

This using ELOPe to control the company internally is amazing.

The "Blackboxness" of AI is screaming at you out of the pages.

Adore the maritime-law based offshore transnational corporate "nation-states" that emerge on the high seas.

It does have some oversimplification going on, but it also has the Space Odyssey "Dave" moments.

The "pirates" feel forced to some degree, although I can speak to some of the physical security measures of data systems being immensely, hard to fathom, etc.

I love how liabilities are passed onto proxies. Wonderful recipe for disaster.

There is a beautifully deep paranoia in this book.

Will AI be able to compute a world that is larger than it effectively enough to wander like a nomad in the desert, to empirically figure it out?

I love how this is just mail/messenging to begin with. Knowing what I've known about images, video, and sound, you will find that much of reality can be illusory given the proper computer resources.
