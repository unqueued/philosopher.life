title: 2020.02.08 - Sphygmus: DMV & Hax

"""
[10:57 AM]  robotic_scarab: wow that column app thing is disturbing as fuck
[10:58 AM]  h0p3: `/shiver`

[11:31 AM]  robotic_scarab: I hope the DMV goes smoothly for you today and everything you need done gets done! :triumph:

(idk if that emoji makes sense, it's supposed to be a determined face, lol)
[3:02 PM]  h0p3: \o/ we did it, well the 3/4's that mattered, at least
[3:03 PM]  h0p3: Yeah, that make emoji makes sense to me. ;P
[3:04 PM]  h0p3: Also, I am surprised that you don't use your desktop more.
[3:04 PM]  h0p3: You are going fully mobile, I think.
[3:06 PM]  robotic_scarab: Yay! I'm glad it finally got worked out. :)
[3:06 PM]  robotic_scarab: It's hard to want to use my desktop when the gfx card fan is so grindy sounding + I'm never really at home to use it
[3:07 PM]  robotic_scarab: If I address the gfx noise issue and my boyfriend and I get moving in together worked out, that might change again?
[3:07 PM]  robotic_scarab: dunno! It is interesting tho :)
[3:11 PM]  h0p3: Yes. That may change back.
[3:12 PM]  h0p3: Especially if you go for VR set as well. Multi-player VR sounds like a blast.
[6:04 PM]  robotic_scarab: yes! I've never played a multiplayer VR game but I'm sure it's neat
[6:04 PM]  robotic_scarab: oy vey, my thinkpad has a microSD card reader but no way of ejecting the card :scream:
[6:05 PM]  robotic_scarab: it went all the way in & didn't click back out at all -- freaked out thinking it was stuck but managed to get the micro SIM slot below it off & wiggle the SD card out with a paperclip from below
[6:05 PM]  robotic_scarab: talk about bad design tho, yikes :S
[10:37 PM]  h0p3: =(. Pretty much unusable then. Do you think it's just your particular laptop?

[1:21 AM]  robotic_scarab: no, I think it's probably an issue with the model (I found a video on youtube of a person having the same problem, supposedly after getting it repaired)
[1:21 AM]  robotic_scarab: either very few people use micro SD so there aren't reports of it online, or maybe I got a lemon with a bad click-spring
[1:21 AM]  h0p3: You may be forced to use an adapter. Eww. =(.
[1:21 AM]  robotic_scarab: yeah, unfortunately the adaptor I have is USB 2.0 so writes take forever
[1:22 AM]  robotic_scarab: or I could still use it and gingerly unstick the SD card every time with a paperclip XP
