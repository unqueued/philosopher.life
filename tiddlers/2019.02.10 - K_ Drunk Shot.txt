Do you think D&D is better while drunk?
WED 8:47 AM
I think it depends on your group and the expectations overall.
WED 8:55 AM
Makes sense.
WED 8:56 AM
We played in a drunk shot and it was a blast, but part of me thinks there were people not having fun.<<ref "2020.02.12">>

Who wasn't having fun and why, btw?

Powergamer. It was RP heavy and the boss was homebrewed so he couldnâ€™t cheat.<<ref "2020.02.12-3">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.12-1" "Disinhibiting myself tremendously has often been useful for making D&D fun. The things I've found most fun in life tend to be weakened by alcohol. I want to fully be there, present, and kicking ass at what I'm having fun at. Maybe it's a starter or something. I just don't get drunk with many people; it's something I do only with immediate family, and even then, usually just by myself (my offspring have been the //camel that broke the straw's back// on plenty of evenings where I chose to just get smashed).">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.12-2" "You know what: they've planned on RPing with us for years, but haven't. Maybe I should recognize that they don't really want to, lol.">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.12-3" "Cheating? You mean looking it up in a book? Yeah, that's a shitty powergamer. I've yet to play a version of DND that couldn't be broken in half; WOTC are fucking awful at building balanced and stable games, lol `/smh`. The books are trivialized by a leet powergamer. This is why I'm trying not to metagame; it's ludologically pointless. Maybe he means something else here. I don't know.">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.12-4" "Also, I fucked up somewhere. Look at the dates of 2019.02.10 - K:...there's two. WED and SUN, lol. Fuck. Okay, I'm going to sit on it for now.">>
