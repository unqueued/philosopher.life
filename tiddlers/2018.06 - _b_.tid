!! Audit:

* Ethics, politics, agency, psychology...the usual philosophical worries.
* My brother shows up, but with the addition of [[JRE]], I think I now will just categorize it correctly.
* Sometimes [[/b/]] is eminently quotable.
* Rabbitholes are exceedingly clear and disjointed in this directory.
* I still have extremely strong feelings about these. Jesus. This log is always crazy expressive to me. 
* It is weird to compare myself to another author.
* I see some {[[Principles]]} and [[Wiki Audit]] work in here. I'm grateful that I wrote it down, even if it I didn't have the will or ability to categorize it as I'd have preferred.
** You are autistic, homie. Let it go!
* I really did feel lonely at the end of the month.
* Here's what shocking to me: I have almost nothing in this log. I'm used to having way more content to deal with. Is this a good thing? It easily could be. Often [[/b/]] exists simply because I don't know where to put something. Knowing where to put things with greater consistency is a good thing. Another worry, however, is that I'm not actually expressing my pure being stream-of-consciousness enough. I will need to sit on it.
