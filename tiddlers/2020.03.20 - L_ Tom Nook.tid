[12:34 PM] h0p3: Yo, yo, how's it going?
[5:12 PM] Sohalia: Hey! It’s going so well. The new Animal Crossing just came out and I am diving completely into it. I’ve basically been playing it since my lunch xD
[9:06 PM] h0p3: Noice. I hope it's a source of pleasure and chillaxation.

[9:26 PM] Sohalia: It’s funny actually, people mock Tom Nook (the guy who sells you your house/who you become indebted to in the beginning with no real choice) for being a dick, but in all honesty you don’t HAVE to pay him back. Ever. There is no time limit, no real reason for you to pay off your debt unless you want to or desire a bigger house.
[9:29 PM] Sohalia: It’s a game that forces you to take things at a slower pace, but more to test your patience than to be annoying like a mobile game. You can game the system by fucking with the internal clock, but it can make your gameplay funky. Other than that, there is no real way to “pay for fun”
