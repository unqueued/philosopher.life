title: 2019.01.19 - Wiki Audit: Stuff and Things

Still working on [[PSM]]. It's coming along. I need something to say to people. I'm not sure what we are doing exactly. I also don't have the only vision. I should provide my opinion on it.

---

[[Links: https://REDACTED.studio/]] is not working. Hrm. I need to find the answer.

---

You'll note [[Wiki Audit]] is out of [[Core Daily Requirement]]s for now. It's just been too busy!

---

I talked with [[Sphygmus]], and I think I have more reason to pause [[The Remodeling]] so that I can get the wiki to firmcoding and functioning buttons. Letters then wiki internals.

---

Subtitle for the wiki has changed. I guess year, the number of audit pass/attempts (perhaps a year behind? I've never completed a full pass though), and a poor guess as to the semantic versioning. This doesn't capture it correctly, but it's closer. This is not easy to nail down at all.

Cleanup on aisle [[redpill]]. Also [[alias]]ing for [[Realpolitik Speculation]].
