!! When was the last time you cried?

Today. I stumbled upon this:

I'm crying as I write this right now. 

This kid doesn't know her own name, that's how traumatized she is. Look at her answer these questions. Heartbreaking doesn't even begin to describe it. This girl is trying to smile in the face of the end of her life as she knows it. Look as her bravely holds back her tears. She is alone. She's had nothing to eat, and she is ashamed, overwhelmed, and shattered.

It kills me inside. The grief and anger are hard to contain.

I hate myself and who we are as I watch this video. I'm sitting here in front of my computer, watching a video of this child's interview halfway across the planet in my comfortable chair. I have never faced anything like she has. I just want to hold her. I need to stop this. I need to restore her. She doesn't deserve this. How could this happen? What can I do? 

If God existed, I would tell him to go fuck Himself.<<ref "1">> If you do exist: fuck you. Burn in hell you psychopathic piece of shit. I fucking hate you. How dare you allow the world to be like this! How could you allow this? You do not merit praise. You do not care about your creations. It would have been better than we did not exist at all. You are the first cause, oh mighty master of existence, and thus you are responsible for this evil. Just God my ass; eat pigshit and die, you abomination.

To those who //actually//  caused this: kill yourselves. Either do so literally (the easy way out), or do so figuratively or indirectly by ending who you are via erasing yourself and radically reprogramming yourself and the world around you (the better way). Stop this!

This image is haunting. The loop is a splinter in my mind. I am powerless. I can only taste a drop of her suffering, and I cannot bear it. This image shows me what it means to hate and love humanity at the same time (in different respects). 

I am a worthless witness to this evil. She does not deserve tragedy, and we do not deserve forgiveness. I know I didn't pull the trigger. I know the world is not on my shoulders alone. Her suffering is not all my fault, but a drop of it is. We will not restore her. I weep. 

The worst part is that I know deep down, the reason I want this to stop is that my empathy makes me feel her pain, and I just don't want to feel pain. What //really// and ultimately is the cause of the appearance of altruism, morality, and the desire to restore her is my desire to avoid the pain I'm feeling (selfish). 

I bet if I read a blurb about this event instead of watching her interview, my empathy may not have been activated, and I probably wouldn't have felt this way. My zealous reaction is rooted in selfishness. None of us are good, and we never can be. That's who we all are. We are egoistic, selfish creatures. 

At best, in an overdetermined way, I wish we were not who we are. I am so sorry, child.
