title: Hidden: Erotica

I want to push the notion of consent to the edge. Imagine a brain chip/surgery/superpower/other mechanic (the consent of this mechanism is the only thing that must be handled by narrative/explanation or bracketed) that enabled another person to mirror-experience the feelings that I have, even if they can't mirror the cognition. So, for example, thinking 2+2=4 doesn't transmit to another person, but when I stub my toe, they feel it. Essentially, this is affective Empathy for my affectations (but not my cognition). The rest of their fastmind and slowmind still has to process it, deal with it, and think about it. 

Here's where the mechanic gets obviously erotic. When I'm feeling pleasure, they are feeling pleasure. In fact, they have ridiculous incentives to make me feel pleasure. And, my pleasure is going to affect how they choose to reason and behave. They still consent to having sex with me because it literally and directly makes them feel good. 

Those would make some for some very interesting stories.
