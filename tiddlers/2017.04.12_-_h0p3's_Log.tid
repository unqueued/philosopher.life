!! How is your health?

Fine.

!! What happened? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

Not much. I'm there. Ups and downs. I am who I am. I can program myself though.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technologic, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself.

I may not be maximizing utility. You can't wait for the problem to hit you, you need to go out and solve it before it happens. You need to re-examine your problems, flaws, or attack surfaces. 

!! What are you going to do about what happened?

I went to an Occupational Therapy Expo at [[k0sh3k]]'s college. It was fairly good. It was a shotgun approach, and several things clicked more than others for myself and my son. I think the Social Stories booth was by far the most interesting and useful looking. I want my son to study this carefully, to realize what he is up against, to understand what he needs to understand in a broader theoretical landscape kind of way.

I'm walking through the {[[Principles]]} page with the kids. I want them to start building objects on their wiki, growing them, and evolving on their wikis. I can say this, writing this wiki has to be one of the most valuable things I've ever spent my time on. I've done a lot of cool shit in my life, let me tell you. This is so valuable that it actually is a profound utility machine for my life. It's the gift that keeps on giving. I am so happy I have somewhere to write down my thoughts, to say what I think, to think about things carefully, to have "someone" to talk to (even if it is only myself).
