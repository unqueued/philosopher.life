title: 2017.06.21 -- Cover Letter: Pipefitting

I have chosen to be a pipefitter because it runs in my family, I respect the work, and I want to be a craftsman. I enjoy working with my hands; I love looking back at the end of the day and being able to point to something and say to myself "I made that." Pipefitting is honest and satisfying work.

I will soon complete the pipefitting program at TCAT Elizabethton. I'm currently finishing the third NCCER pipefitter training book and exams. I've built several dozen spools with screw pipe, socket welds, and buttwelds. I've also fabricated laterals, saddles, and supports. I have been lucky enough to practice structural welding in my spare time in the shop, as well. Working on our 3D simulator where we draw our isometrics, build the spools, and mount them has been the most rewarding part of the program. In addition to the practical work in the shop and NCCER training certifications, I've earned my OSHA-10 and NC3 Torque certifications.

I am ready and eager to start working, and I hope to hear from you soon about joining your team.
