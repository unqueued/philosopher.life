!! Audit:

* I got sick of auditing my wiki this month. I took a huge break from it. I needed it.
* I have seriously revamped and provided vision to much of this wiki. There is a structure emerging. I see the purpose in it more and more. 
* {[[About]]} was a giant monster. I'm glad I can now just edit it at will. It's something I was too afraid to edit in a way. Now I see what I'm trying to accomplish. I can continue to tweak it until it is time for a new revamp iteration (hopefully not for many years).
* I'm so proud of myself for being willing to switch gears, to move the goalposts to something more practical, to realize that this is a long-term process, and I shouldn't expect perfection immediately. 
* Many of these are incredibly brief, and I'm not going to feel bad about it. This is a variant of the [[Wiki Review Log]] in a sense.
* Seldon, I'm so proud of my work. I mean, I know it's no where close to where I want it to be, what I hope it will eventually become, but I'm clearly pushing that snowball to where it needs to be.
