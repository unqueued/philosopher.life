title: 2018.08.25 -- Deep Reading: Introducing Anthropology

Admittedly, I think learning about all the cultures isn't so important, but learning deeply about a several (to varying [[dok]]) is essential. There comes a point where it is a morally arbitrary characteristic. I do not worship "culture" in itself, but only insofar as it is objectively a good thing. Contextualism, of course, requires quite a bit of thought.

The discipline is definitionally a Humanity to me. Logos doesn't mean science everywhere, even when we want it to. That doesn't mean it isn't empirical.

Well, I did the Montaigne thing here, and I went through the book mainly for fun and curiosity, even though I didn't feel very challenged by the book.
