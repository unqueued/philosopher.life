title: 2019.01.03 - Wiki Review: Why I Need A Script

* [[2019.01.02 - /b/]]
** I'm going with it though. That terrible [[h0p3]]speak.
* [[2019.01.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Draper's Deep, Yo]]
** That was a short response.
* [[2019.01.02 - Prompted Introspection: Bob]]
** Not sure if I got the wording right, and I really don't care. Lol.
* [[2019.01.02 - Wiki Review: Oh God.]]
** It's going to be hell for a bit, I think.
* [[2019.01.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Oops]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.01.02 - TDL: Physical]]
** Right in time.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Find The Others]]
** What a [[Leet]] fucking project this turned out to be.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Vault]]
** Another year of not doing anything in it.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Root]]
** This looks so much better than what I have right now.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Dreams]]
** Some dumb shit there.
* [[2019.01.02 - MTG Log: Almost Not]]
** Sadly, I can see they are better off getting to their math again.
* [[Frequent Project]]
** Ditto.
* [[Frequent Log]]
** I adore this move so far.
* [[2018 - Deep Reading]]
** Well, it's better than nothing.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Deep Reading]]
** I'm as ashamed for this as [[TDL]].
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Focus]]
** That hasn't been modified in forever (directly). The [[Hub]] (and [[Pin]]) are still used more than any other [[Root]]ed directory content.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Cryptographic Verification]]
** You may vanish. We shall see.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Contact h0p3]]
** Contentious, even more than I planned for.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Computing]]
** The most organic pile here, possibly.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Be A Good Dad]]
** I'm embarrassed for not doing this sooner.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Art]]
** I have so much to do. 
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Antipleonasmic Catholicon]]
** I desperately hope to revamp that place. It needs a cleaning in [[The Remodeling]].
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: AIR]]
** I have no idea if this will change significantly.
* [[Poem: I Kan Ye Haz Messiah?]]
** Lol. It's such an interestin clown-serious mixture.
* [[RGM: Working Backwards]]
** Plausible SOMETHING.
* [[/b/: IS LEAKING!]]
** No idea what I'm going to do or what it even means.
* [[WWDD]]
** I'm still thinking about it. [[kickscondor]] has sent me into the desert.
** I love the popup look.
* [[2019.01.02 - Seeking Sphygmus: Emotional]]
** I didn't talk to her about it. I want her to know that if I'm bad for her, she should tell me and leave (I say that to everyone I love...I utter the words to make sure they can hold me accountable to them).
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: About]]
** `/bow` - You have changed me forever.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: 1uxb0x]]
** I hope this continues to grow this year.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Wiki Review]]
** I'm wondering if this will need more retireshots. It's fairly crystallized.
* [[2018 - Wiki Review]]
** Like Kanye, I am still so proud of this thing.
* [[2018.12 - Wiki Review]]
** Still taking the pulse even if I forgot last night. 
*** [[Sphygmus]]' button would have been perfect on the phone, but the phone is still acting up in some cases.
* [[2018 - Wiki Audit]]
** I don't know what to do about that dating scheme. =/
*** I realize this seems like a function which TW was born to solve. I'm not so sure.
* [[2019.01.02 - Afterschool Teaching: Physical]]
** This one was. `/facepalm`
* [[2019.01.02 - Computer Musings: Grammar Tooling]]
** Not everything is up to you, sir.
* [[2017 - Wiki Audit]]
** I'm not sure if I could be prouder. That project has fucking skyrocketed.
* [[2019.01.02 - Retired: Wiki Audit]]
** `/salute`; it has been a helluva a year.
* [[2019.01.02 - Wiki Audit: Grind]]
** I can see [[hlexicon]] is still evolving, particularly in [[WWDD]].
* [[2018.12 - Wiki Audit]]
** Bravo, sir.
* [[Rick & Morty: Fanfic Brainstorming]]
** Maybe one day? Do I really have time and inclination. Yeah, I could do it, but should I?
* [[2018 - TDL]]
** This is a rough place for me.
