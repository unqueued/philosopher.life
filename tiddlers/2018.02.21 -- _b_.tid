Okay, it's obvious you don't //like// me. That we can agree on. I also think you don't actually //love// me either. You will disagree, and here is what you must realize: you love a fictional person who isn't me, but somehow looks like me. You only love who you want me to be, but you don't actually love me. Your "love" for me is in virtue of liking some hypothetical person. That is not love, not unless you are correct about "what is best" for me. Unfortunately, you fall flat on your face there. Your ignorant, narrow, twisted interpretation of [[The Good]] means you don't actually love me.
