** Conservative and too charitable, but worth reading.

** I was lucky enough to research the chemicals I put in my body (for the most part). I'm glad I skipped out on opiates, among others.

** Defining liberal is probably impossible. Too many minds, definitions, ideas, and lack thereof. 
** I identify as a person who sees humanity as selfish, believes we ought not be, and sees the role of government as facilitating the end of psychopathy while maximizing empathic, virtuous, generous actions, following a maximin Rawlsian rule. I'm a redpilled socialist without much hope (but I have to try to hope anyway).

** Let us learn to use people more effectively.

** I think cognitive and affective empathy are far more complicated than this implies. The affective affects cognition strongly. Your rTPJ does the bulk of your faster-acting empathy work, and it's affective. Furthermore, cognition in the frontal lobes trains the rTPJ, habituates empathic virtue and vice, and may even find ways of empathizing around it. They do not peel apart nicely; they are woven together.

** I'm always down for bashing libertarians, amiright? 
** I'd like to point out that sane socialists are deeply concerned with efficiently allocating resources, including government spending.

** Like TPP, I completely agree with blocking the merger, but Trump's reasons are fucking awful.

** Yet another look at the topic. Not always a fan of this conservative look, but I pay attention anyway.

** Male prostitution. I wonder what they give.

** I hate businessinsider with a burning passion.
** Define psychedelic. I can tell you cannabis heightens the experience of a variety of drugs, including classic psychedelics. For me, with large enough doses it is definitively psychedelic on its own. I can't speak for others though, since it may simply be activating HPPD related neural pathways forged through standard hallucinogens, etc. that others don't have. Cannabis does alter one's perceptions at least temporarily. It changes our minds longer term through meme and causal experience alterations (which cascade into belief/desire changes when one isn't high). It also alters one's perceptions at least temporarily while it sits in your system; it can take months to eliminate that effect. Other permanent alterations are also possible.

** Good riddance Abrahamic religions.

** I never thought about this way. That actually makes sense.

** We all continue to be fascinated by it. Its prevalence and strength in American culture is especially interesting to me. I have no idea what it means.
** Serious ethical problems here. 
** It is unclear if and when we should integrate placebos into standard medicinal practices and regimens.

** That is not how I use social media. I think the meme is cute though, what can I say?

**Fascinating. This is an interesting materialist perspective on post-modernism, imho. The philosophical roots aren't explored enough, from the look of it.

** I wish I saw a satisfying solution.
* http://www.catonmat.net/blog/programming-competitions-work-performance/
** Of course, what makes the best programmer would require not only doing well in such a competition, but understand how the flaws of writing code under such constraints, and a wide variety of social considerations. 
** Being the kind of person who enters the competitions might be seen as a strike against you (although, these are regular "Google interview" questions). Being the kind of person capable of performing well, if needed, at writing quick hacks isn't necessary bad at all though.
* https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-lasting-mental-health-isnt-normal
** 17% eh? Let me cast some doubt on this. I think being selfish, willfully-ignorant, or malicious are forms of mental illness as well. They may not standardly be thought of as such because "good for whom" doesn't often hurt them directly. I'm pretty sure I've never met a fundamentally mentally healthy person. It's a spectrum. That kind of moral luck mixed with actually being moral is just unlikely.

** Hypernormalization folks.
** Enemies of the State.
