title: Homeschooling Both Children

I very much appreciate having [[Homeschooling 1uxb0x]] and [[Homeschooling j3d1h]]. They are key to planning and thinking about them individually when it comes to homeschooling. However, I have principles that they keep in common, these are general concepts and strategies that they both share, the tactical implementation and application, however, varies with the individual child. I need a place to think about the collectively, just as I do for them individually. This is that place.

I build templates here. I build concepts here. I then go and apply them to each child. This is for more broadly universalized content. We will have a basic structure like this:

*Academic Gameplan:

** [[2017.04.15 - xxxx: Gameplan for Homeschooling]] 
** etc.

* You do the following chores each (or every other) day as needed: 
** You clearn your downstairs area
** Your perform basic cleaning of your room (bed, desk, drawers, etc.)
** You clean the kitchen (on rotation)
** You push your laundry through when you have a load to do

* You do the following chores each week:
** You clean the xxxxx bathroom
** You completely clean your room

Gameplan Structures will look like this:

* Morning Routine – 30 minutes
* Elective: Cosmetology/Curation – 30 minutes
* Math – 60 minutes
* Writing – 60 minutes
* Vocational Theory – 60 minutes
* Lunch – 60 minutes
* Vocational Practicum – 60 minutes
* Reading – 60 minutes
* Social Studies – 30 minutes
* Elective: Spanish, Language Arts – 30 minutes

We are working on empathizing with ourselves, honesty, self-reflection, working hard, doing our best, identifying with our future selves, executive functioning, delaying gratification, thinking about and applying utilitarianism, appreciating and working with our virtue theoretic identities and practices, and understanding the Kantian point of view.

We are working to understand the redpilled nature of the world together, to understand the power dynamics and structures of the world, to appreciate and be skilled in the art of socializing, and to have the means to be happy in a dire world.
