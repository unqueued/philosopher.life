Daaaaaaaaannnnnny...Lol. This is the first creepy thing to me so far.

I am struck by how the "revealer" of reality (or alternate reality/hyperreality/simulracum) is this supernatural god who could be benevolent but instead is not in this case. It downright Cartesian->Heideggarian->Baudrillardian (Malebranche, whatever, a thousand philosophers have seen this demonlight). But, when I think about the intentions and consequential aspects of the revealer, I see that the truth can be horrifying, it burns us alive. I have changed my mind about the nature of the supernatural in King's work. It does play a role that cannot be removed without detracting from the meaning of the story.

King makes it clear how evil is schizophrenic, but I wish he made it clearer how schizophrenic experiences are not fundamentally the error of the experiencer. That conceptual point should be driven home harder than he has.

I admire what King does. He makes me sick to my stomach. I don't think I can read more of this, at least not for a while.
