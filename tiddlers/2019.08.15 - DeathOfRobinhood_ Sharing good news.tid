title: 2019.08.15 - DeathOfRobinhood: Sharing good news

Hi h0p3,

I hope you and your family are doing well!

The news I am sharing with you is that I am recently engaged to the angel Selah.

Selah is an Celestial whose work entails the shadowing, instructing, and caring for, of teenagers with severe developmental disabilities.

Her lovely arms and hands, great masts from which hang the banners of love, are scarred from the countless unmoderated deathgrips of ones in the grips of fear and love. Her smile, which flashes like lightning from the east to the west, has gaps delved by the sudden blind jolts of ones living in dark cognitive prisons. Her heart is a vast mine, its chambers adorned with the jewels of patience and compassion. She is the one who has pledged to cast her lot with this petty, soft-wristed wretch before you. 

I would like to tell you more about how we met, but this may have to wait until you too believe in miracles.

So!

...we're still figuring out a date, but we've agreed on an unostentatious ceremony that places Christ as the focal point and that honours the unhonoured in our community.

Rejoice with me; weep with me; for this too is a death,

Ivan
