[1:32 AM] robotic_scarab: i'm messing around with data styles and I have NO IDEA how this happened but it's so cool
[1:32 AM] h0p3: haha
[1:32 AM] h0p3: That is cool.
[1:34 AM] h0p3: That weaving of styles is neat. Like, it doesn't even matter what the words say at first, you know it's about something. Reminds me of The Matrix rain where they pick out the color of people's hair from the symbols.
[1:36 AM] robotic_scarab: long shot, but got a link to the matrix rain clip? doesn't immediately ring bells for me

[1:37 AM] robotic_scarab: oh man this is going in my wiki :)
[1:39 AM] robotic_scarab: styling the links in the sidebar by tiddler seems like a pretty extravegant? superfluous? addition, but I'm really enjoying having it
[1:43 AM] h0p3: So, I'm probably the first to call out things for being extravagent and superfluous (it's that blasted rhetoric, it needs to get off my lawn!). I don't think it's undue ricing in this case though. You USE that tool a lot. But, I'm saying there's actually a functional difference to it. Where to draw the lines of the functional value (beyond the aesthetic which also is a sufficient reason to some extent) is not something I understand well enough. I'm going to bet that stylistic differences and color distinctions show up very strongly for you from both natural and trained virtue of the practice.
[1:43 AM] h0p3: This is part of that "glancing" problem to me. I assume you pick out what matters or reason more effectively about the whole with it. I think it's a functional experiment here, on top of being cool, of course.
[1:46 AM] robotic_scarab: agreed!
[1:46 AM] robotic_scarab: i think that's something that also..hm, maybe didn't help me make distinctions at first? because I wasn't used to using it -- but as I work in my wiki with it enabled, it becomes more & more of a signal
[1:55 AM] robotic_scarab: curious -- in purged, is that content removed from your wiki, or reintegrated in places, or a combo of both?
[1:55 AM] h0p3: Completely removed from the current wiki. It can only be found in snapshots.
[1:56 AM] h0p3: Pure junk, usually.
[1:58 AM] h0p3: I try to be slow to delete things in my wiki. I often don't know what it is going to valuable to me later on. Plus, I'm a packrat hoarder paranoically concerned with holding all these memories in my horcrux-pensieve. That part of me will die forever if I don't keep it, right? Lol.
[1:58 AM] robotic_scarab: yeah i feel that a lot
[1:59 AM] h0p3: When I'm doing [[The Remodeling]], however, I might purge as part of the restructuring (and then it is more the reintegration).
