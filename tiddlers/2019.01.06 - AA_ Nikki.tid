How’s your weekend?

Yeah, pretty good. Had a party I attended last night; [[k0sh3k]]'s co-worker throws it each year. It's a fascinating experience each year, fairly anxiety inducing, and repeatable experiment to reason about [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]]'s development.

Easier family time tonight than usual, which is a blessing.
JAN 6 6:11 PM
That’s great!
