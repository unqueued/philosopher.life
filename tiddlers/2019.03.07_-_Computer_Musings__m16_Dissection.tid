title: 2019.03.07 - Computer Musings: m16 Dissection

I've opened it. The case was designed for it, though I still think Lian Li are better. Regardless, the internals are gorgeous. It's weird to see only half the RAM slots used with 128GB (supposedly).

No dust, special plastic lid/container over the good stuff. The fans sit above the drives; they are externally detachable. Lol! It feels like legos.

I can get SATA to fit the SAS ports on hotswap. I'm missing two of the drive trays. I'll have to cobble something together for that shit. It's finicky too.

There is a weird USB port and microSD built into the one of the PCI-based risers. Conveniences for the pros, I assume.

Removable PCI modules. Wat. Am I in heaven?

Nope. Bad news, bro: 6 PCI slots, only two x16, and unfortunately, they are at the top. I can't use double-slot. ARG! I can't dremel my way out of this one cleanly (well, I don't want to!). I may have to do it. FUCK.

Uh, there's a card here, and I don't know what it is. Never seen anything like it. Never seen them ports before. Surely, it must be a CIA surveillance device. I'm just going to wait until I have an OS to see what it is.

That looks like a very expensive PSU. 2 Ethernet ports, praise jeebus. Will dump some other nic cards to make it more convenient. I really should be able to route with this, and not just as an edgerouter.

This is designed for a container I do not own. The "ears" that stick out look fragile to me. 

Fired it up. [[j3d1h]] says it sounds like a wind tunnel simulator. It's crazy loud. It boots up fine. The BIOS is unlike anything I've ever seen. It's slow, has a lot of pausing breakpoints and then automatically carries on. Manjaro spits up a couple errors about BIOS, but  I connected to the interwebs. VGA ports suck. =(

Bad news is that the BIOS requires the fans to be in place or I get a critical failure. I might be able to turn that off, but I doubt it. I could manually disable the fans themselves, but it might also detect that, lol. That might need to be the next step. 

Alternatively, I could fine other ways to muffle it. I might even be able to just run it out side, lol. Problems thus far I have to solve:

* VGA blows, you need even a minimal single slot GPU.
* The fans are hell. 
** If I can't solve this, forget the graphics.
