title: 2017.04 -- Diet Log

Average calories per day: 2098.5

I eat a fruit. That's good. I don't eat enough vegetables. I now eat something for dessert every day. Salads have been kicking ass. I should eat more salads. I like to load them with vegetables, and the dressing I use is delicious while not costing many calories (that's hard to find!).
