[[Wiki Audit: Remodeling]]

{{Wiki Audit: Remodeling}}

---

Tried the Unilink plugin. It solves one of my problems nicely, but unfortunately, it breaks references. That's unacceptable to me. It freezes my Xeon; I don't even want to know what it looks like on another machine. Transclusion is the way to go for now...I think.

Tried adding KeeBoord for faster tag completion. I keep getting this error:

`TypeError: this.wiki.addToStory is not a function`

---

The Complete Audit is extremely search intensive. Hrmm...Maybe I should call this //The Remodeling//.

---

SnR: "{Home}" for "[[Root]] (previously `[[{Home}]]`)"

---

Dropping a no non-sense asswhoopin' on {[[Principles]]}. FUCK YEAH!

Uh...I can't italizice/bold from shortcuts anymore? What's the difference?
