title: 2019.09.07 - Prompted Introspection: Cypher

!! If you could choose what to come back as, what would it be?

I've tried responding to this before: [[2017.12.18 - Prompted Introspection Log: Reincarnation Wish]]. I don't mind a ridiculous question today. So, uh, thank you, Samwise? 

I still need to understand the mechanics, but you already know my answer if I get to choose the context beyond my subjective perspective (the best of all possible worlds, of course). I'm feeling like dark matter or someone with superior eidetic memory who experiences orgasms constantly. I don't want to remember [[nothing|Cypher's Choice]], though. You hear me?
