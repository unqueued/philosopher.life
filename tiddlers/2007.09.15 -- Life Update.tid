title: 2007.09.15 -- Life Update

I haven’t written anything of consequence in a while. I decided I’d make myself useful and write an update. Let’s see…/activate stream of cons…Oh wait, err../activate poorly organized non-transition-based chaotic writing created by the postmoderns…GO! Zerg! Go!

The pregnancy is a bit rougher this time. k0sh3k has been sick 24/7, but (luckily) she has not thrown-up too much. Everyone says that this is a sign/omen that we are having a boy. I don’t know. I do know that k0sh3k’s migraines have subsided for now, and this is an answer to prayer (perhaps indirectly–again, I don’t know). Additional ailments include (watch my SP?) varicose veins, a hyperextended knee (or feeling thereof), a larger set of pains due to her ligaments stretching more rapidly, spotting, heightened sensitivity (and she is even more ticklish), soreness (weight translated from one spot to another on her body, makes the back carry weight differently), lowered bladder and stomach volume (eat/go more often).

As a sidenote, the heightened sensitivity seems like something that is a human adaptation, giving mothers more information to help keep them out of danger. But, it can be overwhelming for her.

Of course, many of these are to be expected. Some of them are exhibited more intensely during this pregnancy than the last. The doctors will always say “every pregnancy is different”. And, I certainly want to be reasonable and stay away from superstition. But, I must admit, this pregnancy has been much harder on k0sh3k. I do my best to help make sure she is comfortable.

We know it will be worth it.

Additionally, we find out the gender in a few weeks (another Ultrasound, woot!). If it is a boy, then we will name him 1uxb0x M. If it is a girl, then we will name her either a.) Elia Mariah-Abigail (perhaps not hyphenated), or b.) Mariah Elia-Abigail (ditto). 1uxb0x was easy to choose (we chose it a long time ago), but the girl’s name has been a struggle. I’ll admit it is very difficult to match the oomph and dignity of j3d1h S. In any case, if it is a daughter, her name will mean: My father rejoices in a sea of bitterness because my God is Yahweh. That name owns. It reminds me that my children don’t belong to me–and that sucks. How could I possibly want my kids to live in the agony of being a true Chosen Christian? Argghh. I mean, we know we should raise them to sacrifice themselves–but why should I sacrifice my children. Blast you Abraham!@!! This is your fault. I officially am (Infinite-Splitatives ftw) angry at that man (even if *is* awesome).

Which reminds me, why do people always go for Moses and David in the OT? Abraham and Elijah were the bomb. David and St. Peter are similar characters. They are retarded, but God loves them anyway (something we all aspire to achieve). There is a natural literary Charisma in which those characters pop off the page, and people want to be them. Moses and David screwed up too much to be admired. We recognize we are closer in character to Moses and David, but we wish we were closer in character to Eli and Abram. Yeah, Hardcore–like JB (John “teh” Baptist). In the end, Eli and Abram are better and even cooler Biblical character.

Speaking of temperature, it is breaking 100 degrees out here. I’m frying. I’m not going to like that aspect of Thailand. The heat was good in a suit…for my (drum roll please) interview. It was a 2-hour interview for the position of “Strategic Communication Quality Analyst”. I doubt I got the job, but it would be awesome if I did.

We’ve been applying for jobs like crazy. I want out of this one. We need enough money to actually get to Thailand (the logistics of this sort of thing are fairly complex and expensive). For now, to use my dad’s phrase, we are “spinning our wheels” and getting nowhere. It is unfortunate that we are forced into a position in which k0sh3k will have to get a job and j3d1h will goto daycare in order for us to get to Thailand. But, we believe that it will be worth it in the end. It isn’t like we have it bad at all. My parents have given so generous to us that it has afforded us the ability to raise our child in a better fashion than others. I kinda envy my kids (only kinda–I know better than that…who would want ME to be their dad?)…going off to a foreign land, having the best education possible (homeschooling), doing stuff that people only dream of doing, and hell…doing what The Master (henceforth, I will [attempt to] refrain from using the archaic and misunderstood term: “Lord” and just call it what it is: Absolute Master) requires.

This reminds me (/rant on)…our church is insane. How do we get away with not looking at God as Master? These people want (oh. my. gosh. …it is so true) Dogma’s Buddy Jesus. This kind, nice…egalitarian guy who will allow us to justify our actions in a sea of relativism. Yes–we call this Blasphemy. Blatant Blasphemy! Here, let me break God down for you:

1.) Master of the Universe (of all Existence)
2.) ….Did you read 1.)????? What other adjectives and titles do you need to put the proper amount of fear in your mind?

Good grief.

Teacher:Student::Master:???? Take a guess what else exists if a master exists?

Slaves

Isn’t obvious that we are called to be slaves? How do we not get this? Oh, I know…slave sounds too…overpowering and overwhelming. It would be like we don’t have a right to choose our own destiny. There is no gray area. There is no middle ground. You can’t be free and be a slave at the same time. You are all in or all out. Don’t let the relativists fool you. To be a Christian is to be a slave.

We are slaves to the pursuit of that which is most valuable–We are slaves to God. Accept it. The moment you ask for your freedom back is the moment you have overstepped the bounds, you have sinned against God. You are only temporarily given the right to yourself…only so that you can give it back. The only thing I want to hear out of our mouths is: “Here I am, Master”.

(How ironic that “I am” would be used. “Here” makes us small though. Fair enough.)

But, no–Half-breed Christians have chosen to hide the truth. They blaspheme and corrupt. They teach that there is a gray area. They teach that you should pursue happiness and comfort. They teach equality and “human rights”. They teach meaningless secularized ideas that have twisted the remnants of forgotten commandments and fundamental principles of Slavery to God. Self-ownership and free will are illusions to the virtuous Christian. Yes, we have it as a gift and a miracle. But, these are mercy gifts–UNDUE gifts. The recognition of the gift requires that we give such a thing back to God. We are borrowers, caretakers, and stewards of such a gift–but we are not heirs and rightful owners. Half-breeds Christians cannot accept this fact. Their twisted theology is arrogant, self-seeking, and the end to the only correct belief-system which once existed. We are given the gift of Freedom and self-ownership only so that we may recognize that it is undue and USE this gift to give it back to God as a sacrifice. The Imago Dei is the greatest of the spiritual gifts and the second greatest is the forgiveness for our misuse of the former.

God has given us the Image, an undue gift. The gift is extraordinary. It is that which separates us from all other things in the universe. The gift obviously includes the ability to recognize it and the ability to give it back. That is our duty, and it is the greatest thing we can do. As God is the highest pursuit, as the Master TRULY is the most valuable thing to pursue, we receive the duty to volunteer ourselves back into slavery.

I think it is funny that we have been conditioned to use mild, inoffensive, and minimalist language in regards to something that is SO important. Service/Servant. Ha. Slaves and Slavery are the only mindset. All others are false. These people will die as blasphemers.

I amazed by the people who are blind to the true struggle. How could they miss this? If you don’t have something slave-worthy and death-worthy to pursue, then why do you even have a life at all?

The virtuous person will not live a fun or pleasant life. Fun and pleasure are not ‘the good’. While the virtuous person will live ‘the good life’, we must redefine our thoughts as to what ‘the good life’ means.

I tell you what, do an exercise for me. I dare you to write down the top 5 most Virtuous people in history. Seriously, Do it. What about these people are virtuous? Now, look at the lives of these people. Were they happy people? Did they live a fun, comfortable life? Here is the kicker: If you really think that these people are virtuous, then you should be leading lives like these people. If you actually lived virtuously, would your life be pleasurable? Would you pursue pleasure, happiness, or comfort? No. Joy is a very misunderstood concept in the post-modern “church”.

It has taken many years to realize it, but I am a prophet. No, not Elijah. Hell, I’m nothing compared to what is in the Bible. But, I am a truthsayer. I have been given the tools to think and the heart to say the truth. I am meant to say what must be said. I originally laughed at the idea. Who am I to know the truth or tell people it? There isn’t a question about it. Look at the tools God has given me. I could have been a prodigy in any subject, but God has led me to a very specific path. Everything has converged upon this (somewhat daunting and unpleasant) truth: I am designed to learn and teach the Will of God. Of course, I would say that EVERYONE is designed to learn and teach the Will of God in virtue of the Imago Dei. But, I mean it in a stronger sense for myself. This is a vocation and purpose to fulfill. Janitors should learn, follow, and teach the Will of God as well…but they are still Janitors.

Everyday and in everything I do, I see God in the shadows, in the systems, and in the numbers. I see where we are going and why. I am supernaturally gifted for a specific purpose. k0sh3k would say this is a messiah complex (although, she doesn’t think I have one…). Perhaps this isn’t far from the truth. Anyone with a specific purpose should act as a messiah in that specific circumstance–after all, it was the Master who sent YOU to do that specific task. No one else should be living your life and fulfilling your purpose but you (here is where I can agree with “individuality”). Essentially, I see what others do not, and I have long had the intuitive premonition that I am destined to try and use reason and minds to prepare people for becoming Slaves to the Master.

Now that I know my role, I must find my audience (1 or more people) and prepare the message. Perhaps I am called to teach a specific Janitor or maybe a group of Janitors? I am not a very good speaker. But, when the time comes, I will speak well. Although, maybe my audience will be resistant to listening or they might not even listen at all–Food for thought. Manipulation. That is the word of the day. It requires more thought. Also, What medium of communication will be used?

Speaking of Slaves, k0sh3k and I stumbled upon a Bible passage (Exo 21) that we’ve recently seen in a very different light. At first glance, if one interprets literally, there isn’t much to see. It is just a basic law for an old economic/social system. However, after researching it further, and in light of the discussion, the passage becomes so much more relevant.

I’ve pretty much already prefaced this with my respect for the term Slave. With the new concept of our purpose of existence as voluntary slavery, we should have a better look into the meaning and use of slavery found in the Bible. “Servant” is misunderstood. The role of the Slave is a calling for us all. This passage has something to say about a spiritual choice, a choice to become slaves. The interesting part of the Exodus 21 passage is that it is a slave who chooses to stay WITH his master as a matter of choice. This is profoundly parallel to the Chosen’s choice.

I am considering getting an Awl myself. Physical manifestations of your faith are both daily reminders and outward expressions of your slavery. These are good things. Nothing beats getting up in the morning to be reminded: “hey, you are a chosen voluntary slave…now get to work!” And, more importantly, revealing your slavery to the community is essential. You lack identity without others acknowledging what you are and what you’ve chosen.
