In the last two letters you sent me, you called me an asshole (third time is the charm, right? ;P). I can only assume you did not and perhaps still do not like me (I don't know). In any case, I'm pleased to see you embrace philosophy, and to whatever degree I had a hand in causing you to reckon with it (and insofar as you are pleased with it), you are welcome.

One good turn deserves another, right? In our previous letters, I told you about my crisis and despair. The conversation didn't seem to go far. Now, I directly ask you for your help. I ask you to read one piece of my writing for me. Few people speak the languages we do, Brandon. We're philosophers with serious Biblical backgrounds. You appear to have a more continental bent and I an analytic, but there is plenty of crossover. I ask you to wrestle with my words for a bit. I would appreciate your charitable interpretation, as I did for you many years ago.
