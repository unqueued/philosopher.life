* Confirm My Bias

*** No, no, you see, that's not really a free market, capitalism doesn't centralize power, you're thinking of a market distortion which arises from inappropriate regulation.

*** Decentralize. Trust persons you've vetted and come to know by hand, and build worlds with [[intimacy]] at the bottom.

* Disconfirm My Bias

*** Ok. I don't hate them here in this one and only one possibly possible circumstance. Bias confirmation, etc. Those are the arguments I see.

* Think About It

*** I don't have an fMRI test which is consistent for detecting it. We're in second foundation territory, and we can't answer the problem (beyond the standard theoretical questions of the blackbox). How do you build tests for psychopaths without being at least as intelligent as they are, making sure you don't standardize something which can be studied for, etc.? Fucking hard problem, but //The Republic// has been screaming the entire fucking time to you.

*** It speaks to me. I can't deny it. But, I hope I escape this, lawdy. Too ambiguous. Could easily be right, could easily be wrong. You know, like these sentences. Arg!

*** Why is this not something which is made public more clearly as read-only? I'm fine that it takes work to write, to earn that trust, etc. How many fucking conversations have I stumbled upon that mattered which I never had write access to? So many. 
**** I am probably missing a trigger in human nature here.

*** I'm tempted to reach out. I keep running into this muhfucka^^tm^^ <3. Obviously intelligent, interesting, good points, odd, searching. I'm painful to deal with. Not sure how to connect effectively. Gonna sit on it.

*** My god. Not just clickbait. They took a [[beautifully]] strong argument and turned it to rubble. What's the fucking point?

* Interesting
** https://condor.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm
*** Human universals, casuistry, deontology, intuition, common ground, and [[The Golden Rule]] are worried about this list.
** https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FaJaCgqBKphrDzDSj/37-ways-that-words-can-be-wrong
*** What a weird list. I've strong reactions to some, and others I'm not convinced are so problematic.

*** Are you absolutely sure you don't want to do this? It'd be an interesting experience, to say the least.

*** Randomness in [[dok]] is something that merits study. In part, it is the study of meaninglessness. Pay attention, please.

*** I'm not saying their argument is excellent (though, I'm attracted, ofc). There's something right about the kind of person that does this. Ur dad is bad at it. That person is not.

*** That can't be real. Right. RIGHT>? It can't. That's just funny, a joke, and stuff. I'm sure that I'm certain that I know this.
