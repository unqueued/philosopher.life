!! Audit:

* I got every character to hell mode. It's clear that my sorc is still the best runner, but she isn't as powerful or as safe as the necromancer or hammerdin. 
* The kicksin just farms clones. She is by far the best equipped, sporting two serious runewords (for me) and upped gores.
* Sorc is a runerunner at this point, and I don't need major equipment for her. Fast cast + Skill and just enough survivability.
* Javazon does Pindle runs. 
* The Barb and Druid seem like useless cunts to me.
