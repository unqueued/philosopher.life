* [[2020.01.16 - Prompted Introspection: Wish To Dive]]
** Once we get reasonably settled, I'd like to volunteer. Who wants to engage in philosophy and technology? 
* [[2020.01.16 - Wiki Review: So Be It]]
** Edited. Also, I wonder what [[Charlie]] might do for interwebs at home. I think he should ask a neighbor to let him bum. 
* [[2020.01.16 - TDL: Dat Ass]]
** You did a bit more than half. Alright. I'll take it.

** Edited. The question is whether or not it goes the other direction. It may. Perhaps the immutable can be for the sake of the immutable, but I have no idea.
* [[2020.01.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Much-Ballyhooed Rest]]
** Completed.

** Even if he doesn't use it, that's okay. It would be way cool if we got talk more over our machines.
