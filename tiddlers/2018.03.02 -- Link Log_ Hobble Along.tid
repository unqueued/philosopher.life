*** Old people don't feel the pressures of social responsibilities, thus they are less neurotic in conformity, less open to new things, increasingly selfish, and more introverted. Science shows why I hate hate human beings.

*** Special shoutout to conservatives everywhere.

*** And, people like you, with a modicum of sanity and goodwill, are the only reason I'm not plotting to end the lives of an entire generation or two older than I am. It's the reason I have to have the integrity to do it the right way.

*** I'm still not sold on yubikeys. I'm just not sold on its value over software options.

*** It's interesting to see the separation of the grandiose and the vulnerable. I'm not so convinced that we aren't all on this spectrum. It's alpha and beta in the dialectic.

*** Forgive my doubts.

*** The Economist regularly delivers powerful pieces. This is a warcry, a call to arms. I do not think we were trying to inject democracy, although we have tried to assert dominance. What has actually happened is our Neocons and Neolibs have set out to make short-term corporate gains through alliances and exploitation of China, and they have finally grown powerful enough that the long-term negative consequences for the rest of us are finally coming to fruition. I am not convinced at all that those in power in the US believe in democracy. That is obviously false. This piece is disgusting. We helped create that beast, and we are beasts as well. 
*** Suspicious Orientialism here in failing to distinguish the West itself. They mean the US. The Economist points at important things, but they cast spells.

*** It is weird how Atlantis, this movie, and few other just didn't make it. They had some interesting themes too.
