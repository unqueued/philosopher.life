!! About:

I'm lazy as fuck, and I only have so much memory I can dedicate to this tool. There are things I just don't do often enough to keep them memorized. However, when I do need to do them, I don't want to have to search the web. I just want instructions and preferably a template to make it happen fast, captain.
