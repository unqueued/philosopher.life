title: 2006.12.28 -- Connection to Thailand

Finally Mom and Dad got their internet connection! …(there are actually a few things about the U.S. that are so much better than everything else in the world..although, maybe I’m just blind to the corruption in our own government and society.) Anyways, we got to talk to them for the first time in months, which was fantastic. They are doing well. It sounds like they are still adjusting to life in Thailand (and who wouldn’t be?).

k0sh3k made a fantastic potatoe soup (and she stuff potatoe skins too…which totally wtfpwnd). Highly recommend it.

Botting AV did not work last night. Damnit. I ran a macro from my n52 to my keyboard, a mouse macro, and the very bot itself…this was to make my character actually automatically join, enter, leave, and, more importantly, actually do something inside the BG itself. Being able to run around while inside lowers my chances of detection dramatically. But, alas, it didn’t work from what I can tell. I doubt I will try again =)….

By the way, I’ve re-written my Resume. Employment History now goes (zomg):

So sad. Well, time to tweak it and start applying to more jobs. Formatting was never my thing. But, we’ll get it done. I’ve found a few to apply for…although, it annoys me greatly how slow this process of finding another job can go.I just know that driving 2-3 hours a day, on top of mandatory overtime, means I’m away from the house 11-13 hours of the day…all for 30-40k? Couldn’t I make 30-40k in E-town…boom, less travel expenses (including, time traveled, which is an expense when you get down to calculating actual costs), and thus more time for me to be at home.

To me, what is most ironic is that I’m the smartest person in this building (and at least a couple thousand work here), and yet I’ll never do what it takes to rise above these people economically, or in any way climb the ladder…why? Because they sell their souls when they work here. Even for those who haven’t done anything we would consider “explicity” evil…most everyone here just sells their soul. You might not see it, but eh, you are a blind (no offense to the zero people that actually read this paragraph of course). People here still don’t see what is important (not that I have it down perfectly, but I’ve got a pretty freakin’ good idea, or atleast I’m headed in the right direction…unlike the people around me). All I know: I want to make enough to provide for my family, save a little bit, and thats it…the rest of my time is more valuable to me spent at home with my family. People are work-crazy. Why can’t they just understand this job for what it is: a source of income, not a purpose.

And, hell yes I compartmentalize my life. Work stays at work, home at home. This gives me true power of their priority and status. Work is a mere complication in my homelife, not an actual integral part of who I am; it is that which does not interfere with what is important or personal to me. I treat it like a foreign object. Do I want this? No. But, until I get a job that reflects whatever I’m actually supposed to be doing in this world, then no, I’m waiting and prodding that foreign object, begrudgingly fulfilling the oh-so-important duties they think they have me do. In all honesty, I am mentally prepared to drop whatever I’m doing and go where God tells me to (not that He would ever speak to me directly). This is what really seperates me from the herd (not that I really needed any more seperation…I think I’ve spaced it out myself quite nicely so far).

I must admit, everyday I get the feeling I have lived a full life, even if, ironically, I am tormented by the fact that I haven’t fulfilled my purpose (if I have one besides just sitting here thinking about my purpose). It is the case that I have done more so far than most do in a lifetime. I have no room to complain at all; I am blessed (I don’t believe in luck after all). Each day is gravy.

Well, that’s all for this installment of what I’m thinking about in my first half an hour at work!…see you next time for: “Why I love going number 2, and solving all the mysteries of life in 6 seperate 2-minute squeezes.”
