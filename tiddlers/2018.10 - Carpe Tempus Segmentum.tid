!! Audit:

* I have been seizing the day! Noice.
* These do not feel monotonous, unlike my [[TDL]] logs, lol. Good!
* I cannot stop masturbating, as my brother has pointed out.
* My sleep schedule is still not where it should be. The 2am mark seems fairly regular.
** There are nights where I don't remember what time I fell asleep.
* Serious relationship consideration this month.
** Good gracious. Some of them went very well, e.g. [[AA]], and some went very poorly, e.g. [[ALM]].
* I can clearly feel the lack of cannabliss.
** I need to get off this wagon.
* I missed a day, and I didn't know how to put it back together. 
** That's okay.
* I'm annoyed by the renaming. I really want this to say Carpe Diem in the [[titletag]]. Ugh. I'll take what I've got here.
* My wife has been having a lot of migraines. In fact, this month has been terrible for her. I can tell she's depressed. I think a lot of us are feeling it too. SAD?
* I finally saw Blouin. Glad to meet him. I've heard nothing from him, but he has been quite busy with his newborn (understandably).
