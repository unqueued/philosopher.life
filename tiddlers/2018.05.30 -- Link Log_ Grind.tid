*** Reminds me of //The Big Kahuna//
*** This is on the money. This is part of what drives this wiki. May I be ever prudent and wise in my approach.

* Preach, yo!
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/14/is-capitalism-a-threat-to-democracy?
*** It so obviously is...Hello! The desire to enslave others, power itself, must always be regulated, prevented, and decentralized.

* Think About It
** https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/02/be-nice-at-least-until-you-can-coordinate-meanness/

*** Seems to confirm Dasein arising 2s later in many cases. When it is faster, I suppose we have set our non-conscious processes to "be ready for it" or something. That's how reflexes can still be faster than 2s.

* Fishy

*** Ah, I remember why I don't like Bloomberg.

* Interesting
** https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8n3xcy/evidence_for_transgenerational_epigenetic/
*** Some truly evil people in that community, but I love to hear what they are saying. I need to. Some excellent arguments up in there.

*** Keep your ear to the ground.
