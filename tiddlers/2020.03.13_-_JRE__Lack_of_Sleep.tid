How's your day going, homie?
Mar 13 1:17pm
Went to bed at 2 am, baby woke up at 2:05 and he just laid in my arms with eyes wide open until 3:30.  Then I forgot to set my alarm correctly, so I just woke up
Mar 13 1:30pm
I'm sorry about the lack of sleep, but I'm glad you were able to recover.

Iasip is getting better and better.  Weird progression, normally get bored with shows, but feels like the depravity gets even worse in season 5-6
Mar 13 2:03pm
Agreed. Some of the best episodes don't start showing up until the show and characters mature somehow.

S10E01 is one of my favorites.

Nice to put "can I offer you an egg in these trying times" into context, cause I have definitely seen that  online
Mar 13 2:04pm
I have watched Mac's dance many times, but have no context, looking forward to seeing that

From what I could tell, they had made a show without any redeeming moments for their characters for a decade, and just caught everyone off guard by putting in this super out of place, beautiful moment
Mar 13 2:06pm
Kinda like the show had been edging for a decade and finally blew its load
Mar 13 2:07pm
Looking forward to that episode lol
