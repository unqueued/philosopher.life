title: 2013.02.19 - Intentions, Good Will, Action, and Duty

An intention is the aim, plan, or purpose of an action. Intentions demonstrate the “for the sake of which” of an action. While actions can fail or succeed, intentions don’t admit of failure or success in the same way. An intention seems to be an expression of our motivations. Ultimately, an intention is the result of a choice concerning what one will pursue and why, and it is obviously a significant, practical aspect of moral philosophy.

 In standard forms of utilitarianism, intentions are morally irrelevant, as only the results of action have any value. In virtue theories, intentions are morally relevant to some extent, as they are crucial to the psychology of the virtuous agent. I’m going to explore whether and to what extent (if any) intentions are morally relevant in Kant’s ethics. In order to answer this question, we will investigate what Kant has to say about the good will, action, and duty. 

Kant begins the Groundwork by priming our intuitions about the nature of the good will. He says only a good will is good and nothing else is absolutely good without limitation.<<ref "1">> In contrast to the good will, other mental talents, inclinations, and psychological characteristics can be desirable (even encouraging the good will), being contingently and circumstantially good, but they aren’t necessarily and always good because they can be used for evil and by an evil will. Even actions have conditional moral value.<<ref "2">> Only a good will is necessarily, unconditionally, and always good.

A good will is not good because it causes some other end, rather it is an end in itself. Even a will which isn’t efficacious is still good, shining by itself like a jewel.<<ref "3">> This is a key consideration for answering our question concerning the moral relevance of intentions in Kant’s theory. Note that whether or not action bears the sort of fruit we expected, as sometimes it doesn’t, a good will underlying that action remains unblemished and just as morally potent and worthy. In contrast to utilitarianism (a theory which Kant seems to have anticipated), Kant’s theory is far less concerned with consequences of actions, and far more concerned with the will which expresses action.<<ref "4">> In this light, good intentions seem to have similar characteristics to the good will, and thus intentions seem morally relevant in Kant’s theory.

We come to realize that the good will is unconditionally valuable because it is determined by reason and the moral law.<<ref "5">> Obviously, action need not be determined by reason or the moral law. We may act from our inclinations, our instincts, and other sentiments. Actions, unlike the good will, are suspect. To be clear, I am not saying that actions cannot be valuable or have merit. Actions certainly can have moral worth according to Kant’s theory, but only under certain conditions. Our duty, which springs from the moral law, is essential to understanding the relationship between good will and action. 

We must act from, not merely in accordance with, duty.<<ref "6">> An action has moral worth only when it is selected by the moral law and executed out of respect for the moral law. The intentions behind our actions matter. If we intend to do action X for the sake of desire satisfaction or mere happiness, then that action lacks moral worth. In contrast, if we intend to do action X solely for the sake of the moral law, then our action has moral worth. The intentions behind our actions are the essential ingredient to determining the good of the action. Kant provides some famous examples of which elucidate the relationship between duty, intention, and action.

The honest shopkeeper acts in accordance with and in no way contrary to his duty to serve people honestly.<<ref "7">> Yet, he is motivated by self-interest, acting not from duty, but from merely prudential reasons. His action may be right because it conforms with his duty, but it is not good action because it is not done from his duty.<<ref "8">>

The suicidal man who wants to die “yet preserves his life without loving it, not from inclination or fear but from duty” has a maxim with moral content.<<ref "9">>  The man had a duty to preserve his life, and despite his inclinations contrary to his duty, the man acted from duty alone, and thus he performed an action of moral worth. 

Likewise, the sad philanthropist who has no emotion of sympathy for others and yet is beneficent from duty alone is to be praised. His action has “genuine moral worth.”<<ref "10">> To be beneficent from inclination, which is merely in accordance with but not from duty, lacks moral worth. This makes sense, as surely the sad philanthropist cannot be held directly responsible for his emotions, but he can be held responsible for rational choice and acting from duty. 

Pathological love, like other inclinations, cannot be commanded. We cannot be held responsible for inclinations, although we are held responsible for acting from inclinations. Practical love, in contrast to pathological love, can be commanded. Acting from duty can be commanded, and we can be held responsible for this.<<ref "11">> Our intention is morally relevant to action. An action has merit solely in virtue of being performed out of respect for the moral law. 

Kant’s examples, such as that of the sad philanthropist, sit in stark contrast to the virtue ethicist’s assessment. Having the right sort of inclinations and emotions are central to being virtuous, and yet, as Kant points out, it is only the rational choice to act from duty alone which has any moral relevance. Intentions are morally significant, but the sorts of intentions which Kant’s theory demands of us are very different from the sorts demanded by virtue theories. 

Intentions and universal moral law seem to be at the heart of Kant’s theory, in contrast to action and consequences as found at the heart of consequentialist theories or character and inclination as found at the heart of virtue theories. If the purpose, aim, or goal of an act is to follow the moral law, acting from duty, only then is that action a good action. So, while the moral law supplies us with the content of what is right and wrong, our intentions seem to be necessary conditions for achieving anything of moral worth. Intentions are clearly morally relevant in Kant’s theory of ethics. 

Since we’ve briefly sketched out Kant’s position, we should briefly evaluate it. What parts work and what parts don’t; which aspects are strong and which are weak? Do we have lingering questions or considerations which require clarification (issues that Kant may even address elsewhere)?

In the general examination of the moral relevance of intentions, it may be useful to reflect upon our moral intuitions to see if they offer any guidance. For example, intentions seem so potent a concept in Kant’s theory that they seem to overshadow actions almost entirely. Kant lends almost no credence to consequences. Do our intuitions really match that? Surely, we are tempted to think that consequences matter, even if only a little. Shouldn’t we strongly prefer action in accordance with the moral law, even if it isn’t out of respect for the moral law, to action contrary to the moral law? We may even be tempted by our intuitions to agree that acting out of respect for the moral law is morally better than action that merely accords to the moral law, but also claim that the later is still morally better than nothing or morally better than acting contrary to the moral law. It isn’t clear that Kant makes room for this. Moral intuitions may be a problem for Kant’s theory.

Take the example of the evil man who is stranded on an island and yet has every intention of blowing up the world with a doomsday device. He tries to blow the world up, but he fails due to his circumstances. It seems like Kant will call this man evil. Our intuitions agree on this point. We might, however, ask: Isn’t this man better, in some morally significant sense, because he is unsuccessful and his actions fail to blow up the world? Maybe. 

I’m not saying Kant doesn’t have a response to arguments from moral intuitions, but it does seem to be a possible problem for Kant’s theory. Some of us may feel the pull of intuitions which wish for action and consequences to be a counterbalance to intentions. Even the dreaded egoist who just so happens to miraculously act in the accordance with the moral law (however improbable that may be) does seem to be doing good, to be doing something of moral worth, to get at least one thumb up from the objective spectator, even if he doesn’t get both thumbs up. It is here I feel unsatisfied by the role and raw strength of intentions in Kant’s theory, particularly as it overshadows consequential thinking of any sort. 

At the heart of this problem is really a discussion about the natures of and relationship between the Right and the Good, which is sadly way beyond the scope of this paper. I wish Kant were clearer on these fundamental metaethical issues.<<ref "12">>

Perhaps, for example, there is possible distinction between Right action and Good action in Kant’s theory. We might interpret Kant as claiming that right action is merely acting accordance with the moral law, but that good action is right action done from duty alone. This makes sense of the claim that an action with any moral worth, i.e. goodness, is both in accordance with and for the sake of duty. Moral worth is then a value attribution of the good. This strikes me as being somewhat odd, as ‘right’ is very incomplete on this interpretation. Another interpretation seems to be that right action requires being both in accordance with and from duty, and the fact that it is good, hence good action, is a product of it being completely right. 

Further, we might be worried about the goodness of the good will. Admittedly, it seems analytically true that the good will is unconditionally good (what else could it be?). But, to say, for example, that “the good will is unconditional but not complete” raises other questions or concerns. We need a theory of the good. Clearly, I’m only touching upon the tip of an iceberg. 

There are several strengths of the argument as it is formulated. Going back to my intuitions, I find that intentions should be a very significant aspect of any viable moral theory, and I would reject a moral theory that didn’t view intentions as being morally relevant. For example, there is a moral distinction between intentionally stepping on my foot and unintentionally doing so. Yes, both have the same consequences, but why someone performed the action also matters. Intentions seem intuitively crucial in this way. If a person unintentionally stepped on my foot, upon realizing what happened, they might ask for me to pardon them, and I would have to view their action as morally benign. If someone intentionally stepped on my foot and smirked at me, I would have to view their action as being a bit evil. Interestingly enough, someone may step on my foot intentionally for a good reason, and while I might not have realized it at the time, upon reflection, I may be grateful that they intentionally stepped on my foot. Intentions intuitively are a moral matter.

I’m going to conclude with one of the greater and yet sometimes neglected strengths of the argument Kant has given us in this section. This theory concerning intentions makes sense of moral responsibility in ways that alternative theories fail. I alluded to this earlier, and I think it is a fantastic aspect of Kant’s theory. It seems as though many things which virtue theorists and consequentialists wish to hold us responsible for are not the sorts of things for which we can be responsible. For example, we can’t see all of the consequences of our actions, and we can’t control which emotions and inclinations we have. What is “up to us,” however, are our intentions, and because of this, Kant’s emphasis on intentions provides a better perspective on moral responsibility than other theories.
