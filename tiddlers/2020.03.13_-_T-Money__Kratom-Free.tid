Doing well. Been a productive and fun week.
Mar 13 11:44am
We do have enough toilet paper, thankfully.

Been prepping since January, so I've been rebuilding supplies here and there.

How has your week gone? How are your daughter and wife?

That is good! Life has been a whirlwind. Took the week off work (claimed I was sick). Took the new job offer in Somerset with air methods. I am 72hra kratom free which is huge. And we are going to an indoor water park in Gatlinburg to visit family. And apparently it's mostly empty! Lol

That is crazy dude. =)

All fantastic news.
Mar 13 12:17pm
Congratulations. I hope it's a calming force which will bring your family satisfaction.

It will be very odd for awhile. But yes, I see bigger things ahead. And masking my daily emotions and feelings was not a good avenue for learning a new airframe and being in a much more responsible position. Direct flight line duties. On call. That sort of thing. I need a clear head to soak up the new job requirements.
