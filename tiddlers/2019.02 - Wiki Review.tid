!! Audit:

* Guttural. [[Fastmind]]. Explosive. Emotional. This is gutcheck.
* As usual, the [[titletags]] tell the story of the wiki's daily evolution.
* I have been worried about [[JRE]].
** Donors aren't good for anyone.
* Sometimes there are comments that just don't fit into the original because there needs to be an //About:// but there isn't one. This is a way to overlay an //About:// onto everything (a shitty one)...kinda. I suppose [[Wiki Audit]] is more related to {[[Principles]]} in that regard? Hmmm. Not so sure. 
** Something is right here though.
** This seems important. I'm not sure what to do with it. Ack!
*** I commemorate you! `ACK! ACK! ACK!` in my update on [[Wiki Review]]. I dub thee: [[Leet]].
* [[FTO]] has profoundly altered this log. Every week, I am swept by having to do this ticktock evaluation of my relationships.
** It's been healthy though painful.
* Here's what blows me away: [[Sphygmus]] and [[Kevin Kovacs]] respond to me in a place that I assumed nobody read. 
** I sometimes write to [[others]] in this crazy personal space of muttering to myself.
** I am lucky to have people who give a shit! 
** My models have been wrong in the best kind of way.
** Hrm. [[Kevin Kovacs]] has process discipline in his structuring. 
*** In fact, it's better than mine in some respects (which is kind of disgusting considering how fucking hard I've tried to become adept at this).
* Oh, god...I just found the worst lint. `/facepalm`
* I'm arguing heavily in here.
* I'm shotmachinegunning in [[FTO]]. I'm all over the place.
