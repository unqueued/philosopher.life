                                                          Make sure to also cd into your cloned repository after.

git checkout -b 'branchname'	                          Creates a new branch called branchman and switch to the new branch.

                                                          Make sure to also cd into your cloned repository after.

git remote add upstream git@github/username/repo.git	  Add the remote to the cloned repository if it doesn't already exist. 
                                                          Use 'git remote -v' to check if remote exists.

git fetch upstream	                                  Fetches all the upstreams that exist on your repository.

git pull upstream master	                          Pulls and syncs your local project with the master branch.
