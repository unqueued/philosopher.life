title: Unflattening

There are different ways to interpret the initial flatness presented here. It looks political, but it doesn't have to be. I suggest, however, that a material dialectic is more of a pyramid, despite the fact that most people are flattened at the bottom. This could also be The Spectacle. It has an epistemic quality no matter how we cut it. What kind of elitism is this promoting? (I'm not against elitism conceptually, obviously...but only when it is profoundly justified [not easy to do]).

It's a gorgeous claim about "sheeple" from a sociological perspective. This book is about perspective. [[ridtyawtr]] is here too.

This rabbithole runs deep. [[The Dialetheia]] itself, [[The Telos]], is always a problem for the [[fff]]. So far, the focus is entirely on empirical notions (definitely the popular opinion; the positivism virus infects most). 

The author appears to commit to the relativism of OOO. Yikes. (Maybe the author just has no idea what they've said). This book's //unflattening// is the denial of objective truth, the context of all contexts, the perspective of all perspectives. This book is idealist to the point of anti-realism. It talks a good talk about transcendence, but never really commits to ontic transcendence. 

Obviously, I am committed to empathizing with [[The Other]]. If this is just a sociological book, I'm cool. Philosophically, it's fucked. It never unflattens anything. Ah, it goes The Continental route, where we act like we have [[The Foundation]] and deny it at the same time from a constructivist, coherentist, internalism.

So far, this is a gorgeous investigation! My children and I talk about these issues a great deal. They'll be reading this book today as well.

Standard butterfly chaos argument. Cool.

Hm, we might worry the author argues for the strong Whorfian-Sapir thesis. That's probably unacceptable. The Wittgensteinian language game and Continental approaches, however, are more interesting. 

"mistaking their boundaries for reality" - PREACH, YO! Of course, Saint GÃ¶del, the Mathematical Realist, takes us to the limit, posits the unlimited beyond the limit, and we [[fff]] language users are forever fucked. This is where mysticism steps into play. [[The Infinite]] which is external to us is something we can only ever point to. We can never fully name it by definition ([[Alias]]). REALISTS UNITE! DO YOU SEE YOUR ENEMY IN THE DIALECTIC?

"the medium we think in defines what we can see" - which is why we can only limbically feel the transcendent and never explicitly state it.

Obviously, you know where I stand on the images and words debate. Even when images talk to you, they only do so because you had the words to get you there in the first place.

It appears to make the Kantian Epistemology Copernican Revolution point.

I think this is a strong discussion of postmodernism. I celebrate what it gets right.

I legitimately get the rhizome. This wiki is an incredible example of it. I see the structures and fully admit my blindness. I attend to it.

Unfortunately, it denies the very existence of objective truth. The game is over. That very claim is something they need to be objectively true. I completely appreciate the problem of evolving our ability to take on new perspectives, to be humble in claiming we have even come close to generate a semblance of the thing-in-itself. You have already lost the war if you deny the existence of truth. The insanity continues. This is the post-modernism that justifies selfishness, hilariously. They claim it is what enables them to see the [[other]], but it is exactly what enables the moral relativism necessary to conveniently dismiss the truth of the [[other]] at will.

I would adore this book if it didn't devolve into internalism. Internalists do not have an external right to the external without first admitting the external, even in faith. Fucking hypocrites. This is all the rage. I get it. As I have said, Kant has enchanted the vortex. Yet, I cannot deny much of this argument is spot fucking on. It simply oversteps into oblivion of meaninglessness. You have not beheld true mysticism until you have seen the blinding light OUTSIDE you as something which non of us have constructed.

I cherish and praise the call for empathy in this book. Empathizing with my perspective, and you will see the other side, internalists. We are powerless without each other. Sublation will be external to us.

I adore the alien perception here.

The pragmatism could be an attempt toward the infinigress of The Foundation for externalism. They finally hand me some material to work with.

I cannot deny the language claim. We do breathe and swim in it. They are not traps built correctly: they only show us the infinigress of the semantics we cannot prove in our current language.

I appreciate the discussion of the pragmatism of language. What do infinite languages and infinite computation look like? What does that mean for us? How do we relate to [[The Infinite]]? How real can we get? How do we improve this correlation?
