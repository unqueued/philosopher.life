About a minute in, it shows what looks like static background.  I get how you could do that with film, by strobing and syncing with framerate, but how is that even possible to  make it so the background doesn't appear to move behind the sledder
Feb 11 6:34pm
mind blown shit-- assuming his claim in the comments that no post production was used.
Feb 11 6:34pm
My god
Feb 11 7:52pm
That is the most leet linerider vid I've ever seen
Feb 11 7:52pm
How was your day?
Feb 11 8:43pm
good
Feb 11 8:43pm
worked out, jerked off, slept in, picked up, washed up
Feb 11 8:44pm
today's lesson is prepositions
Feb 11 8:44pm
lol
Feb 11 8:44pm
feel a little guilty for not working lol
Feb 11 8:44pm
rebecca turned off the fan this morning so i could wake up when matthew did while she was in the shower
Feb 11 8:45pm
didn't hear him crying
Feb 11 8:45pm
so she still had to clean him up and get him ready this morning lol
Feb 11 8:45pm
i think i understand why baby monitors exist now-- i thought it was just for rich peeps with big houses, but really, just for dad's with bad hearing
Feb 11 8:46pm
[[1uxb0x]]'s bike is on the way, but will get there between the 14th and 18th
Feb 11 8:46pm
I'm pretty sure mom's have better hearing and dad's worse.
Feb 11 8:46pm
Noice. He's gonna love it.
Feb 11 8:46pm
Have a spot in the garage for it.
Feb 11 8:47pm
i was playing a game on monday while he was here with me, and suddenly i turned around
Feb 11 8:47pm
and he was trying to stand up while full on crying up trying to get my attention
Feb 11 8:47pm
lol, this kid cries for attention with rebecca, but never actually gets to the tears before she gets there
Feb 11 8:47pm
she tried to feed him some baby yogurt today, i could not watch
Feb 11 8:48pm
fuuuuuck
Feb 11 8:48pm
lol
Feb 11 8:48pm
I forgot. Yeah. That's gonna be hard to do.
Feb 11 8:48pm
spoon feeding what looks like jizz is a no go for me
Feb 11 8:48pm
Eat it, baby.
Feb 11 8:48pm
applesauce, cool, pumpkin shit... fine
Feb 11 8:48pm
eat your brothers and sisters baby! EAT IT!
Feb 11 8:49pm
lol
Feb 11 8:49pm
=)
Feb 11 8:49pm
What foods does he like the most?
Feb 11 8:49pm
your daughter said she hasn't watched peep show, surprised me
Feb 11 8:49pm
anything with bananas
Feb 11 8:49pm
we haven't gotten there yet. She's going to lose her mind when we do.
Feb 11 8:49pm
reb had a banana while i was holding him, and she kept smooshing little bits between her finger and feeding to him.  was gross as fuck
Feb 11 8:50pm
i have never seen a full episode honestly, just tons of clips
Feb 11 8:50pm
anxiety producing lol
Feb 11 8:50pm
Aye. Have to stop the show all the time to walk away.
Feb 11 8:50pm
"as soon as you told me I'll just have to pee myself,  I started pissing myself!
Feb 11 8:51pm
I'm interested to see how my son reacts. He has the strongest "nope right out of there's" of any of us.
Feb 11 8:51pm
we have been watching the outsider, lots of stephen king stuff goin on at the moment
Feb 11 8:51pm
it's pretty well done, starting to lose the mystery and just slide into suspense
Feb 11 8:52pm
once you know what the monster is and is capable of, it's all about how will they surviveit
Feb 11 8:52pm
i enjoyed the time where they were all saying "what in the fuck" a bit more
Feb 11 8:52pm
also, we watched the second season of castlerock, another stephen king show
Feb 11 8:52pm
first season had that great episode from the perspective of the woman with Alzheimer's
Feb 11 8:53pm
Aye.
Feb 11 8:53pm
the second season has the woman from misery in it, in the same town as the first season
Feb 11 8:53pm
She did a good job in Misery.
Feb 11 8:54pm
weird ending-- just so of goes "okay, main plot is done... NOW!  Let's focus the rest of the show on this one character's epilogue, and not even show what happens to the rest"
Feb 11 8:54pm
oh, i mean the character, not the actor
Feb 11 8:55pm
its like two worlds colliding from his stories
Feb 11 8:55pm
gives interesting background on her char
Feb 11 8:55pm
Oh, that must be a weird transition.
Feb 11 8:55pm
yeah, lizzie caplan plays her
Feb 11 8:55pm
least hot she has ever been, but does a great job being creepy as fuck
Feb 11 8:55pm
Much more fuckable than Bates
Feb 11 8:56pm
lol
Feb 11 8:56pm
yep
Feb 11 8:56pm
The ending of the show isn't great, but the epilogue was pretty fucking awesome in my book
Feb 11 8:57pm
cause the epilogue just shows what happens to her and ignores everyone else
Feb 11 8:57pm
Should maybe watch with [[K]] too. You all love scary stories.
Feb 11 8:57pm
yeah, i enjoy a good horror film
Feb 11 8:58pm
like... shit what was that show... haunting of hill house?
Feb 11 8:58pm
definitely a great show
Feb 11 8:58pm
googling
Feb 11 8:58pm
so many good mind fucks
Feb 11 8:58pm
Never seen that one.
Feb 11 8:58pm
i liked the first season of castlerock, and recommended it to you, think you watched a little but didn't finish
Feb 11 8:59pm
i get that
Feb 11 8:59pm
haunting of hill house is a much stronger show
Feb 11 8:59pm
I got through at least 7 episodes, I don't remember a ton about the show anymore.
Feb 11 8:59pm
what makes it more fun for me is I'm constantly scanning the whole screen when i watch shit, not just listening or watching peeps faces
Feb 11 9:00pm
and haunting of hill house requires you to really watch to get some of the scares
Feb 11 9:00pm
some of the shit is just subtle changes in the background, where they won't even draw your attention to it otherwise
Feb 11 9:00pm
like the woman is walking through her house in a storm, walks with the camera down a hall with statues of people, and then turns around and walks back the way she came, and if you are paying attention you realize that all the statues are now different and watching her-- not cgi, just well done set design
Feb 11 9:02pm
and that shit is ALL throughout the show
Feb 11 9:02pm
you never did see hereditary did you?
Feb 11 9:02pm
Nope, lol.
Feb 11 9:03pm
thats a good movie too -- dude named ari astor made it
Feb 11 9:03pm
suuuuuper fucked up
Feb 11 9:03pm
some peeps didn't like the movie cause it doesn't end how they wanted, but the ending almost gave me nightmares
Feb 11 9:04pm
which is rare
Feb 11 9:04pm
something about watching someone use a piano wire to saw their own head off that just unsettles me lol
Feb 11 9:04pm
lol
Feb 11 9:05pm
Looking through my TV and Film libraries, and I have scarcely any horror. I do not get it.
Feb 11 9:06pm
you don't get it?  meaning you THINK you should like horror more than you do, but just don't find yourself cataloging it?
Feb 11 9:06pm
It doesn't click with me.
Feb 11 9:07pm
I'm like, horror illiterate
Feb 11 9:07pm
Sharp Objects and True Detective are probably my favorite horror shows, from what I can see.
Feb 11 9:09pm
(though, I'm not sure most would consider True Detective to be horror?)
Feb 11 9:09pm
Alien, The Thing, Hereditary, The Babadook (with reservations-- but it has its own beauty), Ringu, Saw, It
Feb 11 9:11pm
Sharp objects and true detective probably go with things like silence of the lambs and saw, definitely a subgenre of horror
Feb 11 9:12pm
they do horrify
Feb 11 9:12pm
Shyamalan is also good.
Feb 11 9:12pm
I take it back, there are plenty of horror-esque films in my library.
Feb 11 9:13pm
Pan's Labryinth?
Feb 11 9:16pm
Yes, that one is excellent.
Feb 11 9:16pm
Labyrinth
Feb 11 9:16pm
And, it also has magic. I don't think I tend to care for magic.
Feb 11 9:16pm
One Hour Photo struck me
Feb 11 9:17pm
Se7en
Feb 11 9:17pm
Se7en for sure...
Feb 11 9:17pm
Let the Right one In
Feb 11 9:17pm
Googling
Feb 11 9:18pm
Part of the issue may be that I have a very narrow window in which I explore new film/shows.
Feb 11 9:19pm
Same for books.
Feb 11 9:20pm
Donnie Darko is kinda horror...
Feb 11 9:20pm
I'm increasingly focused on non-fiction (or what purports to be) on the web.
Feb 11 9:20pm
Yeah, it's horror.
Feb 11 9:20pm
Fiction in general has just been withering for me.
Feb 11 9:21pm
Set in my ways, trying to get the kids off my lawn? Maybe it's hermit behavior.
Feb 11 9:22pm
Foolish brother asking dumb questions: you got two weeks of non-perishable food in the house?
Feb 11 9:26pm
yeah, but not much more
Feb 11 9:26pm
got yourself a feeling? corona?
Feb 11 9:26pm
I almost bought masks and gloves, lol. But, I'm like, nawww...
Feb 11 9:27pm
Food won't go to waste though.
Feb 11 9:27pm
Fun to watch people bet on events: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3529/how-many-human-infections-of-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-will-be-estimated-to-have-occurred-before-2021-question-two/
Feb 11 9:38pm
Not money, but rep or points of a kind, on this one, I believe.
Feb 11 9:38pm
I am convinced that China is not being honest about the numbers, despite taking it seriously (economic damage is severe).
Feb 11 9:42pm
yeah, they take it seriously, quarantine people on the street and drag people out of their homes, but then they have to give some numbers to justify their actions, but doesn't mean they are giving the real numbers
Feb 11 9:43pm
over 1,000 dead so far
Feb 11 9:43pm
I think it is much higher than that.
Feb 11 9:43pm
Military and Party members of China are receiving better treatment though, and they are more likely to survive. The poor are getting wrecked, shipped out of hospitals never to be seen again.
Feb 11 9:44pm
Crazy conspiracy theorist brother* take it with a grain of salt
Feb 11 9:45pm
gonna be even more awful when it hits the uyghur concentration camps
Feb 11 9:45pm
yeah, you see that video of the politicians confiscating the boxes of masks at the hospital for party members?
Feb 11 9:46pm
gross shit
Feb 11 9:46pm
yuck
Feb 11 9:46pm
there is very little I wouldn't put past the Chinese government-- evil, self-propelled bureaucratic nightmare machine
Feb 11 9:47pm
not that ours isn't churning out a steady stream of nightmares on their own...
Feb 11 9:48pm
Noif is otw, btw.
Feb 11 9:51pm
lol, took a second to decode--- looking forward to it :)

Feb 13 5:25pm
Thought it was gonna be about foster care at first lol
Feb 13 8:49pm
That makes sense, lol.
Feb 13 8:50pm
I assume that word leaps out for you.
Feb 13 8:50pm
It's cool to see how deliberately you do these steps in your relationships, especially the thing in the pay close attention to each other section
Feb 13 8:51pm
=)
