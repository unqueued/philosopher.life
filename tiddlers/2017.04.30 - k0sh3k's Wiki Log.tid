* You didn't write on the 24th and 25th
* [[Thank you!|http://bookwyrm.life/#Monday%2C%2024th%20April%202017]], we can't afford deer food, sadly. It interestingly feels like you are writing to me directly, my dear.
* I love how you are being a good example to the kids in showing off your open education learning. Recording it shows how much it matters to you, and in time, they will see how much it should matter to them as well.
* Use more exclamation points!!!
* Your Legal page needs aesthetic touchups. Make it pretty. Make it all caps. There are legal conventions for going all caps.
* Add a "New" tab. Ask [[j3d1h]] how to do it (I don't remember how it worked).
* Write more! =)
