Trying to get my head above water these past few days. Hopefully, I'll be functioning here in a week or so.

# Thank you for the .svg's. 
#* Insofar as I commit more and more to TW rather than hardcoded plaintext, this may be the way to go in the end. 
#* Some of the TW gurus thought it might be a source of lag on my wiki. 
#** I'm not convinced I'll be able to get anything that really functions well on mobile. It only seems to get worse and worse each year for me.
#* I'm still having trouble getting the .svgs as you have them to render correctly. Linux FF is fine, Linux Chromium is not. Windows FF/Chrome didn't work (it became kind of garbled on that machine). 

# We'll see on whether or not they get to attend Yale. It's still just a {[[dream]]} for now.
#* Found out today that none of the other librarian's offspring have attended Yale. Getting in will be the hard part. 
#* Oddly enough, depending on how things go in the world, I am open to being divorced on paper if it is necessary (though the thought makes us sad). Whatever makes the lives of our offspring better here is what we have to do. 
#* I think the least happy thought is that they might not go (for whatever reason) to college. I don't know what the next decade has in store here. `/fingers-crossed`

> Interestingly, as long as I don't make much money, my offspring's cost to go to Yale would be $6k/year they say. Costs will skyrocket if I make what I'm worth.

Funny how that works, isn't it?^^/s^^ My financial aid with uChicago was to the same degree (so the local scholarship I received didn't //actually// do much other than save the university money XP). My dad doubled his income and my parents divorced before my senior year, so she claimed me as primary guardian on the paperwork since she was making much less and we managed to roughly keep the same level of aid. I don't recommend divorcing as a way around the thing, though. ;P 

Yale's admission rates are absolutely ''bonkers'', of course. I'm sure my ACT score and essay yadda yadda //helped// me get in, but I'm also sure I was given an edge filling the university's "diversity quota" if you will, being from such a rural area at the time.

I hope the potential opportunities of your new home blossom for you and your children! :)

Apologies, I'm behind on responding!

I figured out a way to make your ASCII responsive!! It will even look great on mobile :D (squeeze your screen way skinny to see the hawt resizing)

I've gotten them all converted and will zip and send them to you shortly. :)

Wikis are ripe for [[titlepuns|https://sphygm.us/#191226%20%E2%80%93%20Carpe%20Diem%3A%20Gorgeous%20Boxing%20Day]]. Sometimes, it feels like there's so much freedom to just throw darts at the board while naming.

Haha. I bet your arms were ripped.<<footnote "ctl" "Tamely, I'm crossing a terrible line, [[Sphygmus]], but I'm as immature as they come: that is not how I developed my forearms as a teenager, lol. My right arm was always way, way stronger. (See, now you are family because that is at least half of my humor; I consider it a good day when someone in the room will groan, shake their head, or throw something at me).">> T-shirts are good for putting on a gun show too. That sounds like a cool job too. How'd you end up picking that one up? Did you get to make any shirts for yourself? 

I miss some of my earlier jobs (though I'm not sure I should trust my memory here; it could be nostalgia). McDonalds, regardless of what I think of the company, was an important experience for me. There is something satisfying about optimizing physical tasks and thinking about such a precisely tuned machine of a business in action. I enjoyed the rush hours and closing the most.

> A week of intense physical labor at a real job would be a valuable wake-up call for them...

My first job<<footnote "*" "technically; volunteering at the local library doesn't count.">> as a teenager was working as an assistant at the local screen printing shop. At first I did all the pretty junky tasks: weeding cut vinyl,<<footnote "**" "actually pretty satisfying">> grabbing shirts needed for jobs from our store room,<<footnote "***" "that was a pretty cool place -- an attic with rows of colorful t-shirts on shelves">> pulling out interfacing from embroidered hats,<<footnote "s" "very similar to weeding vinyl">>, and worst of all, cleaning out all the used screens. Aside from the suspect proposition of using a power washer and chemicals to strip plastic from the screens in a basement, I quite enjoyed it. Eventually they taught me to do the actual screen printing on t-shirts, and those were the best days -- I blame any amount of forearm muscle currently in my possession on that job!

Ah, yes, [[it|https://sphygm.us/#191103%20%E2%80%93%20Log%3A%20A%20Very%20Narrow%20Bridge]] was not explicitly written to you -- at the time, it was me, talking to myself, and generalizing/sub-texting to maintain a sense of privacy and/or protection for those in my life offline.

After re-reading it a lot today, I think I understand how it screams out to you.<<footnote "hm" "I probably see less lines of reasoning in it than you suggest I do. ;P">> Ultimately I think it matters less //when// or //why// that I wrote this, but more that I //did//.

Absolutely, and I'm excited to see it grow, shift, evolve, and change in the process!

Thank you!! I had a lot of fun creating it. :) And it's awesome that your RSS tool is now #hawt! Btw, your title.Tags recently have been ''spectacular''.


; 2019.10.19 - @Sphygmus

Daaaaaaamn, that is a dope splash/loading screen! Also, the ghetto RSS tool I use to track changes shows that as the background now! Lol.

You absolutely have the right to ask me. If it's not your place, I don't know whose it would be. I have no intention of causing you grief here either. This place hurts. I am also [[not done|2019.04.13 - SLT: TOU2]] grieving or worse, and I aim to be useful to you.

; 2019.10.15 - [[@h0p3|https://sphygm.us/#%40h0p3]]

> Aren't you the least bit curious how my wife and I get along on this one?

I am, tbh, given how this type of friction contributed to (what felt like at the time) the dissolution of my family. I still don't walk past that wall with my father; my wounds are still too fresh for me to even consider having a genuine conversation about his views or relationship to faith & belief these days. I would only see my personal grief. I don't know the right words to ask you, though, and I don't feel it's my place to ask at this moment, so I'm content to pick up clues in reading and see if it comes out in further letters to DeathOfRobinhood.

; 2019.10.06 - @Sphygmus

Wow! You are dropping bombs this evening! I'm stunned.

; 2019.07.23 - [[@ h0p3|https://sphygm.us/#h0p3]]

It's been a while! I see I've got two links to check out in your link logs. Everything was all turned around when I visited your site - the nested sidebar tabs are pretty cool, and whoa, firmcoding has been fleshed out a lot! I can't believe it's almost been a year since I found kicks and you and wrote my first letter. 

It is hard coming back to my wiki; it doesn't feel like a second skin any more, but more like a skin that's been shed. I'm uneasy at the thought of reading some of my own words in the same way that I hate reading papers I've written after they've been written, even after they've been submitted and feedback returned.

> I feel your fear (even from your first letter), and imho, it's not just with me.

I haven't done words in a while. In this moment they feel trite and performative and I'm second guessing them, this sentence as I write it now. I'm afraid this started as a note to you and turned into something all about me and how I'm feeling, when I wanted to convey that I care about you and how things are going - when of course I've checked your wiki and gotten a rough picture of the past few months for you.<<footnote "tv" "and nodded my head in great appreciation of our shared enjoyment of //Russian Dolls//, and something else I can't remember now.">>

You might find [[publish.sh]] to be useful to your private->public conversion. Anything tagged //Public// survives to be compiled, and everything else is removed. [[html-to-tid.sh]] and [[tid-to-html.sh]] also help (this can be made cleaner, but it works). Also, cool to see an update to your site today! 

; 2019.06.27 - @Sphygmus

I haven't seen you in while. I hope you are doing well. =)
