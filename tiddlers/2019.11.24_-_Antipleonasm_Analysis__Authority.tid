title: 2019.11.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Authority

!! Respond to the following gem:

; Auctoritas non veritas facit legem
:    Authority, not truth, makes law.
<<<

By [[W5H]] is this a law which ought govern how we understand and interact with the world? There appear to be laws which are themselves just the truth, but perhaps "makes" makes no sense in those cases. I just don't know how to speak of computation outside of time; it's an absurd analogy. Further, the truth seems authoritative in some contexts. 

We might think the Criterion of Authority is itself a law (some legal scholars do), but surely this maps onto the sovereignty of some set of agents in many cases. I hear echoes of legal positivism in here and admire that it calls for us to question both explanation and justification of political [[power]].
