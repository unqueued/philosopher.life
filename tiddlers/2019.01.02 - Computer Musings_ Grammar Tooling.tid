title: 2019.01.02 - Computer Musings: Grammar Tooling

My son still doesn't have any grammar tooling for his wiki (he hadn't even set up all his accounts or bookmarked his own wiki). It's been months trying to get him there. He doesn't care enough to continue to play and test until something works. Applying pressure from any angle I can find isn't working. I'm at a loss. I do not wish to feed his learned helplessness here.

The tools are funky on his machine, and it's not just his machine. [[j3d1h]] and I noticed that TW doesn't play nice with these tools across the browsers. Blank and kids have trouble, even on my machine. My bet is on [[Sphygmus]] flexbox tool because my wiki and hers work just fine. We'll get there.
