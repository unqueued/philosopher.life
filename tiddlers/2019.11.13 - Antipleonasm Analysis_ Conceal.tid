title: 2019.11.13 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Conceal

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
; Abbati, medico, patrono que intima pande.
: Conceal not the truth from thy physician and lawyer.

It depends on the ends you have in mind. If prudence is the only goal, then generally this is good advice for the average person. We'll have a tendency to hide humiliating or damning evidence from people, including our advisors. You don't withhold information from your mentat.

If there is more to life than prudence (hint: there is), then the claim does not hold water. Does your lawyer exist to spin fictions with and for you around the truth you offer? Sometimes you ought, and sometimes you ought not. Why should you think your physician or their computer systems are trustworthy? You are a customer, not a person to many of them.
