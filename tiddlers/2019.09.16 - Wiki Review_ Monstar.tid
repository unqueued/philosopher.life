title: 2019.09.16 - Wiki Review: Monstar

* [[2019.08.23 - T-Money: Hiding My Alcohol]]
** That can't be easy for him to reason about.
* [[2019.08.24 - T-Money: Gone Fishin']]
** I hope he gets some good use out of it. It may be more than a toy, and I hope it's a chance to bond with his daughter.
* [[2019.08.30 - T-Money: Gunrange Date]]
** One day, I hope to go on the shooting range with him. He will appalled at how out of practice and overly cautious I am. In the end, I hate that I will likely need to wield such things as the crisis looms.
* [[2019.09.01 - T-Money: Tractor]]
** I grew up with the phrase "bush hog," but only today did I learn its etymology. Very common to see generic trademarks in the South; it's how we roll.
* [[2019.09.08 - T-Money: Hectic]]
** I have no idea how he manages to get it all done. He's busy AF.
* [[2019.09.15 - T-Money: Ice Shards]]
** You know, he's been getting sick a lot. He and his wife are having trouble. I'm glad to hear his daughter seems perfectly healthy.
* [[2019.09.12 - AA: Discombobulated]]
** Was this your sign? How did you miss this? Was she showing it the entire time? How much of this was up to you, autist?
* [[2019.09.20 - AA: Cabin Reservation]]
** I am worried we will not be able to attend if we move to CT. We're going to do our damnedest. I do not like the thought of failing her in this respect.
* [[2019.09.26 - AA: Working]]
** It sounds so insanely busy for them.
* [[2019.08.30 - AA: Good]]
** You know, I'm not sure she's really enjoying school. Online classes are different, and this program might not really be what she wants. 
*** Oh, that reminds me of one of my math teachers at the community college (discrete math) she wants to teach at who seems to have so much in common with her. Hrm.
* [[2019.09.01 - AA: Giving Birf]]
** I am as useless and arrogant as ever. =)
* [[2019.09.05 - AA: Yup, Good]]
** There were plenty of warning signs. I am not paying close enough attention or reasoning effectively enough.
* [[2019.09.12 - AA: No, She's Not Feeling Alright]]
** I need to continue to try to connect. She's probably already in the pit.
* [[2019.08.09 - L: Rut]]
** I don't know if she is actually climbing out, but there is progress here I've not seen in a long time.
* [[2019.08.25 - L: Installing Lenux]]
** She has a lot on her plate. I hope she runs with it. I don't like that she feels trapped. It's my honor to be useful to her.
* [[2019.08.26 - L: Checkin]]
** I need to offer again. I'm not sure if she needs any more help or not, and I think she's diving back into difficulty. Maybe it's not the correct time to offer.
* [[2019.08.30 - L: Ura Windows Superkey]]
** I'm glad she feels comfortable joking with me. That is important for us. 
* [[2019.09.01 - L: Bless The Man]]
** I like how she is picking up things as she needs them in the order she needs the most. I think I tend to be awful at this.
* [[2019.09.02 - L: Up & Running]]
** She gets distracted by vidya as much as everyone else in my family.
* [[2019.09.03 - L: To The Cause]]
** I'm glad to see she's begun again. I think this will be immensely useful to her, but, of course, I would.
* [[2019.09.07 - L: Annoying Issue]]
** She is so much wiser than I was in this respect. My goodness. Rock on.
* [[2019.09.08 - L: One Place]]
** I hope it is a place of wrestling, honesty, and serenity for her.
* [[2019.09.12 - L: So Hot]]
** Wonder if she knew our AC was having trouble.
* [[2019.08.26 - K: MFA]]
** That's some solid honesty there. Ain't easy. I appreciate his humility.
* [[2019.08.29 - K: Raid & Session]]
** We've both had messages just sitting in queue, lol.
* [[2019.09.01 - K: Hella Good]]
** A useful tool for an English major.
* [[2019.09.05 - K: Chase]]
** Heartbreaking. I don't even know what to do with it. As he reflects further, it's probably going to get worse for him as well.
* [[2019.09.15 - K: Blanked]]
** He's getting his work done. Just grinding out.
* [[2019.09.09 - K: Translations]]
** He's finding his classes, lit classes, to be a snooze, minus creative writing. That's weird, right?
* [[2019.09.10 - K: Sun Ra]]
** Maybe his professor was speaking in some coy manner?
* [[2019.09.03 - Tasha: Thinking Of]]
** Why don't they say 'hi'? I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here either.
* [[2019.09.09 - Tasha: Jobbos]]
** Feels like we're just barely touching base.
* [[2019.08.13 - JRE: Stolen Tools]]
** I'm glad they are trying to make him whole again.
* [[2019.08.16 - JRE: Healing]]
** Hey, if I can heal a noob through that, I can heal.
* [[2019.08.20 - JRE: Love Yah]]
** That's not where I ended up going. I still might construct the build, but rain of fire seems good enough.
* [[2019.08.28 - JRE: Labor of Love]]
** That is some high praise. I hope to live up to it.
* [[2019.08.31 - JRE: Random Enchants]]
** I guess some people just collect REs for a while and unload.
* [[2019.09.01 - JRE: WoWtalk]]
** I have no idea why the server can show up with several minutes difference like this. Betting on my ISP.
* [[2019.09.04 - JRE: Plox]]
** I wonder what I will make of this spillover into our usual discussion. Part of me thinks the blather will be annoying, but I think I might also treasure it.
*** Let me know how it goes, future-[[h0p3]]! Here's a warm, juicy, tight little hole for you to put dat pre-registered retroactive [[footnote|Footnotes]]:

* [[2019.09.15 - TDL: GL]]
** Doubt I'll get to the melee spec. I'm just not feeling it (yet?). Lots of fish to fry I find more important.
