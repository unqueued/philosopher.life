title: Why I'm Not a Professional Philosopher

I'm not a professional because I don't make a living by thinking, reading, and writing about what the academic world considers academic philosophy. I don't publish in peer-reviewed journals or write books with that audience in mind. 

Don't get me wrong, I am capable of thinking at that level. I regularly do. I've got the training but not the rubber-stamp seal of approval.<<ref "1">> That isn't to say I don't respect academic philosophy or the degree. I do. I am still proud of the high praise I have received from my professors. Their opinions mean a lot to me. I am profoundly affected by what I have learned. Academic education has transformed me. 

Unfortunately. there is something missing in academic philosophy. It is a popularity contest corrupted by capitalism which has left behind and suppressed the pursuit of //systematic philosophy//.<<ref "2">> Academic philosophy is still spinning its wheels in post-modern deconstructionism, and that's probably because there is no foundation we can all rationally accept (I don't know if this dooms the CI or not, but I think there is a way out). The goal of being an academic might be to find a very tiny spot to leave your mark or to push the bleeding-edge of the public sphere of knowledge. Who wouldn't like to be famous for what they think? But, that isn't ultimately what I'm after. When I'd talk to my peers and teachers over the years about this issue, they would give me a puzzled look. Understandably, I suppose, since I'm not buying what they do.

Philosophy is deeply practical to me. It is a framework or lens through which I interpret the world. I'm here to be philosophical about my life. I'm doing philosophy for myself, not for others.<<ref "3">> That isn't to say what I'm doing shouldn't be or isn't useful to others, but it does mean that my work doesn't fit nicely into the topics du jour then "I'm out."<<ref "4">> Some people are lucky enough to have opinions that are popular, that coincide with the intuitions of others so effectively that they are readily accepted into the fold. I am a misfit with terrible social skills. That's okay though. I'm still a philosopher.

<<footnotes "2" "I'm not the only ex-academic philosopher who thought this. That doesn't mean we are correct. And, of course, market-based academics does generate valuable work in many ways. Markets are as imperfect as the people in them though.">>

<<footnotes "3" "That sounds really selfish. I think my philosophical views obviously have impact on the people around me. What I believe affects what I practice and how I behave. This is a doxa->praxis.">>
