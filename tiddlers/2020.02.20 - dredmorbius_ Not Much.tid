"""
I do better with specific questions or suggestions, generally.

Not sure if I'm mostly busy or mostly distracted, but one, the other, or both.

I don't have as organised an online presence as I'd like, though I'm fairly reachable on Diaspora and Mastodon:

https://mastodon.cloud/@dredmorbius
https://joindiaspora.com/u/dredmorbius

I'm not getting much out of the link you shared, sorry.
