*** Lol. No shit. I mean, once you posit metaphysics, you buy yourself whatever the fuck you want (which is why you should buy almost nothing if you can).

*** Saner than usual. Those who aim to deconstruct the self, deny the subject are surely going to experience derealization and depersonalization, right? What do you expect to occur? Lol. I've been seeing more of this lately.

*** This also keep showing up more and more. Will that get redirected and channeled into increasingly militant [[pright]] movements? I'm not voting DNC.

*** Completely fucked up. And, yes, forcefeeding is torture.

*** I don't want to call it science with a physicist. With a philosopher who appreciates the nature of empiricism, it's obvious that it is a science (even if the p-values don't look so hot, like any of the humanities), but political science and economics are dismal. But, to go this far in defining science already dismisses the underlying worries. Obviously, I don't think Marx can describe reality because I'm not  a physicalist. 
*** To call it Eurocentric is to strawman it. You're out of your mind if you read Saint Marx as inerrant, and that's true for Saint Aristotle too.
*** It is only revolutionary science if you can talk about the incapacity to revolt in that field. If so, fine.

*** If logic isn't universal (and I'm willing to accept a [[Dialetheia]]), please tell me what is.
*** That sounds right to me, as I have suggested in [[Alias]]. I see a lot of people who think Daoism is actually the other dialectical component, like it's the opposite. That isn't what I see. To suggest Daoism has no metaphysics is also absurd. It's fucking screaming out of the open, and then it devolves into a realpolitik [[redpill]]ed contrarian dogwhistle based on moral relativity.

*** Can't we just say the standard of knowledge is contextual? Give up on certainty and inerrancy, and that word becomes useful again. I'm more interested in the justification of JTB than anything else.

*** Sounds like good privacy to me, rofl. When you go open source, allow me to control the device out of the gate, and don't aggressively force me into your ecosystem, I'd consider it. That's gonna happen...
