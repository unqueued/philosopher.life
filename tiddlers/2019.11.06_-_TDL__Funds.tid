* CC & Retirement. 
* Placement agency contact? Don't know when.
* Get the letters printed off.
** Still haven't seen MadameM
* [[JRE]] and [[K]] are anxious. Listen and reason. Unfortunately, you induce anxiety frequently, so your likely subgoal is to do the opposite here if you can.
* [[Charlie]] has still not responded.
* Talk about Fraidycat on Leddit. He's unlikely to promote his own tool, so you better. Hopefully, it grows organically. I could use the 10th generation of that tool like yesterday.
* Write, fool.
