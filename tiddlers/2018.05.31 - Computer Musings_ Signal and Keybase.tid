title: 2018.05.31 - Computer Musings: Signal and Keybase

Nate offered Signal and Keybase, which seem significantly more real time to me. I'm a fan of a lot of what they are doing, and I didn't hate using the software. I'm not a fan of their failure to maximize their decentralization. But, they are still better than nothing. 

`yaourt -S keybase-bin signal`

Time to try them again.

Can't change password in keybase. That sucks. Somethings not quite right about it still. =/

I adore much of the idea of what it is though. Going for keybase first. Keybase does work on Manjaro cleanly though. Signal does not.
