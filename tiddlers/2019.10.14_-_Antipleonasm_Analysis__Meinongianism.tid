title: 2019.10.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Meinongianism

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
If you ask "Where are the non-existent objects?" the answer is, "Each in its own possible world." The only trouble with that notorious thicket, Meinong's jungle, is that it has not been zoned, plotted and divided into manageable lots, better known as possible worlds.
<<<

Who or what must do the zoning, plotting, division, and management? I do not know the extent to which we even need to reference [[The Dialetheia]] to explain the noneistic sosein (whatever is meaningful about non-existence is baked straight into [[The Good]]), but that foundation remains available to us. The Ideal Crowd of Hegelians, Spinozists, and Platonists don't seem as bothered by the extensiveness and reflexivity of [[The Infinite]] (incompleteness or lack of epistemic closure to the [[fff]], which I take to be equivalent to an ontological inconsistency //for us// as well, probably on [[faith]]). Any attempt at zoning or [[naming]] automagically points to a referent, and I don't think it's just in my head. It seems both amazing and too dead simple to be true to most ears. Yup, call me crazy: there is a sense in which unicorns are real external to my brain and even this material world. We're past finite computation, and we're going to have to let go of some moves or rules to which we normally feel entitled or bound. The real rubber meets the ideal road here. Now THIS is ~~pod-racing~~ metaphysics!

To my blind eyes, this modality still isn't as dangerous to me as the adjacent problem of how //our// contingency (not as mere appearance) arises from //that// necessity, which references ourselves not only as a thing simulating a semblance of the concept but as instantiating the property. Even the possibility of possible worlds hasn't (and can't) be safely mapped except by [[The Absolute]] as far as I can tell. If you have no problem with that risk, then I think this should be no sweat. Basically, the real problem is that we can't justifiably explain with certainty the meaning and being of possibilities in the first place. I'm not trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater here, but rather I'm pointing to the fact that most of us have already bitten much bigger question-begging bullets than Meinong's Jungle in assuming something like contingency obtains at all.<<ref "o">>

The being of non-being and becoming are similarly impossible for us to grasp all the way down (which doesn't give us a right to not pursue it). Is the Meinongian Jungle too audacious and unhedged? It seems like we could imagine it either way.
