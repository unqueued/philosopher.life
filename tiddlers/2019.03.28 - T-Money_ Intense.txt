How are you feeling man?
THU 10:56 AM
Better! =)
THU 10:56 AM
Still not 100%, but I can work today.
THU 10:56 AM
How about you?>
THU 10:56 AM
That's good. I saw on your wiki where they sent you home =(
THU 10:57 AM
Aye, lol. Probably should not have gone in. I took 2 days off.
THU 10:58 AM
How about you? You getting any rest? Feeling restless?
THU 10:59 AM
Both. Start PT in a few hours.
THU 10:59 AM
Cool.
THU 10:59 AM
Parents coming in today for my daughters theater play this weekend.
THU 10:59 AM
So I'm trying to clean I between resting. I don't wanna go to PT I. Pain.
THU 11:00 AM
Well, I hope it goes well with the parents. The pain sounds daunting.
THU 11:01 AM
It hadn't exceeded a level 5 or 6. But when I'm doing stuffy it stay around 2-5
THU 11:01 AM
Unless I'm. Lying down on a heating pad, I can make it go away.
THU 11:02 AM
Question.
THU 12:00 PM
Shoot
THU 12:00 PM
Why you gonna lable the story "T-Money  lies to wife"
THU 12:00 PM
For one thank God you didn't post the pictures. Two it was a funny ass story that was also scary as hell.
THU 12:01 PM
I'm not a moral justice warrier bro. I'm just T-Money. Telling you, in brutal honesty, an event that happened.
THU 12:01 PM
Meh. I suppose you see things different.
THU 12:02 PM
I'm just telling the event as it happened to me too, brutally honest.
THU 12:02 PM
That is all that you saw. Was me lying to my wife?
THU 12:03 PM
No. Of course not. The title does not dictate all the contents. Like judging a book by the cover alone.
THU 12:03 PM
Is that the most salient thing which popped out to me? Is that the mnemonic device which helps me recall what the story was? Yeah.
THU 12:04 PM
Wow. I don't understand how your brain works.
THU 12:04 PM
Same story and same images sent to two other close friends brought a very different response. The remeber the images if me lying in a pool of my own blood which was a potential play death but I survived and laughed with. Me at the close call.
THU 12:05 PM
I had gashes on my face. I had not only create a believable lie for. My wife but for all of. My Co. Workers.
THU 12:07 PM
I had to live with that. I still have scars. It's like waked up in a pool. Of your own vomit. (u cheated death)
THU 12:07 PM
And I cannot fathom another way to see the picture. A depressed drunk with terrible choices made a terrible decision and it cause me. Physical. Pain, humiliation, and embarrassment.
THU 12:09 PM
But yeah. I lied to the wife. I am. Very honest with her. Probabaly more honest with her than any other human.
THU 12:09 PM
But somethings are better left unsaid, or lied about.
THU 12:10 PM
Probabaly shouldn't had said anything to you. About it. However, I was surprised to see it in you wiki and with that title.
THU 12:13 PM
Meh.
THU 12:13 PM
I can't say I understand how my own brain works either, though I am trying.
THU 12:19 PM
It is possible you have not considered all of my responses: https://philosopher.life/#2019.02.24%20-%20T-Money%3A%20Torture:%5B%5B2019.02.24%20-%20T-Money%3A%20Torture%5D%5D%20%5B%5B2019.02.26%20-%20Wiki%20Review%3A%20Overflow%5D%5D
THU 12:19 PM
I was grieved to hear of what happened.
THU 12:20 PM
I had to wrestle with it even.
THU 12:20 PM
We do have different models of  who you are and what happened there.
THU 12:21 PM
Dude I walked around with guilt weighing me down.
THU 12:21 PM
That's why I expressed it to you and 2 others in attempt to relieve myself of some of the guilt.
THU 12:21 PM
It momentarily helpa
 It helps. When my friends share stories of their own to make me feel. Better. To know I am. Not alone.
THU 12:22 PM
I am listening. I spent time thinking and writing about it. Even the Wiki Review is a commentary on our conversation. I am thinking about you. You have my attention!
THU 12:23 PM
Relieving guilt has to be done in the right way too. It's not simply about getting something off your chest, it's about adjusting who you are. It's about accepting that regret, trying to change ourselves, and working toward something else.
THU 12:24 PM
I'm doing that too, to be clear
THU 12:25 PM
And, I'm trying to help you here as well.
THU 12:25 PM
You'll notice the next day, I'm begging you to be open with your wife about it. I'm strongly convinced she needs to know.
THU 12:25 PM
In time I will tell. Her the truth.
THU 12:26 PM
But she cannot be worried by my own thoughts. They are mine.
THU 12:26 PM
I think that's what empathy is like though: it's about worrying about other people's thoughts. It's about taking the thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and desires of others into account in our own weighings.
THU 12:27 PM
I don't disagree.
THU 12:27 PM
I would want to know if my wife were struggling like this, and she would want to know when I am. I think that's what being married is like.
THU 12:27 PM
So by lying to her I save her from worry.
THU 12:28 PM
I kept her from struggling.
THU 12:28 PM
I kept her out of it.
THU 12:28 PM
That is a rationalization.
THU 12:28 PM
Your point? Why not rationalize it?
THU 12:29 PM
Because rationalization is about confabulating a narrative for ourselves without actually being rational.
THU 12:29 PM
As I said the day after, I will continue to champion honesty with you.
THU 12:29 PM
I think you will find my honesty is leaps and bounds ahead of  society and most people in general.
THU 12:30 PM
It doesn't matter if everyone else is being radically dishonest, that doesn't excuse us to be dishonest ourselves.
THU 12:31 PM
It's not about comparing yourself to others: it's about comparing yourself to best versions of yourself.
THU 12:31 PM
Calibration by comparison?
THU 12:31 PM
We have to choose we are are going to be, and it's not about trying to say: "am I a decent person compared to the average person in society?" It's about saying: "is this the morally best version of myself that I can be?"
THU 12:32 PM
Aye. I think that is a decadea long endeavor generally only found towards the end of a man's life.
THU 12:33 PM
Decades
THU 12:33 PM
"lord knows I try"
THU 12:33 PM
No. It's about being good every day, even in the small things. The fabric of our moral lives emerges from the threads and weaving.
THU 12:34 PM
I understand you are trying. I'm trying to help too.
THU 12:34 PM
And if he and I cannot see my efforts, in spite of my own mental instability.
THU 12:34 PM
I don't know... "lord knows I try"
THU 12:35 PM
I want to attempt to be accountable to you. However, accountability to you is futile, as we all judge ourselves differently.
THU 12:37 PM
I know each and every mistake, failure, and misdeeds. I live with that. I try.
THU 12:38 PM
Each day to be less of my former and more to the better me.
THU 12:38 PM
But I cannot say each day is a success.
THU 12:39 PM
I'm not a relativist though. Some judgments are objectively better than others.
THU 12:39 PM
Not every day is not a success for most of us either.
THU 12:39 PM
Not every day is*
THU 12:39 PM
I have seen months of failure, regressions and unforgivable demise in my own mind.
THU 12:39 PM
I was blessed and cursed with the brain I have.
THU 12:40 PM
Some days it is all. I can do to go through the motions.
THU 12:40 PM
Because "I never asked to be born."
THU 12:41 PM
But, living morally is still your plight.
THU 12:41 PM
We are thrown into this world.
THU 12:41 PM
I think that is your plight.
THU 12:41 PM
Ah, there's the problem.
THU 12:41 PM
You just don't really care about being moral in the end. I get it.
THU 12:41 PM
It keeps showing up.
THU 12:41 PM
I don't understand your moral expectations. You live by a set of rules you have created.
THU 12:42 PM
I would argue "discovered"
THU 12:43 PM
I still Answer to Jesus.
THU 12:43 PM
And you deny the Golden Rule. That's commandment number 2.
THU 12:43 PM
I am a sinner indeed.
THU 12:44 PM
When I walk into a church, maybe 3% of the people who call themselves Christian actually mean it. 100% of them are sinners.
THU 12:44 PM
I am not worthy and never will. Be.
THU 12:44 PM
And if by his grace u make. It to heaven I am eternally greatful
THU 12:44 PM
"lord knows I try"
THU 12:44 PM
It's about trying to be worthy, even though we never will be. You have to be honest. If you really think you answer to Jesus, you can't turn around and say you don't answer to The Golden Rule.
THU 12:44 PM
That's not even attempting to be consistent.
THU 12:45 PM
The mental instability of a broken man is a sad and dark place. But I make no apology to you for my lack of consistancy.
THU 12:46 PM
Maybe I'm just trying to end a heated discussion with you?
THU 12:46 PM
Becuase your passion for morality is hot.
THU 12:47 PM
Let us take a break then.
THU 12:47 PM
That makes good sense.
THU 12:47 PM
I cannot live up to your standards. Nor Jesus, nor my own desire to be a better man.
THU 12:47 PM
We disagree on that claim. I do have high standard though.
THU 12:48 PM
But lord knows I try. And any man who claims to. Know how hard or how little. I try does not know me well
THU 12:48 PM
Who can't say they try on this definition?
THU 12:49 PM
I love you no less. And I appriciate the challenges you have placed in front of me.
THU 12:51 PM
I love you too!
THU 12:51 PM
But I apologize when you see me fail.
THU 12:51 PM
But that is. My burden. And I carry it. Not yours.
THU 12:51 PM
I ask for your understanding. Not your empathy.
THU 12:52 PM
To my understanding, empathy is at the heart of understanding. I will think more about what you are asking of me.
THU 12:53 PM
Ill make is more clear.
THU 12:53 PM
Turn down your intensity dial my brother.
THU 12:53 PM
I will make excuses for myself. I will fail you. I will hurt your heart. If you invest too much. I will then lie to you to save you of attempting to carry the burden.
THU 12:54 PM
I am learning. I am growing. I am getting better. But T-Money Moore cannot metamorphosize overnight.
THU 12:56 PM
The fact I stand here today.  physically, emotionally, and mentally broken stands a testament to my efforts.
THU 12:56 PM
I know that. I interpret you light of what I understand to be your limitations and context. I appreciate that you care at all. I think it speaks volumes.
THU 12:57 PM
FWIW, I feel that brokenness often. I'm still with you.
THU 12:58 PM
I care more than what you will ever know.
THU 1:02 PM
I need to got out the door to start my physical therapy
 Then pick up my daughter and get her ready for last night of dress rehearsals.
THU 1:03 PM
This broken man is stuffed back in the box. Behind the facade. It's showtime for dad, and for Samantha.
THU 1:03 PM
=)
THU 1:03 PM
I wish you luck. I hope it isn't too painful, and I hope the rehearsals go well. I hope showtime costs few spoons for you.
THU 1:04 PM
Image attached to message
THU 1:07 PM
I have to Google everything you ass
THU 1:07 PM
lol
THU 1:07 PM
I was thinking spoonful of sugar. Mary Poppins. (spoonful helps. The medicine go down)
THU 1:07 PM

THU 1:16 PM
