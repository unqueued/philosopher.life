title: Daily Wiki Experiment

For one hour each non-Sunday, the kids and I will work together on our wikis for 30 minutes. We will break for 5 minutes, then spend 10 minutes reading each other's wikis. This is a trial run to see if this is a habit worth forming.

---

Changed: This isn't working. I'm simply handing the time back to them and I'll be reviewing their wikis each night at dinner.
