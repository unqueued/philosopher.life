[11:20 AM] h0p3: That is a good point! Playing up the world of appearances, maybe.
[11:20 AM] h0p3: I don't enjoy scary stories. That was an important one for me to watch though.
[11:21 AM] h0p3: Also, I have notifications on. They don't stick nicely for Discord; I don't know the rule. That's why I'm late to answering, lol.
