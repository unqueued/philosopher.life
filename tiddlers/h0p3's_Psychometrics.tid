title: h0p3's Psychometrics

//This may or may not be useful to a reader. I think it's the curious attempt to quantify something which the wiki as a whole gives so much qualitative evidence for. I want to argue with the test-makers a lot. This is also something I'd like to come back and redo years from now.//

!! Testing Notes:

* Sources:
** https://openpsychometrics.org/
*** I found these to be very interesting. It demonstrated to me that I'm also on a path of physiological mental decline.
** http://www.yourmorals.org
*** These people are not philosophers. They attempt to go that direction, but they lack crucial distinctions in many of their metaethical questions. Despite my strong disagreement with their methodology and my very strong opinions on these matters, I also think this is interesting information, even if it isn't always accurate.

* Excepting the GRE, these tests were taken during an era of my life wherein I use cannabis at least 10 times in the past 30 days and drank moderately at least 5 times in the past 30 days. 

* All of these tests were taken under periods of depression, anxiety, intense stress, and profound sleep debt. I expect a 10-15 IQ point loss, as well as significant losses in trust, happiness, and optimism. My perceptions and ability to reason are impaired in these tests, but they are the data points I have available to me.

* I could just be making it all up. You are free to be [[Straussian]]ly uncharitable in your interpretation of these results. If you are wondering if I could get whatever answers I wanted on these tests (especially with studying of the underlying literature and the test mechanics themselves), I can play the test game if I wanted. You will have to Trust trust here and take my word for it that I've honestly tried to answer these questions with absolute honesty in the raw pursuit of the truth of who I am.

* I am also aware of the limitations of self-reporting. I'm aware of psychology as a historical discipline, with a terrifyingly unscientifically literature and unsound process. I give preference to biological, computational, and economic branches. Philosophical branches range between useless and absolutely fundamental to the discipline itself. The absurdly high value of the philosophical notions requires me to pay attention to literature I would normally dismiss because I'm digging for [[Diamonds]] and [[Redpills]] wherever I can find them.

* Unfortunately, I'm missing some information for these. Sorry. =/.

!! General Computing:

* RDOS Aspie Neurodiversity Score
** 157 of 200

My wife took it on my behalf (objectivity in self-assessment concern). Her results for me were: "You answered inconsistently on too many control questions." That is fascinating, and I believe this is because I'm an extremely high-functioning autistic person. Many people never realize it.

* Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)
** 44 of 50
** Where 16.4 is average and 32 is clinically significant (80% diagnosed scored at least 32)

I'm strongly convinced, especially after researching it.

* Empathizing and Systemizing scales
** Systematizing Items: My Average 3.2/4; Liberal Average 2.7/4; Conservative Average 2.7/4
** Empathy Items: My Average 2.4/4; Liberal Average 3.0/4; Conservative Average 2.8/4

Autism or quantitative-oriented psychopath (or both). 

* Verbal IQ
** 125

It's one of the few psychometrics that are stable and useful across time and our species. I have strong opinions about it, and I don't favor how we interpret it, use it, and think about it. But, it is absolutely worth measuring and thinking about. I perform poorly on this side of the IQ tests, and I agree it is not my strong suite.

* Inductive Reasoning
** 14/15 in 10:31 of 15 minutes

I don't know what this means without any point of comparison, but that's okay. I'm also positive I could have gotten 15/15. I've never taken a test like this before. At first, I didn't quite know what I was doing. But, now I see how to deconstruct these quickly. I believe I could shave that 10.5 minutes down to 6 minutes with practice. 

* GRE (2009)
** Verbal 570/800
** Quantitative 760/800
** Analytical Writing 5.5/6.0

I am convinced autism is part of the explanation of the wide variance in my verbal abilities. I am embarrassed by it. I remind myself this was with minimal study, and graduate school greatly improved my verbal reasoning. With practice, I expect I could achieve even more than the 30 point gains that +250 hours of studying would provide. However, no matter how much I practiced, there is something deeply flawed in my ability to communicate. It's obvious.

* Narcissistic Personality Inventory
** 10 of 40 (~15 is average)
** I was midpoint on superiority and entitlement facets, 1/3rd self-sufficient, 1/8th authoritative and exhibitionist, and zero on vanity and exploitativeness. 

I suggest that some of the questions were written in such a way that it must be interpreted as respecting human dignity. Furthermore, some of the questions required me to express my belief that I understand the world better, that I'm pursuing being moral and truth itself moreso than the average person, etc. Essentially, there are different ways in which one human specimen is better than another. This, however, is not the claim that we should treat anyone as lacking human dignity. The test fails to make that distinction.

* Short Dark Triad (SD3)
** Narcissism: 1.4/4; Score higher than 9% of the people who took this test.
*** Narcissism is an egotistical preoccupation with self. Because of all their experience with maintaining their self image, people who score high for narcissism will often appear charming but their narcissism will later lead to extreme difficulty in developing close relationships.
** Machiavellianism: 2.2/4; Score higher than 26% of the people who took this test.
*** Machiavellianism is a tendency to be manipulative and deceitful. It usually stems from a lack of respect or disillusionment for others.
** Psychopathy: 1.4/4; Score higher than 9% of the people who took this test.
*** Psychopathy reflects shallow emotional responses. The relative lack of emotions leads results in high stress tolerance, low empathy, little guilt and leads them to seek extremely stimulating activities, resulting in impulsivity and a disposition towards interpersonal conflict.

I am surprised by the results. In my introspection, I take myself to be more Psychopathic than Machiavellian. I describe the world in redpilled terms, but I am generally not prescriptively Machiavellian outside of a Just War Theory (it's not clear his intentions as an author were prescriptive either). I think my stress tolerance is incredibly high, and you just don't comprehend that you should be stressed about what I'm stressed about. It's the pain and stress of being intelligent and seeking relevance.

* IPIP Big Five Factor Markers
** Factor I, Extroversion: 25th percentile
** Factor II, Emotional Stability: 7th percentile
** Factor III, Agreeableness: 25th percentile
** Factor IV, Conscientiousness: 89th percentile
** Factor V, Intellect/Imagination: 95th percentile

I suggest these require interpretation in context. There are domains, for example, where I don't enjoy being intellectual and imaginative (or am simply not capable). I'm agreeable with specific kinds of people in tremendous ways, but overall (in general, with the average person), I think I'm quite disagreeable (moreso than demonstrated here) the more we get to know each other. I find the emotional stability to be curious; I feel unstable inside, no doubt, but I feel like I'm handling something which would drive the average person insane if they understood it. Stand in my shoes; I think they are a lot bigger than you realize.

* Multifactor General Knowledge Test
** Where normalized average is 500 (of 800 max) and zero correlation between domains A and B (but correlation within a domain).
** Domain A
*** A1: 488
**** e.g "Who of these were famous poets?", "Which of these are Broadway musicals?", "Which of these are religious holidays?"
*** A2: 630
**** e.g. "Which of these drugs are painkillers?", "Which of these diseases are sexually transmitted?", "Which of these are brands of cigarettes?"
** Domain B
*** B1: 627
**** e.g "Which of these were ever colonies of France?", "Which of these countries produce a lot of oil?", "Which of these countries possess nuclear weapons?"
*** B2: 797
**** e.g. "Which of these file types are video?", "Which of these are web browsers?", "Which of these are versions of the Linux operating system?"

Sounds about right to me. I feel incompetent in naming famous things in many ways. It's interesting to see the body of cultures I belong to.

* OCL Working Memory Test
** 37, average is 36.3. 

Ouch! Well, I'm right to think my mind is going down the toilet. I am positive I would have performed exceedingly well on this test when I was young. I had an amazing memory, and now, I am trash.

* Exposure Based Face Memory Test
** 68th percentile. 

No prosopagnosia for me. Again, I would have aced that test as a younger human.

* Depression Anxiety Stress Scale
** Depression: 18 (moderate)
** Anxiety: 13 (moderate)
** Stress: 32 (severe)

I'm stressed. Shocker! =)

* Resilience Traits
** Adaptability: 41/50
** Self-control: 39/50
** Self-sufficiency: 35/50
** Optimism: 37/50
** Persistence: 38/50

I disagree with this test. I think I'm not nearly as adaptable as this test claims. I believe my self-control under the pressures I have is absurdly high. I'm extremely pessimistic. They have that wrong. I also think I'm far more persistent than they can judge with these questions. 



!! Morality & Politics, etc:

* Survey of Dictionary-based Isms (from 1 to 5 scale)
** Alpha, Tradition-oriented Religiousness: 1.0/5.0
*** The alpha-factor, described as "tradition-oriented religiousness", reflects adherence to traditional (religious) standards of morality and resistance to change in social structure.
** Beta, Unmitigated Self-Interest: 1.6/5.0
*** The beta factor, described as "unmitigated self-interest", reflects a competitive world view where the goal of a person is to do as best for themselves as possible and the groups that they belong to, with the expectation that this will come at the expense of someone else.
** Gamma, Communal Rationalism: 3.7/5.0
*** The gamma factor, described as "communal rationalism", reflects a optimistic view of human nature and society. Individuals who score high in communal rationalism tend to believe that democracy works well.
** Delta, Subjective Spirituality: 2.0/5.0
*** The delta factor, described as "subjective spirituality", reflects spiritual beliefs outside of organized religion.
** Epsilon, Egalitarianism: 4.6/5.0
*** The epsilon factor, described as "egalitarianism", reflects a commitment to. Individuals who score high on this factor believe that inequality must be cause by some sort of oppression, while individuals low in egalitarianism tend to see inequality and inevitable and arising from natural factors.

Descriptively my beta should be towards a 5.0, but prescriptively towards a 1.0. Gamma is stupid wrong. I'm extremely cynical about human nature and society, but I believe decentralizing power is prescriptively what we ought to push for. The questions did a terrible job peeling these apart (as usual). I am not spiritual in any meaningful way, but some of the questions were not worded as such; believe in metaphysics != spiritual. I am surprised I didn't achieve 5.0 on egalitarianism. Again, the questions failed to distinguish who we are from who we ought to be.

* The Political Compass
** Economic Left/Right: -5.5
** Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -7.38 

Sounds about right to me.

* Right-wing Authoritarianism Scale
** 12.5%

I posit that what feels right-wing authoritarian is actually my beliefs in metaethical perfectionism combined with the fact that the test failed entirely to distinguish between what I felt was morally normative from what ought to be legislated. I suggest that I am not authoritarian, although I do pursue the rule of law because I do not consider the state of nature to be a good thing.

* Behavioral Identification Form
** High-level construals emphasis: I score 1.0/1.2; average is .6/1.2.

I see the intentions, reasons, and implications of things. I am constantly aware of the conceptual distinction between the instrumental means and the intrinsic ends. There is a grid in my perception of the world which strictly separates hypothetical imperatives from categorical imperatives. 

* Substance Use Harm Reduction Attitude Questionnaire
** 7/7 positive attitude; Liberal Average 6.1/7; Conservative Average 4.6/7
** 2.5/7 negative attitude; Liberal Average 2.6/7; Conservative Average 4.2/7

I'm clearly an experienced and educated drug user. Also, I'm Leftist.

* Moral Foundations Questionnaire
** Harm: My Average 4.2/5; Liberal Average 3.7/5; Conservative Average 3.1/5
** Fairness: My Average 4.7/5; Liberal Average 3.7/5; Conservative Average 3.1/5
** Loyalty: My Average 0.8/5; Liberal Average 2.2/5; Conservative Average 3.1/5
** Authority: My Average 1.0/5; Liberal Average 2.1/5; Conservative Average 3.3/5
** Purity: My Average 0.3/5; Liberal Average 1.4/5; Conservative Average 3.0/5

Moral Left As Fuck!

* Individualism-Collectivism scale
** Individualism: My Average 4.5/5; Male Average 4.2/5; Female Average 4.0/5
** Collectivism: My Average 4.4/5; Male Average 3.6/5; Female Average 3.8/5

Clearly, I want to have my cake and eat it too.

* Ethical Work Culture Survey 
** Fairness: My Average 2.7/7; Liberal Average 4.7/7; Conservative Average 4.8/7
** Awareness: My Average 1.0/7; Liberal Average 4.9/7; Conservative Average 5.0/7
** Selfishness: My Average 6.7/7; Liberal Average 4.0/7; Conservative Average 4.2/7
** Benevolence: My Average 4.7/7; Liberal Average 5.0/7; Conservative Average 4.8/7
** Decision Making: My Average 2.0/7; Liberal Average 4.7/7; Conservative Average 4.7/7
** Efficacy: My Average 2.0/7; Liberal Average 5.1/7; Conservative Average 5.2/7
** Empathy: My Average 2.0/7; Liberal Average 5.3/7; Conservative Average 5.1/7
** Trust: My Average 1.2/7; Liberal Average 5.0/7; Conservative Average 5.0/7

Clearly, my perceptions of work cultures tends to be very cynical. Note, of course, the difference between my prescription and description. The survey failed to make that distinction. That it appears I'm conservative here is due to the fact that I agree with the conservative's description of the selfishness of the human species (while really understanding how far it goes). Of course, I don't think the world ought to be like that.

* Individual Differences in Anthropomorphism Questionnaire
** Anthropomorphic Non-Differentiationism: My Average 2.1/7; Liberal Average 3.3/7; Conservative Average 2.7/7

Again, I have conservative appearing tendencies. It is quite obvious to me that the vast majority of creatures are not Daseinic, and that is a powerful difference. That is not the claim that animals don't have rights directly or indirectly (even if only in virtue of ourselve, if you are worried about right-bearers; e.g. do we want to be the kind of person that destroy the ecosystem or would lie [even to a dog]?)

* Free Will and Determinism Scale
** Fate: My Average 2.7/5; Liberal Average 1.8/5; Conservative Average 2.3/5
** Scientific Causation: My Average 3.7/5; Liberal Average 3.1/5; Conservative Average 2.6/5
** Randomness: My Average 3.3/5; Liberal Average 3.3/5; Conservative Average 3.1/5
** Free Will: My Average 2.6/5; Liberal Average 3.2/5; Conservative Average 4.0/5

Ah, one of my specialties. I fear my answers here are pretty meaningless. The questions were flawed left and right. Many demonstrated a lack of understanding of the concepts they were inquirying about. They aren't going to capture the right information from me with these questions. I have incredibly strong opinions and feelings about this domain. 

* Transhumanist Movement: Good or Bad?
** It's Bad: My Average 3.0/6; Liberal Average 2.9/6; Conservative Average 4.1/6
** It's Good: My Average 5.0/6; Liberal Average 4.9/6; Conservative Average 3.9/6

I suppose I look like a standard liberal here. I have hopes for what is scientifically possible, but I'm skeptical we'll accomplish it. Even if we did technologically reach that point, I'm not sure we would wield that two-edged blade wisely either. I find the pursuit of eternal life to be reasonable, except insofar as you've deluded yourself into thinking you will actually succeed.

* Society, Gender, and Groups
** Social Dominance: My Average 1.6/6; Liberal Average 2.1/6; Conservative Average 3.5/6
** Benevolent Sexism: My Average 3.5/6; Liberal Average 3.2/6; Conservative Average 3.8/6
** Hostile Sexism: My Average 3.8/6; Liberal Average 3.4/6; Conservative Average 3.6/6

I am egalitarian. I stand behind the Veil of Ignorance in the Original Position wearing the opposite of the Ring of Gyges. The questions are worded quite poorly in this section. The Benevolent Sexism questions, for example, fail to distinguish what I think I owe to all humans in respecting their dignity from special treatment for females. Peel those apart, and you'll see I do not favor special treatment at all. That's not the golden rule applied universally. I think it's hilarious I'm considered a Hostile Sexist. For the record, I am descriptively redpilled. I will again tell you that your questions continue to make a naturalistic fallacy. My opposition to social dominance in general, my pursuit of the decentrality of power qua the dignity of humanity, is what you should truly to be testing.

* Conservatism
** Conservatism: My Average 2.7/6; Liberal Average 3.7/6; Conservative Average 3.6/6
** Traditionalism: My Average 3.7/6; Liberal Average 3.3/6; Conservative Average 2.8/6
** Authoritarianism: My Average 3.0/6; Liberal Average 3.2/6; Conservative Average 3.2/6

Looks pretty left to me.

* The Disgust Scale
** Total Score: My Average 1.0/4; Liberal Average 1.8/4; Conservative Average 2.0/4
** Core: My Average 1.4/4; Liberal Average 2.1/4; Conservative Average 2.3/4
** Animal Reminder: My Average 0.8/4; Liberal Average 1.8/4; Conservative Average 1.9/4
** Contamination: My Average 0.4/4; Liberal Average 1.0/4; Conservative Average 1.5/4

I have seen and experienced a lot. I'm difficult to disgust or embarrass in many ways. My disgust is generally a moral rather than one of conventions or taste. Again, the leftist trend here.

* Satisfaction With Life Scale
** Implicit Happiness Score: My Average .2/.9; Partnered .6/.9; Non-Partner Relationship .8/.9; Single .5/.9; Strong Liberal Average .5/.9; Liberal .6/.9; Conservative Average .5/.9; Strong Conservative .5/.9
** Self-Reported Satisfaction: My Average 2.8/5; Liberal Average 4.3/5; Conservative Average 4.5/5

People in the middle, those who are not committed to their relationships or a political point of view, tend to be a lot happier than me. My implicit and explicit testing demonstrate that I am honest and aware of how I'm feeling.

Colorado is very implicitly happy! Ha, 420blazeit.

* Openness to Experience facet of the HEXACO Personality Inventory-Revised
** Aesthetic: 4.0/5; average is 3.9/5
** Inquisitiveness: 4.8/5; average is 4.1/5
** Creativity: 3.8/5; average is 4.1/5
** Unconventionality: 5.0/5; average is 4.2/5
** Creative Activities: 5.0/5; average is 4.0/5

I'm open to exploring and being creative, but I'm not active enough in how I express myself creatively. Meh. Perhaps. My goal is to build things in my life that don't require me to constantly be creative. I crave routine in a sense, but I also crave creatively improving that routine.

* Schwartz Value Survey
** Power: My Average -?/7; Liberal Average 1.5/7; Conservative Average 2.3/7
*** Social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources 
** Achievement: My Average 3.5/7; Liberal Average 3.9/7; Conservative Average 4.3/7
*** Personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards
** Hedonism: My Average 6.0/7; Liberal Average 3.8/7; Conservative Average 3.2/7
*** Pleasure or sensuous gratification for oneself 
** Stimulation: My Average 3.0/7; Liberal Average 3.4/7; Conservative Average 2.9/7
*** Excitement, novelty, and challenge in life 
** Self-Direction: My Average 5.6/7; Liberal Average 5.0/7; Conservative Average 4.6/7 
*** Independent thought and action - choosing, creating, exploring
** Universalism: My Average 5.4/7; Liberal Average 4.7/7; Conservative Average 3.4/7
*** Understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all people and for nature
** Benevolence:  My Average 4.6/7; Liberal Average 4.5/7; Conservative Average 4.7/7
*** Preservation and enhancement of the welfare of people with whom one is in frequent personal contact
** Tradition: My Average 0.6/7; Liberal Average 1.9/7; Conservative Average 3.2/7
*** Respect, commitment, and acceptance of the customs and ideas that traditional culture or religion provide 
** Conformity: My Average 3.0/7; Liberal Average 2.9/7; Conservative Average 4.2/7 
*** Restraint of actions, inclinations, and impulses likely to upset or harm others and violate social expectations or norms
** Security: My Average 2.4/7; Liberal Average 3.2/7; Conservative Average 4.2/7
*** Safety, harmony, and stability of society, of relationships, and of self 

Leftism is pretty apparent here. Not sure I have much to say.

* Beliefs about Well-being Scale
** Hedonism view of happiness (Life satisfaction)
*** Experiences of pleasure (of both mind and body): My Average 6.0/7; Male Average 4.7/7; Female Average 4.7/7; Liberal Average 4.8/7; Conservative Average 4.4/7
*** Lack of negative and unpleasant experiences: My Average 2.3/7; Male Average 3.4/7; Female Average 3.3/7; Liberal Average 3.4/7; Conservative Average 3.3/7
** Eudaimonic view of happiness (Having a sense of meaning or purpose)
*** Developing personal strengths: My Average 7.0/7; Male Average 5.8/7; Female Average 5.8/7; Liberal Average 5.8/7; Conservative Average 5.9/7
*** Contribution to others: My Average 6.8/7; Male Average 5.0/7; Female Average 5.4/7; Liberal Average 5.5/7; Conservative Average 5.1/7

I don't think pain is absolutely and completely conceptually a bad thing in all possible contexts. There are cases where it is bad, but it's instrumentality is so crucial, I'm glad we have it. Being open to negativity is key for personal growth, which ultimately affects our hedonic pleasure in many respects. You will note that I favor pleasure but not absolute pain avoidance, and I'm strongly eudaimonic in my approach (duh). Again, fairly leftist.

* Beliefs about Government Budget and Economics Study Scale
** Household Budget Beliefs: My Average 1.0/7; Liberal Average 3.0/7; Conservative Average 5.0/7; Libertarian Average 5.0/7
** Macroeconomic Budget Beliefs: My Average 3.7/7; Liberal Average 4.8/7; Conservative Average 3.9/7; Libertarian Average 3.2/7
** Growth Goals: My Average 1.0/7; Liberal Average 3.3/7; Conservative Average 4.6/7; Libertarian Average 4.2/7
** Well-Being Goals: My Average 7.0/7; Liberal Average 5.5/7; Conservative Average 4.0/7; Libertarian Average 3.7/7

Ah, nothing for Lefists on this scale, I see. It's obvious when you look at the numbers, excepting Macro. There I am skeptical alongside the Libertarian. We have different visions and goals than the center of the overton window (which is quite Rightist).

* Trust Scale
** Ability: My Average 4.3/5; Liberal Average 4.3/5; Conservative Average 4.2/5
*** how much competence or expertise that person has
** Benevolence: My Average 1.4/5; Liberal Average 2.9/5; Conservative Average 2.9/5
*** how much that person acts in the interest and benefit of others
** Integrity: My Average 3.8/5; Liberal Average 3.6/5; Conservative Average 3.7/5
*** how closely that person follow acceptable values or principles

I have a ton of problems with this test. I think epistemic normativity is a core subset of ethics. One can be epistemically normative without being ethical though, and that's a distinction that requires more teasing apart. I highly value expertise, and I hope experts use their expertise wisely. I don't think most people are good though.


!! Framing, Funsies, and Preference:

* Jungian/Myers-Briggs Personality Type

** When presented with a trypohobia inducing image, you duration guess was off by an average of 0.9 seconds.
** This makes your ratio 1.1. Ratios more than 2 may indicate strong trypophobia.

* Nature Relatedness Scale (NR-6)
** 3.67/5 (Average 3.28 for college student)

* Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale.
** Government malfeasance: this facet reflects a belief that the government commits crimes on its own citizens.
*** 4.33/5
** Extraterrestrial cover-up: this facet reflects a belief that information about aliens is being concealed from the public.
*** 1/5

** The EMAS measures one variable, traditionalism. 
** 69/100

*** APF1 could possibly be described as a preference for unconventionality.
*** APF1 has significant correlations with personality. Individuals who score higher in APF1 are more likely to be politically liberal and artistic.
** APF2: 79
*** APF2 could possibly be described as a preference against overt sexuality.
*** What? Really? I love pornography. I think we should run around naked and fuck all the time. Is this true? I purposely tried not to worry about anything besides their face. I'm kind of shocked.

* Nonverbal Immediacy Scale
** 73, average for men 93.8
** Greater levels of nonverbal immediacy are generally seen as positive and are statistically associated with a variety of positive outcomes.
