title: 2017.02.14 -- Realpolitik Speculation: Real Unemployment

Unemployment is a misused economic marker turned realpolitik symbol (like the price of gas). It enables us to inform and tell many kinds of fundamental political and economic stories.<<ref "1">> It's an influential metric about a contentious issue.<<ref "2">>  

Defining and measuring unemployment is not simple. There are many stakeholders and interpretations of data that isn't entirely public. It's crucial that we appreciate what it represents, what it tells us, and more importantly, what it doesn't. Most people use the official U-3 unemployment rate because that's what most news outlets use. I believe this is a mistake on both practical and theoretical levels. 

I do not mean this in a post-fact sense: we should take statistics and those who wield them with a grain of salt. Social science requires context and argumentation.<<ref "3">> Problematically, I am convinced people gloss over what unemployment is actually trying to measure.

The goal of the "Unemployment Rate" project is to measure and identify patterns in labor underutilization.<<ref "4">> The goal isn't to merely count in simple piles who has a job and who doesn't. There's something deeper and broader we're trying to accomplish with it. Roughly, we're trying to measure and define the various contexts in which people's skills, knowledge, effort, time, etc. are being used by our economy. i.e. Is capitalism maximally consuming human capital? Who is being consumed, in what ways, to what extent, etc.?

Unfortunately, even the more realistic U-6 measurement, which tends to show double the "official" unemployment rate, does a  poor job of capturing the ideal information we seek. Of course, U-3 and U-6 tend to show extremely similar graph structures (not an accident), and I'd wager both have their uses for people working in economic, financial, and monetary sectors. One of them, however, is clearly closer to the ideal mark (not that we will ever reach such a thing; it is clearly infeasible) though, namely U-6. It is a more accurate depiction of labor underutilization, the underutilization of human capital.

Our information is deeply incomplete. The "pragmatically" (i.e. self-interested) willful-ignorant will be tempted to say, "this is the best we've got" and be done with it. That is the wrong attitude, and that is not how we should aim for the truth (particularly on such a crucial metric for understanding the natures of human realities). We really must dig into what counts as "people's skills, knowledge, effort, and time" to see the holes in our measurements, to more closely align theory and practice, and to be able to more accurately understand the world we live in so that we can become a happier species. 

I think this is a much clearer (yet obviously far from clear) set of ideal metrics of the Real Unemployment story: 

* If I have X amount of skill, and only Y amount of it used, then Z% of my skill-based capital is being used. 
* If I have X amount of knowledge, and only Y amount of it used, then Z% of my knowledge-based capital is being used. 
* If I have X amount of effort, and only Y amount of it used, then Z% of my effort-based capital is being used. 
* If I have X amount of time, and only Y amount of it used, then Z% of my time-based capital is being used. 
* ...and so on and so forth...
* etc.

Take a genius, force her to pick cotton for her entire life, and you've deeply unemployed her because you underutilized and underemployed her as human capital.<<ref "5">>

There is an ideal algorithm for sorting through this ideal data which gives us the ideal unemployment/underemployment<<ref "6">>/underutilizated human capital rate. The U-3 measurement is miles from the ideal. More importantly, it is even miles from the practically ideal or the ideally practical. While nobody and no measurement is perfect, we can do a lot better.<<ref "7">>

We've accepted an unreasonable "new normal" by ignoring the reality of what is measured, by being content with the U-3 measurement, by not taking it upon ourselves to think carefully about what is happening and what it means. That aphoristic phrase: lies, damned lies, and statistics is applicable here (even the statistics themselves show it). When you start looking more closely, you'll find the official information deeply lacking. Look around you. Use your imagination to see the possibilities. Reality is darker than you think, and it can be a lot brighter than you realize.<<ref "8">> 

Shadow unemployment numbers can be found. Pay attention.

<<footnotes "1" "The audience must always seek to understand who is telling them the story and why. (Trust no one, yo. [;P])">>

<<footnotes "2" "During my last conversation with my parents, things were going swimmingly enough. Two hiccups, one was a discussion about substance use (although, they brought up the subject, I clearly made them uncomfortable when I brought up my own use later). The other was unemployment. My parents and I clearly disagree on the state of the world in many ways. We try to say the right words with each other and avoid topics that might cause conflict. Unfortunately, they often don't know what we disagree on. I hate that we feel like we're in a lose-lose position. I also react strongly when I see that it is their and their generation's attiude and point of view that have brought this calamity upon me and mine (I lacked empathy [and so did they]; I hope I will do better).">> 

<<footnotes "3" "My parents remain ever correct in their appreciation for mixed quantitative+qualitative methodology in social sciences.">>

<<footnotes "4" "Although, that isn't the Final Telos. Clearly, we take these measurements for other reasons.">>

<<footnotes "5" "There are other important narratives to consider here. When you define The Good, you have an even stronger point of reference to understand the underuse and even misuse of human capital. We move past mere capitalist exploitation into understanding the ways and extents to which we contribute to and partake of The Good. This is what the ideal of ideal Real Unemployment measurements is about.">>

<<footnotes "6" "I can hear the morons now claiming that the problem of underemployment is simply the result of too many people going to college (as if the fundamental reason to be educated boils down to one's market value [to be against the liberal arts is literally anti-intellectualism and antipathy for humanity]). I do not trust anyone who does not immediately accept the necessity of idealism, regardless of how practical they find themselves to be. For the record: Mike Rowe is a conartist.">>

<<footnotes "7" "Unless we must discuss the very concept of freedom. This is a lose/lose position though. You will give something much greater to be right on this.">>

<<footnotes "8" "Do not commit the naturalistic is/ought fallacy; do not conflate them.">>
