title: 2019.12.21 - TDL: Family Time

* Family Time!
* We need to develop a family checklist for the remaining week.
* Ribs, wedges, veggies, fruit
* My vote is not to pack tomorrow.
** Except decorations and glass. 
* Hey, you should message fam.
* Perhaps we should come up with cash for that vehicle. 
** Maybe Monday go and see it. We could really use it.
* We need 6 padlocks (rather not dip into the pick pack).
* Wife wants Manjaro back instead of Ubuntu. 
** I should take this one in the interest of time.
** We should switch to Bob for her now.
