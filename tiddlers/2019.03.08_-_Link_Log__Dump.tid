*** http://adrenaline.ucsd.edu/Kirsh/Articles/Interaction/thinkingwithbody.pdf
*** Signaling Theory: interesting to see to oneself and to others distinguished. For coordination doesn't appear different enough to me. Like how it is concerned with energy efficiency. I'm not sure about the phenomenology part.
** https://www.alexirpan.com/2019/02/22/alphastar.html
*** What AlphaStar learned was how to spend APM as a resource. It figured out when it should go superhuman.
** https://aeon.co/essays/its-time-for-a-robust-philosophical-defence-of-truth-in-science
*** The failing of positive was a failure to recognize the necessity of OG Rationalist faith and assuming that metaphysics is unnecessary. You will never have [[The End]] in physics itself.
*** I'll stick my neck out and say empiricism, as the last steps in teleological inferentialism, usually gives us the only realism available to us. I'm far more interested in science as justified belief than certain truth. Obviously, you aren't doing science if you don't assume normativity: there is philosophical discourse that doesn't take up the assumption of wisdom from the very beginning. It's not just truth, it's [[salient]] truth that we are engaged in finding (even if indirectly, to various [[dok]], and so on.).
** https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/18/do-neural-nets-dream-of-electric-hobbits/
*** Hard to argue against that. He's not the only one I've seen say it. Interestingly, if it's just pure dreaming, if there is nothing lucid or conscious about it, I'm cool with it. Otherwise, ethics kicks in to protect our creation.
** https://fordham.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&context=phil_babich
*** He hated science, and he moves away from the apodicticity of Husserl for a reason (I'm not convinced that Husserl doesn't see intersubjectivity as a type of science). I think Heidegger is gunky, semblance, emotional, and analog. Of course, he's going to see language differently, as do the schools of thought which come from him. Despite sympathies, I consider myself non-deflationary in metaphysics.
*** I think analytic philosophy is still well-poised to explain many limits of science. GÃ¶del is Plato reborn to me. The problem is that analytics flee from faith (minus the logicians who realize [[The Dialetheia]] of [[The Infinite]] is the only out).
*** Obviously, I'm still a fan of analytic writing styles, by miles. The wiki is a mix though. I still find the analytic style far superior, but I would.
*** It's clear to me that both schools have devolved into postmodern deconstruction so thorough that construction beyond mere constructivism rarely obtains (and, no, I don't buy self-reports here). The mathematical constructivists have some serious humility though. 
*** I really wanted to like Nietzsche. 
*** A lot of younger philosophers study both, and for good reason.
** https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/hopepunk-cyberpunk-solarpunk-science-fiction-broken.html
*** Well, I'm not that kind of anarchist. I also think I'm directly more constructive.
** https://sideways-view.com/2019/03/03/on-redistribution/
*** Heard a version of this argument from one of my econ professors. Sounds like only a shitty stopgap after we've figured out how to tax the wealthy. Unfortunately, the means of production of power must be decentralized.

*** I have no idea how to solve the problem effectively enough. I have seen plenty of fucking eyebleach. People do need to realize just how fucking evil people can be.
** https://epochemagazine.org/learnification-and-the-attack-on-education-ce259c9d5bdb
*** It should be in service to society; we're political animals. You have to have a standard of [[The Good]]. I agree school needs to be radically different.

** http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/15757/1/naturalness_emergence.pdf
*** I must be retarded. I don't see the problem here. I'm okay with absurd "coincidence" at this level though, and I'm willing to accept mere appearance of naturalness. But, when it comes to physics, I'm not convinced it can be answered without appealing to both consciousness and [[The Good]]. Too much woo and/or metaphysics for a scientist though. No, I must not understand.
