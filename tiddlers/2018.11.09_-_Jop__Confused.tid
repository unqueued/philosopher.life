I claim myself that I am one off the [[h0p3's]] family because that makes me very proud. I am very happy that I can share my idea even I don't know that is correct or not. Because I am talking with a philosopher so who am I? no one. I know only that I love God I love Jesus I have been trying to say and to let you know that I feel like your knowledge can help a lot of people. I'm not saying about people in America I'm talking about people in Thailand you have been there so you know what I'm talking about. I'm still working on my big dream. I know it's not easy but I'm working on it I have faith I believe in him and am going to do it. I can tell you everything that you want to know but I don't want to put on the Weeki because that is my privacy. I love Jesus more than anything and that is the key to help my life being better today. Love you.

Monday I took Sarah to see her doctor about vomiting. Also she got a flu shot and the doctor said everything is ok. Tuesday was Melissa turn to get her flu shot she even wrote on a piece of paper that she was scared to death but she did fine. Wednesday and Thursday I had a great time with exercising. It helps me a lot to reduce my anxiety also it keeps me healthy and I'm working on eat more vegetable and try to lose some weight. Today is Friday I had a message earlier in the morning to be a substitute teacher so I had to go to work until 12:30. And now I am here sitting in my house but I have to leave again at 2:45 to work in aftercare. I hope you are satisfied with my information( I'm being sarcastic hahaha):stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
FRI 2:14 PM
I hear your sarcasm! =)
FRI 2:29 PM
I'm glad that the doctor said everything is ok.
FRI 2:29 PM
It's fascinating that Melissa wrote that down, lol.
FRI 2:29 PM
Why did she write it?
FRI 2:29 PM
What are you doing for exercise?
FRI 2:29 PM
You know, I've been considering going back on a diet for a while. My last one was successful, but I think I could lose even more.
FRI 2:30 PM
I'd join you in calorie counting, if you'd like.
FRI 2:30 PM
Thank you but there are many Thai food that they don't have on the program. I want to try to do only one meal a day but it's going to be hard and I don't want to go back to have anxiety again so I have to take it very carefully and slowly. I'm going to a gym it's very cheap it's cost only $10 per month. I do everything that they have in the gym or even sometimes I do yoka too.
I'm trying to convince my husband to do it with me but he always say no. I keep asking him to try but I also know that he works hard so I'm going to give him more time as long as he want. I also encouraged him to eat more green vegetable and I know he doesn't like it that much but I'm keep trying. Melissa and Sara they have their own notebook that they can draw or write anything that they want. For Melissa she is learning a lot about writing so that is something that she want to write it down. I also write down too but I write on a notebook not on Wiki hahaha.
FRI 2:41 PM
I have to go to work now you have a good day bye.
FRI 2:42 PM
Bye, have a good day. =)
FRI 2:42 PM
