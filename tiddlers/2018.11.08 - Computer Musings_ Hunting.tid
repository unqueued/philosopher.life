Son's minimal setup means he's playing games out of the gate. /facepalm. [[j3d1h]] setting up DNSmasq whitelist.

Ubiquiti longrange AP is working: "Lord of the Files" lives again. It is wildly better for my son's machine. Bad news, as my son pointed out, is that it is making a static/clicky sound...the AP, with no mechanic parts, is making sound. Something is dying in it.

Hunting for gaming machines. Still thinking KVM switches may be the way to go. Dryer and OpenWRT router also something I'm hunting for.
