*** Blame Russia! Rofl. This is insanity. The inability to understand the rift between the Berniebros and Clintonians is staggering. The DNC is to blame for this rift far moreso than Russia. Russia's influence was primarily with alt-right and the lower IQ end of the conservatives, although they made waves outside of that. This person is attempting to re-write history and demonize the wrong people here. 
*** The "Fool us once" failing to learn from history mentality is atrociously hypocritical. Have you learned nothing from the cold-war? Look, Russia isn't nearly as effective in deploying memetic weapons against US citizens as our own media, military, and the wealthy of our nation. Russia threw curve ball at the primary forces in our lives, but to blame Russia is a fundamental error and blindness to reality.

*** My waffling on this issue is over. I don't think this is the solution by any stretch. It is a short-term must-implement stop-gap that gets us over the hump just to even find the fitting solution to the crisis of capitalism.

*** Even though I somehow know better, I my bias is actually a wealthy-mindset one.

** https://mashable.com/2018/02/26/ai-beats-humans-at-contracts/
*** This is happening faster than I could have dreamed. I'm sure there's an arms race here too. Will it become so complex that even legal documents become blackboxes which only AI can "understand" (themselves blackboxes), and that anyone without their own AI is ready to get beatdown in our legal system? Or, will our legal system even be able to understand this, to make use of it? Will our own legal system have its own AI? It will be gamed hard.

*** I don't know what this means. I can say that a number of Russian upper-class are moving into the US.

* Fishy
** https://qz.com/1213777/the-two-mental-shifts-highly-successful-people-make/
*** Sounds like bullshit to me, I hate to say.
** https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/23/study-students-believe-they-are-prepared-workplace-employers-disagree
*** To my eyes, businesses want to maximize price-efficient capital extraction, limit mobility and critical thinking outside of the task at hand. They don't want well-rounded, educated, liber/libre workers. Unfortunately, schools are bending this direction. I am always shocked by the "economical" analysis of getting a piece of paper.

*** You aren't being cynical enough, and now I hold you in contempt. Who really controls the DNC?
** https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/02/parkland-shooting-hoax-latest-right-dishonesty-epidemic/
*** Look, I grant that it is overt, obvious, and ridiculous on the Right. However, I see it insidiously hidden but just as significantly in the progressives. These are just different stages of simulacra. This is an epidemic across all parties in power.

* Interesting

*** She is so hot. Look, we disagree on the fundamentals, but her integrity makes me want to blow my load in and on her. I would vote for her.

*** I'm not swept by this pseudo-Christ figure, but I'm glad to see this.

** https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc
*** One of my worries about Rust for embedded is that it doesn't exist for a number of architectures. Perhaps Rust needs to compile down to C instead of going into LLVM. Or, better yet, it should officially support both. This is an interesting problem to consider.

* For my wife:

*** I'm 99% sure you've seen this, but just in case you haven't, I bring it to your attention.
** http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180219-toxic-perfectionism-is-on-the-rise
*** But, when we move the goalposts to "doing our best" isn't that another kind of perfectionism? Anytime we want to have any standard of the good, we by definition posit a perfection. I do not know how to handle this. We need an answer; it's not only important for ourselves but for our children (and parenting) as well.

*** Did not know about the bananas nor strokelike symptoms.
