title: 2019.02.09 - Prompted Introspection: Moving

!! Have you ever moved? Tell about one of your moves.

Of course. As the son of two Methodist elders, the bishop of the conference was required to place them wherever he saw fit (which was the result of political negotiations between several power structures). This meant we moved often. My wife and I both grew up like this. We don't have roots.

It was a point of pride in our house that we were accomplished at moving.<<ref "2020.02.10-1">>

I can recall in 6th grade, my donors sat us down to slowly draw out the dots for us to connect: we were moving (female donor's first doctoral program). In allowing us to connect the dots, it made us feel like we came up with the conclusion: they were able to artificially make us feel better about it. They did the same thing when I was 19 when they were deciding they were going to move for missions. Truly, they were skilled manipulators many times.

The move was fine. Its complexity was compounded by rescuing [[AA]] from a psychopathic ex and a separate stalker (I'd never had the chance to get to know her otherwise!). My male donor was given a charge ~1.5 hours away, but we lived primarily in Wilmore, on campus. It showed me what wealth could even begin to look like in a way I had never seen before. Meeting so many other PKs/MKs from around the world was fascinating.

We were so poorly prepared for the world. It's a wonder we survived at all. Life sped up and got more difficult from then on.<<ref "2020.02.10-2">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.10-1" "This last move has been much, much slower. The move has been stretched out. I'm hoping we won't have to move but maybe one or two more times. I am tired of it.">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.10-2" "This has been another reason I'm glad we've homeschooled. The most important functions have stayed more constant. I don't know how poor people can afford to be parents, particularly when geographic mobility is required.">>
