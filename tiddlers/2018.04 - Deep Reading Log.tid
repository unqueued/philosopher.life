!! Audit:

* Transclusions have enabled me to see my daily work while also building larger projects. I'm very pleased to have them. 
* Some of the books took just one day, some fell out of favor, and some took quite a bit of time.
* Popular books are easy to digest quickly. I'm also less impressed by them.
* Most of my reading was spent on my books.  
* I think my wife's books are significantly easier to read than mine.
