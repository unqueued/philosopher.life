Proud dad moments.

How are you doing? l
2 HR AGO
It's pleasant when our children enjoy our preferred stories.
1 HR AGO
I hated that show. I just thought it was funny. It being an old old show and all.
1 HR AGO
(just inserting photo and gibberish to icebresk)
1 HR AGO
Nirvana. Well. Who didn't!
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
=)

How are you? Your response indicates you may be busy.
1 HR AGO
Understood if you are.
1 HR AGO
I'm doing fine. Reading and writing as usual.
1 HR AGO
Had a very lazy day yesterday. It was everything I hoped it could be.
1 HR AGO
How about you?
1 HR AGO
How's your health and work going too?
1 HR AGO
That is awesome. I have been mildly productive this weekend. My back seems to be doing great. It hurts but I'm standing upright. I have pushed it a few times with little regret.
1 HR AGO
How is the rash?
1 HR AGO
Lmao
1 HR AGO
Funny not funny
1 HR AGO
Rashes are gone for now.
1 HR AGO
Thankfully.
1 HR AGO
Sweet!

I have a big spot on shoulder we are watching. Been 3 weeks with little change. Showwd up all of a sudden.
1 HR AGO
Hoping it's just a spider bite. But could be the C word.  Making appointments to get it evaluated. Nothing to be terribly concerned with.
1 HR AGO
I can lose skin and still work on cars, trucks and helicopters
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
Dude. Can I send you some pics of the swings Samantha and I made?
1 HR AGO
Hopefully it's just a spider bite.
1 HR AGO
Of course, send me some pics.
1 HR AGO
I have a couple of short video clips. I wanted to show you too.

Sweet. I'm glad I figured that out.
1 HR AGO
Ignore the sync phone thing. It's not important
1 HR AGO
It looks like she's going to get some good use out of those gorgeous swings.
1 HR AGO
I can upload on laptop which is where I woukd normally upload larger files from.
1 HR AGO
The front yard is the chill swing and the back yard is the multi directional crazy shit swing. The front one was also made to accommodate my wife's fat ass. (by request). Lol
1 HR AGO
lol
1 HR AGO
Samantha helped with both from start to finish.
1 HR AGO
We spent all day and evening together on Friday. Momma worked then went to a bachlorette thing till like 1 am.
1 HR AGO
Sounds like time well spent. Will be a good memory for you both.
1 HR AGO
Indeed. Chinese buffet date night and all.
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
Noice.
1 HR AGO
Wife hates that place.
1 HR AGO
So we always go there when she's gone.
1 HR AGO
Well, if it's a weekend. I don't like going when they aren't busy. Not enough food turnover. You know how it goes.
1 HR AGO
Makes sense to me.
1 HR AGO
I like the big buffets with seafood.
1 HR AGO
I often skip everything but the crab legs, frog legs, and sushi.
1 HR AGO
Hard to find in my area, sadly
1 HR AGO
We love the frog legs. Somerset crab legs are usually small snow crab. And not worth the effort.
1 HR AGO
They also have crawfish. Wish I love.  You can tell they are old and they are on ice.
1 HR AGO
So I steer clear.
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
Makes sense to me.
1 HR AGO
I don't touch 'em either, and I love a good crawfish boil.
1 HR AGO
I gots a wedding to go to in a few hours. Wife has been working on decorating all morning. Then she's showering and changing now. Then she's going to do the brides hair.
1 HR AGO
The bride just finished her soft more year at Berea College.
1 HR AGO
She is my wife's best friends daughter. I actually helped schedule their fir tour/visit and went with them to help.
1 HR AGO
I got them to give us dumb stuff like free food service tickets and showed them stuff you don't normally see on the tour.
1 HR AGO
I hope the wedding is joyous and pleasant for you all.
1 HR AGO
It's a step above a funeral for me. But I'll do my best!

My wife ran camera. Fun dumb shit. We all have yoyos now and the girls are really improving their  skills. I love to do it when I'm just bullshit ting or talking on the phone, or whatever.
1 HR AGO
Got "the brain" for Samantha. So after it sleeps it will auto retract. To keep from  losing it.
