title: 2019.10.09 - Prompted Introspection: No TV

!! What would happen if there were no television? Why would this be good? bad?

If what you mean by television is a particular sort of broadcast network intended for the traditional television, and not the internet data pushed over them to computers with monitors (difficult to peel these apart these days), then I think many poor, old, and illiterate people would be scrambling to replace their sources and media drugs with the lowest hanging digital fruit. I have no idea how such a thing would be caused, but I think the consequences would be good overall. I'd predict non-trivial rises in piracy, computer usage, and curation processes.

It really depends on [[W5H]] there were no television. I'm taking up too many assumptions here.
