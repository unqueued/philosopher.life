* Confirm My Bias
** https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/18/why-smart-people-are-better-off-with-fewer-friends/
*** Although, I'm sure I'm being catered to, to some extent. Also, the article is poorly written. The argument is bad.

*** I've seen a ton of Great Depression talk in the past 2 weeks, and many were good arguments. 
*** https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V
**** Velocity of money keeps falling. Power is centralizing. Fuck. I think I'm too late. I don't know what we are going to do.
** http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.3742
*** Not surprised by this. Virtue training has to start younger. It's hard to teach the unteachable. Give them technical certification if you want. They aren't full blown citizens though. Even beyond our fundamental brokenness, they are incomplete humans, period.
** https://www.axios.com/daughters-of-wwii-refugees-are-more-likely-to-have-mental-illness-2513872556.html
*** I only have fear about my family's epigenetics.

** https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/deep_image_prior
*** Part of me still just blown away by this. It is so powerful. A lot of educated people even a decade ago would have bet against this.
** https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbz49j/new-study-finds-that-most-redditors-dont-actually-read-the-articles-they-vote-on
*** Cognitive fatigue, yes. But, in a surprising number of cases, including this article, it often doesn't matter. I also find comment sections to have valuable information, interpretations, critique, and rabbitholes.
** http://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12708.full.pdf
*** No shit, Sherlock. Academia has long been a popularity contest, and it's a hypercompetitive world.
** https://www.wsj.com/articles/finance-pros-say-youll-have-to-pry-excel-out-of-their-cold-dead-hands-1512060948
*** Um, yeah. MS owned the world for a long time, and these are powerful containers that everyone knows how to use.

*** Regulatory Capture

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://github.com/backender/filecoin-survey/releases/download/0.5/filecoin_survey.2.pdf
*** We need an IPFS, badly. Our best (not morally) and brightest (not morally) are making money, not helping humanity of the fundamental problems.
** https://twitter.com/4Dgifts/status/936223487986946048
*** Fine. I'll B-crypt.

* Think About It
** https://www.1843magazine.com/features/tabletop-generals
*** Interestingly, as I get older, I find I'm far less interested in playing games with others. It's almost never enjoyable.
** https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/28/arts/internetting-with-amanda-hess.html
*** I'm a culturalist, Redpilled Leftist, and I think she'd call me a racist. Unfortunately, I don't think she has the moral high ground here. At some point, you need to think about your Leftist priorities here. There are unfortunate power dynamics here, but you've missed the forest for the trees. This isn't a whataboutism. Bind people together by sharing material power. These memes are small potatoes.Want to limit racism? Defeat capitalism. Distribute wealth and decentralize power. It's that simple. You'll find the rest of this trivialized and even non-offensive.

*** I couldn't vote for her, but if I had to, it was going to be her.
** http://vdwaa.nl/arch/linux/reproducible/builds/security/reproducible-builds-arch/
*** The lazy part of me just doesn't care about reproducibility except in the most vital cases.
** http://www.loper-os.org/?p=1927
*** I am, of course, still interested. I think it will work for us just fine.

* Fishy
** https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/28/16709224/facebook-suicidal-thoughts-ai-help
*** Not convinced this is a good thing.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/well/family/a-healthy-dose-of-guilt.html
*** Defining empathy, and yet, I have my doubts about NYT as usual.
** https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/opinions/elite-colleges-are-making-it-easy-for-conservatives-to-dislike-them/2017/11/30/0d2ef31a-d52a-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html
*** I'm sorry when I remove clinically diagnosed psychopaths (a small range of whom I consider psychopaths; everyone is on the spectrum) and low IQ ranges from the world, Leftism becomes far more prevalent. You know this. Are you going to address that fact? I'm sure it is easy to dislike facts when they don't benefit you.
** http://time.com/5042700/inside-new-american-way-of-war/
*** Not the way I would describe it. Far too charitable.

*** You bet your ass that's a fucking sandwich. 

* Search, Curation, Wandering, and Rabbitholing:

*** New word.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory
*** Intrinsic value. Lol. They throw that around too lightly. 
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Principles
*** Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy
*** I actually think this wiki is a kind of instantiation of the Unix philosophy, to some extent. The more and more I look at it, the more I see myself as just handling text streams. It's part of [[Wiki: Other Frameworks and Paradigms to Consider]]
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore_slump
*** "earlier success has a reducing effect on the subsequent effort"

** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muntzing
*** Dat sexy minimalism
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox
*** The kinds of paradoxes I like. This one makes sense. It's an unexpected result, but later can be explained.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here
*** I have always heard corporate policies (and now individuals as well) who refuse to use FOSS. I think that is a variant of this NIH phenomenon.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment
*** A good term for it.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias
*** You see, in my redpilling and escape from depression, I feel like I'm trying to be accurate and realistic. I have to find hope, but I want to be hedged-conservative in how I grow that hope. Perhaps I am still overly pessimistic.
**** I regularly see failures in my optimism. How do I detect failures in my pessimism?
***** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy
****** My "month" of mathematics was like that. We didn't push as hard as I wanted to, and we didn't get as far as I had hoped. We did kick some serious ass though. 
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect

*** There is always something right about it, even if it is not a sufficient explanation.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boondoggle
*** Successful ones were interesting.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_(project_management)
*** Sometimes I think my children feel I'm doing this. What I must do is never criticize on such missions. I should only allow myself to praise where appropriate and continue to just offer words of encouragement otherwise.
