title: 2018.07.14 - Wiki Audit: Letters

I'm spending all of my time today responding to others.

Changed the timeline to 100. I'll need to temporarily change it for family time. I just don't want it too long. I need to find ways to make this marginally better for mobile. Perhaps I should just stick to the //Open// tab instead. This is tricky for me because I naturally want it to open a specific way for myself, but I also want it to be clear that the tabs are fundamental to how one ought to navigate this wiki in an effective manner. 

I've found a large group of people I need to reach out to. Many letters need to be made and sent. It feels pretty piled on, but that's okay. It's interesting to see the [[Find The Others]] thing come alive. So much work is going into it that I should really make that look good.
