//ð“‚¸ Step aside, antidisestablishmentarianism, madcap P45<<ref "b">> is here. ð“‚¸//

It is said all words are constructed. They are symbols, signs, and syntactic vessels which activate semantic models (but of what and for what?) in our minds. It appears the literal denotation and facetious connotation of this word point in different directions. It is a toyword of beautiful irony.

!! Denotation:

Silicosis is a form of occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust, and is marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. It is a type of pneumoconiosis. 

* Pneumono := refers to lungs or air
* Ultra := above, beyond
* Micro := small
* Scop := view
* Silic := element silicon
* Volcan := volcano
* Coni := dust
* Osis := disease

!! Connotation:

Let us deliberately make language prolix, esoteric, complexophilic, cathexistic, or obscure [[irwartfrr]], even if only just for funsies.<<ref "t">> The word makes me feel [[YSB]] about it. I am pointed to the limits of language and science with this word. I feel strongly about it. It has a surreal [[gfwiwcgws]], and it makes me feel like a kid.
