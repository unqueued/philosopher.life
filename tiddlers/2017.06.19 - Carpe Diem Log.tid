title: 2017.06.19 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up early, but no fireman time. Instead, I did a small workout this morning. I've been doing that and forgetting to write about it. It ain't much, but it gets me moving. A small sweat is good.
* I worked very hard today. 
* I talked a bit with my family over lunch. They weren't very talkative.
* I worked hard, took my test, and rejoiced inside (even pumped my fist) to hear that I got a reasonable score. 
* My visit to Kingsport was quite disappointing. I will not give up. I will keep knocking on those doors. I deserve to be hired because I rock. They have no idea what they are missing out on.<<ref "1">>
* When I got home I talked with the kids, surfed for a bit, and then took a nap.
* My nap was longer than I expected! Maybe I shouldn't take naps. They are delicious though. 
* I played a game of League. Had a diamond player in my group today. 
* We made dinner, brats, veggies, and it was delicious!
* I tried calling both my brothers today. I did get to talk to my brother JRE. 
** Don't forget to look at computer parts for him
* MB said she would call me back today, but she didn't. 
* JOP called. We talked. =) It's nice to hear from her. I worry we don't have much to say.
* I did the dishes by hand with my daughter since my son didn't run the washer.
* I got my kids to work on their logs, and I did my 30-minute pact with my wife. 
** I got a script working to make [[Wiki Review Log]] much easier and organized {Projects}.
* I'm going to have some sorbet, water, and watch some league while building a comp for my brother.
