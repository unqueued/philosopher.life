title: School Shop Tool Fabrication

* Hooked Connecting "Fit-up" "Alignment Pin" Bar with Chisel on the other end. 
** Likely heavy welding. Needs to be sharp and strong.
** Consider making a straight one first. Two wouldn't hurt.
* Wedge to hammer with.
** Definitely welded at least on the the tip and end.
** I say we use a thin plate in the middle as a base, and we drop huge rods on it. 
* Centerline drawing "el" ruler for fabricating
* Centering head with "table" on top for my level and a hole for a pin to drop down.
** Need to make a punch "pin" for the hole. 
*** Put lugs on top and bottom to keep it in

For Fun:

* Hatchet
* Knife
