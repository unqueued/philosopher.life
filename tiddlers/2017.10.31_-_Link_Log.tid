*** It's time to start offering public-key cryptography verification on everything. It's dirt-fucking cheap. It's so easy. Why do people not do this? It costs almost nothing, and it buys so much! 
**** Counterfeiting can be stopped or at least greatly hindered. It's easy to prove who has the keys. Why has this not disseminated throughout the world?
**** It seems to me that I have an idea here that others do not. They do not understand all the uses of this technology. This is nothing special at all. It can be incorporated into almost anything with very little work. I could make money off it...I'd need to sell it. It would be useful if I had a framework that was drop-in easy. Golang is fast, produces executables that run everywhere...

*** Day traders, prepare to get #rekt. 
*** Futures in cash? uhhh...sign me up. Watch this volatile market:
**** Build a Ponzi (escrow, whatever), siphon it anonymously into cash, and short that coin. Ponzi is revealed, boomshakalaka. Cash-money.
***** Similarly, any major hack or drop in perceived stability or value will cause that crash. Bet against it, and you rock.
***** Extra points, after it crashes, you buy it again because you know it's going back up. Lol.
