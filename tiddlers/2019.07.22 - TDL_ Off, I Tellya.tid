* Write yo' ass off.
* Finish the application, my dude.
* Continue working with the offspring to get them back in the groove.
** Seems like a solid start so far. We've been super grindy today.
* Unless all the parts show up early tomorrow, just wait until the next day, eh?
* Leftovers may work, otherwise we'll figure something else out. 
** Salad would be nice.

** Further, make sure you are at least 103Â°F pregnart before you head to the hospital.
