How was your weekend?

Thank you.
SEP 30 10:40 AM
You too! =)
SEP 30 10:40 AM
We had a small party, and I got smashed. That was nice.
SEP 30 10:40 AM
Some cleaning, lots of WoW. Car had trouble starting for my wife, so that is disconcerting.
SEP 30 10:41 AM
Grateful for my weekend.
SEP 30 10:41 AM
How about you?
SEP 30 10:41 AM
That all sounds great!

Had my bro and his family visit. Played some dnd. It was fun. :) we just relaxed yesterday. I realized that I was super far ahead in my homework so I took it easy.
SEP 30 10:48 AM
That is the best kind of realization. Like finding spare money in your pockets.

It seems to me you may be seeing your brothers more often this year than last, or that's the way it feels (aint got no numbers to crunch). Pretty awesome.
SEP 30 10:52 AM
Lol. Itâ€™s pretty good!
SEP 30 10:52 AM
Iâ€™m trying. One of my brothers got a new GF and moved away. Chase is still floundering somewhere in Louisville. Iâ€™m not sure how heâ€™s doing or where exactly he is.
SEP 30 10:53 AM
I know that feeling.
SEP 30 10:54 AM
Yeah it sucks. But Iâ€™m just gonna keep trudging along.
SEP 30 10:56 AM
Howâ€™s work going?
SEP 30 10:56 AM
You should definitely read about it! I won't be able to condense it nicely. It's going well. I thought I might be reaching the end (since I'm subversive when it comes to providing my children access to whatever information they seek), but that worry is gone for now. I feed children, do one-on-ones everyday with every child, get homework done, push reading and computing, and engage in dialectics with those who have interest in real talk. I'm often handling the work of 3 people, getting paid a third of what one person should make. 
SEP 30 11:01 AM
Are your classes going well?
SEP 30 11:01 AM
Teachers need a significant pay raise.  Iâ€™ll make time to read about it this week. :)
SEP 30 11:02 AM
I think so?
SEP 30 11:02 AM
You are ahead on homework, so that's a plus.
SEP 30 11:02 AM
I have...... one attendance grade posted across four classes.
SEP 30 11:02 AM
Yeah haha

It is going well. Hard to believe the end of the year is approaching.

How's your day? How's class?
OCT 1 6:11 PM
It was a good day. Class is fun. I wish I had more grades though. Haha
OCT 1 9:07 PM
Interesting, why?

Itâ€™s hard to know where I stand. ðŸ˜‚ I have ONE grade across four classes
