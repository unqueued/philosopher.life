Who?

Me.

Makes sense...epilepsy?

That is a missing piece, but it has a relationship with autism. My right temporopariatal junction is atypical.

Seizures would suck

How are you with this?
OCT 5 12:36 PM
I need to research it more. It is better to know than not to know. It is important for me to be able to mitigate the negative aspects, to maintain my functionality, and to be useful to others. 
OCT 5 12:38 PM
I need to find a specialist to speak with. 
OCT 5 12:38 PM
Yes that would be a great idea

I don't see answers for Geschwind syndrome yet.

There are a lot people who do not think it's a credible neurological disorder. It feels like registering as an INTJ on the MBTI, wherein I know it's me, but there may not be a sufficient scientific basis for it. The features fit though.
