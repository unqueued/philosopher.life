title: 2018.08.05 - JRE: December

My brother had a meeting with the social worker yesterday. Raylan may be staying with them through Thanksgiving or X-mas. This may be code for even longer. My brother, of course, is exhausted, and the disconnection issue is very difficult. I think he feels trapped between two worlds. 

In anycase, I think he at least now has more time to transition, to reason about what matters to him, and to take whatever steps will lead to his ends. I will try to listen carefully.

My brother talked to Raylan about what I looked like. I always get a kick out of it from my brother. 

We talked about shitting while laying down, bedsheets, and other fun things. He always gets me to laugh. Huh...especially when he isn't feeling so depressed? He is going to the doctor for anxiety meds. I hope that will help. He is scheduling his surgery soon, I hope. He has lots of health problems, which is increasingly common among our generation. I am worried about my brother.

We talked about the resilio sync key I sent. He said he'll contact L soon about the game.
