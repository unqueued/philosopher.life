title: 2019.11.28 - Prompted Introspection: Make A TV Commercial

!! What kind of t.v. commercial would you like to make? Describe it.

Wow, [[RPIN]] shows up: [[2017.06.15 - Prompted Introspection Log]]. It's such a painful evaluation. I'd rather not have to engage in rhetoric. I'd rather not hvae to compress it into some tiny emotional envelope. I'd rather not advterise something so widely without backing it up as radically as I can. Please, don't make me make a TV commercial. 

I would make a TV commercial against allowing TV commercials. Done.
