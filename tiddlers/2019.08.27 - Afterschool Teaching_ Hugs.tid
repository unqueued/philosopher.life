title: 2019.08.27 - Afterschool Teaching: Hugs

Whitney gave me the line "I'm not racist, but..." which is generally a redflag. I have, of course, seen this line used correctly, but it has all the hallmarks of one who must preface their sentence with "TBH" and so forth. She turned down a random nervous stranger who asked her out because was pretty. She strove for reasons to justify it, some much better than others (I walked with her through them). Do I think the odds of the guy getting the date would have been higher if he was white? Yup. Do I think she would have turned down most guys in this case? Yes. She only has eyes for Stephen Curry.

Today has been like lightning, so perhaps I'm in a rhythm, my fastmind is not surprised, and there is habitualized inclination at work. Prep, paperwork, and my opener. 

I ask my usual questions, the sort I ask my offspring, and I'm hunting for anything which seems off to me. 5Dm has me worried; the boy has strong feelings which overtake him. It's the kind of sensitivity which demonstrates intelligence and ridiculously high expectations, and he is overwhelmed. 

I'm handing out magic cards as bookmarks. =)

5TB and I are butting heads. I'm Mr. Gandalf (:P). He really doesn't like when I hold him accountable. He's a low IQ psychopath in the making here. I see it clearly in his father. =/

The library was solid. I'm still herding cats. 5CMf wants to play, and I told her I was writing down that she has first game with me tomorrow. 

7DM can't read very well, and he's feeling the pressure in MTG. I'm doing my best to convince him that he needs to focus on it. I know it must be hard on him. 

I wish I had more time with my children. I keep trying to superseed the torrent of information one must have to even begin learning to play magic. I hope the swarm grows, but I assume it will peter out. It hurts me inside to watch 6BG bend a $300 card, break sleeves, and mix my decks. Ugh. Perhaps I should just proxy for them.

I handed 8Jm my keys and asked him to lead the class. I mouthed thank you later, and he gave me a thumbs up. That's the route I need to go with him.

The lab was a madhouse with 40, but when the kids who don't want to be there head to the gym it's wonderful (I have no idea what the hell Whitney is doing). 

5AN thinks she is going to get in trouble with me for posting on forums. You go, girl. She causes me to imitate and mirror her attitudes back to her. Our interactions make more sense when I do. 

My wiki crew were required to write journals today. 5AO may be out. I get it. The interwebs is way too much fun. My older boys seem to be more into it, and it's not like pulling teeth at all. I give them direction, some intuition, and they are off to the races. I'm asking them to put in some time on the wiki before they play. 

7L is converting his school notes verbatim into the wiki. His brother is more interested in journaling and mapping. We talked about naming conventions and search again. We're going to make a mess and clean it up. I'm hoping tagging will be more natural to them than it is for me. They asked me how I use mine (I had them glance at it). Hopefully, they'll find some ideas to run with.

8Nf hasn't brought her thumbdrive, nor did 5Sm. =/ 

Students are asking me about music vidyas. I know nothing, and it's refreshing to have them walk me through it. My namesake said she's not allowed to watch at home what she's watching here. Good for you, kid. Do it. Don't fucking take that censorship. Yes, it might be garbage (lawd, it is), but get up in thar. Break some rules in exploration here. Go on, do your dance and what not. 

Trap music, Cardi B, and Michael Jackson. It's a solid mix. We have a lot of jigs, shimmies, singalongs, and dances at the house when we aren't working too hard. I love the lab.

So far, the adults seem to be steering clear of the lab (preferring to call down over the intercom). Perhaps that will change. They won't address my failure to comply. I'm just, like, so inept, disorganized, and unable to figure out how these confounded machines and rules work; I guess the kids are going to help this old fool figure it out. Same problem with swearing and setting traps for my especially problematic kids; I'm a limp, blind noodle. Give me the opening in conversation (had a small one with Whitney today; she still isn't getting just how bad the home lives are for some of our children), and I'll show you why I'm right.

I keep having to call 8Am down, but he's cordial with me. I have several students who seem to signal they care about me in reciprocation. I think they are being polite usually.

My namesake hugged me, so I bear hugged her back. She's not feeling well. Sounds awful. When she gets sick, it's never half-assed. I'm asking her to get some more sleep.

8Jm and I talked at the end. Whoever was picking up tonight was late again. Delp annoys me in how he says he's going to take money from the kids for each minute (though I tend to let go early, so I'm not paying the price; though Delp is paid $22 an hour), though 8Jm fights back with "but that's our rent money" line. We talked about choir. He doesn't want to sing unless he can use his diva drama queen singing style (and that's why he quit last year). He doesn't want to listen to his teachers or follow other styles. I hear ya, kid. We talked about what it meant to become virtuous at a practice, and I'm encouraging him to take the audition seriously, to be respectful, and to be open-minded. We talked about his regimen and practice habits too.
