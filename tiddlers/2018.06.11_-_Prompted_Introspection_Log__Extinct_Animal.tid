title: 2018.06.11 - Prompted Introspection Log: Extinct Animal

!! What extinct animal would you bring back, if you could?

It depends on how you define species, but it may easily be the case that 99% of animals have gone extinct over the course of our planet's lifetime. It's quite possible there are animals elsewhere in the history of the universe too. What does any particular one matter? Insofar as they are Daseinic, I'll bring those back (assuming they'd want it)? Insofar as a species might maximize utility, I might bring those back. I don't know enough to answer the question better than those two possible answers.
