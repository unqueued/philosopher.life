I am sorry I became irrationally upset with you over your temporarily lost phone. You are 9 years old. I forget that fact too often. You are responsible for your age. In particular, I'm sorry about having said I'm tired of your excuses for not having your phone. It wasn't a wise or kind thing to say. I am sorry for making you feel unworthy.
