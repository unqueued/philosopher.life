--PURPOSE OF THIS... THING--
This is a direct sequel to the original Game Premise document. The intent with this one is to flesh out the world a bit for you in hopes to help you understand your immediate
surroundings. Anything I type here is something your character could or likely would know (unless they were born yesterday... in which case please ignore this document.) 

I've divided the document into chunks a bit based on your character's background. I suppose you are truly welcome to read it all (perhaps you read about this realm in a book
somewhere), but I would encourage you to read only what you believe truly fits your character's knowledge limits. I won't punish you in any way for reading all of what's here,
but it does make it more fun to leave things unknown sometimes.


--AIMSER--

This is the continent on which you are currently standing. Pronounced by squishing the words "aim" and "sir" together. Easy enough I hope.

Something to note about this continent is that the people here generally see magic as wild and untamed. Many fear it, and some countries have a ban on magics altogether.


--IBERIM--

As I said before, Iberim (pronounced IH-bur-ihm) is the continent in which your character now resides. How you got there is beyond me at this point, but you are most 
certainly there now. Congratulations!

=Everyone Knows=
Your character would have seen upon entering, that this country is comprised mostly of lush, green forests teeming with all sorts of life. It is clear that the flora and 
fauna here have been blessed in some manner or another with magic. Those who can sense magic feel a faint tingle of it in the air all around them (but not to the point of 
blocking other more powerful sources of magic). There is no telling what manner of beast lives within these forests. Legends of the area say that some travelers have ventured
into the great forest only to never be seen again. Others tell of a mystical land hidden deep in the heart of the forest full of fairies and unicorns. You have no clue if any of it
of it is true, but it most certainly could be. My advice to you: if you see any floating, disembodied lights during your adventures, you best ignore them.

It's worth noting that the people here have vastly different views on magic. Those from the smaller towns and villages don't seem to mind it all that much, but those in the 
larger cities seem to view it as taboo or even evil... best keep your spellbook out of sight.

=Locally Born or Well Read Knows=
You once know a guy who had a cousin that got lost in the woods of Iberim and never came back. Pretty sure the poor bloke got eaten by a bear.

Anyways. Natural-born Iberimians (yeesh.. try saying that five times fast) have an appreciation for the natural magic that glitters around them. Wild and free, this magic
has been known to cause all manner of mystical things to occur (whether good or bad) and has been the object of worship for hundreds of years. For the most part the nation has
had a history of peace. This is largely due to the various people groups keeping to themselves. Wood elves don't venture out of their forest homes much, and humans tend to
keep to their towns and villages. Any fighting that did occur was generally a small territory squabble.

If you were raised in any form of society and/or are old enough to know better, you also know that there is a significant rift between those natural-born Iberimians
and the local aristocracy. In the past hundred years or so, aristocrats from a neighboring country decided that Iberim was a lovely wild place that needed "help" making itself 
more civilized. This help came in the form of semi-hostile takeovers and established rule. The natural rift between the aristocrats and Iberimians grew as the nobles began to
repress the locals' worship of magic and taught them that it was "evil" and "untamable". Though this rule extended its reach to most civilization in the area, Iberim is still
a very wild nation. Some smaller villages and towns have escaped the land's authority merely by accident, but they are all certainly aware of the laws.

To the locals' delight, the current king has just recently passed a law establishing that magic is no longer illegal. Unfortunately, many in the capital and other densley
populated areas still view it as taboo. An unspoken tension now hangs between Iberimians and their foreign authority.
