title: 2018.07.04 - Deep Reading: Demon Vol 2

Calvin and Hobbes meets MacGuyver. 

This guy has spent a non-trivial amount of time on 4chan. =) /wave

The ontology of Demonhood is explained. It's cute.

The daughter angle comes into full view.

The struggle with the agent is completely forced. This book, however, is far more inventive and interesting than the first.
