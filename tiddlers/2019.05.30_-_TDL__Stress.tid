title: 2019.05.30 - TDL: Stress

* Keep vigilant about your twig and berries, sir. Your left elbow pit is feeling it too. You are still stressed. It's okay that you are a bit crazy, that's like, totally normally and stuff. 
* The door has to be hit from both ends. It needs to dry more. One of the holes is completed. You'll also need to do a finish, and then you'll need to paint (have your daughter help you match the paint).
* You need to walk. Duh Doy.
* Your wife is going to be exhausted. Catch her.
* Also, you've been keeping the downstairs fairly clean. I like  your clever laundry hack. 
** The cats are appreciative too. Ranga is spending more time with you. Also, he likes the kitty crack catnip sprankles on his cardboard bed; it doesn't look like you overdid it either (or he wouldn't stay there, right?).
