!! About:

//Sharpen your blades and commit yourself.//

My cup runneth over, I assent to and concur with your preaching, my rage knows no bounds, or someone ~~on the internet~~ in [[The Great Human Conversation]] is wrong.<<ref "g">> Therefore, I must empty myself [[irwartfrr]] into this flavorful log for the sake of the wiki. 

Spoutin' off in [[Prompted Introspection]] has taught me many lessons about myself and how to reason about my [[4DID]] representation in this wiki. While [[Leet]] and necessary, unfortunately, that log's questions are too fucking vanilla to sufficiently achieve the crucial scaffolding construction and horcrux-pensieve practices of pulling myself into the wiki. I need to rapidly wrestle with fit [[Diamonds]] and [[Redpills]] to extrema. I must tango with [[antipleonasms]] and continue the construction of the [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]]. I will be violent and often mistaken in here; this is the Darwinian hypercompetitive zerosum dialectical gladiator pit. `/roar`

Unlike [[Prompted Introspection]], which removes my autonomy in topic selection, this log will enable me to pick out what matters to me in the moment. This is a different method for extracting my bias. Instead of facing whitebread vanilla blah, this pulsating project is meant to have me dive into curry, mole, essential extractions, fresh coffee, vegemite, bourbon neat, 90% dark chocolate, vinegar, and ต้มยำกุ้ง. Where is the salty [[salience]]? `/summon`

Take me to the limit.

!! Principles:

* Wra'stle and wrangle them [[antipleonasms]]. Wisely blow shit up.
* Be flexible, voracious, and hunt for something that strikes you as [[salient]].
* Incubate and curate feeder lists like [[Generic Prompts]], otherwise use [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]].
* Tangent and speak gibberish if you must. It is difficult to be articulate enough about these crystalline memes.
