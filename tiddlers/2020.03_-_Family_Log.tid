!! Audit:

* [[TTP]]s have been a recent addition
** We've not done a great job, but I think we will continue to climb this mountain together.
** Due to handling [[TTP]] in here, this log has distorted [[Family Time]] more than usual.
* Our socializing hasn't shrunk too much with the quarantine, but we don't get to meet many angels.
** I'm still failing to encourage my daughter effectively enough to build her social circles.
* I've allowed a broken log here. It was late, and we got most of it. We were tired.
* I think my son has been more proud of himself, but it's also clearly been a touch month for him.
** Yeah, he should be proud.
* I'm my family's computer.
