title: 2019.09.11 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Occupation

!! What is your favorite occupation?

Teaching. Being philosophical with others. Getting paid to engage in dialectics. It's not merely an occupation when I can do it, it's my vocation. I hold the transfer and generation of [[salient]] knowledge, including the ability to critically reason and discover it, in the highest regard. Of course, I'm not a good teacher, and who wants to listen to this guy? Lol. It's something awful to be nearly useless at your vocation.
