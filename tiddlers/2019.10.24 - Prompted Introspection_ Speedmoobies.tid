!! If you could participate in an Olympic event, which one would you choose and why?

My answer in [[2018.04.11 - Prompted Introspection Log: Olympics]] is brilliant. Alright, so assuming no hawties are going anywhere near this ugly sumbitch, I'd aim for something else super humiliating. Marathons are probably the best method. I'll be hours behind these people. My legs are muscular, but my barrel-chest is a perfect support structure for my moobs. The amount of bouncing would be epic.
