```
How's it going?
TUE 4:24 PM
Not too shabby. We’re going to have the crumbling group over today so we’ll see how that goes... >_>
TUE 4:24 PM
We’re all going to play the new Smash Bros \o/
TUE 4:24 PM
Awesome. =)
TUE 4:24 PM
How many folks in the crumbling group?
TUE 4:25 PM
[[K]] and I have already played the hell out of it. It’s so much fun.
TUE 4:25 PM
Well, I hope you whoop some ass.
TUE 4:25 PM
I will probably get my ass whooped instead, but that’s okay. I don’t play competitively here, just like goofing off.
TUE 4:25 PM
I haven’t heard about it yet: how’s your new job?
TUE 5:09 PM
Training and snowdays thus far. Had one day with the kids.

I need more hands on experience to develop my gameplan. These are not my children, so I don't get get to make my usual assumptions of shared knowledge, vocabulary, and practice.
TUE 5:24 PM
Right!
TUE 5:27 PM
The fun part about kids is if you listen they will usually tell you everything you need to know.
TUE 5:27 PM
That is not my experience.
TUE 5:28 PM
But, I may not be good at listening.
TUE 5:28 PM
It is difficult because they don't know what they don't know. They don't even know that they don't know that they don't know.
TUE 5:28 PM
Hmm... I guess sometimes it takes a bit for them to grow comfortable with you. I think they will appreciate you treating them with respect though, as you’re always good about.
TUE 5:28 PM
(if there was a way to say that sentence more gracefully, I'd say it)
TUE 5:29 PM
lol, I get your meaning though
TUE 5:30 PM
