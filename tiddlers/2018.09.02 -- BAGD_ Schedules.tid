title: 2018.09.02 -- BAGD: Schedules

We're at it again, Pinky. The month long unschooling test gave us our results. We will try again sometime. I cannot hand your autonomy over to you without evidence that you've already taken it up, that you are being Reasonable of your own Reason. This process is an iterative growth of your autonomy. We are engaged in a kind of scientific method.

You are taking notes right now, right?

There's a richness to our tutorial dialectic Socratic method. Let's use it!

I'm looking for you to turn up your effort to 80% and leave it there. Have room to turn it up to 11 when you really need it, but you need to build spaces where you chill.

my empirical measurement of how you try has to be based on something tangible. I need results; actions speak louder than words, although words are absolutely necessary (even if they are insufficient).

I need a pause button for my sound for you.
