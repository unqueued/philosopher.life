When should you hear by?
OCT 24 1:18 AM
Hopefully in the next week or so, but they've been slower than they've stated they would be for most of the process.
OCT 24 11:44 AM
Maybe that's a good sign, that they're at the later rounds of selection
OCT 25 3:09 AM
Aye. It's the final round. They already flew everyone (3 candidates) up.
OCT 25 7:42 AM
They got to dip into some ridiculous fund for it. They picked her up in a limo, lol.
OCT 25 7:42 AM
Last pick will just require letters from current employer to check for redflags, and that's it.
