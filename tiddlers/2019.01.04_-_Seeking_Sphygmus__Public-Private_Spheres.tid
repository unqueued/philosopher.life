title: 2019.01.04 - Seeking Sphygmus: Public-Private Spheres

[[Sphygmus]] is developing the what I take to be the fitting private/public wiki [[RGM]]. If TW ever takes off, I believe her model (stacked on Bob) will be the basis of how other people construct wikis. 

This isn't the direction I am going, but I kind of have two things like it. Olvoldy and [[/b/]] perform similar functions (though ultimately never the same). I could [[/b/]] everything and then drop them into place and "undraft" them. I'm still not understanding it well enough.

I'm often left a bit sad and curious with where the links trail off. Lol! This thing exists: you may not read it!

It's cool to see TCG notes. I wonder the degree to which Sphygmus seeks narrative in her games (be they in the game's lore or arising from the mechanics). The //curiosity cabinet// is fun.

//hyper/trails// is telic and project-oriented so far. I'll be interested to see how it plays out. Those are often the kinds of work that spawn into their own projects for me. This is a fun place. I've already found a link that will be going in my [[Link Log]] too. =)
