title: 2018.12.30 - Prompted Introspection: Why My Best Friend

!! Why is your best friend your best friend?

My wife is my best friend. We've been married for almost 14 years now. That is almost half my lifetime, and if you talk about persistent memory (which may be crucial to how I tell myself the stories of myself), then it's probably half (even if phenomenologically, time appears to speed up increasingly as we age). 

From a [[redpill]]ed perspective, we have invested deeply into each other. Even with this wiki, there will never be another human who can understand me as effectively as she can (only part of that is up to me too). Obviously, I'm not saying I would want that either. I'm incredibly lucky to be able to reap what I sow here. I know a lot of people thought I was crazy for getting married at 19, and they have no idea what they are talking about. I have plenty of regrets, but I've also made some incredibly wise and awesome decisions too. Marrying [[k0sh3k]] has been like winning the lottery for me; she fucking gets it (even in fundamental disagreement).

It's been interesting to see how our lives and marriage have changed over the past 14 years. We are different people in important ways, and in some ways we've grown closer and others apart. It has been a powerful experience to see how one {[[axiom]]} difference has led to us trying to radically branch into each other, latching onto the {[[axioms]]} we do hold in common to hold onto each other for dear existential life. Oh, I thought I knew what love was like when we were compatible all the way down. No, dear me, I have not understood love until we were radically incompatible deep down at that level; the response has been overwhelming. We spiral around each other in dialectic; we sacrificially construct together. I do not even know how to describe it.
