!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
If any of you have ever looked at your FBI file, you discover that intelligence agencies in general are extremely incompetent. That's one of the reasons why there are so many intelligence failures. They just never get anything straight, for all kinds of reasons. Part of it is because of the information they get. The information they get comes from ideological fanatics, typically, who always misunderstand things in their own crazy way. If you look at an FBI file, say, about yourself, where you know what the facts are, you'll see that the information has some kind of relation to the facts, you can figure out what they're talking about, but by the time it works its way through the ideological fanaticism of the intelligence agencies, there's always weird distortion.

Yeah, I'm glad he doesn't trust intelligence agencies, and I agree they have a history of incompetence and evil. I'm disgusted by the friends I've known who have gone to work in that industry.<<ref "e">> I deny they get nothing straight. The NSA is far more adept, and he should know better. He should also recognize how this work is being privatized. This is a hole in his game.

Let me offer a counterpoint: they are getting much better at building dossiers on all of us. Look through the history of that machine, and you'll see it continues to tighten its grip. The distortion may always be there, but the truth isn't what matters. ML is coming for us. [[Saint Chomsky]] is brilliant in so many ways, but a man who literally just made his first powerpoint four days ago is in no position to conceive of the technical complexities and powers of surveillance devouring us all. I shall unrecognizably carry your torch like a retarded jester, sir.
