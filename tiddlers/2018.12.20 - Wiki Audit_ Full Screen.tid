title: 2018.12.20 - Wiki Audit: Full Screen

With Bob's multi-tab superpower, I have stopped going full-screen. This feels like a huge change to me. Normally, I have this distraction-free environment that is hyper-{[[Focus]]}ed. I lose ~12% of the top portion of my screen, and it's noisy up there. 

Currently, the "Wiki" workspace from top to bottom:

# i3 status bar
# i3 tabbed windows bar
# FF tabs
# FF omnibar, buttons, addons
# FF bookmark bar
# Le Wiki

I'm pretty sure I need to download enough malware toolbars to bring that tree of toolbars down to at least halfway down on my screen. =) 

I need to think about whether or not this is interrupting my flowstate too much. I really fucking hate the F11 fullscreen because it does that jump thing. Autists don't like surprises! I'm so lazy:

What I prefer about the F11 action is that I can rotate between tabs without having to constantly turn full screen on. Once ~~saved~~ full-screened, always ~~saved~~ full-screened. Alright, maybe I'll make this modification.

I am annoyed by that lack of solid search and replace features in TW. This is fucking insane. I cannot manage my text in an easy programmatic manner. For example, I want to tag those [[Prompted Introspection]]s containing:

`!! Respond to the following:`

with [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]. 

I would much rather this tooling exist in the Wiki. I can do this somewhat easier in singlefile mode. I suppose the halfway measure here is xonshically answering this problem. We will get to that tooling. The ability to continue programmatically shaping this document with ease is something I must cultivate again and again.

It's not resilio sync! The race-condition/reversion just happened again. Ugh, the only options left are either the minutely script (I do not understand why that would be a problem) or Bob itself. I need to test (maybe rsync and then node build from the rsynced directory; I could also try and just time it by hand...if I come to Jed with this claim, I need to make sure I'm correct). Otherwise, this is a problem with Bob itself. I really need the race conditions to go away desperately. I need to test this, ugh. =( This a gamebreaking problem still.

[[The Remodeling]] has hit the origins of [[Wiki Audit]]. It's a wild fucking ride! Again and again I have not understood what I am doing. I cannot give up, of course. Even when I stand in awe of this absurdly ambitious project, sometimes I become metaphorically dizzy. I believe most people would think what I'm doing here is insane. I <3 you too, folks. =)

In a weird way, this [[remodeling]] has become a sort of harvest to me. I put in so much fucking work into this wiki, and I'm now piecing it together into a more coherent whole. It's like I pushed out a bunch of brix (need le TP for muh bunghole), I've done the [[/b/]]ish thing that picked through them for the [[diamonds]] and [[redpills]] (including emergences), and built more beautiful structure out of it. It is moving to see the fruit of my labor; this really is my life. I'm reapin' it.

More Tiddlytool shaping. I still have dots to connect. I'm pleased to be bruteforce traversing my wiki. I would miss many of these things. ''I had another fuckup. Please write it down!''

My [[Log Audit]]s are partially inaccurate now that I'm tagging older material. It seems like these audits will need to be modified to include the others. Firmcoding and footnotes should get me there, I think.

It's odd that I've not had anything I felt should be [[Wiki Audit: Purged]]. Am I not being consistent here?

I had a massive crash. I lost ~250 tiddlers worth in [[Recent]]. I had the savetrail, thankfully. Bob, clearly, was fucking up for quite a while too; none of the singlefiles were even close. I couldn't import them all at once in FF, but it works in Chromium (haven't had a reversion yet either). And, as I inevitably find after using FF for a while, Chromium comes back to being the most performant browser. I've set it to be my browser for editing the wiki, but I'm keeping my identities on FF.

Something else is wrong though. Check orphans, there are a ton `/home/h0p3/syncs/bob/Wikis/tiddlers` which went fucking crazy (IIRC, I attempted to tag these when it crashed). Welp, I set aside a copy of the daily backup of the tids. This would be a fine thing to programmatically solve. It turns out that I have the 0 byte .tids sitting in last modified. Maybe this will be [[1uxb0x]]'s first real assignment in python or bash? I don't know.

This is a lossy enterprise, and I'm grateful to have the backups. I'm plumb skeered to use TiddlerTools now though, and I don't see a replacement. That will make [[The Remodeling]] considerably worse.
