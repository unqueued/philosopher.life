[5:14 PM] Ardent_Assailant: How's your weekend going?
[5:15 PM] h0p3: It's going well. Met a fascinating mathematician/philosopher who doesn't like many people. I'm going to get along just fine with her, I hope.
[5:15 PM] h0p3: Family Time is going smoothly. Going through our TTPs, trying to plan.
[5:15 PM] h0p3: Thinking about continued prepping. =/
[5:16 PM] h0p3: How about you?
[6:12 PM] Ardent_Assailant: She sounds wonderful haha
[6:12 PM] Ardent_Assailant: We are good. I ran some dailies on XIV with [[AA]]. Got to tell a tank to relax when she was struggling. She appreciated it.

[11:53 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Hey. How are you today?
[12:50 PM] h0p3: Yo! :slight_smile:
[12:51 PM] h0p3: I'm doing alright. The day is underway. Ready to jump into philosophical analysis with my offspring here soon. That's exciting.
[12:51 PM] h0p3: I have far too much to write, a whirlwind of projects, but it's okay. I'm enjoying it.
[12:51 PM] h0p3: How about you?
[12:52 PM] Ardent_Assailant: The daily grind continues on.
[12:52 PM] h0p3: Yes, sir. :slight_smile:
[12:52 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’m struggling actually. Having a major dissociative episode that started Friday evening. I kinda feel like I did when I was still on the antidepressant to an extent.
[12:53 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It came to a head last night combined with major insomnia. I’m running on about four hours right now haha
[12:54 PM] h0p3: Life is so hard without sleep.
[12:55 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’m not sure what’s wrong. I’m creeping up on week 6 after quitting Zoloft and I feel like I’m relapsing into the first few days again.
[12:56 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It sucks but [[L]] is understanding and doing whatever she can to help.
[12:57 PM] h0p3: Two steps forward, one step back. We would be lost without our spouses.
[12:57 PM] h0p3: Keep journaling about it.
[12:59 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Can do. I had a really solid week 5 of feeling like I was finally done with all the insane side effects.
[12:59 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Anyway. All of my coworkers work from home now too so I’m the sole representative of tech services atm haha
[1:00 PM] h0p3: Lol!
[1:00 PM] h0p3: It's a fascinating time we live in.
[1:00 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It’s amusing. I’m supposedly not allowed to be here if the department is empty but if they keep letting me in I’ll keep working.
[1:01 PM] Ardent_Assailant: My old supervisor decided to come down and keep me company too.
[1:06 PM] h0p3: That is a blessing.
[1:07 PM] h0p3: It's nice to have some stability, familiarity, and something productive to do in these uncertain and (for me) terrifying times.
