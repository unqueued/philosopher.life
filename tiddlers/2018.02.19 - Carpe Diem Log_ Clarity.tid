title: 2018.02.19 - Carpe Diem Log: Clarity

* Woke at 8:45

* Checked on kids.
** Pleased to see my daughter actually writing. She was pumping it out.
** My son came downstairs to work with us. I'm glad
* Talked with my wife. She was angry about a co-worker (for good reason)
* Worked hard on //Employment Log//
* Talked to [[Charlie]] for 1.5 hours
** He's a socialist, but he doesn't know the terms for it.
