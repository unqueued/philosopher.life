unfortunatly a stomach bug went through the kids. at least a half dozen got sick. but they all pulled through. i was a very proud dad. even though my kiddo puked. she said she felt better and got on stage and did her solos. she said she wasnt gonna dance. didnt want to shake it up... lol. cant blame her!

even one of the older teenagers who had a lead role had a puke bucket just off stage and had to use it during the performance.

We're doing well. Had a migraine yesterday, but it wasn't a terrible day (surprising to me). As always, my best explanation is wikified.

Today we have our family time. It usually takes us several hours to reflect on the week and plan for the next one.
