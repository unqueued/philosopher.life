title: 2018.04.16 - Computer Musings: Beaker

I have always loved the idea. Definitely macOS centric. I'm sorry, but this seems like just another doomed project for me. I've tried dozens of such tools at this point, and I profoundly agree with the decentralized notion they are pushing for. How do you convince people they must decentralize, that they have to push and sacrifice for it? Beaker is not even remotely ready for primetime (and I say that as a dreamer who has no better option). I'm not even going to host on it.
