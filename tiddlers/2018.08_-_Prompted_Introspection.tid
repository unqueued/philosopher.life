!! Audit:

* Short answers this month.
* I think I found a lot of the questions dumb. Even when they weren't dumb, I found many of the questions impossible to answer in a way that would be generally satisfactory to most people. /shrug, I guess I will need to seek my own approval more.
* I really did just "want to get it over with" too often.
* Admittedly, there are some good unintuitive answers in some of these. 
* Can I say again, I love the mouseover plugin. Jesus. It makes this log significantly better.
* My children noted that I often answer these questions with "my wife." It's true. She's the one.
* Postermodern ironic self-reference dismissals in several questions. Not sure what to do about it. That is my honest feeling! Yikes.
* Failed to talk trash about the question.
* Overall, I feel like these answers tell me there is something wrong! Am I depressed?
