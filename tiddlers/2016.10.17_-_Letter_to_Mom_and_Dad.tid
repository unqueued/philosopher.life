title: 2016.10.17 - Letter to Mom and Dad

//Welcome to the original [[Relic]] of this wiki. This project started it all. I could not disentangle the non-linear mess, and I still can't. Lol! God damn, I have incredibly mixed, ferocious feelings about this letter even today. I'm so grateful to myself for having taking the leap, to make the effort, to have sat down in my ball of tears to write this rhizome. [[h0p3]], you've done well with what you've had.//

---

Dear Mom and Dad,

If we sum up the time that we will spend together over the course of the remainder of our lives, I might guess we have 30-40 weeks of time left.<<ref "1">>  I want to make sure our precious time together counts. I want us to look forward to our visits together. I want us to enjoy them. I want them to be some of the highlights of our lives. I know you do too. I write [[this letter|About this Letter]] to extend an olive branch to you in the hope that we can achieve this happiness together.  

Our last conversation was a catastrophe. It weighs heavily on me.<<ref "2">> It haunts me. It kills me to see our relationship dying.<<ref "3">> I have spent a great deal of time and energy soulsearching, researching, and contemplating a solution.<<ref "4">> Problematic to resolving our issues: I don’t want to be hurt, and I don’t want to hurt you either.<<ref "5">> Attempting to fix this relationship feels like a high-stakes risk. Paradoxically, I think we both feel we are in a "lose-lose" position. It appears<<ref "6">>  as though there's no way to "win" and be happy together, as though all the roads we share lead to pain. So, why take the risk?

Here's why: I'm not sure I can be happy if we fail to mend our relationship. I'm not sure you can either. That isn't to say we can't live on without each other, but in doing so our lives will be disfigured and unfulfilled.<<ref "ns">> Hence, this risk is worth taking.

I think we are both hurting a lot, and success here would make us happier. We love each other, and I believe we both strongly desire to resolve our tension. I want to build healing bridges over the gulf that grows between us.

I don't know what it will take to heal our relationship, to whatever degree we can, and I realize we may not salvage it. In any case, I desperately need our next visit to work (or at least be a giant step in the right direction). To that end, I have worked hard to respond to you as best as I can in this letter. I hope you will take my claims seriously and with maximum charity; they are hard-won. I seek to be delicate and yet directly honest with you. I'm seek to be as neutral and objective as I can in my analysis.<<ref "x">> I seek to address our problems with kindness and [[empathy|Empathy]]. In empathy, I believe we both have good intentions, and I hope we have the tools (or the tools to acquire the tools we need) to build these bridges.<<ref "7">>

Here is where I'm going to start (re)building: I deeply love you, and I always will. I am truly sorry I hurt you. I wish I could go back in time and undo the damage I've caused. That's not who I'm trying to be. I wish I had the wisdom, understanding, and foresight to know how to do it right. I wish I had the resources and awareness to never have been in this position in the first place. This sucks. I'm [[doing the best I can with what I have|Doing our Best]], and that has not been sufficient. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. 

Of course, none of us are [[perfect|The Good]]. We are fallible, finite, and limited; we all fall short; we are blemished and defective. We each have emotional conflicts and logical dissonance in ourselves.<<ref "8">> On top of that, we are all vulnerable, [[intelligent|We are Intelligent]],<<ref "9">> and highly sensitive<<ref "10">> human beings who happen to have radically divergent and often incompatible experiences, journeys, memories, inferential-styles, values, goals, projects, desires, feelings, and points of view. We have different modes toward and systematic understandings of ourselves and the world. In other words, we have different [[reality maps|Reality map]], and finding a harmony for our fragile relationship is fraught with unique challenges.<<ref "11">> 

Our reality maps are critically incongruent; we have [[fundamental disagreements|Fundamental Disagreement]].<<ref "y">> Of course, disagreement is normal (and can be a vital, good thing), especially for imaginative and intelligent people. Many disagreements can be passed over without any real analysis or major resolution.<<ref "12">> Diversity in beliefs should often be celebrated or even understood as being evolutionarily adaptive. Unfortunately, for practical reasons, some kinds of disagreement require resolution.<<ref "13">> Resolution doesn't necessarily mean we radically change each others minds (although that happens once in a while), but it does require we find a way to make ourselves compatible with each other.

Right now, we aren't compatible; we can barely sit in the same room with each other.<<ref "14">>  We are just hurting each other. If we can't find a way to stop it, then it is clear that we can't have a significant relationship.<<ref "15">>

I recognize that the significance of our [[friendship|Friendship]] comes in degrees. We may never be perfectly close, even though we want to be.<<ref "16">> If all else fails, if we somehow couldn't make a significant relationship work with each other, then we could always fall back on a distant, hollow, merely polite relationship with each other.<<ref "17">> We would ask each other "how have you been?" and the other would respond with a hollow "great, thank you for asking" alongside whatever minimal information or banalities we would be required to provide in the context. We'd get together when necessary and help each other when asked, but we wouldn't really engage in meaningful bonding beyond that. We wouldn't really //be with// each other to the degree that we really crave. We wouldn't really get to know each other, and we wouldn't really be walking together in the journeys of our lives. Our interactions would be reduced to social niceties and etiquette. Our relationship would be tedious and merely a chore we fulfill in order to maintain basic social ties. It would be joyless duty. It would be a form of mere instrumental social networking and tending to social capital we've built in each other. It would be a lie. It would be repulsive. It would be dreadful. It would be heart-breaking, and because it would be so crazy painful, I hope failure is not an option. I can't bear to imagine going down that road.

Suffice it to say, we need compatibility bridges between our reality maps instead of galactic rifts and clashes between them. We must come to a mutual, shared, and more secured understanding between our reality maps if our relationship is going to have depth and meaning. I believe we can eventually and hopefully effortlessly pass over much of our disagreement, but only after we have a better grasp of what we disagree on (even if we can only get that picture painted in broad strokes).<<ref "18">> This gives us vital information for not stepping on each others toes or pissing in each others' pools.<<ref "19">> Essentially, by cultivating our empathy and working towards mutual understanding (even if only an understanding of our disagreement), we will be better positioned to know what not to say or do in front of each other. We will able to see the contours of our conflict and avoid collision where possible.<<ref "20">> If we're lucky, we may even be able to accept our disagreement so thoroughly that we just laugh about it together and enjoy each others company without reservation.




My struggle with you is deeply entangled with struggle with myself. Part of you who are, your reality maps, is deeply embedded in me. I am at war in myself, and by proxy, I am at war with you.








I believe this is the epicenter of our conflict:

This isn't about being right now. It is not about finding the truth. It is not about trying to convince each other of our reality maps or even defend our reality maps against each other in any significant way. 

I think my autism is something you believe I should overcome and not something that should be embraced. 


We don't seem to agree on the moral rules of the social game (whether or not the game is fundamental to our existence is another question, one which we both desperately try to support) we are participating in.  

Let me straight up grant that you have a right to believe what you want to believe (assume I take up moral relativism for your position, but not mine). So, only I might have moral duties, and you either don't or I have nothing to say about it. I don't take you to be morally culpable for who you are, and I'm fine with you being whoever you want to be (that doesn't mean I won't change my behavior with you). 

I feel like I've journeyed logically and emotionally deep existential, philosophical, religious territory. Note, our disagreement doesn't make you wrong, but it 


 I reasonably have a right to feel and think what I do.

I have earned my right to think differently than you on crucial matters. We are going to disagree, which is totally fine. But 


Here's the ugly fact: I can't be who you want me to be. I don't think that makes me immoral. I don't think that makes me irrational. I don't think that means I lack integrity. I don't think you should //otherise //me because I believe so fundamentally different from you, and I owe the exact same token of respect to you. This is agreeing to disagree. 

Problematically, agreeing to disagree is an oversimplification of the process. There are networks of inferences that branch off disagreement, and recognizing how and where it branches off is required for us to fully agree to disagree on the implications of our starting disagreement. I really do think I understand the set of inferences which result from your starting place; I see the implications of your point of view to a significant extent. I do not think the same can be said for you of me. 

Obviously, you can't have experienced and thought everything I have; you aren't me. But, you do have to try harder to understand why it is that I think what I do. You don't have to "revolve" around me like this. I think, however, that's what being a parent is really like sometimes. It means you have to develop an appreciation for who your children really are. They're really different from you, they have different minds than you, they have different reality maps from you in radical ways, and that means you'll have to spend more time learning to empathize with them than other parents with their children.

We have to get past judgement. We can't be cynical about each other. If we are, we'll both just hate each other. 

Let's be clear here: I'm ridiculously judgmental. This is pot calling kettle black. I judge you to be less judgmental than me. Judging and making arguments which passed judgement from experts is what I did as a vocation. I think you have and do much the same as a vocation.

 Making judgement calls is what we're forced to do. At the bottom of our hearts, we both know how awful human beings really are. You have hope for them, and I do not. Not having hope for people, in a predictive sense, is not the same as saying I won't have empathy for them. It just means I know longer empathize with the people who you hope they really can be. I'm no longer working to help that person because that person won't actually exist (here's where prediction matters).

Can we co-exist without judging each other? 


I forgive you for whatever mistakes you have committed against me because I legitimately think you are good people who honestly seek to do the right thing. I think you are addicted to being moral <and I don't think that a bad thing> I think trying to be moral rules your life. I think you are extremely good at it in certain ways, I think you aren't as rational in your pursuit of morality as you would hope. I think I'm the exact same way. I think in our pursuit of being moral, we've come to understand the very concept of Virtue differently. What it means to be excellent persons is different for us. We both think the other is incredibly wrong about some of the most important things in the world, the things which define who we are to the core. The cores of reality maps, the most fundamental questions and assumptions we take up, have some differences. We both took a handful of existential questions and answered them the same in some ways, but differently in others. Even tiny differences at the beginning core of our reality maps will result in a tidal wave ripple of differences throughout a network of wildly chaotic fractal of inferences made surrounding that core.

I've had to find my own way. And, I can see, I will continue to need to do that. I feel burned by the authorities I have accepted in my life. I now must strongly buffer and reflect upon who and what I take to be authoritative. It is our plight, in this deep epistemic existential center of who we are, of what our freedom is, of the 

Don't you hear two people in this document? Don't you see in these words that there is an internal cataclysm between the Red Pilled Man and Kant's Agent fighting within me? Don't you see the Kantian Crossroads!? Don't you fucking see the Road to Damascus!!! Neitzsche, that piece of shit (regardless of whether he's right or wrong), is sitting on the sidewalk laughing his off. I'm being driven to madness at the crossroads. 

Why can't you accept that I am just a mortal man at the crossroads deciding who I will be here? Why can't you empathize with that man? Why would you begrudge him any pathways to happiness, especially when they are rational? Do you not understand him, do you think he is confused, or do you really think he's just evil? 

Can you live with the fact that our reality maps are very different in important ways? Can you accept what that means? Can we be close again despite these differences?

I definitely have respect for people who have different opinions than me. I couldn't have been shaped as radically as I have been over the past 30 years if I didn't take others seriously.  


Don't you see that I'm at The Crossroads? Don't you see that I wandered deep down a path that started at this crossroads, and I was deeply and systematically wrong at an epic level. My starting choice at central Crossroads of my reality map may have been wrong. I clearly have been wrong about so very much. I can't trust anyone, not even myself. 

Who and What can I trust? Well. Reason seems amazing. Even if reason is just the constructed thing, a set of social rules and memes in our society which define "how to think," where we play a public game in shaming those who don't reason well and worshipping those who reason well (where each contestant comes with their own definitions of what is reasonable).

I don't have miracles. I don't have authority besides myself at this point. The real me is a naked, weak, broken man at the crossroads, yet again. It is like Groundhog Day againness. I can't keep doing this. It is the true meaning of purgatory. I am caught between a heavenly way and the way of the hellian. Problematically, they both look like hell, but oddly, the hellian way at least gives me reasons to live. I can't be a slave anymore. I care about myself too much to accept my slavery. I have dignity. Ah, is this a slip into the dark triad or actually practicing empathy for myself?

I think you take yourselves to be excellent psychologists and students of human nature. I think you are very much so in certain ways. I've also seen you be wrong too often on these topics to trust you much on them. 



I think you are reasonable enough that if you experienced what I have experienced, you would agree with me. I think that if you were transplanted out of your soul and into where mine has been, and you walked observingly on my lifepath, with empathy, where you saw what you saw and didn't see what you didn't see, where you had the billions of choice-time-slice-instances (and many choices to choose from in each instanst) in front of you every day

I think if you were the ideal epistemic agent, an agent of maximum possible empathy, flying above me the forest of my lifepaths, you'd see that I did the best I could with what I had, that given my reality map at each choice timeslice-instance, I made the best, most rational choice I could have at that instance. It is almost certainly not the objectively best choice given the ideal epistemic agent's truly objective reality map. But, I didn't have that reality map to work with. I had my shitty, hilarious, almost farcical map that I've cultivated over time (just like the rest of us). 

 the reality map I have w with while journeying on this path



I'm interested in being authentic. In being myself. I see now why I can't trust authority. Many times I have thought that, and now I re-understand what it means to not trust authority. There are many levels and kinds of authority. 





I have to trust myself. If I don't then we can go nowhere. How much should I trust myself? 

The man who is wrong about the Red Pilled road 













Reaching a point where we aren't stabbed by the pain of our disagreement may not be easy. We see each others' reality maps as being desperately wrong, as dangerous, as a significant cause of much of our personal pain. 

I think we both worry the other has completely nixed the other's map in their map. Like we both might somehow be thinking the other is completely off their rocker, doesn't have all they'remarbles, that their missing the bigger picture so strongly that it's insane. 












From your point of view, unless some miracle happens, unless the Potter can successfully reshape His lump of clay, unless I somehow reshaped my reality map, or unless God judges by some other standard than what you accept, I'm going to hell. My short life on this Earth will translate into eternal damnation; that's God's justice for me. 

That is a powerful point of view to have. It shapes your reality map in dealing with me very strongly. 


You have spent your lives trying to convert people, and by your own standard, you have failed with your sons. Can you stoically accept my fate and just be with this sinner as he sins? Can you do without judgment? Can you let it go? I assume not. It is deeply ingrained in you. It is your vocation and purpose. 


[[Your Faith and my Lack thereof]]


 I'm okay with the fact that we have different reality maps. I think there are asymmetries in our relationship that need correction. Namely, I think I understand your reality map (I've experienced it) a lot more more than you understand mine. I think the key to our compatibility is two fold:

Being explicitly okay with each other having different reality maps.
Understanding what we disagree on.

Understand my reality map is understand me. If you don't want to understand me, to empathize with me, to see if my shoes, then I'm not really convinced you care about me. 


 


Do you want to me say you've thrown your life away? That you are making a gigantic mistake in your irrational, addicted pursuit of faith? Do you want me to groan at every thing you say, to be pissed at the causes and consequences of the beliefs that led to your words and actions? No. I expect the same from you.



I think this document is worth studying. I’m not looking for you to grade my paper (which wasn't ultimately why I sent you my papers ; I was trying to give you breadcrumbs to my reality, to have the content to interact with me [I eventually just stopped, since I saw it wasn't working]), but I am hoping you will listen to me because I will listen back.

Some beliefs might have to change for that to occur. Some notion of what we ought to do and why might have to change. Understanding how to wisely and politely have fundamental disagreement is not easy.

We have other impediments to consider. Importantly, we are not as articulate as we wish. Even if we have the right intentions and ideas, it is hard to find the right words (particularly in the moment) to unlock our relationship.

[[my friend M.B.A.|M.B.A.]]

I believe your reality map has brought about significant pain in my life. You have such a coherent view that it can be intoxicating. It took me a long time to peel away from it. 

Despite our differences, we obviously share plenty of beliefs in common.

[[Meme]]. Meme video.

[[Roots]]

 In addition to our conflict, I'm dealing with a network of other crucial issues. I would say I have disintegrated, and I am trying to find a way to integrate myself. 


We all think we are right. We find it hard to act on the assumption that we aren't. It is our plight as humans to both know our fallibility and at least temporarily assume we aren't in our calculations and choices.


Do you remember when I was 11, and I decided not to speak to H.O.E.?

Do you remember when I moved to college? We had a falling out.


The happiness and well-being of my children may be an impediment. They are not a bargaining chip, a tool, or a social totem for us to dance around. We have conflicting views on what is best for my children. Let there be no mistake, J.E.W. and I call the shots. 


In all likelihood, we will not dispel our fundamental disagreements. That's okay. Hopefully, we share enough common ground that we can build bridges across our gaps.



Admittedly, I have unhappy memories of your relationships with all of my grandparents, except [[B.B.C.|Betty Boop]]. This is not what I want for M.S.N. and I.M.F.. I want them to know you and experience joy with you. Unfortunately, I don't want you to infect their reality maps (which I'm sure I have already damaged - as is the nature of fallible, human parenting). 



As to your qualms with my self-medication, I hope you will in time see that I have done the best I could with what I had. There are not many viable resources available to me. I also think I have been justified in my mistrust of others and my willingness to be my own advocate when no healer or remedy worked. I think you know very little about my journey and progress for mental health and happiness (this is not an assignment of blame). Were you to have an ideal, more objective, third-personal view of my experience, I think you would find I did you proud. You have not been there for the countless conversations I have had with other family members about this issue. I have been positively scientific in my pursuit of stability and happiness. Problems are not solved overnight. 

Obviously, everyone wants unconditional happiness, and if medicine or drugs are conditional

I have found an incredibly helpful substance: Ketamine. It's literally magic for depression. I entreat you to research it. 

I have heard you say that you don’t feel like you can “win” with me. I think we both feel that way about each other. We don’t know the right words to say to each other. We don’t have the keys to unlock our compatibility.


This letter is densely packed, and I hope the scope and depth of it enables us to experience a quantum leap in our friendship.


If I were there, I'd hug you. I love you very much. 

I am listening.

Love,

Your son

<<footnotes "1" "I could be wrong (hopefully it would be far more time), but it seems at least a distinct and realistic possibility. Of course, we may have distant interactions in between, but they seem categorically not the same. Here's hoping that at least this letter is an exception to the previous sentence. I may only write a handful of letters in my life that passionately matter to me, and I hope this one does the job we need it to do.">>

<<footnotes "2" "In addition to a number of other significant emotional and intellectual requirements of me.">>

<<footnotes "3" "That pain is part of my motivation to fix the problem. The happiness we can achieve together is another.">>

<<footnotes "4" "I have been in a deep think for many years now about a number of serious problems. That obviously doesn’t validate or show superiority in anything I’m saying, but I hope it demonstrates how seriously I take the task. Without a doubt, I am sure you have done the same.">>

<<footnotes "5" "Eliminating overwhelming pain (pain isn't always unconditionally bad) from my life is crucial to making my life worth living. I’m not sure I can effectively articulate the pain I have experienced. You have seen the signs of it though.">> 

<<footnotes "ns" "I think having a good relationship with your family is a necessary condition to the happiness of most people, even if it isn't sufficient.">>

<<footnotes "6" "Appearances can be deceiving.">>

<<footnotes "x" "But, no longer “whatever the costs.” Unfortunately, for too long I had dogmatically reflected upon this change in my stance toward to world (which amounted to a change in the epistemic algorithm of the rewards center of my brain ) as a kind of unacceptable, Camusian philosophical suicide, a move lacking in rationally justified integrity. My lust for certainty (which failed), and then later for mere confidence or acceptable justification has chipped away at me. In a way, I hated myself. The modernist in me hated my journey and reshaping. I was wrong though. The naked pursuit of truth is not always worth it. Some things are not worth thinking about. To be clear, I’m not looking to be perfectly happy; I’m after a semblance of eudaimonia. Flourishing human specimens must accept their bias and fallibility. Bias, in a terrifying way, is our plight, and a thing we must stoically acknowledge. At some point, we can't reshape our bias, we can only be enveloped by it. I want to flourish, and that means learning to be okay with and to live with my bias. There is the rationalization, if you seek one. I call it a practical leap worth taking.">>

<<footnotes "7" "We're xNTJs, so maybe we can figure this out. In my opinion, a strong habit and meme that permeates our family is having the wisdom+sensitivity to recognize how often and to what degree we’ve failed to be intelligent over the course of our lives. We evaluate ourselves and see our limits in an honest way that others often do not and very often cannot. Sometimes we are too critical, and sometimes we think too highly of ourselves or thoughts. In my opinion, having the humility to consistently recognize our mistakes and flaws has been one of our family’s greatest assets (and sometimes an incredible source of pain).">>

<<footnotes "8" "We are not perfectly constituted or [[integrated|Theory of Positive Disintegration]] selves.">>

<<footnotes "9" "It is unfashionable and lacking in (false) humility to imply or openly admit to being intelligent (particularly when you are). It causes others to have a kneejerk reaction to 'put you in your place.' Of course, who doesn't have the inescapable bias of acting on the assumption they are smart, or right, or the hero of their own story? You have to hide your intelligence in many ways, especially when you don't agree with others. I believe we simply have to own up to it in this conversation because it is part of the root of the complexity of our problem.">>

<<footnotes "10" "Sensitivity is the foundation of intelligence, a reason we see the world differently than others, and the source of some of our atypical pleasures and pains.">>

<<footnotes "11" "Unfortunately, in my opinion, we don't have access to an objective, ideal referee or guide to help us make sense of our reality maps, to disentangle our conflicts, to heal our wounds, or to clarify our common ground. I honestly believe that if this is going to succeed, we'll both have to work for it.">> 

<<footnotes "y" "For the record, even when we disagree, I know you are still some of the smartest people I’ve ever met. Listen: I strongly care what you think. Even without your approval or understanding, I respect you. I think about what you say, a lot (perhaps too much). When all else fails, I try to think about what you would say. Before we get all weepy-eyed at that critical admission which supposedly no 'self-respecting' offspring would ever utter, I will rescue myself: It’s a fact that offspring tend to be within 10 IQ points of their parents. I don’t count myself as an exception to that rule. Further, I (almost delusionally) take myself to be absurdly intelligent (go team arrogance!), and thus, I have excellent reasons to believe you are too. The bad news is that our brains are deteriorating, thinking is heavy lifting, and we’ve hit our peaks. At some point in our lives, there is an acceleration in the crystallization of our reality maps, and we become less agile and able to radically alter and reorganize our reality maps (in my experience, that process begins or becomes more noticeable around 25-35 years old for most adults [and, I'm no exception] - roughly within the decade after our frontal lobes have finished developing). At which point, our mental growth tends to fit our reality map instead of fundamentally shaping it. I hope we can squeeze through this gap while we still have what it takes.">>

<<footnotes "12" "e.g. I think pepperoni pizza is better than sausage pizza. You might disagree. Practically-speaking, we don't and shouldn't really care about this disagreement (although, in a valuable theoretical way, I'm fully willing to entertain the possibility there are cases in which we should consistently care). Maybe it only matters when we have exceptionally limited shared resources, and then maybe we 'take turns' or select other ways to demonstrate that we still care for these lesser-kinds of disagreed-upon preferences of each other. In any case, this disagreement almost never matters and poses no serious problem to resolve.">>

<<footnotes "13" "e.g. It would not be useful or kind of me to confront, interrogate, or humiliate a relative in his 70's for watching Fox News or reading Facebook or Breitbart as his primary information sources. Our disagreement on our political and epistemic duties can't feasibly be resolved through careful argumentation. In fact, so much of our reality maps are so far apart that we can't even engage the normal game of public reasoning, of enjoying each others' reality maps, and rooting for each others' reality maps is over in that instance. We don't understand each other enough. Thus, we begin playing a different game, wherein we aren't strong or significant friends that can talk to each other (and never will be), but we hug and say a few nice words to each other.  If one asked the other for help, we'd gladly give it. We try to share in what little we have in common.We honestly wish the other well. We love each other, but we don't really like each other (or what we like about the person is really only a distinct set of slivers of their reality map). It sucks, but that's about the best resolution we can get. It was the best we could work for.">>

<<footnotes "14" "Which is not assignment of blame. If we enter a blame game, we are put into a defensive position. We might even move on the offense by pointing out the other's hypocrisy. In considering blame, I worry that we are forced to pit the metaethical regions of our reality maps against each other (regions we have both worked hard to cultivate, ground that neither of us are willing cede). This is may not be useful to us. It may not help us listen to each other. Unfortunately, no matter how much we cushion it, some minimal degree of understanding our blameworthiness (in each others' eyes) may be inescapable to our conflict resolution.">>

<<footnotes "15" "I'm not trying to draw a line in the sand (although, I'm sure each of us has our own personal line). I'm trying to point out that it isn't a practical option for us to continually hurt each other. It isn't the loving thing to do. I take your maxim, 'if you have nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all,' to be applicable here. Unfortunately, we have a rich enough history together and we know each other so well that facial expressions, body language, pauses, the way a conversation is steered, word choice, and other aspects of our circumstances impart enormous meaning to each of us (that doesn't make us good at communicating with each other, but it means that we are sensitive to each other in ways that we aren't to others). Problematically, those cases of needing to 'say nothing at all' require more than not saying 'words' for us. Finding a way not to communicate not nice things, which can be more than our flat words, is difficult for us. This may not be a solvable problem for either of us. Worst case scenario: let's try until we can't.">>

<<footnotes "16" "My default settings tend to have an all or nothing kind of attitude (which serves me well in some ways and terribly in others). It's particularly bad for the problem of friendship. I'm working on it.">>

<<footnotes "17" "A minimum that I've spectacularly failed to accomplish since our last meeting. I am sorry I haven't been able to give you even that.">>

<<footnotes "18" "Admittedly, I (arrogantly) believe I can put my finger on the problematic disparities between our reality maps. I have had the benefit of being able to study your reality map in great detail (which I believe has begun to crystallize, which is only natural). I still share much of your map. We share a legacy of continents together, and I think we still share a crucial core. Importantly, it's not your fault that you don't know many parts of my reality map, just as it's not my fault for not knowing or having traveled the unknown parts of your reality maps.">>

<<footnotes "20" "I fear this is a prime target for dismissal, as though I'm asking us to 'revolve' around each other. But, that's just what friendship is. Maybe you don't want to be friends like that. We don't have to be. I'm not claiming you have to or should. I'm saying that it is the cost of being friends with such disparate reality maps. It's simply more work to empathize with someone with a radically different reality map than it is with someone with a highly similar reality map.">>
