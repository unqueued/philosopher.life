title: 2017.05.06 - Wiki Review Log

* [[Current Focus of h0p3's Wiki]]
** I retitled {Focus} to be more in line with what it reviews (the wiki as a whole). I revamped it as well. It clearly needs more structural work. It is one of the harder parts of the wiki to write. The logs, in a sense, are easy compared to that work. It's okay that I don't know what I'm doing. I can only do my best, and look through your snapshots. Your best causes good change.
* [[2017.05.05 - Link Log]]
** Edits.
** I'm not in love with my aggregated news sources themselves. I truly despise most of these publishers. 
* [[2017.05.05 - Wiki Review Log]]
** I made a [[Realpolitik Speculation]] post because I noticed I wasn't doing more. I want to continue that trend. Let's see if I do. 
* [[2017.05.05 - Pipefitting Log]]
** Edits. Forgot to say I spoke with my teacher about the simulator, and also didn't mention a moment of awkwardness.
** Also, I forgot to ask my teacher about which tools I really should buy off the list. I want to use all the resources available to me.
* [[2017.05.05 - Diet Log]]
** Eating fewer meals helps.

** Made a few edits. Still glad I've made scripted encounters with myself for myself. Talking about it makes me feel better. It allows me to reflect more cautiously and to not have to come up with my positions on my narrative on the spot.
