title: 2019.03.19 - MPXN: DewDrop

Dear MPXN,

I asked for 3 months, and I'm sorry for how long I'm taking.<<ref "q">> Hopefully, it gave you a chance to think about whether or not you wanted to speak with me. You have neat surprises in your work, and I wasn't sure how I should approach you about it. I'm going to shotgun fire some thoughts about it, especially dewdrop. We'll take it from there.

If I understand correctly, this is brilliant. This is an implementation of [[The Original Position]]. It is a filter-bubble construction which leverages our decentralized peer-to-peer trust in the epistemic expertise of those in our social graph. I believe it is a place for [[T42T]] games to be played in coming to understand the world through the eyes of [[others]].

I don't think your "why" section even begins to cover why your tool is valuable. I love how it decentralizes power. It looks flexible and built for enabling us to choose how we will cooperate and why. 

I'm not convinced such a tool will arise in a perfectly competitive market unless it can monetized and controlled.

<<<
It's impossible to resolve an argument without finding common ground. dewDrop provides a meaningful social common ground, because the 'Truth' in dewDrop is nothing more than 'a record of things which have been said.'

Two people debating about important matters can disagree about all kinds of things - but they can't possibly disagree about the fact that they are talking.
<<<

Perhaps we will find more common ground about how to speak about truth in time. I cannot deny your final point, of course. 

<<<
Encourage Cooperation through Record Keeping
<<<

Accountability and transparency can serve us profoundly. In most cases, the weight of a voice should rest upon significant evidence. I am interested in how people can change, become better people, and how that can be understood more effectively. It requires thinking with and about [[The Other]].

<<<
No Single Perspective is Authoritative

If you read that last sentence, you may think I'm wrong - you may not trust people who always apologize, because you think it means they are weak. Fine - that's entirely up to you - with a public record of who has said what, when, you can go through records and ignore people who behave in any way you don't like.

Nothing is forced on anyone.
<<<

I can't say the subtitle is accurate, but I adore what you are driving at though. From an objective perspective, I think some people are justifiably authoritative. Sifting for who likely deserves to be authoritative (which is all we can do sometimes) is going to require a decentralized effort though. This is a place for ML and open protocols. 

Part of the issue here is how profoundly expensive this kind of signaling can be. It's hard to build something which can't be gamed, and it requires enough people participating in it to work. 

There is something profoundly right about your work!

<<<
A Cognicist mind must not injure another mind, remove the autonomy of another mind, or through inaction allow harm to occur to another mind when at all possible.
<<<

The proviso is fairly difficult to resolve, but I agree that is generally right. It turns out that not all minds are valid, some people don't have a right to how they wield their autonomy, and some identities should not exist.

<<<
A mind can and should protect their own existence and autonomy except where it conflicts with principle 1. 
<<<

Assuming one has met all the obligations of [[The Moral Law]], then whatever options are left is permissible. I will agree to the truism that we have a right to protect what we have a right to protect about ourselves. 

<<<
A mind must interact with others knowing that their contexts are invariably different, and must meet the other mind where they are, with an attempt at compassion and understanding, except where it conflicts with principle 1. Or 2. 
<<<

That sounds like an attempt at [[The Golden Rule]]. =)

It's beautiful. It's often what I'm describing to my children, especially my autistic son.

This is beautiful. I am convinced that [[Self-Dialectic]] is about helping our various emotional computers cooperate with our cognitive computers.

I’m also skeptical of any information-processing system which is infinitely capable of justifying its own existence
<<<

Does that apply to metaphysics as well? I'm interested in how you want to discuss the model of all models: Objectivity. I adore how you are in "everything is a model" modeling-mode here. I appreciate how you wish to curtail certainty. In any case, this was a unique paper.

Nobody’s Whiteboard is Correct. Nobody’s can be.
<<<

There is a difference between the impossibility of infallibly modeling the world and fallibly modeling [[irwartfrr]]. There really are correct ways to model in your shoes.

I predicted he'd win the primaries and election as well. I predict things will get worse for most Americans. Do you still hold your belief here?

Alright, that should be a good starting place for us. I hope to hear back from you!


Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
