title: 2018.06.19 - Reddit: Not Post Hoc

//Basically not really post hoc.//

Cut to 29ish subs. I believe 30 is the algorithmic cutoff point for Reddit's current algorithm?

I can't let go of SSC, even though I find most of them despicable. Their voice is a powerful force in the world today, and many psychopaths are riding that wave. I need to understand it. SneerClub has helped me get out of the SSC-rationalist zoo a bit to catch a breath of fresh air.

I'm cutting a ton of unworthy's. But, I got to thinking that there really are two kinds of subs for me: those in which I generally aim to read comments on a very consistent basis (I'm there for the community, discussion, etc...although, I don't always want to participate in them) and those subs which I can understand 70% of what I want to know just by reading the titles, and sometimes it will send me a bit deeper down the rabbithole (though not often).

I've added the philosophy subs again. It's time to jump back in. Perhaps I should distinguish community subs that I want to speak in from those I don't. What makes a sub worth posting in? Why do I want to post? I really don't like being treated poorly for carefully expressing my opinion. If I've respected my audience enough to say it kindly and logically, I expect to be treated the same. They do not play the [[T42T]] game correctly as a community, in fact, they don't even play [[T4T]]. It's time to defect. I will move back to lurking if I don't feel like continually forgiving their defection from reason, and I've not violated my morally justified axiom in doing so.

When I asked myself about how I wanted to reason about this, I decided I needed to create [[Reddit Theory & Practice]]. The straw broke the camels back. I need to legitimately show my work to myself and think about what I'm putting into my mind about what I should be putting into my mind, at least for Reddit (who knows, perhaps I can get even better at telling this kind of story to myself regarding everything in my [[Link Log]] and beyond.
