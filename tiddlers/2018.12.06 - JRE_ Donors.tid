title: 2018.12.06 - JRE: Donors

Our donors contacted my brother asking for information. He responded (feeling forced) in writing.<<ref "w">> They called him for the realtime emotional manipulation once they had their ammo (which they have failed to gather over the course of the year, but need to look like they actually give a shit before they try to engage in person). 

My brother walked away from the conversation quite angry. They clearly treat him as an outsider, and they are two-faced with him. They had no interest in his stories about work. They applauded him for being their representative to grandpa's bday (like Kenny's funeral); it makes them look good. The hypocritical virtue signaling (the turning the other cheek and submission to authority is hilarious), the lack of empathy, the opportunistic connection (only in those rare cases when it suits their needs), and approval-seeking requirement were all present. They really don't care. The difference between their private and public lives is staggering. 

We walked through parts of the conversation, and I gave my interpretation of the events.

My brother seems to agree more and more each year. This becomes less and less a place where only a fabled Muad'dib can see.

We discussed movies and opportunity costs. My brother is reading at work. It's been good for his brain and his back. His mattress has helped there too.

My brother and Rebecca will also be coming to see us with [[L]] and [[K]]! I am extremely excited. It will be a full house!

My brother wants to visit Raylan. He is aware of conflicting feelings, and he thinks he's being a drama queen. I think this has been a hell of a fucking year. Look at [[JRE]] (and other parts of my wiki as I document his life). It's not been easy. I would be surprised to find anyone who didn't have feelings moving in a thousand directions on this issue. I said I had no predictions on the matter, but I hope it will be a productive and perspective-granting visit for him.
