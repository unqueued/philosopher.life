Is All Quiet on the Western Front today?
Tue 6:09 PM
 I’m not sure what you mean by All Quiet... Am I missing something or do you just like to capitalize words?

 Side note: I know this is super out of left field, but... I think I agree with [[JRE]] that it may not be safe to contact ?[[MWF]]? & [[SLT]]. Especially if they are spreading false word that you’re selling. I don’t know how many people they’ve told in passing as a “warning” or what... but, I don’t think it will end well. I’ve had passing thoughts that they seem to have reached the point of no return on their end. But I also don’t talk to them that often and have a limited view altogether anyways.

 Thank you for thinking about it for me. I really appreciate it.

 Oooooh

 And, no problem. I honestly wish I had more insight on the whole situation for you...
14 hours ago
 It troubles me that they would make such a strong accusation like that.
14 hours ago
 AND tell people about it.
14 hours ago
 That is just the tip of the iceberg. I'm glad I had a sanity check with my advisers.

 It does appear they wish to sever the relationships/responsibilities and simply visit when once in a while when it is convenient to them to maintain to appearance that they care.

 They have almost retired from the family.
14 hours ago
 my grammar is extra bad lately

 I'm fairly sure they are in damage control mode to maintain their social capital.
14 hours ago
 Perhaps...

 I personally find that very frustrating. It feels less like we’re family and more like they’re just using us...

 Speaking of, has my mom responded to you yet?
14 hours ago
 She has not, but she has as long as she wants. Plus, I took forever to respond to her (so, I'd have no room to talk anyways).
14 hours ago
 Fair.

 My tired brain is everywhere this morning and it reminded me of something she said while we were talking about your letter
14 hours ago
 She mentioned that she never understood why you were of the mindset you have in regards to your parents... said that she and ?[[MWF]]? went through much worse as kids.
14 hours ago
 Which is a bold statement to me. I think there’s a lot I don’t know about here.
14 hours ago
 aye

 I don’t doubt the stories I’ve heard from you and [[JRE]]. But mom never really told me much about her childhood... just that it was awful and she used school as an escape.
14 hours ago
 Grandma Mary has told me a LOT about her childhood with Grandpa ?[[MWF]]? but idk how much of it is true and how much of it is twisted memories.
14 hours ago
 Maybe we should all just take your advice and write everything down... lol
14 hours ago
 Sorry. [[j3d1h]] asked giant questions, and it took me a long time to answer them.
13 hours ago
 It is true that watching the older generations has made it clear to me that I must write it down.
13 hours ago
 No worries!

 My brother recently needed to create a timeline of this year because he couldn't remember it. He used my wiki and his bank statements to recreate it.
13 hours ago
 Interesting.
13 hours ago
 I read about that some and was confused — makes sense in context now
13 hours ago
 I don’t think the comparison my mother makes is fair though... but I can’t really say I know better.
13 hours ago
 I'm not sure if she understands the nature of morality. To whom much is given, much is required. I understand she had it worse and less to work with, which is why I hold her to far lower standards than I hold myself. I'm also not convinced she is honest with herself, including about her own parents.
13 hours ago
 Her lack of understanding of my context is non-trivial, of course. She could have asked. =)
13 hours ago
 Yeah...
13 hours ago
 True. And she may. I hope she does.
13 hours ago
 It’s not really my place to correct her because I don’t know the whole situation of either.
13 hours ago
 Perhaps. Though, no one does. I take it you feel like you don't have a sufficient degree of knowledge to make such a move.
13 hours ago
 I hope she spends some time understanding the structure of the wiki.
13 hours ago
 A lot of people only look at New/Recent, but never actually understand how the pieces come together.
13 hours ago
 Guilty.

 But I like to dive in face first sometimes.
