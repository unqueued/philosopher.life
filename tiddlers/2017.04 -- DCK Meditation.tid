title: 2017.04 -- DCK Meditation

I think it is still a good idea for my kids to meditate. I can't keep piling things on for them to do. They need to be comfortable and fast with what they already have on their plates. I have to triage what we'll accomplish and what we won't.

Part of these meditations hover between useless and crazy. Other times I make acceptable points. I have actually gone on to implement some of these ideas. You can't be right or brilliant 100% of the time. You have to sift the sands. Tune it for signal-to-noise ratio.

Overall, it is clear that DCK is doing good in my life. It makes life positive for me.
