I hear the paradox of tolerance, the anarchic "no rules" State of Nature, the Libertarian's carefully disabled and conveniently disassembled minimalist government, the politically contradictory call for absolute freedom from each other, and the denial of moral (and thus justified political) obligations to others.

This is incoherent. It's borderline doubletalk, but it is, without a doubt, a powerful piece of rhetoric. I suggest there is a dogwhistle in that quote. Everyone who buys it thinks they will benefit from it, but a portion of these further understand what it really means to implement it to the N^^th^^ degree to the point that we are "free" to enslave each other without limit.

Also, if we are exceedingly exacting with these words, the individualist cannot run their own life, but they can't run their own life enough to not let anyone else run their life either. To say one is not ruled by a principle is to deny one's existence. What do you think our computational minds are? Of course, Randian apologists will claim I've been uncharitable, but it turns out to be part of the core issue at stake in defining autonomy (self-legislation).
