title: 2019.02.12 - TDL: I Might Do It!

* Letters. Bang bang.
* Read+Write
* Continue to mold your kids in mathematics. They are making good progress. It's been a while since they took it seriously like this.
** [[1uxb0x]] is grinding, his writing has radically improved, his programmatic organization has helped, he demonstrates his work now, and he's methodically climbing. Life of Fred prepped him, but now the calculations and virtue-theoretic habituation is filling out his innards. GO, GO, GO!
** [[j3d1h]] is crawling through that Illustrated Number Theory book. It's fucking gorgeous, hard, and I would have to work to understand it all. I've never been through most of it. She continues to advance into areas I simply don't know; she will one day realize just how ignorant I am (and not just because she's a teenager). She finds it boring, but she agrees the proofs are elegant. I want her to know what real mathematics is like. I will never be able to show her, but I know where the trails begin.
* Chili sounds good. We'll do something with beef.
* I should smash through [[Flatland]]. It's sitting right here on my desk.
* I'm worried that my [[Straussian]] [[deepread]]ing style is a waste on the Jung book. Still, teasing apart where he is wrong is a non-trivial accomplishment. Ironically, I feel like I may need to be able to explain Jung in analytic phil.
* Those links aren't going to log themselves.
* [[Unflattening]] is just sitting there, and you owe [[nomasters]] the other book. 
* Also, why does this feel [[Wiki Audit]]ish?
* Keep bidding, the wolf is close.
* I would like to see more letter writing from my children. This is a practice that needs to begin now, right?
** I know I wish I had more practice. It's heavy-lifting for me, and I need it to be lighter for them.
* Lube, vits, and sanitizer. You are running low, sir. Get on it.
