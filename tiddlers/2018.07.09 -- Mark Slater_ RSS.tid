Hi there, 

Does philosopher.life have an RSS feed?

Hi [[Mark|Mark Slater]],

It's good to hear from you. I am sorry, but I do not have an RSS feed. I'm flattered that you seek one. I'm not convinced it is worth it even to you, but I could be wrong. I'm interested to know what you see in the wiki's structure and content that makes for a viable RSS feed. 

My family and I read our wikis together on Sundays for our family time. We use the "New" and "Recent" tabs in the sidebar as something a bit like an RSS tool. Here's an example: [[New]]. I must warn you; these are very noisy. There are a lot of mundane details and posts which I'm having a hard time seeing you interested in. That said, with RSS feeds and regex, you can filter to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. 

Did you have any particular filters in mind? I have a couple ideas, but I'd like to know what you are looking for. I'm not sure what you personally think is worth RSSing. Beyond "New" and "Recent," here are some examples I have in mind:

* There are particular tiddlers you want to see whenever they've been updated.
** Sometimes I only change a couple words though.
* There are particular logs you'd want to track.
** This often has a lot of noise too, but there are few exceptions I can come up with.
* You want to read the extended sequence of my public letters to you as a federated user-generated RSS-based mail/forum.
** I've seen work for RSS feeds to be slurped into one's wiki, so that could build something kind of neat.

There are several crucial aspects of this wiki which are not blog-like and aren't terribly conducive to RSS-style reading and interpretation, imho. Perhaps unfortunately, my wiki is built: chaotically, piecemeal, and not in palatable or enjoyable sequences. I will continue to think about and investigate the matter. Thank you for calling it to my attention.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
