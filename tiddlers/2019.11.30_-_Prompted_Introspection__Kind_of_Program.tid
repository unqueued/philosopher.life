title: 2019.11.30 - Prompted Introspection: Kind of Program

!! What kind of program do you enjoy most on TV?detective shows, comedies, game shows?and why?

# ~~The kind of program which maximizes my utility given deontic constraints~~ I like the kind of show that rips the laughs, squeels, and tears out of me.
#* Those shows tend to be extremely childish (like me) in some sense. 
#* Oh, I like shows that cause us to talk. The one where you HAVE to pause it to talk. The one where you have to put something over your eyes and drown it out because it is overwhelming.
#* I like the programs which map onto the world and us. I like programs that give us memetic bridges. I like programs which are rewatchable, which demand my iteration.

# Of the 3, comedies.
#* Or, what is not a detective show or a game show? What is not the game of uncovering the absurd?  
#** Just the facts, ma'am.
#* Comedy is the rhetorical glove. Please, do not stick that whole thing in me.

# What makes a program [[good]], and hence [[gfwiwcgws]]?
