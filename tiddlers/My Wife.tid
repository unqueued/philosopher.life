title: My Wife

She is my one true love. Literally, no matter who I am become, I love her. She is the anchor that ties me to humanity.

We disagree. That's okay. People disagree. Rational people disagree all the time. She is a genius. I'm lucky to have her. She understands me. What would it be like not to have her? What would it be like not to have someone who understood me? 

My worry is that now I can't understand her. Or, that when I understand her, I translate it into the redpilled philosophical computational model of humanity I have. I don't feel like I'm doing something irrational or psychopathic. I think it is fundamental empathy. However, she might not feel that way. I don't want to her to feel dehumanize (and, obviously, it goes without saying, I don't want to actually dehumanize her either). I love her. 

My dream is to find a way to make my wife as happy as I can. Money doesn't solve everything, but it would up to about $75k per person in my household per year (probably closer to $85k now). Thus, I will shoot to make around $400k a year and make her life one in which she is free to do as she pleases. She is my pet!
