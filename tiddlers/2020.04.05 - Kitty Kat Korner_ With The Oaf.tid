title: 2020.04.05 - Kitty Kat Korner: With The Oaf

Ranga's paw must be hurting. That cut doesn't look good. I think he's using the stairs less than usual. He's been outside less too. The fight with the feral cat must have hurt. Ranga is more likely to let you pet him on the street than inside, and there's still only a 90% chance he'll be happy if you pet him while giving him kittycrack or tunawater. He's suffered to be with people well beyond his personality. Why? Does he sense that we've all been together more? Or, just the paw? 

I must not smell too bad (though he never cares if I fart), and my blanket seems like a magnet lately. Three times in 16 hours he has curled up on top of me or inside a body-made nook (also, I have been potating on the couch a bunch). I can't move when he's there (and my hips beg me to toss and turn), but I'm honored to be comforting for him. I'm glad he's with me.

Meow's territory may be encroached upon? I hope they get along better.
