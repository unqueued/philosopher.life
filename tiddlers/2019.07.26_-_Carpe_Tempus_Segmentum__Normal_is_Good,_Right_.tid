title: 2019.07.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Normal is Good, Right?

* Woke at 11:00
** Just insane dreams and intensity.
* Fireman Time!
* Jumped into the day with folks.
* Wrote something I actually liked today. Wtf is happening? =)
* Walked with wife
* Read+Write
* Worked with son on Arch. 
** Might have a dying SSD, but tests look okay.
* Received a present from my donors. 
** I was gifted some erasable pens and a "smart" notebook of slick paper which works with these pens. The pages have QR codes on each so that presumably when you use their app it uploads to their cloud (or those you give their app access to) instead of your own.
*** Or, I could just use regular paper use the camera app on my phone, and use various file transfer tools I have already.
*** I'll stick to my wiki and chalkboard, thanks.
** In honor of the occasion, the Draft tag has been lifted from [[2019.04.13 - SLT: TOU2]]. There is only one gift that matters.
