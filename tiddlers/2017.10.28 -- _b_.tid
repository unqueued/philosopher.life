One reason I like Reddit is that I get to do my curation more directly. I at least have a modicum of control.

Maybe we should watch one TED talk a day. I don't know. Perhaps 1 each, and 1 together. That way we cover more ground. I don't know.

---

It is fascinating to see that my children spend their writing time writing stories/characters/universes for roleplay fiction. My wife, in her way, does the same.

---

My wife hates cleaning, organizing, and planning (unless it is incredibly short-term about something just for fun). She hates me when I ask her to do it. I must find a better way.

---

I am aware of that new-age spiritual advisor trope. It fits my context. But, I do not frown upon it. It is not as the fundamentalists would call it "Buffet Religion." As you can see, I am more principled in my approach than anyone I have ever met. I am not the hypocrite here, or at least no more so than any of the rest of you.

I'd like to point out that some of better work in the past couple weeks has been while I'm not on cannabliss!

---

I think I have an idea for how I hope to do my [[Links]] organization. I can migrate those links using the [[Link Log]] archetypal comments. In a sense, this is about going back in time to do it. Should I backdate them? Perhaps.

---

I'm reminded of a seminar in graduate school where I told my professor, Dr. Cogburn, that I aimed to study computer science, religion, and philosophy. He joked that my goal was to be a jedi. I do want to be a jedi lifehacker.

My wife's co-workers are very skittish at the though of piracy (so weird: they are fucking librarians). Furthermore, my explanation of how/who Tim Gunn portrayed himself as in the media was deeply redpilled and obviously disconcerting to them. 

Obviously, I am not someone they want to be friends with. That's a shame. I'm willing to openly disagree, and they aren't. The truth is too uncomfortable for them. They are unwilling to peer behind the veil.
