This is [[/b/]]ish, but I am curious about a change in my phenomenology. I may just be losing my mind, but I think I'm having a harder time visualizing many kinds of things. Is this due to my heavy usage of the wiki? Is my brain's plasticity being bent to think about myself and the world to perceive through this tool or in virtue of this tool?
