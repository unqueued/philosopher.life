My brother called me after a very long day. Work seemed okay, and his humor called out by his friend, Sarah. He wrote a two-page letter to the head of the union (I doubt they receive many such letters).

It's not open-and-shut with a smoking gun. Unfortunately, there's just enough nuance that my brother requires asymmetric good faith from a number of parties for justice to obtain. I would be surprised if that were to happen. 

We talked a lot about the power dynamics in his local. He's still turning down the money from the fund, his expectation that the contractor honor the union contract likely upsets the Good Ol' Boys club at the top, the journeymen he's spoken with about this problem who obviously don't have a clue why unions are necessary to the point they argue anti-union rhetoric (disturbingly mistaken and ignorant), and it may get him blacklisted (even his peers tell him that's what's going to happen) if he stands up in the hall to challenge this. We talked about the union's miseducation program, capitalist infiltration, CE/CW exploitation processes, my own thoughts on how I've seen the unions here operate, and speaking pseudonymously with the international union.

This is a contractor's union, and that's a huge problem. The union becomes an apparatus of capitalists as such. The union becomes a shell which functions as HR and management middlemen getting paid finder's and long-term handler's fees for exploiting scabs and offloading liabilities while a lucky subset of the union's employees (properly inducted, of course) are paid to look the other way in becoming the "settled in" bridges between the union's labor and the contractor. Sure, there's a disincentive for journeymen (though not the hall leaders and individual union-member suckasses loyal to and essentially bribed by the contractors [if they aren't already part owners]) to have too many CEs/CWs who are kept on during bear markets, but some threshold ratio is always preferred (especially to take on big jobs, hold some contracts, etc.). The union has a number of pressure points to contend with, and it appears to be hollowed out and subverted to some [[dok]].

The use of the funds, in this case, looks like hush-money to me. It's one thing to make him whole while continuing the pursuit and enforcement of his contractual rights (which is what the dues ought to be used for), and it's another to try to avoid enforcing the contract by smoothing it out the easy way. And, yet, I am not convinced my brother should fight this. It's hilariously like he needs a union inside the union to me, and I am reminded of corporate structures I've seen. There are enormous pressures to not: treat people equally in the union, build sustainable ladders which defeat double-standards, defeat inch-and-mile false compromises with integrity, maintain a rule of law in their domain, and radically fight against corruption of leadership. A sufficient percentage of the union has to be educated and fight against the seeds of reactionary and capitalist infections. 

At the same time, my brother feels gladness for being in a union at all but not the safety of being in a union that is functioning appropriately. My advice is to find other people in the union who actually believe in unions and bundles of sticks. If he cannot even rally enough support from a minor group, he's got no collective bargaining power either.
