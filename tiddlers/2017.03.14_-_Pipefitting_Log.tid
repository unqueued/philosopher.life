I actually became discouraged. My roots are really bad. I'm having a hard time figuring out the appropriate heat (amperage), the distance between flat plats, the bevel, how far to keep the stick down, the motion, the look of the keyhole, etc. I'm having a hard time getting the penetration around the edges I'm looking for. It's okay though. I'll get there.

Since it was just me, and the teacher didn't want to be there, he sent me home early, again.
