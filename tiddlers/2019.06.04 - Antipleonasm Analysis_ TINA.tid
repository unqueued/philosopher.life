!! Respond to the following gem:

Let's go back to our point of departure: the contested issues of freedom and rights, hence sovereignty, insofar as it's to be valued. Do they inhere in persons of flesh and blood or … in abstract constructions like corporations, or capital, or states? In the past century the idea that such entities have special rights, over and above persons, has been strongly advocated. The most prominent examples are Bolshevism, fascism, and private corporatism…. Two of these systems have collapsed. The third is alive and flourishing under the banner TINA—There Is No Alternative to the emerging system of state corporate mercantilism disguised with various mantras like globalization and free trade.

Preach, yo! 

I prefer to think of the appearance of freedom and rights of corporate agents as being reducible to properties and relationships among their constitutive atomic individuals. My concern, therefore, is about whether or not we should be handing such freedoms and rights to select individuals working in concert to form some emergent entity. There are cases in which we must. To some [[dok]], federation and partial centralization of power is going to be necessary to solve some classes of problems, and the rule of law is going to require enormous coordination. Obviously, however, I am opposed to the privatization of the state and the means of production.

The TINA banner drives me insane. People generally point me to the experts they hope are correct, but they do not stand up and directly defend their positions with me. It's a false monochotomy, a memeplex attempting to be a monopoly at any cost. I don't see why I shouldn't call it fascism.

I agree that "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others" at the bottom, but even federation and building proxy networks of trust on top of direct democracy is necessary and possible. Ironically, there are simply too many topics on which I need someone else, an expert, to represent me. This is also similar to "Don't bring your boss a problem unless you have a proposed solution," it is simply a power dynamic for saving your boss' face which comes with a boatload of gotchas and structural defects. 

Ruling out the possibility of alternatives to capitalism and essentially the centralization of power into the hands of the few requires justification, especially when it entails enslaving most of the world.
