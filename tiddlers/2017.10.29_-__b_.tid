I've been trying to find the source of my inability to sleep. It could be several things (or a mix). The above is one theory. What about the mini-fever experience last night? You had to turn the AC on to even get comfortable. You took something yesterday that you're trying to conserve: your probiotics. This is not the first time you've experienced it. Perhaps it is time to study that carefully. We can control that and test it. We can read about it too.
