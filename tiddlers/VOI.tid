The Veil of Ignorance is the cleansing threshold to the anti-luck contextualist's [[fff]] knowledge of [[Good]] and Evil. It is the condition we pay to enter into the unconditional metaethical holy of holies; it is the doorway to fairly defining justice qua the theoretical implementation of [[The Original Position]] heuristic. 

Passing behind the veil requires us to conceptually sacrifice our birth lotteries, hypothetically let go of our worldly possessions and identities, humbly pass through the doxastic eye of a needle into The P2P derived Republic of Righteousness,<<ref "c">> and imagine ourselves ignorant of our particular positions in the external world in order to [[phenomenologically]] emulate successfully wielding the [[ROG]].

The VOI is a dissociating device for stripping ourselves of our morally arbitrary characteristics down to a simulated blankish slate in order to exercise our moral autonomy (upon exiting) and compute the justified bottom-up social-contract-constructing association of self-anonymized individuals agreeing upon and applying the methodological pursuit of resolving fundamental disagreements and incompatibilities in our competing individual and emergent concepts of [[The Good]]. Only when we are equipped with the veil can we rightfully empirically seek the top-down model of [[The Right]] and hence determine the fitting structure of our society through reflective equilibrium dialectics. 

Slay yourself with pentacostal fire; burn away and reduce your selfish ego until you only see [[The Other]]. Only together can we recursively interpret [[The Golden Rule]]. Let us each wisely and transparently [[deconstruct and reconstruct|Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]] ourselves to collectively construct Heaven on Earth.
