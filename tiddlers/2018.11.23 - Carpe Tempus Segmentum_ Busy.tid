title: 2018.11.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Busy

* Woke at 9
* Fireman Time!
* Packed
* Quick argument about the centralization of power with [[R]].
* Traveled
* Sat with [[Charlie]] in his house (glad he let us in, we might be the first in a long time)
* Took him to lunch at Captain D's (man after my own heart)
* Went to Missy and Carl's
** Carl and I argued politics non-stop into the evening.
*** He said it made him angry when I predicted Trump's win before the primaries were over because he felt I was supporting Trump??? I clearly was voting for Bernie in the primaries and we talked about it (though I consider that man to still be a ridiculous compromise).
*** Carl is leaving DNC leadership in the area, calls himself a demsoc now (and likes Bernie...a shift from Shillary). He's a lot more cynical. Good. Let's see if he'll take the real plunge with me into the dark fucking reality we have. Our out is decentralizing power radically; that's it.
** Handed IRL-info card out.
* Traveled home
* Fixed the god damn wiki ;P
* Talked with [[JRE]]
* Estaban got our packages for us
* Played more dominion with my son.
* Read+Write
* Couch by 1
