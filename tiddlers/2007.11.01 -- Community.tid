title: 2007.11.01 -- Community

The word “Community” has a positive connotation. It is a warm, safe, and responsible expression. It is an object of caring complexity. Community serves as a step up, apart from the individual, to allow us to think of a group of individuals, usually in regards to needs, beliefs, and behaviors. This is a word we throw around a lot, perhaps to our injury.

Community is a word, I feel, that is slowly being twisted by post-moderns. It is a word twisted to the benefit of the post-modern, as if it lends credibility to their arguments. Community, as a meaning, is beginning to refer to a less logical construct and a more emotional one. Touchy-feely arguments are persuasive; and regardless of the lacking logical merit of the post-modern arguments, the relativists wield these words to great effect and influence. Arguments imbued with egalitarian, humanist nonsense, as found in the twisted use of the word “Community”, are dangerous and deform the proper perceptions of our purpose and identity. We must isolate and distinguish the exact meanings of weasel words, and I will start with this word: Community.

Current definitions are neither clear, nor completely tainted by the post-modern perspective. They are changing though, and they are being infected with the thoughts of the moral relativists. Our perception of the definition of community affects how we act within that context, and so we must be careful how we define it. The chosen must extract Community-ness if we wish to protect its truth-purity and disable the relativists’ attempt to convert us. If you have no idea what I mean by the post-modern undercurrent that is subverting the very nature of our understanding of community and our purpose, leading to the subversion of our communities and purpose themselves, then start with “Spheres of Justice”, with the subtitle “In defence of pluralism and equality”, a book written by Michael Walzer. Here you will be opened to a dangerous world of thought, one that denies the fundamental concept of absolute value and truth. It is here that the elite post-moderns begin their argument. This is the birthplace of the viral memes of relative-thinking that contaminate corporate and individual responsibility and value.

To arms, chosen slaves of the Word! We must win the thought-war if we are to survive and grow.

The word community is derived from the Latin communitas (meaning the same), which is in turn derived from communis, which means “common, public, shared by all or many”. Communis comes from a combination of the Latin prefix con- (which means “together”) and the word munis (which has to do with performing services).

Ironically, the original meaning is untainted and so very close to community-ness that it is scary. The modern world, even with the benefit of time which can often improve our understanding of a word or concept, has not distinguished this concept or brought us closer to the form of community; instead, the modern world has clouded the truth and even hindered us from reaching the meaning and purpose of this word. The ancient people, at least in this case, have a better handle on the meaning of the word than we do (where did progress go?…yes, we have congressed).

Generalized, a community is any number individuals or objects that share something or some set of things in common. Community-ness is the sameness found in particulars. It is the act of grouping commonality.

This seems fairly basic, as if it is too easy. However, some basic truths don’t necessarily simplify the world, they can help us to even make sense of the world in the first place. In this case, the actual number and types of communities that exist is actually very, very complex. This should remind you of Venn Diagramming.

Consider the people who live in Kentucky. This community is a sub-community/group of two sets. All that is contained in Kentucky and all people are combined to narrow and limit the meaning of both larger communities into a smaller one.

Now, consider the fat people in KY.

All Objects in Kentucky (A community itself)

All People

All Fat Objects

Narrowed into: Fat people in Kentucky.

Sadly, this is not too much different from “People in Kentucky”. Speaking of which, “People in Kentucky” and “Fat People in Kentucky” are two different communities, even if one is contained within the other.

In general, community acts as an identifier. Community gives us the logical relations between objects. Community, of course, is not bound by region or anything, but it requires at least a single commonality. Communities can be large or very, very small. They rely upon sameness in grouping, and that is the first concept to understanding community.

Community, at this point, sounds way too much like Venn Diagrams, the Forms, and just basic grouping. And, of course, it does rely upon these logic and definition systems. But, for “Community” to mean more than just “group”, and retain any useful meaning, it must be distinguished from just “group”. Community is distinguished from those logical grouping mechanisms in that it deals with a very specific type of group, a group so relevant to our discussions of purpose and value that we distinguish it and give it its own name.

The revised and more relevant definition becomes: A community is any number of morally culpable individuals that share something or some set of things in common.

‘The Community’ is comprised of all free individuals that are morally responsible for their actions and beliefs. All sub-communities are spawned from the commonalities found between members of The Community. The Community is more than just a group, it is special and set apart from all other groupings.

A community is a grouping of sameness as found in moral beings. It is here that we will find that a community becomes its own object. So, just as we can distinguish smaller communities from the larger ones by adding other commonality factors to limit the membership, we can also add up and group similar communities to form a new community obviously.

[Fat people in Kentucky] + [not-Fat people in Kentucky]=[People in Kentucky]

It is here, that Community develops its third requirement for relevant meaning. A community becomes its own object. Specifically, a community becomes its own morally culpable object or entity. A community derives a corporate moral responsibility from the morally responsible individuals that form the group. A community, at the very least, is the sum of the responsibilities of the individuals inside it. And, perhaps, moral synergy exists in a community in which even greater responsibility is required beyond the base sum. So, it may be the case that the total sum of moral responsibility of a community is greater than the sum of the individuals’ moral responsibility.

The revised and more relevant definition becomes: A community is any number of morally culpable entities that share something or some set of things in common.

Entity, of course, could be an individual or a sub-community. From this, we can logically conclude that there exists a:

Conjunction of All sub-communities that equates to “The Community”. It is the WHOLE of all possible morally culpable entities that comprise “The Community”.  The Community is an INDEX of all moral responsibilities in existence. This gets us to our final point.

Community is a measurement of moral responsibility and a required degree of value-seeking. Community-ness is relevant in distinguishing Individual and Corporate responsibility to rationally pursue value.

Community exists for the sake of rationally pursuing value, for being virtuous, and in virtue of the moral responsibility entailed with free beings and groups of free beings.

Neo-rationalists, Chosen people, Slaves of The God…you are a Community with a specific purpose and moral responsibility. Know your identity.
