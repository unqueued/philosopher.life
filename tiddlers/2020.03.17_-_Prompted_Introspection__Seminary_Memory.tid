title: 2020.03.17 - Prompted Introspection: Seminary Memory

!! What is one of your first memories?

Subject to my usual qualifiers about memory, including [[2018.05.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Two Parter]]:

I remember a brick hallway, a black rail, and an indoor ramp inside of some building of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary when I was ~4-5. I don't know if it is a memory of the same sequence or not, but I also remember learning the word "dusk" as we talked about traffic and safety on top of the mini-mountain/hill. I don't remember when, but I remember coming to understand that the people in the vehicles would have an even more difficult time seeing me with less light. That was a striking thing for me as an autist.
