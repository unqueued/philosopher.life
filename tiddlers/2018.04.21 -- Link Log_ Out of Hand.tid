* Stunning!

*** I was on that side of the fence for a very long time. Consciousness and what we attribute to it does have illusory features. That you are experiencing anything at all, and whatever it is may be unique to you, is not what I call into question. It does at least seem to largely reduce down to physical processes. Whatever is left is metaphysics. This is a very hard thing to do know. I appreciate the desire to shrink down our metaphysical claims, to be deflationary, but I'm also willing to posit them. I try to be cautious, but it turns out even my cautious narrow hose pushes out an infinity. For me, the problem of compatibilist and incompatibilism, of [[Fastmind]] and [[Slowmind]], of thinking of ourselves in timeslices of varying scopes, only makes it more confusing somehow. I do not know how to answer these questions, and unfortunately, I'm not able to shut the door on Dennett. Time and time again, he's right, and I begrudingly concede it.

*** Some excellent work here. Unfortunately, some of it is wrong.

*** This is dead on in some respects. I also think that part of what makes it so right is about the metaphysical nature of identity itself though. This is a lense to see it.
