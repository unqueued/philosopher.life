The Silly Epistemic Status Finger Signal System:

* Zero Finger Fist or Hand Us A Card
** Immediate Discussion Privilege. Emergency or must be introduced now.

* One Finger
** On the immediate topic, unlikely to branch unintuitively, a more closed kind of question or inspection, and belongs in the immediate area of our rabbitholing.
*** Also, shut the fuck up, Cratylus.

* Two Fingers
** I have a different branch, an unknown or unreliable indicator or path, a twisting or gunky metaphor, or a tangent to talk about, and it may take us into a completely different part of the rabbithole.

* All other fingers are for indicating the lack of importance, value, seriousness, or respect for the dialectic. Presumably, 3 fingers has a higher priority than 4. If you have 10, surely you must be telling me a dickjoke. Those who clown about like a mute jester with jazz hands bouncing up and down must surely have the lowest priority thing to say (don't forget to take a shit right there on the table in front of us or throw chickens, ok?).

Cards:

* X is my commitment. Take this, spend it at will. It is your specified social capital currency or contract with me. You invoke your right to activate my obligation in some respect.
* "STFU" Card
* "Prove It" Card
* "I Actually Tried" Card
* "I Need A Minute" Card
