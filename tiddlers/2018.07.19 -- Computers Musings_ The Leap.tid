title: 2018.07.19 -- Computers Musings: The Leap

I spent quite a bit of today going through my dot, config, script, key, and password files. I've organized the major things I want to install. I have a vague picture which is sufficiently specific to work as a plan and vision now.

EFI installation gave me some trouble, but that's okay.

* 120gb SSD
** 512mb Fat32 EFI
** 16gb linuxswap (yes, I use it)
** The Rest, ext4, mounted at /

* 1tb HDD
** ext4, mounted at /mnt/storage

* 250gb SSD
** ext4, mounted at /home

[[Install Resilio Sync in Manjaro As USER]]

`sudo pacman -S firefox firefox-developer-edition`

Logins, and setup Tiddlywiki backup extension. The wiki is operating.

Syncs setup, going lowercase moreso

Setup /home/h0p3/scripts

`sudo pacman -S cronie`

Setup crontabs

Set .bashrc for h0p3 and root... I hate vi. vim and I are square, but might as well just make it ridiculously simple with nano.

Used Pamac for...it handled failure very ungracefully. Looks like I should CLI this. Teamviewer install failed, key...

`sudo modprobe vboxdrv`

Set

Modified `/etc/ssh/sshd_config/`

```bash
sudo systemctl start sshd.service
sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
```

In case my daughter needs to get in.

```bash
sudo pacman -S python-pip
sudo pip install nacl
```

Verification works.
