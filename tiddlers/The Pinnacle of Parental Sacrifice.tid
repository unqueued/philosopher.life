title: The Pinnacle of Parental Sacrifice

My mom gave me a beautiful aphorism-poem when I came of age at 18.

<<<
There are two things you give your children:

One is roots

The other is wings
<<<

I think a lot about this poem. It is a lens through which to understand my mother and father. Knowing that they intentionally gave it to me makes it all the more complex. Being a parent myself, of course, only adds meaning to it. 

The gist of the poem requires analysis. My worry is that it allows us to say: "we gave you what you need" in all possible contexts. It does seem to have a deceptive shape to it. I say that realizing how beautiful it really is. It is not, however, an obvious Giving Tree.

My mother-in-law told me to "dig around in those roots." It is not lost on me.

I take it that my parting with my parents, the severance, is their way of being kind and loving. It is truly a sacrifice on their part.

We are building ourselves through our children. This isn't a fame and fortune problem. To empathize with the future really is to embed ourselves in the lives of our children. The giving tree is fundamentally right, only it explodes into more dimensions than you could possibly conceive of.
