* [[2018.07.04 -- Wuliheron: Fellow Nomad]]
** This failed...

** Dramatically. He's brilliant, but not capable of conversing with others effectively.
* [[TEOTWAWKI]]
** Storing it up.
* [[2015.01.06 -- Symbolic Logic: Final]]
** I'm always sad by how little ground I was able to cover in class.
* [[2015.01.06 -- Symbolic Logic: Midterm]]

* [[2015.06.27 -- Intro to Phil: Syllabus]]
** This was such an odd class to teach, and it satellite was clearly a diploma mill. It was morally reprehensible.
* [[2015.07.20 -- Intro to Phil: Paper Requirements]]
** I still have the papers they turned in. They are beyond terrible (I'm not picky either!).
* [[2015.07.06 -- Intro to Phil: Intro]]
