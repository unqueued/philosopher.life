title: 2017.12.14 - Realpolitik Speculation: The DNC Strategy

I have remarked on it before, but I will say it again.

The GOP has been thought to be dying for a long time. But, this is odd to say, given how they may control every branch of government. The DNC, of course, is in a position to clean house. They will continue to distance themselves from the Left. This //false compromise// is a concerted effort to not piss off their large donors (psychopaths who are financially conservative, of course), but also serves as a welcoming beacon to the "saner" conservative voter base of the GOP.<<ref "1">> The DNC continues to evolve into the new conservative party.<<ref "2">> With the leftists purposely pushed out in such public ways, this is a clear a signal to conservatives that the DNC intends to have a conservative-appealing set of representatives. If the GOP does implode, conservativism will not have died. The DNC will have vacuumed up the conservative voting base after "cleansing itself" of Leftists. I fear the false compromise "Rightist" solution/project will in fact have been completed. 

Furthermore, I've been disturbed to see the shareblue, progressive, insane DNC propaganda. It's incoherent, poorly argued, and obviously emotional rhetoric. They are clearly manipulating the masses in broad strokes. I would like to point out something that I (to my dismay) agree with in /r/darkenlightenment:

<<<
Secular progressivism is the memetic descendent of Puritan Calvinism. Blasphemy, inquisition, indoctrination, and brainwashing still occur from the perspective of the progressive religion. Therefore, progressive culture is referred to as “the Cathedral”. The Cathedral consists of influential people in politics, journalism, academia and education acting in an uncoordinated manner to advance progressive principles in society; often deceptively. We do not imply conspiracies.
<<<

This is either poorly worded or contradicts itself. However, if you can get past that problem, the phrase "uncoordinated manner" jumps out. I very much like this. It admits the truth without sounding crazy. It's not some black cabal of prescient Sith lords who have manipulated every detail, but events are also not accidental. I'm sure it's madhouse. But, there are people pulling strings, pushing agendas, and big fish in the sea. All is not as it appears as well.

Just as the DNC feels like the RNC have gone way past the line (or, at least have convinced or appealed to the Democrats I know of this), I think DNC have gone way past my line. I am so distraught by what I see. I weep before these empty shells. I see I do not know a practical way out of this problem.
