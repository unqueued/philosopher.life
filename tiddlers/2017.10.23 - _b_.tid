If you say "I didn't know I was crossing the line," I don't have charity. The goal is to try and demonstrate that you are trying to not cross the line, and then when you have a mistake I can be charitable to it. I think the first is often willed ignorance and the latter unwilled.

Is it a bad thing? Sure. You have no idea what metaethics is at stake here.

Assume psychological egoism is true. It clearly is an amazingly accurate description of our minds, even if it doesn't fit the way we want to think about ourselves (confabulation).

Why should we think prescription is even meaningful to us at all? Why would you think we are even moral agents? You're just going to do what you thought was selfishly in your best interest anyway. Without autonomy, you are kind of boned. It is the end of the freewill debate. I'm convinced even compatibilists are screwed here. I've yet to see any theory of autonomy hold water. Autonomy is a poisoned concept because it ultimately needs a source of being unprincipled, uncoerced, undefined, etc. Freedom requires faith. I see it taken up quite prudently. Forgive my cynicism of your motivations as well.

When is it wrong to be selfish, and why? Selfishness is the starting point. It's either amoral or immoral, and you need a damned good framework to show when it is moral. Go for it. I cannot justify it meaningfully. It's still just faith. 

Do you need different orders, kinds, or emergences of selfishness? Why should we agree to those, and do they really do the work you think they do?<<ref "1">>

To those detractors, tell me why you aren't open to the possibility that we are all fundamentally selfish creatures? I strongly doubt you can provide good alethic reasons, and likely only those which can be "verified" behind the Rawlsian veil, but not the Husserlian veil. In other words, you won't give me anything deductive and apodictic, and at best, you're going to have casuistry and democratic intuitions (wisdom of the crowds) which I quickly destroy through neurotribal redpilled memetic descriptions and the traditional tools of skepticism.

Cartoons are cheaper productions, and that means that they are more likely to be able to take risks on narratives and concepts that the average joe might not like. They can niche themselves much harder. There will be genius expressions which simply aren't risk-averse enough to be expressed in any non-cartoon medium (and plenty too risky even for a cartoon).

Will I ever lose access to books? If so, do I need to collect digital copies? Will piracy get harder?

<<footnotes "1" "Are you the emergent free thing? Maybe. You are the principle of your autonomy, and you are constituted by egoistic principles. Can selflessness emerge from it in any meaningful way? That is not obvious to me. Let me suggest the burden of proof is on you to show it.">>
