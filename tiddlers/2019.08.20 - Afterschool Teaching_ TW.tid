title: 2019.08.20 - Afterschool Teaching: TW

Whitney and I prepped quickly, and we just chilled. It was cool. I'm feeling more myself around her, and that's lovely. She's been busy with a wedding and baby shower for friends. Her school semester starts soon, and I will be on my own on Mondays.

I made extra today because it was pineapple. I know some of them will want seconds. I'm pleased with the number of people eating the carrots too (at least it is an improvement). 

Tons of one-on-one time in my opener. In general, it is my joy to sit with each student and talk. Some have something to say, and some don't. I saw 7 (count'em, SEVEN) books being read among my 40 students today at the lunch tables...my world is ending in bliss).

The 5th graders have complained that I don't get to take them, which is sweet. The 6th complain that I take them at all (my worst offenders are in this group). I had trouble with 6NP several times today; psychopaths in the making. Whitney handed her crew to me so she could go do whatever she was doing.

2v1 in magic, and I blew chilluns up. We had fun. Behavior was okayish in general, and I only whistled twice today.

I helped VPParker out today. I'm surprised by the hours he has decided to put in. I think he's still figuring out what it takes to maintain the role. We headed to the lab, and I told him I wanted to take the kids. I do not want his interference with their ability to use these machines. 

Someone gifted us pizza, after we split between lab and gym. 

7Lm and 7Cm and I jumped into TW today. Installed FF around the admin blocks, the PMario's extension, learned how to use our file explorer, talked about owning our data, walked through how they would use these as home, set up encryption, did the basics, and that was all we had time for. They were fairly quiet, but they got their hands dirty.

I smashed my paperwork and talked to Delp about a TV. I found one in the "breezeway" and took it into our room. We'll see what becomes of it.
