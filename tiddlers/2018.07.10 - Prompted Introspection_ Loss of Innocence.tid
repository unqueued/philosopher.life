!! When did you first realize you would someday be old or someday die?

My understanding of my death is something that I've iteratively grown. My death, and thus my life, is a dialectical matter to me. I can only assume my understanding will change, hopefully growing, improving, and making me happier (if I'm lucky). I first realized at a fairly young age; I do not recall ever not knowing (of course, I know I can't trust my memory). Growing up in a fundamentalist household, this was ingrained in me from the beginning. It has been a long, painful journey to understand my life and death in virtue of radically different lenses. But, hey, that's why I have a wiki.
