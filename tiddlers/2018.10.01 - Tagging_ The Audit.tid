title: 2018.10.01 - Tagging: The Audit

I can see that I am using some tags to effect. I want to squeeze 'em for the juice inside. I'm on the hunt now. I'm keeping a basic list in [[Tags]]. I want to make sure my complete [[Wiki Audit]] overall is going to include as much tagging as possible. I'm building threads and relationships in my content that I didn't or wouldn't otherwise have.
