!! Audit:

* Holy fuck, I read a lot.
* I have catholiconized some of this content.
* This month, more so than any other month so far, I have spent much of my curation and research time developing links for other projects on this wiki. I'm very proud of this.
* I feel like I send my wife too many treats/maymays.
* I love how there are several days which are brief. Getting something down, but not worrying about solving it all at once is a good triage tactic. I hope to continue developing this strategy in general.
* I am very suspicious of my readings now.
* Reading through again, I see how much influence this has had on the way I think and the other projects on this wiki. There's a narrative there, even if it's hard to see.
* Almost every title is about feeling overloaded and cleaning up. It really is a torrent of information I'm shoving down my gullet.
* Disconfirm My Bias is often weak or non-existant. I need to think more about this issue.
* Overall, I think I did a good job. I would love for most people to digest even a 10th of what I've done here.
