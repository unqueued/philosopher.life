title: 2019.11.07 - Afterschool Teaching: Smurf & Wtfpwnbbqsawce

Carson is having significant troubles getting the classes she needs due to some automated rejections. I outlined the steps she needs to take immediately. That girl is on the ball already, but she is not assertive enough. I've seen she laughs as a submission signal too. I hear that.

Whitney was late. Carson was in touch with her. She is a lovely glue.

Because I show up to one-on-ones early, I have the chance to sit next to children who aren't directly mine. I spoke with many today. Unfortunately, even showing up early, I didn't have enough time. Thankfully, I was handed all but the 5th grade, and I finished my work in the library. Behavior was reasonable, reading rates were low, homework was finished, but I had lots of real conversations with my public children.

5SD hugged me. He was happy we were going to the lab. 

Whitney and Carson took their favorites to the gym to watch the basketball game. I took everyone else to the lab! 

7CM is ideating. 

I pwned my children today, smurfing in their FPS game. They are beyond fucking awful. I clapped my console plebs (I despise the mouse they are forced to use). I am, of course, extremely proud of my ability to destroy tweens and teens in a shitty IO game. We had a blast. 

I spoke with plenty of adults today. Nothing out of the ordinary. We talked about unintuitive incentive structures in late pick-up penalties though.
