America's natural resources weren't created by humans. The basic social structures are obviously in virtue of sacrifices to the common good. Effective collectivist practices of [[The Golden Rule]] have enabled us to achieve enormous advances. Serving others just is the bedrock of a functioning society. Ironically, many of the people who immigrated to this country were fleeing the "productive genius" enslavement of those privatizing the commons. 

I do not deny that temporary and particular kinds of progress can be made through capitalism. The vast, vast majority of people rely upon publically generated goods, services, and institutions, and thus, so do the capitalists (even if only to subsidize their power seeking). She aims to hide the consequences of profiting off the exploitation of others. Fuck that. She will say anything to rhetorically justify the centralization of power.
