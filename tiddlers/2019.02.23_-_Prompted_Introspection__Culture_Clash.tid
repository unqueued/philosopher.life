title: 2019.02.23 - Prompted Introspection: Culture Clash

!! Tell about a cultural clash/experience you have had with a culture other than your own.

I am, of course, extremely culturalist. I don't think all identities in the material dialectic or memeplexes in [[The Great Human Conversation]] are equal or even valid. I seek that which is universal after we have shed our morally arbitrary characteristics (or simultaneously possess all of them in our weighing) behind the [[Veil of Ignorance|VOI]] while Bombadilling the [[Ring of Gyges|ROG]]. 

I see myself as realpolitik clashing with capitalists (including reactionaries) and anti-realist epistemologists right now (the two groups often go hand-in-hand). I cannot say I'm succeeding, but I can say I'm doing my best.
