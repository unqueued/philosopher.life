title: 2018.02.08 - Prompted Introspection Log: 3 Words About Me

!! What three words would describe you right now?

Stressed, Voracious, and [[h0p3]]ful

I discovered in my psychometrics yesterday that I am only moderately depressed and anxious. I am actually very stressed. I need to practice meditating more and focusing on the causes of my stress (making sure my offspring are effectively learning, finding a job, and the usual existential thing). Also, I need to go to bed earlier! I must force myself.

Speaking of: I am voracious. Generally, this is a good thing. There are, of course, negative effects. I need to find ways to relax that aren't boring to me.

Lastly, and I know you think it is cheaty-faced, but I invoke my own name as a powerful descriptor of myself. Your concern is noted. I spend a great deal of time defining myself though, see {[[About]]} and [[h0p3]], oh, and this wiki.
