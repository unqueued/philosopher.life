title: 2018.03.16 - Prompted Introspection Log: Home Rules

!! What are some rules you have to follow at home?

Be a good human. Be a good husband. Be a good father. Be a good housemate. Be a good pet steward. Be a good tenant. Be good. 

Oh, those don't have enough content to them? They are the correct answers though. I could continue to give you increasingly specific flesh to these without being losing the generic ambiguity that plagues you. 

Obviously, I must: clean up after myself, make sure I pull my own weight (which is considerable), help others in need, fulfill the roles that my family needs me to fulfill, plan ahead for and with those around me, comfort, build strong relationships, find enjoyment with these people, etc.
