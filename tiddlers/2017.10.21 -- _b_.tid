I associate my anxiety feeling with being high, existential thinking, and dealing with personal emotions quite a bit. There is a way in which I am oddly happy and exhilarated while I'm anxious. I want to know to what extent this is a good thing. There is an evolutionary basis for this, and I want to know if I'm handling this correctly given my context.
