!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I think I did well in social studies.
** I think that one of the ways in which you demonstrate that you care about humans is that you study a lot of different structures and stories. It's rare in most people. 
** I like that you try to take care of yourself a lot more than some other kids.
** I like that you're thinking about how to take care of your body.
* j3d1h
** I like that I'm starting to get better at coming up with concepts on the spot.
** I like that we make agreements and share meem. You and I are great friends as siblings.
*** You give a shit about each other as siblings. You make a highly integrated unit. I think you'll have a very strong bond, and that trust will be hard to break.
** You have been typing a lot this week. There's some kind of constructive work when you're typing.
** I'm glad that you've gotten over whatever block was keeping you from doing your school, and I hope to see that really take off.
* k0sh3k
** I had a lot of things to do this week, and I got them done.
** Thanks for heavily encouraging me to do my work. I guess.
** I am extremely grateful for your intervention with the kids this week. You've spent a lot of time on them. You very much practice real-time conversations with your loved ones.
** ~~Thank you for the car pies.~~ Thank you for letting us go to Books+Art.
* h0p3
** Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....umm...yeah, well..shit
** I've been in a people mood.
