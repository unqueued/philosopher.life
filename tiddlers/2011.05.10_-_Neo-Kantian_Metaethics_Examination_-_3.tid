''[1]''
In the Constitutional Model, from Plato, we get the analogy between the city and the soul. The claim of the analogy is that both are structured in a similar manner, particularly with respect to what it means to be a just or a good city and to be a good or well-formed person. In the city, going from the top to the bottom of the hierarchy, there is a guardian (philosopher king), next, are the auxiliaries who enforce the rule of the philosopher king, and finally, the craftsmen and workers. The guardians identify themselves with the city as a whole. They unify the city. The guardians identify their good with the good of the city as a whole. These tiered, functional classes of the city are supposed to correspond to functions and parts of the soul. Corresponding to the workers are the appetites, auxiliaries to the 'high spirited' part of the soul, and guardians to reason. 

The Constitutional Model is a powerful device in Korsgaard’s theory because if there was no constitution of the city, then it would be a mere heap. For the heap of people living in close proximity to be a city at all, they would have to be constituted or organized as a whole. Likewise, Korsgaard wants to make the same case for the soul. A similar hierarchy of psychological functions is said to take place.

The appetites make a proposal, and then reason must intervene to know what is and isn't acceptable. Once reason makes its decisions, then the spirit, which is always allied with reason (and never with appetites), executes and carries out what reason has decided. When you act, your action then is not just from the appetites or high spirit or reason, not from any of them alone, but rather from 'the whole person', from all three of these things working in concert. Thus, Korsgaard believes that the Constitutional Model analogously fits both the city and the soul.

Reason, for Korsgaard, isn’t just any type of rational capacity; it is explicitly the categorical imperative. We all seem to have innately the categorical imperative within us. Reason is not only within us, but it is also the principle by which we constitute ourselves. Odd questions arise from this initial view:

How can self-consciousness count as the "whole"? The whole doesn't seem capable of being self-conscious. What is the identity of the agent which is over and above the parts? What is the essence of the agent that allows her to say that agents can identify themselves with constitution? I don’t know how she can viably answer these questions, but they need explanations. Korsgaard believes she has synthesized (or even more boldly claiming she’s discovered a pre-existing analogy between) Kantian and Platonic views with her conception of the Constitutional Model. She says:

<<<
So if Kant does use the Constitutional Model for the soul, and the analogy holds, he is committed to rejecting the despotism of reason.<<ref "2">> 
<<<

	Does the analogy between the constitution of the state and Korsgaard’s conception of the constitution of the soul hold? If it doesn’t, then Korsgaard’s theory is obviously in trouble. I think there is a serious flaw in the analogy of the city and the soul. 

Notions of responsibility differ between the Constitutional Models of the soul and of the city. Who does the work of unifying a city? Clearly, all the agents of that will be a part of the city. Corporate responsibility exists in virtue of the individual responsibility which underlies it. Corporate agency (if exists at all) requires individual agents to constitute it. The city is unified and constituted by its many agents. But, this is a fundamental difference in the analogy of the Constitutional Model of the city with Korsgaard’s conception of the human constitution. The parts which are combined and unified in human constitution aren’t individual agents – those parts don’t choose anything. When I point to the city and say, “who is doing the work of unifying?” I can easily say that all the agents in the city are working together, that they have chosen to constitute the city. Obviously, there wasn’t a city to constitute itself before there was a city. I know who is responsible for these actions in the Constitutional Model of the city. But, this analogy doesn’t hold for the individual constitution. The various desires and ‘parts’ of the person aren’t agents, and they can’t choose to constitute themselves as a whole into a larger organism. Unification of the city is vastly different from unification of a person then. ‘Action’ of a corporate agent like a city is not really analogous to the ‘action’ of an individual person/agent either. To whom can I point and say “you are responsible” for unifying yourself? To a mass of people who aren’t yet constituted as a city, I can say, “each of you as individuals are responsible.” But, I can’t say that for the ‘parts’ of a person. Korsgaard must offer an account of agency and responsibility which pre-exists this unification and constitution.  

Does Kant actually use the Constitutional Model for the soul, and must he really be against the second version of the Combat Model?<<ref "2">>  It isn’t clear why we should think that Kant would disagree with the notion that ‘if an agent selects reason, then they can never select passion’ (roughly the second Combat Model). Korsgaard’s argument on behalf of Kant against the second Combat Model boils down to a rejection of the presupposition “that the person already identifies with reason.”<<ref "3">>  But, problematically, it seems that the same can be said against the Constitutional Model. It seems that you can't select anything or be effectively constituted by anything but reason. In Korsgaard’s Constitutional Model, the definition of person seems to presuppose identification with reason.  

But, now I’m not even really sure what she means by the ‘despotism of reason’ that wouldn’t also apply to her model. Even if (however it might work) both Kant uses the Constitutional Model and the analogy holds, is he really committed to rejecting the despotism of reason? Is this despotism of reason as bad as Korsgaard seems to think? She wants to deny that some ‘part’, inside or outside the agent, is the locus of causation, causing the agent to act and will. If this were the case, in her view, then it wouldn’t be the agent ‘as a whole’ acting and willing. But, I think there might be a bit of ‘eat your cake and have it, too’ syndrome going on here. I just don’t see a plausible account of her dual conception of “I.” I don’t see a plausible account of reason being anything other than despotic in the proper agent. If reason, inclinations and desires are equal, then why should I disagree and disregard my inclinations and desires when I need to do moral action? I can't believe that reason isn't in the ruling sphere, that inclinations don’t have to be under the jurisdiction of reason if one is going to be a moral agent. Kant doesn’t seem to be against the despotism of reason. He thinks there are no inclinations or desires in the intelligible realm because they are governed by nature.<<ref "4">>  In the Kantian picture, it isn’t clear how an agent is a proper self if he isn't identified with his reason. The example of the sad philanthropist makes so much more sense if we can accept the disunity between his desires, inclinations, and reason. Only actions performed from duty generated by reason alone rather than from any degree of inclination have moral worth.

Korsgaard continues:

<<<
True unity requires a constitution, which makes it possible for a whole to rule itself, and the merely apparent or empirical unity that is achieved when one part rules another is just a poor earthly substitute for that. That applies to the person as much as to the state.<<ref "5">> 
<<<

What is the difference between false unity and true unity? Likely, what is meant by “merely apparent or empirical unity” is what counts as false unity. I worry that false unity is outright not unity at all, in any degree. I doubt Korsgaard really wants to agree to lesser degrees of unity as possessing any true unity. But, a binary view, of true and false, does not lend itself to any meaningful degrees of unity, which is so vital to her theory.

 A charitable reading might lead us to say that at one end of a spectrum there is the one true, 100%, perfectly formed unity, and the rest of the spectrum demonstrates varying degrees of disunity, which counts as false unity or “merely apparent and empirical unity.” At the other end of the spectrum, there is 0% unity; there is a mere heap, pure anarchy. I’m not sure if it is correct to say that the mere heap is even false unity, because, in some sense, it isn’t even trying to be unified at all. 

This passage seems to imply (perhaps contrarily to the rest of the argument) that one can be falsely unified without a constitution. Can a degree of unity be achieved without a constitution? From the rest of the book, I would think that any degree of unity requires a constitution. Are there constitutions for the mere heap? I think not – mere heaps definitionally have no organization. 

Don’t we require a certain sort of constitution rather than merely ‘a constitution’? False unity, for Korsgaard, is based upon constituting oneself with the wrong principle (not the CI). Assuming there are different ways to constitute ourselves (using different principles), what makes one sort of constitution better than another? In particular, what is it about the sort of constitution using the Categorical Imperative that enables ‘true unity’ where other sorts of constitutions using other principles do not? And, if the previous question rests upon the false premise that only a constitution based on the Categorical Imperative can enable true unity, and there are many sorts of constitutions which can bring about true unity, then why should we think the constitution based on the Categorical Imperative is any better than a constitution based upon another principle? 

What about the constitution makes it possible for a whole to rule itself? Korsgaard believes that only the CI-based constitution is sufficient for true unity, and I think by implication, she would agree to the notion that only the CI-based constitution is sufficient for ‘a whole to rule itself’. But, this only brings up questions of responsibility, again. If a ‘whole isn’t ruling itself’, then why should we think that a unified, poorly constituted person (whatever ‘that thing’ is - I’m not even sure if we can seriously point to an ‘it’ in her theory) is really ruling itself in any culpable manner? At best, there are degrees of responsibility. But, then, it seems that the as we across the spectrum of good action to bad action, the less we can pin an action on a ‘so-called’ agent. That does not seem acceptable. I think cold-blooded murderers (let’s assume they are deeply disunified) are fully responsible for the act of murdering, just as I am fully responsible for the omission of murder (a good thing)!

In the end, I think Korsgaard fails to show us why there is any normative requirement for unity. I can understand reason overriding my biological desires, inclinations or passions, and in this sense I have ‘control’ over them. But this type of control is really not the same thing as the capacity to unify myself which Korsgaard is talking about. I think reason often requires us to be disunified. I don’t think we are really responsible to unify any objects which nature controls; we aren’t responsible for unifying them because we don’t possess the capacity to do it. We do have the ability to suppress them; to bypass them; to choose and act upon what reason requires of us; even when it is at odds with what we feel, and what our bodies desire.

Lastly, she says:

<<<
So for Kant, just as for Plato, reason must rule for the good of the whole, and if we identify with the voice of reason, it is only because we identify with our constitution, and it says reason should rule.<<ref "6">> 
<<<

What counts as the good of the whole person? This points to a substantive conception of the good which Korsgaard should have fleshed out (although, admittedly, she so heavily favors a formal conception that I don’t know how she could provide a substantive one). Furthermore, I’m worried that right action doesn’t necessarily lead to the good of a whole person. It might, for example, require the sacrifice of that person. Would Kant really agree to the notion that reason inside a person is ruling for the good of the whole person? Perhaps the legitimacy of reason is not that it rules for the good of the whole person, but rather that it is independently and objectively legitimate, even if it isn’t for the good of the whole person. 

I continue to worry about this analogy. Justice for a city, at least in Platonic eyes, really might not be concerned with the good of other cities. But, this is very different from a kingdom of ends perspective, whereby agents must be concerned, in some sense, with the good of other agents. 

Who is doing the ‘identifying with’ - the whole, a part, the sum of the parts? It isn’t even clear what it means to identify with our constitution. Korsgaard claims that identifying with our constitution is both sufficient and necessary for identifying with the voice of reason. But, what if you identify with a constitution which isn’t a CI-based constitution? We aren’t given a clear explanation of the manner in which a person’s constitution says reason should rule a person as a whole. It seems very possible in her theory that there can be a different (non-CI-based) constitution which says something else, something other reason, should rule a person as a whole. The only reason we believe reason should rule is because we’ve begged the question. 

''[2]''

	Good action is a well-defined and plausible concept in Korsgaard’s book //Self-Constitution//, particularly given how good action fits in with the rest of her theory. In contrast, bad action or ‘defective action’ is not a well-defined concept which fits nicely into her theory. The notion of defective action either fails to meet the expectations of our moral intuitions or it contradicts her theory at large.

	[Objection #1] Evil unification seems possible in her theory. If there is evil unification, then it doesn’t seem like it is really evil at all, as we typically understand the word. And, if evil agents can be unified, then their actions aren’t evil either because their actions are unifying them. If I’m right, then there isn’t a strong enough distinction between evil action and good action in her theory. Good and evil don’t seem to have any real meaning. Good and evil are just perceptions; they are subjective notions. Good and evil are constructions, not truths, in her theory. If they are truths, they are empirical ones about unification, but then she lacks any substantial evidence that her principle is the empirically the best one.

	She argues for degrees of unity. And if unity is the normative metric in her overall theory, then why should we care what principles of constitution get us there? If principle A unifies just as well as principle B, then they are normatively equal in this theory. And, even if principle A is not as good at unifying as principle B, as long as principle A still generates some degree of unity, then isn’t principle A good to some extent, just not as good as B? These are consequences of her theory, but not consequences to which she wants to admit. The CI might unify a person 100%, and principle A might do it 90%. It seems that principle A is almost as good as CI – it is ‘mostly’ good, right? She doesn’t want to admit that. It looks like wishful thinking to me. It seems that other principles really do have a chance at unifying us as well as the CI, and the actions which come from those other principles should be just as good because they are just as good at unifying us.

	Furthermore, the claim that the Categorical Imperative unifies us is a gigantic empirical assumption. I’m far from convinced we are unified by the Categorical Imperative. The sorts of actions which the CI compels us to do often might not be the sort which unifies us. Since unity is the normative metric of her theory, I think her choice of the Categorical Imperative as the correct principle and the definitions of good and defective action in her theory are wishful thinking, unsupported by some desperately needed evidence about how these really unify us.

	She might argue that good unity, good constitution, good agency, and good action are good ‘by definition’ and likewise evil unity, evil constitution, evil agency, and evil action are evil ‘by definition’. But this option isn’t open to her – it requires her to talk about moral truths which are independent of us. She closed herself off from that when she criticized the dogmatic rationalist. To go this route would make her subject to the very criticisms she made against the dogmatic rationalist – namely, having objective moral truths. If it is open, it is only empirically open – we don’t know what principle actually unifies us best, and whatever that principle turns out to be, we might ‘definitionally’ call the Categorical Imperative, but it might call us to perform action which is nothing like the traditional conception of the Categorical Imperative. 

I think she knows her theory is in trouble if it can’t muster any objectivity, but I think she’s waving her hands trying to make it work. Good and evil are likely fleeting constructions. Serious moral realists will undergo vertigo when trying to make sense of what she’s doing here. 

	[Objection #2] People who perform evil action aren’t technically people. They aren’t responsible – they aren’t agents – they aren’t even performing action. There is no evil action.

	Again, it seems like being unified is ‘by definition’ good in her theory, and we assume that unified people, ‘by definition’ don’t perform certain acts which we generally as a human race call ‘evil’ (like murder). If ‘by definition’ unified agents never do what is wrong – they must be perfectly virtuous, and furthermore, if a ‘heap’ happens to do what we call ‘evil’, and thus that heap isn’t fully unified, then that heap isn’t an agent. Non-agents, mere heaps, aren’t responsible. There is nothing, no ‘whole being’, there to bear responsibility. 

	Disunified people aren’t responsible. Defective actions aren’t truly actions, and those who commit them aren’t truly agents. We can’t point to any bad action, or to any bad agent and say “they did it.” Or, to the extent that we can, and to the extent that a bad action is an action, and to the extent a bad agent is an agent, they aren’t truly bad. If you can point to it, if you can say “it is more than a mere heap, there is a semblance of a whole there,” then by the normative metric of unity, it definitionally isn’t bad. 

	[Objection #3] I’m objecting to part of her defense against some of the objections I’ve already raised. Consider the following passage:

<<<
As far as tyrants are concerned, I’m not sure what to say—but then no one knows for sure what to say about the responsibility of some of the characters I’ve classified as tyrants—serial killers and addicts, for instance. But to the question whether the others become less responsible as they approach the tyrannical condition, the answer is no. There is no general principle saying that you are responsible to the extent to which you acted.<<ref "7">> 
<<<

Replace “you acted” with “you are an agent” and it becomes clearly incorrect. Agency is entirely about efficacy and responsibility. But, since the degree of action is literally a measurement of the degree to which you are an agent, then the general rule is true, at least if she is correct about the relationship between action and agency (I think it would wiser to separate these notions). She continues:

<<<
What we are going to blame you for is not that other force that was working in you or on you, but for the fact that you let it do that, that you failed to pick up the reins and take control of your own movements. And the reason we are going to do that is that making yourself into an agent, giving yourself an identity, becoming a person, is your job (1.4.9).8
<<<

If you are responsible for not being an agent, or for not being a unified agent, then who is this ‘you’? And isn’t this overarching ‘you’ that is responsible for whether or not you are an agent (in her theory) also an agent? Isn’t what we mean by agency – a type of irrevocable responsibility to act and to be in a certain way? This brings us back to the of paradox agency which she failed to solve. In the event, becoming a ‘unified agent’ is a responsibility that must necessarily lie with some agent – and that agent must, in her theory, be a unified agent in order to perform that action, making the entire thing circular; ascribing responsibility or blame for omission of an action or performance of a bad action, therefore, becomes impossible – either the agent was originally unified in a way impermissible to her theory or was disunified and, therefore, not a responsible agent. 

''[3]''

Korsgaard is worried about the ‘big mistake’ of approaching a disunified city or person as ‘one city’ or ‘one person’. She considers a problem posed by Derek Parfit.9 Parfit’s story is about a young Russian nobleman who in the future will come into his inheritance, and he wants to make sure that his future, older self will do the right thing by giving a large portion of his inheritance to the poor. The young nobleman is worried that his older self will be a different person, with different values, and in Korsgaardian terminology, he has a different set of contingent practical identities; the younger nobleman believes he will become an uptight and selfish, yet (supposedly) ‘rational’ and ‘self-controlled’ person who won’t give to the poor. The younger nobleman sets out against the older nobleman (his future self that somehow isn’t really, essentially him), trying to strategically force the older nobleman to give his inheritance to the poor. Korsgaard describes the strategy:


<<<
So he makes a contract now, to distribute the land when he gets it, which can only be revoked with the consent of his wife, and he asks his wife to promise not to revoke it then, even if he tells her then that he has changed his mind, and that she is released from the promise…Parfit portrays him as telling his wife that his younger self is his real self, that his ideals are essential to him, and that if he loses those ideals she should regard him as effectively dead. Being dead, he cannot release her from her promise, and if his middle-aged avatar claims to release her, in an effort to keep hold of the estates, she should regard him as someone else, who therefore cannot release her –almost…as a kind of impostor, posing as the continuation of his younger self.<<ref "10">> 
<<<

If the younger nobleman’s prediction about ‘who he will become’ is wrong, then she won’t need to force him to do anything. However, if his prediction is correct, then this strategy, if it works as he intends, will force the older nobleman to give to the poor, which is against the values and normal (so-called) rational choice that the older nobleman would have otherwise made, namely to keep the inheritance.

Several problems immediately arise from Parfit’s story. Is the older nobleman really being rational? Does the younger nobleman have the right to obligate his future self, and if he doesn’t, then what does that say about obligations in general? Is the younger nobleman really a different agent than the older nobleman – does his agency lack continuity through time? Is it really a bad thing for the younger nobleman to lock himself, or the older nobleman (if w-=]e read him as a different agent) into doing what is objectively the right thing?

The wife has another set of related problems. Can she really make this promise to the younger nobleman? Is she doing wrong against the younger nobleman when she ‘breaks her promise’ to him by not forcing the older nobleman to give to charity? Is she she doing wrong to the older nobleman when she fulfills her promise to the younger nobleman, but perhaps forces the older nobleman to give to charity? 

I want to make it clear that I think there is a lot at stake in this story and in answering it – a proper response comes with a lot of meta-ethical baggage. Definitions of agency, action, choice, obligation, rights, and value are exemplary issues at stake which this story brings up. There are also some powerful metaphysical and ontological questions at stake in this ethics story, including the metaphysical nature of property and social contracts, and multiple concerns about object identity and agent identity. The consequences to answering these questions incorrectly have a profound reach and impact. In some sense, I can’t hope to offer the proper (read: effective) response, which includes a comprehensive countertheory, to what Korsgaard and Parfit are doing here. I can “give you the skinny” on some of things they’ve done wrong though, which is only a glimpse of what should be said about this problem.<<ref "11">>

Parfit’s problem, a problem based on the assumption that the younger and older noblemen are two different agents, requires us to make sense of their capacities as agents to bear rights and duties, in part by trying to make sense of the wife’s (possibly differing) obligations to these two agents. Korsgaard tries to re-tell this story of ‘successive selves’,  with her own meta-ethical baggage, in terms of division of a self, an internal conflict, and ultimately, in terms of disunity and a lack of integrity on the part of the nobleman/noblemen.

In setting out to answer Parfit’s problem, Korsgaard introduces a Kantian (and traditional Judeo-Christian) conception of marriage, a joint-ownership contract whereby two spouses maintain a complete “reciprocity of possession” of each other and each other’s belongings.<<ref "12">> She emphasizes this transaction as a “unity of will” in which:

<<<
Two people who get married pledge to share one another’s lives and possessions; there is therefore a range of decisions that they pledge to make together—decisions about where they will live, decisions about the house, the car, the children, and the money—including the disposition of those inherited estates.<<ref "13">>
<<<

From this ‘unity of will’, Korsgaard claims that “the Russian nobleman’s wife cannot operate as an independent person free to choose now between two loyalties,” the loyalties of the younger and the older noblemen.<<ref "14">> These two spouses are supposed to have a unity of will. But, as Korsgaard points out, it doesn’t seem like they really have a unity of will. As this one man is actually two men, is there a unity of will between three people? That doesn’t seem to be the spirit of a marriage at all. Is she married to the younger nobleman, but not the older? Or, is she even married to either of them at all? I think it might be reasonable to say there is a difference between the Kantian marriage and a legal marriage. 

Korsgaard says “he cannot make the decision together with himself…”<<ref "15">> This decision is about what should be done with the future inheritance. If he cannot decide, then husband and wife certainly can’t decide together either. Note that it is not immediately clear who this ‘he’ might be. It could be the younger nobleman with himself, the older nobleman with himself, and/or with the younger nobleman with older nobleman. Interestingly, Korsgaard says:

<<<
The young nobleman asks his wife to commit herself, to make a promise, and to keep her promise in the future. She is to hold him, by holding herself, to giving up the estates. But if she can do this, why can’t he?<<ref "16">>
<<<

The assumption is that the wife will maintain her identity and commitments through time, even though he won’t. And, further, from Korsgaard’s theory, maintaining one’s identity is maintaining one’s contingent practical identities, one’s agency, one’s reasons for acting, one’s normative obligations and rights. In this case, it is an identity for keeping of a promise (to her husband no less) and a commitment to give to the poor which the wife is capable of maintaining, and for the husband, it is simply the will to give to the poor, which he somehow isn’t capable of maintaining. Because he lacks a capacity to maintain a commitment with himself to give to the poor, Korsgaard implies we should question his ability to make commitments or promises in general. Even the couples’ marriage vows appear in jeopardy. I think this might be too large a leap. 

By unity of will, do we mean they never disagree and that they don’t have any conflicts concerning property distribution? I don’t see any marriages that can always qualify without fail as that. If unity of will is only the singular moment where both completely agree, completely give themselves to their spouse, then it seems that this unity is fleeting. Unity of will might really be a commitment to ‘making it work’, to putting forth maximal effort to resolve disagreements in the most loving fashion possible. When both spouses are in agreement on that point, well then, I think we are really talking about marriage here. Not being capable of knowing what exactly to do with property, having a conflict with either yourself or your spouse, doesn’t seem to revoke marriage in any degree. 

Vitally, Korsgaard say about that wife: “if she approaches her husband as one person, she’ll be making a big mistake.”<<ref "17">> This can be taken in two ways. Either the nobleman is really two different noblemen (younger and older persons), and thus not one person, or the younger nobleman is simply divided and in conflict with himself, and thus the younger nobleman is really not one person. In the first way there is not ‘one person’ because there are two persons in one body over time, and in the second way, there is not ‘one person’ because there isn’t a person (let alone two). Parfit agrees to the first, and it seems that Korsgaard is tempted to head in the other direction. It makes a lot of sense in her theory if there is an immediate conflict and disunity in this younger nobleman. But, if this is the interpretation, I think she’s re-written who this ‘younger nobleman’ really is – he seems much less rational and put together in Korsgaard’s re-telling than in Parfit’s. However, there is also decent reason for her to interpret it like Parfit, and to say that the younger nobleman has one identity, and the older nobleman a different identity. But, then she is committing the same egregious mistake about lacking persistent agency that Parfit does – in some ways, this is already present in her theory, as we can shed and take on contingent practical identities, including (supposedly) our agency, and thus our moral obligations, at whim. 

Korsgaard claims that a married couple deliberates together and arrives at a shared decision.<<ref "18">> She explains: 

<<<
The aim of the shared deliberation…is to find (or construct) a shared good, the object of our unified will, which we then pursue by a shared action. And it follows from the fact that the action is shared that if either of us fails [to perform our proposed shared action]… we will both have failed to do what we set out to do. Our autonomy and our efficacy stand or fall together.<<ref "19">>
<<<

If this is true, then it doesn’t seem that the younger nobleman and his wife really have joint autonomy or efficacy. They lack unity of will and they lack shared deliberation. They aren’t married, at least not with respect to this issue (perhaps Korsgaard would argue for degrees of marriage), on this view. She sidetracks the discussion briefly by saying:

<<<
If I treat your reasons as reasons, they may change my mind about what counts as the best outcome… But if I treat your reasons as tools and obstacles, they will come into my deliberation in a different way—I will see whether I might use them as tools in the pursuit of my own ends, or if not, if they are obstacles, then I will try to determine whether I can remove them from my path.<<ref "20">>
<<<

This is a very potent statement. A whole discussion is centered around what it means to treat others as persons/agents (ends) with their reasons as your reasons vs. treating them and their reasons as tools and obstacles (means). The nature and normativity of interaction is at stake. Korsgaard relates this talk about warcraft to the story of the Russian nobleman. She says: 

<<<
And this of course is how the Russian nobleman is related to himself. He doesn’t think of his future reasons as reasons—he thinks of them as facts to contend with, as tools and obstacles, and in his case mainly obstacles—and he is therefore in a condition of war with himself. His efforts as a young man are dedicated to ensuring that his younger self wins, and his older self loses. His soul is therefore characterized by civil war, and that is why he fails as an agent, and his younger self cannot be efficacious without the help of his wife. But for the same reason he, his whole self now, is unable to interact with his wife.<<ref "21">>
<<<

It seems that one can interact with one’s present self, one can interact with one’s future self, and one can interact with other persons. In this passage, in seems that the younger nobleman is interacting (or rather, he is failing to interact as he should) with himself as an older nobleman. In one sense, Korsgaard is arguing for a persistent identity – she wants the younger and the older to be one person over time. But her argument ‘for a persistent identity’ isn’t that it is necessarily the case that they are one person (which is what I think is the only sensible thing to argue), but rather that they merely should try to be one person. She continues: 

<<<
As an embodied being [he as an agent] must take into account all of the incentives, present and future, to which [he] will be subject in the natural course of [his] embodied life: that is part of what Plato means when he talks about willing for the good of the whole.<<ref "22">>
<<<

How can you know what your future holds? How can you know (which is a precondition to taking into account) your future incentives? Interaction makes sense when it is simultaneous, but it doesn’t make sense through time. You can’t interact in any meaningful sense with your future self. I’m convinced that she is in some sense agreeing to unification through time (although, later we’ll see she doesn’t want that). Korsgaard doesn’t have the same problem I have with Parfit’s story – she agrees that his agency is in jeopardy. She continues:

<<<
The Russian nobleman fails as an agent because… he doesn’t will a law that he thinks he can commit himself to acting again later on, come what may.<<ref "23">>
<<<

<<<
His future self is just himself. He can decide to disagree with his own future attitude. But unless he is then also prepared to regard his own future attitude as one of weakness or irrationality, he is not according the reason he himself proposes to act on right now as having normative standing. For he is not making a law for himself unless he thinks of his future attitude as a violation of that law, and if he does not think he can make laws for himself then he lacks self-respect.<<ref "25">>

So his problem is not his disunity with his future self, but his disunity with himself here and now. And his problem is not disrespect for his future self, but disrespect for himself here and now.<<ref "26">>

So, the reason he is disunified in the present is he doesn’t find his future self to be irrational. I don’t think that really answers the story. A prediction that my views or values will change is not that same thing as my advocacy of their rationality or irrationality. We can fine tune the story. Perhaps he has his mind 100% made up (and unified) at time-t0 to A, and just so happens in the future to have his mind 100% made up at time-t1 to ~A.  His younger t0 self thinks that his older t1 self is wrong, irrational, and immoral. But, this doesn't sound like necessitation. That just sounds like he shed and gained a new contingent practical identity, he changed his mind. He’s not really in conflict with himself. 

[Objection #1] If Korsgaard argues for unification through time, she’s expecting the younger nobleman to know himself in the future, and unify himself through time, then she is expecting something which is impossible, something which is out of his present reach. If she argues that there isn’t unification through time, but really, he’s disunified in the present, and the older nobleman isn’t the same agent, then she’s demolished persistent agency. I can’t accept either one.<<ref "26">>

Unification through time is interesting because it maintains some semblance of a persistent identity (which I think is cardinal to the work we are doing here). But, unification through time as an action doesn’t make sense. I really don’t think Korsgaard agrees to this notion, even if she toys with it – she, herself, knows it has controversial (probably insurmountable) problems. It would also contradict aspects of her own theory at large. Unification through time basically prevents the shedding and taking on of contingent practical identities. 

If agency doesn’t persist in the case of the nobleman, then the nobleman’s life is split into (at least) 2 lifetimes, two agencies, two sets of responsibilities – he is broken into two people. But aren’t we all subject to this? We are schizophrenic, and useless through time. When we change our minds enough (where that point may be, I’m still unclear), when we shed enough contingent practical identities, we are no longer ourselves. No practical system of ethics can be made from this stance on agency. Agency must be persistent, or obligations through time are arbitrary, superfluous, and ridiculous.

Obligations through time become incoherent if we lack a consistent, stable identity/self/agency through time. Duties or rights of the person do not pass through time to whomever they 'evolve' into; whatever contingent practical identity they eventually take on, sheds all obligations. Isn’t agency the very type of thing that remains stable? It is that which enables obligations to pass through time, from one contingent practical identity to another. Agency isn't a choice, it lasts a lifetime. To say that 'killing yourself' is a way to shed your agency is tongue-in-cheek; but it isn't obvious how one might actually 'choose' to shed their agency otherwise. Agency is not a choice; it is not something which you constitute yourself as. You are innately an agent or you aren’t, it isn’t up to you. Agency is the very thing that enables you to have anything else to be ‘up to you’ – but agency as a capacity isn’t something that is up to you. Your plight is not your choice. 

How are we to treat the disunified? [Objection #2] The constitutional model she presents in this book dehumanizes and strips personhood and the rights which follow from it away from the disunified. In the case of the Russian nobleman, he is less of a person, less of an agent, not as good as a human, and less worthy of our interaction. He doesn’t deserve to be treated as well as a full-blown unified agent; he can’t actually be treated (according to her theory) that way by definition, since he lacks the capacity to be a person. In some sense, he is like the mere heap – he is rubbish, so, go ahead, dispose of him! 

By her theory, people who don’t respect themselves as people aren’t really people, and so we don’t have to (because “we can’t”) respect them either. Now, you might say I’m exaggerating the point – she does after all have a theory which comes in ‘degrees’. But, my criticism is applicable, even in degrees. The degree to which a being isn’t an agent, the degree to which he is a mere heap, is the degree to which we can’t interact with him and treat him as an end. Mere heaps, in any degree, are tools and obstacles, not ends.

So, the nobleman is, at least to some degree, disunified and, to that degree, cannot be treated as a person, as an agent. The wife, then, cannot be obligated to some degree (and perhaps to no degree) to him. Regardless of whether he is disunified through time, or disunified in the present as a younger nobleman, he’s still not worthy. I just don’t see how he is an illegitimate person to any degree. Korsgaard’s interpretation alongside her theory requires it.
