Hi h0p3,

Re: Uncertainty as to times that are convenient to call, let me erect a few stone markers to increase the legibility of the landscape (absolutes, I cannot offer, only rough probabilities).

Generally the best times to call are between 5:30 and 9 PM. 

I actually liked you calling me as I was finishing up work. It's a nice sort of inbetween time where I've finished one thing and haven't yet begun another. There are also all sorts of cozy, dark places to crawl into. 

In terms of days I am available, generally, the higher the number, the better the odds:

"""
50% | Sunday  
75% | Monday
40% | Tuesday
2%   | Wednesday
55% | Thursday
30% | Friday
40% | Saturday
"""

There are no penalties for calling at an inopportune time, and it would be helpful for me to know what your no-fly zones are as well.

I intend to give 06.25 Chickenscratch a thorough read around New Year. There are some things I already want to say, but I'll refrain until I get a chance to digest it in its entirety.

Also, thank you for the article on paleo-film-making. Animal scapula is not a medium I'd ever seriously considered, but it demonstrates something of our insane need (from an animal's perspective) to transform our environment to reflect the inner experience of our processing of our environment (take that thought, split it in two, and spin!).

That Horse at la Marche reminds me of this :)
