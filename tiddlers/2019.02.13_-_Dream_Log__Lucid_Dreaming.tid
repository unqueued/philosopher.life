title: 2019.02.13 - Dream Log: Lucid Dreaming

//Apparently, I am wrong again. Surprise! This is useful.//

I've been waking up in stages. I finally understood what was happening this morning. I've fallen asleep to //Rick & Morty// running many times, never turned it off, Kodi keeps moving to the next episode, but I hear nothing. Eventually, I can hear myself talk, and further, I can remember it! The state machine conversation I previously had with myself was during some phase of sleep. Here's the cool part: I've been "awoken" suddenly by the sound of //Rick & Morty// coming out of the TV. I have absent-mindedly assumed it was me (fumbling in my sleep) or the cat clumsily hitting the spacebar; this was confabulation. No! 

What has happened is that my brain's automation has turned off sending the percepts of the low-volume quiet sound of //Rick & Morty// to my dreamstate, but eventually the conditions were ripe enough for me to be startled into hearing it. I talking to myself in my sleep while being deaf to the sound of the television, I believe this is a kind of lucid dream. I'm doing my usual inner-monologging (:P), and I can clearly hear myself. All of the sudden, I am awakened to the injection of the sound that is external to my body. The sound of the TV comes rushing into my perceptual field, I suggest breaking my lucid dreaming. It wasn't as though the sound wasn't there the whole time; no, indeed, //Rick & Morty// had been on all night. Rather, system 1 non-autonomously and automatically elected (a probabilistic threshold met, a non-conscious inference) to release that information into my Ego tunnel's phenomenology in that moment. One moment I am only attending to the sound of my inner voice, and the next I'm attending to both my internal monologue sound (though that is also externally describable) and the external sound.

Of course, I could still be wrong. Maybe there are gaps. I can't say for sure my phenomenology is accurate. I can only report what I think I heard. Just because it felt real doesn't mean it is real. I also appreciate how reconstructing dreams are almost always confabulations. Ugh. Still, that's what I got. I've gotta think about it.
