title: 2017.07.11 -- Pipefitting Log

Today was exhausting and very stressful. 

I arrived significantly early on the job site. I called up my foreman, Terry. He was just outside, I went with him. Terry is fat, short, middle-aged/old, direct, and gruff. Frankly, he was grumpy. I followed him with my car through the warehouse to a different parking area (which I intend to use again tomorrow). His 20-something son was with him in the car, Jacob. Jacob, I found out, has been fitting for 2-years. Of what little work I saw of his, he seemed reasonably competent. 

Terry told me he fired the last 6 welders and last 2 pipefitters. He talked a lot of trash about them. My welder showed up, but without any gear. This pissed him off, and so he talked trash about him to me. He told me that if my welder, a temp, wasn't producing, to let him know. He would fire him immediately. I saw Terry and his son's work. Terry is not only an accomplished pipefitter, obviously, but also a good pipewelder (although, the better of the welders back at TCAT would have crushed him). 

I was then shown what was expected of me. Basically, it was me and my welder, Jaye (sic), and I was the journeyman pipefitter calling the shots for the project with Jaye calling the shots on the bevels and welds. This was what I was worried about. I don't believe I'm ready for this. I can fit, yes, but I'm not a journeyman. I'm expected to do journeyman work here though. And, worryingly, my foreman (direct superior) fires pipefitters that don't live up to his expectations. Needless to say, my stomach churned. I was pretty sure I was going to lose this job, and I'm still convinced I might after the end of the day. 

I told Terry that I had only been pipefitting for 6 months to temper his expectations. He looked at me, obviously very unhappy and no longer trusting me even the pinch he had given me before, and he said "how did you get this job? Did you oversell yourself?" I told him that I sent pictures of my work  to the company, and they hired me. He and his son changed their attitudes to be even more passive aggressively hostile to me. They clearly don't believe I belong or will make it. They are probably right. I am damned good, amazing even, for 6 months of practice, but I'm no journeyman (and I don't get paid like one either), not yet anyways. Although, they were polite enough throughout the day, and they offered me water from their truck several times. Oh yeah, he also decided to explain that Barry would be coming tomorrow, if I had didn't have enough to show for today, he'd probably let me go too. 

Not a happy feeling, let me tell you. 

I'm building water supply and water intake pipe systems. He first showed me what my predecessors had made. It was clearly not plumb. This pissed him off because these would be public pipes, and they have to look good. Besides the lack of level/plumb, I'm not sure if it looked anything like what he wanted. He said I would be taking them down. I need a harness and a lift to do it. The order didn't matter that much to him, and I think it will be useful to leave my work up as a point of comparison. I think I can do a better job, and I hope to highlight that against their work. He also said that as soon as the crane with our large heaters(?) come, we'll drop what we are doing to help.

He showed me one of these systems he had done (not identical, but similar). He drew a drawing up, just a sketch, without any details of what he wanted in mine. He then told me to figure the rest out. I spent the morning planning. 

At first, I just blanked. I lost a grasp of everything I was doing. Honestly, I was freaking out a bit. But, I pulled it together. Fake it till you make it, right? I started drawing. I checked my work multiple times. It is complex, not normal from what I've seen, and I had to make it up on the spot. I'm not experienced enough to be this clutch. I figured out roughly what I wanted to do, but it took me longer than it should have if I were a journeyman. My foreman noted that, but left room by saying fitters do it different ways. It sounded like he would have had something to weld within the first two hours. He also thought I should mount the flange, nipple, and most of the fittings first and then work on building the column. He did not want me to make a spool first and then mount it. This is stovepiping territory to me, but I did what he wanted. I think I'm glad I did, and only because I made a massive mistake.

Our welding machine didn't come in until maybe 9:30, and we had orientation at 10 (just watched a video and signed saying we saw it). 

I asked about the screwpipe hybridized into buttweld nipple (called a split-nipple). There was no machine that could do 2.5" screwpipe that I saw. I don't know how they made it. I couldn't afford to screw up on the one piece I had. I asked if he knew the takeout for it, since it was beyond what my pipefitting book showed. He said I would have to figure it out (i.e. he didn't know or have that information, and he wanted me to stovepipe it instead of fully planning it). I had to wrench it into place and measure the TO that way. I think it worked.

That reminds me, a couple times Terry intimated that we were supposed to rush and not worry about getting it perfect. He said we don't bevel (although, obviously we do bevel...he was doing it too!), or rather he meant that we don't try to make perfect bevels (or so I assume). He wanted us to just bang it out. I'm trying to find the "good enough" spot for him. I really need this job.

My drawing seemed good enough. I did the math. It all seemed to work.

Jaye, btw, is a cool guy. We got along. I apologized multiple times for not knowing what I was doing. I thanked him for his patience, etc. He said it was no trouble multiple times, and was never annoyed with me (or not openly so). He gave me enormous slack since he knew it my first day ever doing it on the job. He thought we were doing a good job. In fact, he seemed confident and pleased for the most part (until the end of the day). He talked a lot of shit about Terry as well (whom he had just met that day). He talked about how other jobs went, and felt the expectations at this job were particularly high. 

After I had a gameplan, I felt better. We got to work. I had to cut with a portaband. I've precious little experience doing it like this, and I didn't have a wrap around. I desperately need one. I can't tell him I don't have these tools. Any serious professional would have them. I did have to ask for the leftovers and scraps of equipment, sealers, and power tools. He and his son had all the nice stuff, and they gave the worst of what they had to us. Jaye saw it as well, he complained. 

It was a very slow start. By near lunch time, we had most of the pieces cut. My bevels were mediocre to terrible. We only had one tripod stand, and that slowed us down considerably. The sockolets were additional monkey wrenches. We had to use the oxyacetylene torch to cut one. I didn't cut it, but Jaye did. He has 6 years experience, steady hands, and both our jobs are on the line (or, perhaps, this is just the foreman being tough...but I don't think it's an act, I have to say). I thought it best for Jaye to do this. 

Jaye complained about the gaps and wasn't happy about positon welding. I lack a 45 degree angle finder except my protractor. This made it very hard, since I had 2 45 angles to worry about. I don't own a 2-hole either, so it was exceptionally hard. I could have done this much easier in the shop. I lack the resources to do this well, and I shouldn't feel bad about that. I can only do the best I can with what I have. 

We spent 10 hours, and by the end, we didn't have a ton to show for it. Even worse, it was wrong. We went to mount the column, and it was off in two ways. First, it was cut too tall. I know I forgot the vertical takeout for the 90 set on a 45 degree angle. I might have forgotten the 45 fitting's TO as well, but I don't think I did. Unfortunately, the math didn't work for either of them. So, something extra has gone wrong, and I don't know what it is. I lack the tools to answer some of these questions nicely, and I had to eyeball the tape measure to shorten the pipe. We did that, and then we checked to see if it would reach the short fitting. Thankfully, I didn't fuck up, I believe, on the screwpipe TO. I believe this will fit, except the short fitting was supposed to butt up against the T. It didn't. There is a gap that shouldn't be there. 

We tacked the column and made it plumb all around. I need to cut a nipple to go in between the T and the short 90. These mistakes became apparent in our last hour or so. It was quite disheartening. Thankfully, we can stovepipe this part. I'm glad I did it the foreman's way. He is not going to be happy about the extra space, but it still meets his requirements, I believe. He wanted it tight, and it is still tight enough, I believe. He's going to see it and have disdain. I can handle the rebuke, but I really don't want to lose my job. 

I will say this: mine looks a hell of alot more like the one he made than what my predecessors produced. 

Oh yeah, about quittin' time, I figured out another mistake. We take the column, and we should have cut another hole for a weldolet. We'll remove it tomorrow and cut that. I'll measure first. Our first weldolet did not come out beautifully plumb (but, it may not matter so much. I'm sure my foreman noticed this as well, although he said nothing. 

At the end of the day, we cleaned up, locked stuff away, and I was told my hours would be 4 10's and an 8 on Friday. He told me to show up between 7 and 7:30. He said he was lenient because he lives 70 miles away.

I'm going to keep pushing through my frustration. I'm going to persist. I don't care whether I'm ready or not. I've gotta make this work. Through sheer will power, I hope to show this man that I'm worth keeping around.
