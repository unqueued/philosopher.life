title: 2019.10.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Clash

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I believe that there will ultimately be a clash between the oppressed and those who do the oppressing. I believe that there will be a clash between those who want freedom, justice, and equality for everyone and those who want to continue the system of exploitation. I believe that there will be that kind of clash, but I don't think it will be based on the color of the skin.

Preach, yo! It's refreshing to see this from you, [[Saint MX]]. I think I might be accused of being a brocialist or lacking an effective appreciation for intersectionality. Not all conflicts are equal, and some are much closer to the root cause than others. I adore how you  push for racial civil rights without detracting from addressing the more fundamental problem of the centralization of political [[power]]. This is a hallmark of what separates someone who calls themselves a leftist (progressive, Democrat, liberal, or what have you) from a meaningful [[pleft]]ist.<<ref "n">> It's not egoistic, and because it pursues the center of justice, it is less prone to counterfeits which only aim to speak about the edges and boundaries of justice in some misdirective manner (neoliberals, for example, use this tactic all the time). You hit the nail on the head. 

Of course, you would be correct to say that the average innocent disenfranchised person has darker skin pigmentation than the average capitalist or reactionary. That is no accident. Racial discrimination is a confabulatory tool. Its premises are lies, and these are cultivated and wielded to take our gaze off solving inequality more generally. Evil begets evil all too often; it grows into a monster in us. You've struck at the heart of the matter, and your prediction appears accurate. I'm grateful that you do not overstep your bounds claiming even a likely victory for those seeking justice. Let us justifiably [[hope]] [[Humanity]] can amputate the infection while there is still time.
