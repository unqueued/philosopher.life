title: 2020.01.23 - Prompted Introspection: Enough Money

!! I wish I had enough money to??

`/avoids-answering-perfectly`

Guess I'll answer this with selfish bullshit:

* Braces for offspring
* VR for everyone
* Eat out every single meal and/or personal chef who makes healthy but delicious food
* Own a small, safe, well-made home within a 10-minute walk of my wife's work
* Send my offspring on trips around the world
* A custom desk
