apprentice i have butted heads with, who often brings up the fact that im not christian in front of others as a power play and acts like he is 15, approached me today and said he was thinking about joining the army.  Asked me how /when he should present his 2 weeks notice, and eventually brought up the fact that he might be asked to kill, and that he knows "the good book" is against that.

i talked about what a gift it is to have the chance to think before he goes into that situation, that he has a chance to program himself, and ask who he wants to become
SEP 16 10:13 PM
then i went into full anti-imperialism against the armed forces, which lost him :)
SEP 16 10:13 PM
Lol!
SEP 16 10:13 PM
but it was fun being a little disciple
SEP 16 10:14 PM

spreading the good word of the church of h0p3
SEP 16 10:14 PM
 :P
SEP 16 10:14 PM
the cult grows
SEP 16 10:14 PM
nah, i think i really turned him off from it lol
SEP 16 10:14 PM
but it was nice to be pulled aside to have that discussion
SEP 16 10:15 PM
surprising
SEP 16 10:15 PM
wonder why he did
SEP 16 10:15 PM
he straight up asked me how I would justify going to war if I was in his shoes-- like he admits his critical thinking and exposure/understanding of his own beliefs (recent convert) are so weak, he wanted me to do the footwork for him
SEP 16 10:16 PM
It's hard to know if he is really completely against your view.
SEP 16 10:17 PM
I told him about how I hate cheating as a behavior, but I have no illusion that I would succeed in fighting off all temptation (or much of any honestly), that due to my weak will, I have to choose who and where I go to avoid the possibility of doing those things which I abhor
SEP 16 10:18 PM
and that if he knows that he would have no real problem killing someone if commanded to, but he thinks it might be wrong to, he needs to never put himself in a position where he wants to follow the commands of someone that wants him to kill
SEP 16 10:18 PM
very surprised to hear he interprets the Bible that way also
SEP 16 10:19 PM
i don't think he knows a bible from a bullfrog honestly
SEP 16 10:19 PM
dude is dense as fuck, and has a lot on his plate at home
SEP 16 10:19 PM
he is taking care of his disabled father
SEP 16 10:20 PM
and i think he just wants out
SEP 16 10:20 PM
lot for a 20 year old to handle
SEP 16 10:20 PM
especially since his father's injuries make him very irritable
SEP 16 10:20 PM
No doubt. Must be insanely hard on him.
SEP 16 10:21 PM
anyway, night man :) just wanted to share
SEP 16 10:21 PM
sleep well! Love you
