!! Respond to the following gem:

Our theories contain paradoxes not because reality is beyond human understanding, but because reality in itself is ontologically unfinished - seen in this way, encountering contradiction becomes proof of touching the real.

I admire this realist perspective, [[Zizek]]. You bite the fucking bullet too. It looks like the paradoxico-critical orientation coming out of analytic-continental. All contradictions are false, but some of them are true (don't even act like you can really, really understand what that means all the way down). This causes a rupture (though perhaps not too explosive) and an emergent dialetheia in our own ability to understand the world (as a corresponding model of the original thing-in-itself). Yes, there is something to be said for paradox as the structural origins and outcomes (though your school may only accept the outcomes part) of reality and considerations thereof. I'm convinced even Saint Godel's view (consistency+incompleteness) points to [[The Dialetheia]] though (which apparently makes me a lunatic), so I'm not so convinced paradoxico-critical orientation (completeness+inconsistency) is the only route (perhaps we need both).

I adore your use of "unfinished" here (especially since it feels like incompleteness to me). Would you buy "undecidable"? The limits of language tell us something about [[The Dialetheia]]. At least some facet of the [[gem]] is the leap from the finite to [[The Infinite]]; rules (and rules about rules) don't translate nicely in both directions (especially when we are being humble). Reality to some [[dok]] is clearly beyond not just practical reason, but even theoretical. I do not deny realism, and I don't think you are either. It's hard to say this well enough, and I'm grateful to see fundamental philosophy from you again.

I can agree that reality is not beyond human understanding insofar as inconsistency can be justifiably embedded in what The Lottery Paradox demonstrates. That is not a satisfying though.

To be clear, encountering just any contradiction is not any direct proof of touching The Real (any more so than any other proposition). But, I agree we do encounter some kinds of inconsistencies that require us to admit the absurd (for us) nature of The Real. It appears that Self-Refuter does so into [[infinigress]]. I'm never going to be able to think it, let alone say it. Of course, even if it may be futile as the finite, it is our plight. It's fascinating that you deny the transcendent whole though when you buy yourself exactly that.
