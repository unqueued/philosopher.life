title: 2019.10.29 - Afterschool Teaching: Just Say No

Whitney, Carson, and I talked about a great number of topics. I've pressed them to argue with their professors instead of meekly saying nothing. Carson is going into speech pathology. Had the chance to praise Carson's dialectical reasoning with her children (mine is so much messier!), and I went down a small rabbithole with her against her professor's argument.

One-on-ones were a joy. I wish I knew how to write about so many conversations packed into this space. New girl, 5Mf appears fairly mature, big family, probably grown up fast. 6JR faces some serious family troubles, but he is safe and he's got some support.

Carson took some of my worst offenders with her today on purpose. Fascinating. I took everyone else, and Whitney eventually came from the office to join us. Phone problems galore for the kids with other adults in the room.

Very little homework today. So, we played.

Huge magic games. Big moods. We had fun.

Girls drew art on paper or their limbs (8G's drawing was provocative; go forth and kick ass) and talked with me. Some decent rap and poems today too.

7CM and I have had to tango today. I think she's doing better so far. What a savage child. I love her.

MadameM showed up in jammies. <3. Perfect tone for this. 8J has profoundly connected with her. It's great.

7DM's father propositioned Whitney while I was standing there. Look on her face was priceless, then she exploded with me when we got back into the classroom. That was unpredicted.

I'm going to miss my children. 

I talked with [[gh057]] for a while at the end before Delp called for me. I was late to grab my bag.
