title: 2019.03.15 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Cold War

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The Cold War ideology and the international communist conspiracy function in an important way as essentially a propaganda device to mobilize support at a particular historical moment for this long-time imperial enterprise. In fact, I believe that this is probably the main function of the Cold War: it serves as a useful device for the managers of American society and their counterparts in the Soviet Union to control their own populations and their own respective imperial systems.

I have no idea how to respond to this gorgeous [[redpill]] with any form of construction or deconstruction which adds value. Alright, well, I guess I'll defend [[Saint Chomsky]] against my brother's conspiracy theory critique.

The managers of America aren't some well-integrated, tight-knit, highly-coordinated body of individuals acting in unison. No, the Cold War, as a memeplex in the [[The Great Human Conversation]] and material dialectic is wielded in brush strokes, as a playbook, by many competing interests that just so happen to find this tool useful for controlling others.

This is straight out of Orwell too. It's misdirection of our woes onto enemies abroad to keep our eyes off the injustice of domestic power structures. It's the boogeyman.
