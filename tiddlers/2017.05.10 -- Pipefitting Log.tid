title: 2017.05.10 -- Pipefitting Log

Today was another frustrating day. I didn't sleep well because my stomach pains kept me up during the night. Whatever was in the BBQ last night didn't sit well with me. I was able to get up easily enough though, so I did sleep. I spent about 15 minutes of my morning just exploding on the toilet though; I had the nauseous shits all day. My wife needed a ride, and I was already running late. I took her to work, and then I drove to mine. I was 3 minutes late, and literally was walking to the table with my teacher for attendance. If I were any later, I'd have been tardy (which my teacher is not very charitable about). Close call.

Mel and Nash decided to go "study" for a test all day. They just sat there like bums. Lazy fucks. They probably would have hindered our work anyways though, so I guess I'm thankful they didn't want to practice. One of the new guys was "no call, no show." The other new guy, let's call him Robert, had nothing to do. So, he was directed to help Chris and I. Robert's dad is an ironworker, so Robert had tons of extra gear. Later in the day, after lunch, he even generously gave me a new pair of welding gloves, which I've desperately needed. I thanked him multiple times. I think he gave them to me because I've been teaching him a lot. I had to reÃ«xplain takeout math to him, since our teacher really does a poor job of it (I tried to walk him through our buttweld takeouts [at a high level] as well). I'm trying to do what I wish others would have done for me. Robert is going to fly through this course in a way that I didn't have the opportunity to do. He's smart, was going to school for architecture until his GF got pregnant (so, maybe not wise). I like him, at least for now.

In any case, Chris, Robert, and I worked on the simulator. We put the final elbow on. I was the primary tacker today, although I let Robert do some 4th tacks (because I wasn't worried about mistakes there), and it went smoothly enough. We then moved to a third table for the long top piece of the simulator. The pipes and fitting went on lickity-split. We used the same method, end-of-the-pipe minus takeouts to find where to place the sockolets. It was going swimmingly, or so we all thought. Unfortunately, Chris (and ultimately I) made a large mistake here.

I had used the wrap around and tape measure to mark the center of the sockolet mounting areas on the pipe. We mounted two of the sockolets. For the third sockolet, Chris decided I had marked the wrong side of the pipe. So, he marked the opposite side and mounted it there. Being tired and sick, I decided to just go with the flow. Normally, I check through their reasoning. I should have, and it was my fault that I didn't. This mistake did not present itself until much later in the day though.

Chris then made a second mistake. Chris cut pipe for the sockolets and tried to tack it himself. This burned a hole in the pipe. I had burned two holes that day already, but I was able to fill it in using an extra rod (kinda like TIG welding) to give me a starting point to work from between the bevels. This was a hole straight through pipe though. I thought we'd be able to fix it, so we just moved on. I knew I was going to retack and fix the welds across the entire piece anyways.

Also, we had a ton of trouble getting the pipe turned in the smaller vise, and we ended up resorting to pipewrenches to twist it into place. It was quite frustrating.

We mounted the extension pipe on the T, and it was clean. We put the flange on it, etc. Everything was level enough. 

Chris and Robert decided to take a break while I did the welding. I got everything set, but I absolutely could not fill that hole. I did everything I could. It was very thin 1" pipe. We talked about it, then our teacher came by. At first he said we could just MIG it, but on second thought he told us to just cut the pipe and remount it. So, we did. Chris was unhappy that this mistake had to be fixed this late in the game. He cut it, and I had Robert clean it up. I did all the tacking from then on. It went fast enough.

So, we thought the top piece was done. We took the jackstands out and had them sit between the ends of the legs coming horizontally off the vise-tables. We moved the pipe into position. We did some work to get it level. It was only then that we looked at it and realized that I had been correct about the positioning of the sockolet in the first place. Fuuuuuuuuuuuck. 

We thought about it, and the teacher walked by. After we said we screwed up, he smiled and said he was wondering when we would figure it out (although, I'm not convinced he actually knew from some of his body language, word choice, and inability to target the thing we did wrong with his eyes). After explanation, he saw it. It had to be fixed. So, we took the top back to the table (heavy monster), and Chris cut it from the sockolet. I did the grinding to clean it up, since I'm far and away the best grinder in the shop. Even my teacher's hands are too shaky to do it was well as I do. It's like sculpting! 

So, Chris gets does the fit-up, which I thought would be pretty hard considered the sockolet itself wasn't cleaned up much. He did a good job, or so we thought. I 1-inch tacked it. Everything was good to go. Then I looked again, and I said, "Nooooooo!" I looked at Chris, and he knows my look by now. He knew something was off. I threw my hands up in the air and just laughed. He took a look and realized that we forgot to two-hole it. God damnit. So, he cut the piece off again. We two-hole it, and I do the tacks all over again.

By this time, we are worn out. If it could go wrong, it did, or so it felt like. Anyways, we move the top portion of the simulator into place yet again. I eventually convince them that we need an actual vice-stand in the middle, since we have to keep it from turning. I get one, we mount it. We then use our jackstands to try and level the top pipe out. We also got the legs all nice and level off the vice-tables. I realized that our jackstands for the top were literally lifting our vice-stand off the ground, making it useless. I realized that our vice-stand was ultimately just a centimeter or two shorter than the vice-tables. I laughed. It took a while to convince Chris, but I did. I explained that we needed to use two more vice-stands, since it was the only way to get the legs and top on the same level plane. He didn't want it to be true, I think, because moving the extremely heavy tables and readjusting all the pipe is a pain in the ass. So, we did it.

The teacher came by and saw that I was using a pipewrench to align the pipes inside the vices. He gave me a thumbs up for the "smarter not harder" trick I was using and showed me a few other wrenches worth using for this. The teacher told me to come get him when we were ready to check that the pipes were legitimately squared against each other.

We spent some time moving tables and adjusting. It took a while to get everything level and into place. I got it as square as I could by hand. Then the teacher had Mel and Nash come out of hte classroom to watch what he was going to teach us: the 3-4-5 method (also the 6-8-10). Classic triangle. Just mark 3 feet off from the center of the elbow, and 4 feet in the other direction. Mark them very carefully. Make sure to find the very center-top of the pipe. He brought out an expensive instrument for this that had a hole-punch with a level on it that had legs which went around the pipe. He showed us another way too. We took a square and torpedo level, and I checked the book for the OD of 3" pipe, which is 3.5". Half of that is 1.75". We put the square against the side and leveled the top. I marked the 1.75" measurement of the leveled square which gave us the center-top of the pipe. These marks were on our 3 and 4 foot marks respectively. We then measured point to point and hit 5'-1/8". The teacher said that is good enough (and it would have to be given the fact that he just eyeballed the center of the elbows for measuring the 3 and 4). 

It was late, and so we called it quits. Tomorrow we'll probably check the alignments again using the 3-4-5 method, and I will tack the pipes. Sucks that I have to do 2G and overhead on these though. It's fucking hard. Perhaps we may even get around to mounting it into the ground. We'll see.
