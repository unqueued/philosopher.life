title: 2018.07.22 - L: Wiki

L asked me about what I meant by dark triads. I called her up, since I didn't have power, and couldn't type fast enough on my phone. It was a lengthy conversation about the structure, nature, and purpose of this wiki. I walked her through much of my thinking from a mile-high view. I'm extremely appreciative of her attempt to understand me and what I'm doing here. 

We talked about damn near everything under the sun and plenty of metaphysics too. 

I think she now gets the gist of what I'm doing here. I hope it will be useful to us.
