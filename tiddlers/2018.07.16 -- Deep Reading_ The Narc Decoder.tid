title: 2018.07.16 -- Deep Reading: The Narc Decoder

Most of the book is a dissection of a sequence of communications, literally decoding them by example. The author never offers a theory, but she does show the practice of interpreting people through a profoundly uncharitable, redpilled lens. I can see I've had to do the same with others in my life. As an autistic person, I had a hard time understanding what really has been going through their minds. As I've engaged in this practice more and more, applying this redpilled model, my predictions about people have dramatically improved. I've been caught off guard (quite painful) less and less. There is something very important to being able to decode people in the way the author points out.

It's a very emotional read, visceral and gut-oriented. It's also got a coldness in it. There is dialectic here.

My one major criticism of this book is how poorly the theory is articulated and structured. There is no explanation of the notions of The Decoder Ring used in this book. It lacks the kind of cognitive specifications I'm looking to inspect. Justification matters.
