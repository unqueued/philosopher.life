How goes your Monday? How was the auction?
MON 3:47 PM
Monday was ok for a Monday. I was really hoping for a Snow day :confused:
TUE 9:12 AM
Dunno about the auction because we didn’t stay but I heard good things
TUE 9:12 AM
[[UJ]] mentioned that we should have just donated money and kept the cheesecake and I think I agree hehe
TUE 9:13 AM
We had a technical snowday. I can appreciate the need for it. =/
TUE 9:15 AM
It’s ok though. End of the third quarter this week and I like being finished with things
TUE 9:16 AM
You ended up not staying as you predicted.  Cheesecake babies are hard to let go. I concur with  you doctors. Best to eat the delicious cheesecake.
TUE 9:17 AM
Completion is wonderful.
TUE 9:17 AM
Yes that may be the future of cake auctions —donate $ and keep the cheesecake hehe
TUE 9:18 AM
That's how everyone should participate in the cake auction.
TUE 9:18 AM
Everyone make cakes and eat them at their houses and donate. For the social component, they invite others over or meet up at the church to eat cake and then donate.
TUE 9:19 AM
We ended up going to mexican for lunch with my friend Lisa, her special needs daughter Ella, Gpa, Consuelo and [[ALM]] Firquin.
TUE 9:19 AM
It was good
TUE 9:19 AM
Noice
TUE 9:19 AM
That sounds like a good idea
TUE 9:20 AM
How's Consuelo doing?
TUE 9:20 AM
Pretty good —she understands more English than she speaks so it’s hard to have a conversation
TUE 9:21 AM
She is shy about trying I think
TUE 9:21 AM
Busting out the phones to translate, I suppose.
TUE 9:22 AM
That's gotta be a difficult position.
TUE 9:22 AM
It sucks when someone at the table is unable to transmit meaning to others. Not all bottlenecks can be handled though. =/
TUE 9:23 AM
Well, it is good that you get together.
TUE 9:23 AM
Yeah she isn’t shy to speak Spanish with the waiter
TUE 9:23 AM
She seems happy. I try to include her as best as I can. She’s a nice lady and I appreciate her putting up with Gpa :blush: I think though she is happy to be here
TUE 9:24 AM
Good. I am, of course, a skeptical man. lol.
TUE 9:25 AM
How's the transition for the store going?
TUE 9:27 AM
Well I have seen her different times and in different places (home in her jammies, at church, at the store, at dinner) She tries and sometimes communicates through Gpa but never seems repressed or unhappy
TUE 9:28 AM
Store transition is weird —seems like they are dumping warehouse extras on us in addition to the things we already had...and taking out other things
TUE 9:29 AM
I bet it has been a surreal experience to participate in deconstructing it.
TUE 9:31 AM
I am hoping maybe I can get to the place where she feels comfortable enough to try English with me
TUE 9:33 AM
She would be blessed to know you that personally.
TUE 9:35 AM
:blush:
TUE 9:35 AM
How was your Monday?
TUE 9:35 AM
Sleepless, a volatile grind, snowday (so grateful), [[j3d1h]] and I finally saw first fruit of a particular piece of code that has taken a while to envision (we're noobs).
TUE 9:38 AM
Ran into something that stunned me:
TUE 9:39 AM
https://www.vox.com/2018/12/27/18137571/what-is-hopepunk-noblebright-grimdark
TUE 9:39 AM
I had a guttural response to it: https://philosopher.life/#h0p3punk:h0p3punk
TUE 9:39 AM
I shall have to read it at lunch
TUE 9:40 AM
This also has been on my mind: https://philosopher.life/#Hymns%20of%20h0p3
TUE 9:40 AM
Glad you got a snow day!
TUE 9:40 AM
Heck yeah
TUE 9:40 AM
I so needed it.
TUE 9:40 AM
3 hours of sleep is not enough. I still don't feel recovered.
TUE 9:41 AM
No 3 hours is not enough
TUE 9:41 AM
It’s hard to catch up
TUE 9:41 AM
Aye. I usually have at least some hours in my day without chest tightness, but without sleep, it's perma-tight.
TUE 9:42 AM
Ick
TUE 9:42 AM
They decided I have Sleep Apnea so my machine should be coming —I hope it helps
TUE 9:43 AM
I hope so too. You will have let me know how it goes. Some people seem to find it uncomfortable, others aren't bothered by it. I bet it is something one gets used to.
TUE 9:44 AM
Yeah I think so
TUE 9:44 AM
And I don’t have the fun facial hair you guys have —that may make a difference
TUE 9:44 AM
Well not as much hehe
TUE 9:45 AM
rofl
TUE 9:47 AM
Also I mistakenly took my night meds in the morning—and felt a lot better so I switched my night/day and have felt better
TUE 9:48 AM
Weird things...
TUE 9:48 AM
That is the weirdness of science. Happy mistakes make new art.
TUE 9:49 AM
Yes so of course I had to repeat the experiment in case it was an outlier
TUE 9:49 AM
But it seems to be repeatable
TUE 9:50 AM
