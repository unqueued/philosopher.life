!! Audit:

* So many of these have had previous answers, and it's wonderful to look back. In a way, I am surprised that I change my mind or have anything significant to add so often.
* I continue to see [[The Original Position]] come up again and again. That is a sign.
* I do not make enough use of the Diogenesocrates interlocutor, or at least, I wish there were clearer opportunities to use him.
* Still editing. Gross.
* It's interesting to see how this log pushed me over the edge into the [[Guitar]] projectlog this month. I'm really glad we did. It's been very useful to my children, and I've had pleasure in doing it too.
** Actually, just thinking about it sent me back to the Youtubes to think more about le guitar. I'm really enjoying this with my son. I hope it's something that lasts us, but I don't want to get my hopes up too high just yet.
* I'm not sure why, but I am not as moved by this work as much as I would have expected, though I am still pleased with it.
* I fear I don't have much to say here. Am I auditing incorrectly? This work seems fine to me. The whole point it is to figure out how to improve this practice and to enforce it.
