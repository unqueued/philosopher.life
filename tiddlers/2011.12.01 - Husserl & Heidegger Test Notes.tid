title: 2011.12.01 - Husserl & Heidegger Test Notes

August 25, 2011

Phenomenology is a methodology. The meaning isn’t theoretical, it comes in the practice of it (in the reductions, the bracketing, etc.).

Husserl says there are 3 reductions (but he links 1st and 3rd):

    Phenomenological reduction

    Eidetic reduction

    Transcendental reduction

Eidos = structure of experience

Phenomenological reduction-

    Husserl beings by describing his experience.

    Contrast between ‘Natural Standpoint’ and ‘Phenomenological Standpoint’.

Husserl thinks of himself as the profound Modern philosopher (in league with/relation to Descartes). For him, Modern philosophy is about epistemic certainty; Husserl is also looking for apodicticity (absolute certainty, indubitable). Husserl is in an awkward position; he is founding a movement, and he’s having to found it without anyone else to appeal to who are phenomenologists. He has to appeal to non-phenomenologists, those who find metaphysics is still interesting. He takes a foothold in Descartes to reach these people.

Descartes is using a methodological operation which is hyperbolic (which Husserl seems to emulate in some sense). Modern thought, for Heidegger, is about the ‘nature of the subject’. In Descartes, the subject is “I”. That reorientation towards the primacy of “I” we see in Descartes (moving from the medieval orientation of God first, and “I” second) is a very Modern thought.

Descartes: Res cogitans (Me as a thinking thing) isn’t doubtable. Res extensa (me with a body) is doubtable – my perception could be an illusion. He is certain of his mind and his ideas, the content of his mind. He doesn’t know if these ideas correspond (skepticism), but he knows these ideas are ideas, they do exist, they are legitimate just in themselves. He goes on to his ontological argument, God isn’t a deceiver, and then he thinks he can demonstrate the existence of the world. His own existence is immediately known to him, but it takes the structure of logical inferences to know God and the rest of the argument. There is a certainty, from logic, of these things, but they are less certain, for some reason, than the immediately known (Cogito, the ego, the self) existence of ourself. In imagination, my mind seems to have control, whereas in understanding, based on perception experience, isn’t in my control, so he concludes that perception must correspond to something outside of our control that causes it.

So, what does Husserl do with it? He thinks that Descartes should have stopped at the 2nd meditation. He thinks that when Descartes turns back to God, that Descartes is going back to metaphysics, to what is dubitable. He thinks Descartes was at the doorstep of Phenomenology, but didn’t go through it.

Husserl, seeing the divide between natural science and humanities (Gheist study), believes natural science is superior in some sense, as it has a unified methodology where the humanities do not. He wants a unified methodology.

Husserl says Descartes fails to make the transcendental turn, which is all about maintaining apodicticity.

Ideas = Objects of consciousness

As long as we do not take the content of consciousness to be anything more than content of consciousness, then we maintain apodicticity. We should not extend them, or assume correspondence, lest we lose the indubitability/apodicticity. Perhaps perception is like dreaming – it may just be part of the mind, but we don’t have control over it. There is no need to (or, rather we should DOUBT the) leap to something being outside our consciousness causing our mind to perceive or to dream.

The natural standpoint has “correspondence” built into it. Husserl thinks it is possible to doubt that correspondence, and this is a problem. So, Husserl says: “let’s suspend that”. As if we can “bracket” or suspend the assumption of an external world and this correspondence.

What if we reduce our thinking to exclusively what is presented to consciousness without making the assumption of something external presenting to consciousness? There doesn’t have to be something “standing behind” the things which present themselves to consciousness.

Phenomena: What appears to consciousness as it appears to consciousness. This is the “object of consciousness”. Some of these objects perceptual objects, some value objects, etc. We must reduce the world to these objects of consciousness, these pure presentations, without making the ‘correspondence’ assumption.

There is immediacy to phenomena. They have ‘givenness’. We attend to the original givenness of phenomena just as it presents itself and nothing more.

Husserl thinks we can study phenomenological objects without having to make the metaphysical and correspondence mistakes/assumptions. Philosophy is entirely about indubitability. Looking at “things that present themselves only as they present themselves, and nothing more” allows us to maintain indubitability – it is apdoctic-preserving.

Phenomenological reduction is looking at what is given to consciousness exactly as it is given to consciousness, but nothing more.

Transcendental “I” of Kant: Joke about Hume, “Hume is the guy that wonders if he is in his house, so he goes outside his home to look inside, and finds he isn’t in his home”.

Husserl thinks that once he can get you into the phenomological reduction, he can get you to talk about the 1st person, immediate givenness, which is the pole/site to which experience is happening. That pole gives you a whole domain of transcendental experience – Husserl says this is the domain of phenomenologically reduced experience. And, we remain in the domain of apodicticity.

The next stage in the methodology of Husserl, is to turn to our experience to see if we can find ‘types’ of experience, which seems to be the heart of the eidetic reduction. To look for “essences” and intuition of essences. The Eidos is a phenomenological event. You have to perform the phenomenological reduction before you can do the eidetic reduction. Eidos isn’t vague, it is the opposite of vague. The structures of experience has the same immediacy as the experience themselves.





August 30, 2011

Husserl doesn’t think of himself as beginning with some ‘theory’. Descartes begins form doubt, and Husserl thinks he isn’t. He is operating from epoche, suspending both doubt and affirmation.

Descartes has “staged” hyperbolic doubt. Husserl’s isn’t staged in the same way. Descartes is looking to secure metaphysical assumptions with epistemic certainty.

Phenomenology is the description of the experience of perceptual objects. Describe an experience as it is experienced. We can’t talk about sense data – that is a theory, and that isn’t descriptive.

Descartes infected what could have been a pure study of what is apodictic with goals and metaphysical assumptions. He was bad at performing apodictic science.

Cogito (subject) is correlated to cogitatum (object).

Transcendence and immanence – Correlate is immanent to concsciousness, but “the cup” which is an object of perception, is a transcendent object. Transcendence is always ‘more than’ the multiplicity of perspectives you can take on something, which means it is always dubitable. It always possible that the next perspective will reveal that it is a hallucination.

Phenomenology differentiates different types of experience. Typifying experience.



September 1, 2011

Transcendental conclusion is that the ‘external world’ is nothing (not just ‘in doubt’, but in fact ‘nothing’). He moves from bracketing the external world, just in terms of doubt, to eventually dismissing the existence of the external world. Consciousness is not in the world, but the world is in consciousness.

Transcendentals are those terms which apply to everything. Kant took that notion, and used it as his term for describing the universal structures in the mind and consciousness and experience.

Structures of experience can’t be deduced a priori. You don’t theorize or speculate, you describe. Pure descriptions. These structures are experiences of any possible “experiencer”. That is an eidetic description. We can ‘confirm’ that structure intersubjectively – our descriptions should be universal and applicable and confirmable by others. Objectivity is the mutual confirmation of eidetic descriptions. If someone else has a problem with an eidetic description, then it may not be correct. We are looking for “invariant structure” – it typifies it. We aren’t looking for what is variable, but rather what is invariable – the essence of a thing.

The essence in Husserl must be a phenomenological event. The essence must appear in consciousness as a phenomenological object.



September 6, 2011

Intentional object – point perception toward and focusing upon an element

Objects have to be a specific object, it can’t just be the general field of perception – In Husserl’s view.

Perception is an act between the cogito and cogitatum. Husserl thinks we are trying to describe structures of the perception field (not perception).

Heidegger thinks instrumentality is primary, and objectiveness only comes about when instrumentality laposes. Husserl thinks objectiveness is primary, and instrumentality is attached to objects.

Modes of presentation (imagination, dreaming, etc.) are structurally different types of experience – this is part of the eidetic reduction.

Heidegger’s ontological distinction is about objects having different modes in some sense, like instrumentality and objectivity. The being of a being is about the different modes of presentation.

Husserl only has one categories: objects. He takes objects and attaches values to it. Heidegger disagrees. There are ontological differences for him –(??) the difference between a phenomenon and “how it appears”.(??)

Direct our consciousness as an intentional operation, like a ray, which focuses on an object. The entire field can’t be given to consciousness (simultaneously) in focus. The background gives implicit objects that can possibly be focused on. Things don’t appear out of nowhere, they appear out of the co-present margin. I’m vaguely aware of the possible object, it is implicitly there, and so I can smoothly transition my focus from one object to another.

Even the whiteboard behind me is in the co-present margin (even though it isn’t in my immediate peripheral vision, it is somehow in my present experience).

There are degrees of margins, As we move out, they become vaguer and vaguer, until we come to the largest margin (the vaguest notion) – he calls that the world. Husserl defines the world as the ultimate limit, the horizon, the margin of margins, within which my experience takes place in this focal center. But, notice, this isn’t the metaphysical definition, such as “all objects that exists” etc.

We operate in this space (of this room), not as if this is the only space, but with the assumption/experience/perception that there is more.

Degree of margins is just distance/space though. Perhaps the state Stadium (which is further away in distance) is less vague and marginally closer to my consciousness than the building across the street (spatially closer) that isn’t relevant to me in any way.

Proximity seems to be about relevant, and not space.

Experience is more than just perception. A loved one might be in the hospital, and I might be class, and the anticipation of knowing about how my loved one is doing is part of my experience during class, but it isn’t a perception during class.



September 8, 2011

Husserl means by ‘evidence’ something that is evident (and doesn’t require justification). All evidence is a matter of self-evidence. But, there are different grades of evidence. Some phenomena present with absolute (apodictic) evidence. There are degrees of evidence.

Phenomenology isn’t a science of fact (which can change and be doubted) , but a science of essence.

The transcendental ego is nothing more than the position in what experience (which has been reduced) presents itself to.

Eidetic structures don’t require arguments. Eidetic structures are just self-evident in the experience itself. It presents itself as the structure of that experience.

Cogitationes = acts of consciousness

Phenomenological Reduction = reduce everything to immanence

Eidetic Reduction = see patterns of types of experience. If a particular experience didn’t have that particular structure, it would be a different type of experience.

Essences are particular way of looking at phenomenological experience.

He reverses the meaning of being. Consciousness comes first, and the world is in it.





September 13, 2011

1-89 of Heidegger for next week.

Categorial intuition is grounded in a sensuous intuition. But Categorical intuition is not a generalization of sensuous intuition. Eidetic intuiton isn’t abstracting from the sensuous experience, but rather the eidetic intuition is given within the sensous experience. The structure shows itself in the same way that individual phenomena shows itself.

Eidetic reduction is not an induction/abstraction of examples of objects to determine an archetype. It doesn’t give apodicticity. The eideitic essence is found in the givenness of the phenomena. The eidetic mode of experience is given in the same way that the phenomena is given – it is plainly evident.

Series of one-sided perspectives give mutual, complementary views of the same object.

We aren’t talking about a conscious being in time/space, but rather a being which has its own structure of time. Subjective time is “inner time consciousness”. There is a structural unity in consciousness of time – this enables us to talk about temporal flow and stream of time. Like there is some sort of spatial consistency in our focal operations, there seems to be a consistency in the flow of time in the consciousness – we aren’t merely jumping from one instant to another.

There is an ‘extended presence’, not merely a point in the now, not instantaneous moment. There is a moment with momentum built into i. There are dynamic operations of time.

Protensional and retensional structures. We don’t get strobe lights or strobing sound, it doesn’t flicker, but rather consciousness seems to retain (Retension) what it just heard, and anticipates (in some sense) what it will hear. Protension is the intention (not an explicit expectation), which is some sort of anticipation.

Expecting someone to come to dinner is not protension. The protension isn’t as explicit. There is something immediately given in a stretch of time, a stretch that seems to cover more than the instant now. “Now” is stretch, from what immediately has happened before and what is just about to happen. The present has its own duration – there is a pregnant present.

The “past” and the “future” are not in this retention and protention (which are about the present ‘now’).





September 15, 2011

The phenomenological and eidetic reductions seem necessary, but perhaps the transcendental reduction isn’t, at least in order to be said to be performing Phenomenology.

We don’t abstract and induce from an experience to understand the invariant structure – it is directly given within the experience. Typology isn’t based on exemplifications (seeing examples, and proposing a type); it is a structure given directly and immediately in experience. Eidetic structures are phenomenological events for Husserl.

Modernism is driven by the need for certainty, apodicticity. Without it we have nothing to a Modern. Post-moderns aren’t looking for certainty, however. They understand the failures of looking for certainty exclusively – we can take probabilistic and inductive arguments, for example, in post-modernism (with a small “p”).

Multiple one-sided perspectives are synthetically harmonized and unified in consciousness.

The Transcendent (God, that type of object is always transcending any immediate givenness, unlike the immanent) is not The Transcendental (intentional operations). We need the eidetic insight to realize that dubitability – the transcendent object is always outside of apodicticity.

??Transcendence isn’t ‘beyond’ consciousness, it is given in experience that something is beyond??

He is accusing philosophers of failing to understand transcendence. He reinterprets it without metaphysics, but as a phenomenologist.

We have to be motivated to believe in the external world. We only assume the external world because our experience is patterned as such.

Immanent being requires nothing for it to exist. Howeve,r the world for transcendent things requires consciousness. ‘That there is a world’ is a judgment, and therefore, epistemically, that world is dependent upon consciousness to make that judgment. On the other hand, consciousness could have other experiences which don’t motivate the external world claim.

In a swarm of experience, may not motivate us to see the external world. The immanence of consciousness/experience cannot be doubted, but the external world can be doubted.

Consciousness doesn’t depend on the external world. The world could be ‘nullified’, perhaps it is a swarm in our free variation, and yet consciousness can remain intact. And, thus, consciousness is supposedly more fundamental than the world. Consciousness remains indubitable, unlike the external world.

??Golden mountains have being, an intentional being (we can predicate about them), but they don’t have existence.??

Husserl thinks we shouldn’t naturalize consciousness, by saying consciousness is in the world. All spatio-temporal systems are constituted within consciousness, they are structured in experience. The Transcendental ego, everything is within its domain, particularly when we describe them as phenomenologists.

Consciousness is a closed system, there is nothing outside of it.

Absolute being and absolute consciousness is what we pursue in Husserl’s phenomenology.

The transcendental reduction shows the primacy of consciousness. It has priority. Consciousness is transcendent to ‘the world’.





September 20, 2011

Kantian model ‘mediates’ but not Husserl. For Husserl, there is nothing given without intentional acts, but there is for Kant.

Intersubjectivity, which has built into it a group confirmation of immediately given eidetic structures and phenomenological claims, seems to indicate we can be wrong about givenness. What does it mean to be wrong about givenness, about the intuition? Apodicticity isn’t something that appears given. I’m worried that we can be wrong about givenness.

-Intersubjectivity is what accounts for objectivity.

How do ethics operate in Husserl’s phenomenology?



Heidegger thinks that Husserl’s eidetic structure is really limited. It only works when we are consciously evaluating. Items of gear, we aren’t doing that work, yet it is still a phenomenological object. When hammering with a hammer, we aren’t thinking of the hammer as a multitude of one-sided perspectives, and yet it is still phenomenological to Heidegger.





September 22, 2011

The proposal for this class is due October 11th. Make it 1,000 words. We need the topic, a real direction in the argument, the commitment cannot be vague. We need to explain what we see ourselves doing with that topic.

Method fallibility, agent fallibility. Truth preservation of logic as a method is parallel to apodictic preserveration of phenomenology as a method.

Heidegger means by intuition, direct givenness, bodily.

“Evidence” is explicated on pg. 50.- Identifying fulfillment, the fulfillment between which there is an identity between the intention and the presentation.

Some things are more or less evident. Regionality of evidence. (Ontological region –different types of phenomena).



I think Husserl betrays the concept of Apodicticity to claim it comes in degrees. You are either certain or you aren’t. His evidence has lost apodicticity later on. Degrees of evidence/Fallibility.

In certain regions, the notion of apodictity does not apply. It then seems that we are losing the givenness. We no longer have absolute givenness. Instead, we have interpretative operations which are more or less in a position to disclose the phenomena – this is hermeneutical givenness instead.

Heidegger thinks that truth is not limited to a feature of assertions/propositions.

Heidegger is arguing that phenomenology can’t dictate the nature of evidence a priori. Evidence, in degrees, scales with the nature of the specific type of phenomena.

Evidence must be regional. But, evidence is not parallel between regions in terms of the degree of certainty.





September 27, 2011

“being” is the phenomenological notion

Ontical refers to the particular being. It’s ontological dimension is ‘how it presents itself as a phenomena.’ The same ontical being can present itself in different ways. There are multiple ontological ways in which a being can present itself.

For Husserl, imagination and dreams are different in their ‘mode of presentation’. This is the eidetic issue. What Heidegger sees about this eidetic reduction as being wrong is that there could be the ‘same being’ presenting itself in different ways.

Phenomenology looks at the ‘how’ not the what. The difference between ‘how’ the table presents itself as an object, and how it presents itself as an item of gear it an ontological distinction. The ontical event, the being hasn’t changed, but ontologically, it is changed and different.

The phenomena of ‘human being’ is distorted in Heidegger’s idea. Heidegger thinks we need to ‘fundamental ontology’ which clarifies the being of ‘human being’.

He thinks some our ontological claims are mistaken! Our ontological misunderstandings will distort the appearance of phenomena.

Ontical – presents ‘what’ the being is.

Ontological – presents ‘how’ the being is.

Husserl’s mistake is that “when you are writing” you don’t see the pen as an object.

Also, inspecting the objects and its properties, does not tell you the function of it. You simply know that hammer’s are designed for hammering when you use (or would use) it for hammering.

Heidegger thinks that the ‘idea’ of the pen is in the subject and that it is being put into the object.

There is a simple intuition of simplicity. There is an object in a single instance of a one-sided event. It is an object even within a single slice of that series of presentation of one-sided events which are synthesized. In perception, you already see the whole in every one of these one-sided perspectives. The wholeness is already given in the simplicity of that perspective.

Heidegger doesn’t agree that we are putting pieces of perception together.

Pg. 58 – “Today we are in a position to move against idealism precisely on this

front only because phenomenology has demonstrated that the nonsensory

and ideal cannot without further ado be identified with the

immanent, conscious, subjective. This is not only negatively stated but

positively shown; and this constitutes the true sense of the discovery of

categorial intuition”



There is a non-sensory dimension to what we call “perception”. When I experience the “table” I experience it in its simplicity, as a table. Every one-sided perspective presupposes the original intuition of unity, that the table is and will present itself as a unified object.

In Idealism, the mind brings order to the chaos.

Is the mind supplying unity to the object?

In perception, acc. Heidegger, an object presents itself as a whole, even in one-sided perspectives.

Unity isn’t ‘posited’, it is already in the presentation.

I am both, simultaneously, experiencing multiplicity, in multiple views of the same object, and simplicity, in the unity of the object.

We intuit the unity, we don’t impose it. The complaint (Heidegger’s) is that we aren’t imposing unity, we aren’t supply unity, we simply intuit it.



Heidegger seems to be separating the object from consciousness.???



Phenomenology can only describe the relationship between consciousness and an intentional object, without metaphysics.

Embedded in experience are categorical intuitions. Everyone seems to agree with sense intuitions being given, but not categorical determinations. But, Heidegger turns around and says that even categorical intuitions have the same degree of ‘givenness’ as sense intuitions.

This is how unity is ‘categorically intuited’ as a feature of the phenomena, while the unity isn’t given, necessarily, in the sense intuitions and perception.

In Heidegger, there is no a priori, there is nothing prior to experience. We must think of the ‘a priori’ as a temporal category. There must be something given ‘prior’ in experience???

Eidetic structures (Husserl) are only about sense intuition, and some of those assumptions and structures seem to be Categorical intuition for Heidegger. For example, there is simplicity of givenness of unity, a unity which isn’t given from perception and sense, but still it is given, it is given categorically. There is implicit wholeness already in our perspectives of ‘aspects’ of something. Aspects must be aspects of something given. The whole is given in the aspect, but that doesn’t mean all the aspects are given. Wholeness and unity is given in the categorical intuition.



September 29, 2011

Heidegger attacks the traditional notion of truth (propositional truth – truth is a feature of a proposition). Correspondence theory of truth. In the technical concept of a state of affairs, the notion of truth is already at work to Heidegger. What is a fact? H. thinks it presupposes truth.

H. says: How do we understand the truth of the fact? It presupposes phenomenological evidence. When we use the word fact, we’ve implicitly built into it the notion of truth. Then we check to see a proposition, we’ve already looked to the fact to see the truth. He shifts the locus of truth, away from the proposition, but instead to something else (perhaps the state of affairs / facts).

The proposition doesn’t correspond/accordance to a thing. The proposition is actually disclosing the phenonena with respect to the proposition it is making. It is the showing of the table, the table showing its brownness, that confirms the proposition that “The table is brown.” Truth exists in the phenomena, not the proposition.

Heidegger is saying that categorical determinations aren’t applied to things by the mind. The categorical determinations are within the things themselves, and they are simply presented to the mind.

Truth is linked to being. The phenomena showing itself as the phenomena that it is. Phenomena are the ultimate truth-bearers, and propositions are merely derivate truth-bearers (not really the ultimate truth bearers).

WTF does “IS” mean??>?

Phenomena are distorted when we fail to understand the being of a phenomena. If a phenomena seems to show itself instrumentally vs another way, is it showing itself entirely as it is? Are we really getting at the truth of its being as it is? What is the privileged interpretation? (But, rather, it seems that there is an outer-pretation – an explication). There is a privileged way of drawing something out.



October 4, 2011

Heidegger argues there is no ‘priority of the subject’ pg. 71ish. In Kant, the a priori is part of the structure of experience, it exists before experience, and experience is only possible through these a priori structures. A priori isn’t the feature of the subject (Husserl), but rather it is the feature of being of beings (Heidegger and Platonism).

Immanent critique is a criticism from within phenomenology. It is trying to find what is getting lost in our phenomenological research, it is removing hidden assumptions and metaphysics from our current phenomenology so that it will be more phenomenological.

“What shows itself” and not “what shows itself to consciousness” is what Heiddeger means by phenomenon. Pg 81. There is no mind in Heidegger.

Semblance is a distortion of the phenomena. We can be wrong about the phenomena, about what it is. This is clearly a radical departure from Husserl and his apodictic ‘givenness’ of phenomena.

When we talk about phenomena, we aren’t talking about what appears, we are talking about ‘the appearing’. Phenomena isn’t mere appearance, it is the appearing.

There are modes of appearing which are not phenomena. A phenomena is a particular way in which beings show themselves. Semblance is a mode of appearance, but it isn’t phenomena, because the being isn’t showing itself as it is, but rather its mode of appearance stands in its our way to accessing the phenomena. Semblances conceal the phenomena and distort them.

Husserl’s and Kant’s views are semblances in themselves, and Heidegger thinks that he is deconstructing them to get at real phenomenology. Semblance is both revealing and concealing – the semblance must, in some primitive sense, resemble. Phenomenology is a methodical operation of breaking through the gradient of concealment of semblance.

What is the ‘truth’-appearance of phenomena?





October 6, 2011

Heid thinks that Husserl has a semblance of phenomenology. It is unphenomenological phenomenology. “Science progresses one funeral at a time.” Is phenomenology a transcendental psychology (Husserl) or not?

Dasein is chosen as a new word on purpose. He wishes to shed old assumptions and definition of what counts as human.

We have to get through the Husserl’s version of phenomenology, this semblance, in order to get at actual phenomenology. Husserl semblance has something right, something that resembles phenomenology, and we have separate the wheat from the chaff, and we need to understand what he did right and continue down that path. Pg. 127

There is a possibility of derivative givenness. It is when something is being given, but not given in its original givenness. That derivative is semblance. So, there is a difference between primordial, original givenness and deriviate givenness, semblance. The task of phenomenology, in part, is about getting past the semblance to the original givenness – it is recognizing that we only have a semblance, and not the original.

Semblance is an “ontological category”. It is a way a phenomena appears, namely, not exactly as its original self. Truth and sembleance are ontologically distinguished.

“Being” isn’t a being, it is the being of whatever beings are being. Lulz.

Gear/Object distinction are two different ways an object can appear. It isn’t the distinction between two different beings. The difference between a table and a chair is the difference between two beings (ontic).

Items of gear can devolve into the appearance as an object, but Heidegger claims we can’t assume the object and get to the item of gear. Objectivity might possibly be a mode or derivative of instrumentality and gear??

“Apodictic Positivism”



October 11, 2011

Semblances appearances from a certain context. You stand at this angle or perspective and the phenomena presents itself from this way, if stand in another angle or perspective, then the phenomena presents itself in another way. The phenomena, as a whole is just a sum or assemblage of its many semblances.

October 18, 2011

Presentations will be starting on the 15th of November (and 17th, and so on).

Logical investigations are a priori vs. ideas are a posteriori

Schufreider dissects my proposal in this class – see mp3.





October 20, 2011

To Heidegger, Philosophy was invented by the Greeks. The question of ‘being’ is the first philosophical question. Phenomenology is a pure methodological concept – it determines ‘how’ we research, but not ‘what’ we are researching (just yet, at least) – pg 136.

We must distinguish “what we are questioning or interrogating” and ‘what we are after’ (what do we hope to achieve or reach from interrogating something?).

Being is ‘how beings appear’ – it is an event. It isn’t some general, universal idea.

For Heidegger, it is an exotic event for someone to approach a being as a being. Animals don’t entertain the question of being because they don’t encounter beings as beings (they don’t really encounter beings). Animals aren’t struck by the fact that ‘something is’. Humans can have that exotic wonder that there is anything at all – animals are assumed to lack this event of wonder.

We don’t merely reflect on being – we, as Dasein, in fact operate with exotic interest in being.

Dasein is struck by its facticity. Anxiety from the confronting one’s own death pushes us to consider our own being.

“Being in each case one” is anyone, you are an individual, but not particular. Like “to whom it may concern.”

What are the structures that constitute Dasein (pg 153).

Dasein in its everydayness is practical. Instead of Husserl’s intentionality (which is somewhat abstract), Heidegger has a directed towards which is very teleological and in the world.

Dasein is always a particular case of Dasein, not some general thing. While Dasein has specificity, it doesn’t necessarily have individualistic personality. The “Anyone” can specify, but without pointing out personality.

Dasein is the only being that raises the question of being. And, Dasein is the only being with its temporal structures. It seems that the temporality of Dasein is linked to the fact that it raises the question fo being. It isn’t a matter of being in time (measurements). Temporality belongs to the structure of Dasein’s being.

We seem to create our own temporalities. Temporal structures are part of what make possible for us to raise the question of being (hence, “Being and Time”).

We don’t just have a past, we have a ‘having been’. We have a being of a having been. This is more than plain historical time. The sense in which Dasein has a past, my temporal particularity might actually be ‘quite a while’ – the while stretches from birth to death. My particular temporal determination is both initial operation at birth, and the terminal operation at death. It is a finite stretch of time. And, how Dasein lives its time in that stretch, which doesn’t exclude a past before my birth,…..My past doesn’t reach past before my birth. The same for the future.



October 25, 2011

We have to give a phenomenological account of Dasein, an account in its everydayness (mode of temporality), its everyday activities.

Husserl’s transcendental reduction – even if there is no world, consciousness, in its purity, remains and keeps its structure (including temporal structures).

We tend to associate body with space, and mind with time.

World as nature is thought by Descartes as the res extensa, nature is a machine. For Heidegger, what is calculable and measureable is nature? The world is the total of objects. The objects of science. Heidegger holds that Dasein is a subject, not an object.

Husserl wants to assert the priority of subjects over the objects.

Heidegger says the world is for consciousness. Consciousness is not ‘in’ the world. Dasein is ‘in’ the world in a different way.

You either argue that the subject has its being in the midst of objects, where the world is the totality of objects (realism); or you are arguing that objects have their being in the consciousness of subjects (idealism).

Heidegger agrees with Husserl that consciousness is special. But, he disagrees with transcendental psychology linked to subjectivity; Heidegger, however, imports existentialism

Pg. 156 is the argument against Husserl. It is not that Husserl is wrong, as he has opened something important up. Husserl is right about worry about the naturalization of consciousness, but he’s wrong for thinking it is consciousness vs. nature, that one must be inside the other (exclusively).

Dasein, in its everydayness, is not involved in theoretical occupations. Dasein, for the most part, is not doing philosophy. It is, instead, involved in practical engagements. Theoretical operations are founded upon this operational/instrumental being in the world. Practical engagement accounts for theoretical activities (without distorting it); but if we start from theoretical activities and try to account for practical engagement, then there is a distortion.

You don’t encounter objects as objects. “useful for something” is not the structure of objectivity. You can’t get to that ‘useful for something’ structure by taking an object and attaching value to it.

Dasein isn’t the world as the pencil is in the drawer.

The original phenomenological condition is not distinguishing myself from the world. When I’m using the pen, I’m not distinguishing myself and the pen (in some sense?), and that unity can’t be accounted for in the object/subject distinction. Heidegger thinks he can talk about objectivity from this unity, but you can’t start from objectivity to get to that unity.

Human being, in its average, everydayness, operates as a being in the world, familiar with, engaged withk, and not distinguishing itself from other objects. Being in the midst of beings is how intimate Dasein is with everything else in the world.

There is a collective, unified event…we can theoretically break them apart. This unity is more than just the sum of its parts. We start with the unified event, not the individual parts.

When you think in terms of objects, you think of a bunch of independent things which accumulate into a whole.

In instrumentality, there is no such thing as a single instrument – items of gear come together. Aristotelian substance is the primary category is objectivity, but relationship of objects is what is primary in Heidegger’s view.

Instrumentality and objectivity are ontological distinctions – beings appear differently. Within objectivity, the world is the totality of objects. Within instrumentality, the world is that which Dasein is complete integrated. To say Dasein is in the world is to say it is not a separate being, but rather it has its being in the midst of beings, unified and not distinguished from those beings.

Relationality is stressed and emphasized.

Phenomenology is the study of consciousness and existence.

There is an implicitness is Dasein that is practical and integrated. When we step back, theoretically, we begin to make explicit those features and things.

Instrumentality and objectivity are distinguished by Heidegger, and this was the flaw in Husserl (in his opinion). Husserl distorted the basic founding of phenomenology.

Husserl starts with a theoretical determination of phenomena, and Heidegger argues this is fundamental enough a level. The immediate givenness, the original givenness, is not fundamentally presented at objectivity or theoretically, but rather instrumentally.

Instrumentality/Objectivity distinction si the fundamental distinction. These are two different modes of presentation. We aren’t getting the most fundmental presentation of phenomena when they present themselves theoretically/objectively.

When something is an item of gear, it isn’t presenting itself in a series of one-sided perspectives or objectively or theoretically.

Dasein appears in a different way when we phenomena are presenting themselves objectively. In the objective encounter, Dasein is a subject, and the phenomena is an object.

Dasein isn’t a subject within the context of the mode of instrumentality. Items of Gear works together, in Husserl’s objectivity, objects standalone.

Husserl’s notion of the world is phenomenological – the horizon of horizons from the position of the consciousness (from a subject), with layers of vagueness.

The instrumental presentation is more original than the theoretical presentation, but it isn’t necessarily the true presentation.

There is a structure of co-reference in items of gear that makes it what it is. Pencils are relevant not just for writing, there are other purposes, other modes of presentation. The pencil can be used to poke a hole in something, even if it was created for that purpose, we can use it, instrumentally, for that purpose. Insofar as the pencil is being used for a purpose, whether writing or another function, then it has that a relevant, co-referenct, mode of presentation as a phenomena. It is “suitable for” or “relevant to” writing, but it is also these things for poking holes when we use a pencil in that way.

What it is for something to be relevant or have meaning is for something to appear in relationship to other things in such a way that I can do something or get something done.

“Objects” don’t exude or give off instrumentality. Phenomena do exude, however.

The structure of instrumentality is obviously teleological. In order to something, we must use something with which we can do something else (for the sake of).

We don’t impose instrumentality either, that begs the question about objectivity.

We must disclose phenomena instead.

Functional features of a pencil, a possibility that the pencil as a being can do something, is different from a property. The property of object model is still part of objectivity. Functionality, however, isn’t like this?? Functional features are meaningful and relevant – it is a part of referential structure, showing itself with respect to how it fits in that structure.

The item of gear does not stand alone. It presents itself in its relevance in a structure of reference. It is what I’m up to and what else is available around me, a context of reference, that decides the meaning of a pencil.

Husserl starts with an object and adds a function. Heidegger says he has these concepts correct, but in the wrong order. Heidegger starts with a functioning and breaks it down into objects. Hammer example.

The question of the external world is a pseudo problem for Heidegger. It only arises in the mode of objectivity. It doesn’t happen in the instrumental mode. When you are immersed in and engaged with the world, the question of whether there is an external world is not possible to ask.

The world itself as a lifeworld is a kind of socio-cultural as well as natural/material environment which only allows for certain types of operations.

Traditional definition of world (as laymen use it) – the totality of beings presenting themselves as objects. The totality of beings present-at-hand.

Heidegger – the locus in which Dasein has its being, including the practical operations.

Distinguishing beings by ‘shape’ or something trivial, you are making an ontical distinction.

Distinctive characterstics of Dasein are existentials.

The argument with Husserl is that he isn’t seeing the being of Dasein as different.

Idealism seems to reduce beings to the correlates of consciousness in Husserl. Whereas Realism seems to assert the reality of those beings indepdent and outside of consciousness.



The working together of items of gear means there isn’t an individual presentation of individual objects – instead, there is a nexus which presents an orchestration of a particular environment in which we are engaged. The way in which the elements operate are integrated into the environment. The integrity of a space as a meaningful/significant place, that sense of space, quite different from the empty space of objectivity (measurement, position, etc.), is a place of intimacy and engagement.

Placement occurs in co-determination of functional things in relation to each other. How anything shows up as suitable for anything depends on what else is available. If I need to “hammer” something, but I have a rock next to me and no hammer, then I’ll use the rock to hammer, but in another context, I wouldn’t. The same for when I’m at my workbench, without a hammer, but I have a wrench, that wrench appears differently, it appears as something which can function and have the purpose to hammer.

Dynamic mode of appearance – the wrench normally shows up as this, but without the hammer, it has a changed operation, a different appearance, all due to a function derived from a different environment. What the wrench is and what it is for is dynamically related to environment, including whether or not there is a hammer.

The fact that something appears as an item fo gear is a mode of ‘making present’. We don’t sense the phenomena appearing as a dynamic event, we simply sense them as ‘being there’, as if that functionality was a property of it.

Heidegger is stressing ‘presence’ not as a static operation, but as a dynamic temporal operation. The rock’s function is presents itself dynamically. Something takes on significance infosar as it is relevant to what I’m doing. The rock takes on significance for breaking open a nut in a way that the stick is not significant.

The bike is ready to ride. It isn’t just an object that you ride. Because it is an item of gear, it is as at the ready for your riding. It is related to your environment. There is a seemless operation that occurs in the very spatiality and suitability for doing things.

The primary issue of substance is relation and the network of referential relations for Heidegger – objectivity, obviously, is quite secondary.

At the level of instrumentality, it is clear that what appears is only with respect to the current event. Functionality is reductionistic. It reduces things to how they are significant in a particular context. Beings present themselves minimally. We only attend to those beings with regard to the work I’m up to. The “work to be done’ the ‘for the sake of which’ seems to be the primary issue.

Space comes laden with items of gear and this significance function in which I can get engaged. There is a spatiality of Dasein, a particular spatiality that it can undertake specifically when it is with other items of gear that have their own spatiality.

For Heidegger, objective space doesn’t have what are called “places” which means things don’t have a place ‘where they belong’. They can’t be ‘out of place’, they can only be in a different position.

If the table is pushed up against the wall, it is ‘out of place’ in our view, as we expect to use it for the purposes of learning/teaching/class activities. The objective space of the table against the wall would be its measurements. Chairs have their place against the table – and therefore they can be out of place. Objects have location in objective space, but they lack ‘place’.

To get from place to space, we need the notion of the region. Heidegger argues that in a functional space, space is defined by regions in which particular groups of items of gear ‘belong together’. Each region is orchestrated by a network of gear that belongs with the other gear. A can-opener on the bed doesn’t belong there, it belongs in the kitchen. The Kitchen is a region, the bedroom is a region. Space is not merely a container, it is an open relation between items of gear. Place is related to space when it isn’t merely a container, it is a region of gears related to each other. Space is not an open empty grid where objects have position, but rather space is opened up by the places, but the places are determined by the space, as a regional space, because the proper place for the chair is determined within the spatiality of the room, where the room is thought of as the space, et……(see notes). How space happens in its placement, and how placement happens in its spacing – there is a specific spatiality of Dasein. Dasein can de-distant things. I can render things nearer to me in Hiedeggerian space.

Distance is not measure objectively, but rather functionally and by significance. The cup which is objectively further away from me may be be instrumentally ‘closer’ to me than the piece of paper that is objectively closer, but instrumentally further away.

I’m looking for the proper region with the proper network of items of gear to do what I want to do. Reality seems to be broken up into a multicplity of regions.

That a chair belongs next to a table is not something I ‘re-decide’ everytime I walk into a room. It seems that a public consensus has assigned the placement. We have expectations built into the spatiality of the world.

Pg. 200

Spatiality of gear is a phenomenology of space. It isn’t a theory of space, it isn’t a view of space which is subject to metaphysical disagreement. He isn’t worried about external world, or any other that sort of ‘theory of space’.

In the gear-world, which isn’t the objective world, place is the operative category is in which we must think about space. The places, themselves, must be thought of in the structural dimension of that space, namely region. An item of gear has the place that it has in reference to other items in that region.

It is at the level of the region that ‘space’ has dimensionality (that it spreads). When you point out the object (objectively), you lose the region.

Space/region is happening ‘between’ (bad word) places. The region is the pervasive space which constitutes the vicinity in which the respective items of gear have their placement.

Can you have a region of regions? If so, a region is a place.

Heidegger says we take our orientation from the region of space. We walk into regions, it is what we mean by space, the openness in which we are free to move. It is not an empty space, however. It is a rich lived space which is already setting up the conditions for my living in it.

Things don’t have extension, wax isn’t extended. Extension isn’t in the thing. Instead, extension belongs to space. Things just have location. Space is extended across places. Space isn’t between places (in some sense), but it pervades places.

This is where significance/meaningfulness comes into play.

Heidegger’s use of “meaningful” is not value laden, it doesn’t have the same definitions we usually attribute. It isn’t just the meaningful of words (although this is connected).

Meaningfulness is first of all a mode of presence in virtue of which every entity of the world is discovered.

To say the cup has meaning is to say that it appears relevant to something I am up to.

Signs are interesting because they are conspicuous items of gear – they point out, yet instrumentally.

We can’t go back to the model of the meaning of words. Meaning is more pervasive. Words have meaning, yeah, but so do tables.

Meaningful/Significant/Relevant – same thing here. To have a relevant to what you are up to, and for a phenomena to present itself with respect to that relevance.

When a cat meow’s, it produces a functional operation of sound, something that gets us to, for example, give it food. The cat doesn’t have any semantics attached to its meow, it isn’t thinking about the meaning of the meow. Hence, meaningful/significant/relevant has a different definition here.

Meaning is minimalized. When I walk into a room, there is a minimal disclosure of the phenomena in the room. You only get a narrow band of presentations. Meaning is minimalized like this??

Dasein isn’t distinguishable (usually) from the items of gear it is using.



Pg. 236

Instead of a transcendental ego, but we are in the world, and being in the world with others.

The worldhood of the world as instrumentality.

Individual Dasein’s don’t define this, it is communal and collective Dasein, a public space, collective practices, that makes it so that a chair belongs with the table.

Who is Dasein? Being in the world and with others in the world. This ‘withness’ characterized the kind of character it is.

Who I am in my everydayness: I am everybody. The structure of the world isn’t available just to me as an individual, but to anybody and everybody. I am only present in my everydayness (acc. To Schu).



November 8, 2011

I am 3rd on day 1 to present.

To the extent I am operating in that social space, in its topological items of gear, we can look at how I am not authentic Dasein, but anyone.

Heidegger thinks inauthenticity is a way of being in the world.

Mood or disposition (attunement) is so critical because our moods are not a feature of our being alone – they belong to the structure of our beingin the world. When we talk about disposition, “Feelings” and “moods” are different.

[Husserl] Empathy is a relation that happens between two separate subjects. Connecting with another by feeling what they are feeling, but I am disconnected in that I am not feeling their feelings.

The fundamental affect of openness to the world is a mood (distinct from feeling). The mood is pervasive and integrated into us in a way that feelings aren’t. Temporality seems important here.

Mood is disclosing your being in the world as such (and apparently, this is non-cognitive). Moods are disclosive beyond the range of cognition. They can display a wide range.

When I don’t distinguish myself from others, when I am not operating as an individual (subject) separated from others, I am ‘not my own’, everybody, inauthentic. The social itself is constituted by being with others, which occurs prior to individuating subjects. “Being with” is an indespensible structure of Dasein’s being. Individuality is reducible, whereas ‘being with’ is irreducible (just like ‘being in the world’).

Dasein can fail to be a self. Self-hood is reducible/deducible. In Husserl, we are individuals, primarily (Cartesian), with other minds problem. Not so with Heidegger. There is not a structure of intersubjectivity in Heidegger.

Husserl relies upon the givenness of the other. Husserl will insist that the way in which the other human being presents itself as a phenomena is different from the way in which other objects present themselves (this is an eidetic analysis).

You present yourself as a subject with intentional acts, just like me.


We don’t prove the existence of the other, we merely assume it in our phenomenology. It is given to us. Empathy is an assumption in this sense. Empathizing with the other isn’t really a choice.

Mime-Scupltures…interaction and engagement is suspended…their personhood is in question. That is what makes the experience so weird.

Understanding is not cognitive, it is operating within my environment space.

Disposition & Mood

Understand with Interpretations

Discourse (Discoursivity) and language (articulation)



The structure of Dasein’s being is its disposition. You are characterized as a being with a disposition. Your disposition is not a property of you. It is just how you are positioned in Heideggarian space.

He critiqued Husserl in terms of objectivity and instrumentality. Now, he defines human beings in terms of instrumentality. We will see the derivate structures from instrumental engagement. The integration of user and instrument requires a different set of structures to substantiate this integration.

The location of the ‘da’ is not finding itself through reflection. Husserl thinks you are a the position, Heidegger thinks you aren’t, he thinks you only locate yourself as position here from over there.

While engaging in the world, Dasein doesn’t seem to have any primacy. It is dispersed and integrated into the world. What must a feature of Dasein be like for it to have non-identity, such that we can’t distinguish it from what it is doing? The is the most common experience we are having, and yet, he says philosophy hasn’t been able to grasp it or account for it.

If Dasein has a disposition to be taken literally, it has its being insofar as it is positioned amongst beings. Disposition is not a feature of our mental lives, but rather has we are disposed with respect to those beings to which we are already exposed and have our position precisely because of those beings.

Instrumentality indicates the sort of being we are, and the disposition/temperament of Dasein.

The structure of understanding, in Schu’s view, really sounds like a facet of me.

Some concept of ‘being’ is given in the every day operation. What is this being? There is a way of being in the world (natural attitude) that is prior to all theory.

Understanding had a meaning that was very theoretical. It can’t mean anything like want Kant meant.

Structure of Dasein’s being is a being which is open to other beings.

We normally think of a subject as supplying the framework and conception of objects. But, this isn’t the case for Heidegger.

What does interpretation have to do with understanding? Interpretation is a laying out. Understanding lays outs a particular situations in a certain way.

Beach, nut rock example. The situation is layed out through that rock such that I can engage with it to use it to break open the nut. This all happens implicitly. I don’t impose a structure on the rock, but rather, interpret it, it is layed out, the possibility spring forth, it is disclosed. Understanding operates in respect to current determinations. A prior projections is really just a way of presentation.??





November 15, 2011

I presented. Schu’ has an argument, go back and listen to it.





November 29, 2011

It is the ‘uncovering’ of phenomena by Dasein that gives Dasein its particular way of being.

Dasein is an openness in the midst of being. Disposition is the structure of Dasein’s being, mood is the concrete determination in which Dasein’s position in the midst of beings is disclosed to it explicitly in the midst of its disposition.

Your disposition involves a relational determination with how it is going for me with respect to how I relate to the world. Think of “how’s it going?” and “how do you find yourself?”. That finding yourself is literal, you find yourself in the midst of being. That is theonly way to find yourself. You even find yourself spatially. I locate myself in a situation. I don’t start from a self-contained position that then moves around the room.

Disposition, Understanding, Discourse – these keep Dasein open to phenomena in the way that it is.

Fallen = the idea that Dasein, by its very nature, fails to understand the type of being it is. It is drawn into operations which do not help to articulate the being that it is. A being which forgets itself, which doesn’t attend to itself, of course would fail to to realize what type of being it is. It tends not to realize things about it itself, so how would it realize that phenomenological fact about itself? Understanding itself within the instrumental context…

Inauthenticity is failure to understand the original condition, instrumentality, etc. being with beings. Splitting theory and practice.

Authenticity must be a lower level of engagement, it must be ‘being in the world’.

Anxiety – the structure of significance has broken down entirely, and everything presents itself as meaningless. You would not be oriented in space anymore. The conditions which establish the region deeterminations of space would break down.

3 operations nihilated in Anxiety –

Integration, Spatial, Social. These structures are neutralized. Disintegrated, disorientation in spatial relation (spaced out), and dissocation (de-socialization and self separation).

It isn’t necessarily the phenomena that Dasein experiences. Of course, there might be a semblance in between. This is a rejection of the Husserlian notion. Nothing can come between you and the phenomena in Husserl, otherwise, it seems that apodicticity is in jeopardy.

That something presents itself as at all is taken as given. A phenomena presenting itself as a semblance isn’t usually an ontical problem, but rather an ontological problem. The understand of the being of a phenomena may not be coming through, it may be inadequate, and thus there is an ontological issue.

The immanent critique works to advance what it is critiquing. It sets the limits on it. It isn’t a rejection, but a setting of the limit. From the inside of phenomenology, we come to understand its limits.

Husserl – eidetic structures are given by intuition, they are neither inducted nor deducted. It isn’t a conceptual determination for Husserl, it comes from the phenomenological way of thinking.



Falling, Dasein in flight from itself. It is a structure of Dasein’s being that he found phenomologically. This isn’t Religious “Fallen”, it is being drawn into everydayness and inauthentic, becoming ‘anybody’.

Dasein has its concern for the world, it cares for others, and it co-originally cares about itself. It is the kind of being about which its own being is at issue for it. It is concerned about its being.

    The living out of its being

    ??

Care is a ‘fleshy, concrete’ intentionality. The muddy, earthy, homo and humous being connected here (in the myth)?? Care is projecting towards the future, even in relation to its current concerns.

Noematic correlates and noetic acts of Husserl obviously demonstrates the primacy of consciousness and the subject. Hiedegger starts with beings, and Dasein being in the world, then the priority of Dasein isn’t all that clear.

Since Dasein isn’t a subject, you can’t have the subjugation and prioritization of the subject/object perspective.

I think both Husserl and Heidegger are mapping together ontology (in the non-phenomenological sense) and epistemology, but also experience and consciousness.

Hiedegger is doubting an interaction of subject/object. What is the actual relationship?

Heidegger thinks that the notion of experience draws us away from what is actually happening. Experience, in some sense, isn’t what he wants to analyze, but rather the phenomena itself (which is what experience is about).

In the case of fear, there is something which is threatening.

There is a fear of death, when I’m in a really awkward position where I might die or something. The impending immediacy of my death.

Dread of death is different from fear of death. Dread of death is a reflection of (1) non-autonomy and (2) a concern over itself, and concern about its eventual death and becoming nothingness in the world.

Accidents on the interstate are a good example of Dread. They aren’t immediately fearing getting into a car crash, but in some sense, we still think about death generically in the future.

The ‘anybody’ Dasein is impersonal, it is a structure of my being. The analysis of Death brings up this issue. Death brings up that each Dasein has its own death, it individuates Daseins. We have the impersonal Dasein (no positional consciousness or ego, no transcendental subject) and also the individuated Dasein with its own death.

The ego is really just a semblance of the self-sameness of Dasein, the authenticity.
