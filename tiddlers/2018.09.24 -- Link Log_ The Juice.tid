* Confirm My Bias

*** I am proud of how we are able to do what we do with what little we have.

*** Unfortunately, not nearly radical enough. Even this will fail.

*** Oops. Lol. I hate to say I'm not surprised.
** https://twobithistory.org/2018/09/16/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss.html
*** I love and hate it. Finding salience in RSS is hard. Having control I adore. Hard to decentralize and automate everything I want.
*** I still use RSS directly, and a large number of services I use imitate it.

* Disconfirm My Bias

*** Still not my experience, but it is evidence.

* Think About It

*** Wish I could have wrestled with this man. He clearly respects our teacher.
** https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html
*** I remember the abuses and failures. I think you have to have a librarian do this work or you build good bots. I just don't see another way around it.

*** Harmony is dead. Calls for civility are veils for a status quo DESTINED to enslave and destroy us all.

*** If you cannot start thinking about what [[T42T]] markets really look like, the game is over. Trump is a symptom of liberalism, and reinvention is only an attempt to shift away from the blame you severely deserve. Admittedly, I'm interested in Georgism, but ad hominem is going to give me great pause here.

*** You should be confident when you do your best. You're gonna have to learn when not to give a shit what other people think [[irwartfrr]] (not the claim that we shouldn't engage in [[T42T]]). How many girls have your symbolic logic, stats, and calculus skills, and you are only 12? How many have even read half the books you have? How many can stand toe-to-toe with a philosophy professor? How many can draw like you? How many have your digital literacy prowess? Most aren't going to understand you, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be confident in yourself. You have a lot of things very different about you, and that means you will need to set many typical expectations and opinions aside. You must take RISKS with your talents, and you must start taking them often while you still can. Practice how to ~~fall~~ ~~fail~~ not immediately achieve your goals gracefully again and again because effective risk-taking is one of the fundamental empirical skills in wisdom (arguably it just IS the empirical skill).
