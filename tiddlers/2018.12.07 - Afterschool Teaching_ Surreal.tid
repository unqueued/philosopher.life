title: 2018.12.07 - Afterschool Teaching: Surreal

This was heartbreaking and surreal. It was a chaotic evening learning about the structures, the people, the customs, the values, the beliefs and desires, the goals, and so on. This was a throwback to another culture from my childhood, only these kids were far wealthier by comparison (there were some rough kids in the bunch, but there were several $700 phones flashed in hallways as well).

There were 3 cops for 200 students, then 1 for 40 by the end. The lockdown system, mirror-tinted windows, constant walkie-talkie usage, and various safety procedures were absurd. Everyone was well behaved except a few rascals that I hope to befriend.

It is disturbing to see the number of advertisements on the school buses and grounds (like the technical college).

I'd guess most of the adults I interacted with were sub-100-IQ (a couple of them lovely people likely doing their best with what they have). We sat in the main office, and the cop, my co-workers (who are in college), a student's mother, and the director were bragging about not reading any books since high school. `/facepalm`. I'm ashamed of the fact that I don't read nearly enough, and I've definitely had months where I didn't read a book. I get that (I'm completely a hypocrite here). They were not lamenting it though.

The interim job is filled. Lol. That's okay. Delp wants me to go get certified (I have zero respect for that piece of paper, but if it makes the monkeys around me happy, great!). The gap between us is so large, I would have a hard time describing to myself, let alone him. He clearly cares in his way (which is not to say it is justified, but I think it is largely justified). My privilege is absurd in this environment: I am experientially wealthy. I might be just as broke as these kids family's, but half these kids haven't been outside a 50-mile radius from their house. 

The reading censorship and blocking kids from the library made me sick (KYS). The people I work with would be angry for anyone saying "shit" out loud or in a book. I was disgusted. Fuck that noise. I'm going to hand the kids whatever books they want. If they ask me to challenge them with a book, I will. 

The computer lab and robotics were fine. They aren't allowed to go on any sites besides a very narrow pre-approved whitelist (but it's clear nobody set the network up to block). I don't mind kids messing around on computers though; they desperately need to do it more, imho.

It's more glorified babysitting that I could possibly have imagined, and my hands are tied strongly on even being able to teach. This is just a program to make sure kids aren't by themselves as their parents work. Have I mentioned how much I despise capitalists and reactionazis today?

The expectations of me could not be any lower (or, I don't understand what these people really want?).

My teamleader sounds like (for realsies) and reasons even more poorly than Kenneth Parcell in 30 Rock. I am amused! He's a nice guy. His GF is sweet too. I think I can get along. They do good for these kids on a shoestring budget.

The paperwork would make you cry. It's obviously just meant to make sure the program is funded. The disparity between what occurs and what is planned (and what is supposed to be planned) is numbing.

Well, I hope I serve these humans effectively. I don't know enough about who they are, where they are going, and what they need.
