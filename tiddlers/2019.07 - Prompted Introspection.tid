!! Audit:

* Brief. I am less happy with this than usual.
* I'm footnoting more than usual here. I don't know why.
* My wife commented that I'm pointing more. She's right.
* The banal vanillaness compared to [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] shows up heavily. Yet, this still pulls me on to the pages.
* I'm turning up the sarcasm here. Go for it!
* This log has become more like "shootin' the shit" during Sunday school, but with people that can handle my insanity.
* I look forward to the day that I get to walk through every one of these and prune the list down to something I think is worth a constant circle.
