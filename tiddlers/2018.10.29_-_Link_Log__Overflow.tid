*** Gorgeous, but deadly. Stakeholder vs. Shareholder is a classic model. Reich is overly narrow in how he defines stakeholder and shareholder; it borders on a false dichotomy or a kind of Overton window which purposely aims to hide socialism. He is centrist/rightist. He points to a problem of capitalism, but only in the hopes to improve the appearance of it just enough to actually maintain the status quo. This is not how you fix inequality. This didn't even look at inequality directly. Repeat after me, Reich: the workers must own the means of production.
