Perhaps by "taking my autism prescriptively" means that my brother doesn't appreciate: that I'm taking my autism so seriously, that I use it to understand myself and the world, that I'm okay with being aneurotypical, that I'm not shooting to think more conventionally. I don't see why though. What is his argument?

My brother continues to detach from textual interfaces with me. Why? He prefers the voice channels only, and even then it seems only over the phone, especially when it allows him to do other things while talking to me hands-free, etc. It's likely pulling teeth to get him to chat engage in actual messenging with me. 

Actually, when my brother is playing on his computer, he finds me intrusive and not worth his time. He turns chat off entirely, and he's uninterested in fixing the aspect of it might annoy him. Talking to me online is not important to him. He doesn't actually want to chat with me. He reminds me of Bob, who only called us when he was on the treadmill; it's psychopathic. 

I regularly put down what I'm doing to converse with my brother. He does not do that. He is almost always multi-tasking, and in many cases, I'm quite secondary. In the tit-for-tat game, he's not interested in devoting himself in the same way. I don't understand. He is willing to give money for example, and that costs him time. Somehow the time working just isn't the same emotional investment/cost as literally engaging me in text. This is so weirdly irrational that it says something very crucial about him and us. 

His emotional investment is clearly self-interested, and unfortunately there is tit-for-tat in that game.

I suggest that my newfound work in [[The Good]], in putting down my [[Axioms of h0p3]], I'm alienating us. He refuses to consider it. How can we be compatible on such grounds? Our relationship will be forever marred by our disagreement at this level. I can see that part of this is my attempt to reach my wife as well, [[k0sh3k]].

A rejection of my life's project is a rejection of me.

I go down the path without him. I hope he knows I will always love him.

I think this wiki feels positively analog in a digital world. It has profound ludditic aspects to it.
