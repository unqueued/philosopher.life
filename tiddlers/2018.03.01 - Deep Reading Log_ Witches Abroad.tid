Hyperreal. Very interesting how much emphasis is put on the ontology of stories themselves. The author is a philosopher, without a doubt.

Brilliant. I wished we spent more time hearing about the ontology and epistemology of the world. It's far too brief. It's not fair.

Story about stories, reflections and mirrors. Does this book steal our soul, or is that just a superstition? 

Desiderata is a beautiful, desirable name. Names are chosen carefully in this book, but how much do they matter?

Lilith is hilarious. Beautiful psychopathy, and the mirror is the tool of narcissists. Ironically, they never truly see themselves.

They are straight up mean to Magrat.
