*** No shit, sherlock. Ofc, preach, yo, but how is this groundbreaking? That is the state of the 50-person Rawlsian academic circle. =/. I'm never going to be able to hand the next spiralic step if they intend to move this slowly.
*** You want to take risks behind the [[VOI]], try this. Jesus. You can't answer golem at that pace, and you fucking know it. 

* Think About It

*** Love the market analysis, but you still have missed the fundamental problem (materialists, lawdy; do not attempt to substitute political autonomy for moral autonomy wholesale). Freewill is the only method, and defeating poisoned origins is much harder than it looks. It's gotta be bootstrapped, and it has to be metaphysics. There's no other way out. It's hard to convince people they are assenting to a state of learned helplessness, purposely avoiding looking at possibility, and recognizing what tends to be the more egoistic reasons for their actions than they would prefer to admit to even themselves.
*** "if freedom lies in that which cannot be renounced, then, by implication, all that can and could be renounced, is illusionary and ideological in the first place." - This is arguably the most difficult problem of Kantianism, even for a Platonist. Strike out "freedom" and talk about justification instead.
*** I've pointed my hooded brother to Saint Kierkegaard before (I can't say I agree all the way down here with the saint). There are some lines here which seem to fit him so [[beautifully]]. 
*** The essentialization point is on the money, hence why it's my top-pick quote for [[power]].
*** I cannot assent to the conclusion. Maybe it is half right.

*** //Selective// empathy is the only option available to us ([[fff]]). I agree to the dialectical point. Of course, select your {[[Axioms]]} wisely.

*** So close to the edge of the noumena here. I like that it points to [[The Necessity]], but the wording is wildly wrong. You don't get to help yourself to the claim "The Universe is immaterial" but rather the immaterial is necessary for the material. If you really think physics is insufficient, then say that (this seems like an attempt to keep physics as ruling the roost [contradictorily]).

*** So hard to word those questions well. e.g. Global warming is something that the US government has not taken seriously enough, and corruption is part of the issue.
*** Also, so good to be reminded of the party we threw when Scalia died. <3. Piece of shit.

*** True words. Still don't see a critical analysis of neo-liberalism. Entirely qualified to pick up Marxism if you had the integrity.

*** It's not simply half; it's far more, and you should not forget the world at large (about half of redditors aren't American). Keep reading. It's quite a place to wander and lurk systematically.
