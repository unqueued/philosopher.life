title: 2019.07.31 - Computer Musings: Basic Functionality

We've run into a different snafu with networking to Bob today. I am convinced that syncing the Bob files and running multiple instances is the correct method. Unfortunately, I think syncing files with Bob might also be problematic; I've run into various kinds of timing problems.

---

Just going to build the basic functions I have to have to do anything first. I have me a wiki workstation in Chromium now, and FF is functioning. I have my text editors, zsh, and basic i3 up and running. I have sound, video, basic syncs, and I'm slowly migrating everything. It might not look pretty, and it might only be an infant, but it's growing.

---

Font problems are not xrandr. I think the i3 config is fine, and it shows up in dolphin wrong as well. 

Tried [[dotfiles: .Xresources]] route, and voila! I have what I want for half the system. lxappearance and .profile does the job.

Gussying it up now.

---

Sound is only kind of working. None of media keys register, sound works through silenced tabs in FF, and unsilencing a tab playing music in FF increases volume. So much is b0rked at the moment.

Fancy pctl list-sink with an awk does the trick.

Deadbeef is finally not killing my eyes and the media keys are up and running. Yay!

---

I'm pushing toward a more focused, symlinked, and syncable setup for the wiki here. Backups of everything.

---

Also, FF is flying like lightning again. No hacks around memory. Balloon up all you want! I'm back to having a system that makes sense.
