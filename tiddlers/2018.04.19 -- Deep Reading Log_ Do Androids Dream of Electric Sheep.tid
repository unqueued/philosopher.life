title: 2018.04.19 -- Deep Reading Log: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep

I'm reading the novel and the graphic novel upon my brother's recommendation. This is the novel.

Serious questions of identity, freedom, and mind. Like the problems of psychohistory in Asimov, we are left to question whether or not this actually makes sense.

I'd like to see how to dial the right stochastic pleasure attitude/feelings for maximizing utility in a vacuum (at least particularized to the individual's biology, etc.).

Don't understand what "Mercer" is...but I can't help but be reminded of the Mercer family of today.

I really don't understand the need for owning an animal. Is it really about empathy as they claimed, or really more of a social symbol. Virtue signal either way, I suppose. It seems to be a source of shame.

I'd love the ability to just change how I'm feeling, what motivates me, etc. It seems to me that one would have enormous incentives and abilities to fine-tune and maximize the value of being able to so directly program one's mind with this tool. You could just turn off pain. You could feel and be whoever you want to some large extent. I think this is fascinating.
