title: Employment: Hacks

Applications:

* Apply to the job between 6am and 10am (their time). The odds of landing an interview after 10am falls by 10% every 30 minutes.
* Write "Negotiable" for desired salary
* Substitute "will" for "can" language.


Networking:

* If youâ€™re unemployed or underemployed, start volunteering.


After Hire:

* When you start, ask for a copy of your future performance review sheet.


Socializing:

* Thank the person for their patience, instead of apologizing for the delay.
* Substitute "My understanding was" for "I assumed" language.
* Keep "get well soon" and "congratulations" cards in your desk to initiate trust-building.
