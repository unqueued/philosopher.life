The battery died. Something's definitely up with our car's circuits. I have no idea what it is. k0sh3k missed church (sucks, since she spent a lot of time preparing her lesson). Luckily, I had bought the battery, in case we needed it. I learned how to replace the battery in this car. We took back the non-working charger and I picked up a dumber one (I hope). I really just need it to trust me when I say I've connected it to the terminals on the battery. I can't reprogram these specialized devices though. I want it to be as analog as possible because it gives me the most freedom possible. 

We also set up sites for the whole family.
