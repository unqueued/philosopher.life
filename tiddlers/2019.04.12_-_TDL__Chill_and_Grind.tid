title: 2019.04.12 - TDL: Chill and Grind

* I'm starting to feel like m16 is coming.
* Substance use sounds good.
* I'm still grinding away in my readings. It's slow, and that's okay.
* We probably need to go shopping.
* We really need that refund. But, I'm not counting my chickens.
** My wife's tax info needs to be fixed.
