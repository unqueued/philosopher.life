How are you doing?
SAT 7:46 PM
I linked someone to your wiki. It was pretty sad a first.
SAT 7:46 PM
I'm doing well enough. It's a chill Saturday.
SAT 7:55 PM
How about you?
SAT 7:55 PM
I stayed up all night. Alternating hot and cold on back. I am in alot less severe pain.
SAT 7:56 PM
Yay. =)
SAT 7:56 PM
Agreed. Still weak and have pain. But I can get out of bed without cursing and nearly crying. Lol.
SAT 7:56 PM
Sent to bed at 8am. Slept to 3pm.
SAT 7:57 PM
Any of your meds helping with the pain?
SAT 7:58 PM
Um. I'm taking my own meds.
SAT 7:59 PM
They gave me a non narcotic muscle relaxer.
SAT 7:59 PM
I have Valium which is a narcotic muscle relaxer. She said yeah... Maybe take (Robaxin) in the am and your Valium in the evening. Lol
SAT 8:00 PM
Lol
SAT 8:00 PM
She was a PA. Csn prescribe narcotics.
SAT 8:00 PM
Noice.
SAT 8:00 PM
Cant*
SAT 8:00 PM
Can't wait to get my guitar wires up and play a little. I'm afraid I might have to shim the neck. We will see.
SAT 8:01 PM
I'd like to take this time to respond to your letter. Maybe Monday.
SAT 8:03 PM
I haven't forgot. Just taking my time.
SAT 8:04 PM
Well, don't rush, lol! It sounds like you need to sleep as much as you can.
SAT 8:04 PM
I'm surprised you are working on anything.
SAT 8:05 PM
I can't sit still man. Unless it's dinner then bed.
SAT 8:05 PM
Otherwise I'm doing shit.
SAT 8:05 PM
I hear that.
SAT 8:05 PM
But normally physical shit. I'm in a computer chair. Making a mess of the dining room floor and table.
SAT 8:06 PM
Wife is cool.
SAT 8:06 PM
She knows I get really depressed if I can't be productive.
SAT 8:06 PM
So who did you decide to link to my wiki?
SAT 8:17 PM
An educated friend from HS.
SAT 8:24 PM
He is a guitar music friend.
SAT 8:24 PM
He went out west got educated. Then moved back and married a chick from. Our HS.
SAT 8:25 PM
I apologize if I overstepped.
SAT 8:25 PM
Nope. It's open!
SAT 8:25 PM
I told him (the smartest guy I know has a wiki, and linked him)
SAT 8:26 PM
He was aggressively suspect of you ur arrogance.
SAT 8:26 PM
For good reason, lol
SAT 8:26 PM
And claimed ( I know all kinds of ppl like this, I'm not afraid of this guy)
SAT 8:26 PM
And I was just sharing something, that to me, is intimate. He was judging by your about me section. I told him he was drunk and out of line and to go to bed.
SAT 8:27 PM
He read more the next day then said "your friend is cool, showed me how horrible of a step dad I am to caden"
SAT 8:27 PM
Lol.
SAT 8:28 PM
Lol.
SAT 8:28 PM
For some reason when I prefaced with the smartest guy I know. People take that as a fuxking challenge....
SAT 8:28 PM
People are idiots.
SAT 8:28 PM
People have strong reactions to it. It is kinda insane most of the time.
SAT 8:29 PM
Speaking of, I'm studying this right now:
SAT 8:29 PM
https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/b1uc9k/internet_causes_global_psychosis/
SAT 8:29 PM
It pertains to us.
SAT 8:29 PM
The abstract is on point. I wish there was something that could. Be don't.
SAT 8:30 PM
Done.
SAT 8:30 PM
Like group conversations with wecams about legit subjects that wasn't just a bunch of horney guys beating odd.
SAT 8:31 PM
Off
SAT 8:31 PM
This may be a million dollar idea.
SAT 8:31 PM
I just came up with.
SAT 8:31 PM
That is a hard problem to solve.
SAT 8:32 PM
VR and voice modulation might solve some problems, but it's gonna to have enough to pass the network effect threshold.
SAT 8:33 PM
That for engineers to work out.
SAT 8:35 PM
Well, it's a cost problem too.
SAT 8:35 PM
I just need to create the verbiage and idea of the platform.
SAT 8:35 PM
Probably would need to blow around $2k on a VR ready-computer and set.
SAT 8:36 PM
Most users can't afford that.
SAT 8:36 PM
I think digital avatars in games come closest after that.
SAT 8:36 PM
It's basically a chat room with videos minimum number of occupants to a room. User created and company created.
SAT 8:36 PM
Nah. You just need to be able to stream 15 or so webcams.
SAT 8:37 PM
You probably won't solve the rando horny guys beatin' off without virtualizing away sex.
SAT 8:37 PM
That's OK. If they pay. Moderators in every room. And have a period of no video in each room before you can ahow
SAT 8:38 PM
Maybe one hour.
SAT 8:38 PM
But if they want user created to for circle jerks that is code named gay bear. Lol. Idgaf. As long as you pay with credit card and verify age.
SAT 8:39 PM
We are all adults.
SAT 8:39 PM
Solving multiple people trying to yell or talk over one another.... What is the best size group that minimizes that.
SAT 8:40 PM
Talk to a sociologists.
SAT 8:40 PM
Probably depends on a bunch of factors.
SAT 8:40 PM
Make it an app that you can do on your phone too. To meet random people. Have a profile section.
SAT 8:40 PM
Reminds me of scheduled video hangouts where people chat on a particular topic.
SAT 8:41 PM
Could also be used for one on one video chat
SAT 8:41 PM
Excatly. But you could hop into both user created rooms or generic rooms.
SAT 8:41 PM
Market as minimizing the keyboard warriors.
SAT 8:42 PM
Shown yourself....
SAT 8:42 PM
I think the tech isn't new at all. I think whatever would be new about this would be whatever drove people to actually use it.
SAT 8:42 PM
Lol
SAT 8:42 PM
It's all. About marketing.
SAT 8:42 PM
That might be right.
SAT 8:43 PM
I see a lot of ephemeral communications platforms doing well these days.
SAT 8:43 PM
People are tired of text and jackasses in comments sections of stuff. But really people are alone and sad.
SAT 8:43 PM
They want to connect with people.
SAT 8:43 PM
You could be a millionaire with me.
SAT 8:44 PM
Remote vulnerability is hard to do well, and vulnerability is fundamental to building those connections.
SAT 8:44 PM
What do you mean by that?
SAT 8:44 PM
We have to slowly reveal ourselves to each other, rely upon our lizard brains to do some empathic math unconsciously, etc. There has to be risk that makes sense.
SAT 8:44 PM
I think physical classrooms are radically superior to online classrooms for this.
SAT 8:45 PM
When I'm in a class for people, my entire body is aware of the fact that I don't want to look stupid or fuck anything up in that social context.
SAT 8:45 PM
When you virtualize communications, it becomes abstracted and distant enough that the vulnerability disappears.
SAT 8:45 PM
Highly cooperative behaviors often become unjustifiably punished in virtual settings.
SAT 8:46 PM
You are right.
SAT 8:46 PM
I will agree, however, that the loneliness epidemic is going to require a revolution in how to communicate remotely. I cannot say that is sufficient, but it is clearly necessary.
SAT 8:46 PM
Trust is not easy to build.
SAT 8:47 PM
Indeed. But as will my pile. Of million dollar ideas.
SAT 9:27 PM
By the waste side they will fall
