title: 2017.08.16 - Carpe Diem Log

* Waking up before alarm, but still sleeping to alarm.
* Was quick this morning, and Chris picked me up. Paid through refusal. Cool dude, no doubt.
* Worked hard.
** I'm looking to see what it takes to move up, the political structures, the ways of doing things, immersing myself in this video game. 
* Came home, my wife had handled everything for the car. Kids helped me clean it out. 
** They set the alarm off, and I had to get dressed inside-out just throwing clothes on trying to stop the rudeness. Neighbors laughed. I am annoyed.'
* Cannabliss
* Talked to Charlie! 
** Apologized for not being able to take his call during the scheduled time. Was the car emergency and being driven back by Chris (would have been rude). I texted him I would call him 15 minutes later. I did.
** I love talking to Charlie. I should call him everyday. 
*** Charlie gets me a way that others do not. I get to talk about very geeky things with him (we clearly have two very distinct understandings of the world, and he is so wonderful to talk to about). 
* Talked to MB. I love her so much!
** She called me.
** She had been dealing with depression, anxiety, and paranoia. Shit sucks, yo. =( I know that feel.
* My son got his new toolbox (a steal at $6). =)
** A few things from Amazon to make life more doable. 
* My children cleaned and organized some today. They fucked around quite a bit.
* Fireman Time!
* Writing, waiting for my wife. Then Bed! Late night.
