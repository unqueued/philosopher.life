I save quotes inconsistently, scattered across paper journals, Notepad.txts, cellphone photos, and random pieces of paper I'd thoughtlessly dumped in the recycling bin. I'm terribly disorganized.

The first entry in my current journal begins with a quote from Jane Austen's //Persuasion//:

    "...they all went indoors with their new friends, and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think of accommodating so many."

By my precious numinous/voluminous claim, I simply meant that God is not better understood through an excessive expenditure of words. One of the more ridiculous books in my library is this huge tome on the Sermon on the Mount by Martin Lloyd-Jones. What the gospel writers saw fit to condense into a quick maybe 20-minute read, is not //necessarily// better understood (in the way it needs to be understood) by being teased apart with its elements rigorously defined.

To the extent I am speaking from an unacknowledged anti-intellectualism, I am impoverished. Maybe you'll prove me wrong. I also don't want our discourse to become a burden to you. 

Also, I guess we'll get to the question of free will eventually. I sometimes wonder if even the fact of this question was imparted to us by God or the devil. I genuinely expect you'll help me clarify some thoughts on the matter.
