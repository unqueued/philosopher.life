How's your week going so far?
Mar 25 12:39pm
Pretty good . ðŸ˜Š how are you?
Mar 25 12:41pm
I'm doing well. Grinding along with my family. It's pleasant.
Mar 25 12:41pm
Awesome. I'm glad you guys are well.

How's your grand daughter enjoying her time off of school?
Mar 25 1:19pm
Lol she's loving it. They have given them online stuff to do. She's enjoying the time off tho. Now they have extended it to the 24th of April so im thinking they may not go back.
Mar 25 1:21pm
I'm glad that she has some online stuff to do and excellent time off.
Mar 25 1:29pm
I have no idea what's going to happen.
Mar 25 1:29pm
It's a time of uncertainty.
Mar 25 1:29pm
Yes it definitely is. You never know from day to day what's going to happen. I saw where they opened up a part of Yale as a hospital is that right?
Mar 25 1:30pm
I don't know well enough what Yale is doing. Yale has it's own hospital. They've been sending lots of messages.
Mar 25 1:41pm
I think it was part of a gymnasium they said they were going to use in case I had to. Least that's what I think anyway. How's your wife doing working at home? Are your kids doing okay?
Mar 25 1:42pm
It's been stressful but productive for my wife. I'm lucky to have her home. We've not had everyone in the same house all day for weeks ever.
Mar 25 1:51pm
Kids are doing well. We've been working hard.
Mar 25 1:51pm
We're naturally quarantined in a way, so not a lot of change for them on this front.
Mar 25 1:52pm
They're great to hear.
Mar 25 1:53pm
That's
