"""
[10:38 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Sertraline is weird dude.
[10:55 AM]  h0p3: What are the effects for you?
[10:56 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I woke up at 5:30 and couldn’t fall back asleep for about an hour, like full on wide awake. I have episodes of insomnia but this was different than usual. I’m feeling a little brain haze and have a sour stomach too.
[10:57 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: During that hour I did some reading on it too, apparently If this is the worst of it, we’re doing okay. :joy:
[10:58 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m not sure if it’s placebo or not— gonna give it a fair shot to find out for sure.
[11:13 AM]  h0p3: Ah, I hope you will get more sleep. I appreciate your focus and awareness. It's smart (I wish I did that a decade ago, like you have). I think it's not always easy to do, particularly if you are prone to depression or anxiety.
[11:14 AM]  h0p3: Keep a notebook/journal so you have evidence to think about. That will complete the "fair shot" for you. SSRI's are notoriously not significantly better than placebo.
[11:44 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’ll do just that. If it’s not helpful, I’d like to have reasons why ready for my doctor.
[12:06 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Time for destruction double dnd.
[12:22 PM]  h0p3: Have fun! :slight_smile:
[2:02 PM]  h0p3: Also, did you down the encounter in FF?
[2:07 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Aye. Finished it in two pulls and moved on to the next one. 

[9:57 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I hope all your writings are fruitful today. :slight_smile:
[1:06 PM]  h0p3: Thank you. :slight_smile:
[1:06 PM]  h0p3: How's your day going?
[1:06 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: It's okay. Struggling with the medicine but I've gotta give it an honest try before writing it off.
[1:07 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Feeling like a zombie haha
[1:07 PM]  h0p3: Ugh.
[1:07 PM]  h0p3: Dude, I hate that feeling.
[1:07 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: The potential side effects are really scary too, but I'm writing everything down that I experience.
[1:08 PM]  h0p3: Assuming you aren't given an immediate reason to stop, how long will your testing go?
[1:10 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I've got 30 now and one refill. Going back in 6 weeks to talk more about it
[1:10 PM]  h0p3: Cool.
[1:10 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: So I'll be dipping into the second round.
[1:11 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I will only quit prematurely if I absolutely cannot handle the side effects or they don't go away after a few weeks.
[1:12 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: But I'll also consult the doctor before aborting too.
[1:12 PM]  h0p3: This shit is no fun.
[1:13 PM]  h0p3: Speaking of fun, how'd your DnD gaming, go?
[1:13 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Our DM had to end early because he started getting sick. The second game went all the way and was enjoyable.
[1:14 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: So it was alright haha
[1:14 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Family time was good?
[1:15 PM]  h0p3: Hrm. That is an interesting idea. I'm not used to seeing multiple DMs like that. I wonder if it would make everyone a better player if they everyone had to DM. An hour for each player to DM their own game for a couple months.
[1:15 PM]  h0p3: Family Time was outstanding. I want a million more of those.
[1:15 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: :slight_smile:
[1:15 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: That's wonderful to hear.
[1:16 PM]  h0p3: Yeah, it was not as draining as I thought it would be.
[1:16 PM]  h0p3: Cannabliss works miracles for me.
[1:16 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: wooooooo hahaha
[1:19 PM]  h0p3: My daughter finished off some scripting for our wikis that allow us to look back in the past (this day last year kind of thing, but it's a cross-section of this day from all years on the wiki: https://philosopher.life/#Yearly%20Cross-section ). It was very useful to us to be able to point out progress for my offspring over the years. Sometimes, it is hard for us to see how far we've come, and the evidence just sits right there for us.
[1:19 PM]  h0p3: That and using the [[Family Log]] as another centerpiece for discussions worked really well.
[1:20 PM]  h0p3: Like engaging in science here to parent and connect all the way down with my offspring.
[1:21 PM]  h0p3: (I'm a terrible scientist, but sometimes Frankenstein works out)
[1:36 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I like it! It's a great resource for sure. :slight_smile:
[1:36 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Bah. Science is just frankensteining 

[10:06 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Have a great day!
[12:00 PM]  h0p3: You too, homie.
[12:00 PM]  h0p3: What are your plans for today?
[12:02 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: It’s patchmas but I have to scrub my gross human body first haha.
[12:03 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m working now, gonna get some outlining done too. :slight_smile:
[12:03 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Today is a better day for mental health but I’m still having a few oddities.
[12:03 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: What about you?
[12:06 PM]  h0p3: Lol.  I hope patchmas is good for you, your work so easy it requires no focus, and your outlining productive.
[12:06 PM]  h0p3: What do you hope to outline today?
[12:06 PM]  h0p3: I'm glad you feel more normal.
[12:11 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Working on my manuscript and thanks!
I feel more focused today. Less nauseous but still slightly off. Sleeping is not good right now haha.
[12:12 PM]  h0p3: My autistic savant uncle-in-law, [[Charlie]], has this bit he does where I ask him "How are you doing?" and he'll say, "hold on for a moment, and let me see"...like he's doing this self-assessment from the outside. I have no idea why, but your answer reminded me of my beloved uncle.
[12:13 PM]  h0p3: Oh, so nice to have focus. I'm going to be trying Modafinil soon.
[12:13 PM]  h0p3: It's hard to not be anxious in this world.
[12:13 PM]  h0p3: There's so many good reasons to be anxious, lol.
[12:14 PM]  h0p3: I think that's one of my favorite parts of vidya games, getting immersed in them, forgetting the world outside so thoroughly.
[12:16 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Sometimes I really feel like I need to think about how I feel haha. Sometimes [[L]] can tell something’s wrong before I can.
[12:17 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: What’s modafinil? :eyes:
[12:19 PM]  h0p3: :heart: Your wife loves you. It's so good to have your SO know you, think and feel on your behalf. Also, the locution is hilarious feel->think->feel->etc. I think (ha) there's something really right about that.
[12:19 PM]  h0p3: Modafinil is for rat bastards who want to be focused, sleep less, and be so productive. All the cool kids are doing it, man.
[12:23 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: That sounds spooky haha. But think of all the work you could get done!
[12:23 PM]  h0p3: Lol, yeah. I'm curious to see what happens.
[12:26 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Any weird potential side effects concerning you?
[1:52 PM]  h0p3: https://www.gwern.net/Modafinil#side-effects
Modafinil
Effects, health concerns, suppliers, prices & rational ordering.

[1:52 PM]  h0p3: I'll be looking for them.
[1:52 PM]  h0p3: Doesn't look like something I want to use often.
[1:57 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I HATE Overstimulation haha
[1:57 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I feel that though. Hopefully those severe ones won’t show through.
[2:03 PM]  h0p3: It depends on the overstimulation for me. If there is too much noise in a room, I start getting shooting pains in my ears, like noise-static-scream something (don't know how to describe it well enough).
[2:04 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I think that works. I get what you mean.
[2:04 PM]  h0p3: I want to push the edge as far as I safely can. Even if this is just a backup device for emergencies.
[2:05 PM]  h0p3: That's one of the reasons I sometimes wear hearing protection in places that don't seem normal to wear them.

[9:51 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Fuck Sertraline. That is all
[9:51 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Hope your day is going well :joy:
[11:18 AM]  h0p3: Haha!
[11:18 AM]  h0p3: Ah shit, I'm sorry, dude.
[11:19 AM]  h0p3: /salute
[11:21 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: F
[11:21 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I realized last night that my genitals were numb. No medicine is worth this. No sir.
[11:26 AM]  h0p3: Lol. Maybe I'm on Sertraline and don't know it. I'm going to blame my penis' malfunction on getting older though.
[11:27 AM]  h0p3: Definitely have a lot to talk about with your doctor
[11:27 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: We are currently having talks and waiting on a response.
[11:28 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: She wants to try another. I told her no lol
