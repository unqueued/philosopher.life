title: 2018.01.19 -- Atropos: Tunnel Types

The Atropos protocol has two kinds of tunnels, layer-1 tunnels and layer-2 virtual tunnels. 

Here's a minimal layer-1 tunnel:

```
node1 --- node2 --- node3

```

It's a physical tunnel.

Here is a minimal layer-2 virtual tunnel:

```
       --- node2 --- 
     /               \
node1                 node4 
     \               /
       --- node3 ---
```

A virtual tunnel uses two or more inmuxed layer-1 physical tunnels.

Layer-1 can be ephemeral and configured however you prefer. Layer-2 enables massive network concurrency, provides privacy generating noise, improves performance through bottlenecks, and allows more complex network topologies to emerge.
