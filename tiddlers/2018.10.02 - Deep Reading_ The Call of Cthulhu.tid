title: 2018.10.02 - Deep Reading: The Call of Cthulhu

I looked forward to this book the most of the series. Started out fine though the genteel, bourgeois junk is annoying. The summon the bastard, and then somehow unsummon it. It was a lot of build up to nothing, and that nothing wasn't terribly logical (given the assumptions). Again, there are likely important political elements I'm not understanding here.
