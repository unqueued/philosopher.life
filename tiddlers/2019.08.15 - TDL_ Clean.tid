title: 2019.08.15 - TDL: Clean

* You still need to do that STEM training. Looks pretty awful. Lol, GL!
* Pasta and salad sound good.
* The living room needs some cleaning
* You aren't exercising enough.
** Why not do some at work? Might be worth teaching your children there as well.
* I'd like to see some philosofrisbee.
* We need that seedbox. 
** Though, we may have a ton of transitions. Perhaps [[m17]] is what you should be doing. Though, I suspect VM work is what you'll do first.
* Call your bro up again. You haven't heard his voice in a while (though you get to chat with him online).
