Have a great day!
MON 9:43 AM
You too, [[K]]. =)
MON 11:52 AM
You have a good D&D session?
MON 11:52 AM
It was fun. How was your weekend?
MON 12:05 PM
Solid. Reading, writing, and gaming mostly.
MON 12:06 PM
How are classes going?
MON 12:17 PM
Pretty good! Got my first translation Wednesday. :eyes:
MON 12:26 PM
Old English to modern
MON 12:26 PM
In class, or do you get to do it out?
MON 12:26 PM
I do it in chunks outside of class then during class we fix issues.
MON 12:27 PM
Oh, I like that.
MON 12:27 PM
By the end we should have a pretty rough/ accurate translation!
MON 12:27 PM
Yeah we don’t even turn it in. He just wants to see that we did it.
MON 12:28 PM
He’s a cool guy.
MON 12:28 PM
Sounds like he makes it pleasant.
MON 12:29 PM
How about your other classes?
MON 12:29 PM
Middle eastern lit is an honest snooze. It’s going to be rough.
MON 12:39 PM
Love CW
MON 12:39 PM
Sci-fi is fun but kinda out there
MON 12:40 PM
She has us read these really intense and dense articles then the lecture doesn’t really align  with it.
MON 12:40 PM
I hold my breathe to set off my automated "emergency, omg we have too much CO2 in our bloodstream" thingamabob off. When death is on the line, I have a chance to unsnooze. May coffee and auto-asphyxiation serve you well. Sorry it's a snooze. =/
MON 12:41 PM
And when it does, I feel like her main points are muddled and uninspiring.
MON 12:41 PM
That is the class I want to sit in so badly.
MON 12:41 PM
It must be odd.
MON 12:41 PM
I wonder what she thinks she's doing in the class.
MON 12:42 PM
Last Wednesday we watched this movie called “Sun Ra” which was a cinematographic mess, but the plot was interesting albeit nonsensical.
MON 12:43 PM
Today we’ll find out why we watched it
MON 12:43 PM
Google brings up images of someone I could only hope to look like some day.
MON 12:44 PM
Hahaha. I love the Egyptian imagery.
