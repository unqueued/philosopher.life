!! Respond to the following gem:

people just want to use their intelligence somehow, and if you don't have a lot of technology and so on, you do other things. Well, in our society, we have things that you might use your intelligence on, like politics, but people really can't get involved in them in a very serious way – so what they do is they put their minds into other things, such as sports. You're trained to be obedient; you don't have an interesting job; there's no work around for you that's creative; in the cultural environment you're a passive observer of usually pretty tawdry stuff; political and social life are out of your range, they're in the hands of the rich folks. So what's left? Well, one thing that's left is sports – so you put a lot of the intelligence and the thought and the self-confidence into that. And I suppose that's also one of the basic functions it serves in the society in general: it occupies the population, and keeps them from trying to get involved with things that really matter.

I'll agree that capitalism alienates us from ourselves, misdirects our attention and focus away from what matters most, and to some non-trivial extent, we each are responsible for allowing this to occur. 

Unfortunately, I am not sure if people want to really use their intelligence. Actually exercising your intelligence is a great deal of work, it's painful, it requires jumping into completely new territory and being lost, it's grueling at times, and if you aren't conditioned to be someone who values exercising their intelligence, it's unlikely you are going to push your brain. It appears that the brain is seeking to be hyper energy-efficient, to build models which eliminate surprise (including risks to narratives we've constructed for ourselves), and to limit how often we are really in the present-at-hand mode in various [[dok]]. I think we are often driven to become mindless, to lie to ourselves, to confabulate, to ignore, to fail to be open, to no longer seek the ideal, and to reuse whatever we know without having to compete in other paradigms (especially if it might invalidate aspects of our identities, hence a sunk cost fallacy).

In my experience, most people aim to drug themselves out of their mind. Insofar as you can't help but seeing the truth, the more desperate you become in your search for effective mind alterations. We flee from the painful truth. Most humans have no interest in conceiving of the world as being much darker than they realized; people are excellent at lying to themselves about it. As always, [[ridtyawtr]]. 

I am, of course, indebted to [[Saint Chomsky]] for pointing out how sports are a waste of our energy, a method of training us to be obedient passive NPCs which can be objectified, commodified, and herded. Sports are an opiate of the masses as well. It occupies us, gives us false hope, and temporary fills a hole which cannot be filled without being involved in a world that actually matters. Escaping the simulations, skinnerboxes, and pointlessness, however, is a tall task even for the most dedicated. The trap works; it catches me all the time. I'd like to think my sports about games which scale with intelligence, but that's stupid because watching them is generally just pleasant and costs me almost nothing (besides massive moral opportunity costs and my personal integrity).
