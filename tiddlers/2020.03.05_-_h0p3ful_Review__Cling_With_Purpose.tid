*[[2020.03.04 - h0p3ful Review: Practice]]
** One thing which stands out to me is how we rely upon the other figuring out the references between our [[Review]]s. It's easier to do in this in our window here, especially since we are comfortable just talking on the fly about it too.
*[[2020/03/04 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: Dad was a Philosopher]]
** It comes in [[dok]]. I do not know how to draw lines wisely enough.
** Permissibility is a crucial problem.
** Why would we think such an obligation to chill exists? Why is chilling, even in the imaginative exercise of there not being a purpose to the activity, with purpose necessary? 
*** This "toward a goal" is our intentionality of [[phenomenology]], though we are not necessarily aware of it, nor are we necessarily accurate in our modeling.
*[[2020/03/04 -- Prompted Introspection: Loveless Creature]]
** It's good to be clingy to some crucial extent. You need people who you can hold and be held by profoundly. That's part of a deep friendship. 
*** It's dangerous to engage in approval-seeking out of mere loneliness, fear, or for reasons which do not generate fairness in what is sometimes a principal-agent problem. 
*** I think you feel cringey about being clingy. I want you to see one can be cringey for not being clingy at all, for not having pursued being a person who wants to have anything to cling onto well enough.
**** Yeah, paraphrased: 'whatever the hell that golden mean thing is.'
**** Skin-hunger, being there with people in the moment, [[intimacy]], feeling comfortable in your own skin with others are all crucial. 
***** It's gotta be extra difficult for you for a bunch of reasons. Not many are going to understand how you think and feel. Most will have very different goals and approaches. I hope you will feel confident because you know, and because you are willing to take risks that you would regret not having taken.
** It's painful to lose friends. It's painful to be wounded by those who we thought were our friends. Friendship is going to include plenty of pain. People often suck, but not all. You have to [[find the others]], and if you can't find them, you at least have to be one worth finding. 
*[[2020/03/04 -- Life Log]]
** Eat fruit (which is your obligation anyway). Make oatmeal. You can do it. =)
*** You can eat moar froot.
** I'm grateful that we have the opportunity to engage in so much realtalk. 
*[[2020/03/04 -- Wiki Log]]
** I don't have much more to say about them. I will try. It's interesting trying to review my work in your wiki, lol. I might not do it eventually. 
*** What do you think is valuable about that process?
** '':P''
*** fine, what is your name, love?
*** naw, im sure he's way more fun and mature in a ton of cases.
**** It's damned good that you have more people to chat with. I hope it grows profoundly for you. 
** That is sometimes all it boils down to: a breaking down of the paragraph. 
*** But, sometimes it allows me to continue a train or thread of thought and then come back to the original point to continue saying more. I think there's a way in which it lends to natural prioritization in some cases. 
*** I often have to lay out the dots for myself by puking them up and then reconnect them afterward: building something [[salient]], not just picking it out tout court.
** You have given the politically correct answer. Plenty to think about there.
** It turns out that thinking about what the majority have to say, in some instances, is what counts as a good source. But, I get your meaning or the direction of it. This is not an easy problem to solve either.
*** Authenticity is a question that rears its ugly head here. I wish I knew how to define it better for you. I don't have a satisfactory definition beyond this libertarian Kantian, Hegelian, and Heideggerian notion (which is not to claim I agree with these men here).
** You will need to tell me how to be wiser too.
*** You'll have to express your expectations and requirements as best you can, wisely, of course. You'll have to think about what kinds of objective obligations fall on both of us here.
**  Hey, what do you mean by: "Bro, she can't hear you"? You should write more about that maybe.
*** Yes, address it to yourself.

*[[2020/03/04 -- To-Do List Log]]
** Loser work. :P
** It's okay if you don't like it too. And, you can burn out long term or not feel up to it for the day. Making it a habit will take doing it even when it's not fun. I appreciate your discipline. It's very expensive. 
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Okay, maybe I'm going to change my mind about that Breakthroughs book. I feel like you've got an inkling of how vast and deep mathematics runs because of it.
** I miss those CS logs. Sick.
** [[2018/03/05 -- Timestop]] is fascinating.
*** Would you like to do this with a Reddit account? You could write one each week. Template it.
**** Notes and drafting here would be great. This would something you could do instead of [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] if you want (though, I dearly love your analysis). Yeah, pour yourself into it. Start tomorrow?
***** Should we collect sources of writing prompts in that style (or whatever styles you prefer)? Make searching the passive, easy part; make writing the hard one for a bit?
**** You don't have to do this. I just see a joy in it, a fun and imaginative exercise. Being a good storyteller is incredibly valuable for so many things, including being ourselves wisely. There's a lot of autonomy in this.
