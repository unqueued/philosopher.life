Perhaps I should consider searching for a fitting quote for my answers to [[Prompted Introspection]]. I don't know if I can effectively do that. I worry this might even defeat part of the purpose. Perhaps this is something I should wait on. Maybe my second time through these questions I could start to respond to other kinds of answers like a roundtable. I think most of my answers are so ridiculously particular to my perspective that I'm not going to have the opportunity to find a fitting quote for the occasion. So, then I suggest I should just add a quote when the situation arises fittingly.
