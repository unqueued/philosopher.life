[1:22 AM]  h0p3: How'd it go tonight?
[1:33 AM]  chameleon: pretty good! third place
[1:33 AM]  chameleon: out of six, but still, best result ever
[1:33 AM]  h0p3: Aye. GJ.
[1:33 AM]  h0p3: You liking alliance or pyromancer more?
[1:35 AM]  chameleon: I got a good use out of alliance, I also started using the kraken too =w=. making tentacles
[1:36 AM]  h0p3: Yeah, serious beats.
[1:37 AM]  chameleon: it's a lewd tentacle pit
[1:37 AM]  h0p3: I think when I would swing at my opponent, I would phrase it: "Get in there, tentacles, mmm, yes!"
[1:39 AM]  chameleon: hehehehe, yush
[1:40 AM]  chameleon: this deck is great. I traded for a promo improbable alliance today
[1:40 AM]  chameleon:

[1:41 AM]  h0p3: Noice.
[1:42 AM]  h0p3: How far did you try to push the "second card each turn" mechanic? This one has such good standalone power to it (assuming you have maybe 8-12 cantrips or 4 more engines elsewhere)
[1:43 AM]  chameleon: well, I have royal scions, kasmina, and various drawing cards (opt, thrill of possibility, chemister's insight…)
[1:43 AM]  chameleon: cavalier of gales, too
[1:43 AM]  h0p3: Yummy
[1:43 AM]  chameleon: the deck can get spooky very quickly
[1:44 AM]  chameleon: not fast enough though, my loss today (why I didn't get first) came to an ultra-agressive mono-red
[1:44 AM]  h0p3: Sligh is sligh.
[1:45 AM]  h0p3: Do you tend to face the same players and decks?
[1:47 AM]  chameleon: I often go up against Robert, who plays milling decks
[1:47 AM]  h0p3: Should troll him hard
[1:47 AM]  chameleon: there's a dude that plays mono-green ｔｈｉｃｃｂｏｉｓ
[1:50 AM]  h0p3: Clear the Mind
[1:52 AM]  chameleon: HAHAHA
[1:52 AM]  chameleon: that's evil =w=.
[1:52 AM]  chameleon: I like it

[2:04 PM]  h0p3: I didn't find any silver bullets for Thiccbois that jumped out at me for SBing, btw.
[2:05 PM]  h0p3: How's your weekend going?
[3:22 PM]  chameleon: Could be better. I've had trouble sleeping
[4:26 PM]  h0p3: :frowning: Sorry. You've been thinking about money and a job lately. I hope that isn't making you anxious enough that sleep is harder for ya. Not a fun cycle.
[4:26 PM]  chameleon: I think it's more husband snoring + not being tired enough
[4:27 PM]  h0p3: Good.
[5:11 PM]  chameleon: I'm usually not kept up by stress, but rather external shit
[5:12 PM]  chameleon: it didn't help that my daki has been a bit flat because I cheaped out on the inner pillow
[5:12 PM]  chameleon: just put a spare one inside, now she's more cuddly
[5:27 PM]  h0p3: You have to be comfortable to sleep. I'm extremely particular about my pillows. Can't sleep without them.
[5:30 PM]  h0p3: I've never had a daki, but I've always wanted one. I'm cheap though. I like to snuggle with body pillows. Important to ease my stomach and have something to hold onto while I sleep. Sometimes it even borders on skin-hunger for me.
[5:31 PM]  chameleon: dakis are great. vitally important for waifuists :wink:
[5:31 PM]  chameleon: I think I've posted my design on my wiki:

[5:31 PM]  chameleon: it's this but without all the random trash
[5:45 PM]  h0p3: Solid
