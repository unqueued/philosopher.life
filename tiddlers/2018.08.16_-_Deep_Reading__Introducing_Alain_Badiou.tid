title: 2018.08.16 - Deep Reading: Introducing Alain Badiou

I'm annoyed by what I take to be an awful foundation here. Badiou helps himself to objective claims that I don't think he has a right to given his constructivist approach.

I agree there is something profound about //The Event// from a phenomenological and even a macrosocial perspective. Those dots have something right about them to me, and I avidly want to connect them. He doesn't get the moral, epistemic, or ontological realism he thinks he does though, imho.

I say this also believing the man is likely a very moral human being in many respects. I hear Heidegger and Marx here strongly in this work. 

To me, he reveals something of what it is like to see the [[diamond]] or [[redpill]], and I admire that quite a bit. There is some work towards fundamental philosophy. Unfortunately, his metanarrative cannot be correct given his assumptions, imho. I realize, my transcendental realism is going to be very unpopular. He's probably already extending himself into unpopular opinion in many respects. I think he didn't go nearly far enough.
