title: 2019.08.23 - Afterschool Teaching: Fun and Easy

I think I panicked Whitney today because she didn't see my backpack, book, or phone sitting there, and she assumed I hadn't shown up. I was trying to get the TV and consoles working, but I believe the TV is broken (and that's probably why it was just sitting outside). It's a no-go. Maybe I can rustle something else up. I think they would adore Guitar Hero. Even the consoles aren't in good shape though. We'll see.

Forgot my whistle, but it didn't matter. 6NP was gone, and my problem children went straight to the gym.

I'm growing used to the chaos in the cafeteria. I had a conversation with every student. Most were just placating me (awfully kind of them). A few students were concerned that 6BG wasn't being careful with my cards. It's true; he's fucking with them, which sucks. Yeah, they are valuable, but also sentimentally important to me. We talked about why I would allow my children to use these things; I will probably be saddened in the end.

So far, my students haven't had much homework to do. Many seem to be smashing through it before our program. Maybe they aren't doing a good enough job? We will see what their grades look like.

Matt took our 5th today. The reading indoctrination continues. Good, good, let the words and stories flow through you. There will be no successful insurrection without literacy. Free yo' minds chillun.

We hit the library. It was outstanding. Probably a dozen students involved in magic with us. Mostly socializing. I'll take it!

Whitney keeps hunting for a way to get 7CM and 8J in trouble. I'm being pulled aside for it often. I don't care if they swear, but they have to be kind. She does not see a difference. Whitney and Delp set up a trap for several students with direct lies. I need good reasons to be deceptive. This was not.

We hit the lab. Wikis for everyone. 5AO received a keychain thumbdrive. May she write like the wind. We learned some basics about the machine, I gave her an MTG card for a bookmark (fits the HP book she's reading; I checked out two for her). 7L appears particularly taken with everything we are doing together. He is quiet, smart, and throws himself into his projects.

5Sm's mom is a gamer. He seems to know more than the usual for his age. I've tried to convince him, 8Gf, 6JR, and 5DB to join us in making wikis.

I've had many students today say nice things to me. It's good they are vocal. They have not understood the hard part of me yet.

Whitney left early for a thing. It went smoothly though.

Delp has changed his mind. He was asking me questions about homeschooling his remaining daughter. We talked for a bit. 

I almost got caught today. 5AO told her mom about receiving a thumbdrive and who gave it to her. Delp didn't seem bothered by it though, so I'm probably okay here. I don't think he would mind, except I've not received and I won't receive permission (and even then he might not mind, except he does care about the paperwork in a different manner).
