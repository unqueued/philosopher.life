title: 2020.02.12 - Prompted Introspection: Accomplishing Things

!! Which is most important to you–being popular, accomplishing things, being organised–and why?

How is accomplishing things not including the others? I suppose one can be popular without having done anything, and so maybe that isn't an accomplishment. Similarly, one might be organized without having lifted a finger. On average, however, I assume that these require actions. Accomplishing things seems the obvious answer. Accomplishing the task of figuring out what is worth accomplishing (beyond the list itself) is my eternal task. ;P
