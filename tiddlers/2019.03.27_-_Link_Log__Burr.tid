*** 10mil, regular fucking people. Wow. I grant the military-industrial-complex, ofc.

*** Yeah, they are, like, the same. Orwellian insanity. But, I am excited. =)

* Think About It

*** Opportunity cost evaluation. I have zero room to talk in this sphere. My {[[Focus]]} is terrible. Practically tailored.
*** This does seem to be a good basic question, like a lucid dreaming check, to ask if I'm depressively lacking motivation entirely. If I can't make a list, then there is something bigger going wrong in my executive functioning.
**** Boredom also has this kind of problem.
*** Interesting comparison to hashing optimization.
**** I think not extremely worrying about collision is gunky hawt.
***** Reminds me of analog and massive parallelization of 17billion neurons. When you can lose the safety of near certainty in the tradeoff, you pickup pure sexiness.
**** Finding [[salience]] in links is harder because it rests upon a notion of [[The Good]]. We have to ask of the links: [[gfwiwcgws]]? To some extent, opportunity cost evaluation has that problem too though.

*** Those goddamn ~~capitalists~~ "commies." This is why we need capitalism and muh libertarian freedom.

*** I grant the limbic aspects of deontic judgment; this is why you must virtuously shape them through cognition! This is the usual dismissal, as though it were mere sentimentalism, and I suggest not for good reasons. =)
