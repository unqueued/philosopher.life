title: 2019.10.07 - TDL: Burn The Books

* Finish burning books. Your technique still doesn't look great.
* The three kids are eating alone without their mother figure, so tortellini it is.
** Cheese ftw.
* Daughter's box has a burning smell, so we may have something serious to worry about. I have melted GPUs before. I'm betting on burning dust.
* Probably should start constructing the site matching site.
