!! I wish I had one more chance to?.. Then I would?..

Ah, I have another chance to answer this question, and hopefully, I will improve upon the previous answer.

I have no idea why I attributed this to Samwise (perhaps I was mistakenly assuming Lady Melisandre could not be annoying): [[2018.02.26 - Prompted Introspection Log: One More Chance]]. It is possible the theoretical conclusion cannot be defeated. It depends on the scope of the chance, including the size of the timeslice. Most of my mistakes don't come down a nicely packaged little moment; they are habits and processes usually. The practical conclusion seems pretty reasonable too. While I'm not contradicting my claim, I should modify it: I am a small force for [[good]] in the world, but yeah, under the right conditions I would be much more useful to the world. 

There are many regrets in my life. Alright, let's try another one: I wish I had one more chance to have been more constructive with my time beyond playing //mere// games. That isn't to say I don't value having played these games at all (far from it), but past some threshold, there were much better uses of my resources.
