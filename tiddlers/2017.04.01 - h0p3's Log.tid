Did the normal stuff today, but also tried to fix the dryer. I took the front off and cleaned it. I think the heating element or something is wrong. I picked up a cheap multimeter, and I'll try to and figure it out. Will probably ask for my brother's help/thoughts. I also visited the in-law family. It went very well. I met k0sh3k's cousin, a 42-year-old programmer Democrat. Interesting guy. He's hopeful. Silly man. Still, obviously intelligent.
