title: 2018.04.24 -- Computer Musings: Nano

Vi is infuriating, and nvim is wildly better but somehow still not right. I'm switching back to just using nano or jed though. Tried jed out again. Unfortunately, it's missing things I need. For heavy duty editing, I might go to it. Edited [[.zshrc]]

Set it for m15 and HTPC as well. Also, I've set weekly YOLO updates on them as well.
