title: 2019.08.16 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Sick Society

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.
<<<

The gist is correct, although it is rhetorically slick. This is one of my problems with psychology and medicine. The goal isn't to feel happy and well in every possible circumstance simpliciter. Justification comes before all else. Without it, you have no meaningful [[telos]]. Even psychopaths have eudaimonic graphs. The quote is most charitably understood as a metaphor, however, because what is wrong with society isn't exactly an illness. I grant the Rand-Locke memeplex is a virus infecting us, but we choose to allow it. Most of the people I see throwing the words "mental health day" have no fucking clue what's actually at stake, and they have no intention of pursuing what matters most. We are obligated to sacrifice our lives because of the evils of our species. 

If you aren't anxious and depressed about the state of the world, you are a bad person.
