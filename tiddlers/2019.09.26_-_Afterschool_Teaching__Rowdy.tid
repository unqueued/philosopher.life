title: 2019.09.26 - Afterschool Teaching: Rowdy

Madame Bacon is in charge. =) Prep was fast. My highschoolers seemed especially down today. They weren't interested in speaking about it with me, understandably. Whitney, however, was talkative. She was surprised that my assumption is that I'm too weird for this place (a testament to my coding skill), but it would be difficult to explain fast enough.

Rowdy today, even in one-on-ones. 6KM is now poking me a lot for attention. 5CM is coming out of her shell; that girl is snappier and bossier more and more. She's getting a computer. 

8L seems to have bonded with me. I joked with her for a second, but then I realized she may have been offended (I had to tell her I was joking, so a testament to my coding incompetence). As usual, I am blind. But, she kept personally connecting throughout the day. She's not feeling well.

My children smashed through their homework and studying. I'm grateful. It might be bullshit, but even being able to smash through (or bypass) the bullshit will be valuable to their actual educations.

Hippy Mr. h0p3 today, doing the peace talks. 

6JR has begun to recognize the privacy costs he has incurred with his questions about swearwords. They are the sort of questions he would get in trouble for having asked at home (for a number of reasons).

I felt pulled in a million directions with the overwhelming sounds around me. My brain hurts. I do not know how the normies do it. Some days, I just can't filter it like they can. 

//Pumped Up Kicks// is an edgy, cool and normal song to play in the lab, right? 

5DB wanted some Stephen King books, but we don't have any. I sent him to libgen.

8HM has spent half an hour just querying Google. That, of course, is against the school rules. They aren't allowed to search the web. DO IT! She was sleepy today. She said she was up late last night on her phone. I know the feeling. 

8N is teasing and trolling 7L hilariously. Am I allowed to ship them? Surely. Cute as hell. Very little robotics work got accomplished.

Their Youtube spirals remind me of a frenetic vine pace. The narratives are pure explosion. I feel old watching them watch. It feels like a random noise. `/smh`, kids these days. =). They live on the recommendations. Heavy socialization for the girls, imho; they spend way more time on the Youtubes at this age thus far. I wonder how much my offspring's radical access will play into giving them shared memetic bridges here. 

I've had several students act as a proxy in a discussion about the value of computers with their parents. My children want me to engage, on their behalf, in providing argumentation, validation, etc. for this topic.

At the end of the day, I feel like I fail to cultivate children who can hold a deep, sprawling, and somehow an even silly conversation for very long. This, of course, is in no small part my failing here. Too many of my students are not interested in talking about what matters, and I'm grateful for those who do. We both speak English, but I can't translate.

6CM asked me if I was tired. We talked about empathy. I am tired.

I've seen multiple students wiping their histories. Noice. That leaves their shitty firewall at the board now (perhaps one day their monitoring will catch up). Dorsey will eventually scapegoat, but I know the violations occur in his classroom as well. Unfortunately, he's elected to live a life which prevents him from knowing what is really at at stake here.

More corporate and local business ad-based sponsorship. These forms make me sad.
