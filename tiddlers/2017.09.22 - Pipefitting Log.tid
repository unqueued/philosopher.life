Admittedly, I avoid many of the inane conversations in the morning in favor of writing, reading, and connecting with my wife. It is unclear to me the extent to which it affects my occupational success and mobility. 

We put up the spool after QC checked it. We cleaned the area out.

Afterward, we set up for cleaning a saddle going way up. 

There is still something wrong with a short piece going over the bridge. They did not care for me trying to measure it.

!! Break!

We installed a valve on top of a Victaulic flange adapter on a tie-in point to the header.

We got everything set for cleaning up that saddle. 

I talked to John quite a bit. I like John (for now).

!! Lunch!

At lunch, Dave said he was going to give me an experience. I needed to get into the pit that was dug to clean, find information, take measurements, and prep. He said he wouldn't ask me to do something he wouldn't have his own son do.

I was the first to go in the pit on the jobsite. The superintendent, David Lobourfuck, thought I didn't even need a ladder. He thought we were being too careful. He doesn't give a shit about me, and if there was an accident, he'd just blame me for not following OSHA standards. 

It was hard work. My back hurts.

I cleaned the numbers off so they could use them. I helped pull measurements. I kept cleaning, even though O was told they'd be hydro blasting it. Uh, so why the fuck am I still cleaning?

I'm betting they don't like me. Lol.

!! Break!

I went back in the pit to pull measurements. Afterward, we cleaned and rolled up.
