title: 2019.09.14 - Prompted Introspection: Moral Motivation

!! What is the quality you like most in a man?

The answer is no different from yesterday. I expect (though do not predict) the same pursuit of what matters most from every autonomous creature. Be morally virtuous. It's so weird to see a split between sexes or genders here (the questions both have plenty of ambiguity); these are morally arbitrary characteristics. Of course, the particularities of one's context will generate different output from the [[CI]], and it's reasonable to think that clusters of similar sets of particularities among various agents will tend to produce rules-of-thumb. The fundamental quality, however, is the same. Be morally virtuous. How do I know someone is morally virtuous? Via their signals, actions, and reverse engineered intents (as one constructs a theory of mind to interpret the motivation of what appears). And, I suggest each individual also requires that empiricism to understand their own motivations all the way down, particularly in those cases in which we hit our limbic system as the last factor. 

It's standard procedure to accuse people of //mere// virtue signaling, unjustified performative behavior (though authenticity isn't as coherent a concept as we'd [[hope]]), and acting for the sake of feeling (or even outright being) superior to others (even if that is limited to variations in our own identities). I anticipate this argument will continue to become more common as our crises grow. Deception, including self-deception, can be found everywhere; it's one key way to fail to do philosophy well enough. These ad hominems are often correct, of course, but it's crucial to understand they are not conceptually correct of all who aim to be morally virtuous. I'm concerned about a sleight of hand here. It's hilarious to claim one can rise above the fray of being moral (which includes epistemic humility); the question of moral anti-realism has already been begged by definition. There is only one motivation that matters: choosing to act [[irwartfrr]], from duty. Beyond that, signaling to [[others]] or yourselves is a secondary effect or by-product; but, it cannot be overdetermined in the sense that there is only one highest priority principle when acting from duty.

What do I like most in an autonomous Daseinic being? Though I can never be certain in any case example (only ever confident), I respect when they do their best to be the most objectively morally superior versions of themselves they can be in any given sequence of choices, which, by definition, just is because it's the right thing to do into [[infinigress]] or even circularity.
