title: 2019.01.23 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Most Wickedester

!! Respond to the following gem:

It's an excellent claim. If you design systems which reward people for being maximally selfish, when you construct perfect competition: you're only going to get [[T4T]] at best. When these become games of [profoundly imperfect information (and irrational), oligopolistic collusion (even from competition among the elite), and absurd double-standard asymmetries which skirt the Rule of Law]: you're going to get worse than [[T4T]]. What do you aim to reward in society? 

Power will continue to centralize if a large enough portion of the population do not collectively punish the outgroup of dark-triads who aren't going to play [[T42T]]. You either build on [[T42T]] or it fails.

If you take psychological egoism to be the deterministic answer to who we are, you can never get anything better than [[T4T]]. That's not why or how we can make robust progress. Most people continue to deny objective meaning enough to reward subjective selfishness, which amounts to supporting a system designed to collapse upon itself. I'm going to keep preaching the Decent Gospel of Decentrality.
