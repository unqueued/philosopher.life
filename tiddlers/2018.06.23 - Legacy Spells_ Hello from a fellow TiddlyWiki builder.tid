Hi,

I found your wiki through a slatestarcodex reddit comment. Thank you for sharing it so openly. I appreciate the straight approach to writing only to the most similar people, or however you put it in the wiki. I can relate to that, even if it does probably alienate the vast majority of even those who'd open such a wiki to take a look around. I don't know if you can ever gather any statistics or feedback on the degree of alienation vs. understanding between all the people who ever open it (probably no way to know). Still, I'm one who took a look and will most likely return to it. I had been thinking of the cryptographic verification thing, and was glad to see that someone had done it with a TiddlyWiki (apparently; I didn't try verifying the wiki linked to in a reddit comment).

I read your hopes/goals for 2022. I wish you well on your path to more secure foundations on the Maslow hierarchy. I am open to continuing emailing (without promising anything) if you'd want to share how you're doing. I don't initially know whether I'd want to stay anonymous or answer with much personal detail. At least I could give more specific feedback if you'd want me to zoom into some aspects of your wiki, as I hope I'd get feedback if I eventually published my work-in-progress TiddlyWiki. I don't know of a culture on Earth where people would get enough useful feedback, and anonymity is of course one useful tool toward that.

In any case, I appreciate the efforts at transparency. My friends think my TiddlyWiki is a good idea, but none have taken on a similar project of integrating their lives. I'm curious what kind of people end up doing so. I'm not even very weird in my opinion, just wanting to connect a lot of dots in a lot of ways to experience bigger and more useful pictures.

Maybe I'll hear from you, maybe I won't!

May you be happy.
