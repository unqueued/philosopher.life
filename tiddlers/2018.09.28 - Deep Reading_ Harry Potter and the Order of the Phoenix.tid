I've been lucky to have vivid history teachers. Also, shout out to Hairy Perry; I loved her.

My autism starts showing more strongly in this book. Several social moves here demonstrate to me my mindblindness and just how hard it is for me to reason about this sort of thing.

Snape is truly flawed. He has it where it counts though, right? It is amazing how it only takes a couple pages for me to hate Umbridge more than Snape though! Rowling is magical in her ability to do this. The opposite of learning! Snape actually gives a shit, even if he's mean as fuck, unfair, etc. Theory and practice, yo.

GO HERMIONE GO! I <3 U! Question authority. Rock on! Find dat telos!

Overt racism "halfbreed" bullshit. Don't take that shit.

Even worse, somehow, the governments injection into education as propaganda, crowd control, etc. I agree that teaching people the truth is a form of crowd control, but this is rhetoric. This is deception, using as mere means, etc.

"Have a biscuit" biatch. Lol. =) Realpolitik training right there. Listening to that speech or Granger. She's just like my 3rd grade teacher. So snappy!
