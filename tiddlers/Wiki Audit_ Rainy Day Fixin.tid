title: Wiki Audit: Rainy Day Fixin

* All the `/emote`'s
* Make code and ASCII art not look like garbage 
* Go back through my [[audit]]s to find all my [[Wiki Audit: Rainy Day Fixin]].
** You lazy sumbitch.
* Orphans
* Missing Links
** Oh, god.
** [[Sphygmus]] points out that [[Alias]]es count as missing links. Perhaps I will need to eliminate aliases from the list.
* Remove images (ASCIIification when I can).
** All-in-one.
* Body-text-to-tag (sane, controllable, etc.)
* Per directory button structures. I want to be able to define the buttons in the top right corner per tiddler, and I want to be able to customize the functions of those buttons.
* Creating links automatically (or make it much easier to do manually) for known words. Retroactively add linking.
* Cleanup/delete drafts
* ~~Tag `!! Respond to the following:` of [[Prompted Introspection]] with [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]~~
** [[Sphygmus]] is a bawss.
* Link All Titles of Books/Videos/etc. that exist in the wiki, otherwise just italicize?
* Check for tiddlers with zero tags
** That should almost never happen
* [[hlexicon]] substitutions (going to require searching)
* Don't forget to firmcode the old [[Log Audit]]s to take into account newly tagged old content that will need to be audited (with footnotes, eh?)
* Matrixrain and/or JYU pattern within [[Root]]'s [[Text Art]].
