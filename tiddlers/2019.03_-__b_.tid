!! Audit:

* My wife is right. I'm just not using this much. I'm glad to have it, but I haven't felt the need for it so much.
* It's a place for passing thoughts or no assent, this houses work I'm just playing with too.
* We will have an accumulation mode now.
* The gunkiness of tagging and more sure-footing I feel, the less I need this for lack of categorization.
* Meh, I don't care about the leak so much now.
