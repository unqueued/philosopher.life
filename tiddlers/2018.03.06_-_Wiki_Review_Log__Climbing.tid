title: 2018.03.06 - Wiki Review Log: Climbing

* [[2018.03.05 - Wiki Audit Log: Link Log Yearly]]
** Not much to say, but I'm glad I did it.
* [[Interview Stories]]
** I need to work on these this week, especially with that interview coming up.
* [[Background Checks]]
** Not sure what else I need to include here.
* [[2018.03.05 - /b/]]
** An, Bliss
* [[2018.03.05 - Computer Musings: Password Manager]]
** Arch:Manjaro::Debian:Ubuntu. Manjaro allows me to leverage the testing of people more interested in bleeding edge than I am. I'm willing to fix something that is broken, but I don't want to constantly be doing it. It works.
* [[2018.03.05 - Employment Log: Don't Fail]]
** I like the list format. I should continue this direction.
* [[2018.03.05 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Room]]
** My daughter commented that I often say very little about things that one might expect I'd have a lot to say about, and vice versa.
* [[2018.03.05 - Carpe Diem Log: Fishsticks]]
** Completed.
* [[2018.03.05 - Wiki Review Log: Brief for Shabbat]]
** Hrm. I don't know why this one is striking to me, but I am trying to capture it, sum it up, respond. Am I just trying to make myself laugh though? Sometimes, I just don't have any analysis. =/
* [[2018.03.05 - Daily To-Do-List Log: A New Beginning]]
** Brief, but doable.
** Hilariously, we didn't make ribs. I've been wrong in my predictions of our plans multiple times as of late. I wish I understood why.
