title: 2018.02.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Turkey

* Woke at 10
** I'm feeling guilty. I need to get this under control
* Checked on kids. 
** Daughter wasn't doing her work. Headache. Sent her to bed.
** Son was doing his work for the most part (caught him playing once)
** Daughter came back down after a while to start her work
* Worked on seedbox. Something isn't right. Was paranoid at first, but I think it's the Tor proxy.
* Read+Write
* Contacted Yates about my Tax documents. I've not received them in the mail. I left a message. I think I'm being given the run around thus far.
** Kept contacting them until someone fixed it for me. I have it now!
* My daughter is feeling better; I think she simply didn't want to do her work. 3 hours have passed, and she has accomplished 45 minutes of actual work.
* We all got serious audits done
* My wife's head is hurting. I gave a rubdown and applied pressure to her head for a bit. I don't think I helped.
* We watched some Penn and Teller, Office
* Did some reading
* Called JRE, AIR
* Keep reaching out to L. She does not respond.
* We had Turkey, Potatoes, Gravy, and Sprouts
** Delicious. We should do it again.
* Drinks, Madmen, Bed at 1.
