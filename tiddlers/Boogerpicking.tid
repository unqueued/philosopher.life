title: Boogerpicking

//You may find this a pretentious joke, but it's snot. Rhinotillexis is the lifechanging sinusital art of relieving yourself of unbearable relief inside your nose.//

Rhinomineralogically pulling your brains out and tingling your spine is [[phenomenologically]] orgasmic yet socially taboo. Of course, like hypocrites, 90% of adults masturbate their noses.<<ref "l">> 

Maniacally amputate the crusty goblins and confiscate your nostrilscabs. Crud-trapping tumors of dried nasal mucus proteins demanding profound skill and attention are, of course, the most [[salient]]. Nosepluggers which require a peculiarly controlled noseblow to build just enough space to perform the necessary insertion-scrape underneath to attain the only viable picks are extremely rewarding boogers; please, enjoy your prize.<<ref "mb">> [[Diamond]]ic boogers are like stalactites which have a warm gooey flagellum trailing after them upon breaking off. Bask in the negative space and easy breathing you generate in this electrifying ancient techne.

In some cultures, the dignified maintain a stylishly long pinky-fingernail for extricating probiscian jewelry with a joyous swish. Exploring your caves for cuttlefish is a much finer art than snot rockets, nasolacrimal-ductal milk excretion, and catching your own loogies.<<ref "m">>

As with all philosophy, one must elegantly strike the [[right]] balance between undermining and overmining our uncountable blessings. We must be careful about nosebleeds, and we should not compulsively mutilate our nostrils.<<ref "t">>

[[YSB]], it is most unfortunate that it could ever possibly be physiologically healthy to eat our own snout-trophies.<<ref "b">> Yummy. Indeed, it is suspicious that Dante missed a circle of hell for nasolingus, but I [[Straussian]]ly suspect he intentionally withheld and protected his own gluttonous and lustful mucophagic cravings for snot stew.<<ref "is">> Empathy sometimes entails that I can taste the boogers you are picking from your own nose. I cannot tell you where to put your goober dragons after picking your winners, but I beg you not tell me where you do.<<ref "p">>
