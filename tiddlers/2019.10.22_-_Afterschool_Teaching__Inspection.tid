title: 2019.10.22 - Afterschool Teaching: Inspection

Prep was instant. Carson and Whitney trying to keep their head above water in school. I was an ear, but not much of a mouth. Matt's sister-in-law (I've fucking forgotten her name, god damnit) joined us. Bio major, edu minor. She is ridiculously quiet, she studies her words, and she is paying very close attention. Openly here to find her foot in the door. 

Surprise inspection today. I went about my one-on-ones while the adults kowtowed; I'm grateful they ran interference for me to do my job (even by accident). I am surprised by the number of students who did not give me lip or pure sarcasm today. It was sane and sweet. Sadly, I am not able to introduce enough critical reasoning into our dialectics: huge language barriers.

8HM is making a parody of Cinderella for fun. We brainstormed. That is a good direction for her. I like the way she draws. 

6AJ got up behind her pulpit and started dropping bombs. She's hilarious.

We defined [[love]] today.

MadameM came with me again today. I completed her sandwiches with the kids. She's a magnet for every child in the room. It was cool for us to just circle up and talk. It was surprisingly civil. I couldn't convince anyone to play games; I feel obligated to ask (had two students from Whitney's class come to us for that). She knows all the teachers (having been their student), and she offers them perspective.

Lots of hungry students today. Sent them to get fruit. Eat away. 

We were all herded into Madame Bacon's room since it was the only open classroom. I adore how many books she has in her class. I walked through the dossiers she keeps on all her students, and mine make up a disproportionate number (despite her previous judgment). 

We talked about various social media sites. Tiktok is the resounding winner with my youngest students. 

I don't know why, but I'm the person who does all the upkeep at the end of the night. I'm fast, and it's labor intensive. It gives me excuses to be out with [[gh057]] or the students too, so I'll take it!
