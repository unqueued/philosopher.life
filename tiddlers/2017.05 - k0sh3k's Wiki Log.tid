!! Audit:

* I'm still trying to convince my wife to start developing the right habits now. 
** At the moment, structuring and spending time peeling her content apart would be useful.
** Writing logs would help her accomplish tasks she cares about. For example, once in a while she will write the first page to a book and then just give up. She just needs  to pour in one drop at a time, day by day. 
* I'm hoping she'll spend one big day to migrate all her pictures over. I think once she has built a library she values one time she'll have an easier time realizing that she can and should spin up other projects on her wiki as well. It's getting over the first hurdle that is the hardest, I think.
* I really enjoy reading what she has written over the week. I feel like I get to know her better, even though I talk to her everyday about the content she is writing. The product is somehow different, and it gives me another perspective on who she is. I'd read her all day if I could. I hope I can do the same with my own children.
