title: 2018.01.09 - Prompted Introspection Log: Reading

!! Tell about an article or book you read recently.

Jesus. I barely have time to tell you about what I see already. [[Link Log]] does that. I suppose I'll stick to a book that has been on my mind since it came out this weekend: 

[[Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House]]

I watched the author on Colbert's show this morning. I can't tell if he is just unprepared to explain the difficulties in extracting the truth from cultures of deception or actually is pulling a fast one. His argument wasn't great, and his body language even worse. He basically claims he's trying to tell us a narrative that will confirm our bias. I think that's an odd thing to say, but perhaps not. I definitely felt that confirmation while reading. Trusting ourselves, of course, is difficult. 

Thus, I am going to Duck Rule this one. It honestly looks about right. Good enough for me.
