title: Blame

//Quick to praise, slow to blame.// 

<<<
It is the act of an ill-instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition; it is the act of one who has begun to be instructed, to lay the blame on himself; and of one whose instruction is completed, neither to blame another, nor himself. 

-- Epictetus, //The Enchiridion//

There's nothing kills a man so soon as having nobody to find fault with but himself.

We habitually erect a barrier called blame that keeps us from communicating genuinely with others, and we fortify it with our concepts of who's right and who's wrong. We do that with the people who are closest to us and we do it with political systems, with all kinds of things that we don't like about our associates or our society. It is a very common, ancient, well-perfected device for trying to feel better. Blame others. Blaming is a way to protect our hearts, to try to protect what is soft and open and tender in ourselves. Rather than own that pain, we scramble to find some comfortable ground.

Blameless people are always the most exasperating.

The blame game was a favorite pastime in my addicted family. Mistakes were immediately followed by emotional exchanges over who was at fault. I often was blamed, and I learned to blame others just as readily. In my adult life, the blame game has become an obsession. Sometimes I blame others and then am consumed with anger and bitterness. Or I take the blame and am swept up in a cycle of guilt and shame. Both responses divert energy from solving the problem and getting on with life.

Shame, blame, disrespect, betrayal, and the withholding of affection damage the roots from which love grows. Love can only survive these injuries if they are acknowledged, healed and rare.

There is luxury in self reproach. When we blame ourselves, we feel no one else has a right to blame us. 

-- Oscar Wilde

* Definitions and Properties
** Blame is the act of censuring, holding responsible, making negative statements about an individual or group that their action or actions are socially or morally irresponsible, the opposite of praise.
** Blame is grounded in the capacity to have a “theory of mind” system of concepts and processes that aid a human social perceiver in inferring mental states from behav-ior. To blame an agent people must know a set of behavior-guiding norms, observe an agent’s norm-violating behavior, and infer a manifold of mental states that underlie the behavior.
** A special kind of moral protest
** Onward and outward responses to a wrongful or bad action, attitude, or character (such responses include: beliefs, desires, expectations, emotions, sanctions, and so on).
** Blame is an attempt to communicate condemnation, disapproval, as well as perhaps a model to the wrong-doer to help him develop a moral understanding of his wrong-doing; to bring him to recognize his guilt and repent what he has done.

** Freewill Denial
** Personal-utility reframing in business self-help.
** Positive Thinking Based Relationship Advice
** Evolutionary Advantage Reductions

* Blame vs Blameworthiness
** To blame someone is at least a psychological act, and often behaviorally an articulated sociopolitical one. The choice to blame itself is one for which we can be blameworthy, including on utilitarian calculations. What constitutes blame?
** Qua social consequences, blameworthiness may obtain without any agents possessing the right to blame (or even arrive at the conclusion) the one who is blameworthy (though, ideal, objective virtuous agents or the [[CI]] as a standard still assigns blameworthiness regardless). When is blame appropriate?
*** Description of blame vs. prescription
*** Blameworthy from an explanatory perspective does not give us prescriptive right or permission to blame. 
**** Forgiveness shows up here!
*** Differences in proportion; X blameworthiness, X-1 social blaming or computation
** Hypocrisy appears to set limits on the ability to blame.
** Complicity and the complexity of causation, dissipation of the feasibility of modeling blameworthiness.

* Asymmetries between Blame and Praise
** Misplaced blame may be more unfair, unpleasant, and costly.
** We might be inclined to praise non-moral-agents, but we refrain from blaming them. 
*** Confusion of [[The Right]] and [[The Beautiful]] in reasoning about [[The Good]].
*** General causation vs. Causation of Moral Agency
** Ineffectiveness of blame differs from praise.

* [[Moral Luck]]
** Justifications of blame without desert appear to only obtain in virtue of epistemic errors that are still objectively justified in virtue of the particulars of the context.
** The essential requirements for deserving blame are the major problem.
** Why would we divide the concepts of responsibility and culpability?

* TPJ and Amygdala activations

* Cognitive vs Affective Theories of Blame...revolves around standard questions of where our agency emits from.
** Attitudinal Content of blaming
*** Blame is located in judgments of ill will
*** Constitutive definitions of blame
** Aretaic standards grading perspective
** Discredit on the ledger of moral standing
** Seems obvious we can blame without much emotional content to the attitude. 
** Justification has to at least be partially cognitive, and I suggest an affective component as well.
