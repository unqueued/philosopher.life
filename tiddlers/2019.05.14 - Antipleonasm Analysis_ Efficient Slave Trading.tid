title: 2019.05.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Efficient Slave Trading

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Ricardo's "science" was founded on the principle that capital is more or less immobile and labor highly mobile. We are enjoined today to worship the consequences of Ricardo's science, despite the fact that the assumptions on which they are based have been reversed: capital is highly mobile, and labor virtually immobile â€“ libertarian conservatives lead the way in rejecting Adam Smith's principle that "free circulation of labor" is a cornerstone of free trade, in keeping with their contempt for markets (except for the weak).

Not all forms of capital are mobile, but I'd argue that the complex financial instruments and institutions which have arisen in capitalism enable high mobility in capital which can be digitally represented. Where is value actually stored? 

Labor mobility is on the rise in many parts of the world but appears to be cooling in the US outside of immigration (and that is despite enormous sacrifices the poor have made to maintain their mobility). 

I can't speak for libertarian conservatives, but I know plenty of libertarians who strongly agree to the free circulation of labor in terms of dissolving national boundaries in favor of explicitly and overtly corporatized political markets. Of course, they mean to say they favor efficient slave-trading.
