title: Estimating Estimations

* If you havenâ€™t seen something occur in N observations, the chances of it happening are less than 3/N.
* Your odds of being able to apply parallel-computing techniques to a problem are inversely proportional to the degree of irreducible semantic nonlocality in your input data.
* The higher the probability, the higher the entropy and the lower the information content.
