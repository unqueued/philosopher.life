title: 2017.08.09 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up very sleepy, but 10 minutes before my alarm. It's stunning magic. I don't know how it works, but my brain has quickly adjusted. 
* Received a letter from ALM. Posted it.
* I worked all day, mostly a work of looking like I'm working. That said, parts of me are sore. So, I didn't waste all my time.
* I talked to JRE. 
* I hugged my family, we went swimming and grilled some hotdogs.
* Pushed Bricks
* Wrote, watched Tosh.0, and going to bed early.
