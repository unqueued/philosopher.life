!! Review:

* We started the month out with a restructuring. This has been good and bad. The lack of journaling has not been good. The lifting of stress on me has been invaluable. My wife has a more direct hand in motivating the children. This allows me to feel like I'm not the only one pushing, and I think it gives me emotional room to maneuver. I still have a heavy hand in shaping their school work.
** Ironically, we said we wouldn't do boot camps. We did at the very end of the month. It seemed to be a mistake. The bootcamp went well, but the break in the schedule may not have been. Both kids had a hard time getting back into the groove.
* My daughter has done quite well with her vocational studies. My son did well, but we've reached a point where it is clear that some fundamentals are missing which prevent him from making progress. We have to wait and work these out first. 
* My children have a difficult time with executive functioning. We are still working on this. It's hard to learn to be wise, to love oneself, and to empathize with one's future self.
** I feel like a real failure here in so many ways. I can't give up though.
* I started having the children keeps log. I hope that this will be an avenue to train them to use their wiki's wisely, consistently, etc. 
* My son has spent more time reading about autism, depression, thought-loops, etc. Knowing is the first bit of the battle. We need to find ways to integrate, apply, and exercise his knowledge. It will be a long road. I'm going to walk it with him. It is our journey together.
