* When in doubt, he is more subtle than plain
* Inspires but never commands
* Returns all favors
* Pleasantly puts others at ease
* Unleashes his ~~rapey~~ rapier wit in defense of others
* A social rank achieved through courteous behavior, refined appearances, and timelessly fashionable memetic breeding
