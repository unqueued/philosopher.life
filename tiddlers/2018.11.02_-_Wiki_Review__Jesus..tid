title: 2018.11.02 - Wiki Review: Jesus.

* [[2018.10 - Wiki Audit]]
** I'm reminded that I need to speak with [[Sphygmus]].
* [[2018.10 - Prompted Introspection]]
** Naw, I'm okay with having so little to say about something which is crystallizing. In fact, that is partially a goal, right?
* [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]
** I need to finish this sucker off and jump into real books.
* [[2018.10 - Link Log]]
** It grows, slowly I add to this monster.
* [[2018.10 - Family Log]]
** We're surviving though. I appreciate that.
* [[2018.10 - Deep Reading]]
** It's okay. You can't be perfect, homie.
* [[2018.10 - Computer Musings]]
** Maybe it's still a router problem?
* [[2018.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]
** Gotta say, I feel like a lot of my attempts at [[FTO]] fail. That's okay, in a sense. I've done my part, though it is still sad.
* [[wiki-live-git.sh]]
** Thank you, [[j3d1h]]. We cleaned this up, and it's been useful.
* [[2018.11.01 - World of Warcraft: Hrmm]]
** Waiting for what we're doing on the kids' computers. I want to join them, but I also want to bot.
* [[2018.11.01 - Self-Dialectic: /b/ Contra]]
** I am glad that I give myself license to be messy, to not have the answer immediately, and to see myself as improving upon this process.
* [[2018.10 - /b/]]
** I'm slowly climbing through this maze.
* [[2018.11.01 - Guitar: Canon in D in C]]
** We're doing it! I'm glad.
* [[wikiaudit.py]]
** I <3 i3
* [[2018.10 - TDL]]
** That said, I feel like I'm not getting much out of this always. But, maybe I'm looking at it wrong? Sometimes it does help, and maybe it's the breaking of the flatness that is what it is supposed to do.
* [[Monthly Auditable]]
** This was useful. I'm glad to have the one-stop shop!
* [[2018.11.01 - Prompted Introspection: Blind Ocean Description]]
** I'm glad I care about what I think.
* [[2018.11.01 - Wiki Audit: Auto]]
** It was interesting to see the chain of tiddlers created regarding the [[/b/]] and {[[About]]} issue.
* [[2018.11.01 - Music Exploration: Experiment]]
** I'm glad. I've found a couple songs I really like too.
* [[2018.11.01 - Wiki Review: Talkative Halloween]]
** This is ballooning so fast.
* [[2018.11.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Audit]]
** Completed.
* [[2018.11.02 - TDL: Apply]]
** I am hungry for the tacos right now.
* [[2018.11.01 - TDL: Monthly Audit]]
** I did not apply. Monthly audit took a lot of my time, but I must admit: I was not nearly as productive as I'd have hoped.
* [[2018.09.17 - ALM: Advice]]
** This is separatory cleanup.
