title: 2006.12.21 -- The Form of Gaming

The Form of Gaming: A Philosophical and Ludological Discussion on Games

 

We all play games, or we all play what we think are games. Why? It is simply a part of human nature to challenge oneâ€™s self, to accomplish, and to win. Games provide a safe and proper environment to test ourselves. In my opinion, the beauty of the game is that it can reflect any other problem we may face in life, with the exception that a game can be adjusted to be more fair (unlike life), we can view justice as a 3rd party looking more objectively at what is really occurring, and that problems, quizzes and tests within games donâ€™t have severe impact on the quality of our lives (or, at least, they shouldnâ€™t). Games are really microcosms of what we experience in life, and yet wonderfully opposite of life in that games have no real consequences when played either well or poorly. We play them in virtue of themselves, and they have proven to be both enjoyable and insightful.

 

In this article, I hope to present a case for what makes a game a game, why we play them, and the intricate principles universally found in a true game. The explanation is both descriptive and proscriptive as it will portray the meaning of gaming and also depict the sort of thinking required to adjust current activities and future ones, activities which we blindly call â€˜gamesâ€™, to better conform to the true idea of gaming.

When we ask, What is gaming? or what are games? or even, what is the perfect game? we are really asking, what is the form of gaming?

 

And, what is the form of gaming? To start, you really need to know what a form is in the first place. Formally :-), the definition of a form is:

 

That assemblage or disposition of qualities which makes a conception, or that internal constitution which makes an existing thing to be what it is --called essential or substantial form, and contradistinguished from matter; hence, active or formative nature; law of being or activity.

 

Philosophically speaking, the word form has been used to translate the Platonic idea (eidos), the permanent reality which makes a thing what it is, in contrast with the thing's particulars, which are finite and subject to change. However, for practical purposes, Aristotle was the first to distinguish between matter (hyle) and form (morphe). The perfection of the form of a thing is its entelechy in virtue of which it attains its fullest realization of function. For example, to Aristotle, the entelechy of the body is the soul. The origin of the differentiation process is to be sought in a prime mover, i.e. pure form entirely separate from all matter, eternal, unchangeable, operating not by its own activity but by the impulse which its own absolute existence excites in matter.

 

Forms are abstract ideas, perfect images (logos), from which actual particular things endeavor to mimic and imitate. Some philosophers, like Aristotle, thought these forms were real things themselves, maybe objects hidden in some heavenly body of the universe, who knows? But, for our purposes, we can use the basic understanding of form, which is hardly controversial. Our consideration of this topic is a less metaphysical approach, and far more semantic and logical. We are searching for the necessary features that are found in all of the possible particulars of a subject. The perfect image, idea, and configuration of a thing are what we seek.

 

An example of form in practice could be the form of scissors. When we refer to scissors, we are first referring to scissorness. We are reducing all scissors to the very concept and logos of scissor, from which all other scissors mimic in model, function, and construct. Scissors can be different colors, shapes, and sizes; they can cut different cuts, and some donâ€™t even cut very well at all! Scissors vary in material used to make them, and the material they are designed to cut. Some scissors are good, others bad. But all these properties are arbitrary characteristics of each particular scissor. We seek that which is not arbitrary about all scissors, but rather that which is completely necessary about all scissors. The question of what is the form of scissor? is a question concerning the ultimate substantial and universally held concept that binds all scissors. When seeking the form of scissor you seek whatever makes a scissor a scissor. By referring to scissors, in general, speaking of its form, we are speaking about an edge tool having two crossed pivoting blades. All scissors follow that form. The form of scissors is definitional of the all scissors in the relevant and basest sense. Of course, in the end, particular scissors can be more or less scissor-like than other particular scissors, but none of them perfectly mimic and match the very form of scissor. The perfect scissor is the form of scissor.

Just as scissors are defined by its form, games are defined by their form. We donâ€™t seek the particular game, we seek the perfect game, the form of game.

 

So, what is essential to gaming? What is this form of gaming?

A game is a contest or competition, physical and/or mental, according to certain rules, which is perceived to have irrelevant outcomes beyond the fact you win, lose, or tie, such that: the gamer would play the game simply in virtue of the opportunity of playing the game itself. Perfect games test the skill of the player and nothing else. The game can be against yourself or others (environments are rulesets, not opponents). But, in the end, gaming is a test of oneâ€™s skill that should have no real consequence beyond winning, losing, or tying.

 

Any other effect from or influence upon this rule and skill based competition is simply a non-game event, concept, or object. All other non-competitive aspects of gaming, that arenâ€™t specifically and solely testing the playerâ€™s skill, against a certain set of rules and/or opponent(s), for the purpose of playing for the sake of winning, simply IS NOT gaming. The screaming fans, the music, the social life, the graphics, fame and money earned from playing, and even the narrative--these are not a part of the game in any substantial and relevant sense; these are mere particulars of a game. While these arbitrary properties can be found surrounding the center of the true game itself, they do not qualify as game.

 

Analogously, scissors are used to cut in a certain fashion (with two crossed pivoting blades), just as games are used to test the skill of a player. Cuts by a scissor are used for any number of purposes: shortening a piece of paper, removing tags, etc, just as the testing of a playerâ€™s skill through gaming can be used for the purposes of amusement, recreation, etc. Do not confuse the secondary purposes of a form with the true and actual form-making purpose. The meaning of scissors does not include arbitrary particulars or secondary functions, and the meaning of game does not include arbitrary particulars or secondary functions. Thus, the form of scissors only includes the function of being used to in a certain fashion (with two crossed pivoting blades), just as games are used to test the skill of a player.

 

It may seem I used a synonym, contest, to define gaming, which at face value seems problematic. I assure you though, it was quite intentional and very relevant, as the purpose of this particular definition was to limit the meaning, specifically in terms of gaming as a competitive concept, as opposed to the other reasons why people game, which are completely different from the very nature and form of gaming.

 

What principles of gaming are absolutely necessary to its form?

1.)    Fairness

2.)    Rules

3.)    Test

4.)    Played for the sake of playing (win, lose, or draw as the sole consequences considered)

 

1.) Fairness is conformity with the rules or laws, without fraud or cheating, and the simple justice that one reaps what one sows. In the context of a game, fairness is a social contract by which the player(s) understand and agree upon set rules that are followed and enforced with honesty and impartiality, that a player is fully responsible for the outcome of his choice, and that the causal relations are strictly based on player skill linked to an appropriate and definite outcome.

Applied to gaming, actual fairness will usually mean players have equal opportunity to accomplish goals, and that they reap what they sow in every possible aspect (to be dissected). In the form of game there should be equivalent risk vs. reward ratios and equal, proportionally scaling reward and result with player skill. In true fairness, only the skill of a player is taken into account. How much money he has, the color of his skin, how many friends he has, the time he has to expend playing, or his graphics card, has nothing to do with fairness. These should not be taken into account, or have any effect on the outcome in a perfectly fair game.

 

To further flesh out the meaning of reap what you sow, we must maintain that action A always results in action B. At any point that the causal relations, in parallel circumstances, would produce different results from the same cause, you have a violation of basic fairness and just gaming (not only that, but youâ€™ve probably witnessed the destruction of all meaning and significance in a world by eliminating causality and responsibility altogether). Cause A must produce effect B for you to be effectively reaping what you sow. This type of causal thinking is really the basis for reaping what you sow. But, this principle goes further. It is the idea that one gets what one deserves for an action. So, result B must be appropriately caused by A. We can often hold basic causal relations so that A results in B, but the question is whether B is an appropriate effect of A. The appropriate effect of a cause must be very, very carefully weighed, and it is without question the most difficult aspect of the perfect game (the form of game). An example way to check the appropriateness of an effect is to compare its proportions to another causal chain. Consider A to B vs C to D. Does A cause a proportionally similar result in B as C does to D?

 

These are questions of desert and justice. Judging fairness becomes quite complicated. It must be remembered though, in gaming, effort and skill should be the measure by which we determine results, and nothing else.

Is perfect fairness possible?

 

Some games do a better job than others in creating a setting of fairness. Chess would be a good example of pretty fair and balanced game. In chess you find that both players have nearly equal opportunities, and deserved and deducible consequences of actions. Other games might not reach this fairness aspiration as easily. But, that doesnâ€™t mean we shouldnâ€™t strive to create as fair as possible games as we can. When designing and evaluating the foundation of a game itself, we should seek fairness as the prime principle guiding the game. Everything rests upon this principle being upheld. And, it certainly means, we should seek to play fairly.

 

To be noted: While certain games have handicaps, such that it isnâ€™t initially fair at face value, as long as both players, including the handicapped, understand what is occurring, and why, then fairness can still exist.

There is yet another problem for understanding fairness. While relativism is a ridiculous concept, a very controlled version of it poses an applicable question. Remember that we are not thinking of fairness as if it were in the eye of the beholder. Our concern is rather how fairness as a universal principle will judge each case or match within a particular game. Are there situations in which fairness requires more than just a flat, simple and fair rule structure and the abiding of these rules? Must these rules take into account players themselves? Must these rules be specific to an exact instance of a particular game in helping to determine the outcome of who deserved what? It is quite likely that rules of a perfect game would be infinite in nature, here is why:

 

From a simple starting perspective, we want to say, Let the best man win. And, yes, this might be as close to fairness as we come in practical reality. But, this does not really address an innate flaw in particular games we play, as they do not take into account the possibility that one person won the game not in virtue of skill and effort, but because they were innately better at the game. What if I played a game of basketball against the prodigy Michael Jordan? Clearly, he deserves to beat me in many ways. He is simply the better basketball player. But, the measure is somewhat skewed, as Michael Jordan may have innate abilities that make him inherently better and more suited to the game of basketball than me. If and when I have the pleasure and opportunity to go 1 on 1 with Michael Jordan, and he would surely destroy me, could he rightly pull me, bloody and beaten, off the ground after a match and tell me he truly deserved to win, as if he was completely responsible for all the events in the game? Sure, he plays with skill, but it is more than that, as he probably has height, weight, speed, stamina, dexterity, and maybe even mental advantages. It is possible he was born with inherent advantages that could overcome any amount of my own basketball playing properties. MJ canâ€™t be responsible for his inherent advantages, only self-created advantages. Is it in fairness that we judge win conditions solely on the strict performance with no regard for who was performing?

 

To further illustrate this point, more in the extreme direction: What if Stephen Hawking played a game of basketball with Michael Jordan? MJ would obviously win by the standards of basketball we see. But, would MJ win because he deserved to win? I suppose the wheel chair limits Mr. Hawking to an extent that he cannot really play effectively at all, and this isnâ€™t even his fault. There is a skill and reward barrier that Stevo will never breach, for example: he canâ€™t slam dunk the ball. Is this his fault? Is Stephen Hawking responsible for his inability to play basketball perfectly?â€¦no. What is playing basketball perfectly for someone in Stephenâ€™s shoes? Maybe to some extent he is responsible for his performance on the court. Insofar as he can move his wheelchair from one side of the court to the other, in beautiful and wonderfully timed zigzag motions, designed to overcome his virtuoso opponent, and when he rolls over MJâ€™s foot with his prepared spiked wheel chair tires as a means of disabling his opponent (Stevo is very smart you see), then yes Stephen Hawking is playing basketball. But, insofar as he is innately incapable of doing certain actions in basketball, Stephen Hawking is not gaming. Stephen Hawking is only gaming when his own skill from his own will, as opposed to something like his genetics, is the sole factor in an outcome.

Might it be the case that when we look at particular matchups in particular games that the rules must take into account the actual players themselves? If Stevo tried his darnedest, and played the best he could actually have played given his situation, and MJ missed 39 out of 40 shots, and clearly didnâ€™t perform the best he could have performed given his innate abilities, then would we not say that Stevo played the best given each players circumstances? Did not Stephen Hawking deserve to win in this instance?

 

To really judge Stevoâ€™s win and loss conditions, we might be required to ask: what resources did he have to work with in the first place, and what did he do with those innate resources? If he was given very limited resources, how would Stevoâ€™s performance matchup with someone else in his exact same circumstances?

Playing a million games, for Steven to get a single hoop might be monumental in comparison to Michael Jordan sinking 1,000 straight shots. Even if a player loses, they may have lost by less than most would have lost in their position. Isnâ€™t this the sort of thing what we should be judging?

 

By applying this type of thinking, we would therefore want to match equal players against each other or we would want a mechanism by which to judge the performance of each individual in each particular set of circumstances. As for the first, particular games like boxing, wrestling, and ultimate fighting already try to do this. They setup matches in a certain weight classes. They at least TRY to eliminate innate inequalities, whether by selection of naturally equal opponent or by means of handicap. Can every particular game do this? Maybe not. But, that doesnâ€™t mean we shouldnâ€™t at least do our best to make this the case in our practice of gaming and game development. It is evident that pitting pre-formed groups of practiced professionals against a put together group of preschoolers isnâ€™t fairness. The other option, of course, is a creation of a mechanism that would weigh the effort and skill put forth by each player to determine who played the best given their individual circumstances. This is the perfect solution, one built into the very rules of the game themselves. But, it is very impractical, and maybe impossible for non-omniscient beings. However, we can certainly appreciate the principle. When we evaluate or design games, games which are really attempting to mimic and imitate the form of gaming, we must do our best to create fair player bases and fair matchups, or apply rules that scale with the player base to best determine their individual performance and what appropriate consequence is due to each player.

 

Scaling win conditions based on the players themselves would of course be quite theoretical and nearly impossible for us to generate, but it might be a necessary part of the perfect form of game. Scaling the win conditions to take into account the players themselves would allow for people to reap what they sow, and that is certainly the relevant issue at hand. After all, Gaming isn't about what you have, it is about what you can do with what you've been given.

 

In conclusion, fairness is NOT relative to any one individual or communities opinion. It is actually a form itself. The application and understanding of fairness, and attempting to conform rules and tests we make, games or otherwise, still fall short of the very high standards of fairness. While it may not be practical to create games that are perfectly fair, we should at least aim for this principle. Reachable, maybe not, but that shouldnâ€™t stop of us from constantly evaluating and adjusting games to conform to the principle of fairness. We must recognize that most games we create and play are flawed, and we should be quick to distinguish when a person reaps what they sow and when they donâ€™t. Does this mean that we donâ€™t have any real winners or losers in our so-call â€˜games?â€™ No. It means that we need to be particularly observant and careful in our judgment as to why and what consequences occurred, reserving judgment to discern whether players reaped what they sow, and then we can adjust our perceptions as to who really won, lost, or tied in a game. Remember: You are only responsible for what you could possibly have been responsible for. Consequences should be based upon what you are responsible for.

 

2.) Rules are essential to games as well. Rules serve as the framework of fairness, as well as existing for the sake of the very game mechanics themselves. These are agreed upon, and understood to exist. Some rules, especially concerning fairness directly, must be understood by all participants, while some rules, especially metagamed, can be hidden. However, all rules must be understandable. It must be possible to logically arrive at all of the rules, whether through empirical and experiential evidence, math, or deductive reasoning. Rules are really a subset of Fairness, but as I wished to highlight the very principles of fairness, I have distinguished rules as another topic to consider; we should be aware that all rules should be under the watchful eye of fairness.

 

While there is a general rule of fairness that permeates throughout all other rules, in general, by rule in a game, we are referring to a game mechanic. Game mechanics, of course, must be fair, but they have more to do with directly laying the framework for the actual Test in a game than anything else.

 

Game Mechanics seem pretty straightforward. In physical games this includes boundaries and procedures, and also the consequences of violation. In video games this includes those virtual boundaries and procedures, and so on and so forth. Game mechanics will include things like gravity, and other physical or virtual forces that act upon the player or influence activity within the game itself. Game mechanics form the environment, and range in simplicity and complexity. To be noted: even seemingly simple base game mechanics can deceptively still be the foundation of a game of great depth and difficulty.

By base rules or base game mechanics I mean the original and spoken rules of the game that must be initially understood to even begin play. To give an example, letâ€™s consider the mighty, mighty game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

 

In Tic-Tac-Toe, the base rules/mechanics would be something like this:

 

1.)    A 2-dimensional 3x3 playing grid, generally composed of 2 parallel lines perpendicularly aligned upon an identical pair of lines.

2.)    Both players fairly decide on who goes first amongst themselves.

3.)    There must be exactly 2 players, one player is O, the other player is X.

4.)    Players will interact with the playing grid using only their respective letters when marking.

5.)    The player who goes first is the first player to mark a playing field with his corresponding letter.

6.)    Marks must be within one of the 9 given blank fields found on the paper playing grid.

7.)    Once a field is marked, it cannot be marked again by either of the players.

8.)    After one player marks, the other will be given a chance to mark, and they rotate in turns laying marks on the grid until a player wins or all 9 fields have been marked.

9.)    A player wins when they place three of their own marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

10.)            If no player wins, and all 9 fields have been marked, then the game is a tie (called a cat in this game).

Other possible rules to consider, often socially based:

11.)            A player generally has a short amount of time to make a decision, and cannot stall the game any longer than is required to make a decision, which shouldnâ€™t take more than a few seconds.

12.)            Rule accountability is managed by both players.

13.)            A violation of the rules may result in a game loss if the opposing player so chooses.

14.)            Usually, multiple games of Tic-Tac-Toe, with both players having gone first an equal number of times are required for the best player, with the highest average of wins to be named the overall winner.

These are the game mechanics of Tic-Tac-Toe. Prima facie, Tic-Tac-Toeâ€™s rules generally follow rules of fairness. All of these rules are knowable by all players. Players decently seem to reap what they sow in this game, and there are clear objectives and rewards, even if skill doesnâ€™t amount to too much (it is a kidâ€™s game after all).

 

When evaluating the base mechanics, weâ€™ll find that tic-tac-toe is a very simple game. Some games arenâ€™t as simple though. Youâ€™ll notice that Chess would have a much larger ruleset, and we may even be able to produce games with infinite rulesets.

We are still missing a key element in understanding the rules of a game. There is another level we must take this to in order to really hit the heart of what game mechanics really mean in a substantial sense, especially with respect to the concept of fairness, and applications of reaping what you sow in virtue of your skill alone. We cannot simply look at base rulesets to determine fairness; we must calculate the meaning of the base mechanics to fully understand the consequences and possible future action trees available to all player(s). This calculation, which gives deducible and relevant insight into the hidden mechanics that can and must be inferred from the base mechanics, results in metagame rulesets.

What do I mean by metagame? Literally, it is the game after (outside) the game. In reality, it is the strategy of a game.

Game mechanics, after evaluation, become far more extensive than one would originally realize. We should be able to deduce from the base rules an even further set of rules, the rules of the player and strategist, that which we might call the metagame.

 

Metagame, essentially, is the addition of further rulesets formed from assumptions of strategic play using our initial base rulesets, traditionally based on the anticipation of an opponentâ€™s strategy or, and more importantly and inclusively, the expected results of a playerâ€™s own possible choices that limit and distinguish the better courses of action available to a player. Metagame is the development or a narrowing down of choices concerning future action trees that increase a playerâ€™s probability of winning. Metagaming, the verb, occurs when a player takes advantage of the metagame for purposes of winning more often (we might simply call metagaming just strategic play). By means of the estimation of how other players will make decisions, and knowledge of how the rulesets working together to create further deducible rulesets, the metagamer can build his strategy designed specifically against his opponentâ€™s strategy or simply to improve upon a previous strategy of his own.

Metagame stems from base game mechanics and strategies that will evolve from those base rulesets. Thus, fair metagames are based on fair base rulesets.

 

Metagame rulesets deduced from the expected results of a playerâ€™s own possible choices are quite calculable. This sort of knowledge is usually acquired through experience, and is often intuitive, but remains quite calculable. We would call this sort of thinking strategy in general. A strategy is a preformed set of rules that are artificially applied to an original set of rules. What must be understood is that all possible strategies can be calculated in a game, even if they are infinite in number and size, and that through some natural selection and deduction, players â€˜weed-outâ€™ poor strategies in favor of strong strategies. Available strong strategies form further rules, thus forming more complex rulesets. Thus, new rules can be deducted from the base rules. And, it is possible that a metagame will be built upon the first metagame; which can continue ad infinitum, but nevertheless it remains a backbone of understanding rules and fairness in the context of gaming.

 

Tic-Tac-Toe, which is very subject to combinatorial game theory and computation, is a perfect candidate for exploring the meaning of metagame. We can see the results of all possible play combinations, which is quite limited for a game (only 255,168 combinations with wins and not excluding symmetrical positions), and thus we are in a very good position to express a further set of rules that one must play by in order to win. So, in the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, what is the metagame that will result from the base mechanics? And, how do we arrive at the metagame?

 

To arrive at the true and complete metagame, we must evaluate all combinations of play. We must dissect all possible future actions trees. We must calculate the win/lose/draw probabilities of any choice in every circumstance. Generally, gamers do this intuitively and experientially; but rarely fully. Again I emphasize that the metagame remains quite calculable.

 

Tic-Tac-Toe has very few choices available, so evaluation is mathematically much simpler. Looking at all possible

combinations of play, in order to win or avoid losing in tic-tac-toe requires that the player consistently perform as many of the following actions as possible with each mark â€” listed in order of priority â€” without sacrificing the higher priorities:

 

Complete three in a row.

 

Block their opponent from completing three in a row.

 

Threaten a win with two possible completions in two rows.

 

Avoid a configuration in which the opponent can force the win.

 

Threaten a win with a possible completion (two in a row).

 

Prevent the opponent from getting two in a row.

 

The player must also think ahead to see whether a mark can be made this turn that will allow him or her to achieve a higher priority in the next turn.

 

In reality, the game is won or drawn after the first two marks are made, assuming perfect play for the remainder of the game. It is therefore very important for the serious tic-tac-toe player to study these openings (of which there are 12) in order to avoid making a mark that enables the opponent to force a win, or to recognize marks that can be capitalized upon in order to force the win.

 

The first player, whom we shall designate &quot;X,&quot; has 3 possible positions to mark during the first turn. Superficially, it might seem that there are 9 possible positions, corresponding to the 9 squares in the grid. However, by rotating the board, we will find that in the first turn, every corner mark is strategically equivalent to every other corner mark. The same is true of every edge mark. For strategy purposes, there are therefore only three possible first marks: corner, edge, or center. Player X can win or force a draw from any of these starting marks. The choice of which to make will depend on the player's knowledge of their opponent's weaknesses in recognizing good answers to a particular opening. In a series of games, alternating the opening mark and its superficial position can help a player win more often against a weaker player.

The second player, whom we shall designate &quot;O,&quot; must respond to X's opening mark in such a way as to avoid the forced win. Player O must always respond to a corner opening with a center mark, and to a center opening with a corner mark. An edge opening must be answered either with a center mark, a corner mark next to the X, or an edge mark opposite the X. Any other responses will allow X to force the win. Once the opening is completed, O's task is to follow the above list of priorities in order to force the draw, or else to gain a win if X makes a weak play.

 

Players soon discover that best play leads to a draw, regardless of where the first player plays.

 

As you can see, the base rules transform into a further, deducible set of rules and strategy that players should follow if they wish to win. All games have this feature. But, there are further metagame considerations. In noting how this game is played, and even the people that do play it, we will often find that there is a problem in reaping what you sow.

In Tic-Tac-Toe, the problem is that players can place marks without real thought or strategy behind it or they can even randomly place their marks and often receive the same benefits and consequences as someone who really put thought into it. Clearly, we have difficult judging who deserved to win and who didnâ€™t. Truly skilled Tic-Tac-Toe players arenâ€™t always receiving proper reward for their skill. We would call this a problem of a skill-cap, in which skill only means so much. There is a limit to which skill is displayed and rewarded in this game (if only in the perspective of single matches). This isnâ€™t fair to a truly skilled gamer. Tic-Tac-Toe ceases to be a skill-based event in some instances, and, insofar as it isnâ€™t based on skill, it isnâ€™t a game. This skillcap is a problem that stems from the very base ruleset, and becomes evident in Tic-Tac-Toeâ€™s metagame.

 

We must recognize that even Tic-Tac-Toe is still not in perfect conformity with the form of a game. And, if Tic-Tac-Toe is clearly not full-proof balanced and fair, then what games of ours are? We may need to add components like no skill-caps, proportional returns at different skill levels, and other complexities just to ensure that every player receives the appropriate consequences of their actions. Again, we see that ugly unfairness raise its head, even in a game as simple as Tic-Tac-Toe.

 

But, it gets even more complicated.

 

Metagame rulesets based on the anticipation of anotherâ€™s action is also a form of expected results calculation. For most, this is the traditional meaning of metagaming, but it is really contained within the first definition. This is the hardest portion of the metagame, and the least understood. The trick to this aspect of metagame is that anticipation of anotherâ€™s action isnâ€™t as clearly and easily defined and calculable, giving the metagamer a more difficult foundation upon which he can deduce the best course of action. Often this metagaming is based upon using your mental skill and intuition to deduce or guess the most likely course of action your opponent will choose, and the best option you should choose in response. However, we want sure deductions, and this makes our life much harder. How can you be sure what another player will do?

As free will exists (another paper for you altogether), we must assume that an opponent could possibly choose anything from a myriad of options and strategies. In fact, if they are truly free with respect to a choice, then we canâ€™t (without some omniscient foreknowledge) fully deduce or even empirically know what choice a person will make with certainty. If this is the case, then it is possible that a strategy that initially seemed most probable to give the best results will not actually be result in the best possible rewards in some circumstances, in virtue of the possibility that your opponent can choose something else altogether.

 

However, at the very least, we can say that an individual (or even group of beings) with free will is more likely to make a particular choice as opposed to others. There is no explicit contradiction in thinking people are inclined towards certain beliefs or methods of thought and action while remaining completely free with respect to those beliefs or methods of thought and action (or, at least I will assume so for the time being). Insofar as we can calculate those probabilities, we are able to make, at least in metaphysical possibility, deductions that form a valid part of a game.

 

We might consider, although Iâ€™m not necessarily advocating it, that an opponent with free will isnâ€™t actually a part of the rules themselves at all. If we wished go down this path, at first glance, we might be denying the causal deducibility of certain games with free opponents. On the other hand, all other factors would remain quite deducible. If my opponent chooses X, then Y occurs. If I choose A, then B occurs. But, it can get more complicated. What if: if my opponent chooses X and I choose A, then B; and, if my opponent chooses Y and I choose A, then C; ad nauseum? Does this still follow the basic laws of causality? We may need to say that, with respect to free beings acting upon a deterministic gameâ€¦.yes.

Of course, this sort of metagame ruleset only applies to games in which you face opponents with free will. The anticipation of computer-based choices would fall under my first explanation of metagaming. We can see that in a free will based calculation we have a lot of work to do.

 

Moving on:

 

Generally, in good and balanced games, metagames will evolve continuously, which is especially true for games with free opponents. There should always be a counter for an action; and a counter for that counter, and a counter for the counterâ€™s counter, and so on and so forth. This creates incentive to innovate, to anticipate, and can fully extend the viability and necessity of mental skill in a game.

 

An underlying point to understand, especially concerning evolving metagames, is that the choices available have always remained the same. You still always had the future action trees available; you just may not have used them. A good example of this would be an unskilled player who technically HAS the capacity to follow a certain action tree, but never will, maybe because they arenâ€™t skilled enough to execute or even realize which future actions in the tree are the best to use in the circumstances.

 

Again, in the truly perfect, possibly unending metagame, this sort of thinking is based on calculable results which would result in perfectly equal and countering strategies, such that strat A is countered by strat B, which is countered by strat C, and so on and so forth, such that there is no truly best option, at any given skill level, only a best for the moment or circumstance, possibly relative to your opponentâ€™s position and choices. Certainly this means that there will be strategies that are suboptimal, even in a perfect game, but that there isnâ€™t necessarily a universally correct strategy to use. We mean to say, that certain strategies will never be viable in the truly perfect game, but that in true balance, there must be strategies that are equal, countering, and significant enough to use instead of another, else, everyone would always choose the exact same strategy (which isnâ€™t much of a challenge in the end). Generally, in most games we create, there are clear archetypes and strategies that prevalent and accepted, and are in fact the deducibly best option to always use. This form of a stagnant metagame, heavily reliant upon archetype and class based strategies is due to a flaw in the base ruleset of a game.

 

What about rulesets which are not easy to calculate, or even truly incalculable, like the weather or randomness?

By definition, game mechanics do NOT include non-competitive functions or influences upon the game. Things like socialization, sportsmanship, random functions, or even the weather are not part of gaming. These particulars of a game are arbitrary, and do not fairly test a players skill in any way.

 

Probably the most interesting feature found in our games that people believe is a true game mechanic, and the hardest to define for people, is randomness. Randomness appears to be a mechanic of the game, but it isnâ€™t a fair one. And, yes, we must accept that it exists in some so-called games. And, yes, it takes skill to work around it, but insofar as something is truly random, the causality of a particular circumstance is, at least to some extent, eliminated; therefore, you are not fully responsible for the result of an action; you are not playing a fair competition; thus, you are not gaming with respect to randomness.

 

Randomess is an innately flawed concept for gaming. Whether you believe it is even possible to exist or not, in so far as a player is not responsible for the consequences of his action, he can not be held responsible for winning/losing/drawing (which is what gaming is about). Do we see randomness in supposed games everyday? Yes! Can randomness make it interesting and unexpected? Of course. But, entertainment is not gaming. The violation of the principles of fairness, to ANY degree, is a violation of the form of game. To the degree an activity is random, it is not a game.

 

Take the game of Poker. Insofar as a poker player played his hand the best it could have been played, assuming and considering the random components of poker in his calculations, he is responsible for it, and he is in that respect gaming. So, keeping calculably good hands would be a form of skill, and the evaluations of plays themselves (as opposed to their results), which are based on probability, can have any meaning in judging fairness and skill of a player. Insofar as poker is luck of the draw, and the player is not responsible in this respect, that person is not gaming. Sure, from a macro perspective, over thousands of games, the brilliant poker player will have a lot more wins than the unskilled poker player, this is just probability. And, in this scope, over an infinite set of games, we can maintain skill-based play by judging the winner of the overall win/loss percentages. Controlled random factors can be possible in a game played to an infinite series. But, then we are only judging percentage of wins/loses/ties, and it is problematic that you have to use an infinite series of games to make such a judgement (which is hardly practical to finite beings). Most important, we cannot judge a single match or single play and always say about poker, Player A deserved to win over Player B, because Player A is more skilled. Insofar as Player A played with actual skill, and non-competitive forces and factors did not influence the outcome or fairness of the game, Player A deserves what he gets, and he is truly gaming. But, as poker really does have a large amount of randomness, poker players are really playing a hybrid of gaming and gambling. Poker is not a true and pure game. However fun it may be, fun is a secondary effect and function of a game. The object of the game-ness found in poker is to win, or to do the very best with what you have. However, it remains that randomness eliminates many elements of what could make Poker a true game. Instead, it is a form of gambling.

 

Other non-competitve influences like the weather might actually be calculable to begin with. And, in cases that there are not, maybe due to our innate intelligence (or lack thereof), we are limited in the scope of our responsibility. This is quite similar to Stephen Hawkings innate problems of playing basketball.Regardless, it is clear that non-competitive forces in our games are a major flaw, and prevent us from creating games that conform fully to the form of gaming.

 

Clearly, metagame rulesets that are unfair in a game stem from an initially unfair base ruleset. In order to adjust inequalities and unfairness in metagames rulesets, one must adjust the base ruleset. And, when a game has a truly fair base ruleset, a fair metagame must evolve. Is this practical, can it be applied? To some extent, yes. And, at the very least, as we know the meaning of the form of gaming, we can attempt to align our games with the perfect form of gaming through deduction, comparison, and some disciplined thinking in general.

3.) Testing is the execution of the game itself. It is the objective(s) of the player(s). It combines fairness and rules, and provides the battleground on which a player mentally and/or physically competes with himself and/or others. This IS the game. It has no value in itself, other than it is the mechanism which reveals the winners and losers. Pretty simple.

4.) Playing for the sake of playing is the last attribute of gaming Iâ€™ve found. This principle is true of the very form of games, because if you play for any other reason, you arenâ€™t gaming. Competing, yes maybeâ€¦gaming, no. A race for production at work, playing for the money, or playing to impress someone is not gaming-- If this is your function of such an activity, then you are looking at the form of something else entirely.

 

How can this be?

 

Take 2 different activities of Chess. Event 1 is comprised of two people who have nothing at stake in the game, they play simply because they want to win. They play to test themselves against the rules of chess in a fair manner. Event 2 is comprised of two people who will win a million dollars for winning the event. They play to win yes, but they play to win in virtue of the million dollars, not in virtue of winning alone. They donâ€™t care who deserved to win, they donâ€™t care about the very game itself, they care about the million dollars. And, even if they did care about winning in virtue of winning to some extent, if winning in virtue of the million dollars was the actual priority and prime motivation to play, then we would still say that are playing to win a million dollars. Event 1 is gaming, Event 2 is competing for a million dollars. The ends sought by the players at the two events differ, and thus the very nature of the events are different. In gaming, you seek virtue of the practice, not the effects thereof.Participating in an event because it has cool graphics, or a good narrative, or because youâ€™ll be []D[][]V[][]Dinâ€™ with the ladies, win cash, or to fill in your miserably boring life, etc, is not gaming. These are different ends in themselves, and the form of a different activity. Identical in procedures, possibly, but gaming they are not.

 

In conclusion:

 

Look in the history of games, what form and function do they all possess? Narrow those attributes down, and you will see I am correct concerning fair competition for the sake of winning as being central and necessary for a game to exist...It is what makes a game a game. As vacuumous as it may appear, and as cold and simple as it would seem. You can remove ALL other components from a game, and it can even be strictly abstract...but without the fair competition for the sake of winning, there is no game.
