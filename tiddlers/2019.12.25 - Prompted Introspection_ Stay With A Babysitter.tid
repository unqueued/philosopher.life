title: 2019.12.25 - Prompted Introspection: Stay With A Babysitter

!! How do you feel when you stay with a babysitter?

It's been a couple decades. I am open to the claim that some people in my life are my babysitter, my keeper, etc. They slap my hands when I reach for the cookie jar (or the alcohol), demand I go shower or fart elsewhere, remind me that my fly is down or my shirt backward (still fucking do it all these years later), offer to entertain me with braincandy and conversation, tell me my verbage and manners are flat-out disgusting, or even cook (or help me cook) a meal (hotdogs and mac + dat foodstamp cheese). Even my children beg me to go to bed earlier (and, of course, they are correct). 

I think when they eventually drag me to prison or the looney-bin, my babysitters will tend to be scum of the urf. I wonder if I will learn to shut my face or find another way out by then. I have to wait until my son's frontal lobes have developed, and then I actually get real weird with it (<3 Frank Reynolds).
