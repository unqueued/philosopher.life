* Package and mail the computer.
** Farewell. You were almost [[m16]]! 128GB of RAM would have been used. Well, I hope whoever bought you will take good care of you.
* LETTERS ;P
* I'd like to see you slow down on watching shows. 
* I like that you are rounding out your multireddits. Decent quality drug feeders. Inject it straight into my veins, please.
* Still don't know schedule with [[gh057]]. If it works out, cool! He's an exceptionally busy man.
* [[k0sh3k]] is working late tomorrow.
** Maybe that soy pasta? Never tried that before. Maybe wait. Dairy is preferred.
*** No, lunch with the family is preferred.
