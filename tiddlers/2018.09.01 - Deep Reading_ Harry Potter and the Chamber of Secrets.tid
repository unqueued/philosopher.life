title: 2018.09.01 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

I do not understand why there is a lack of understanding on the adults' part for their arrival by car. This is not a logical part of the book, but I suppose that's par for the course here.

Perhaps my son has Neville's lack of memory in him. I need to think more about that comparison.

It also annoys me the disparities in the dangers they are allowed and disallowed to face. That inconsistency, however, actually does match reality for most children, imho. 

The issue of celebrity here is fascinating. I wonder how much Rowling's personal experiences play into this. Regardless, I appreciate the pushback against the pursuit of vanity and popularity.

Quidditch only solidified for me the stupidity of caring about sports in many respects. LOL being a late exception, somehow.
