!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

I'm getting more sleep. My rash is slowly clearing up, but I have a ton of cuts and burns on me from working. I'm sore, but it's doable. I don't feel as anxious this week, although, I may be feeling a bit more depressed.

!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

I've given my daughter the entire summer to get her act together on our school plan. She's been a complete fuck up. My son has done better, but still oscillates heavily. I'm desperate to find anything that will work. Public schools start in 2 weeks. We're going to try unschooling until then.

It sucks coming home and just being angry, saddened, despairing, and disappointed with my children. It's not the life I want to lead with them. We've tried everything we know how to do. We're at our wits end. So, now, I'm lifting my expectations. I'll treat them like adults for whom I have a responsibility to feed, cloth, shelter, and talk to. 

You chose to be autonomous, children. Welcome to beginnings of adulthood.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

We have no power to make our children do their work. There are no carrots or sticks available to us that work. We have reasoned with them. We've been patient. We've done our best. It's not working. 

I'm giving them the power now. If they want to fuck it up, then they will. It's on them. I'm here to help if and when they want it. 

The consequences are tremendous, but at some point, they have to take responsibility for themselves. They have to choose to learn. I can't make them. They have to find the will to become the kind of person who is interested in empathizing with themselves, progressing, and improving their lives. I can't do it alone; it takes two to tango.

!! What are you going to do about what happened?

They can play ball my way and not pay rent post-18, or they can do it their way and pay rent. I think they need to see they have goals to work towards. Being a functioning adult is one big one. I should probably think about this more.
