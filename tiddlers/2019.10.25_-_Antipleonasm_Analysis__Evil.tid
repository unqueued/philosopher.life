title: 2019.10.25 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Evil

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Labeling something as 'evil' gives us permission not to understand that thing. Something 'evil' is beyond our sphere of understanding, and maintaining this distinction between the comprehensible and the incomprehensible is an expedient way to moralize about the world. To suggest that evil is obsolete is to express an arrogance that we can know and understand everything; that there are no shadowy corners of ourselves or others that we fear. Evil is, therefore, a way to express otherness, and to discharge evil elements from society as the individual conceives it. Whether this is self-deluding is certainly a question, but it seems likely that this refusal to understand is a central element to our common use of the term.

Gawjus. Thank [[good]]ness there are people wrestling with what matters most in this world. We are at the heart of philosophy.

Surely, you do not mean that just because something is, in fact, evil or even just because we fallibly label it as such permits us to not understand or Reasonably^^tm^^ pursue a semblance of an understanding of it (I dearly, paranoically, and hypercharitably [[hope]] the opposite is your point). One cannot understand [[good]] without evil, nor [[right]] without wrong. They dialectically define each other, although one is the master. The application of the knowledge of [[Good]] and Evil [[irwartfrr]] is {[[axiom]]}atically the [[root]] of the [[virtue of wisdom|Virtue is Knowledge]]; you wouldn't be ironically dismissing these notions as archaic concepts which have no place in metamodernity, [[right]]? Surely, you are radically pointing out the evil of such a thing. Of course, it's often evil to claim it's conceptually evil to claim something or someone is evil to any [[dok]]. I'm not going to allow you to just help yourself to the notion of [[The Good]] without profound commitment; we're not here to merely play semantics (often a cursed thought-terminator), the meaning of all the marbles is actually at stake in our discourse.<<ref "s">>

What or who gives us this permission? What is permissibility as a normative concept? Are you going to distinguish evil from wrongness? Do you simply mean to say that we are unjustifiably licensing ourselves to be willfully ignorant as a rationalization or confabulation? I agree that many heroic individuals and herds apply labels without due process or Reason, //*ahem*//, and often conveniently outgroup as egoists who have no intention of having the epistemic humility and charity to radically empathize with [[others]]. I am, of course, worried about the self-superior grey-tribe enthusiasts who aim to label labeling as evil, even as quietistic conversational implicature. You absolutely have a right to question [[The Absolute]] to some [[dok]], but if you have integrity, you'll have to circle back to owning up the self-serving hypocrisy of absolutely denying [[It]].<<ref "w">>

The constitutivists, constructivists, formalists, coherentists, internalists, masturbatory pure solipsists claiming to be doing real philosophy with undebracketable figments of their imagination, egoistic cosmic flatteners, and non-cognitivists are happy to play along in this game of claiming there is no objective evil, no possible evil unity of the self, no meaningful evil to dissect or interpret, no being that ought not be, and so forth. There is no evil, there is only [[good]] (or [[beautiful]]), [[right]]? Lol. I will grant some element of Scholasticism or Manich√¶ism has merit. I will grant that unreason is not Reason all the way down. I will grant absolute coherence cannot be completely achieved by the [[fff]], but it must be scaled to our contexts; we rest upon [[faith]] in [[The Dialetheia]] as our foundation. If your claim is that claiming something is evil is to claim it cannot be comprehensible all the way down, I agree, but obviously it can be comprehended to some [[dok]]. It is in the understanding of evil that we can learn what it is not, its opposite, what actually matters, where it goes wrong, how to defeat it, where the threads must be pulled to unravel the evil fabric or how to fittingly reconstruct it to turn vice into virtue. Of course, we need [[antipleonasm]]s and footholds; it is a lossy empirical wandering, but even that requires justification.

I do not, however, see why I should agree that suggesting evil is obsolete is conceptually that kind of arrogance. I agree that is one of the possible kinds of [[arrogance]], though we must be careful in our analysis here. We must, for example, distinguish what is knowable for us, we as we are (particular [[fff]]s), from what is knowable more generally. I also find most dismissals of the concept of evil are in virtue of other kinds of arrogance, usually one which assumes we are the locus of meaning (reducible to some contingent fabrication), a relativistic flattening and quietist denial of eternalist metanarrativity, as though we have artificially constructed the concept of evil rather than discovering truth outside ourselves. A [[good]] philosopher knows the complete and absolute essence of The Real meanings and The Ideal beings of both [[Good]] and evil are necessarily outside and [[other]] to us, even though we are comprised by, constituents of, and constituted instantiations or particulars of these hyperobject-property-processes to some [[dok]].

It's crucial that we can see the difference between "shadowy corners of ourselves or others that we fear" and those which merit fear. Do not conflate them. Note, of course, that evil is not necessarily that which we fear either! [[Good]] evil is often quite [[beautiful]].<<ref "ge">> Even in enjoyment, we must reserve some portion of ourselves to paranoically fear such things, seeking deconstructive [[redpills]] and lenses to refactor our reconstructive [[diamonds]] and perceptions toward [[The Truth]] as best we can. Evil can be seductive, attractive, and not necessarily feared in all contexts. Fear and attraction require recursive quantification to earn justified qualification. 

Please note, there is a difference between how we commonly wield and apply the word "evil" in society and the external, objective concept which we ought aim to wisely wield and apply. Do not slip into anti-realism, for that is evil. I will agree that a refusal to understand evil is usually evil, at least as I ([[hope]]fully) increasingly understand it. Of course, empathy is necessary but insufficient,<<ref "e">> and outgrouping is not conceptually evil in itself. I suggest it is possible you are being fuzzy on purpose here, but I do not know. 

Let us admit some [[dok]] of vagueness, OOOitivity, fuzziness, grayness, [[fff]]ness, dimensionality, and the necessity of paradoxicity<<ref "f">> at some level without denying objectivity of [[The Good]] and our deeply problematic relationship to [[It]]. Let us recognize that [[other]]ness is a lacking, a privation, an infeasibility to some [[dok]], and a dialectical catalyst for requiring humble paranoic charity in search of [[The Good]] outside and inside us without denying that we are all evil and usually even unjustified to some [[dok]]. Yes, one must [[name]] evil in oneself and the world (including [[others]] [including variations of our own transworld identities]) wisely, for that is the necessity of wisdom, to pick out that which [[salient]] from that which is not in a context in pursuit of the context of all contexts.

Lastly, one can and must learn "to discharge evil elements from society as the individual conceives it" to the best of their justified abilities, which means coming to grips with evil by having empathized with it. It is by refusing to refuse to understand the [[W5H]] nature, causation, essence, and reason for lack of reason for evil that we are permitted and sometimes obligated to prevent or destroy it. Inevitably, regardless of your efficacy and [[dok]] of justification, the pursuit of [[The Good]] [[irwartfrr]] is your plight and obligation, whether you choose to explicitly recognize it or not.
