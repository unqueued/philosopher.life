How's your week going?

Yo. How are you?

Hey! I am alive, at the very least. I hardly touched my phone Monday - Wednesday because of my work event and then went into hibernation afterward because I was so tired.
Nov 8, 2019 10:29am
You survived! It's over, yeah?
Nov 8, 2019 10:30am
It is indeed

Months of planning, stress, and frustration with my boss all for two days. And now it’s over.
Nov 8, 2019 10:30am
Hopefully, you can take a couple days off and chill.

Oh, and if you haven’t seen on the news, Humana is going through a big layoff. Hundreds of people had their positions removed, including a manager on my team. Just learned yesterday that that manager’s team is going to be merged with ours. I am confident my boss is going to make an absolute mess of this department. I want out before it continues.

I’ve been doing some soul-searching about looking for jobs. I think my heart would be in the process more if I were looking somewhere I genuinely cared about — I think I want to work at a non-profit or charity. I want to work somewhere that my job means something.
Nov 8, 2019 10:34am
Aye. That must be anxiety inducing. I hope you find a way out asap too.

It's important to soul-search. Your life is a resource, and it's hard to spend wisely enough. You spend at least 30-40% of your waking hours (and arguably even more of your emotional spoons) working, and it's nice to be able to look yourself in the mirror and be content with yourself.
