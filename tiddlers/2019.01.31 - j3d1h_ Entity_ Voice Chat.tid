I listened to Entity speak with my wife. They instantly connected. It was uncanny. Same TV shows, similar personalities, intonation, chatterboxy. Neat. I spoke with him. It went well. He's clearly a smart kid. He followed several lines of reasoning that matter to me. He adores narratives, is extremely talkative, and I think is overall charismatic. Seems like a good pick for a boyfriend, imho.
