title: 2017.07.24 -- Wiki Review Log

I wrote most of my logs for yesterday in bed last night in sublime. I had to graft again. Should I include the grafted work today, or should I just stick to what was literally posted? This is an important convention that I need to think about. For now, I'm going to just go day-by-day. I should give reasons for why the actual day of posting and the date in the title may not match.
