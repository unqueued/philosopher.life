I know a lot of socialists who do not like tankies. I do not understand why, but I am surely missing something important.

I have no patience anymore for socialists/anarchists/communists/leftists who aren't Marxists

I am not convinced you can be socialist/communist/leftist without being some kind of Marxist. Anarchism seems much broader to me (it tells me too little about someone's point of view).

Violence is part of the necessary means to defeating the centralization of power. A leftist unwilling to commit violence appears to be a leftist in name only.

Well I think even your typical ancom will be generally ok with violent revolution. I think the difference is they are dispositionally allergic to state power being leveraged to support it
