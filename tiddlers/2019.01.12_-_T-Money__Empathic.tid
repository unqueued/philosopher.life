Thank you! =)
FRI 12:40 PM
Sorry, I took so long to respond. It's been a hell of a few days for me.
FRI 12:40 PM
Everything alright? Hell in your head or external issues?
SAT 11:07 AM
nothing different, just the usual
SAT 12:09 PM
Fair enough. Hope it settles down.
SAT 12:26 PM
How's your week been?
SAT 12:27 PM
Up and down. The usual. Lol. Weekends are a reprive from the monotony of work unfortunately I am generally overwhelmed with projects at home that need to be worked on. So I fill my days with more work.
SAT 12:29 PM
preach
SAT 12:30 PM
:joy:
SAT 12:30 PM
I've been thinking about our letters more and more.
SAT 12:30 PM
That problem continues to show up for us.
SAT 12:30 PM
I have discovered a new online community. (FIRE) Finanical independence retire early.
SAT 12:31 PM
There are few like it.
SAT 12:31 PM
Maybe repeating myself. If so, my apologies.
SAT 12:31 PM
You aren't, and I'm listening.
SAT 12:32 PM
Looking to pay off all debt by end of year and persue a job that fulfills me ME more and is closer to home, maybe part time. I have discovered that substitute teachers in ky are eligible for teachers insurance.
SAT 12:33 PM
So I could sub teach and then do whatever to make $. I have strong feelings that I can make just as much $ doing odd jobs/handy man stuff and help people out in the process.
SAT 12:34 PM
Being your own master would be nice.
SAT 12:35 PM
And be here to pick my kid up from school, take her to lessons, play more music with her. Time. Is slipping. And before I know it she will be gone. I can always return to higher paying jobs in say 8 or 10 years. And not have the stress of a young child.
SAT 12:36 PM
You are in an excellent position to do so.
SAT 12:37 PM
I just don't feel like I am able to be the dad I can be when I'm tire and worn out all the time. I wanna spend more time. With her. I wanna show her a hard work ethic. I want to teach her all the skills I know. So she is a capable female and not reliant on someone else for this or that.
SAT 12:38 PM
Indeed. I envy the time you get to spend with your kiddos.
SAT 12:38 PM
I'm sure you will do an amazing job. She will be lucky to have you there.
SAT 12:39 PM
I actually feel like I'm failing on that front and slowly losing my mind bit by bit, lol.
SAT 12:39 PM
I already beat out my dad and step dad. So I guess I can consider that a win.
SAT 12:40 PM
Yup. Same.
SAT 12:40 PM
In the end, I'm looking to be the best version of myself I can be.
SAT 12:40 PM
I'm afraid I'm just trying to give my daughter the appearance of the best version. And reserving the cynical depressed man for time apart from Her.
SAT 12:41 PM
I guess that's what all parents do though really. Haha
SAT 12:42 PM
I cannot say I'm a good parent, but I will say that I'm honest all the way down with my kids.
SAT 12:42 PM
They know I intend to take my life.
SAT 12:42 PM
They read my wiki each week too.
SAT 12:43 PM
They have a very high chance of experiencing severe depressions (runs heavily on both sides of the family).
SAT 12:43 PM
I'm sorry you feel like you want to take your own life.
SAT 12:44 PM
I appreciate that. Thank you.
SAT 12:44 PM
I know the feeling. but I fight the fuck out of it.
SAT 12:44 PM
I can see that.
SAT 12:44 PM
I've been thinking about your letter quite a bit.
SAT 12:45 PM
Brilliance is a burden... And sir you have a brilliant mind. I would hate to see you leave this world prematurely. Please call or text anytime, day or. Night. If you need a non judgemental ear.
SAT 12:46 PM
A second perspective if often all it takes to bring more light when you are in a dark place. To dark to see.
SAT 12:47 PM
That is. Not an empty invitation. Anytime, call or text. I'll be there for you.
SAT 12:48 PM
Thank you. I appreciate that. It is a blessing to not be alone. Obviously, my ear is always listening to you, night or day. These are the friendships I hope to cultivate.
SAT 12:50 PM
Agreed.

SAT 4:27 PM
That looks like heaven. Add in a gigabit connecting, and make it so my job is at home, and I'm 15 minutes away from everyone with the closest building being a grocery store/walmart, etc.
SAT 9:00 PM
I am unsure. I might could manage without the internet in this setting. A complete disconnect. Off grid living using hydro, wind, and solar and propane for the other. Refillable. Also wood burning stove. Spend all my time hunting fishing and chopping wood. Lol.
SAT 10:28 PM
It reminds me of one of my {[[Dreams]]}.
SAT 10:29 PM
I can appreciate your vision quite a bit.
SAT 10:29 PM
I owe it to society to stay connected. It's [[The Golden Rule]] that I am a witness of [[Humanity]], that I participate as a citizen, and that I'm connected to my fellow homo sapiens. It's often extremely unpleasant. I do see the personal utopia angle of isolationism, of course.
SAT 10:31 PM
I'd like the community style you might see in Alaska. Neighbors far away but always willing to help. And be a part of that style community. I'm afraid the greater society at large is too far gone.
SAT 10:36 PM
Donald trump is Prez and he ran against hill dog. Gracious. How do we recover?
SAT 10:37 PM
=)
SAT 10:38 PM
I know that question can't be answered. Ment to be funny.
SAT 10:38 PM
I hope you are wrong.
SAT 10:38 PM
I'm working hard to find an answer (I'm that arrogant ;P).
SAT 10:38 PM
A giant flood. Antibiotic resistant bacteria or virus wipe 3/4 of the world Out. Lol. Start with a smaller body of folks.
SAT 10:41 PM
I have a book for you.
SAT 10:41 PM
It's fun.
SAT 10:41 PM
Oryx and Crake
SAT 10:41 PM
Short and powerful

SAT 10:43 PM
Atwood is a genius
SAT 10:44 PM
Looks like. It's about a child being harmed. I have intense emotions about that. I don't like to hear or think about it! It brings our the rage in me.
SAT 10:44 PM
Well, you have my recommendation anyway. Some books will make you rage, wail, weep, gnash your teeth. The author pours hot coals on our heads. Meaning often requires suffering.
SAT 10:45 PM
It is not so much about the child. Though, that is still a shocking part of the book, it is not the primary aspect.
SAT 10:46 PM
I don't disagree. Hell, I know why the caged bird sings was hard for me. Lol.
SAT 10:46 PM
