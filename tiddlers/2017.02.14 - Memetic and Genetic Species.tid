title: 2017.02.14 - Memetic and Genetic Species

Homo sapiens can be categorized in many ways. Let's be clear: differentiation is not conceptually immoral human prejudice (racism, sexism, etc.) by definition, even though in practice they often are connected (sometimes a poor theory is applied, and sometimes we see a poor application of a theory). 

There are genetic categories of human beings. Depending on how you differentiate (your principles and reasons for them), you may see only one genetic category or you may see each individual human as their own genetic species, or you may see something in between. This is the genetic categorization spectrum. Again, we're generating description, not prescription here. 

There are clearly memetic categories of human beings as well. I think pure Kantians and pure Psychopaths are different memetic species. Again, we're generating description (not prescription) here.
