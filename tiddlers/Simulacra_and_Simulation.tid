title: Simulacra and Simulation

//Reality is darker than you are willing to recognize, but it could be brighter than what you can imagine.//

<<<
The simulacrum is never that which conceals the truth—it is the truth which conceals that there is none. The simulacrum is true.

--Ecclesiastes<<ref "1">>

Simulacra are artifact -> memes which disclose microcosms or even completely simulated realities to us. They are meme-matrices, experience machines. These memeplexes present their own hyperrealities to our consciousness. We are desire-satisfaction seekers, consumers. We stimulate ourselves, gorged with meaning, but sometimes we reject realities provided by these simulacra. It is very redpilled.

We are complicit in our story-telling and consumption. We prefer copies of reality to reality itself. Meaning is not stable for us; it is difficult to know what is real and what isn't. It is painful to peel back the layers. Is there something at the bottom, underneath? This is the epistemic foundation problem.

I see historiographies and [[The Great Human Conversation]] here; metanarratives are inescapable. You cannot be your own exclusive story-teller. Kant was right on some crucial issues here (as usual).

I remind you have deception uses people as mere means to an end. Simulacra and simulation are perhaps necessary tools but also dangerous weapons. Powerful simulacra mask the fact that there is no reality, truth, or original beneath them. 

This is an incredibly paranoid phenomenology. I admire the high standards of skeptics. Who could trust a man who does not know he lies to himself?.

Also, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon is clearly related to the Ring of Gyges (even if its the opposite of it). 

Argument is meta about the question of ontological realism/anti-realism. I suggest that there is an objective reality, but we are stuck in our subjective experiences with enough limits that there are both practical and theoretical reasons we can never know the truth. Without a doubt, what we experience is merely a simulation (an experience machine) of reality. It's a story we tell ourselves inside an objective physical reality. We aren't ideal epistemic agents, and all we really have are these stories. We never escape them. There will always be more cave escapes and turtles all the way down.

The inputs to our perception have been saturated with simulacra that it has rendered the infinite mutability of meaning into meaninglessness.

4 Stages or Degrees of Signs:

# Integrity Logos
#* Faithful copy or representation of an original artifact of reality.
#* "reflection of a profound reality;" "the sacramental order;" a positive appearance.
#* Sometimes it may actually be a relevantly accurate representation. It is difficult to know when our belief is the result of authentic representations or otherwise.
#* Narrow-time-slice simulacra perfection here (as opposed to persistent, long-term, large time-slice simulacra) gives you no reason to think reality is not as it appears.
#* This is found in the premodern period, where representation is clearly an artificial placemarker for the real item. The uniqueness of objects and situations marks them as irreproducibly real and signification obviously gropes towards this reality.

# Reality Perversion
#* The sign is a noticeably unfaithful copy of the original which reveals to you that it "masks and denatures" reality as an evil appearance.
#* The sign/logos does not faithfully reveal reality to us, but can hint at the existence of an obscure reality which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.
#** The real world contains the cave; no simulator can simulate anything larger than itself; therefore the redpill opens you to a larger world that by definition cannot be expressed by the sign. 
#* Get woke! You are now aware of the fact that you are in Plato's Cave. You saw the signs that you are in The Matrix. 
#** You took a redpill or you've seen a glitch in the Matrix.
#* Are you feeling paranoid? Are you parting with the narrative you've always known? Is this schizotypal to you?
#* Second order, associated with the modernity of the Industrial Revolution, where distinctions between representation and reality break down due to the proliferation of mass-reproducible copies of items, turning them into commodities. The commodity's ability to imitate reality threatens to replace the authority of the original version, because the copy is just as "real" as its prototype.

# Artificial Reality
#* There is no representation, even if there is a claim to it. It's not simply a corrupted copy of an original because there is no original. It is complete illusion rather than misperception of a foundational reality. This artificial reality masks the fact that there is nothing real underneath it.
#* The "order of sorcery", a regime of semantic algebra where all human meaning is conjured artificially to appear as a reference to the (increasingly) hermetic truth.
#* Seems third order.

# Pure Simulacrum
#* The sign overtly has no relationship to any reality whatsoever. It doesn't hide the fact that it is simulacrum, it celebrates it.
#* In a transparent way (as opposed to the hiddenness of the 3rd stage), signs point to other signs, but there are no signs which point to a foundational reality beneath it.
#* Signs merely reflect other signs and any claim to reality on the part of images or signs is only of the order of other such claims. 
#* The regime of total equivalency, where cultural products need no longer even pretend to be real in a naïve sense, because the experiences of consumers' lives are so predominantly artificial that even claims to reality are expected to be phrased in artificial, "hyperreal" terms. Any naïve pretension to reality as such is perceived as bereft of critical self-awareness, and thus as oversentimental.
#* This is the absolute vertigo of post-modernism.
#* This is the third order, associated with the postmodernity of Late Capitalism, where the simulacrum precedes the original and the distinction between reality and representation vanishes. There is only the simulation, and originality becomes a totally meaningless concept

It seems that the philosopher who knows he jumps from hyperreality vortex to vortex, who knows he is peeling away layers of reality has a a choice to make about whether or not to continue playing the game.
