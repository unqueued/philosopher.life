title: 2018.04.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Last Dream

!! What was your last dream about?

Lady Melisandre, have you been looking at today's Carpe Tempus Segmentum log?<<ref "1">>

I've been dreaming about the nature of [[The Good]]. I argued with old professors about it. I'm not sure what exactly happened, and I don't wish to enable any confabulation on my part.

I'm slowly working towards an account that I like. I'm very pleased to have dreamt about it, as that usually means it's really part of me, on my mind heavily, etc. It's kind of like dreaming/hallucinating about Tetris after playing it for many hours. It's an interesting issue to read about.
