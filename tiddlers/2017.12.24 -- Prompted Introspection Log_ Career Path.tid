title: 2017.12.24 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Career Path

!! Explain how you chose your career path.

Like most millennials, I do not have one set career that I keep for life. I anticipate I will have had dozens of jobs over my lifetime. It is a clustered road, not a clean path. Such are the times. I've worked with my hands, I've worked a ton in academic settings, and I've had some standard office professional experience as well. Why did I choose the moves? Because I thought they were moral, practical, and the right thing to do given my circumstances. I've been floating, and that's because I've not had my tentpegs put down in addition to having a very difficult time finding a fitting place for me in the world.
