!! Audit:

* I talk to and/or about politics, myself, my exploiters, and the [[Conceiving About: The Inconceivable]] quite a bit. 
* The dialectical concerns ended up being worked elsewhere into the wiki. In fact, several of my moves in [[/b/]] spread like a virus.
* I've been struggling in my relationship with JRE. I can see his memory is not as good as mine; it keeps showing up. That makes it extra complicated.
* Neat! I've just realized that [[Find The Others]] is an outgrowth of much of the stream-of-conscious work I do here in [[/b/]]. 
* Excellent economics concerns.
* My brother's claim: "Sometimes it feels like the window i use to look out into the world is getting smaller..." was very moving to me.
* Stripping out more to place elsewhere. Neato beans!
* As usual, I'm in love the fact that I took the time to write in [[/b/]]. It's tough and worth every penny. Thank you, self!
