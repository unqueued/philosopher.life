title: 2019.09.27 - Afterschool Teaching: Purest Babysitting

Whitney and I arrived together. She talked about why she was early this time. She needed help moving things out of her vehicle, but she wouldn't take it! 

The teachers said the kids were crazy today. I can see that. 

Prep was fast. My highschoolers looked demolished. It's a Friday. 

A random girl (who was obviously poor) asked for applesauce and carrots. I told her not to retrieve it, but to let me get it (lots of people around). The art teacher still saw the transaction and was unhappy with both of us. She chided that the girl would eat the entire cart if I let her. If the girl wants more, I'm giving her more. Take it out my peanuts slave wages. 

I've been told students have been banned from the lab because an XXX search popped up. Lawdy. I haven't been officially told, so we're still going. 

Whitney said she had homework to do, and she handed her children to me. 

It was not a pleasant time in the library cage for most of us. It is difficult to deal with a portion of my children who are forced to be here against their will, but I will pay the price which capitalists and reactionaries refuse. Everyone got their homework done, several studied for tests, a few read, some play magic, but at least half were imprisoned with no recourse. 

10AM and I talked about why she is forced to be here, and that's because she has to travel 45 minutes to get to this school system (which is a huge improvement for her and her sister). She was looking at a high school connected to the state university, the city school (which she felt was too snooty; she's right, but she needs to go anyway), and homeschooling. We walked through the options. She said the high school next door wasn't much better than this, lol. Jesus Christ. I can see why she needs to get the fuck out of here. I drove home why she needs to speak with her parents yet again. We talked about capitalism, and I carefully walked her through some problems in moral responsibility. 

7C and I talked about being middle class. His quasi-GF joined us. They agreed they are relatively lucky. 

7G was hilarious. So much sanity in that girl despite the radical abuse she has suffered. Her mom aint perfect, but she does love her. I find myself telling many of my students about how much their parents love them regarding particular moves they (the parents) make. I get a wide range of reactions on this. 

A migraine while herding cats is fun. I find myself in energy-conservation mode just trying to survive. It's whackamole, pure attention whirlwind, and incredibly draining to deal with these children solo. I was badgered a ton. I can barely stand many of these students even without that piercing pain in my eyeball. The three-man job is soloed again. 

My squad was super disappointed, yet again. It is unfair to them, and I can't fix it. =(

Whitney came back at the tail end of the day. This enabled me to clean with my squad and hit the lab for a bit. =)

At the end, Delp said he forgot to tell me (with a smirk) that no student in the entire school is allowed to use a computer until the county figures out how to block sites because an 8th grader looked up something he wasn't supposed to (I abhor the censorship, but if someone was going to get in trouble for it, I'm thankful it wasn't on my watch). Also, as always, sports teams take precedence over the field and gym, so that leaves us classrooms and the library. =)
