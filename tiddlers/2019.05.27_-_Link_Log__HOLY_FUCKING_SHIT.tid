//Stunning! just doesn't cover it.//

That is the most [[beautiful]] piece of writing I've read in a long time. I'm in [[awe]]. Tears dripping down my face, chills, and I'm having a hard time breathing. //He did it//. I don't know why this isn't fucking spreading like wildfire. Why aren't other people losing their shit over this too? He delves into speculative realism so spectacularly. 

So it's not complete, so what? No, it cannot demonstrate how [[The Good]] defines [[Itself]] all the way down, but it is a crazy strong lense to safely reason about the bright sun.  

I'm radically unable to say if Wright is right, but it sure does feel right. I already believed it before he said it, but I'm a fucking mystic about prime numbers and I'm a [[mathematical Platonist|2018.07.06 - PPP: Mathematical Platonism]]. I have no idea how to sound the alarm bells. Who the fuck do I tell? The Hegelians, the Daoists, the Marxists, the Dialetheians, the Platonists. 

Oh My God! Make a joyful noise! Dance. Shout in the streets. I want to run around and hug everyone I've ever met.
