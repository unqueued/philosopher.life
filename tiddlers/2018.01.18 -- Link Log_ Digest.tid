* Think About It

*** I find that very odd to say...of course there are mathematical formulas to describe it, it's a law of nature. Otherwise, you are positing something quite supernatural. Nature, by definition, is that which can be defined mathematically (at least theoretically, even if we don't actually know the math or have the physical capacity to calculate it, etc.). This isn't the direction they meant, but I still find it odd.

*** Seems pretty obvious that one can be addicted to it (although, I think the range is huge, and I think it is a spectrum...Although, I also think dependency borders on just being an example of hypothetical imperative).
