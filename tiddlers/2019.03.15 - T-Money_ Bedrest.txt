I'm OK if I rest in our bed alot. Then when I get up and about it gets worse and worse pain and discomfort.
FRI 2:11 PM
I'm upset, scared, mad, and trying to remain strong even in weakness.
FRI 2:12 PM
Thank you for asking. How are you sir?

I can imagine it must be extremely emotional. Pain and uncertainty do not go nicely together.
FRI 2:13 PM
Pain that I can measure and know how it's going to end and why is sometimes not really so painful.
FRI 2:13 PM
I'm reading and writing my ass off, as usual.
FRI 2:14 PM
Indeed. I feel like a mooch. Cause sometimes I have no pain. After long rests. And then I move a certain way or twist or bend and it's pain again. Like 3-5 on a scale of 10.

I don't have leg pains which usually indicate disk herniated and is pressing on nerve. But just because I don't have leg pain doesn't mean shit either.

I've always had a strong back.... It was something I ttok pride in. And it's like. Life is trying to take that away from me.

It must be depersonalizing, derealizing, like losing a part of your identity.

And I'm afraid I'm paranoid. I'm over reacting, maybe it's just a pulled muscles and I'm fine and there are other guys who have serous spinal problems including my wife.
FRI 2:20 PM

I can appreciate needing to be able to talk about it. Sucks to be alone.

Cause I'm tired of seeing these online. I figured I make one myself. I had a cheap strat that I cut to fit into a cigar box. Now I have a cigar box electric. Lol. Hopefully I didn't take too much off the neck to body. Otherwise I will be shimming . But should function like a strat.
FRI 10:11 PM
Hope you enjoy it.
FRI 10:15 PM
Haven't played it yet. Still wiring. Then string it to see if I need to shim it. But it's cool. More of a talk piece Thab much else.
FRI 10:19 PM
