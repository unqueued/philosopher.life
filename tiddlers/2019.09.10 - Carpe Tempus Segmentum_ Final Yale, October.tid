* Woke at 10
** Groggy AF. Jesus.
* Dialectures
** Was awesome to have [[k0sh3k]] there. We rabbitholed, walked through propaganda, and wandered a great deal in our conversation. 
* Offspring were on task, but that failed when I left.
* Read
* Fireman Time!
* Work
* Talked with my bro.
* Offspring and I brawled.
* Ravioli and red sauce, salad, melon, fruit.
* WoW
* Wife couldn't sleep, so we talked. She's gonna wait until she has the (merely possible) offer in hand. There are only two who they are flying up to CT to visit the campus and do the in-person interview. These positions are often for life. It would be so weird and hopefully wonderful.
** She's a ball of nervous energy, stressed, and having a hard time reasoning about it (understandably, and that is not to say I'm doing a good job).
** She's not fair to herself, so I continue to have to walk her down what she owes and doesn't owe to whom and why. It's a limbic system searching for a confabulated justification. I want a reason for why I'm wrong, as usual. She feels guilty when she ought not, and she does not respect herself enough. I'm probably not comforting enough.
** In another life, this woman would be teaching there already.
* WoW
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Chess
* Sleep by 3
