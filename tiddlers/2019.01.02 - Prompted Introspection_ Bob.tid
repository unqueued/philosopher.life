title: 2019.01.02 - Prompted Introspection: Bob

!! Who do you trust the most and why?

Why, Bob, of course. In Bob (not that npm/plugin for TW, for the love all that is Bob-ly) we trust. Who is Bob? Bob is a fucking turtle. There's a bunch of turtles stacked on top of each other, and Bob is the last fucking turtle I can see grinning up at me. I have no idea what's on the other side of the cave, but I'm listening to the representational, correlationist hearsay of that sumbitch. =) I owe Bob a lot.

Bob, Bob, bob.
Bob, Bomb Iran.

Bob, Bob, bob.
Bob, Barbarian.

I can't give you the fucking answer to [[CATI]]. I don't have it. If I had the access codes to the Zion mainframe, I'd give them to you. [[JHBFC]]!

Can you ask a harder question of me? If it's not the zeroth {[[axiom]]}, [[h0p3]] (LLLAAAAAAAAAAMMME), then it's gotta be something way fucking harder to see emerging out of my {[[Principles]]}.
