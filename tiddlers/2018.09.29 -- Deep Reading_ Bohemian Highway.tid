title: 2018.09.29 -- Deep Reading: Bohemian Highway

So, the book starts out incredibly hunky-dory happy. It then has a shift to a legal mistake that appeared terrifying, and then life moves on. I think this book is clearly overly optimistic. It's crucial that we distinguish gratitude from optimism, and I think this book wrongfully conflates them. There is essentially no discussion of what the nature of this political event in his life, though they are some economic illustrations about the kinds of lives he leads. 

I can certainly "feel" in the book, but I think there's a lack of systematic critical reasoning in it. It only points. I'm disappointed.
