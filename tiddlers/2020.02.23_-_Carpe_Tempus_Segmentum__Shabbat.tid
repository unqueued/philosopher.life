title: 2020.02.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Shabbat

* Woke at 9
** Dreams were so vivid, I went back to bed! Lol. 
*** I blame the bliss
** Woke at 10
* Meditation, vits+meds, my crippled [[Fitness Routine]]
* Fireman Time!
* Read
* Coffeebliss
* Hugs and kisses, we began [[Family Time]] immediately.
* Talked and talked. Took us 10 hours. Lots of rabbitholing.
* Someone used his fucking chalkboard (so proud of you sweaty):
** Walking paths in the house
** We're thinking a tiny dining area to have a large space for projects. 
*** For example, my son is constructing things, and it's nice for him to have room on the main floor. The garage is unsuitable, and his room limited.
*** I'd be fine with folding tables and chairs for company.
*** I believe I can re-work the kitchen to use the nook for our regular meals too. Don't need nothing fancy. Either way.
** Passthrough
*** Offspring admitted they just don't use their Windows machines for work very much. Exhorted passthrough again. 
*** Discussions of our workflows.  
** Oh, autostarts set.
** Routinization
** Discussion of Sabbath, again. 
** Templates = [[.tmpl]]s
*** Gonna keep trying to crack this nut. Spend your resources wisely; build free time and space wise, including flexibility into your planning. Increase the confidence interval while being open to change.
** Who are your teachers going to be in life?
** 10-Year Papers
** Heideggerian modes
** Potter's Hand
** Definition of wealth, understanding our space for what it is.  
*** Dune, ofc.
** Honesty.
* We all did some wiki work.
* Read wikis
** Well, they got something done in a single day. Proof it can be done.
* Also, I'm (heinously) getting my [[hope]]s up again. Bernie might actually win. Small step, but I'd gladly take it. There's a tide.
* Read
* Fireman Time!
* Ate some food, fell asleep by 1?
