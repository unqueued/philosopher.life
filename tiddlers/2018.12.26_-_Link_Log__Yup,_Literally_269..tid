*** The best fucking argument I have ever seen against my own position. I really, really want that to be true. I admire this far beyond GPL in its realpolitik incentivization and subversive exploitation of a legal system designed to enslave us all. In good conscience, I cannot use this on my own work. I can agree that the spirit of either this license or my license are the only reasonable options.

**** A fine argument from a capitalist. This is not what motivates my perspective.
