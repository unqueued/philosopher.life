title: Theory of My Self-Dialectic

Software:

* The most fundamental dialectic is SO order to FO. This SO dialectic is occurring on this wiki between {the //About:// of {[[About]]} as the second-order homonculean "I of the I" godhead, the eventual outcome of changes in my identity, the narrative sublator} and {the first-order narrative of the dialectic occurring between //Focus:// of {[[About]]} and ////, the //Focus:// subsection of this page}. All other dialectics on this wiki feed into this fundamental dialectic.
** That looks complicated. I'm sorry. I'm trying to point out the stack; unfortunately, it may grow in complexity.
* What am I to say of the dialectic between //Principles://({[[About]]})<<ref "ne">> and {[[Principles]]}? 
* //About://({[[About]]}) and //Principles://({[[About]]}) are working to sublate everything. They they are therefore the most fundamental dialectic, right?

Hardware:

* Neo-Cartesian Pineal Gland: perhaps fundamental physiological dialectic is between the bi-cameral sides of the brain (or whatever division is best). Without being able to talk to each other, you might lose the second-order sublations that arise from their relationships/connections to each other. Interestingly, each hemisphere has another set of nested hardware dialectic layers in them.
** e.g. The Fastmind vs. Slowmind hardware components of a brain-half seem to be in a dialectic.
