type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!! Describe your father's personality in a short journal entry.

The ravages of poverty and abuse are obvious in him. He has little empathy for anyone except children, which is vicariously just empathizing with his own childhood. That's the best rule of thumb for empathy inside him; he does it to quell his own pain, even indirectly. 

That, of course, is how the mirror-neuron effects of empathy motivate us in the first place; we alleviate the pain of others because we want to alleviate the pain we are feeling on behalf of others. We only trick ourselves into thinking we did it out of respect for the moral law.

He's a conservative with just enough contrarianism in him that he actually thinks he escapes the flaws of his kind. Despite his intelligence, he lacks intellectual integrity. 

He does attempt to have the veneer of level-headedness, but this is more his own brand of //Critical Convervations// skill. He is not level-headed inside. His addictions to food and religion cage a monster inside, and sometimes that monster gets out.

I sincerely believe he tried to be a good person, but I do not agree he has tried his best.
