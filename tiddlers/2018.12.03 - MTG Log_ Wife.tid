Played Turbofog the Pacifist deck against my wife using Goblins. Mull and on the play, green starved, and I made two mistakes that weren't punished. Otherwise, I rode on the back of my wife's mistakes. The goblin deck I built had several significant outs, and I could have been ported from turn 2 onwards. I explained the broad strokes after the game. It was a nailbiter for me the entire time.
