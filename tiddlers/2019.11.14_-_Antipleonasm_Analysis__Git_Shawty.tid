I adore the irony. I'll do you one better. Here you go: "antipleonasmify representation" or "sign short." That's the improved, generalized spirit of the law imperative<<ref "i">> which satisfies itself thoroughly. =)

Who doesn't like an elegant proof? When I can understand them (rarely), they make me cum in pants (or weep in despair...it's a range). It's one of the reasons I hate reading some arcane, wandering, muddy, grisly prototypes of the initial proofs (guiltiest of the guilty here); they are never said well enough. Hence, [[gopdarm]]. Of course, you can shorten some proofs until they become esoteric or obfuscated code. Yes, there is an aesthetic element in either direction, but there are [[right]] and clear directions, a narrowing and opening of [[salient]] windows which cannot be reduced to [[beauty]] alone. Of course, proofs are for someone toward something, and you have to make them longer for someone who can't make as many leaps with you as you might otherwise prefer.

Note, of course, this advice is what [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]] aims to do, including [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]. Analysis tends to be explosive in deconstruction; like viral mites, it tears apart the steel robots, drowning and consuming the whole in thoughtslime, piece by piece, until it has been sufficiently atomized. It is a leap in the belief that something better can be found. In our tick-tock computation of the dialectic, we must pick up the pieces and engineer it anew. Synthesizing many kinds of knowledge requires condensation, reconstructing something together in a more [efficient, tightly-coupled, or secure] manner per symbol. For each case, there are syntactic limits before you lose semantics, and so it can't be too short. It's especially important for not wasting someone's time. This is one of my favorite parts about the Analytic philosophy writing-style: it's incredibly clean, compact, and well-defined compared to many of the other options. The proofs are often gorgeous, and they build a body of authority which can't be replicated in any other fashion. Unfortunately, it still has qualiatic limits in which the encoding is unlikely or incapable of reaching sensibilities or being cognitively computed in a timely manner. More problematically, it causes that body-politik to be too risk-averse, confident, deflationary, and eventually biased [[irwrongfrr]] in ways that it may never solve on its own. Yes, compression and minimal sugar may still be king, but after you've decided that, you must define the hierarchy around it, and that often will require chancellors, shadowmasters, and field-workers dialectically opposite. It turns out that the slave in the dialectic will grow to be bigger and sometimes stronger than the master, and that includes brevity itself.

One of the things which the wiki has taught me is that length is sometimes the only possible answer in the desert, since there are some problems for which any answer is simply too short. There's a way in which all the wiki can do is attempt to describe the context of the problem, and proving the messy way you got there still matters (itself a kind of proof in many contexts as well). Further, there are certain kinds of problems which cannot be solved without increasing the amount of memory available on the tape, and this problem too never ends. If your goals are small or simple (and there is often nothing wrong with that), then your proofs can often be shorter. There is only so much time to groom before the ball. No matter who you are serving it to, improvisational rug-cutting is going to get ugly. Ambition sometimes requires sprinting and splattering, knowing it may never be cleaned up. Even the wise must now race as recklessly as the unwise in the material dialectic; it's the only viable strategic [[hope]]. I cannot claim to balance this correctly.

<<footnotes "i" "//Give short advice// is fine too, but I think this points to a much, much larger problem. Philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom, of prescription, of advice in all things (paradoxically again and again). ">>
