title: 2020.01.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Deceptive Gem

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
; Imperare sibi maximum imperium est.
: To rule yourself is the ultimate power.
<<<


Ultimate [[power]]-over even yourself (far more narrow than ultimate power) would not just be any kind of self-rule or self-legislation (autonomy). One can rule themselves to various [[dok]] without having maximal power over themselves, right? The sentence only works (as a semblance of itself) if I rewrite it as a logical truth, but all the interesting bits are the exceptions. 

I'll agree that [[Stoicism]] is profoundly concerned with understanding what is really up to us (though, I have never met a self-proclaimed stoic who I felt did so morally or thoroughly [especially with respect to what //was// up to them to help them understand what //is// still up to them]), and lining up the sights correctly is crucial //for// something outside ourselves. As usual, [[power]] [[gfwiwcgws]]?

From a Hegelian perspective, anything in my causal spiral-cone is a part of who I am to some extent, but not all of it can be up to what is most essential or what is even free about me. I'm not closer to bein able to answer this question either. This [[gem]] is deceptive. It seems to dissolve when I inspect it.
