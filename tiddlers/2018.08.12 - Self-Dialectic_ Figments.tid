title: 2018.08.12 - Self-Dialectic: Figments

Constructions are figments of our imaginations. It's clear to me that Neo-Kantians never escape the coherentist's problem, and relying upon at least a dash of externalism (or being enslaved to it) in the dialectic is the only way to find knowledge, to really have it.
