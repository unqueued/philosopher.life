title: 2018.08.27 - Deep Reading: Dune

Audiobooks require varying degrees of concentration. I know Dune very well (and I've heard this particular copy before), and there is a beautiful ease with which I can listen to this at 2x speed. It's literally more enjoyable faster, which is often not the case for audiobooks (I still turn the speed up simply because I want to get through my books). It has a fireside story kind of thing going on for me. I love it.

The last Keynes+Paul scene is so fucking cringeworthy. There aren't a ton of flaws to this book, btu this is one.

I do not understand the Hawat transfer in the end. It doesn't make sense to me.

I am fucking giddy at Stilgar's first meeting. It's so outstanding!
