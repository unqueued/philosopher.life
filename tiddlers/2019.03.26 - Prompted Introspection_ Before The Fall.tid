!! What about your work can you take pride in?

I work hard. My work is a material and memetic dialectical extension of my identity, and insofar as it is up to me, I think I generally do my best with what I have. I probably don't have much to show for it, but that's okay. I have to accept my limitations without The Slip into conveniently eliminating possibilities which I find unsavory.

I like that my work is about being moral even when it hurts. Moral motivations matters to me, and I think that fallibly shines in my work to those virtuous enough to know what virtue looks like in my context. I think my vocational work demonstrates that I'm generally a decent man.
