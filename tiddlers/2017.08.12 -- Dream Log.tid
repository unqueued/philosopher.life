title: 2017.08.12 -- Dream Log

I slept an absurd amount last night. I was so tired after work (even though it wasn't strenuous, it was emotionally very draining). 

When I sleep more than usual, I dream. Unfortunately, I didn't write it down immediately, and I don't remember what it was about. I know I dreamt a ton though, hours worth.

I tend not to dream when I don't get at least 7 hours of sleep, or at least, I tend not to have dreams that enable me to remember I dreamt them without having enough sleep. Half-brained sleep where I'm tense always seem to preclude having (or remembering) dreams.
