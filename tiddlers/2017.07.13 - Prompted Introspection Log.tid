!! What is a friend?

Aristotle couldn't define it, so why should I?<<ref "1">>

I have long wondered how to define friendship. I have no idea. I've read some on the topic, and I've got plenty of anecdotal evidence. Narrowing it down isn't easy. 

A friend empathizes with you, wants the best for you, and likes you, at least generally-speaking or consistently enough. Friendships come in degrees. Of course, to be called a friend in Germany might be a very high rank that is rarely achieved, and perhaps in the US, it could simply be a shallow acquaintance. In Thailand, it seemed that true friendships didn't generally exist from what I could tell. There are serious cultural considerations here.

My friends and I care about each other, want to see each other, sacrifice for each other, and tend to have at least some things in common. Maybe I am too restrictive in my friendships, or maybe I'm bad at making or keeping friends. I don't know. I will tell you, Samwise, that I am generally a lonely person. This wiki has enabled me to bear through that loneliness because, in a way, I've befriended myself on this wiki. That was a friendship worth having. I learned that lesson too late in life.
