"""
[9:49 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Have a great day! Work and outlining on my end. What about you?
[10:48 AM]  h0p3: Noice. Outlining is difficult for me to do. I'm afraid I'm too messy to do it well in many cases.
[10:49 AM]  h0p3: Do you outline and keep filling in the outlines?
[10:49 AM]  h0p3: I'm about to dive into the day. Redrafting with my offspring on our papers on the first chapter of [[The Lightning Thief]]. Trying to do this methodical close reading approach with them (and make it fun), and trying to get them write. [[h0p3ful Review]]s of their daily wikis, tutoring. We're watching 3B1B's essence of linear algebra series, and may continue going down that rabbithole with other resources eventually.
[10:51 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Basically yeah. I put down whatever is floating around in my mind for the day, then go straight to my synopsis to create a timeline moving onward into the work. Once I have more Info to fit into the different components of the outline, I continue filling it out and tweak when necessary.
[10:52 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: That all sounds wonderful. :slight_smile:
[10:52 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’ve never read PJ. Did they like the book?
[10:57 AM]  h0p3: We're only one chapter in! Lol. [[1uxb0x]] has read it before, but his memory is not strong (it is one of the reasons I insist on him writing so much). But [[j3d1h]] and I haven't. I know a lot of people suggest reading it cover to cover and then combing through. Instead, we're opening with a close reading, walking step-by-step, in part, to try and figure out how to be a reliable indicator of what is salient with a few clues as possible. It's agonizingly slow for [[j3d1h]], but I want her to see what she can spot when she chooses to slow down and digest.
[10:59 AM]  h0p3: The next chapter, I'm thinking I'm going to show them how to use the internet to write the same kind of answer, even if it isn't earned in the same way. It helps to quickly sort through other people's thoughts and pick out what matters there too.
[11:01 AM]  h0p3: Having fun teaching them to write to and for themselves and their teacher ([[k0sh3k]] is our teacher, we are all her student in this assignment).
[11:03 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Poor [[j3d1h]] hahaha.
[11:03 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: It’s fine. These skills are necessary to survive denser books.
[11:03 AM]  h0p3: Lol, yeah, it's true. At least she enjoys the discussions.
[11:03 AM]  h0p3: True dat.
[11:04 AM]  h0p3: I wonder if you will end up drawing out elaborate storyboards, with the pins and the strings (or however best it is done).
[11:04 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: The ramblings of a mad man hahaha
[11:04 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Never say never! :wink:
[11:06 AM]  h0p3: I know you guys don't have a ton of money to just throw around. A whiteboard or a chalkboard might be worthy. For some reason, it feels different than writing on paper for me. Maybe every person has their mediums of choice for a particular situation, like it maps onto one with just the right fit.
[11:07 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Actually that reminds me.... we’re likely going to finish paying our car off next month much earlier than expected.
[11:07 AM]  h0p3: Fuck yeah, dude.
[11:07 AM]  h0p3: Right on.
[11:07 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I would love a big whiteboard hahaha
[11:07 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: It’s exciting.
