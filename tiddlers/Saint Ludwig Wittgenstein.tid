# The world is all that is the case.
# What is the case—a fact—is the existence of states of affairs.
# A logical picture of facts is a thought.
# A thought is a proposition with sense.
# A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions.
#* An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself.
# The general form of a truth-function is [p¯,ξ¯,N(ξ¯)]
#* This is the general form of a proposition.
# What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.

A picture cannot depict its own pictorial form.

Any proposition “is the result of successive applications” of logical operations to elementary propositions. Wait! Godel may save me still!

The book will … draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts …. The limit can … only be drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense.

Yet, I "sense" there is something outside that limit. Call it faith if you must.
