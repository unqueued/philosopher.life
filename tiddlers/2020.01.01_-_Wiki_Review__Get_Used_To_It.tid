title: 2020.01.01 - Wiki Review: Get Used To It

* [[2019.12.31 - Prompted Introspection: Thankful]]
** We're at the point where the years are rolling by so fast that I'm never going to "get used to" their age, or so it seems. I need to find a way to get to used to it. Does no good for them for me to be trapped into thinking they are an age (or a maturity) which isn't accurate.
*** I can't even recall the last time we had a motel room together (if ever?). [[j3d1h]] wanted to go talk with friends on her phone, and I'm like: "hey, you have a room key, go wander outside and come back when you want to." Completely weird for both of us.

** That's not what a doctor wants to do. I'm a number in a quota for their (or their boss') bottom-line. Process me, make me feel like I've been heard just enough to check the boxes, and get me the fuck out of there...right?
** Will probably save the knife for when I can send him the check as well. It's such a hefty knife. I'm not sure what he'd use it for. It's not a pocket-knife like the one made for me. Did I just make an ornament for him? =( Ugh.

** We did what we could with what we had. The pipes turned out to be a clusterfuck.

** There's simply too many dots to connect in the wiki. Reminds me of the hypergraphic authors. Even if it is only a searchable pile, I'll have done what I need.

** Words I've said elsewhere in the wiki which I'm bound to repeat and package up for another particular.
