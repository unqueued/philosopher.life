title: 2019.01.10 - Afterschool Teaching: The Boys

Matt was late today. I had most of it setup. We talked about is schooling and about the prospects for me. I don't think he has a clue who he's talking to, and that's okay. It's my privilege to help him.

We discovered we don't have enough food for the week most likely. We'll do what we can. None of the kids are missing meals from what I can tell. 

I can tell I've been given the problematic crowd in the 5th graders. I have much better behavioral performance from the older kids. The teachers also point to my 5th grade boys and point out what I see too. I wonder if I will be receiving any pushback when I start doing my seminar/courses (if I really get the chance).<<ref "d">> It's interesting to see that Whitney is handed only a couple kids compared to Matt and me.

I'm beginning to have a gameplan since it's obvious that Matt doesn't actually have one (and I'm able to start taking license). I'm took my students early to the classroom to work on homework. Vice Principal Mitchell took my girls for homework, and I focused on herding the boys. 

5LL continues to be a little shit, but I'm not backing down. We continue to work on his homework and fractions, and I'm not believin his lies. The amount of lies that come out of the mouths of these children blows me away. I'm not in a position to call them out like Mitchell either; he knows what they are actually doing in class and I don't.

5NP is a complete asshole. I am lucky he's not my son. The amount of asswhoopin' would be epic (and my son already tests my patience into oblivion). Delp had another talk with him.

6CM just sits there quietly. I only have to tell her to keep her volume down. I get to joke with her about it, and I hope she is recognizing that I'm cutting her slack. That probably isn't the case. She is one of the rougher kids, but we haven't had a serious problem. I know that 7Jm is her best friend in the program, and we seem to get along. I treat them respectfully, and I hope to see it reciprocated.

6DM and I are getting along. I still have to call him down (he's noisy), but he is smart in several respects (even though he claims he cannot read). I'm actually befriending him. 

Drawing, puzzles, or reading. Those the current timewasters that I have. I suppose I could start building something else for them to engage in. The problem is that most of these kids just have to be restrained the entire fucking time (I get it: you've been in prison all day). Getting them to just not be disruptive to the other students who are doing their work takes us to our limits. The insanity in these children is absurd. Of course, I require willing students more than most. This is part of why I fail ~30% of my students in university settings too. Even the dumb kids can pass my class if they are going to try (I annoy smart kids by how slowly I climb the mountain with the class, but I do not wish to leave anyone behind who is a willing student [maximin principle is IN EFFECT]).

5LL and I just sat in the computer lab. He talks a lot of shit, but we eventually get there. I can really feeel the difference in parenting here among these chillun. 

I can see one of my goals is to find a better job by the summer, a testing grounds. This is better than nothing, and I feel like I'm not doing something immoral. That is hard to find for me. 

This job is a reminder that I am (to some [[dok]]) a slave. It is immoral that I not paid a living wage. I really fucking hate people in general. =(
