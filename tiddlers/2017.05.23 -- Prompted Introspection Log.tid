!! Define the word "Boundary," or freewrite on it.

What is a boundary? What is boundariness?

A boundary demarcates an entity from its surroundings. A boundary is the first point beyond which it is not possible to find any part of the entity. I suppose entity here could be anything. We could be talking about physical or metaphysical objects. In a way, one must define the entity or object in order to define its boundaries, and likely vice versa. I suppose boundaries require contexts with dimensions. One must have something outside an object in order to have boundaries to it. 

Take reality itself. Are there boundaries to it? It makes no sense to talk about something outside of reality at first glance. Maybe we want to talk about possible worlds, counterfactuals, falsities, or other kinds of non-being objects. Insofar as they can be talked about, insofar as there is a being of non-being, we must say they are sort of part of reality. Hence, there is a sense in which reality does not have a boundary. But, there seem to be limits to reality. Maybe we must say that non-reality is what is outside of reality. I don't know what it means to say that. 

We're near the root of ontology here. I fear I cannot give any satisfactory answer. To provide one would be equivalent to solving a host of incredibly complex and ancient problems. This is fundamental to providing a true philosophical Theory of Everything.

There are many aspects, kinds, and perhaps degrees of boundaries. Boundaries aren't always clean. They can be blurry and fuzzy, or sharp and perspicuous. Perhaps boundaries can be thick or thin. Maybe boundaries are bound to particular objects but not others, but I don't see how that is possible. If there is a boundary between X and Y, does it belong to both, to just one, or is it separate? Maybe there are multiple boundaries at play here. Admittedly, there may be boundaries which separate two objects which are distinct from how objects may continuously flow into each other as each others boundaries. That is odd.

Boundaries of space+time are easy to conceive of in an intuitive sense (up until we hit the weirdness of quantum theory, relativity, and beyond [I suppose that's a boundary too :P]). Boundaries of ideas, abstractions, or metaphysical objects are less easy to see, but still fairly obvious to me. 

Some boundaries seem more objective and others more subjective. The determinacy of boundaries seems very difficult, to say the least. I worry that we oscillate between an arbitrariness and a pragmatic certainty of boundariness. There seem to be a host of postmodern and metamodern considerations here.

Do boundaries grant any sorts of privileges to objects in ontology? Are some boundaries "stronger" than others? Is there a hierarchy? What is the boundary of a boundary? It does seem like there are no boundaries without things to be bound by them. They seem parasitic in this respect. 

What are the relationships between objects and their boundaries? Boundaries might commonly be thought of as having a lower-dimension than the object they bound. But, in a way, I see boundaries as pointing to a "space" larger than the object by definition. Thus, here is my best definition:

<<<
Boundaries bind and distinguish objects relative to other objects.
