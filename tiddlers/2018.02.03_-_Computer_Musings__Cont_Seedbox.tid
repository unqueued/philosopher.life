Still working on it.

I'm annoyed by the complexity of systemd, but I can see its value:

I'm relying heavily upon google translate because I find more Chinese expertise with this tool than any other.

I wasted an enormous amount of time trying to get rutorrent to work nicely through both lighttpd and nginx. I simply couldn't do it. I've done it several times before, but it didn't work today. That's okay. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

I thought I almost bricked too. Hard restart worked though. Few pacmans got it back up.

I've asked stackoverflow about the shadowsocks problem. No bites so far. I've now asked the Tor IRC about it.

Also, no socks proxy on soulseekqt?

Decided to dig into zstd. I've never used it. Thought it was cool. Made a script for backing up home. I want to go back to using Resilio sync for this, and I think storing it all in a single archive will cut down on Resilio sync's work. Even if it doesn't, compression will be valuable; I want to store it on my seedbox.

Nice! It fucking crushes my HDD. IO will always be the bottleneck. I just checked iotop. I wish there was a way to abuse memory more effectively. I want to try buffering tar somehow because I think there is possibly more performance to be had (but I could be wrong). Block size might matter too, I don't know.
