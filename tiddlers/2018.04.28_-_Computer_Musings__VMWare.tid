title: 2018.04.28 - Computer Musings: VMWare

VMWare network wasn't working. No idea why not.

`sudo systemctl start vmware-networks && sudo systemctl enable vmware-networks`

Guess I had to do it manually (first time for everything; Manjaro is weird about virtualization). This is also a possible method:

`sudo /usr/bin/modprobe vmnet && sudo vmware-networks --start`

I picked up a W7 Lite iso. I now have a stripped XP and 7 that I legitimately like. They are very tight.

Turns out, PoE runs like absolute shit inside VMWare. I tuned it all as best I could. I'm at the limits of what I can do here. Too bad, so sad.
