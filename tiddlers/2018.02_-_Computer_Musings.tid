!! Audit:

* Tor ended up being useless in this case. When I need it, I just use it from my house. Although, I do think I should VPN to mask it. I'm all too often lazy about it. I believe this is why I've found my router hacked thrice, it generally coincides with that usage. 
* Deluge took a while to fix. I'm still tweaking it to what I want. Recall, of course, that my last installation using ruTorrent lasted for years. I barely touched it after I got it the way I liked it. I'll get there with this as well.
* Never did that OpenWRT router to do everything I wanted it to do...the Virtualized approach also failed. That's okay.
* I received 3 thanks you's from extended family for the proxy/vpns.
* vpncloud.rs has been half successful. I love that it is a nat-piercer.
* The RPi is now functioning. I love it.
* I've got SSHFS doing what I need it to do.
* I've not needed my VMs. I use them when I do, but otherwise don't need them. I need to think about that more.
* I still want to get my phone functioning in a way that I love. I have most of my devices setup very well. 
* That ghetto hack on ATL's compression is beautiful. I can feel the difference.
* I'm disappointed that I didn't solve the Deluge problem faster and more efficiently. Pointless desert wandering that I could have avoided if I were smart about it.
* I've been contacting devs more often about their software. I'm glad I have. My opinions matter.
* I've annoyed many people with my shreddit. Tough.<<ref "2019.03.26">>
* I have less I need to accomplish on the computers. I think we are set for a while. I'm glad. Much of our system has been overhauled and tweaked.
* Good computing, sir.
