We have family time every night.<<ref "1">> On Sundays, we have a family meeting. Our family meetings, which this log attempts to ensure we've done at least the basics, is supposed to be more than that just family time. It's a ritual of reflecting together. I consider it a Secularized Sabbath tradition. Even though I don't practice religion or spirituality, there was a wildly successful method to the madness of that memetic tradition which I seek to secularly imitate and enrich.

!! Principles:

This log serves many roles. It takes a constant pulse of our family. It is a time to ask constructive questions and find ways to bond with each other. It's a way to socialize and participate in more meaningful family life together. 

We take our family meetings very seriously. They are important to us. It's part of how we get to know each other, and it's part of collectively working towards our mutual familial happiness.

Sometimes these meetings are cheerful and easy, and other times they are emotionally draining and time consuming. Listening to each other and being steadfast, kind, empathic, and wise through these oscillations demonstrates our commitment to each other. That is essential to our love.
