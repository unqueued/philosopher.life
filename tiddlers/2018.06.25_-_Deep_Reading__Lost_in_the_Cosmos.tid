title: 2018.06.25 - Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos

I read a book in grad school called Teleosemantics, a book essentially worried about the problem of other minds, goal-directed behavior, p-zombies, functionalist and behavioralist perspectives. My worry about Percy's model is that he hasn't talked about this crucial issue effectively enough. He glosses over some serious philosophical issues, even when he brings us right to the doorstep to ask the right questions. That's kind of weird. I'm only partway through, so perhaps he is getting to it.
