title: 2019.01.18 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Herd Immunity

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Decentralization of power is like herd immunity against assholes.

Preach, yo! What is the memetic virus that infects the brains of people to turn them into assholes? I have called it the [[Rand|Ayn Rand]]-Locke Memeplex and dark-triadicism. [[The Original Position]] is a form of consensus building regarding the ever-evolving conception of [[The Good]] and [[The Right]] in our contexts. 

I'm fully willing to grant that intention and moral motivation are complex enough that appearances alone are flawed (even if that is all we have to work with), and therefore judgment must be hedged.

This is a memetic outbreak, and unfortunately, only we can collectively act as the CDC. I am worried that Marx never quite appreciated ideology enough given his lack of metaethics and metaphysics (despite his [[realpolitik]] approach). He is talking about decentralizing power though. Forget his math; the principle is correct.

This is one of the oddities of speaking with [[GB]] who knows my, uh, original position on [[The Original Position]] even before Song. Sensen and Brower learned me otherwise. Yeah, there is something right about it. [[GB]] has a Humean skepticism, and I can appreciate that. He does appreciate the dialectic though, and I highly respect that.

Call it the paradox of tolerance, the [[fff]] cannot escape having an ingroup and outgroup in dialectics. The Lottery Paradox alone will give rise to logical inconsistency within perfectly rational finite creatures in games of imperfect information. It's a conceptual truth that only [[The Infinite]] could possibly answer. We are doomed into resolving opposition, and we are doomed to opposition to some [[dok]]. We can quite beautifully and pleasantly enable arenas for compatibilizing through friction. This is one of the goals of decentralization. 

Herd immunity is an emergent property of collective action.
