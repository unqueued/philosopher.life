title: 2017.06.17 -- Pipefitting Log

I put the finishing touches on my pipefitting resume. 

I applied to the Pipefitter and Pipefitter Helper positions at Jacobs. I'm definitely qualified for one, and I'm on the edge really of being qualified for the other. I think it would take very little time to train me into a full blown pipefitter. I already can do large swathes of job well enough. We will see.
