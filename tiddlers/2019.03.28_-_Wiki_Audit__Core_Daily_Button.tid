title: 2019.03.28 - Wiki Audit: Core Daily Button

* [[Core Daily Requirement Macros]]
* [[Audit Macros]]
* [[Audit Date]]

For the Core Daily button, it makes new logs for any log tagged `Core Daily Requirement`, so new ones (if those ever happen) should be fine. Templates work, but aren't required. If there is a template, make sure its name follows the form `TDL: Template`, and if there isn't one, the log's body will remain blank. The form is this:

```
title: 2019.03.28 - TDL: 
tags: TDL

[whatever is in the template here]
```

Quick warning, pressing that button WILL overwrite any existing Core Daily Requirement logs for the day, unless they have a title.Title. Careful with that.

Sync killed. Hunting Bob gremlins. [[m10]] just saw the problem that I think I experienced on [[monster-14]] between two tabs. Bob normally kicks up a redflag, but this never happened. [[Recent]] was completely desynced between the tabs.

[[@]] is a thing now.
