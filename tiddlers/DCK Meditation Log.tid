title: DCK Meditation Log

Dissociatives, like ketamine and its analogues, are incredibly potent substances. The phenomenology of it is very hard to describe.<<ref "1">> I'm sure it varies considerably on an individual basis as well. There are 4 serious drugs I've used with consistency (although, I've tried more): alcohol, cannabis, psilocybin, and deschloroketamine (DCK), in that order. Hallucinogens are derealizing (appearances are deceiving), but dissociatives take it to another level via depersonalization. I much prefer to be myself, but I also don't like who I am at times. So, at times, I want to be someone else. I need to change into a different person. DCK relieves my depression, and that's why I use it. It also activates and expands one's consciousness and awareness.<<ref "2">>

To be clear, DCK is not a pleasant experience for me. It is very difficult. I wrestle on this substance. I also use that time to explore, to empathize, and to meditate. Normally we think of meditation as being quite tranquil. Wrestle-meditation is what I do though.  It's not easy, and it's probably not for everyone. If there were tranquil ways to tame the beast(s) inside me, I'd use those. Unfortunately, it's the path that seems to work for me (as we've seen time and time again). I take a 20mg dose once a week. When I don't, my week doesn't go as well. If I fail to take it for long periods of time, I spiral back into depression.

The goal is to fix the problems I have while on DCK so that I can eventually just emerge permanently (hopefully) from depression. I leave lots of breadcrumbs on this wiki for myself, signals, and ways to help myself determine my mental status. The difference with DCK is clear not just phenomenologically, but blatantly so on this wiki. I can see it. My family does too. That's who I'm working for. I choose to be enslaved to my loved ones.

In any case, I need a place to write down my unedited drug-addled thoughts. I admit, like too much of my writing, it's chicken scratch (absurdly so in this case). But, that's the nature of journaling on dissociatives. I've been an accomplished typist for a very long time (despite the number of errors on this wiki); it's second nature to me (virtue theoretic, even). However, even on the small dose of DCK I take, I can barely remember how to even type. They aren't even my hands anymore. Perhaps these are the words of a madman. Perhaps they are absurd. I will consider them carefully, nonetheless. After all, something about DCK seems to be working.

It's important to talk to myself, even the dissociated part (perhaps exceptionally so). Remember: be empathic!
