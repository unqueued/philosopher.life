title: 2018.03.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: Pollution

!! What do you think someone your age can do to help reduce the amount of pollution in our environment?

There are many varieties of pollution, and the causality of The Stack is immense. It's difficult to know exactly where one can be effective. Obviously, not being wasteful in general is a good start. Reusing, repairing, and becoming a good steward of what is around you helps. The DIY mentality doesn't always pay off though; there are some people who have competitive advantages in being clean. There are concessions to make all around us, giving up conveniences are worthy in many respects.

It's not clear that recycling is actually worthwhile in a large number of cases. For a long time, solar energy wasn't actually worthwhile either (worth in terms of pollutionary cost, not monetary). We need massive investments in these sectors, but we also need to be realistic about the positive consequences they actually generate.

I love the idea of taxing beef and other voluntary high-pollution issues. I wouldn't get to eat beef very often (if at all), but I'm okay with that. 

Furthermore, I don't have a problem with landfills or nuclear power. I don't see good arguments against them. 

I think we have to come up with ways to solve the tragedy of the commons that is our ocean and atmosphere. Political and economic pressures right now should be focused on other things though. Right now, I think those in power are the ones who have the power to actually do anything systematic about pollution. 

Without socialist intervention/revolution, there's no way our species (or many others) is going to survive the coming mass extinction. It's not just about reducing pollution, it's about creating the right kind of social fabric and political systems that enable us to have the right incentives and power structures to solve a clusterfuck of crises, only one of which includes pollution.

What can I do personally? I'm writing and thinking about it. I don't know how to be effective. I'm searching for it.
