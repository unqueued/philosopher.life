!! Audit:

* You should, homie.
* This has been where I develop {[[Vault]]}.
** Updated.
* I'm disappointed by my fading memory. =(
** Hovering between tip of tongue to drawing complete blanks.
* This project feels more ballsout philosophically, and it's also rougher around the edges.
* There is some serious pain in here!
** I'm really glad I do it though. I'm grateful to have the chance.
* I don't like Lady Melisandre's questions anymore. She's somehow more annoying than Samwise to me!
* This log felt plain (even with the pain). It wasn't on fire, but it certainly wasn't bad.
** I'm totally fine with that. Lots of logs have a flatness with sparkles that pop once in a while. 
** That pain can be plain is not a bad thing. Grief sucks.
