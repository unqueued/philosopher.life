!! About:

//I love you all.//

<<<
Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

-- Leo Tolstoy, //Anna Karenina//
<<<

<<<
Few men have been admired by their own households. 

-- Michel de Montaigne, //Book III, Ch. 2//
<<<

My family is perhaps my life's greatest sub-project.<<ref "1">> Obviously, my family's development and happiness is not something I should leave to chance. I am committed to these homo sapiens. They are my tribiest tribe,<<ref "2">> and the Otheriest of [[The Others|Find the Others]] to me. Here I hope to develop and apply habits of flourishing immediate family tribes.

This log serves many roles. It takes a constant pulse of our family. We need to monitor it, take the minutes of our lives, reflect, celebrate, and address problems in a timely and wise fashion. It also forcibly creates a time and space for us to ask constructive questions and find ways to bond with each other. It's a way to socialize and participate in more meaningful family life together. 

We have family time every night.<<ref "3">> On Sundays, we have a family meeting. Our family meetings generally take many hours, and this log is simply one accountability-holding part of our process. This is a ritual of reflecting together.<<ref "4">> It's part of how we get to know each other, and it's part of collectively working towards our mutual familial happiness.

Sometimes these meetings are cheerful and easy, and other times they are emotionally draining and time consuming. We must listen to each other. Being steadfastly kind, empathic, and wise through these oscillations demonstrates our commitment to each other.

*** I'm pleased to see you are morally polite in how you build friendships. I hope you will also consider integrating your friends into your digital life (seriously, they should have your contact information).
** j3d1h
*** Nobody in the family understands what you've done for them with git except me. I want to thank you on behalf of everyone else for your work. Also, your scripting of the retroactive work was kickass. You built something real. Good job.
** k0sh3k
*** It's obvious you take your religious vocation more seriously than the rest of your group. You've really had to push for anything to happen. I'm glad you had the gumption and persistence to get what you needed. I hope my our children are quietly taking notes and thinking about how you've been working towards your goal.

!! Dreams:

* Daily Family Logs could be useful. We naturally do it to some extent, but formalizing it may be useful.
** [[Daily Family Log Template]]

* By-laws?

* There seem to be lots of frameworks to approach this problem. How much of it should be organic?

<<footnotes "1" "My hesitation here is one of philosophical doubt. Instrumentality and intrinsic value relationships are still not well-established enough for me to give strong answers. I have seen Aristotle wrestle this problem beautifully, and I know there is much I do not understand.">>

<<footnotes "2" "Deontic weighing constraints with other tribes, such as the Cosmopolitian Tribe, are not resolved here. I must be philosophically practical here. I can admit doubt, but still take the best paths available to me.">>

<<footnotes "3" "Even when I'm traveling, I contact each member of my family daily. I want to be there for them, whether physically in person or otherwise.">>

<<footnotes "4" "I consider it a Secularized Sabbath tradition. Even though I don't practice religion or spirituality, there was a wildly successful method to the madness of that memetic tradition which I seek to secularly imitate and enrich.">>
