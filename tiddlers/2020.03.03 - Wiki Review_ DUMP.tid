title: 2020.03.03 - Wiki Review: DUMP

* [[2020.03.02 - Wiki Review: Ditto]]
** No, everyone wants to stay in. Naturally inclined to quarantine? We are the Hikkis.
* [[2020.03.02 - TDL: Audit]]
** You did a fine job. Congratz.
* [[2020.03.02 - Prompted Introspection: Old Hands]]
** Edited. Anxiety rises at the thought of Biden winning to lose to Trump.
* [[2020.03.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Late]]
** Completed. I wonder if I will see her again. It's so busy around here. I might not.
* [[2020.03.02 - h0p3ful Review: Huge Elemental Universes]]
** It is one of the greater reliefs to have with my offspring: justified freetime.
* [[2020.02.04 - L: Being A Parent]]
** If and when they do, I hope they go for adoption. Lots of groundwork for them to lay no matter what.
* [[2020.02.10 - L: Remote For People]]
** I wonder if she has found useful meds for anxiety and sleeping.
* [[2020.02.16 - L: Typing!]]
** My assumption is that she doesn't use her laptop much. That's surprising to me.
* [[2020.02.17 - L: Losing Character]]
** I've lost a character in DnD. It's not so bad if you come prepared to roll another one on the spot.
* [[2020.02.24 - L: Translator]]
** Go, go, go! You can do it!!
* [[2020.02.28 - L: Good Days]]
** It's probably going to be bad for quite a while in the search. 
* [[2020.02.03 - chameleon: Powerword]]
** It's so rare that I get to share my offline information with anyone online. It's a special day for me. 
* [[2020.02.06 - chameleon: P2P Forums]]
** Super cool. I hope my offspring will look and think about it as well. 
* [[2020.02.14 - chameleon: Health]]
** A lot of people got sick at the same time. =/
** I wonder if she likes making bots.
* [[2020.02.16 - chameleon: MTG]]
** I don't know what would go on my pillow. Hers is elegant. I think mine would be completely pornographic. 
* [[2020.02.21 - chameleon: Software]]
** The Japanese P2P apps are not my favorite. They are interesting though.
* [[2020.02.23 - chameleon: Gaming For Fun]]
** I don't think anyone has ever hugged me after an MTG game. Maybe my kids? 
*** That's cool. I like when people can do that with the game. It can often be so intense.
* [[2020.02.26 - chameleon: Freely Sharing]]
** Maybe we should connect more on [[Zizek]]. Dude is cool AF.
* [[2020.02.27 - chameleon: VC]]
** We should VC more. I've been so fucking exhausted with my offspring.
* [[2020.02.29 - chameleon: Rorschachness]]
** I feel like all of us aren't able to express what going on inside well enough. 
** Rorschach is an interesting character to me. Perhaps we should think about it more.
* [[2020.02.05 - Sphygmus: Jasper]]
** I have no idea how things would go with [[Sho]] and [[Sphygmus]]. I think they would get a long really well though. They are such different people, lol, but they share plenty in common. They both care about nature deeply.
* [[2020.02.06 - Sphygmus: When In Roam]]
** Reminds me of a link that [[GR6A]] had which suggested 4,000 notes was the minimum for a "life"-size wiki/zett.
* [[2020.02.08 - Sphygmus: DMV & Hax]]
** She caught me right at the DMV too. Made me smile.
** This seems to be related to the next. 
* [[2020.02.11 - Sphygmus: Placeness]]
** I made the change to match her wiki here. Sanitizer is all set. 
** They still have time on the lease. There's a lot to think about there.
* [[2020.02.16 - Sphygmus: Hardmods]]
** My assumption is that this might get even rarer over the coming decades.
* [[2020.02.28 - Sphygmus: Gift of Perspective & Advice]]
** I am grateful to hear her advice here. I don't have a lot of people who I trust in this sphere, let alone who have the knowledge to see clearly.
* [[2020.02.19 - dziggetai: Ultimate Boss Fight]]
** I've seen him pop on and off Discord. I'm glad to be able to speak with him.
* [[2020.02.22 - dziggetai: Pragmatic Metaethics]]
** I was surprised. There are moves here which are different than I had predicted. Cool. 
* [[2020.02.28 - K: Allergies]]
** Grad school is going to be different for him. It's a different kind of degree too. He's got this.
* [[2020.02.04 - K: Non-Stop Drainage]]
** We have similar problems. His sound more difficult. Must feel like a whirlwind for him.
* [[2020.02.06 - K: Tiddlywiki]]
** I am always surprised he doesn't dive in. Seems so well-suited to all of his hobbies and passions.
* [[2020.02.12 - K: KILLER combo]]
** Hrm. I am surprised he's not interested in the relationship between DMing and teaching. Seems like it would be worth exploration. I must be missing something.
* [[2020.02.13 - K: Raiding]]
** I wonder if his PCs will become his primary devices in the end.
* [[2020.02.17 - K: Sertraline]]
** He's much wiser at that age than I was (he also has way more support).
* [[2020.02.25 - K: Mind Altering Substances]]
** Good hunting, sir. Hard fucking place to be. Super important to resolve as much as possible before you jump into teaching. That's gonna be a leap.
* [[2020.02.26 - K: Ramblings Of A Madman]]
** I obviously do not understand enough about the way he builds stories for his manuscript or DnD.
* [[2020.02.28 - K: Vapelyfe]]
** My approach would be too formulaic, I take it.
* [[2020.03.02 - K: Games Worth Playing]]
** Hrm. I hope he will find other ways to connect with his brother.
* [[2020.01.31 - AA: Axe-Throwing]]
** That is a fun birthday. I'm glad they had a good time.
* [[2020.02.10 - AA: Quasi-Emptynesting]]
** It's so weird to see 20 years pass that fast. It may pass that quickly for [[AG]] too. 
*** Hard to fathom even my own offspring driving soon.
* [[2020.03.02 - AA: Links]]
** Somehow it is cool to be accidentally cool.
*** Deep, yo.
* [[2020.02.16 - AA: Learning To Drive]]
** I feel that pain. 
** You know, the next time I see [[AG]], she's gonna be driving. I need to update my models. 
*** Where are my brix and beep boops at?
* [[2020.02.23 - AA: Dancing The Dance]]
** Fuck. =(. I was hoping that there wasn't going to be a pit. That's a hard one.
*** I hope to be as aware and cognizant of such things in my own life as she is. 
* [[2020.02.29 - AA: Signaling Wisdom]]
** I am, of course, a blind man. I'm lucky to hear her reasoning.
* [[2020.03.02 - T-Money: How's Your Week Going?]]
** Oh shit, and this job he is applying for is on call (though I don't know if it's 24/7). 
*** The LLC makes good sense too. Multiple pans in the fire. You go, sir. 
* [[2020.02.04 - T-Money: Another House]]
** I admire that even though there's some deep trouble somewhere (I can't pick out well enough), he's willing to be flexible. He's had thoughts about just giving up on his family, and he's fighting to be there. 
*** I hate that so many events are not up to him here. =(
* [[2020.02.13 - T-Money: Sleepover]]
** In that area, I can imagine the impact of such things can last for generations sometimes.
* [[2020.02.16 - T-Money: Passing It On]]
** He would be a hilarious uncle or grandpa to have. I don't know if he would be a good one in some important respects. I hope he will be.
* [[2020.02.23 - T-Money: Healthcare]]
** It annoys me to hear people disparage their educations. He's purposely avoiding the political causes of his problems.
* [[2020.02.28 - T-Money: Honest Work]]
** I have no idea how much he means it. Could just be a friendly caveat. 
*** I'm hoping he can step out of it and then fully recognize what it is.
* [[2020.02.04 - JRE: Furlough]]
** It's interesting to see that it's taken a month to get the ball rolling. I'm grateful to him.
* [[2020.02.09 - JRE: Being A Dad]]
** I hope it gets rapidly easier for him.
* [[2020.02.11 - JRE: Linerider Chat]]
** This is surprisingly long. My brother rarely chats this far while msging. 
*** We've generally been phone-talkers together.
** My brother makes me laugh out loud when I read his jokes sometimes. I can see his face and hear his sound in my imagination.
* [[2020.02.14 - JRE: Tending To Two]]
** I don't think he was having a great couple days there. =/
* [[2020.02.20 - JRE: Health]]
** Nor here. Lots of illness.
* [[2020.02.24 - JRE: Rigs]]
** Having trouble connecting with this fellow, and I'm not convinced my daughter is so interested in it. She doesn't have to if she doesn't want to. 
* [[2019.12.25 - DeathOfRobinhood: X-Mas Poem]]
** Helluva a poem.
* [[2020.01.13 - DeathOfRobinhood: Same Pale Moon]]
** That was not a great week for me. I'm glad to have heard from him.
* [[2020.01.31 - DeathOfRobinhood: Chill Companions]]
** Izzy was cute. It's interesting to see how [[DeathOfRobinhood]]'s friendships exist (of what little I understand). I don't know many friends that share a dog.
* [[2020.02.28 - DeathOfRobinhood: Calling]]
** He didn't have to call. I'm glad he did. 
* [[2020.01.29 - Sho: Angel]]
** She often has to retell her story. Might help her. I don't know. 
* [[2020.02.08 - Sho: Jorvik]]
** I'm scared fro them. I don't know what they should do, but it seems like moving out the UK is best.
*** [[chameleon]] thought so too (and has far more knowledge of the crisis). 
* [[2020.02.17 - Sho: Bursting]]
** I am very good at making and keeping friends. I don't enjoy disagreeing here. It's crucial that I interject here though. 
* [[2020.02.25 - Sho: Weird One]]
** FB and Kitty Kat. Sounds like my wife.
*** The addiction was too strong. I wonder if she will ever leave it for good. I don't think so. I hope she finds justified eudaimonia in it.
* [[2020.01.29 - gh057: Missing you.]]
** There's little to talk about. It's so much easier when we are in person, with beer, food, music.
* [[2020.02.02 - gh057: Still Lookin']]
** I'm pretty concerned he won't escape.
* [[2020.02.10 - gh057: Floods]]
** I don't know how to explain the remoteness I feel here. It's not new to me, but it's still striking.
* [[2020.02.16 - gh057: Cars & Women]]
** There's something missing to my picture. Why doesn't the landlord do it?
* [[2020.02.23 - gh057: Illness]]
** That man cannot afford to get sick. His son can't either.
* [[2020.02.28 - gh057: Getting Better]]
** It was so great to have someone brighten up my day at the school too. I had no one else I could talk with so openly. 
*** I was born to be a janitor.
* [[2020.02.04 - Tasha: Feeling Sick]]
** She's becoming more difficult to reach. I don't know why. I hope she is doing well. Lots of illness and change.
* [[2020.02.08 - Tasha: Hangin']]
** Interestingly, we aren't officially out of probation for several weeks, and the three mark is the clincher.
* [[2020.02.13 - Tasha: Crazy Time]]
** I don't know if her job is going to get better. It's wildly saner than the last one, thankfully. 
* [[2020.02.17 - Tasha: Opportunity]]
** I am surprised by Esteban. What does he see?
* [[2020.02.02 - GB: Checkin]]
** I suppose he's doing alright.
* [[Prompted Introspection: Library of Prompts]]
** Slowly, we grind! 
** I'm so fucking excited by this. I might slam through it, but I'm enjoying savoring it. It is rare that I have any input here.
