title: 2018.05.29 -- Computer Musings: ni hao

I receive a lot of phone spam. There are a handful of ways to improve it, but not many. This is fixable, if we wanted. It won't be fixed.

I just received the oddest spam phone calls. A bot continued to chant, "ni hao..." followed by Chinese I don't know. I'm not going to find out what it said. Looks like a scam to me.
