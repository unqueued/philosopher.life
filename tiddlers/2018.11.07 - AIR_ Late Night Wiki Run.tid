We talked until about 1:30am. My brother is going to try to find a new job. Cool! I understand why he hates his boss(es); he has a good reason. 

I VNCed into his machine and gave a quick tutorial on the wiki again. He's getting it. I hope he will practice not just the wiki but also using XFCE. An hour a day would go a long way for him.
