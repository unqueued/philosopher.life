title: 2019.09.06 - Prompted Introspection: The Greatest of My Achievements

!! What do you consider your greatest achievement?

This question is going to have to stay (I'm halfway through ;P) on streamlining. It feels so recent that I answered this, but it wasn't: [[2018.03.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: Greatest Achievement]]. Maintaining my sanity and will to live, whatever may be left of these, has to be my greatest achievement. It's [[hope]]. Resilient perseverance, being useful to a [[Telos]] that matters, and [[carpen all them diems|Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] are the goals. Jesus, even my answer is an enjoyable joke. =)
