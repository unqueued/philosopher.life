title: EFF: Standard Cover Letter

To Whom It May Concern,

I am very interested in the recently announced opening for the Privacy and Surveillance Activist position at the EFF. 

I am a moral philosopher by trade, but I'm uninterested in the academic game. I cherish applied ethics just as much as metaethical theory, and that's why I've been profoundly concerned for decades with privacy, free speech, surveillance, intellectual property, and what we owe to each other mediated through our machines. My vocational work is about the soup-to-nuts technical implementations, politics, moral justifications, and metaphysics of information.

As for my praxis, I do my best to use free and open source computers. I explore and test a wide variety of tools which generate privacy, anonymity, and decentrality. I ran 1% of the Tor network by throughput for years, volunteered an unknown amount of routing for i2p, and ran other kinds of proxies and private networks for public use. I spend time fallibly role-modeling and kindly evangelizing the gospel of owning our data, building identity-aware personal technical infrastructures (conditions for owning our autonomy and identities), end-to-end principles, and decentralizing information power. I drag my family and friends, both online and offline, kicking and screaming onto the only roads I'm convinced are headed for the promised land. I also write a massively personal wiki out in the open, in part, to demonstrate what trust, vulnerability, honesty, transparency, accountability, privacy, anonymity, and free speech really mean to me and why.

My writing samples include a chapter of my dissertation, an open personal letter to an ex-Facebook employee, an article on how I approach being in contact with people over my wiki, and an article about cryptographic signatures for my wiki. My goal is not only to show who I am and how my work intersects with this position at the EFF, but also to demonstrate a range of writing styles. This was not the original cover letter, but I thought it necessary to show you I can write a vanilla cover letter first. Here's the real, personal cover letter: https://philosopher.life/#EFF%3A%20Cover%20Letter.

While my practical experience, I believe, makes me a capable candidate for your position, I also believe my passion for safely building our computers and relationships make me a good fit for EFF. I would love the opportunity to work with you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon to arrange an interview.

Sincerely,

[Name]
