You have a good Saturday?
Feb 8 10:33pm
Woke up with matthew at midnight. He had a slug shit in diaper, which is odd at that hour. Normally  shits at 2:30am.  Clean him up, feed him big bottle while I play a few videos. Actually drinks it all, which he hasn't been doing for a few days.  Sitting watching videos until he is tired enough to sleep again, and I can tell he is shitting. Again, weird.  He gets done, and after a few more minutes for safety, I decide to change him and rock him to sleep.  Get in his room and turn on the light, look down and see that he has shit so much, and so wet, that it has soaked through the front and back of his onesie, and that my underwear is also soaked in his shit water from him sitting on me.

Call rebecca to ask for a hand.  We decide to just throw away the outfit.  Definitely the worst shit either of us have seen from him.
