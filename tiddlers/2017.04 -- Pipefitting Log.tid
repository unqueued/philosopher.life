title: 2017.04 -- Pipefitting Log

*Nash continues to be useless. Chris continues to be a decent peer. Luke has become a fun partner to work with. 
*I have changed my mind about the nature of the extra NCCER bookwork and my trajectory in this class over the month. It's clear my teacher really is trying to slow us down.
*The break wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
*I didn't create a networking section on this wiki. I think I really just need a private rolodex. I can't put their personally information on this site. I can only handle so many pseudonyms. 
** It will be important to keep my bridges.
* We didn't move straight into buttwelds in the second trimester like our teacher claimed.
* I talked a lot with my teacher this past month
* I'm clearly working harder than others in the shop.
* I spend significant time cataloging what other people do and why I think they do it. I think this is useful. I have to find the weaknesses of being autism and build good coping mechanism into my socialization.
* I actually feel bad for Chris often. He is a dad that is just trying to make it work. 
* The conflict between my teacher and Luke is clear. I think that my teacher may see me as taking up Luke's side. Or, at least I worry about that possibility.
* I didn't really accomplish nearly as much in welding as I'd like.
* I feel like I'm not asking my teacher enough questions about the nature, dynamics, requirements, and goals of pipefitting. I'm not sure how to get myself to figure out what questions I need to be asking. My teacher often doesn't seem to know what it is that he needs to be saying to us. I don't know how to pry out the information I need to know because I don't know it!
* Being the first in the toolroom is valuable, particularly if know which tools are worthwhile. When I'm on the job in the field, I think being first will be useful. It gives you a natural priority.
* Luke was willing to change his behaviors with me to some extent. This may be part of his personality that he attempts to blend in with those around him. 
* Extending respect often paid off directly with people, but indirectly it actually had repercussions (sometimes negative ones) with others. 
* This month had a lot of AB&T stuff going on.
* Overall, this was not my most productive month. That is a shame.
