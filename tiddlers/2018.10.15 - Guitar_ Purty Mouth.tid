title: 2018.10.15 - Guitar: Purty Mouth

Daughter is joining us. She's taking up the banjo. She has some basic music theory from learning piano and playing in bell-choir. I only have a couple books for banjo music, unfortunately. She decided to jump straight into //Dueling Banjos//. I'll pickup the guitar side when she has a page down, and my son will play chord accompaniment with us. I practiced my Celtic music and my son his chords.

My wife is going to be thrilled. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
