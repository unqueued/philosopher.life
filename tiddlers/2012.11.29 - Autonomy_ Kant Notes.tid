title: 2012.11.29 - Autonomy: Kant Notes

Summary (concentrating on Autonomy):

Autonomy is a source of human dignity, and it is at the heart of why we should treat each other as ends. There is a way to formulate the Categorical Imperative (CI)

Freedom and autonomy is concerned with legislative authority over oneself. External laws and influences, such as another person’s will or the laws of physics, jeopardize or pose a barrier to freedom and autonomy. When a person legislates for himself, he is bound by his own will and no other will binds him. Interestingly, the CI may not be external to us, but rather internal to us (I think there many concerns here), as the CI, as a principle, must be legislated by the person. The CI is authoritative because autonomous persons will it, rather than the CI being external to the agent.



Thoughts:

The CI is an expression of a person’s rational will. The CI is legislated by the autonomous person. The authority of the CI comes from an autonomous person make it binding upon his will. I take it that one is not fully rational if one does not legislative from the CI. Is the CI truly internal; does it have no external existence? I think that may pose some problems. Further, my worry is that “rational” is a powerful qualifier, and I take that what is used to evaluate a person as being rational or irrational is external to us. I don’t see how rationality doesn’t impose the CI upon us in an external sense.
