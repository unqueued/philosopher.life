title: My Rainbow

[[Sphygmus]] has the semantic coloration that I need to learn to use. The most important skill in the chaos, the static, the noise, the overwhelming, the insanity, the schizotypal pomowhirlwind, is to pick out what is [[salient]] (including picking out how to practically apply it). I often think one of the fundamental manual reading skills is being able to look at a feed and pick out the [[gems]] in the stream, including the [[/b/]]ish stream of consciousness found in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. Sometimes we can algorithmically build that feed better in terms of ranking (generally the most important problem). I see this strongly in [[kicks]]' Fraidycat tool. Building good graphs is an art and science well beyond me.

!! Personal Colors

* Tag, Link Title-Colors
** What do when multiples?
*** If [[title.Tag]] has name, then it has priority.
*** Could blend colors (nifty, would that work for people? won't for me, colorblind, but doesn't matter so much). 
** I am the black and white color. Boring. Rainbow, the epic spice.
** Could attempt to have both colors, split up the text (I can't guarantee they will be long enough!
** [[WWDD]] has actual greentext, though I may remove it for this mechanic. I'd like to highlight where my wife's and daughter's writing is embedded in my own. I want it to pop.

There's still valuable information to be gathered in a [[Timeline]] that's got a lot of noise in it if you can make scanning through that list less painful. 

Different categories of multireddits help in some cases (if I'm in the mood for X, or need to pay attention specifically to X), but I still need a generalized feed (that need will never go away). There has to be a very noisy place to weigh them all from multiple angles. Tags, coloration, injections, thumbs, and so many signals can augment what might otherwise be a stream which is too flat. To make [[salience]] pop out, we have to get use to increasing levels of dissonance (also at the heart of what makes entertainment so entertaining); practice and habit push that threshold for us, enabling us to be less surprised because we're better predictors. Part of being a good gamer just boils down to being able to glance at a screen of too much information and narrow it down to the right information in the blink of an eye while connecting that to larger storytelling mechanism for the entire game itself, and it's nice to be able to flexibly construct your own UI to some extent here.

I'm not good at picking things out of rainbows, and so I'd need something oversimple to glance at. This could easily get too noisy for anyone at some point, but adjusting that threshold of coloration noisiness is valuable. It took me a while to find a pair of gloves that fit well.
