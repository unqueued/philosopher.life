The book will...draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts....The limit can...only be drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense....Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent....Things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.

* Tarski: This sentence is false.
* Cantor: The real number which is different from every other real number in a countable list
* Turing: The program that determines whether any program halts or not

I refuse to be silent about the ineffable. 

I deny Self-Strawman Wittgenstein's right to assert the supremecy of his proposition that "all propositions are of equal value."<<ref "1">> You've stepped over the limit, pal, and you know it. There is something beyond each limit, as an application of the principle of sufficient reason. Your ladder metaphor is a hermeneutic spiral away from your starting point, and you fall off into the meaningless postmodern oblivion. If your argument is absurd, Cratylus, then by all means, stop communicating about it in both words and wagged finger-pointing. I agree, Strawman, you've shown us //nothing//, so shut your piehole. 

Watch my version of the Ontological Proof:<<ref "2">>

# [Meaning is real] or [Meaning is not real]
#* Assume: [Meaning is real]
#** Therefore, [Meaning is real] -- Reit
#* Assume: [Meaning is not real]
#** Therefore, [Meaning is real] -- Surd Elim     (I suppose I don't get to help myself to this on Dialetheic grounds)
# Therefore, [Meaning is real] -- Disjunction Elim

I hear you, however, Therapeutic Wittgenstein (you sly bastard); the ineffable is more valuable than the lame, finite, non-self-normifying propositions available to us to express and interpret.

In postulating a meaning, you postulate a language or model, and thus necessarily assert the truth of something beyond it (into paradox). In postulating a totality, you necessarily assert something beyond that totality. Here I aim to therapeutically deflate my philosophical positions, hopefully distilling useful [[Diamonds]] and [[Redpills]]. Amoral interpretations of Wittgenstein, unfortunately, are not satisfying because his reduction of language to a mere game consequently undermines the external world and ourselves into meaninglessness. While I cannot conceive //of// "The Inconceivable," I can conceive about it, and I believe there is more to reasonably say than what has been said thus far.<<ref "3">>

I must cope with the fact that I definitionally cannot resolve the problem.

I'm trying to conceive of that which cannot be conceived. Even if it is futile, it is the mountain I shall climb and die upon. 

It is the infinigressing story with no sides except itself. Paradoxically, reality both is and is not the symbol of itself.

To me, the incompleteness theory explains that symbols, syntax, and essentially, representations of any kind, can never fully explain reality, semantics, or being. Representation and correspondence is fundamentally limited by itself! Meaning, on its own definition, will always play second fiddle to Being. What "is" can never be fully described, justified, experienced, or understood in "meaning" (or at least those of us bound by the laws of logic and not merely ourselves experience this problem).

Ultimately, higher degrees of Bayesian Confidence can only emerge from lower degrees. The approach to certainty is build on uncertainties, and it can never escape it.

I suggest that my world is such that P!=NP holds for my world, but not for metaphysics. Non-determinism, and no-time to speak of it, seems. Perhaps the reality outside us, metaphysics itself, is a Hypercomputer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation... My conjecture is that the problems of P!=NP set physical limits on us and surround the gateway of what is physically possible for us to see and understand about metaphysics. Here, I make no claim about P!=NP being independent of set theory. I suggest that metaphysics doesn't have the notion of time, so the question is almost irrelevant. I'm an infinitivist.

Tarski's Undefinability Theorem

"An interpreted language is strongly-semantically-self-representational exactly when the language contains predicates and function symbols defining all the semantic concepts specific to the language. Hence the required functions include the "semantic valuation function" mapping a formula A to its truth value ||A||, and the "semantic denotation function" mapping a term t to the object it denotes. Tarski's theorem then generalizes as follows: No sufficiently powerful language is strongly-semantically-self-representational.

The undefinability theorem does not prevent truth in one theory from being defined in a stronger theory. For example, the set of (codes for) formulas of first-order Peano arithmetic that are true in N is definable by a formula in second order arithmetic. Similarly, the set of true formulas of the standard model of second order arithmetic (or n-th order arithmetic for any n) can be defined by a formula in first-order ZFC."

Hence, the infinigress of reality and likely [[The Good]].
