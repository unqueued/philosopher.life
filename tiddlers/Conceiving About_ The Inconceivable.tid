title: Conceiving About: The Inconceivable

!! About:

//Gödellian Mysticism wisely cautions us to "never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line." There is light at the end of the tunnel.//

<<<
The book will...draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts....The limit can...only be drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense....Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent....Things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.

--Ludwig Wittgenstein, //Tractatus//

I refuse to be silent about the ineffable. 

I deny Self-Strawman Wittgenstein's right to assert the supremecy of his proposition that "all propositions are of equal value."<<ref "1">> You've stepped over the limit, pal, and you know it. There is something beyond each limit, as an application of the principle of sufficient reason. Your ladder metaphor is a hermeneutic spiral away from your starting point, and you fall off into the meaningless postmodern oblivion. If your argument is absurd, Cratylus, then by all means, stop communicating about it in both words and wagged finger-pointing. I agree, Strawman, you've shown us //nothing//, so shut your piehole. 

Watch my version of the Ontological Proof:<<ref "2">>

# [Meaning is real] or [Meaning is not real]
#* Assume: [Meaning is real]
#** Therefore, [Meaning is real] -- Reit
#* Assume: [Meaning is not real]
#** Therefore, [Meaning is real] -- Surd Elim
# Therefore, [Meaning is real] -- Disjunction Elim

I hear you, however, Therapeutic Wittgenstein (you sly bastard); the ineffable is more valuable than the lame, finite, non-self-normifying propositions available to us to express and interpret.

In postulating a meaning, you postulate a language or model, and thus necessarily assert something truth beyond it. In postulating a totality, you necessarily assert something beyond that totality. Here I aim to therapeutically deflate my philosophical positions, hopefully distilling useful [[Diamonds]] and [[Redpills]]. Unethical-interpretations of Wittgenstein, unfortunately, are not satisfying because his reduction of language to a mere game consequently undermines the external world into meaninglessness. While I cannot conceive //of// "The Inconceivable," I can conceive about it, and I believe there is more to reasonably say than what has been said thus far.<<ref "3">>

I must cope with the fact that I definitionally cannot resolve the problem.
