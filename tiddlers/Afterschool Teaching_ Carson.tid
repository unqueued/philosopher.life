Dear Madame Carson,

We have only known each other for a short period of time, but I do my best to pay close attention to the people in my life, including you. I've enjoyed coming to understand: your point of view, how you interact with our public children, and some of your practical goals in life. I'm grateful that you listen so carefully in our conversations, and I ask you listen to this weird, homelessly-bearded, smelly old man once again.

I'd like to think that, as they say, "game recognize game." Girl, you got it! I think you will be wildly more successful than I've ever been at this too. You are //gifted// with children,<<ref "j">> and don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise without a fight. You're insightful about their identities, you engage in purpose-driven dialectical modeling of their minds and personalities, you have a tendency to be exceptionally charitable in how you interpret their motives, you are a clear advocate for these children, and you are constructive across the board. It's astounding. You're building community itself.<<ref "m">> Our public children are lucky to know you and to have you working on their behalf. I hope your vocation transforms you again and again and again, madame; and, if I'm right about who you are, it will.

Enclosed, you will find a set of books chosen for you from what remains of my physical library. For your games with our children, I give you //All Hands On Deck// and //Rolling in the Dough//. For your journey to understanding what matters most, I give you //The Elements of Moral Philosophy//. For your love of poetry, I give you //Our Numbered Days// (and a trivial bookmark-card). My wife has chosen for you the //Uppity Women// series. Like so many named and unnamed women in history: go forth, and kick ass, madame.

It's been my honor and a pleasure to work with you. You have no idea what it has meant to me, and I scarcely understand it myself. Thank you for putting up with me. I wish you the best. May you be a light in the darkness.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
