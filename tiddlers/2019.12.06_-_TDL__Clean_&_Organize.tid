title: 2019.12.06 - TDL: Clean & Organize

* Letterwriting
* You need to walk and talk.
* Help your wife with her beadwork wherever you can be useful.
* I like your work on the room. 
** The goal is to have clean, organized, and boxed up what you guaranteed won't use (until after you arrive), then what you likely won't, etc.
*** Loading will go by another priority though.
* Offspring need to have arranged all their goods into the closet so that we can get to deconstructing their beds. 
** The goal is to make sure they can put it back together. It's a good opportunity to reason together, as there are safety and convenience considerations to concern ourselves with.
* Your bro is still feeling like shit. Check-in. 
* Make sure you are setting aside the "suitcase" set for everyone. 
** You should set aside space just for that.
