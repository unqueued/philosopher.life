title: 2019.10.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Cleanup

* Woke at 7
* Chilled with my wife
* Coffee
* Read+Write
* Mostly finalized the art piece
* Cleaned the living room
* Dialecture
* Cracked whip
* Read+Write
* Work
* Walked with wife
** My wife is getting chilly or hot out of character and fast lately. Her temps are not normal. Worse than AMD. Hot flashes in the next decade, right?
*** We need more fruits and vegetables too. I know my guts have been off because, like, I've got a gut feeling about it.
* Chatted with Esteban for an hour outside. 
** We laughed a lot. That is not the norm for me. Dude aims to be honest. It's great. 
** Talked about our families, mostly his. I do all the question asking, as usual.
** Talked about some of the lyrics of a rapper he admires. He agreed to my 3rd culture claim and other assessments of what I like about his identity.
** His male biological donor is a PoS.
** We attempted to define integrity. He has well-trained instincts. 
** I, ofc, did not make him happy with my view of his pseudo-passive income. He's engaged in sales but vehemently claims he's not. Tries to pass it off as something else. He is sure he is going to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars some day. We talked about possibility and probability. I agree he's a statistical anomaly, but his reasoning on this topic is profoundly flawed. Honesty here is painful.
*** It's so weird to see him use the dealer's language to describe the full process, to call it a kickback, cutting out middlemen, etc., and also act like it's altruistic pursual of his client's best interests.
**** His confabulation about the poverty in this region was something I had to straight-up correct. He may not deny their plight.
*** I tested my brother's claim here as well. Some people actually bite the bullet and think of being called a "temporarily embarrassed millionaire" as a good thing.
**** It's so fucking weird to see the schism in him. He so desperately wants to be wealthy (hey, I've fuckin' been there), and yet he has all the pieces to see what wealthy people are like. 
* Read+Write
* Black beans and rice, fruit, butternut squash
* //Daria// until it hurt, //Regular Show// until it hurt.
* Even if only accidentally, my wife is killing me in her teasing dress.
** So thirsty.
* Sleep by 10 fucking 30.
** <3 - You are, like, my hero, dude.
