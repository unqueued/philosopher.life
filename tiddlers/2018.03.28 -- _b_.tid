I'd like to see a way to understand the memetic impact and evolution of menstruation. It is considered a categorical error to assume any mutation, behavior, etc. must conceptually include adaptiveness to any given context. That said, I have found it inductively suitable to continue to ask the question: "what purpose does that serve?" without begging the classic telic questions you are worried about. 

Genetics exist to produce memetics. Memetics are what matter most because they house what matters most closely. I am a differentiationist, and do not take up the pure agnostic neutrality of object-oriented ontology.
