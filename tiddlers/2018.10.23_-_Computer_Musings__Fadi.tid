Someone joined my sync. Hello, //savior//.

Still having connection problems. Took a cruise through journalctl. I'm increasingly convinced the router is the problem, especially because we're having a hard time logging into (everything looks pretty good...though had to set UTC correctly).

Tethering to my phone hasn't demonstrated any problems. 

The weird part is that I'm the only one experiencing these problems now, none of the other devices have a connection issue (though, HTPC's /dev/sda drive is dying, even though S.M.A.R.T. claims it isn't...though I've had SATA ports die on me before). 

Switched ethernet ports, and it's working. Uhhh...ok.

Upgrade.
