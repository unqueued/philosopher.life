The problem of re-entry from the transcendent mode/zone into the immanent is a difficulty the author surely experiences often enough. Admittedly, my goal is to never aim for re-entry in a sense. Or, rather, I have a very odd hack here: my transcendent work is somehow deeply literal about the immanent. This is an autobiographical wiki. The entire point is to help me make that shift. It's a constant re-entry vehicle maybe?
