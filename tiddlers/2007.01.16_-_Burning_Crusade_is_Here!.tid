title: 2007.01.16 - Burning Crusade is Here!

We bought The Burning Crusade. (SP2 req though...i'm afraid it might not work). Once it is up, I'll be botting quickly to 70. From there, I'll run instances + arena etc. But, I'm doubting whether I should bot at all at 70, as I'm sure to get a million tells for LFG and what not. Bot a BE pally ftw?. Still need to cough up 1.5-2k for the mountificationness. Anyways, plan on leveling my rogue and then the pally. Hey, I always wanted to be brokenly good! I predict level 70 BE pallies in 2 weeks. Mine will take 4-8 weeks.

I've been enjoying some good duels, but a lot of young adults play...and they have a tendancy to be retarded...good duels, poor conversation. Not that I get conversation with anyone but my wife (and she often times is too tired and stressed to talk with me). Hell, why do you think I write you...you oblivion. Getting it out of my head, whatever I'm spewing on these pages, keeps me sane.

Work is...work. But, I'm glad it is a job instead of a career for me. I am most thankful that I don't feel like in put in a position of doing what is moral vs. what my boss(es) tell me to do, unlike public schools. My job is not very significant, and I'm glad I can say it and plan for the future with that lense. Of course, I'm sure that doesn't clearly please my bosses, it at least doesn't get me into trobule. While I can put out the production of 5 people, I now only put out what is required and then some. I don't have incentive to do more.

Mind you, I'm very difficult to please. My job is fine. It pays the bills, and isn't strictly immoral from what I can see. Not my function directly in life, but it allows to me to support my family, which certainly qualifies as a purpose.

---Oh, and Flint and Kathy are taking the baby for us on Saturday. We are gonna have a day of it....breakfast, Magic tourney, hopefully we'll grab some Indian food. We sure could use a day off from the kidlet.
