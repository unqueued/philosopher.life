title: 2018.11.12 - AIR: Dreams

I called him up on his day off. He's having waterheater troubles. =/

He told me about a nightmare he had. I understand dreams say something about our stress levels, but I think he shouldn't read too much it (especially since we have such a high chance of failing to accurately remember them). Still, it was interesting to hear it.

He talked about the unique dessert he made and the reactions he got.

I setup XMPP on his laptop and he on his phone. We've made it so he can message himself.

I couldn't get qbittorrent and port forwarding to work for him.
