Have a great day [[h0p3]]. Hope you’re feeling better today.
WED 8:43 AM
Thank you. Me too. And, you too! =)
WED 10:14 AM
What do you have lined up today?
WED 10:14 AM
Registering for classes in about an hour. Nervous. I thought I had it all lined up,  but one of the professors I’m looking at apparently hates men according to a few people on ratemyprofessor.
WED 10:16 AM
lol
WED 10:16 AM
I mean I’d usually take it with a grain of salt but....
WED 10:16 AM
I'm sure you will do fine though.
WED 10:16 AM
I’d rather take an easier class just to be safe. XD
WED 10:17 AM
You are easy going.
WED 10:17 AM
It was a women and humor class. I’m switching to modern middle eastern lit.
WED 10:17 AM
Oh
WED 10:17 AM
That sounds even more fun to me.
WED 10:18 AM
The professor has good reviews and sounds nice.
WED 10:18 AM
And at the end of the day, I JUST have to pass. Plus I’d like to learn more about Middle Eastern culture.
WED 10:19 AM
Because of growing up in the Southern Baptist hive mind, I feel like I’ve missed out on learning a lot about Islam.
WED 10:20 AM
It's a fascinating way to shop.
WED 10:20 AM
Lol. Hive mind.
WED 10:20 AM
Do you think it sounds like a good switch? XD
WED 10:21 AM
I think your reasoning is excellent. Plus, females aren't funny (ayyyy), so that class couldn't be worth anything anyways.
WED 10:22 AM
Lmfao
WED 10:22 AM
A M Y S C H U M E R
WED 10:22 AM

WED 10:22 AM
So I’ve started watching Fight Club in chunks, and I forgot how great the fourth wall breaks are. I wanna devote half of my paper to them because I feel like it’s very post modern.
WED 10:24 AM
Yes. Cigarette burn is my favorite. Like it is spliced into the film, we live in a simulation, or something.
WED 10:25 AM
Yes! It’s completely detached from the overall narrative and alludes to the fact that Ed Norton recognizes that he is in a film.
WED 10:26 AM
And Durden acknowledges it too
WED 10:26 AM
Why do you think 4th wall breaks are very postmodern? (I'm not saying they aren't, but I fear they might not be in all cases)
WED 10:27 AM
Just because it is meta enough that it destroys metanarratives by pointing them out?
WED 10:28 AM
Right! So one of the biggest aspects of postmodernism is that you and I can both believe something is true, even if they stand in direct opposition to each other. And we are both correct.
WED 10:29 AM
So in this case, we experience the events of the movie through Ed’s view. But we also see that he’s a liar when he goes to the counseling sessions so his view cannot he fully trusted as fact. He is an unreliable narrator.
WED 10:30 AM
So in some ways, the fourth wall breaks shatter the illusion of the film and show it as a complete fabrication.
WED 10:31 AM
It’s just a movie.
WED 10:31 AM
I think postmodernism reduces it to absurdity. It's not that we are both correct: it's that there is no correct.
WED 10:31 AM
Right. If you’re right, and I’m right, but both of our rights are directly opposite, then  who is actually right?
WED 10:32 AM
We can’t say for sure.
WED 10:32 AM
That we can't say for sure doesn't mean there isn't a correct answer.
WED 10:33 AM
There is a difference between whether or not there is an objective answer and our access to it.
WED 10:33 AM
And that argument is shown clearly in the relationship between Ed and Tyler Durden who have conflicting ideologies.
WED 10:33 AM
But doesn’t post modernism suggest that there is also no universal truth?
WED 10:33 AM
Well, is that claim itself objectively true?
WED 10:33 AM
postmodernism takes modernism to the Nth degree and recursively deconstructs everything. No construction is possible.
WED 10:34 AM
Or it becomes //mere// construction
WED 10:34 AM
It almost feels like post modernism doesn’t trust itself.
WED 10:35 AM
Postmodernism is the ironic grand metanarrative which says there are no grand metanarratives. You are right: it's sincerity destroys sincerity. It doesn't trust anything, and therefore it doesn't trust itself.
WED 10:36 AM
I should distinguish between works which criticize postmodernism (even leveraging postmodernist techniques and ideas to do so) and works which are actually postmodern. I think //Fight Club// is far more effective as a critique.
WED 10:37 AM
Probably. But I’m only supposed to highlight and discuss the post modern aspects of the film. Haha.
WED 10:38 AM
I see where you are coming from though.
WED 10:38 AM
Oh, well, "why" there are postmodern aspects still seems open, right?
WED 10:39 AM
Perhaps in the vein of foot notes or mere mentioning.
WED 10:40 AM
Going back, just because Ed lies to others doesn't mean he is lying to us. It's not even clear the extent to which he is lying to himself. It feels like society is lying to him, and he's discovering it through a personality disorder. The strongest aspect of unreliability is in the split personality.
WED 10:41 AM
And that in itself is one of the postmodern aspects worth putting at the forefront.
WED 10:42 AM
Yes!
WED 10:43 AM
They are the pillars on which the whole plot is built! :R
WED 10:43 AM
:D
WED 10:43 AM
Marla is also interesting because in a lot of ways she is shown as a reflecting of Ed.
WED 10:43 AM
Reflection***
WED 10:43 AM
That's how Ed discovers the truth of the illusion too.
WED 10:44 AM
He needs that mirror.
WED 10:44 AM
or The Other to reveal it in him
WED 10:44 AM
In their initial meeting, he is quick to call her out on what she is doing, but he’s condemning her for the same stuff he’s doing.
WED 10:44 AM
Definitely!
WED 10:44 AM
Yeah, he's a selfish, hyperindividualistic hypocrite in the beginning.
WED 10:44 AM
On his road to Damascus perhaps.
WED 10:45 AM
Yeah! She represents the person he is trying to leave behind, but he also can’t stand to get rid of her.
WED 10:45 AM
What does that say about him?
WED 10:45 AM
I’m only about halfway through myself, so I’m a little fuzzy on the end.
WED 10:46 AM
Gonna sound crazy, but I think Fight Club is a love story on multiple fronts.
WED 10:46 AM
No I completely agree with you.
WED 10:46 AM
The subtext is there
WED 10:47 AM
Backing up a second (I often have to do these loops): I feel like the 4th wall doesn't shatter the illusion. Take Abed in //Community//, his 4th wall breaks don't make either of us feel uncomfortable. The flow feels natural. Abed just "knows" he lives in a simulation, and the other people in the story just don't. I don't think his story feels like a fabrication to him any more than ours does. There is a way in which physics is a simulation, a moral medium in which we express our lives. There is also a sense in which freewill just is fabricating who we will be. I'm still only half sold on the 4th wall being conceptually bound to denying metanarrative.
WED 10:49 AM
Imagine people who pray to God.
WED 10:50 AM
That is like a 4th wall break.
WED 10:50 AM
I mean just in the sense that we are looking at Fight Club as a movie instead of real events.
WED 10:51 AM
Yeah, those are good examples though. I see what you mean!
WED 10:51 AM

WED 10:52 AM
i'll check this out after my class. x) Thank you!
WED 11:01 AM
This is really helpful. A lot of it lines up with my notes too. :)
WED 11:20 AM
The timeline jumping around is also really important I think.
WED 11:20 AM
Aye.
WED 11:21 AM
It's non-linear for him in a discombobulating schizoid way.
WED 11:22 AM
So it sounds like I can make a strong identification of Ed's character, particularly in his relationship with others, the unreliable narrator/ truth talk, and the 4th wall breaks/ timeline jumps.
WED 11:23 AM
And somehow this has to be only 4-5 pages.
WED 11:23 AM
Lmao
WED 11:23 AM
You can do it!
WED 11:23 AM
I hate those limits.
WED 11:23 AM
Footnotes can squeeze everything onto the page.
WED 11:24 AM
Completely off topic, I'm bringing knowledge from my Mysticism class into a different research paper. It's going to be a big focal point of the paper.
WED 11:24 AM
I've never actually used footnotes before!
WED 11:24 AM
I am footnote whore.
WED 11:24 AM
Hahaha
WED 11:24 AM
me love it
WED 11:24 AM
I can tell from your wiki ;)
WED 11:25 AM
But I think it's great/ important
WED 11:25 AM
So what's the mysticism knowledge you'll be applying in the research paper?
WED 11:25 AM
I'm going to reopen the door on wuwei and the natural order of the universe and discuss it in tandem with a collection of poems about a woman who is trying to understand/ reconcile the suicide of her father.
WED 11:26 AM
There's one section where she directly alludes to Taoism
WED 11:26 AM
And it caught my eye because of my last class.
WED 11:26 AM
Neat. I love when classes overlap.
WED 11:27 AM
Same! It gives me two strong resources, and it's still somewhat fresh in my mind too.
WED 11:27 AM
The alternative is to write a hybrid paper, and that sounds.... too much for me, haha.
WED 11:28 AM
I don't know what a hybrid paper is
WED 11:29 AM
It could be any combination of prose, poetry, visual aspects, music, mixing of language, style, etc
WED 11:29 AM
Ah
WED 11:30 AM
Cool.
