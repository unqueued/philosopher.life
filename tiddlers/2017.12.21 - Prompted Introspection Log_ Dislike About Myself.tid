title: 2017.12.21 - Prompted Introspection Log: Dislike About Myself

!! What is something about yourself that you dislike?

A great many things at times. I dislike that I dislike myself so much. 

Seriously though, I'm extremely harsh. I wish I weren't so harsh a person. My goal isn't to be cruel, and yet, sometimes that is the only language I know. I wish I was a better empathizer affectively, cognitively, and executively. I'm pretty harsh towards everything and everyone. I think that isn't an accident. Of course, genetics plays a role, but I think I've been conditioned to be this way as well. Sensitivities can often be expressed in this way. I see the world differently. I'm in a vortex of pain. I feel pretty hopeless about the world at times. 

Tangentially, my brother and I were talking yesterday about whether or not I had escaped depression. He inspected it with me. He agrees I'm not in a major depressive state, i.e. I'm not suicidal. He thinks I may always be depressed though, prone to slipping into major. He thinks I'm making progress, that at least I see a light at the end of the tunnel, but that I'm still in the tunnel. This is probably accurate. I feel like I have the wolf off my back, but I still see him staring at me from the edge of the woods. I must always watch for it.

It's very hard to be kind when you are in pain, especially to those who cause your suffering (or mimic the thought-patterns and behaviors of those who do).
