Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man. And, damn, dude, I'm really glad you have that opinion. It's an ethical one. Let me continue your argument because it deserves more explanation and justification.

Aside: I think the downvote you received was meant to persuade you to change your tune. 

> The ability to argue finds truth better. Persuasion , like physical coercion, only gets you what you think you want.

Argumentation may be a subset of persuasion, even if it isn't always an effective form. I'm glad to see you've pointed out how rhetoric and violence are tools of persuasion, especially because their instrumental "value" isn't necessary a morally motivated one. Persuasion includes a much broader set of means to achieve power over minds than standard argumentation. If raw power is what we value here, then it's obvious that those who aren't going to play by the moral rules in how they persuade others will tend to have a profound competitive advantage.

>  Argumentation and persuasion are very different skills. The ability to persuade is the more valuable skill.

More valuable skill for the sake of...oh, Careers & Work. The **U**LPT here is that manipulating people and treating them as mere means, rather than respecting the dignity of their reason through argumentation, is going to improve how you climb the ladders of Capitalism. I agree to that. Well-integrated psychopaths are extremely persuasive (using a mix of cognitive and affective tools); they empathize with you just enough to use it against you to their benefit. It makes sense why politicians employ rhetoric rather than plain reason.

What I value about solid argumentation is that it is more resistant to using me as mere means. Sound arguments are directly concerned with truth value in a way that persuasion at large generally is not.

There is, of course, grey area here. Exactly what counts as an argument is something we should argue about. I happen to think, for example, that non-verbal communication can be used with enough accuracy that we can emote and demonstrate simple kinds of arguments, even if only informally and implicitly. This takes us down a difficult rabbithole.
