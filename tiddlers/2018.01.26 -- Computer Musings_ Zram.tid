title: 2018.01.26 -- Computer Musings: Zram

I've never had much luck with Zram, but I'm considering trying it out again. It might just be worth it. RAM is very fucking expensive.

Tried installing our 16GB RAM chip install my wife's laptop (Monster-12). Motherboard only reads up to 8...*Sigh. My wife may have to manage her memory more carefully.
