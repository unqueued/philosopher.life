Going dang fine. Been a restful weekend. I truly hate that I missed your last day. I went over there and cleaned today and all I could think of is what a void there is going to be in my life. I'm going to miss you buddy. You don't know what an impression you made to me and I have enjoyed every second. I love you and your family. I wish nothing but the best for you all. I really would like to spend some time with you before you go and as I said...I will help you in anyway I can. Your a true friend and you have made a old man smile. I really mean this and I hope you know i will be aggravating you weekly. Lol Please lets get together soon my friend.
