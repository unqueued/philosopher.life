How are you guys doing today?
Jan 5 11:42am
[[k0sh3k]] is sick, and Meow isn't adjusting quickly. The rest of us are doing well though. Spent a chunk of change yesterday to have a working house in which we can put useful things into our bodies and get rid of waste. Just got interwebs up a few minutes ago, so I'm feeling much closer to myself.
Jan 5 11:44am
How about you?
Jan 5 11:45am
Adjusting is a process. I hope things get better from here on out. Your things still have a few days to arrive right?
Jan 5 11:46am
Hopefully in a few days, yeah.
Jan 5 11:46am
We’re good. Going to get some errands done today and enjoy each other’s company. Work starts back for me tomorrow and I’m going to allergy testing on Friday.
Jan 5 11:47am
Excellent.
Jan 5 11:47am
Allergy test doesn't sound fun, but hopefully it will be useful.
Jan 5 11:47am
I don’t see the point in confirming what I already account for in a daily allergy medicine, but [[L]] insists. And it’s nigh impossible to change her mind once it’s set haha
Jan 5 11:50am
Lol
Jan 5 11:50am
Welp, may it be useful to her peace of mind.
Jan 5 11:50am
True, I’m looking forward more to the asthma testing a week from Tuesday. I think it’ll confirm more.
Jan 5 11:53am
Hope you have a great day today

Also you’re right. [[JRE]] typed me a book this AM after asking how he was doing. It’s like night and day!
Jan 6 9:45am
Yo! =)
Jan 6 11:53am
That is awesome. Books are good.

How's work going?
