title: 2019.02.20 - Computer Musings: PINCH ME!

Am I {[[dream]]}ing? I just bought 3 machines for $36 a piece including shipping. I'm 80% sure I'm being scammed on Ebay, but I can't help myself. Apparently, they reserve the right to cancel any transaction for any reason. The seller has a 20yo account, amazing ratings, 5k auctions completed. They claim these machines have been tested, though they might have some dings (I still have my sexy Lian-Li server tower upstairs just fucking sitting there). Specs:

```

Processor Type 	                Intel Xeon 8-Core E5-2670
Processor Speed 	        2.60GHz
Processor(s) Installed 	        2
Heatsink(s) Included 	        2
Max. Supported Qty. 	        2

```

Single-thread on these: 1,570. [[monster-10]] sits at 2,178. That is a kick in the nuts. Still, multi-thread jumps from m10's 9662 to 24260. That is some fucking firepower right there. Yesterday, I would have paid $500 for this with only a single CPU. 

The RAM is what's blowing my mind. That's what I have a hard-on for. I've crashed twice this year with 16GB RAM + 16GB Swap consumed (my RAM usage continues to climb year over year). I can feel the lag, especially bottlenecked over SATA.

If none of the machines work out, I'll complain. If they cancel on me, okay. If a single one can be salvaged, I'm in heaven. There is a possibility all 3 machines are going to function. I couldn't build a Threadripper 2950X machine (comparable bench) with 128GB RAM for less than $2k.

I should keep one and sell the other two. We could use the money.

That said: I'm not going to get my hopes up. This is a gamble.
