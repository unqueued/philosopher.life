Reading + Writing, Cracking whips with my chillun, and trying to figure out how I'm going to communicate to my public children what they mean to me (I'm not sure what the fitting parting words out to be). Currently walking through my Afterschool Teaching log and audits to make sure I've a fitting picture of what I might need to say in a hypothetical exit interview.
