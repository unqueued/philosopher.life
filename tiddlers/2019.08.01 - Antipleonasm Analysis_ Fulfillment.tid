title: 2019.08.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Fulfillment

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
What is at stake here is precisely the problem of the fulfillment of desire: when we encounter in reality an object which has all the properties of the fantasized object of desire, we are nevertheless necessarily somewhat disappointed; we experience a certain this is not it; it becomes evident that the finally found real object is not the reference of desire even though it possesses all the required properties.

Schopenhauer, Buddhism, Jesus, and Hegel all have a great deal to say about this problem. Completion in [[The Dialectic]] is impossible for the [[fff]], and yet it is our plight to attempt to cobble together ourselves as best we can. Denying it doesn't sate the desire either. [[The Categorical Imperative]] is the only metaethical groundwork which can flesh out the contents of what it means to run on the desire satisfaction treadmill with merit. Here I turn to [[Stoicism-fu]] for reframing the problem, and I aim to do so with integrity (it is easy to relativistically and conveniently confabulate in this space).
