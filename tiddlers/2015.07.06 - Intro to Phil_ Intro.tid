Why did you take the class?

There are many pragmatic reasons to learn and practice philosophy:

    Philosophy students have some of the highest LSAT, GRE, and GMAT test scores. Whether this is causal or correlative, I don’t know.

    Not all majors are created equally. There are majors which do not improve critical reasoning skills at all (Business, Education, and Communications majors). You can literally earn a degree, but not walk out a smarter human being, despite having memorized things. Note that school is largely about training your mind, not just filling it with stuff. You need the critical reasoning skills to do something with the stuff you’ve filled your mind with, and philosophy helps with this.

    Despite how it is joked about, philosophy majors and philosophers do not have a hard time finding a job or rising through the ranks in a company. Philosophy prepares you to think about abstract concepts with careful analysis, and the practice of philosophy requires you to become articulate and precise in your written and spoken communications. These are invaluable skills on the job market.

        E.g. anecdote of my own experiences

These reasons are practical in the eyes of most people. This is generally not why philosophers “do” philosophy though. There is another practical reason to do philosophy, although it is not immediately obvious to non-philosopher’s why it is practical. In particular, the best reason to do philosophy is that it is concerning with:

    Reasoning about and searching for answers to some of the most important questions humanity has ever faced.

I hope that, in time, this will be the reason you engage in the practice of philosophy as well.

What is philosophy?

Literally, in Greek, the love of wisdom. That might not be a clarifying definition. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to nicely define philosophy for you. I can tell you that “What is philosophy?” is itself a philosophical question that philosophy tries to answer.

In a sense, philosophy is the study of everything. This is the broad definition. This “study of everything” was how philosophy started out, and to some degree, that is still how academia sees it. For example, a “PhD” is a philosophy doctorate. You can get a PhD in a ton of areas, many which don’t seem to be too philosophical at first. But, when you are pushing the boundaries of human understanding and extending the sum of human knowledge in a topic, you are doing philosophy. When you look at the history of the sciences, you will find the seeds and beginnings of those sciences in what was, at the time, considered pure philosophy. Philosophy is the root of many, if not all, studies. Hence, “love of wisdom” and “love of knowledge” might not be too far off. Are you trying to understand the world? That is philosophy in the broad sense. Nothing academic escapes being philosophical in this broad sense.

So, one way to think about philosophy is in its relation to all the other studies and sciences. Now, I said that the sciences can be philosophical. That is true. That’s a very broad definition of philosophy though. Some people prefer a more narrow definition, and we can still offer a narrow one in virtue of philosophy’s relation to all the other studies and sciences.

On this narrow definition, Philosophy, with a capital P, isn’t a standard science (with some unique exceptions). It is the parent of sciences, the foundation for them. Philosophy is the study of things which come before and come after science. Where science is required to making crucial assumptions which science itself cannot validate, that is where philosophy begins. Where science cannot explain a phenomenon that is also where philosophy begins.

Sometimes I like to think of philosophy as the collection of topics which simply can’t be addressed by science. Philosophy is that study of all those big, difficult, and deep questions that require answers before we can begin science or those left over after science. Indeed, when you look at the bleeding edge of academia in almost all topics, even they will admit they have stopped engaging in their standard scientific practices and instead have engaged in philosophy (this is especially obvious for physics).

Sadly, even this narrow definition, of course, is not a good one. Moral psychology, the study of minds and consciousness, physics for the study of being, and numerous other sciences have been hybridized and integrated into what is currently thought of as academic philosophy. When you go to a conference of advanced logic, you’ll find a mixture of philosophers and mathematicians. When you go to a conference for computer ethics and white hat hacking, you’ll find philosophers, hackers, and computer scientists. This is the way of things in academia. Hence, drawing these lines is difficult. As I said before, defining philosophy is not easy.

In any case, I want to give you a great introduction to philosophy. And, so, we’ll be examining some of most famous and most standard kinds of philosophical questions.

Questions like:

    What does it mean to be justified in believing something? What does good reasoning look like?

    What is reality? What is substance? What does it mean to exist?

    What is a mind? How are our minds and bodies related?

    What does it mean to be conscious? What does it mean to be free? Are we free?

    What is good and bad? What is right and wrong? What is justice?

    How do we apply moral theories to case examples in the world? What do problematic examples tell us about the morality?

    What counts as an authentic law or government?

    What are the concepts and attributes of God, and does God exist?

    What is science? What is its purpose, and what are its limits?

    What is beauty? How does it relate to the good?

We’ll have a collection of short readings which give rise to and address these questions. Together, we’ll be reading through a history of canonical philosophy texts that are highly regarded in the analytic, Western philosophy tradition. There are other kinds of philosophy, but I have to narrow the scope of this class (which is already extremely broad).

We are trying to survey the landscape of Western philosophy. I’m trying to maximize breadth while maintaining enough depth for you to get your hands dirty in practicing philosophical thinking.

By the end of the course, you should be prepared to take future philosophy classes or study philosophy on your own to some extent.
