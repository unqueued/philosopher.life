You have some solid gaming planned this weekend?
AUG 23 11:02 AM
How was your weekend?
AUG 26 11:15 AM
Hey [[h0p3]], i just realized that my message never sent... sorry about that!
AUG 26 11:15 AM
Yeah it was a good weekend.
AUG 26 11:15 AM
Don't worry about it. And, good. I 'm glad =)
AUG 26 11:16 AM
Didn’t game much, but I wrote ten pages and relaxed.
AUG 26 11:16 AM
Nice. What did you write?
AUG 26 11:16 AM
I did my first creative writing workshop in advance based on a dnd character of mine in the world I created.
AUG 26 11:17 AM
Haha, nice.
AUG 26 11:19 AM
I guess you have time to draft and redraft it too.
AUG 26 11:19 AM
The theory class you had was something like a capstone for the your major, but this creative writing class also feels like capstone to me.
AUG 26 11:20 AM
For sure. This is the pinnacle of what I want out of my major. Hahaha
AUG 26 11:20 AM
Exactly because this class is structured IDENTICAL to my last CW class
AUG 26 11:20 AM
I already know that one of my workshops needs to be heavily revised and I started that yesterday too. ;)
AUG 26 11:21 AM
Have you considered an MFA?
AUG 26 11:22 AM
What’s that?
AUG 26 11:23 AM
Master of Fine Arts, in creative writing
AUG 26 11:23 AM
I don't know anything about that industry or discipline.
AUG 26 11:23 AM
(I'm shooting in the dark here)
AUG 26 11:24 AM
It's obvious you love it though.
AUG 26 11:24 AM
You are going to do it even if nobody is paying you.
AUG 26 11:24 AM
You are working on projects ahead of time. That's excitement.
AUG 26 11:24 AM
(better than anything I ever did)
AUG 26 11:24 AM
Might not be worth it at all. As I said, I have no idea.
AUG 26 11:25 AM
Still, give it a look.
AUG 26 11:25 AM
Will do. If I were more confident in my writing ability I’d really consider it. I just never know if I’ll be able to make a living off of my work. Haha
