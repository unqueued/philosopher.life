title: 2018.07.12 -- Prompted Introspection: Career Path

!! Explain how you chose your career path.

Not much of a career, I'm afraid to say. I am part of the lost generation. I had a 3rd world education before being thrown into community college because my parents were too evil and lazy to have provided us better (when they so obviously could have).<<ref "1">> I'm lucky to be smart in some respects (lacking executive functioning, to say the least, in others). I received some pretty awful priors and models about the world, and it's been a whirlwinding school of hard knocks since then. I am wildly luckier than most of my cohort. I've had the opportunity to work a variety of jobs.

My career at this point is just trying to survive and teach my children.
