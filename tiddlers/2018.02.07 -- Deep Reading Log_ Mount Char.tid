title: 2018.02.07 -- Deep Reading Log: Mount Char

---

Alright, I'm done with doing chapters. This book stopped needing it.

I still don't understand the lions. We've spent a fuck ton of time on them, and I don't see why. They seem completely irrelevant to me so far. It's action with no meaning.

Love the bootstrapping of power storyline of Father. I would suggest that the author has perhaps inadvertently also demonstrated a similar chain of "mastery" among the orphans. Jennifer was the first to be master, just as Father likely first mastered medicine. David and war seem second, etc. 

What is "pure thought" and "reality virus"? Fascinating notions, I am sure.

WTF is on the bookshelf?

The species of crazy is odd. It sounds beautifully chaotic, evil, etc. 

As I suspected, Carolyn has the ability to learn the other skills qua her language virtuosity.

I adore revenge plots. I adore "power-up" Goku shit. I adore training for the final fight. Cleverness, stealth, and learning are hawt. I need to bang Carolyn tonight! Did she start this whole fucking thing!??

If time doesn't pass for David, he can't be a mind (unless he is transcendent).

"Not this time" ROFL!

"Architecture of Thought" -- I adore these phrases, btw.

"The risk in working to be a dangerous person..."

Hobbesian notion of freedom, Liber, Library. It's a library of power.

Ineffability of Father

Why does Father cause that much pain?

“I think perhaps God is angry.”

"The vocabulary of such a creature would be different from what I am used to, different from what I know."

Why aren't we being told about Carolyn relationship/choice of Steve? Make it obvious please. There is enormous pain and power in this story. Resolve it.

She is remaking Michael.

Carolyn-God is impersonal. Steve's argument so far is something to behold.

<<<
Normal men, she understood for the first time, burn surprisingly fast. In less than a minute, he was dead. Therein, perhaps, we find God’s mercy. Beyond that, the outer darkness.
<<<

It's a very moving scene. Why does Carolyn not see it in advance?

"adopt a stance of compassion” -- Why does she not ultimately understand what it means? How can you be a language master but not understand it?

<<<
“Sure. Why not? I’ve been in a teaching mood lately.” He poked the meat with a carved wooden fork. “The secret is to start with a hot fire, as hot as you can make. Such a fire will burn away impurities, you see. Plus, there’s a ceremonial aspect to it. Fire gives a person something to focus on.” He rapped the bull with his knuckles, grinning. “So, yeah. Fire. That’s the first step.”
<<<

That is a powerful line for a woman who was burned alive.

The eternal suffering of his own son. It's truly poetic.

<<<
I must send you into exile, that you may be the coal of her heart. No real thing can be so perfect as memory, and she will need a perfect thing if she is to survive. She will warm herself on the memory of you when there is nothing else, and be sustained.
<<<

You know, when I was a child, my Sunday school teacher asked me who I thought was most like Jesus. I answered, "My dad." It is a memory that haunts both of us. 

I do not understand why it had to be this way. Father comes back, he has control of time itself. What lesson was there to really learn? I don't get it.

<<<
“It’s the idea that however deeply you understand the universe, however many mysteries you solve, there will always be another, deeper mystery behind it.”
<<<

Gödel. Yes. 

<<<
“I didn’t know, Carolyn. I had faith in you.” Father’s eyes twinkled. “You should probably start getting used to that.”
<<<

Holy fuck. I did not see that coming! It was so obvious, and wonderful, and sad.

I've never seen a book mortalize God as effectively as this one.

Excellent book.

Epilogue seems irrelevant.
