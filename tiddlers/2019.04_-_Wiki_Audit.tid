!! Audit:

* My god, this log has almost died. I have so much to do. Welp, it's gonna happen.
** I shouldn't go accumulator mode on this one though.
* We've made significant improvements to the blog-readability of this wiki through the timeline and [[The 1000]]. 
** We're building a tool for {[[Vault]]} too, essentially.
** It has made [[Family Time]] go even smoother to the point we've replicated it in other wikis.
** I use the button when I'm on the phone and know I have a bunch to edit. I adore it there since I can avoid scrolling.
* Mass opening and control of the storyriver is a non-trivial project that will likely continue to evolve. Mentat is something I'm still keeping my eye on. We have some layout plans already, especially for being able to use the wiki arbitrarily in i3 nesting.
* [[The Remodeling]] has died for now, though it may still come a bit alive in the current letter to [[SLT]] (maybe on the second pass).
** It's interesting that I have few or no particular tiddlers that I'm proud of as standalone articles.
* [[Firmcoding]] has been amazing. This is such a weird hack to most users of TW, but they aren't as paranoic and they don't have wikis this large.
** I still need templating for making new directories of different kinds.
** [[Firmcoding]] has allowed me to not care so much about the contents of directories themselves. They are more set and forget now. Someone interested in a particular directory, however, should still be in good shape. The ability to accept more dynamic work in the wiki has made me perceive and use the wiki differently. It's exciting.
* I'm still having plenty of Bob problems. 
** Simultaneous editing is still worth it.
