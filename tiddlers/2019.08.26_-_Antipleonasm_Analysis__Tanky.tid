!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Human Resource Departments see you as a vessel of capital wrapped in liabilities which prevent them from fully exploiting you. HR exists to help the company legally (but not morally) extract maximum value from you. Make no mistake: they aren't your friend.

Hm, looks like yours truly wrote this one. 

They screen the world for wage-slaves, bind them with invisible chains, and herd their humans. They are managers who build legal cases against their employees and seek to work you as intensely and as long as possible for as little pay as you'll take. They are sophists and middlemen. Like a police officer, what you say to them can and will be used against you. They do not exist to protect you except insofar as it is financially worthy given the risk assessed legal and social climate; your happiness is merely an accidental byproduct whenever it arises. They aren't wise stakeholders in society: they are shareholder lackeys. Whose interests do they have at heart? The capitalists'! Show little mercy with these; they have made their beds.
