title: Party Videos

//Where people gather, videos are shared. Here's a list of videos I like to enjoy with others, and this is a quick way to find out if I fit in.  Reminisce over maymays that elicit strong emotional reactions, pierce unjustified social layers, and rapidly achieve vulnerable honesty. Life's short and I deplore insincere smalltalk: break bread and ice hard. Keep this list short, real, and [[/b/]]ishly Cards-Against-Humanity-esque. Let your human guts hang out.//
