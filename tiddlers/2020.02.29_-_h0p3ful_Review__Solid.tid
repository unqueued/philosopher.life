*[[2020.02.28 - h0p3ful Review: The Halting Problem]]
** Your uncle [[JRE]] continues to think you have a great deal in common with Alia Atreides from Dune as well.

** You are too confident here. I'm not convinced you are charitable enough in your interpretation. 
*** Even though you make good points, you've not covered all the ground you need to cover to dismiss it.
*** It might help to attempt to provide a remodeling of your interlocutor's argument here.
** I'm glad that you have strong feelings and thoughts about this one. It's an expensive one.
*[[2020/02/28 -- Prompted Introspection: While it Lasts]]
** A fine argument. I appreciate your [[stoicism]].
*** Pushing back, I want to point out that many people conveniently define what isn't possible. The modality of "can" matters, and honest, reasonably complete evaluations are rare. 
**** I can't tell you how many times I have heard "that's not possible" as a confabulatory last resort argument from the purposefully incompetent.
*[[2020/02/28 -- Life Log]]
** Good. Thank you for giving a solid run-down. 
*[[2020/02/28 -- Wiki Log]]
** I agree: you should spend more time on self-care. 
*** I'm convinced the [[.tmpl]]s will be useful to you here, among other things.
** I'm glad that your writing has gotten more formal too. It's much easier to tone it down than tone it up, imho. And, in fact, those formal skills can provide tools for being precisely (almost overworked) informal. 
*** In the end, you will need to be able to speak many languages and accents. There's no way around it. 
** You have to aim for breadth too, not just depth. You are going to sound stupid all the time. That's okay.
*** I have so little room to talk, of course. I primarily discuss what interests me. 
*** I'm okay with the way you are picking out what you will write on for now.  I think this is something which you can expand in time.
** It's okay that you will talk more than is written. I think that's one of the strengths of doing this together, real-time.
*[[2020/02/28 -- To-Do List Log]]
** Being social will be valuable. We talked a bit about that during our dialecture.
*** You have some big decision to make in the coming months.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Nothing. Let's keep trying. I hope a year from now, there will always be something in your [[Yearly Cross-section]].
