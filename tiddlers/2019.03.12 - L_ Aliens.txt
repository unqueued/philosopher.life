Hey [[h0p3]]. I just wanted to say that I love you and that I hope you’re having a good day so far.
TUE 6:29 PM
Hey [[L]]!
TUE 7:55 PM
Yeah, it's been a good day.
TUE 7:55 PM
I love you too!
TUE 7:55 PM
How have you been?
TUE 7:56 PM
Enjoying all the birthdays?
TUE 7:56 PM
Haha, I’m trying too. I’ve been better. Still feeling the blues about work. My attempt at optimism has only gotten me this far. I forget too often that optimism is only a bandaid sometimes. I think I’ve just decided to look for another job.
TUE 8:52 PM
But other than that I’m good — I have good friends and family to help me keep my head on straight.

TUE 8:54 PM
I hear ya.
TUE 8:54 PM
I'm sorry. =(
TUE 8:54 PM
Watching Aliens for the first time — I think I love the way the 70’s depicted future technology.
TUE 8:54 PM
Omg!
TUE 8:54 PM
The best.
TUE 8:54 PM
I'm a huge fan.
TUE 8:54 PM
How far you into it?
TUE 8:55 PM
Lol... that comic is the story of my life. And there’s nothing to be sorry about. I think I needed this journey, in a way, to help me realize I’m not as incompetent as I think I am.
TUE 8:55 PM
I’m really enjoying it so far.
TUE 8:55 PM
Well, I applaud looking for another job.
TUE 8:55 PM
I think it will be a valuable contribution to your identity.
TUE 8:56 PM
Two guys are dead so far — they just asked the computer Mother about their objective and she called them expendable.
TUE 8:57 PM
The use of silence in that movie is tremendous.
TUE 8:57 PM
It's art.
TUE 8:57 PM
The xenomorphs represent something special to me.
TUE 8:58 PM
Oh definitely
TUE 8:58 PM
What brought you to watching Alien?
TUE 8:59 PM
Oh man, the science dude is a robot
TUE 8:59 PM
THE TWIST
TUE 8:59 PM
=)
TUE 8:59 PM
Some friends wanted to watch it — particularly one that was upset that most of us hadn’t seen it lol
TUE 8:59 PM
Sounds like some good friends.
TUE 9:01 PM
They are good friends. The type I can just coexist with and not feel obligated to entertain. Those are my favorite kind.
TUE 10:33 PM
Aye. I find entertaining draining, and not for reasons I find acceptable. Price-efficiency in interactions with others is a non-trivial factor in how relationships grow.
TUE 10:35 PM
I consider my best friends to be those who can spend their social capital with me for my sake with consistency. I am continually moved by the way in which my brother [[JRE]] will ask me to wrestle or force me to look in the mirror, however painful it may be, because he genuinely loves me. There is a special kind of awe I have for that kind of generosity from my brother. That kind of friendship has a fierce love at the core.
TUE 10:38 PM
Sometimes I wish I could bottle that kind of love and give it to people who really need it. It is a rare thing indeed.
TUE 11:09 PM
I assume with time and practice you will.
TUE 11:10 PM
Still something I'm working to achieve!
