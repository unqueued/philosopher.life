title: 2019.10.28 - Prompted Introspection: I Really Like Me, Sally

!! What do you like most about yourself?

Lol: [[2017.05.18 - Prompted Introspection Log]]. This is off topic,<<ref "s">> but this answer appears ahead of its time to me, or prototypical. It is a reminder of the reach of {[[About]]}. 

Currently, I like that I'm at least marginally useful to lots of people. I can't say I do it well, but there's something there. I've long planned to be a janitor for over half my life now (fun fact), and that has been an important lens for me. It's weird to see I'll be losing my place in the world when we move, but I'm hoping to find another. I've done it before, and I can do it again. Most of my life can be found in [[m16]] anyway. I am a mobile-hikki.
