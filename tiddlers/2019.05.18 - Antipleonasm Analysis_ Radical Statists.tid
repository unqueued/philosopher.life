title: 2019.05.18 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Radical Statists

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
There are no conservatives in the United States. The United States does not have a conservative tradition. The people who call themselves conservatives, like the Heritage Foundation or Gingrich, are believers in -- are radical statists. They believe in a powerful state, but a welfare state for the rich.
<<<

They believe in a state as the primary vector of suppressing rebellion against the injustices of capitalism. It provides enough political theater and information-overload to provide the reasonable semblance of doubt that it's a complete sham; it's an oligopolized wrapper which doesn't actually represent the will of the people in any meaningful respect. [[Saint Chomsky]] may have a problem with statism to some extent, and of course, he does a good job pointing out "conservative" hypocrisy. I am not against a powerful state, but I'm against a powerful state which doesn't represent us all fairly. The elite wield the state over the proletariat. We are harnessed by a trojan horse to subsidize the wealthy, to enable them to externalize costs onto us as they privatize power. It's an intentional expression of the Rand-Locke memeplex in the dialectic. 

I am, of course, convinced that a justified mousetrap can be built. It would require something quite radical to defeat them at this point.
