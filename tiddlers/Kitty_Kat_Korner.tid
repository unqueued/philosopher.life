title: Kitty Kat Korner

//Finally, a KKK I can respect and join. As a potential role-model, I advocate weed and catnip. I seek external evidence of functionalist Daseinic activity emitting from the internal qualiatic beetleboxes of my cats. As far as humans go, I'm a cat-person; in contrast, I want to know if my cats are actual cat-persons. I aim to imagine their existentialism.//
