!! Audit:

* Hrmm...I still like part of that poem.
* I think [[/b/]] is a monument to how poorly I've constructed my workflow and organization (ironically, I know) in [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]].
* I'm aching to rabbithole more. I need to. I would very much like to be in a position to blissfully engage in the non-log project based sections of [[The Remodeling]]. Being high opens the well of [[hope]] and curiosity like nothing else.
** I've clearly been abusing caffeine and alcohol instead. These are very poor substitution attempts.
** I still haven't touched the ketamine. Ugh. =(
* Fascinating to see [[h0p3's Log]] like health content in here. I've never had a migraine like that before.
* Paranoia sits on the shelf.
