title: 2020.03.28 - Wiki Review: Proclamations

* [[Aesthetics]]
** So, it's a pile of shit, but I didn't even get through the whole thing for the presentation. Rapidpace for an hour, but there's too much to say. The discussion was outstanding.

** It's interesting to see her censor it. It's her wiki. Technically, this is not ground I agree to cede, but I want to cede it. I'm glad she's opinionated about it. Good.
* [[Product Review: Plenty Vape]]
** Edited. I don't have many products worth reviewing. So far, weed and jerking off. Lol.
* [[2020.03.27 - Wiki Review: Overbearing Sumbitch]]
** I think that extra space was useful to your daughter. 
** Still many oofs in here. =/
* [[2020.03.27 - TDL: Cutting Cucumbers With My Feet]]
** Nope. She doesn't want any desk changes. Alrighty. We can do it later if she wants.
* [[2020.03.27 - Prompted Introspection: Mostly Evil]]
** Hrm. I'd like to hear [[R!]]'s thoughts on this too.
* [[2020.03.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Freshly Squeezed Penis Sauce]]
** Shit. I don't remember, and I didn't finish it.
* [[2020.03.27 â€“ h0p3ful Review: Rounded Depictions]]
** Some of my son's proclamations shake me to the core.
