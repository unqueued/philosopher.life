He has a smooth storytelling style, as usual. It's a fun book, as usual. I like the premise, as usual. It has clearly been researched to some extent, as usual. 

I'm having a tough time believing this makes any sense. We don't hear nearly enough in the beginning about the insanity that would be unleashed Earthside. It's too calm. I also don't think trying to live in space has any merit. This is stupid. It's obvious that subterrainian living would be the primary pursuit. Thus, somehow, the premise of the book is dumb to me.

Here's what is actually interesting to me about the book: The world is ending, and how should I feel about it? There appear to be an elite few who will survive, and how should I feel about them? This book forces me back into my eschatalogical perspectives, requiring me to think about my own world's collapse. Thus, perhaps it is truly fine literature.
