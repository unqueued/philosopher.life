[10:34 PM] h0p3: I've been quietly following for a while. I'm a formally trained analytic philosopher and a computer addict. I'm a Rawlsian Marxist. I'm also very interested in the moral and technical notions of decentralizing power. I keep a wiki where I openly speak with people, including penpals. https://philosopher.life/ (it is much bigger than it looks, and it is well suited to being hosted on a blockchain...the entire thing fits inside a single file). If you are interested in developing a personal relationship with me (I'm positive we would have a great deal to speak about), feel free to hit me up.

[6:36 AM] The Blockchain Socialist: Hey, thanks for reaching out! Sure we can schedule a call at some point if you want :slight_smile:
[6:37 AM] The Blockchain Socialist: I'll be gone for the weekend but maybe we can try some time next week?
[6:37 AM] The Blockchain Socialist: Which time zone are you in?
[8:45 PM] h0p3: Okay, cool. I can VC. Eastern, US.

[11:30 PM] h0p3: Bump. :slight_smile:

[12:03 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Hey sorry been busy
[12:03 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Are you free on Saturday or Sunday?
[1:49 PM] h0p3: Yes. I can speak on either day. Saturday is my preference
[2:00 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Ok cool I’m not 100% sure on my schedule that day so I can message you when I’m available?
[2:07 PM] h0p3: I will be running around on Saturday. I am not in a rush, so we can message for availability. We will meet when we can.
[2:11 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Great talk to you then!

[4:20 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Hey are you around?
[7:01 PM] h0p3: Hey, dude. I'm here. 4:20 timestamp. Noice.
[7:02 PM] h0p3: Day got more hectic than I anticipated. My wife got sick and had an extra round of grocery shopping than I anticipated. Sorry for not answering sooner; I like that we can speak asynchronously too*.
[7:34 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Ah sorry it's getting a bit late for me now since I'm in CET
[7:34 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Can you do tomorrow?
[7:36 PM] h0p3: Yeah, that would be great. I have Family Time (https://philosopher.life/#Family%20Time.tmpl), but we will pause so I can speak with you tomorrow.
