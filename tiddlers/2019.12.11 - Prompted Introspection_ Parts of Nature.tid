title: 2019.12.11 - Prompted Introspection: Parts of Nature

!! What parts of nature do you like best?

I'm not sure what doesn't count as natural. I'm going to artificially narrow the word in this case. I like the smell of the Appalachian forests, I like the look of water of almost any kind (especially moving water), the sound of rain (especially when it's hot outside; I open windows and doors to hear it), and the food. Food probably beats everything for me.<<ref "b">> There are plenty of days I don't leave the house, but there aren't many days I don't eat.
