title: 2018.06.26 - Wiki Audit: Feedback

Wow. I got way more feedback than I thought I would. I now have 3 people to write responses to. They are clearly intelligent people, and I owe them the best reasons I can give them. It is the moral law, good sir!

LS is actively engaged in something like my work. I hope we can be peers.

WookieNeo and I may not share a ton in common besides a love for technology, and that will make it difficult to appreciate the narrative I have. It's possible I may not learn much from this person (although, they are clearly smart!), and even if that's the case (could easily not be), I hope I can be of some use to them.

Josiah has me shaking in my boots. For preliminary contrast, I got trashtalked by a genius-clown in /r/sneerclub, which didn't worry me too much because their trollish argument clearly lacked charity to an extreme degree (I believe I see where they are coming from too). Josiah, however, clearly took the time to understand me. Josiah was open, technically proficient with the wiki, and came closest of anyone except my wife (and possibly my daughter and brother) at interpreting this artwork engine as I intended! That this person could just walk up and immediately see it is both gratifying and terrifying! I do not know what this means. I feel surprisingly naked in front of this stranger, and that does not happen often to me. As I promised, I'm giving real thought to this person's words. I hope they won't be annoyed that I'm going to take at least a day to respond. They deserve more than my gut instinct.
