title: 2019.03.08 - Phil Nunnally: Lived-In Mindpalace

Dear Phil,

It's great to hear from you, nomad. I wasn't sure if you would be interested in talking to this desert madman. It's awesome to talk with you from wiki to wiki. May we be entangled branches of rhizomatic vines.

<<<
[[h0p3]],

Thank you for your [[letter on 2019-01-26|https://philosopher.life/#2019.01.26%20-%20Phil%20Nunnally%3A%20Quietly%20Watching]]! I only found it recently, figuring that I would be way under your radar, but I'm happy that I turned out not to be.
<<<

I'm not terribly good at finding other wikis. I'm delighted to watch yours grow. Also, the Wargames splash is sick, homie. I am a fan of anything which celebrates computers and hackers, and I grew up on that movie. Your street cred is automagically, like, yay high with me just in virtue of it.

<<<
You probably know by now that you and [[Sphygmus]] have spawned a host of admirers and tiddler-borrowers.
<<<

It's awesome to see [[others]] engaged in making wikis. It's a great place to share, be it our lives or methods, with ourselves and others. I am obviously obsessed with wikis, but I consider myself a beginner in the mechanics of TW. I'm sure I will learn quite a bit from you in how to use this tool. Also, I am beyond envious that you get to use BTC's TW5-Navigator. I remember talking to BTC when it was first in development, and I've waited for so long to use it in my wiki. It kills me that I can't use it; it breaks too many things. =(

I [[hope]] wikis and owning our data (and to some [[dok]] our identities) spread like wildfire. The barrier to entry is a bit steep.<<ref "vm">> I still can only do the basics myself, lol. 

<<<
I remember the moment in January that I ran across the first conversations between you and [[Jack Baty|jbaty]], and thinking to myself that this was the first truly new thing I had seen on the internet in years â€” maybe the first new thing since RSS feeds burst onto the scene. And it's not because of some brand-new technological breakthrough, because TiddlyWiki has been around for literally well over a decade. But some pieces of cosmic flint knocked together in just the right way that this method of note-taking, recording, writing, refactoring, sharing, dusting off, editing, and re-shelving has clicked with a number of us. 
<<<

It still feels constantly new to me. The novelty has not worn off even after writing for a while now. I am baffled why I didn't start doing this earlier. As [[you have mentioned|https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html#2019-03-07%20Anton%20Zuiker%3A%20the%20power%20of%20overlapping%20networks]], I probably wouldn't have been ready (although, come to think of it, I still don't feel ready all too often, lol). I'm fortunate to have more and more TW examples to think about. There aren't enough in the wild.

<<<
Strangely (or not?), the more that a wiki is written for the person writing it, the more interesting it seems to be, for me at least. Jack [[wrote earlier today|https://rudimentarylathe.org/#2019.03.05%20-%20Journal]]:

> I've noticed that recently I've been organizing this wiki according to how //I// want to find things and less so that //other// people can find them. I'm unsure if this is a bad idea, but since I consider this place to be mostly for my records, it feels like the right approach. 

...and I feel the same about your wiki (and mine)! So much of yours is inscrutable to me, and I'm still trying to decipher how the Wiki Audits and Wiki Reviews work, but that will become more clear over time. No rush to figure it out.
<<<

I find our lived-in-mindpalace chicken-scratch messiness, strong points of view, and qualia-pointing fascinating.<<ref "d">> It's not just humble or charming, and I think it's more than just the authenticity. It's rare to have an opportunity to see someone's image of the structures of their thought meant for themselves. I like to hear them think to themselves mixed with writing to others. If something that looks as plain (dare I say sometimes even ugly?) as TW can still be this interesting, the content and structure must be doing some serious work.

You may find quite a bit of my wiki inscrutable. Lol. Sorry. I think of [[Wiki Audit]] and [[Wiki Review]] as being some of the best documented (and most long-term) processes on this wiki. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll try to clarify whatever I can.

<<<
https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html#2019-03-05%20Sphygmus%3A%20invisible%20legs%20of%20my%20wiki

I feel like I need to level up and get to this level. Most of my TW is just dumping everything into a tiddler every day. I could stand to see some patterns and impose some structure to all this stuff.
<<<

I'm pumped to see where you go and how you do it. TW is well-suited for it, but it might also be one of the hardest things to do on the wiki, imho. Maybe 1 in 10 projects survive for me (and that might be optimistic). Some structures and processes, like [[APFVD]], seem to be solidifying for me, and I have no idea how I would replace or do without them. I think everyone has to figure large sections of how to do it on their own; it's likely highly particularized to our contexts.

I am still convinced that links and tiddlers are the fundamental building blocks. I try to only add other tools in virtue of them. I find many TW users pursue TW mechanics more voraciously. That might be the right thing to do. Sometimes it's more fun to tweak and explore the tool than to use it. I'm probably slow and foolishly obstinate here. I wish I knew how to think about the problem(s) better. When push comes to shove, I'd rather add content to the wiki than anything else. The necessity of convenience will generally present itself after doing the manual labor long enough.

<<<
I just don't know if I can/could be a good public self-modeler. I only put a sliver of my life and thoughts into my wiki, and just that small amount has grown far beyond what I thought it would when I started with an empty TiddlyWiki file and thought, "I wonder what I can do with this..." For me, for now, it's more than enough to know that a half-dozen people are interested enough in the minutiae I put in here that they come back more than once! I'm still surprised every day, honestly.
<<<

Roger. I'll be interested to see if you change your mind. Admittedly, for many kinds of reasons, we can't model ourselves all the way down in our wikis. I'd be interested to know if [[your private wiki|https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html#2019-01-25%20response%20to%20Amit%20and%20Brad%20on%20Micro.blog%20re%20TiddlyWiki]] ends up growing far larger.

<<<
I'm thankful that you had the confidence in the potential for slow back-and-forth (and in me) that you threw up a flare and would wait this long for me to see it. Such a different way of operating than the hyper-instant feedback loop of post something, someone else sees it in seconds, and then you see in a few more seconds that they saw it and liked it. [[Micro.blog|https://micro.blog]] broke me of that rewardless habit and I have no interest in returning to it.
<<<

It feels different to me as well. It's weird how much slower TW communications feel even when I'm frenetically using this tool. I spend most of my time communicating to myself, and it can take a long time for me to finally see what I'm telling myself. I've never seen anything like it. Perhaps I'm foolishly counting my chickens before they hatch, but I am excited by what these wikis will be like a decade from now. What will 30,000 tiddlers feel like?

<<<
Regarding your [[Music: Library|https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library]], I //love// it.
<<<

That is high praise, thank you. You might find [[TV: Library]] and [[Film: Library]] interesting as well.

<<<
 I'm compelled to do the same just out of appreciation for so many gems released into the world by artists.
<<<

I love when people work to pick out what is [[salient]]. I've been [[exploring|Music Exploration]] your playlists. I ended up using http://www.playlist-converter.net/ to convert and import [[your list|https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html#favorite%20songs%20ever]] to Spotify.

<<<
And I have to say I'm glad to see you organize your music list by the first letter of the artist's first name (when there is a first name).
<<<

Currently, I'm filing by hand. It makes it easier. I really need to give the list another judgment pass. It's a fairly stable list, but I want it to crystallize as much as it ought.

<<<
Apple ruined it for everyone with the artist sorting in iTunes, and I figure: Why fight it?
<<<

Because you care about your data, identity, and what you believe is [[salient]]. Hypocritically, I am a rabid opponent of most tech companies (actually, most current companies).

<<<
But seriously, other than my attachment to physical vinyl LPs, it's hard to keep a physical attachment to music stored in digital media.
<<<

I hear that. It has taken many years to let go of physical codex books. I am a hoarder (surprise!). Thousands slowly dwindle to a couple hundred. It has been a painful and maybe unintuitive transition to increasingly embrace the abstraction and ephemeral-feeling of digital media. Tangibility does serious emotional work in my lizard brain. I continue to try to break myself of it where fitting (to varying degrees of success).

<<<
I do have a pretty hefty library of FLAC files on a Raspberry Pi in the basement, and I can get to those anytime, but it's more interesting as I get older to record details about what music I found when, how I found it, and which music has stuck with me over the years. I'm about to unleash my "favorite songs ever" tiddler, which is similar to your Music: Library. Once you have practically endless hard drive storage, or the ability to stream almost anything you don't own, the value of all this music goes down. And then the attention and time it takes to listen to the music becomes the scarce thing.
<<<

Yes! Hoarding is easy. The desensitizing flood of everything creates a flatness; I drown in meaning until it is meaningless. Finding what really matters is so hard. Open and purposeful exploration of the desert is required. Curating maximum [[S2NR]] is expensive; time is of the essence. I must wrestle my {[[focus]]} away from attention merchants; trust is at the heart of how I [[hope]].<<ref "t">>

It's cool to see you track this information. I'm not sure what I'm trying to put my finger on, but it reminds me of something. It's something like birdwatching journals. There's a storied history to the science of improving the process.

<<<
https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html#2019-03-11%20this%20week's%20projects

Oh god this is getting out of control. No wonder I never look at my project list.
<<<

My daughter and I laughed. That's what our wikis and lives feel like. We joked recently that we should collect all of our failed [[TDL]]'s, it would be epic. As in life, I suppose, there are so many unfinished things on the wiki. It's becoming a warm blanket of denial. Yeah, yeah, I'll get to that, maybe, whenever, possibly, probably not, who cares, whatever I can make work is what I've got I guess. 

<<<
https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html#2019-03-05%20Sphygmus%3A%20invisible%20legs%20of%20my%20wiki

Most of my TW is just dumping everything into a tiddler every day. I could stand to see some patterns and impose some structure to all this stuff.
<<<

Seems like you are well on your way. I didn't start using Tags until last year, and only because several folks generously made me look. Some of the things you are building in your wiki took me a long time to figure out (I'm slow though).

<<<
https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html#i3

Wow. Saw h0p3 mention this in a letter to KK. He also has an i3 tiddler.

After seeing the screenshots, this makes so much more sense than a bunch of overlapping windows, although it seems way over my head.
<<<

If you like TW5-Navigator, you will like i3. I am no expert with the tool, but I couldn't live without it. I have a terribly hard time imagining it being over your head. You clearly have decades of exploring under your belt. The docs are short, clear, and accurate. Having an example config to reason about helps a ton (at least in my experience). I had to wrestle for a day to get my kiddos to take the leap with me, but within an hour, they were using it just fine (and were glad to be rid of KDE). It might feel daunting at first, but  eventually you'll find your config is set and rarely changed except to add a tool here or there (though perhaps when I become more adept, I may find another learning curve I didn't realize was there).

<<<
https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html#2019-03-12%20h0p3%20on%20VPNs%20and%20work%20computers

I so badly want to have my wiki open all day long at work. It would be so much more fun to drop stuff in it when I'm thinking about it, but I just can't do it. Even ~~if~~ WHEN I move it to DigitalOcean and can write to it all day long, I have to firewall (heh, sorry) my wiki and personal stuff away from my work computing. I usually do this anyway, but I need to be even better about it. There are of course the attention, productivity, and integrity reasons, but also because there's just no need to litter my traffic at work with anything that looks remotely interesting to anyone else there.
<<<

It's much simpler if you are allowed to use your own devices at work. I assume you may have fairly stringent restrictions at your workplace though. Using their devices is always a risk. You can obfuscate your traffic if you really wanted, but I assume they monitor everything at this point. Many times I've had to hijack my work machines with USBs, including wireless to coffeeshops (could just tether now); you could skin/rice your desktops to look like your regular work machines too. It's been a long time. I don't trust the machines or the people at this point.

I assume a work-wiki could be useful though. 

My internet connection has improved these past couple months (not sure why my ISP is changing). With Bob, I can now sync tids. I'm not sure it is relevant enough though. The only time I would really need it would be when I'm not on my own machine, but the only time I don't have one of my [[monsters]]...is basically never. If I'm a serious pinch, I can always grab the singlefile, edit it, and push. 

It can be handy just to SSH into my machine to drop a file instead. I realize many people actually write their wikis from outside their wiki. This is extremely uncommon for me. The wiki is a Quine-like IDE, and I want to seal together how I read and how I write the wiki as much as possible (it has already peeled apart more than I'd like just to have Bob). 

Lastly, I also multi-device message myself in a pinch. Sometimes I even have to dictate to my phone. I can't wait for the day when speech-to-text will be [[completely locally run|https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/an-all-neural-on-device-speech.html]] (some devices do it better than others) with extremely high-accuracy (especially for all the weird things I might say) and correct syntax. Again and again, I find that when I am rabbitholing hard, even typing is too high a cognitive load (and I am strong typist<<ref "2019.03.17">>). I am so ready to frictionlessly talk with an external representation of myself.<<ref "n">>

Take care, and please take your time responding, if you ever feel moved to. I'm sure not winning any awards for fast correspondence around here, and I never want anyone to feel pressured to reciprocate.
