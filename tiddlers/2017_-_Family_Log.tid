!! Audit:

* I must continue to find ways to encourage my children to communicate with others, to socialize, and to engage in the world around them. We talk about the fact that they live in a bubble all the time, but I fear we don't do enough about it.
* It's sad to see us struggle with the same things after a year. I fear we do not make significant progress on our habits and baser instincts.
* I'm glad we narrowed down our topics, although I'm worried it still isn't quite right. I appreciate that we try to make it tangible and quantifiable while still giving room for a qualitative analysis. I wouldn't say we have a ton of depth to what we do though.
** I'm not being fair to us. We have evolved. We've made huge improvements. It can't be perfect, and it isn't going to change all at once.
* We really have integrated the wikis into our lives more effectively. I hope we continue to do so.
* Lol. It's obvious that I have some projects that just take me forever to actually "just do." Ugh, it's painful to see it.
* My children have not been loving our Sunday Family Meetings for a long time. They like aspects, but when it comes to the accountability phase, it's not a pleasure.
* The work problem is still here. I feel quite a bit like a failure. I have a thousand fish to fry, and it doesn't seem to be coming together fast enough.
* I need to practice my "Just-do-it-iveness"
* We all worked hard last year. It's obvious.
* Our weekly planning has been a good thing, although I cannot say we have learned to become more adept at following through and doing it. I'd argue we've simply become better at picking out what we claim we are doing to do.
* It's weird to see EQ and the dryer problem fixed at the same time. Both were problems.
* My son has spells of feeling clumsy. Growing, yes. Autism, yes. We're going to get there.
* I can see my naivete in job hunting. I'm still going about it all wrong. It's painful to see. When I see a system that wants to use me, I just want to use it right back. I don't want to be a hypocrite, a capitalist, or someone who uses others as mere means.
* I can't believe we've been doing this log for almost a year. That is awesome!
** It evolved into a very serious event each Sunday. After church, we get together and spend our day thinking about our week and the week to come; we connect; we talk to about what matters (or we try!).
* I can see that we have been under enormous stress.
** I need to get us to a point where we aren't stressed. Where it flows. Where stress is a good thing, but not a overbearing one.
* We have a shotgun approach. We keep throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. I'm glad that we do not give up. 
* My son very rarely melts down, and even when he does, it is generally fairly simple.
* We took up unschooling by necessity. It failed, but we need to try again. We have to find a way for them to shape themselves and their destiny. I want them to be autonomous. How do I get there?
** I have to have the accountability elements. At the moment, we work together to select (although, I have far more of a say than they do).
* We have had some very rough points.
* This has been a really hard year. Jesus.
* We need another leap forward.
* It's been sad to see that my work as a pipefitter was only half useful to me, although it did get us over the financial hump.
* I really want to make enough money that we continue to do planned activities on Saturdays. It sucks that we don't.
* We need to get everyone to the dentist, and I need to find a way for my wife to continually see the doctor. Stress is likely the most problematic issue though.
* When I'm not working for money, I'm working on family life. It shows too. The kids do so much better when I'm there.
* We built art and stories together. I'm glad to see we are consuming similar media and growing a common language. 
* I can see that I apply the most pressure in our family upon all of us. =/
* I'm not the only way that slowly achieves their projects at times. I hope I can get us all to just "dive in" more effectively.
** My daughter has this too. I think it is our perfectionism.
* My wife compliments me often on being a good host/housekeeper. Lol. I am a homemaker; it's true.
* I've made some edits.
* I'm really pleased to see how much we care about each other in these logs. We have really worked at it. I love our bond.
* Good job, mate.
