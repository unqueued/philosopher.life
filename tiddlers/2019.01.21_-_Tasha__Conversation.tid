We played some physical door tag. We sat at her doorstep talking (me, her, and Esteban). What was probably only going to take 4 seconds ended up being a 4 hour conversation. We went over a ton of ethics, epistemology, moral psych, political philosophy, existentialism, and our lives. 

Esteban is almost as suspicious, pessimistic, and jaded as I am. I appreciate how often he immediately sees what I'm saying. Considering his background, I'm impressed (or I've not understood the [[dok]] he understands...but he makes too many inferential moves correctly to not have a generalized concept). Previously a dealer, we have a lot to talk about when he's interested in talking. I think he's most interested in talking when Tasha is there.

Tasha aims to be a good person, and she really wants to believe everyone around her is as good as she is. We spoke primarily about her life for the conversation. Tasha is open and quick. I can see why she has escaped the ghetto. The pain of her situation is hard to bear. I don't think she is morally obligated as far as she does (and that's saying something because I hold people to high standards). She does not know how to interpret the people around her, imho. She can spot obvious evil affectively, but she doesn't reason far enough in her exploration of evil. I like Tasha; there is an event which has changed her, and I see why. Her suffering has caused her to know what matters far more than before. Her life in banking is over and for good reason.

Overall, I admire their stamina. I kept blasting them with mile-high technical answers, thought-experiments, and dot-connecting that most people would be too tired to explore in such a timeframe.

I may also may have a source via their family in Colorado, which I've lacked for over 3 years now (I can't believe how long it has lasted me). I'm a ridiculously Spartan user.
