title: 2020.01.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Forget Your Plans

* I didn't really wake up fully today.
** Zoned in and out.
* That joke about how men are pansies when they get sick, it must be true about me too. I stayed in bed the entire fucking day.
** I had a lot I wanted to do.
*** Even the wiki work didn't get done. I was a lump of mucus.
**** Instead, I read and wrote pure garbage. It fit nicely.
* Still feel like garbage, but I'm not having the breathing problem I had last night.
** Why did it ramp up so fast? That is unlike me. Felt more like allergies mixed with constriction (but not the pain, just the shallowness of breath) of asthma. 
* Cleaning
* Offspring made dinner: tendies, salad, wedges
* We've been having dinner in my room because that is the only room in the house with a lick of furniture.
* [[k0sh3k]] had a busy day. 
** She slept like garbage too, and my coughing did not help. Half-brained, twitchy, woke every 40 minutes. That woman needs sleep badly tonight.
** That paperwork we did made her day easy.
*** Need to set up Yale's VPN for her.
** Interestingly, as long as I don't make much money, my offspring's cost to go to Yale would be $6k/year they say. Costs will skyrocket if I make what I'm worth.
*** Getting in is the hard part. They may not even choose to go (or be able to go if WWX continues to spin out of control). 
*** Still appears to be a ridiculously awesome opportunity, and we've not even scratched the surface.
* Finished //The Truman Show//.
** It is rare that my daughter thanks me for a movie. =)
* Clean
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 2
** Tried earlier, but ugh. So much snot.
