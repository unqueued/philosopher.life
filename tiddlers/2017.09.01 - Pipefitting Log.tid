title: 2017.09.01 - Pipefitting Log

I decided I've got to be myself on the job. I'm working on it. I often avoid trying to have any conversation in which I will be asked what I did before this job. It's very common to be asked "how long I've been fitting," and then they will be surprised it has only been for 8 months (and professionally for only 2 months when they inquire). Inevitably, many go on to ask me what I did before I worked as a pipefitter. It is obvious to them that I'm not normal, that I'm not one of the usual suspects, that I don't quite make sense. They know I'm smart; it bleeds out of me even when I try to hold it in.<<ref "1">> When people get close enough to me, when I'm open about what I'm thinking, etc., people tend to have strong reactions to it; it is very often an intelligence-related issue.<<ref "2">> In any case, I don't like answering this question with these people. Don't get me wrong, I'm not ashamed of what I've done (I'm proud even), and I can often forge interesting relationships with it. However, in many cases, contexts, and scenarios, with at least some people, I receive very negative responses. They don't like people like me. I'm a liberal, etc. (and I'm far left of that actually). So, I want people to know but at least not give me shit for it. And, sometimes it can help. In any case, at least make it so I can be myself. It went well enough today, at least for now. I'm hoping it will be a positive thing that people know who I am in at least an acquaintance level way. I don't want to be hurt, and I want to be happy.

I worked with Chris-M on the header again.

I found three extensions and a 3/4-to-1" converter for the torque wrench.

Jeff, a journeyman, doesn't know how to set a torque wrench.

We torqued it in a star pattern, starting at 300 foot-pounds, then 450, then 600 (increment of 25% starting at 50%). Tanya, the QC, saw it. 

I calculated the weight of the flange piece and then the entire spool. 10,300 lbs. I reminded Chris-M to tell the operator.

I marked the center lines of nozzles/saddles on the side for our mounting of the header on the saddles. We needed to make sure the tie-in points would fitup perfectly.

!! Break!

Upon a question from Chris-M, I did some measuring and noticed the flange was taller than the support. After more measuring, I figured out it was going to hit the concrete riser underneath the support. This was a huge problem, an engineering mistake that may be costly. I told Dave, and Dave said to let it happen. He wanted the bosses and QC to see it in person. He believed me, but that was his response. He knew it was a big problem. 

 
I saw Dave's notebook. I am on the right track. He saves his ass the "hole" time. It's all business too. I'm thinking I need to keep two logs, one personal and the other professional. Professional is something I can protect my ass with, limit my liability, win any he-said, she said, and have organized concise thought about what happened for meetings, elevator speeches, pitches, and any other ammo-requiring contexts. Document interactions that are important and all conflicts or problems. However, I still need to plan and digest this at a personal and more private level. Hence, two logs. This is no small task. I will take practice.

On the flip for our rigging, the two pipes rolled in different directions. Our fitup was ruined. Something is very wrong. We are all very surprised it rolled. It's a big deal. It shouldn't do that. We did it according to spec. Should it be possible for that to happen? We had to use our chain falls to make the flip (the riggers did). That's when it happened. We still aren't sure. The only way to eliminate that would be by making sure we got the fitup perfect in the staging area before we rigged it straight into the support system. Otherwise, we will always be forced to roll it on the rigging, which may cause that twist/roll in the header itself. 

Lucas saw me writing. He asked about it. I told him. He recommended I become a construction manager. 

Chris-M said not to write in front of the bosses. He said they'd run me off the job.

I hit my head hard on a hanging pipe. I wasn't looking closely enough to where I was going. I need to be more careful.

They moved the header out of the supports and cribbing. I don't understand why. They need to break off concrete, but why not make the fix where it was and lift it to bust the concrete? Worth the time, I think. They could have moved it one foot over from the side of the support and be set. Conversely, they could have just moved it off the first support anyways. Having 2 supports instead of 3 + cribbing is still wildly better than that unsafe way we do it against the train tracks. 

!! Lunch!

We can't do shit, not even with QC, on the return header (the main part). The bosses and engineers need to figure out what to do now. 

So.... we are working on another piece of the header, trying to at least do something.

Jeff pulled me aside after I asked to borrow his snips again (he asked why, and I explained). He told me I was going places and that I'd go far. He said he had been watching me and figuring out what I was thinking about. He said I take initiative. I have mixed feelings. I like compliments, but I prefer them from people I respect. I thanked him. I will think about it.

I rigged the flange. One of the main journeyman riggers came over and said it was good. He handed me his shackle to complete it. I then cut rubber softener and rigged the side of the header because Chris-M wants to slide it to make space for the flange. 

Also, the room at level 3 in 290 is so hot that it felt like it cooked my lungs. I had to hold my breath to pass through it. 

After they placed the header back at the tracks, I measured the pipe against the centerline. It was close but acceptable. Dave saw me do it and went on to move the pipe further away from the tracks. 

!! Break!

QC complained about washers in the morning. I was asked (as was Lucas) to get a 24" Victaulic kit and 24" bolt'n'gasket kit. Dave thought we were taking too long, and I explained it was because we were looking for washers. He said we didn't need them. An hour later, he checked the drawings again (which is what I was going to do, but didn't [I should have]) and said we needed washers. Lol.

Philosophical point: To what extent is "taking pride in your work" equivalent to being picky as hell (in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, and so on and so forth, etc.)? 

I painted the kits with anti-seize bolt butter, but by 4:00 I realized it wasn't happening. I explained to Dave that I wanted to keep them together in the Connex (?) for next week. He agreed, especially since he planned to do that first immediately next week.

Also, we took down the rigging. We got very little accomplished today.
