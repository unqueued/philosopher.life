* Family Time! I am so excited. I've been waiting all week for it.
** It's not like we don't eat dinner together every night or talk every day, but the ritual is wonderful. 
* Reading and writing. I'd love to see the docket getting cleared off.
* Breakfast for dinner sounds good. We haven't had grits in a while.
** Waiting to shop until we burn through all of our fresh produce. I want to clear out that fridge and waste nothing.
