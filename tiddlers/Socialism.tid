title: Socialism

!! About:

//I listen to those I deem crazy, even the evil ones, because time and time again they have revealed my blindness. So, please, go on, speak the truth, even if your voice shakes. I'm listening.//

A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.

I'm more than obsessed with the topic. It's part of my life's work. As a political animal, it's my cosmopolitan civic duty to support it with gusto. I must have socialist projects that I'm thinking about and implementing. I must attempt to be an architect of socialism in the world. As always, [[ridtyawtr]]. Let's try to be the next Marx in theory and practice.

Capitalists respect your dignity and autonomy proportionally to your market value. Deviation from the norm will be punished unless it is exploitable. We're being enslaved degree by degree like frogs slowly boiled alive,<<ref "c">> and we must riot while we still can.

It's no accident that the wealthiest and most powerful are (spoken or unspoken) opposed to representative democracy, unions, collective bargaining, and decentralizing power structures. The lines between "government," "corporation," and "individual" are blurring to the advantage of our masters who deny we really owe anything to others. Capitalists and Libertarians are enabling the centralization of power; it inevitably leads to monopoly and monopsony. 

Due to the systematic destruction of divergent thinking which doesn't serve the global elite, almost no one who challenges the status quo walks away whole. During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act.<<ref "1">>

Itâ€™s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled. Capitalists are brainwashing you to "consent" to them enslaving you because they believe you deserve nothing better. Are you going to take it? Are you really going to be raped into Stockholm Syndrome? Calls for polite civility are gas-lighting demands for passive submission. Wise up, and reject the Prosperity Teachings of these psychopathic prophets of the Rightist Rand-Locke memeplex.
