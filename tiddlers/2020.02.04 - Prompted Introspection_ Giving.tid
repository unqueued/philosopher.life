title: 2020.02.04 - Prompted Introspection: Giving

!! I wish I could give......

The fitting thanks and responses to the people I know and have known in my life (of course, there are many more answers to this question; I'm just choosing one). I'm particularly indebted to some people I can never see again (they ded), but it's also not always feasible. As I have noted before, it's difficult to thank someone for consequences they didn't intend (or would not believe would be the implications of their initial motivations). That's bittersweet, and it's a gap that generally can't be bridged. 

I wonder what life would mean for us if we all have arbitrary amounts of time to be with each other; that's the kind of wish that might be informative as an ideal. It's there that I see the end of the reflective equilibrium.
