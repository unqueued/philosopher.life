title: 2017.12.14 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Skill Wish

!! What is one skill you wish you had and how would that make your life different?

Oh, my lady, you keep pressing me with different versions of the same question. What do you really need from me? /wink. Of course, some skills are innate/natural, and others are learned. You leave it open in your question. I wish for more wishes, in a sense, by wishing I had permanent eidetic memory, perfect executive functioning, and the brain of a computational God. I'm so unwise, I wouldn't know how to answer your question beyond simply asking to be wise. I hope wisdom includes your beautiful tits.

I will try and give you a more normal Sunday school answer, of course. I wish I learned to be a computer wizard. I don't think I can socialize well enough, in the end, so I won't choose that. Sometimes I can pay attention to certain kinds of detail all at once that few can (and othertimes, I'm glaringly bad at it), and I wish that I really were amazing at computing. I'm too old to be great at it (at least, to my standards). However, I will continue to pursue it.
