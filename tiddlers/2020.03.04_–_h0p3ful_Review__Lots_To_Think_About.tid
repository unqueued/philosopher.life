** Whoa, where are your notes? This is good work. Where are the notes? 
** We are here to practice the writing process. If you didn't take notes, you did it wrong.
*** Did I ever tell you about how I did math (even for college)? I would generally do the problem in my head and write the answer down (though I did learn to show my work minimally). I never quite learned the value of writing out what I was doing well enough; I never had the need for it. It was just faster to not write it down. This was huge mistake from my teachers, and it was something I should have corrected long ago. That's part of what we are doing here. You need to practice constructing the conversation train soup-to-nuts, please. You have the embrace the process, push the edges.
**** So, take the sickest notes you ever could. You'll begin to learn what it means to take notes in a pinch, on-the-fly, and in tight spaces [[irwartfrr]]. We must learn to digest our work as well, to build things upon it, to pick out emerging features, to construct with molecules, etc. You must become virtuous in this, son. 
*[[Books for reading]]
** Capitalize the "R"
** You will have to build lots of empty tiddlers. It's okay. Fill them out when you can or should.
*[[2020.03.03 – h0p3ful Review: Back Up On The Horse]]
** I still need your input here. How much energy should be spent and how much writing do you think we should be engaged in here?
*[[2020.03.03 – Prompted Introspection: I just get stuck.]]
**  "I cannot be wrong" can be interpreted as "it is not the case that I can truthfully evaluated as being wrong" or "it is not the case that I can afford to be wrong" (and perhaps others).
*** Surely, I am the strongest factor in your perfectionism. I'm mean about it too. We can even look at the distinction above. Your dad is fucking crazy here by most standards (he's not perfect enough in how he trains you, lol). Preoccupation with precision and profound anxiety are difficult problems for us. You'll need to continue researching perfectionism, seeing what fits you. A perfectionist actually believes there's something worth perfecting, and it's so fucking painful to see what we can't live up to our ideal. It's painful, freezing, anxiety-inducing, and demotivating.
**** It's not that we don't work to fight what is incorrect about our perfectionism. And, we do draw some practical lines. 
*** I think you aren't always a perfectionist either. You know there are places you can afford to be wrong or wonderful lazy in your life, and sometimes you even choose not to aim (in a direct sense) for anything. That is necessary in many cases. 
**** I'm so poor at this problem I can't give advice which I find to be excellent. I can barely advise myself in this regard. It's a cycle to manage, not something which you aim to break. 
***** There's an urgency we experience which must be handled wisely. 
** You must see that you aren't helpless all the way down, and yet, you must see that you have no control over so much. Connecting the mutable to the immutable is a classic problem.
*[[2020.03.03 – Wiki Review: fuck up fixed.]]
** Remember the Typio Form Recovery will capture information. I think our save-trails also do a similar kind of work in some cases. 
*** It takes a while to get used to our tools, btw. I am beyond awful at this. 
** I want you to see that some of your phrasing is somehow both plain and yet idiosyncratic in a way that others won't be able to interpret it without some friction (you are missing words or making leaps which aren't the norm). We don't sound "natural." I'm so sorry that you will have a difficulty which most do not (and, I'm sorry that I'm a shit teacher in this space). There's only so much you can do about this problem. Sometimes, you must grunt, point, or say it the ugly way because it's the only option. Informality is necessary at times. I think you are trying to find a good balance. The [[Wiki Review]] is a great place to be informal. I like that you feel comfortable saying it your way here.
** Remember to be kind to yourself. Yes, you may have parts of yourself which must be destroyed or changed, but it's not the whole. Be honest, and in this case, make sure you are charitable to what is correct so that what is not correct will stand out more clearly for you. Do not flatten yourself with absolute language without profound consideration; it is a dangerous place (even if it is necessary in many cases).
*[[2020.03.03 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Court]]
** Check your grammar again. 
** It's difficult to build things which are easy to parse for everyone. You can use bullet-points here if you wish (or follow what we talked about).
** This is an important set of problems. Sir Deleuze is probably incorrect about what consists in conceptness (the concept of a concept). He's being too literal, and unfortunately, even his metaphor is may be mistakenly leaving out metaphysics. Son, the man is probably a heathen, a brilliant one. Some of what he points us to is radically correct, though we must figure out what he got wrong for him (is he is holding all the concepts, and one man can only hold or lay so many bricks, right?). 
*** We hold representations of concepts in our heads. My absurd looking position to a large set of philosophers will boil down, in some cases, to the assumption that there is a correspondence. I'm an externalist. The truth-bearer is not inside me, even if I impose, construct, or passively observe my [[phenomenology]], and part of my story exists in virtue of the fact that I have to be telling myself a story to have access to the thing in itself at all. I take this very far, much further than most. You must doubt me here strongly. 
**** At some point, the bricks we have are physical representations of something else which resolves outside ourselves (including outside the set of participants in the language game). The brick, at best, is only a token of that type. Idealism is extremely expensive to reason thoroughly about. 
***** This sort of question separates the trained philosophers from the rest (including the sophists). Most people do not have the epistemic evidence necessary to sufficiently hold a position here. Trained philosophers will often be able to isolate their disagreement together very quickly because of their shared vocabulary (including having walked down similar enough paths through the desert), and they are going to be familiar with their opponents arguments in such a way they can think on their turf, in their terms, etc. with enough empathy and understanding that mutualistic construction is plausible.
*** Alright, it might be a pile of shit he's holding. A shitbrick. Fine.
** He's correct that we can use our understanding of concepts for [[good]] or evil, [[right]] or wrong, [[beauty]] or ugliness, and to shape the being or non-being of the mutable objects around us to some [[dok]]. Do concepts have anything beyond mere instrumental value? Moreover, what concepts select [[salience]] most [[salient]]ly? This is a difficult [[infinigress]]ive bullet to bite.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** You often point out that the main character isn't going to die in stories (we will have a tendency to have a difficult time suspending our disbelief and entering stories in some cases; it's too easy for us to feel like it's not real enough, in a sense). There are many such inferences and tropes to think about. You'll want to collect these rules, of course, but it's important to still find something which is very difficult to speak about in the story.
*** The meaning and purpose of a story stretches to both ends of the dialectic, from the beginning to the the end (which, I am arguing to you is the same destination in the elephant's foot).
** You have made so much progress. Think about the difference between your work this past week and what we see in the [[X-Section]]. It's huge.
