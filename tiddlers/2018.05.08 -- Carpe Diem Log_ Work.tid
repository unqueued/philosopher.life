title: 2018.05.08 -- Carpe Diem Log: Work

* Woke at 6
** Damned good sleep! Fuck yeah!
* Busy morning routine, and I pissed myself. Made me almost late. Also need gas in the car. Worried I'll run out before I can get to a gas station.
* Worked
* Got home, nobody was there. They went to a party.
* Fireman Time!
* Talked to JRE
** Odd conversation. He misrepresented me to L&K on purpose (his words) because it wasn't expedient to him to tell the truth. I guess he isn't going to be telling the truth...
** He's anxious about meeting our donors again.
* Read+Write
* Fixed a tiny problem on m15
* Saw my chillun, watched //Mike Tyson's Mysteries//
* Bed at 9:30
