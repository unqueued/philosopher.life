title: 2019.03.20 - Prompted Introspection: First Fav TV Show

!! What was your first favorite TV show?

I feel like there are different stages of my illustrious TV watching career. Eureka's Castle and TMNT were the bomb. Ren & Stimpy changed my life forever. The Jefferson's and I Love Lucy were windows into another generation. I probably don't even remember my first favorite. Pressed, I'll say TMNT; I still want to be a ninja. 

I hate to say it, but I'm Raphael without being nearly as cool.
