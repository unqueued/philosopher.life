Здравейте. Мир на теб. `/bow`

You appear out of nowhere, and it's [[good]] to see [[you|GR6A]], [[stranger|Poem: To A Stranger.]]. Well met! 

<<<
Hello there, h0p3!

This is GR6A :) but, other than that pseudo-pseudonymisation, my real name really is Grigor (which is nicknamed as Гриша, and in my language for 6 we say "шшшшшест", so GR6A really is actually pronounced Grisha, ш=sh... anyhow...)...
<<<

Your name is fascinating. Thank you for walking me through it. I would not have understood without your pointers. It's clever, and I appreciate how short it is at face value. 

I like this phrase "pseudo-pseudonymisation." It is difficult to pick out where pseudonymity begins and ends in a context (it comes in [[dok]]); there's vagueness in naming.

<<<
I'm writing for many reasons: interesting wiki you have there... very hard to read, crashes all the time, don't know how you work on it, and am curious to know?... also wanted to look closer at your tag cloud (what it does, how you made it) but... it crashes on me... also very interesting to read it all, especially since I *can* relate (!!!) to both your style and, of course, your "themes"/ideas/ramblings/fractalisations - I enjoy them thoroughly, when I manage to read them..., but as I said, crashes aaaaall the time - maybe it IS a feature? which I haven't overcome yet :(
<<<

I write for many reasons too, ultimately toward {[[one|About]]}, [[hope]]fully [[irwartfrr]], [[WINTCIS]]. I wish it weren't so hard to [[read|Readme]] (it's hard to write too). There's a lot which goes into writing this wiki, and it can be [[byzantine|RGM]] at times. When it comes to how I save TW: I use [[Bob|https://github.com/OokTech/TW5-Bob]]. What TW tools do you prefer?

I'm sad to hear that it crashes for you (I'm a bit surprised too), and I don't know what to do about that. It's not a feature. A plain TW works smoothly on a lot of devices, but mine is a resource hog. What kind of machine is it crashing on for you? In a pinch, you could read it from source (but that is laborious and not as functional);<<ref "f">> I ended up doing that on your wiki as well. Speaking of which, that's definitely a cool wiki you've got going there too. Is this your primary wiki? I'm hoping you turn it [[up to 11|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9F5fhJQo34]].

I see we have lots in common. That is exciting. =)

<<<
The immediate reason for this note, though, is that I'm looking for help, h0p3fu11y you'll take a look here:

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/HHV_32A3ONY/jh9UJ0pvAAAJ

And if you can offer me some h0p3 of getting this to work, I'll take it! (I have one response there, which is setting my on the right track, it looks like..., but did I say I waited for a good reason to write specifically to you...)
<<<

I will do what I can to [[help]], but I have to warn you that I'm a skiddie too, XD. Since I am a filthy casual, I can't say I understand what you are after, so you'll have to correct me, please. It appears you are trying to have, for lack of a better term, a "Tag page" (I do this a lot), with maybe a generic kind of code that will allow you to dynamically narrow a list of tiddlers tagged with the title of the Tag page using text input. My offspring and I have been thinking about how to make it work for you. I'll let you know if we find a way. Until you've got a solution, you might consider not generalizing it; you don't have many tag pages to worry about right now.

Good interfaces for automated filter-expression construction is one of the more important problems I see facing TW (I think you might find [[bimlas]]' work fascinating). You seem to be taking a crack at that, to some extent.

<<<
But, and quite seriously now, I came across your wiki looong time ago and was really just waiting for a chance to take you up on your offer to get in contact with random passersby/nomads/strangers, like me (although I'm not much into the "nomad" thin/k/g, like to be "settled", much rather):
<<<

I'm glad you reached out. While it hasn't been that long in some respects, it does feel like a long time since I started [[FTO]] in this wiki. [[The Other]] is a precious model and {[[axiom]]} to me.

I want to be settled too. Although, it turns out that the settled have an obligation to those who are wandering. I don't think we escape either.

P.S. The attachment is the picture from the poetry link above (just saying, in case you are paranoid to open stuff from "strangers" :) given you protonmail and such ;)
<<<

It's true: I am paranoid about opening some kinds of things from strangers. I appreciate that you aim to calm me and take my paranoia into account. It's interesting that the names and sizes are different between the attachment and the site's image. It caused me to read [[these|Poem: To A Stranger.]] [[poems|Poem: To You.]]. You have a good eye, sir. Thank you for the gift.

<<<
Thanks man! (I'd bet you are a man, I'd be surprised a lot if you were a lady? And if you are indeed, then I'd apologise :)
<<<

XD. Indeed, [[I|h0p3]] am butt a man, a feeble and foolish one at that. I'm glad that you are a polite predictor. 

<<<
Oh, and if you do get back to me, and you'd prefer, I'd open a protonmail myself - always looking for *good* reasons to do stuff: as I mentioned, I waited years for a reason to write to you, for example...

Take good care! h0p3 you'll write back!
<<<

I think it's generally [[right]] to have an e-mail account with a provider like protonmail.<<ref "i">> We can use your gmail though, and I would also be happy to simply read off your wiki. I will be writing to you over my wiki unless an exception arises.

I'm glad the conditions were such that you chose to write me. I know it can be an expensive thing to do. За мен е чест да се запознаем. 

с най-добри пожелания,

[[h0p3]]

<<footnotes "f" "For example, you can find all things tagged for you in my source by searching for the name/string of your [[firmcoded]] tiddler: `title=#GR6A: Focus#` (replace #'s with quotation marks). It might also be useful to break it down into .tid files. Unfortunately, it's painful to navigate the wiki outside of the browser. Let's see if we can get this bloated wiki working in your browser instead.">>
