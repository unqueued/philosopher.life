title: 2018.09.13 -- Eli: Not A T42T Failure

Hey there. I hope you are doing well.

I've been watching and I've been thinking. I'm sorry that my [response](https://eli.li/entry.php?id=20180821015058) wasn't clear. It wasn't my intention to side-step your questions. I was, in my (albeit broken) way attempting to honestly answer your questions.

> At the very least, T42T means being more forgiving in the dialectic than my interlocutor (by how much, I do not know). Essentially, the blame of a failure to cooperate must not rest with me.

The blame is mine. So, if you don't mind, I'd like to answer more directly.

> I would like for you to say more. What are you afraid of? Where is the world going? Will you continue to walk the desert as you do? Why? 

What am I afraid of? **People**.

Why am I afraid of people? Because they are unpredictable. I believe that your intent was not malicious, nor was it to frighten me. It was, nonetheless, frightening to see my family's address codified into a single location.

Pragmatically I understand that this information is mere moments away at anytime...

Fear, however, is very often not a pragmatic response. I was afraid.

Where is the world going? **I do not know.**

It is easy for me to imagine frightening futures, and it seems to be becoming more difficult for me to imagine better ones. I am not pleased with this, but it is where I am currently at.

At heart I am often anarchist. But it is difficult to believe (read perhaps as "trust") in anarchism when one struggles to trust other folks. It is something I'm working on.

Will you continue to walk the desert as you do? Why? **I honestly do not know, but I hope to continue to struggle with the walk. To engage in it with intention and open ears**.

There is something more that I wanted to say about "consent," but it isn't a fully formed thought yet, so, instead I leave this pointer as a reminder, more to myself than for you, indicating that I'm still thinking through your questions, and I hope that you don't mind that my answers might not be always direct, but I'll do my best.

It isn't connected to this conversation, I don't think, but I've been thinking a lot lately about ["Biopower"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopower) and what relationship it has to the web. It is something I think you may have interesting insight into.
