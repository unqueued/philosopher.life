6 MIN AGO

My brother called me briefly. Assistant GM offered to write him a recommendation letter. My brother doesn't have to rely upon his boss here since several are backing him up. Management has been hearing how much of a fucking exploitative asshole he has been to my brother. They have stopped by to say they love him (which is code for "we make a lot of money off you; if we make you feel better, we won't have to pay you more"). I hope my brother continues to look for other positions. I'm not sure he knows where he might want to go, which I can appreciate.

---

He called me again toward the end of his shift. He's feeling more and more motivated to find another job. I hope he will look far and wide. The next step matters a great deal, imho. I am proud that he defends himself and others against this psychopath. I also agree that he should look to make sure that he can have this man's recommendation, but he must also be willing to leave without it.
