title: The Gervais Principle

Well, this is my first. This has a deep reading notion to it. Perhaps I need to not treat it like hyperreading. Mmmm...I'm not sure yet. It has a bit of both, I suppose.

Currently working through //The Gervais Principle//, a book about one of my favorite shows //The Office//. It's an analysis. I love the idea. Diving in...

I think Dilbert's cynicism has caught me, and I think I am an iconoclast. He doesn't though, Good for him?

It's about organizational literacy. Sweet! And, I can see his //memetic hazard//, that ignorance is sometimes bliss. Once you learn to speak the language, it is hard to unhear and see what you do.<<ref "2019.03.19-1">>

//MacLeod Lifecycle// is the result of Sociopaths creating the right culture and metagame to dominate everyone, but in doing so the process eventually explodes. The idea is that Sociopaths find (economic) Losers to take the hit, eventually Clueless Organizational Men start ballooning, and then it pops, rinse and repeat.<<ref "2019.03.19-2">> 

Organizational Men really are clueless, Dwigt.

In contrast to the Peter Principle, The Gervais Principle:

<<<
Sociopaths, in their own best interests, knowingly promote over-performing Losers into middle-management, groom under-performing Losers into Sociopaths, and leave the average bare-minimum-effort Losers to fend for themselves.<<ref "2019.03.19-3">>
<<<

Losers, essentially, are psychopathic towards their future selves, taking short-term gains in stable paychecks over long-term capital investments in themselves. We will see if Rao makes this point. He seems to imply parts of it, but fails in others. Problematically, I can show how every single layer is not only egoist but also psychopathic. Admittedly, he still gets us closer to the truth than the Peter Principle.

I adore how he calls out the characters. He even picks out characters that others would not, imho.

There are 4 languages spoke in an organization: Posturetalk, Powertalk, Babytalk and Gametalk. 

The powertalk section is an eloquent redpilled dissection. It is a zerosum consequentialist communication. I must say, I lack the verbal abilities, particularly in the moment, to engage in effective powertalk. I am too trapped in my autistic world to generate fitting theories of mind on the fly to leverage anything in the first place. Perhaps it is possible with enormous practice, as the author suggests.

Do I want to do that though?

Ultimately, I'm bad at storytelling; I'm no raconteur on the fly. Steering the Bene Gesserit guttural responses of a conversation might never be something I'll be good at. I don't have some mastermind control over the rhythm and tempo of a conversation. Although, sometimes I feel like I'm interesting to listen to. Sometimes I come alive. I can't tell when I'm effective and when I'm not. That is a sign of me really not knowing something very important.

<<<
If your situational reactions are generally appropriate but against your best interests, you are a well-adjusted Loser. If they are both appropriate and in your best interests, you are a Sociopath. If your reactions are inappropriate (whether or not they are in your best interests – sometimes they are), you are Clueless.
<<<

Arrested develop occurs in three stages:

# The Clueless distort reality.
# The Losers distort rewards and penalties.
# The Sociopaths distort the metaphysics of human life

I'm not sure what he means by the latter. It's a terrible claim by all appearances.

Ah, I'm pretty clueless.

Vocabulary:

* Gesellschaft: social relations based on impersonal ties, as duty to a society or organization.
* Gemeinschaft: social relations between individuals, based on close personal and family ties; community.
* hamartia: a fatal error born of unavoidable ignorance.

The //Lake-Wobegon-Effect//, where “all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average.” Group delusions, quid pro quo. Uniqueness mutual delusion game.

<<<
Status therefore, must first be successfully obscured during a membership bid. As with most group dynamics, membership bids are scripted in Gametalk. How new members segue into existing group games is what determines their future.
<<<

Converting skill into capital:

Social skills → Social truth hypotheses → Social proof → Social capital

<<<
In a two-person situation, you either get non-adversarial self-deprecation (which reinforces existing status), or an adversarial joke. Since social proof works by majority vote, two-person adversarial jokes cannot work unless the victim laughs at himself, accepting an insult.<<ref "2019.03.19-4">>

...

One-person humor is Sociopath humor...It can only happen when the jokester and audience are the same person

...

Loser humor, an engine of social capital creation...The smallest meaningful Loser group is three people (including the special case where the victim is absent, and both jokester and audience laugh, providing a 2/3 social proof majority).
<<<

<<<
HIWTYL improvisations are far too unpredictable and unsystematic for Sociopath tastes. For them, HIWTYL is not about hacking reward/penalty structures after the fact. It is about proactively engineering systems and processes that reliably, predictably and stealthily generate HIWTYL outcomes. In other words, they look for ways to systematically claim paternity for successes, and orphan failures.
<<<

<<<
Hanlon’s Razor is double-edged, and Sociopaths use it to feign incompetence themselves or to charge others with incompetence, as necessary.
<<<

Sociopaths employ the Hanlon Dodge.

* delegation with a built-in insurance policy.
* seasoned Sociopaths maintain a permanent facade of strategic incompetence and ignorance in key areas, rather than just making up situational incompetence arguments.

He gives advice to sociopaths, very clearly in this book.

* When you work Gemeinschaft – the matrix of personal connections and trust relationships that binds Loser groups together – there is really only one basic tactic: divide-and-conquer.

<<<
predictability allows Sociopaths to automate much of the HIWTYL risk-management they need. Instead of having to expend effort executing Hanlon Dodge maneuvers, putting on justification theaters or engineering divide-and-conquer situations, they program the organization to act in those ways by installing bureaucracy-ware.
<<<

<<<
tax law is complex for a reason: its primary purpose is to catalyze the growth of complicated exception-handling on top of an apparently simple percentage calculation.
<<<

<<<
There are only three ways to get a bureaucracy to do anything it wasn’t designed to do: by stealth, with secret and deniable support from allies in the staff hierarchy; by getting air-cover from a sufficiently high-up Sociopath who can play poker with whichever oversubscribed Sociopath is in charge of exception-handling for the specific process (i.e. jumping the appeals queue and calling in favors to ensure the required ruling); and through corruption and bribery.
<<<<

<<<
The Sociopath journey begins with what is essentially a religious dissatisfaction. A dissatisfaction that awakens the first time Sociopaths contemplate their situation in life.

On the one hand, they find the contemporary account of reality to be suspiciously convenient for those with power: it explains the prevailing social order as a necessary and natural one a little too neatly.

On the other hand, they find themselves facing the intolerable expectation that they accept powerless stations, defined by scripted actions and fixed rewards within that order.

Whether they dismiss prevailing accounts as rationalizations and begin a search for deeper meanings, or defy expectations and reach for power beyond their station, Sociopaths begin their unscripted journeys to rid themselves of that fundamental dissatisfaction; the sense that reality is more complex than whatever is being presented to them. That important things are being hidden from view, and not for their own good.<<ref "2019.03.19-5">>

They are not entirely sure what they are looking for, but they do know that they are looking to engage reality directly, without mediation by other humans. To turn the famous line from A Few Good Men around, they are looking for the truth about social realities because they think they can handle it.
<<<

<<<
Sociopathy is not about ripping off a specific mask from the face of social reality. It is about recognizing that there are no social realities. There are only masks. Social realities exist as a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated and specialized fictions for those predisposed to believe that there is something special about the human condition, which sets our realities apart from the rest of the universe.<<ref "2019.03.19-6">>
<<<

I am not good at becoming a mask.

<<<
All that is required is to control people who believe in fairness, is to remove any evidence suggesting that the world might fundamentally not be a fair place, and mask it appropriately with a justice principle such as an afterlife calculus, or a retirement fantasy.

So the process of ripping away masks of social reality and getting behind them ultimately turns into a routine skill for the Sociopath: game design. Once you do it a few times, it becomes second nature, a sort of basic power literacy. An understanding of the processes by which the fictions of social reality are constructed, and growing skill at wrangling those processes.<<ref "2019.03.19-7">>
<<<

Um, those are two different skills to some extent, right? The ability to perceive the mask and behind it is different from "wrangling." I'm sure being good at one helps you with the other, of couse.

The end of this book now enters into my territory more directly. It's virtue-theoretic vertigo. This is Nietzsche done well. 

Rao really shows us how the sausage is made.

God damn, that is a good book. The end gives some video recommendations...and, confirm my bias territory, I'm definitely in love with many of them. Those I've not seen I'm downloading.

I feel compelled to point out how //West World//'s primary antagonist, Black Hat, is peeling away layers of reality trying to find meaning in the game. Rao's description is fucking perfect.<<ref "2019.03.19-8">>
