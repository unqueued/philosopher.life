title: 2018.07.11 -- Deep Reading: The Ego Tunnel

Clearly, I deny that the self is an illusion. I am an emergence. I am a result of faith in myself. I feel like I'm listening to a Humean-Kant hybrid with this author. He's obviously very learned.

I am not convinced this person absolutely appreciates the problem of reductionism all the way down. But, that's okay. They are clearly brilliant. I love how smoothly they give the argument. I cannot tell you how difficult it has been for me to come to understand some of the things they brilliantly explain in just a few words.

Very fun book!
