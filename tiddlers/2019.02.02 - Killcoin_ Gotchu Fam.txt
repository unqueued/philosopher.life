SAT 4:37 PM
Hey! =)
SAT 4:38 PM
It's ya boy, Killcoin.
SAT 4:38 PM
How are you doin'? It's been a long time.
SAT 4:38 PM
Dude, no kidding.  I think I talked to you wife more after graduation than I did you.  Then I got off facebook and haven't been back.  I'm doing well, all things considered.  How about you?
SAT 4:39 PM
It's been a hell of decade.
SAT 4:41 PM
Some of it literally hell, some of it wonderful. Probably slowly losing my mind. What's new? =)
SAT 4:41 PM
Oh nothing, just jobless and homeless living back with the rents.  I am subbing part time at the local public school.
SAT 4:42 PM
Taking online classes for a MS in IT.
SAT 4:42 PM
Nice!
SAT 4:42 PM
I work at our local school running the afterschool program (glorified babysitting).
SAT 4:43 PM
I literally look like a homeless man, so I can join you there.
SAT 4:43 PM
I mean isn't that what most teachers are as well these days?
SAT 4:43 PM
preach
SAT 4:43 PM
They do so much computer work it's ridiculous.
SAT 4:44 PM
I think it's awesome your are doing IT and school (I think it is noble, regardless of my extremely negative opinions about the systems I have worked in). What are you studying?
SAT 4:45 PM
Cybersecurity.  The last class was pointless and this one is so complicated it's kicking my ass.
SAT 4:47 PM
I'm insanely envious.
SAT 4:47 PM
Yeah, I'm even more skewed against public schools having spent some time in them (finally).
SAT 4:47 PM
Well, you have to tell me more than that about your classes. Tell me about them. I love computers.
SAT 4:48 PM
The class I am currently in we are learning a little JavaFX for app/program designing and then also database building with SQL.  So my assignment this week is to design the database side.
SAT 4:50 PM
Last class (my first) was IT and System Trends where we read articles and wrote papers, pretty much like Stories at Berea.
SAT 4:51 PM
I am sorry you have to learn Java (even a little).
SAT 4:52 PM
This week I'm making an Entity Relationship Diagram to set up the database.
SAT 4:52 PM
Very cool.
SAT 4:52 PM
I had to make a shitty, not professional looking one of those recently, imho.
SAT 4:52 PM
Well, it wouldn't be as bad if all the instructional books weren't written assuming you'd already had basic java classes.
SAT 4:52 PM
What did you make one for?
SAT 4:53 PM
For part of my computing infrastructure.
SAT 4:53 PM
I'm still trying to reason about it. Sometimes the visuals help.
SAT 4:53 PM
Ah, ok.  How's the family?
SAT 4:54 PM
Wife, ten kids?
SAT 4:54 PM
2 kids, 1 wife, 2 cats
SAT 4:54 PM
1 kid, ex-wife, 1 cat.
SAT 4:54 PM
:)
SAT 4:55 PM
https://philosopher.life/#Wiki%3A%20Rube-Goldberg%20Machine
SAT 4:55 PM
There's the diagram.
SAT 4:55 PM
We are getting old, sir.
SAT 4:55 PM
Nice.Yeah, tell me about it.  I had to have emergency back surgery last January.
SAT 4:56 PM
Wow. What happened?
SAT 4:56 PM
I had a job lined up back here working as an Assistant General Manager at Buffalo Wild Wings (I've spent a lot of time in restaurants since I graduated) and on the next to last day of my other job I went out to eat and was getting out of the girls car back at the office and twisted the wrong way.  Messed me up so bad by noon the next day my legs were giving out and by the time my mom got there I literally had to crawl halfway to the van to get my MRI.  Couldn't do the MRI because the pain was so bad so they sent me to the ER.
SAT 4:58 PM
The ER drugged me up so much that they finally got the MRI and told me I was having emergency surgery the next morning at 7.
SAT 4:59 PM
What did they need to do?
SAT 4:59 PM
The Neurosurgeon told me I had the back of a 65 year old marine.
SAT 4:59 PM
lol
SAT 4:59 PM
Laminectomy
SAT 4:59 PM
Googling* =)
SAT 5:00 PM
How are you doing now after the surgery?
SAT 5:00 PM
Removed the bulging disk and cleaned up the arthritis but by then I'd suffered so much nerve damage that I was paralyzed from the waist down.
SAT 5:00 PM
Still paralyzed?
SAT 5:01 PM
I had these two issues:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conus_medullaris
https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/guide/cauda-equina-syndrome-overview#1
SAT 5:01 PM
Nope, spent four months in a wheel chair but finally got moving again.  I won't be able to run or do much physical labor but I'm walking, which the neuro didn't think I would be able to do.
SAT 5:02 PM
Sounds like torture.
SAT 5:02 PM
Walking is awesome.
SAT 5:02 PM
It was a tribulation for sure.
SAT 5:02 PM
I thought I had experienced some of the worse that could happen to me during my divorce but.... NOPE.
SAT 5:03 PM
worst*
SAT 5:03 PM
Yes, I'm extremely lucky.  Bowels and bladder are still messed up but I'm not cathing yet.  My lower legs have nerve damage still with hypersensitivity but it's nothing like it was.
SAT 5:04 PM
Do you anticipate further improvement?
SAT 5:05 PM
Yeah, your nerves heal the most within a year but continue to heal for a couple of years, so I've still got a year to go.
SAT 5:05 PM
Anyways, that has been my last year in a nutshell.
SAT 5:06 PM
Sounds absolutely insane. I'm sorry about the pain; I am happy to hear you are recovering nicely.
SAT 5:06 PM
*Queue Destiny's Child "Survivor"*
SAT 5:07 PM
Anyways, how old are the kids?
SAT 5:07 PM
=)
SAT 5:08 PM
[[j3d1h]] is 13, [[1uxb0x]] is 11.
SAT 5:08 PM
That makes your child ~10ish?
SAT 5:08 PM
She turned 11 in November.
SAT 5:09 PM
Awesome. Same age as my son. He just turned 11 on New Years.
SAT 5:09 PM
How is she, what's she like?
SAT 5:09 PM
Nice.  What year in college are they?
SAT 5:09 PM
Depends on the subject.
SAT 5:09 PM
I'm sure you and [[k0sh3k]] have them doing grad work by now.
SAT 5:10 PM
;)
SAT 5:10 PM
It's true. We went over the first chapter of my dissertation on Friday.
SAT 5:10 PM
lol
SAT 5:11 PM
My son is autistic; it's been a powerful experience to learn about myself through him.
SAT 5:11 PM
Oh wow.  My brother has a kid that's on the spectrum as well.
SAT 5:11 PM
Boy didn't couldn't say "dad" until he was 4. It's been an uphill battle.
SAT 5:11 PM
He's come a long way though.
SAT 5:12 PM
You're working with him though, that's the important thing.  My SIL "homeschools" and I'm afraid he's not getting the attention he needs.
SAT 5:12 PM
I hear that. Sometimes I am not the dad my boy needs or deserves either. Still, gotta do what I can. Trying to find constructive things he loves to do. He wrote a MUD in python for us last week.
SAT 5:13 PM
I'm hoping he goes down that rabbithole.
SAT 5:14 PM
That's great.  It would be a good field for him.
SAT 5:14 PM
It's tough being a parent, I feel like I'm not near the father my daughter deserves quite a bit.  Professionally I'm starting over, and physically I'm just not there.
SAT 5:15 PM
She spends her time with her mother and sister in CA and I get her three times a year.
SAT 5:15 PM
You just do what you can, when you can and hope that it's enough.
SAT 5:15 PM
That must be ridiculously hard on both you and her. I'm sorry.
SAT 5:15 PM
It's okay, we've adjusted and she likes her visits.  I try to call her every day and facetime when I'm in town (my parents have shitty internet)
SAT 5:16 PM
It sounds like you have had to have a lot of courage through a fuckton of pain. I do not think I would be standing were I in your shoes.
SAT 5:17 PM
Eh, I think God slaps me around some for the life I've lived.
SAT 5:18 PM
lol
SAT 5:18 PM
It always makes me fall back on the one thing that I can, and that's my faith.
SAT 5:19 PM
I just stop asking why and ask for help.
SAT 5:19 PM
I have certainly tried to escape having faith as well. It doesn't work.
SAT 5:19 PM
What do you mean?
SAT 5:19 PM
That is a long story; it started before we met...though Berea added fuel to the fire. I have had to do a lot of soulsearching since we last talked. I'm starting over professionally too! =)
SAT 5:21 PM
Was doing pipefitting and construction for a while, but I have reason to believe my vocation still requires consistent computer access.
SAT 5:22 PM
I thought about trying the pipefitting, didn't go through with it though.  I figured I have a ton of medical bills, why not add a ton of college debt as well?
SAT 5:22 PM
In for a penny, in for a pound.
SAT 5:23 PM
Even if you don't do it for work, it's still a great skill to have though.
SAT 5:23 PM
So what are you trying to get into with computers?  You've always known a lot more than me about them.
SAT 5:23 PM
It has been a good use of my time, even if only instrumentally.
SAT 5:24 PM
That is a question that will take me quite a while to answer with you (I'm not blowing you off; I'm simply not good at stating some thing succinctly, imho). I've been writing my wiki for the past two years like a madman. It's ~25MB of plaintext.
SAT 5:25 PM
It serves many purposes.
SAT 5:26 PM
Daaaamn.  That's a lot of text.
SAT 5:26 PM
As someone interested in cybersecurity, I think you might find several aspects of it fascinating.
SAT 5:27 PM
I bookmarked the page you sent to me, I'm working on my lessons right now but I'm going to check it out later.
SAT 5:27 PM
Did you make your millions in Bitcoin?
SAT 5:28 PM
I did mine them while in Thailand, but I never thought they'd amount to anything. Lol.
SAT 5:28 PM
I've been pretty broke, so even when I knew about other coins, I couldn't really invest.
SAT 5:29 PM
I did make some money though.
SAT 5:29 PM
It's helped pay the bills.
SAT 5:29 PM
Lol, I read an article about how when they first were trying to use them some guy spent like 600 BTC to buy a pizza showing how they could be used to buy irl products.  Now that's quite a bit of money he wasted.
SAT 5:29 PM
Good, good.
SAT 5:29 PM
My brother has asked me to let him know if I ever stumble across such a thing, but I am not so good at knowing when something will turn out to be valuable (qua being interesting enough to others) and when something is just interesting to me (and some other geeks ;P).
SAT 5:31 PM
It sucks not being able to trust myself in that respect.
SAT 5:31 PM
You live and you learn.
SAT 5:31 PM
Gonna be applying this job: https://www.eff.org/opportunities/jobs/privacy-and-surveillance-activist -- Maybe a 1% chance I can get it. Still gonna dream.
SAT 5:31 PM
So why Cybersecurity? What do you love about it? What do you hate about it?
SAT 5:33 PM
What topics did you cover in your papers for the previous class?
SAT 5:34 PM
Honestly, I'm tired of getting into shitty jobs that ebb and flow with the economy.  I think it's the future and with everything going to cloud-based services it's only going to be more in-demand.
SAT 5:34 PM
Hmm, we did an article on bitcoin, we did some on 3d printing.. it was really all over the place.
SAT 5:36 PM
It wasn't a good class, we didn't delve into anything deep enough to learn and skipped around.  What do you think this tech will be like in 30 years sort of shite.
SAT 5:36 PM
Seems like a high demand sector that can never be automated away by ML.
SAT 5:37 PM
Block chain is very interesting to me but it's hard to dumb down enough for me to understand.  I get the basic concepts but not the ideas behind them.
SAT 5:37 PM
Yes.  Honestly, I think 2/3 of the country will be jobless and standing in food lines in 50 years.
SAT 5:37 PM

SAT 5:38 PM
Living off of our welfare and food tickets.
SAT 5:38 PM
I see us sliding further into a socialist system and then the Elites in charge witling away our numbers until they have the population they want.
SAT 5:39 PM
Not to be all politicky.
SAT 5:39 PM
There is no escaping politics. We are political animals. I consider it my moral duty to participate in the material dialectic and The Great Human Conversation.
SAT 5:40 PM
I aim to practice The Golden Rule with you in all matters.
SAT 5:40 PM
I suggest we will have disagreements on the definition of socialism. =)
SAT 5:40 PM
That's quite the job, but someone as versed in Philosophy and computers like you do should be a good fit for it.  I don't have any idea of your current interpersonal skill level but working with kids like you have should really help in approaching things in a good way.
SAT 5:41 PM
(still the insane arrogant bastard you knew in college...turned up to 11)
SAT 5:41 PM
lol
SAT 5:41 PM
I'm sure we probably wouldn't agree on defining socialism at all.
SAT 5:42 PM
Well, I will gladly show you the way, homie.
SAT 5:43 PM
I think my interpersonal skills have gotten worse in some respects (I'm far more reclusive), but I've made improvements in other ways. Imho, I have to cognitively reverse engineer socialization and theory of minds to map onto my emotional reasoning. I rarely get to be myself with others.
SAT 5:45 PM
Even weirdos think I'm weird. =) Someone recently said I was like "the Uni-bomber," but...like...the good kind (rising valley girl inflection).
SAT 5:46 PM
Thank god for cannabliss.
SAT 5:46 PM
lol, oh man.  I have become far more introverted as well.
SAT 5:46 PM
Cannabliss, haha.  I take it you partake then/
SAT 5:47 PM
?
SAT 5:47 PM
I can't smoke (still allergic).
SAT 5:47 PM
https://philosopher.life/#Hidden%3A%20Cannabutter%20Recipe -- I've purchased 3 ounces in 5 years though. It's about $1.50 a hit that lasts for maybe 8 hours. I'm enjoying the benefits as we speak.
SAT 5:48 PM
my existential crisis has almost cost me my life many times, anti-depressants did not help
SAT 5:49 PM
doctors were useless...nobody even took me seriously when I said losing my faith would cause me to want to take my life.
SAT 5:50 PM
Thankfully, I have been resourceful enough to attempt to self-medicate (though perhaps not resourceful enough).
SAT 5:50 PM
I had an excellent setup for growing magic mushrooms, and that helped. Ketamine (deschloroketamine, actually, since I had to buy RCs while they were still a grey area in the law) has been the sledgerhammer.
SAT 5:51 PM
I am lucky to have the few family members that give a shit about me that do.
SAT 5:52 PM
I've smoked quite a bit since college, in splurts.  Most recently was the beginning of the summer when I went to CA by train to get my daughter.  Bought an edible and three vape cartridges.  Haven't done shrooms but would be open to the experience at least once.
SAT 5:53 PM
I could see where the pot would help, have no info on Ketamine or Shrooms.
SAT 5:53 PM
On average, shrooms, will permanently alter your Big5 Openness trait by half a standard deviation. I believe everyone should take it once.
SAT 5:54 PM
Ketamine is a dissociative. It is now being used to treat treatment-resistant depression (a few google searches will show major publishers talk about it now). It's like nothing I've ever experienced before. I do not enjoy it at all, but I am grateful to have it available.
SAT 5:55 PM
Pot seems to be good for whatever flavor of autism I have. My opinion is that it enables schizotypal Top-down modeling which can help balance my autistic Bottom-up perceptual preoccupation with precision.
SAT 5:56 PM
My drug of choice was always alcohol.  Nearly ruined my life quite a few times but I was lucky.  Now I can't really drink because of my bladder, I'll be up all night peeing or piss myself, so I'm done there.
SAT 5:56 PM
Lol. I hear that.
SAT 5:57 PM
Runs heavily in my family. Unfortunately, I still rely upon it. I'm probably a functioning alcoholic for at least a few weeks summed over each year.
SAT 5:58 PM
We seem to have an enormous amount in common a decade later. Lol.
SAT 5:59 PM
Haha, I believe so.  Where are you living these days?  I'm with my parents in BFE but I'm hoping to find a career in Nashville (about 1.5 hours from where I am currently).
SAT 6:00 PM

SAT 6:02 PM
What in the hell is the "redaction?"
SAT 6:03 PM
I redact particular bits of information (or substitute them) in my record keeping. That's just a signal to make sure I don't forget.
SAT 6:04 PM
Ah, ok.

My daughter has a boyfriend now (recent), so I sent him a letter. https://philosopher.life/#2019.01.22%20-%20j3d1h%3A%20Entity%3A%20First%20Contact
SAT 6:09 PM
Watching her "date" makes me realize I would be beyond lost.
SAT 6:09 PM
Is this an actual letter or an "open letter" sort of thing.
SAT 6:09 PM

SAT 6:09 PM
My letter was to him, but it is in the open.
SAT 6:10 PM

Aye, I hear ya. It may be difficult for you to wrestle with me here.
SAT 6:16 PM
You've moved from communitarianism to anarchism

I am only an anarchist insofar as morally unjustified governments are in power. I do believe that governments can be, conceptually speaking, morally justified. I am not against governments at all.
SAT 6:21 PM
So, I would still say I'm a commie. =)
SAT 6:22 PM
Ideally I would label myself an AnarchoCapitalist, but I realize the government is a necessary evil, so yeah.
SAT 6:22 PM
I think you will find we have enormous common ground on secure digital infrastructures. Even extreme libertarians tend to like my ideas there.
SAT 6:22 PM
I agree.
SAT 6:23 PM
In this age digital privacy should be a inalienable right.
SAT 6:23 PM
It is a matter I think about a lot. I hold controversial opinions on the matter. Let me say that I'm convinced freedom of speech of individuals should tend to override privacy concerns. Further, I believe information advantages should serve those at the bottom. In this case, I think "privacy from whom?" is a complex question to answer. I agree we have many moral rights to privacy (and especially to have the freedom to use tools which generate it) in a wide variety of contexts.
SAT 6:25 PM
I'm going to have a difficult time explaining my wiki to the EFF.

I'm sure it does.  Coding sucks ass.
SAT 6:45 PM
Well, I'm lazy as fuck too.
SAT 6:45 PM
My daughter builds that infrastructure out at this point. I can't really punish her by taking the interwebs away from her. She's the house admin. Locking her down would be a nightmare now.
SAT 6:46 PM

SAT 6:46 PM
Just wait until she hacks into somewhere and you get a knock on the door.
SAT 6:47 PM
I have told her she must come to me if she aims to do so.
SAT 6:47 PM
There are rules we must follow.
SAT 6:47 PM
But dad, I just used social engineering, I didn't *hack* anything!
SAT 6:47 PM
That is one non-trivial career path for her. I encourage it.
SAT 6:48 PM
I consider it necessary for owning and pwning one's identity.
SAT 6:48 PM
She hasn't been too interested in that side of things yet.
SAT 6:48 PM
(just as lazy as her old man)
SAT 6:48 PM
Yes, well unfortunately I think it's an impossibility not to be seen anymore online.
SAT 6:49 PM
Or to be anon.
SAT 6:49 PM
That may be correct.
SAT 6:49 PM
Seen by whom?
SAT 6:49 PM
Anonymous to what degree?
SAT 6:49 PM
I ran 1% of the Tor network for years (by throughput).
SAT 6:50 PM
To the degree that in order to change anything you'd be tracked.
SAT 6:49 PM
You can be anon but you won't be effective.
SAT 6:50 PM
And Uncle Sam ran like 15%
SAT 6:50 PM
Aye.
SAT 6:50 PM

A pregnant female patient is lying on her bed in a doctor’s office, waiting for the doctor to come in to deliver the baby. She’s already been told that the delivery is a few hours a way and her contractions aren’t that severe yet.

A doctor comes in impatiently with two nurses, looks at the mother, and says “Alright, let’s speed things up a bit!”

He reaches into the woman, grabs the baby by the head and pulls it right out. The doctor then starts banging the baby around the room, just whacking its limp body on everything he can manage: walls, tables, and even the ceiling a couple of times. All the while, blood is just going everywhere, getting on everything. The nurses and doctor are drenched in it by the end. The baby, of course, is completely limp.

After two minutes of utter chaos, the doctor suddenly stops and the mother stops screaming. The doctor looks her straight in the eye, obviously holding back a bit of laughter, and says, “April fools! It was already dead!”
SAT 7:22 PM
Wow.  Amazing.

In a transatlantic flight, a plane passes through a severe storm. The turbulence is awful, and things go from bad to worse when one wing is struck by lightning. One woman in particular loses it.

Screaming, she stands up in front of the plane and wails, “I’m too young to die!” Then she yells, “Well, if I am going to die, I want my last minutes on Earth to be memorable! I’ve had plenty of sex in my life, but no one has ever made me feel like a woman! I’ve had it! Is there anyone on the plane who can make me feel like a real woman?”

For a moment there is silence. Everyone has forgotten their own peril, and they all stare riveted at the desperate woman in front of the plane. Then, a man stands up in the rear of the plane.

“I can make you feel like a woman,” he says.

He’s gorgeous — tall, built, with long, flowing black hair and jet black eyes. He starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt one button at a time.

No one moves.

The woman is breathing heavily in anticipation as the stranger approaches.

He removes his shirt. Muscles ripple across his chest as he reaches her, and he extends the arm holding his shirt to the trembling woman and whispers:

“Iron this.”

A little boy's mother hired a magician to perform for her son's birthday party. After the magician had performed his tricks for the boy and all his friends he proceeds to go back stage and prepare for the next show. The little boy follows the magician back stage and begs him to perform just one more trick for him. The magician tells the boy that he is too busy and must get ready for the next show. The boy pleads and pleads with the magician to show him just one more trick, so finally the magician gives in. "Ok, turn around and pull down your pants.", the magician says. The little boy seems confused by this, but is so anxious to see the trick that he agrees. The magician then asks, "Now do you feel my thumb up your butt?" The little boy, now very surprised says, "Yes sir!?" The magician then reaches his 2 hands in front of the boy and wiggles his thumbs all while saying, "Oooh Magic!"

A mom is at the breakfast table with her three daughters.

Petal asks her mom, “Where did you get my name from?”

Her mom answers, “Well, when you were a baby, a petal fell from the sky and landed on your forehead, and so we named you Petal.”

Petal’s sister piped up, “Is that why you named me Snowflake? One landed on my forehead?”

Her mom answered, “Yes, that’s true.”

The third sister said, “HRRHHEHHGHGHRERRRHHHGHG.”

And, the mom said, “Shut up, Fridge!”

Jung was more of a psychologist/mystic, imho.

You don't think Nietzsche was striving for mystic status?

He certainly understood a great deal about our psychology in his existentialism too.

I'm still not sure how to systematically interpret Nietzsche.
