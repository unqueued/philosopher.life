title: 2020.03.12 - Computer Musings: Keyword Searching

Keyword searching clientside is one of my favorite aspects of TW. Alerts and ordering how I approach a web or a medium via keywords is often necessary for finding what is [[salient]] in a price-efficient and timely manner. Also, the ability to airgap is a special feature I hold in very high regard (even just for a potato with an intermittent internet connection). Enabling and abstracting over complex conditions for queries in a Fischer-Priced UI manner (I can barely use my own tooling, to be clear) can't be easy. I'm still thinking about how to improve this in my wiki.
