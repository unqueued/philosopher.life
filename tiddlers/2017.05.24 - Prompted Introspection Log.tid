//I forgot to write one last night. Oops. So, I'm making up for it this morning.//

!! How would you like to die?

In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden's mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty.

The assumption, of course, is that I'm going to die. That's a safe assumption. Maybe I could live on in some computer as a program or with robotic parts, but I highly doubt that will come to pass (even if it were possible). 

What obtains at the time of my death? Is that what you are really asking? Do you know what you are asking?

Like so many of my answers, I think this one requires context. "How I would like to die" is strongly tied to how I have lived. Tell me how I have lived, and I'll tell you the when what, where, what, who, how, etc. of my preferred death. The basic answer might appear to be "old and happy," however, there are plenty of scenarios in which I'd say "young and quickly," and others where "slow and painful" death would be a worthy sacrifice. The state of the world is key to answering this question. Working backward, we might say that in answering this question, we are really talking about how I would like to live. 

Ummm... I'd like everyone to be maximally and permanently happy when I die of "natural" causes in my sleep at an old age after having completed my [[Bucketlist]]. Done. 

Oh, that's not realistic? You mean I need a //realistic// answer. Well, I happen to think there is a much larger difference between the way the world //is// and the way it //ought to be//. I actually think we could, theoretically, achieve world peace, enriched lives, and live in harmony. I would virtually never, ever predict it though. 

Oh adversary, tell me what counts as realistic.

Maybe you are asking: Of those possible worlds that I see as not being just merely possible but also plausible, which of them do I wish to obtain? Of course, I must ask, how plausible? You have to nail this down for me. In charity, should I take up what I believe is most likely to occur and then give the most strategic answer in light of that context?

I believe the end of human existence is coming. I think billions are going to suffer and die by our own hands. I assume remnants will survive, but I don't think our species will be able to rebuild. We've harvested the surface of our planet in such a way that there aren't any do-overs. It will be a true blight on our planet's geological record. 

I think finding a safe place to help my children live meaningful lives while the world crumbles around us, enslaving each other, is our best option. I hope I'm wrong. If I'm wrong, then there are many other options. This is the problem with such a defensive option; your opportunity costs are fairly high. I wish I could be more optimistic. Maybe in time that will change. Who knows? Maybe I'm wrong about what is plausible. 

Ah, you still don't like my answer? Are you asking something far simpler: forget the state of the world, your life, etc., what is your preferred method or direct cause of your death?

I'd prefer it was painless. I want to go out doing something I would never do as a person who wants to live: I want to OD on Heroin when medical care is beyond helping me. I want my last moments to be pure bliss.
