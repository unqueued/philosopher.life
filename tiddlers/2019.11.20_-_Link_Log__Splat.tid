*** `/facepalm`. "experience as," lol. Why should we think this is an empirical investigation? It's a logical one first! Imagine arguing against the truths of mathematics because the average person didn't hold beliefs which favored the possibility. If you began with constructivism as a plausible theory of value, regardless of where representations of these values are stored and computed in our brains, you've already been digging in the wrong place.

*** Still something right about pursuing new transport, even if it can't deliver the utopian results we'd like. Don't care too much if it is hyperloop or otherwise.

*** Misspelled guillotine. I appreciate the cyclical approach to patterned redistribution. It still doesn't solve the fundamental problem.

*** Ah. Well, maybe we'll get some coffee or a beer. At least she could meet the retarded brother.
**** ~~Decentrality summit...hrm. Maybe already met the smart one. Will my quasi-bacon number to [[kicks]] finally come down to 2 hops (we'll find a way to make a beer, surely)?~~ Fine, fine. I'll meet you one day, homie. Warning: I usually hug my lost loves for over a minute, sometimes in tears.

*** Gorgeous. Reminds me of teleosemantics and a class I had on intentionality. Cool AF. Watched it more than once.
*** Also gives us virtue-theoretic habituation of cognitively engineered judgment which can sit underneath our ability to reflect which modifies our phenomenology past initial perception (though I disagree on what counts as perception). Cognition does shape it, it plays a role. How voluntaristic and the timetables on training are likely highly contextual.
*** Don't see a strong enough argument of perceptions, as he defines them, as lacking propositional content or structures. 
*** Sapir-Whorfian imposition. 
*** Not sure why we should think he's bought himself as much as he does though. The problem may begin in how he even wields the word concept here. Why "all"? 
**** Cognition may still be necessary even if it doesn't present here. One system seems more fundamental than the other though. Don't see a reductio here. Fine, evidence. Yeah, I see that. XD.
