It is said that the child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth. I hope to choose my mentors and villages wisely. I rarely concede my [respect owed to authorities] to the humans I meet in person, although often to those whom I read. Demonstrate your kindness in writing. I will think long and hard about the nature of your argument and who you are. It is proof to me.
