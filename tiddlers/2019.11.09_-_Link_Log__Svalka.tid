* Disconfirm My Bias

*** My god, I can't believe I'm reading these charlatan's words and taking them seriously. Ofc, they have so much riding on making that picture stick too.

*** Fine. That's not nothing for an answer. 
*** I still have nagging doubts though. In a sell-off from a market crash, index funds won't be able to dump without taking a huge hit (active make money on this, which is part of the argument); that really might throw fuel on the fire though (why shouldn't I think that isn't a huge bubble still?). I guess my remaining concern is how passive stockholders do not participate as stakeholders in decision procedures, and that is a process in which active traders may acquire a ridiculous political edge.

*** Lots of excellent work in here. You forgot Aristotle's most important moves in reasoning about telos and eudaimonia. Sounds like McIntyre.

*** Birth lottery, [[VOI]], so, of course, they must have a democratic voice. It's we as [[Humanity]].
