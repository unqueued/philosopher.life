title: 2019.12.31 - Prompted Introspection: Thankful

!! How do you feel on Thanksgiving? What are you thankful for?

It depends on the Thanksgiving. I've been through a few decades worth, and they can be fairly different. I tend to be thankful for having time to talk with people I love (and like in many cases). I'm always thankful for food. I'm thankful for my [[monster]]s, always (<3). I'm thankful for the sleep and pleasure I have (and, of course, I want moar). I'm thankful my offspring are yet another year older than they were last Thanksgiving. I'm thankful that my work tends to be limited during the holiday.
