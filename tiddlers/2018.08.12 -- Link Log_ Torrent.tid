* Stunning!
** https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/1639-hegel-and-the-metaphysics-of-contingency
*** I adore how this is written.

* KYS
** https://www.economist.com/briefing/2015/01/22/an-hereditary-meritocracy
*** So beautifully paints the picture, only then to act like "oh well, there's nothing to do about it..."

* Preach, yo!
** https://www.thecut.com/2018/08/my-life-as-a-psychopath.html?
*** I talk a lot of trash about dark triads. This was a wonderful example of someone reasoning carefully about it.

* Confirm My Bias
** https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/the-battle-that-erupted-in-charlottesville-is-far-from-over/567167/
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/opinion/facebook-social-wealth.html
*** Not everything is right, but something is. It's like being wealthy enough to eat healthily in some analogical sense.
** https://www.popehat.com/2018/04/18/lawsplainer-can-a-state-university-fire-a-professor-for-being-an-ass-on-twitter/
*** I have no chance to be myself, no doubt.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://epochemagazine.org/theres-something-about-walking-25069bab306c
*** Shit argument. There is something about walking, but it's not this.

* Think About It
** https://epochemagazine.org/a-disdain-for-the-discrete-how-art-transcends-logic-and-language-fa9f0eb30734
*** I can agree mostly to the conclusion. I think the problem is where we logically justify when to stop using logic.
** https://epochemagazine.org/the-incomplete-self-g%C3%B6del-and-the-brain-7f5ddb29fe3a
*** So desparately wants to avoid Platonism. That isn't my reading at all!
** https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/04/i-resent-the-fact-that-wealthy-men-i-have-never-met-are-in-total-control-of-my-fate/
*** Not freaking out enough, imho. If you think Pinker's right, Jesus.
** https://zohaib.me/upgradeable-smart-contracts-in-ethereum/
*** The [[Outopos]] VM might be able to do some fuzzy work here that would be quite powerful. Upgrading contracts should be as easy as using sigs to do it.

* Fishy
** https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/america-continues-to-ignore-the-risks-of-election-hacking
*** Seems like you can't see the answer though...

* Interesting
** https://epochemagazine.org/pulling-the-normative-threads-of-heideggers-das-man-ae8e0a5fe3f
*** Sounds like virtue theory to me.
