!! Why does your family struggle to persist through pain and failure?

Sometimes we do not pass the marshmellow tests, bear through pain of imperfections, and we're impatient. We want it easy. We feel bad when it doesn't work instantly for us. We've not trained ourselves correctly. We have to slowly become virtuous at the practice of practicing, and we've got to start taking more and more risks in a wise fashion.

Is there something about our culture, memetics, and interactions that prevent us from improving this? How can we make sure we help each other through our frustrations? How can we have the right attitudes and dispositions towards our work and each other (and ourselves)? I don't know. 

Proving to ourselves that it's worth it to be wrong, to not feel bad about it, and to be practical. That is not our usual. This is a key to our happiness.
