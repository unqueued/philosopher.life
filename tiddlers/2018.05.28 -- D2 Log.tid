title: 2018.05.28 -- D2 Log

I feel like I've finished off my softcore for now. I stopped playing for a bunch of reasons. I'm trying out HC now. It seems pretty obvious to me that the necro is wildly the safest option.

Got to A2. Shopped for a +3 Skelly wand. Found an eth +2 skelly shield. I have way more +skill gear than I'm used to having at this point. Andy was an easy fight. Duriel is always the real test for me. I die more to him than any other boss in my experience. I will prep hard for him. 

+2 chipped skull helm. On Softcore, I just don't give a shit if I'm at 75% health most of the time, but I absolutely must care on HC. Replenish is a stat that matters to me, even if it is incredibly weak.

I think anytime I drop to half, I need to ask myself why. I need to assess how I almost died. 

I'm dumping everything into Stamina, except 10 str for a belt.

Runewords I'm considering:

* Stealth - 'TalEth' - lvl17, caster armor is very hard to find
* Lore - 'OrtSol' - lvl27, Dat +1 skills helm
* Ancient's Pledge - 'RalOrtTal' - lvl21, All Resist, Shrunken Head, 3 sockets though...P Diamonds do well.
* Spirit - 'TalThulOrtAmn' - lvl25, weapon and shield, excellent stats
* Insight - 'RalTirTalSol' - lvl27, A2 merc weapon that makes life easier...needs leech though. =/

+skill gear is truly powerful on the necro. The necro, sorc, and assassin have enormous pressures to invest in all three skill trees, imho. The necro, by far, is the best at it. At mid to high end, his curses are 1-point wonders. He's immediately the best enchanter/CCer/buffer/debuffer for the cost of 9ish points. CE is the single strongest ability in the game to the point that it doesn't even scale and still wrecks the world. I'm a fan of Bone Armor on SC too, since for 1 point you pickup ~150HP against physical. 

I suppose I plan on grinding Baal for quite a while, picking up full P-Topaz armor and helm for the occasion. There is no reason not to hit max level and picking up major D2 Classic gear that matters to me. 

I definitely want to rush to Baal in NM because that's where all the money loot begins to really drop, imho. 

Ultimately, the sorc would be nicer, but it's so dangerous. The goal, imho, is to farm enough enough gear for the sorc to be tremendous from the beginning. I may never get there. The fact is that Hell Mephisto is the best source of gear in the game for solo play. It's the singularity that catapults you into the end game where you farm runewords. The necro is likely the safest method to get to having a sorc that is safe enough.
