title: FTO: Invitation Cards

//[[Business Cards]], [[FTO: Ping]], and [[Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind]] do a specific kind of work which I've found valuable.//

I would like to just start inviting strangers to eat dinner with us. I'd like to just ask them, hand them my info, and if they want to eat with us, great. If they don't, no problem. Depends on our sitcheeayshun, I guess, and my wife's desires. What should this card look like?
