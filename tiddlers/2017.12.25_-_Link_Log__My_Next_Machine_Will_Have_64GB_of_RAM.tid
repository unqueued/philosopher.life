* Stunning!
** https://qz.com/1007144/the-neo-fascist-philosophy-that-underpins-both-the-alt-right-and-silicon-valley-technophiles/
*** QZ? Sometimes, you have a gem. This is one.
*** Accelerationist in its support of capitalism because it's Redpilled Prescriptive. Good work, fellow human.

* KYS
** http://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownload-March2009/licence.php?lang=us&type=GeForce
*** No datacenter deployment. I am such a hypocrite for continually going Nvidia after my 6850's.
** http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-housing-supply/
*** Boomers in power.

* Preach, yo!
** https://theblog.okcupid.com/your-looks-and-your-inbox-8715c0f1561e
*** Bastion of Redpill Science. 

* Confirm My Bias

*** Still not ready.
** https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/12/could-facebook-be-tried-for-war-crimes/548639/
*** Who or what is sovereign in a globalized world? Transnationals alone have the power. Overlords consolidate.
** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18262-5
*** Sounds right.

*** I have some disagreements. We should be panicked, btw. It shows something important though.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15999132
*** Fuck, I didn't know that about Trim on LUKS
** https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/22/16808964/california-weed-laws-legal-prop-64-safe-labs
*** Ugh.

* Think About It
** https://www.reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/7lotwo/girls_dont_game/drnzspe/
*** I agree with much of what he has said, but I think he also doesn't have the integrity to realize that everyone is actually playing this game. Some people are more consciously aware of it that others, and some are more naturally gifted. He's deluding himself into thinking the Redpill Description doesn't apply to himself. Still, this was a worthy post to read, even if it is wrong in crucial ways.
** https://www.poynter.org/news/text-only-news-sites-are-slowly-making-comeback-heres-why
*** Is it really making a comeback? I think there is some backlash, some purists, some people who love the minimalist, text-based web (/raises-his-hand). Most people prefer shiny because they are stupid. The Web 1.0 and 2.0 divide is still quite real. Browsers and mobile operating systems continue to evolve around the universal virtual machine platform that we call the Web, based upon running javascript inside of on-the-fly sandbox/VMs. 
** https://mosaicscience.com/story/neuroplasticity
*** This is poorly expressed. They need to talk about neuroplasticity as computation itself.
*** This was perhaps too optimistic. It felt like salemanship when it didn't cleanly articulate distinctions between innate neuroplasticity and our ability to directly shape it.
** https://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/surveys_and_polls/2017/rwjf441554
*** This survey is being wielded poorly on the web.

* Fishy
** http://thehill.com/policy/defense/366290-russian-submarine-activity-increases-around-under-sea-internet-cables
*** Get skeered, yall. I think this is symbolic, nothing more. And, I think it's meant to destabilize. Furthermore, I think both parties are responsible for engaging in warfare with the boogeyman.
** http://bloomsmag.com/the-scientific-evidence-for-microaggressions-is-weak-and-we-should-drop-the-term-argues-review-author/
*** Some good points here. It's a postmodern problem, of course. I doubt the author's intentions, of course.
** http://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-concerned-trump-fire-mueller-constitutional-crisis-758302
*** Uh, we are already in a constitutional crisis.
** https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/
*** Unsubstantiated, and yet I still believe large swathes of this story. More problematically, I will continue to assert my distrust in the neo-Wikileaks.
*** "Since at least the 1970s, authentic actors like unions and churches have folded under a sustained assault by free-market statism, transforming “civil society” into a buyer’s market for political factions and corporate interests looking to exert influence at arm’s length. The last forty years has seen a huge proliferation of think tanks and political NGOs whose purpose, beneath all the verbiage, is to execute political agendas by proxy."

* Interesting
** https://www.theinformation.com/google-ramps-up-mobile-chipmaking-with-talent-from-apple
*** IBM is reincarnated; Google continues oozes into premium full-control ecosystem like Apple; Intel is dying.
