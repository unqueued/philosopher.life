title: 2019.08.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Missed

* Woke at 7:15
** Thank you dear.
** Intense dreams, half-brained sleep.
* Work
** One of the most draining experiences this year. I hated every minute of it. All my spoons are spent, lol.
* Talked with my offspring
** They actually missed me today. Lol. I am shocked. Those poor, brainwashed fools. They wanted to talk with me and have dialectures. 
* Walked with wife
** Pissed in the woods too. Did my walk-dance, and my wife was embarrassed, lol! 
* Napped
** I could not stay awake, but I didn't really sleep.
* Pizza, watermelon
* BCS
* Read+Write
** Sat AFK in WoW. Literally nothing to do.
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 1
