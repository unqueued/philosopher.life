How's your weekend going?
SUN 5:47 PM
I apologize for not responding earlier. My parents left out Monday morning. Samantha and Kathy Kathy left out this afternoon to go to her mother's in Indiana.
TUE 4:50 PM
You're good. I know you've been busy on top of recovering.

I hope it went well. I hope you're feeling better too.
TUE 4:51 PM
I am feeling relief which is a big deal. I'm also feeling the need for recovery and change.
TUE 4:52 PM
This image shows all of the Kratom I own dumped onto the ground not to be recovered
TUE 4:52 PM
I have began my withdrawal process around 2 today. Of course I'm utilizing others substances to substitute. I am committed
TUE 4:53 PM
I have a substantial amount of cannabis at the ready. But unfortunately that is not my best option
TUE 4:54 PM
Sounds super difficult. =/
TUE 4:54 PM
How long with the withdrawals last?
TUE 4:55 PM
I consider ciggaretts more difficult.
TUE 4:56 PM
I should. Be don't with physical. WD in 2 - 5 days. Then it's all just mental.
TUE 4:56 PM
I have my Valium. Already taken and it has stopped alot of symptoms. I have this as well

TUE 4:57 PM
I have physical therapy tomorrow and Friday as well as what I'm suppose to do that the house. And I have a whole garage that needs organizing.
TUE 4:58 PM
How hard is the PT?
TUE 4:58 PM
Less painful than what I imagined
TUE 4:59 PM
Noice.
TUE 4:59 PM
They discourage pushing into the pain threshold. According to them it is counter productive.
TUE 4:59 PM
Not an injusy you can push through to recovery. Currently waiting on my short term disibility claim to process.
TUE 5:00 PM
Even if it doesn't. I don't know that I can keep working on helicopters. 90miles away from home.
TUE 5:01 PM
=/
TUE 5:01 PM
I don't think the work is as bad as 3hrs a day in the car.
TUE 5:02 PM
It could always be worse. Mathew kilcoyn is a reminder of where I could. Be if I push too hard too soon.
TUE 5:02 PM
End up paralyzed and your mother wiping your ass cause your wife left you and took your kid.
TUE 5:03 PM
He has a resilance I admire. =)
TUE 5:03 PM
I am optimistic about his future. It's definitely been a crazy hard road for him.
TUE 5:03 PM
It has. My road has grown softer and softer. And with it I grow weaker and softer myself.
TUE 5:04 PM
Lol. Today was a first step towards regaining control (in my head)
TUE 5:05 PM
A generic response is appriciated. Judge. Me as you wish. But I judge myself far more than any other man will ever know.
TUE 5:55 PM
Ah, I was at work. Hard to respond.
TUE 6:13 PM
Well, I hope you are able to come off the Kratom and feel free of it. I know it can't be easy.
TUE 6:14 PM
I will be findm. Liquor is gone.
TUE 6:57 PM
Bqahaha
TUE 6:57 PM
I can't resist the canibis.
TUE 10:42 PM
Is the resistance worth it.
TUE 10:43 PM
I can turn it down in a few days.
TUE 10:43 PM
Your opinion is desired. From a personal. Not. Probably feasional.
TUE 10:43 PM
I have no problem with cannabis used wisely. I know you are concerned with drugtesting, and it sounds like you can't study the for the test you'd have.
TUE 11:00 PM
My concern is that you are on short-term disability.
TUE 11:00 PM
You are recovering from injury.
TUE 11:01 PM
You likely have a heightened chance to be tested.
TUE 11:01 PM
I'm not saying not to do it though. Seems permissible either way to me.
TUE 11:02 PM
Meh. The benifit is that after canibis has been injestes. Much like alcohol,u brain develops solutions. As the fake pee with hand warmer in my bedside table. And how I hate driving 180 miles just to commute back. And  forth. Each day...
TUE 11:05 PM
It's 60-70 a yea r worth it?
TUE 11:05 PM
Meh. Not when they take so. Much for. Heathcare
TUE 11:06 PM
$500 amotn per gas plus $4 and hr for their share then a $3200 dwdictable
TUE 11:06 PM
And $250+ a month  gas
TUE 11:07 PM
It is an excellent wage. I don't know if it would be feasible to find something comparable for you.
TUE 11:07 PM
$500 for medical then $250 for gas....
TUE 11:07 PM
Nah. I take less if I quit.
TUE 11:08 PM
