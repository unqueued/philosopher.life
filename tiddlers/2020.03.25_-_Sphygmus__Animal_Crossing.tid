[12:40 PM] h0p3: How's it going?
[12:41 PM] robotic_scarab: it goes! metro area had a stay-at-home order announced over the weekend & is in place today
[12:42 PM] robotic_scarab: more-or-less successfully working remote yesterday, today, and until told not to I guess!
[12:42 PM] robotic_scarab: diving full force into the distraction of video games, XP
[12:42 PM] robotic_scarab: you all?
[12:43 PM] h0p3: We have a stay-at-home order too. Only "the head of household" is allowed to go shopping during a specific timeframe.
[12:43 PM] h0p3: We are allowed to walk around our house though.
[12:43 PM] h0p3: I'm glad you get to remote. That is excellent.
[12:44 PM] robotic_scarab: sounds more restrictive than ours; at least they specified that outdoor activities like biking & walking were allowed here
[12:44 PM] h0p3: I'm hoping that you'd be given the freedom to remote into work more long-term.
[12:44 PM] h0p3: Enjoy the vidya games. I have been distracting myself with games too. Magic.
[12:45 PM] h0p3: Nothing else is too different for us though. Just hanging in there.
[12:47 PM] robotic_scarab: Hanging in there, I hear ya
[12:47 PM] robotic_scarab: I can tell not having the regular social contact of work & friends coming over is getting to me though - usually I'm never social on reddit/discord, in terms of leaving comments or actually chatting in channels with multiple people
[12:48 PM] robotic_scarab: the amount of my doing either of those things has gone way up over the past week!
[12:50 PM] h0p3: That makes sense. I hope it will be a sufficient substitute. I think it's similar for me too. I've contacted people I haven't seen in years. Coming out of the lurkermode shell.
[12:51 PM] robotic_scarab: I haven't made the jump into voice channels yet
[12:51 PM] h0p3: I don't do voice, lol. Maybe I should.
[12:51 PM] robotic_scarab: I think hanging out "in the same room" on voice would be comforting / connecting, but it's hard to figure out where to start & with who
[12:56 PM] h0p3: Not a lot of voice activity in the Discord servers I've joined. Do you have any methods of finding Discord servers systematically? Mine seems to be completely random. I've stumbled across it.
[12:57 PM] robotic_scarab: no systematic methods, no
[12:57 PM] robotic_scarab: I'm playing animal crossing right now, and there's a very laid-out, very active fandom discord - not really talked to anyone in that, but it led me to another discord which is much smaller & more chill
[12:58 PM] robotic_scarab: had a good time talking to people there yesterday
[12:58 PM] robotic_scarab: it seems the smaller discords are where it's at for talking, but b/c they're smaller it also makes them harder to find
[1:14 PM] h0p3: That is a good point. In a way, Discord is well suited to building very tight communities on the fly.
[1:16 PM] h0p3: My cousin, [[L]], has been playing Animal Crossing too. She says it is a social game. She said it would be great to connect. Sohalia
[1:22 PM] robotic_scarab: Awe! I will add her! :blush:
