* [[Music: Library]]
** I'm glad to clean it up. The [[S2NR]] is considerably better. I'm hoping we'll finally be in a position to automate. 
* [[2019.06.19 - Wiki Audit: Remodel Redeux?]]
** I won't say I'm committed, but I like that I'm doing it. Even if I'm the only person who ever gives a shit about it, it's way cool.
* [[2019.06.19 - Wiki Review: Evolve]]
** That book seems like a waste of my time. I feel like I'm wasting my time with it, but I think it could be useful to the offspring to see my own definitions.
* [[2019.06.19 - TDL: Read]]
** I didn't get nearly as much done as I'd have liked to. Ugh.
* [[2019.06.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: All Wise & Shit]]
** Completed. I need to stop drinking.

** Edited. I'd much rather just call those who are Christ-like "Christians" and ignore what people identify as.
* [[2019.06.19 - Prompted Introspection: For Tomorrow]]
** And, yet, you are one dumb mother fucker, [[h0p3]].
* [[2019.06.19 - Link Log: Phil]]
** I hate that I sound like that. Fuck me. What else can I do? It's da tru tru, nowhaimean?
