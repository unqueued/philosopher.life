title: 2018.10.02 - Sphygmus: Wrong Again

So, I noticed I had an instance where I wanted autocompletion today. I installed it again. I have now used it 4 times today. Clearly, I was wrong about it (surprise!). I'm gonna see how I can milk this badboy harder (if I can). 

Also [[Tags]] is a thing. These are tags I'm convinced by. I'm still thinking about where I'm going here, especially since I aim to go through the entire wiki to restructure, tag, and draw out new threads for myself.

[[j3d1h]] setup [[Sphygmus: Stylesheet]] for CS. Currently using webfont, but will work towards embedding (16kB is fine). The title coloration might be gore, lol. Sticky Titles is the problem, but I really need my Sticky Titles. I have no idea how to fix that.
