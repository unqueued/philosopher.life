//I worshipingly roar this page to [[Madame Ronna Burger]]. I will forever remember how you crystallized paranoic charity for me. Thank you.//

Beware, audience, I use this word "[[Straussian]]" often, and, unfortunately, I incestuously use it Straussianly! I can't give you a perfect definition of reading between the lines, though I feel like I know it when I see it. Oh, yes, you should be quite suspicious, but you already play the Straussian game in doing so. In Straussianism, you are skeptical of everyone, especially yourself. Interpretation in language is paranoic inside and out. It is a [[Redpill]]ed reading style/process that takes itself to be failing if it doesn't construct any [[Diamonds]]. 

Even though I largely disagree with Strauss on a great deal, there's something right about his systematic hermeneutical approach. I make no claims to being skilled in this high art. Please forgive my arrogance.

One of my teachers is Leo Strauss. I'm actually in his academic lineage, as Strauss was my professor's professor's professor. Strauss was a profound political philosopher because he understood what empathizing with the author really means. Most people have no idea how to be charitable (perhaps including me); they suck at it. Even some of the most well-read people I've met still don't know how to read [[W5H]] it matters most. As an autist, my contrarian interpretatin' skill is in perceiving some of the dots the rest of you modelers sometimes cannot; the small things add up into a different picture (which doesn't make it correct). Forgive the blindness in my top-down modeling failures, please.

Orthodox Jewish children receive a very special kind of training and methodology for interpreting their holy text, and I received a similar kind growing up. There is a reverence and mind-bending sacrificial charity that one uses to coherentify and make sense of otherwise major contradictions throughout our holy texts. We must construct elaborate interpretations and theological frameworks to understand the real truth. Yes, it screams GNOSTICISM! Yet, if the bellcurve shows us anything, the edge of knowledge in [[The Great Human Conversation]] is inherently gnostic in that context. You have not seen what charity is until you worship a text and its author(s) almost like a diety that can do no wrong. Obviously, such effort and trust must be granted shrewdly.

If there is something wrong appearing in the text, then on this Straussian interpretation style, there must surely be something wrong in our own understanding. It is up to us to uncover the real meaning. This extends beyond the usual basic steelmanning of arguments expected in the analytic philosophy tradition.

Strauss paranoically and gnostically interpreted writings. He took things at literal face value that others take to be metaphor, and vice versa. He looked for the hidden signs and meanings, deep narratives, and unified constructions emerging and evolving as issued from an author's mouth. He took the limits of writing very seriously,  and his methodical self-doubt was extremely valuable in understanding [[others]] (especially the [[Saints]]).

The [[agi]] considerations are huge in this practice. Realpolitik considerations are also essential. Understanding the stage of the threatre, the context, and the nested experience machines pointing to the author's telos appears necessary. I could only [[hope]] to read a [[gem]] as carefully as it has been written.
