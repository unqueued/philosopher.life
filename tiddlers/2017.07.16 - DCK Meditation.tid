I haven't felt very militant as of late. I also think I'm fairly powerless. No problems there. I still aim to protect us, but I think it has be more underground.

I am reminded of a piece I consumed on evolution. Tropical fish, especially near coral, often have a very high evolution rate. They change rapidly. They're more malleable. They evolve quickly over the generations. Interestingly, this rate isn't necessarily adaptive in and of itself. The rate at which we change is also part of The Good. Trying to evolve too quickly can be a bad thing.  

Should our minds evolve that quickly?

Stability is key. I need a homebase with enormous stability for my family. I can see my brother's stability is incredibly valuable. I think his situation sometimes feels empty, but stable. Full chaos is hard. 

---

I feel depersonalized (DCK, duh). It is clear that human lives are wild rides. We can't anticipate what they'll be like. Craft a narrative you enjoy. It is daunting how wild west it really is. I still fail to appreciate this too often. It makes Moral Life infinitely more complicated, as usual. I'm not saying anything new here. This is just the phenemonology of it, which is overwhelming.

I think it will take 30 years for my children to learn what they have to know. The floor keeps rising. There is too much to know. Our ancient human brains aren't designed to make sense of this postmodern swirl. I can't protect them from it, but I've got to give them the right tools to survive it and hopefully thrive in it. 

I am capital to be used in the all consuming machine around me. It's a vortex, a stack, etc. I will try to create a safe place for my children, to germinate their lives and cultivate them. I didn't understand the world was this awful when I brought them into the world. Now I must protect them with everything I have. I must allow the sparks to grow into fires; I cannot suffocate them, but I must give them all the necessary ingredients, and find the right sufficient mix to achieve Eudaimonia. 

Dune has to be one of the best books I've ever read. That scene with Alia in the womb is hard potent. There are many potent scenes to it.

---

Geniuses are capital to be abused in the structure. They are sometimes harnessed and often discarded. This is the nature of being different. Does a society want you? Probably not. Can it use it? If so, fine. It will exploit you.

---

I consider myself to be existentially grim. Grim like the dwarves in a way, I guess.

Tears on DCK. It hasn't happened in a while. 

I am so worried that I can't make my children happy. I want to write a section on my wiki like I were God. I feel like I'm responsibible for the happiness of my creations.  

It's time to empathize with God. I'm not sure what my wife will think of that. I don't mean to offend her. I think this is a spiritual problem we must carefully think about. 

What does it mean to empathize with a non-omnipotent, non-omniscient God? Say God wasn't so transcendent.

Being a Parent and being like God are similar. This is a classic among classics meme, of course. And yet, I'd love to read a very succinct summation of it. I wish I understood it more.

---

How do I help my children develop a profound bond with each other? They must be the best of friends for life. Who else will be able to empathize with them as well as each other? 

---

I want to write a letter to my future children. They need context. They need footholds. They need to have a perspective to make sense of it. They need a way to look inside themselves That should be a log.

---

Dear Children,

---

Jesus. It reminds me of something my mother was doing.

My mother was correct. She tried setting up an e-mail account to do this very thing. Her letters weren't what they needed to be though. She attempted to do it too late. She no longer can empathize effectively enough. 

I want to tell my mother, S, that I love her. Life is hard. My brain is doing it's thing again.

---

I have two conceptions or interpretations of my mother. I have to let the idealized version go. That's not reality. Be practical. 

It's the love that makes it hurt so fucking much.

I long for what I had. But, I can't have it again. What would the stoic say?

The splinter in my mind is still there though. I cannot find it, but it radiates and affects everything that I see and understand. What is the missing puzzle piece? 

---

Why can't I just hug everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????

I'm crying. 

I just want the world to be happy. Please.

I must do something about it for my children.

I can't stop crying on this DCK trip. It's hard. I'm really glad I had the chance to do it. Thank you, k0sh3k. Thank you for encouraging me. It was the right choice.

It is a very garbled experience today. Change is not easy. 

---

Have I fucked it all up? Can I help my kids be happy? Will they be able to socialize, find people they love, etc? I am so scared for them because I feel really lucky to have the people I do have. Will I have raised them in such a way that they can connect with the people that fulfill their lives, that make them happy? 

Be a simple kind of man, right? Ignorance is bliss. I am very scared for my children. There are so many unknowns. I'm so deeply worried, anxious, torn-up, sinew-twisted inside about it. I feel like I personally have trouble jumping these hurdles, how in the fuck could I cultivate my precious children into being able to jump over these as well? If life is the Non sequitur of non sequiturs, how can I possibly prepare them? 

A fish out of water is so absurdy understated here. I don't know what I'm going to do about it.

Philosophers were little computers in rooms, hacking through the void. They were the rational magicians. I was so sad to see how little we knew. It was devastating. It's like going into the engine room and finding out the cake has been a lie and we've been running on the fumes the entire time.
