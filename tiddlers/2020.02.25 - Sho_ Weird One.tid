Sorry for diversion, I'll continue the conversation in time but, for now: Any chance that facebook thing you set up for me is still an option? I'll explain later

Oh and, if it is, is it possible to make the name Shosh Anam?

Update... I think I've got it sorted. Will let you ken! ðŸ¤£

Yup. It's still working. I recently had to use that FB account to check on someone, lol.

If you want it to be yours, you'll need to change the password.

I don't know if it can be renamed. I don't follow FB user procedures closely anymore.

Hey dude. Well, I've got one the now so let's leave that one as is; you use it as needed and if I ever want to make it mine for reals I'll let you ken :)
