I am interested in trying Mescaline some day. I can see that it helped the Wachowski Sisters, as they claim in [[The Matrix]]. It is extremely well-written. Holy fuck. He was always a visionary.

We are both clearly moved by our lack of vision in some respects. We are quite aware of our Bayesian fallibility. 

Interesting phenomenology log of his trip. 

It is fascinating to see that Buber would decry my work. His work is interesting to me. There are few theologians I take to be decent philosophers. He was one of them, imho.
