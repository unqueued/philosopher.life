title: 2019.04.15 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Internalizing

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
If you quietly accept and go along no matter what your feelings are, ultimately you internalize what you're saying, because it's too hard to believe one thing and say another. I can see it very strikingly in my own background. Go to any elite university and you are usually speaking to very disciplined people, people who have been selected for obedience. And that makes sense. If you've resisted the temptation to tell the teacher, "You're an asshole," which maybe he or she is, and if you don't say, "That's idiotic," when you get a stupid assignment, you will gradually pass through the required filters. You will end up at a good college and eventually with a good job.

I'm not convinced everyone has this internalization in all cases. It's pretty obvious to me that many people believe one thing and say another. Disillusionment can be like this, but so can malicious deception. I'll agree that it's quite difficult to have an integrated identity under these circumstances though, especially having one which is incompatible with the world around you.

I'll agree there is an incredible degree of obedience in the dialectics, hierarchies, and norms of higher learning. Sometimes that's a good thing. There's a way in which the best way to learn is going to require obedience [[irwartfrr]]. Obviously, sitting between two vices, we can easily be wrong about that [[irwartfrr]]ness. I must be a fool or a sycophant because I'm having a hard time coming up with assignments I felt were idiotic in grad school. Undergrad was a different beast. It's true: I didn't tell my professors they were assholes, and I went out of my way not to say it. Time and again, I have found many of those who have been assholes to me helped me in the end; it was a learning experience (call it Stockholm Syndrome if you must).

The good job never materialized.
