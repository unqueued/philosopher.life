type: text/plain

Y'all working tomorrow?
SUN 11:42 PM
Nope. Kids have school, but nothing else.
SUN 11:43 PM
No summer break?
SUN 11:43 PM
As I have said, I have less than 1000 days of school with my daughter.
SUN 11:43 PM
They do get days off, but my children are competing against a great number of students around the world who work 12-16 hours a day on school year round.
SUN 11:44 PM
I have taught and tutored these students.
SUN 11:45 PM
Indeed. Competition is feirece.
SUN 11:45 PM
Didn't know if you were treating this like a weekend night or just a normal Sunday.
SUN 11:46 PM
We stayed up a bit later tonight after family time.
SUN 11:47 PM
They get to sleep in, so it's not a big deal. We're about to start season 3 of Breaking Bad.
SUN 11:47 PM
Love that series. Don't let me interrupt time with you and the wife.
SUN 11:48 PM
Ah, she's in bed sleeping. I'm the only one up.
SUN 11:48 PM
Ah. I'm drinking alone.
SUN 11:49 PM
Yup. Me too. I'll join you. =)
SUN 11:49 PM
I was the DD for a wedding. But we are home now. And dad gets a few beers.
SUN 11:49 PM
Wedding was good. Wife and kid had fun.
SUN 11:54 PM
That is good. I am grateful not to have to attend, but I am glad other people enjoy the occasion. Much closer to a funeral, as you pointed out.
SUN 11:55 PM
I ran mouth and my talked BS as  to be expected. To the guys I knew. A little forced. But wife had plenty of wine. Fun to see her let lose.
SUN 11:55 PM
Statistically we both know... It's a 50 50 chance they stay together.
SUN 11:56 PM
It is rare that I get to see my wife tipsy anymore. She falls straight asleep.
SUN 11:56 PM
It is likely a higher chance.
SUN 11:56 PM
50 50 sounds better...
SUN 11:57 PM
It's a number skewed by boomers and serial spouses. Younger crowd doesn't marry as often, and they seem to stick to it better so far. That may change, ofc. Yeah, 50/50 does have a clean sound to it.
SUN 11:57 PM
You and I are a rare breed to have been married as long as we have.
SUN 11:58 PM
Aye. Not many of our generation married so young.
SUN 11:58 PM
Very true. Lots of girls havin babies young though. Haha
MON 12:00 AM
Aye. That's changing slowly. Average age of first time mothers is rising. It now has a bimodal distribution to account for rising inequality (marriage being a class signal these days too).
MON 12:02 AM
That's another area where we diverge from the norm. Educated and had our children young. 19 is a helluva an age to have a kid.
MON 12:06 AM
It is odd, MTV idolized and puts them on TV "16 and pregnant" .
MON 12:07 AM
Indeed. You had an older wife. As did I.
MON 12:07 AM
For me, that made a difference.
MON 12:07 AM
I don't think they were idolized on that show, but I know some people claim it has.
MON 12:07 AM
I was 23.
MON 12:08 AM
Another thing that's different, usually men marry younger.
MON 12:08 AM
Why do you think married older?
MON 12:08 AM
I dated alot of young girls. They were crazy. Highly emotional and unpredictable. My wife ws 28 when we started dating. She had matured past that.
MON 12:11 AM
I think I was mature for my age. So in term sof what we wanted in life, we were on the same page.
MON 12:12 AM
How about you?
MON 12:12 AM
I think was mature in some respects for my age, but not in others. I'm a cross between an old man and a child. She's the only woman I've met with her knowledge and values, and that may have had something to do with her age.
MON 12:16 AM
There was a 18 to old guy in a dress as a bridesmade today.
MON 12:17 AM
Good times.
MON 12:17 AM
Thank God my daughter didn't even bat an eye. I was not in the mood to explain that one.
MON 12:17 AM
Even on a baseline level.
MON 12:18 AM
To many other kids to play with.
MON 12:18 AM
Win.
MON 12:18 AM
Catching up with the 8.0â€° 24oz beers.
MON 12:20 AM
Still gritting my teeth. Not dunk enough yet. I think I need a hangover tomorrow.
MON 12:20 AM
Fucked my back up at wedding. At the end. So went and sat in truck.
MON 12:21 AM
Ouch.
MON 12:21 AM
=/
MON 12:21 AM
Standing beside a table with a big trough of ice and water, young drunk guy lost balance and leaned on it to hard. Out of instinct I tried to catch it.
MON 12:22 AM
Ended up committing and helping clean up.
MON 12:23 AM
Pain from My should to my calf.
MON 12:23 AM
Shoulder
MON 12:23 AM
Meh. Truck has seat warmers with sumbar warmer. And lumbar support
MON 12:23 AM
Lmao.
MON 12:23 AM
Add in a chromebook with 4G or a tether and you are set.
MON 12:24 AM
I did forum research on mechanical stuff.
MON 12:27 AM
Research I needed to do anyway.
MON 12:28 AM
Looking at getting anither vehicle.
MON 12:28 AM
I dislike my car. (wife's hand me down)
MON 12:28 AM
And it seems I just don't see and end to leaving this job.
MON 12:29 AM
I've looked at it so many different ways.
MON 12:29 AM
And a cooler of beer knocks me out...
MON 12:30 AM
I can't successfully be a small business owner using my skills as a means for $
MON 12:30 AM
I will break.
MON 12:30 AM
Better to be a lazy government Contractor.
MON 12:31 AM
If that is the reality I'm 720-900miles a week. Commute.
MON 12:32 AM
I deserve a care I feel truely comfortable in.
MON 12:32 AM
Car
MON 12:32 AM
Hopefully, something which gets sick gas mileage
MON 12:32 AM
A cheap one too. Cause I'm gonna break. The fuck out of it... Lol
MON 12:33 AM
I need 25+
MON 12:33 AM
Run into any new good music?
MON 12:37 AM
None.
MON 12:38 AM
Haven't been looking.
MON 12:38 AM
I did try that show out you recommended.
MON 12:38 AM
It is funny. I can see why you like it.
MON 12:38 AM
Letter Kenny?
MON 12:38 AM
Not a fan?
MON 12:38 AM
Saying it is funny doesn't indicate you enjoyed it.
MON 12:38 AM
Enough to watch it more. Lol
MON 12:39 AM
The novelty of the show wore off for me.
MON 12:39 AM
Got through a season. Maybe watch more later.
MON 12:39 AM
Fair. It is, the same thing over and over. Very little plot development.
MON 12:39 AM
Just lots of one liners.
MON 12:40 AM
I use your wiki and click new. A d kinda click and scan thru what I haven't caught up on.
MON 12:43 AM
And skip what is beyond me or irrelevant.
MON 12:43 AM
You can click on the dates you open up all the entries for a day as well. My daughter built that function, and we all use it now. Makes it easier for us to scan through the content.
MON 12:44 AM
I like the fact you have conversations with your brother. But just post the basis of the convo.
MON 12:45 AM
I wish I had that closeness with you.
MON 12:45 AM
I don't think I ever will. We are of different fabric.
MON 12:45 AM
And that is OK
MON 12:46 AM
Those are phone conversations. I still post our chats.
MON 12:46 AM
I know.
MON 12:46 AM
Image attached to message
MON 12:48 AM
This was lacking effort in response.
MON 12:49 AM
Lol =)
MON 12:49 AM
Beginning with the statement itself. Why even allow the statement to exist.
MON 12:49 AM
I hope to pass with a B, sir.
MON 12:50 AM
"all I see is big government."
MON 12:50 AM
I'll give you a C cause yoll make an A on the next one.
MON 12:51 AM
Youll
MON 12:51 AM
It'll even out.
MON 12:51 AM
Maths...
MON 12:51 AM
=)
MON 12:51 AM
Your father's addictions.
MON 12:52 AM
Intrigued by this.
MON 12:52 AM
No other reason because I feel it gives a peek into ypu. That you never wanted to exist.
MON 12:53 AM
(that's deep)
MON 12:53 AM
If I could snap my fingers and undo it, I would. Lol. Unfortunately, that's not the position I find myself.
MON 12:54 AM
Addictive personalities all around in my family. We are neurotic people.
MON 12:54 AM
I empathize. ( in the Webster deff. Not [[h0p3]]'s wiki version.
MON 12:55 AM
(I hoop3 you laughed)
MON 12:55 AM
Lol. =)

Berea with wife when I was 21ish
MON 12:56 AM
Outside seabury
MON 12:56 AM
Cute memory.
MON 12:56 AM
I have picutes of the girls wedding i went to. She was a 8 year old when I got married. She was at the wedding.
MON 12:57 AM
We old AF bro
MON 12:58 AM
You are officially old.
MON 12:58 AM
You a year younger?
MON 12:58 AM
Something like that.
MON 12:58 AM
34 here. Born in Feb 85
MON 12:58 AM
33
MON 12:58 AM
Fucking signal won't load on my pc.
MON 1:07 AM
got it.
MON 1:07 AM
took like 5 tries.
MON 1:08 AM
I've heard the Windows client isn't so great.
MON 1:08 AM
I will have to try it out.
MON 1:08 AM
I can type better and more efficient on the PC
MON 1:08 AM
so in any mood to discuss any topics?
MON 1:09 AM
i have a habit of dominating conversation.
MON 1:09 AM
and it isnt healthy
MON 1:09 AM
or maybe bed? i dunno
MON 1:09 AM
Naw, I think it's fine. Some talk more than others. Let me take a piss, I'll brb.
MON 1:09 AM
i see, you talk to others, on your wiki. often in short gesture of little to no depth. I have depth of approx 0.75". and I am proud of that. it is, all i can bear in between the schedule I allow myself for interaction.
MON 1:12 AM
There is quite a range. Some people elicit huge responses from me. It's not as common for me to find depth in chat, but chat is easier and I enjoy it.
MON 1:14 AM
I've been experimenting with different approaches.
MON 1:14 AM
you should
MON 1:14 AM
The "@" approach I've been using to try to at least nod to others as a kind of body language that I'm following what they are doing. I often don't have a significant amount to say.
MON 1:15 AM
Or, I do, but I can tell they aren't interested in what I have to say, lol.
MON 1:15 AM
Letter writing is the largest time sink. Ridiculous amounts of time go into some of those letters.
MON 1:16 AM
chatting with you with you is an experiment.
MON 1:16 AM
Always is! =)
MON 1:16 AM
some times it is often shallow and uninvolved.
MON 1:16 AM
other times, it is beyond depth of responce. i gotta google too much
MON 1:17 AM
Trying to find the sweetspot.
MON 1:17 AM
It varies with people.
MON 1:17 AM
chat is the closest form to a casual conversation without actually having to have it.
MON 1:17 AM
I notice that I'm often stuck in shallow smalltalk with people over chat. It's rare that someone dives in withme.
MON 1:18 AM
true.
MON 1:18 AM
hence why i ask what is on your mind, di you have anything cool to discuss.
MON 1:18 AM
i cant follow you down the road of AI and the crazy shit you research
MON 1:19 AM
but i know the weather is good for crops.
MON 1:19 AM
bwahahaha
MON 1:19 AM
Lol
MON 1:19 AM
My Recent Obsessions in the Hub tab are an constantly updating list of my timesinks that aren't directly for work.
MON 1:20 AM
so who the fuck is kickscondor?
MON 1:21 AM
Reading several books, working on Greek & Latin Roots for the kiddos too, writing some letters.
MON 1:21 AM
thisis what i wanna know.
MON 1:21 AM
Ah
MON 1:21 AM
I cannot answer that question effectively. I do not know.
MON 1:21 AM
you sent me links to your wifes and kids wiki
MON 1:21 AM
i never got them to work
MON 1:21 AM
i tried, and even googled them
MON 1:21 AM
didnt work
MON 1:21 AM
no big deal
MON 1:21 AM
IIRC, I told you to remove the "s" from "https"
MON 1:22 AM
http://1uxb0x.philosopher.life/
MON 1:22 AM
That's my son.
MON 1:22 AM
but in the process of googling your kiddos and wifes wiki
MON 1:22 AM
Kicks has them listed on his site.
MON 1:22 AM
kickscondor linked to their wiki
MON 1:22 AM
yeah, so i immedietly went into dad mode and was ready to pummel somone.
MON 1:23 AM
lol
MON 1:23 AM
not knowing your kids or wife.
MON 1:23 AM
He will get a kick out of you saying that line.
MON 1:23 AM
i was automatically defensive.
MON 1:23 AM
It is one of our longstanding arguments for the past year.
MON 1:23 AM
He is defensive on my behalf too. I am probably borderline insane to him.
MON 1:24 AM
i glanced his writings. i wasnt intersted. the helterskelter approach at compling the musing of a bipolar mind it difficult.
MON 1:24 AM
i dont envy him...
MON 1:24 AM
Do you think he's bipolar?
MON 1:25 AM
you are more than enough.
MON 1:25 AM
you are all the above
MON 1:25 AM
lol
MON 1:25 AM
select E
MON 1:25 AM
smart dude. whatever, he ridiculed you and complimented you in the same verse.
MON 1:26 AM
i was annoyed.
MON 1:26 AM
there was no coherent direction of his blog.
MON 1:26 AM
neither is yours. but you catelogue it so well.... there is. it is there. you have to know how to click the buttons
MON 1:27 AM
I am still coming to understand the man. He may be significantly more intelligent than I am; we have different training. I think his blog is taking direction. I see him coming out of his shell dropping tentpegs.
MON 1:27 AM
He very gently asked for permission (quite roundabouts too) for posting those links.
MON 1:27 AM
I'm actually proud of this letter to him: https://philosopher.life/#2019.03.04%20-%20kickscondor
MON 1:27 AM
i read it.
MON 1:28 AM
skimmed it
MON 1:28 AM
glanced at it.
MON 1:28 AM
fuck you. i knew it existed
MON 1:28 AM
lol
MON 1:28 AM
lol
MON 1:28 AM
You should talk with him!
MON 1:28 AM
no
MON 1:29 AM
lol
MON 1:29 AM
no [[h0p3]]
MON 1:29 AM
yyou are more than i can handle
MON 1:29 AM
He is ridiculously nice. I'm a complete asshole compared to him (but, that's because I'm an asshole).
MON 1:29 AM
and you have no idea how busy this keeps me.
MON 1:29 AM
There is always room for one more at T-Money Inn.
MON 1:29 AM
and matthew kilcoyn
MON 1:29 AM
i sincerly want to give my attention to those i speak with.
MON 1:30 AM
and i do. be it text, impersonal, and nonsesne
MON 1:30 AM
I definitely can feel that with you too. I see that in your behavior.
MON 1:31 AM
i am devoted to that convo
MON 1:31 AM
and if it dries. i walk. its ok. LIFE happens.
MON 1:31 AM
and we pick up and move on
MON 1:31 AM
steven hicks just had skin cancer removed from his face
MON 1:32 AM
the guy is a literal guitar genisus
MON 1:32 AM
he is fucking rain man
MON 1:32 AM
This him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxk-pwYVkww
MON 1:33 AM
?
MON 1:33 AM
you can tell him what duration your intake lobe is onyour 302 ford and he can give you the necessary spring tension you need onyour head to compensate to keep a 10:1 compression
MON 1:33 AM
afraid not.
MON 1:34 AM
he had a 12 year old that would make uselook like children on guitar and drums
MON 1:34 AM
only been playing like 6 months
MON 1:35 AM
raw. savont tallent.
MON 1:35 AM
That's crazy.
MON 1:36 AM
I am envious.
MON 1:36 AM
I ever tell you that Brandon Love, my first roommate at Berea reached out to me while I was at Tulane?
MON 1:39 AM
that he pooped 4 times a day now
MON 1:39 AM
?
MON 1:39 AM
i remember he kept a regular schedule dialogue with his moms
MON 1:40 AM
you did not thought.
MON 1:40 AM
he was a good person. i thought.
MON 1:40 AM
in those days
MON 1:40 AM
lol, yeah, he was into schizer porn (not many fundies who enjoy it); he was a decent fellow
MON 1:40 AM
We would talk theology often, and I once told him that he was trying to do philosophy rather than Biblical interpretation.
MON 1:41 AM
So, years later he finds me (I try not to be easily found on the web). He went to school in Hong Kong for his PhD in philosophy.
MON 1:42 AM
His letters were hilarious (I don't have them anymore), he thanked me and called me an asshole at the same time in back to back letters.
MON 1:43 AM
I'll have to reach out to him someday to return the favor.
MON 1:44 AM
i had a girlfrined who did that.
MON 1:44 AM
lol
MON 1:44 AM
i suppose you know your an asshole.
MON 1:45 AM
but im not like, less of an asshole
MON 1:45 AM
so its not like... we are more asshole than each other.
MON 1:45 AM
Ass-2-ass 4 life.
MON 1:45 AM
you are more read and more intelligent. but I am still better at tact and delivering the message
MON 1:46 AM
inho.
MON 1:46 AM
That's probably right.
MON 1:46 AM
oh god. no
MON 1:46 AM
stop
MON 1:46 AM
no reliqrium for a dream shit.
MON 1:47 AM
you cant write a letter without sounding like an arrogant prick.
MON 1:47 AM
I've not shown the kiddos that one yet.
MON 1:47 AM
Yeah, can't help myself.
MON 1:48 AM
its word play, its questions, and its allowing to leave them un answered, but answer them later.
MON 1:48 AM
your philisophical wants to beat it to death.
MON 1:49 AM
I think if I weren't interested in The Moral Law (and hence the truth), I would be far more effective.
MON 1:49 AM
people dont wanna know they are stupid.
MON 1:49 AM
honestly
MON 1:49 AM
they wanna be coxed into believeing they were mislead
MON 1:49 AM
But, I do not want to manipulate.
MON 1:49 AM
I've had to write those letters before. You don't land half a million dollars of education without being able to write a letter in which others will find you likable.
MON 1:50 AM
the asburghers syndrome or whatever gets in the way
MON 1:50 AM
Indeed. I have to treat people like blackboxes to get what I want, and I don't want to do that.
MON 1:51 AM
indeed. i know you are capable.
MON 1:51 AM
but you arent willing.
MON 1:51 AM
disagree?
MON 1:51 AM
Naw. I think that's right.
MON 1:51 AM
10 4
MON 1:52 AM
i  try not to disagree with people
MON 1:53 AM
because i know... the facts are not relevant.
MON 1:53 AM
99
MON 1:53 AM
Oof. They are morally relevant. They aren't the means to your ends though.
MON 1:53 AM
99% of random arguments are won by who lost their shit first.
MON 1:54 AM
facts or not.
MON 1:54 AM
arent
MON 1:54 AM
are won by who lost shit. not fact.s
MON 1:54 AM
sorry. alcohol.
MON 1:54 AM
That's not an argument, from what I can tell. That's jousting for social positioning.
MON 1:55 AM
Via emotional appeal and appearance.
MON 1:55 AM
But, that's what most people are doing, obviously.
MON 1:55 AM
what the fuck is 99% of life?
MON 1:55 AM
point made.
MON 1:55 AM
Oh, I don't think that's what life is about though.
MON 1:56 AM
i didnt say that whats lifes about.
MON 1:56 AM
i said, 99% of my arguments of life are... nonsense
MON 1:57 AM
i didnt say that. its whati ment...
MON 1:57 AM
I try not to disagree with random people in person as well.
MON 1:58 AM
I hear floods of insanity around me. I think I'm spearfishing when I do point out my disagreement most of the time. My face will often give me away though.
MON 2:01 AM
Shifting a flat affect has been useful. I can hold back and people are less suspicious of the possibility that I think the words coming out of their mouths are absurd or evil.
MON 2:02 AM
i have been in your presence.
MON 2:04 AM
you are animalistic
MON 2:04 AM
Ah, yeah, when I'm in my element especially. I rarely come out to play in person now unless it is necessary or I know you.
MON 2:04 AM
that is good.
MON 2:05 AM
you have learned to deal well
MON 2:05 AM
i unfortuently cant hide my depression
MON 2:05 AM
and i am called out for it whenever.
MON 2:05 AM
which really makes it awesome.
MON 2:06 AM
like :
MON 2:06 AM
Which is absurd. My brother runs into the same with his coworkers.
MON 2:06 AM
"like(hey loook at trent shut up and concentrate on his work)  * must be something wrong with him. lets fuick with him. lol
MON 2:07 AM
you live and learn
MON 2:07 AM
play the game
MON 2:07 AM
its ridiculous
MON 2:07 AM
but if I had my way.... people would actually do their job and not bullshit. we would exceed govt contracts then be out of  a job.
MON 2:08 AM
dual edge sword.
MON 2:08 AM
Time for bed, homie. Sleep well. TTYL.
MON 2:10 AM
night homie
MON 2:10 AM
im just getting started.
MON 2:11 AM
:P
MON 2:11 AM
listen to the same sad songs over and over. eat ramen. pass out...... not long behind you sir.
MON 2:11 AM
