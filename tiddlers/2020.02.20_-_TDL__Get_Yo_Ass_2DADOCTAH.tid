* Dr's Appointment:
** Inhaler
** Your knee has hurt for weeks. Skeered.
** Explain January and what meds you took.
** Perhaps talk about your ear. That may open the door. Otherwise, they think you are just crazy.
** They should know about depression and anxiety, but I'm not convinced anything more here.
** Also, ur an idiot, and I love you: it's at 3:20.
* Read+Write
** Also, watch? Vidyas. I'd like to see you get serious about it.
** You've had nothing to say in [[Wiki Audit]], btw. That's okay. [[The Remodeling]] hasn't had any large shifts, but there has been digestion. Not sure what to do with that.
* Breakfast for dinner?
** Celebrate my high cholesterol with Bacon!
* Crack the whip
