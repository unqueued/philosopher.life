title: 2017.12.17 - Prompted Introspection Log: Wish to Tell

!! What do you wish you could tell someone, and who do you wish you could tell?

The prompts list is very wish-oriented. 

Anyways, is it just one person? Do I have to know the person, or can I iterate over the domain of persons who best meet certain qualifications (even if I might not even know their name)? Is it just me speaking? How long do I have to talk with them? I always hope to maximize my wish's value. In this case, I don't know how to wish for more wishes. 

I suppose I'd like to say whatever is necessary for maximizing global utility, which I'm convinced would ultimately result in the decentralization of power necessary to play around the effects of diminishing marginal utility across the population. So, I'd love to explain my point of view to someone who had the power to do something about it, but I think anyone with the power to do so would likely be unconvincible. 

Barring that, I'd love to be able to pour myself into someone who can do something with what I know. Unfortunately, it takes wrestling to see what I do, and I'd basically need to be caged with someone for a long time to get it out. That's not going to happen. In a way, I suppose that is what I'm doing with you, my wiki. I'm pouring myself into you, and in a way, I'm pouring myself into myself.

I want to tell myself whatever it is I need to tell myself in order to get myself to become a happy person. That seem realistically achievable.
