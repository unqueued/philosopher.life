title: 2018.10.04 - Retired: Daily Stack

Be efficient and effective. Have an action-packed life. Maximize your utility. Time is a resource; spend it wisely! You have to find the set of self-improving habits that works for you. You develop it. You iterate over it and improve your habits over time. Develop the right habits, and get then down cold. Make it so you understand the timings of your life requirements; learn how to adjust them and adapt to your environments. These are the kinds of habits and practices that "add up" in the long run: they snowball utility very hard.

Start your day off right. Don't just lay there. Don't screw around and find yourself having squandered your morning. Don't panic because you can't get everything done. Take the initiative, be consistent, and dive into the day! I can't just make you do it. You have to want to do it. You have develop it for yourself. I make suggestions here. I hope you take yourself and these ideas seriously.  Even if you only picked some of these each day, you'd be well-off.

Let me give you an example Daily Stack.<<ref "1">> Remember, you are trying to create your own. You have to choose to do it.
