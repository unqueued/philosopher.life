* Good job for surviving another one, punk.
* Hey, hey, hey, get high erry day.
* Probably not going to be able to bang. Your wife is not feeling well, especially with tide and rain against us. Just make sure her interview goes well, and see what you can do to alleviate the pressure for the day.
* I'd like to continue working on our machines and talking philosophy, as always, Pinky.
* Knight's Pizza sounds amazing. No reason to get anything else.
