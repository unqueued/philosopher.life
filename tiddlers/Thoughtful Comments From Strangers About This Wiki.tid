title: Thoughtful Comments From Strangers About This Wiki

//I see this place as being for me and by extension my family. It shows too. People tend to strongly dislike me and my work. But, I am open to the possibility I will [[Find the Others]] with this tool as well.//

Thanks for the help :-)

On an aside did you set out to make your wiki deliberately obtuse in terms of style? I like the style but it is quite hard to follow, it reminds me of n-o-d-e but more confusing :-P

That is a cool blog. I've never seen it before. We have a similar aesthetic.

On my {About} page, I say:

    I'm avoiding intentional obscurantism...

The style is hard to follow, and the project itself even harder to understand. I'm sorry about that. I apologize in my {About} section for that as well. As I said, my audience is primarily those who know me very well, especially to myself. Let me add, I'm a high-functioning autistic person.

My project is enormous (there's ~250 single-spaced pages of text in a 1mb text file, and my wiki is ~12MB in size created in the past 2 years) and it is difficult for me to organize by definition. That N-O-D-E blog is significantly smaller, extremely linear, and more focused in its projects. I think my wiki is not conventional, but I also don't think it is harder to understand than it has to be at the moment given where I'm at. Let me add, I'm obsessed with it, and I may not be able to see as clearly about aspects of it that you can; my top-down modeling is sometimes very poor.

I am open to suggestions, of course
