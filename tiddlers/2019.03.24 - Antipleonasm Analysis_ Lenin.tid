title: 2019.03.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Lenin

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Lenin was a right-wing deviation of the socialist movement and he was so regarded…by the mainstream Marxists… Bolshevism was a right-wing deviation.
<<<

We are outside my bailiwick. I can't say I'm impressed with Lenin, but I can't say he is the absolute boogeyman I was raised to believe. Evil is still evil though. Any system which fails to generate and maintain the decentralization of ownership of the means of production isn't socialism. It's not clear to me that even [[Saint Chomsky]]'s Anarcho-syndicalism is effective either. It's very hard to know how to centralize power safely, and it's hard to decentralize power efficiently; there are some moral obligations we owe to others which require the fitting mix of both (with decentrality at the base).
