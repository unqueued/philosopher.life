title: Russell's Paradox

* Set of all sets that do not contain themselves
* Consider a group of barbers who shave only those men who do not shave themselves.
* For set-builder notation, `x = {a: a is not in a}` leads to a contradiction.

Demonstrates a contradictions which arises from Frege's claim that one could freely use any property to define further properties. Russell attempts to solve this problem using a theory of //types//, a hierarchy of objects: numbers, sets of numbers, sets of sets of numbers, etc. 

Zermelo replaces the axiom:

`for every formula A(x) there is a set y = {x: A(x)}` with the axiom:

`for every formula A(x) and every set b there is a set y = {x: x is in b and A(x)}` thus Russell's paradox becomes: 

`let y = {x: x is not in x}, is y in y`
