title: 2019.10.15 - Wiki Audit: Workspaces

[[Sphygmus]] has made [[workspaces|2019.03.23 - Wiki Audit: Virtual Storyrivers]]. Noice! I'm still not sure how I want to use them, but I'm convinced there's a place for it. We were not able to generalize it, but I'm also not sure how necessary it will be. I still can't see far enough. 

Currently, they reside in [[Buttons]]. Importing what is currently in the storyriver and other kinds of advanced manipulation probably can't be handled by buttons nicely. TW5-Nav and Mentat also may have something to say still here.
