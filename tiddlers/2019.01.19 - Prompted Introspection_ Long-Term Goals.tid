title: 2019.01.19 - Prompted Introspection: Long-Term Goals

!! What is a long term goal and how can you achieve it?

That is an odd question. It is possible you meant "what is your" instead. I'll try to answer the question as is though. 

I suppose "long" is relative to an agent's particularized contextual standard. A goal is the telic end(s) of a maxim, be it for a hypothetical or categorical imperative calculation. You achieve your end through some set of means. The means are also part of the traditional maxim. Hypothetical imperatives are mere means to ends causal relationships for agents. You may have an infinite number of possible sufficient means to that end, and there may be some necessary conditions as well (I think there definitionally are at least some necessary conditions). That technically answers "how." But, I must caution that not all goals are intrinsically [[good]] or unconditionally [[right]]. There may be an infinite number of algorithm/means to that end, and [[The Categorical Imperative]] is the only computer that can explain which means would are morally obligated or permissible to whatever morally obligated or permissible ends exist in each context. 

Ah, I get all the delicious computational power and unpopularity of mixing anti-luck epistemology with contextualism and particularism in my exploration of how [[The Infinite]]'s normativity maps onto we [[fff]]. Rock on, homie.
