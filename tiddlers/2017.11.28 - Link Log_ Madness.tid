* Stunning!
** https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nice-brains-finish-last/
*** It points out the phenomenon and explanation pretty cleanly.
** https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/drms-dead-canary-how-we-just-lost-web-what-we-learned-it-and-what-we-need-do-next
*** =( - Do you see what they are saying? Algo's eat the world, algo's owned and oligopolized by psychopaths, and we are legally being eaten by psychopaths. Either stupid or truly evil libertarians are going with this.
** https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/ancient-virus-found-hibernating-in-the-human-genome-and-it-might-wake-up/
*** I wonder if that means we really are viruses, to some extent. Agent Smith prophecies...

* KYS
** https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/comcast-quietly-drops-promise-not-to-charge-tolls-for-internet-fast-lanes/
*** Just received a mail offer from our current ISP to drop from 50mbps@$45/month to 10mpbs@$45/month "for life." The language in the letter was disturbing. I am so very unhappy with the world I live in. They are going to hunt us into slavery-extinction, shaping the school of human fish until we are vulnerable, scared masses ripe for spearfishing. I feel trapped.

*** You people do not understand what is happening! Nuclear weapons have a MADDness to them, but Memetic Warfare (the fundamental risers in the Ladder of Chaos) is far more insidious, pervasive, and impossible to stop.

* Preach, yo!
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/04/where-millennials-come-from
*** I was fed similar lies. I'm done.
** http://nautil.us/issue/54/the-unspoken/why-females-decide-whats-beautiful
*** Redpill, get your redpill! Bracket your differentiationism just long enough to see the truth!
** http://billmoyers.com/story/need-confront-billionaires-paradise/
*** "The concentrated wealth of the global plutocracy is the dark matter of the world economy: It is rarely glimpsed and difficult to measure, yet it reshapes everything around it." Sick opener, yo.
*** I appreciate the Second Gilded Age name

* Confirm My Bias

** https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/how-to-be-better-at-worrying.html
*** I feel like my time writing on the wiki is scheduled anxiety time. Also, stoicism, yet again.

** https://melmagazine.com/a-conversation-with-chuck-palahniuk-the-author-of-fight-club-and-the-man-behind-tyler-durden-9098e9d031fa
*** Aye.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** http://think-liberty.com/2017/11/26/dont-support-net-neutrality/
*** An interesting take on portions of the argument. I think we have a disagreement on what counts as regulation. This libertarian is still missing (on purpose?) huge parts of the picture. His whataboutisms aren't right. I appreciate some of the holes he points out, although he does not dissuade me.
** https://stratechery.com/2017/why-ajit-pai-is-right/
*** A more interesting article than the previous. It's still wrong. I understand the worry of regulation, but it is even clearer to me that this should be public infrastructure, period.
** http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/abdullahi-yusuf-isis-syria.html
*** Do it for the rich usually, but this is a better statement.

* Think About It
** https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/11/27/565968260/within-the-context-of-all-contexts-the-rewiring-of-our-relationship-to-music
*** I have very strong feelings about different sections of this article.
** http://blog.samaltman.com/american-equity
*** Interesting, but does that actually work? I'm trying to see how it does.
** https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7fwjzk/cmv_propaganda_is_rampant_on_reddit_and_our/
*** Censorship is rarely the best answer. It's tricky to shape your filter-bubbles and respond appropriately.
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15796045
*** Not a boring discussion, at all.

*** High IQ Schizoids show something important about the spectrum, and it is not clear how the causal phenomenon cluster is conceptually bad for the human specimen. Low IQ's are far more common.
