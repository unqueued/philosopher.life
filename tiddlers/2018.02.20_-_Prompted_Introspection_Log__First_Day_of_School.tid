title: 2018.02.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: First Day of School

!! How do you feel on the first day of school?

Nervous, elated, and ready to dive in.

My donors failed to raise me to care about myself and instead to seek the approval of others, particularly through my intelligence (especially insofar as it boosted their social standing or made it appear as though they were decent human beings). I've always been a shark in academic work. I can't say I've always enjoyed the social aspects of it, but there were good times to be had. 

New teachers, new subjects, usually new classmates, and feeling like I've leveled up all stand out to me. I moved around a lot as a rootless child, so I often was entering a new school entirely. This was difficult for an autist.

School was a place to show off, which wasn't difficult given the shitty KY school systems and the students around me. I learned only incidentally. I never really learned to try hard, to value doing my best, to pursue a better version of myself each day. I think it was a giant fucking waste of talent on top of completely assbackwards conditioning.

How I felt on the first day of school, clearly, was different than how I feel about them now.
