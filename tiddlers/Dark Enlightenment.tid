title: Dark Enlightenment

Ugh, even my enemies merit my epistemic charity from time to time. These people gross me out. I hate who they are, and yet, I must admit they are often correct on crucially disturbing matters. I take what they say with mountain of salt, and yet, I still taste the truth in aspects of what they say. Thus, with great displeasure, I will start collecting a library of dark enlightenment thought. Perhaps I will respond to it in a pointed way sometime in the future. I don't know.
