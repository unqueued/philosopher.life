title: 2018.06.25 - Legacy Spells: LS it is!

<<<
Hello h0p3,

Thank you for your considerate first reply. I'll answer as much as I can right away, although longer delays are likely in the future. I don't mind if it takes days or weeks between messages; building a wiki feels like an unusually timeless project.

I haven't played Magic: The Gathering, although some childhood friends with whom I played Pokémon TCG did play MTG too. :) I liked Legacy Spells as a pseudonym for a protonmail because it reminds me of the perspective that if we leave something useful for future generations, it will probably consist largely of words, concepts, code––solutions to problems, "spells"––that they'll be able to use without having to (completely) understand their origins. I want to live for improving solutions and passing them on. I am thankful for the tools (especially cognitive tools like languages) that have shaped my development. We can give future beings even better tools.

You may continue responding in your wiki like you did. I understand that what I write might be correlated to what I'd later publish as a wiki. Complete anonymity feels like a lot of work, and pseudonymity like something that can't be really trusted to separate identities anyway. I found your wiki through a comment in r/slatestarcodex's "What would you consider essential general knowledge?". I believe your URL of philosopher.life signals (at least) curiosity, appreciation of wisdom, and being an early adopter (and probably a technical/rigorous person) of some kind. (How long have we had the opportunity to use .life?)

If you don't mind elaborating, it'd be interesting to hear what do you consider as risks in sharing a wiki, and/or has it had any negative consequences for you. Personally, I might keep it as a log of my media experiences, favorite quotes, and ever-evolving mind-map of solutions and problems ("solution-mapping") on all scales. Of course, integrating those with one's own life events and idiosyncratic problems would probably be liberating, and it'd be a shame to exclude that intersection from the shared wiki in case some readers would be interested. I agree that for the purposes of self-understanding and connecting with others, the journaling parts are probably the primary content. I hope to achieve a good balance of universalist and idiosyncratic content so as to be simultaneously useful and better connected to others. In a way, I aim to translate my life history/situation/goals/projects into the universalist language of problem–solution mapping while describing a map larger than my life, containing not only my chosen paths and focus areas but also ways for others to see themselves within the same larger whole.

Identities, stories/narratives, alienation, and connection are important topics that we can certainly discuss in time. One thing I want to say right now, is that wikis (presently TiddlyWiki) are amazing for condensing lots of the constituents of one's identity (or identifications) into a form where a ton of commonalities/similarities might jump at once at the reader. I wonder if these kind of identity constructions will transform Getting to Know Each Other once they can be part of virtual/augmented/mixed realities.

Re: verification, the nature of TW seems to be that it'd be trivially easy for someone to make a slightly edited version and pass it on (for whatever reasons) as a version that the recipients might believe to be just as authentic. There might be only really improbable reasons why anyone would want to do so, but it'd give me peace of mind to allow both that everything can be downloaded & read offline forever and that the newest version can always be verified to be the one I am putting forward.

I encountered your wiki on mobile (on which it wasn't so easy to use when any Tiddler would just fill the screen), so I went to the place where I knew TW shows the alphabetical list of all Tiddlers. The year 2022 (in "By 2022") caught my eye as a way to quickly see what your five-year plan might be. Future years are something I often reflect on as well, wondering how smartphones took the world by storm within a decade and what the next decades might bring. (What nonlinear developments do people anticipate in their 5–10 year plans?)

Okay, I'll read {Focus} once I return on desktop to see what are my general first impressions of your wiki (in due time). Right now, I must say it was difficult to browse on mobile, which is a problem I'm anticipating with my own TiddlyWiki as well. Have you tried different fonts or why do you prefer to have it look like console? I understand the aesthetics, but is it best for the eyes? Anyway, I'll find later the patience to take my eyes off my own wiki to explore yours again. One reason I'll likely return to yours is to see what technical decisions you have found useful in maintaining a TiddlyWiki. And if it's not obvious from some page/Tiddler, can you explicate if the wiki has many parts (e.g., journal + media logs + poems + many non-chronological posts that you keep updating from time to time + ...)? In other words, what are the intertwined areas if you were to decide on taking the wiki apart and housing them in separate places? Perhaps breaking apart a wiki is impossible after a while, but mine seems to grow from combining years of separate logs in order to get them under a common interface and tagging system for moving between items, where the desired emergent property is a brainlike navigability so to speak (+ an awareness of interconnections).

One initial difference between our wikis (after my superficial first visitation) seems to be that I've made heavier use of interconnecting my Tiddlers by tagging them with each other as tag pills. I am essentially lifelogging all books, audiobooks, podcasts, documentaries, movies, series, games, etc. (including possible tables of contents) that I've experienced (unless completely irrelevant) as Tiddlers, and tagging them by topics and by possible solutions that they might contribute to. Solution Tiddlers are also interconnected so that visiting a solution will automatically show a list of things (including other solutions) that contribute to the solution being viewed, and logically its tags will be those solutions that it might in turn contribute to. Similarly, the topic tag (i.e., Tiddler) "physics" contains automatic lists of physics books, physics documentaries, etc., as well as the umbrella tag "topics" which you can click to jump to any other topic to see the automatic lists of that. I'll also tag quotes with their sources and most relevant topics (and maybe possible solutions that the quote might relate to). So in a sense this wiki is a hierarchical web of my sources/influences and of solutions that I deem worthy of interconnecting with each other, forming a map of what to do (or pay attention to) when wanting to implement a particular solution. Without the tag hierarchies it would fall apart, but with the tag hierarchies, it feels finally like the non-chronological, brainlike solution map that I've always wanted my logs/notes/writings to result in. Additionally (and this is how it began), the wiki keeps me accountable in what reading/media I spend my time on, as most or all of it would be public, as well as functioning as a two-way recommendation device of showing others what I've paid attention to (with perhaps ratings & reviews in time) and asking for others to point out my blind spots or what might balance my Insert Detrimentally Monomaniacal Focus in Some Area of Thought. Core features of everything should be rationalist Bayesian openness & commitment to updating our epistemology, and non-violent communication & feedback so we can help each other solve all problems. It is of course a welcome side-effect if publishing and maintaining a wiki would also lead to interesting unforeseen communication/connections between people. Still, I think of the solution mapping as the point.

Re: feedback, I love the geometric interpretation in your
> [Good feedback] seems to require someone understanding your position and goals from an angle you do not.
That does sound like a common problem, especially when doing something uncommon. Admittedly building a wiki can be a solitary business at times when any sane person would look at the bell curves for weather and go enjoy the sun. :-) Introspective feedback loops do indeed make a lot of weird-seeming things worthwhile in the long run.

Re: "What are your thoughts on anonymity and privacy as moral, political, and technical concepts?", easier asked than answered, I'll skip that one for now!

Have you had inspirations directly affecting your wiki or deciding to build one? For me, I've been inspired at least by the websites or ideas of Aaron Swartz, Edge.org, Gwern, Kevin Kelly, and the Long Now Foundation. From science fiction, some important descriptions have been the Truth Mines and "polis libraries" in Greg Egan's Diaspora; I'd love for my wiki to eventually be spatially visualizable in a virtual reality environment so that one could go there for a data dive.

Phew. I never really wrote letters by hand, but it feels like I just did. Feel free to take your time. I'll return to your wiki in some time.

Happy wikiing(?)!

–LS
