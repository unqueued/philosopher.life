To be a professional organizer of delusions, you need to focus on delusions that it would actually benefit you to believe, at least temporarily, and then figure out how to adopt them for just as long as they can serve you.
<<<

Self-delusion is tricky. I suppose this is where the psychopath learns to turn off his self-empathy, or parts of it. This is where prudential and alethic reasoning peel apart so conveniently.

Sounds like my donors.

<<<
Your overall goal is to create plausible deniability, even within your own mind, to defend against the accusation that you don’t believe something that you are pitching to others. Your lifeline back to reality is your capacity for doubt, which prevents plausible deniability from turning into a pattern of denial that persists long after the expiry date on the delusion.

It is much easier to do this if you discipline yourself to only work with delusions that are a sufficiently complex mix of metaphysics, morality arguments, metaphor, narrative and facts.

This is why you get the most fundamental axiom in delusion organization theory: the bigger the lie, the easier it is to sell, and the biggest ones, bigger than even the civilization-scale ones, are the ones you deliberately sell to yourself.
<<<

Jesus. 

It's breathtaking. I don't think I can twist myself into that. I think I'm just too fucking honest with myself to pull it off. Or, I need the motherload, a titanic doozy of a self-delusion that would be hard to even conceive of.<<ref "2019.03.23">>

I suppose the paranoid critique of my work in this wiki is that I'm engaged in this precise behavior. I don't know what to say other than: I take myself to be pursuing the truth, and I have a long-term pattern of that behavior. I think my motivations are fairly crystallized in this respect.

Self-deception contradictions arise over the past 20 pages. Further, Rao seems to contradict himself about the nature of deception scaling, unless he sees a difference between "big" and "complex." I'm not sure what the difference really is. 

More importantly, boys and girls, Strauss cries out. Do you hear him? Be literal here, and you will see that the author has no problem contradicting himself, and he even says it. This is the source of real power: lying to yourself. 

If you can treat yourself as mere means, it will make you more effective at treating others as mere means.

This is part of the problem with compatibilist deep-self approaches to identity and autonomy: you really do treat yourself-in-the-moment as a means to happiness of yourself-persistent-identity to some significant extent. Until fundamental problems in metaphysics can be resolved, we have a very unstable foundation for metaethics (of which epistemology is but a subset).

All there is, is "what is" and the hope of the possibility of "what ought."

To win the Yossarian belt, you have to genuinely graduate to ironic absurdity, and traffic in delusions without getting attached to them. Without a sense of absurdity, you’ll just fall off the slightly evil path and turn into yet another greedy hack, peddling subprime mortgages.
<<<

Ah, there you go. The Surd-Elim of your argument. Traffic in Surds and you can Surd-Elim whatever you want. Relativity packaged nicely. His claim, in a sense, is to develop iterators that we sip off conclusions (whatever we need in the moment) from the tit of absurdity we've established from poor philosophical foundations.

If you aren't alethic at the bottom, then what do you have? You have the prudential, right? At, it is prudent, to only some extent, to be alethic. The happiest person is one who has wielded their intelligence to be alethic in only the right places, to delude themselves.

Why do you think you have escaped being merely a greedy hack again, Rao? Oh, this is a tremendously beautiful argument. It's a trainer to get you over the hump, to start the engine, but looking inside it, it falls apart. 

I must think more about this Yossarian Belt pursuit.

<<<
An interpersonal interaction is open if both parties are seeking to trade or discover information. It is closed if even one party is seeking status validation, conflict or harmony instead.
<<<

Listen to this prophet. He's correct. When it isn't open, then it is closed via a stance based on a mix of status validation + conflict/harmony:

<<<
* Condescension: I am better than you and for you
* Contempt: I am better than you and against you
* Supplication: I am worse than you and for you
* Insolence: I am worse than you and against you
<<<

Sounds about right.

<<<
Wherever possible, you should attempt to move the conversation to an open one that is about generating or exchanging information, or disengage if that turns out to be impossible.
<<<

Don't waste your time. Got it.

<<<
The key to conflict without ego is the observation that you cannot get mad at facts.
<<<

Admittedly, I get mad at those who cause those facts to obtain in the world.

<<<
the key is to acknowledge and bracket emotions and consciously let them go.
<<<

Easier said than done.

<<<
Violence is a necessary consequence of unavoidable ignorance on the part of systems that lack infinite wisdom. You cannot avoid it, or enlighten yourself out of it.
<<<

Lol. Someone has read Foundation with a practical eye; it's not like we have psychohistory.

<<<
The ideas of your friends are not always the friends of your ideas.
<<<

? Duh?
