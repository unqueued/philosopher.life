title: 2017.05.11 - Pipefitting Log

Today was a peculiar and unproductive day. 

Everyone was sent to the computer lab except Mel, Chris, and me. Mel wandered off to "study" for the test he has failed multiple times (which is really just a way for him to try and memorize the questions on the test, as he admits). Chris and I finished the alignment on the simulator, and I made the tacks. The overhead tacks sucked. But the 1G looked super clean for me (I was actually proud of them). I cleaned them up, and that was that. 

Randy came over to deliver a hand-drawn forklift to my teacher. He asked about the books since he now needs to read them for his own class. I'll be bringing them to him next week.

The teacher can't find the right mounting hardware (and can't afford any more), so it is just sitting there. We'll see when we'll actually get to put it up.

The teacher then told us to go study. Fine with me. I read through the buttweld chapter, which is easily the longest we've ever had. There is much to cover. Several times I wished we had covered this content before we even began our buttweld project itself. That's okay though. 

Mel couldn't stop talking. He's an idiot. I've stopped taking him seriously. I listen to him, but with the appropriate lens now. 

We had another tour of school children paraded past us. Chris said it made him uncomfortable like he was a spectacle in a zoo. Essentially, he felt objectified. We talked about advertisements in schooling in this area, including public school buses and our own school (which has Trane and Snap-on shit everywhere). It was a long conversation about the function and nature of the school. Chris has his head on straight often enough. Poor guy.

We eventually got into politics. Chris is very levelheaded for lacking formal education. He understands the evil of humanity well enough though. I like that honesty in him. Mel, of course, was retarded. I think these people don't study political science, philosophy, or even follow the news because they don't believe it can really benefit them in the end. There is a kind of pragmatic rationality, in a sense, to sacrificing their citizenship. They could be right, but I think there is a deep moral flaw (failing to practice the golden rule) in their reasoning nonetheless. 

The teacher grabbed me from the classroom to help him with his computer. He wanted to download a Youtube video. I found a site for him, ripped it, and copied it to his "zip" (USB) drive. He had another file he wanted to copy to the USB drive but didn't know how. I showed him. His computer illiteracy is shocking.

He hinted that what I was putting on the flash drive would be material we would later cover for the class. It was about the dangers of dropping tools. Seems dumb, but hopefully it will scare me straight into wearing a hardhat. Ultimately, I want a welderhood+hardhat+noise_reducer all-in-one.

I also asked if I could borrow a dolly since he was obviously in a decent mood to follow through on quid pro quo. He said yes, and went to a step further to say that the HVAC guys had an actual appliance dolly. He went with me to ask to borrow it (using his social capital on my behalf). They said yes. So, now I have the right tool for the job. Tomorrow, hopefully, we get to use it.

I went back to studying. Eventually, the teacher came in and pulled Chris and me out of the classroom to work on a 4-on-6 concentric support for buttweld black carbon steel pipe. We've never done this before. It was obvious he wanted to give us "something" to do. That's fine because we really needed something to do.

From what I've gathered, he has told the other guys individually that they will not be able to keep up with Chris and I. I'm thinking this quietly offended them (although, they would not admit it). It is just a fact though. They actively avoid doing practice/labor, and it makes it all the more frustrating when we have to work with them because they lack the basics to even be helpful. Furthermore, they avoid work by "studying" for tests. But, they are failing those tests. Eh, whatever. That is their choice. 

Chris and I worked on the 4-on-6. We had to think about it for a bit since it has been a while since we've used the pipe fabricator's book (the dark blue one). It was fast enough though. We found the pieces (took some hunting to find a standard 4" pipe, since we didn't want extra thick walls to grind). I marked the 4, and then I went to figure out how to mark the 6 while Chris cut. 

The teacher came by as he saw me thinking about the 6" pipe marks. I explained why I wanted to mark. He gave me a quizzical look. He is not convinced that I need anything more than the vertical line along the heel (if you were standing the fitting upon an outlet). I was struggling to draw this line. I gave him one idea since I had found a way to mark the center point alongside the very side of the pipe (same perspective), I could just measure 1/4" the way around the pipe's circumference. He felt that was more work than necessary. Instead, I used a square and just marked half the OD. The book and pipe didn't match up on the OD, so he told me to use the book (odd, imho). Remember, this is concentric, which means center to center. I think I need to draw that center line too. We could just level off the top of the support to get it "close." That's probably what we'll end up doing. If I was working with a larger pipe, or if I had to make it perfect, I think it would be important to find this center line. Matching the 4" support against 4 points gives us a precision that 2 points simply can't (3 is really the minimum to triangulate). 

We'll probably finish it later.

Overall, it felt very unproductive. That's okay though. We hit it really hard yesterday. Maybe I should learn to enjoy slower days and not feel like I'm wasting my time. Sometimes I have too much, viciously, of that Go-go-go in me.
