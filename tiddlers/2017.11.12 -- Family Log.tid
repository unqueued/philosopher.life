!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** I think it's cool that you are trying to figure out how to use your computer in general more.
** You worked very hard on math this week. I think you were pushed the hardest, and you stood up to the challenge. I'm proud of you, and I hope you are proud of yourself too.
** I have noticed you have been taking criticism better. e.g. When I say you haven't washed your hair well enough, you were like: "okay, thank you." I'm grateful for it.
** You've been handling your emotional stress very well, not being self-destructive.
* j3d1h
** Your paradox collection is outstanding. I hope you see it as a long-term project that you cultivate. You add to it bit by bit, you reorganize it from time to time, and it will snowball into this tool for yourself.
** Thank you for helping me come up with an idea of edible books festival and committing to working with me on it.
** In substitution for a compliment, I offer an apology: 
*** I'm sorry for being annoying and making you mad enough that we get in trouble. I feel like I get you in trouble sometimes when you otherwise wouldn't have.
* k0sh3k
** Thank you for teaching me how to wash my hair correctly.
** Thank you for someone that I can speak to without hesitation or fear, and for using that to our mutual advantage.
** Thank you for being willing to try to fix your own boots and coat.
* h0p3
** Thank you for tutoring us in algebra.
** Thank you for making space in the day for us to play outside.
** I'm glad to see your shift in your audience and wrestling in your wiki. You are more introspective and less aggressive about it.
