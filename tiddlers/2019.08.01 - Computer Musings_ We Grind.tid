title: 2019.08.01 - Computer Musings: We Grind

My son is hating Windows for this work; he's missing his linux environment. Good! Working on setting things up remotely. I will make an amateur system admin of him yet (and he will be wildy more prepared than I ever was). Currently, he's using his FTP client, PuTTy, and my wiki to piece together Conky and i3status bar for me with synced symbolic links on [[monster-16]]. He is stressed, but he's doing a good job. I'm proud of his attitude and hard work; this is going to go much easier for him when it comes time to do his own.

It is so much faster and lower stress if I do it all, but I need him to practice. There's no way around it. I'm glad he's done this before on his Manjaro system to some extent.

Rebob problems. Fuck it. We'll revamp [[Firmcoding]] entirely. Also found out that acculists only have a single date! No.

---

The wikis have made a complete migration. [[j3d1h]] has tested the toolchain. We should be in good shape. Also, the network synced Bob trick works. Soon we'll be doing the meta/txt split for dotfiles. =) I am excited.

I turned [[m10]] off. I had a moment of silence as I unplugged my peripherals from her last night. Pulled out the SSD, seated another HDD in place (velcro mounting is hawt ;P). [[1uxb0x]] setup poweriso, grabbed the Win8.1 iso, and started making the bootable. I installed the SSD in [[monster-17]], and I'm onto setting up Arch on it. Hopefully, I can get my son over the hump here.

Fucking forgot to force UEFI rather than taking both. No way to get grub on it otherwise.

Running into keying problems.
