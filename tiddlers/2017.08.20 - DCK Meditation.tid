We all are expressions of Evolution. Many times I have tried to define Philosophy and Economics (among other disciplines). I fail tremendously. I feel like I can give shape to them sometimes, but they usually topple over. 

Every computable bit of our lives, every detail, interaction, tendril, and emergence is an expression of evolution. Evolution is physics, economics, computer science, and mathematics playing out as it were. This is obvious, and yet hard to comprehend or realize in a sense. The inferential trees we must make are tremendous to understand the physical world around us.

Good men are more stable than I am. It's not about right and wrong (and I need not feel ashamed). It's just a eudaimonic fact. Essentially, to flourish, one must partake of the good. 

I think a lot of people do not distinguish The Right from The Good. I don't know how to draw the lines either, sadly. I have studied it for a very long time. I do not know the answer. I will try again anyway because I am a philosopher.

The Good is Right in a Vacuum. The Right is Good in Context. Solved. Lol.

How useless that appears! There is a dialectic here of some sort. I don't know among whom or what. I do not understand the nature of the struggle and concept itself. The show must go on!

My parents have claimed to stop being a part of our lives in a letter to my brother. But, they also just called us. I need to set it aside. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. My goal is not to hurt them. But, to also not to be hurt by them. My father said he is passed the point of "being hurt." Agreed. I wish you the best of luck. I hope you will be happy. I love you, from afar. I extend the Tribal Olive Branch of Peace. I'm still there if you need me, but let us limit our interactions, please. I hope our narratives do not need to entwine again unless it is happy for us all.

Note, of course, dear reader, that you get to hear what I think or say, and I don't have the luxury of hearing what you think or say. That asymmetry in our power dynamic is morally salient.

I often find that silence is the best social approach to a wide variety of contexts.

* It's the best way to deal with dark-triads in many cases
* It covers up my ignorance or inability.
* It prevents me from saying something I would regret.
* It gives me time to formulate exactly what I want to say. 

My son needs to know this, as does my daughter. This is a crucial skill. I know that Silence is scary, but sometimes Silence is Right (even if isn't pleasant or Good).

I am always surprised there doesn't seem to be a stronger etymological link between "God" and "Good" considering how much they have in common conceptually.

I think being autistic makes me a really bad parent in a ton of ways (do the best you can, bro). That's not my fault (I'm sure that will stick a quarter in many people's intuitions). Yeah, my kids are fed, clothed, and safe. They have lots of toys, tools, and methods to learn about and engage the world. It isn't about tittilating them, but it is about finding a way to help them achieve eudaimonia (or rather, it ideally is about chemical reactions/tittilations that maximize the odds of reaching eudaimonia). I'm not sure how to do that (in part because I really don't know how to do that myself, cliche, ikr).

---

It seems to me that my [[Prompted Introspection Log]] and [[DCK Meditations]] have a hell of a lot in common. It's a place to digest. 

---

I notice that I find tons of bad things in people, and I gloss over the good things in them. I expect them to be go.

[[Neurotribal Empathy Spectrum: Dark Triads, Autists, & Neurotypicals]]

Now there is a fucking book title. I know it is unfashionable to say "Autist," and I'm sorry. 

---

Paying people back shows that I respect their time and effort, their risk-taking trust, and it enables us to tit-for-tat into game theoretically stronger relationships. I want to build those relationships. Of course, the egoist says, "with whom?" 

Everyone says, "Family," forever. 

I agree, but I want to point out that the very word "family" requires conceptual analysis. The Infamous Relativism Slip pokes its head out here. It's too easy to shape our definitions of //Family// or Tribes to be whatever we want. Constantly seek and apply the best principles you can. What else can you do besides the Stoic approach? 

---

I despise going into social contexts because I can't understand them. My rTPJ does not fire in the patterned way that others' do, and that means I'm kind of stuck on the outskirts. The outskirts are a dangerous place, no doubt. One must be wise and not very trusting, unfortunately, in such a world.

---

I think I spend more time asking how the universe is and how it ought to be than the average person. I study that a lot.

---

It's time to start otherizing. You mean there is right and wrong, yeah? You have value, yeah? You have dignity, and self-worth, yeah? 

Does this sound like either some Nazi or Kantian bullshit to you? Don't see you the memetic evolution that occurred in Germany? 

---

I think there is a memetic trend in Present Day Humanity to squelch socialism. I feel the outskirts. I see it. I think mass delusions are real. I think it is completely possible that Humanity is deeply wrong about what it thinks. 

Hilariously, I think my professors would find this philosophical issue not worth talking or thinking about. Why? I'm sure it seems conspiratorial to you. I think it is a systemic (not systematic!) expression of

I love that I am a lost thought sometimes. Othertimes, it makes me sad. Othertimes, I am indifferent to it. Stoicism.

My wife is the best person I know in the world. I see her sacrifice so much for her family. It's not just her time, effort, and stress. The existential stress she deals with is profound. She is mighty, courageous, and

I really enjoyed our Family Conversation at the Indian Restaurant. Those are the memories I want to preserve. I actually want to dress up for that. The insanity of Magnanimity in Aristotle's Virtue Theory is exactly what I'm almost seems related to it. There is a redpilled happiness there. I want to create tons and tons of those moments. Moments that feel special and interesting. I have goals! That isn't just for my kids either, that is for all of us. I don't just live for my kids. We can be happy together. Let's work on it, toward it, build it, cultivate it, etc.

---

Power dynamics will be abused and exploited when a society doesn't offer significant safety nets, opportunity trees, and paths to existential success for its various members, particularly the disenfranchised.

---

I am reminded of my openness and stress in writing my philosophy papers (they took a lot out of me, they were stressful [remember that one student who said she smokes cigarettes instead of vapes for papers, she felt the existential pull too]).

---

My brother doesn't want to read my Prompted Introspections because it takes too much work to empathize with me. That doesn't mean he doesn't want to empathize with me, but it really does take too much work. There simply has to be a point where you can't expect others to empathize with you because it is logistically and emotionally infeasible. You are incredibly lucky to have a genius wife that takes the time to empathize and interpret you.

---

I've decided that I would (secretly?) love for my children to want to learn philosophy. I think I could give them far more guidance about how to approach it now. I'd spend my body for that. Would they want to do it well though? Would they really be curious and integrated enough to do it?

---

If my father had really intended for us to go into the trades, he would have actually sat down and trained us. He would have taught us. He would have had us practice. He would have at least pushed us, planned for it, helped us, motivated us, pleaded with us, tooled us up. Do not accept his false narrative. He was too "busy" with his fucked up way of practicing Christianity to actually be a good father. Conceptually speaking, Christians don't have to be like my father (even if empirically most of them are like that or worse); my wife is a fine example.

---

Now that I "know" my parents aren't reading, I feel like there is more slack in my ability to write in this wiki. I feel triumphant too. This is a proof that I am neither existentially nor ethically failing. I really am doing my best. Who else would take the time to do this?

---

I love doing philosophy without limits or social expectations. I love thinking because it is an end in itself. Yo, Aristotle, homie! I love pursuing the truth.

--- 

I've decided we will read the wiki from Sabbath to Sabbath to tie it in better. The narrative embeds and connects more fluidly that way. That overlap primes us, helps us remember where we are in the story.
