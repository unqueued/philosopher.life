Self-control is the chief element in self-respect, and self-respect is the chief element in courage.

Perfectionism is the unparalleled defense for emotionally abandoned children. The existential unattainability of perfection saves the child from giving up, unless or until, scant success forces him to retreat into the depression of a dissociative disorder, or launches him hyperactively into an incipient conduct disorder. Perfectionism also provides a sense of meaning and direction for the powerless and unsupported child. In the guise of self-control, striving to be perfect offers a simulacrum of a sense of control. Self-control is also safer to pursue because abandoning parents typically reserve their severest punishment for children who are vocal about their negligence.

A child that’s being abused by its parents doesn’t stop loving its parents, it stops loving itself.

People who have survived atrocities often tell their stories in a highly emotional, contradictory and fragmented manner.

This is simply a listing of all the logs currently and previously employed on this wiki. It's nice to have a single place to look at them. In a sense, it is a testament to the evolution of {[[Focus|Current Focus of h0p3's Wiki]]}. 

I believe that focusing on Logs that actually do something, are domains over which I have a power to change things, i.e. that are pragmatic and stoic, should be kept running. 

Here, I am convinced that Logs have been the driving force and primary shape-giving tool I've given to this wiki in many months. I can quantify my humanity here, analyze it, and synthesize myself. Also, it is evidence for accountability. You get to be honest with yourself in a very direct and obvious way. Programming yourself is not easy, but it works.

<<footnotes "1" "Originally going with 'You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.' from Marcus Aurelius, Meditations. Unfortunately, I think the semantics of this quote may not be entirely correct. The spirit of it, however, is. With a single word, I can agree to the following aphorism. I haven't found a better one.">>
