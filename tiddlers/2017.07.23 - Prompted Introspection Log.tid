!! Why are the friends you are making now and days, William and Jaye, black? Why don't you get along with whitey, yo?

I'd say because I'm mostly around black people. I don't spend time with white people that much. But, also, I feel like an outcast, and I just seem to get along better with them. If I'm going to be an alien, might as well be an alien with others who have been alienated as well.

It's interesting to see William and Jaye at their stages in life given just how intelligent they can be. They see it too. I like being with them. I don't feel like a devil or weirdo in a bad way with them. I get to be myself around them, at least to a large extent.
