*What happened last week?
** 1uxb0x
*** Didn't do his homework. He's planning how to hold himself accountable (and to prove to his sister that he is working).
** j3d1h
*** Frustrated by the fact that she couldn't get VirtualBox to work (although Vmware worked), even though nothing seemed wrong otherwise. 
*** Pleased to finish her journal and format it. 
** k0sh3k
*** She prepared her Lenten study over the week. No procrastination was nice.
** h0p3
*** Made a lot of progress towards getting into the Union. We have good options, which pleases me.

* How are we feeling? (health, emotional, etc.)
** 1uxb0x
*** Sad and happy. Feeling healthy though.
** j3d1h
*** Happy. Got a lot accomplished. Healthwise: pretty damn good.
** k0sh3k
*** Feels really run down this week. Period. Came fast this time, but hit hard. The vitamins have been much easier on her stomach.
** h0p3
*** I've had that fizzy feeling that I had after coming off my SSRI's. I've a drink each day this week, but I had no cannabliss either. I haven't been drunk. I slept quite a bit as well. I skipped DCK this week, and that was probably a mistake according to j3d1h. The lack of Cannabliss didn't seem to affect my affect.

* Are you happy? Why or why not?
** 1uxb0x
*** Feeling happy because he has plans for his future. He feels sad about the past week. It's a new week.
** j3d1h
*** Happy because she came up with some cool ideas for projects/presents (has to keep them secret). 
** k0sh3k
*** Indifferent to sleepy. First headache in a while. But, this is to be expected on her period. The weather has been insane this week as well.
** h0p3
*** I've felt really angry and cynical this week.

* In what ways did we successfully empathize with ourselves and others this week?
** 1uxb0x
*** Planning for his future this week. Figuring out how he's going to get his work done. He also cleaned his room and did the kitchen quickly.
** j3d1h
*** Making muffins for the family. 
** k0sh3k
*** Planning our long-term future, finances.
** h0p3
*** Planning our long-term future, finances.

* In what ways did we fail to empathize with ourselves and others this week?

*** Not doing the kitchen quickly.
** k0sh3k

* What will we do this week?

** j3d1h

** k0sh3k
