title: 2018.03.29 - Computer Musings: Obfuscation

I'm tweaking my web traffic obfuscation/pollution. I actually don't mind that it downloads. I've turned off using my old bookmarks. I've set a cronjob to wipe out whatever is downloaded. I'm trying to introduce more aggregators from larger scopes of the political spectrum.
