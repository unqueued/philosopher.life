title: 2018.08.26 - Legacy Spells: Future

Dear Legacy Spells,

It feels like forever since I last {[[Contact]]}ed to you. I have not forgotten you! I have thought about you many times since your reply, and I appreciate your giving me license (and even preference, imho) to hold off on responding. My [[Find The Others]] project grew in virtue of you and a few others corresponding with me. I'm glad to have that project grow, and I want to thank you for taking the time to reach out to me.

<<<
Hello h0p3,

Thank you for your considerate first reply. I'll answer as much as I can right away, although longer delays are likely in the future. I don't mind if it takes days or weeks between messages; building a wiki feels like an unusually timeless project.
<<<

Delays are fine, and I hope it is a timeless project too. I'm still learning about others who have engaged in similar processes. It's a bit of a wild west, imho. I can't see far enough into the future of what this wiki will become, and that's in part because I can barely see what it is right now. Hopefully, we may be in a position to penpal about our practices for a long time to come.

<<<
I haven't played Magic: The Gathering, although some childhood friends with whom I played Pokémon TCG did play MTG too. :)
<<<

I played Pokémon TCG as well. It was what led me to MTG. I actually thought it was stupid the first time I saw it as a young kid. It took me a while to appreciate the kinds of stories we could tell ourselves and each other with cards (or tiddlers). What other kinds of games did you enjoy, and what do you like to play now?

<<<
I liked Legacy Spells as a pseudonym for a protonmail because it reminds me of the perspective that if we leave something useful for future generations, it will probably consist largely of words, concepts, code––solutions to problems, "spells"––that they'll be able to use without having to (completely) understand their origins. I want to live for improving solutions and passing them on. I am thankful for the tools (especially cognitive tools like languages) that have shaped my development. We can give future beings even better tools.
<<<

That is a noble name indeed! I think a wiki is an excellent tool for such a thing too. What problems are you trying to solve? Do you have any other uncommon tools that stand out to you like the wiki? I'm always on the hunt for tools.

You are the second person I've met who has talked about this kind of work as //spellcasting//. It is portable magic which affects our lives in ways which aren't always easy to describe or discern. I changed my {[[About]]} directory/page<<ref "dp">> in light of your claim.

I think your phrase "future beings" has an interesting connotation. Perhaps it's crazy, but I write to posthumans, AI, and even metaphysics itself (e.g. [[Aispondence]] and post-quote intro to //About://{[[About]]}). 

<<<
You may continue responding in your wiki like you did. I understand that what I write might be correlated to what I'd later publish as a wiki. Complete anonymity feels like a lot of work, and pseudonymity like something that can't be really trusted to separate identities anyway.
<<<

Cool. Since our last letter, I've found it increasingly useful to correspond through my wiki. I've referred to these conversations as [[Hyperconversations|2018.08.23 - kickscondor: Hyperconversations]]. I think there's something to it. I'll be interested to see the wiki you publish, if and when you do. Perhaps one day I'll converse with you over your wiki(s) as well. 

Also, Tiddlywiki federation is something that is still in development. It may have some interesting properties.

I too have strong doubts about the possibility of long-term complete anonymity. To my eyes, you have secured anonymity to some [[dok]]. I think the goal is to throw a roadblock up in front of surface trolls, simple bots, etc. I prefer not to be low-hanging fruit, but I'm obligated to make myself vulnerable. If you want to win against powerful or persistent adversaries, you don't get to be yourself. I believe steganography and security through obscurity are not worthless either, even though that is a fairly unpopular opinion.

<<<
I found your wiki through a comment in r/slatestarcodex's "What would you consider essential general knowledge?". I believe your URL of philosopher.life signals (at least) curiosity, appreciation of wisdom, and being an early adopter (and probably a technical/rigorous person) of some kind. (How long have we had the opportunity to use .life?)
<<<

I stopped posting that information on SSC by request of the mods. I am always surprised that we don't really get to link to ourselves elsewhere on the web. The web and internet continue to shift us away from such behavior. I prefer to live in my own silo, own my data, etc.

The .life gTLD has been available for ~4 years.

<<<
If you don't mind elaborating, it'd be interesting to hear what do you consider as risks in sharing a wiki, and/or has it had any negative consequences for you. 
<<<

The negative effects of my wiki haven't been too awful. I've been forced to wrestle with myself in public, and that can feel humiliating. The social dynamics with the wiki have a lot of variance both on and offline. Plenty of people dislike it or think it's insane. The wiki can be disorienting for people who don't study it. My pursuit of transparency can be especially jarring to people. I've not run into any significant problems just yet (but that doesn't mean I won't). Overall, these have been worthy prices to pay so far. I only get one life. I'm trying not to hide in the shadows to the point that I can't actually be myself in the world.<<ref "a">>

I assume powerful adversaries pose a non-trivial threat to me (and to some degree my family). I'm a political extremist (e.g. [[The Original Position]] and [[Socialism]]), so that could end poorly for us.<<ref "td">> It would probably be a bad thing for the majority of humans to be aware of this wiki; I think I'd be the victim of a witch-hunt or something like it. If and when the wiki can be automatically parsed and analyzed, it would be a highly exploitable treasure trove for profile builders, thought-police, etc. I'm practically handing them the keys to my kingdom. Systematically lacking privacy is a double-edged sword. I am open to the possibility that writing this wiki will cost me my life.

Of course, there are always going to be dangers in the information asymmetry of my interactions with others. They will have an opportunity to know who I am to a [[dok]] that I cannot know them. That information can be used against me in a variety of ways. I believe the vulnerability of transparently building myself in public is a risk worth taking; I don't think there's another way to viably provide evidence to myself of my moral integrity besides openly constructing my self-representation.

<<<
Personally, I might keep it as a log of my media experiences, favorite quotes, and ever-evolving mind-map of solutions and problems ("solution-mapping") on all scales.
<<<

I use it for that too: [[Art]], [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]], [[Deep Reading]], [[Music]], [[Link Log]], etc. The solutions and problems mapping is way fuzzier for me, but I think that's where the non-linearity and profound flexibility of Tiddlywiki shines the most. 

<<<
Of course, integrating those with one's own life events and idiosyncratic problems would probably be liberating, and it'd be a shame to exclude that intersection from the shared wiki in case some readers would be interested. I agree that for the purposes of self-understanding and connecting with others, the journaling parts are probably the primary content. I hope to achieve a good balance of universalist and idiosyncratic content so as to be simultaneously useful and better connected to others. In a way, I aim to translate my life history/situation/goals/projects into the universalist language of problem–solution mapping while describing a map larger than my life, containing not only my chosen paths and focus areas but also ways for others to see themselves within the same larger whole.
<<<

The local idiosyncratic vs. global universalist issue is something I've been wrestling with for quite a while on a number of fronts (also, Linear Logic appears valuable in this space). I'll be interested to see what you come up with. Ultimately, I frontload a lot of idiosyncratic work in my top level directories on [[Root]], but I don't think self-exploration is going to effectively work without me doing so. Even when I'm as clear as I can be, I don't think I share enough in common with people to make it simple; this could easily just be a radical fault of mine though. I am autistic AF.

<<<
Identities, stories/narratives, alienation, and connection are important topics that we can certainly discuss in time. One thing I want to say right now, is that wikis (presently TiddlyWiki) are amazing for condensing lots of the constituents of one's identity (or identifications) into a form where a ton of commonalities/similarities might jump at once at the reader. I wonder if these kind of identity constructions will transform Getting to Know Each Other once they can be part of virtual/augmented/mixed realities.
<<<

Agreed, and I hope so! Perhaps our minds are functionally OOO hyperobjects (normally reserved for much, much larger objects/processes) to each other because we can never fully simulate each others minds for a number of reasons (although, we can increase the accuracy of our theories of each other's minds). I feel that way about [[modeling my own self-model|putanumonit@gmail.com: Recur This]]. I'm curious to know what kinds of virtual/augment/mixed realities you think could be integrated into/on-top-of the wiki. Please elaborate!

I've been keeping daily snapshots of my wiki: {[[Connect]]} as a kind of timelapse and versioning tool. But, it may serve other purposes, including being used a corpus for machine learning. It would be interesting to speak with a functionally similar version of myself, or to use that as my proxy for scouring the web or acting as my proxy for voting. All of this is a long-shot, but I'm still interested in it.

<<<
Re: verification, the nature of TW seems to be that it'd be trivially easy for someone to make a slightly edited version and pass it on (for whatever reasons) as a version that the recipients might believe to be just as authentic. There might be only really improbable reasons why anyone would want to do so, but it'd give me peace of mind to allow both that everything can be downloaded & read offline forever and that the newest version can always be verified to be the one I am putting forward.
<<<

Indeed! The portability of Tiddlywiki is pretty insane (runs in the 21st centuries platform agnostic hypervisor: the browser), to the point that the origins of the document are almost irrelevant to it (one of the reasons I chose it). While I am absolutely against intellectual property, and I waive any rights to credit for my work: I don't want anyone to put words in my mouth or speak on my behalf. They are free to copy my identity, work, or any of its components and use it as they see fit (insofar as it is moral, but I have no control over that generally). They are not free to lie and masquerade as me, imho (and, I intend to protect that moral right).

<<<
I encountered your wiki on mobile (on which it wasn't so easy to use when any Tiddler would just fill the screen), so I went to the place where I knew TW shows the alphabetical list of all Tiddlers. The year 2022 (in "By 2022") caught my eye as a way to quickly see what your five-year plan might be. Future years are something I often reflect on as well, wondering how smartphones took the world by storm within a decade and what the next decades might bring. (What nonlinear developments do people anticipate in their 5–10 year plans?)

Okay, I'll read {Focus} once I return on desktop to see what are my general first impressions of your wiki (in due time). Right now, I must say it was difficult to browse on mobile, which is a problem I'm anticipating with my own TiddlyWiki as well.
<<<

I'm pretty awful at planning and predicting the future generally. That tiddler is almost an embarrassment to me at this point. That's okay. You make and take the bad with the good.

Reading this wiki on mobile is a huge pain in the ass. I do it only out of necessity. I dislike using my wiki on anything other than my main driver, [[monster-10]]. I don't see TW improving on this front either, imho, especially not mine. Admittedly, I abhor [[my phone|monster-14]]. I have no control over the damn thing. I don't know how people live on their phones. I literally need 8GB of RAM to even browse the web effectively; my wiki is no different for me.

<<<
Have you tried different fonts or why do you prefer to have it look like console? I understand the aesthetics, but is it best for the eyes? 
<<<

Monospace fonts make it easier to read and write symbolic and syntactically structured data. I also draw in it. I use a custom font with minimal width so that I can overcome one of the major disadvantages of monospacing, namely: you can't fit nearly as much on the screen. I realize a lot of people find it off-putting. I regularly have 10k words open in my story river at any given time, and I want to very quickly be able to navigate it (and the substructures in each tiddler) with ease. I'm at ~16mb of plaintext at this point, and I'm very glad to do it this way.

One difference may be that I work on a 42" screen (which has been my preference for many years). It's very comfortable on my eyes. I wager if you were sitting in my chair and pacing around in my living room, you might change your mind. I'm trying to design my wiki to be as productive as I can in my context. Of course, I could be very wrong about how to do that best. Perhaps I should keep two sets of books (looks), but I think that might also miss the point.

<<<
Anyway, I'll find later the patience to take my eyes off my own wiki to explore yours again. One reason I'll likely return to yours is to see what technical decisions you have found useful in maintaining a TiddlyWiki. And if it's not obvious from some page/Tiddler, can you explicate if the wiki has many parts (e.g., journal + media logs + poems + many non-chronological posts that you keep updating from time to time + ...)? In other words, what are the intertwined areas if you were to decide on taking the wiki apart and housing them in separate places? Perhaps breaking apart a wiki is impossible after a while, but mine seems to grow from combining years of separate logs in order to get them under a common interface and tagging system for moving between items, where the desired emergent property is a brainlike navigability so to speak (+ an awareness of interconnections).
<<<

Since your last communication I have re-written {[[Help]]} to give a better idea of how to navigate and interpret this wiki. I speak to some of the structural notions there. You can also look in my [[Program Yourself]] axiom, which was the old version of {[[Principles]]} (now replaced by [[Axioms of h0p3]]<<ref "w">>). 

Your questions are excellent and well-articulated; I'm afraid I do not have satisfying answers to them. I'm looking for the answers!

My wiki is constantly evolving, and I've tried to structure with that in mind. One of my problems is that I have no idea what it's going to look like. It feels like a different beast to me every year so far. I feel like I'm failing if I'm not continually achieving unexpected emergent properties. I feel like it's my job to build a flexible space in which to reach out into the unknown for the unknown. It's not easy to prepare myself to be fundamentally wrong and adjust to it.

I think the [[Root]] top level directories provide a virtual filesystem/sequence of computations. [[Hub]] is my constantly shifting {[[Focus]]}, and it really does contain the majority of new work in this wiki. {[[Vault]]} has plenty of old work grafted into it, but that is really just an archive; it doesn't house living content for me most of the time. I don't often know when to divide, transclude, generate multiple links, categorize, etc. This, in fact, may be equivalent to the fundamental question in philosophy. It's an elephant too big for me to see all at once. Frankly, my top-down modeling can be plain awful.

I also want the content to be systematically unified; that's one of the goals of the wiki. I think I will have failed if it can be peeled apart or reduced too far. I should also point out that {[[About]]} is (in a sense) the core telos/endpoint of the wiki (and even it has a stack inside it). All places on my wiki point in service to that anchor narrative where I directly (and idiosyncratically to extrema) tell myself the story of myself in a compact manner.

Navigation and categorization are really hard problems. I'm probably not qualified to say much on them, I'm afraid. I can only do my [[fff]] best to bring order to the chaos.

<<<
One initial difference between our wikis (after my superficial first visitation) seems to be that I've made heavier use of interconnecting my Tiddlers by tagging them with each other as tag pills. I am essentially lifelogging all books, audiobooks, podcasts, documentaries, movies, series, games, etc. (including possible tables of contents) that I've experienced (unless completely irrelevant) as Tiddlers, and tagging them by topics and by possible solutions that they might contribute to. Solution Tiddlers are also interconnected so that visiting a solution will automatically show a list of things (including other solutions) that contribute to the solution being viewed, and logically its tags will be those solutions that it might in turn contribute to. Similarly, the topic tag (i.e., Tiddler) "physics" contains automatic lists of physics books, physics documentaries, etc., as well as the umbrella tag "topics" which you can click to jump to any other topic to see the automatic lists of that. I'll also tag quotes with their sources and most relevant topics (and maybe possible solutions that the quote might relate to). So in a sense this wiki is a hierarchical web of my sources/influences and of solutions that I deem worthy of interconnecting with each other, forming a map of what to do (or pay attention to) when wanting to implement a particular solution. Without the tag hierarchies it would fall apart, but with the tag hierarchies, it feels finally like the non-chronological, brainlike solution map that I've always wanted my logs/notes/writings to result in. 
<<<

This problem has been a splinter in my mind for a long time (I assume I've a stubborn autistic modeling problem here). I've talked about the issue several times with myself. Sometimes it feels like I barely know to make use of the tools available to me. Lots of people use tags, but I've failed to see why they are useful in this case. You are obviously quite intelligent (not stroking your genitals here), and so I clearly must be doing something very wrong. Please forgive my arrogance and show me how to reason about this more effectively. I desperately want to see tags doing something uniquely powerful in a wiki; I need to unblind myself here. Perhaps I've been doing this with one-hand behind my back the whole time, and you will add another dimension to my ability to reason.

One problem may be that I just don't understand enough on the technical end of how to use Tiddlywiki's tagging mechanics. Aside: what plugins do you use for TW?<<ref "k">>

Another problem might just be that I think too many tags can be applied to any given tiddler. That might be an overwhelming problem, laziness, or even incompetence. Call out my confabulation, please. I try to minimize the effort I put into labeling content and applying metadata; I try to label only when I absolutely must. I also generate a lot of content each day, and it seems more prudent to spend my time making the content than labeling it (could easily be a huge mistake!). I use my [[Wiki Audit]] to constantly re-envision the structure of my wiki too, so being meta is definitely part of my [[Program Yourself]] axiom-plan.

Allow me to arrogantly-naively suggest the possibility that my method is functionally equivalent in some crucial ways, but perhaps tagging would still be more efficient. Optimization, of course, matters. I feel like my directory structures and tiddler naming conventions do quite a bit tag work. I also link to the same tiddler multiple times when I see it belongs in multiple places, and I also transclude content where appropriate. I do think about how my directories are related to each other quite a bit; they often interlink and get entangled with each other. It's in the writing about the entanglement that I come to see the stories unfold. I think the non-linear, non-chronological, web-mapping and hierarchies arise nicely. The relationships among the categories already seem very bright to me; I would love to find a way to legitimately brighten them further.

What functional difference in categorization am I really missing here though? How are tags going to help build taxonomies and hierarchies better than my links? Tags have a flatness of mere properties to them in my view, and links tend to force me to think hierarchically (which is the real work, right?).

Tags might make for quick keyword searches in bodies of content too large for me to manage. Tags narrow it down. But, I'm not convinced they are better than the flexible built-in search functions of this wiki (and sometimes text editors). Why keyword search when I can (and probably will probably be forced to) use custom search lasers? Sometimes I live and die by my searches. I aim to be thorough. Filter expressions can do some heavy-lifting:

`[search:title[Muh Title]search:text[Foobar in Body]]`

Let me grant, a tiddler may be about physics but never use the word physics. Perhaps a "physics" tag puts it into a category that might not be revealed by a search; I tend to be fairly specific though. Perhaps this should allow me to connect dots I didn't already see. I'm trying to think of an example in my own wiki where this would arise. Controlled vocabulary may be powerful in generalized library contexts, but it doesn't make sense for a personal wiki, imho. 

Perhaps I see every directory as a "solution tiddler." A directory uses something I consider to be equivalent to the scientific method: [[Wiki: Fundamental Epistemic Structure]], [[Applied Computational Existentialism]], {[[Help]]}, [[Wiki: Directory File Structure Template]], [[Wiki: Broad Computational Structure]], etc. Again, they all eventually point to {[[About]]}. I feel like my method is very telic and shows how the stories are rhizomatically sequenced together in many webs/contexts. Obviously, I'm still figuring it out, and I could be all wrong. I cannot see the entire elephant all at once, so I have to shotgun approach and be reductive. I also feel like in telling myself these dialectical stories I'm burning the structure into my long-term memory, like a mind-palace, to be able to emotionally reason about my own wiki. I see my wiki's structure, and I think tags do not help me with that.

Here's more food for thought: https://evernote.com/blog/designing-creativity-workflows/

So, I've tried tags, and it failed miserably for me. I've never found them useful. Maybe I've tried to use them all wrong or I'm inept. I don't want to be wrong-headed about this issue. If this is really worth my time, I should do it. 

<<<
Additionally (and this is how it began), the wiki keeps me accountable in what reading/media I spend my time on, as most or all of it would be public, as well as functioning as a two-way recommendation device of showing others what I've paid attention to (with perhaps ratings & reviews in time) and asking for others to point out my blind spots or what might balance my Insert Detrimentally Monomaniacal Focus in Some Area of Thought. Core features of everything should be rationalist Bayesian openness & commitment to updating our epistemology, and non-violent communication & feedback so we can help each other solve all problems. It is of course a welcome side-effect if publishing and maintaining a wiki would also lead to interesting unforeseen communication/connections between people. Still, I think of the solution mapping as the point.
<<<

The accountability issue is a very big one to me! I totally understand that. I agree with your claims. I hope we achieve that side-effect together too. The mapping to the telos really is the point to.

Aside: While I defend probabilistic inference against internalists ([[2013.11.06 - Skepticism, Pragmatism, and the Lottery Paradox]]), I have philosophical reservations about Bayesianism. Even though I maintain strong externalist tendencies in my epistemology, I would not call myself an empiricist.

<<<
Re: feedback, I love the geometric interpretation in your 

> [Good feedback] seems to require someone understanding your position and goals from an angle you do not. 

That does sound like a common problem, especially when doing something uncommon. Admittedly building a wiki can be a solitary business at times when any sane person would look at the bell curves for weather and go enjoy the sun. :-) Introspective feedback loops do indeed make a lot of weird-seeming things worthwhile in the long run.
<<<

As a philosopher, I've generally been accused of being a hair-splitting navel-gazer. The older I get, the happier I am with these weird-seeming goals and choices. It can be solitary, but in reaching out to others, I've found it isn't lonely! 

You've not said all that much about how your wiki relates to others in your life. I would be interested to know.

<<<
Re: "What are your thoughts on anonymity and privacy as moral, political, and technical concepts?", easier asked than answered, I'll skip that one for now!
<<<

Fair enough! Maybe one day.

<<<
Have you had inspirations directly affecting your wiki or deciding to build one? For me, I've been inspired at least by the websites or ideas of Aaron Swartz, Edge.org, Gwern, Kevin Kelly, and the Long Now Foundation. From science fiction, some important descriptions have been the Truth Mines and "polis libraries" in Greg Egan's Diaspora; I'd love for my wiki to eventually be spatially visualizable in a virtual reality environment so that one could go there for a data dive.
<<<

I originally started my wiki to climb out of my depression and write [[2016.10.17 - Letter to Mom and Dad]]. It turned into me talking and listening to myself. I'm glad I have. This is a question I'm still thinking about. I've found [[Infinite Jest]] and [[How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought you Think]] to be interesting looking glasses for me recently. I'm a philosopher by trade, and I had a very religious upbringing, so the bodies of work of a number of systematic thinkers in history in [[The Great Human Conversation]] resonate with me; I feel like I'm trying to join them. I'm still thinking about this one.

Your inspirations are interesting to me. I can dig it.

The hacker ethic has shaped me for a couple decades (it's one of the reasons I formally studied ethics), so I appreciate Aaron Swartz (particularly on intellectual property, which is what my thesis and dissertation argued against wholesale). I don't know if he has been an inspiration for the wiki for me, but I can appreciate how he could. 

[[edge.org|https://www.edge.org/]] only shows up 5 times (of ~15k outbound links) in my wiki, so I can't say it's been a huge influence. I do like the site though. 

I've had my eye on Gwern for a while. [[Link Log]]ed essentially three times, but in particular: 

* [[Links: Rabbitholes]]
* [[Eventual FTO Candidates]] ([[FTO]])
* [[Links: Rationalism Blogs]]

This isn't well-organized at all. It's sitting there, but I do intend to reach out to this person.

I know almost nothing about Kevin Kelly. The quantified self, notion, however, I have been interested in. There is something like that going on in the wiki, no doubt. I think the wiki is profoundly good at communicating the qualitative in quantitative structures and vice versa.

I have only a tidbit of experience with longnow, and only fairly recently at that. I have to reserve my judgment because I know too little. Admittedly, I might not mesh well with it (e.g. I'm not a huge fan of [Neo-]Rationalist communities, although I pay attention to them).

The "polis libraries" are certainly interesting to me. I brainstorm a bit about the topic (e.g. [[AIoutopIA]]). It has some intersection with the philosophical end of work I do in [[Philosophy]], etc. I actually think [[The Original Position]] should be built from AI's trained on models like my wiki. I think I could grow to trust a blockbox generated from my own self-modeling using a method I understood. I'd love to learn from a more rational version of myself (and I think an AI version of me [or an AI built on top of such a thing] would have the tools to teach IRL me in a way that is qualia-driven, almost a private language). The ghost in the shell considerations are serious problems for me in philosophy. I cannot say I've been able to effectively address them (or even the possibility of being able to satisfactorily address them). This is a long-term project for me.

I can see the appeal of VR. Turning this wiki into something like a //Neuromancer// experience machine or //Minority Report// UI could be amazing, but I begin to lose my vision. I don't even know where to begin. I can only assume the wiki is a starting place. I like the way you think. Not trying to circlejerk, but I don't meet enough people like you who take the wiki seriously in this respect.

I'd would very much like to hear more about your vision of this. Please, tell me what you see!

<<<
Phew. I never really wrote letters by hand, but it feels like I just did. Feel free to take your time. I'll return to your wiki in some time.

Happy wikiing(?)!

–LS 
<<<

Aye, this practice seems to take it out of me too. I'm glad we do though. Long-form communication is not low-hanging fruit, but some things cannot be built or expressed without it.
