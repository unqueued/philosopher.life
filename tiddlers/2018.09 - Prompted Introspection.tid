!! Audit:

* Lol. I'm being sarcastic here.
* Diogenesocrates shows up! I'm glad to finally have an interlocutor whom I respect. I really want to write to him more often.
* Prompted Introspection continues to stand out as my favorite log to audit by far. It's strongly me.
* My answers felt more robust this month than last month.
* My non-answers are perfectly fine.
* I'm annoyed by double-questions. Lol.
* I'm finally hitting a point where I'm researching my own wiki to integrate into my answers. It's not just what I can remember, it's what I can find. I need to make that habit that I grow!
* Lots of political questions.
* Looking at previous answers builds another kind of thread. This log has a real fabric to it.
* This log reminds me just how much work I have to do in this wiki. It's going to take a long time to build it. I feel directly called out to build {[[Principles]]} here. Convicted, I tell you what.
* Overall, I kicked ass in this log. I am pleased to do some thinkin' in here.
