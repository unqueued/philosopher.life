title: 2020.01.16 - Computer Musings: For Charlie

Still don't have a living room working, and I need to make sure I'm not pushing myself hard (my wife wouldn't even walk with me today, says I need to just relax).

In any case, [[monster]]-15 isn't going to hold the time, and some 1080p encodes just don't render nicely. Will throw into the rainy day computer junk pile. `/salute`. [[monster-10]] will become HTPC, KDE-Manjaro (VNC does not play nice with my [[i3]] config out of the box). `/rez`

My wife claims she no longer needs [[monster]]-12 because she has her work computers (they've offered her 3 machines, lol). My argument about owning her device, having a place which is legally hers and not available to prying eyes seems irrelevant to her (I have failed, obviously). We do run a cloud for her at the house (and elsewhere). I have an extra laptop in the house now; I know [[Charlie]] needs one.

Setting up KDE-Manjaro on [[monster-17]] for [[Charlie]]. I want to hand him a device like [[gh057]]. May his working knowledge of ancient computers evolve nicely for him. I still want to hand him a machine which "just werx."

* Resilio Sync

[[m10]] is up, and it's almost all set up.
