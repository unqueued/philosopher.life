title: 2019.07.31 - Prompted Introspection: My Whirlwind

!! What is something about yourself that you dislike?

Super important interview question: [[2017.12.21 - Prompted Introspection Log: Dislike About Myself]]. Recently, I'd say I dislike how poorly I perform in the whirlwind. There are 10k things to do, and I am not good at narrowing it down. I think this adds pressure to those who interact with me as well, which is often not fair to them. I'm working on it.
