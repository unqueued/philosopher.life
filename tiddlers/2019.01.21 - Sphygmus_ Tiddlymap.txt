OMFG,. That is [[Beautiful]].
MON 11:52 AM
I love your tiddlymap.
MON 11:53 AM
thank you!! It took some experimenting to setup the view -- I love seeing all the various connections and clustering.
MON 12:03 PM
We may have talked about this, but if you don't mind elaborating again - what's the difference between Hub and Pin for you? Pin is what you use every day while Hub is more of an overview for other people, if I were guessing..?
MON 7:25 PM
It looks like stars, maybe it's a rotating planet.
MON 9:23 PM
Kind of reminds me of hurricanes on a map too.
MON 9:24 PM
Hub is what I use every day.
MON 9:24 PM
In fact, it houses Hub houses the transclusion of //Focus://{[[Focus]]}.
MON 9:25 PM
It is the core {[[Focus]]} of the wiki itself on a day to day basis.
MON 9:26 PM
I think of everything else in my sidebar as being complementary to [[Hub]].
MON 9:27 PM
I see!
MON 9:28 PM
You might find this weird, but I strongly prefer NOT to use the search bar (though I use it every day). I want to visually navigate through my directories to understand how they fit into the [[Root]] virtual directory structure.
MON 9:28 PM
[[Hub]] is broken up into timeslices/frames for the most part.
MON 9:29 PM
It's a scheduler for my usage of the wiki.
MON 9:29 PM
It helps me reason from a mile-high view what is important to me.
MON 9:30 PM
I'm not very good at that sometimes, and I think it forces me to be honest with myself to some extent (it can also be a wonderful source of anxiety, lol).
MON 9:30 PM
I am pleased to have moved to a tagging system for it.
MON 9:31 PM
I hope to firmcode it as well.
MON 9:32 PM
What is [[Pin]]? I'm not entirely sure. I should know. It's filled with shortcuts for constructing the wiki. [[Wiki Audit]], [[Wiki Mechanic]], and the oldest of them, my axiom [[Program Yourself]] are what show up strongest to me.
MON 9:34 PM
Perhaps I need to write an //About://[[Pin]].
MON 9:35 PM
[[Pin]] is messy. It's a hack. It's almost [[/b/]]ish to me in how little accountability I have there. It's a bunch of shortcuts, many of which just don't really seem to belong on [[Hub]] to me (though I may be wrong).
MON 9:36 PM
[[The Remodeling]] should have put me in a good position, but now I just have so much going on, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do everything I wanted in the timeframe I've set out. Lol.
MON 9:37 PM
What do you think it should be?
MON 9:38 PM
I definitely haven't settled into a rhythm when it comes to navigating my wiki -- sometimes I search and other times I dig through the root tab directories to get where I want to go. Mostly I think I search when I'm not sure what I'm looking for -- or I know what I'm looking for but not where it is.

It is interesting to me that Hub is timeslices! I'll have to go look at it again. I've been thinking about re-writing my "root" tiddler since I looked at my whole wiki in TiddlyMap. 

Every time I search for the same thing, I consider starting a "shortcuts" tab...
MON 9:39 PM
by it you mean both Hub and Pin?
MON 9:41 PM
I meant Pin, but actually I'd like to know both.
MON 9:42 PM
Also, I think not knowing where I'm going or where something belongs are problems I never seen to be able to solve enough in my "Ocean of Crazy." =)
MON 9:43 PM
Were I constructing a shortcut tab, I think it would look a lot like Pin -- as I see it, the goal is to go from point A to point B as fast as possible, so the structure, however messy, should facilitate that.
MON 9:44 PM
Are you considering using the most heavily linked tiddlers from the TiddlyMap into part of the shortcut tab?
MON 9:46 PM
I hadn't considered checking TiddlyMap for that, honestly
MON 9:46 PM
Mostly it would be a list of wiki tools that I want to be able to get to quickly without having to open up the wiki tiddler
MON 9:47 PM
Find and replace, edit creation date, tiddlymap being the ones I look for most often I think
MON 9:48 PM
Quick links to my plugin dictionary settings, for sure
MON 9:48 PM
Some of those tools might go in Tools or as a vertical tab in More
MON 9:49 PM
I //never// check the tools tab lmao
MON 9:49 PM
well, on the rare occasion I'm looking for the tiddler manager I guess I do
MON 9:50 PM
I never use Tools either.
MON 9:51 PM
It's too messy for me! I can't stand it. If I need something from there I use the drop down menu by my settings button, usually.
