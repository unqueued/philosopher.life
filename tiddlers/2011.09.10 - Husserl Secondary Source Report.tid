title: 2011.09.10 - Husserl Secondary Source Report

In my last report, I chose to investigate the second chapter of Husserl's Phenomenology by Dan Zahavi, which was directly about the phenomenological and transcendental reductions. Oddly, I could not find the middle step, the eidetic reduction, in this chapter. Interestingly, the eidetic reduction is found in the first chapter, entitled “The Early Husserl: Logic, Epistemology, and Intentionality.” In this chapter, and in order of appearance, Zehavi covers Husserl s criticism of psychologism; the concept of intentionality; notions of act, meaning, and objects; signitive and intuitive givenness; the notion of evidence; categorical objects and wesensschau; and a brief introduction to phenomenology and metaphysics which sets up for the second chapter. The eidetic reduction is discussed in the last parts of the first chapter.

Zehavi points out that “one of the tasks of phenomenology is precisely to overcome and replace the narrow empiristic concept of experience with an enlarged one, and to clarify all of its different forms, be they the intuition of essential structures, of apodictic evidence...”<<ref "1">> Essentialism is at the heart of the eidetic reduction, and it seems to be the study of the essential types, categories, and structures of experience. Also, eidetic structures are just self-evident in the experience itself.

We are provided with a distinction between formal and material ontology. Formal ontology is “the discipline that investigates what it means to be an object… it is not concerned with the differences between various types of objects, but in that which is unconditionally true for any object whatsoever. The work of a formal ontology is consequently to be found in the elucidation of such categories as quality, property, relation, identity, whole, part, and so on.”<<ref "2">> In contrast, material (also referred to as ‘regional’) ontology “examines the essential structures belonging to a given region or kind of object and seeks to determine that which holds true with necessity for any member of the region in question.”<<ref "3">>

The eidetic reduction (or variation) is “a kind of conceptual analysis where we attempt to imagine the object as being different from how it currently is. Sooner or later this imaginative variation will lead us to certain properties that cannot be varied, that is, changed and transgressed, without making the object cease to be the kind of object it is.”<<ref "4">> This method of thinking allows us to understand what differentiates essential and accidental features or properties of objects. The eidetic reduction is the pursuit of knowledge of the structure of experience; it is thinking about the fundamental differences between categories such as mathematical, physical, mental, and other objects (such as art).
