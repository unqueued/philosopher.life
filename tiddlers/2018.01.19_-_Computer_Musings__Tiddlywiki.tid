title: 2018.01.19 - Computer Musings: Tiddlywiki
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I have now tried several options with serving Tiddlywiki. I wish there was a clean way for me to have individual tiddlers with automatic updating and building that didn't consume an arm and a leg. Such a system can be built, but I don't feel like it.<<ref "2019.03.22">>

Make the server from an index.html file:

```bash
cd Syncs # Where I want to put the directory
tiddlywiki philosopher.life --init server # Make a tiddlywiki directory
tiddlywiki philosopher.life --load ~/index.html # Load contents of index.html file into new wiki dir
tiddlywiki philosopher.life --server 8080 $:/core/save/lazy-all text/plain text/html "" "" "0.0.0.0"
```
(Anyone can edit that online, btw). 

I tried out --build. Static might be able to solve my problem, but it doesn't look like it. Build is computationally expensive. If I do move that direction, I need to create a button/script for it to build, and I want to autobuild every hour or so. Hourly releases to the site is fine with me. 

After playing with tiddlywiki.info, I found the build time can be reduced significantly, to a second or so. I'm happy to continue doing that every minute. So...boom. Resilio isn't play beautifully with it, but the rest of the process is working well.

I've setup the snapshot script to git add the .tid folder as well.
