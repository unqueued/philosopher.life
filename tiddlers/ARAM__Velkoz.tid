title: ARAM: Velkoz

Velkoz is a shitty version of Lux, but even a shitty version of Lux is strong on ARAM. I very much like the placestyle. His Ult is literally the weakest part of his kit. 

* Summoners
** Clarity - He's a mana whore, and you basically don't give a shit otherwise.
** Flash
* Build
** Items
*** Start
**** Catalyst of Aeons
**** Refillable Potion
*** General Build
**** Rod of Ages - His pre-6 game is incredibly strong. You basically want to extend his pre-death "laning" phase for as long as possible. Healing your mana and hp up while poking them down allows you to attrition them out.
**** Ionian Boots of Lucidity - CDR is key. You basically want to spam the entire game.
**** Morellonomicon - The CDR and mana regen are incredibly valuable. 
**** Banshee's Veil or Zhonya's Hourglass - 10% CDR, AP, Mitigation Stat, and a Defensive ability. It rounds you out. 
***** If you want both, then go for Sorcerer's Shoes.
**** Luden's Echo - I think the Passive is quite strong on a poke mage. It adds up.
**** Rabadon's Deathcap - You have a shit of AP. Might as well make it huge.
