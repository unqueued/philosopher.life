*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** You had a great school day two years ago.
** We are all lucky that you took the time to write so thoroughly two years ago, and we will surely miss your not having done so yesterday.
*** Take for instance, [[2018/04/20 -- Life Log]], wherein you provide narrative and context about your own mother that she doesn't have in her own wiki. You help us understand who she is. That's generous of you.
**** I hope others will be just as generous in helping you piece together your past.
***** You let me know if that is air you manually breathing, alright?
** I wish you spent more time hyperreading on HN and a curated multireddit. I still consider them stronger tools for learning and finding people than Discord. 
** I'm going to write extra long to make up for how short this [[h0p3ful Review]] would otherwise be. I don't like the idea that it's so isolated, quiet, and lacking in quality content. 
** Don't you hate it when a teacher lies and says the homework will be a piece of cake?
*** It always tastes like paper.
** Don’t drink beer while solving Calculus homework
*** You shouldn’t drink and derive
**  A kid in school hands in a blank piece of paper for his art homework. 
*** The teacher says, "What's this?"
**** The kid says, "A picture of a cow eating grass."
***** The teacher asks, "Where's the grass?"
****** The kid says, "The cow ate it all."
******* "Ok, then where's the cow?"
******** "It left because there was no more grass."
********* (Yes, this is exactly how I want to structure this.)
********** (Do you want to know why?)
*********** (Not particularly? Surely, you want to know why your father is doing what he is doing here, right?)
************ (I'm trying to be absurd with you because otherwise I would just be angry.)
************* (Let us succeed next time.)
