title: 2018.10.12 - Prompted Introspection: Regrets

!! When do you think about your regrets the most often?

That's an odd question. I attempt to make up for my mistakes. Insofar as I am powerless over my regrets, I attempt to set them aside to prevent them from taking over my neurotic mind (though, I do not try to forget or dismiss them). My regrets are motivating to be a better human, father, and person, though I cannot say I succeed in this either (more to regret, eh?). I'm opposed to the "no regrats" point of view. I want to recognize who I was and how I came to be who I am. My regrets usually hover between cringe and existential pain that makes me want to give up or take my life.
