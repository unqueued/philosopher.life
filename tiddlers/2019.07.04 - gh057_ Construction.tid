Dear gh057,

Receiving a letter from you is a gift. Letters house so much intention and deliberation to me. They capture some of who we are in a way that nothing else can. Thank you for taking the time to write me. =)

<<<
h0p3,

Hey there sir! I hope this finds you well tonite.
<<<

It's a treat to hear from you. I've been doing well enough. I'm not sleeping as well as I'd like, but that's okay. Overall, we're grinding in the day, and my evenings are blessed. I like taking walks in the evening when I can; it's been pretty hot, lately.

<<<
I tried to use the name you gave me but it was already taken. I did use a variation that I hope will work.
<<<

Ah, I'm sorry. I should have guessed, lol. That name is too [[Leet]] to not be taken on that service provider. [[Your|gh057]] person page is updated to include the information. I have no idea if anyone would contact you, but you never know. I've seen some people do contact each other from across the wiki, and I think that's pretty interesting.

Still at the school, looks like the better part of another week. Its been an event. Dave and I are basically working for free because he only got a week and I 2 weeks pay so after the first week of June for Dave and 2nd week of June for me, we are working for free...crazy i know but i cant help but want to finish this. Maybe better planning by us will help next year.
<<<

It is ridiculous how little they pay, and it's disturbing that you don't get paid for your time. It's straight up exploitation, sir. There's nothing you can do about it, and it's not your fault. The under the table wink-wink bargaining and unspoken expectations are immoral. Every time I've seen you in the hallways, I become angry on your behalf. 

<<<
I continue to read your Wiki daily as best as time allows.
<<<

I'm flattered you read what I think. Ignore or read it at will. There are different approaches to reading this monolith, and I hope to make it easier to use. Let me know if there's functionality you want. Also, sometimes it takes me months to complete a reply to someone (though I aim to be fast; it depends on the topics I'm writing about). I hope to make asynchronous communications first class in this. I call it a [[hyperconversation]]. 

<<<
It still is a great read and i appreciate how you have taken so much time to log your life as you do. That is brilliant and so wonderful. A legacy left for others . Thats some great stuff there.
<<<

That is high praise. Thank you. It serves many purposes, and legacy is one of them. One of my {[[Axioms]]} is to [[Be A Good Dad]]. It's a lot of work, but you know that.

In case it would interest you, my family's wikis can be found here:

* [[k0sh3k]], my wife: http://bookwyrm.philosopher.life/
* [[1uxb0x]], my son: http://1uxb0x.philosopher.life/
* [[j3d1h]], my daughter: http://j3d1h.philosopher.life/

They aren't too difficult to set up. I don't know if you would want to escape Facebook to make your own wiki; and, I don't know if you would want any help doing it, but we are happy to help you set it up. I am, of course, happy to converse over my wiki and you over e-mail. Having your own wiki is a different experience than I've found with the big and powerful social media sites. You own your data, you get to shape it however you see fit, you are difficult to censor, you can have way more control over how others can access it, it allows you to retain some independence (fitting for the 4th of July), and it's fun. I get to be myself in my wiki, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.

Writing letters is something I don't have enough practice in, but I can see it's been an important puzzle piece which has been missing from life. I like having the chance to think and shape who I am as I try to respond. That slow, thoughtful, long-form conversation style from our own sites is something I treasure. 

<<<
We would love to come over sometime. I have a trip the week of the 15th of July but hopefully we can work something out between our schedules.
<<<

That sounds great. As I said, you call the date and time, and that's when we'll do it!

<<<
Thanks for being a friend and bless you and your family. I hope all is well and thriving.

Best wishes

gh057

I have some questions!

* How's the wire job going? 
* How's your grand-daughter doing? How much have you been able to see her since school went out of session?
* How was your experience at the haunted psychiatric ward?

Also, you have my number, and I use it with a messenger I trust called: [[Signal|https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&hl=en_US]].<<ref "c">> I like how it's encrypted, and I like how it allows me to speak over multiple devices. I often prefer to chat over my computer (I like a big keyboard over the tiny one on my phone). Anyway, if you also want to instant message, that's a great tool.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
