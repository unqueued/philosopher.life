title: 2020.01.08 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Old Souls

!! Respond to the following gem:

I like this one. My hypothesis is that having your ducks in a row as early as possible, being wise from the beginning, heading the right direction and thinking long-term, having habituated what is necessary for being old while you are young is what would allow one to have the resources and freedom to feel and be young when they are old. Crucially, that does not make it moral, but this is stated as a hypothetical imperative. Further, moral luck defines more of our lives than we do on this front. It isn't generally up to us very much what our lives look like, especially when we are young. 

I work hard to teach my offspring to be old souls at young ages. It's too easy to {[[focus]]} on what doesn't matter (even when attending to light, frilly, or [[FO]] irrelevant objects is [[SO]] [[salient]] to some [[dok]]). The odds they face are disturbing. I think that means they forego many of the pleasant and carefree aspects that contemporary parenting norms push,<<ref "m">> but I see no other choice. It would be radical moral luck to be naturally virtuous for the sake of justified eudaimonia, and I don't think I've ever met such a creature. I have to help them antipleonasmify the world, hand them justifiably fit models and {[[axioms]]} (and training) so that by the time they are 25, the hardest problems will be their strengths. Obviously, I'm woefully unqualified for the task, and I [[hope]] they will be able to appreciate my effort despite my profound failures to be the father they deserve.
