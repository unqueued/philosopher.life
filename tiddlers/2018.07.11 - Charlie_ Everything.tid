title: 2018.07.11 - Charlie: Everything

Charlie and I argued about Christianity, Incompleteness, Politics, Computation, Evolution, Biblical Authority, Physics, and everything in between. We ultimately hit a loggerhead where he would not agree to the logical truth of "a=a," despite an hour and half of walking through it. He may have the other side of the dialetheistic perspective, and so we're getting there.

Sometimes he strikes gold, and sometimes he has missed everything. The variance inside him is immense.

He joked about taking notes during our talks to write a book.
