title: McManus: Understanding Postmodern Conservatism: A Reply To Aaron Hanlon

<<<
Unnecessary jabs at Quillette aside
<<<

I'm okay with it.

<<<
But this is incorrect and, in fact, our positions are far closer together than he seems to realize.
<<<

That is weird.

<<<
 there is no causal link between the academic prominence of postmodern theory and the emergence of Trumpist postmodern conservatism
<<<

That is unfortunately wildly overstated. I thought you were just joking before. Maybe we need to go back to defining causality here.

<<<
They include Bill Kristol, David Frum, and of course the recently deceased John McCain. 
<<<

I think I have a much broader definition of post-modern conservative than you then. McCain and Kristol paid lipservice. Be Straussian! This is realpolitik time. I consider myself a spiritual Straussian successor, and I think the neocons have completely misunderstood what paranoic charity really means; they are rhetoricians instead of philosophers. I hope they burn in hell for invoking my teacher's teacher's teacher's name in vain.<<ref "t">> I don't have the verbal IQ to accomplish what the master Straussians can do, but I've seen their philosophical prowess. There is something quite right about it. I think pomocons include a broad spectrum.

<<<
 It is not just the product of contemporary postmodern culture, which provided the necessary but not sufficient conditions for postmodern conservatism’s emergence. 
<<<

There you go. I'm glad to see you step back and say it correctly.

<<<
While Edmund Burke was not a postmodern theorist himself, it is impossible to deny the parallels between his thinking and postmodernism. 
<<<

I'm not an expert, obviously. I see the threads of postmodern throughout a lot of history though. 

<<<
it is helpful to divide postmodern theorists into two categories: postmodern philosophers and theorists of postmodern culture.
<<<

A lovely distinction.

<<<
Like all skeptics, postmodern philosophers challenge the claim that human reason can give us certainty; whether descriptive certainty about how the world is, or moral certainty about which values should orient our actions.
<<<

I think it is far more destructive than that. It's not just certainty, it's even confidence. I think it attacks our ability to provide justification to anything because the epistemic standard is ridiculously high in this context. It eats everything. 

<<<
Contra Professor Hanlon’s contention, I do not claim that postmodern academic discourse prompted the rise of Trumpism. Rather, it is under the conditions of postmodern culture that the strands of conservatism discussed earlier could mutate into their current postmodern form.
<<<

That's a damned shame. You've not provided a sufficient argument for this thesis. I grant you that the conditions of postmodern culture are closer in the causal chain and even more relevant in some sense. 

I think postmodernism is a memetic disease in academic discourse (which just is a kind of culture) and the world at large. I don't care about Hanlon's contention here. Academia really is profoundly responsible for failing to wrestle the pomo hyperbeast effectively enough. I legitimately find a non-trivial number academic philosophers morally repugnant, and I do think they have influence in the world.<<ref "h">>

<<<
These groups see the destabilization of identity and values as an opportunity to establish a new kind of pluralistic society where traditionally ‘marginalized’ groups are given a greater say. 
<<<

That is to say, it is an opportunity to compute [[The Original Position]] with much greater precision.

I think postmodernism is defeatable.
