//A truly unique friend in my life. I could not imagine life without him.//

JRE is the older of my two younger brothers.<<ref "t">> I love that we three brothers can talk about anything with each other.<<ref "a">> Besides my wife, he is my best friend. We share a great deal in common. We talk often, and we understand each other quite well. JRE and I were born 17 months apart, which made us competitive peers and playmates with secret languages. I can't say I was a good brother growing up,<<ref "b">> but I have legitimately tried to be the best brother to him that I can since his divorce many years ago.<<ref "m">>

My brother thinks he lives in my shadow, that he is a response to me, and that his life would be radically different (I don't know if that means better or worse) without me in his life. I agree I am a polarizing figure in people's lives, a man of extremities. Part of this is the result of the parenting dynamics we grew up with (outside my control), but I accept responsibility for the pain I've caused him. I've apologized many times for it, and I still will. I have failed to morally empathize with my brother on too many occassions. I'm still working on it. I've got to help my brother find himself as he sees best.

Since losing our Christian faiths, in coming to see the world for more like what it truly is, in escaping the decades long cultic gaslighting and manipulation of our donors, we've struggled to come up with effective ways to solve our existential crises and practical life concerns.<<ref "c">> My brother was the inspiration for giving me the courage to lose my faith, and I am forever grateful to him for it. We have held onto each other in the foxhole, attempting to support each other in the whirlwind around us. We became broken shells together, but we both help put each other's humpties back together. He probably doesn't fully grasp it, but I owe him my life several times over.

My brother has called me his canary and his oracle. I aim to tell him my picture of the world and ourselves as best as I can see and express it. One thing I deeply appreciate about my brother is his willingness to wrestle with me. He sharpens me and my models. He deftly changes my mind with reason, and he curates salience for me. I'm often unintentionally a shitty-mean wrestler, and I must make it up to him. I can tell he really does love me. I hope to continually repay and earn my brother's respect through my honesty, effort, and empathy, especially because I respect him for those very reasons.

One of the deepest asymmetries in our relationship is in regards to my children. My brother is such a good uncle, and I can't repay him for it. I talk about my children with him all the time, and he regularly finds way to improve my children's lives in ways that I can't. Over and over I have seen him act as a better dad to my children than I am with them, and I feel like such a failure watching him. Few men shame me so effectively. He helps me become a better dad and person; fitting the Epicurean requirement, JRE's presence calls forth my best. I'm lucky to have him in my life.

!! Principles:

* Write about your relationship with your brother.
* Build charitable theories of mind, practice [[The Golden Rule]], [[T42T]], etc.


---
!! Focus:

* Questions to Ask:
** What about making science fiction together?
** Would you consider doing Redhat or AWS certification with me?

* [[JRE: Powerful Lines]]

* Uncharitable Thoughts
** I worry my brother feels no purpose.
*** Maybe he's finding the answer his own way. Furthermore, I have an intense point of view in searching for the meaning in my life. Perhaps it is not fair for to wish for my brother to dive into the existential pool anything like I think he should.
*** It's super crucial to me that my brother doesn't feel like he's competing with me; I wish he would compete with himself and I could cheer him on. I need to spend more time trying to maximize my neutrality with my brother's life decisions. I'm not standing in his shoes, and I need to constantly remind myself of that fact.
** I feel like I'm far more likely to //make// free time to speak with my brother than he is with me; he tends to only speak with me in his passively generated free time. 
*** But, I'm exceptionally draining to speak with! Perhaps I'm vampiric to him, and I must make sure I am not that way for him.
*** I'm being unfair. He regularly paces with me; we walk and talk together often.

!! Dreams:

* I should have a letter for my brother JRE too. I've written one for each of those in my immediate family, and I'd be mistaken not to have something for him as well.
* Search through the wiki and start grafting my thoughts back into this. I want to be able to think wisely and clearly about who we are.
