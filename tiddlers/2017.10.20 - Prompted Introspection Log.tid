!! What do you love about life?

I don't want to take this to a negative place, so I'm going to restrict my interpretation of the question of "my life." 

* I love my family, and they really are central to my life.
* My relationships give meaning and value to my life, and I love having that meaning and value.
** Even though I'm worried about dependency (came by that one honestly), autonomy, and self-destructive approval-seeking, it is the truth that I need and want to need my family.
* I enjoy pleasure (by definition); I love pleasure.
** And, I have ample opportunities.

There are lots of little things too, but they generally fit in the above framework as examples really.
