title: 2018.08.03 -- BAGD: Art

Your goal as a digital artist is to do as little by hand as possible because you've got automation, techniques, and hacks to do the dirty work. You'd rather learn how to automate the process than every do it by hand. If you spend 45seconds doing the same thing multiple times, automate that shit.

Use your quant to tell the right-sided stories well.
