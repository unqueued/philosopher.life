title: 2018.09.18 -- CATI: Ontological Proof of The Right

The Ontological Proof of [[The Right]]. It has always fucking bugged me that we talk about the "bindingness" question of [[The Moral Law]] as something we can abstract away and then ask that famous question, "Why be moral?". Clearly, this is stupid. If you really took that thing to exist hypothetically, then you have already answered your question. The "why" is a justification question, but [[The Right]] is self-justifying by definition. It is why it must be an axiom.

Wake up! This is an Ontological Proof. If you think you are thinking about [[The Moral Law]] and feel like you can ask the question "Why be moral?" then you clearly aren't really thinking about [[The Moral Law]] as being real. To actually think about the reality of [[The Moral Law]] requires already knowing it binds you.

Somehow, it isn't a well-formed question, folks.
