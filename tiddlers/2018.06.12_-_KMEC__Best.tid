title: 2018.06.12 - KMEC: Best

I'm doing the best I can with what I have. You were evil twats  ultimately support Neoliberalization, which is a non-trivial reason why we can't afford good medical care. I had to take matters into my own hands. I did well with what I had. People under my mental constraints generally do a far worse job picking out their medicines. You weren't there, and you didn't try to understand. You did nothing to help, and then you are going to judge. Go KYS.
