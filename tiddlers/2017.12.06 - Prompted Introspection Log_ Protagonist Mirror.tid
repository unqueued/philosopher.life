!! Can you picture yourself in the shoes of any of the protagonists [in the latest movies you've seen]?

[[The Thirteenth Floor]], [[Ex Machina]], and [[Hunt for the Wilderpeople]] were the last movies I saw. I see myself in all of them to some extent, of course. The redpilledness, the curiosity, the existentialism, and the ethical considerations of all the movies matter to me. 

Perhaps I've misunderstood the question. I believe I am capable of empathizing with all the characters (and groups) in these films. In fact, I think that's how I appreciate them in the first place. 

This is part of the reason everyone likes Keanu Reeves, Will Smith, and other always-themselves-blankness-everyday-joe actors...They have an easy time putting themselves in the character's shoes played by these actors. I think this is a fundamental problem in how cinema works and empathic literacy in general.
