Seems to be a both genetic and memetic to me. Here's an interesting Redpilled, Grey Slate way to think about it. It is clear to me that there are genetic differences between the sexes, that we come imbued with categories about the world, tendencies, dispositions, etc. Evolution is filled with randomness (and perhaps we arbitrarily call them mistakes when it suits us), and it seems completely plausible that this is just another expression of evolution. Even neo-traditionalists should see this path.
