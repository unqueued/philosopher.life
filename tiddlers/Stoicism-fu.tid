There is some bullshit to wade through in Stoicism (it's philosophy for people who can barely do philosophy). This is the distilled set of techniques and approaches that are tenable, mostly self-consistent, and appear worthy of our time. These don't peel apart perfectly, there is plenty of overlap, and the categories are far from perfect. This is the best I can do for now.

* //__Stoic Fork__//: Ask yourself, "Is this thing within my power?" Make the best use of things in your control and let nature handle the rest. This is the fundamental concept in Stoicism.
** Review Your Impressions: Appearances can be deceiving. Test and re-interpret your reality map and conscious experience in search of what you can and cannot control.
*** "So make a practice at once of saying to every strong impression: ‘An impression is all you are, not the source of the impression.’ Then test and assess it with your criteria, but one primarily: ask, ‘Is this something that is, or is not, in my control?’ And if it’s not one of the things that you control, be ready with the reaction, ‘Then it’s none of my concern.’" - Epictetus, Enchiridion I.5
*** "Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it is easier to maintain control." - Epictetus, Enchiridion XX


* //__Premeditatio Malorum__//: Mentally rehearse the evils you will encounter, practice negative visualization, assume the worst, and train yourself to be comfortable with worst case scenarios.
** “Cling tooth and nail to the following rule: Not to give in to adversity, never to trust prosperity, and always to take full note of fortune’s habit of behaving just as she pleases, treating her as if she were actually going to do everything it is in her power to do. Whatever you have been expecting for some time comes as less of a shock.” - Seneca, Letters From a Stoic
** "If an evil has been pondered beforehand, the blow is gentle when it comes. To the fool, however, and to him who trusts in fortune, each event as it arrives "comes in a new and sudden form," and a large part of evil, to the inexperienced, consists in its novelty. This is proved by the fact that men endure with greater courage, when they have once become accustomed to them, the things which they had at first regarded as hardships." - Seneca, Letter 76
** Assume people are evil and have no control over themselves.
*** "I shall meet today inquisitive, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. People do not choose to behave the way they do so that men of a certain type should behave as they do is inevitable. To wish it otherwise were to wish the fig-tree would not yield its juice." - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations II.1
** Practice living in 'worse case scenario' simulations and experiment with superficiality to make it hollow for yourself. Practice discomfort.
*** "Set aside a certain number of days during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while, 'Is this the condition that I feared?'" --Seneca, Letters, 18
*** Only be ashamed of things worth being ashamed of. Inoculate yourself against superficial attachment to what others think.
*** Planned Fasting, Cold, Poverty, Ugly Clothes, etc.
*** Put yourself through situations that warrant ridicule in order to become resistant to it.


* //__Additional Reframing and Thought Policing__//:
** Third-Person Perspective Taking
*** "We can familiarize ourselves with the will of nature by calling to mind our common experiences. When a friend breaks a glass, we are quick to say, ‘Oh, bad luck.’ It’s only reasonable, then, that when a glass of your own breaks, you accept it in the same patient spirit. Moving on to graver things: when somebody’s wife or child dies, to a man we all routinely say, ‘Well, that’s part of life.’ But if one of our own family is involved, then right away it’s ‘Poor, poor me!’ We would do better to remember how we react when a similar loss afflicts others." - Epictetus, Enchiridion XXVI
** Temporary Ownership: Never think of things you own as yours, merely borrowing from the universe (recycle).
** Context Shifting: Cosmic relativism; remember you’re going to die and the world will keep turning.
*** "You can rid yourself of many useless things among those that disturb you, for they lie entirely in your imagination; and you will then gain for yourself ample space by comprehending the whole universe in your mind, and by contemplating the eternity of time, and observing the rapid change of every part of everything, how short is the time from birth to dissolution, and the illimitable time before birth as well as the equally boundless time after dissolution." - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations IX.32
** Live Simply: Pursue what matters. Happiness is mostly a state of mind (or a result of states of mind).
*** "Is it not madness and the wildest lunacy to desire so much when you can hold so little? … [it is folly] to think that it is the amount of money and not the state of mind that matters!" - Seneca, Consolation To Helvia
** Fatalism: want events to happen as they do, and accept the past and present for what they are, not being bitter that they are not different.
** Positive Nihilism: Make your own meaning.
** Self-Retreat: Enjoy living in your own head because you can't escape it.
*** "People seek retreats for themselves in the countryside by the seashore, in the hills, and you too have made it your habit to long for that above all else. But this is altogether unphilosophical, when it is possible for you to retreat into yourself whenever you please; for nowhere can one retreat into greater peace or freedom from care than within one’s own soul, especially when a person has such things within him that he merely has to look at them to recover from that moment perfect ease of mind (and by ease of mind I mean nothing other than having one’s mind in good order). So constantly grant yourself this retreat and so renew yourself; but keep within you concise and basic precepts that will be enough, at first encounter, to cleanse you from all distress and to send you back without discontent to the life to which you will return." - Marcus Aurelius, Meditation IV.3
** Align your expectations and predictions.


* __//Self-Control//__:
** Master Your Appetites
*** "Mastering one's appetite is the very foundation of training in self-control." - Musonius Rufus, On Food
** Focus on the Matter at Hand
*** "Every moment concentrate steadily as a citizen and a human being to do what you have before you with perfect and simple dignity, and feeling of affection, and freedom, and justice; and to put aside all else. And you will give yourself peace, if you do every act of your life as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given to you. You see how few the things are that, should you grab hold of them, you can to live a life which flows in quiet, and is like the existence of the gods; for the gods on their part will require nothing more from him who observes these things." - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 2.5
** Habitually Examine Yourself Each Day
*** "Never allow sleep to close your eyelids, after you went to bed, Until you have examined all your actions of the day by your reason. In what have I done wrong? What have I done? What have I omitted that I ought to have done? If in this examination you find that you have done wrong, reprove yourself severely for it; And if you have done any good, rejoice. Practise thoroughly all these things; meditate on them well; you ought to love them with all your heart.It is those that will put you in the way of divine virtue." - The Golden Verses of Pythagoras
** Minimize Your Attack Surface (i.e. Live Simply)
*** "It's not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential." - Bruce Lee
** Ignore Negativity When It Doesn't Benefit You
*** You are sent $86,390 into your bank and someone steals $10, would you be so upset that you would throw away the remaining $86, 380? Of course not. There are 86,390 seconds in one day, and yet when someone robs you of 10 secs with their negativity you sacrifice the remaining 86,380 on them.


* __//Approval Seeking//__:
** Keep Good Company
*** "The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best." – Epictetus
** Emulate and Seek the Approval of Sages (the latter seems contradictory to the rest of Stoicism)
*** "We need to set our affections on some good man and keep him constantly before our eyes, so that we may live as if he were watching us and do everything as if he saw what we were doing." - Seneca, Letters, 65
** Reflective Equilibrium (Seek the Approval of Hypothetical Sages)
*** Put yourself in a Kantian reflective equilibrium courtroom of your own making, pursue what you think is right behind the veil. Train yourself to be virtuous by asking, "What would the virtuous agent do in my position?"
** Seek Your Own Approval
*** "Often I marvel at how men love themselves more than others while at the same time caring more about what others think of them than what they think of themselves." - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations Book XII
*** Praise yourself for the work not the result; challenge creates growth.
*** Own Yourself, Your Actions, Beliefs, etc.
**** "When you have decided that a thing ought to be done, and are doing it, never avoid being seen doing it, though the many shall form an unfavorable opinion about it. For if it is not right to do it, avoid doing the thing; but if it is right, why are you afraid of those who shall find fault wrongly?" - Epictetus, Enchiridion XXXV


* __//Socializing//__:<<ref "1">>
** Be Self-Deprecating
*** "If you learn that someone is speaking ill of you, don’t try to defend yourself against the rumours; respond instead with, ‘Yes, and he doesn’t know the half of it, because he could have said more.'" - Epictetus, Enchiridion XXXIII.9
** Educate by Example
*** "On no occasion call yourself a philosopher, nor talk at large of your principles among the multitude, but act on your principles. For instance, at a banquet do not say how one ought to eat, but eat as you ought." - Epictetus, Enchiridion XLVI
**** i.e. Don't tell unwilling audiences the truth. Wait for them to ask for it because they've watched you.
** Be Silent or Speak Wisely
*** "Let silence be your general rule; or say only what is necessary and in few words. We shall, however, when occasion demands, enter into discourse sparingly, avoiding such common topics as gladiators, horse-races, athletes; and the perpetual talk about food and drink. Above all avoid speaking of persons, either in the way of praise or blame, or comparison." – Epictetus
