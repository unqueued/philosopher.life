"""
[5:26 PM]  h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#Fostering%20Intimacy
[5:40 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Huh. Am I crazy or is there nothing here?
[8:16 PM]  h0p3: Shows up on all my devices.
[8:16 PM]  h0p3: Might be slow to load.
[8:16 PM]  h0p3: It's a ~33MB document at this point.
[8:17 PM]  h0p3: Hope your raiding goes well
[11:12 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I FIGURED IT OUT
[11:12 PM]  h0p3: u da man
[11:12 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: It works on anything but my fracking phone hahaha
[11:12 PM]  h0p3: ah, yeah, my phone takes fucking forever to load it, and it's slow as shit
[11:13 PM]  h0p3: I don't use it on my phone except in emergencies
[11:13 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I will read through this tomorrow now that I figured it out. Thank you for sharing with me. :slight_smile: and raids went well overall!
[11:13 PM]  h0p3: (your wiki will not have this problem; mine is the size of ~60+ 100k word novels in length)
[11:13 PM]  h0p3: Yay. fat lootz?
[11:13 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Yeah hahaha
[11:13 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: We uh....
[11:13 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Didn’t clear
[11:14 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: But we saw a 2% enrage with deaths.
[11:14 PM]  h0p3: Ouch
[11:26 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: We will clear it Saturday for sure. Making one last run before the next patch.
[11:26 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: How did work go today?
[11:26 PM]  h0p3: Work with offspring and the car today. Wiki tonight.
[11:27 PM]  h0p3: It was fine.
[11:27 PM]  h0p3: I enjoyed my walk with [[k0sh3k]] a ton.

[2:57 PM]  h0p3: So what are your plans for the weekend?
[3:11 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: We’re gonna try that raid one more time and have two dnd sessions back to back Sunday. Other than that, gonna do some lore outlining. :slight_smile:
[3:11 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: How are you today?
[3:11 PM]  h0p3: It is a gaming weekend, packed.
[3:11 PM]  h0p3: I'm here. Daughter lying to my face; that sucks.
[3:11 PM]  h0p3: Easier to deal with my son on this front. He's more honest.
[3:11 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Also I just left the doctor, I’m starting anxiety meds tonight and visiting a ear, nose, throat doctor soon.
[3:12 PM]  h0p3: Fuck yeah dude
[3:12 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Awe that indeed sucks. :/
[3:12 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Is it over something benign?
[3:13 PM]  h0p3: No. It's about her actually doing her work, making progress on projects and her life, waking up and winning the morning. Have her walk me through what she has accomplished after hugs, and she was just lying the entire time.
[3:14 PM]  h0p3: I don't think she would lie about something benign with me.
[3:25 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Ah. That sucks even more then. Motivation is key to being able to accomplish goals, especially of importance like this. I can’t speak for [[j3d1h]] personally. Maybe this is that teen angst (TM) but that doesn’t make it disheartening any less for you.
[3:34 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I liked your post too! Reminds me of my experiment last year to some extent. Developing true, healthy relationships is a grand endeavor, but it's ultimately rewarding when you can connect with someone on the same level.
[3:35 PM]  h0p3: Yeah, I agree. It reminds me of that quite a bit too.
[3:36 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: This year has been harder to keep up with thus far. I'm struggling to figure out why. These health issues are sapping my drive for a lot of things, but I'm not convinced yet that it's the sole reason.
[3:36 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: oh that reminds me
[3:36 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: How are you feeling health-wise?
[3:39 PM]  h0p3: It's definitely expensive to maintain the bridges. I think it oscillates (like so many things in life). It can be draining. I still walk through my conversations over the years with people, comment on them, and it's a ton of work. It's part of my art though, so I get to devote more time and energy to it than the average person.
[3:40 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: :slight_smile:
[3:40 PM]  h0p3: Most people don't have as much time to devote to it. As capitalism commodifies even our freetime and leisure time, it's harder and harder for communities to be maintained (let alone build new ones).
[3:41 PM]  h0p3: I'm feeling better. I still have my coughing fits and moments where I need an inhaler (still can't find it).
[3:41 PM]  h0p3: But, I think my meds have helped a ton.
[3:42 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: That's wonderful to hear. The annual bugs aren't fucking around this year. :upside_down:
[3:42 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I'm washing my hands too much-- I'm sure of it.
[3:42 PM]  h0p3: Lol
[3:50 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I finally broke down and bought a good pair of headphones for my desktop too.
[3:51 PM]  h0p3: I also think maintain remote relationships is still a new kind of work. I know correspondence is old AF, but digital identities which are high-bandwidth, throughput, with so many different mediums and tools are new. We didn't evolve to have the primary aspects of our relationship virtualized over these straws we sip.
[3:51 PM]  h0p3: Noice.
[3:51 PM]  h0p3: What did you get?
[3:51 PM]  h0p3: (I ended up getting a mic for mine)
[3:51 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: It's true haha.
[3:51 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: NICE
[3:52 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Firstly, here's the set I've used since 2012 :eyes:

[3:52 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Here's what's arriving today: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXE0FKC?ref=ppx_pt2_dt_b_prod_image
[3:52 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: What kind of mic did you go for?
[3:53 PM]  h0p3: Snappy
[3:53 PM]  h0p3: Wireless should be nice. Let you walk around and still participate.
[3:54 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I spend so much time snagging laundry, making food, using that bathroom (with the mic muted), wireless was pretty much required haha
[3:55 PM]  h0p3: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DK89QZS/
[3:55 PM]  h0p3: When I'm talking with people, I strongly prefer to walk as I do it.
[3:56 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Let me know when you start your ASMR channel. :smile:
[3:56 PM]  h0p3: lol
[3:56 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: This is snazzy
[3:56 PM]  h0p3: It's nice and clear too, sits well while I'm typing. Getting used to push-to-talk again. Been a decade or so since it really mattered to me.
[3:57 PM]  h0p3: That way my offspring can be in their room, and we don't have to yell across the house to talk.
[4:08 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Discord is such a powerful tool
[4:24 PM]  h0p3: Aye. We used qTox to VC when I was at school for pipefitting (and they had to stay home alone while being so young). qTox doesn't have push-to-talk though. It's noice.
[4:25 PM]  h0p3: Unfortunately, I feel like it's necessary on Discord. Noise cancelation does not function well enough on this tool, and I seem to get better results on push-to-talk. Have had to ask several raiders on Project: Ascension to switch over to it as well cause it was polluting the channel something awful.
[4:35 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Yeah I feel that too. I’ve never pushed to talk before but [[L]] brings it up from time to time.
