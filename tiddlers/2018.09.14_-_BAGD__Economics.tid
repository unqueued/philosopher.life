title: 2018.09.14 - BAGD: Economics

My son interrupted me to say he felt like he better understood what inflation meant (why did it cross his mind?). He walked me through some examples of why adding money to an economy would cause inflation, talked about buying power, explained why saving during inflation is a problem. We talked about the incentives inflation and deflation causes, how it relates to employment, and why the US loves to takes loans out in its own currency. For a poor 10 year old, he's onto something. What the fuck was I doing at 10? 

I keep trying to find books for him at his level. Deepreading is hard here. He has so much variance in his abilities. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a college class with him, and then sometimes he's as inarticulate as a 4 year old. Is he an autistic savant? How can I be a good teacher here? What are the right paths to help this boy become the best version of him he can be? I cannot model my own son. =( I keep throwing shit at the wall like a monkey trying to see what sticks. 

Perhaps we need to change his curriculum. I am convinced he needs a profound background in statistics and calculus to cut through the failures in modeling (don't be scared, homie). Financial literacy is something I lack too! I can't see how these complex financial instruments piece together nearly well enough. How can I give advice? We talked about what it means for there to be different schools of economics, but I think I failed to demonstrate it well enough. I can give him the humanities. I am a fucking razor against utilitarians; I'll slice and dice 'em all day. I can give him the philosophical foundations which I find economists lack. Maybe that will be his dark horse strength?

How can I help a boy who will quickly know more than I do? I have this problem with my daughter. I'm so profoundly unqualified to teach them what they deserve.

I also think computer literacy is something that will always benefit him. I can give him a sick base. Wouldn't every 18 year old economics major benefit from being a strongly exposed to R, Python, and relational databases from the get go? Hyperreading has been extremely valuable to the boy! We must shape his curation practices, his notetaking, his exploration.

We talked about the fact that his political and economic views would do him very few favors in economics departments and among many people who hire economists. Still, the boy is talented. I don't care if nobody values this in him. He values it in himself, and so do I.
