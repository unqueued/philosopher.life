!! Why don't you care for karaoke at all?

I think people like karaoke because they like to let go, feel free, ignore judgment, perhaps experience a delusional twisted celebrity moment/dream, and it's somehow a medium of valuable emotional expression to them.

Wtf?

None of those make sense to me. Karaoke is not the right catalyst for me. Don't get me wrong. I will never escape the drug that is music. I am happy to dance and sing to my songs when I can. I'm not shy in most cases. I've done tons of public speaking, and I've plenty of music performance in front of others. I know I'm a bad singer, but that doesn't matter for karaoke. 

Maybe I don't feel comfortable. It just doesn't strike me as interesting. You know what I want to do with others? Escape them.
