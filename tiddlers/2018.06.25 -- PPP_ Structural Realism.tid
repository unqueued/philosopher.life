title: 2018.06.25 -- PPP: Structural Realism

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/

<<<
Scientific realism is the view that we ought to believe in the unobservable entities posited by our most successful scientific theories.
<<<

To me, this is the same thing as agreeing to inductive empiricism as a faith (Hume, KYS). I'm totally cool with that. Of course, this is dressed up with higher probabilities and Bayesian reasoning we might not see in plenty of empirical inferences. How you draw the line is a non-trivial issue.

<<<
meta-induction, according to which reflection on the abandonment of theories in the history of science motivates the expectation that our best current scientific theories will themselves be abandoned
<<<

If you think Knowledge has more to do with contextual justification than holding a true belief, this isn't a problem. For me, justification is the best I can hope for. As far as I'm concerned, you can never have anything else. Imho, even the Scientist must take themselves to be engaged in this by sticking to maximally empirical reasoning (after they help themselves to some truly necessary axioms). 

<<<
Rather, we should adopt structural realism and epistemically commit ourselves only to the mathematical or structural content of our theories
<<<

Umm...can you be more specific? How is this any different than making tentative commitments about the future, the nature of reality, about everything else? How is this really any different from scientific realism? This doesn't avoid meta-induction.

What do you mean by "the claim that the theory's structure, over and above its empirical content, describes the world?" Why do you think structural realism avoids this. Mind you, as an autist, I somehow fail with models super hard.

Perhaps my problem here is my strong intuitions about representationalism, correspondence, and other fundamental commitments in philosophy. I'm probably "begging the question" ridiculously hard. Forgive me, philosophers of science. I am a pig to you.

This caused me to give my chillun a lecture about my epistemology: externalist, contextualist, and anti-luck. We walked through the options briefly. My son raced ahead of me and asked a question about the coherentist's lack of a justificatory standard for their standard of coherence. That boy saw far ahead. We've talked about the ghettier problem quite a bit, so this wasn't too hard.
