** Mwhahaha.
*[[2020/02/26 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: Humane]]
** Doesn't sound stupid to me. I wish I knew more people who believed that.
*[[2020/02/26 -- Prompted Introspection: Bad Manners]]
** I can hear you say //matters// very clearly in my head.
*[[2020/02/26 -- Life Log]]
** Days have been blurry for me too here. We're throwing down, and it's emotionally expensive. I'm glad we are doing it. 
*** It's a good thing we keep written records too. =)
*[[2020/02/26 -- Wiki Log]]
** :P...I appreciate this processing of the mess. Sometimes, it's just going to be one clusterfuck whirlwind. I'm sorry.
*** You can admit that you are getting better at these processes, right? 
** Why didn't you like your work on 2019/02/25 as much as me?
** Yeah. I am an asshole. =). Thank you for being honest.
*** Pre-emptively: yeah, yeah I know you know I know you know I know I'm an asshole.

** I feel your pain. My [[TDL]]s are similar. We'll keep trying, eh?
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[2017/02/27]] stands out. I like how you've made significant progress from that point too. I know that writing this much, at this pace, is crazy expensive. I hope to make it like breathing for you, especially in times where you will be crunched or stretched. Grace under fire.
*** I can't predict what my own wiki will look like a decade from now (and who could, if they were trying?). I'm even less confident in my ability to project yours. Turn it up to 80% and keep it pegged. Run with it. The learning curve is so steep, I'm not convinced it ends.
** I appreciate that you know when you've failed to find evidence or arguments which are sufficient or satisfactory for a context. You have a high standard there too. It will be worth your evaluation many times over.
** I can see I made a mistake in experimenting with the 100 Math Breakthroughs book. I don't think you found it interesting enough here, understandably.
*** I'm hoping you will find the style we're using now to be more effective.
