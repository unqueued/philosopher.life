title: 2018.03.14 - Retired: The Categorical Imperative

//This is my metamodern faith interpretation. Fear and hate the heathen disciple; I am aware of the sheer audacity, futility, and unoriginality of my claims. I apologize for having an unfashionably old-fashioned black-and-white all-or-nothing opinion, but Reason compels me. I sincerely appreciate postmodern criticisms from Continental, Analytic, and Eastern traditions, but I see the practical necessity of putting down our tentpegs in reconstruction. I am forever indebted to the philosophers before me.<<ref "pb">> Here I preach the gospel conjecture of [[h0p3]] and part the postmodern waters with my Staff of Reason to behold the mystical groundwork once again. I do not know if I should call this page [[The Good]] or [[The Categorical Imperative]].//

Axioms:

* [[The Good]] and Being are not identical.
* Symbiotically, [[The Good]] provides meaning to Being, and Being provides existence to [[The Good]].
* [[The Good]] is true and obtains in all possible worlds, i.e. it's necessary.
** However, that is not the claim that all aspects of Being are necessary. For example, contingent truths may be possible. We are in no position to deny or confirm with certainty.

The Categorical Imperative (CI) is //the// joint final telos of ontology and epistemology; it is the transcendent transcendental encoding bridge between minds and reality. The CI is the end of all ends; it is the sole source and law of all normativity. The CI is the necessary and sufficient criterion of value and meaning, the Precise of Measurement, The Holy Grail, The Grandest Metanarrative which rules them all, the inescapable reality striator and stratifier, the //Truth// with a capital //T//, //Rationality// with a capital //R//, The One, and The Way; it is the self-evident //alpha// first principle/mover epistemic big bang and unified //omega// final telic meaning singularity. The CI is the self-computing, self-normifying normative force of existence.

The CI is that great mythical metaphysical computer in the heavens, the one which brings meaning to everything. That which is not reducible to superposition in physics must be explained. It is the meaning of which consciousness can understand, the pattern that emerges from structures built on top of quantum randomness. Only that which is determined can we make determinations about. Randomness is the goal of entropy, and ordered meaning the goal of consciousness. In this space of faith and doubt, I am willing to take into account the external world skeptic's point of view, 

Nothing is actually normative outside the CI by definition. It is that metaphysically incarnate concept of which there is none greater because it is that perfection which defines perfection and that meaning which gives meaningful meaning to all meanings. The CI recursively and circularly defines, explains, justifies, and partakes of itself. It is the transcendent externally coherent foundation of objective normativity. In other words, the CI is the unified standard of [[The Good]] subsuming even the possibility of [[The Beautiful]] and [[The Right]]. 

The CI is the fundamental intrinsic value from which all other values and hierarchies of meaning emerge, the standalone Reason from which all other reasonable reasons emerge, and (if any) the duty from which all other duties emerge. It is the sound and complete metaphysical code of totality which perfectly imbues and translates all essential meaning. The CI is the priceless gem of //wisdom// which provides closure to the "is/ought" distinction. The CI presents us the only existential game which matters or can matter by definition.

Meaning obtains and is intelligible only through the analogical light the CI shines upon the world around us. It is entailed by even the possibility of understanding meaning, value, purpose, or any normativity at all. Even these very words are only intelligible to you because of the CI. Whether you are aware of it or not, you beg the question of the CI in even getting out of bed in the morning. 

As with all fallible and finite minds, we are limited to perceiving and experiencing but a fleeting shadow of reality, and that we do at all is due entirely to our ability to at least partially implement and bind ourselves to the CI. We can only understand and partake of what is objectively relevant about reality insofar as we are constituted with the CI. 

Ontologically, the CI computationally generates the manifold lattice overlay grid through which normative meaning supervenes upon reality. Epistemically, the CI is the lens through which the ideally-ideal virtuous perception picks out what is salient in the matrix of reality. Utimately, only the CI bestows meaning that matters. In all possible worlds, there is no CI //iff// normative anti-realism obtains. Nothing ultimately matters if the CI isn't true or doesn't obtain.

To be clear, conditional concepts can store hypothetical normative content,<<ref "hi">> but the CI is the only concept which stores and emits absolute normative meaning. Hypothetical imperatives are never ends in themselves; they only (timelessly) become categoricalized in a context via the CI. The normativity of the conditional embedded in the hypothetical (e.g. P->Q) can only have real value in virtue of the CI. We can say X is //good for// Y, but even the standard of the good of a thing obtains only in virtue of being good qua the CI. Essentially, only the CI is //good in itself//, and all other good is subservient to, illuminated by, emergent from, and parasitic upon it.

The CI is the unified, infinitely particularized and generalized, universal, absolute, unconditional, necessary, immutable, transcendent, logical truth. The CI is true in virtue of itself and nothing else. There are no possible worlds in which this proposition is not true, and thus it is semantically equivalent to all other logical truths (in fact, it houses them all, possibly including itself in infinite orders). 

The CI defies simulacra because it defines simulacra. Thus, the CI is neither an anthropocentrically constructed object nor an anthropomorphized God. In our pursuit of understanding, use, and partaking of the CI, we innately employ and plastically reconstruct epistemic shadows of it for ourselves. Unfortunately, as our empiricism shows, we are often wrong about these shadows and their causes. Crucially, a law which is constructed by something outside itself cannot be universally normative. What would be the normative standards for the construction of the CI besides itself? The CI is external to everything except Being itself. 

Furthermore, constructions imply a time when they were not constructed and perhaps the possibility of not having been constructed. Constructed truths are contingent truths; logical truths, however, are necessary by definition. We do not construct logical truths because they were true before we could have constructed them; logical truths are never contingent by definition. Logical truths are immutable and necessary because they are true in all possible universes, even those worlds without beings to recognize their truth. Thus, like its subset, mathematics, the CI is external to us. Hence, the ultimate concept of the CI is discovered, but not invented.<<ref "1">> Theories of solely constructed and contingent normativity pursue counterfeit idols. What makes something truly normative cannot be in virtue of my wanting, choosing, believing, attending to, or recognizing its normativity (what arrogant madness to think I am responsible for it!); it obtains and is normative regardless of my cognition or existence.

Insofar as logical truths are constructed, they only construct themselves. We can only speculate here. Mathematics might be said to construct itself through deduction (because it just might be deduction itself), even though all its logical truths imply each other simultaneously. The CI as a whole may construct or deduce itself in a similar sense. Any appearance of a sequential construction of the CI is merely an epistemic path for we mortals to walk in discovery, however, the timeless transcendent path was always there. Since we never have access to the thing in itself, we only have access to subjective constructs of the objective CI. 

At its conceptual core, the CI is the universal moral algorithm, the unambiguous specification of how to interpret the complete class of moral requirements and meaning. In this sense, the CI is a methodology for experiencing, perceiving, and understanding morality. Only by computing and using the CI algorithm as the end of ends in itself is it possible for us to intend and act morally, i.e. to be moral. The CI is a complex proposition comprised of a unified algorithm of all normative algorithms, an associative array mapping all possible inputs with their corresponding normative outputs. It is the universal moral computer.

The nature of the CI's infinities are beyond what any finite mind can compute. Ultimately, I am not sure what it means to say the CI computes itself, nor am I convinced the algorithm ever halts. I suggest we need not worry about an infinigress in this case. The ideally-ideal may very well infinigress, and that the CI is the only computer which can compute itself in whatever sense and degree it can does not eliminate its normativity to us for all practical intents and purposes. While we may not be able to conceive of the CI's transcendence (indeed, with humble ignorance and vexation, I suggest that if hypothetically the CI were to have a ray of intentionality, it could not concieve of its own transcendence likely due to incompleteness problems), it is clear that it provides us what we need: the practically-ideal, that which is fitting for our finite contexts.

Thus far, I have only spoken of the computational structure and nature of the CI, but not satisfactorily pointed out its contents. Like all good philosophers in the Kantian lineage, it is here that I arrogantly take up that old article of faith: the second greatest commandment which emerges from the authority of the first. The initial content kernel of the CI is simple: do unto others as you would have them do unto you (where "do" here includes motivational content). The golden rule is the essence of categorical computation; ideal empathy, not making yourself an exception regarding others, is the spirit of the law.<<ref "2">> The CI is exceptionless (as its name implies); thus, you should not make an exception of yourself. That which is exceptionless just is constitutive of the CI. Insofar as we do not make exceptions of ourselves, especially through correctly empathizing with both ourselves and The Other, we are effectively constituting ourselves with and partaking of the CI. Thus, one core task for we mortals is to uncover the principles of picking out appropriate theoretical and practical empathy in each context.

Of course, germinating and fleshing out the contents of this kernel is an exponential task. Unfortunately, this algorithm is not as simple as one might hope. In coming to grips with the application of the golden rule, you will find it particularizes to the N^^th^^ degree. The codification of the particularistic contents of the infinite set of all morals truths (which includes all possible contexts and their corresponding moral laws) are embedded as functions inside the CI algorithm, i.e. the CI contains the judgement of the content of all possible maxims. All moral truths are coextantly true because the CI is true in the same way that all mathematical truths are coextantly true. Thus, the contents of all moral laws are not merely the product of the CI, but in fact are functionally constitutive of the CI.

We finite rule-followers can only hope to find the best heuristic implementation of the CI; to construct and employ the best version of it we can conceive. The instantiations of the CI in our brains are constructions; they are but poor shadows of the form of the CI. We cannot escape subjectivity, especially since we cannot peer through the threshold of the noumenal gateway. You can't stare into the sun, but you can see its reflecting light everywhere. Essentially, a dumbed-down version of CI constitutes your perception-capacities which enable you to see the normative reflection properties in the concrete and abstract objects in and around you. For each given time-slice scope, we cannot be perfectly Rational, ideally-ideal, but we can attain a semblance of it, where the ideally-practical and practically-ideal meet. We are fallible, but not hopeless. It is our goal to reach for the limits of practical perfection in our own fallible implementations and unique circumstances. 

Since we are finite creatures and "ought implies can," we cannot be held accountable to implementing the complete CI because it requires infinite computation. The CI, however, generates a subset of itself targeting the finite architectures and contextual particularities of each of our minds. Essentially, there is always a uniquely fitting implementation of the CI for every creature because the CI contextualizes itself. Perfect infinite theoretical wisdom must reduce itself to the fitting finite practical wisdom for mere mortals. It wouldn't be //the// ideally-ideal moral law unless it could computationally interpret itself into a practiceable law for each possible context. Thus, what is directly relevant about the CI for each individual scales to our specific computational capacities and other contextual circumstances.

Through the process of reflective equilibrium, we can only hope to grow objectively less wrong each day. Excepting a few possible corner cases, proper implementations of the CI will generally include a normative learning sequence for improving our versions of it. Essentially, effective subjective implementations of the objective CI are genetic algorithms in our minds which mutate and optimize. The nature and demands of the objective CI are progressively revealed to us as we metacognitively study and bind ourselves with it. When performed correctly, through the oscillation of positive disintegration in the Dialectic, we grow closer to the Truth itself each cycle. The application of our continually developing understanding of the CI is how we morally "level up" as persons (the telos of Dasein).

While mathematics and the CI are true regardless of our recognition of them, there are worthy differences to recognize. First, the CI is a superset of mathematics. All forms of reasonable reasoning, including deduction, are constitutive of the CI. Unlike mathematics, however, one cannot understand the CI from deduction alone. Ultimately, because the CI is Reason incarnate, the reason to embrace the CI can only be emitted from the CI itself.

We do not give ourselves this reason, we only accept it through. Indeed, deductive, inductive, abductive, prudential and alethic justifications may be necessary for us to accept the CI, but it appears insufficient. Crucially, the CI as a whole is something in which we can only have faith. There is no evidence for it beyond our subjective intuitions and the coherence it provides our perceptions and identities. Essentially, we can never be certain of it, and yet, it certainly must serve as our core axiom. It transcends us, and therefore we finite and fallible creatures ultimately only have shadows to work with. 

The CI is our plight, but interestingly we can attempt to constitute ourselves without it (poorly and quite inconsistently). Mathematics binds us without our consent, but the CI does not. I can cut off one of my arms, and I will only have one left; the math cannot be avoided. The fact that I ought not cut off my arm does not prevent me from doing so. Distinctively, the bindingness of the CI is contingent, even though its normativity is not.

We are all subject to the moral law even if we do not bind ourselves to it. You are cosmically judged by it whether you follow it or not.<<ref "3">> The only good form of self-legislation is that which is ordained by the CI. Either being constituted by or constituting yourself with the CI axiom is profoundly rational.

Like the CI, our freedom is an article of faith. Is it valuable to have this faith, and is it valuable to have this freedom? Only the CI can tell us. Of course, the degree to which we are free is the degree to which there is [[The Right]] for us because "ought implies can." Thus, if we are not free, there is [[The Good]] but not [[The Right]] for us. Even if we cannot say "you should pursue X," the CI may still make hypothetical freedom sufficiently meaningful to say "if you could choose to pursue X, then you should." 

There is the good of following the contextualized CI implementation and the good of following the CI implementation for ideal agents. The ideal is better by definition. In the same way that we are finite creatures who cannot implement the ideal CI itself and thus are not ethically accountable to that standard, if somehow we magically gained the ability to choose to instantiate the ideal CI, then we ought.

We can still speak of the normative without freedom, but we neither praise nor blame an agent without it. We can only rejoice when [[The Good]] obtains and be saddened when it does not. Thus, the conceptual possibility of freedom is not necessary for the existence of the CI, although it would be sufficient (but, this is vacuously true, since logical truths are the logical consequences of any set of assumptions, including the empty set). Freewill is necessary for [[The Right]] to have direct normative meaning in our lives, but I cannot establish that we are free. 

My warning, of course, is that I've provided no actual normative content beyond demonstrating that there is normative content. I've explained the stoop off extending from the transcendent threshold, but nothing more. Clearly, I must rely upon all the tools in my arsenal to come up with the best answer I can, and so should you.

We input a {[[Maxim]]} variable into the CI functional computer and receive an output tuplet variable. 

The complete {[[Maxim]]} is composed of the context. The resulting output gives us a score of the value contains is composed of three parts:

* Context
* Act

of whether or not we are permitted or obligated to use that maxim. 



The output will always be exactly one of these:

* Required
* Permitted
* Unpermitted

A complex object which includes the [act, context, intention  and are given a tuplet output



Autonomy may be an irrelevant question. It may just be a matter of faith. 

You have two choices to make. Do you believe in the CI? If you don't, then do whatever you want to do. Do not be idle (unless you want to, of course). Second, assuming you do believe, will you bind yourself with the CI? If not, then do you really believe in the CI? True faith exhibits little or no space between doxa and praxis.


We are not ends in ourselves. We are secondary ends, ends before the end of ends. We have dignity in virtue of the CI. 

The best way to value and respect your own dignity is to recognize how you fit into the world and to respect the dignity of others. To see The Other as an end in themselves qua the CI as the end of ends



There is a terrible beauty and truth to the madness of effective evil persons. Evil unity is possible only because it takes the CI constitution and corrupts it. 


We have no reason to believe the CI is a personal God or a God at all. It's not that which merits worship. It has no feelings, opinions, beliefs, etc. It is just a computer computing itself and the world.

For those who have been burned by metaphysics before, I suggest a few underappreciated stoic rationalization balms to quell and reframe your allergies to faith. 

# Since universizable necessity is obviously better than localized contingency, to point at a mere construct would be to point to an object less perfect than the CI.
# As a practical matter in the trascendental nature of our epistemology, while just because you inescapably beg the question of the CI at the core of your inferentialism does not entail your assumption is a proof for others, it does, however, entail it for you. You don't have a choice in the matter. Essentially, you might as well make do with the axiom of Reason embedded in your reason because there's no reasonable point to arguing otherwise.
# The argument against the objectivity of the [[The Good]] is not only contradictory, but it's also //ad hoc// in the same way that denying the existence of the external world is ad hoc. Skepticism serves to help us understand the limits of knowledge. The appearance of the possibility of denial, however, doesn't make it a //good// argument against what it brackets. While you may never achieve certainty, you're being irrational to deny the objectivity of Reason, the externality of [[The Good]].
