title: 2018.01.10 - Retired: Berea

After moving to Tennessee, while cleaning out my books and notebooks, I actually threw away my college work. My college work sucks. Seriously, I had an awful primary and secondary education. It was a miracle I learned anything living in Kentucky as a boy. 

I first attended Elizabethtown Community College (renamed to ECTCS a long time ago), and there I actually read books that mattered and developed my writing voice.<<ref "1">> However immature that voice was (and still is), better late than never. I've never really learned to write extremely well (except for a few technical things), but my lack of skill and knowledge shows very strongly in my work at Berea. That's okay. The college transformation takes time to digest.

Unfortunately, I did not keep copies of everything I wrote at Berea. I literally only have a single semester saved now (my second to last semester).

I made a lot of mistakes at Berea, as you can see in the above work, but I also made some incredibly wise choices as well. I met and married my wife at Berea, for which I will be forever grateful. I also studied philosophy which eventually enabled me to rationally escape the faith I was brainwashed to have. 

As you will see, I've found the opiate of religion to be an incredibly addictive meme over the years. Like billions of homo sapiens in human history, the Great Abrahamic Meme was deeply rooted in me, and it has take monumental effort to deracinate it.<<ref "2">> The power of gnosticism and confabulation coupled with a search for meaning (of my past and life in general) kept me imprisoned for a long time.

I look back on these works, and I see why I took the path I did. I feel like I've been a man of incredible integrity. Others do not see it that way, but they really have never stood in my shoes and seen my life through my eyes.

<<footnotes "2" "I'm still unbrainwashing myself. It's a process. I still have [[Residual Christianity]] which lingers to this day and a web of inferences that I've not retested effectively enough since my deconversion. It takes years to deconvert, especially for someone who found as much reason as he possibly could for his faith.">>
