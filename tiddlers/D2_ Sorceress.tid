title: D2: Sorceress

I have tested a lot of variations. My sorceress probably more access to "complete" gearsets than any of my other characters. I basically lack HOTO, Infinity, and skill-charms. I am still convinced that Frozen Orb is better than Blizzard. When you want to farm a particular area, you should use the right tool for the job. The sorc is excellent, and in many cases, the best (particularly if you have no Enigma). Frozen Orb controls the screen, scales well enough in hell mode to take down bosses, and mixes well with static.

There is a big difference between my first usage of Orb when the game came and out and now. I now have a much better understanding of the optimal distance my character should be from my enemy before I cast. There is a sweetspot where Orb does at least double (if not triple) damage you would otherwise achieve. Here Orb actually surpasses any other cold skill for damage.

Core:

* 20 Frozen Orb
* 1 Cold Mastery
** Oh, look, you can now control and kill half of Hell mode with ~25 skill points and minimal gear.
* 20 Firebolt
* 20 Meteor
* 20 Fireball
** Your real damage, weave it between Orbs 
* 1 Fire Mastery
* 1 Teleport
** The reason you play a sorc in the first place.

Utility (completed at lvl 93):

* 1 Warmth
** For those cornercases and convenience
* 1 Enchant
** Even if only for AR, worth it. Empower your merc!
* 1 Hydra
** Baal Runs and "Cornercases" (ha!)
* 1 Thunderstorm
** For Fire+Cold Immunes, speeds up your merc. 
** Also, Static!
* 1 Lightning Mastery
** Thunderstorm multiplier.
* 1 Energy Shield
** I do not understand people who don't take this. It is the single strongest survivability tool in the game. You can always chug potions, but with Insight and Warmth, you can't even spend your mana.
* 1 Frozen Armor
** Only a fool passes this up. Zero prereqs, 1 skill point, and with easy to acquire gear, you get 100% defense and .7 seconds of freeze (after the 1/4 Hell mode calculation) against melee attacks. That's straight fucking amazing. It is a 1-point wonder, giving you ~10% damage avoidance + .7 second stun against all melee attackers. Most classes would KILL for that. I think only Energy Shield, Fade, and Holy Shield are stronger defensive skills, it's that strong.
