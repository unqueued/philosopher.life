** What did you fix about your IP?
** Key problem of what?
*** Did you keep the instructions and explanation? Don't you think this might happen again? Did you try to figure out what happened in the first place? It might help to describe the problem and solution more thoroughly.

** Edit away. Consider it like a magic deck. That ~~config~~ deck is tuned. It might not be great, but it works. Learn to play that magic deck before trying to make your own. Maybe learn several decks and strategies before venturing deeply into making your own. I agree you need to make your own to be good at magic in many cases. 
*** You must have a working machine. It may help to find ways to test and revert, or test in a sandbox.
** u-w-u
** Roflmao. "This is shhhhhort." 
** =(. I'm sorry you miss them. Maybe the neighbor boy could be a new friend, eh? Seems like a cool kid (even if he isn't very talkative atm).
*** Yeah, you may have to carry the conversation. That's okay.
** I think your opinions change all the time, btw. It's obvious to me that you are radically open and that you have changed many times.
*** Oh, I see. Okay. Makes sense.
** You are allowed to call it a piece of shit if you are going to be reconstructive with that belief/desire [[irwartfrr]]. 
*** Sometimes, that's exactly what you have to call it. I appreciate your willingness to say it.
*** Let's be clear though, that is still better than where you started, right? Let's think about the forest or the mountain range here for a second. Pull back and out. Your practice is paying off.

** Whoa, step back here: you daydream constantly. It's arguably your favorite thing to do. Surely, at least some of those times have been objectively important. Your question still stands, but I hope it's on the assumption that dreams are important (even if we don't understand them, or don't understand how or why).
** I'm pretty doubtful in this space too. I appreciate caution. I do not know how to strike the right balance myself.

** This school week has been intense, hasn't it? It's been hard in some places. I'm glad we are doing it.

** You have many dots to connect here. There's leaps you can't predict (or expect) most people to make in here. I appreciate that you got your opinion down. I see a structure, and it's even more fit than you articulated. Drafting this again, asking yourself how someone else is going to see and interpret it would be valuable practice. 
** There's really good work in here. And, you are wrestling with a grandmaster. I know he would have enjoyed your analysis, sir. 
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I'm glad you are picking up these tools. It's hard work, sir. Thank you.
