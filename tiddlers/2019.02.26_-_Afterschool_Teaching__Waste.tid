title: 2019.02.26 - Afterschool Teaching: Waste

I got all the setup done myself today. Cool.

Whitney and I discussed exploitation and slavery. She walked me through parts of her previous job and asked questions. I tried to explain what I thought was happening. She might not be bright, but she pays attention. If she does her best, I'll do mine. 

Whitney hates to read.<<ref "2020.02.27-1">> I know the feel. We talked about that as well.

I'm playing crowd control more than usual today. Whitney thinks it's a mistake to allow the kids to get ice. They clearly just aim to wander. 

Whitney asked me to take 6-8 so she could have the 5th alone. Cool. That is not a problem.

They were monsters today. I ended up telling 6AB to stop being annoying (I hurt his feelings). 7Jf sat with me because he was so disruptive. 6JK only wanted to talk about puberty. Most were just rude today. 

We had an attempt at talking about what we might do together. I don't have students who want to learn. This is where useful peer pressure exists: punish peers who are clearly detracting from the rights of other students to learn. You have to have a sufficient number of students punish the others to be effective at all. [[T42T]] decentralization is required.

I am, of course, not charismatic in a way they find appealing. Aristotle is correct about moral education. I can't do this myself.<<ref "2020.02.27-2">>

Some kids said they wanted to code, but they aren't interested in anything besides hacking games. One person wanted to learn a foreign language, and another poetry. I talked to them about books in the library on their subjects. They don't mean it.

I can appreciate not having attention spans or belief that anything they learn will be applicable or valuable to their unknown futures. It is a [[hope]]less place today.

How do I convince people that learning actually matters? I can't make up for shit parenting. I can't make up for the fact that so many teachers themselves just don't care about learning. This place is a prison. It's tragic.

Even Dorsey's whiteboards are filled with garbage. This is on the whiteboard:

Dorsey has Breitbart listed as an authoritative news source on the board too. 

Even though they might not realize it, most of these people are enemies of each others' minds. They really don't give a shit. I can't believe I was allowed to experience this myself growing up; my own donors were terrible fucking parents too. 

I keep coming back to my old rule: there will be 1 or 2 student lives in which I can make a measurable difference. That has been true. 

My namesake hugged me today. Bless her heart. She is an easy person to work with. Oh, she ain't perfect, but she does try hard. What more could I ask?

I must be doing something wrong, right? The difference between my children and these is hard to fathom. [[j3d1h]] got high praise from yet another English professor. People give books to my children after speaking with them. 

This isn't fair. I'm fucking sick to my stomach for these kids. People don't want to even consider the possibility that this could be radically different; they don't want to realize just how profoundly responsible they are for the mindraping these children receive. I can try to talk about it with the other teachers, but even they don't have enough education to see how far this goes. =(

Am I just a witness of the crimes against the [[Humanity]] in these children? I feel powerless to help the powerless. Ugh. I am drowning over here.<<ref "2020.02.27-3">>
