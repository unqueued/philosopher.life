We spoke. More about you. He identified that he did, not feel, after reading your wiki, that he was a good step dad to his step son. The next day he sent me a picture of him buying him a guitar. (guitars and music is where we bond)

This gentleman is a parole officer for juveniles. He does try to make a impact. He has a good heart. But he can bet an arrogant fuck.

Comparing me to Saint Aristotle is a compliment beyond my dreams. I can only hope to live up to such a thing. I'm touched by your compliment too: "He is...A fucking animal. In conversation. Like, if he doesn't like you. He will eat you alive." ROFL!
