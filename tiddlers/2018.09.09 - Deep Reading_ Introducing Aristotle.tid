title: 2018.09.09 - Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

Good to point out where Aristotle was wrong in his scientific conclusions and lack of explicit experimental methodology. I suggest, however, that he could not have understood what he did about the natural world without already have really been implementing some decent methods. If you are still arguing with Aristotle thousands of years later, it's more than just paying your dues. 

What a shit fucking argument about his ether. It still defines metaphysics for me today. Be Straussianly Charitable brethren, and you will see this man was visionary. You have not even tried to see it! You cartoonify, lampoon, and strawman. This is insane, people. Pretend Aristotle stood in your shoes with your knowledge, how would he evolve his argument if he could? It's obvious there are profound routes for him. LOOK!
