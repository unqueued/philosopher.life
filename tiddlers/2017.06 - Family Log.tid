!! Audit:

* Everquest, finding a job, and getting the kids to do their work were major movements and difficulties this month for us.
* Allergies were flaring up again.
* The compliments section was wonderful and useful to us.
* We've been looking forward to these more often.
* Having visitors and significant shifts in our schedules really makes this difficult. I hope, in time, we become more flexible and adept at this.
* This will more even more difficult to do as I travel, I assume. It's important that we do it well.
