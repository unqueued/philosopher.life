** Thank you for thinking about this with me. I know it is expensive.

** It's interesting to see the differences between what someone is willing to say in person vs in writing. They both often have a lot of weight to them when performed correctly. 
** Putting our thoughts into words down into writing, with this persistent accessibility, is quite a commitment. Thank goodness for contextualism.
*** I hope you become an absolute monster here. Perhaps find the better ways to read books like your mother and read the web like I do. Practice, practice, practice, practice. Read code all day, errday. I think you are a human coder.  
**** When's the last time I asked you this question?

** You keep picking out quotes directly concerned with philosophy. Super happy to do it, but it's okay for you to pick other things too. It is probably the place where I can help you the most though. 
*** It's crucial for you to see that topic selection and picking it out must be something you do.
** Preach, yo!

** ~~Ditto.~~
** This is fairly brief. You might try to pick more things out. Anything stand out? Was there something which made you laugh or joyful, a blessing to point out?

** ~~Ruh Roh, Yogi.~~
** Yeah, really. =)
*** You are correct.
** You "want to want."
** It's true: you should be diving in head first into your things, including a language. 
*** I desperately want to know what you want, and why. Let's think.
** Lol, are they really all asshats? 
*** I am an asshat, no doubt.

** My stomach turns inside and out for you. I wish I knew how to do this better. You are doing a good job talking to yourself in this space. Sorry I don't have any more tools for you at some point. You are as lost as I am.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I'm trippin' through time as I read these. 
*** Once I'm back on the horse, maybe I'll be in a position to see our timelines merge. To see our days side-by-side together better.
** Your 2019 work was solid. I hope to grow how much you write.
