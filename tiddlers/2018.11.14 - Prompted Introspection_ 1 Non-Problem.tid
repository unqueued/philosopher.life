!! What's your favorite part of being you?

That's a tough one. Note, of course, that I distinguish love from like, and I like a lot of particular aspects of my life (even if I am not pleased with the sum of who I am, what we are, and what this world is).

I like living in my own head. I like having my family. I like the flexibility and focus of my life in many cases. I feel ridiculously lucky to have had the experiences I've had given where I come from. I like my intensity, perfectionism, and curiosity. I like my penis. I like being able to say whatever I think ought to be said in many contexts. 

Alright, meta-Sunday-School-non-answer:

My favorite part of being me is having so many parts of myself that I like about being me that I can't choose just one.
