title: 2018.09.27 - Carpe Diem: Clean

* Woke at 9:30
** Actually felt well-rested? Wat.
* Laid there just thinking. Brain started hurting, racing and looping, as usual.
* Fireman Time! heals all.
* Got chillun to cleaning
* Read+Write
* Took every book off every shelf, off every table, off the floors, the piano, everywhere. Sorted them again. I took the books I'm convinced we need and put them back on the shelves. My wife has a giant pile for her to sort through. All the knicksknacks have been centralized for sorting as well.
** Please, my love, I'm begging you...we don't read those anymore! We don't use them, and we aren't going to. Pretty please, with a cherry on top.
*** We have all the access we need through our libraries, ILL, and piracy! 
*** Look through our reading lists these past couple years. Let's own up to the facts, mam.
** I'll make it worth your while /wink.<<ref "w">>
* Cleaning the house
* Read+Write
* It started raining insanely hard all at once, and then I realized my wife was likely caught out in it. I ran to the car (soaked within 30 feet), and started rushing to get to her. Still in the parking lot, and she was there. She has a damn good umbrella, and she wasn't soaked. Good! She knew I was coming for her. =)
* She was too tired to fuck or walk. I hear that. She works really hard.
* We laid down and talked for a bit! =)
* We watched a movie: Deadpool 2 (or whatever; does not even merit a search)
** What a giant pile of shit it was too...The biggest fucking money grab. I just went to sleep while watching it instead. The end credit scene had a good joke in it; it was the only time I laughed. My children enjoyed it quite a bit though, so that's nice.
** I'm glad we watched a movie though. It has been a while.
* Chilaquiles + Beer
* C called me; I need to return it. I was too tired to answer.
* Read+Write
* Bed by 11:30 or 1:30? I don't remember which.
