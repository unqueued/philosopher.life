Nov 8, 2019 11:33am
How was yours/ how are you guys?
Nov 8, 2019 11:34am
Fuck yeah, dude.
Nov 8, 2019 11:38am
I assume it is getting too cold for going out on the lake.
Nov 8, 2019 11:38am
Hopefully, you get some time to chill.
Nov 8, 2019 11:39am
I'm afraid so. We have actually planned each day. Wife is off too.
Nov 8, 2019 11:39am
We are doing well. Wife is anxious about the move. Hasn't fully hit me yet.
Nov 8, 2019 11:39am
We are working everyday doing farm chores.
Nov 8, 2019 11:39am
Lots to do then.
Nov 8, 2019 11:40am
Just had 25 ton of gravel delivered this Morning.
Nov 8, 2019 11:40am
Move? Where to now? If you told me and I forgot I apologize. I don't remember as well as I use to.
Nov 8, 2019 11:40am
What will you be doing with it?
Nov 8, 2019 11:40am
Connecticut. Around new years.
Nov 8, 2019 11:41am
Exciting
Nov 8, 2019 11:41am
Looking for a place and thinking about the logistics for now
Nov 8, 2019 11:41am
Gonna be sad to move away from a handful of people, so that is bittersweet
Nov 8, 2019 11:42am
Gonna take my 24x48 old tobacco barn and open up doors for more storage space. Plan to put camper, boat, tractor implements and whatever else I can in there. Build a big sliding door on one side and swing gates on the other. Half of floor is concrete and I need to put more gravel down. Caddy shack needs gravel. Blah.
Nov 8, 2019 11:43am
More about Connecticut. She get a new job up there? I hope new England is a good move for you!
Nov 8, 2019 11:44am
That makes sense. Cool.
Nov 8, 2019 11:44am
That is a lot of gravel. I assume your tractor will be put to good use.
Nov 8, 2019 11:50am
Aye. She got a job at Yale.
Nov 8, 2019 11:50am
Fuck yeah homie.
Nov 8, 2019 11:51am
On Yale that is
Nov 8, 2019 11:51am
Dude. You gotta go be a teacher there.
Nov 8, 2019 11:51am
How's the gravel and building going?

But have to cut this wall out. Pics sent.
Nov 9, 2019 11:59am
May take a while.
Nov 9, 2019 12:00pm
Chain saw make short work. Cleaning up a propane heater I'm selling. One I don't need.

Saw broke mid work
 Had to go to store and get another one. Mixed emotions on this.
Nov 9, 2019 10:50pm
Do you like the new one?
Nov 9, 2019 10:51pm
It is night and day. My old saw I got when my father died. It was new in the box but only $100 brand new. I have babied it and worked the shit out of it over the past decade. Literally well beyond its intended life. The throttle stuck on me and I was on the ladder 10ft in the air cutting with a saw that running wide open. I let my neighbor barrow it and it hasn't been the same since I got it back. It also leaked all fluid so you had to sit it bar side down. And the gas and oil caps were so seized you had to use a pair of channel locks to open and close them.
Nov 9, 2019 10:55pm
I didn't want to buy a saw today. But I wasn't going to. Let a broke saw stop my progress. Went to Lowes and got a saw I have dreamed of having since I started working on them at 16
Nov 9, 2019 10:56pm
A new tool can be moving, no doubt.
Nov 9, 2019 10:57pm
Should be last chain saw I ever have to buy. Honestly.
Nov 9, 2019 10:58pm
Noice. Glad it made for short work too.
Nov 9, 2019 10:58pm
That's 100 year old oak. Some of the hardest wood I've ever worked with. The old saw struggled. I had to  Conatantly keep a razor sharp chain and feather the throttle to make it through. Usually binding often and having to restart the cut.
Nov 9, 2019 11:00pm
Hopefully, you can find some use for the scrap too.
Nov 9, 2019 11:01pm
I save all of it. I am actually using this to make a door on the otherwise. (what you see first) when you drive down the dirt road. A door on tracks. Provide the appearance of a closed barn.

Nov 9, 2019 11:04pm
If you see in picture I have tons of it that HS been trimmed. Squared. Bad ends cut off. Denailed and ready for projects.
Nov 9, 2019 11:04pm
What have yall been up too? Packing?
Nov 10, 2019 12:04am
Lots of work on our computers today. Not packing yet. Move won't be until right after New Year
Nov 10, 2019 12:05am
In my mind you have minimalist things except lots of books. Hehe
Nov 10, 2019 12:06am
(as in, it would take you a short time to pack.)
Nov 10, 2019 12:07am
I would have have to start last November. But I am also very material driven.
Nov 10, 2019 12:07am
Lol
Nov 10, 2019 12:07am
Luckily, I've been able to get rid of most of books. Hopefully, packing won't be too bad. I want to have the kids begin soon enough.
Nov 10, 2019 12:07am
I wish I have more time for computer work and guitar. It always seems I am making bigger projects for myself.
Nov 10, 2019 12:09am
I have given up on fixing and or replumbing some a part of our home. I have done alot. But I still haven't gotten the pressure reducing valve changed. It is a time bomb. The temperature and pressure valve is fed I to a big trash can in my basement is kind of a temporary fail safe.
Nov 10, 2019 12:11am
Ah.
Nov 10, 2019 12:11am
That is a big project, no doubt.
Nov 10, 2019 12:11am
It is. Id like to have a warrenty. I'll trade out aircraft work for plumping work any day. I suspect the plumber would do the same. Lol. Vice versa.
Nov 10, 2019 12:13am
Need to find a plumber with their own aircraft that needs fixin'.
Nov 10, 2019 12:14am
Lol. Small planes use to be very popular. They have lost alot of their appeal. Not alot of people own planes these days. Not like 20-30 years ago.
Nov 10, 2019 12:15am
Just as easy to buy a ticket for regional jet flight
Nov 10, 2019 12:18am
Very cool.
Nov 11, 2019 1:51pm
Reminds me of vans I've seen retrofitted into a home.
Nov 11, 2019 1:52pm
These are 50 year old lights made for incadesent bulbs. We ordered led bulbs off Amazon that are brighter, don't get hot, and use less energy.
Nov 11, 2019 2:04pm
Had to order a pack so we had extra. I replaced the light fixtures when I redid the camper. For safety. But these in the barn are fine.
Nov 11, 2019 2:04pm
Takes alot of heat to burn that old wood. I've burned alot of it. Lol
Nov 11, 2019 2:05pm
Hopefully, they'll last a long time.
Nov 11, 2019 2:05pm
When we first bought the property it had a crappy room built inside it, one built outside of it. And the roof was falling in.
Nov 11, 2019 2:05pm
I have redone the roof. The facia boards. Put in sky lights. Removed the exterior room which was falling in and rotted a bunch of boards. Removed the interior room. Burned and hauled so much trash I can't even remember.
Nov 11, 2019 2:07pm
It has taken a long time to get here. Trees were growing into and over the barn. Covered in poison oak.
Nov 11, 2019 2:07pm
So much work over the years but nice to see hard work pay off.
Nov 11, 2019 2:08pm
Sounds like a good deal of work. I hope it will be useful.
Nov 11, 2019 2:08pm
It has been! Now making it even more useful.

My wife has made alot of these for family over the years using the old wood.
Nov 11, 2019 2:10pm
I adore when people judiciously reuse and repair. It's the right direction in many cases. 
Nov 11, 2019 2:12pm
Fun too.
Nov 11, 2019 2:12pm
Got the farmhouse aesthetic there too, which fits.
Nov 11, 2019 2:12pm
My father in law had a barn that had to be torn down. It was salvageable at one point. But he ignored it for way too long. I ended up selling the lumber off of it and letting some guys tear it down and get it on the ground. The wood was sold and reused probabaly in someones cabin. The metal was hauled for scrap. It is still a heap of wood that needs to be burned or hauled off but it's not a hazard. And 1/3 of it is still standing and will be rebuilt eventually.
Nov 11, 2019 2:14pm
I am glad I was able to salvage my barn. I did get several quotes to have it made into a garage. Which means the center posts had to be removed.
Nov 11, 2019 2:15pm
Most of the builders told me that if I hadn't already put a roof on it. I could have just torn it down a built a new garage.
Nov 11, 2019 2:15pm
So I just kept mine as a barn and put the garage beside the house. It is a better fit and has been awesome to be from my front door to the garage in seconds. Especially when Samantha was younger.
Nov 11, 2019 2:16pm
I can see that.
Nov 11, 2019 2:17pm
The barn is and remains just overflow. But now will be dedicated to the storage of most all of my "toys" keeping my vintage camper, he boat, my tractor and implements out of the weather.
Nov 11, 2019 2:18pm
It's kinda sectioned off into 4 bays. I will now only have one bay for overflow. But I'm excited about getting my boat out of the rain as well as the camper. It still has a few leaks in heavy rain that have caused some delamination of wallboard that I installed. =(. Learned alot in the process though. I wouldn't do it again except for something smaller for me and the wife.
Nov 11, 2019 2:21pm
I woukd do an airstream. But even the junk ones are double digit thousands.
Nov 11, 2019 2:21pm
A new one it's over 100k!

Proud of the wife for wiring these up. She did good.
Nov 11, 2019 8:06pm
And the picture doesn't do it justice. Much more light than I anticipated
Nov 11, 2019 8:06pm
Now to wire in a 3 way switch on the other side. So I have two switches. And the solar panel to charge the battery.
