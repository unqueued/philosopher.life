!! Audit:

* My brother felt the apology was unnecessary. Although, we spoke a lot about why I felt I needed to apologize. It was a valuable thing to lay down.
* I am glad I apologized. I feel much better about it.
* My apology to my daughter was perhaps not as clear as it could have been, and it was more organic. It was still extremely valuable to us.
* I am happy to see that my apologies are valuable.
