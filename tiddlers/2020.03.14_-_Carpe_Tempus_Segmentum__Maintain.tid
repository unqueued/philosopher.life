title: 2020.03.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Maintain

* Woke at Noon
** Solid. I stayed up way too late.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* My wife was in a lot of pain.
** I tended to her, helped her rest, rubs, food, etc. It's been a while since she's had a bad one like this. =(.
* Cleaning. 
** House was done top to bottom. Blessed relief.
* Grocery Shopping
** I'm not loading up the freezer entirely (I have lost a freezer+fridge of food before; still have box and receipt), but we're slowly adding to it. 
** Offspring and I did a thorough job. It was a madhouse.
*** Workers were not getting their breaks.
** Fascinating to see masks and nitrile gloves. 
* Organization.
** Pantry and kitchen continue to march toward a `/finger-cross`ed-destiny of efficiently optimized sanity.
* Whiteboard
** Whiteboard is coming, with markers. I'm excited. Will take down my map and uncut trophy sheet of [[magic]] cards off the wall.
* Finally got in touch with Art Studio
** That's a neat X-mas present from her uncle. I hope she runs with it.
** Apparently, site input went to spambox, and while he eventually e-mailed, took a while before he'd answer phone (my number isn't from the area). 
** Says he will call again on Monday to set an appointment. Bring 3-5 of the pieces she likes/proud of. 
* Made Leftovers & Sprouts + Sabbath Prep
** Excellent meal. 
** [[j3d1h]] cooked alongside me. Went fast.
* Dinner & [[Magic]]
** New way of playing for now. They choose decks, and I bid on how many extra opening turns a disadvantaged deck will have on the advantaged. They pick the deck to play given the bid. It makes for a much more even matchup, and it gives us all some autonomy.
* Called [[JRE]]
** Shot the shit. We are both glad to be able to connect with [[AIR]] again, and we're relieved to know he's doing well.
** He got to visit [[AIR]] at the restaurant. Goes by his nick.
** Rebecca is fairly qualified for this pandemic, and people are taking her advice. Good.
** Called ended on an examination of his intelligent friend's motives.
* Chilled with wife, watching //The Newsroom//
* Sleep by 1?
