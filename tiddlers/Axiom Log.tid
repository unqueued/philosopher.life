Axioms are delightful in theory, but impossible in practice.

This is a metalog for generating work on [[Axioms of h0p3]].

I need to consistently write about about my axioms. I won't do that effectively enough unless I force myself to do it. I need to make it a habit. A log is a way to prove that I'm working on it, to give me a place to work on it, etc.  Let us hope I can find something to say each day. I need to make progress here. This is the foundation of my identity, and I need to start building that model as best as I can, as explicitly as I can.  

Here I attempt to catalog my attempts to piece together this fundamental jigsaw puzzle. I will keep my expectations high and my predictions low. I must climb.
