title: 2019.12.19 - Wiki Review: Cavan

* [[AKChen]]
** I'm hoping he can fire more questions than I can answer, and perhaps even better.
* [[2019.12.18 - Wiki Review: Foot Fetish for Sexual Heeling]]
** Well, that's what you always do. You hold it. You know, like your penis.

** The next few months will be quite an opportunity for us to examine shifts in perspective. Better to process than regress if we can.

** I hope they'll eventually see the light and jump back into using their wikis (or something similar).

** Completed, unfortunately, not automatically.
