title: 2019.02.01 - Wiki Review: Mouseless

* [[2019.01.31 - Link Log: Clean It]]
** In fact, I had too many tabs open. I'm pleasantly surprised to still have so many links to hyperread on href.cool. This was a mixture. 
* [[2019.01.31 - j3d1h: Entity: Voice Chat]]
** This was a pleasant experience. He said I was a cinnamon bun (qua my daughter's claim).
* [[EFF: Cover Letter]]
** What a mess, but I love having even the glimmer of [[hope]]. Of course, they do not want me (even though I think they should...but, ofc, I would think that).
* [[2019.01.31 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Facespitter]]
** ROFL! Shit got Biblical up in there.
* [[2019.01.31 - Prompted Introspection: Fish or Swim]]
** Fishy day. That turned out to be moving in an unexpected way. What is happening to this log now that I have [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]? It's different, right?
* [[2019.01.31 - Wiki Review: Briefish]]
** Why don't I see cheese and fish combined more often? 
* [[2019.01.31 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Outstanding]]
** I've been going to sleep early with cannabliss.
* [[EFF]]
** I think this is where I should troll them. Keep the cover letter clean enough.
** I lack the optics they are probably looking for.
* [[2019.01.31 - TDL: Work!]]
** I'm grateful to be at work. I might hate so many people here, but I not only love people, but I even like some of them (quite rare!).
* [[2019.01.31 - BDS97: MsgPack & EFF]]
** I'm excited by everything. He deserves so much more than I can give him. This one is not up to me, and he doesn't seem to be too interested in more help. Am I really being useful in planning with him? How can I plan better.
* [[2019.01.31 - chacham2: Hey!]]
** No response thus far. I'm betting I won't get one. Well, that's not up to me. That might be it.
* [[2019.01.31 - 1uxb0x: Lego blocks]]
** We're getting there. I'm extremely grateful that he does his best.
* [[2019.01.31 - j3d1h: block]]
** There we go. We're going t learn how to take notes decently.
* [[GAIA]]
** Lol. Well, it fits, thus I sits.
* [[YWSOAM]]
** I like it. I'm not sure if I use it often, but maybe I should. This is a kind of trope of [[h0p3]].
* [[2019.01.30 - dziggetai: Doozy!]]
** I did a terrible fucking job of answering his questions. There's simply too much ground to cover. I also failed many times to directly respond. Some of this is best done in a letter. My shitty writing is extra obvious too.
* [[2019.01.31 - /b/]]
** Some edits, but I can see it needs a revamp. I'm going to sit on it.
