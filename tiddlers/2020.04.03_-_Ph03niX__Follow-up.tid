But people aren't altogether honest with themselves about doing what's necessary for our own collective good.
<<<

What do you think is the collective good, and what are the necessary means to that end?

<<<
So these are lonely, frustrating endeavors on reddit.
<<<

Sometimes, I feel like that's true on the interwebs and life more generally. I still appreciate your endeavors.

<<<
Everyone's just reading headlines, stroking themselves off over their -ists and -isms, and meme-ing themselves silly. 
<<<

What would you like to see everyone do?

<<<
They're expecting their 2-second-awareness alone to automatically right the ship, or for a few someones like me to just crack some digital skulls and "fix" things. Nah, that's not how it works.
<<<

It clearly takes far more than that to "fix" things. I agree.

<<<
And my *interesting eye* is just a product of necessity and my time on the site. It's been about 14 years now, so I've got good bead on things and am well-connected.
<<<

Most of the people who have been on Reddit that long don't seem to have a good bead on things, aren't well connected, and don't seem to pick out things as well as you (let alone use Reddit like you do). I can appreciate how your time on Reddit has shaped your perception and how you engage it though. 

What others sites and tools do you recommend or find useful?

<<<
Speaking of, I'll be leaving this year and have been looking into options for my head-stuffs and other stuffs.
<<<

Why are you leaving? That's curious. I've tried leaving Reddit, but I've not found viable alternatives.

<<<
Github or Elventy were a couple of things I was looking into. But this TiddlyWiki business certainly has my attention. I've been toying around with it the past 24hrs. I'm mainly looking for a cozy brainspace, a good bookmarking solution, and something that does well with files (.pdf, .csv, .json). Bonus if it plays well with cloud storage.
<<<

Tiddlywiki is a great choice. I'm not a terribly skilled user of the tool (that's probably true of Reddit for me as well), but I use it a lot. I assume, with your obsessiveness, you will find lots of fascinating ways to make Tiddlywiki fit your needs. It has a lot of properties I like.

=). I'm glad you liked it. I have a few places around here with collections of links and sundries.
