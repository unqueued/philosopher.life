title: 2018.08.08 - FTO Log: h0p3's Wiki Updates & Notifications

I've been asked for this explicitly from [[Find The Others]] twice ([[2016.08.08 - Josiah: Root]] and [[2018.07.09 - Mark Slater: RSS]]). I clearly am thinking about this problem in a wrong-headed manner. This is a reasonable and kind thing, and I need to find a way. What am I going to do here?

There's a technical end, but that's just the fun stuff. The hard part is the semantic work. There is a flood of data flowing each day into this wiki, and it crawls through evolution. What am I supposed to really point out for others? I have a fragmented, rolling-release schedule in which the work is never done. I never know when to point to something as say, "that's ready for public consumption" or "it's finally done."
