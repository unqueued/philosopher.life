[10:04 AM] h0p3: How's it going?
[11:41 AM] Sohalia: Hey! It’s actually pretty good. It was great visiting friends over the weekend, and I have just been in a better mood overall. One of my goals this year was to write a manuscript of some kind and I’ve got some fun ideas rumbling around in my head for it already. 

Work has been stressful per usual but I am doing my best to keep it from eating me alive. I think I have made some pretty decent mental-progress this past month. Every time I get nearly overwhelmed with stress, I try to do something to help vent it rather than sitting on it. Otherwise, I completely shut down and don’t want to do anything. That seems to have made the biggest difference.
[11:42 AM] Sohalia: Also, it has been the highlight of my days seeing messages/pics in discord from you all (even if they’re sometimes disturbing). Always good for a giggle.
[11:42 AM] Sohalia: How are you? Has your mysterious illness gotten any better?
[11:57 AM] h0p3: Time is already flying this year. Good gracious. Already a month into 2020. Still feels like 1998 to me (when the time-rocketship went into warp drive).
[11:57 AM] h0p3: What do you do to vent?
[11:58 AM] h0p3: Manuscript sounds fun. What kind you going for?
[11:58 AM] h0p3: I'm having fun shitposting and giggling with all you too. :slight_smile:
[11:59 AM] h0p3: I'm feeling better, but then sometimes it strikes really hard. Coughing so hard I'm triggering my gag reflex, asthma (after an hour or two of straight coughing, I feel it), tears, and migraine. Eventually, I just let the snot go and hold my pillow.
[11:59 AM] h0p3: Better though.
[11:59 AM] Sohalia: When I’m stressed, I have to vent the nervous energy and hush the negative feelings. Putting pen-to-paper for that has been REALLY helpful. 

As for a manuscript, I am not totally sure which genre it will nestle itself into but it’s at the very least fantasy with some healthy smug throw in. :laughing:
[11:59 AM] Sohalia: Local degenerate, at your service. o7
[11:59 AM] h0p3: Lol.
[12:00 PM] Sohalia: Yikes... that definitely sounds like allergies.
[12:00 PM] h0p3: Yeah, probably.
[12:01 PM] h0p3: Maybe you might like my friend [[chameleon]]. Degenerate smut-artist, technophile, philosopher, and a hardcore weeb. She's cool.
[12:03 PM] Sohalia: Is she the one with a waifu? :eyes:
[12:03 PM] h0p3: Aye. She is The Last Waifuist, by her own proclamation.
[12:03 PM] h0p3: I wish I had the chance to see her before we moved up here, but it didn't work out.
[12:05 PM] Sohalia: Oof
[12:05 PM] Sohalia: I would suggest video call, but I know your feelings and agree that it’s just bleh
[12:07 PM] Sohalia: I am excited about writing though. I have no intentions of publishing it, but I enjoy the process of getting my thoughts on paper in general anyways.
[12:08 PM] Sohalia: I haven’t really set an end date for myself either. It’s purely for fun. Which feels kinda weird in a way.
