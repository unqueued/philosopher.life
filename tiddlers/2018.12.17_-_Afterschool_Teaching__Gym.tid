title: 2018.12.17 - Afterschool Teaching: Gym

I am pleased to see the school has a lot more resources than I had growing up. 

I love to see their faces light up in the gym.

I have lost all manner of physical agility. It was fun to duel the cop in dodgeball.

I'm enjoying the music. This is fine babysitting.

Sports are always the emphasis. I can see it clearly.

I talked with Delp. We connected better this time. It is pretty much impossible to be myself, but I can be of service.

He still wants my cert, but there is no cost-efficient option to get what I know is purely a piece of paper.

The education PhD program also doesn't come with a cert (would be the only option that I might not have to pay for).

My lesson plans were entirely irrelevant. We sat for almost an hour It was literally just paperwork for the state. Instead, I herded chillun into silent reading by until we had the gym.

I snuck a simple symbolic logic problem on the board and talked about tonal languages with some of the kids.

Some kids were asking about me, so I tried to connect with them.

Several tangents in our conversation. I appreciate how children enjoy rabbitholing in some cases.

That said, I've been silent and listening for most of it.

Whatever attempt at learning we have here is entirely a manipulation of a bureaucracy.

I will slowly attempt to integrate.

I had fun playing dodgeball against The Pig.
