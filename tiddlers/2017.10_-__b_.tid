!! Audit:

* I am quite worried about others, what they think of me, and what I think of them in [[/b/]].
* Redpilled as fuck.
* I am dissecting why I believe people are the way they are. 
* Starting on the 10th, I have always had something to say here. I feel like it leaks out of me. Instead of having a can-opener for [[Prompted Introspection Log]], sometimes I'm overflowing and bursting in [[/b/]].
* I have noted elsewhere that this is an extremely powerful force in my life. My opinions here permeate the wiki and my life. It's stream-of-consciousness, no doubt.
* I have strong emotional reactions to my writing here.
* [[/b/]] is deeply invested in the outcome of {[[About]]} especially.
