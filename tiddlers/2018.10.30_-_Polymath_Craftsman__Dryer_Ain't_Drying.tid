title: 2018.10.30 - Polymath Craftsman: Dryer Ain't Drying

Our dryer isn't drying. No heat, and in fact, we've noticed it decline over time. Cleaned everything again, and still no go. Taking it apart and continuity testing it. 

* Heat element continuity passed
* Resistance on heating element and fuse on the bottom was fine
* Adjacent screws are ~125v, opposing is ~249v

Currently using washer on spin cycle and air drying essentials.

Found a guy selling a dryer for $60, but he already sold it. We talked about what was wrong with my dryer a bit, and he said he'd come over for free to look at it with me. Neat. Texted my address, he came over and checked. It's the fuse on top. We talked me about how to fix it. Ordered the fuse on Amazon.

I took the lint system completely apart. It wasn't really dirty. The hose is clean enough, but I know it gets squished (we have no space). That may be what's tripping it? It's clean, but it still might not be enough.
