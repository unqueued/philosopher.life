> There are strong reasons we should favor destroying IP as it exists in Western legal systems altogether

100% agree. I'm on the Stallman position here that IP should not exist at all - even further! - I posit that IP is a framework for private property and that thus it must be destroyed. IP delenda est!

The GPL is a very clever hack, that could only come out of a mind as twisted (in a good way) as rms'. You could presumably extend it [[as you suggested.|https://philosopher.life/#2019.03.30%20-%20%2Fb%2F]]. I remember on mastodon seeing some work done on making a software license that //deliberately// excludes itself from corporate use; and also one that can only be used by companies with a zero carbon footprint. Interesting stuff!

Keep me abreast of any developments here.
