How's it going?
Mar 4 8:48pm
You off work for the week?
Mar 5 8:46pm
Yeah man. Been discussing business names with wife. Took a few hours to get that. Lol
Mar 5 11:10pm
Noice. Are you changing the name of the salon?
Mar 5 11:11pm
MOORE'S GOLF CARTS Sales & Service
Mar 5 11:12pm
Cool.
Mar 5 11:13pm
That sounds solid.
Mar 5 11:13pm
I don't know anything about that industry, but it's one that you can run end-to-end.
Mar 5 11:14pm
It seems
Mar 5 11:14pm
Getting llc at 8am. Interview with Air methods medical helicopters at 10.
Mar 5 11:14pm
Sick.
Mar 5 11:14pm
I wish you all the luck in the world. Aint nothing I can do over here, but I wish I knew how to increase the odds for ya.
Mar 5 11:15pm
Let me know how the interview goes.
Mar 5 11:16pm
I appreciate it. I don't know if the medical helicopters will fit. No idea how well my business will take off. Just talking with alot of wholesellers and getting info. Lots of cheap golf carts with easy money potential. Gonna start small and see how it goes. A learning curve but not it's nothing compared to aircraft maintenance.
Mar 5 11:21pm
Aye.
Mar 5 11:22pm
Hopefully, it will fit. If it doesn't, it doesn't =/.
Mar 5 11:22pm
Indeed. Coming home is a distinct possibility in the near future. I don't see myself slaving away 20 years from now doing the same thing I am now.
Mar 5 11:23pm
I would like a less stressful job simply. My body is taking a toll and it's showing in my family.
Mar 5 11:25pm
Body mind and soul. Lol
Mar 5 11:25pm
An hour and 45 min interview with skills test as well. Lol
 Wow...
Mar 6 11:50am
Awesome. That is a good sign.
Mar 6 11:50am
And, they get to see your expertise shine.
Mar 6 11:51am
He talked alot. And it's 24/7 on call. And I sucked at the skills test. It is a much more stressful job than I have now. I'm afraid to take it. To be honest.
Mar 6 11:51am
It might not be worth taking. =(
Mar 6 11:52am
The whole point is to be able to still have time and energy left in the gastank to do what matters most in life. This might not be that opportunity.
Mar 6 11:53am
Fuck.
Mar 6 11:53am
But some weeks they only work 10hrs and get paid for 40. Some times they work two weeks straight. But get the overtime.
Mar 6 11:53am
That is appreciable.
Mar 6 11:54am
LLC is started?
Mar 6 11:55am
The pans you keep putting in the fire make sense.
Mar 6 11:56am
Met with cpa. Suppose to do it online. I'm afraid of that too. Life's a bitch. You know all too well.
Mar 6 11:56am
k
Mar 6 11:56am
Yeah, I do. Lol.
Mar 6 11:56am
I suspect to get a job offer. My biggest fear is the steep learning curve and being focused in one area for so many years.
Mar 6 11:57am
They pretty much don't do sheet metal repairs.
Mar 6 11:57am
Why not?
Mar 6 11:58am
So that skill set is not required. They ship it out. It's mostly avionics and mechanical. With all of the pressure on the mechanic. Alot of figure it out on your own type senerios.
Mar 6 11:59am
Which is scary as fuck at first. Until you get squared away on that airframe.
Mar 6 11:59am
From over here, ignunt know nothing me about this topic, I am confident that you would make the learning curve.
Mar 6 12:00pm
My sheet metal skills are highly sought after in the industry. But not at this position. And no where near me.
Mar 6 12:00pm
You can always come back to sheet metal, right?
Mar 6 12:01pm
Always.
Mar 6 12:01pm
My boss would not let me be a mechanic because I'm too skilled of a sheetmetal guy. Basically skill set where I go and pay goes. Sheet metal then mechanic then electrician.
Mar 6 12:02pm
But if your entire operation is to. Just keep a few aircraft running. It's we do it all here type of unit.
Mar 6 12:03pm
And big weeks long sheet metal jobs are farmed out to stations that have more time and capacity. It's a 3 man operation right now. And they cover other bases when guys go on Vaca and shit.
Mar 6 12:04pm
But no drinking, no Valium, no kratom, no none of that with this job. Even trips put of town have to have coverage.
Mar 6 12:05pm
=/
Mar 6 12:05pm
That is a significant problem.
Mar 6 12:05pm
Sorry. I'm poorly explaining this.... Just big decisions. But the hangar is 5 min from my house...
Mar 6 12:05pm
I get it. It's a huge fork in the road of your life.
Mar 6 12:06pm
The newest guy there has been there 8 years...
Mar 6 12:06pm
Yikes
Mar 6 12:06pm
Lol right.
Mar 6 12:07pm
I mean, that could be a good sign (but, it may just be a desperation issue). Low turnover can be excellent. I hate that you might not get another shot for quite a while (or at all).
Mar 6 12:07pm
What does your wife think?
Mar 6 12:07pm
She doesn't do well with these decisions. She just wants me to be happy.
Mar 6 12:08pm
I do not know what that means well enough. My wife also will tell me: that's up to you, I don't know, I'm happy with what makes you happy.
Mar 6 12:09pm
Just as long as I don't get the: "fine, whatever" lol.
Mar 6 12:09pm
Right. I get the same pretty much.
Mar 6 12:19pm
