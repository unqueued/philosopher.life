*** That is a hell of a paper. I do not have the answer, sadly. There's a way in which I prefer anonymity and decentralized networks that are then culled by the user. People must be able to speak their minds, and people must be able to filter it. How do you ensure people to see The Other at the right times, in the right way, for the right reasons?

*** I'm surprised they would say this, but I see it.

*** I stand corrected. That makes more sense.

*** I am not surprised by the results. I think this is a complicated rabbithole too. The conceptual analysis isn't strong in this article, but it wasn't really meant to be philosophical. I worry, of course, this will be used to dismiss points of view that are still fundamentally engaged in [[The Categorical Imperative]] and instead push popular progressive points of view without careful analysis.
