title: 2018.08.01 -- Self-Dialectic

I'm always pointing out what's NOT [[The Good]], but never constructively pointing out enough what IS [[The Good]]. I need to see it, speak of it, and become it more effectively.

Reason has both cognitive and non-cognitive components. It's the dialectical marriage of the two which gives rise to the real you (or is a giant step in that direction).
