title: 2019.10.17 - Wiki Audit: FTO Timelines

[[Timelines]] grew a bit with [[Timelines: FTO]]. I'm not sure if it is necessary or useful enough. I'd like to keep growing tab trees to find out what matters and why. Maybe in a decade I'll have a fucking clue how to do this correctly, lol. 

You take more risks on cannabliss, plenty of them are dumb or pointless. No pain, no gain.
