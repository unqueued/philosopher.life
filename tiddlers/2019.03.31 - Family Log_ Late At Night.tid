!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I didn't make a fuss when my routine was broken at church. It sucks when my routine is disturbed.
** I'm glad to see you writing more. Keep it up!
** I like that fact that you are such a loving and warm person.
** You did a good job working on your computer, especially when you hated it. Doing the right thing when it's painful has profound merit.
** You've been paying more attention to the family's stories and commenting.
* j3d1h
** I've made a lot of TW code this week.
** I like what you've been writing on //The Chosen//
** It was so awesome to be able to talk about [[Naming and Necessity]] with you. It's kind of crazy that I get to speak about it with a 13yo. 
** Thank you for listening to my annoying ideas.
* k0sh3k
** I did a good job avoiding things I shouldn't eat. I ate fruits and veggies.
** Thank you for taking care of me when I was sick. You didn't have to do everything you did for me, and you made it easy on me. 
** Thank you for taking the time to plan and to do all the prep work. You've been thinking about future [[k0sh3k]] and future us in working ahead.
** Thank you for making money.
** Thank you for reminding us to do our laundry.
** Thank you for wrestling with me about [[L]]'s letter.
* h0p3
** I'm proud of myself for coming up with the gentle idea of cozy 1-on-1 time with each member of the family during family time. It's not like me, and I like that about...myself.
** Thank you for sticking with what you think is important even if everyone else finds it weird. (High praise from my daughter)
** Thank you for aiding me in setting up my computer and troubleshooting.
** I'm pleasantly surprised by the exceptional kindness in the tone of your letter to [[L]].
** Thank you for taking the time to talk about stories with people even though you don't think you are good at it.
