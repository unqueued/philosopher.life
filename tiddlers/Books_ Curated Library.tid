title: Books: Curated Library

!! About:

//A library for our family to help us speak the same memetically-referential language.//

We all speak English, but we don't speak the same dialects, versions, or with the same connotations and neural pathways developed through having consumed the same experience machines written in English. We need a core family library that helps us learn to speak a shared language about complex topics. These are memetic bridges. This is our family's literary culture.

---
!! Principles:

* Collect books that are absolutely central to your family's Great Conversation
* Give strong preference to books that are also central to The Great Human Conversation
* Don't feel bad about how poorly organized, labeled, tagged it is. Just get it on there. We'll worry about the catalogue later.
