*** This is disturbing. I don't feel bad for the boomers, but Gen X is getting fucked yet again.
*** These companies are very good at seeking competitive advantages generally. They are ruthless about it. I actually wonder if they are sifting for rockstars willing to take shit that they can bend to their will, etc.

*** This was actually a really interesting post about the Jediism's emergence as a cult. Unfortunately, the philosophy mods cleared house. I fucking hate this censorship. What I want is the ability to subscribe to filters for people to censor for me, but to have the ability to uncensor when I want. I do want my experience shaped, in part, by the thoughts of others. But, I do not want to be beholden to them. Give me a system where we sift together, whereas work together to find relevance, where nobody's opinion is absolutely blacked out by definition, but where I can create the filter-bubbles I need to see, etc.

*** The arms race continues. The golden age of adblocking is about to end. Do not believe this is for the public. Google knows exactly what they are doing. Smells even fishier lumped with their stupid fucking AMP. Love how they control the listing (although act they don't).
*** I have less of a problem with it if I can disable it. I want to be able to control this censorship feature.
