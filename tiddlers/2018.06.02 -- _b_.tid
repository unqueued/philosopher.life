My brother JRE asked the social worker about my background check to stay with them for the weekend. It turned out it wasn't necessary. It's clear to me that my brother could have just found out if he really wanted to, without having to wait. Unfortunately, he's also playing it off like he would have helped AIR, except for the fact background check issue (which he could have resolved). I'm not partaking of that narrative. It's not true.

Some memes are better than others, and some memes shouldn't exist. I'm a memetic elitist, a culturalist.

I suggest that Keynesianism is a reactionary tool to prop up alternative or partial Neoliberal policies/perspectives. It's not about the New Deal.

Free will has been settled though, hasn't it? The best case for it these days seem to be a language game called "compatibilism" where you redefine free will to mean something vague about acting according to motivations, and when someone accepts that definition you turn around and say "Aha! We do have free will after all!"
