title: 2020.01.01 - Prompted Introspection: Feel On

!! How do feel on (any holiday)?

(I caress it gently).

~~Charlie Kelly~~ Samwise, this cooshtun make no sense, so do. Feel very much caveman, but am. Yes. I be a caveman. Feel in gut turnings, tightness of chest, brow furlycurls when think hard, and penis always homo erectus. My [[monster]] is my fire, even on holiday. 

Holiday are times where tribes gather together. Social habits difficult for caveman. Send me deep think often, almost psychosis in some cases. Feel need to connect, and do what can. Usually, fail, like normal caveman.
