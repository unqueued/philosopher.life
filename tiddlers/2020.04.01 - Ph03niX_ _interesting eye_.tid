title: 2020.04.01 - Ph03niX: *interesting eye*

Yeah. These are rather serious issues, and they do translate out to meatspace. But people aren't altogether honest with themselves about doing what's necessary for our own collective good.  So these are  lonely, frustrating endeavors on reddit. Everyone's just reading headlines, stroking themselves off over their -ists and -isms, and meme-ing themselves silly. They're expecting their 2-second-awareness alone to automatically right  the ship, or for a few someones like me to just crack some digital skulls and "fix" things. Nah, that's not how it works.

And my *interesting eye* is just a product of necessity and my time on the site. It's been about 14 years now, so I've got good bead on things and am well-connected. Speaking of, I'll be leaving this year and have been looking into options for my head-stuffs and other stuffs. Github or Elventy were a couple of things I was looking into. But this TiddlyWiki business certainly has my attention. I've been toying around with it the past 24hrs. I'm mainly looking for a cozy brainspace, a  good bookmarking solution,  and something that does well with files (.pdf, .csv, .json). Bonus if it plays well with cloud storage.
