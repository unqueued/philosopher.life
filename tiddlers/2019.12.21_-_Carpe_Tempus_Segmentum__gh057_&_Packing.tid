title: 2019.12.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: gh057 & Packing

* Woke at 8ish
* Snuggles
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Got to meet [[gh057]]'s son, soon-to-be daughter-in-law, and his granddaughter
** Cool folks. We compared tats.
* Packed the pods
** We're going to need all 3. I'm glad we have them. 
** First is full, to the 8' ceiling. 
** The rooms feel so empty, yet we still have all our machines, a couch, and some chairs. The flavor and convenience is gone, but our activities aren't varying much.
** I had a good time with [[gh057]] in particular. He's a fun work partner.
*** His self-deprecating humor is hilarious. 
** I'm grateful that we had help. We got a decent amount done in a short period of time, and none of us are sore. (Though, I've been very sleepy).
* One of the maintenance workers stopped by to speak with me about getting linux on his machine and building a gaming PC for (or with, on my suggestion) his son.
* We went to the only legit Mexican restaurant in town for a treat. 
** I think the last meal which was that good was at Thanksgiving.
* An amazing nap.
* Spoke with [[JRE]].
** He got really angry at work. I'm glad I remember enough about fitting to see why. That cop is a piece of shit.
** Viper has a sore throat.
** My brother has been shaken up about his tests. I'm hoping keto will be useful to him. He's taking it harder and more seriously.
* Psych, Mandalorian
* Solved various computing problems together.
* Read+Write 
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 2?
