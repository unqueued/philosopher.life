How's it going?
Fri 1:09pm
Job interview for next week at LOCAL air evac helicopter company. Very hard position to get with the school being on the same airport and no one leaving the job.  Did a pre-screen telephone interview yesturday and working with HR to schedule a time next week for in person.
Fri 1:13pm
Fuck yeah, homie.
Fri 1:14pm
That is amazing.
Fri 1:14pm
I know you aren't trying to get your hopes up, but I'm very excited.
Fri 1:14pm
Thanks. Me too.
Fri 1:14pm
That would solve so many problems.
Fri 1:15pm
No move and 5 min from the house. Same pay... Lots of downsides. On call and very stressful type of position. But still just a floor mechanic. It's a.... Finish out my career job if I so desired. And I would. Genuinely be fixing helicopters that save people's lives. Instead of killing them...
Fri 1:17pm
There is alot of pride in that. That I would take to heart.

I believe my work in the depart of defence was equally important. Most notably maintaining helicopters that American solders flew. And as the redneck patriot I am, I take pride in that. But deep down. I know the darkness hidden behind that shroud of American war culture.
Fri 1:19pm
On call sucks. =/. Still, it's an improvement. And, you never know, perhaps you will move one day to another part of the country.
Fri 1:20pm
I appreciate your honesty and willingness to reason carefully about the consequences your work.
Fri 1:21pm
That is not something most people I know are willing to do.

Sat 8:50pm
Kinda boring. Kinda paranoid over this virus thing. Lazy mostly. Filled up all of my gas can, ran generator and tractor for a bit. To get fuel running thru them. Ran old truck to gas station so wife and I went for a ride. Topped of all my gas cans after filling all my equipment. Did one more prepping Walmart run mainly for dog food and peanut butter and canned meat.
Sat 8:57pm
Virus-wise, boring is good
Sat 8:57pm
Just trying to be prepared in case whe aren't suppose to leave the house for awhile. So we actually don't have to leave. No food will go to waste.
Sat 8:57pm
Yup.
Sat 8:58pm
Last major thing on my list is TP. Been thinking for quite a while about goggles, nitriles gloves, masks (even with limited use, not useless). Keep taking them out of amazon basket.
Sat 8:58pm
There is a part of me who truely wishes for the collapse and chaos. Like I dunno. A purge.
Sat 8:59pm
I can appreciate the desire to kill of sections of the human species.
Sat 8:59pm
off*
Sat 8:59pm
May it take most of the boomers, amen.
Sat 9:00pm
Haha.
Sat 9:00pm
We could land some awesome jobs after that.
Sat 9:00pm
Ah. I think we'd have much higher odds of solving a number of problems larger than ourselves.
Sat 9:01pm
Would be great.
Sat 9:01pm
Well, I hope your boring weekend has some good rest and family time.
Sat 9:02pm
Mine has been pretty boring too.
