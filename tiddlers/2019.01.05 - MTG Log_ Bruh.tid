[[JRE]]:

Mountain, port, waste, whirler, chief, crater, matron. He mulls to 5. I mountain. He goes mountain, lackey. I crater. He SWINGS, we laugh, I have him take it back (I'm walking crater on the board for funsies). I swing. Port him upkeep, shoot lackey on swing. I chief, swing. He attempts to inc, I have him take it back, he instigates. I matron->inc, inc->instigator, swing for 3. He passes turn without incing chief. I chieftain, lackey, swing...he allow it to connect, but then remember he can inc, so he incs it.

[[JRE]]:

He says no do-overs. I keep: mountain, cavern, vial, skirk, inc, 2 chief. He mountains, lackey. I mountain, skirk. He drops mountain (skips draw, I try to get him to draw, he won't), pass. I inc, swing, pass. He wastes my cavern. I drop port, vial, swing. He wastes me again. I waste him back, swing. He drops another cavern; my gamble didn't pay off. I ramp and swing. He matron->chieftain (fascinating). I vial chief, swing. He drops chieftain, swing, I block matron, sac->inc->chieftain. I drop port, vial->chief, swing with both. He drops instigator, skirk, swing with matron. I vial trigger on stack put whirler into play, draw land, trash, swing for the win.
