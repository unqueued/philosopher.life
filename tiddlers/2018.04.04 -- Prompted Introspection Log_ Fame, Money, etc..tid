title: 2018.04.04 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Fame, Money, etc.

!! Which is least important to you?money, power, fame?and why?

Important in what respect? Even if I were not to pursue any of them to any degree, even indirectly, these notions are still crucial to my life simply in virtue of how other people pursue them. Setting this aside, they have obvious overlap. The question is too reducible.

Money is a form, currency, or expression of power. Power is the end of money, thus money is merely instrumental; it can't be as important by definition.

What is fame? I suggest it is: to be remembered, to be thought about, to be known by others, to be injected into their minds, to be embedded in their memeplexes, to be loved, to be desired, to be listened to, to be feared, to be empathized with, to gain pseudo-immortality by existing in minds of others and through the generations, and influence or be obeyed. That's roughly what it reduces down to.

I want you to see that these are powers. Thus, fame is a subset or expression of power.

Power is the purest form and end of the others. It's definitionally more important. I remind you of [[The Will to Power]].
