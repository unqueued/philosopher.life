Jan 6 9:54pm
You doing alright?
Jan 6 9:55pm
Oh, you know, just the normal
Jan 6 9:56pm
I'm sorry. I hope everyone will feel 100% soon and stay that way.
Jan 6 9:57pm
Btw, have you heard any more from social services? Presumably, there's not been a time where the parents showed up for visitation to make it worth calling you guys.
Jan 6 9:58pm
Just anxiety and despair about the enthusiastic war worship of my coworkers
Jan 6 9:58pm

Jan 6 9:58pm
Makes me sick.
Jan 6 9:58pm
I don't know how you maintain your cool around them. Like titanium or something.
Jan 6 9:59pm
Aye, don't get me wrong, the dude prolly deserved it, but so do our leaders
Jan 6 9:59pm
Nah, just collapse in on myself and want to quit, but then you realize my workplace is not unique
Jan 6 10:00pm
Also, the tribe at work has singled out an apprentice, makes me super mad and the gap between my view on power dynamics and our responsibility towards apprentices and their view feels too large to gap
Jan 6 10:01pm
Too large to bridge*
Jan 6 10:02pm
Ugh =/
Jan 6 10:02pm
Sometimes I think you are in a special hell as the sole beacon of light. Some battles simply can't be won. I'm going to bet you'll be talking with the apprentice anyway to at least provide some perspective (though, who knows if the manchild will understand what you have to say).
Jan 6 10:03pm
Pulled the apprentice aside and let him know how his stupid joke (the b in ibew stands for bitches) is being used against him and spread to people in power, that he needs to watch who he shares with and how he is being singled out... and he immediately used my information to get mouthy with the person that is trying to hurt him (/facepalm)
Jan 6 10:04pm
=(
Jan 6 10:04pm
That sucks dude. Reminds me of foreman going straight to the cop too.
Jan 6 10:05pm
You see a step ahead of all of us here.
Jan 6 10:05pm
I went and talked to three of the people that are doing it today and gave my argument that getting mad and vindictive that he changed the brothers into bitches is kind of proving the apprentices view right
Jan 6 10:06pm
Lol, aye
Jan 6 10:06pm
Hard to just be one of the guys, silly and fun, when I feel like I have to make sure the people I'm talking to don't turn on each other
Jan 6 10:07pm
True. Admittedly, even if you weren't aiming for justice, you would still stick out like a sore thumb. From what I can tell, you might get to be "one of the guys" 70% of the time at best. You think weird for them, and you can't unlearn or unsee that.
Jan 6 10:09pm
Aye, I think it's much less than 70%
Jan 6 10:10pm
They are lucky to have you, especially because they don't even know they are lucky to have you.
Jan 6 10:11pm
I have a "let's put aside our shit and do our work attitude" until I see something shitty.  But this job has been weird because I'm getting rejected/ignored even when I'm trying to just work on our project
Jan 6 10:11pm
Cloutlessness
Jan 6 10:12pm
Anyway, how about you?  Any pods yet?
Jan 6 10:13pm
I have been sick today. Had a really hard time breathing last night, and I'm coughing up junk.
Jan 6 10:13pm
Just stayed in bed all day, and I didn't get fuckall done.
Jan 6 10:13pm
Eeew
Jan 6 10:13pm
No pods yet, but I hope to have an ETA soon. Sucks having no furniture except an inflatable bed.
Jan 6 10:14pm
You don't, have, to live like a refugee ( a refugee)
Jan 6 10:14pm
Lol. We're good. We have internet, computers, food, dishes, trashcans, cats.
Jan 6 10:15pm
Wow, I didn't realize that was tom petty...
Jan 6 10:15pm
I feel like I have had a mucus plug I  my throat all day.  Won't go up or down, just sitting there
Jan 6 10:17pm
Them menthol candies are real good. might help.
Jan 6 10:18pm
Think I'm just gonna bend a wire hanger and try to scoop it out.

I got home and viper was still awake and I was just super happy to see him.  Held him up and was giving him tons of kisses and pull him back and he has a little throw up on his face.  I use my hand to wipe at my face to see if I got some on me, turns out it was all over my beard and moustache and I accidentally wiped some into my mouth
Jan 6 10:20pm
I gagged
Jan 6 10:20pm
lol
Jan 6 10:20pm
And I was still just super happy to see him :)
Jan 6 10:21pm
=D
Jan 6 10:21pm
I didn't gag, although yesterday when he had a crazy shit while driving him home from dinner at reb's family, and we had to peel his clothes off him and wipe the shit off his belly and the back of his neck, I definitely gagged...
Jan 6 10:22pm
Smelled like he had been sneaking white castles...
Jan 6 10:23pm
lol
Jan 6 10:24pm
I always remind my offspring they both ate their shit, and while [[R]] denies it, I am absolutely certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that [[k0sh3k]] did as well. Dat White Castle loop.
Jan 6 10:25pm
Viper slitherin' at all these days?
Jan 6 10:26pm
Nice
Jan 6 10:26pm
Should start here soon, if memory serves
Jan 6 10:26pm
My lil'VIP does slither, but no crawl.  He can turn on his belly and he sort of gets wherever he wants eventually, but it's more a scoot

Jan 6 10:28pm
He is trying to talk, and what he lacks in clear pronunciation and vocabulary he makes up for with volume.
Jan 6 10:28pm
Lol, god damn, haven't seen that in forever
Jan 6 10:29pm
Yeah, no, his scoot is on all fours, he just moves his arms one at a time, then makes an a frame with his feet and hands, then slams both knees to the ground, which nets him some forward movement
Jan 6 10:31pm
Painful to watch
Jan 6 10:31pm
He might be full retard /fingerscrossed
Jan 6 10:31pm
Cool random internet fact that I cannot verify, but if I understand correctly, even deaf children will babble in sign language. Like, it's a natural part of the climb.
Jan 6 10:31pm
Lol
Jan 6 10:31pm
Neat
Jan 6 10:31pm
Other fact, when you get a new kidney transplanted in you, they put it in a totally different spot and generally leave your shitty kidneys in place
Jan 6 10:32pm
Who knows where he'll be in a month. Once he starts standing, it's game over.
Jan 6 10:32pm
Why?
Jan 6 10:33pm
Too much vasculature to warrant the risk
Jan 6 10:33pm
And those low functioning kidneys dont generally hurt you
Jan 6 10:33pm
I fucked with reb the other day by putting the toilet paper roll in backwards. She changed it and was super incredulous "we have never had this problem before-- how did we go 5 years and you never loaded it wrong before."  I changed it back and she didn't notice until she was with viper at 2am and she just pulled the roll out and set it on the tub, which let me know I had actually upset her cause she was basically refusing to play the game with me...
Jan 6 10:37pm
ROFL
Jan 6 10:37pm
We are both trolls to our women. I think that is my language of love or something.
Jan 6 10:38pm
I told her I understood her message and that it was a joke.  She said she wasn't in a joking mood when she found it.  Cool cool, I get that...
Jan 6 10:38pm
But then she went and put it in the wrong way a few days later!!
Jan 6 10:38pm
lol
Jan 6 10:39pm
I wish I had just done it, but instead i just asked her how upset she would be if i drilled a hole through the roll and just put it in sideways...
Jan 6 10:39pm
Wasted my idea
Jan 6 10:39pm
So, giving it to you now, dont tell her beforehand, just drill a hole in your tp roll and see what [[k0sh3k]] says lol
Jan 6 10:40pm
rofl
Jan 6 10:41pm
that is such a good idea
Jan 6 10:41pm
My offspring still remember when we saved up the toilet paper rolls to make a giant tube that stretched out of the bathroom, but still allowed us to pee directly into the toilet.
Jan 6 10:42pm
Yeah, feel so stupid for blowing a natural escalation
Jan 6 10:42pm
Sounds soggy, and hard for girls to use
Jan 6 10:42pm
Boys only. Two time use max.
Jan 6 10:43pm
Bed time now

night. Sleep well! Love you.

Sleep well big bro, lots of love
