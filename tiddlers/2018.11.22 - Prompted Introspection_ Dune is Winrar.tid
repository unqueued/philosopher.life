title: 2018.11.22 - Prompted Introspection: Dune is Winrar

!! What is your favorite book and what do you like most about it?

My desire/opinion hasn't changed: [[2017.12.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Book]]. //Dune// is the clear winrar.

It is obvious that Herbert used mind-altering substances. Spice stood for so much. I'm still enamored with the spice of life, the blind and massive pursuit of desire satisfaction, the phenomenological experience, and the sheer power and centrality of it to everyone in the story. The contrast with water on the one planet that had all the wealth on it is awesome.

The institutional knowledge, evolutionary divisions, the unstable tripod as dialectical model, the paranoia over AI and atomics, the cutthroat royalty, religion and gnosticism as opiates of the masses and cults, etc. I'm not going to be able to do the book justice here.

What do I like most about it? This is a book that I have read at many stages in my life over. It reads like a different book too often (just like the Spice itself! `/mind-blown`). How many books are better the //second// time you read them? World-building, glossary-requirements, and story-telling are taken to another level.
