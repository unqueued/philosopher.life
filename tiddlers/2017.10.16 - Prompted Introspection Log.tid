!! Respond to the following:

If you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor.

You are either with us or against us? Maybe. That is not always false.  

Another reading of this is that nobody is actually neutral. Those who think of themselves as neutral have made a choice which isn't neutral at all: they've chosen to quietly sit by as the oppressor oppresses the oppressed.

That sounds about right. I can think of some exceptions and cornercases. On average, this is correct.

Stand up, bitches. Fuck the Police.
