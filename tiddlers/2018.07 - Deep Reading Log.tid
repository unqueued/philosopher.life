!! Audit:

* I've been working on the same two major books the entire month
* Infinite Jest has been an absolute beast. I've been too busy to bury myself further into it. At this point, I'm so far into the book, I just want to finish it to say I did. It's not garbage, but it's not obviously a story that I really love. Perhaps a second read through (yikes) will change my mind, but I have my doubts.
** I'm very glad I let my wife off the hook here.
* Lost in the Cosmos has been a book with high variance as well. Some parts of it are brilliant, and others pretty terrible. I'm very glad to be reading it though, which I can't say about IJ anymore at this point.
* Magical Thinking, Fantastic Film, and the Illusions of Neoliberalism was pretty decent. I'm interested in meeting Blouin for building a possible friendship. I have no idea if we'll hit it off or not.
* Narc Decoder was interesting, but it wasn't as polished as I was hoping.
* I haven't been shopping by myself very much this month. I've done almost no audio books. The Ego Tunnel, however, is clearly amazing. I'm glad to have it on the list.
* The Demon series should have stopped at book 2, maybe 3. The last book was fucking awful. 
* I'm disappointed in my reading this month. That's okay. It's been a hell of a month.
