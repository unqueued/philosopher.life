title: 2019.01.13 - AA: How's Afterschool?

```
How’s afterschool stuff going?
THU 2:13 PM
It's okay. Setting predictions lower and my moral expectations lower with it. Trying to be useful. Coding students XFL for privacy, where X is grade number, and F and L are initials of the first and last names.
THU 2:14 PM
How about you? How's school going?
THU 2:18 PM
:confused: our school tends to recruit sports types from the public school —who maybe ineligible because of grades (maybe these are not their targets but it sure seems like it) I am struggling to catch these three Jr’s up in Alg 2 when they have no foundation. (Sigh)
THU 2:18 PM
And no wanting to work or even how to start ...it’s gonna be a good puzzle
THU 2:19 PM
I assume you'll also get kids who pay the price to attend but will be kicked out of school for bad behavior too (at least a couple such)
THU 2:19 PM
Not everything is up to you (thankfully, though sadly in some respects)
THU 2:19 PM
Yeah we get some who are here to be “fixed” and they don’t generally last long especially if they don’t want to be here.
THU 2:22 PM
These guys seem to want to be here but are used to big classes where they can hide or goof off —it’s harder to hide in a class of 9 (instead of 36-40)
THU 2:23 PM
yup
THU 2:23 PM
It will work out —I think I need to work on that competitive side as motivation—reward and praise ones that are making effort —I will let you know how it goes.
THU 2:24 PM
One is smart and catches on but it’s new... one is polite but all I get are blank stares and the last is Mr Personality who is hoping if he says the right things, people will just give him the answers. All of them can do it though :blush:. It’s my challenge for the year
THU 2:27 PM
Have any smart ones hiding in your group?
THU 2:32 PM
