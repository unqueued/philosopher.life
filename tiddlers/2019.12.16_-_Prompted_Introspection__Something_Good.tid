title: 2019.12.16 - Prompted Introspection: Something Good

!! How do you feel when you do something that is very good?

[[gfwiwcgws]]? There are limits to how well I understand anything as being very [[good]]. I like when something is both [[right]] and [[beautiful]] in as generalized a manner as I can conceive. However small, I'd like to think I just contribute to such a thing when the stars align. Uh, I can have a wide range of emotions.

Is this an important question? Yeah. I have no fucking clue how to answer it well.
