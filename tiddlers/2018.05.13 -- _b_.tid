Sometimes I feel like the non-cognitive parts of me, those computer networks from which Dasein emerges, are at war with each other. It is as though I have a virus in my system, or even worse, that my hardware is missing a marble or two, and it is as though the various computers on my network accuse each other, do not trust each other, and cannot see the larger model/cause. I am peeling aparts the layers to identify it methodically. I'm troubleshooting myself.
