* Noping to DCK this week.
** [[Root Users]], advise me again. I'm so stubborn.
* Read+Write
* Family Time!
** I am excited.
* Lentil Soup.
* I'd like to have more guests, but my wife is the boss here.
** She has limited spoons, and she is crazy busy. The whirlwind is strong.
* I'm in the mood for walking (and fucking).
