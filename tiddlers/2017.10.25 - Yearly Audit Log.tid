title: 2017.10.25 - Yearly Audit Log

* As I go through {[[Focus]]}, primarily {Projects}, I can see I still have my problem. It seems to belong in many places. I'm not sure what to do with it. That's okay. The subjects seem to be globbing together, and I'm worried I've globbed them too much.

* {[[Principles]]}
** I've finished my 0-depth audit of this page. I've worked on it several times. It is as good as I can get it for now.
* {[[Focus]]}
** Finished for now. With more depth, I may have more modifications to make.
* {[[Vault]]}
** Lots of work to do in here. 
** I've largely left this top-level directory alone because I've been so damned busy.
** I would like to eventually schedule a practice for filling this out.
*** I need to find good ways to organize it and prompts myself.
