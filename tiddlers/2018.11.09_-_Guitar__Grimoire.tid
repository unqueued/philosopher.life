title: 2018.11.09 - Guitar: Grimoire

My son was clearly envious of the sound that his sister is producing, and I decided he should give fingerpicking another shot. It sounds like it may work this time! I gave him my guitar grimoire, and I hope he will carefully practice his way through it. It has the theory he needs, and ton of valuable practice in there.

I played a bit, but moved on to other things today. I was getting my son setup.

My daughter continued her work. I think the hard solo is improving. She doesn't have her internal metronome going just yet, but I think she's beginning to bootstrap one, if I'm not mistaken.
