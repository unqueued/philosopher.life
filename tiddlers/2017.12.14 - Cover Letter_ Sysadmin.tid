I was very interested to hear about Milligan's recent opening for a system administrator. I believe I would be a good fit, both for the position and for the school community.<<ref "2018.12.24">>

Computers are a paradise for me. Computing has been my craft since I was child. I've always been obsessed with learning, building, and improving computer systems inside and out because they are beautiful to me. I practice and do this work whether I get paid to or not; it's part of my vocation.

I enjoy researching, testing, and migrating to new tools, frameworks, platforms, and infrastructure. I take pleasure in configuring and upgrading environments, setting up appropriate permissions, automating tasks, tailoring workflows, piecing together process chains, troubleshooting networks, and building healthy ecosystems.

I'm comfortable with remote administration over command line, web interfaces, and remote graphical access tools. I also live 5 minutes away from the school, so it isn't problematic for me to handle midnight emergencies.

System maintenance is a passion of mine; the details matter to me. I'm diligent about keeping snapshots, redundancies, and backups because I know what's at stake. I pursue rolling releases, and I'm paranoid about security updates. I need my machines to run beautifully as matters of pride and satisfaction. When something goes wrong or doesn't function the way it should, I feel compelled to diagnose it, find the best solution, and fix it. I enjoy the challenges of putting out fires, triaging work loads, and planning ahead. 

I'm not afraid of low-level work, new paradigms, asking questions, and negotiating the needs of multiple parties. I celebrate technical writing, generating clean documentation, and ensuring well-commented code. Being a good system administrator is about practicing the golden rule in meeting people's needs and making the next system administrator's job as easy as possible.

I prefer to use FOSS tools, but I'm happy to work with whatever is available to me. I see computers as critical tools and complex forces in our society, and I hope to help us use them wisely. My goal is to build computing systems which meet the needs of users while maintaining usability, efficiency, flexibility, security, and availability. 

In addition to fulfilling the role of system administrator, I would be happy to join the Milligan community. I have worked in academic communities for years, and am comfortable there. More importantly, being Christian is fundamental to my identity, and it is why I serve people. I would love to once again work in an environment where I know I am helping to build a better world.
