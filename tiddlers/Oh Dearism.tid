Resignation is, I believe, one of the more destructive moods that can infect our psyches and our bodies. This is because unlike its nasty sisters resentment and cynicism, resignation lacks much of the emotional force that can allow us to at least isolate and observe its negative consequences. Resignation is more subtle and is often disguised as “being practical or realistic,” and justified based on common sense.
