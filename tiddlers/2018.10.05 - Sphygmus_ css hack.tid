title: 2018.10.05 - Sphygmus: css hack

saw your comment about a fixed sidebar - it's a super hacky solution, but:

.tc-dropzone {
     height: 100vh;
}
.tc-story-river {
     overflow: auto;
}
.tc-sidebar-scrollable {
     overflow: auto;
}

will make the sidebar stay fixed, when added to the proper spots in [[$:/plugins/sphygmus/core/stylesheet/flexbox]]. it's ugly in the smaller screen sizes b/c I don't add padding to the sidebar to account for the scrollbar in the middle of the river (and ugly b/c of the scrollbar in the middle but i'm not sure right now how to fix that... :/) but yeah, it should do the basic trick!
