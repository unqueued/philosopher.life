*[[2020.04.09 - h0p3ful Review: I'm Shutting The Hell Up Now]]
** I will never shut the fuck up, my love.
*[[2020/04/09 -- Wiki Log]]
** ᵥₑᵣᵧ very ⅄ᴚƎᴧ ^^very^^ ^^ᵛᵉʳʸ^^
** I can appreciate that problem. Finding a good relationship between your realtime speaking and writing takes time.
** I got it: worth less. 
** I thought the tofu should have been cubed smaller. Texture, surface area, salt.
** I have no idea what it means to dive into the world of RPing. Still, I hope you take risks.
** I don't know what to think on moral [[certainty]].
*[[2020.04.09 - YTDL]]
** What a neat [[TDL]] to have. 
*[[2020/04/09 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: Prosperity Gospel, Again]]
** Does this imply indirect prosperity gospel? Perhaps in some contexts. I don't see why it must. This could be about other kinds of "meant to be" in a figurative manner. 
*** It's fine that you don't like any of them, but you need to argue against the various interpretations, right?
** How do you know? Like, if you stop manually doing it, it might not automatically do it...
** You sound really high and mighty. You could down from that inhaler. 
*[[2020/04/09 -- Prompted Introspection: Pass the Buck]]
** Why should I think there's no incentive to act correctly in at least some cases where there is no punishment? Even the unjust person with the [[ROG]] is going to act as the just person in at least some cases. 
*** Is that air you are breathing? Manually?
** [[blame]]...You should link to words you have attempted to define. 
*** I'm not [[certain]] this will be useful, but there's a [[chance]] it will do a lot of work for you.
**** My [[bias]]ed [[belief]] is that it will sometimes help you more efficiently and safely speak about [[abstractions]].
**** Go on, please [[change]] your entry to at least make it more [[aesthetic]]ally pleasing.
** Don't forget to [[alias]] that shit.
*[[2020/04/09 -- Life Log]]
** I'm surprised you didn't feel they were helpful to you. They light up so much for me, and they give me things to attack.
*** Yeah, I feel like I helped you dissect those quotes. Maybe some [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] is in order here?
*[[2020/04/09 -- To-Do List Log]]
** VIXI sounds like the place to light up.
** I am still annoyed by your computing infrastructure. I hope it will annoy you enough to regret waiting any longer to fix it. It's a much, much bigger deal than having a messy room.
*[[How To Make a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich]]
** I didn't get to eat a PBJ from this. =(.
*** Yeah, I'm an asshole about the directions. Even with your personal guidance, I just failed. Sorry. 
** I hope this will be a useful metaphor for us.
*** If all it did was make you hate PBJ, something went wrong.
**** I don't know that you are kidding. I'm autistic. Doofus. =)
*[[The Science of Well-Being]]
** Sick.
*** I'm so glad to see you taking the initiative here.
** Questionnaire didn't stand up to scrutiny, but I like it.
** I can't wait until you start making tiddlers for other topics, for each day, for a test, etc. Making a clean workspace for subprojects and so forth.
*** This course is very short though. You'll want to be liberal, loose, and wandering in how you prepare, digest, draft, and evolve the structures of your thinking and feelings in school (which is not to say you should be lazy about it).

** [[Morning routine's 2017/03 journal]] looks like single log file toward a [[Morning Routine.tmpl]]. 
** [[2018/04/10 -- Hyperreading Log]]: allowing your mind to wander is something I hold in extremely high regard, as you know. Thinking about the purpose of such wandering is part of doing it well.
