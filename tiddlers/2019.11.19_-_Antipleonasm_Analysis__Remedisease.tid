!! Respond to the following gem:

:    The remedy is often worse than the disease. Burn not your house to rid it of the mouse. Action taken to put something right is often more unpleasant or damaging than the original problem.

This obtains in many circumstances. What's striking to me about it is how rarely I consider it fitting where others might. Usually, most problems have multiple possible solutions, and I often find people are unwilling to even contemplate the possibility of some particular solutions in a meaningful way. I'm [[Straussian]]ly paranoic about how this phrase is wielded because some wield it to dismiss out of hand actually trying to solve a problem. Applied correctly, this is a kindness. It's the kind of move that tells me a great deal about someone's virtue of a practice.
