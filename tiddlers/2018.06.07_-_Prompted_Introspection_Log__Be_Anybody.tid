title: 2018.06.07 - Prompted Introspection Log: Be Anybody

!! If you could be anybody, who would you be?

I suppose I'm supposed to stoically answer: myself. What other option do I really have? This subversive window question is meant to lead me back to my own home, right? 

I don't know what it would mean to be someone else. You have to lay it out for me. Am I just thrown into their general context while maintaining my mind? Wouldn't I be recognized for not being truly them? Do I take on their mind? The Star Trek/Parfit identity problems abound. I have not resolved them. 

The identity problems are so profound they control what answer I should give all by themselves. I don't have them...yet. I do hope one day to have a very strong point of view on the matter though. I'm still slowly giving my thought to my fundamental philosophy. While Personal Identity is definitely part of it, it's somehow a problem that I have to answer after having put my tentpegs down in other areas first. I'm going to table the problem for now, and I think that's fine.
