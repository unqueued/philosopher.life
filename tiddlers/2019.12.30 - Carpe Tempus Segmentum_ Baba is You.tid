title: 2019.12.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Baba is You

* Woke at 10?
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Clean
* Bliss
* Chilled with folks
* Nap
* Worked on Yale paperwork
* Hit the arcade with the offspring
** Many discussions arose out of this experience. What would normally be an absolute waste of my time and money paid dividends today. I'm glad we've had practice and a vocabulary to reason about it thoroughly.
* Called my brother [[JRE]].
** We talked about people holding our junk and laughed. 
** He's doing okay, but he sounds very sad.
** Conversation ended kind of abruptly, and I think he had a long day.
* BBQ chicken, veggies, mac'n'cheese, potatoes
* Baba is You
** Pirated after watching my offspring continue to enjoy it. Hopefully, they'll continue. 
** Offspring got hooked, and now I'm having fun with it. It's a good use of their time.
* Jackbox
** There's a game about fibbing where you imitate others. I regularly gave the exact answer the target themselves chose. Nifty. This wasn't Apples to Apples in guessing what others will claim to like in a public context (it was fill in the blank); it was a test about what they would say (with limits on signaling).
