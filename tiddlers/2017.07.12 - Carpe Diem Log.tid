title: 2017.07.12 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up right before the alarm clock, woot! 
* My lymph nodes were swollen, and my hand has an allergy rash on it. It has been there all day. Very bumpy and itchy. I can't think of what it is causing it. I'll have to think more.
* I worked very hard.
* I had a barrage of phone calls with Johanna and Tim.
* I talked to Barry, and I met Terry's second son.
* I got to know Jaye really well today. I'm glad to have made a friend!
* I talked to my wife, to my children, and to my brother. It's wonderful to be able to talk to them.
** I'm going to fuck the living shit out of my wife when I see her next. Me so horny. I'm happy to earn my redwings again (delicious).
*** Maybe that's why she was off last Saturday?
* I talked to Armstrong a bit while he cooked dinner for himself. He's picking up a side job at Best Buy? He makes $30/hour, so I find this 10$/hour job odd. There are obviously better ways to spend his time in my view, even if money is the sole goal (which he claims it isn't, but he's also not very well-integrated and coherent in many respects...the move from dirt poor to upper-lower or lower-middle class has fucked with his identity and belief system very hard). 
** He was on the phone with his router/modem combo's company. I offered help and some mineral water (cause I want this). He is illiterate, so I did it for him. A signal problem from the ISP they say (or passing the buck). Armstrong's working on that too.
* I'm not feeling so hungry, but may I will tomorrow.
* My nose is bleeding on the outside and pus comes out. UV radiation sucks. My brother suggests sunblock. Umm, good idea! Thank you!
* Fireman time, goddamnit!
