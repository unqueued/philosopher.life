title: 2018.04.05 - Le Reddit Log: MLK Wearing Nice Clothes

Wearing clothing is usually rhetoric, and quite obviously a form of manipulation in this case. Normally I'm opposed to manipulation, especially if it plays off our animal instincts, blink-of-an-eye inductive reasoning, and lizard-brains. I worry it does not hedged-conservatively respect the dignity of persons, but perhaps this is the only way to enable them to exercise their autonomy to do the right thing. I'm in no position to deny the necessity of manipulation in this case, even if it means treating others as mere means to some degree.
