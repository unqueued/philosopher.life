title: 2019.12.29 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Honesty Policy

!! Respond to the following gem:

: Honesty is the best policy.

Best [[gfwiwcgws]]? [[The Moral Law]] is the only policy that unconditionally matters by definition.

Honesty is an extremely expensive policy in some contexts, but [[good]]will is a priceless jewel. It appears honesty admits of [[dok]], and it can be surprisingly unintuitive in some contexts. There are also circumstances in which honesty is not required, or not completely, or that deception is necessary or permitted to some [[dok]]. 

Prima facie, we have an obligation to honesty. In some overidealized paradoxical unification of all minds into a single consciousness, glass houses all the way into open qualia (which isn't possible, hence the unification requirement), we might still be able to deceive parts of ourselves, and even then, there appears to be a prima facie obligation to honesty. 

But, it is also clear that we are morally obligated to deceive, and that is a fundamentally hard problem in moral philosophy. It requires a ton of philosophy of mind and language on top of the usual metaethical problems. Overall, it is the best policy, particularly given our tendency toward particular vices and temptations without it.
