title: 2019.11.27 - Prompted Introspection: Cig and Alc Ads

!! What effects do cigarette and alcohol advertising have on young people?

None. They don't advertise to young people. Don't you know that? That would be illegal (which is logically equivalent to being immoral, of course). Oh, Samwise, you are still killing me: [[2018.03.09 - Prompted Introspection Log: Cig and Alc Ads]]. 

Some percentage of my public children understand the value of vaping as a lifestyle and as a kernel to an authentic identity. They know better than to smoke that 'backy because they've been taught to reason very critically about the dangers of cancer. Their choice to enslave themselves (with extra steps) for ~25 years to nicotine companies is their right as an American; their rebellion has been commodified, but it's so fully real. You son of a bitch, I'm in.

I'll agree that advertising is not as effective as our Overlord's advertise to those may purchase advertisement space. Lipstick and rouge. The bubbles still cause plenty of damage. The amount of ads my youth see all around them is disgusting. I wouldn't even know how to quantify it though.
