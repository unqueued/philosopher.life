title: 2020.01.20 - Prompted Introspection: Anti-Natalism

!! I wish I never??

~~Had to answer this particular question.~~

This question could be interpreted to be about finding myself in circumstances outside of my control. It's way more valuable to look at my largest mistakes.

I wish I never had created human beings, especially at such a young age. I've become an anti-natalist after realizing just how fucked we are. I [[love]] my children, and I even //*gasp*// __like__ them in many cases. I'm devoted to them; I've sacrificed for them. All else being equal, if there was a way for me to have adopted them, that would have been ideal. There are, of course, other epistemic mistakes (though I think I only share partial blame) which led to procreation.
