title: 2017.12.03 -- Wiki Audit Log: Links

* [[Links]]
** This is a beast, and frankly, a huge embarrassment. I don't know how to solve the problem. That said, at least I have the [[Link Log]] going.
** I'm working on a script to import my old bookmarks.
** It is cleaned up. I'm still not in love with it, but it is a new start.
* [[People]]
** Yet another serious disappointment. But, I can't expect perfection. It's okay that it sits in shambles. I've been putting my effort in more important areas of this wiki. I've been working on myself too much to worry about writing this section. It has been a hell of a year. 
** I've retired it to the vault of {[[Focus]]}. I'll pick it up sometime later perhaps.
* [[Philosophy]]
** Now that I have [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]] and [[Art]] sufficiently squared away, I am now in a much better position to arrange this.
