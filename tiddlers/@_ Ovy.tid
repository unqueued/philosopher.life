2019.06.29 - @Ovy: Lol! Si eres un campesino, soy un tonto. You are being way too hard on yourself. You gotta start somewhere, homie, and you are courageously jumping headfirst into deep water; it's going to take time to get where you are going (never give up!). I'm also not always great at explaining things (which is my fault), but it is my honor to be useful to you. Aside: politically, peasants are the people I care about. I can see that you care about the poor and needy in your vocation. Also, this is a tiddler which you may find worth bookmarking (you can even open all the tiddlers you want on a single tab and make a single bookmark of them all); I communicate over my wiki.

You must see me as an ignorant peasant!

Ok, let's do email, for now. ooc1992@gmail.com

2019.06.29 - @Ovy: The wiki you get to access is read-only. I run the writeable server at home. E-mail is likely your best long-form communications channel until you can run your own public webserver (or use something like gitpages, which is what I use).

2019.06.29 - @h0p3: I responded at the wiki but I don't know if it went through.
