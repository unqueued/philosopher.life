title: 2018.09.22 -- Wiki Audit: The Win Button

So [[Sphygmus]] has built an entire plugin for me! [[Auto-Wiki-Mator-Button]] is very cool. It was easy to install, and I'm still trying to figure out how best to make use of it. There are some hiccups in title.Title that makes it so that it's currently still faster for me to just use my old process. With a couple tweaks, there's no way it could be faster though. It handles 95% of what I'm trying to do out of the gate. It's a badass plugin. I'm excited to start using Tags too.
