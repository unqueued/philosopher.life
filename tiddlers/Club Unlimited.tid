title: Club Unlimited

//[[AIR]] and I should do this.//

* Unlimited bar
** We make our own alcohol: beer and liquor
*** We charge for mixed drinks
** Free cheap food
*** We still charge for premium food
*** Soda, alcohol and nice semi-disposable washable cups are cheap.
*** Celebrate grain alcohol!
* Members only (but anyone can join)
** Third-party arbitration clause
** Sign a permanent and complete liability release waiver to join the club
** They can lose membership for any reason with no recourse.
** Sign a contract which enables us to escort them off the premise for any reason whatsoever
** Setup legal financial accounts when joining the club
*** If they are charged a fee, then they legally owe us that money
*** Users must still earn the right to have a tab/credit-line
*** Background checks to make sure we think they can pay
**** This requires a waiver too
* How we make money:
** One-time Membership Fee (Joining Deposit Insurance fee)
*** This fee could just be folded into the entrance fee. Much thought will need to be given. 
*** Calculate a reasonable max cost they would owe. They have to deposit it as a form of trust. If they are ever removed as members, this deposit covers it. 
** Upfront Entrance fee
*** We need to know average costs of each night. We can chart and calculate this. It will be adjustable or scale. 
*** Loyalty bonus. The fee costs less each time you come. 
**** This offsets costs going up.
**** Linear ride into an exponential curve bottoming out towards the "at cost" line (or at least a minimum profit line)
*** Perhaps we can stagger how their credit-building works in a tit-for-tat trust building game.
** Clean-up fee (contingent/conditional)
*** If you puke, defacate, or must be escorted off the premise (for any reason), then you must pay a very serious fee.
*** For anything you break, you are financially responsible for paying for its replacement.
** Take-your-drunk-ass home service fee
*** We can have our own designated driver taxi service.
*** We make the final call on whether or not you are too inebriated (to have more to drink or to have enough to drive).
*** We will test you with a breathalyser. 
**** Need cheap consistent breathalyser methods.
* How do we make cheap entertainment?
** Video games are retarded cheap. Have a free arcade. 
** Computer and Desk Cafe
*** Multi-seat computers
* Do we have different sections? 
** Arcade Room
*** Users could pay for accounts on the computers.
** The Blast Room
*** Loud, danceable.
*** Sound proof rooms.
** The Analogue Lounge (hipster and luddite af)
*** Modern art and books
*** No devices allowed (They must be given to the host), or faraday cage the room. 
** Tabletop Room
*** MTG, board games, DND, etc.
*** Jenga, Twister (permanent), 3D-printed games, Cards Against Humanity, Actual playing cards (with rules available)
** Dining section (quiet)
* We need an aesthetic. What will it be?
* We need a schtick. What will it be?

Of course, we need to consider to how to build moral business structures first. The socialist worker cooperation corporation model.


Who do we need to run this?

* We need someone who handles legal, financial, executive planning, etc. Someone who implements the will of the people.
* We need muscle, bounce, and man-handlers; these should also be our designated taxi drivers.
** We have a cage to take the shitty ones home
** We need handcuffs
* We need hosts, cooks, drink-makers, and clean-up staff.
* We need someone who plans and executes the culture, entertainment, the technical components, the social atmosphere, the aesthetic, the culinary aspects.

Staff should be cross-trained as much as possible. We should have designated training during each day. Everyone should learn to do as much of everyone else's jobs as they possibly can. Make it easy for people to be replaced (even if only temporarily). Make it so everyone is worth the same amount. Make it so we all deserve an equal cut of the profits.  

Other random thoughts:

* Mandatory voting, transparency, and internal conflict resolution at the end of the day. We need to be on the same page and share the same vision.<<ref "1">>
