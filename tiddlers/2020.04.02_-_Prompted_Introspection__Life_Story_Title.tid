title: 2020.04.02 - Prompted Introspection: Life Story Title

!! If you had to write your life story, what would the title be? Why?

This question is still interesting to me, despite not having a much better answer than [[2018.07.01 - Prompted Introspection: Life's Story Entitled]]. //⦗h0p3's Wiki⦘// is probably more accurate. It captures the bracketing concept I hold so dearly in my [[Question Everything]] {[[axiom]]}. I have to admit that [[The Name]] does do some kind of work though, and I was wrong to dismiss it too quickly. For now, I have a lame and tentative title, and maybe that's all I will be able to muster.
