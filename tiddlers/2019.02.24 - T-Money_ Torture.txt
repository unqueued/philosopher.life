God damn, that is a rough story.
SUN 10:30 AM
I'm sorry about your head.
SUN 10:30 AM
I've been thinking about what you've said.
SUN 10:30 AM
It must be a kind of torture not to be able to share everything you are thinking, feeling, and experiencing with your wife. =(
SUN 10:31 AM
That's the way I feel when I don't get to express myself to my wife.
SUN 10:35 AM
It is a lie to protect her. If she knew the truth she old worry about me more.<<ref "2020.02.25-1">>
SUN 11:45 AM
Maybe she should worry more about you.
SUN 11:45 AM
As as that claim is that is how I feel if about it. And I prefer her to be in my shit.
SUN 11:46 AM
She already is... It's not a unknown fact that I am slightly mentally unstable.
SUN 11:47 AM
But I am not a hazord to myself.
SUN 11:47 AM
Except for maybe that one funny story. Lol
SUN 11:47 AM
Lol. I hear ya.
SUN 11:47 AM
I'm still going to champion honesty to you.
SUN 11:47 AM
Honesty. Drinking it my problem. I was drinking hard liquor. Nothing good could come from that.<<ref "2020.02.25-2">>
SUN 11:48 AM
I afraid this truth stay in the confines of me you Williams and Russell.
SUN 11:49 AM
Who both through ally enjoyed a good. Laugh with me. Cause they have been there.
SUN 11:49 AM
Aye! I have been there too. I got drunk several times this week.
SUN 11:50 AM
He drank way to. Much Thursday night, took extra Adderall and then as a complete asshole (he always is) and p ked in his sleep.
SUN 11:51 AM
We joked and bonded over pissing in covers while the wife screams at you.
SUN 11:52 AM
Yeah. Liquor is bad for me. Bust I gotta test it. I did so well took! And fucking old duster took me down!
SUN 11:53 AM
When I was 21, I puked in our bed. =(...I guess I don't mind puking so much as the fact that my wife cleaned up after me. That is where I am guilty.
SUN 11:53 AM
I hit the duster a couple. Of times in front of my wife the bother.night. We both laughed.
SUN 11:53 AM
That ol' duster will take anyone down! Lol.
SUN 11:53 AM
That's the highest high I have ever reached was on duster.
SUN 11:54 AM
Double Hitting one right after another.
SUN 11:54 AM
I forgot the golfer rule. Sit down.
SUN 11:54 AM
Golden
SUN 11:54 AM
Yeah. I've had my days or even weeks of guilt with the wife. And there is nothing more refreshing that waking up in a pile. Of your own vomit.
SUN 11:57 AM
It really puts life into perspective. "like you could have died"
SUN 11:57 AM

SUN 11:59 AM
I would add this sont to your compilation. Without a doubt. Ans a few other blind Melon songs.
SUN 12:00 PM
=)
SUN 12:00 PM
Thank you.
SUN 12:00 PM
Unfortunately, I don't care about lyrics, and I try not to.
SUN 12:01 PM
Ah. Gotcha. My emotions run high on song lyrics
SUN 12:01 PM
It is a good song no less.
SUN 12:03 PM
=l
SUN 12:03 PM
I only want the sound to own me. I am worried about paying too much credence to words which exist so their speakers can make money. Lyrics are rhetorical devices, powerful emotional button pushers, but I'm not convinced that cathartic experience is worth building myself around.
SUN 12:03 PM
I appreciate that. I realize most people love lyrics in music.
SUN 12:03 PM
Not all. My wife is not a lyric person. And it drives me nuts. Cause I've memorized every lyric but she remembers movies and actors. Where I can literally just "let it Go"
SUN 12:05 PM
I can't listen to a song without the melody and lyrics. Generally the singer is also a musician in the band. Who created then song.
SUN 12:08 PM
But I'm old school, I use to only listen to whole albums front to back.<<ref "2020.02.25-4">>
SUN 12:09 PM
Because that's how the artist intended it
SUN 12:09 PM
I am interested in the context of art to an extent, but usually I use the aesthetic as a tool for achieving what I take to be morally significant. I use music as a tool, to space out and come back into focus on what I'm working on with more intuition or the insights which arise from giving my unconscious processes a space and time to work on it. It's a drug for enabling me to reason more effectively.
SUN 12:11 PM
I use it cause it makes me feel less alone.
SUN 12:15 PM
It identifies my perspectives and outlooks and makes pretty sounds with them.
SUN 12:15 PM
It reminds me, you are not alone.
SUN 12:16 PM
I strongly appreciate that.
SUN 12:17 PM
Blind melon - walk
SUN 12:19 PM
Find myself singing the same songs everyday
Ones that make me feel good
When things behing the smiles ain't okay

Around and over and in-between the seas
I need to be on top of a mountain
Where I can be see everything
Cause this paranoia's getting old

Now as I open my eyes to start another day
I'm in a pile of puke
Empty bag of execuses
My love for friends and family
you know I need them

And under a sun that's seen it all before
My feet are so cold
And I can't believe that I have to bang my head against this wall again
But the blows they have just a little more space in-between them
Gonna take a breath and try again.
SUN 12:19 PM
Without th music it's kinda cheesy. But I hear the music in my head. And it makes my skin feel warm.
SUN 12:26 PM
This fucking kratom has me constipated.<<ref "2020.02.25-5">>
SUN 12:42 PM
I honestly think if feels like tortue. But I am a big pussy
SUN 12:42 PM
And my whole life I've been use to pooping 3 times a day!

I know this does not epitomize the Trinity. But it still makes me smile

SUN 5:38 PM
New favorite.
SUN 5:38 PM
Looks like a magic card?
SUN 5:38 PM
Yugioh
SUN 5:39 PM
Lol.
SUN 5:39 PM
Even better.
