title: 2019.02.26 - Prompted Introspection: Growin' Up

!! Where did you grow up? Describe what it was like?

It's difficult for me to determine where I grew up. We moved fairly often, and so I don't have enough roots to call any particular place "where I grew up." I usually pick Mannsville, KY though.

There may have been 600ish people in the town. Everyone knew everyone. Many lived in poverty. There were a couple wealthy families, but there were a bunch kids who barely got enough to eat.

Drugs, drug-muling, teenage pregnancy, tobacco farming, trailers, fishing, 4-wheelers, hunting, and UK basketball defined the lives of so many people. We regularly had helicopters flying over the hills and fields looking for cannabis plants to burn down. Farmers would grow it on the edges of other people's adjacent property, right on the property lines. Everyone was in on it.

People found ways to live off disability, and they didn't read. They were good at virtue signaling as conservatives. Farmers with millions of dollars of capital in their land and equipment would tell you they were the poorest of the poor. Almost nobody actually gave a shit about anyone else, unless it benefited them.
