Studying my wiki allows me to commit its details and structure to long-term memory in significant ways. Repeated exposure matters! I'm looking to be an expert on myself, but also to become someone who can pass messages in a variety of contexts and dimensions. I want to get "set in my ways," so that that salience jumps out at me from the screen without my attending to it first somehow.
