* Family Time!
* You need to prep something for school. Probably switch up the IP on the phone and use it for now. I'm not a fan of bringing the laptop until things settle down.
* Probably need to do some more reading and writing.
** I like that you are picking up more serious books and reading LOTR for pleasure alone.
* Sushi? 
** The females will be gone. My son and I will prepare dinner because we won't have much time left for family time. 6-10pm at best. We have to make it count.
* Read and Write. You can't just WoW.
