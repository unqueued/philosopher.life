!! What things do you think are beautiful?

The Being and Meaning of [[The Beautiful]] stand in dialectical opposition to [[The Right]] to some [[dok]]. This isn't, of course, to say [[The Right]] isn't beautiful in many cases, but there are spaces in which they peel apart, are contrary to each other, and give rise to contradictions. There is an eternal essence to [[beauty]] into [[The Infinite]] ideality which encompasses all possible perspectives (except [[The Good]] as presumed sublation of all else), but who could possibly know such a thing? It is a form of speculative realism that I claim we have any access to that fundamental building block to the Thingiest Thing in [[Itself]] (but it is also non-sense to say we do not; perception exists qua it!). As the "is" of the "ought," the black flatness and marble slab of necessity has within it the algorithm that self-referentially picks out what is [[salient]] in [[itself]]. [[The Object]]'s self-justification and self-explanation force me to reckon with my mysticism.

For a thing to obtain without it being [[Right]] must logically imply at least some [[beauty]] to it. I suggest [[beauty]] is in nearly everything to some [[dok]], and perhaps everything (or at least a result of it). I simply don't know. Ah, but here I am stuck with Saints GÃ¶del and Spinoza. [[The Good]], in fact, must reside to some [[dok]] in all that exists. To posit a positive property shuts the door on us with the ontological argument's modal collapse into the necessity of everything. This alone destroys [[The Right]], right? ^^right?^^ I am, yet again, unable to speak logically about contingency. My construction continues to fold in on itself. I cannot believe I'm turning into a fucking quietist on this. Kill me now. I am silenced, at least for a little while.
