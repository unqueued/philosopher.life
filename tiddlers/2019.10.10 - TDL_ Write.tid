title: 2019.10.10 - TDL: Write

* Write, write, write, right?
** Catchup first.
* Ribs, wedges, veggies, melon
* DTF
* Your living room got trashed again. Fix it.
* Interview practice.
* You've not been communicating nearly as much with your brother since you've been off the game (he seems to have dropped it as well to some extent).
** I wish we could surf the web together.
