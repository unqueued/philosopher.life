title: 2019.05.13 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Spectation

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Spectator sports make people more passive, because you're not doing them—you're watching somebody doing them...the stupefying effect spectator sports have in making people passive, atomized, obedient nonparticipants—nonquestioning, easily controlled and easily disciplined.

Preach, yo! I have a similar theory about people who adore dogs; it's a terrible sign. I say this as someone who has watched his fair share of standard spectator sports and petted many dogs. I've watched some superbowls on TV, I've attended some baseball games and even a basketball game, I've watched almost every major MMA organization, I watch people play vidya games, and I enjoy e-sports. I try not to act on it, but I aim to draw lessons from my mistakes.

Spectation isn't limited to sportsball either. The parallel of this has been said for every generation, I am sure (and this as well, [[ITS]]): many behaviors and structures of the postmodern world exist to provide people the comfort and stability of predictive confidence and stability with pits of drug addiction. It's a trap, a worldclass one. Being a mere spectator, a leech, and not taking the responsibility to shape yourself and the world [[irwartfrr]] has always been a problem, but the temptation is greater than ever (especially as the Crisis of Capitalism continues to squeeze us).

I am wary of sheeple, shepherds, npcs, and devs. There are profound moral laws in this simulation (justified eudaimonia aint easy), but otherwise, I'm going to take the game to its limits in my own retarded way. Who the fuck is going to play the game as the devs initially intended? They just want your money, and they certainly don't know nearly as much about the game as you do. Go kick dialectical ass. Anoint yourself.
