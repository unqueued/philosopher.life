*** My only point of major contention: Derrida and Foucault (though he attempts to deny it) are postmodern.

*** Ouch.

*** I still don't know. The problem is bigger than stated. We trade and borrow in our own currency. Perhaps the world is moving away from the dollar. I don't see this person really giving a shit about the poor either.
