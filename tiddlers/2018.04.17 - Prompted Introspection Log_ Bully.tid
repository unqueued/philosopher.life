!! When someone picks on someone else, how do you feel? What do you do?

It depends on the context, as always. What are the motivations, explanations, justifications, [[agi]] concerns, etc.? Obviously, I will feel bad when I think injustice has occurred. What I will do depends on what is within my power, on the value of each of my actions, etc. That's the best generalization I can give without resorting to casuistry to illustrate my perspective.
