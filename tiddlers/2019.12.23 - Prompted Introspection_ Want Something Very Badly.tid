title: 2019.12.23 - Prompted Introspection: Want Something Very Badly

!! How do you feel when you want something very badly and you cannot have it? Why is this so important to have?

It depends on what that thing is and why I want it. I have many [[dok]] of desires. I feel unsatisfied at the very least. Why I don't get what I want can have a huge influence on my feelings as well, and my feelings can change quite a bit over time. I do spend time figuring out [[W5H]] the object of my desire is important to have. If I can determine it's unreasonable to want it, I can learn to set that desire aside (though, what I find reasonable is often considered insane).
