title: 2019.04.18 - TDL: Do It!

* Day off. Maybe we should go out and do something?
** I've already granted the kids the day off from school too. Congratz, offspring.
* I want to understand my wife's take on social media now.
* Walking would be good.
* [[Hugs]] needs something. I'll send it to her afterward.
* [[m16]] is right there. Cmon!
