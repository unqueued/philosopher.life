You too, homie. =)

What are your plans? Will you succeed in your attempt to take over the world?
TUE 10:08 AM
As long as those meddling kids stay far away!
TUE 10:12 AM
Haha. Work and writing. ;)
TUE 10:12 AM
What about you?

Finishing letters to DeathOfRobinhood and Kickscondor

Working on Greek and Latin roots (and vocab) for the kiddos too.

[[L]] and I finally filled our freezer with tons of frozen foods. Only took a year of living at our new place. So that’s nice.
TUE 10:13 AM
Yay!
TUE 10:13 AM
Okay this might be really nerdy but I love root words.
TUE 10:13 AM
Me too!
TUE 10:14 AM
They helped me understand how to write at all. I think it will solidify things for [[j3d1h]], and I'm hoping it will be the computational material [[1uxb0x]] needs to make progress. I'd be lost without my root map.
TUE 10:15 AM
They’re so good. ^_^
TUE 10:29 AM
I love that they can help perceive meaning in words even if you don’t know it beforehand.
TUE 10:29 AM
Have a wonderful day. :)
