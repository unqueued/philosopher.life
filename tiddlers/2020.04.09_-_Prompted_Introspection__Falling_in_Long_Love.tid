title: 2020.04.09 - Prompted Introspection: Falling in Long Love

!! Describe what it was like to fall in love.

I recall [[T-Money]] telling me that if it were any one else getting married in that timeframe, he'd have called them crazy: [[2018.07.11 - Prompted Introspection: Falling in Love]]. I should add that falling in love is something that has occurred year-over-year. We get to look back at many years of marriage now, and the story is breathtaking. What's it like falling in love over decades? I'm trying to capture it. 

It's surreal. There's nothing else like it. It's a mix of pair-bonding existential monomorphism and tournament species dimorphism. We build together. Sometimes, it's just us vs. everything. The highest highs and the lowest lows together.
