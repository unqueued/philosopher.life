title: 2019.07.16 - Prompted Introspection: Award Me, Plz

!! Tell about an award you have received.

When Clinton was president, I received "Presidential" academic achievement awards. The signature looked real to me, so that I thought it was real. I totally deserved an award for something...

I kept those with a bunch of other awards in a drawer for a long time. I'm not one for attending my own graduations at this point. Who gives a fuck? I'm here to rock out with my cock out. I only need that fucking piece of paper so I can signal to people that I'm, like, totally legit, bro. Spare me the credentialism, the approval-seeking, the lies, and capitalist commodification of my identity. 

I wonder if one day I will come full circle. I don't know what kind of award would stick. I hope it comes with booze, my precious.
