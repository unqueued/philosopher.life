* Disconfirm My Bias

*** I will keep my eyes peeled.

*** An avenue which I should know much better about. I saw countless people travel to Thailand for it. The market should have been obvious to me.

* Think About It
** https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/aoc-isnt-interested-american-exceptionalism/592213/?
*** I have no idea if and what we will do about it. I can get only to a limited place of skepticism with most people. 
** https://www.fatherly.com/love-money/parenting-is-a-scam-on-american-middle-class-family/
*** Not just the middle class! That is a huge mistake. The prescription is weak, and I think they did such a good job of getting us to the doorstep of a socialist critique without actually stepping over the threshold.
*** I am extremely worried about the survival of my children in the collapse of capitalism. I'm required to be an Asian Tiger Dad, and we push fairly hard. I teach a great deal which capitalists and professional educators find irrelevant though.

*** Significant wealth and income inequality is going to end up being evil.
** http://freeworldeconomicreport.com/the-human-cost-of-recovery-were-burning-out/
*** Minimum wage does help the workers though. I'm fine with trying to find ways to make it so power doesn't centralize though. The asymmetries are causing a contradiction.

* Fishy
** https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/boomers-are-blame-aging-america/592336/
*** That looks like neoliberalism disguised to me. It's weird to see blame misdirected through this rhetoric.
