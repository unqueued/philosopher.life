* Mandalas are looking sick.
** The sticker idea is wonderful.
** I can tell it is not easy for me to see where everything is going. I had no idea what to expect, lol.

This is a heavy log. You are tackling crazy hard problems in here.

<<<
"The key is to be able to step outside of that feedback loop,"
<<<

I sometimes think those thought loops are part of the process of what makes me good at analyzing things. They can be detrimental though. Breaking out of thought loops is hard work. This is part of why I'm trying to learn how to meditate. 

<<<
I don't know if writing them down will get them out of my head, so to speak, or if it will be like pouring fuel on the fire and giving them legitimacy.
<<<

I have found that some get worse and some get better with writing. I don't know the rule.

<<<
I feel afraid of all the uncertainty that comes with being human and having the freedom to make choices and weaving my life in with other humans who also have that freedom and those choices.
<<<

I have had professors who didn't believe they phenomenologically experienced real freedom more than a handful of times in their lifetime. I'm curious to know if you have incompatibilist tendencies.

<<<
I don't know how to listen and believe or trust myself because what if it's all just hormonal emotions and doesn't mean anything???? What if it's just the oxytocin bond â€“ and what if the limitations of my brain make it so I can't imagine anything different than my current situation and make it so I don't want to give up my comfort and I confabulate that into being "the voice of my inner self"?
<<<

Oh. Now that is a fantastically difficult problem. Absurdly hard. I have no acceptable answer for myself. I think shooting to become a compatibilist might help you. I tried and failed, but some people seem to be able to make the jump. Start looking around. I don't know how deep down that rabbithole you want to go. I can't speak to how the frontal lobes play into this one for you.

I take my freedom on faith at this point. It's paranoic and sometimes I don't want to feel free either. 

Let me say: this was the redflag for me. It's one of the reasons I left academic philosophy. I am not sure if I am of use to you or not. Unfortunately, my style of philosophy remains deconstructive and not nearly constructive enough in this area. I am working hard. 

One thing is clear: you care about your life much further down than most people I know. These are not questions they ask themselves (which is insane to me). I think it's important to remind you that sensitivity is linked to intelligence. You are going to have strong emotional reactions that others aren't going to have because they simply weren't aware of the problem in the first place. It's easy to hold yourself to too high a standard here, imho. `/hug`

This awareness log is amazing. You post so few of them! Ofc, Mazeway and Awareness logs are my favorite. I can't help it.

I'm hoping to eventually see your take on various dark patterns.

the religion screams out and burns me. Those do not feel like my words; I can only see the fervency as a coping mechanism.
<<<

Do you still believe in metaphysics? I am interested to know if you still consider yourself religious or spiritual. It may be part of the freewill wrestling you have, on top of trying to give an account of your [[4DID]]. You have a real self-wrestling in here. I'm sorry it's so painful. This shit is hard.

Will be asking [[k0sh3k]] for my chillun here too. Thank you for the list.

I'm having a hard time explaining it too. Someone recently called my wiki an "Ocean of Crazy." I don't know how to reduce down an ocean nicely. Maybe it just won't reduce nicely and will be sprawling. 

I feel like we open one door to defining this thing, and 2 more pop up.

I realize this is [[/b/]]ed. I'm going comment on this thing that I know you have not committed yourself to. 

You are definitely feeling the intense, paranoic vertigo of the experience. We chatted about it today. 

Imho, you should be damned proud of all the work you've done. Those of us reading aren't laughing. I certainly take you seriously.

!!! 

<<<
We are walking in a desert - barren, parched, empty. For as far as the eye can see, there is nothing but sky and dirt. The cracks at our feet spread in all directions, and the howling wind lifts loose dirt up and flings it across the landscape. Suddenly, we stumble onto what seems to be a path. All the cracks have been filled, and the dirt is tamped down firm. Each side has been carefully lined with stones. We walk along the trail for hours. Where does it go? Does it ever end? Finally, we see a speck in the distance. As we get close, it becomes a small hut made of stick, with the cracks filled with mud, and the roof of dry grass, woven together...
<<<

You have to tell me what's happening here. Please! =)

decentralization of power is like herd immunity against assholes.

`/snip` into the [[Redpilled Socialist Quips]] you go.

The wiki is growing in many directions. This was the most expressive read through yet. Thank you for taking the time to bleed out of the screen. I appreciate your willingness to wrestle with yourself that hard.

I need to take up exercise too. I hope running is helping.
