title: 2017.12.04 -- Prompted Introspection Log: The Water Incident

!! Describe an incident that had something to do with water.

This is not easy to choose. I have several sexual experiences that stand out to me (love reliving that and thinking about what it means). There are other existential experiences that appear to be excellent candidates as well. Water permeates many stories of my life. Many of my water stories are about danger, tests of self-reliance, understanding who I am, etc., and others are almost incidental, like baptizing my children. Water has been more important to my narrative than I've given it credit for. Hrmm. Well, this is a tough one for me to pick, and I'm not going to fret over it for now. Alright, here's one:

We went whitewater rafting as a youth group. My raft had me, my mother (a common theme; there is a canoe story I may have told before as well), my friend ALM (a 550 pound man who does not pull his weight), a tiny tween girl, and our guide (I may be missing one person, but I can't see who it is). We're rafting on the roughest Class 5 section of the day, and the hardest part of it was a dangerous drop into a nasty "Hole." The guide had been prepping us for it the entire time, the water was rougher than usual too according to him, and he was obviously worried; ALM endangered the raft. 

It was a thrilling drop, and I gave everything I had to help us escape the Hole. The guide screamed at us. Even with our life-jackets, this waterfall->vortex could hold you under the water until you drowned. Eventually, we were pulled under. It was a true panic amongst everyone. I held my breath as the water kept pulling me under, I got one good breath again before being pulled under again, and then eventually found an escape. Nobody died, thankfully. We were definitely terrified, and the tween broke her arm.
