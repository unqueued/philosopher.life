title: 2020.03.18 - Prompted Introspection: Typical

!! Describe your typical day, from waking up to falling asleep.

[[2018.05.31 - Prompted Introspection Log: Typical Day]] has been typical before, and probably will be again. My world has been in massive upheaval for quite a while now.

* Wake at ~10:30
* [[Morning Routine.tmpl]]
* An attempt prioritizing [[daily.tmpl]], [[weekly.tmpl]], [[TDL: Yesterday]], and whatever comes up on the fly.
* Walk or fuck
* [[Family Gathering.tmpl]]
* Read+Write and Walk+Talk with myself into the night.
* Sleep by 3
