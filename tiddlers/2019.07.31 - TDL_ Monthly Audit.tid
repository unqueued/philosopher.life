title: 2019.07.31 - TDL: Monthly Audit

* Monthly Audit
* Continue tweaking [[m16]]. It would be nice if we could then start back onto [[m10]] and [[m17]]. 
* Chops, potatoes, veggies sound good.
* Walk with your wife. I'd like to see you exercise as well.
* We all might just doing computers this week. That's fine.
