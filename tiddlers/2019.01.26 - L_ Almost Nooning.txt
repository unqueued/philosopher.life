Morning-almost-nooning, [[h0p3]]. I wanted to let you know that despite me ever saying it enough I do love you very much. Your influence inspires me to be honest with myself and to be as empathetic as humanly possible. I really appreciate that about you. Despite the weird mental health rollercoaster I find myself in these days, it is always nice to see messages from you and remember that someone’s thinking about me.

Also, I owe you answers: I’ve had to work some long nights but can usually stop to go pick [[K]] up from school which takes a good hour and a half or so. Not ideal, but it keeps me from going insane. This week has proven better so far, despite being busy. Here’s to hoping I can stick with it. [[K]] and I are taking the next few days “off” from after-work responsibilities to binge the new Kingdom Hearts game that’s coming out today like the little degenerates we are. \o/ I think it will be good for the both of us to have time together to enjoy things.
TUE 11:29 AM
Today is proving a good mental health day for me. I took some time for introspection yesterday and had a chance to actually hang out with [[K]]. Both were very helpful for me mentally. I honestly felt like I could take on the world this morning.
TUE 11:33 AM
We actually both woke up before our alarms which NEVER happens hahaha
TUE 11:33 AM
Well thank you. That is high praise. I know it's been a crazy rollercoaster ride for you. It's my pleasure to think with and about you. I hope the KH binge will be epic. =) Hopefully, you guys are stocked with snacks and ready to rock and roll.
TUE 11:35 AM
Oh definitely. We went shopping yesterday and bought a bunch of food. \o/
TUE 11:36 AM
[[K]] is both anxious and excited. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him this worked up over a video game before lol
TUE 11:36 AM
You are set. Don't forget to stretch your fingers and blink. Keep your empty 2-liter bottles nearby.
TUE 11:37 AM
You should write about the game and experience.
TUE 11:37 AM
Like you do for D&D
TUE 11:37 AM
I appreciate that you take the time and energy to regulate your mental health. Feels like it keeps getting harder.
TUE 11:37 AM
Introspection and hanging out with the people you love (and who love you) is an outstanding use of your time (I'm biased, ofc).
TUE 11:38 AM
Hehehe.
TUE 11:38 AM
I know I need to be better about introspection. It keeps me in line.
TUE 11:39 AM
I should write about the experience.. that sounds like fun. :3
TUE 11:39 AM
Maybe I’ll “write” as [[K]] is playing. I imagine genuine reactions will be the best part of our experience.
TUE 11:40 AM
Will yall have to take turns ?
TUE 11:40 AM
Oh definitely. But I will probably let [[K]] take the reigns today because he’s had a rough time waiting hehe.
TUE 11:51 AM
And by probably I mean absolutely. >_>
TUE 11:51 AM
lol
TUE 11:52 AM
We have a snowday today.
TUE 11:55 AM
So, everyone is sitting at their desks with books and computers working.
TUE 11:55 AM
Where "desk" is the wrong word for [[j3d1h]] and [[k0sh3k]].
TUE 11:55 AM
Comfy workstation?
TUE 11:55 AM
Same difference hehe
TUE 12:02 PM
I’ve heard lots of schools to the south are calling - my boss’ kids are at home too.
TUE 12:02 PM
Hurrah impromptu days at home!
TUE 12:02 PM
(Says the person who almost exclusively works at home)
TUE 12:03 PM
It's awesome that you get to work from home. I bet you have a cool setup.
TUE 12:03 PM
Truthfully it’s kinda thrown together. But it helps with the mental health aspect and allows me to take out my frustrations in constructive ways like by cleaning. \o/
TUE 1:03 PM
Are you enjoying your snow-day with your family?
TUE 1:03 PM
Hm.
TUE 1:03 PM
As we have both known for the past half year, my words are open, and my wife reads the  words (we talk about this particular issue from time to time). One of the ways in which I know my wife is upset and yet attempting to be constructive is when she starts cleaning.
TUE 1:04 PM
I have seen ULPTs of people who actually purposely piss of their spouses to get the house clean (which is insane).
TUE 1:05 PM
Taking out ones frustrations or channeling them into construction is something I admire.
TUE 1:06 PM
Not all of us have that skill or wherewithal. I don't.
TUE 1:06 PM
It’s something I’ve had to learn. [[K]] also does it, but moreso out of habit I think.
TUE 1:07 PM
You have talked about this more than once with me too, I realize. I just haven't given enough thought to how many times I see it in the people around me.
TUE 1:07 PM
And yeah, pissing off family to get a clean house sounds insane.
TUE 1:07 PM
It’s therapeutic.
TUE 1:07 PM
Zen garden of your actual house.
TUE 1:07 PM
I will need to look for similar opportunities.
TUE 1:09 PM
I admire people with the patience to have a zen garden. The simplicity and minimalism speaks to me. I think I’m too much of a perfectionist to be able to handle one. XD
TUE 1:10 PM
And I agree. Sometimes it can be very healing to put your hand to a task that needs the passion normally saved for anger.
TUE 1:11 PM
AKA it’s easy to scrub hard when you’re angry. I hear grunting at the dirt scares it away.
