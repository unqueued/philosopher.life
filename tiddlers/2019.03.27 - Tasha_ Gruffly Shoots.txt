It's Esteban's turn to upgrade jobs. We'll have to think up one for him. I can think he would be an outstanding cruise-ship captain. Be safe and have fun while traveling.

He's also good with dogs. A puppy petting palace!

Lol it’s all good! And actually Esteban left or is leaving for Nashville today. I’m sorry you have the flu :mask: I hope you feel better. Did y’all end up gruffly shoots? Or... and please don’t mind my response time I am at work as I type not meaning to delay or anything just on the babies time :baby: :alarm_clock:
