Dumb question: why do you put stock in the MBTI framework/notion? INTJs are often convinced there's something to it. I ask because you are clearly a man who respects empirical investigation, and many people believe MBTI is borderline a coldreading scam.

Aye. INTJ seems to be the particular case. ENFP, INTP, ENTJ as well, but that may just because of how I relate to them. I wonder if other types feel the same pull of MBTI.
