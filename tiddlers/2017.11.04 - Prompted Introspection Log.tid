!! Can you buy happiness?

I hear you calling, Aristotle. I will give you my brief Straussian answer.

Define "buy" and "happiness." Do we make choices with cost+benefits to them that cause us to be happy? Seems like it.

Do you mean can we pay cash to be happy? In many contexts, yes. Cash, in our world, is often sufficient for happiness to some degree. It seems obvious that cash is also necessary for happiness in many contexts. 

It's clear that there are diminishing marginal utility returns on money. But, standard money is not the only currency we trade in. 

There are degrees and perhaps kinds of happiness (let alone a parts/whole problem). We can buy much of it with cash money, but perhaps not all. That said, it does seem necessary, even if not sufficient for the whole of happiness (but perhaps sufficient for parts). But, we can 'buy' with other currencies beyond cash.

Are there aspects of happiness that we don't pay for (buy)? Sure. Moral luck cannot be paid for, and that is necessary for happiness. But, in each person's context, there is a maximum potential degree and kind of happiness that can be achieved after we have calculated their moral luck, and then it does seem like we buy happiness. Even accounting for how moral luck is understood across our various time-slices, the ultimate answer is that, to the extent that happiness is in our control, it is something we buy. 

It is obvious that happiness requires to pay in several currencies in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, and so on and so forth.
