How is life going?
WED 2:48 PM
Hey, how's it going?
FRI 12:30 PM
It’s going well, aside from the “I can never get seem to get enough sleep” problem lol
FRI 12:31 PM
But I am generally more content and level-headed than I’ve been in awhile. :)
FRI 12:31 PM
Hooray =)...sorry about the sleep.
FRI 12:32 PM
I know that feel.
FRI 12:32 PM

Oof... sorry right back at ya. That sucks.

This first week of [[K]] back in school has been busy, but not in a terrible way.

Er, definitely** lol

You have sent me on a quest to define that adverb. I can imagine what it is like to De-Fiji something. That suffixes are going to require some thought.
FRI 12:38 PM
We're grinding away here. I'm not enjoying the slave experience, and feeling unhappy that I can't get my chillun to try recently.
FRI 12:39 PM
I have been enjoying speaking with [[BDS97]] about [[Atropos]] again. That has been nice.
FRI 12:42 PM
Sorry, got sidetracked. >_>
FRI 1:39 PM
<_<
FRI 1:40 PM
I’m sorry to hear you aren’t enjoying the slave experience though I can’t say I’m surprised.
FRI 1:44 PM
And I can’t say I particularly do either.
FRI 1:45 PM
My paycheck for 2 weeks of work: $230, lol.
FRI 1:45 PM
But hopefully you find the wiggle room you need to make it work.
FRI 1:45 PM
UGH
FRI 1:45 PM
That hurt to read...
FRI 1:45 PM
Will it improve at all?
FRI 1:46 PM
Literal wage-slavery
FRI 1:46 PM
Doesn't look like it.
FRI 1:48 PM
Being moral sucks.
FRI 1:48 PM
lol
FRI 1:49 PM
Well, yes generally.
FRI 1:53 PM
But better for all in the long run.
FRI 1:53 PM
That is not obviously true, lol.
FRI 1:53 PM
Fair point
FRI 1:55 PM
