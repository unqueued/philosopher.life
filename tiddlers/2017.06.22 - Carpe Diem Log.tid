title: 2017.06.22 - Carpe Diem Log

* My dreams were difficult again last night. I woke up fairly tired, but I woke up before the alarm clock (7 minutes).
* I got the kids and had them start on their work.
* I worked very hard today. Sweaty as fuck and tired!
* I talked to my family and even ALM at lunch. Lunch was special, I had fries and the meat of a burger.
* I worked hard. 
* I called Thompson. No go. I will keep trying.
* I called MB, no go.
* I called Charlie. We talked. 
** He said he meant to call me back, but it got so late he felt awkward about it? I told him not to worry. 
** We talked about physics. He paid me an enormous compliment in my book; he said I was the first person to understand what he was saying about an idea from CERN he had been pondering. 
** We talked about computers. He needs one. He wants to play with Python more, but his computer is literally from 1998? (hard to believe).
** I recommended a new computer, linux, and OpenCL/Cuda since he loves to draw mathematical objects and complex things.
* My daughter lost her computer somehow in the house. I helped her look for it. We still haven't' found it. Good news: we got some cleaning done.
* I picked my wife up from work.
* I played couple games of league.
* Fireman time! Woot Woot!
* Gyros for dinner. 
* We found my daughter's laptop.
** It was in the last place we looked!
* More league, wine, and chillaxing. 
* My wife and I agreed to forego the Pact tonight.
