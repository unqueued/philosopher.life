I don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves.

The Golden Rule...it's not "whoever has the gold makes the rules."

<<<
Every breath you take, every move you make, every bond you break, every step you take...

Every single day, every word you say, every game you play...

Every vow you break, every smile you fake, every claim you stake...

[[The Moral Law]] is watching you.

* Those who practice the golden rule will be punished by those who do not. The paradox of tolerance requires being intolerant to those who are intolerant [[irwrongfrr]].


* It is the metaphysical panoptical judge of agents who have freewill to compute and choose among options in the contingent moral mediums built upon the necessary foundations of ontology.
* Intention/Motivation/From Duty
** Did you mean to mean it all the way down? What is the golden mean of that practice?

Preach to yourself as though all [[The Others]] will hold you accountable to it.

[[The Right]] := [[The Good]]will.

Do not make an exception of yourself. 

Objective prescriptive meaning is real: 


The Duty from which all other duties flow. The Golden Rule.

Ethical (a subset of the Moral). It is the standard of the good of moral agency (in context?).

If [[The Good]] is the priceless jewel, the unattainable perfection f-ness, then [[The Right]] is the highest priced jewel (a price that is by definition attainable).

Also, see [[The Good]], which clearly has it embedded in it.

Also, see [[The Original Position]].

To whom much is given, much is required.

[[Freedom]]. I believe in a radical freedom. Everything is a moral question. Every single computable moment is a moral one.

There is something profound about a moral theory which is not only applicable to every context, but can be scaled down from the generic to the particular context to be pragmatically applied. That theoretical and practical wisdom converge on [[The Golden Rule]] is not accident. It is fundamental to any absolute, unconditional law that it applies from all possible perspectives in all contexts in all possible states of affairs or possible worlds.
