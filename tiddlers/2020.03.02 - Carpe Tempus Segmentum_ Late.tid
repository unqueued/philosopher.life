** Offspring came with me. It went well. Eventually, they'll be able to do this themselves. 
*** Lots of good reasoning across the board, including building lists before we left, price comparison, projecting needs, and thinking about their mother's dietary requirements. 
*** We're still thinking about spatial reasoning with others (my son is getting there: huge differences over the years). 
*** Even bagging, checkout, and cart usage were sane this time. 
*** Talked with covid-19 mom and son (he was ~40?) preppers. My god. I'm one of these crazy people. Lawdy.
**** Some of their arguments had merit though.
* Chatted with wife
* Walked with wife
** Korean and iron for my daughter.
* Met Amanda, the [[Angel of Plants|Close Encounters]], again.
** She remembered parts of us. 
** She talked about her mother's death, sister abandoning her, her unreliable caretakers in various systems.
*** I am not worried for her immediate safety, but she seems to sit in a precarious position.
*** I do not know how to ask her if she feels hungry or like she doesn't have enough to eat without asking exactly that. She is frail looking.
*** I handed Amanda our offline card and information.
** She asked about my offspring, homeschooling, my wife's work as a librarian. 
** She was inquisitive all around. I don't know how to explain her intelligence. There were good moves in the rapidly moving mix.
** We talked about autism.
** She mentioned her autistic stalker at the library twice, and my wife explained to me (afterward) that Amanda was trying to leave the conversation (lawd, I'm slow).
*** I only caught the hint when she looked at her watch. She aimed to be incredibly polite with me (so polite, I didn't understand).
** I hope to see more of her on our walks.
