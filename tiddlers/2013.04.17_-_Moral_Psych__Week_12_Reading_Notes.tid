Freedom and Resentment

Determinism itself isn’t what seems to matter. I think incompatibilists who inspect the problem carefully will agree – they simply use determinism as a paradigm example of a universe and an agent arranged such that it is clear to the greater number of intuitions why we should we worried about how external laws influence our ability to choose.

Newton changed the world – philosophy, religion, science all reacted to his work. Determinism (and compatibilism) was a common thesis at the time. Einstein shows up, and we have good reason to think the world at the quantum level does not behave similarly to macroscopic level physics, and in fact, we may even have evidence to suggest that the world isn’t perfectly deterministic at all.

Even if the physical world is not causally deterministic as we thought in the Newtonian sense, the incompatibilist has not won. In fact, it seems that determinism has nothing to do with our problem with compatibilism.

Determinism is simply billiard balls hitting billiard balls, with a strict causal link which always holds, or always holds without some sort of intervention. The incompatibilist must overcome more than just this.

Prime mover theory is at the heart of the incompatibilist doctrine. We must be the cause of our choice, and it can be nothing else. If we can be reduced to mere physics; regardless of whether or not those deterministic mechanics, then we aren’t prime movers.



One can resent the bad without resenting wrong. Good/right distinction is important here, as it seems I can loathe when I can’t blame.







Precis of The Illusion of Conscious Will

Will: Experience, Force

Experience of consciousness, self-reporting seems to be only reliable indicator of “conscious will”

Brain damage, hypnosis, table-turning (ouiji boards), etc. can be “experience of consciousness” defeating.

2x2 Square

Automatisms and illusions of control (controlling machines, button pressing, causation/contingency)



What does the ability to predict action mean for freewill?

Empirical Will – The causality of the person’s conscious thoughts as established by scientific analysis of the covariation with the person’s behavior

Phenomenal Will – the person’s reported experience of will.

Causal agents

Libet’s findings – Readiness Potential (RP) – brain reliably begins working for a choice before we are aware of it. The question: Have we chosen before we are conscious of what we will choose? Does that matter? Is there any chance for deliberation or “doing otherwise?”





Consciousness regress. The Experience of willing is not the cause of action. We can still have a will about which we aren’t conscious.???
