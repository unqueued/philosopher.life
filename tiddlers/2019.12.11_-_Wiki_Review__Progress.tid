title: 2019.12.11 - Wiki Review: Progress

* [[2019.12.10 - Link Log: Cleaning]]
** It's interesting to see the backlog is often old news, but still worthy in my eyes.
* [[2019.12.10 - Prompted Introspection: Eccentric]]
** Edited. I think my offspring are going to come by it honestly.
* [[2019.12.10 - TDL: Continue]]
** It wasn't perfect, but we made good progress. I'm glad to see everyone is organizing at the same time; it is the perfect time for it.
*** Worried I'll need more than 3 pods. The house is densely packed.
*** My offspring are lucky enough to have an uncle who is going to help them build out a room. Probably worth more forethought than we've given.
* [[2019.12.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Not Enough]]
** Trying to get to sleep earlier, but it's not happening.
* [[2019.12.10 - Wiki Review: Bricks]]
** Edited. I should respond.
* [[2019.12.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Ahoy]]
** It's definitely felt like a whirlwind of people lately.
