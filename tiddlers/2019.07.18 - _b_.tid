I am at war to kill what is evil in homo sapiens to protect and cultivate what is [[Human]]. What dangerous talk about genetics and memetics, ideas and materials, and how we evaluate ourselves and each other using "supposedly" objective criteria in which we can never be certain? I do not believe psychopathy should exist in its various [[dok]]. I am a socialist who agrees to a subset of plurality of identities and cultures in us, and that is such a stupid looking belief to hold in the eyes of most people when I get down to it with them. I'm going to keep pointing at [[The Golden Rule]] and [[The Good]] until I'm blue in the face, and that means it's actually possible to be a person who shouldn't have lived, whose choices ultimately did not have sufficient moral merit in the context, and [[TPK]] as an idea particularized down to our context is morally and ontologically real.

The justification for when we are justified persons is when we use our choices as morally best we can in our situation, and it's really easy to say we couldn't have done otherwise in a more positive manner. Cutting off the possibility of being a better person is a Ribbonfarm trick wherein we lie to ourselves at just the right moments.

Even if they can't articulate it, I think people find it coercive that expect them to speak with me on my terms to some extent when it costs so much to learn my language and point of view. Reciprocal empathy, especially in epistemic asymmetry, is difficult. I do my best to make myself searchable, to speak carefully in direct conversation, and to provide a reasonable opportunity for studying and interrogation.

It's not as much of a rhetorical device for mediating how we engage in telling ourselves the stories of who we are with each other (as I think most games clearly are), but a philosophical one hellbent on getting to the bottom of what is [[salient]] as thoroughly, surgically, efficiently, and transparently as possible. It is no mere experience to me, and I am not "fronting" here.
