There are many kinds of self-examination. At least one of them (if not all of them) requires articulating your beliefs and desires, and this log does exactly that (including the bad, wrong, and ugly). This log requires me to answer questions which help pull my identity onto the pages of this wiki. This log has demonstrated itself to be an application of my axiom, [[Know Thyself]]. 

Sometimes I feel like I need a can-opener to pry myself open. Writing prompts force me to say something about a topic and to explore myself. I try to ask personal or philosophical questions, but sometimes they can be so generic that they allow me to say whatever I want to say. I'm not sure if this is a good or a bad thing.

Admittedly, some of my responses are humorous and recreational, but I still attempt to provide something useful. Sometimes I sprawl all over the place, and I can be prone to ask more questions than I answer. I'm fond of pointing out the lack of definitions and context. I often give non-answers as well. That's okay though. This is just part of the mind-mapping process.

It is my hypothesis that many of the prompts I've answered thus far remind me strongly of "Sunday School" questions. The teacher might gather us together and ask generic existential questions; we'd have to formulate intelligent appearing and socially acceptable responses. It was a form of conditioning. We were expected to think as they did. My questions and answers were often received poorly, dismissed, or misunderstood. Par for the course. Thankfully, here I get to say what I think since I'm answering them for myself. I won't always pretend I'm the one asking the questions though. A dialectic, like the Socratic method, tends to bring out the best in me.

Sometimes I'm just talking to myself directly. Othertimes, I have a more adversarial approach to these prompts as I play with my imaginary friends. Thus, it can be useful for me to interpret the question as coming from another interlocutor. I currently use two interlocutors:

* Samwise Gamgee
** My mortal enemy, that eternal asshole, may he burn in hell.<<ref "1">>  KYS, Tolkienian Humanity.

* Lady Melisandre
** Imagine if Jessica Rabbit starred in the Lord of the Rings (share_the_load); she grants me wishes and serves me here when I want to be explicit (:P) because I care about my audience's feelings and needs, even if only out of self-interest.<<ref "2">>

Hostility allows my gutteral instincts to take over, to let loose, to fly, and once in a while it is even a useful way for me to force myself to answer carefully, to pick a part everything, to see the outlines. In many ways, I was good at academic philosophy because I was at mental war.<<ref "3">> Samewise the Fool has us covered here. I'm happy to dismiss or destroy him.

Attempting to be charitable to my audience, taking their questions seriously, and seeking their approval can also be useful. I found I was good at this approach in academic philosophy as well (to a point). Lady Melisandre has me covered here.<<ref "4">>

!! Principles:

* Answer questions sequentially from [[Generic Prompts]].
* This is a daily log.
** The Focus section contains each day for the past month, and then each month's logs are consolidated and audited at the beginning of the next month.
* "!!" the prompt to make it stand out, then answer it.
* If necessary, respond to one of your interlocutors.
* Subseqent runs through [[Generic Prompts]] will require an analysis of previous answers (only after having answered first).
