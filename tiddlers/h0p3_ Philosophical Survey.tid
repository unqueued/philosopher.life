//Straight from [[Buzzfeed|https://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP]]!<<ref "b">> Sounds like {[[axioms]]} territory to me, homie.//

Possible answers:

* Accept one
* Lean toward one
* Accept both
* Reject both<<ref "i">>
* Accept an intermediate view
* Accept another alternative
* The question is too unclear to answer
* There is no fact of the matter
* Insufficiently familiar with the issue<<ref "h">>
* Agnostic/undecided

Le Questions:

# A priori knowledge: yes or no?
#* Lean toward yes.

# Abstract objects: Platonism or nominalism?
#* Accept Platonism.
#** Woot, woot. ;P -- I have to say, I rarely find Platonists who are actual Platonists. I'm such a snob.

# Aesthetic value: objective or subjective?
#* Lean Toward Objective
#** Accept both looks appealing too.

# Analytic-synthetic distinction: yes or no?
#* Lean Toward yes
#** But I'm fine with saying agnostic/undecided or insufficiently familiar with the issue.

# Epistemic justification: internalism or externalism?
#* Accept externalism

# External world: idealism, skepticism, or non-skeptical realism?
#* Accept non-skeptical realism

# Free will: compatibilism, libertarianism, or no free will?
#* Accept libertarianism

# God: theism or atheism?
#* Accept another alternative
#** Deism, non-anthropomorphized, non-agential. Divine, but no praying.

# Knowledge: empiricism or rationalism?
#* Accept both
#** Lulz. You can't have just one or the other. I respect the rationalists far more though.

# Knowledge claims: contextualism, relativism, or invariantism?
#* Accept contextualism
#** However, that leaves me open to accepting what is functionally reducible to relativistic and invariantist exceptions

# Laws of nature: Humean or non-Humean?
#* Accept non-Humean

# Logic: classical or non-classical?
#* Accept non-classical
#** Fuck me, that hurts to say.

# Mental content: internalism or externalism?
#* Accept Externalism

# Meta-ethics: moral realism or moral anti-realism?
#* Accept moral realism

# Metaphilosophy: naturalism or non-naturalism?
#* Accept non-naturalism

# Mind: physicalism or non-physicalism?
#* Lean non-physicalism
#** If I knew how [[The Good]] enabled perception, I would be able to say.

# Moral judgment: cognitivism or non-cognitivism?
#* Accept an intermediate view
#** Can't have one without the other, and I can't lean in either direction (despite how much I respect cognition).

# Moral motivation: internalism or externalism?
#* The question is too unclear to answer
#** We internally choose to bind ourselves to the external moral law (making it internal to us), but what counts as the standard of moral motivation is external.

# Newcomb’s problem: one box or two boxes?
#* The question is too unclear to answer
#* Most variants I've seen cause me to lean toward both, but you can specify the problem such that I will choose one.

# Normative ethics: deontology, consequentialism, or virtue ethics?
#* Accept an intermediate view
#** Though Deontology is clearly the major semantic force.

# Perceptual experience: disjunctivism, qualia theory, representationalism, or sense-datum theory?
#* Agnostic/undecided
#** Clearly, I must be stupid. I'm not convinced there aren't more effective intermediate views.

# Personal identity: biological view, psychological view, or further-fact view?
#* Lean further-fact.
#** This problem is retarded hard. This is like a Ship of Theseus meets [[The Good]] problem for me.

# Politics: communitarianism, egalitarianism, or libertarianism?
#* The question is too unclear to answer
#** I'm a Platonic-Rawlsian-Marxist. Communitarianism tends to be the closest answer, but the words are sullied.

# Proper names: Fregean or Millian?
#* Agnostic/undecided
#** But, I'm rock hard. Go on, talk dirty to me.

# Science: scientific realism or scientific anti-realism?
#* Lean toward scientific realism
#** I hasten to add it is approximate; it rests upon probabilistic, anti-luck contextualist standards of knowledge. 
#** I have far more interest in theoretical physics, psychology, and CS than the others.

# Teletransporter (new matter): survival or death?
#* Lean toward death
#** It may be possible to specify it otherwise.

# Time: A-theory or B-theory?
#* Lean toward B-theory
#** But, I'm probably just not qualified to say either way. I'm fine with dualism and crazier stories here too. Illusion for whom, from what perspective?

# Trolley problem (five straight ahead, one on side track, turn requires switching,what ought one do?): switch or don’t switch?
#* Accept switch
#** Sorry, bro.

# Truth: correspondence, deflationary, or epistemic?
#* Accept correspondence

# Zombies: inconceivable, conceivable but not metaphysically possible, or metaphysically possible?
#* Lean toward metaphysically possible
#** However, I think moral hedged-conservatism requires bypassing it.
