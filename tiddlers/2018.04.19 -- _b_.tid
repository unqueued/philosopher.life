Here's an unfun, unPC, extremist, arrogant-appearing, perfectionist, highly unpopular point of view at the end of the day, when taken the nth degree: Many lives and identities are not valid. Your life can be not only a waste, but in fact directly a bad thing that should never have existed. Yes, I am attacking who you are. You are a bad person. You should not be who you are.
