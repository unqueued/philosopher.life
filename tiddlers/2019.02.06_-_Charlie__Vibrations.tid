title: 2019.02.06 - Charlie: Vibrations

Charlie picked up today! We talked about music notation, the evolution of music and homo sapiens, harmonics in nature and consciousness (worried about woo), and some outlandish coincidences of a particular frequency in physics (I'm unqualified). He takes seriously the possibility that our notation is wrongheaded (cool), but then it got weird with a debate about 440hz vs 432hz. It's not like I can't hear a quantitative difference, but there is no qualitative value difference for my phenomenology (at least no obvious one). Sorry, bruh. I can't help you with that one. 

Charlie is prone to conspiracy theory (as am I). I love him.
