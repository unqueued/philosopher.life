How was your trip to the aquarium?
SUN 5:30 PM

SUN 6:58 PM

That looks excellent.
SUN 7:00 PM
I was very busy and lots of people were there. But we took our time and mad sure to see everything.
SUN 7:02 PM
It's good to savor.
SUN 7:08 PM
What have you all been up too?
SUN 7:09 PM
Kids cleaned the house, we went on a date. Today we have family time. Talking about the week, reading each others wikis, planning for next week.
SUN 7:10 PM
Sounds very productive!
SUN 7:31 PM
It has been.
SUN 7:31 PM
This morning I took a fellow out to breakfast that I had a falling out with a few years back. He is the husband of the girl that rents a booth in my wife's salon. We also sold them a nice mobile home for $3500 on a payment plan of $100 per month for 3 years with the contract reading the mobile home had to be moved by end of third year. (they were also able to live in it during this time)
SUN 7:33 PM
He had a drug addiction problem, beyond what we knew, and we allowed them to barrow a bunch of DVDs one snowed in weekend.
SUN 7:34 PM
He pawned them for $, took money from some church members, and blah. So I kinda wrote him off. He did go to rehab, but he did relapse after rehab as well...
SUN 7:35 PM
Well he is going to be a father probabaly next week, he is a Christian, he is a decent human being.
SUN 7:35 PM
I wanted to let bygones wash under the bridge and reach out to. Let him know he his full forgiven and I hold no resentment.
SUN 7:36 PM
That I want the best for him. And his family and he is welcome in my house.
SUN 7:36 PM
I barely got to speak, he spent most of the time talking about the future with his. Kiddo.
SUN 7:37 PM
It was relieving for us both. I. Think.
SUN 7:37 PM
=)
SUN 7:37 PM
That sounds intense and wonderful.
SUN 7:37 PM
Being a father is a powerful experience.
SUN 7:38 PM
We spent two hour at the waffle King (our vwrson of the waffle house) just talking and trading stories.
SUN 7:38 PM
I knew that talking to him after th baby was born may be too distracting, so I am glad I got the opportunity to do something so simple. Before.
SUN 7:39 PM
It was pleasant. But left me exhausted. I took a nap today. Lol
SUN 7:39 PM
But I thought you may appreciate the story no less.
SUN 7:39 PM
Yeah, I do. I can see why you would feel exhausted.
SUN 7:42 PM
Empathy is an expensive emotional and cognitive task.
SUN 7:43 PM
Of course I didn't do it for blogging or. Bragging rights. I'm just telling you because I know you would appriciate the effort.
SUN 7:47 PM
Aye. I strongly respect acting from duty.
SUN 7:47 PM
Doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do is the only kind of moral motivation that matters.
SUN 7:48 PM
I'm excited for him. And his amazing wife to bring the babay home. And Kathy is allowing the mother bring the baby to the salon. And of course not charging her booth rent while she it out.
SUN 7:48 PM
I can't say I will. Ever lend him my tools... But it was apparent by his talking that both him. And his wife look up to me and Kathy.
SUN 7:49 PM
I have found that despite my low self esteem alot. Of people look up to us. We give a good appearance of having our shit together.
SUN 7:50 PM
Lol.
SUN 7:50 PM
It's good that you aren't seeking approval based on appearance and instead being a good person because that's the right thing to do. It's especially impressive when doing the right thing makes you sad, is sacrificially expensive, and even anonymous (where you can't gain reputation at all).
SUN 7:52 PM
I bet that family is going to be a lot better off because of you.
SUN 7:53 PM
It's a wonderful thing.
SUN 7:54 PM
I. Am. No where near sacrifically expensive  good deeds. Quite the opposite. However, I see the change within me developing. The forgiveness and letting go.... Life is so short to hold onto anger. I make enough of that on my own, against myself, without letter others create it for me. Lol
SUN 8:15 PM
Sounds like a damned good start to me.
SUN 8:16 PM
I have a good mentor. =)
SUN 8:16 PM
This is going to sound cheesy, but I just love this Dr. Seuss quote: "Life's too short to wake up with regrets. So love the people who treat you right, forgive the ones who don't and believe that everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said it'd be easy, they just promised it would be worth it."
SUN 8:16 PM
Not cheesy to me. Dr suess was a brilliant man imho
SUN 8:17 PM
By the way (I underhandedly referred to you as my good Mentor) see above. For whatever it is worth.

SUN 8:19 PM
I was a listening. I appreciate the compliment! I deferred to one of my mentors in Dr. Seuss to say: I'm paying it forward.
SUN 8:20 PM
I'm soo glad the Gif got there before you could respond! Hahaha. #win
SUN 8:20 PM
lol
SUN 8:20 PM
I was unsure if you got it or not. We both know we ain't that bright. =p
SUN 8:21 PM
Preach, yo! I am slow all too often.
SUN 8:21 PM
I think I was in my 20's before I could articulate that Diagon Alley in Harry Potter was intentionally referring to Diagonal.
SUN 8:22 PM
Btw, have you heard anything back about that job in Louisville?
SUN 8:24 PM
I was in my twentys still. Singing "gimme the beach Boys and free my soul"
SUN 8:24 PM
Hehe
SUN 8:24 PM
Oh man, I have the same problem. I can't hear lyrics to save my life. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEqs5MtV7Iw
SUN 8:25 PM
Thought that was "Amen. Nice Shot" when we were in college.
SUN 8:25 PM
I am. Not letting hopes get high for UPS. My resume was sent to HR, and then to the hiring personnel. Of course she was out of office all. Last week. When my resume was sent. It's Just what it is right now.
SUN 8:25 PM
Their top. Out pay was just raised 30% to $139k a year....
SUN 8:26 PM
Ah. Yes. Good to keep the predictions low and be pleasantly surprised.
SUN 8:26 PM
That is fucking amazing.
SUN 8:26 PM
It's almost disgusting. I do the same type of work right now. But barely at 70k before taxes and Healthcare. That's twice my income! And they don't pay any health care premiums!
SUN 8:27 PM
If the lord is willing I'll get a call. Till then I'm. Just chilling. Not stressing. I got a good job with lockheed martin. It's nothing to scoff at. So I just keep doing what I'm doing.
SUN 8:28 PM
Any word from Cali?
SUN 8:28 PM
Nope.
SUN 8:28 PM
I actually think you have a reasonable chance of getting the job. I am convinced I do not. Still, we will both hope. =)
SUN 8:29 PM
I hope. More. For. You than me.
SUN 8:34 PM
I don't need it. I'm. Concerned it is simply. My greed driviNG. My desire.
SUN 8:35 PM
But that has bee a significant driving force in my life since childhood...
SUN 8:35 PM
Yes. I can see how poverty has affected both of us. It's tough.
SUN 8:36 PM
But making 6 figures then my wife wouldn't have to work...
SUN 8:36 PM
No doubt.
SUN 8:36 PM
That would be amazing.
SUN 8:36 PM
The rough part is about a have dozen guys who I use to work regional jets with are working there. We use to do the same job for $15 an hour back in 2011. Lol
SUN 8:37 PM
Half*
SUN 8:37 PM
And we worked so. Hard back then I never changed my diet and got down to 165lbs!
SUN 8:38 PM
I am proud to get down to 200 these days, lol.
SUN 8:39 PM
I'm starting Tuesday. The strict no carb diet.
SUN 8:41 PM
/salute
SUN 8:41 PM
Had success with it. Once. Just never stuck with it again.
SUN 8:41 PM
I have a mud and mayhem obstacle. Course 5k coming up this summer and I don't wanna be a fatty again.
SUN 8:42 PM
I had to buy new shirts and pants and stuff to fit my increased size. It is unhealthy. Blood pressure. Is up, knees and feet always killing me. Blah. It. Is time.
SUN 8:43 PM
Just can't tell. The guys at work untill. I get below. Thay 200 mark. So. They don't make fun of me. Everyday.
SUN 8:44 PM
People are good hearted but. Have have no reserve when it comes to. Making jokes at the costs of your physical. Image.
