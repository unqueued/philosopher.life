* I didn't get it all done. I let the electrician and Milligan tasks go until the end of the week, and with my wife feeling ill, I decided not to do it. I hope that isn't a mistake that will bite me in the butt. This was my fault. I will do better.
* I did make progress though. I'm pleased that it was an overall positive week, constructive even.
* I need to hold myself accountable here.
