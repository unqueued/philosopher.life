title: 2019.08.30 - Prompted Introspection: Overrated Virtue

!! What do you consider your most overrated virtue?

Overrrated by whom? Virtue qua what? Give me the telos, the [[gfwiwcgws]], the for the sake of which, please. That which only appears generally virtuous but fails to provide unified virtue in one's context is hardly virtue. If we simply mean the hypothetically rational, valueless, vacuous, anti-realist virtue of the practice in the McIntyrian sense, then surely it will be my skill in [[Hack, Slash, and Crawl]].<<ref "i">>

<<footnotes "i" "[[Masturbation]] seems more fitting, but that's not overrated. I'm working for the Olympics here. I disagree with the structure of the competitive masturbation scenes though (seriously). They clearly don't know how to measure what counts as virtuous masturbation. It's just an imbalanced metagame, and the devs have no desire to address it.">>
