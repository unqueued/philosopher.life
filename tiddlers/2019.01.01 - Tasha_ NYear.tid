Happy New Year! =) -- What did you like about 2018, what are you hoping for 2019?
TUE 9:25 AM
Happy new year:sparkles: in 2018 I like that I step out of my comfort zone to move to another state where I knew no on and nothing. Walking in to 2019 with confidence, insane growth, a calm spirit, gratitude, and a big to-do list for the upcoming year. I will continue working full time on my job and part time on my fortune God willing nanny is not my future at least not full time. And I wanna drop a few pounds totally just to be healthier not for looks.
TUE 12:59 PM
How about you!?

Yeah, you had a hell of a year.

What's on the to-do list?

I'm still thinking about 2018 and 2019.

Overall, I'm proud of my work on my wiki and homeschooling. I'm hoping that I can do a good job as the Afterschool teacher and keep us afloat financially.

How are the guys doing?

We are good can’t complain at all. Esteban and I are going to be re focusing on our business. We got off track moving here and we need it financially, mentally, and physically. We miss Colorado but we have the opportunity to build what we built in CO here too so that’s what we need to do!!

And yes losing a few pounds makes everyone’s list in the new year :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I'd be interested to know how you are building your business here. I don't know much about how that works.
TUE 1:10 PM
We would be delighted to share- I think you’ll love it!!
