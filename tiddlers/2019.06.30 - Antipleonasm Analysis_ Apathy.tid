!! Respond to the following gem:

The sad truth of the matter is that most evil is done by people who never made up their minds to be or do either evil or good.

Madame Hannah Arendt has a way with words. Her antipleonasms are powerful rhetorical devices, but too often they aren't sufficiently exacting. She's a good communicator pointing in roughly the right direction though. I adore what she stands for, and we're lucky to have her.

Making up their minds not to make up their minds any further in some regard is either good or evil to some [[dok]]. Arendt points this out: she calls it evil. My problem, however, is that she at first glance implies that they didn't make up their minds. She is pointing out a dialectical order here, and so her apparent mistake is one meant to educate. I am grateful.

Enlightened centrism is an immoral reactionary position. Apathetic pacifism which doesn't put your identity on the line again and again is selfish cowardice. You are responsible for centralizing power.
