title: 2017.12.16 - Prompted Introspection Log: Grounding Event

!! Tell about a time when you were grounded.

This is hard to recall. My donors rarely grounded me. Direct and immediate psychological and physical confrontation tended to be the usual. Hrm. I know I did get grounded for things though. I'm trying to recall an instance. Mind you, we're talking about a life decades ago now. 

Not exactly a grounding, but something similar. We would be required to run laps around the house if we annoyed our donors often enough. They didn't actually care about the laps, they were just sending us outside so they could do their work/rest. I can appreciate that to some extent.
