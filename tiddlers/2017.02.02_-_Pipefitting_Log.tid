title: 2017.02.02 - Pipefitting Log

We had a graduate from my program come in yesterday. He joined the union. He came in a journeyman due to previous experience. He made $50k in the past 4 months. That's sick.

I've heard that much of the fabrication work I do in the shop does not transfer to the field. Much of the industrial pipefitting work is so large scale and prefabricated that I'm really doing the installation and not the more detailed aspects of construction. I will learn what I can though. This is me getting my foot in the door, understanding it from the ground up, understanding the nooks and crannies, etc.

My body is sore, but that is to be expected. Eventually, it will be nothing. I'm glad I can work my way up to it.
