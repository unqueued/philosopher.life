title: 2018.07.05 - Charlie: Gödel

We spoke at great length about Faith, Gödel's Incompleteness Theory, Physics (and Metaphysics), Computational Consciousness, and The Foundation Problem(s) and infinigresses (especially the epistemic). I fear Charlie and I are reaching the impasse where we aren't able to understand each other's point of view effectively enough. 

I think Gödel shows us (intentionally or otherwise) some limits of sufficiently complex/expressive languages. If you take the physical universe to be a computer, there are certain things which it cannot demonstrate which are true. There is something true outside the physical universe's possibilities by definition. This is metaphysics. We cannot even begin to talk about the nature of the existence of such a thing. Even the physicalist who claims that substance is the truth-bearer, and without being there is no meaning, must admit some meaning outside of physical substance and hence agrees to some metaphysical substance. 

To be clear, truth is meaningful, even if it isn't known or currently computed by any finite mind. I'm not an idealist at all in this respect. I'm a realist about the reality (not ideality) of the ideal. There are meanings which are 

There is an "is" to the "ought" all the way at the bottom. I don't know what it means to say it, and I definitionally cannot even by the Gödellian implied languages/models available to me.
