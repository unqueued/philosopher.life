title: 2012.09.13 - Autonomy: Berlin Notes

Berlin investigates two conceptions of freedom/liberty.



Positive liberty is the capacity for autonomy or the presence of the components of autonomy. I see positive liberty as pointing us toward the necessary constructive elements of autonomy. Positive liberty looks at the source of autonomy.



Negative liberty is not being prevented from exercising autonomy or the absence of obstacles, coercion, interference, or constraints upon one’s autonomy. In contrast to positive liberty, I see negative autonomy as pointing us toward those elements which can deconstruct, limit, or disable autonomy.



This reminds me of positive and negative duties. If you have a positive duty, someone is obligated toward you. If you have a negative duty, you are obligated not to interfere or prevent someone else from doing something. Negative duties are about absence of interference, and positive duties seem to have the primary thrust of duty-based thinking. I see positive and negative liberty as being analogous.



While the following differs from Berlin, this is what crudely came to my mind:






<<<
Make a 4x4 Box of the following:

X: 

* Positive Liberty
* Negative Liberty

Y:

* Individual Public (Political) Autonomy	
* Individual Private Autonomy

Clockwise, starting in top-left:


# Having the capacity to participate in politics
# Having a government which promotes choice and whatever else counts as political autonomy, etc.
# Your authentic-self governs you
# Your “moral” autonomy
<<<


You face no political obstacles/interference
	

No inauthentic-self or non-political force interferes or prevents your authentic self from governing you

Make a 4x4 Box of the following:

X: 

* Positive Liberty
* Negative Liberty

Y:

* Corporate Public (Political) Autonomy	
* Corporate Private Autonomy

Clockwise, starting in top-left:

# Having the capacity to participate in global politics among other external autonomous agents Having an external governing agent(s) (corporate or otherwise) which promotes choice & whatever else counts as political autonomy for you as a corporate autonomous agent
# The authentic corporate self (e.g. a nation) governs itself and the agents, individual or corporate, internal to it
# You face no political obstacles/interference from external political agents
# No inauthentic corporate self, comprised of individual or corporate agents, interferes or prevents your authentic corporate self from governing you and the agents, individual or corporate, internal to you

Berlin seems to push for a balance between positive and negative liberty. Seeking this balance also reminds me of that adage, “Your rights end where my rights begin.” We want to maximize the positive liberties of each autonomous being, but only insofar as they do not impinge on the negative liberties of each other autonomous being.
