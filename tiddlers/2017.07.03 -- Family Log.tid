!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** You had a difficult time with you character not playing like you wanted it to, and took the time and energy to be a good sport about it. You quietly and privately calmed down, and you came back downstairs with a good attitude. I think it shows maturity and a willingness to grow. I'm glad you participated in the experience with us, even if it didn't go as initially planned for you.
** You made excellent characters for DND.
** You made progress toward controlling your meltdowns and negative thoughts. You quickly recovered when you did have them.
* j3d1h
** You were a good host this weekend. Several times you gave up your seat, made food, cleaned up, and provided hospitality for our guests.
** You were tempted to get pouty during the game, and you controlled yourself and reset your attitude.
** I feel like you haven't been bossy with me, for example, you asked for my help with the trash. 
* k0sh3k
** Thank you for putting in so much effort into our DND game. I really enjoyed it, and I think you made it a very special weekend for the rest of us. We will remember it for a long time to come. I want to thank you for creating this project in your wiki. It really means a lot to me on that front as well.
** You cheered me up at church. I had a meltdown, and you helped me recover from it.
** Thank you for helping me bake this weekend, giving me more time with the family.
* h0p3
** Thank you for getting the car worked on and getting everything in order before you have to go.
** Thank you for getting us the magnetic putty.
** I like how you are honest in your [[h0p3's log]]. It's a good log.
