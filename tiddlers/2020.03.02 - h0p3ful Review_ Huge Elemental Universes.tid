** I'm glad you got some spare time. It was a busy day.
*** Are you liking not having kitchen duties and having the sabbath prep?
*[[2020/03/01 -- Wiki Log]]
** Thank you for trying. The difference is obvious.
** Why do you think you are writing more in your //Life Log//s?
*** Are the differences valuable? Why?
** Alright, how about this: it tends to be safer to err on the side of formality. I like to think that your voice evolves over time. Your gut instinct should be formal.
** I can appreciate not wanting to work on something one doesn't want to work on. I could just say: it's a part of growing up, but it's more than that. You'll be glad that you can still bring yourself to do what you otherwise don't want to do. I think it takes times to develop that ability (wait until your frontal lobes have more control).

** You are free to start us off and to speak your mind. ;P

** If you have unused dynamic tiddlers, you may consider getting rid of them. Sometimes I do, and sometimes I don't. I have no idea how to reason well enough about it.
** What did you think of working on foreign languages? Are you going to pick it up again? 
*** I'm not convinced it's so valuable for you unless you think you'd be using it in a business setting. A reading skill for academia is different. Quant is my preference.
** [[2018/03/02 -- Elemental Universes]] is huge. I hope you get back to this kind of work some day. I know you've gotta have something worth writing about too.
