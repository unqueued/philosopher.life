title: 2018.05.23 - Prompted Introspection Log: Bananas Etymology Justification

!! Why would we say that someone is "bananas"?

https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/74581/why-does-bananas-mean-crazy

The origin of the meme is not clear. I assume we use the euphemism when it seems appropriate, of which there may be many differing context archetypes. 

I would tend to use it with a positive connotation. If I say, "That's bananas," I mean it it's crazy is an interesting way. I don't say it often though, and I don't call humans "bananas." 

For me, if I believe a mind is not functioning as well as I would prefer, I try to give more than a simple label. I want to talk about the root causes of it, to understand the culpabilities at play, etc.
