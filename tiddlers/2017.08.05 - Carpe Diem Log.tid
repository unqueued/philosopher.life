title: 2017.08.05 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up at 6:40. I could still feel the literal thirst (for water) from alcohol of the previous night.
* League
* My wife made an amazing breakfast. Her grits rock! It might be one of my favorite breakfasts of all time.
* We shopped for a car.
** We took our time. 
** Cash for Clunkers wrecked the secondary market, as intended. Neo-lib.
** The sweetspot is now probably 8k on a vehicle. I need to save more for next time. That's a couple months of work at least.
** We got an SUV, our first. It will store my tools nicely and help me with rougher job sites.
* Inform the Men!
* Amazing shower (so much better with my wife ;P)
* Acquired my new tools! Woot!
** Johanna had more of her completely misinformed conservative/neo-lib bullshit against the Humanities. Said I've learned my lesson. Lol. Fucking evil retard, burn in hell.
* We hit the li-bary. 
* Kids cleaned the living room.
* I did a tool unpackaging with my brother on video. We talked for quite a while. I really enjoyed it. 
* Watched League + beer
* Organized tools, marked them, etc.
* Westworld until bed.
