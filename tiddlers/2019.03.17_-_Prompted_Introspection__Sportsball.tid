title: 2019.03.17 - Prompted Introspection: Sportsball

!! What is your all-time favorite sports team?

That's difficult. It's somewhere between UK Wildcats, TSM, The Mighty Ducks, and Bulls w/Jordan (kid from Chicago, and I loved Space Jam). There are a few baseball movies which had teams I liked. It's a shame I can't remember the names of any of the amateur e-sports teams I've played on. I probably prefer playing to watching. I'm not a huge fan of sportsball, and I resent the conditioning I've received on the topic. I think it detracts from being political animals [[irwartfrr]], misdirecting us onto something almost useless. We are there to vicariously live through our teams. It's a radically misguided opiate of the masses. No thank you. I prefer other kinds of drugs.
