!! Audit:

* Hrm, I'm missing a log. This has happened more than once.
** It's time for verification.
* I'm feeling so much better than last month. My wife's health, however, is declining without her meds.
** By the time I got to the doctor's, it was solved. Lol.
* I think we are done with the DMV for a while. I'm so grateful.
* My offspring floundered, and understandably to some extent.
* Yeah, we are still settling into the place in our second month. It's started to normalize far more though.
* I'm glad that my son is seeing improvements and caring about it more. I hope we continue.
* They've been busy finding a church. I think they have one.
* Oh, we finally had use of a car. It's been great to have it.
* Chairman Meow is slowly coming to grips with our new home. She's been so anxious.
** Ranga has been spending time in people's laps more. he won't sit in mine, but he will let me pet him and give him kittycrack.
* My offspring still don't give a shit about their rooms and infrastructures.
** Well, not entirely, but not enough. It's neat to see Saturday Doctor Who time is in my son's room. He's hosting.
* We're still coming to grips with my wife's position.
* I'm grateful that my offspring actually care that I try to explain things to them. It's so expensive to listen like that.
* I'm not as disappointed about the car, but I realize it's going to be something we need to keep an eye on. 
** At least it will not die without the battery.
* That electric bill was insane. I've annoyed everyone in the house with our incredibly low thermostat for science.
** I wonder if this has helped my allergies? There still may be something in wrong about the heating system.
*** And, the filter isn't in...
* I've done a solid job trying to socialize despite significant upheaval in our lives.
