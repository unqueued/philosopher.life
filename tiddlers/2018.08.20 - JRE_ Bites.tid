title: 2018.08.20 - JRE: Bites

We talked for a while. Raylan is biting now. They are having discipline/restraint difficulties. Foster parents are heavily regulated in this respect, and that makes it tough. The difference in approaches (and physical ability) between JRE and Rebecca appear to complicate the matter as well. They must be losing their minds. I know I would be (ha, too late!). 

Fuck man. =( One way in which I try to show my empathy is to demonstrate that I have absolutely no idea what to do in their situation and show them the pain of feeling lost (which is a powerful feeling for me). I wish I could snap my fingers and make it go away. 

I'm really proud of my brother for sticking with his anti-depressants. He's worried about placebo. I am too. It's really early. He agreed to try it for a month or two though. That's what eventually caused me to continue to switch meds (nothing worked besides ketamine and cannabis). He feels the subtle differences, so I'm feeling optimistic. My brother is a very good judge of himself, imho. 

Rebecca was warning him not to compare Raylan to my chillun. He knew, and he knows my chillun aren't neurotypical either (I mean no offense to his intelligent GF, but my brother likely understands it better than she does, imho). 

I talked to him about Eli. He agrees I've done nothing wrong, but agrees Eli must feel weirded out. 

He then moved onto my letter to AA&UJ.
