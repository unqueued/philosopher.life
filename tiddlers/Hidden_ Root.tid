!! About:

//A disclosed patchwork of shade in the sunlight...//

<<<
Man is not what he thinks he is; he is what he hides.

-- AndrÃ© Malraux
<<<

Welcome to the home of the //Hidden Subwiki// embedded in h0p3's Wiki. It's not very hidden, but it's not meant to be something nobody finds.<<ref "1">> It's meant to be a place that people don't have to see unless they really want to. I think a known stealth mechanic makes:

# the most sensitive and easily doxxable personal information just a tad harder to find.
#* I'm under no illusions of privacy or anonymity here, as I've expressed in {[[About]]}. Despite that fact, this is a non-trivial defense against cursory/surface trolls. Obviously, you can find it in seconds if you know to look for it.
# the customarily visible wiki more palatable to the faint of heart.
#* Not everyone loves my penis as much as I do.
#* This is a slight curb of sanity and politeness to the fact that I'm autistically "too honest."
# the rabbithole more thought-provoking and tittilating to the rest of us.
#* It's fun. Obviously, Dasein is secretive in many respects.

This is a non-trivial house of my {[[Dreams]]}. That's actually why it is literally hidden in that top-level directory. Please note, these are mere dreams, impractical and fantastical. They are not to be taken seriously. 

Obviously, in the eyes of the average person, these are odd or TMI personal even as mere thoughts to ever say outloud, let alone post publicly. Normally, I'd say the same thing, but {[[About]]} and {[[Principles]]} are absurdly clear about the fact that I have to shape my identity in the sunlight, even in my dreams. 


---
!! Principles:

* Only Hidden Wiki pages should use the prefix.Titletag, "Hidden:", and only those are hidden from the "New" and "Recent" tabs.
* The Hidden Wiki prefix.Titletag will prefix and supercede all others.
* Not all links in this wiki must use the prefix.Titletag, but they generally should.

!! Dreams:

* I wonder if I should consider storing encrypted information here. Ugh. That might defeat the purpose of the wiki in some respects, but that would also be some serious trust (even for just personal information). Perhaps the best option would be to embed TC-type containers instead?
