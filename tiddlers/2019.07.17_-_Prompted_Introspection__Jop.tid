!! Tell about a friend you have with a different national background.

This question sucks, Samwise. I think we are all come from different national backgrounds. The melting pot is real. I'm not here to squabble about invisible lines drawn by centralized power to enable them to divide and conquer us (which is not to say that regional divisions aren't necessary, but it is the motivation behind such divisions which concerns me). 

I met very few Americans in Thailand, but I met people from around the world. Berea probably have 5-10% of their students from outside the US when I attended. [[Jop]] is a friend of mine. She's a Thai expat who is currently visiting her homeland for a few weeks with her daughters. I hope she is having a wonderful time.
