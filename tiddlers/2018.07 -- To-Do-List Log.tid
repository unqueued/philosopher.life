!! Audit:

* I made no money
* I did not finish IJ
* I did a good job responding to The Others. That has turned out to be a far more important project than I realized.
* I have talked to Charlie more often. On a sidenote, I have tried to reach out to C and R more. I think they are swamped.
* Apprenticeship letter came in. Still no word on the job.
* Again, I am proud of my hunt in the desert for The Others
* We did not swim much at all. Turns out, we just didn't give that much of  a shit about it this summer. That's okay. 
* I did encourage my children quite a bit. I've been getting them into the groove. I'm very glad. I wish I knew that my goal was to be an effective stay at home father from the beginning. I wish we had started using wikis much earlier. It's not like we didn't get stuff done though. We did work hard. I like what we are doing now a lot more though.
* I AM READING THAT.
* Scheduling time with Michael Blouin hasn't worked out thus far. I am excited to do it. School doesn't start up for several weeks. I'll try and schedule then.
* I must admit, [[Wiki Audit]] has come alive for me. I'm glad to have this rolling release.
* I spent a non-trivial part of the month getting the children to take further command of their machines. I'm very proud of all of us for this effort. It has been well worth it.
* One fascinating thing about my planning this month is how some of it doesn't get done immediately, but it does eventually. It's not well-connected, but it actually appears to be something.
* This was a hell of a month too. I'm glad we planned for it.
* I finally finished grafting [[Doctoral Notes]], lol.
* We always have difficulty getting back into the groove after a trip. We still don't have it down pat.
* The early part of the month was very rough, and I was even late. I'm glad when I get it done first thing. I hope to continue that trend.
* We finally got some of the problems in our apartment fixed.
* That word "elastic" is on the money.
* I hear my desperation in trying to encourage my children. I am a terrible motivator.
* There are a lot of jokes and curious breadcrumbs I've left for myself. I love you, self. =)
* I've taken forever to setup m10. Ugh. Normally I'm much, much faster. This was different, of course.
