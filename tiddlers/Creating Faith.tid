title: Creating Faith

//I dedicate this page to Baruch Spinoza who would surely appreciate what I'm trying to do, even if he might have thought I suck at it.//

I suppose I'm taking up axioms. I'm creating my own faith in those beliefs I take to be justified without at least any direction justification, as all people do (whether they realize they are or not). I'm seeking to take up axioms which make the world coherent and myself happy. I have no interest in standard religious thought, spiritualism, or even thick conceptions of metaphysics. Faith need not be religious. Your Faith boils down to the set of beliefs you can't easily be convinced otherwise about (generally in such a way that few people would accept your justification). Be minimalist! Take up only what you must. Good luck!
