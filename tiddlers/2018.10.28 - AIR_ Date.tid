Tell me how the date goes with Jay. =)
10 HR AGO
I will! 
I had so much fun being with y’all. Next time I get to come and see you guys I’ll make sure to take a plane so I can have more time.  
Thanks for waiting with me the extra three hours at the bus station. I know you didn’t have to do that but it really made my day. 
-we need to make sure we go back to that Korean taco place. It was sooo good.
I’m loving the set up my computer it’s been pretty easy to navigate. ( I’m trying to figure out how to switch from one work space to another I know I am missing a button but can’t remember. I am pushing Ctrl+arrow key, but there is one more key I am supposed to push and I can’t remember could you tell me what I’m missing?) 
Thanks for helping get the format for my wiki I’m going to start my out line of what I want it to do today before the date. I’m thinking of separating it into 1.culinary 2. Therapy 3. What I did today-brief things. 4. Reconstruction/development of a social life. And many sub categories under all this. I’m sure I will find more to add to it.
9 HR AGO
Ctrl+Alt+Arrow
9 HR AGO
or Ctrl+WindowsKey+Arrow
9 HR AGO
I feel stupid lol.
9 HR AGO
Those sounds like good categories. You can always reorganize and make radical changes too.
9 HR AGO
Ah, don't worry about it. It's your first time using it.
9 HR AGO
Lmao! I just did it and couldn’t stop laughing at how easy and fun it is to flip through the work space
9 HR AGO
=)
9 HR AGO
One more question if that ok.
9 HR AGO
yeah, ofc
9 HR AGO
also, I need to get that VM setup for you
9 HR AGO
How can I flip through tabs on my browser faster
9 HR AGO
Ctrl+Tab
9 HR AGO
Can we do that Monday?
9 HR AGO
and to go reverse, Ctrl+Shift+Tab
9 HR AGO
yeah
9 HR AGO
that's fine with me
9 HR AGO
:weary: I should have known. I remember you showing me this before way back when.  This is what I get for not practicing.
9 HR AGO
I'm going slower on the DMT extraction this time. I'm 95% there are already crystals forming on the first jar.
9 HR AGO
Really!?
9 HR AGO
Can I see!?
9 HR AGO
What makes you say that
9 HR AGO
see why on the bottom. It's blurry. When I evaporate the naphtha, I'll show you the precipitate.
9 HR AGO
You find how to autostart it?
8 HR AGO
Not yet still working on it
8 HR AGO
lookup autostart from menu
8 HR AGO
see if that pops anything up
8 HR AGO
Image attached to message
8 HR AGO
that's it! =)
8 HR AGO
I’m having a small problem but I’m gonna try and figure it out first
8 HR AGO
Can you give me a hint real fast on what my Linux program name is there are so many out there.
8 HR AGO
Manjaro Linux is your distribution
8 HR AGO
It's a version of Arch Linux
8 HR AGO
The Arch Linux wiki is absolutely worldclass.
8 HR AGO
but, a pain*
8 HR AGO
close signal on your desktop and try this in your terminal:
8 HR AGO
signal-desktop
8 HR AGO
Terminal? Give me a sec I need to look that up too
8 HR AGO
Nvm
8 HR AGO
Got that
8 HR AGO
Cool it opened the application on the desktop right?
8 HR AGO
So the terminal is the control center?
8 HR AGO
Console, terminal, terminal emulator
8 HR AGO
try ctrl+alt+t
8 HR AGO
Got it give me a sec to try and figure this out
8 HR AGO
You use XFCE as your desktop environment. I'm firing up XFCE Manjaro in my VM right now to join you.
8 HR AGO
I’m restarting my computer to see if I did it right
8 HR AGO
oh!
8 HR AGO
nm =)
8 HR AGO
neat
8 HR AGO
Fuck yeah I did it!!!
8 HR AGO
Woot! =)
8 HR AGO
Thank you!
8 HR AGO
ha, you did it all!
8 HR AGO
I needed the little hints
8 HR AGO
we all do...I spend a lot of time googling for the hints
8 HR AGO
I swear to god, it's like 95% of what I do
8 HR AGO
I don’t think I would have gotten as fast if I didn’t get the hint of terminal is control center.
8 HR AGO
Does this apply to any application I want to use that I want it to start up with the desktop ?
8 HR AGO
it should
8 HR AGO
you used the autostart feature of XFCE, right?
8 HR AGO
That’s so cool
8 HR AGO
I don’t understand what that means.
8 HR AGO
I went to the bottom right of the screen and clicked restart
8 HR AGO
uh, how did you setup the autostart?
8 HR AGO
I have a feeling I didn’t do it now lol... 

I went into the control center and placed the code that was in the site I sent to you.
8 HR AGO
it sounds like it's already autostarting for you
8 HR AGO
goto your menu and type "autostart"
8 HR AGO
I then restated the computer to see if it would work
8 HR AGO
actually "start" will get you to "Sessions and Startup"
8 HR AGO
Ok
8 HR AGO
Got it
8 HR AGO
I see it there.  :cold_sweat::weary:
8 HR AGO
I didn’t do it lol
8 HR AGO
Ughh
8 HR AGO
Madi must have done it for me.
8 HR AGO
Thankful for it. Not complaining at all. I just thought I did something for a small sec lol
8 HR AGO
Lol. =)
8 HR AGO
