title: 2018.01.02 -- Computer Musings: Music and Invisign

I tried to get music to play while I worked on the bed. I wanted to do it without Pandora this time since I wasn't logged in. So, I went for spotify. I couldn't, for the life of me, get it to play in Chromium on Xubuntu. That's okay, I tried Google. It worked well enough. I listened to plenty of songs I've never heard. None of them were amazing, but none were awful. This was acceptable signal to noise ratio for being on the fly.

[[Python: Joint Lines]] put down in the wiki. I've not verified it yet. It may need some work. It's in about the right shape though.

[[Invisign]] was a project I worked on quite a bit of the day. Very interesting. It's a neat trick, but I'm not quite sure if I like what it would be used for.
