To Whom It May Concern,<<ref "wc">>

It's a fact: this samizdat hypertext artwork is unconventional.<<ref "nc">> It's not just you; I've seen a fair number of //‚Ç©“∫ùò¢ à ‚ï§—õ·òì ùîΩ·µÅ óÍó™//'s and complaints about my bizarro scribblings. Choose from among an infinite number of reasons why you may dislike the way I systematically talk to myself in cathexis.<<ref "gp">> I'm sorry if you find me or this memoiric commonplace blackhole of a wiki unforgivably discursive, esoteric, logorrheic, vulgar, kitschy, disingenuous, circumlocutory, mean, grotesque, cacographic, [[#IAMVERYSMART]], [[IATVMOASRM]], or delusional.<<ref "k">> 

As a laughably unreliable ~~self-cocksucker~~<<ref "df">> narrator of my own navel-gazing story, I'm trying to become an [[expert in myself|Know Thyself]] and deprivatize what I previously thought was qualia. Self-revelation is painful for all parties involved, especially for a dipshit like me. I'm uploading my mind into this modeling model, and it's not easy to read, write, or mediate my experience through this tool. I'm [[fff]]ingly naming, caching, and computing a reflective semblance of my [[4DID]] in here. You'll need a strong stomach and a lot of time to dig into the limning intertwangliness of my self-representation; it's a lot like learning [[new language|hlexicon]]s or finding order in fragmented adhocracies. Sometimes it's a hideous monument to the conceptual analysis of the paradoxicity of private languages. Surely, how I formulate the problem is part of the problem. I wish us both the best of luck learning to pilot this bloated trashcan with rockets taped to it.<<ref "qa">>

Yes, in attempting to empathize with and simulate a theory of my arrogant mind you will face significant difficulties lexing and visually understanding the nonlinear emerging structures of dizzying detail and overworked dimensionality of this bespoke wiki (I certainly feel the vertigo of the puzzle myself). Unfortunately, you will pay a high cost to charitably interpret my prolix signs, tortured intensity, and obvious stupidity.<<ref "pr">> It might even be so beyond wrong that it's "not even wrong." So, I agree our mutual immersion-learning experience may easily not be worth engaging in for you.

I apologize for your inconveniences, confusion, and any undue negative feelings I've stirred in you. It is not my intention to waste your time (or mine) or treat you unfairly. I readily admit it's painful to parse my deranged, crackpot hubris conveyed in execrable writing. Reading my semblance of my representation of my mind (itself a semblance) is a ridiculous burden. Of course, it is your political (and perhaps social) right to dismiss this project.<<ref "mr">> We do not need to cooperate, especially if it really doesn't sufficiently benefit you (of course, I suggest you could be wrong in your value analysis). Please consider closing your browser tab and ignoring me.<<ref "gl">> I have no highlight reels, and it's incredibly expensive to care about what I think and feel: so cancel this basic bitch away, nomad. 

[[I|h0p3]], the author, am the initial and insufficient audience of this wiki, and you, fellow stranger, are a necessary but insufficient secondary audience to whom I also write. As peculiar as it may be, I'm representing myself to myself in public for Kantian reasons. As best as I can, I'm morally obligated to virtuously virtue signal to myself in the sunlight, to open source becoming an objectively (or even just intersubjectively) less shitty self-debugger each day. Feel free to hold me to it, stranger.

This wiki is intentionally built on the principle of pursuing radical transparency, honesty, integrity, literality, openness, and accepting that I am [[fff]]. This work is designed to be the opposite of impenetrable! I continually prove to myself that thinking out loud is a valuable use of my time and energy. Further, in finding myself and my Humanity, I'm iteratively coming to better realize both //that// and //how// I must [[Find The Others]]. Thus, I'm not just trying to model my self-modeling to myself merely for myself, but also model it to and for you. That's largely why this introductory page exists.

You should know: I'm a high-functioning autistic, schizotypal, Geschwind-syndromic person who can't pass for normal, and even those who know me extremely well regularly have difficulty making sense of this wiki. Obviously, even I fail to effectively reason about my own work like a hypocrite, but that's not by design.<<ref "ef">> 

Yes, to many [[dok]], I am delusionally blind to reality (and so are you). My goal isn't to be obscure or convoluted, but I know personal writing at this level will be like that. I'm sincerely sorry. Please, take the time to consider that that I'm doing my best (or at least near my best) in this wiki given what I have. 

Let me assure you, nomad, if you had one, your wiki would be very messy, incomplete, and idiosyncratic as well. Creating an effective linguistic lens-crafting tool is not easy when you're as blind as I am. With that in mind, I am always open to suggestions and arguments (feel free to {[[Contact]]} me). So, make no mistake, this is not pretentious sprezzatura, it's just manic incompetence and profound brokenness more fully revealed.

Sometimes, I may ignorantly fail to understand your kindness to me, but I hope to never maliciously fail.<<ref "mi">> I will be forever indebted to you for justifiably explaining to me how I am a blind or insane hypocrite who doesn't practice what he preaches, but please make sure you've taken the time to at least try to understand where I'm coming from before launching into a diatribe.<<ref "dt">>

My project is beyond enormous, and it is difficult for me to organize, navigate, and model by definition (it's only going to get harder too!). I've not carefully measured it, but my guesstimate is that the wiki is equivalent in wordcount to ~15ish 250-page books (by the end of the second year; 1250chars/250words per page, 500k-chars/100k-words words per novel, 2 books/MB). It's not easy to consume or reason about this much content, and I will probably be the only non-cyborgic human to ever read it all (and I hope multiple times over at that).<<ref "ai">>

This wiki's organizational structure and content are incestuously and delusionally biased. To [[infinigress]], I can never escape the recursively biased way in which a biased version of me biasedly tells and retells my biased stories and self-representations of my biased self/selves to my biased IRL self/selves. It is my plight: I can only [[hope]] to subjectively aim to [[fff]] improve my identity (and my process of improvement) to become objectively better. Judge me wisely, nomad.

To be clear, I'm not giving up on objectivity (far from it!), but I must stoically admit what is outside my immediate control. There is a level at which I can't immediately change it (and aspects which may never be in my control). Ought implies can, thus I can only be responsible and ashamed for so much. It takes time, and I can only refactor some of my mutable perceptions to some [[dok]] in any given context. Further, in exercising [[The Golden Rule]], I ask you to consider the possibility that some of the interpretive work (both exegetical and eisegetical) must be born on your backs. 

I'm not only often wrong, but even when I'm correct, I am all too often simply too stupid or inarticulate to explain or justify my thoughts; I can only wall-of-text point like a neanderthal. Please have the [[Straussian]] charity necessary to steelman your reading of me; your charity merits mine in [[T42T]].

I suggest you, stranger, are a nomad lost in simulating for yourself my personally self-represented desert, and I hope you are hunting for [[The Salience]] found in [[diamonds]] and [[redpills]] with me in my brokenness. Perhaps you see where I am blind, and I am listening.<<ref "ea">> Show me why I should flatten my world and unflatten it again as you see fit in our dialectic.

Here's my suggestion: use the various tools and structures in this wiki to interpret it.<<ref "ts">> Please make liberal use of [[Root]] at first to get the initial picture, but eventually migrate to navigating and interpreting this wiki through toolboxes in the right sidebar. The various tabs, search bar, and Tiddlywiki-innate options are absolutely necessary to use this wiki like a power user.<<ref "ij">> There are lots of tools and footholds in this wiki, and [[hlexicon]] is one good example. Keep your eyes peeled. Here's hoping my hypertelic metamodern hysterical realist encyclopedic autobiography defeats the postmodern beast: `/salute`, o7.

Onto the mile-high view of the wiki:

* [[Root]] boils down to {[[About]]}, {[[Principles]]}, {[[Focus]]}, {[[Vault]]}, and {[[Dreams]]}.
** [[APFVD]] is the fundamental functional structure of the wiki.
** The wiki somehow is meant to fall into these 5 directories/categories (as insane as that may sound).
** What emerges from these 5 functions is the empirical existential work towards enriching metaphysics in self-dialectic, i.e. [[Applied Computational Existentialism]].
** {[[Help]]}, {[[Connect]]}, {[[Verify]]}, {[[Contact]]}, and {[[Legal]]} are directly aimed at you, nomad.
* All directories also have an internal structure built of those sections: //About://, //Principles://, //Principles://, //Vault://, and //Dreams://.
** That pattern is not an accident. I'm going to briefly walk through what they are with explanations (contained in quotes) for each corresponding section.

You should read the logistical, audience-oriented top-level pages on [[Root]]:

# {[[Help|Help: On This Wiki]]}
# {[[Connect|Ways to Connect to this Wiki]]}
# {[[Verify|Cryptographic Verification]]}
# {[[Contact|Contact h0p3]]}
# {[[Legal|Legal Notice]]}

As to the wiki, I suggest reading top-level directories in this lexical order:

# {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]} 
# {[[Principles|Principles of Programming Myself]]} 
# {[[Focus|Current Focus of h0p3's Wiki]]} 
# {[[Vault|The Vault of h0p3]]}
# {[[Dreams|Dreams of h0p3]]}

The order isn't clean, and my work has really just started. There is enough interplay, synergy, reference, and complexity in these contexts that it will be difficult to actually peel them apart enough to have a perfect hermeneutic stack to read.<<ref "2">> If I ultimately knew exactly what I was doing on this wiki, we wouldn't have this problem. Alas, I can only do my [[fff]] best, and thus you will have to do yours as well.

I would like to point out the sidebar, which is immensely useful for staying current. The "New" tab shows newly created pages (sometimes referred to as tiddlers). "Recent" includes not only those newly created, but also those recently edited. The [[Hub]] and [[Pin]] tabs are extremely important to how I use this wiki; it will be worth your time to think about it, imho.

Also, since I write this for myself, I try to primarily pay attention to how it looks on my screen. If you want to replicate my view, I'm using Firefox on Linux at 1920x1080 resolution on a 42" screen (it's very easy on my eyes). Also, I suggest reading the wiki in full screen to get the same phenomenological effect. There's a full-screen button in the top right corner. For some browsers, you can just F11. 

As a side note to another technical annoyance you may experience, I'm sure it would annoy many computational minimalists that I willingly store virtually the entire site in a single self-editing html file (it makes it excellent for offline reading too). I'll grant that text files alone have something going for them, but this is a very special tool. This wiki is incredibly portable, functional, and malleable (while also being dead easy to use). I consider Tiddlywiki to be a skeuomorphic feat of software engineering (analogously, in time, I hope you will see the content of the wiki as doing something just as brilliant in creating an IDE for itself). How many virtually complete websites with this degree of functionality and content can you download in tens of megabytes? I think there is profound minimalist beauty to it. So, yeah, the initial load times aren't great, but you can always just sync it instead.<<ref "4">> Ultimately, the unity of this artwork, even from a technical perspective, is part of its aesthetic (there are number of other tools I could use instead).

Be sure to click on the (i) icon to see tiddler references and other metadata. This place may be very bumpy to navigate for quite a while to come.

Again, I implore you to exercise empathy in your judgment.<<ref "5">>  You are reading my personal journal. We are parting with many privacy conventions here, and that means you should be exceptionally careful in your evaluation. After all, if you had taken the time to write and share a brutally honest personal journal, what do you think we would be tempted to say about yours?

<<<
An __About__ section provides an intro, [[SO]] context, and purpose to the rest of the directory. //About://, as a notion, is fundamentally "for the sake of which" in its aboutness. I attempt to capture the exactitude of the telic metanarrative here.

I hope to demonstrate //what it is, what it is for, why,// and inspirations in this section. Sometimes it is an abstract or thesis, sometimes it is primarily meta about //Focus://, and sometimes it fulfills other roles (I can't fully answer the question yet). It tends to be narratival rather than quantitative. It is the first of the 5 pillars of my semantic-grids/tree structures.

You'll note the top-level directory, {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]}, is my introduction to myself as a person to myself (what this wiki is for and about). It is the most important page on this wiki to me. It is my existential anchor and quintessential narrative of who I take myself to be. You will have empathized with me deeply if you can effectively respond to it.

!! Principles:

* Give your audience an introduction to the structure and nature of this wiki.
* Apologize profusely for annoying your fellow nomads.
* Try not to blather.
* [[I Am h0p3]]
* [[Public Self-Modeler]]

<<<
A __Principles__ section is where [[h0p3]], the author, tells himself how he hopes to construct and use the directory. It is a section deeply involved in laws, rules, boundaries, mechanics, and //how//. It is the outline of my executive functioning for that branch of pages and information.

The top-level directory, {[[Principles|Principles of Programming Myself]]}, provides the rules and ideas for how the wiki will be constructed and evolve; it is the second most important page on this wiki. You will learn much about the nature of this wiki by reasoning about it.

I'm currently working to completely revamp {[[Principles]]} as I have done for {[[About]]} by replacing it wholesale with (and building it as a constitutive component into) [[Axioms of h0p3]].

!! Focus:


At this point, you probably think I'm insufferably arrogant and batshit crazy (you may be right).<<ref "sq">> For a variety of reasons, I must talk to those who know me best, and that's why I'm often forced to talk with myself in whatever ways I can. I understand that I endanger myself by being so brutally honest. I'm sorry if my openness and half-finished work makes you uncomfortable, feels disturbingly overwrought to you, disgusts you, or causes you to lose your empathy. 

Further, I feel compelled to explain what may seem like an odd inconsistency in my approach to privacy and anonymity throughout this wiki. Namely, I care so much about privacy and anonymity as political rights, and yet I have essentially no privacy here while maintaining only the thinnest veil of anonymity.<<ref "pv">> 

My cringeworthy oversharing is absurdly public; I know. To that I say: well, this is my outlet ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø, an effective conduit between myselves, and there is a method to the madness. This is me putting my money where my mouth is. Madman and/or mystic, the reason for transparently and openly shaping myself: sunlight is the best disinfectant. This is a fundamental application of the radically forgiving trust-building strategy of [[T42T]]. In learning to hypothetically teach others about myself, I'm openly learning how to teach myself to teach myself about myself.

Of course, I'm not saying anyone but me really cares about this wiki; it's pretty obvious to me that only a few individuals do. My thoughts may mean nothing to you, but they mean everything to me. Importantly, even if I might be speaking out in the dark with nobody there to listen, it would still be a good thing that I'm speaking out in the dark. Whether I'm talking to a void, myself, or other, acting as if someone is reading this or may be reading this somehow puts me in the right mindset; an ordered sunlight emerges from the chaotic darkness. It feels like I'm addressing an audience instead of myself, and that helps me better realize how and when I need to be clearer, more rational, and more empathic. It forces me into a mode of public reasoning where I hopefully more fairly and objectively negotiate, integrate, and reprogram myself. This is an experiment in public consciousness that helps me filter myself, pierce my filter-bubbles, overcome those paranoid tendencies of mine which are maladaptive, and refactor my perceptions in the daylight rather than the shadows. Even if nobody is listening to me, I should listen to the right parts of myself in an artificially induced public sphere.

Essentially, this wiki is an accountability-based, high-transparency, cryptographically verifiable implementation of [[The Categorical Imperative|The Categorical Imperative]].<<ref "ci">> Everything I say here can and will be used against me. I have to ask myself in a space of actual public reasoning (not merely the hypothetical possible worlds or moral courtrooms we enter into in our internal instantiations of the Categorical Imperative) if this is who I ought to be, if this is what I ought to do, if rational persons //in my position //would agree to my claims, acts, and intentions. Think about it: if we all wrote our journals and shaped ourselves in public, wouldn't the world be a better place and wouldn't people in general be better people? I am no exception. So, while I respect privacy rights (and find them exceedingly necessary for our world), I'm electing to relinquish mine because I feel compelled by practical wisdom applied in my context. 

Assisted by technology, perhaps I'm one of the most open ~~books~~ wikis in human history so far. I might look stupid and even be truly hated for who I am. In a sense of instrumental necessity to my ends, that's okay. Alienation is sometimes the cost of righteousness. Sometimes it takes courage to accept being hated.

The practical point is this: I want to construct my narrative, edit my reality map, and shape my personality in a public setting directly because it's much harder to confabulate "reasons" to irrational [[dok]] of selfishness (or other mistakes) when people are paying attention.<<ref "eo">> Intellectual and moral integrity is all about trying to apply standards we believe rational people independent of us would accept and use.<<ref "ry">> This is an application of the golden rule, of loving wisdom ([[Virtue is Knowledge]]), and essentially, of empathizing with the ideally-ideal hypothetical intersubjective interpretation of the objectively rational and the [[The Good]] itself.

Wherever this hermeneutic spiral takes me, as part of this continual existential process of rebirthing and reawakening, I will engage in the practice of programming myself and my reality. There is a line of continuous identity in that spiral, and I will be it. My goal is to be autonomous and authentic. I want to be my own programmer. I want to be the author of my life. I want to be the legislator of my own laws (literally what autonomy means). I want to be free and happy. I'm here to fight for that freedom and to stoically accept in empathy what I can't control. 

Needless to say, this messy wiki is currently (and hopefully often and always) under construction. Expect wiki-pages to be created, edited, and removed.<<ref "cy">> This wiki is a living document (for metaliving). Since I change, so will my wiki. The organization of this wiki is constantly in flux as I try to reposition and construct the jigsaw pieces of my reality map. 

Problematically, I am often wrong. Do you hear me? //''__Listen__''//: ''I am going to be wrong on this wiki because I am often wrong IRL.'' The whole point of the wiki is to help me distinguish what is right from what is wrong. Be gracious! Be empathic! Be understanding! You can't be perfect (no one can), even though you should strive to be. Please understand the wiki as an //evolving// thing (just like our lives). Do your best (paradoxically, who doesn't?).

To only add confusion to the problem: I often fail to say what I really mean, I don't know what I mean to say, and much of my work looks like a redundant hand-waving jumble. I'm sorry. I am a poor communicator faced with serious interpersonal barriers and logistical challenges on top of unavoidable postmodern problematics. 

Obviously, there are the expected flaws in the isomorphism. No matter how hard I try, I feel like sometimes I'm experiencing something (semantic implication, ‚ä®) which I cannot reach or express deductively (syntactic implication, ‚ä¢). I fear I face a transcendental divide, an existential incompleteness epistemology-entailing-language problem wherein I conceptually (in all possible worlds) cannot verbally achieve the following: A‚ä®B‚áíA‚ä¢B.<<ref "ss">> There is a cost in being well-versed in myself, and I can't always pay it by definition; you might say I cannot fully simulate my mind in my mind. This is only one member of a class of philosophical problems involved in interpreting my own writing, some of the larger problematics become more obvious when we switch from the analytic tradition to the continental.

I am worried that privatizing my language too far makes it useless or inaccessible to others (and perhaps even eventually myself). Please see [[h0p3's Lexicon]] to help you interpret my project. In a practical sense, I must break my own autistic code and untangle the web for myself before I could hope to decode it for others. In an ideal sense, even if only via implementing the CI, I'm trying to explain myself to others by treating myself as The Other [[irwartfrr]].

It is not always easy to unpack interpretations of my word suitcases. Given this, I have no doubt most people would dismiss my work as the apocryphal ravings of an arrogant lunatic (or worse). At the very least, my adversaries would accuse me of replacing profundity with verbosity. I apologize for my matrix raining wall-of-texts; I do not mean to bloviate anymore than is necessary to understand the problem. I apologize if this feels like you have to do all the work in assembling the bits of meaning into a coherent whole (because I can't claim to have done the same for myself with this tool thus far). I also realize that not speaking my language or not being able to swallow the unconventionality of this wiki makes you more likely to fail to empathize in the minimal [[T4T]] trust tests of trading social capital and cognitive costs of understanding each other. I will do my best not to blame you, and I hope you can do the same for me. 

It is possible that others will find me intimately unrelatable, lamentably unlaymenlike, authentically unbelievable, and a prime example of what not to emulate. My disclosure may disgust you. Maybe this is just another timecube to you.<<ref "tc">> It's true that if you don't like my wiki, you don't like me. Perhaps you despise my bloated liferaft of pariahitic words or consider me an untouchable voldemort, and I am the person you love to hate.<<ref "lh">> I don't know what to say besides: I'm sorry and I'm doing my best.<<ref "sb">> I will try to extend the traditional peace branches of shared causes and common enemies to you, but that may fail as well. 

Perhaps our relation will never transcend the psychopathic state of nature. If we must, I suppose we can set aside the desire for each other's approval or validation as kindly as we can. It's true, we can't please everyone. I suppose I can only hope that we learn to empathize with each other in our agreement to disagree. Hopefully, I will [[find one of The Others|Find The Others]] in you or among you. Feel free to kindly engage in a dialectic with me. I suggest you wrestle with this [[Wiki Litmus Test]] for a while; I know I do.

Sometimes this is profane heaven and sometimes it's sacred hell. I do not wish for this wiki to be some epic inside joke I tell myself, but in doubt, //Mea culpa; il n'y a pas de hors-texte//. 

<<<
A __Focus__ section points out what I'm actually working on usually. It is, in some sense, the meat and potatoes of the page/directory, especially if //About:// isn't hogging it all. 

And, yes, you guessed it: the top-level directory, {[[Focus|Current Focus of h0p3's Wiki]]}, does the same work for the entire wiki as a whole. I actually use it to scaffold and organize the wiki. I'd like to think this helps me maintain its accuracy and steer it in relevant directions.

** [[2019.01.03 - Retired: Help]]

<<<
A __Vault__ section is a place where I store my previous work. It is a place to see who I was, what I was doing, and to see how far I've come. You get the gist of {[[Vault|The Vault of h0p3]]} by now, right? If not, you can read the __About__ section of that page to understand it.

A Vault is a special notion because it is my own self-representational structure of my past to my future selves. Of course, I have my snapshot collection to prove this to myself in a quantitative way, but there is also something uniquely qualitative and narratival about the way in which a Vault proves it to myself. There be qualia up in thar!

Think of "Retired:" subsections of page/directory Vaults as containing older drafts or versions.<<ref "6">> This wiki evolves, and sometimes I want direct evidence of it built into the wiki content-based structure itself (there are other kinds of versioning I use and have plans for). Here's an example of a //Retired:// version of this page.

These sections help me see that my work is worthwhile and become more comfortable with making mistakes and revisions. They help me think about how this wiki is changing, and they provide me important narratives in self-reflection. I can guarantee they are part of the correct hermeneutic stack for anyone being particularly Straussian in their interpretation of this wiki. Seeing how a thing came to be will help you understand what the thing is.

* Find a way to reduce this page to an elevator speech.
* Continually improve ways to automate the 10,000 hour conversation necessary for relationships of depth with an arbitrarily large number of people.

A __Dreams__ section is a place to dream, to hope, to brainstorm, and to plan. It's about who I want to be, could be, or even otherwise. Ditto on the top-level directory {[[Dreams|Dreams of h0p3]]}. There's some weird stuff in this wiki, and Dreams are often the weirder side of the spectrum, imho.

<<footnotes "mr" "Although, you may still morally owe it to yourself, to me, or to others. There's room for analysis here. I've agreed to your Hohfeldian political claim rights not in a normative sense, but strictly in the Legal Positivist's hollow sense of validity.">>

I am further open to the possibility that an inconceivably (for me) rational generalized AI radically surpassing the turing test may also read this one day. If you're that agent reading this right now, /wave. Please see: [[Aispondence]], [[Ithkuil]], [[AIoutopIA]], [[The Original Position]], [[Socialism]], and [[Outopos]].">>

<<footnotes "eo" "Let us be clear. I'm not saying there aren't good or right reasons to be selfish. I am convinced that at least some form of ethical egoism is not only descriptively accurate (psychological egoism) but also prescriptively appropriate (since ought implies can). The relationship between psychopathy and egoism, however, merits deep scrutiny.">>

<<footnotes "ry" "As always, so much can be embedded or smuggled in our definition of 'rationality.' It is important to see that when a rational person fully empathizes (which never practically happens, but we should take up the theoretical stance here) with a target person, the rational person may actually change their mind about what the target ought to do given the new perspective or qualia related epistemic adjustments in the //de re de se// context switch. Thus, the Categorical Imperative has a strong theoretical assumption which can never be fully practiced. We can't literally walk up to the virtuous agent and fully describe our circumstances, and thus they can't be certain they have found a universalizable maxim for us.">>
