[[h0p3]],

Thanks so much for helping out this stranger with that cracked copy of Ableton. For your time and effort man ... itâ€™s sincerely appreciated.

Forgive me for being unforthcoming with communication before. I guess thereâ€™s a kind of cultural awkwardness in it, for we, the jetsam on the tide line of insular Calvinism. North-Sea Scots are very Germanic ... but thatâ€™s no excuse. 

As [[Sho]], [[k0sh3k]], and yourself continue to reconnect, and since [[k0sh3k]] appeared in FB, you folks are feeling pretty real. You went out of your way to do me a good deed. Respect.

I hope we get a chance to see you folks at some point. Iâ€™m certainly better with faces than screens. Sho has issues with going back to the States, but Iâ€™m sure that she has told you already ... Thereâ€™s always a welcome here, in the Outer Hebrides.

Let me know if I can return the favour in any way man.

Regards 

[[Ä’ad|Sho]] ðŸ”¥
