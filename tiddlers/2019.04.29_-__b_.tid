Pointing out how it's bad to point out what is bad can sometimes be hypocritically ironic. Obviously, this line is not easy to draw. Sometimes it reminds me of silencing claims to be civil, conveniently ignoring the obligations which come with one's privilege, and dismissing persistent outrage as unwarranted for fear of facing one's persistent culpability. Ignoring those who point out evil is often a sign of selective apathy. Consistent empathy for [[Humanity]] is often quite painful, enough so that we must always fight the temptation to rationalize the horrible truth out of sight and out of mind. Indeed, immersively looking at what's wrong in the world, sometimes standing on the street corner to preach it, and taking daily responsibility for trying to do something about it is our moral plight. 

Dialectically, it also turns out that deconstruction is generally the first step to (re)construction. Making it a habit to identify and explain immorality is just as much your obligation as generating positive solutions. I'm highly doubtful of people who neither demonstrate any sense of moral desperation on a regular basis nor attempt to flesh out and justify any significant systematic political point of view. 

Philosophy, of course, is necessarily combative, but that comes in [[dok]]. From what I can tell, the only option after reason is unreason; and, I think we should all prefer serious discussion and preaching about what matters before resorting to violence when we can.
