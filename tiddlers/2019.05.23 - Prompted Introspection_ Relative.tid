title: 2019.05.23 - Prompted Introspection: Relative

!! Who is your favorite relative? Least favorite?

As usual, Samunwise, you ask only the most important questions. I take //a relative// to be a person connected by blood or marriage. My [[wife|k0sh3k]] is obviously my favorite relative. Duhdoy.

I don't know who my least favorite relative is. Including the 100 billion homo sapiens who have lived, I am the bloodline relative of many forms of life on this planet (and possibly beyond since both we don't know the origins of life and "blood" might be a fluid [ha, I kill myself sometimes] concept), and it's possible humans have not been the only //persons// to various [[dok]]. I prefer to be capricious and irrational in the pseudorandom selection of my most hated person on the planet urf du jour, to leave it open to my wanton desires, and to confabulate the narratives which enable me to conveniently justify any form of behavior. Yeah, selfishly and without moral justification, I probably hate my life the most (which is radically not the fault of those who obviously make my life worth living). I generally wish I didn't exist. That aint bright of me. No, no, fool, stop being yourself: be compassionate.

Wait, no, I know, it's the Effective Altruist's Moloch, that politely excusing anthropomorphized Tragedy of the Commons Neolib/con boogeyman-scapegoat built into and emerging from the complexicated incentives and structures of our societies such that we aren't really responsible for doing anything. The RaTiOnaliSt devil made me do it, right? Once we hit emergent agency territory, I'm going to pick egoists, capitalists, reactionaries, and Rand-Locke memeplex carriers as my least favorite //related// body politic collective-person. Fuck you, Golem.
