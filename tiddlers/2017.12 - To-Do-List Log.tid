!! Audit:

* I am not convinced it is worth my time to add up my pleasure events. I think I've got that down well enough.
* It took us a while to pay off the car. 
** I still need to have all the paperwork completed.
* My To-Do-Lists felt shorter this month than usual.
* I don't think I planned to reach out to people nearly as much this month. But, I did have enough contact, I believe.  
** I need to plan to call Charlie more.
* I think it was a good thing that we planned to watch shows together. 
* The title.Titles were very interesting. I like the "Diving" theme that I engaged in. The story makes sense to me. 
* I still haven't completed setting up the WIki for my wife. 
* I like that I generally planned every meal in advance. When my wife would inevtiably ask me what was for dinner, I would have an answer. This was good for us.
* We have not been so Jabba-riffic this month. 
** It has been fairly cold though. I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had. 
* Ribs have been wonderful. 
* I spent a lot of time trying to transition away from teaching the kids directly and having them get into planning their lives.
** I believe I will start work backup soon enough. I want them to be ready for it. 
* Did I dedicate too much time to reading instead of writing? I fear that I did. 
* I had to actually plan time to force myself to play some D2. I think I've lost my interest in it for now.
** Let it go.
* I started applying for the jobs at Milligan in the middle of the month. I need to complete that work. 
** I have to say, I'm doubtful that we will really have a chance of me getting a job there. 
* The house has been relatively clean, and I attribute that to planning for it. 
** I wish I had been more specific about it.
* We revamped all the computers in this house. I'm really glad we did.
** This is especially useful to my children. 
* Pizza is now planned on shopping days.
** This is actually prevented us from diving too deeply into the newly bought groceries. I think this is a good thing. 
* I never did do the transcripts. I really need to. 
* For especially busy days, I did more planning.
** I like that my planning scaled to the task. 
* My cross-out of accomplished tasks weren't consistent, and frankly, I didn't find it particularly satisfying. 
** In fact, I think it only gives me a kind of anxiety. 
* I was wrong about our migration. It look longer than I expected.
** This means I need to be more hedge-conservative in my approach to estimating what I will accomplish in a given slice of time. 
* I literally planned to chill and spend time with family.
** Is this a bad thing in a sense? I don't think so. I am worried that it is lazy or something.
* I like having a scaffold  of my day already built into my mind.
* I really need to start drawing up more effective calendars. I want that to be a practice I have down pat. This is what empathizing with my future self is really like.
