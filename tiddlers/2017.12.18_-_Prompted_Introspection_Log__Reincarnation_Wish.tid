title: 2017.12.18 - Prompted Introspection Log: Reincarnation Wish

!! If you could choose what to come back as, what would it be?

Reincarnation does not obtain in our state of affairs. For the sake of argument, let's assume it did. Again, we are in "wish" territory. I'm actually annoyed by it at this point. Samwise, are you bandwagoning? I don't want to fuck you, you retarded twit. 

Alright, so let's do this again. How specific do I get to be? Do I get to know the future? How much knowledge do I have the of the lives available? Can I run calculations on their happiness and select from there? Can I "come back" in a previous time period? Can I just choose myself again? I'm assuming you don't want me to go too crazy or specific because it "ruins the magic" of your stupid question. 

I guess I really don't have enough information to make a meaningful choice outside of some nebulous answer. I'd come back as a human, preferably a happy one. I don't know how to draw out what counts as happiness.
