Straight to voicemail, doh
Feb 1 5:18pm
Thought that was over
Feb 1 5:18pm
Will call back later tonight.
Feb 1 5:19pm
K, but before you do, found a dude that offers art classes and includes young adults, but he is a 24 minute drive from you guys, is that too far away for you to swing once a week, or can I give [[j3d1h]] the option?
Feb 1 5:21pm

How's your day been?
Feb 2 8:15pm
How's your day going?
Feb 4 12:13pm
They asked me to take time, I asked for a lay off
Feb 4 12:18pm
You mean, they are asking for overtime?
Feb 4 12:19pm
And, did they give you the lay off?
Feb 4 12:21pm
They asked me to take a furlough
Feb 4 12:21pm
And yep, just waiting on my lay off slip and I'm out to the hall to sign the book
Feb 4 12:22pm
Why would they not just hand you the lay off up front? Does it cost them anything?
Feb 4 12:23pm
They wanted me to sit at home until they had work available
Feb 4 12:27pm
But then I cant draw unemployment
Feb 4 12:27pm
And I have had 3 furloughs in as many years, dont want to just be the furlough guy
Feb 4 12:28pm
Aye. That makes sense to me.
Feb 4 12:30pm
Like, part of me wonders if it is a kind of shit-test to see if you are loyal, but I think it is more likely just an exploitative move on their part.
Feb 4 12:30pm
Reminds me of the way you transfered into the union, putting your foot down was worthy.
Feb 4 12:31pm
They should have offered both options to you.
Feb 4 12:32pm
I talked to this guy, seems to not like me much, he is a 5th year app, is 37, and said he applied right out of highschool
Feb 4 12:32pm
I would be disappointed in his shoes. lmao.
Feb 4 12:32pm
That sucks.
Feb 4 12:33pm
Its implied that if you dont want the furlough, you are asking for a lay off
Feb 4 12:33pm
Oh
Feb 4 12:33pm
I am slow.
Feb 4 12:33pm
That makes sense.
Feb 4 12:33pm
This dude failed out a few years in when he was early 20s, fucked off, got hooked and then sober, then came back and because he had failed, he had to work as a cw for 5 years before he was able to get back into the apprenticeshipxlll
Feb 4 12:35pm
Ouch. =/
Feb 4 12:35pm
And I got with only 4 years in a shitty apprenticeship, they should have made me work one year as a CE to get my hours, but the dude that tested me in was desperate to meet some quota and cheated
Feb 4 12:36pm
Soooo... I feel like I understand why they might resent me lol
Feb 4 12:37pm
Good. I think it should simply be a competence test.
Feb 4 12:37pm
Though, I doubt he tested that.
Feb 4 12:37pm
I think the resentment should be toward the structure, not you.

What's the r11 i7 in the middle?
Feb 7 10:13am

Feb 7 10:13am
But, they have a good point.
