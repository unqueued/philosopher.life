title: 2019.07.23 - Prompted Introspection: Human Character

!! Tell about a characteristic in others you admire?

[[2018.03.22 - Prompted Introspection Log: Admirable External Characteristic]] is correct. Pursuing wisdom requires openness, of course. I'd like to see less faux agreeableness, to wrestle about what matters most, to catch the predators amongst us who are nice without being kind, and to be the sort of people who actually give a shit about [[The Objective]] which we can never understand. It is painful to see Nietzsche is correct as a historian and sociologist in this respect.
