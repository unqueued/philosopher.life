title: 2018.11.15 - Be A Good Dad: Rabbitholing

My son asked me a question about the duties between creators and their creations. I walked through the asymmetry; obviously, I have argued that I owe him far more than he can possibly ever owe me. We walked through some Bible passages he was concerned with, ran through Nozick and Okrent, dismantled Libertarianism, considered [[The Golden Rule]], and jumped into a debate about `/drumroll` //freewill// yet again. This took us down a path of Fideism and inspecting compatibilism from contrarian perspectives. Wegner's conscious will as an illusion, and considering how some physicists think time is an illusion. Back to the ancient Greeks.

Jesus. We talked for hours. My children increasingly ask questions I cannot answer, and I'm increasingly forced to explain why I believe I cannot answer them. They are damned good questions. Some of the pushback and insight is enormous.

As usual, we considered virtue theory yet again, what our habituation is all about, what this dialectic is for the sake of which, etc. I need them to disagree, form their own opinions, and wrestle.

My daughter says we are //warrening// rather than //rabbitholing//. That may be correct. I also like to think we are engaged in blinking impressions resulting from dye injections into various veins of the hyperobject, taking pictures and using these various discussions to build and build a better interconnected model of the best philosophical point of view we can see.

This is why we homeschool. We push ridiculously far and hard.
