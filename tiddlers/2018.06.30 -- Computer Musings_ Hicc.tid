title: 2018.06.30 -- Computer Musings: Hicc

I had a giant hiccup today. Firefox crashed and with it my entire wiki on this laptop. I had to rebuild from m10 and Dropbox backups. Btw, I'm adoring VPNCloud! I don't give a flying fuck about my ISP's nat. I'll pierce right through that bullshit by hand. I love being able to SSH in my network without any worries. 

Living inside of 16GB of space on a laptop is a challenge. I'm narrowing it down to having 5GB of music, my wiki, and that's about it. 

I know I'm having some permission problems as well, which is annoying. Think I've fixed that as well.

I lost some work, but not a lot. I was able to find a backup from earlier this morning. For that, I am grateful. Even the TWbackup extension is failing me here. I truly just want to live on one computer, but I can't. I have to bend over backwards to get around a number of problems which are caused by immoral forces in the world.

I've decided to spruce m15 up. After working on my brother's gorgeous laptop, I want to do the same for myself.<<ref "a">>

<<footnotes "a" "It saddens me to see my brother didn't use it at all. I worry he thinks I've gypped him or something. He makes complaints about it, but it's obvious he has very little experience with it. He doesn't want to like it. That machine, these years later, is still a really slick laptop. It's 2-3 times as powerful as what I use right now. THey are his resources to waste, of course. I don't like the feeling of ungratefulness or the belief that it isn't a good tool. That I will stand up against if pressed.">>
