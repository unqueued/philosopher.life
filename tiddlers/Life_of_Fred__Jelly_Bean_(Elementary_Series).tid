title: Life of Fred: Jelly Bean (Elementary Series)

Philosophically not great, but that's not why we are reading it. I'm glad to point out the flaws. It attempts to be existential, and it does so with an unreflective bias. 

Intersections were covered. Very neat.

Fractions, slopes, units of measurement, exponents, money, etc. We're moving on up!

We have finished the elementary series! Woot!
