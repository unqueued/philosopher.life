title: The Matrix: Characters

* Thomas "Neo" "The One" Anderson
** Christ-figure.
** Keanu Reeves is the blank face actor whom most audience members can insert themselves into. They empathize with the character because he's close enough to a blank slate (and flattering in other respects) that we'd be happy to see it from his perspective.

* Trinity
** Oddly greater than the Christ-figure, at least traditionally.
** Destined to fall in love with Christ.
** Makes enormous sacrifices to Morpheus (who earned her trust), eventually The Oracle, and thus also Neo.
*** She already takes some social heat from the others, mostly Cypher, for her dedication to the cause.
** We see her freedom from The Matrix tout court, but she is also somehow fated according to The Oracle to fall in love with Neo. This is an immediate question of the nature of reality; it feels recursive.

* The Oracle
** A conundrum. I cannot speak to this character (not yet).

* Morpheus
** Plato. The origins or source of form. Formness. Isness. Goodness. 
*** "morphÄ“" is form
*** "eus" (with materials) Used to form adjectives from nouns, to indicate the source of an attribute.
** Captain of the Nebuchadnezzar
*** "O god Nabu, preserve/defend my firstborn son"
*** Captain of the vessel which protects Neo.

* Agent Smith
** Considered the primary antagonist. The authority/creator/maintainer of The Matrix, however, doesn't appear to be him. We have clues to that from the beginning. Why should we make the mistake?

* Cypher
* Apoc
* Mouse
* Jones & Brown Agents
* The Red Woman
* DuJour (The White Rabbit Girl) 

* Tank
** Muscle Kin #1. Fodder.

* Dozer
** Muscle Kin #2. Fodder.
