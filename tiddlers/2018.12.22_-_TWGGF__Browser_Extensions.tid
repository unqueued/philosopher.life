title: 2018.12.22 - TWGGF: Browser Extensions

I'm moving to Chromium as the primary browser I use specifically for editing my wiki (it's not where I do my browsing). When I'm in the driver's seat, sometimes my browser's extensions are just as useful as my TW plugins (it's like having a second set of plugins, imho). I'm hunting for extensions suitable for TW. I thought it might be worth asking: what do you use?

I'll start us off with some extensions.
