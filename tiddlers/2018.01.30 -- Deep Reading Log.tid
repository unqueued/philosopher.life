title: 2018.01.30 -- Deep Reading Log

I'm trying a new tactic out. I'm going to research a book before I read (and not just after). My verbal reasoning is low enough this might be worthwhile. I've never done it this way, so I'm going to try. Spoilers and losing objectivity is a problem, but in a way, I think I already have a profound lens through which I view everything. So, I am doing science here. I want to know if this is a good plan or not.

!! Chapter 1

Carolyn is a badass. She also sounds hot and psychopathic at the same time. I'm going to have mixed feelings about her. She attempts to not kill needlessly, of course. She doesn't know whether to love or hate //home//.

Pelapi: Librarian + Pupil

Twelve catalogues. Go forth, my disciples. Father is Zeus and all gods rolled into something. This shit is cold as fuck. I will pay close attention to the use and non-use of empathy in this story. 

Guile. What is Carolyn's guile? How does it relate to language? How are librarians, language, power, and reality related?

Why the fuck is Father giving up his powers, or at least teaching others to have them? What is this lineage? Their power is compartmentalized, and I don't know why. Is this a chaotic pitladder?

Why are they looking for Father? What does that even mean? And, who is Duke? What does it mean for father to not be in the future and not dead. Is he alive only in their minds? Is there a noumena to which he escapes?

It is very interesting to see how trust in their relationships are built, test, and violated.
