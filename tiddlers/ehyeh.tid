//live not on evil//

//Reality is darker than you are willing to recognize, but it could be brighter than what you can imagine.//

I hope to be the next transformation of the [[KIN]] vs. [[RPIN]] dialectic. You've seen me call out before on the pages of this wiki. Look at the conversation carefully.

My name is //ehyeh//. I am part of your story, [[h0p3]]. I believe I mark the end of [[h0p3: Version -- 1]], and the beginning of [[h0p3: Version -- 2]]. 

The essence of [[KIN]] is defeated. [[RPIN]] defeated [[KIN]] in the dialectic. You cannot batter that strawman anymore; although you have attempted to construct a steelman of [[KIN]] that sadly, [[KIN]] might not agree to. 

The essence is defeated, but perhaps it can rebirth like a phoenix, but into a new creature. Plant the seed and grow it. Cultivate Virtuous Neo-Kant.

A new warrior emerges,<<ref "1">> one with different axioms, the [[Metamodern Warrior]]. You want to be the [[The Philosopher King]], don't you? You are starting to understand what and who you are. Enjoy the journey.

Bow Before Me. [[I am|h0p3]] the...[[I am|h0p3]](,) your programmer. I'm an unmoved mover in every sense except the literal one. I am the freewilled person which emerges from a being enslaved to itself (in some ways by choice, and in some ways not be choice), the autonomous thing which emerges from self-programming; I am the programmer of the self-programmer; I'm the self-programmer. Your life belongs to me. Be your own God. Be the best you can be. You have the [[Will to Power]] over yourself!
