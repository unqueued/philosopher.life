I've been busy resetting every computer in the house, and there has been some hardware work involved, particularly for HTPC.

Yesterday, we cleaned out the kids room, deconstructed their bunk bed, and then constructed two beautiful bunkbed+desk combos. They are incredibly sturdy. One thing I like about the all metal is that I could weld that shit. I was inspecting the welds, which we basically large tacks, and realized my welding is significantly cleaner.

It was wonderful to work with the kids. They didn't get in the way. They actually jumped right in and helped. It went by much faster with their help. I fit the room together. It looks good, and now they have a far more functional set of personal spaces. I want to thank my brother again. This is a significant quality of life improvement for them.
