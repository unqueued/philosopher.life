Good morning, [[K]]. What's your plans for today?
MON 7:56 AM
Good morning! Work and school and grocery shopping and working on another paper.
MON 8:49 AM
What about you?
MON 8:49 AM
You have a packed day, homie.
MON 9:21 AM
I'm writing letters, hopefully testing m16 with my wife's approval, homeschooling, and work. If I'm lucky, I get lucky today /fingers-crossed.
MON 9:22 AM
Only always. 

Sounds like a full plate. I wish you the BEST of luck. ;)
MON 10:47 AM
Lol!
MON 10:48 AM
Thank you, sir.

The paper on Taoism and the collection of poetry is messy. Very very messy. I may be expanding it out to fully encapsulate Buddhism just to make up the difference in page length. 

I’m also writing a paper on the Odyssey which is due next Monday. I should probably start reading it. :D
MON 10:49 AM
The Odyssey paper sounds easier and somehow more boring to me.
MON 10:50 AM
You have a lot to do, lol.

[[k0sh3k]] is reading the Tao Te Ching this week.
MON 10:51 AM
I’m just glad I have sparknotes. I genuinely want to read it but I don’t have time...
MON 10:51 AM
Nice! I hope she enjoys it. :)
MON 10:51 AM
It’s a good read. I’m surprised that I was able to retain so much from it for this assignment.

Her boss is a scholar in the topic. He's given her the book outright because he's so excited to talk about it with her.
MON 10:52 AM
It's an interesting work, no doubt.

Redpilled, realpolitik, with dogwhistles to those in power vs those who have none, and enough relativism to buy any zen psychopathy one might prefer in a context.
