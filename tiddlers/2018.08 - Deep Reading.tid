!! Audit:

* I finished [[Infinite Jest]]. I admire the dedication it took to make that work. I feel a real kinship with it in creating this wiki. I actually had fun in the first 500 pages of the book, but around the 750 marker, I just wanted the hell to end. Perhaps I'm uncouth or something.
** Maybe one day I'll come back to and love it, but I just don't see that happening.
* Once I finish IJ, I started reading other books.
* [[JASG]] is pure hell. Most of the time, when I dissect an author's words that closely, I'm learning something from the experience. I didn't wrestle with anything besides not being mean in how I delivered my critique.
* //Lost in the Cosmos// was an amazing book. Yeah, it's a self-help book, and I know that is frowned upon. I don't know why though. This was worth my time.
** It worries me that I'm having such a hard time coming up with books as good as this one. 
* The "Introducing" graphic intros make for excellent bathroom reading. I hope to read them all. I like walking out of the bathroom with something to say.
* I'm working my way through //The Ego Tunnel// slowly. I should probably give it another run through. Arguing against it would be valuable for forming my own view at a high level.
* H2MCM was more random and poorly constructed than I hoped it would be, but still very interesting. I feel a kinship with this book as well.
* Dune, Hobbit, HP, and LOTR are just classics. I'm pulling a Montaigne and just reading for nostalgic fun here.
** I'm surprised I have anything to say at all.
* I suppose a book every 3 days isn't bad. It ain't great though. I definitely don't have the will power of a standard academic, although I still feel like young schola'.
* I did a good job reading this month.
