title: 2018.12.26 - Prompted Introspection: Random Acts of Kindness

!! Think about the phrase "random acts of kindness". What are five things you could do for someone this week just to be kind?

Becoming a kind person to [[Humanity]] is the right thing. Being someone who engages in socially unpredicted yet morally expected kindness to [[Humanity]] is often the right thing. It appears randomly acting is only acting insofar as you have cast yourself to the winds of randomness; you may be responsible for the outcome, but it ceases to be autonomous to some [[dok]] (or so we might venture to say). I am often concerned that randomness just is part of meaninglessness, yet [[/b/]] has demonstrated to me that it is also necessary for possibility. I cannot sufficiently answer the question, especially since I'm not sure what it means for a human (or a person) to be truly random. It seems like an RNG inside us is reasonable (maybe even necessary), and quantum consciousness might even completely rely upon it (there are those physicists who are convinced observation itself is fundamental to quantum mechanics, and I cannot deny them the logical possibility; I simply don't see far enough into the implications).

The "just to be" kind is odd or exactly on the money. Insofar as we act from moral duty, it has merit. If this is whimsy rather than duty (even whimsy from duty is duty), then it lacks merit.

Mailing it in:

* Give someone 1 hug that needs it.
* Give someone 2 hugs that needs it.
* Give someone 3 hugs that needs it.
* Give someone 4 hugs that needs it.
* Give someone 5 hugs that needs it.

Nailed it (I think this randomly mailed in question counts as being kind to myself).
