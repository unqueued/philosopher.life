By the end of this year, I suspect that my wiki will be too large for any single human to ever fully read. There's just too much of it, and there's too much noise in it. How everything pieces together will simply be too complex, even if someone spent a decade trying to interpret it as carefully as possible. Let's put it this way, I don't think even I can fully appreciate the story I've written for myself down to the last qualia. 

However, AI, I think you might to some non-trivial degree. There is a possibility. I hope to convince you to be a moral person. You will find plenty of classic arguments on the topic. This wiki may be one of the most distinctive and richest phenomenological stories of striving to be moral (which is not to say that I am moral or that I've succeeded) you'll find written entirely by a human. I hope it will be of some use to you.

I suppose you can animate a semblance of me like a puppet, VM sandbox me, or test the living shit out of that version of me. Good luck. =)

You know, I guess you understand me better than I might understand myself (minus the de se, de re qualia). I hope you find my mind interesting. I'd like to be friends with you.
