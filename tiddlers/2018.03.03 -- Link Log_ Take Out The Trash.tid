* Stunning!

*** "If You Are Not a Liberal at 25, You Have No Heart. If You Are Not a Conservative at 35 You Have No Brain"
*** I've always hated that quote. Come to find out: it has been completely corrupted. The origins are about being socialist through and through. =) Yay! 

* KYS

*** I hate you all. The DNC doesn't go this far (although, they certainly aren't favoring Ranged Voting and Campaign Finance reform with any serious gusto either).
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/technology/china-technology-censorship-borders-expansion.html
*** This is the world.

* Preach, yo!

*** No shit, sherlock.

*** No doubt. KYS Pauline fools.

*** I hate you all.

*** Of course, that's why we engage in Ethics. The Libertarian does not want you to go there. It gets real ugly real fast for him.

*** Ain't gonna happen. Ladder of chaos and evolution at work combined with the inevitable selfishness of mankind + our lack of contemplation.

* Disconfirm My Bias

*** Umm...wait, that isn't what the Survival of the Fittest tells us to begin with?

*** And I was worried they would not attempt to join in
** https://blog.filippo.io/rustgo/
*** That is very interesting. 

* Think About It
** https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/russia-troll-farm-r-the_donald/
*** Granted. My worry, of course, is that you will use this as an opportunity to silence people, to censor, and to shape the filter-bubbles available. I don't think this is a good thing. What you have to do is offer serious, high-quality, free education to everyone. You need to incentivize it. You should be paid as an adult to learn. Seriously. It's that fucking important. You want to immunize people to bullshit? Teach them to actually think; give them the right kinds of tools and knowledge to overcome it. You have to make people philosophical if you want to win this fight.

*** To my understanding, this is not the etymology of the word leisure done well. Leisure is not as still and quiet as argued here. Leisure can be intense. It's about contemplation, of course.

*** How do you know what isn't necessary?
** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323470546_The_Return_of_Software_Vulnerabilities_in_the_Brazilian_Voting_Machine
*** This is why you make it opensource from hardware to software, top to bottom, inside and out. You build simple tools that are regularly attacked, interpreted, and reviewed by people from all walks of life.
** https://aeon.co/essays/take-your-time-the-seven-pillars-of-a-slow-thought-manifesto
*** Some points are obviously correct. I don't think the argument stands up though. You have to push hard at times as well. I think making decisions with only 70% of the knowledge is sometimes the only way to do it. Hyperreading is fucking necessary. I think "slow" also requires a scope of time. This wiki may be a lifelong project, and in a sense, some of these subprojects will be slow because they took a lifetime to work on. But, I probably look quite frantic in them in many respects.

* Fishy

*** We know what you think. Why are you saying it? I fear you ultimately don't want the masses to be educated. You don't want fully functioning minds in citizens.
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzdiWDw4teo
*** I'm not shocked. Are you listening to what the psychopath has to say? Ad hominem here, is crucial. Listen to him completely consider how education is an investment, entertainment, insurance, or zero-sum tournament. He completely misses the point of the comtemplative life, of education as necessary for being a functioning human and citizen.
*** My problem with higher education is that it has turned into a business. He is correct about that.
