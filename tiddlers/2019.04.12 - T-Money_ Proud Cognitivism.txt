Have you Ever read anything by Jordan Peterson?
FRI 10:01 AM
Only a bit.
FRI 10:16 AM
My step dad gave me a book for Christmas. I intend to read it. But I feel like bouncing some of the ideas off you. I will mark and then write in a letter the concerns or questions I have.
FRI 10:17 AM
My stepfather is highly educated. But he has grown older, callous, I think he has mental problems, and as I once idolized his intellect.
FRI 10:18 AM
I discovered. I have one of my own! Lol
FRI 10:18 AM
Bounce away. I will give you the best answers I can.
FRI 10:19 AM
Would you like me to read the book with you?
FRI 10:19 AM
No
 Cause you'll be done tomorrow. And I'll still be on the fwd. If YOU want to read it. It is Jordan Peterson 12 rules for life.
FRI 10:20 AM
Lol. I'm still. Laughing at the first part of that statement.
FRI 10:20 AM
Would you like an audiobook copy?
FRI 10:23 AM
No thanks. I got the hard copy. I gotta makes notes.
FRI 10:25 AM
There is a general disapproval of him online by the left because the alt right pick him as a mascot. Unwillingly. However as a clinical psychologist PhD I find his accounts of quest for self improvement appealing in a non standard way.
FRI 10:27 AM
I am attempting to come at this with an unbiased perspective and see what comes out.
FRI 10:28 AM
My suggestion is to read his enemies too then.
FRI 10:29 AM
Being unbiased is going to require not only steelmanning his argument, but also steelmanning his opposition.
FRI 10:30 AM
One book at a time honcho. I ain't no MF speed reader and I gotta hard stuff more than once to "get it"
FRI 10:35 AM
I'm pretty lazy when it comes to lots of books. It helps to gather summaries, analyses, reviews, outlines, responses, etc.
FRI 10:36 AM
I've gotten to the point that I will put books down as well (trying to avoid the sunk cost fallacy).
FRI 10:37 AM
I usually walk up to a book already have a basic understand of what it's about before I decide to read it.
FRI 10:38 AM
Researching the book before will save you a ton of time that way you can do your analysis as you read. Otherwise, it requires reading it multiple times in cycles.
FRI 10:38 AM
Peterson and Zizek have a public ~~debate~~ spectacle coming up. I'm interested to see it.
FRI 10:39 AM
I have not dedicated much effort to expanding my intellect past  the 4 years I spent at Berea.
FRI 10:40 AM
Yes I studied aviation for 2.5 years but that was very practical and required minimal effort to me.
FRI 10:41 AM
Well, it sounds like you have in some respects. I think working in trades and practical work is still intellectual work. I think it is "minimal" in the sense that it isn't painful to you.
FRI 10:41 AM
And, solid, tangible rewards
FRI 10:42 AM
Indeed. Building killing machines. =)
FRI 10:42 AM
(funny not funny)
FRI 10:42 AM
I have started and stopped alot of books recently due to Lack of interest. Poor writing, boring, or just plain dumb.
FRI 10:43 AM
But some of the books my stepfather has encouraged me to read have been amazing.
FRI 10:44 AM
A prayer for Owen meany
FRI 10:44 AM
Milan kunderea " the unbearable lightness of being.
FRI 10:45 AM
Watching videos on zizek
FRI 10:53 AM
You might find this a fascinating read: https://philosopher.life/#The%2048%20Laws%20of%20Power
FRI 10:59 AM
Why is it that I agree with 90% of these laws. Machivellian "the prince" was one of my most favored readings in GSTR
FRI 11:16 AM
But I distain the quest and games for power. I am tires, and fed up with it. I have played these games at every job position I have had.
FRI 11:17 AM
In many cases rising to the top, only to find loneliness and boring shit.
FRI 11:17 AM
I desire a deeper connection than power. Power and what I can and will do with it scares me.
FRI 11:18 AM
I have no desire to fabricate a person to achieve these goals. I prefer to be easily forgotten and replaceable.
FRI 11:19 AM
My youthful ambition is gone.
FRI 11:20 AM
By age 29 I had arrived at the pinnacle of my own economic and career success with nowhere to go but up. And I walked away. Disgusted with myself.
FRI 11:21 AM
It is a good read, these rules are true. But I don't find they bring about happiness.
FRI 11:22 AM
Well, I'll leave you to think about it.
FRI 11:25 AM
I have to AFK.
FRI 11:25 AM
10 4
FRI 11:26 AM
So is the 48 laws of power your writing. Are these 48 laws a formula for how you live?
FRI 5:14 PM
Nope, that's just a outline of a book. I consider offering the same to you for Peterson's book.
FRI 6:09 PM
As I say at the top, I think it is descriptively accurate of dark-triadicism and how many humans behave.
FRI 6:09 PM
I think those techniques work.
FRI 6:09 PM
I rarely agree to the use of them, but I believe they are justified understand some circumstances. Most of the time, I think it's plain evil.
FRI 6:10 PM
I agree that they are effective. I have used them in excess. But I  rather be just honest me and be abused for my empathy than deceitful and power hungry.
FRI 6:48 PM
Which despite my lack of interest. My current job allows me that. I can be me without apology. And just make the boss man happy.
FRI 6:49 PM
Don't get too involved with my coworkers and just do my time and come. Home.
FRI 6:49 PM
I have spent a few hours on your wiki today. I am intrigued by a revelation about your brother and your father.
FRI 6:50 PM
I was shocked to read your honest description and critique of your father.
FRI 6:51 PM
And if I did not misread, I understand that your brother is gay?
FRI 6:51 PM
Aye, I think they are psychopaths.
FRI 6:55 PM
My donors* that is
FRI 6:55 PM
exceptionally talented at abusing those 48 laws
FRI 6:55 PM
That description is quite brief.
FRI 6:56 PM
My brother, [[AIR]], is gay.
FRI 6:56 PM
Not your younger brother that went to Berea?
FRI 6:57 PM
Not [[JRE]].
FRI 6:58 PM
or [[JRE]]. I forget his name. We were never close or spoke.
FRI 6:58 PM
My youngest brother, [[AIR]].
FRI 6:58 PM
He wasn't allowed to attend Berea because they would encourage and enable him to be gay.
FRI 6:58 PM
Your parents didn't allow this?
FRI 6:59 PM
Correct.
FRI 6:59 PM
I have always been interested in your upbringing.
FRI 6:59 PM
Forgive me if I ask to. Much
FRI 6:59 PM
The beginnings are there in {[[Vault]]}
FRI 6:59 PM
You don't. You have to read the wiki, lol.
FRI 6:59 PM
[[Prompted Instrospection]] is an excellent source of information as well.
FRI 7:00 PM
Well, I have been diving today into lectures, your wiki, Peterson book, zizek's lectures, and a rubix cube.
FRI 7:01 PM
That sounds like a heckuva day, lol.
FRI 7:02 PM
I strongly suggest learning the F2L method from the beginning.
FRI 7:02 PM
That's where you pickup all your major speed.
FRI 7:03 PM
And, it teaches all the right intuitions.
FRI 7:03 PM
I'm just memorizing the algorithms and trying not to fuck that up. Easier said than done.
FRI 7:04 PM
Kinda reminds me of learning a new solo on guitar.
FRI 7:04 PM
Only memorize algorithms for the top layer, the bottom 2 should be done by hand. Make your cross, F2L, and then finish with algorithms.
FRI 7:04 PM
It takes longer to begin with, but it pays for itself very quickly.
FRI 7:05 PM
Aye, I think it's a lot like music.
FRI 7:05 PM
You just kinda blew my method with the f2l. But i have never solved one... And I don't think the difficulty is there. It's just learning... Like anything.
FRI 7:07 PM
F2L is about looking ahead, about seeing which solutions have the shortest paths including hand movements. Top layer memorization can only be practiced so far, and you hit severe diminishing returns for how many algos you should memorize. Look ahead is everything.
FRI 7:10 PM
Researching now.
FRI 7:10 PM

FRI 7:11 PM
I'm a fan of this dude.
FRI 7:12 PM
I have peaked for today. Time to put the intellect down. =)
FRI 7:39 PM
Chillax, homie
FRI 7:39 PM
We have started a new show. Called young Sheldon with the kiddo. It is a spin off of the big bang theory. It's really good and kid friendly.
FRI 7:39 PM
Haven't seen it before. It's been a long time since I watched the Big Bang Theory.
FRI 7:41 PM
So its about him growing up. Little 9 year old genius and his normal family. I enjoy watching it with the fam.
FRI 7:42 PM
It's wonderful to have shared stories with our children.
FRI 7:42 PM
I rely upon them for metaphors, drawing contextual parallels, and reasoning about the world.
FRI 7:43 PM
Also, it gives us a memebase.
FRI 7:43 PM
I just try to relax with the fam. You over think it.
FRI 7:44 PM
Lol
FRI 7:44 PM
I prepare them for a desert.
FRI 7:44 PM
We relax, of course.
FRI 7:44 PM
My children are exposed to me 12 hours a day. I have spent more time with them already than most parents do with their children over their entire lives.
FRI 7:44 PM
We play, but we work hard too.
FRI 7:45 PM
You should. Lock your door at night.
FRI 7:45 PM
Jk
FRI 7:45 PM
Lol
FRI 7:45 PM
Lol
FRI 7:46 PM
Yeah, I'm extremely difficult to live with.
FRI 7:46 PM
I choose not to attempt to imagine. =)
FRI 7:47 PM
I am no Saint.
FRI 7:48 PM
me neithe
FRI 7:48 PM
My kid already is leaps and bounds ahead of where I was as a kid... I don't push. I lecture and suggest.
FRI 7:51 PM
My only push is manual labor. And I am very short tempered when it comes to that.
FRI 7:52 PM
But your kids are like college level and mine is lucky to tell time correctly. Haha
FRI 7:55 PM
