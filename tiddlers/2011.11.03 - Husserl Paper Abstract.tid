title: 2011.11.03 - Husserl Paper Abstract

In this paper, I explore the concepts of apodicticity and objectivity in Husserl’s phenomenology. I consider: why Husserl is interested in apodicticity and objectivity, what he means by these concepts, and how he believes phenomenology yields apodictic and objective results. In addition, I evaluate the nature and status of logic, particularly with respect to apodicticity and objectivity. I am unsatisfied with Husserl’s notion of objectivity, and I’m not convinced his phenomenology is functional unless he lowers the methodological requirements below the supremely high epistemic standards of apodicticity and objectivity. It is possible that Husserl’s concepts of apodicticity and objectivity evolved and were redefined throughout his body of work, evolving from a very high standard to a lower standard (which isn’t a bad thing), as perhaps he saw the necessity of this change given how it doesn’t seem as though his own phenomenology can live up to these original standards. It makes more sense to perform phenomenological research without having to meet Husserl’s original standards of apodicticity and objectivity. Instead, a healthy amount of doubt and a relatively strong (but not apodictically-based or completely objective) justificatory standard seem both prudent and fruitful. I conclude that charitable interpretations or reconstructions of Husserl’s phenomenology will relax these original Husserlian standards of apodicticity and objectivity.
