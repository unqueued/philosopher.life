title: 2019.06.29 - Ovy: Heyas!

I am not sure if this thing saved or not, so here I am writing it up once again. Oh well it helps my daily word count (is there a way of doing that on TW?).

Quite honesty, I do not know where to begin. Here is my progress sensei. 

As I told you, my prime writing and thus journaling is on writer, the internet typewriter. It is everywhere, loyally. After I open it up on ipad, chromebook, iPhone, or anything. Any additional notes I put on zoho notes then transfer later. But I would like to have something for my archives (journal) where I can put pictures, turn it into a true chronicle of my life. 

So this is how I have explored the wiki world so far:

* I downloaded TW and tried to find a host that can sync across all my myriad devices. Quine was ok, primitive and loading it to tiddledrive was quite clunky. Further getting something from tiddledrive into Quine was a pain in the wiki. I also explored tiddlespot but then I heard that it transfers with no security. I posted on the google group for advice. Yeah I know, my apple is  clunky and has way too much DRM. So I need a central host that is secure. Of course everyone wants something that is free. 

* I am a fanatic of the terminal green screen, like apps such as dark room etc. If I could find a palette that mimics that, it would be great, also posted on the group.

* So easy sync, always there, and a great dark room palette would be my present goals. 

* let me say that your archives are stunning. It is like entering a stream of consciousness with a matrix style. I frankly canâ€™t believe it only took you three years. 

* I am not sure how we maintain this conversation here. Or get notified of updates. Let me know.
