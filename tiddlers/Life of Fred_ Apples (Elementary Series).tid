title: Life of Fred: Apples (Elementary Series)

This was an interesting opener to mathematics. I've never seen anything like it. It's slower than it has to be, and I like that. It's gentle while still somehow foreshadowing and previewing really hard the entire time.

The story blows, but it's okay. We just need some kind of fantasy world to live in. This is a hypothetical world building device, and then we get to draw analogies to our world. We pass through the gateway of making math real to us very early, easily, and with a breathtaking consistency by practicing what we do in this book.
