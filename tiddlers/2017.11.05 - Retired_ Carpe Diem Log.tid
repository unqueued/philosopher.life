title: 2017.11.05 - Retired: Carpe Diem Log

!! About:

//Play Life like a video game!//

Here I count my blessings, give you the skinny on my day, and give myself yet another avenue to see patterns in my life.

---
!! Principles:

The maxim //carpe diem// is an abbreviation of the Horacian phrase //carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero//, which can be translated as "Seize the day, put very little trust in tomorrow." 

We should squeeze every drop of utility out of every moment. We must make the most of our time because we want to be maximally happy, we don't know how much we have left, and our time is a resource we can never renew. We must spend our lives wisely, efficiently, and with joy. We must at the same time empathize and identify with our future selves while still living in the moment.<<ref "1">>

Here I count my blessings, talk about how I spent my time, in general, each day (not just my occupation), and perhaps reflect a bit. I may even draw up plans and make to-do-lists. I hope to hold myself accountable to this log's namesake, a maxim which we all hope to live by.
