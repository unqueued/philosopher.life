h0p3
aye, it popped up in my RSS feeds
rjrbt
oh nice! cool.
(didn't mean to spam you)
I forgot I got RSS properly setup two posts ago ðŸ˜‚
EDITED
h0p3
reminds me of Kierkegaardian aesthetic mode
rjrbt
(I'm also always looking forward to your feedback. I enjoy our conversations)
h0p3
Well, I'm not quite sure what to say.
It's going to be hard to bridge the gap with you, since I think you're epistemic position results in moral relativism. It's hard not to see this as an attempt at effective hedonism (which, I take to be necessary but insufficient for eudaimonia). Your argument is existentialist. The phenomenology and use of boredom is an important topic. 
your* epistemic
rjrbt
see. love it.
So, I'd love to hear about your views on eudaimonia

This is my evolving letter to myself on the topic: https://philosopher.life/#About%2C%20The%20Opening%20of%20the%20Rabbithole:%5B%5BAbout%2C%20The%20Opening%20of%20the%20Rabbithole%5D%5D
rjrbt
very cool.
ok. There exists some intrinisic good
h0p3
Agreed
rjrbt
as in, this is a fundimental material in the universe?
h0p3
I'm not sure what to say about it.
Is it a property of objects? Maybe.
rjrbt
yeah, this isn't a devil's advocate trap, I'm just curious, I hadn't thought of good that way.
h0p3
I think it's metaphysics though intervening on the physical universe.
rjrbt
I've always felt good was based off of an evolutionary need of humans to socially qualify things that preserve dna propigation from things that don't
h0p3
I discuss that quite a bit. I appreciate that point of view. It's a crucial redpill that we must swallow.
rjrbt
so if good is more fundamental than that, is the universe itself able to be "not good". I'd imagine goodness would present itself in things like "phsyics following its own laws"
I enjoy the optimism that comes with the idea that good may be a more fundamental thing.
I think that could be something to it if the human brain "taps into something" like an antenna rather than manifests things in an emergent way
h0p3
Are we perceiving something outside ourselves or merely something inside ourselves?
rjrbt
with interesting theories like String Theory, materialists like me would have a real adjustment to make if we are antenna rather than manifestors exclusively
h0p3
That might be a rough way to say it.
rjrbt
antenna is an oversimplifcation, for sure
h0p3
No, I very much like your metaphor. It's a good one.
rjrbt
I wish I could find the link, but I was reading, and barely grasping the description of possible fundamental structures by a theoretical physist that was pretty radical sounding
h0p3
Mathematical Platonism?
rjrbt
that quantum particles could be higher dimentional crystal structures and that quantization was just a manifestation of stable structures in our experienced spacetime
sort of like how the early astronomers had mathematically accurate predictions of the movement of the planets and the stars, but a fundamental misunderstanding of our place in the heavens (revolutionary theory representing a simplification to the models)

?
rjrbt
ah, that is slightly different. but I've read that as well.
though I think its a beutiful idea, I'm not sure how useful it is in that I don't think we have a way of testing that.
I love the idea that the universe is "just in time" colapsing probability curves as we poke the box and before that, even the universe hasn't made up its mind
h0p3
Do you believe there exists contingency?
rjrbt
meaning?
h0p3
Do you think that there is at least one possible thing which is not necessarily true or necessarily extant?
It is a problem for me, and I take it on blind faith.
rjrbt
meaning, can we imagine something that is impossible given infinite time?
h0p3
Are there are truths which could possibly be otherwise?
any*
This extends well beyond determinism.
rjrbt
wow, this is something I'd never thought about.
I think this falls squarely in "i don't know"
h0p3
Wait, stop, sorry.
Sometimes I take your "I don't know" to be the very, very high epistemic standard of internalists, a skepticism which takes knowledge to be certainty.
Do you mean that here?
Many internalists don't take up that standard, but it's one of the important starting places on that epistemic view, imho.
The Cartesian Doubt, etc.
rjrbt
yeah - for me "i don't know" means that I'm willing to entertain seemingly contradictory ideas to try to explain something, because I don't have a first principal to address it.
h0p3
=) I love the way you said that. 
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/
rjrbt
you like my folksy autodidactic epistemophilia
ðŸ˜‚
h0p3
You are clearly talented.
I'm folksy too, imho.
rjrbt
folksy and authentic are siblings, in my opinion
h0p3
Perhaps it is because we do our best to say what we mean and mean what we say with the resources at our disposal.
very cool.
h0p3
I have no experience with Haskell (Nix is probably the closest I've really thought about). Lazy evaluation is very cool though. You are juicing my intuitions here, even though I can't see the object you are pointing (yet). 
Indeed, to my chagrin (previously my horror and anathema), I believe that there is at least one true contradiction, an absurdity I must accept. 
I really do believe in the transcendent, even though I have no idea (and can never really know) what it means. 
There are several excellent proofs which demonstrate it can never be expressed, but I do hope to point to it.
I try to hold out as long as possible before I'm forced to point to it in faith.
(or perhaps, from your point of view, I open with it!)
rjrbt
by transcendent, what do you mean?
h0p3
That is the trick.
That I think there is something outside the representation I attend to in my mind is a version of it.
Belief in an external world is a faith.
I think GÃ¶del's incompleteness may be pointing to it as well. If the physical universe is expressed as a kind of language, there appear to be things which are true that it cannot express. The ontic status of this truth appears transcendent to me. 
Exactly what it means for a contradiction to be true is something which I can never really know the meaning of, not even theoretically. I think it transcends me.
We're deep in speculative territory here. I can only give you the best vision and definition I can. I realize it may appear insane.
I'm in a weird place where I can't say the world is ontically or epistemically logical for a finite creature, and I have to reductively make a model of something which I can't actually safely model.
Metaphysics is this gateway out of the cave that I point to. I don't even know how to talk about it.
I certainly feel the call of: What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Skepticism matters to me. 
rjrbt
yeah, fascinating
we still have to explore what our gut tells us, but I think both you and I have high standards on what we'd use in prediction models
h0p3
Indeed, we face a problem of induction here. I appreciate anti-realism; I think it shapes me in the dialectic.
