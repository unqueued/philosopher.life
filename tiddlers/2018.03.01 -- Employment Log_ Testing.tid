title: 2018.03.01 -- Employment Log: Testing

I've found out that some employers do extensive psychometric testing. I want to know what that looks like. I need to understand the lens through which they interpret me. I'm going to continue some of the standard the psychometrics for employment that I'm missing.

* Inductive Reasoning
* Resilience Questionnaire
* Survey of Dictionary-based Isms

It is clear to me that I'll need to train my children in taking these tests. They will become more common.
