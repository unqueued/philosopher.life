Today was quite disappointing. The torque class has been a true waste of my time.

This teacher rubs me the wrong way. He's intrusive and controlling. He is clearly interested in the welfare of businesses more than his students. He's a Snap-on salesman with official Snap-on education/sales slides; he pushes hard. His discussion of ethics and politics was frightening in its ignorance and selfishness.

Know which wrench they are asking a question about.

* The first wrench is the "Snap-on(R) Techwrench"
** All it does is torque 
** There is a Preset "D" model
*** Administrator password for changing torque settings

* The second is the Snap-on Tech memory wrench
** Records 1000 pulls at a time.
** Meant for monitoring the employee via Bluetooth.

Calibration is 4 times more accurate than the wrench itself. (He repeated himself, so he'll probably have us test on it).

I left slightly early.
