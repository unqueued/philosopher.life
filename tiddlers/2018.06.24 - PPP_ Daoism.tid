wuwei (“effortless action”) sounds like fastmind, ready-to-hand, virtue-theoretic habituation by name. I will find out, I hope.

Look, if you have a ritual dance to go with your belief, that's a bad sign that the meme isn't fit enough to live on in words alone.

That somehow we can't interpret Daoism from outside it is not something we should blindly accept. You have to provide a much better argument than that. 

I think the road and verb of Dao reminds me strongly of The Golden Mean and the Spinoza-Hegel notion of reality. Yin and Yang, of course, being dialectical vices from which virtue emerges or sublates. It appears Daoists reject this notion of cosmic unification, but perhaps they are just wrong about the consequences of their own axioms/thinking (to be clear, I do that all the time with Western philosophy and religions).

That we cannot name the Dao, but we have a name for it is hilarious. The unnameable! I'm right there with you though. It's a fine starting place.

Correlatives aren't opposites, but they do seem to be contraries.

The sage (sheng ren), or the perfected person (zhen ren), is clearly the virtuous agent. 

Sages do not engage in disputes and arguing, or try to prove their point (chs. 22, 81). I think wrestling, the dialectic, and learning itself requires hardship in this respect. Sages perhaps do not feel the need to do so anymore after they have become virtuous?

I'm sorry, but some of this sounds like ninjitsu hocus pocus.

The ambiguities in this religion have clearly been wielded to fit the will of those in power.

The idea that we shouldn't engage in human discriminations is a method of controlling people. They don't get to help themselves to these contradictions, at this level. I'll grant the fundamental epistemic/ontological problem, but not the moral/political.
