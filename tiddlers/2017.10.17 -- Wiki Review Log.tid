title: 2017.10.17 -- Wiki Review Log

* Going to look into a VIM editing mode for this wiki.
** I really want stronger macros.
* I forgot to do a daily [[Family Log]]. It was a weird day.

---

* [[Add New Row of Tabs in Tiddlywiki]]
** Never know when that will be useful.
* [[Map]]
** I think my mobile users will like this more. I use the [[Hub]] at point, so the loss of [[{Home}]] is not a big deal to me. I miss the ASCII art, and that's it.
* [[Dreams]]
** It's about time I made a Transclusion for this.
* [[Vault]]
** Ditto
* [[Focus]]
** Ditto
* [[Principles]]
** Ditto
* [[About]]
** Ditto
* [[Wiki: Directory File Structure Template]]
** I wanted something more pragmatic. I suppose I should draw out the maximum possible structure.
* [[Wiki: Tiddlywiki Howto's]]
** Finally, a home.
* [[Wiki: Tiddlers of Note]]
** Ditto.
* [[Walkthrough: Resilio Sync]]
** I need a way to explain the tools I care about.
* [[The X Time Period of Y Activity]]
** Perhaps this will be a thing.
* [[Life of Fred: Dogs (Elementary Series)]]
** Good job.
* [[2017.10.16 -- To-Do-List Log]]
** Sadly, like my wife, I'm somehow not in the mood for //The Nix//
* [[2017.10.16 -- Carpe Diem Log]]
** Edited. Added the night.
* [[2017.10.16 -- Pipefitting Log]]
** Should still be thinking about it, even if I'm not immediately working on it.
* [[2017.10.16 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** Looks good. I like it.
* [[2017.10.16 -- Link Log]]
** I was pissed off yesterday.
* [[2017.10.16 -- Prompted Introspection Log]]
** Ditto.
* [[2017.10.16 -- /b/]]
** Ditto. Lol.
