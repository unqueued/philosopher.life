She called me up. Her husband bought a System76 laptop (snazzy). We downloaded Bob le executable, threw it in Dropbox, and made an autostart in KDE. It took a bit, but we got there. I linked her to Signal to install on it as well. Hopefully, that will be useful to us. She has a wiki that runs now. I'm excited to see where she goes with it.
