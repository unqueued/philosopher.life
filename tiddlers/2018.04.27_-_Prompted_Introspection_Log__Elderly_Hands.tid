title: 2018.04.27 - Prompted Introspection Log: Elderly Hands

//A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.//

!! When you look at an elderly person's hands what do you see?

I see an elderly person's hands.

What do you want me to say, Samwise? Do you want me to talk about why those hands are the way they are, who I take this person to be, who they were, the nature of humanity, and what I think about my own life? Why should this person's hands be a valuable discussion point, especially when you've generalized to "an" elderly person's? 

Here's what I think of elderly people: they fucked us. I look at my ancestors, donors, and those who came before me as largely evil, selfish creatures who couldn't empathize with the future of humanity. They really don't give a shit. //There are exceptions//, of course, but by-and-large, the assessment is correct. They've failed multiple tit-for-tat tests, and so I don't care about their bloodstained hands now.

Have you looked at the psychology of aging? It is a crystallization of their selfishness, a loss of openness, a loss of the ability to empathize, and a very poor set of rising delusions concerning their being towards death. I've not even touched on their physiological mental decline either.

An elderly person has spent their life, and from the looks of it, they've spent it very poorly. I actively disrespect them; their identities are not valid. I'm not here to have mercy on them. That does us no good.<<ref "1">> I have mercy on those who can change in good ways: that's the point of mercy. Elderly people don't make improvements generally speaking, and there's no time for them to radically alter the lifetime programmed inertia of their habituated neural pathways anyways. Mercy is wasted on them.

I think it would literally be a good thing for humanity for the vast majority of Boomers and older to die off tomorrow.<<ref "2">> I think they deserve it too. I'll be glad to see them gone. I only support the elderly in virtue of the select few who deserve to be honored (I've yet to find them, but I'm hopeful they exist). I never know which stranger legitimately merits my hospitality, and that is why I still want blanket protection and improvements to standards of living for the elderly. I will let the guilty masses go free to protect the rare innocent gems; you have my gratitude. I honor you in this way, peerless ones.

Here's hoping I'll be one of those exceptions when I'm elderly (if I live to be elderly in the first place).
