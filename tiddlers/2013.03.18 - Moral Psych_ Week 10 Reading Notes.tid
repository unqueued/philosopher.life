title: 2013.03.18 - Moral Psych: Week 10 Reading Notes

Southern Culture is a spin-off of herding culture, where law enforcement is lacking, and you must defend yourself, hence the violence and culture of honor.

Reminds me of prison culture. Don’t be a bitch, don’t be a punk. You must defend yourself for even the slightest infractions.

Testing Southern and Northern white males at UoMichigan.



Experiment 1, bitches. Bumping into them, calling them an asshole.

Weird observer status.

Yup. Southerners were easier to piss off. Hostility on affront, but not on neutral stimuli.



Experiment 2, cortisol and testosterone test bump

Public “toughness” shock test.

Explore ambiguous stimuli, and public vs. private nature of insult.

Cortisol and testerone levels rose much more in southerners



Experiment 3, chicken game

Southerners thought they lost reputation



Functioonally autonomous ??wtf?



Doris and Plakias

What are the good philosophical reasons to think realism would be undermined by the existence of intractable disagreement?

What are the good empirical reasons to suppose that such disagreement does in fact exist?



Moral questions have correct answers, made correct by objective moral facts. Particularist will say that some moral questions are too broad and lack the context necessary to offer a correct answer*.

“That is, even in ideal conditions, among fully informed, fully rational discussants, moral disagreement may persist. Such fundamental disagreement, the worry goes, undermines the prospects for moral realism”

What are ideal conditions? What does it mean to be fully informed and rational? How do we know moral disagreement would exist in such a hypothetical world?

How does epistemic justification work at all? How is it different from natural science or other “realist” inquiries? Second, it is an occam’s razor to explain fundamental disagreement via moral antirealism.

Convergentists deny fundamental disagreement is pervasive as a hypothetical empirical conjecture, but agrees it would be a problem for moral realism if there was fundamental disagreement.

Divergentists don’t see fundamental disagreement as being a problem either way.



Ideal conditions are beyond us. We can’t attain them. Ideal isn’t only theoretically an empirical thing, but frankly, we’ll never have the ideal. What is fundamental disagreement?

Goldbach’s Conjecture –either true or false (else not a real proposition). Practically speaking, there is no one with proof of it. Even experts in mathematics might believe Goldbach’s conjecture turns out to be false. There is an ultimate, theoretical truth to the matter. None of us are in a position to “know” beyond a shadow of a doubt.



“Discourses where the prospects for convergence appear most troubled are typically the discourses where realist treatments seem least plausible; the existence of fundamental moral disagreement, if it exists, places a heavy rhetorical burden on the moral realist.” So, what? It could seem to most of us that it is unlikely, but we could be wrong. The truth is separate from the argument/rhetoric/etc.



I don’t seem to understand why there is fundamental disagreement between the northerners and southerners? Is it because I disagree on what counts as a fundemtanl disagreement or because I agree to some sort of defusing explanations?

Possible defusing explanations:

    Disagreement about relevant nonmoral facts.

    Partiality

    Irrationality

    Backgorund theory







6.1 Leiter

Quine, we can’t rely upon our intuitions or really employ conceptual analysis in many ways.

    we need to know what our concepts mean when doing empirical science and

    clarity about those concepts, and appreciation of their logical entailments, can affect the conclusions of empirical science.

Worries Doris and Plakias have the wrong practice, they are loose with concepts. Leiter disagrees on the South/North study.



6.2 – Bloomfield

Bloomfield also worries about how we specify ideal observers and conditions, etc.

He thinks Doris and Plakias are talking about normal human beings. But, that isn’t really ideal, now is it – it is fallible, right?



6.3 – Plakias and Doris respond

Misagreements, talking past one another, but not in real disagreement.
