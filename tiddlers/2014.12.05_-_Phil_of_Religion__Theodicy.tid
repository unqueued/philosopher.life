title: 2014.12.05 - Phil of Religion: Theodicy

Hume

    The existence or appearance of evil and suffering are reasons to be religious and to believe it God.

        Hume may not have been terribly careful in defining evil and suffering. He may conflate them at times. But, it isn’t too much work to add some clarifications that make his argument very clean.

            Pain comes in a lot of varieties

                Mental pain: anxiety, fear, remorse, hopelessness, depression, sadness, anger, etc.

                Physical pain

                Maybe others, although I don’t know what they be.

            Pain isn’t necessarily bad.

            There could be, for example, good evolutionary reasons to have a pain response to certain stimuli.

                Good to feel anxious to do well on your final exams, that may help motivate you, on average.

                Good to feel pain when burned by the stove. You’ll be more careful around the stove.

            There could be unnecessary pain though

                We might respond that it is the capacity to experience pain that is good.

            What is evil?

                Maybe it is the opposite of Good.

                Maybe it is the opposite of Right.

                Maybe both.

            Evil might need more explanation.

                But, maybe humans are completely responsible for this evil.

                We need atonement.

    No person could deny the existence of evil.

        Leibniz may have.

            Although, he didn’t deny the existence of pain.

            Hume may be dismissing Leibniz’s argument and failing to charitably recount the exact argument; I worry he is knocking out a strawman.

    Philo makes it sound like life is so filled with evil and suffering that it almost isn’t worth living.

    How is it possible that “after all these reflections…you can still persevere in your anthropomorphism, and assert the moral attribute of the Deity, his justice, benevolence, mercy, and rectitude, to be of the same nature with these virtues in human creatures”?

        One way out to deny that the Good and/or Right for God is the same as ours.

        God is omnipotent, so he can do whatever he wants to do.

        He is perfectly wise, and knows what ought to happen. Surely, he wants the right thing to occur.

        Why should we think God is benevolent and merciful in the way we understand these ideas (as humans)?

            I think this question had some gaps in it. We’ll see more technical arguments later.

    Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?

        If so, he doesn’t seem omnipotent.

    Is God able and willing?

        Why is there evil and suffering?

Demea:

    Our existence is just a very small part of universe. Maybe the presence of evil here is rectified in other regions of the universe or some future time period.

    Think of it like the Mona Lisa. Maybe a small cluster of pixels look bad, but overall, they are necessary for the good of the painting.

Cleanthes:

    Those are arbitrary suppositions.

    The only way out is to deny the misery and wickedness of man.

Philo:

    Such a huge claim. It seems to be the denial of human experience though.

    If you deny human experience in this matter, maybe you can deny it for all matters.

        We seem to lose everything, from the empiricist’s persective.

    Maybe we can’t buy this “balancing” of evil in the world either.

        Why is there any evil or suffering in the world at all?



Leibniz

Provides us a serious of related objections to God’s existence from the problem of evil. He lays out the arguments very carefully and concisely. He then answers them, and considers why we should deny at least one of the premises, and thus can still be justified in denying the conclusion.

    Objection I

        Whoever does not choose the best is lacking in power, or in knowledge, or in goodness.

        God did not choose the best in creating this world.

            God didn’t create the best creatable world, but he did create a world.

        Therefore, God lacks either power, knowledge, or goodness.

    Answer:

        Deny the 2nd (minor) premise.

            Valid argument, so to deny the conclusion requires denying at least one of the premises.

    Prosyllogism (argument for the second premise):

        Whoever makes things in which there is evil, which could have been made without any evil, or the making of which could have been omitted, does not choose the best.

        God created a world with evil, and He could have made a world without evil or no world at all.

        Hence, God didn’t select the best option.

        Therefore, God lacks either power, knowledge, or goodness.

    Answer:

        Agrees to the 2nd (minor) premise.

            God did create a world with evil.

            It was possible for God to create a world without evil

            It was possible to not make a world at all.

                Very explicit here, except that Leibniz doesn’t give us a really clean definition of evil (neither did Hume).

                    Which is okay, but it means there could be wiggle room for interpretation.

                It is possible that in the final analysis of metaethical evil, however, Leibniz might deny God created a world with real evil.

        Denies the 1st (major) premise.

            Could have just asked for proof of it. It seems to be asserted without any justification. But, Leibniz provides a positive argument against it.

            Best option isn’t necessarily to avoid creating a world with evil.

            Augustinian claim: It may be the case that evil is accompanied by a greater good.

                An imperfection in a part may be required for a greater perfection of the whole.

                But, then is it really evil?

                    Right, Good? If good, what kind? Intrinsic Value or something else?

            The Happy Sin.

                Ultimately, it is a good thing that Adam and Eve sinned. The result was an opportunity to benefit from forgiveness and salvation.

                    This seems to be a hint at what Leibniz means by evil.

                Note, a theist need not accept this particular Happy Sin example, but could still maintain the same overall Augustinian point.

            The Freewill defense.

                It is better to have creatures with free will who do what is morally wrong than non-free creatures who only do what is right (although it wouldn’t really be a choice…I hesitate to say their action is really right).

                    Maybe this is a hint at what Leibniz means by evil.

            This is the best of all possible worlds.

                The relationship between the right and the good seems so important to this problem. Without an explanation, it is hard to see what people mean here.



    Objection II

        If there is more evil than good in intelligent creatures, then there is more evil than good in the whole work of God.

        There is more evil than good in intelligent creatures.

        Therefore, there is more evil than good in the whole work of God.

    Answer:

        Denies both premises.

        Premise 1:

            Why should we only be talking about intelligent creatures here (where intelligence may even include something like freedom; Kant and Reason = Freedom, etc.)?

                Evil seems to be less about blameworthiness. But, this may run counter to the other hints Leibniz drops for the definition of evil.

                I worry that either Leibniz is confused or I don’t really understand his definition of evil.

            If we include non-intelligent species, maybe the balance tips in the favor of the good.

        Premise 2:

            Even if there are more evil people than good, maybe the good we find in good individuals greatly overweighs the evil and suffering we find in other individuals.

            God is infinite and the devil limited. Good is infinite, and the evil is finite.

                God is a being with infinite good, and perhaps this outweighs everything.

            Talks about happiness and unhappiness. Further good talk, but not intrinsic value exactly. What kind of happiness?

            Even if Leibniz grants this imbalance for evil in humans, there are so many other possible rational creatures, maybe aliens, which could tip the scales back in favor of the good.

                Too anthropocentric.

                    It is fascinating to see both the theist and the atheist employ this claim.



    Objection III – an odd argument from evil

        If it is always impossible not to sin, it is always unjust to punish.

            i.e. if every sin is necessary, then it is unjust to punish those

                necessity means it wasn’t possible to do otherwise. How could you hold something account for doing otherwise (not sinning) when it by definition couldn’t do otherwise?

        Now, it is always impossible not to sin; or, in other words, every sin is necessary.

        Therefore, it is always unjust to punish.

            Presumably, God punishes, and is thus unjust, and is thus not perfectly good.

        2 Prosyllogisms

            1st claims every event is necessary because every event is predetermined

            2nd claims every event is predetermined because of God’s foreknowledge

        Also keep in mind that Leibniz’s contemporary and fellow Calculus discoverer, Isaac Newton, revolutionized not just physics but perhaps even philosophical and religious debates on ontology and ethics. One unexpected and social result of Newton’s findings in physics was a shift towards thinking that perhaps the entire world really is just a deterministic machine.

            Leibniz may not be agreeing to such a thing, but it’s worth noting this is a background problem in academia and later in popular religious perspectives.

    Answer:

        Doesn’t deny the 2nd prosyllogism

            So many questions come out of that.

        Denies the 1st premise of the 1st prosyllogism.

            All that is predetermined is necessary.

                I see no reason to deny this premise. Seemed much better to deny the 1st premise of the 2nd prosyllogism

        Leibniz clarifies what he means by necessity and predetermination

            Necessity is absolute necessity, and it outright prevents free will. It is logical necessity.

            Predetermination is a weaker notion, having more to do with foreknowledge, but doesn’t interfere with free will.

            “Inclined without necessitating”



    Objection IV

        Whoever can prevent the sin of another and does not do so, but rather contributes to it although he is well informed of it, is accessory to it.

        God can prevent the sin of intelligent creatures; but he does not do so, and rather contributes to it by his concurrence and by the opportunities which he brings about, although he has a perfect knowledge of it.

        Hence, God is an accessory to sin.

    Answer:

        Deny 1st premise.

            Just because you can prevent the sin of another doesn’t mean you should.

            Maybe God would be doing something wrong in preventing a human from sinning.



    Objection V

        Whoever produces all that is real in a thing, is its cause.

        God produces all that is real in sin.

        Hence, God is the cause of sin.

    Answer:

        Like Morpheus from the matrix, Leibniz demands the answer to the question: What is “real?”

            1st definition: Real signifies that which is positive only

                Realness in the scholastic sense. The degree which which something is real just is the degree to which it is good.

            2nd definition: Real includes also privative beings

                Privative: marked by the absence, removal, or loss of some quality or attribute that is normally present.

                A privation is bad.

            If the 1st definition, then he denies the 1st premise

            If the 2nd definition, then he denies the 2nd premise

        God causes all perfections, but none of the privations of good.

        It’s clear we also need to define causation here.

            Free will defense seems reasonable here.

        The relationship between causation and responsibility isn’t so clear either.

            I think my wife and I are the causes of our children.

            I don’t think we are the causes of anything our children do. Our children are the causes.

            I don’t think we are morally responsible for everything our children will do.

            However, I think we might be partially responsible for much of what they do.

                E.g. I feel more responsible for what they do early in life, and less as they grow older. As their self-responsibility grows, our responsibility diminishes.



    Objection VI

        Whoever punishes those who have done as well as it was in their power to do, is unjust.

            This sounds a hell of a lot like Objection III, but it isn’t the same.

        God does so.

        Hence, God is unjust.

        This also brings a particular view in metaethics which is non-obvious.

            Doing what is right just is doing the best one can do with what one has.

                Hence, someone deeply conditioned to be a racist isn’t really doing anything morally wrong when they are racists.

                    Many people have a problem with this example, thinking it shows what’s wrong with the metaethical perspective

                    The racist is being racist because he thinks it is the right thing to do, he just doesn’t know any better.

                There are so many situations where we don’t know what is objectively the best thing to do, but we have do our best, and we have to make a decision, and we have to do something. We take the option that we think is best, even if we aren’t certain. That’s the best we can do.

                E.g. if you’ve lived a very primitive life, and you’ve never realized that drinking water with dead corpses floating in it is a bad idea, then it would seem like a reasonable inference to give your thirsty child some water from a pool of water with dead creatures floating it in.

                    To our eyes, that’s a horrifying deed. But, we perhaps we should accept this parent has done the best they could with what they had, with what they knew and inferred, with what was available to them.

                So much of moral life for finite and flawed creatures like us, as human beings, is like this!

                Maybe all there is to doing what is right is having a good will, nothing more.

    Answer:

        Denies the 2nd premise

        God always gives sufficient aid and grace to those who have good will.

            I worry the aid part seems obviously false, but the grace part perhaps.

        God doesn’t eternally damn unbaptized babies. Babies are doing the best they can by just breathing, shitting, and eating. (If they are moral creatures at all!)



    Objection VII

        Whoever gives only to some, and not to all, the means which produces in them effectively a good will and salutary final faith, has not sufficient goodness.

        God does this.

        Hence, God isn’t sufficiently good.

    Answer:

        Deny the 1st premise.

            So weird, why not deny the 2nd premise as well?

            He is willing to accept that God only gives some, not all, the means to produce effective good will and salutary final faith.

            Wat!?

        God could force us to do things, but he doesn’t. (I take it, “means” also includes force somehow)

            Although, “means” to good will is so wildly different from force. I worry that if it is forced, then it isn’t even a will at all (or at least not a free will).

        He doesn’t force us because it is part of greatest possible world that God doesn’t do that.



    Objection VIII

        Whoever cannot fail to choose the best, is not free.

        God cannot fail to choose the best.

        Hence, God is not free.

    Answer:

        Deny the 1st premise

        True, maximal liberty or freedom is doing the best.

            This is actually a compatibilist solution to the problem of freewill.

            Both compatibilists and others who think they aren’t compatibilist (some famous modern Kantians) agree with this.

                When someone is doing what is wrong, they don’t have complete will. They aren’t an integrated self. They aren’t performing real actions.

            Some very famous, contemporary ethicists take this view very seriously.

        Sinning is a kind of slavery.

            This seems so odd. Who the hell made that enslavement then?

            That seems to be against the freewill point.

            I fear Leibniz is trying to have his cake and eat it too here.

        Different kinds of necessity. I’m lost.

        Inlcined without necessitating.



Mackie

Structured, but within each section, it wanders a bit. As with so many of these pieces, sometimes I left wishing for more explanation. This piece was far too brief.

One might take Mackie as being out to destroy theism. We might also simply take him to be narrowing the discussion, showing what options are and aren’t available. He may simply be clarifying what the theist really needs to mean omnipotence.

No rational proof is available is again, different from no evidence or no justification. Mackie misses this. He moves to irrational ways to hold the position. Rationality isn’t about proof. Asking for proof is ridiculous.

Maybe Mackie wants to show a positive argument against theism, and not simply attack arguments for the existence of God.

Contradiction is a technical word in philosophy. Surd. Surd is the result of, P ^ ~P, but it can also just be an absurdity; the necessarily false; false is all possible worlds. Separately, P and ~P, we call them inconsistent. i.e. They can’t both be true at the same time.

Sometimes, it is obvious that absurdity arises from a set of premises. Sometimes, we have to think about the logical implications of the premises, draw them out, before we find that absurdity arises.

Mackie claims there seems to be some sort of contradiction between 3 propositions:

    God is omnipotent

    God is wholly good

    Evil exists

These are inconsistent (or the conjunction of them results in absurdity). They can’t all be true at the same time, according to Mackie. It isn’t obvious though, and he says it takes some work to show how the absurdity arises.

Perhaps formally draw up the relationships between good, evil, and omnipotence. If we agree to these rules/relationships, then we might get the contradiction.

Adequate Solutions

Problem of evil doesn’t arise for someone willing to deny one of the propositions. But, most theists wouldn’t deny them. These would be adequate solutions.

Limiting the concept of omnipotent, goodness, or evil does the trick. So, you might say that God is omnipotent, but what we should really mean by omnipotence is more limited than what Mackie has in mind.

Fallacious Solutions

Mackie warns against “almost adopting” the adequate solution, but failing to adopt it fully. Cant’ have your cake and eat it too. Can’t accept a limited concept of omnipotence only when it convenient (such as for the problem of evil), but turn around and apply an unlimited concept for other cases. This is a fallacious solution.

Considers the various fallacies found in 4 conversational, but crucial “kernels” of the responses to the problem of evil.

(1.) “Good cannot exist without evil” or “Evil is necessary as a counterpart to good.”

    Answers “why there is evil”

    Limits omnipotence

        God can’t create good without evil

            Two ways to interpret that

                There are possible worlds with good but not evil, but God can’t create them.

                    That would be a significant loss of power possibly

                There aren’t any possible worlds…

        Of course, what if there aren’t any possible worlds in which there is good but no evil

            Tasking God with creating good without evil would be asking the logically impossible at that point.

            That wouldn’t even be a limitation on the standard definition of omnipotence

            Could someone be justified in believing this?

    Considers the view that Logic isn’t co-extant with God, but rather created by God. Doesn’t think this (1) solution can be adopted alongside the “logic is created by God claim.”

        That is non-obvious

        He doesn’t seem to provide an argument right here for it.

    Denies that evil is opposed to good in our original sense

        “If good and evil are counterparts, a good thing will not ‘eliminate evil as far as it can’”

            ??

            Maybe not as far “as it can” but rather, “as far as it should”

                And, it may be a serious problem for his argument from omnipotence. It isn’t about what God can do, it maybe it about what He should do.

        Suggests good and evil aren’t strictly qualities of things

            There are folks in metaethics who deny this move though. Intrinsic value isn’t obviously correct, although we may have intuitions that lean heavily that way.

                Anyone who thinks, for example, that the right precedes the good can easily go this direction

            He consider’s the way to deny by considering good/evil as relative terms on a spectrum, where God doesn’t support the good, but “the better”

                This isn’t the only way to make this distinction though.

        Even if we grant him all this, Okay. Is this a problem though?

            It isn’t obvious to me why it is.

        Maybe evil is just the privation of good

            He has a problem with us being inconsistent in how we apply this, drawing an analogy to the naturalistic fallacy

            He doesn’t seem to sink the ship though.

        Considers the metaphysical issue of attributes.

            If there is redness, must there be non-redness.

            Is it possible for there to be just enough evil for there to be the opposite of evil.

                Minimalist evil.

                Doesn’t think Theists like this, but he opens the door for the theist here.

                    What are the costs of accepting it?

    Overall, I’m not happy with this section. It wasn’t terribly convincing to me, and it really could have been way more persuasive. I think Mackie could have done a lot more to explain the problem. There’s more firepower he could have unloaded in this section.

        I think this argument could be way stronger than Mackie has presented it.

        Maybe someone would like to redo this section. Show the explanatory power that’s lacking, but then come back and really deliver the argument(s) here the way they should have been delivered.

(2) “Evil is necessary as a means to good.”

    Not a logical, ontic, or conceptual requirement for evil to exist, but rather, an instrumental reason it exists.

        This also explains “why evil exists”

    Implies a severe restriction of God’s omnipotence

        Mackie claims it is a causal law

            As if causal laws are a huge restriction on God

                I don’t have a problem with this though

            Claims this conflicts with what theist normally means by omnipotence

                Really?

                Another way to talk about this is simply that there aren’t any possible worlds where good exists without evil as a means to it.

                    That might be construed as a causal law, but really it is just dealing in logical possibilities again.

            What does the theist really give up by ceding this to Mackie?

        Macke claims that for God to be limited by causal laws sits in conflict with causal laws being created by God.

            Why must the theist agree that all the causal laws are created by God?

                Note that there is a difference between physical causation and perhaps other kinds of causation we might find outside of the physical world. Just because you create the physical laws of causation doesn’t mean you can create non-physical laws of causation.

                    Presumably, the creation of the physical universe was a kind of metaphysical causation.

                    Perhaps certain kinds of miracles or divine intervention are also non-physical causation.

            Maybe God could create the laws, the bind himself.

                Odd binding problems though. Maybe analogous to whether or not God could kill himself or something.

(3) “The universe is better with some evil in it than it could be if there were no evil.”

    Context and interpretations

        Seems to be a variant of the 1st solution, but it isn’t. (not my gut instinct – I think the 1st and 2nd are really close actually)

            The first is about a logical counterpart, and possible worlds. Good isn’t a possibility without evil.

                This makes the 1st and 2nd closer (although logical and causal aren’t the same).

                Maybe the 2nd could be interpreted to be talking about how evil is also instrumental to maximizing the good, not just the existence of any good. Which would align with 3rd more.

            The 3rd solution makes it possible for there to be a world with no evil and some good in it

                The issue really seems to be about maximizing the good

        This follows our aesthetics analogy, where we maximize the beauty of the whole of a painting or piece of music by having certain ugly or imperfect parts.

        This also works with a progressive model of the universe, in which a universe gradually overcoming evil is better than a statically good one. That kind of triumph is in itself some kind of maximizing good.

    The argument:

        Starts by assuming evil is primarily pain.

        Pain and misery count as “first order evil”

            In contrast, pleasure and pleasure-based happiness count as “first order good”

        Second order good “emerges in a complex situation in which first order evil is a necessary component”

            Not sure if it has to be presented this way. Maybe second order good can exist without evil, it just isn’t maximized without evil.

            Second order good could be many things.

                Heightening of happiness

                Sympathy, heroism

                Gradual decrease of first order evil, and increase of first order good

                I’d like to add that there are other ways to talk about “goodness” that could fit here which Mackie doesn’t mention

            Is second order good the “real good,” a different kind of good, or just a different metric of good (which measures first order and other stuff)?

        Second order good, at the very least, is assumed to be more important that the first order good (and somehow evil).

            It outweighs the first order evil involved.

        I.e., this is the best of all possible worlds, when we balance in the equation the second order good.

            Admits real evil, but also show why it co-exists with God.

                Later claims the possibility of 2nd-order evil? What would that look like?

    This view possibly modifies, on Mackie’s view, the relationship between good and evil.

        Originally, he defined the relationship in terms of good doing what it can to eliminate evil.

        It is non-obvious to him that is what is occurring in this solution.

            Would 2nd order good be opposed to 2nd order evil?

            Ordered arguments often face a regress!

    God’s goodness is not second order good, rather it is the will to maximize second order good.

        Mackie wants to call this third order goodness.

            I think Mackie has totally lost sight of the good/right distinction. He seems to only talk about good, but sometimes mixes in decision procedures, which may belong to the right, not the good, in the discussion.

            There are many ways to build this version of the argument. I’m not sure why we have to buy exactly his.

    Objection 1

        Qualities such as benevolence and sympathy, and even God’s 3rd order goodness, are simply derivative of 1st order. Thus, they aren’t higher in any way.

        I’m not sure why he calls these a means to first order good. It seems the other way to me. The derivate part makes sense though. That second order might be the result of first order good considerations.

        This isn’t obviously damning. The account is already so bare-bones that isn’t obvious. Mackie seems aware of it though, and he passes it by.

            I’d say this objection really shows how the solution he’s provided is incomplete.

    Objection 2

        Mackie claims that God is not concerned to minimize first order evil, but only to promote second order good. That might be disturbing.

        It just isn’t clear exactly how the relationship between first-order good and evil really are or how they relate to each other, nor how 2nd order good ands possibly 2nd order evil lineup, nor how 1st and 2nd orders are truly related, nor what the same for 3rd order.

        The argument seems to be about defining good, possibly.

            Maybe this isn’t acceptable though.

        I’d say this objection really shows how the solution he’s provided is incomplete.

    Objection 3 (fatal)

        2nd order evil is clearly possible

            Opposite of benevolence, sympathy, and increasing first order good

        Presumably, according to Mackie, God would try to not only promote second order good, but also eliminate 2nd order evil.

        But, there is 2nd order evil, and God hasn’t eliminated it.

        We might simply double down and raise the ordered-thinking even more.

            Perhaps 3rd order good explains 2nd order evil.

                Doesn’t think raising orders move is plausible in the first place

            Unfortunately, such a solution might lead to 3rd ordered evil.

                But, then we might have a regress.

                But, unlike Mackie, it becomes far less obvious to me what 3rd order good is really like.

        I’m just not convinced the theist absolutely needs to have a higher ordered good to explain the existence of a lower ordered evil.

            Wasn’t this whole point just about maximizing good?

            Problematically, this objection fails to show why this isn’t the best of all possible worlds. It really doesn’t demonstrate how God hasn’t simply chosen the world with the highest overall good.

        So, I’m not convinced this is fatal. Instead, this objection may really be showing that we have an incomplete view of metaethics. Like so many of the problems we’ve faced in this class, the answers don’t rest on philosophy of religion problems, but rather more foundational problems in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics which we have to first answer before we can ultimately respond to the questions we examine in this class.

(4) “Evil is due to human free will.”

    Can be combined with other solutions, but doesn’t have to be.

        Mackie wants to combine it with the 3rd solution, and that seems pretty plausible.

        A world with free beings is better than one without, despite the evil that results.

        Freedom is a third order good on this view.

            Second order evils, such as cruelty, may be logically necessary accompaniments of freedom.

                In the same way that pain logically precedes sympathy

    Solution fails because freewill is incoherent

        This is a huge problem in metaethics. It is a reasonable stance to take. If you can provide a good argument against freewill (and I think you can), then you would be justified in thinking this way (justification doesn’t make you correct, it just means you’re being rational!)

    Mackie questions whether second order evil really must accompany freewill.

        Mackie assumes God made humans who sometimes prefer good and sometimes prefer evil.

        He then asks why God didn’t just make humans who only preferred good, despite it being done freely.

            Couple directions to go with this:

                Maybe it is similar to the robot analogy we looked at before.

                Maybe there are an infinite set of worlds where in some of them, people freely choose to only do what is right or good. Why didn’t God select those?

                    Why should we agree to such a set of worlds?

                        Well, maybe that’s part of the definition of freedom! Mackie has a real case here.

                        What does it mean to be free?

                            In some possible world, you do otherwise.

                        Maybe there are no worlds with free humans X, Y, Z wherein nobody does evil, even though it is always possible that 2 of them didn’t do evil. This maintains freewill, but doesn’t prevent evil.

                    Mackie would likely claim that we are moving the goal posts here, redefining omnipotence. I’d prefer to think of that kind of move, however, as talking what is actually possible.

                        I think Mackie has also ignored the possibility of omnipotence and goodness remaining intact, but denying the kind of omniscience we had in mind before. Problem may be solved with if concede that God just doesn’t know the outcomes of freewill (but perhaps that has other problems it brings up).

        Mackie considers the reply to this objection that “the making of some wrong choices is logically necessary for freedom”

            Mackie assumes this kind of freedom requires a kind of randomness or indeterminacy

                If it was determined, it would really be free now, would it?

            I don’t want to conflate random and indeterminate. Mackie seems to conflate them.

                Since he does, he can ask how if freedom of the will is random, how can it be a characteristic of the will?

                    Why would randomness be the most important good?

                    Why would random choices be more valuable than non-random, or perhaps even valuable at all?

                But, this all rides on the randomness claim.

                    Indeterminacy doesn’t have to be random, and indeterminacy may still have that value where randomness doesn’t

        Mackie concludes this solution requires two senses of freedom to be confused

            One sense justifies the view that freedom is a third order good, and more valuable than other goods would be without it

            Another sense, which he claims is sheer randomness, prevents us from ascribing to God a decision to make men such that they sometimes go wrong when He might have made them such that they would always freely go right.

            This might be a false dichotomy. I don’t know why we have to split these apart, particularly since I’m not convinced the second sense is really the best formulation of freedom.

    Mackie points out a more fundamental difficulty: how could an omnipotent God create men with free will?

        If they are really free, then surely not even God can control them.

        The obvious response is that God maintains that capacity to control, but simply refrains from doing so.

        Why would God refrain from controlling evil wills?

            Robot problem

                Why not let them be free, except to intervene only when they will choose to do evil?

        Mackie supposes the answer is that “a wrong free act of will is not really evil, that its freedom is a value which outweighs its wrongness.”

            So, if God intervened, then there would be a loss of goodness.

                This, however, is utterly opposed to what theists say about sin in other contexts.

            This supposes that the robot problem demonstrates that one can still be free, despite intervention

                Perhaps freewill requires a sustained, long-term non-intervention or coercion. Maybe constant intervention would simply prevent the possibility of freewill.

        Mackie thinks this fundamental difficulty demonstrates that the freewill defense REQUIRES that God cannot control the freewills, by definition.

            That is not obvious to me, but let’s continue.

        We now approach the “Paradox of Omnipotence”

            Can an all-powerful being make things which he will lack power over?

            Can an all-powerful being, essentially, limit Himself?

        It isn’t clear that we can give a nice answer in either direction for this paradox (hence, why we call it a paradox)

            The claim is that if God were to bind himself, he is no longer as powerful, and essentially, no longer omnipotent.

            If God can’t bind himself, then is he really omnipotent?

        Is this another stone-case?

            The mechanic example suggests so

        The paradox, in Mackie’s view, shows a problem on either side. The free will defense theist faces the first half of the objection, the theological determinist, however, may face this omnipotence paradox.

            Of course, we had to buy his version of the robot argument, which was far from clear to me.

        Mackie brings up a philosophy of law problem that is quite analogous, the paradox of sovereignty.

            Could a government make a law preventing it from changing a law ever again?

                If yes, then there is an area of the law over which the government isn’t sovereign

                If no, then is there a way in which the government wasn’t really sovereign in the first place?

            His solution to it seems to be about orders of jural laws – differing orders of sovereignty essentially

                First order laws govern the actions of people and institutions outside the government

                Second order laws govern the government

            Maybe a government is sovereign in the 1st order sense, but not the 2nd…

            perhaps it is possible at a given time slice for a government to have both 1st and 2nd sovereignty

            It seems impossible for a government to currently have 2nd order sovereignty and for all governments to have 1st order, since perhaps a government with 2nd order could take away 1st order.

            This is a neat example which has a lot in common. I’m not sure if the analogy holds entirely.

        Mackie thinks his understanding of the paradox of sovereignty also applies to the paradox of omnipotence.

            Maybe there are orders of omnipotence as well

            What is shows is that God can’t have all the orders for all time.

Many read Mackie as taking himself to have offered deductive arguments against theism, especially since he entirely avoids speaking about rational justification and focuses on proofs. He sets out 3 initial propositions in the beginning, and he claims they are logically inconsistent because of the arguments he provides us. Did he really show that theism is deductively invalid? Not obviously.

However, did he show some weaknesses or problems with theism. Yeah. There are issues which the theist needs to address. Mackie may not have succeeded in exactly what he took himself to have succeeded at, but he shaped the discourse on the topic.



Rowe

Three interrelated questions:

    Is there an argument for atheism? Can an atheist be rationally justified in his or her belief?

        Rowe says yes, and he gives a good argument for it.

        Note, Rowe goes after rational justification, not validity and proof.

    How can the theist best defend against the problem of evil?

        Tries to offer a rationally justified defense

    How should an atheist perceive the rationality of theism (not necessarily all theists)?

        Unfriendly, indifferently, or friendly.

        Rowe advocates friendly atheism

            Doesn’t mean you have to be chummy or friendly toward all theists. But, it is an particular kind of outlook toward the possibility of the rationality of theism, and the recognition that we really can’t be certain about a whole lot.



    Narrow and Broad terms

        Narrow theist/atheist

            Believes or denies existence of omnipotent, omniscient, eternal, supremely good creator of the world

        Broad theist/atheist

            Believes or denies existence of a divine being or divine reality

            Can be a broad theist, but narrow atheist.

        Rowe is employing the narrow sense



Section I

Intense human and animal suffering we find in the world is a clear case of evil. Argument from the problem of evil:

    There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.

    An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.

    There does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being.

Valid argument. Is it sound? Are the premises true? Maybe. Even if can’t prove they are true, can we be rationally justified in believing these premises (and thus the conclusion)?

Begin by considering the 2nd premise.

    Assume S1 is an instance of intense human or animal suffering that only God can prevent.

        My mind is already filled with acronyms. I can’t help but read acronyms as I already use or know them. OG being (omniscient, good being)…OG is an acronym already in my vocabulary though. All I can see is Rowe talking God as the Original Gangster.

    What would be a sufficient condition for God failing to prevent S1?

        Rowe wants to provide a necessary condition (a weaker component of perhaps a more complete sufficient condition).

            Necessary Condition

                P is necessary for Q

                If Q, then P.

                    Might need more than just P to make Q true. But, anytime Q is true, we know at least that P is true.

            Sufficient Condition

                P is sufficient for Q

                If P, then Q.

                    Might be other ways to make Q true. But, we know P always does.

Three possible necessary conditions (maybe we can think of more?):

    there is some greater good, G, such that G is obtainable by OG only if OG permits s1

    there is some greater good, G, such that G is obtainable by OG only if OG permits either s1 or some evil equally bad or worse

    s1 is such that it is preventable by OG only if OG permits some evil equally bad or worse

Rowe distinguishes (1) and (3) based on the claim that the privation of good is not evil.

Rowe claims that: If S1 obtains, then one of these 3 options obtains. But, Rowe also thinks this is just the same as claiming Premise 2. Is that correct? Maybe. Premise 2 may just be about necessary conditions for the God permitting evil, not sufficient conditions.

Rowe believes premise (2) states a basic moral principle which both theists and non-theists share. Is this correct? Can we deny it? Moral anti-realists maybe. Can a moral realist? Even if we can deny it, should we deny it?

According to Rowe, (2) is at least rationally justified (if not outright true). He’s not even sure if we can find a fault with it, but even if we could, it is at least justified (which is all he needed). Thus, we must now search for faults in the remaining 1st premise.

    Suppose a fawn is burned and suffering agony for days before death in a forest.

        Good example, reminds of that classic “if a tree falls in the forest” line, and who doesn’t love Bambi?

    Suppose Bambi’s pain is pointless

        Quite a supposition!

            The theist may need to argue this isn’t possible.

        By assumption, there doesn’t appear to be any greater good enabled by Bambi’s suffering or any greater or equal evil prevented by Bambi’s suffering.

    Presumably, God could have prevented Bambi’s suffering.

        Why didn’t God prevent it!?

        If the Bambi case is possible, then Premise (1) seems true.

    By assumption, it seems like Premise (1) is true.

        Rowe admits the case doesn’t prove or establish Premise (1).

            Very wise

            Perhaps we are wrong in our supposition. Maybe any case of Bambi’s suffering here is just an appearance of pointless suffering, but isn’t actually pointless. Perhaps the suffering is required.

        It is one thing to know or prove Premise (1), and another to be rationally justified in believing (1).

            This is where Rowe thinks the Bambi’s Case really takes us.

            Perhaps we can be rationally justified in thinking a case like Bambi’s is possible.

    Even if Bambi’s case actually can be justified by the theist, the next move: should we think all instances like Bambi’s are really justified?

        Mackie’s argument was meant to be a deductive enterprise with perhaps some kind of certainty sitting behind it.

            Maybe it didn’t work.

            He didn’t really show all the deductive steps he needed.

                Maybe we can charitably fill in some gaps for him though.

            Ultimately, he also didn’t show why his starting grounds were certain (even though he seemed to feel they were obvious).

                In charity, we can simply ask for justification rather than certainty.

        Recall that deduction involves truth preserving moves. Every inference is a matter of logical consequence. For a valid argument, the way to establish the truth of the conclusion is simply to establish the truth of premises.

            Rowe begins with a deductive argument here. The conclusion is the logical, deductive consequence of the two premises he sets out.

            However, the way in which Rowe argues for the premises moves away from deductive reasoning and certainty.

            Rowe wants to use what he calls an inductive argument, particularly to support Premise (1).

                For inductive arguments, logical consequence along probably isn’t enough.

                Validity isn’t a property of inductive arguments (at least it isn’t normally thought of this way).

                Even for a good inductive argument, you can begin with true premises, but it is still possible for the conclusion to be false.

        Using probabilistic reasoning or “moving from the specific to the general” is often called “inductive” reasoning.

            Some inductive inferences are really strong.

                Since the sun has always come up for each day since I’ve been alive (30 years), the sun will continue coming up for hundreds of millions of years.

                    Taking specific cases and inductively inferring a more general claim.

                    It is possible the sun will explode a million years from now, and so my prediction or my inductive inference will not be accurate.

                        But, it does seem like a justifiable inference. A reasonable one.

            Some aren’t strong.

                Just because I saw a Dog capable of performing basic addition problems on the youtubes doesn’t mean that all dogs I meet are capable of performing basic addition problems.

            Inductive reasoning is weaker than deductive. Deductive has validity. Inductive is probabilistic. It is solely based on rational justification.

        It is a huge inductive move to say that just because a single case of seemingly pointless suffering isn’t actually pointless that all instances of seemingly pointless suffering aren’t actually pointless.

            Rowe thinks it is rationally justified to deny this inductive move.

            Then denial of this move, however, just is premise (1).

            Hence, Rowe thinks premise (1) is rationally justified.

            Since Rowe believes premise (1) and premise (2) are rationally justified, then he’s rationally justified in believing the conclusion (the denial of God’s existence).



II

Rowe reiterates that the theist is likely in no position to deny the second premise. If theism is to be rationally justified, then the theist needs to be justified in denying the 1st premise.

Rowe claims the theist has two responses to show why it is reasonable to believe premise (1) is false, he calls these the direct and indirect attacks.

Direct Attack:

    An attempt to reject (1) by pointing out goods, for example, to which suffering may well be connected, goods which God could not achieve without permitting suffering.

        This seems an oddly over-charitable way to state it.

            He’s only talking about pointing out some goods basically. He isn’t evening drawing a line for how many.

        I’m surprised he didn’t go back to the induction claim with more force right here.

            The direct attack requires showing that so many instances of suffering ought to be permitted by God that we would be rationally justified in thinking that all instances of suffering ought to be permitted by God.

                This isn’t the claim that every single instance of suffering has to be explained, but probably a ton of them.

                How many? I don’t know. That may depend on the context.

            Perhaps we can see him as eventually going this route though.

    Immediately doubtful in Rowe’s eyes

        Several of the direct points just aren’t complete enough to justify the rejection of premise (1)

            E.g. Suffering leads to moral character and spiritual development

                Suffering seems to extend far beyond this though. There seems to be suffering that isn’t instrumental to this end. How can that degree of suffering be justified then?

            E.g. Suffering results from free will

                Perhaps much suffering is the result of free choices. But, there seem to be instances of suffering which have nothing to do with free choice.

                    The Bambi case seems to be one of them.

                    What about earthquakes and other natural disasters?

                Original Sin might respond to this though.

                    The very structure of the world is such that sin actually impacts how the natural world operates.

                    Maybe on this view we would live in a utopic garden of Eden with no unnecessary suffering, except for the mistakes humans have made.

    General difficulty is two-fold

        It cannot succeed; for the theist does not know what greater goods might be served, or evils prevented, by each instance of intense human or animal suffering

            Too many things to justify.

        The theist’s own religious tradition usually maintains that in this life it is not given to us to know God’s purpose in allowing particular instances of suffering. Hence, the direct attack against premise (1) cannot succeed and violates basic beliefs associated with theism.

            Some theists might not agree that we can know God’s reasons so directly and completely.

Indirect Procedure (G.E. Moore Shift):

Fascinating argumentation style against external world skepticism. Rowe states it this way:

    I do know that this pencil exists.

    If the skeptic’s principles are correct, then I cannot know of the existence of this pencil.

    Therefore, the skeptic’s principles (at least one) must be incorrect.

This isn’t really the best way to put the argument (even if it is the way Moore put the argument):

    This pencil exists.

    If [the conjunction of the skeptic’s principles], then ~[this pencil exists]

    Therefore, ~[the conjunction of the skeptics principles]

It is best to interpret Moore as actually claiming he is more confident in the pencil’s existence than the skeptic’s principles. The decision procedure here is to select between mutually exclusive propositions based upon which proposition he has more confidence. Knowledge of the pencil’s existence will only later be the result of this confidence defeating skepticism.

    Don’t we need to know “why” one should be more confident or certain in one proposition rather than another?

        Maybe not.

General shift. I’m not convinced Rowe doesn’t do a great job explaining this section. It doesn’t follow Moore’s kind of reasoning, and he could have done a better job of re-interpreting his own initial argument to fit it. That’s what I’ll do for you.

P: The Pencil Exists

“One philosophers modus ponens is another philosophers modus tollens, and vice versa.”

This argument against the skepticism of the existence of the external world can nicely be translated to an argument against the skepticism of God’s existence.

    Instead of talking about a pencil, we can talk about God.

    Instead of talking about the external world skeptic’s principles and claims, we can talk about the atheist’s principles and claims.

P: God exists

Q: Atheist’s Principles and Claims

This is in fact a form of the argument which Rowe provides at the very beginning.

Premise 1 just is (Q)

Q: It is not the case that there exist instances of intense suffering which God could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.

Premise 2 isn’t the skeptic’s principles (Rowe even claims the theist agrees to it). Here is where Rowe didn’t really cleanly write the 2nd premise as a conditional.

Premise 2 is really: If Q, then ~P

If “It is not the case that there exist instances of intense suffering which God could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse,” then ~P (not the case that God exists).

Thus, the theist can just argue the other direction. Instead of a modus ponens argument, the theist can flip it to a modus tollens.

    The theist, then, from the Moorean Shift, feels more confident in God’s existence than Q (Rowe’s first premise – that pointless evil exists).

        And the theist uses the confidence based selection principle to decide which to adopt.

    Nice part of this argument is that while it was originally intended to talk about certainty and extremely high epistemic standards (and criticisms of Moore’s argument usually head in this direction), the theist is much better positioned to employ it, since the theist only needs mere justification (and not outright certainty).

    Why should we be more confident in God’s existence than the existence of pointless evil?

        That is the difficult question.

        Rowe says almost nothing here. He doesn’t push the point.

        Note that Rowe can been charitable in trying to show how his opponents can respond. He is not dismissive.

III

Friendly atheism – claims the belief in God can be rationally justified (not necessarily that everyone who believes in God is justified)

Indifferent, and unfriendly

Unfriendly atheism has a problem: how do you show that nobody is justified? This is what Mackie was trying to accomplish. In a way, it is very hard to prove or give a great argument for a negative.

You might be able to show that modern, scientifically and philosophically literate people might not be justified. That is tricky in itself though. But, it seems much harder to show why someone who doesn’t this training or these resources wouldn’t be rationally justified in believing in God.

Rational justification is attuned to contexts. It isn’t a question of truth, it is question of the merits or warrant of a beliefs. At some point, our arguments are no longer about truth, but only on justification. This is the way fundamental philosophy goes sometimes. It is part of the great post-modern problem, the flaw with the Cartesian pursuit of certainty and truth. This, of course, is hardly a position of truth relativism or skepticism, but it is the reconition of our unfortunately limited epistemic positions.



Plantinga

We saw the initial modern discussion launched by Hume and Leibniz. We’ve considered two influential contemporary atheist pieces on the problem of evil. We’ve gone a bit out of order here, chronologically, as I wanted to show Rowe’s more fully developed atheistic argument from the problem of evil before considering defenses. Now we’ll consider a more contemporary defense of theism concerning the problem of evil than Leibniz’s.

Jumping into the middle of a larger argument here. We start in section 2.

Plantinga takes Mackie to task on the claim of a deductive argument against theism. He calls Mackie’s supposed inconsistent propositions, set A.

(1) God is omnipotent

(2) God is wholly good

(3) Evil exists.

Plantinga points out that no formal contradiction can be deduced from just the propositions in set A. He’s correct, and yes, Mackie wasn’t careful enough in what he claimed to have shown. Although, it seems pretty obvious that Mackie really meant to say that these propositions alongside many other common, everyday propositions we might already agree to will result in the inconsistency. Plantinga could have been more forthcoming on this point.

Plantinga gives us the George, Paul, and Nick example.

(8) George is older than Paul

(9) Paul is older than Nick

(10) George is not older than Nick.

He calls this set C, and claims that no laws of logic allow us to deduce the inconsistency of these propositions. I guess that depends on what we mean by laws of logic. He’s right that FOL doesn’t allow this, because the deductions required to show the inconsistency require us to understand the meaning of the predicate “older.” But, it seems obvious that general logical laws must allow for this, even if predicate logic alone doesn’t. Plantinga wants to call these “broadly logical” notions. Perhaps Mackie’s argument should be understood in this broadly logical sense.

Plantinga distinguishes different kinds of modality. There’s a difference between logical possibility and natural possibility. E.g. Logically possible for Henry Kissinger to swim the Atlantic, but it isn’t physically possible. This may highlight various complications to getting exactly what Mackie really means when he claims a deductive inconsistency.

We consider:

(11) If George is older than Paul, and Paul is older than Nick, then George is older than Nick.

This proposition is necessarily true, given what we mean by older. When we add it to set C, we can formally deduce absurdity. Plantinga says set C has a particular kind of structure, wherein adding a particular kind of necessary truth to the set will allow us to show why the original set is inconsistent. Plantinga calls this structure “implicitly contradictory.”

Plantinga wants to take Mackie as claiming that set A is implicitly contradictory.

As Mackie explained, the contradiction only arises when we add some additional premises.

(19) A good thing always eliminates evil as far as it can

(20) There are no limits to what an omnipotent being can do.

Plantinga claims that if Mackie is arguing that set A is implicitly contradictory because of these additional premises, then these additional premises must be necessarily true, and not simply true. Plantinga is correct that if Mackie thinks this problem of evil is simply a matter of logical truths, then Mackie needs to show why these additional premises are necessarily true. Again, nothing stops an atheist from lowering the status of the argument and claiming that it isn’t simply a matter of logical truths, and then the atheist needn’t show why (19) and (20) are necessary true, but only true. That would be enough, perhaps.

Is (20) necessarily true? Plantinga claims that God’s omnipotence means that there are no non-logical limits to what God can do. Given that qualified definition (which Mackie would agree to), Plantinga seems willing to accept that (20) is a logical truth.

Is (19) necessarily true? It depends on what we mean by “can” perhaps.

Plantinga gives us the example of an endangered friend, Paul. Presume we are good things. We’re physically capable of helping Paul, but if we don’t know Paul needs our help, as in we don’t know that we can eliminate some sort of evil, then we won’t help Paul or eliminate an evil. But, we are still good things. Hence, it isn’t obvious that (19) is necessarily true.

Thus, maybe ignorance can demonstrate how (19) isn’t necessarily true. But, if (19) isn’t necessarily true, then Mackie doesn’t seem to have provided us an implicitly contradictory set of propositions.

Maybe we were never really in a position to help Paul though. So, maybe we “couldn’t” eliminate evil, and so something like (19) may still be necessarily true. Plantinga offers us a revision:

(19a) Every good thing always eliminates every evil that it knows about and can eliminate.

This provides some gateway to incorporating God’s omniscience into the argument.

Note that set A, (20), and (19a) still don’t enable us to deduce a formal contradiction. As Plantinga points out, the contradiction can only be deduced if we add that God knows about every evil state of affairs. This, of course, is something which most theists will readily admit.

But, Plantinga doesn’t think (19a) is necessary. Plantinga gives us the example of two friends marooned on separate islands, and a dilemma in which we can only help one, but not the other. It is possible to eliminate each of the evils separately, but we can’t eliminate them both.

Similarly, the scraping your knee is an evil which can be eliminated by a doctor via amputation, but the evil it would bring about might be greater than your skinned knee.

Alternatively, maybe there is a linked greater good which simply outweighs the evil which instrumentally enables that greater good.

Thus, given the possibilities, (19a) isn’t obviously, necessarily true. It may not even be true at all. So, Plantinga considers another revision:

(19b) A good being eliminates every evil E that it knows about and that it can eliminate with- out either bringing about a greater evil or eliminating a good state of affairs that out-weighs E.

This still doesn’t seem to solve all the problems we saw in 19a though. In particular, when you’re in a dilemma with mutually exclusive options to eliminate separate evils. Thus, even (19b) doesn’t seem necessarily true, and hence it isn’t obvious that Mackie can really show that set A is implicitly inconsistent.

Plantinga considers yet another revision:

(19c) An omnipotent and omniscient good being eliminates every evil that it can properly eliminate.

Even if we concede 19c, it doesn’t buy Mackie’s inconsistency. We can’t deduce there is no evil and there is evil. What 19c entails is:

(3’’) There is no evil that God can properly eliminate.

This seems to be the kind of move the theist may want to make here. Note, however, that Plantinga’s primary objective is simply to show there is no implicit inconsistency in set A, and (19c) is unable to provide the contradiction Mackie would need.

Thus, we consider an additional premise to make 19c do the kind of work Mackie needs it to do.

(21) If God is omniscient and omnipotent, then he can properly eliminate every evil state of affairs.

Again, for set A to be implicitly inconsistent, (21) would need to be necessarily true, not merely true. Is it necessarily true? Maybe not.

Plantinga claims there are of certain kinds of goods only possible because of evils, and he thinks these are counterexamples to this the necessity of (21). Is that right?

A lot of this argument seems to ride on Plantinga’s interpretation of “can,” where “can” here seems to imply a kind of “moral” permissibility. The reason God can’t eliminate the evil is because it would be wrong, not because it isn’t somehow possible. This may not be unacceptable though, since we did state that God is virtuous agent in the premises as well, and so perhaps when we flesh that out, Plantinga ends up being right in his use of “can” here to demonstrate why (21) isn’t necessarily true.

Thus, it isn’t obvious if Mackie’s set A is implicitly inconsistent. The argument doesn’t seem to be there for it. Rowe knew that, and that’s why he went with the weaker (but more plausible) argument from induction, probability, and justification.



Section 3 – Can we show no inconsistency in Set A?

This paper is difficult to appreciate if you haven’t had logic - this section in particular.

Wisely, Plantinga doesn’t want us to rush into claiming that set A is therefore automatically, implicitly consistent simply because no candidate “necessary” premise has been found to complete the implicit consistency. That principle for rushing into that claim has poor consequences (and actually leads to a contradiction). Hence, Plantinga seems to argue, at this point, that we just don’t know if set A is implicitly consistent or not. At best, we can only say that it hasn’t yet been demonstrated that set A is implicitly inconsistent.

Plantinga considers how to move the discussion along. One way is to show that set A is implicitly consistent or even broadly logically possible (which means it can’t be implicitly inconsistent). That would shut the door on Mackie, but not necessarily Rowe. This approach amounts to a procedure he calls “Giving a model of S,” namely:

“to show that a set S is consistent you think of a possible state of affairs (it needn’t actually obtain) which is such that if it were actual, then all of the members of S would be true.”

In a weird way, this procedure is like providing a counterexample. But, instead of showing how some conclusion isn’t the logical consequence of some premises, as a counterexample is designed to do, this model giving procedure shows that propositions are logically consistent by demonstrating a model in which all the propositions are true.

Let’s define logical consistency.

P Q

To say that P and Q are logically consistent is just to say that there is at least one possible world in which P and Q are both true (it doesn’t have to be all possible worlds). If P and Q can’t both be true in any possible world, then we say they are logically inconsistent.

Further, we need a notion of logical truths (or necessity). To claim a proposition is a logical truth or necessarily true is simply to claim that it is true in all possible worlds. There is no possible world in which it is false.

Further, we also need just a basic understanding of the notion of logical entailment. Consider this conditional:

n1 -> n2

We know that for any propositions n1 and n2, if in all possible worlds n1 -> n2 is true, then this conditional is actually a logical truth. Thus we say:

n1 => n2 (logically entails)

So, logical entailment is just the same thing as claiming that a conditional is a logical or necessary truth.

To quickly illustrate the difference between the conditional and logical entailment, consider this:

n1: this marker is in my hand

n2: I am standing in this classroom

We can construct the conditional:

n1 -> n2

If this marker is in my hand, then I am standing in this classroom.

Is this conditional true in all possible worlds or situations? No! I can sit down while holding this marker in my hand, and now the consequent of the conditional is false, which makes the conditional false. The conditional here, doesn’t have to be true. In some possible world or situation, it is false. I can specify a world in which it is false (for this proposition, I can physically demonstrate it). Let’s contrast the conditional with entailment. Let’s change n2:

n2: I have a hand

Consider the conditional:

If this marker is in my hand, then I have a hand

Is there any possible world in which when I have a marker in my hand, I don’t have a hand? No. In possible worlds where n1 is true, namely, when I have a marker in my hand, then n2 is also true, namely, I have a hand. So, this particular conditional is special because it isn’t just true in this world, or in some possible world, but rather all possible worlds. This conditional is a necessary truth, a logical truth.

Hence, we will say that the proposition n1, “This marker is in my hand,” logically entails proposition n2, “I have a hand.”

Moving on, with these concepts of consistency, necessity, and entailment, we can understand Plantinga’s “giving a model of S” procedure.

Suppose set S contains P and Q, and you want to show P and Q are consistent.

One might just give propose a possible world in which both P and Q are true. If we agreed that was a possible world, then we’ve agreed that P and Q are consistent. However, maybe we can’t agree to possible world where they are both true and be done with it. How can we show that P and Q are consistent?

Another way to show their consistency is to not only specify some possible world (a world which we can all agree is possible), but to also specify a kind of axiom or necessary truth which we would all agree to.

So, another way of showing the consistency of P and Q, without outright claiming both are true in some possible world, is to show it the consistency indirectly by giving a model. Here’s the indirect method which Plantinga has in mind:

To show that P is consistent with Q, find a proposition, R, such that both:

    P and R are true in some possible world

    R => Q (in all possible worlds, R -> Q)

Note that if there is such an R, then R is consistent with P. Since, there is a world where both are true.

Further suppose this proposition can be found, and hence some possible world can be specified where P and R are true, and R => Q. In that world, we know R is true. And, by supposition, R is such that in every possible world where it is true, Q is also true. Thus, in that world, Q is also true. Hence, even without specifying that Q is true, we can deduce that P and Q are both true in that possible world. Thus, P and Q are logically consistent, since that world would be proof that there is some possible world where they are both true.

So, if you can find such a proposition, R, you’ll have accomplished your original goal of showing the consistency of P and Q. This is what Plantinga is considering here for the set A. Can he give a model of set A?

Plantinga agrees that it just isn’t acceptable simply specify a world where the propositions of set A are true, since an atheist like Mackie just won’t accept it. But, maybe Mackie could be convinced by a model of set A. So, the goal would be to get Mackie to agree to a possible world and some necessary truth which logically entails the members of set A without having to outright assume the members of set A.

Plantinga combines some of set A, so (1) is now the basic attributions of God:

(1) God is omniscient, omnipotent, and wholly good.

So, now we have two propositions (1) and (3). These are the P and Q for the model giving procedure. The goal then is to find some proposition, R, which even Mackie could agree both entails Q and is true in some world with P. If that can be done, then even Mackie should be convinced that P and Q are logically consistent (even if it wasn’t obvious from the beginning).

So, assume a possible world where (1) God is omniscient, omnipotent, and wholly good.

What are candidates for R? Plantinga considers:

(22) God creates a world containing evil and has a good reason for doing so.

This obviously entails Q, that evil exists (in the possible world we’ve assumed). At least formally, R appears logically consistent with P. But, maybe they aren’t.

Plantinga says there are two attempts we might provide for showing that P and R, namely (1) and (22) are consistent. The first way is to just outright try to conceive of a possible world where P and R are true. If you can succeed in this, then they are consistent. This doesn’t seem to be any better than our initial problem with set A though. The other attempt is to specify what might be God’s good reason for permitting evil.

Of course, the worry is that maybe even P and R here are implicitly inconsistent. Well, how do we break out of implicit inconsistencies? By providing yet another model. So, we could give another model which shows how P and R (rather than P and Q) are consistent. So, maybe there is an R2 such that it entails R and is consistent with P. If that model can be provided, then we’d have proof that our original P and R are consistent, which would then prove that P and Q are consistent. Of course, you might have the same problem with R2, and then we might regress into R3, and so forth.

If you can show there can be a good reason that God has for evil, essentially another proposition, R2, which in conjunction with P entails R, then you could show that R is consistent with P.

St. Augustine tries to do. Greater good can be achieved by permitting evil. That could be a good reason, and Augustine thinks it is the good reason. Plantinga calls Augustine’s attempt a Theodicy.

Plantinga makes a technical distinction between theodicy and defense here.

    Theodicy is about telling us why God permits evil (as if you know the answer).

        Theodicist tries to show (1) and (22) are consistent, and thus set A is consistent.

        Augustine believes this reason alongside (1) entails (22), which entails (3).

        Further, Augustine actually thinks this reason is true. It’s a big claim.

    In contrast, Defense is about providing a possible reason God might have for permitting evil

        a sufficient reason, even if it isn’t what God necessarily relies upon

            maybe there are multiple sufficient reasons

        So, like the theodicist, a defender is also trying to find some proposition R2, a reason, which alongside (1) entails (22), and thus entails (3)

            Or, we might say that the defender is finding a different R which doesn’t need an R2. Either will work. Plantinga is not clear enough on this point.

        The difference, however, is that the defender, unlike the Theodicist, need not actually claim that R2 is true.

            He only needs to establish the possibility of R2 with P, namely the consistency of R2 and P.

            In establishing the consistency of R2 and P, the defender will have shown R and P are consistent, which shows that Q and P are consistent. This is all a defender is trying to show though.

                So, in plain words, the defender is only trying to show that Mackie’s set A is not logically inconsistent, but the defender is not going on further to claim why they must be consistent, or what actually obtains, or what God’s actual reason must be.

    A defense, in this case, would defeat Mackie’s argument, but it wouldn’t obviously defeat Rowe’s. A theodicy is more satisfying, and would provide a stronger justification for believing in God.



Section 4 – The freewill defense

Plantinga offers us a defense, not a theodicy. He’s giving us an R2, and he interrogates it.

Definition of free action:

“If a person is free with respect to a given action, then he is free to perform that action and free to refrain from performing it; no antecedent conditions and/or causal laws determine that he will perform the action, or that he won’t”

    Doesn’t mean or entail unpredictability

Definition of morally significant action:

“an action is morally significant, for a given person, if it would be wrong for him to perform the action but right to refrain or vice versa.”

Thus, a person is significantly free, on a given occasion, if he is then free with respect to a morally significant action.

Distinguishes between moral evil and natural evil:

    Moral evil is the result of free action (does he mean significant free action?)

    Natural evil is any other kind

Preliminary Defense

    All else being equal, a world with significantly free beings is more valuable than a world with none.

    God can create free beings, but can’t cause or determine them

        they wouldn’t be free if God did – that’ just part of Plantinga’s definition of freedom

    God can’t create free beings that can’t do evil, since that isn’t freedom by definition.

    God did create significantly free beings, namely humans.

    Sadly, at least some humans have freely caused moral evil.

    This moral evil, however, does not count against God’s omnipotence or benevolence (why nothing about omniscience here?)

        God could only have prevented moral evil by not creating free beings, but in doing so, would also prevent moral good.

    Plantinga thinks we can pull R2 and P out of this story to show the possibility of R

        R: “God has a good reason for creating a world containing evil.”

    R2 = “God could not have created a universe containing moral good (or as much moral good as this world contains) without creating one that also contained moral evil.”

        Plantinga is only claiming R2 is possible – that’s all a defense needs.

        If R2 and P are possible, then R is possible.

        If R and P are possible, then so are P and Q.

        This defends set A against the claim of inconsistency, but it doesn’t make the more reaching claim that God exists or that this is the reason God does or would use to justify the existence of moral evil.

Objections:

    Definition of freedom is a bad one. If Compatibilism is true, and then it seems like God could have made free beings who only did what is morally right.

        Plantinga doesn’t find compatibilism plausible.

        At the very least, the libertarian might be justified, and thus argument of the possibility of R2 might be justified.



    Formidable objection:

        “Surely it is possible to do only what is right, even if one is free to do wrong.”

        Plantinga agrees is possible in the broadly logical sense. In some logically possible world, there are free creatures who always do what is right.

            There is no logical contradiction or inconsistency which arises from that objection.

        But, if God is omnipotent, then God has no non-logical limitations

            Surely, then, God could create one of these possible worlds where free beings, even on the libertarian view, only do what is morally right

            But, if that’s true, then the freewill defense is mistaken is claiming the possibility of R2

                R2: God could not have created a universe containing moral good (or as much moral good as this world contains) without creating one that also contained moral evil

        Mackie saw this coming and provided this objection for us.

    Built into this formidable objection is the subtle Leibnizian claim that:

        If God created this world, then this must be the best of all possible worlds.

        Mackie agrees with Leibniz. Mackie simply denies this is the best of all possible worlds, which means Mackie denies God created this world.

    The Free Will Defender disagrees with both Leibniz and Mackie.

        Why should we think there is a best of all possible worlds?

        More importantly, the free will defense does not claim that God could have actualized just any possible world.

            There are more than non-logical limits to God’s omnipotence in this case.

            Perhaps freewill imposes limits on God’s omnipotence.



Section 5 – Does God’s Power really include the ability to create just any possible world?

Plantinga gives us relationships between proposition, states of affairs, and possible worlds.

    States of affairs are facts that obtain in some possible world.

    Propositions correspond to states of affairs

        We might think of states of affairs as truth-makers. When a state of affairs obtains, it makes corresponding propositions either true or false.

    A possible world is a maximal state of affairs.

        An atomic state of affairs, like 2+2=4, is only an element of a maximal state of affairs.

        State of Affairs A is a complete if and only if for every state of affairs B, either A includes B or A precludes B.

            A includes B if A’s obtaining entails B’s obtaining in a world

                The proposition corresponding to A entails the proposition corresponding to B

            A precludes B if it isn’t possible for both to obtain in a world

                The proposition corresponding to A entails the negation of the proposition corresponding to B

        So, a possible world is this maximal state of affairs which is really a web of atomic and complex states of affairs with a corresponding web of propositions which entail each of the other propositions or the negation of them.

        Lastly, let’s say that the complement of a state of affairs is the state of affairs that obtains just in case A does not obtain.

            So, a possible world A is a maximal state of affairs just in case for every state of affairs B, A includes B or A includes the complement of B.

    He also says for each possible world, W, there corresponds a book on W. This worldbook contains all propositions true in world W.

        Like possible worlds, which are complete states of affairs, worldbooks are complete.

        Every proposition is either true or false in a worldbook.

        Thus, a worldbook is a maximally consistent set of propositions.

        Every world has a unique worldbook.

    There is exactly one actualized possible world. By definition there has to be a set of true propositions which is maximally consistent, which is really just the worldbook of the actual possible world.

        Presumably, we exist in an actualized possible world. In fact:

    People exist in possible worlds.

        To say Paul exists in the actual world and another possible world isn’t to say Paul is co-existing in two worlds. It just means that if that other possible world had obtained, then Paul would have existed in it.

        Paul doesn’t have to exist in all possible worlds.

        Paul might exist in some non-actual possible world, but not the actual world.

    Modalogical terms

        P is possible if it is true in at least one possible world (whether actual or non-actual)

        P is necessary if it is true in all possible worlds (actual and non-actual)

        P entails Q if there are no possible worlds where P is true and Q false.

        P is consistent with Q is there is at least one possible world where P and Q are true.

    Could God have created just any possible world?

        According to Plantinga, strictly speaking, God doesn’t “create” any states of affairs

        There was a time when the earth did not exist, but not a time when the state of affairs consisting in earth’s existence didn’t exist.

        States of affairs transcend time in this sense. There is no creation of it.

        Instead of creating a possible world, Plantinga thinks God “actualizes” states of affairs.

        Essentially, God didn’t create a possible world, he simply actualized one.

            Admittedly, I think this isn’t a sufficient explanation.

            I still don’t know what it means to actualize worlds or why we should think any being, even God, can do it.

    Is God’s existence necessary or contingent?

        Does God exist in every possible world?

        If God is a contingent being, then there is at least one possible world without God.

            In that world, God couldn’t have actualized anything.

            If God is contingent, then there are many possible worlds that God couldn’t actualize.

                At the very least, God couldn’t actualize a world in which God doesn’t exist.

            This goes against the standard, traditional view.

                Claiming the contingency of God might initially seem to respond to the atheist’s charge, since God’s omnipotence really is limited automatically in being contingent.

            However, the atheist can simply revise the objection to say that:

                If God is omnipotent, then God could have actualized any of these possible worlds in which God exists, and would have actualized only those possible worlds in which God exists and free creatures exist who do no wrong.

                So, we are still left asking: could God have actualized worlds containing moral good but no moral evil?

        Note that Plantinga had talked about two states of affairs: one in which God’s existence obtains and another where God’s existence doesn’t obtain.

            He goes on to talk about the possible necessity of God, and I just want to make it clear that Plantinga isn’t contradicting himself.

            Claiming that there is a state of affairs is not the claim that there is a possible world in which it obtains.

            Recall that a possible world is a maximal state of affairs, not simply an atomic state of affairs. While there may be a state of affairs where God doesn’t exist, for example, that doesn’t entail that there is any maximal state of affairs where God doesn’t exist.

    Paul selling the odd Aardvark example.

        Consider a world in which Paul rejects your $500 for his aardvark. You ask yourself, “What would he have done if I’d offered him $700?”

            What exactly are you asking?

                Consider a state of affairs S’ (S’ isn’t a complete, and so we won’t call it a possible world) where you offered $700 instead of $500

                    Would Paul accept the offer under the conditions in S’?

                    As far as we know, in S’, Paul has neither accepted nor rejected the offer. Hence, as far as we know, S’ is incomplete, and therefore not yet a possible world.

            According to Plantinga, one of the following propositions has to be true:

                (23) If the state of affairs S’ had obtained, Paul would have accepted the offer

                (24) If the state of affairs S’ had obtained, Paul would not have accepted the offer.

        To say Paul this choice is a free action in a world where S’ obtains is just to say that S’ does not itself entail that Paul accepts or rejects the offer.

            Thus, there are possible worlds in which S’ obtains and Paul accepts your offer.

                (25) and (26) are true in those worlds

            And, there are possible worlds in which S’ obtains and Paul rejects your offer.

                (25) and (27) are true in those worlds

        Either (23) or (24) is in fact true; and either way there are possible worlds God could not have actualized.

            Plantinga then uses a standard disjunction elimination inference in logic to show us his conclusion.

            I want to point out that an opponent could certainly disagree with this disjunction, and simply claim it’s a false dichotomy. Indeed, I’m not sure why we have to buy it.

                Temporal propositions might not have truth values, for example.

                Further, something weird is occurring here, where I agree one of these conditional has to be true in a possible world, but I don’t see why a particular one has to be true uniformly true in ALL possible worlds.

        Suppose the first disjunct, (23), is true, and S’ had obtained

            Plantinga claims it was beyond the power of God to actualize certain worlds where (23) is true.

                In this case, it was beyond God’s power to actualize a world in which:

                    Paul is free to sell or refrain from selling the aardvark (S’)

                    Paul refrains from selling the aardvark.

                It was beyond God’s power to create a world where (25) and (27) are both true.

                    Call this world W, where S’ obtains, namely Paul is free, and Paul refrains from selling.

                    W is a possible world which even an omnipotent being couldn’t actualize.

            As supposed, (23) is true (If S’ obtains, then Paul accepts), and since Paul is free with respect to the action in W, then Paul would have accepted the offer.

                For Paul to be free, W couldn’t be actual, since W includes Paul’s refraining.

                If, however, God had causes Paul to refrain, then Paul wasn’t free. And, if Paul wasn’t free with respect to this action, then W couldn’t be actual because S’ includes Paul’s freedom.

            God can’t actualize world W because God would either fail to actualize Paul’s freewill or fail to actualize Paul’s not selling the aardvark.

                If Paul were to sell the aardvark, then W didn’t obtain.

                If Paul weren’t free, then W didn’t obtain.

            Thus, in either case, when (23) is true, there is possible world, W, which an omnipotent being could not actualize.

        Similarly, suppose 2nd disjunct, (24), is true, and S’ had obtained.

            God can’t actualize world W because God would either fail to actualize Paul’s freewill or fail to actualize Paul’s selling the aardvark.

            Thus, in either case, when (24) is true, there is possible world which an omnipotent being could not actualize.

        Thus, whether (23) or (24) is true, there is a possible world which an omnipotent being could not actualize.

            Again, we had to buy this dichotomy in the first place.

                Something meta is going on here.

        The actualizability of a world depends on whether Paul would freely choose some particular thing.

            Ultimately, there are a number of possible worlds where it is partly up to Paul whether God can actualize them.

            Is the claim here that Paul actualizes something?

                This is one view of free will, that we are little, limited unmoved movers. That we have embedded in us some image to choose, to do something radical, and perhaps to actualize states of affairs.

            At the very least, Plantinga is claiming that the concept and implementing of freewill imposes limits on God’s omnipotence.

                This makes sense. Giving human beings real freedom means giving up power over them with respect to those free actions.

                    What kind of “giving up” of power is this? It could be voluntary, but even so, freedom as a concept imposes limitations on the possible worlds.

    Importantly, the free will defender insists “on the possibility that it is not within God’s power to create a world containing moral good without creating one containing moral evil.”

        Note, the defender only needs to show the possibility. In doing so, the defender diffuses the Leibnizian Lapse.

        The defender, therefore, can agree there are many possible worlds containing moral good, but no moral evil.

            However, that doesn’t mean God could have actualized just any possible world. Only some worlds can be actualized.

                We need not buy Leibniz’s lapse.

    If a world isn’t actualizable, why should we think it is possible?

        I worry there is something tricky or odd about this notion of actualizable which might be the downfall of Plantinga’s argument.

        There are a lot of views on modality, and Plantinga brings to the table a very specific one. We need not buy his metaphysics.

            That said, even if we have reason to believe he is wrong, Plantinga may still be rationally justified.

            The root of the philosophy of religion problems often sit at the foundational problems in different branches of philosophy.



Section 6 – Could God have actualized a world containing moral good but no moral evil?

Even if Leibniz’s lapse is shown to be false, we’ve not yet shown that falsity of the possibility of Mackie’s objection to the deductive inconsistency of set A. Namely, we’ve not shown the possibility of:

(30) God is omnipotent, and it was not within His power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil.

If the defender shows this is possible, then he has shown that set A is not inconsistent. To show (30), the defender must demonstrate that the entire set of worlds with moral good but no evil are among the set of possible worlds which God couldn’t create.

    Curley Smith’s morally significant free action example demonstrates a malady which free beings can suffer from: Transworld depravity.

        I have to leave this as an exercise for you to walk through.

“Every world God can actualize is such that if Curley is significantly free in it, he takes at least one wrong action.”

It may be the case that in any possible world in which God can create, free beings always do at least one wrong thing, even though they are free.

“So the price for creating a world in which they produce moral good is creating one in which they also produce moral evil.”

Note how this talks about the structure of the worlds available to God to actualize. There is a possible structure of possible worlds wherein (30) is true. That is all the defender needs.

We need not agree that transworld depravity is true, but only that it is at least a possible. If it possible, and it seems like it is, then Plantinga has diffused Mackie’s objection.

This shows that it is possible that R2 and R are consistent with P, which means it is possible that P and Q are consistent. Namely, it is possible that God exists and evil exists in a world. Thus, Mackie’s deductive argument doesn’t follow, and hence why Rowe’s argument goes the direction of admitting the possibility of God’s co-existence with evil, but doesn’t think we can justify it.

Assuming this entire argument works, the remaining question for theists then is whether one can be rationally justified in believing the problem of evil doesn’t show God doesn’t exist. It seems like it.





Papers:

    As I said before, I’m grading the final paper more harshly than the midterm.

    Look in your syllabus and follow the formatting requirements. I will lose points for not following it this time.

        Don’t forget to cite appropriately.

        You probably don’t have space for quoting or block quotes. I suggest you cite without quoting with condensed paraphrasing and summation.

    I’m looking for a very tight, well-written paper. Your goal is to make 10 pages fit in 5-6.

    Choose one article from the Existence of God section of the class.

        Find one significant flaw in the argument, carefully explain that part of the argument and how it fits the larger argument presented in the paper.

        Spend 1-2 pages on exegesis of the argument in the article.

            Make them look good. Be charitable. Show what kind of work is being done by this subargument.

        Spend 2-3 pages addressing the flaw.

        Spend just a little bit of time thinking about how your opponent would respond to your argument. Show me the weaknesses in your own argument.

    Feel free to e-mail me about these papers.

    Submit the digital copy to me by e-mail by 5:00 on December 15th.

        I don’t take late work without an official excuse. I suggest sending it by 4:00 instead.





Close:

    At the beginning of this semester, I told you I didn’t know the answers to almost any of the problems we faced in this class.

        I hope you see why.

            I hope you see how traditional philosophy of religion problems rest upon other significant problems in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics.

                If we can’t answer those problems, then we aren’t in a good position to answer these problems.

    I hope you’ve gained an appreciation, in particular, for:

        The history of thought in philosophy of religion. These ideas are thousands of years old. We are still participating in this historic discussion.

        A particular method for doing philosophy.

            We were crazy careful, systematic, and charitable in our interpretation for this particular class.

            If you took an ethics, political philosophy, or logic course with me, I would have more decisive things to say. I think this subject matter forces us to be charitable and extremely careful.

            Different philosophers will teach various classes in different ways.

                I’ve had dozens of philosophy teachers. They all have different approaches. I try to learn not just the content they have to offer, but also the method.

                We were extraordinarily careful in how we approached these readings. This may have felt dry and boring to some, but I hope you see why it is or can be worth approaching certain topics in this way.

        I hope you see how the theist and the atheist may both be rationally justified in their beliefs.

            I hope you have gained some measure of respect for the possibility that we are fallible, that we can be wrong, and for the views of others.

    You guys did a great job this semester.

        Many of you are clearly very good at this. I hope you continue doing philosophy.

        I really enjoyed your comments, questions, criticisms, and thoughts.

        I think it was a successful class.
