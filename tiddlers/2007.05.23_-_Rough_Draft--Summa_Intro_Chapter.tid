title: 2007.05.23 - Rough Draft--Summa Intro Chapter

While a great deal of the work has already been done, and a lot of my job is really sifting through arguments and explaining the systematic workings and synergies of proper arguments into a larger framework, I have found that the introduction has been quite difficult and must be written completely from scratch. I have no sources to turn to, and nobody to ask. Consequently, putting the base argument on paper has been very difficult. I already suck at writing, so to make me think about a very complex subject, organize it, and THEN compose it with zero examples, sources, or help is not that easy (although, I recognize I have already had and will have future help--it is still difficult).

Of course, this is a very, very rough draft. It is a good start I hope. Even if it won't look anything like what I've written (perhaps [[k0sh3k]] may write the actual thing), I will have a direction to point us towards. I do need a translator. Anyways, I'm at a point in the introduction that I need to sit back and get some 3rd party opinions. There is much work to be done, and I have to make sure that what I do have completed or worked out in the introduction is accurate and clear. So, even though it isn't nearly finished, I ask you to bare with me please. Fix and forgive my errors, redundancy, any contradictions. Please help me find the missings gaps.

 

 

Summa Theologica

 

 

Section 1: Value

To some this chapter will be obvious and elementary. The assumptions and conclusions we make here, at least at first, do not seem groundbreaking. You may even find yourself thinking that I work too hard to assert the obvious. I argue in this fashion because it is necessary that we setup an epistemological base for a grander study. We are, as they say, starting from scratch. Where is ground zero? The foundation of all things and the reason you exist, move, and pursue anything is because of value. Value is our epistemological base on which we build everything. Value is an assumed variableâ€”we cannot justify our existence or the pursuit of anything without begging the question of the reality of value. In what seems like an unlikely argument, as it really is so basic, I hope to guide you through the fact that all things we do and believe rely upon an assumed reality of innate and absolute value.

What is value?

Value is the property or aggregate properties of a thing by which it is rendered useful or desirable, or the degree of such property or sum of properties; worth; excellence; utility; importance.

Honestly, we see this word thrown around in so many contexts. Economics, politics, religion, commercials, and social relations all provide slightly different definitions of this word. In the end, they all point toward the above definition. And, ironically, all of the places you hear this word used really are going toward the same exact thing, they simply may not recognize it.

Value is an absolutistâ€™s term at heart. It implies that a particular thing has some innate metaphysical property which requires that we should pursue it. To say something is valuable is to say it is innately valuable, and that regardless of perspective, that which is valuable contains universal and absolute value independent of our existence (whether we perceive it or not). To ask whether something is of value is to ask: Is it worth pursuing, and how much is it worth (pursuing)?

Why should you believe in value? Some may think that value is a faÃ§ade, just an idea with no meaning or true application in the end. Perhaps value is a social or biological construct. Perhaps something can only have value when we apply that attribute to it. You will find that dismissing value as a concept is not as easy as it may initially appear.

Look at the meaning of value once again. What is the significant principle to the definition? Value is the concept that something is worth pursuing. It is, by definition, an implied ought. It is the case that, if something has value, you would rather it existed than not--you cannot be indifferent to its existence. To say something has value is to say that it is in fact significant and important...that it is desirable, that it is above neutral or nothingness. Something with value is something that innately is worthy of pursuit! Value entails the existence of an ought by its definition (in modern terms, value implies morality). What appears to be a very generic term is actually quite explicit and completely universal.

This, of course, is a very substantial (perhaps even valuable) claim to make of anything. Value is an assumption at its very core. It is an assumed beliefâ€”a true leap of faith. You cannot initially prove it. You donâ€™t even need to fully understand it to use it. But, most importantly, the very consideration, application and use of value requires you to beg the question of valueâ€™s existence.

Example:

A child sees a ball a few feet away. The child desires the ball, and goes to retrieve that ball to play with it. This desire for the ball must stem from some belief that the ball is worthy of pursuit. The child assumes the ball has value. Now, whether or not the ball had value isnâ€™t the point of this illustration. The principle to consider is that the child couldnâ€™t logically consider the ball, or even desire it, or go retrieve it, or play with it, unless he felt that ball had value.

This sort of principle is quite universal of all things. If something is worth pursuing in any sense, then it is valuable to some degree.

Ironically, to even read this sentence, to even consider this sentence worthy of thinking about, to actually spend your time doing anything, is to assume that there is intrinsic value in whatever you pursue. We beg the question of value directly whenever we pursue anything. To even argue with me, or even have the will to agree or disagree with me means you have already assumed that it was worth pursuing, as though you ought to read or contemplate this sentence. You have already assumed value was innate to your object or idea of pursuit.

If there is no value in this world, then stop reading. Nothing has meaning. You have no warrant to do anything. You are merely particles floating around, doing whatever particles do and what not. But, who cares? You can't care, you can't think, you can't do anything, you can't pursue anything because it has no absolute, innate value.

When we pursue, we pursue that which we believe is innately valuable. Not one thing can exist apart from this idea of value. To merely concern ourselves with the idea of anything is to assume, from pondering its very meaning and logic, that it has some degree of value (in virtue of the truth of its existence, albeit possibly a weak value). This begging the question of value and meaning has been around for a very long time. From the defeat of Heraclitus to the abundant criticisms of post-modern relativism in Abrahamic religions, we can see the necessity of begging the question in regards to basic logical and value-based claims. And, it still holds true today. It is an inescapable truth, a necessary one for us to continue to hold true even with no deducible evidence in order to move on in conversation and the pursue anything of consequence.

So, we will start with our first begged premise. From there, we will be able to elaborate on other begged premises and deduce other conclusions.

[1] Object(s)* and idea(s) of value exist. Object(s) and idea(s) worthy of pursuit exist. We ought to pursue those valuable object(s) and idea(s). (Begged)

*(The possibility of the plurality of value, such that more than one object can have value will be discussed)

It is here, at the core of value that our search begins. The pursuit of something is the pursuit and acknowledgement of the truth of something. Truth exists to be known and acknowledged; truth is the worthy idea and reality. Truth is logical and valuable. To not seek truth is to seek nothing. By definition, we seek truth because we ought to seek it. Even the activity of pursuing truth is valuable in itself. Either we are called to be philosophers or we are nothing.

Section 2: Mechanics and Underpinnings of Value

To say something is valuable is to say it is worthy of pursuit. You do not just beg the question of whether value exists, but you also, in virtue of mere recognition and pursuit, beg the question on other fundamental issues (whether you consciously believe this to be true or not). At the very least, youâ€™ll need to assume the basic claims of logic.
After all, if A is not A, then you have no way in which you could reasonably continue any conversation or thought, as no thing is itself. You assume that A is A, or the pursuit or belief in it (even if subconscious) is important, that is has value. You in fact, believe A must have value just to acknowledge its very existence. Value and logic are the root of all meaning. Logic, beyond 'A is A', which is truly simultaneously assumed with any idea of value (to think A at all it to assume the value of A and 'A is A'), is the manipulation of value and the deduction of further value from assumed values. You my friend, you believe in value, and consequently logic, at the basest level, and you continue to assign value to other things from your logical deductions in your value-based logical pursuit.

Value and logic go hand in hand. Once you can admit that the value and logic must exist, that things exist in a coherent and absolute fashion, that value is truly innate rather than imposed upon an object or idea, that truth is absolute and independent of us rather than subjective and relative to your perceptions or existence, you can shut the doors on a plethora of ridiculous concepts that have plagued the â€˜intellectualâ€™ (how ironic) community for a long time, namely relativism and its kin.

However, we need to evaluate the structure, architecture, begged, and deducible mechanisms of this value-logic system. There are further implications that stretch far beyond this base which we must address here before we can move on. Without considering the epistemological base in detail, we have no authority to make deducible claims regarding any number of subjects.

Section 2A: Metaphysical Innateness of Value

It is already established that we beg the question of value and logic. Furthermore, it is illogical to consider true relativism at all, as it denies the very essence of value. There is no reason to consider or refer to anything with anyone if you cannot (at least metaphysically and logically) consider or refer to the same thing together. Value, logic and meaning are innate to an object or idea.

How do you know this is true?

It is true that we pursue things because we believe they are valuable, not necessarily because whatever we pursue is in fact actually valuable. Now, be careful, I am not making the relativistâ€™s claim. Of course we could be wrong about what is and isnâ€™t valuable, but that does not negate the logic of value actually existing. Our very belief and pursuit in anything requires us to think in terms of innate value.

Innate value means that an object or idea is independently worth pursuing. There could be nobody to pursue it in the universe, and yet it would still be valuable. Innate value is static and unchanging. It has nothing to do with our perceptions! The perception of an object or ideaâ€™s value is not the same as the actual innate value of an object or idea. This is important to distinguish because it requires us to answer further questions, and, more importantly, it is required that things have innate value, rather than applied value, because applied value means nothing.

What do I mean by applied value? It is a basic form of the relativistsâ€™ stance that there is no true, absolute, and innate value (or logic or truth), and that we merely impose such notions on the things we perceive. This relativistic thinking has huge implications, and is clearly, poorly applied even by relativists (although, you shall see we all have committed this sin at one time or another).

If one argued that only applied value is all that exists, and that we only perceive things to have value, then we fall back into the trap of relativism. We cease to beg the question of whether value exists because we have reasonable doubt of valueâ€™s actual existence. If you actually doubt valueâ€™s actual existence, then you canâ€™t reasonably justify any pursuit. To really apply the relativistâ€™s stance correctly is to doubt everything to a degree that is absurd, including their beginning premises!

I think of this paradox (which is actually a strict contradiction) in the ironic rules:

No Rule is true 100% of the time or This sentence is false

This captures the contradicting engine behind the relativistâ€™s thinking. It is the failure and the irony upon which we all irrationally choose sin. Surely people do not apply relativism correctly (to the nth degree). There would be no point to anything. Do you not see the mistake of this sort of thinking? If you really think that truth isnâ€™t absolute or innate, then you canâ€™t think. The very act of thinking begs the question of the reality of value in an absolutistâ€™s sense.

Essentially, at some level, you are going to justify your pursuit not in terms of mere perception, but of the belief that something is in fact valuable independent of your (or anyone elseâ€™s) perceptions.

Again, the perception of an object or ideaâ€™s value does not require that the object or idea is truly valuable. We could be wrong about whether an object or idea is actually valuable. And, we could easily be wrong about how valuable an object or idea really isâ€¦Nevertheless, if we assume value to exist, we must assume it exists in a deeper manner than we perceive it to have value. We must assume that objects and ideas have true, innate, intrinsic, and absolute value, regardless of perceptions otherwise.

What does it mean that something is universally and innately valuable?

It means that whenever we pursue or desire anything, we are assuming that someone in our position should conclude the same thing. It is the belief that the standard of a thingâ€™s value is static and independent of us, and that we all must regard the reality of its value in an identical fashion.

For example:

The desire for a purple car is the statement that the purple car is valuable universally and innately (not just to you). The universality of value requires that your desire implies that all people should value that purple car in the same way you do. Now, your perception of the value of a purple car could be wrong (I donâ€™t doubt your perception is in fact wrong), but it is obvious that the value of the purple car is stable, static, and innate. It is valuable in virtue of its value not in virtue of perceptions. To say something is valuable is to imply that it must be valuable to everyone in the same way.

And, while this is almost contained in the first premise, I seek to distinguish this highly relevant truth about the nature of value, and thus I will make it our second begged premise:

[2] Value is innate and universal. (begged)

Now, assuming value exists (and we are going to assume the claim from now on), we will assume there are in fact things which are actually worth pursuing. How do we know what things are actually valuable and what things are actually not valuable? Are there choices to be made between valuable objects? Are there varying types or degrees of value, and are there varying types or degrees of pursuit? And, if there are different types and degrees of value, how would we go about comparing, just as an example, financial and moral value? To move forward we will first discuss how one goes about designating attention to the proper pursuit in the face of equivalence.

Section 2B: Choosing Value

We really havenâ€™t given any thought to what it means to choose value at all, or even what premises we hold to be true in assuming that one can choose value. This is ironic because value is meaningless outside the context of the possibility of something choosing it. Read carefully. I do not imply that value is meaningless if there is no one to choose it, I said value is meaningless outside the context of the possibility of choice. If there is no true choice possible, then value is meaningless. So, even if there were no people in the universe to choose what is valuable, we can at least say that value can still exist as long as it remains logically and metaphysically possible for choice to exist. Technically speaking, in some possible world a being with free will chooses something of value. This is just an expression that means choice must be possible in the most minimal sense (even if nobody physically had it) in order to value to remain valuable.

Look once more at the definition of value. Value is that which ought to be pursued. There are two very functional words in that definition. The first being ought (which is a very moralistic word), and the second being pursue. Both ought and pursue implies, in fact they beg, the notion of beings with free choice.

Pursue means to seek, to follow, to quest after, to act on, to go after, etc. Pursuing is a choice! Pursuit can only be accomplished by a being which can pursue. This word isnâ€™t used lightly.  It is the act of a sentient, aware, and rational being. Pursuing requires choice. You canâ€™t pursue something without choosing to do it.

The rock does not pursue the ground as it falls through the air. Photons do not pursue their destinations. Billiard balls do not pursue other billiard balls. You need to mean what you mean when you say the word pursue. You must mean something more profound than a deterministic object doing what it must do by this word pursue. You assume free will by the very notion of pursuit.

Ought has no meaning outside of pursuit. Ought implies an ought-not. It would be meaningless if all things ought to be pursued. Ought would lose meaning. Ought has more weight to it than most attribute. It is implies Ought and Ought-nots, and it implies that it is possible for being to choose between the two.

We have come to our next begged premise, one that you readily accept to be true in virtue believing that you ought to pursue anything at all:

[3]You have free will (begged).

Of course, this isnâ€™t some compatibilist notion, this is true free willâ€”the ability to do otherwise.

You canâ€™t say that you deterministically pursued in ignorance and that free will does not exist. Even if it were the case, such a revelation would disable you from future action or choice. To those who argue against free will, and are now educated about what they consider to be a fully deterministic reality, one in which they donâ€™t have actual choice, then please, show me how you are pursuing. You canâ€™t possibly think anything is truly valuable. Why pursue at all?

Value doesnâ€™t require there are free beings, just the possibility of free beings. But, you believe in more than just the possibility of free beings, you believe in the reality of at least one free being, if not many. And, in this case, since you think there is value, and you must if you believe you are pursuing in some relevant sense, then you also believe in free will. You believe you had an honest choice to do A, B, C, etc.

You beg this question. It is certainly useful to consider how it exists, but it is not a deniable premise. There is no mystery about these begged premises, they are true not in virtue of the begging, but because they must be true for us to continue on in life. To not believe in free will and value means you are nothing.
Section 2C: Value Equivalence Problem (the true Dilemma).

Almost putting myself in the Cartesian predicament, by which I am forced to think from a rational base starting place (although, one with sensation), I realize that we have other problems to consider. In this problem, we have to consider how we choose what is valuable.

It is easier to demonstrate the problem in an example first and work from there. Bear with me please. Our example:

If Object 1 and Object 2 have innately equivalent value, and we could only choose to pursue one or the other, how would we choose which one to pursue? While one could randomly decide between Object 1 or 2, the method of random choice has placed additional, yet artificial, value on whichever particular object is chosen--other choice-mechanisms would impose a similar artificial value on one object or the other. As one object was artificially worthier, they were not truly equivalent in our perception. In reality, there is no way to choose between two equally valuable options. It is illogical.

This problem can applied to everything in our initial evaluation of all valuable objects. If we live in a world of equivalence, where everything is just plain valuable and equally so, we could not pursue any one thing could we? As we cannot pursue everything we perceive to have equal value at one time, we must understand the begged mechanism for choosing that which is valuable.

The value of all objects and ideas cannot be truly equal because we cannot logically choose one option or another if both are truly equal. In addition, there can be no simultaneous pursuit of two objects or ideas which cannot be simultaneously pursued.

Now, surely, some would think in their minds while reading this: if both pursuits are equal in value, then what does it matter which you choose? Here, we enter a realm of weak psychological egoism and determinism. It is an age-old idea, one that holds some merit. Now, I say this is a weak version of egoism because it is. Stringent egoism would imply that a person pursues what they consider to benefit themselves the most because the person in question perceives themselves to be the most valuable thing to pursue. Our evaluation does not need this premise, and in fact, can easily go against this notion of such a high degree of self-worth. However, the very base sense of egoism and psychological determinism remains true. We will beg at least three questions in order to solve the value equivalence problem:

[4] A person will pursue what they believe to be the most valuable object or idea. (begged)

Obviously, [4] is a huge concept. It implies free will, it implies rationality, it implies personhood, and so on and so forth. It is not so easy to do away with the above concept, it remains resilient, and to most it is already an undeniable truth at heart. And, for now, as I have much to cover, I will ask you to wait for further discussion of this issue. I promise we will re-examine these ideas with depth.

Assuming [4], we want to consider how a person would choose between two objects of equal maximal value. The key word in [4] is most. Most requires a single object or idea to have more value than all the rest. So, from begging [4] we will arrive at our next premise:

[5] One object or idea will have the most value (begged)

So, if there are two or more objects of value in the world, one must have more value than the others. Since value is not just perceived, rather it is innate, we must also claim, if we wish to have rational pursuit at all, that some object or idea has the most value.

The equivalence problem is solved by begging the question that, at least for whatever we are choosing, which we assume to have the highest value, there is no equivalence at the very peak of the value spectrum. That which is most valuable is truly most valuable, we believe this to be true at any point we pursue anything. Now, it is obvious (as I have stated over and over again) that what we believe to be most valuable may in fact not be the most valuable object or ideaâ€”but, this does not contradict the explicit logical requirement, one that we already believe at our very core, that there is a single most valuable object or idea.

Section 2D: Prime and Secondary Value Problem

If some one thing must be the most valuable thing in the universe, then what does this say about all other objects and ideas? It only implies, at face value (*cough, just making sure you are awake), that all other things must have less value. The question then becomes, do other things cease to have value in virtue of not being as worthy of pursuit as the most valuable object or idea?

We can consider that a ball might have value. But, surely a ball is not the most valuable thing in the universe. As we seek that which is most valuable, we will pass over the ball, regarding it as not to be as valued as the most valuable thing. Is the ball still worth pursuit in any possible way? Remember, this is not an issue of perceptions (perceptions lead us to the original begged question, but not to actual values beyond the begged propositions directly); this is an issue of actual value possibility. Can the ball, as a secondary object, something which is not the most valuable object or idea in the universe, be valuable? To even acknowledge the existence of the ball is to recognize some semblance of innate value in the ball. To ask whether the ball can have value is to ask whether it can be considered, used, acknowledged, and so on and so forth. The consequences of denying the possibility of secondary objects of value, opting for a sole prime valuable, could prove disastrous.

There are really two options.

1.) There is only one thing of value, and we wrongly perceive other things to have value.
2.) There is one object of greatest value, and all other objects and ideas are of lesser value, but are still actually valuable to some extent.

Luckily, weâ€™ve already required of ourselves the pursuit of several ideas. Deductions upon deductions, each of these have value, most in virtue of the previous, some begged in themselves. You canâ€™t even form singular idolatry of Logic (going back to the root deductions and begged questions), assuming that logic itself is the highest value. Why? Because the steps required to consider logic, which are composed of several things, are not singular, they are plural (there are several premises you will value). You will eventually (just as a begged question) consider and pursue more than one single idea, even in these small deductions. We beg the question of the plurality of valuable objects. Thus,

[6] More than one object or idea has value (begged).

This brings up other important questions. Firstly, what is the most important object/idea in the universe, and how would we know? (Hello, Anselmâ€™s ontological proof!â€”existence is a perfect making property) And,

Section 2E: Degrees of Value

How does one make sense of a world with multiple objects/ideas of value? One will have the most value, and the others will have at least some value. This leads us to our next conclusion.

[7] The value of objects and ideas must be ranked by degrees.

At the very least, we can see that there are two degrees. Prime and secondary. We have no begged reasons as of yet to think that secondary cannot be separated into a much larger set of degrees of value. On the contrary, we have very good reason to suspect a spectrum of degrees of value larger than a binary system.

Which is better--A world with 1 kiss or a world with 2 kisses? If a kiss is actually valuable, and unless a kiss had infinite value, then 2 kisses would seem worthier of pursuit than 1 kiss. Most would agree to this. Things can be ranked in value. 1 dollar is worth more than 2 dollars (by definition?), one action is better than another, and so on and so forth.

It would seem that by definition, since 2 is greater than 1, that there must be the existence of quantity and quality of the objects and ideas in the universe. We can easily create a spectrum, a huge array, a LIST of all the objects and ideas in the universe in which we could prioritize them from the most valuable object/idea (Prime) all the way to the least valuable object/idea in the universe.

Metaphysical values of objects and ideas can be differentâ€”essentially there are degrees of value. Some utilitarian thought has outlined excellent ideas concerning principles of mapping out objects of value. For now, it is good enough that we can justify the existence of multiple objects of value. It is also noteworthy that secondary valuables could possibly have equivalent value without interrupting our choice-mechanism. The single prime value is our true and sole pursuit, all other things are secondary. There is no specific reason at this point not to allow for the metaphysical possibility of equivalent value in the secondary valuables.

The last significant conclusion to draw is this: The degree to which something ought to be pursued rests simply upon the degree of value of the object in question. This seems self-explanatory, but we simply must emphasize the mathematical beauty of a value system. Each exact degree of value is equal to that exact degree of value. This would imply utility from a deontological logic/value base. We assume basic principles and rules (deductions), from which pours out further rulesets, primarily a teleological notion or mode of thought.

Section 2F: Types of Value

Weâ€™ll take a step back and look at the bigger picture for a moment. When most people think of value, they canâ€™t really put their finger on what it is, but they certainly appreciate it. What is ironic about our perception of the world as post-moderns is that we separate the world into categories of value. This is financial value and that is moral value and so on and so forthâ€¦

What we really need to ask is whether there can be different types of value at all. The short answer is no. If something is worth pursuing, then it is worth pursuing, period. Universality of value means that each degree of value of is equivalent in every possible way. For now, Iâ€™ll count utils to mean a degree of value. These utils of value are equivalent and universal, and all things with value must be compared to such a system. (*youâ€™ll notice that it is here that modern Economists have inadvertently crossed into the value system).

I bring this up because it has an immediate effect on how we perceive the world. It is true, every man has his price. Essentially, this is ironic and maybe even startling. For example, just as a thought experiment: It means that X-utils of money is worth something else with X-utils of value. Now, whether economics and trading exist at all has to be established (and is not within range of our deductions at this point). It is quite conceivable that economic systems which trade capital and money are merely a faÃ§ade, a true Darwinian evolution, something that is entirely man-made. Ownership may very well be an illusion. But, if money and economics are real, and actually valuable, then we can buy things of finite value with it. This, you will see, is an odd thing to say.

I think the one of the more revolutionary aspects of this value system is how we come to understand the universality of value. We can no longer attempt to separate or distinguish types of values. We are required to think of value in the mode of the moralist. Having universally valuable objects, one of which is the most valuable as we have begged, there is that which we should pursue by definition and that which we should not pursue by definition; there is that which we ought to pursue and that which we ought not pursue, there are universal statements of absolute right and wrong based specifically on the innate and independent value of objects and ideas in this world. The value system is one of absolute morality.

There is value, or there is nothing; There is logic, or there is nothing; There is morality, or there is nothing. All choices are moral ones. They are meaningful in virtue of our freedom to choose amongst the many objects and ideas, and meaningful in virtue of the specific and innate values of each object and idea.

The universality of value is highly relevant, and in my opinion, greatly misunderstood by most people. It is only natural that we compartmentalize our lives, creating separate types of valuesâ€”but, this process of separation isnâ€™t necessarily correct. Essentially, there are problematic distinctions made concerning different values and value systemsâ€”these distinctions are facades. One cannot simply designate this as ethics or morality (words that people have far too many definitions for), and this as finances, and this as political law, and this as religion. There is only one value: Is it worth pursuing, and how much is it worth pursuing? This is the only question we should ever ask.

The funny part is when I hear you canâ€™t compare this to that, and frankly, with a universal value perspective, you MUST be able to compare everything. Sure, it takes a great deal of work calculating each objects utility, and we may be too stupid to be able to do it perfectly, but it is at least metaphysically possibleâ€”and that is a necessary distinction to make.

Learning to rethink value at its core will be difficult for many. They are blinded by their artificially imposed (and nearly useless) distinctions. Consider, for example, the separation of church and state (which is still technically possible even in a universal value system, but not for the reasons that most people choose to accept this separation). The reasons for this are not genuinely good ones. It is, of course, a philosophical choice to do this, but it is by no means good philosophy (and thus, it is really a form of relativism). Law and morality and ethics all seek to regulate what one ought to doâ€¦or, to be more specific, what is worth pursuing. They all are attempting to do the same thing. The reason we really donâ€™t need these distinctions is because there arenâ€™t necessary distinctions to make. Sure, maybe religion and politics have different methodologies in producing what they consider to be the right correct answers and implementations of value, and of course, this distinction of methodologies is useful insofar as we can point out which system is which, the fact remains that we cannot forget the end goals of all of these institutions. We are so caught up in the maelstrom of details that we forget the overarching picture.

This idea of value permeates everywhere. It is inescapable, even in what you may consider the most minor things. When you evaluate two different investments, and you say one is worth more than another, you are making several claimsâ€”all of which have everything to do with a value-centric world. You are claiming something like, money is valuable and that money is tangible representation of value, finite and quantifiable. You are reaching out to an economic system and assuming that it in fact valuable to even consider investments and valuable to consider economics. You are thinking that what makes one investment more valuable than another is the difference in the financial returns. You are assuming that ownership of property even exists (metaphysically, this is very difficult to prove), and so on and so forth.

Donâ€™t you see the implications of really thinking in terms of straight universal value?

So, again as an example, if money is really valuable (and trade/property exists, which is the only way money could have value), then you should technically be able to buy any finitely valued thing with it. This is huge. It means you could technically buy the entire planet. Or, what about this: Humans are imperfect, thus they are lacking some value; Thus, humans do not have infinite value; Thus, a human can be bought with money. Ah, I do see problems with assuming that money has any true value.

But, the universality of value, and thinking of each degree of value or util as being equivalent as some mathematical measurement of value, is even further reaching than what we have imagined. It means that the ought to do in a moral sense must be equated with all other things of value.

Morality is universal. All questions are moral questions. When asking, should I get the purple or the red car, you are in fact asking which has more value. Value is value. This is a moral question by todayâ€™s standards of the word morality. There is a definite right or wrong. A yes or no, a this is more valuable than that. This is what you ought to pursue in this situation.

People want there to be a neutral. People donâ€™t want to have to think so hard about everything they do. People donâ€™t want to be held accountable for what they might consider insignificant things. But, remember that our perceptions of what is and isnâ€™t value, and to what extent a thing is valuable, are often wrong. So, if red or purple is truly significant in any sense, and choosing reveals it must be significant, then we must say that it is a question of value (significance), and therefore is a moral question. Of course, people haze the issues, they want there to be a relativistic underbelly to the problem. It is so much easier to say, what is right for you is right for you, and what is right for me is right for me. We donâ€™t have to think or actually pursue truth. But, from the very beginning we have shown relativism at its core to be deeply problematic. It cannot stand. You MUST choose between this or that. Choices are moral choices.

This is wonderful. Responsibility may seem like a burden in some aspects, but in reality, it is a gift of trust and value. We are given much, let us do well with what we are given.
Section 2G: The Rationality of Morality

Morality is a rational pursuit. It means that, as we will see in the end, Theism and Christianity require a better foundation than mere faith. At some level, you will be using deductive reasoning to pursue what you ought to pursue. Some are just better at it than others.

Irrational belief is meaningless belief. If a madman says they love you because they are mad, do you really think their statement has the same relevance as when a rational person says I love you? Think about how we praise God. He made us rational beings for a reason.

In the universal value perspective, by definition, you must compare things based upon their value. You make all decisions, deductions, thoughts, and choices from a value-perspective (even if it is a warped one). You must be warranted in your belief. You are climbing a ladder of deductions, and you cannot get to the top without climbing the bottom rungs.
Section 3: Right and Wrong

It is clear that value is universal and absolute. There are no types of value, only degrees of it. All values are, as we would say as moderns, moral values. All things are moralâ€”there are things you ought to do and thing you ought not do. Value and logic show this to be definitionally true. You beg the question of morality as the fundamental component of choice. Essentially, the world is divided into right and wrong.

Given our choice-making system, i.e. pursuing that which we believe to be the highest value, we realize that only one option can be available in any given situation. What is the most valuable thing to pursue is the right thing to pursue. Right is dictated by the single most valuable object or idea in the universe. Pursue that one thing, and you will be doing what is right.

Simple enough? Now, all you have to do is deduce what is in fact the most valuable object or idea in the world, and pursue it. You will find that reason will guide you to God (it is splendid that the gift of the Imago Dei should lead us to such a fitting conclusion, no?). For now, we will wait to cover arguments for theism. Just be mindful that value and reason already push us in such a direction.
Section 3A: Relativism

What does it mean for something to be wrong? And, how do we arrive at the wrong conclusion and end up choosing to pursue something which is in fact not the most valuable object or idea? The answer to the question of why sin exists is relativism and irrationality (Synonyms).

What is relativism?

Relativism is the denial of absolute truth. It is the denial of reason and universality. This philosophy (the irony of such a contradiction, the greatest of them all), is really a means to justify immorality and lazy thoughtâ€”relativism is the way of the pragmatist and of the evil. There are ideals or there is nothingâ€”the right thing requires diligence, planning, hardwork, and pure reason. Relativism is irrationality.

At any point we are not pursuing truth we are in a state of relativism. It is the state in which you do not care to pursue what you actually ought to pursue. You decide for yourself that what is actually valuable is not valuable. You are in a state of sin. It is blasphemy in the end. As none of us are perfect, we are all, at some time or another, in some way, committing the act of relativism. Your goal, as a philosopher, is to eliminate any remnants of this backwards thinking, and to pursue truth entirely.

Relativism is hidden in a shroud of individuality. These are just barriers to the truth. Truth is independent. To even claim relativism is to claim some sort of an absolute. What about not all truths are absolute or something along those lines? Can you pick and choose what is absolutely true and valuable and what isnâ€™t? Will you allow yourself to arbitrarily justify such things?

Relativism may have come from scientists who claimed the world is unpredictable. The initial ambiguity of such a statement is quite problematic, and probably a starting justification for relativism by those who didnâ€™t fully comprehend what science meant. The scientist of course didnâ€™t mean random or metaphysically or logically impossible to predict, and in the case of scientists, not even physically impossible. Unpredictable just means that something is technologically impossible for us to predict an event. This is our own fault, it is our ignorance that disallows us from possibly predicting something. But, people take unpredictable to mean something much larger, such that it is physically, metaphysically, or even logically impossible for something to be predicted (which would not be our own fault). And, this is the first relativist slip. They changed their perception of a predictable and absolutists view of the word, one in which we are ignorant, to the view that the world is what we make of it, and that we are omniscient in our own sight.
