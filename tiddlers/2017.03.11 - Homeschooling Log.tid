j3d1h did a fantastic job this week. She really tried hard, and it showed. She may not have accomplished what she hoped to accomplish with her effort, but my judgment is concerned with whether or not she did or her best. The effort is what I want. While she is still getting her journal/recording/reflection down pat (was fine this week), I really appreciate that she takes herself and her work seriously.
