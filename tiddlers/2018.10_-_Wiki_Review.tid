!! Audit:

* As always, this is the river of commentary and mini-digestion. I think I value this more than anyone else. It turns out that understanding any given tiddler is improved, on average, by looking into my commentary a day later as well.
* It's clear that I've been pumping the tiddlers out. I've this giant ball rolling, and now I have more and more work to do in the [[review]]. I spend more time thinking about it now.
* If [[TDL]] is {[[Dreams]]}, and [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] is {[[Focus]]}, then it seems like [[Wiki Review]] is {[[Vault]]}. It's very short term. It my hope that eventually this will expand considerably in time frame, or perhaps I'll have something like it. [[Wiki Review]]:[[Wiki Audit]]::[[TDL]]:?? Exactly how best to expand this is something I've still not figured out, but frankly, there is so much to figure out.
* To be clear: I don't think I'm overthinking it. ;P
* The [[title.Title]]s are their own stamp, lol. Sleeping on it does that.
* It is clear that I have been resisting ketamine quite a bit.
