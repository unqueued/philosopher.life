* I've ditched lots of junk that I was interested in seeing for a brief time. Not even in the Outlist. Fuck it.
** Some [[pright]]ist groups I wanted to see play out...
** Censorship problems on Reddit; it's getting worse
*** Narrowed down to a few for now...
* It's been a long time since I've had an update. I mostly collected garbage, lol.
* My other multi-reddits have been a source of hedonic pleasure, ofc.
* I've got a lot of enemies to follow, lol. I've also got some experiments still running.
* Subs have been ballooning for me. I hope to cut down further on my next run.

Out:

* InconvenientDemocrats 
** The show is over. I've said what needed to be said to the democrats in my life, right? Lol. 
** I didn't have any content that I was clicking on here. `/shrug`
* Sneerclub
** Sometimes they are right (and I'm grateful to know there are others who have a problem with what I'm seeing too), but there's not a lot of positive work here. The project can't succeed as it is structured. I wish them the best.
