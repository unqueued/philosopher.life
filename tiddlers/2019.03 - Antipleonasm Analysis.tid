!! Audit:

* Some of these are extremely brief. 
** I guess that is going to happen sometimes.
* This is such a fragmented exploration. 
** Hey, at least you make progress.
* There's some heavy lifting in here, even if it is only coming to grips with the evils of the world.
* Almost everyone I've met will partially agree to some of these moves some of the time, but they have no interest in consistency, systematic reviews, or actually fucking thinking or doing anything about it. 
* This is such a dark and violent log. It's so heavy; I'm having a hard time lifting it.
** I make serious attempts at some precision too.
* It's been difficult to disagree with, correct, or improve upon [[Saint Chomsky]]. 
* I clearly still have no effective prescription.
** That's okay. This is the kind of problem an entire society has to try to solve together. You are one man.
* My illiteracy is completely obvious to me. It is shocking to me how much ground [[Saint Chomsky]] has covered. 
* I'm ridiculously US-centric.
* Some of my differences with [[Saint Chomsky]] boil down to either the fact that some of these claims are old (and partially outdated) or aren't concerned with philosophical foundations I find so necessary.
* There's some [[Prompted Introspection]] and personal anecdote in here. That's fine. That wasn't my intention, but I'm still learning what this project is really about.
* I took a break once. Perhaps I should continue to mix things up.
** [[Ayn Rand]] required breathers. It's too much breathtaking evil.
* There are some excellent lines of my own in here. 
* I am so glad to be done with [[Ayn Rand]] for now. It's such a relief. 
* I see the tentpegs coming down in here.
** There's some humility in there too.
* It's currently political. Will I ever move away from that?
** I [[hope]] so.
* This work is dense. There's wrestling in here.
