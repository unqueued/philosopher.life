!! Audit:

* Negative, aggressive, cynical, and generally right!
* Ugh, I need to edit more.
* I'm growing to love my short answers to Samwise's stupidity and Melisandre's absurd charity.
* I adore having footnotes. Sometimes they are just cute, but othertimes they give that caveat or side conversation I really needed to have.
* I'm a smartass.
* Admittedly, I wish I fleshed some of these answers out a bit more regarding "why." Yes, I know I've answered the question, but the goal is to answer more than the question. The goal is to answer the question as I would have asked it under ideal circumstances.
* I will admit, I've actually been very slightly relaxing my cynicism towards the fate of humanity. I see tiny beams of hope that I did not before.
* I am full of myself in this section. Lol. The bravado is hard to bear at times.
* Sometimes the non-answer is the right answer.
* Some of these are not as clean as I'd like, although the gist is still correct. There are just a handful that I have entirely a "meh" opinion about.
* I'm obviously horny as I write these.
* I very much like my positive ones. I want to make it a goal of mine to be more positive, even when negative responses are deserved.
* I appreciate my stringent idealism. I'm still fighting the good fight.
* I misinterpreted at least one of these questions. My wife pointed it out, and I'm glad.
* Some chains of questions are almost serendipitous.
* I see that several of these questions spawned further analysis and construction in my wiki. I think this is a great thing!
* I love that I can make myself smile and even giggle a month later by my answer.
* I think one day, this content will be used to generate a NN trained version of me.
** I wonder if it could computer the rest of the wiki. That would be interesting...jumping into the future.
* I can see empathizing with me is quite painful. Just even being me is painful, but I believe is profoundly amplified in others because it Redpills their perception of reality in ways that hurt far too much.
* Overall, great job!
