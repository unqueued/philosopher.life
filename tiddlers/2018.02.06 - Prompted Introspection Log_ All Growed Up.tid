title: 2018.02.06 - Prompted Introspection Log: All Growed Up

!! What do you think the world will be like when you are a grown up?

My Lady, you need this manchild, don't you? I am a grower not a shower. I will satisfy you when I grow up.

I am not yet fully developed at 32. When are we ever "grown up"? Insofar as I am grown up, I document it nicely in this wiki, particularly in the [[Link Log]]. I do spend my time trying to conceive of what the world will be like. As you have seen, I think it is fairly bleak. My predictions do not make me happy. I am working for my family to find the morally permissible bubbles of happiness and protection from man's self-destruction.
