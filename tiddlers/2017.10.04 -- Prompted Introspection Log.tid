!! Many people think teenagers are harder to parent than younger children. What do you think about that?

I feel like a failure, like I'm barely keeping my head above water. I hope I can be there for my children no matter what, even if it does get harder. So far, it feels like it is getting easier. But, I've not seen the hormones and changes in boundaries, etc.
