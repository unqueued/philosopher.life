!! What is something you are pessimistic about?

My ability to affect the world. It's almost guaranteed (though it is clearly possible) not up to me as an individual in some difficult to replace manner (though it often feels like I've not met anyone else who stands where I am). Do I think people should wrestle with me? Of course. Why would they? Lol. I do not know how to be morally infectious enough. I'm pessimistic about humans in general. My 3% rule is already a difficult pill to swallow for most people. This is a [[Stoicism-fu]] problem.
