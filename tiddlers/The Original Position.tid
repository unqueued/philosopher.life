!! About:

//Behold this previndicating political [[Diamond]] which shines forth like a precious jewel. Here I prophetically roar to you political animals. Even if I can't stand you, I do love you. This theoretical tentpeg project is part of my lifelong political praxis. Justice is found in the trying, not the succeeding. Bobby Hill, I'm blindly pointing to your superpowerless Maud'dibic-demigod-ordained philosopher-king savior, I'm here to speak on behalf of your creator: Mike Judge.<<ref "wk">>//

We need game-theoretically sound, technologically empowered, philosophically justified political economies. We must fight against social disintegration and political entropy. We must unify ourselves as a body politik into a virtuous agent, the philosopher-king. Prove that Humanity is not in perfect competition; demonstrate how even a divided house can stand.

As mutually self-interested golden-rule-following cosmopolitan [[T42T]]-Egoist Bayesian utility-maximizers behind the Veil of Ignorance collectively computing the Original Position, we must cooperatively vote to self-legislate the means to applying [[The Golden Rule]] by blindly learning to refactor the will to consider morally arbitrary characteristics out of our perceptions in order to see what is universally morally salient in our political game contexts.

Let us flourish as persons and not merely as humans. Here we plant a dynastic political tree whose shade we may never personally know. We must constructively vote for our future and not merely deconstructively against. In the Seldon opportunity-crisis before us, it is time for us to take enormous political and economic risks, be it an accelerant to our ex machina savior or destruction. This is what effective altruism actually looks like in the 21st century. You don't really own yourself, Libertarians: we collectively own and owe each other a great deal more than you've implied in your sleight of hand.

The Original Position, an evolving reformulation of the Kantian solution to the Ring of Gyges, is the best cross-cultural multi-agent computational-social-choice-theoretical conception of justice epistemically available to we fallibly finite Daseinic primates embedded in that Hegelian self-dialectic, [[The Great Human Conversation]], the final political goal of our [[4DID]], the ideal version of how we morally+optimally evolve in how we tell the stories of ourselves to ourselves (in both material and immaterial dialectics). It is a golden-rule implementation of political-algorithmic panopticons against each other. In a sense, justice is like an anonymous donation to humanity with no virtue signal except to some idealized version of yourself (or the hypothetical courtroom of the CI). It's the game-theoretic morality which axiomatically founded our rule-utility calculus with the supposition that we and all other people are ends in themselves, and we must morally weigh and defuse conflicting priorities fairly.<<ref "ut">> [[The Original Position]] is the best political compromise available to rational agents seeking to understand what we owe to each other: morally justified justice.

We need to optimize this crucial moral+political self-learning algorithm as hard as we possibly can (in polynomial time, of course). We must also implement it before Humanity psychopathically destroys itself, preventing the existence of the most unified agency which can possibly emerge from our collective identity through time. The Original Position is the only political tyrant to which we are morally obligated to submit. It is the Goodwill collectively defined, a heuristical social contract we implement and machine learn together; it is distributed computational empathy incarnate.

We must aim for maximally representative democracy over the [[4DID]] of Humanity, a mutating memetic subspecies implementation of Daseinically Kantian personhood (that famous Kingdom of Ends), to enable the political voices of all people to directly define //justice for all// as fairly as possible. Let us play the moral-political game together as righteously as we can. Let us make the best possible heaven on earth. No god will do it for us; we have to do it by ourselves for ourselves using something outside ourselves. The Original Position is how we effectively vote on how best to anti-luck find, understand, and apply [[The Golden Rule]] across the existence of our species.

A vote, in a functioning democracy, is a form of political capital we use to expressively weigh our identities alongside others as ends in themselves. Ideal Democratic Voting is the decentralized philosophipolitically prescriptive conception of [[The Golden Rule]] because it computationally prioritizes and executes the instrumental algorithmic means to coherently weaving humanity's ends into a Distributed Bayesian Human-Hivemind Turing Machine of Justice, the maximally superrational being we can logically possibly consent to together in our context. These are the means to socialism: decentralize power by collectively owning the Rawlsian basic structures of society (which just so happens to include our computational minds), i.e. the workers own the means of political and economic production. Essentially, we are together building the blockchain philosopher-king as best we can.

Pragmatically, we must engage in our contextually-particularized ideal reflective equilibrium: to iteratively develop our political governance in order to find the ideal external standard of moral legislation and executively put that objectively best possible concept of Justice epistemically available to us into practice (to internalize it; to constitute ourselves with that law). Like a distributed, decentralized Frankfurtian turing machine in the foundationless SO volitional will, Humanity must continually elect to evolve and transcend its previous identities in self-dialectic. The Original Position should be at the core of our identity because it's the morally best identity to have; it is our morally justified tower of babel designed to corporeally mimic the form of Rationality itself, to choose to bind ourselves as slaves to [[The Moral Law]] given to us by [[The Good]].<<ref "ac">>

!! Principles:

* Give the simplified ideal answer.
* [[The Original Position: Rhetoric]]
* Protip: It's worth being a cog in this machine, folks. Let's self-legislate the only law worth self-legislating, doing our best to politically implement the ontically+epistemically self-legislatingiveliest law of them all. Let's be as wise as we can be in both theory and practice.
