title: 2019.03.01 - Afterschool Teaching: Code

I arrived 5 minutes late. I'm quick with the prep though, so I still finished before Whitney. She takes her time, and I can appreciate that.

We talked about the fact that the rhetoricians are coming today. She is beginning to dislike them too. She says she wants to be a fly on the wall when I sit in today. I don't anticipate I'll be saying anything. I am opinionated and protective of my children though. I might not have a choice in whether or not these charlatans do their thing, but I can intervene in some cases. I didn't end up sitting in though.

6Bm is a fucking playa'. He has the highschool girls wrapped around him. They are even doing his homework and lying to my face about it. That is twue wuv.

8Cf says she hates the beginning of the month. I hear ya, girl. I hate cramps. I'm a full-blown pansy when it comes to pain.

No Delp today, and Mitchell wanted me to take the older kids straight to the lab because Friday are free days. Okay. Cool. 

8Gf, 7HM, and 6DM wanted to code today. FUCK YEAH! I don't give a shit if we are going to get in trouble for it. I'm done asking for permission. I'm going to play dumb and oops in these bases here. They didn't want to jump straight into python. We still took a peak because I want them to know where I'd go in their shoes.

In the end, after looking at the options, they chose Scratch. My daughter did this, and she enjoyed it. 8Gf seems the most dedicated so far (but I will not get my hopes up). She's going through the tutorials. Good.

5:24f and I talked about finding a college textbook instead. She is fairly advanced in Biology from the feel of it. 

There were beetles today. Everyone was freaking out. Cool. 

Matt is asking the rhetoricians to abbreviate the rhetoric. He's planned for everyone to play in the gym. I think he wanted the lab until then, but it didn't work out for him.

The kids swear more openly with me. I actually think it's important that they can swear where appropriate.

It was a reasonable day. It's generally smooth when Mitchell is in charge.
