title: 2019.10.20 - Prompted Introspection: 21st Century Democracy

!! If it were your job to decide what shows can be on t.v., how would you choose?

I still admire my answer in [[2017.11.23 - Prompted Introspection Log: Content Censor/Selector]]. I have a much better answer now: [[TPK]] + [[Outopos]]. Selection of what is [[salient]] through fitting voting, trusting authorities from personal verification, autonomy in filtration (we choose who will be our lenses and bubblemakers), and feed mechanisms built on P2P foundations! Democracy must choose it.
