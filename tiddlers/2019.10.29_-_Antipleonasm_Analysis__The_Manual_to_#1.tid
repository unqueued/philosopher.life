!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The majority of Number One’s are achieved early on in the artist’s public career and before they have been able to establish reputations and build a solid fan base. Most artists are never able to recover from having one and it becomes the millstone around their necks to which all subsequent releases are compared...either the artist will be destroyed in their attempt to prove to the world that there are other facets to their creativity or they succumb willingly and spend the rest of their lives as a traveling freak show, peddling a nostalgia for those now far off, carefree days. These are the lucky few.

I have no idea if that's true. Assuming one doesn't escape the majority's average, the correct strategy against this parodical description is to only deliver one. We might ask how the minority accomplishes such a thing. It reminds me of plenty of narratives from VH1. When I think about [[Music: Library]], most of the artists are one-hit wonders for me. Perhaps that is the case for most people, and marketing is what defeats it. Comparisons between anonymized releases of new songs from famous artists and similarly skilled unknown artists show no differences in preferences. Hacking the networks of trust (even for something seemingly arbitrary like memetic drugs) and commodifying the processes are probably how mainstream artists can snowball and maintain their attention leads.
