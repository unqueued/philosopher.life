!! About:

//Please, feel free to slide into my DMs. I entreat you to study the rules of nomadic engagement with me. May humanity be injected with the ever-evolving [[Golden Rule]] memeplex: live your [[Humanity]], humans. Be careful who you punish for telling the truth and why.//<<<ref "te">>

The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those that speak it.

/initiate the T42T cooperation handshake #prepare your butts for the hemlock, [[h0p3]]
```

Welcome. Come and walk with me behind a pseudonymized //Veil of Ignorance//. Let us find justice together. Publicly demonstrate your ability to mitigate or prevent how the //Ring of Gyges// alters your identity. Show me your integrity, nomad. Let's see what we're really made of. I come to fulfill [[The Moral Law]]. Do you? Let us construct civilzation bound by the only unconditional normativity that matters by universal definition. Let's constitute ourselves with [[The Good]]will.

Here I aim to transparently learn to trust you in [[T42T]] fashion.<<ref "t">> With the profound risk and handicap of breathtaking honesty, in the face of a species I consider largely comprised of psychopaths to various [[dok]], I trustingly hand over the raw information advantages of who I am (represented in this wiki) to you in the radical hopes that we will morally play an accelerated iterative non-zero-sum game of Respecting the Dignity of Kantian Humanity with each other (and beyond) in the reflective pursuit of the morally justified Nash equilibrium. I compromise and sacrifice myself from moral duty. I [[hope]] you learn to trust [[me|h0p3]] because you've had the overwhelming chance to sincerely know me inside and out; this wiki is deeply concerned with morally-justified public confidence, defeating spirals of silence, and fiercely facing the chilling effects of exploitative panopticons.<<ref "pc">> I aim to literally participate in a practical digital implementation of [[The Original Position]] algorithm while playing with my cards face-up on the table. My divergent vulnerability is no accident, and your vulnerability earns my trust too. 

I legitimately believe I endanger myself in writing, disclosing, and distributing this wiki, but I take few steps to hide my identity from [[others]] because I honestly aim to be an open ~~book~~ wiki in public (especially with myself).<<ref "p">> Essentially, as I hope for all of us, I am [[W5H]] searching and [[gopdar-mining]] for who you really are, stranger; I will do so kindly and openly in front of you and the rest of Humanity on this wiki. Thus, you will incur sousveillance costs to interact with me in [[T42T]] fashion. With integrity, I expect you to virtually be yourself with me.

I am going to publicly think about you, who you are, how you think, what you say, and what you do. Do you wish to be so open and honest? Do you really want to interact and be in contact with me? In this context, informed consent is your responsibility (and it always was). Do not let my honesty become your enemy. You do not have to wrestle with me, but I hope you see I'm actually trying to radically cooperate with Humanity.<<ref "n">> How will you treat this naked madman in the desert?

If you deem it necessary, please self-censor, anonymize, and cloak yourself. I will curiously think about your methods and appearances as best I can. I consider anything on the clearnet behind no paywall to be information you've left for me to find; I will try to reason about who you are. I consider the webbed-trails of links surrounding your clearnet<<ref "c">> identity to be a better-than-nothing open historical representation of your current identity and total [[4DID]].<<ref "f">> Think carefully about what you say or how you interact with me. Do not leak your metadata to me unless you really mean to.<<ref "st">> Insofar as you require it, it's your responsibility to dissociate your identity in this practice because ultimately I cannot do that for you. 

Do not expect me to answer in a timely manner. Consider no communication immune to posting, deletion, or revision on this wiki without a justification I buy.<<ref "rm">> Further, keep your own records if you must. For example, you will often find me writing my communications to you over the course of several days (or decades) on this wiki, and you can reason about how my writing came to be via capturing and analyzing daily (or even realtime) snapshots of this wiki (I know I do); see {[[Connect]]} and {[[Verify]]}. 

If you have a requirement, then be very specific with me! I will attempt to respect your wishes to remain anonymous and to maintain privacy when it is morally necessary. Provide your justificatory argument and explanatory plan for twisting my words or my hiding the information you either intentionally or might otherwise unintentionally give me //before// you reveal it. You must give me public reasons to change my public policies. Thus, compartmentalize and gamble your secrets and identities wisely with me. Let us transparently seek [[Righteousness|The Right]] in the desert together, nomad; let us build [[The Golden Rule]] practicing civilization together in trusting cooperation, integrity, and [[hope]]. Let us defeat Orwell & Huxley's demons together. We must [[Find The Others]].

As always, [[IA2DYJ]], and I ask you to kindly hold me accountable to it, nomad. Did I violate my {[[Principles]]}? Please tell me. I will do my best to re-engineer myself in both theory and practice when you justifiably sublate my argument. As you can see in this wiki, I am forever grateful to those who teach me a lesson from duty. Do you think you will be epistemically or morally justified in teaching me a lesson? 

We never certainly escape or transcend the fact that our relationships are adversarial except on faith.
