I am not absolutely in love with this piece, but it has an Asian instrumental triphop vibe to it and it's pleasant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7m86aMNjlQ
THU 12:06 PM
Oh, I did find a song I liked though...I literally woke up the other day hearing it out of my dream. That is extremely uncommon for me (or so I remember): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxg4C365LbQ
THU 12:08 PM
What left do you have on your plate for the presentation?
THU 12:09 PM
I will check these out in a bit
THU 12:18 PM
I have some presentations to finish editing and a lot of little loose ends to tie up.
THU 12:19 PM
You gonna make it?
THU 12:19 PM
or no worries about that, just frustration?
THU 12:20 PM
But things are looking up a bit more. My boss keeps getting pulled into other meetings without really explaining what’s going on, meaning she’s missing out on time to give necessary feedback. So my team has decided that if my boss can’t make it to these meetings anymore we’ll just record them so she can give her feedback on her own time.
THU 12:20 PM
ha!
THU 12:20 PM
Noice
THU 12:21 PM
So it’s not on us anymore.
THU 12:21 PM
As of now, we should make it yes.
THU 12:21 PM
well, I can't say it is guaranteed to play out like that, but it is ammo
THU 12:21 PM
It’s going to be tight though.
THU 12:21 PM
Exaclty.
THU 12:21 PM
Er, exactly**
THU 12:21 PM
Good, I am glad to hear you feel like you are going to make it.
THU 12:21 PM
Hopefully after the presentation you guys will slow down for the holiday season?
THU 12:22 PM
Hopefully
THU 12:23 PM
I’m also going to officially inform my boss that I’m looking for a new job after this event.
THU 12:23 PM
Huh. I am surprised you are going to say anything.
THU 12:24 PM
Why?
THU 12:24 PM
I fear that is a mistake.
THU 12:24 PM
(you have probably thought about it a lot more than I have)
THU 12:24 PM
We’re “required” to do so if we’re moving inside the company, or so I’ve been informed.
THU 12:24 PM
I have.
THU 12:24 PM
I want to see if I can move up and towards a job that will expand my skill set more towards what I’ll need as an engineer while I work towards getting my EIT and such.
THU 12:25 PM
Plus, the extra income will be nice.
THU 12:25 PM
And necessary as [[K]] focuses on wrapping up school.
THU 12:25 PM
Not ideal, but certainly realistic. The way things are, this job does not allow me the consistent time I need to focus on personal growth, so leaving this particular team is priority number one.
THU 12:26 PM
What jobs are you looking for, and which do you think will net you consistent time to focus on personal growth?
THU 12:27 PM
I am hoping to get something close to their research department, if I can. Or anything that would improve my systems-based technical knowledge as I know we deal with a lot of information in this company.
THU 12:30 PM
Very broad descriptions, but I’m not totally sure what all Humana does so I’m not trying to be overly specific if that makes sense.
THU 12:30 PM
aye
THU 12:30 PM
You going to look outside Humana as well?
THU 12:30 PM
Soon, yes. But mobility inside Humana is easiest at this point and guarantees livable wages.
THU 12:31 PM
Short term.
THU 12:31 PM
Moving outside Humana may require us to physically move for a Chem E job because there aren’t a ton around here that focus on what I’m looking for.
THU 12:31 PM
You could apply for non Chem E jobs too outside Humana.
THU 12:32 PM
Definitely.
THU 12:32 PM
I understand it's easy to use the inhouse Humana application process.
THU 12:32 PM
Part of that is I don’t even know where I’d start.
THU 12:32 PM
I can’t go down the ladder currently, only same level or up.
THU 12:33 PM
I am the breadwinner, so these are all things I have to consider (something something counter culture?)
THU 12:33 PM
I do have a question for you though — you said your job was an after school program. What do you mean by that?
THU 12:35 PM
Assuming I get it. I'd be a glorified babysitter who chooses how to do the programming.
THU 12:35 PM
Kinda off topic but I never got to ask last night because [[K]] wanted to watch Halloween
THU 12:36 PM
Interesting!
THU 12:36 PM
You get to mold the minds of youngins then or just tell them not to kill each other?
THU 12:36 PM
Or perhaps both?
THU 12:36 PM
both
THU 12:36 PM
\o/
THU 12:36 PM
We'll be spending a lot of time in the computer lab.
THU 12:36 PM
Yesss
THU 12:36 PM
Teach them useful things \o/
THU 12:37 PM
What led you to want to do so? :o
THU 12:37 PM
I need money.
THU 12:37 PM
and, I need to be able to look myself in the mirror after work, lol.
THU 12:37 PM
Best reason.
THU 12:37 PM
Actually, I lied. The second one is the best.
THU 12:38 PM
I wish “I need money” was a respectable answer to “why do you want this job” xD
THU 12:38 PM
or “I just want to do good work”
THU 12:38 PM
Though I guess the second could be, if the employer isn’t too far up their own ass.
THU 12:39 PM
The answer must demonstrate that you are exploitable and interested in maximizing shareholder value at any moral cost.
THU 12:39 PM
While appearing not to violate social norms that would be bad for public relations.
THU 12:40 PM
I'll be teaching Marxism to my younglings.
THU 12:40 PM
It’s all bullshit. Ugh.
THU 12:40 PM
But you are right, that is what they’re after.
THU 12:41 PM
Being moral requires sacrifice and taking very large risks in a culture and economy which reward clever dark-triadicism.
THU 12:42 PM
Truth.
THU 12:47 PM
It’s increasingly frustrating.
THU 12:47 PM
What’s sad is that the person who just recently left our team is keeping in touch, showing us job openings she thinks we’d be interested in or are qualified for because she knows we all want out.
THU 12:52 PM
She’s sent us so many I have to write them down.
THU 12:53 PM
Where'd she leave for?
THU 12:53 PM
Another internal department
THU 1:11 PM
“IT Business Performance/Process Improvement”
THU 1:11 PM
That sounds like a fun department.
THU 1:12 PM
