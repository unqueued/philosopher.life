I have no idea when I will hear back from the school. I have applied for other positions and it has taken months for them to get back to me. For a rejection letter. But the school year starts in August so I am curious as to how they're going to treat this. I still have very low expectations of any hope of getting the job. And if I do I'm afraid they will low-ball me such that I won't take it

Favorite photo of the weekend. July 4th, eating Baskin-Robbins, on the hood of their great-grandfathers truck. Who happens to still be with us. Watching fireworks from the neighborhoods across the street. Awesome memories for the memory bank for the kids and for me
