Hey [[h0p3]], hope you and the fam are safe/doing well
Mar 12 7:54pm
Hey Ivan! Yeah, we are doing well. [[k0sh3k]] has been anxious given all the CV19 planning she has to do at the school. We've been grinding away at home.
Mar 12 8:35pm
I hope you all are doing well. How are things going? The world seems busier and more frantic than usual.
Mar 12 8:36pm
Heh, yeah. People here are rushing the stores. I'm considering having a much smaller wedding which is actually closer to what I wanted in the first place.
We've also started apartment hunting!
Mar 12 8:58pm
That is fantastic.
