title: 2017.05.11 -- Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.05.10 -- Trump's Nixonian Firing of Comey]]
** Minor edits.
* [[2017.05.10 -- Link Log]]
** Surprisingly few links. I'd like to point out that I missed a day of links as well. Sometimes you come home empty handed after the hunt, eh?
* [[2017.05.10 -- How the Trump Family Makes Money Off POTUS]]
** Ideabagging it.
* [[2017.05.10 -- Astroturfing, Imageshaping, and Mass Manipulation]]
** I know to inspire hope in myself, lol. Realism, of course, is necessary to real hope.
* [[2017.05.10 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** To answer my previous point, I just want to remind myself how my posting habits oscillate. This isn't pointless. It is the back-and-forth, to-and-fro, the bouncing between metanarrative and deconstruction which allows to clarify, restructure, and find more resilient answers to the shifting problems.
* [[2017.05.10 -- h0p3's Log]]
** New hypothesis: Ice Cream is the problem.
* [[2017.05.10 -- Pipefitting Log]]
** Sometimes rereading my [[Pipefitting Log]] from the previous day gives me excellent context. Sometimes it's a waste. I can't expect a perfect signal-to-noise ratio here. I also don't know what will be useful to me. The problem of not knowing what I don't know, etc.
* [[2017.05.10 -- Diet Log]]
** Forgot to find the total.
