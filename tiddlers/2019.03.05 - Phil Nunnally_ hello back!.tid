title: 2019.03.05 - Phil Nunnally: hello back!

[[h0p3]],

Thank you for your [[letter on 2019-01-26|https://philosopher.life/#2019.01.26%20-%20Phil%20Nunnally%3A%20Quietly%20Watching]]! I only found it recently, figuring that I would be way under your radar, but I'm happy that I turned out not to be. You probably know by now that you and [[Sphygmus]] have spawned a host of admirers and tiddler-borrowers. I remember the moment in January that I ran across the first conversations between you and [[Jack Baty|jbaty]], and thinking to myself that this was the first truly new thing I had seen on the internet in years â€” maybe the first new thing since RSS feeds burst onto the scene. And it's not because of some brand-new technological breakthrough, because TiddlyWiki has been around for literally well over a decade. But some pieces of cosmic flint knocked together in just the right way that this method of note-taking, recording, writing, refactoring, sharing, dusting off, editing, and re-shelving has clicked with a number of us. 

Strangely (or not?), the more that a wiki is written for the person writing it, the more interesting it seems to be, for me at least. Jack [[wrote earlier today|https://rudimentarylathe.org/#2019.03.05%20-%20Journal]]:

> I've noticed that recently I've been organizing this wiki according to how //I// want to find things and less so that //other// people can find them. I'm unsure if this is a bad idea, but since I consider this place to be mostly for my records, it feels like the right approach. 

...and I feel the same about your wiki (and mine)! So much of yours is inscrutable to me, and I'm still trying to decipher how the Wiki Audits and Wiki Reviews work, but that will become more clear over time. No rush to figure it out.

I just don't know if I can/could be a good public self-modeler. I only put a sliver of my life and thoughts into my wiki, and just that small amount has grown far beyond what I thought it would when I started with an empty TiddlyWiki file and thought, "I wonder what I can do with this..." For me, for now, it's more than enough to know that a half-dozen people are interested enough in the minutiae I put in here that they come back more than once! I'm still surprised every day, honestly.

I'm thankful that you had the confidence in the potential for slow back-and-forth (and in me) that you threw up a flare and would wait this long for me to see it. Such a different way of operating than the hyper-instant feedback loop of post something, someone else sees it in seconds, and then you see in a few more seconds that they saw it and liked it. [[Micro.blog|https://micro.blog]] broke me of that rewardless habit and I have no interest in returning to it.

Regarding your [[Music: Library|https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library]], I //love// it. I'm compelled to do the same just out of appreciation for so many gems released into the world by artists. And I have to say I'm glad to see you organize your music list by the first letter of the artist's first name (when there is a first name). Apple ruined it for everyone with the artist sorting in iTunes, and I figure: Why fight it? But seriously, other than my attachment to physical vinyl LPs, it's hard to keep a physical attachment to music stored in digital media. I do have a pretty hefty library of FLAC files on a Raspberry Pi in the basement, and I can get to those anytime, but it's more interesting as I get older to record details about what music I found when, how I found it, and which music has stuck with me over the years. I'm about to unleash my "favorite songs ever" tiddler, which is similar to your Music: Library. Once you have practically endless hard drive storage, or the ability to stream almost anything you don't own, the value of all this music goes down. And then the attention and time it takes to listen to the music becomes the scarce thing.

Take care, and please take your time responding, if you ever feel moved to. I'm sure not winning any awards for fast correspondence around here, and I never want anyone to feel pressured to reciprocate.

I'm so glad to meet you (and all these nice people!)!,
