title: Rights: Computer Users

//I'm seeking morally justified political policies that grant, enable, and enforce political rights (and that is not to say we are morally justified in exercising them in all cases). The language is still too strong and oversimplified. There are huge loopholes I'm not sure how to close (intentions are hard problems), and there are difficult definitions yet unprovided (what is reasonable? XD). Unfortunately, I don't see enough [[T42T]] in it.//
