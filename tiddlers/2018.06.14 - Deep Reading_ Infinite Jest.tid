42- 49

Orin's life is sad. =(

My wife is going to be absolutely disgusted by this scene. She will also agree heavily with Orin and me.

It's interesting to see Tennis come up again. I assume Orin is compared to his brother often.

49- 54

Fascinating to hear about his drug habit again. I think I will hear about it for the rest of the book. It is a book about addiction.

Interesting that the secrecy matters so much to him.

Endnote number 3 is insanely specific, lol. That's fun. 

Endnote number 5 has to same absurd detail to it. I think I'm going for a ride down the rabbithole. In fact, all of the drug-related end notes for this section are plain interesting. Should I take a hint? =)

He hides it because...he's afraid of being seen as imperfect?

55- 60

Jesus. Gately sounds really sad too. I do not understand his "sense of style.

I don't see the value in endnote 24. It has a point, sure.

Also, I like how there are footnotes to the endnotes. That is exactly the recursive, overly referential style that I adore in my own wiki too.

Wow. The suicidal depressed drug OD discussion of Kate Gompert with the doctor is intense. The medical aspect of it somehow dehumanizes it.  COLD IMPRESSION, rofl! Yeah.

DFW went through electro-shock therapy, right? You can hear him in this book pretty loudly.

It's interesting to see the virtue of the practice example be something as bougie as Tennis. This reminds me Neo Yokio.
