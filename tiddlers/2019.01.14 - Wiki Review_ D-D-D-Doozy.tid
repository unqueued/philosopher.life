* [[2019.01.13 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Wine du jour]]
** Edited.
* [[2019.01.13 - Prompted Introspection: Meeting Myself]]
** My Engrish is getting worse and worse.
** Edited.
* [[2019.01.13 - Wiki Review: Long Digestion]]
** Feeling flooded here.
* [[2019.01.13 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Bliss]]
** Don't remember. I'm not going to guess.
* [[2019.01.13 - TDL: School]]
** Same ol' same old.
* [[2019.01.13 - jbaty: Greetings]]
** I need to reponse. I'm being ridiculously rude.
* [[2019.01.12 - TW Discord: I AM NOT A GURU!]]
** Finally, Gneiss sees the crazy ;P
* [[TW Discord]]
** It's been a weird experience.
* [[2019.01.12 - dziggetai: Splendid]]
** I need to get to it!
* [[2019.01.13 - BDS97: Delightfully Counterintuitive]]
** This dude blows me away. I wish I could be half as talented.
* [[2019.01.09 - Sho: New Year Stall]]
** Sho is so non-plussed by it, lol. She gives me hope.
* [[2019.01.11 - Sho: Cat of Arms]]
** I just like the title. That's all.
* [[2019.01.04 - Jop: Funeral]]
** It's nice to have grandparents.
* [[2019.01.11 - Jop: So Nice]]
** I aim to be kind more than nice.
* [[2019.01.04 - Tasha: In Our Heads]]
** I only discuss with Tasha. The guys never talk.
* [[2019.01.08 - Tasha: Bodyguard]]
** That show isn't so great in hindsight.
* [[2019.01.13 - Tasha: Spectrum]]
** She works a lot. 
* [[2019.01.03 - T-Money: NYear]]
** I'm fucking failing.
* [[2019.01.05 - T-Money: Music]]
** He always wants to the quick likes and approval from me. I'm here to have a conversation. 
* [[2019.01.08 - T-Money: Bubble Gut]]
** I love when I have the chance to Google shit.
* [[2019.01.12 - T-Money: Empathic]]
** That is quite kind.
** He's still on the Libertarian track. `/facepalm`
* [[2019.01.13 - MB: Wasting My Time]]
** Yeah. She doesn't care. It's time to own up to it.
* [[2019.01.13 - AIR: Worrying Silence]]
** He must be feeling like a failure right now.
* [[2019.01.13 - JRE: Vidja]]
** He has an interesting interrogation of them losing their phones with them.
* [[2019.01.13 - JRE: BDay pr0n]]
** He knew exactly who they were, rofl!
* [[2019.01.13 - JRE: Weekend]]
** I wonder if he will ever figure out that the wiki is truly the ultimate vidya game.
*** Too afraid for a number of reasons.
* [[2019.01.06 - L: Busy]]
** Her donor was also a man who was quite concerned with his physical health. She is lucky to have inherited aspects of him.
* [[2019.01.11 - L: Defijitely]]
** It appears to be avoidance. =/
** It also appears she tips her hand when she says "fair enough." It's like when she prefaces sentences with "honestly."
* [[2019.01.07 - K: Aaaaannnd, We're Back!]]
** I'm very pleased to see it is a mistake and not on purpose!
* [[2019.01.08 - K: Tittat]]
** I need to do it. He's right.
* [[2019.01.09 - K: Lit Theory]]
** He appears to actually look at the site (no, I do not employ analytics  or spy on you folks; this is just a feeling). I think he might look even more than his wife and mother-in-law. 
* [[2019.01.10 - K: Initiation]]
** I very much appreciate how he view of what occurred. He toes the line to demonstrate to me that he knows it's there. `/salute`
* [[2019.01.13 - K: DnD]]
** "Give our best." I know that signal. He only has so much time to connect, and he has a billion people that matter to him. I appreciate how much time he does put into us.
* [[2019.01.05 - Brad: Funseeker]]
** Sounds dark-triadic again and again to me.
* [[2019.01.13 - Brad: Raspberries]]
** This is such a weird relationship.
* [[2019.01.03 - Sphygmus: 10,000 Things]]
** I went from barely seeing a peep out of her to more work on her wiki than I have mine per day (which, no offense, is gorgeously insane).
* [[2019.01.04 - Sphygmus: Music Desert]]
** Welp, we'll keep lookin'. 
* [[2019.01.07 - Sphygmus: Making The Call]]
** She has way more wiki experience than me. It keeps showing up again and again.
* [[2019.01.12 - Sphygmus: Frenetic Jazz Syncopation]]
** We might not be getting enough sleep.
* [[2019.01.13 - Sphygmus: Joke]]
** I've been looking for you. I'm 98% sure you are lurking, just like my daughter.
*** It's the best kind of paranoia I get to have. Is this stranger my friend [[Sphygmus]] fuckin' with me?<<ref "w">> Most of the time I see strangers as adversaries, and it's a blessing to have the chance to legitimately think they could be as good as [[Sphygmus]] speaking to me in disguise.
* [[2019.01.04 - AA: Pinched Nerve]]
** Indeed, we both know that, lol!
* [[2019.01.06 - AA: Nikki]]
** Is it fair to say she avoids what I find most fascinating or anxiety inducing?
*** Maybe she's just thinking about it.
* [[2019.01.09 - AA: Caffeine Hunter]]
** Where did you she see the resolutions? I have no idea when, how, or what she is reading. My best guess is that she has looked at an [[FTO]] log. That is the most likely case.
*** If you are reading this, `/wave` =)
* [[2019.01.13 - AA: How's Afterschool?]]
** The years have trained her to be realpolitik in her classrooms in a particular way. It's interesting to see.
* [[2019.01.11 - AA: Cannot Even Can]]
** Our discussions are short. Why?
* [[2019.01.13 - Family Log: Short]]
** Thank you, [[j3d1h]].
* [[2019.01.11 - BDS97: Ping Pong]]
** I really hate not being able to immediately respond to [[BDS97]]. Sometimes he deserves feedback on the spot. I may not be much use to it, but I need to be as much use to him as I can.

<<footnotes "w" "Which is not to say [[Sphygmus]] would be dishonest with me! I'm just entertaining the possibility because it's interesting. I can only hope to find people like her, including her.">>
