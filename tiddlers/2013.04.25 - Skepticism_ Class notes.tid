title: 2013.04.25 - Skepticism: Class notes

```
Peronian Skepticism (very extreme)

Can’t even assert that I don’t know. How can we live in a practical way?

Are we dreaming? Are we brains in vats? Are we deceived by an evil demon?

Problem of Induction.

Problem of other minds.

Russell – How do I know the world didn’t come into existence 5 minutes ago?

JTB:

S knows that p if and only if

    S believes p

    P is true

    S has good justification for p



Internalism

-Access Int., the justification that is required for knowledge must be something to which the knower has access

-Psychological int., the justification for knowledge must consist only of psychological states of the knower



Foundationalism and Coherentism are internalist theories



Externalism

-to have knowledge that meets the third conditionof knowledge must be lreated ot the external world in the appropriate way



Regress problem

Solve it circularly, foundationally…etc.



I can’t tell about some particular objects. I can’t know anything about those particular things, but perhaps you might know some general stuff. Stroud is showing that you can’t know anything about the external world.

If I know some proposition about the world, then I’m not dreaming

Ex(K(x)) -> ~D

~~D -> ~ Ex(K(x))

D -> ~ Ex(K(x))



Does the skeptic assume certain things in order to be a skeptic?

Some people start with instances of knowledge, then try to build a theory to explain why those instances count as knowledge. A skeptic, on the other hand, is going to start with a theory, and then see what instances of knowledge follow from it.

They might suppose the theory that we are stuck behind a veil of representation. That is a philosophical theory of perception. If skepticism only followed from a theoretical view that the skeptic held, then the kind of thing Stroud wants to do, he couldn’t pull off. It needs to be practical and common.

    Skepticism follows from a certain project, but doesn’t follow in real life.

    Skepticism follows from a particular set of beliefs, and perhaps we can reject those.

    Skepticism follows from our ordinary beliefs about knowledge and our ordinary practices in attributing knowledge. This is what Stroud wants to have.

Descartes Condition – pg 12. – for any particular proposition p about the external world, I know that p only if I know that I am not dreaming that p.



Veil of perception/Veil of representation. Skepticism is not just the result of this sort of philosophical theory. It isn’t broad. It matters to Stroud that the problem fo knowledge is generated by something that is grounded in our ordinary use and ordinary thinking about knowledge. It isn’t merely grounded in philosophical projects or theories which are a matter of debate.



Maybe we don’t gain knowledge based upon a set a principles. Perhaps this is really a business for psychologists.



Otto Neurath, Neurath’s boat. We can replace and evaluate the planks on a boat. We can’t, however, replace and evaluate the boat all at once because it would sink.



If I know that I am sitting here by the fire, I must know that I am not dreaming that I am sitting here by the fire.

This is a best possible case or paradigm case. If it fails,then everything weaker than it will also fail.



Metaphysical possibility and necessity – what is really possible or not possible

Epistemological possibility and necessity – insofar as my evidence tells me, this is possible or not possible



The morning star (hesporous) is equivalent to the evening star (phosphorous). It is possible that Hesperus is unequal to phosphorus.



How do you know that you can just dream any possible thing? Maybe you can’t actually. The skeptic is making an assumption about what is possible.



Knowledge is closed under deductive logic. If S knows P, and S knows that Q deductively follows from P, then S knows that Q. That holds for any P and Q.

Is it that you can know Q or that you in fact know Q???

If S knows that he is sitting by the fire, and S knows that if he is sitting by the fire, then he is not dreaming that he is sitting by the fire. Then S knows that he is not dreaming that he is sitting by the fire.

From a general principle of deductive closure, we can use this form of argument to support skepticism.



Stroud isn’t promoting this kind of deductive closure based argument.??



Why should I agree to Descarte’s condition? Is that something I know? If I don’t know that, it isn’t clear that we can get there. Why should we accept Descartes’ condition on knowledge.







Why is Descartes’ condition a part of the best definition of knowledge or even the ordinary (Austin) use of the word knowledge?

You have to have a reason for doubt. Doubt itself requires a reason. If you just give a worry, you need a reason for it.

Does the strength of valid reasons which justify a person’s doubt vary from culture to culture? Shouldn’t we be worried about convention playing so much a role in this theory? What should be the standards set for the reason for doubting?

We could just respond: “they don’t have our concept of X” ….where, perhaps, X is knowledge, or whatever.



Reasonable Doubt

Assertible vs. True

Assertibility conditions, when something is assertible



I don’t like the relativized definition of knowledge.

I can assert he is here.

I know Ricky is here.

I believe with the justification that is conventionally required that Ricky is here.



What is “justified enough?” Justified enough for what?



Assertibility conditions and Truth conditions are different.

Pragmatism foregoes truth conditions.



    I know that John is coming to the party.

        Is that justified?

        Is that true?

According to the traditional conditions, it is justified and true.

Skepticism pushes me towards the idea that knowledge is Justified Belief without a truth condition.



There are mountains in Africa, whether we exist or not, whether we have a word for them or not. Once we understand what we mean by “mountains,” is knowledge independent in the way that mountains are? Is there a way that knowledge in general is to be discovered?



Stroud has a highly objective picture of knowledge. Brower disagrees.



Contextualism says there isn’t a highly objective thing that is knowledge.

Knowledge is dependent upon a practical project.



My question is: if knowledge doesn’t exist as some object standard, then what does epistemic duty and obligation look like?





Maybe skepticism is the sort of thing we can just ‘set aside’ as a special problem.



Stroud

There are questions about everything, neurath’s boat, vs. everyday sort of questions and knowledge.

Stroud makes a mistake at the beginning of the chapter.



Frege- Words have meaning in the context of a sentence. Words by themselves don’t have meaning. It only makes sense to use words in a sentence. Now that we’ve used certain words in so many sentences, they begin to have meaning by themselves.



Wittgenstein broadens Frege’s perspective with the language game. Broadening this language game to knowledge, ….

It doesn’t make sense to say “I know” unless you are responding to a particular doubt. It would be very odd to assert “I know P”….instead, you’d just say “P”. You’d say there the bathroom is, not that you know where the bathroom is…I’d only say “I know” if someone raised a doubt about it.

What does this say about Moore?

Witt: not just anything can count as a doubt. The doubt, in order to be legit, needs to have a place in the language game.



Malcolm’s claim is neo-wittgen: what Moore is really pointing out is a Wittgensteinian claim. That isn’t a legitimate reading of Moore though.

Physiological example, of other crazy people doubting, and “we know there is world, even if they don’t”…doubt it not being raised directly, but it is indirectly.

We don’t have a place in our language game for the skeptical question. Skeptical moves in the language game lack significance/meaning, even though they might have Fregean meaning. Ah, but there is the problem. Inappropriateness in the language game is not the same thing as saying that it is meaningless. Thus, while the skeptical argument might not be appropriate, it is far from meaningless, which is a problem for Malcolm’s argument.



Moore

I am always more certain that I have hands (and other external things) than I about any given philosophical premises, and thus we should reject relative certainty.

Selects mutually exclusive propositions based upon which proposition he has more confidence in…we need to know “why” one should be more confident or certain.



Psychological certainty – We “feel” that the pencil’s existence is more certain than the skepticism principle. But, that doesn’t lend any legitimacy.

Descartes’ certainty – normative certainty – legitimately believed



If I know the list is incomplete, then I don’t know the butler did it.

P->~Q

Q->~P

Not a sufficient refutation, but a valid inference if his assumption is correct.





If I know that p, then I must know that I am not dreaming that p.

~(I know that I am not dreaming that p)

So, I do not have p.



One philosophers modus ponens is another philosophers modus tollens, and vice versa.



Stroud wants to say there is something silly/crazy about the apprentice saying that he knows the butler did it and so he knew the list was complete.

I know ‘That p’ is first order, I know ‘that I am not dreaming that p’ is second order.

First order should not have impact on or be about the second order, while the second order does have impact on the first order.

Whether or not the list was complete, and the butler did it.

Duke’s murder example is an analogy to Moore’s argument, and the analogy points out a problem in the form of argument so that this doesn’t all boil down to a comparison between the certainty I have between 2 mutually exclusive propositions. What exactly does it point out?



Moore may even be more certain of his hand than of the entire philosophical inquiry as an enterprise.





Knowledge is justified belief, and that justification doesn’t require that proposition of the belief being true.



In response to “why” are you certain about X…

We start doing philosophy in our ordinary ways. We can say, “that’s where I am starting from” and I don’t accept philosophical positions. When you come along with your crazy philosophical positions, I am more certain that I know there a desk in front of me than your philosophical theory. Do I need to explain why I am certain about this?

Legitimacy or certainty might be just in how we ordinarily use language.

But, if we are doing philosophy, then we are playing a philosophical language game where it is okay to ask the skeptical question.





Paper: exercise, here’s a problem, X, Y, Z. Nice little point about the material we’ve read up til now (or any of the articles we’ve read). Do The ARTICLES COMING UP!!! DON”T SHOW IGNORANCE! HE GRADES NICER!



You have to have some epistemic standards. You have to have beliefs. You can’t be tranquil if you think everything is equal, you can’t really do anything at all. It seems odd that Sextus seems to be asserting things, as assertions seem to require justification, like knowledge.

What if we aim at truth, what is the guarantee that there will be equipollent arguments on both sides?

Sextus has to know that his modes are argumentation are good modes.

There is no fact about you or your past that demonstrates that you really know the meaning of your term. Rule following problem.

He maybe can’t make the assertion that there are always two sides. Maybe that’s just what has worked for him thus far, and he’s continuing his method.



The Dialectical Problem – About Disagreement.

When we make an assertion about something, there is always someone who disagrees. The core problem the ancient skeptics raised is a problem about disagreement.

An impartial observer who attends to a dispute between two persons – both persons are begging the question. So, what about when you are a party in the dispute? You have your own beliefs about the matter. You have to realize that it may end in a tie.

Realism, appearance is different from reality, the disputers each have their own appearance. Reality is separate. How to distinguish true appearances from false ones? This seems impossible.



The Problem of the Criterion



Particularists vs. Methodists/Generalists vs. compromise position of Reflective Equilibrium



Chicken or Egg?

What is the ground for any rule if it isn’t based upon testing it against instances of knowledge?



The particularist will treat people as using the word “know” correctly and incorrectly in various circumstances.



If we are trying to capture our general dispositions, “how we use language” and “how we understand concepts” then it is really about capturing whether or not the general dispositions outweigh our particular dispositions…???





Greco – virtue theory – often externalist or externalist in part.

Where skeptical problems go wrong:

A good perceiver isn’t doing trig to calculate in our binocular vision. That’s not what perception is like.



    Empirical Realism

        Locke – representative realist

    Empirical Idealism

        Descartes

        Berkeley

            When you turn around, does the object go away? (God is still perceiving it, so no, it doesn’t)

        The stuff in the world is literally made out of ideas of the mind

    Transcendental Realism

    Transcendental Idealism



The traditional way that Kant gives an argument is to give a transcendental argument, which has the following structure:

Point out that we do have a certain kind of experience.

What is necessary for us to have that experience (or representation)? A priori necessary.

Problematic (possible), Apodictic (necessary)

We bring certain aspects of logic to the way we talk about the world.



In order to have any experience, we must understand the world as having causation and substances (something like what Aristotle was talking about) which have properties. We can’t conceive of the world in any other way, and these categories must apply. We can’t have a coherent thought about the world without thinking in these ways. The world has to be this way ‘for us’.

How could we think of the world independent of us? Either nothing or with these categories.

In the world about which we talk, these properties must be instantiated. Maybe there is another world out there that is totally separate, …?

“The thing-in-itself” we still tend to think of it as an individual substance/or set of substances, and we tend to think of properties out there in the world, and we tend tot hink of these things as causing representations in us. But, to think of it like this already requires that we employ these ‘categories’.

The world that we talk about and represent must be this way – that is not to say we can’t be wrong at any individual time. For example, if I took LSD and hallucinated a cat, I would be wrong in thinking there is a cat there, but I’m not wrong about the basic nature of the world. I represent the world as sitting out there, and I can’t be wrong about that. I cannot think about anything at all unless I think of it as having certain basic properties. The world must have the basic properties. If we try to think of the world without these properties, we can’t think of anything. It is necessary that the world we think about has these properties.

The general structure of the world must be a certain way. Kant is an empirical realist, as there either is a cat out there on the desk or there is not. We could be mistaken about it. We can’t however, be mistaken about whether there is an external world or categories about it.

Transcendental does not mean transcendent. It is an a priori matter in which something necessarily has to be in order for us to understand it. Transcendental means it is part of the way we think about it.

Transcendental realism would be: the categories of the world is determined independently of us…



Kant is not a realist about space and time.



The world we experience and represent must be a certain way just because there is a certain way we experience and represent it?

But, the skeptic is bound to say: Why doesn’t this just show that the way we think of the world is necessary to our thinking about the world, but that doesn’t show that the way we think about the world is right? Yeah, it might be necessary for us to think about the world in a certain way, but why is that demonstrating necessary facts about the world.



Suppose I say to you: “I’m think of a Frishnik” (made up word)

The verificationist would say, in order to have a meaningful word here, I have got to be able to explain he conditions under which I could justify that something is a Frishnik.

Everything feels fleeting, we need something permanent to let us know that “I” exist through time.



Here is the one thing we all have: an awareness of us existing through time, we have to have a reference to measure ourselves against, something permanent, so to apply the idea we exist through time requires something existing outside ourselves.



We don’t know what “thing in themselves” are like.



Instead of saying that the world has to be this way in order for us to have X,….

Joseph asks: I can’t help but think of myself as an object that exists through time. I can’t help but think of an object out there with permanence that I compare myself to. But, can’t I still ask, do any other those concepts really apply? Can’t I still ask if I am really permanent, even if I naturally think about myself that way?

In order to think of things in one way, we have to think of things in another way.

Kant starts out assuming that we see ourselves as free. If we don’t see ourselves as free, then there is no way out.

Just because we have to engage as if we are free does not guarantee that we are in fact free.

Just because we presuppose something doesn’t mean we are right about those presuppositions. We might be justified, but we might be wrong.



What is a number?

    Realist

    Logicists (reducing to sets)

    Formalists – there is no number two, but to talk about 2 is to talk about ways of using, instrumentally, objects in the world. 2ness is reduced.

Sentez, Erkenntis?? Journals. Phil Studies.



Of course, in order to perceive that chair, there is a lot of causal stuff that has to happen.



You have to have immediate access to the external world just to make claims about yourself….??



Epistemic priorty:

X, Y, Z

I need X to infer Y, and Y to infer Z.

For example, I need experience directly claims, then I need macro-sized world claims, then perhaps theoretical scientific claims, etc.



Berkeley-The desk is constituted of my ideas. In Cartesian dualism, the desk is made up of something mental.

But, in the realist view, the desk is not made up of mind stuff (that G.Washin was president might be made up of mind stuff), and many things aren’t made of sensations and ideas. We look at the world as being independent of our beliefs, justified or not.

Categorical independence (a possibly Kantian view).

A water is not constistuted out of my ideas. Whether it is true or false that there is a waterbottle is independent of my ideas.

The world does not come labeled. The world does not chop itself into kinds. We do.

Here is the world, and of course it is empirically separate from us.

We can’t be wrong about which basic categories apply to the world.

The idea of a thing in itself is like this:

Suppose you encounter the world, we aren’t talking about anything mystical when we say things in themselves. This very world we live in, the concepts had to come from the world itself. The world doesn’t chop itself into kinds, we can’t conceive the worlduntil we bring to bear upon it our categories. Once we talk about stuff external to us, individual substances and properties that inhere in them, then we can talk about the world, but the world doesn’t come chopped into kinds at that fundamental level. We come along and do that chopping.



I can be wrong about ‘things in themselves’ in the transcendental sense, I can’t know anything about them, they areindepdent of me entirely. “Things in themselves’ don’t come in any human category, they are just out there. Category of substance, number of things, etc. That doesn’t make them into anything weird.

When we say it is transcendentally dependent, we don’t mean that it is made of mind-stuff, but rather that we have to apply categories to it.



If we don’t’ accept transcendental idealism, and accept that other things are independent, then we can’t about it as being dependent. ??? There is a world beyond us that is beyond our categorization.



That we can’t talk about the transcendental ideals that we can’t talk about, it seems that we come up with a form of skepticism. Response: there is stuff out there that we can’t conceive or talk about, we can’t bring to bear upon it our categories. ….but no, we do bring to bear our concepts upon the world because the world does not tell us how it is cut into kinds. We do not have a way of thinking about it unless we bring our categories.

Nominalists – categories exist in name only, we invent them, there are no properties or kinds.

What is it to be a table? Nominalists says we determine what is a table, we do. It is our concept that we use thatin some sense creates the kind table. Once we’ve got our concept, we can be wrong or right about the world, but until we bring our concept to bear upon the world, it doesn’t make sense to talk about tables. Think about the same thing for categories.

If I look at the world of furniture just in themselves, without bringing my furniture concepts to them and contribute to the furniture, the world is mute.



Verifiability Criterion of Meaningfulness: a statement, belief, or proposition IFF it can be verified on the basis of experience (or is analytically true). An extension of empiricism…

Positivists want to rule out some traditional issues in metaphysics. Debates about freewill, causation in the world or if causation are principles we’ve constructed, etc.

Emotivism, moral propositions lack cognitive meaning (might have meaning otherwise, but not cognitive, true or false, etc.)



Stroud mentions to self-contradictory nature of verificationism/positivism.

Stroud tries to solve it by asking: Does it match our ordinary beliefs about what is meaningful?

Ayer talks about positivism as being a recommendation, even though it isn’t confirmable.
“When we say something is meaningless, does it fit with a kind of reasonable recommendation?” Does the claim of freewill, for example, make a good sort of recommendation. (how does a positivist give an account of recommending?)

What is “meaninglessness?”

There are a lot of technical puzzles that I might enjoy.



Pretend there was a dinosaur standing where I am 100 million years ago. That is either true or false, but it doesn’t seem confirmable. Whether or not Caesar cut his toenail on Wednesday such and such a date seems meaningful, but not something I can confirm.

There is a golden mountain (of certain proportions) on a within planet 200 million lightyears of earth. Meaningful, but not verifiable.

One way to respond to this:

If one of us had been at that planet, or living 100 million years ago, or sitting next to Caesar, then we could verify it.

Problems of God, freewill, or being bound to moral law can’t be confirmed through imagination – they can’t be confirmed in principle. Whereas the others are confirmable in principle, even if not actually right now.

Positivism generally rejects a great deal of metaphysics.

Why should I think there is absolutely nothing meaningful about something which I can’t in principle verify?



Carnap:

Instead of talking about the desk or other things in the room, I could instead talk about everything in terms of complicated sets of sensations. Instead, we might just use one word to talk about that set of sensations. We could in principle just about our sensations and not talk about the ‘world of things’. The decision to use a particular conceptual framework and talk about things , as opposed to talking about sensations, is a practical decision.

It is a pragmatic question, not a question about the way the world is, to ask which framework we should use. It would, afterall, be very burdensome to talk about the experiences I have instead of the objects or the individual things.

Things look different from different perspective. The sensations that make up a thing are very complex. To use the term “Michael” to describe me is much easier than describing the sensations. Communication becomes too difficult unless we have a pragmatic framework. My wife has to, atm, talk about condition sensations. We bundle together the sensations, a set, and stamp my name on it. Using names is just one conceptual framework.

There could be many kinds of frameworks. Our language choice is not a choice about the way the world is though. Talking as if the choice of framework is meaningful or not is confused if it is anything other than ‘if it works’ pragmatically.



External questions: which framework should we take? The way you answer these external questions is to consider the pragmatic features, how they organize experience, etc.



In some sense, there is an external world, there is an empirical way of understanding it. The skeptic has a different ‘reading’ or understanding of the question of the external world, however.

Could we find out that we are dreaming?

From an internal perspective (the world of common sense), how could we find out that we are dreaming in the external sense?



I have a theory of what the external world is like. People do not morph into trombones, desks aren’t the sort of the thing I can move my hand through, etc. I can have a set of experiences such that I can say “I’m not experiencing the external world” – similarly, every person is certain in the psychological sense that we aren’t dreaming, we could have the experience of waking up right now.

If external world means, “a world which is separate from my mind” with no account of what it is like, even a skeptic might be able to grant that. …??



Carnap is in agreement with the skeptic’s conclusion, if he thought it had meaning.

Both the carnap and the skeptic agree that we cannot determine if there is an external world - we can’t verify it. Carnap isn’t a skeptic only because he holds the verificationist principle. The conditional correctness of skepticism, if the skeptic were saying something meaningful, he is correct because it can’t be verified.



Suppose you are a brain in a vat. Is this empirically disconfirmable? Could we have any sort of experience that could confirm it? Could I see a vortex in front of me and see the thousands of brains in vats, and know that I’m not hallucinating, and then confirm it? The positivist will have to say that it isn’t confirmable or disconfirmable.



Built into the description of skeptical alternatives that they are so strong that you cannot even in principle find out that they are true or false. The “in principle” is exactly what makes it meaningless.



How are we supposed to choose between two frameworks? Wouldn’t we need to know something already to do so. Don’t we at least have to know that we exist…?? We need to know that other people exist in order to do communication well. You could choose a framework just for yourself.

There is at least some independent reality (that we exist, and that there is experience that needs to be organized).



Right now, I use the language of things. I’m in this room with other people, and I can talk about these things. Now, does Carnap want to say (the author is asking), if I choose the phenomenal language, do we want to say that…??



Dobcheek (madeup word, a certain place below our eye). Not important to us, but maybe the painting of the dobcheek matters to certain tribes or something. We could then find out that there is something medically important in the dob cheek. Whether or not we choose to name these things, we have the intuition that they exist. Carnap seems to suppose that the world is somehow dependent upon our framework.



Other people exist, but if we chose a different framework, that claim would be meaningless. The claim that other human beings would not be true.



The sentence “p” is true.

Deduce p



It should be part of language that, If the sentence ‘p’ is true, then p. But, Carnap seems to need to say that whether ‘p’ depends on whether we have adopted a language framework in which we can talk about it being true.



Donkey sentences:

If “donkey” was defined as an object that has 3 legs, then how many legs would donkeys have?



Verificationism would have succeeded only if we could agree on the standards of verification. If we can show how our knowledge of theworld was justified….



What constitutes adequate confirmation/verification? How do you know you aren’t dreaming that hand is there? That standard of verificationis going to need to rule that out, right?

The positivist seems to be begging the question against the skeptic, that is just part of the standard/constitution of adequate confirmation. The nature of empirical confirmation itself is the real debate between the positivist and the skeptic.



There seems to be a kind of idealism that embedded in this theory.



For empiricists, all we're doing is talking about how we use language.

Quine attacks the notion of meaning itself.

He argues for the indeterminacy of translation; you can map more than one set of meanings to any set of sentences. Hence, skepticism about meaning. Even the objects of reference are not determinate – ontological relativity. There isn't a fact of the matter about what we refer to.

He's playing the hardnosed empiricst.

An empiricist looks out at the world and sees impression. I hear loud noises, see shapes, etc. We don't see necessity out there though. There isn't an experience of necessity in a way. What is it to have a power or a disposition, a law of nature? These are puzzles for empiricists. Likewise, meaning is a puzzle.

Suppose one of us says something about bachelors, and another about unmarried men. They sound different. What makes them have the same meaning? What is it for two things to mean the same? What isa meaning in the first place?

He is attacking the notion of analyticity. We can't explain terms via synonyms.

Traditionally, you have the a priori contrasted with the empirical. A priori, analytic is contrasted with the synthetic. A priori analytic, you have the notion of necessity, co-extensional. Empirical truths are synthetic are contingent.

Narrow logical truth: something that is true according to the rules of standard logic. Tautologies. He gives us these logical truths (even though an empiricst might have trouble with them).

If we can reduce something that is broadly analytic to a narrow logical truth, then he'll give it to us.



Shouldn't our problem with this be that the language has been limited to the same domain. The reason these sentences mean different things is that is various domains, we would have different outcomes. If the world were a bit different, the differences in the sentences would shine forth.



What is analyticity – when you substitute synonyms for synonyms to get a logical truth. Well, what is a logical truth? When you can substitute a synonym and get the same truth values.



The tradition in empiricism is to analyze or reduce more theoretical claims to sense data or sense impressions.

X is a student desk iff ….if you have this set of sensations...or...if you have this set of sensations...or...if you have this set of sensations...etc.

What does it mean to say there is student desk? It gets cashed out in terms of the experience you have. Synonymy is crucial to the empirical tradition because ofthis.

Quine wants to reject the reduction.

What kind of empiricism is left?

Quine is a holist of sorts.



We test sentences from or as a part of broader theories. We are testing the whole theory at once.

The only reaosn I think there is a desk in front of me: I have eyes, the lights are on, thelighting condition is on, I haven't been slipped LSD or had tequila to the point of hallucination, I'm not dreaming, etc. I have this whole theory of what I am as an embodied being, what the conditions are that make my sight good, what skills I have, what special conditions do or do not obtain, when I look to see the desk in front of me...the mean cannot be capture just by my experience. I could have this experience if I was dreaming all the time. I only accept there is a desk because I am testing the entire theory or system of beliefs at once.

You don't test sentences on their own. You test them as a set of beliefs, a large theory.



Any statement could be made true with the right theory.



If you have a certain set of scientific values (unification, simplicity, etc.), then you are going to believe in these particles. If you have other values, then you'll have other values. I happen to value scientific values more than Homer's Gods, and that's why I have the beliefs I have.

Undetermination of theory by evidence.

I could have a choice between two differen theories of anything. Did John kick the stone because he was angry or because he was having fun? We can look at his recent history and demeanor otherwise, we can have addition theories to help us...etc.

We can believe just about anything because we can adjust our beliefs to account for any problems that might otherwise refute our theory.

The picture is a web of belief. Some things are central to that web, and some at the periphery. The stuff at the center we are unwilling to change. The claim that bachelors are unmarried men are really central. If we were to change it, we'd have to change a whole lot of other beliefs.

I want to show that we could change our belief that all bachelors are unmarried. We wouldn't do it via a door to door test. We need a radical story. You have to change a lot of your web of beliefs to change your central belief. Every time a human is born, aliens come down and perform a rite, a rite we don't see, and they put us in a state of “suspended animation” ….At the moment of a birth, these aliens take the baby and put everyone in suspended animation. They bring in some alien woman, and they perform a marriage that is recognize by them (even though the baby doesn't consent). Suppose it is the case that everyone who thinks he is a bachelor has really be married to one of these aliens. Now we face a choice: we can say there are no bachelors (our original world, and claim it refers to no one) or we can say, meh, we count them as bachelors because those alien marriages aren't what we really mean (which would be a change in the definition of bachelor).

Quine thinks we get to revise our beliefs and definitions. It isnt' as if we are in touch with the meanings, and then claim nobody is a bachelor. We can preserve or change anything.



If you can't do conceptual analysis of one thing by another, for a lot of parts of philosophy, philosophy is dead.



You don't start with certain beliefs and build upon them. You test a whole theory against experience. Foundational pictures is replaced by a coherentist view.



He endorses skepticism at some level. The Humean predicament is the Human predicament.

Because the problem of skepticism arose within science (is that true?), it can be solved by science (is that true?).

Quine thought everything was science.





Our set of beliefs is a like a ship at sea. You can repair any part of the ship while it is at sea, but you can't get rid of the whole thing at once. Our big web of beliefs is like that.

pragmatic presuppositions of inquiry – Quine agrees to the boat as a pragmatist. Stroud is willing to sink the boat.



Take all the data of what we experience, there are always multiple possible theories which fit the data. We can always come up with some theory.



Suppose I said, look: it could be that all of what we perceive is fed to us by an evil demon (that's the skeptic's theory), but my theory (speaking for Quine) is that there are other alternatives. We don't have to believe those theories. We can operate within our pragmatic enterprise. ..

What about relativism? Don't we need s standard for alternatives? Ultimately, is Quine really a skeptic.

The skeptic endorses the idea that we are brains in vats (or whatever). But, that is not actually what the skeptic says. Actually, “we can't know that we are not...”. It doesn't rely upon any positive theory.



Quine says the skeptical worry arises from within science, and that we can we give answers from within science. We can give accounts from within science to beat the skeptical hypothesis. Stroud says, the realskeptical worries aren't like that. We can't answer them by having more experience. We can't respond to the dream argument just by investigating things internally. You can't answer the fundamental skeptical worries by presupposing they are wrong and from within science.



Quine has to give up on the underdetermination of the data. We need a maximally coherent view (the possibility). If he doesn't do that, then Quine's theory is stuck in some kind of skepticism. Needs nothing more than a construction, needs THE construction that best explains our sensations,etc.









Mentalist Internalist – justification must be comprised completely of mental states.

Initially forming mental states about a historical fact that I learn...I've forgotten my justification now, but as a mentalist, I can hold that the belief I now have is justified by a past mental state I had. The problem with mentalism is that most people who are internalists want to tie justification to epistemic responsibility. If you just refer to mental states you had long long ago, it is harder to tell that story. To say, “I hope I'm right about the Homestead Act was signed in 1862,” has a worry, I don't have access to the justification.

Standard access internalism is different. The main motivation is epistemic responsibility. How could you be responsible for something to which you don't have access?

The externalist, on the other hand, you don't have to access to your justification. The externalist has going for him the idea that animals and children often have knowledge. They don't have reflective beliefs, they don't have access to their justification, and yet we say they have knowledge.



Clairvoyant problem.

We might distinguish:

Knowing X

Knowing that I know X

Having the right to claim that I know X



Bergmann

Conditional answer: If Tom is in the right relations, then he knows X. But, we have to show the antecedent.

We might reply that we have an account of our reliability. But that justification seems circular...

Epistemic circularity: perception relies upon perception

Uncomfortable moving up a level: regress problem



He looks at several different ways of responding to skepticism.



Vogel

ontological simplicity, coherence (consistency) simplicity, or there is one underlying phenomena that explain many surface phenomena.



Not ad hoc (explain more than just the case at hand)

Should unify phenomena



We have oberservations, and the best explanation is what we want, and the best explanation should be simple.

THE RWH gives a richer and better explanation.

Explanations don't give us knowledge. Legit worry.



Why does the computer create a geometric world? Perhaps the computer is using the model of a real world to convince us...That could be an explanation. We might argue that the RWH is more complex than BIV...



I worry that explanationism might ultimately be unsatisfying to the skeptic because of its reliance upon a best explanation principle. The skeptic has such a high standard of justification that the best explanation principle just doesn’t cut it. The skeptic seeks more than mere justified belief, he seeks knowledge or even certainty, which is not what the ‘best explanation’ principle can provide. The best explanation principle might itself need justification.



Contextualism says epistemic standards vary not with situations of the subject, but the ascriber.

Subject contextualism can be found in every theory, it isn't really contextualism though.

Invariantism – epistemic standards don't vary from context to context



The word know” is indexical. The world “I” is indexical. The full semantic content varies with the context, it varies with the speaker. Full semantic content is indexed to the context.

Couldn't there be a way in which “know” is indexed to the subject's context that is more than trivial? Where trivialness has to do with the obvious, justification, reliability, or whatever.

Contextualism (SMI or Ascriber) – skeptical contexts are different from common sense contexts.

Coudl vary with how important something is; with what is mentioned; with what is thought in the context; whether you ought to believe something based upon how often such a thing occurs;

Can the SMI ascribe knowledge to others at all?

I don't know that 2+2=7,



Semantic blindness – we don't realize that 'know' is indexical.



Why does it matter how we 'ordinarily use' language? Can't we just be wrong about the matter?

Lewis' implicit quantification,





Nozick – (lacking the 4th condition here), and Dretske, externalist account that doesn't add the details of the mechanism. Nozick's sensitivity-

S believes P

P is true

if P were not true, S would not continue to believe that P



This is a counterfactual conditional.



Sensitivity

When it is asserted that you know something, you have to have sensititive knowledge. You have to be able torule out the possibilitythat P were not true???

in order for S to know P, he needs to know he isn't on LSD.





Sensitivity Criterion-

Pretend I have a coin in my hand, and I ask you what it is. You guess correctly it is a nickel. That isn't knowledge, it is based onluck.

If it had not been a nickel, you would have still said it was a nickel.



Pragmatic Encroachment, what we will bet one entering into our peistemic standards. McGrath – Knowledge inan uncertain world.



Grandmother example, relativizing to method.



We can't use the method for normal perception/knowledge in the world where we really are BIV.







Versions of skeptical solutions. Hume raises a problem (of induction), and he gives a skeptical solution. Raise the puzzle, and say, we ordinarily don't care about the puzzle.



Cornerstone propositions; Hinge propositions (wittgenstein); Framework propositions (carnap); candidates for synthetic a priori.

Pragmatically, methodologically, we have to assume we aren't mad, and that we can evaluate our own thought, etc. This Cartesian move is just fine.



Warrant-

entitlement – something else

justification – giving evidence



Ways in which you can be be entitled to a claimed without giving justification.



Cornerstones:external world, other minds, world is ancient, there are laws of nature



1. Strategic entitlement

Contextual, absolute

Acceptance
