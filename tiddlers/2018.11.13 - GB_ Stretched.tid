How's it going?

My daughter setup an EQ private server in VM for her CS class. We've not actually tested it out with a client yet, but we're slowly getting there (a thousand things to do).

Also setting up a WoW server.

Hey sorry. Been a hard week. A WoW server eh? Is there WoW emu now?

What made it hard?

Yeah, I think my daughter is most interested in playing WoW as well.

WoW's private server community, imho, is an outgrowth of EQ's (but, WoW in general is that).

Daughter has both running, but will be testing WoW first. Currently have the client running on linux, but haven't been able to get it working yet (she only gets to spend part of CS on this project though). We'll see.

Christmas presents will be turning their machines into gaming machines (or build separates). So, some of this may simplify further.
