title: 2017.02.05 - Letter to My Immediate Family

I live for you. You are the reason I exist, not just in a biological sense, but more fundamentally in an existential sense. You are the reason I grind, the reason I move forward, and the reason I would enslave myself. This is the part where I say, "I would die for you." I would. I seek to make us happy because I can't find anything else worth pursuing (I have searched the desert!). I want the people in my life that I love to be happy. I care about the happiness of others like ripples in a pond, like onion layers, in degrees, perhaps sets and orders, as deontic priorities. The decision procedure proceeds.

The rubber meets the road. The icky is here. I must prioritize. This is the programmatic priority. It is only practical.

While I might always be on the fence about my own life (it is still not obvious to me that my life, in itself, is worth living), I am clearly instrumental to the happiness of those I categorically cherish. I am laserbeam resolute in my devotion to my wife and children, and while I know I fail them and myself in numerous ways, I will be and do my best for them. I must be their tool to happiness, and I throw myself upon that task. It is mine. Give it to me!!!!!! They are my spark. They are my reason for living. I desire their happiness. I seek to enslave myself to their happiness because their happiness really is my happiness. That is a resounding commitment I make. They are my hope. This is existential grit.
