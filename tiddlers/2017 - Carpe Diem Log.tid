!! Audit:

* Wowsers, when I started this log, it was more explosive. It has slowly tapered off. This might be a bad thing. Generally, my logs work in the opposite direction. Did I find the apt equilibrium?
* I must spend more time being grateful and counting my blessings. I need to reframe my life, refactor my perceptions in the right way.
* I'm glad that my extended family come to visit us. It really is awesome. It shows they care too.
* It started as I was looking for a job last year. Interesting.
* Perhaps this is a place to talk about my failures and digest it appropriately.
* Why did I stop telling myself a story? Is it too much work?
* My children have come such a long way. I'm very proud of them.
* Whitelisting has been effective. I hope that I can help my children develop habits of self-control around the computer. It is not easy.
** It is an unfortunate drug. Like the pursuit of money, in a sense, it is necessary, but perhaps too easy to be consumed by it.
* I see that I spend non-trivial effort staying connected with people. It's important that I continue to go out of my way. In a sense, I don't predict others will do it (even if I expect they ought). 
* I spend a lot of time worrying about my vehicle, domicile, and finances. I hope this one day isn't a serious problem.
* I'm glad I've stopped spending time on video games for the most part.
* Carpe Diem is an interesting outlet to catch stuff that just doesn't belong in [[/b/]]. I fear I don't use it correctly anymore.  What has gone wrong?
* Once I started working (particularly the second job), I had less to say. I think I also had less energy to say anything. There are limits to what I can accomplish.
* Ah, those phones have been dead useful to us. I'm glad we got them.
** I am pleased to see that my children are not addicted to them, but that could be because they are growing up on their primary computers instead.
* Ha, I forgot I embedded an image in one. Some of this is obviously [[/b/]] and [[Link Log]] material. It's not that there can't be overlap, of course, but I prefer to have my data in one place. Redundancies make me queasy (I love transclusions though). 
* I'm so glad I was able to communicate with my family while I lived in Charlotte. Life is tough.
* Do I fail to take into account what my wife needs? I feel like I shape the course of our family more than she does, and that's not fair to her.
* I need to make sure that I spend more time in this wiki as my "chillaxing" than I do in other activities. In a sense, I'm still not taking this video game seriously enough. It is my obsession, and I need to act more like it.
* It's clear that I'm still developing the framework of the wiki itself through this log. Well, I'm glad that I write it down somewhere!
* Jesus, July was insane!
* I still have not paid back my father-in-law's $500 gift-loan. 
* I've been fighting for my sleep.
* It's clear that our family has learned how to cook and clean together better this year. I feel like our household is becoming more functional and balanced. I really appreciate everything my family has done. The adults worked their asses off, and the offspring stepped up to the plate.
* The Eastman job is where I really started to become quite brief in this log.
* My wife is paying for the chaos and stress in our lives with her health!
* In a sense, the Carpe Diem Log just is what other people do when they journal. Perhaps I'm going too light on it, I don't know.
* September felt like a month of getting used to drowning.
* I have learned my lesson: use drugs and be prepared at all times for a piss test.
* Reading through this, I am reminded that I fail to empathize with the mental unwell-being of others. That said, I would also argue I have fought for my sanity and being moral far harder than anyone else I know.
* Perhaps I should be faster to pull the DCK trigger.
* Our Family Meetings bound us together like cords that cannot be broken.
* I'm really proud of myself for planning for my family. I need to do it more. I'm afraid I'm not very good at it, and I'm pissed at everything I have lost and failed in so far, but that is no reason not to do my best.
* Hrmmm. the "How I usually do it" audit notation in 2017.09 is interesting. I can't tell if that is a good thing or not.
* I've really tried to make the most of my time when I stopped working for money. I have worked very hard. I don't think I've done it perfectly, but I have been making serious progress.
* Should I take notes about what JRE and I talk about? Sometimes we have crucial conversations that I feel like I've failed to capture and reflect on in a more formal manner.
* I'm so glad I got to see my family. Perhaps we should plan a camping weekend this spring for everyone.
* We haven't Informed the Jabba as of late, but it's so fucking cold!
* I can feel my joy and my pain in this log. 
* We've had a very hard time finding videos worth watching together as a family (and me in general). I think I've perhaps culled the majority of what I'm going to get. I will keep being picky and find other ways to spend my time.
* The vertical mouse has certainly grown on me. Even my desire to RSS sub video is largely gone. I binge and hit things on the fly, or I sit and veg in front of low-effort, low-risk, guaranteed drugs from shows I've watched many times.
* I like the ideas of the counts, but unfortunately, I think it takes up too much of my time for what I get. I would love to have a parser though. That would make life significantly better. Perhaps I just need to bite the bullet and learn to write good parsers and tool for tiddlywiki itself; to program its css/javascript/html more directly.
* I've definitely been very stressed. That's okay. It will fade in time. 
* I have been drinking a bit more often, although I'm glad to see I have control of it. I will continue to watch.
* I am really glad that we are purposely spending mealtime together more effectively. I hope to continue to improve this process.
* I have lectured my kids a great deal with a year, and in part. Advice, of course, is often more to me (or my past self) than to them in a sense; more charitably, I give them the best information I would give myself (empathy).
* We had a lot of family and friends time this year. More than we probably ever had in a way. I love it.
* I can see I'm slowly spiraling out. I need to actually do something again.
* I look through these, and life seems like an unstable blur. I'm feeling kind of disappointed and proud at the same time. I feel more anxious than anything when I see this.
