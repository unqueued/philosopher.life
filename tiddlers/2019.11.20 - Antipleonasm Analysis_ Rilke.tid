!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
What is necessary, after all, is only this: solitude, vast inner solitude. To walk inside yourself and meet no one for hours.

Necessary and sufficient for what, [[gfwiwcgws]]? Silence is quiet a teacher. It's easy to feel alone, but I am not convinced even solipsism is completely solitudinous. Conceptually, we are dialectically entangled with [[The Other]]. There is no escaping the privation built-into being [[fff]]. I walk in representations, and I meet versions of myself and the world. I agree that this mode is necessary, and I grant its necessity to fulfilling a kind of process theology. We are called to be more than ourselves.
