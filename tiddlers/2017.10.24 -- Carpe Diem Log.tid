* Woke up at 9
** I had a very hard time falling asleep. I was quite wired last night. I did get a lot of writing one though.
* Woke children up.
** Since my daughter has started her period, I want to give her extra sleep. Menstruating girls need more sleep, I believe.

* NCCER
* Books+Art
* Cleaning
* Shopping
* Mathematics
* D2
* We scrounged for dinner tonight (despite having a full fridge). Everyone seemed to be in the mood for it.
