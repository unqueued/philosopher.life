title: Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House

//A House Divided Cannot Stand.//

Why the fuck not, right? Let's read this gossip. Give me that dirt. The book doesn't paint a big picture I didn't already know, but it fills in the details. I'm almost desensitized at this point...almost. Reliving the publicly fucktarded year that was 2017 is not pleasant.

Shreds Bannon, to be expected. I've actually learned more about who he is. I hate to admit it, Bannon's beliefs (at least as depicted by Wolff) aren't always descriptively inaccurate (even if his prescriptions are insane). That we are in the midst of what appears to be a modern civil war has a kernel of truth to it. His hand-of-the-king approach seems to have made him the functioning president, as many thought.

Eviscerates everyone really. Cute one-liners too:

<<<
Anyone who had proximity to the president had leverage, the more proximity the more leverage.
<<<

<<<
The Trump administration, as a consequence of the Russia story, was involved in a high-stakes bureaucratic push-pull, with the president going outside government to find out what was happening in his own government.
<<<

<<<
Trump is less a person than a collection of terrible traits.

--Purportedly Gary Cohn
<<<

<<<
He liked the big picture—he liked literal big pictures.
<<<

<<<
When Trump got wound up about something, Bannon noted, someone was usually winding him up.
<<<

<<<
Trump simply could not abide the knowledge that somebody was getting a leg up at his expense. His was a zero-sum ecosystem. In the world of Trump, anything that he deemed of value either accrued to him or had been robbed from him.
<<<

Vocabulary:

* bête noire: something you really dislike

I'm glad I didn't have to do this. Not only would I not have the stomach, but I couldn't follow everything that was happening even if I could hold onto my sanity while doing so.

It is interesting to see the fragmentation of camps, handlers, and capitalist-survival-of-the-fittest meme injections into POTUS. Trump is a narcissistic child who is controlled by everyone but himself. Madking's New Clothes.

Hail to Rosenstein. Good job, homie.

Overall the piece is an important story hyped with rhetoric. This narrative style isn't my preference, and it doesn't fit my strengths. I'm sure people with more talent in these arenas will be able to make better sense of it in application. The weird part of the book is that it makes me feel all smug and schadenfreudean with them dopamine hits but also fuels that terrifying impending sense of doom.

I hope everyone reads the book.
