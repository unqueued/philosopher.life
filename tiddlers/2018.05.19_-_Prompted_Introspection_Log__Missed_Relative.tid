title: 2018.05.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: Missed Relative

!! Who is the one relative that I miss the most?

What does it mean to miss? Is it simply who I want to be in contact with the most, on average? Do communications over devices preclude such a thing? 

I miss being in person with my brothers.

I often miss my uncle [[Charlie]]. I miss that we don't have a deeper relationship. I think we could understand each other very deeply in a way that most would not be able to.
