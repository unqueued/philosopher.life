title: 2010.09.08 - Aristotle Book

```
Categories – pg. 3-17 
1 – pg 3 – Lines 1-15 – Aristotle describes synonyms, homonyms, and paronyms. 
    • Homonyms = Name in common, but different definitions attached to the word. Equivocal words. 
    • Synonyms= Shared being (e.g. man & ox are both ‘animals’). Perhaps Univocal words.
    • Paronym = Derivative words. E.g. Brave and Bravery, Grammarian from Grammar.
2 –pg 3 – Lines 16-19 – Speech can use simple structure (e.g “Man, Horse, Runs, Computer”), and these are never directly true of false, according to Aristotle. Speech with composition (in combination), such as “the man runs”, “pirates are better than ninjas”, etc., can be either true or false.
3 – pg 3 – Lines 20-10 –  The 4 forms of predication.
    • “said of” but not “said in” a subject – Describes or Predicates something as a whole, but not what comprises a thing. Answers the question, “What is it?”
    • “said in” but not “said of” – Comprises a subject, but does not predicate the whole of a subject. Importantly, cannot exist without a subject. Inherent accident or attribute.
    • “said of” and “said in” a subject – Not sure.
    • Neither “said of”, nor “said in” a subject –The examples are “individual” substances, perhaps. 
4 – pg 4 – Lines 25-10 – Simple, non-combination things, there are in 10 categories: Substance, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Place, Time, Position, Condition, Action, Affection. Truth and Falsehood are based upon a combination of two or more of these simple things from the categories.
Substance (ousia, essence or substance) – ontological theory about objecthood. Substance being different from its properties.
5 – pg 4 – Lines 13-19 – Neither “said of”, nor “said in” a subject. These are Individual or Particular things, also known as “primary substances”. Primary substances are the subjects of all other things. There is substance which can be predicated “of” but not “said in” a subject, and that is called “secondary substance”. While “Socrates” as an individual cannot predicate anything, “Man” can predicate “of” particular things, thus “Man” is a secondary substance.
6 – pg 5 – Primary substances (atomic concepts/things) are the basis of existence for all other things. “Man” cannot exist unless there is actually a particular individual man to which to point.
7 – pg 5 – The more informative a secondary substance can be about particular Primary substances, the closer it is to being a primary substance. There are “degrees” of substance, in this sense. “Man” is more informative than “animal” of “Socrates”, thus “Man” is closer to being a Primary substance than “animal”.
8 – pg 5 – The secondary substances, “of those things predicated”, are those things which “reveal” the Primary substances. Aristotle says that “runs” and “white” are not secondary substances, but “man” and “animals” are secondary substances. Importantly, as Primary Substance is to Secondary Substance, Secondary Substance is to all non-Primary and non-Secondary substances.
9 – pg 6 – “being in a subject” (the whole substance) is not the same as being its “parts”
10 – pg 7  - Substances cannot be more or less of themselves. An individual cannot be “less of” or “more of” a man than another individual. It is modular, either man or not man.
11 – pg 7 – Substances have the ability to “receive contraries”, and non-substances cannot do this. E.g. White cannot change to black, but a Man can change from cold to hot.
Quantity (poson, how much) – the extension of an object, magnitude
12 – pg 8 – Quantity is either discrete or continuous. Numbers and language are discreet (lacking overlap and connection), while lines, surfaces, bodies, and time are continuous because they have a common boundary at which they join together.
13 – pg 8 – Some quantities are comprised of parts with relational physical position and others not. Time, according to Aristotle, is not relative. Interesting take on science here.
14 – pg 9 – Quantities have no contrary.
15 – pg 10 – Quantities do not admit of a more or a less. You cannot be “more” or less” four-footed in height.
Relation (pros ti, toward something)
These seem Relational - Place (pou, where); Time (pote, when); Position, posture, attitude (keisthai, to lie)
16 – pg 10 – particular Y is more X than particular Z. Words like “of” and “than” can signify relatives.
17 – pg 11 – Contrariety and a “more and a less” is found or admitted in the “relatives”.
18 – pg 11 – Relatives have reciprocating subjects. 
19 – pg 12 – Excepting the relation itself, when you strip off all other attributes of two subjects which are related, it is clear given the relation, one subject entails the other. So, you cannot have a slave without a master and vv.
20 – pg 12 – While relationships cannot exist without both parts, they do not have to exist simultaneously always (they usually do, but not always). The example is that “knowable” is somehow prior to “knowledge”. 
Quality (poion, of what kind or quality) 
In my view, these are very quantifiable.
These seem Qualitative - State, condition (echein, to have or be); Affection (paschein, to suffer or undergo);
21 – pg 14 – States are stable and longlasting (like Virtue), while Conditions are more temporary. 
22 – pg 14 – While not exactly a State or Condition, “natural capacity” is another sort of quality.
23 – pg 15 – Affection is when one subject “affects” or modifies another subject.
24 – pg 15 – Some affections are not Qualities though, which is why it has its own category.
25 – pg 16 – Qualities are generally paronymous. E.g. Pale man from Paleness.
26 – pg 16-17 – Qualities usually have contrariety and admit of a “more and a less”. Shapes, however, do not admit “more and a less”. Rather, we say “similar” and “dissimilar” here.	
Action (poiein, to make or do)

Posterior Analytics – pg. 114-118
27 – pg 114 – This appears to be a form of rationalism. The idea that our minds have starting knowledge to try and make sense of other knowledge (although, not necessarily that we can deduce the world entirely a priori).
28 – pg 114 – This sounds like representationalism.
