What was alexandra daddario in that put her in your perfect 11 list?
FRI 5:01 PM
I want to cum in her eyes.
FRI 5:03 PM
Omg lol
FRI 5:03 PM
ROFL
FRI 5:03 PM
Gonna cry that is so funny
FRI 5:03 PM
I barely recognized her.
FRI 5:04 PM
Guess you saw her in true detective
FRI 5:04 PM
Call me plz, done at doc and it went straight to vm
FRI 5:20 PM
```

I called him up while he was in the doctor's office. He messaged me to call back after he got out. We talked and then I had to abruptly end the conversation since my wife wanted a walk (though, she was willing to walk while I talked on the phone with him [she loves me], I wanted to speak with her for every moment I could on the walk).

My brother and I talked about Rebecca freaking out about the remote possibility she might lose her most prized friend: her final cat Leelo(sp?). Leelo bit my brother, and my bother had to go to get a shot for it (was getting infected too, if I understand correctly). Turns out he filled out a form with the cat and address of owner (standard paperwork procedure), and this set off a bad reaction when Rebecca found out. She is clearly feeling hurt and vulnerable. Losing a foster son and one of her cats this month; it's been ridiculously tough on both my brother and Rebecca. My brother wasn't being unkind or irrational, and he attempted to help her (and confirm that it does not endanger her cat). He really loves her. I can see him making it work.

Am I listening closely enough? Look at the evidence, [[h0p3]]. Your brother is hurting. Is he bleeding out? Is he healing? Does he have [[hope]]? He is functioning; in fact, he feels more functional to me in the past couple months than the past year.

Hey, you want an invite to tildes.net?
FRI 7:25 PM
Made by a reddit dev.
FRI 7:29 PM
Might turn out to be good.
FRI 7:29 PM
What you up to tonight?
FRI 7:45 PM
Playin divinity
FRI 7:46 PM
Noice.
FRI 7:46 PM
How's that going?
FRI 7:46 PM
Is it still compelling on hard mode?
FRI 7:46 PM
Arm is sore from tetanus shot
FRI 7:47 PM
Ah
FRI 7:47 PM
You'll have to masturbate through the pain. I know you have to two-hand that giant 10-inch penis of yours.
FRI 7:47 PM
Eh, the crafting system mod is pretty broken, or something.  Even on hard mode im doing stuff way better
FRI 7:47 PM
Ah
FRI 7:48 PM
What's different?
FRI 7:48 PM
Im fat as fuck now
FRI 7:48 PM
It hides like 4 inches of it, I realize
FRI 7:48 PM
So i have to reach into my fat to find the tip and coax it out for pee pee time
FRI 7:48 PM
lol
FRI 7:48 PM
Eh, an items damage scales with its item, so the same item looted at different points in the game do different damage
FRI 7:50 PM
how does it scale?
FRI 7:50 PM
(I'm sorry, I probably misunderstood)
FRI 7:50 PM
This mod lets you level up an old item to your current level, so you can focus on bonuses and stats instead of the weapons damage
FRI 7:51 PM
ah
FRI 7:51 PM
are these 3rd party mods? Have you considered making  your own if it is even reasonably possible?
FRI 7:51 PM
So if i found a cool sword with useful procs at 5, by 10 its damage would be underpowered compared to your new enemies
FRI 7:51 PM
Also, is there PvP in this game?
FRI 7:52 PM
but, you can level that biatch up and make it feel lvl 10
FRI 7:52 PM
so, any uber item per slot stays uber forever
FRI 7:52 PM
I have a hard time arguing against that actually.
FRI 7:52 PM
I wish more games did that.
FRI 7:52 PM
I love when a low level item is still good at high level.
FRI 7:53 PM
It feels like I'm not wasting my time or something.
FRI 7:53 PM
Yeah
FRI 7:54 PM
My build might work much better with certain procs, so upgrades are nice
FRI 7:54 PM
Proc builds are satisfying
FRI 7:56 PM
harnessing the randomness to do your bidding
FRI 7:56 PM
Well...
FRI 7:56 PM
Nah, im actually using a bugged ability (from original game) that makes procs happen every hit for certain abilities
FRI 7:57 PM
Even more satisfying.
FRI 7:57 PM
Knowing the ins and outs and limits of the game. Abusing the mechanics are far as youc an.
FRI 7:57 PM
Supposed to make those abilities proc despite enemies armor
FRI 7:57 PM
This is a dumb question: have you completed the game all the way through?
FRI 7:58 PM
But makes them proc every hit
FRI 7:58 PM
Nah lol
FRI 7:58 PM
I know last time you were so OP you went out of order and it didn't matter in a way.
FRI 7:58 PM
Goin slow as hell
FRI 7:58 PM
Not playin very often
FRI 7:58 PM
Spending too much time trying to find new crafting items to try out
