Noice.
TUE 10:54 AM
Btw, do you need more audiobooks?

Not right now. I have cherished the audio books you have already provided and I have yet to finish.
TUE 11:11 AM
If I was a pitcher in baseball. I would always be the opener. Never the closwr
TUE 11:11 AM
If I'm lucky, 1 in 10 of my projects work out.
TUE 11:12 AM
I like my job. It has deadlines.
TUE 11:12 AM
I am much more productive in that setting. Or if I can complete a project in a single afternoon.
TUE 11:13 AM
Oh. BTW. Recently relapsed on kratom. Winning!
TUE 11:13 AM
Hahah.
TUE 11:13 AM
Lol. I'm sorry, dude.
TUE 11:13 AM
Difficult to break it.
TUE 11:14 AM
I'm not upset. I was drinking alot more. I was depressed, sad, and unmotivated.
TUE 11:14 AM
When taking kratom I am the opposite.
TUE 11:14 AM
I am energetic, talkative, not depressed, not anxious.... If I can limit my doses to smaller amounts and take consistant breaks during the week.
TUE 11:16 AM
I don't see the problem. I went crazy and it stopped working. Then while lying in bed I decided to stop cold turkey.
TUE 11:16 AM
So all I had was WDs and an unoccupied mind.
TUE 11:17 AM
My Valium is a far more sinister and addictive substance and I take it weekly, without any problem of withdrawal. And never on a workdad night.
TUE 11:18 AM
Most anything is better for me than drinking to be honest.
TUE 11:19 AM
Aye. Agree. Wish cannabis was available to you. I need more weed. I made an ounce last 3 years, lol. I'm about to run out.
TUE 11:20 AM
I have a good connection in Berea.
TUE 11:27 AM
If you need it. My wife smokes occasionally and drinks on occasion.
TUE 11:27 AM
I always keep it on hand. Just in case.
TUE 11:28 AM
I may take you up on that sometime. I travel out there to see my brother once in a while.
TUE 11:31 AM
Just let me know in advance. And how much $ you wanna spend. His quality is top notch. He just supplements his own habit. So it's not a sketchy thing. He is a longtime friend and Berea College graduate.
TUE 11:33 AM
His mom lives in Somerset. I've had him bring it by the house b4! Lol.
