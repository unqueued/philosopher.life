!! Audit:

* Pure [[Saint Chomsky]] again. I should do this for [[Saint Marx]].
* I can tell [[Saint Chomsky]] is not a philosopher of law. He has exposure, but there are some moves here which aren't careful enough. I think he might hate metaphysics as much as he hates Continentals.
* I wish I saw everyone engaging in this practice on the web. I don't mean saying things which are popular (though that is going to happen, obviously), but rather accountably wrestling with a serious philosophical (and especially political) thought each day.
** My wife says that is simply too much work even for her.
* I have little interest in discussing cannabis.
* I was inspired to create [[pleft]] and [[pright]]. Yay!
* I think I did a marginally better job of having something relevant to say this month. 
* That Stoic question is a good one!
* [[Kicks]] has me talking about mousetraps. =)
* I use the word //sheeple// unironically. Cringe away!
* I am unsavory. I'm grateful that I am not silenced all the way down though.
