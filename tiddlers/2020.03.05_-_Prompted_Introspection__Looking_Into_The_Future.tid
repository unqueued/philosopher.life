title: 2020.03.05 - Prompted Introspection: Looking Into The Future

!! What do you think your life will be like ten years from now?

I still agree with what I've got in: [[2018.05.04 - Prompted Introspection Log: Decade From Now]]. I also recognize that I may not even be alive by then. 

I hope a decade from now, my offspring will have made it through college (but, you never know). I wouldn't be surprised if I were mostly walking, talking, and being on my computer while my brain disintegrates. I think my wife will still be healthy and enjoying her vocation. I assume I'll have friendships that run deep and some that don't. It's going to be weird to speak with what may be [[JRE]]'s 10yo child. 

I'm terrible at predicting. Lol.
