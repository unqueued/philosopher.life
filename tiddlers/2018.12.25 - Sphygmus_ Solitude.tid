Same to you!! :)

Also, correction: I crocheted* -- It wasn't knitting.
DEC 25, 2018 11:17 AM
Oh! That's very different :joy:
DEC 25, 2018 11:17 AM
Yes, no doubt!
DEC 25, 2018 11:18 AM
I'm impressed you crocheted gloves! That's something more traditionally knitted. :)
DEC 25, 2018 11:19 AM
Yeah, it was fun to make 'em. I don't understand the purpose of fingerless gloves (except for work), but they are cool.

Started in on //The Solitude of Prime Numbers//

Fingerless gloves cam be nice for typing - my hands get so cold on the computer - but they get in the way of using a mouse (for me) which is unfortunate because that's the hand that always freezes

I saw!

man I'm fucking jealous you're playing/training magic with your kids; I assume that sort of practice young teaches dealing with going on tilt -- and I tilt SOO hard ugh
DEC 25, 2018 6:52 PM
That is a good point. It could help with that. Right now, I don't think they feel like they even have much of a chance of winning, so the tilting isn't so bad. When I'm coaching, that's when I see it.

You play Magic?
DEC 25, 2018 8:25 PM
I don't play magic, but my boyfriend has at a competitive level and we've been playing Ashes, which is a living strategic card game, and whoo boy he stomps me pretttty much every time we play and I get //super// tilted XP

I love those kinds of games - ascension, dominion being what I've played the most - and I feel like I'm on that edge of knowing there's a level of competitive/optimal play but I don't have the skill/time investment/practice to be able to play at that level
DEC 25, 2018 9:22 PM
So getting stomped feels //extra// bad ahaha
DEC 25, 2018 9:22 PM
I tilt the hardest when it wasn't up to me at all or I've made a huge mistake that I should have known better about that will likely cost me the game.
DEC 25, 2018 9:26 PM
I'm googling Ashes
DEC 25, 2018 9:26 PM
I have played Dominion, but not Ascension.
DEC 25, 2018 9:26 PM
It takes so much effort to learn games sometimes. I've hit a point where I'm weary of even trying (especially if it will suck me in).
