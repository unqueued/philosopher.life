title: 2019.09.03 - Afterschool Teaching: Computers

On the way, I received a message from Sonya (who enlisted help of a coworker this time) that she couldn't open my file because it was corrupt. I looked at her screenshot. That is not what Adobe Acrobat is for. I have a great deal of [[hope]] for [[Humanity]] after seeing two people in charge of a thousand teachers who can't Google their way out of a paperbag. I told Whitney about it. She laughed and said she had the same thing happen when sending her transcript to the woman. I need to print them up now. She told Matt about it, and he also laughed.

When I arrived, Delp pulled me into the office. He wanted me to set up a bunch of iPads (because we're not allowed to use any of the laptops in the school now) and administer a parental survey. I asked him to e-mail me the link to the survey. He claimed not to have my e-mail (uh, yeah you do), so he handed me his phone to punch it in. He said he sent it to me. From the looks of it, he sent it to Sonya, not me, lol. I asked for it again, and then he looked miffed. Look, I'm barely competent with computers, but this is insane. 

I wish my capitalist bosses (indeed, that is how they make money) would invest themselves into something not evil. Learning to putz around on the computer would be a great start.

One-on-ones went well. Lots of homework today. I annoyed my students as usual. 5TB continues to flash psychopathy; 6NP claims to be his cousin (but I can't trust either of these children). 5TB's affectation and disregard for everyone is disturbing; he's the killer of my group, but he still respects enough boundaries for now to get by. 

I had only a few minutes with 5th and 6th in the library. The older kids complained I didn't get to take them, which was nice for me but rude at the same time. I tried to teach magic to 5CM and 5Dm, but we ran out of time. Welp, next time.

I had to take my children with me to the cafeteria until Whitney decided to take them. I handled parents. There were no huge surprises. 

7G is coming out of her shell more. She's wonderfully annoying, voraciously curious, and she aims to be moral. Spitting image, I swear.

5AN is glued to me. She got up in my face to talk many times, and she was nervous (even said it). Cool. We thought about anxiety and responses to it. We both talked about the computer lab. I am so lucky to have a dozen children who know they //need// the computer lab like I do.

7L and his brother stayed to work on their magic decks and talk about motorcycles with me. 

I spoke with 5Em's mother with two other chillun (a newborn too). She had a ~2yo who was snappy AF; you go girl (all I could see was my daughter). I poured out my praise for raising children who read. I told her she put me to shame. My public son might not read material as difficult as my own, but he's excited and he tries. Kid has 5 assorted books in his locker. It's interesting to see a geek who hides it so well, but his social skills are there.

5CM had a cube. We worked on basic intuitions for the cross. I hope she'll run with it.

We stayed late. Someone upgraded the office computer to W10 and stripped out Dropbox (not my installation). Delp was worried. I'm glad I made a copy. He was panicking, understandably.

I had the chance to shoot the shit with [[gh057]] for a bit. He's gonna cook some moonshine soon. Sounds amazing. We talked about beaches as well. He couldn't go last June, but this November will be a break for him (and, clearly, the man deserve way more time off than he gets). I hope it is paradise for him.
