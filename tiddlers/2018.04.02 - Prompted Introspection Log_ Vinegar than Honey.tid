title: 2018.04.02 - Prompted Introspection Log: Vinegar than Honey

!! What do we mean when we say, "You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar"?

I've always found this an odd saying. I've never wanted to catch flies. I associate flies with death, rotting, putrid, awful things. It's why I don't like them near my food. Although, on a paradoxical-appearing side note, if they were carefully farmed, I would love to eat fried flies with soy sauce. Bug-zappers are far more fun and effective.

I often despise this saying when it is used in common contexts. I want to malaphorize it to make fun of it. I'm just not witty enough to come up with one that I like (you're lucky I'm too stupid to make fun of you!).

Insofar as this is concerned with heaping hot coals, turning the other cheek, neutralizing your enemies, etc. I can appreciate it. Insofar as it maximizes utility in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, I appreciate it. Let us not be fooled, however, this is //rhetoric//.

I'm a philosopher. I smite thee, demon. As with all things rhetorical, and hence manipulative, we must be concerned with using people as mere means. Rhetoric requires justification. I've grown to see that expressing anything to others, however, even the truth, requires justification. Thus, I am more relaxed in my ultra-vigilance. Yet, I remain extremely weary of it, and with good //reason//.
