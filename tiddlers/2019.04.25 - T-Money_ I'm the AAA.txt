THU 10:00 PM
Cool.
THU 10:00 PM
Gave the stay strong for your mom pep talk to the kiddo.
THU 10:00 PM
Then I went and go alcohol. Lol
THU 10:01 PM
rofl. =)
THU 10:01 PM
Got
THU 10:01 PM
I've seen soany animals die. Both on the farm, and getting hit by cars, or what have you. Tortured my fair share as well. I am No Saint. But my heart is much softer now.
THU 10:02 PM
So many
THU 10:02 PM
I have exposed my kid to catching and cleaning fish, to slaughtering chickens. (just the butchering part not the killing. But pets are different.
THU 10:04 PM
Aye.
THU 10:04 PM
Not trying to bring your night down. Moving on.
THU 10:04 PM
Thanks for listening.
THU 10:04 PM
So my buddy has been listening to AI death metal.
THU 10:05 PM
Not bringing it down. Just thinking with ya.
THU 10:05 PM
AI death metal.
THU 10:05 PM
Link please.
THU 10:05 PM
And he says they are badass and getting better day by day.
THU 10:05 PM
Then he perpetuated the same. Paranoid robot AI intrusion. You have spoke of.
THU 10:06 PM
Aye. That's crazy. Don't worry about it.

I remember the original. The meme is hilarious.
THU 10:10 PM
Mechanically I don't see the ability to create. I suppose at an exponential rate they could be build. But the requirement of raw material. The precious metals needed for computer chips. The fuel or batteries needed to maintain.
THU 10:13 PM
I can't see it.
THU 10:13 PM
It's okay that you can't see it. You aren't very good with computers. You also need to stop confusing Robots with AI.
THU 10:14 PM
Fair enough.
THU 10:16 PM
I have been chipping away at Petersons book. And I am biased.
THU 10:16 PM
How goes it?
THU 10:16 PM
I can't not be. He isn't speaking to me or my generation.
THU 10:17 PM
Or more specifically me. He encourages responsibility, goals, pushing yourself.
THU 10:17 PM
I suppose to many millenials there is a void of responsibility. But fuck. Man. I've climbed corporate ladders and walked away proud. I've graduated from two colleges. The second with a 4.0. I am and have been a provider.
THU 10:19 PM
He's talking to limp wristes hipsters.
THU 10:19 PM
Meh. I'll try to get at least half way thru.
THU 10:20 PM
But I am jaded.
THU 10:20 PM
Sadly my step father gave the the book. And I'm. Underlining and noting all of his failures as a man and  as a father throughout.
THU 10:21 PM
Kinda humorous.
THU 10:21 PM
Forgive. My longwindedness. I'm drinking. You do you at will. Pay no mind.
THU 10:22 PM
I'm wrestling with why you think that is his demographic. Perhaps there is a difference between the intended demographic and the actual.
THU 10:23 PM
Well. Maybe I wanted a shit ton of his lectures on YouTube.
THU 10:24 PM
And the specifically states as such.
THU 10:24 PM
He*
THU 10:24 PM
I also resent the fact you say I'm. Not good with computers. I'm. Not. But nobody wants to be there ld. Their dumb.
THU 10:25 PM
Be told*
THU 10:25 PM
Lol (I harbor no hard feelings) just a minute shock.
THU 10:26 PM
Worth looking into his demographics more.
THU 10:29 PM
I also didn't say you were dumb at all.
THU 10:29 PM
So, you say the book is not written to you. That's fine. Do you agree or disagree with the book, and why?
THU 10:34 PM
Good question. I agree with the book, to an extent. (that extent is an unknown because I am still reading it)
THU 10:38 PM
I am afraid I began with an attempted unbias.
THU 10:38 PM
But after immediately identifying the hipocracy in my unemployed stepfather intent to me... I am inspired by the letters to your parents.
THU 10:40 PM
I don't find this healthy.
THU 10:40 PM
But it is true.
THU 10:40 PM
An unemployed, liar, pathetic man gives me a self help book.
THU 10:41 PM
After all that I have accomplished in spite of his actions.
THU 10:41 PM
(there in lies the truth, not with Peterson. But with my stepfather.)
THU 10:42 PM
Thank you for the opportunity to explore the reality.
THU 10:42 PM
I don't know the conditions under which he gave it to you. Do you think he was preaching to you with the book? I can imagine cases in which it's just a reading recommendation.
THU 10:43 PM
You have many of the hallmarks of a Peterson disciple to me, btw.
THU 10:43 PM
Have you read the book in a day and now waiting on me?
THU 10:44 PM
Lol
THU 10:44 PM
Nope. But, I have been following his cult for a couple years now.
THU 10:45 PM
i remember reading plato and aristotole at age 12. i had to use a dictonary for almost every other word.
THU 10:48 PM
it was still gibberish to me.
THU 10:48 PM
my step fathers college books
THU 10:48 PM
has enough credit hours to a  PHD or MD and doenst even have a bachlors
THU 10:49 PM
meh. we moved from from a dead dog to my shit step father.
THU 10:50 PM
i apologize.
THU 10:50 PM
i feel as if i often use you to unburden myself with problems
THU 10:50 PM
i apologize for that
THU 10:50 PM
it was never my intent
THU 10:50 PM
(few people care, even fewer relate
THU 10:50 PM
(even fewer are empathetic
THU 10:51 PM
again. my apologise
THU 10:51 PM
dont wrestle, im not worth it. intuition i appriciate.
THU 10:54 PM
I see that you use me as a sounding board. As long as you legitimately wrestle with what I have to say, I don't have a problem with it. We all need someone to actively listen to us. Sounds like you have more think about and digest.
THU 10:55 PM
to be honest I like most men are captured.
THU 10:56 PM
expected to perform at leves that exceed our ablity
THU 10:56 PM
and to STFU about it
THU 10:56 PM
we are products of the old school.
THU 10:56 PM
the stuff it down, the push it down, the deal with it.
THU 10:57 PM
ignorance is bliss. and im afraid, i dont know alot of smart people.
THU 10:57 PM
i gravitate to rationality. which is an amazing attribute that you posses
THU 10:58 PM
despite the harships it may cause
THU 10:58 PM
it is your burden and your blessing.
THU 10:58 PM
and i may be at faut for digging into that. but it makes my sincerity for you, your family, and my open heart and ears no less geniune to you
THU 10:59 PM
i reiterate that as not an empty value
THU 10:59 PM
One thing I like about you, T-Money, is that you aren't existentially complete (like everyone), but you god damn well know it. I'm trying to help you fill that hole (which isn't to say I've succeeded myself). I think listening to each other goes a long way.
THU 11:03 PM
ill be honest. i dont think you have all the answers.
THU 11:04 PM
but i think you have SOME
THU 11:04 PM
and that is how i have gotten this far.
THU 11:04 PM
learing bits and pieces from anyone who is willing to teach me.
THU 11:05 PM
that is how i became a mechanic.
THU 11:05 PM
I don't think you've taken the risk of going down my path yet.
THU 11:05 PM
i never will be able to abandon everything i have been taught to see your path.
THU 11:06 PM
I agree that you probably won't.
THU 11:07 PM
i peek thru the blinds. i want to know. but there is so much conditioning, i do not think i can break thru.
THU 11:07 PM
my daughter asked why everything couldnt be free
THU 11:08 PM
i had to educate her on  incentives.
THU 11:08 PM
non centeralized goverment.
THU 11:08 PM
she even asked why the goverment couldnt just demand us to do
THU 11:09 PM
the childs mind is so loving, so gentle, so free
THU 11:09 PM
"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
THU 11:10 PM
i carefully chose my words. to convince her that capitolism was the best vehicle for success
THU 11:10 PM
I think  you should teach her Jesus' words instead.
THU 11:10 PM
my child is not saved, i read her that exact passage when questioned
THU 11:10 PM
about being saved.
THU 11:10 PM
among others
THU 11:10 PM
Jesus was a socialist, homie.
THU 11:11 PM
Through and through.
THU 11:11 PM
i know that
THU 11:11 PM
but we live in a world of free will and sin
THU 11:11 PM
So did Jesus.
THU 11:12 PM
but he performed miracles so believers could believe
THU 11:12 PM
we are expected to believe on faith and faith alone
THU 11:12 PM
show me miracles. i will bow. show me a sermon from a bible school baptis and i will scoff
THU 11:13 PM
He was socialist even without his miracles. His message to us is not about his miracles.
THU 11:13 PM
do you think his success would have existed without the miracles?
THU 11:14 PM
It's why I know you aren't a Christian, bud. You don't actually even try live up to Jesus' sermons.
THU 11:14 PM
honestly?
THU 11:14 PM
His success in The Great Human Conversation rests upon people claiming he performed miracles.
THU 11:14 PM
I don't believe he performed a single miracle at all.
THU 11:14 PM
"Faith without works is dead."
THU 11:15 PM
Salvation isn't the point. Building heaven on earth, following the two greatest commandments, and the golden rule...that's basically it.
THU 11:15 PM
[[h0p3]]
THU 11:16 PM
That's me.
THU 11:16 PM
Asshole Among Assholes
THU 11:16 PM
i try to leave each day. without taking my own life. by being a good father, by being a decent husband. but being honest with my brethren (you, my close friends, my few neighbors)
THU 11:17 PM
"lord knows i try"
THU 11:17 PM
and if i fail to live up to any damn thing it is my own fault. i blame no one.
THU 11:18 PM
i am my own worst enemy
THU 11:18 PM
but in a fucked up course of events... i was made this way. and "i never asked to be born"
THU 11:18 PM
ridicule me as you wish, i have no shame in my actions.
THU 11:19 PM
Everyone thinks they are right. Everyone thinks they are the hero of their own stories. Everyone thinks they try. I agree you are your enemy in this case. I think you have freewill to not sin (as you have already implied obtains in the world)...I think you really can choose to be someone else.
THU 11:19 PM
you know less than i tell and i hide more than i should.
THU 11:19 PM
That may be true.
THU 11:19 PM
I definitely don't know everything.
THU 11:20 PM
I don't know what you should or shouldn't hide.
THU 11:20 PM
but dont attack me on my failed christian beliefs or efforts
THU 11:20 PM
Why? Don't lie to me about being a Christian.
THU 11:21 PM
i claim to be nothing more than a POS
THU 11:21 PM
your pushing shit on me. that you wish your push on others.
THU 11:21 PM
Reason.
THU 11:22 PM
I hold everyone to that standard, not just you.
THU 11:22 PM
but your tact is lacking this evening
THU 11:22 PM
i question why
THU 11:22 PM
what is it that i prevoked?
THU 11:23 PM
What is tact?
THU 11:23 PM
what is the comment about your letters to your parents?\
THU 11:23 PM
what is tact?
THU 11:23 PM
tact is when your approach a discussion and destroy your opponet without being an asshat
THU 11:24 PM
you sir have always lacked that ability. but i have admired your massive ballsack in attacking that which you disagree with
THU 11:25 PM
Lol. Yeah, I lack tact. I am an asshat (those exact words: https://philosopher.life/#Why%20You%20Might%20Hate%20Me)
THU 11:25 PM
lol
THU 11:25 PM
I do try to convince without destroying though.
THU 11:25 PM
do you?
THU 11:25 PM
Aye. I escalate.
THU 11:25 PM
do you delicatly handle [[h0p3]] kilcoyn the same ?
THU 11:26 PM
the sad fragile soul?
THU 11:26 PM
i see thru your arrogance and see the same sad confused man I see in the mirror (not the the excact, but a reflection disturbed in water)
THU 11:27 PM
I don't know how delicate I am. I attempt to provide reason itself. I'm encouraging too.
THU 11:27 PM
I'm just as broken, no doubt.
THU 11:27 PM
your lack of tact has gotten you in difficult situations.
THU 11:27 PM
It has. It's true.
THU 11:28 PM
and i witnessed it. first hand.
THU 11:28 PM
not only aganist me, i smile.
THU 11:28 PM
but aganist professors, people, true attempts at reaching were twarted by your absense of compassion in the phrases you used
THU 11:29 PM
(i spin this only cause i have no argument aganist your claims) but i like to see you defend yourself
THU 11:29 PM
Our group was fairly low empathy. I agree there wasn't much room for compassion in it. I think you will find compassion elsewhere in my dealings with people. I am also compassionate with you at times.
THU 11:29 PM
I know. =)
THU 11:29 PM
Get it out, son.
THU 11:30 PM
i love the fucking shit out of you
THU 11:30 PM
faggot
THU 11:30 PM
Lol
THU 11:30 PM
thats all i got
THU 11:30 PM
Some days, that's all I've got too. I hear ya.
THU 11:30 PM
i told you when you left berea that you were the most influential person in my life i have eve rmet.
THU 11:30 PM
i might have been drunk
THU 11:31 PM
but no less true
THU 11:31 PM
you smiled.
THU 11:31 PM
you arrogant shit.
THU 11:31 PM
rofl, it's true. My God, the arrogance I have had. It's absurd.
THU 11:31 PM
i suffer the same.
THU 11:31 PM
i am the most arrogant person in my workplace.
THU 11:32 PM
i get picked on alot by very witty guys and their attempts at "out gaying me"
THU 11:32 PM
lol
THU 11:33 PM
I'm sure you must be an interesting and difficult man for them as well.
THU 11:34 PM
You might be one of the only men who have two degrees among your co-workers.
THU 11:35 PM
But, you remain quiet and fly under the radar now with them. I often am forced to do the same.
THU 11:35 PM
i do.
THU 11:35 PM
You know the guy I get along with the best at work right now? The Janitor. That dude is a gem.
THU 11:36 PM
i am often remined that despite my degrees they dont have any and we are making the same money
THU 11:36 PM
I've been there. Pretty annoying.
THU 11:36 PM
i shortly remind them that if they value their life by the money they get paid per hour, that have completely missed the point of life.
THU 11:37 PM
it will shut up an audience.
THU 11:37 PM
thats tact
THU 11:37 PM
That lacks tact, sir.
THU 11:37 PM
Lol
THU 11:37 PM
[[h0p3]]
THU 11:37 PM
hahahaha
THU 11:37 PM
fuck you. moving on
THU 11:37 PM
rofl
THU 11:37 PM
its all about the smile on your face when you say it, and the laugh afterwards.
THU 11:38 PM
as you return to the "same work they do"\
THU 11:38 PM
Well, I'm glad you love them enough to tell them the truth with a smile on your face, with just the right timing, and spr'ankle of grace.
THU 11:40 PM
i fucking hate them
THU 11:40 PM
its all about appearances
THU 11:40 PM
i have no choice but to work with this ignorant asshats
THU 11:41 PM
Preach.
THU 11:41 PM
My 5th graders are the bane of my existence.
THU 11:41 PM
Except a few, I guess.
THU 11:41 PM
i have looked deeply into trying to change jobs
THU 11:42 PM
i almost went to a walmart distribtuion center job fair today
THU 11:42 PM
Probably still worth your time from the sounds of it. Maybe that desktop will tie you over until you find the next move.
THU 11:42 PM
even printed out my resume
THU 11:42 PM
Hawt.
THU 11:42 PM
id rather support killing radial terrorist than walmart
THU 11:43 PM
WOAH!
THU 11:43 PM
lol
THU 11:43 PM
Lol.
THU 11:44 PM
I think if the goal is to be moral, you quit your job today.
THU 11:44 PM
If you are asking what I think is prudent rather than moral, well...the desk job sounds prudent to me.
THU 11:44 PM
Go easy on you body.
THU 11:44 PM
i have NEVER been moral.
THU 11:44 PM
Slowly find a way out of that trap.
THU 11:44 PM
NOT ONCE??!?!?
THU 11:44 PM
i have been driven by greed
THU 11:44 PM
my entirelife
THU 11:45 PM
Pftt.
THU 11:45 PM
Now you aren't even trying to be honest. Of course you have been moral in your life before.
THU 11:45 PM
indeed. i have. but most of my decisions have been based on money
THU 11:46 PM
im a fucking economist
THU 11:46 PM
I am shocked.
THU 11:46 PM
what would you expect
THU 11:46 PM
[[[h0p3]]....fuck you...learn2tact]
THU 11:46 PM
(just helpin' a brother out)
THU 11:47 PM

THU 11:47 PM
I adore that about you.
THU 11:47 PM

THU 11:49 PM
they wanted me to over see repair and overhaul as well as production of the biggest aviation share of wheels an brakes in the wold.
THU 11:49 PM
i regret that i was fucking good at it.
THU 11:49 PM
and that my heart kept me from doing it
THU 11:49 PM
Blasted heart. Who needs it?
THU 11:50 PM
i was tired of telling grown men that they couldnt go to their kids little leage game cause a board of directors want more money.
THU 11:50 PM
Preach.
THU 11:50 PM
and many many other cases similiar
THU 11:50 PM
when i left they asked how much to keep me. (no one, not even the guys on the floor, knew the specs, the product, the end result like me) i fucking built that place. literally was the first hourly hired.
THU 11:51 PM
i told them they didnt have enough money
THU 11:52 PM
3 months later my HR who cried when i left, left herself, and following two other managers withing 6 months.
THU 11:52 PM
