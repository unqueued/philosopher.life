You have created this account eight years ago and this is your only activity. I'm proud of you for predicting this moment and fulfilling your prophecy.

XD. I am a crazy person. It's true.

My plebbit karma is a demonstration otherwise though. I use this: https://github.com/x89/Shreddit.

<<<
I didn't know of Shreddit. Must be good to destroy evidence.
<<<

To my eyes, the goal is to give context to the evidence of who we are with autonomy. I see our digital identities as being commodified, surveilled, and fragmented. Reddit is where lots of conversations happen (which is why I'm here), but I'm not convinced Condé Nast (as with many others) has our best interests at heart.

I think that the sale of user data is almost inevitable on sites like Reddit, as there are almost no ads placed anywhere. But I am uncertain if Shreddit would prevent the selling and monitoring of data. But maybe I am wrong.
<<<

Yes, I agree. Certainty cannot be achieved here (only confidence), and absolute prevention is infeasible. Once you send them your data, it is possible for them to maintain it (even against court orders). Likewise, there's a sea of scraping on Reddit, and we have minimal power to fight it. The admins have said they don't keep the deltas of modified posts nor the deleted content (shreddit does both). They could be lying, and, of course, that could change on Reddit's end (it evolved over time on FB too). Until then, current and historical use of shreddit still does something.

Shreddit is ghetto, like https://trackmenot.io/. Like you, I also don't see this tool as a solution, but rather making sure I'm not low-hanging fruit. This is a monkeywrench used in an arms race. If the vast majority of Redditors used it, I'm sure Condé Nast would escalate. Prevention requires using a different platform entirely and users who would use tools to protect themselves and each other (which I support). This isn't bullet-proof, but it is bullet-resistant.

<<<
Well-put. So well-put that I could barely understand it as a non-native speaker. But I agree to the portions that I could understand. What happened on Facebook broke my trust in the popular social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter (I never really used it anyways, so I am not too affected), but I agree that we have the responsibility to prevent something like that.

I think I'll spend some time tonight and get rid of some of my history.
