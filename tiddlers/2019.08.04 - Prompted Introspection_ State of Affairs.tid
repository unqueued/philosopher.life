!! What do you think the world will be like in 10 years? Twenty? Fifty?

From a [[ridtyawtr]] perspective, it's obvious to me the world could possibly be radically different. Pragmatic socialism and progression toward the ever-evolving communist's goalposts of Heaven on Earth is possible. There are adjacent possible worlds which branch further into it. I'm convinced of it. I'm betting my life on it. 

Predictions, however, appear to grow narrower for me. Alright, now I need to put a bitcoin bet on the line to demonstrate my superior Bayesian rationality. I'll give you only my 2 cents here rather than the sock of nickels I use to blackjack you to death with. 

I predict the Tragedy of the Commons will not be handled. No, we can do something about this beast: we have freewill, but a sufficient percentage of us have to do it. I do not predict our cooperation even though I know it is possible. I predict power will continue to centralize, the Rand-Locke memeplex will continue to infect us, protecting the assets and futures of the wealthy will be the primary goal, and the control over the masses will be even further automated. As far I can tell, we've never left World War II for realsies.
