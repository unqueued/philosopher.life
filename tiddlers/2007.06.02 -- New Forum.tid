title: 2007.06.02 -- New Forum

In light of recent concerns, I've created a forum. The forum will be open for several topics (although, I truly doubt it will be significant to very many people). The initial purpose of the forum is to give us a place to discuss whatever the topic may be. For now, I'm interested in being able to post and discuss while at work. I realize that my family in Thailand have difficulty talking, and frankly, I don't like email. Forums are a cleancut way to DISCUSS. Forums &gt; Email. I hope our family will use it.

The first forum will be devoted towards the Summa Theologica.

To reach the forum, look in the top right hand corner. You'll see &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Forums&quot;. Just click on the &quot;Forums&quot; button, and you'll be redirected to forums.hypercynic.com.

Pic, yay!
