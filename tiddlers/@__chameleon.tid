No, [[Root User]]; I don't. It may be worth your time. That's up to you. I'm happy to have had even your instant messaging acknowledgement.

> (on Derrida) We didn't end up talking about it.

I have no money for books right now, sadly. I would read my pdfs, but... reading books on a monitor is unpleasant. I'd rather send them to an ereader or something, but idk if it'd work with my kindle (I've barely used the thing).

>     Not so interested in piracy. I'm surprised. She probably has plenty of methods of access to everything she wants.

Oh I'm totally into piracy, lol. I'm just pretty good when it comes to sources (I use libgen for books, and various public trackers for music, movies, etc). The reason I'm not into private trackers is because of the elitist community (you have to take a fucking exam to get into some of them) and the fetishism around ratios (I can almost never get a good ratio, because I only go on private trackers for obscure shit, and can't afford to seed 24/7).

I'm sorry if I seem a bit aloof about some conversation topics. I'm trying to I guess, invite you to say the first word on the topic? Maybe I'm just really bad at communicating :) Don't take my silence on something as boredom or dislike of the topic. If I don't want to talk about something, I'll be clear on it - like you with saying "that's evil" I am not shy about saying "that's boring" or "that makes me uncomfortable" `^^`

>     I wonder if she will ever surface again to go public.

I imagine I will, eventually. The KF thread in mind is so shit it'll eventually get locked (it's already just a drama channel for waifuists, and the most active guy there is a huge a-log) and then I can move back into public without worrying about being a source of ridicule.

>     I'm doing a shit job of VCing with her. 

I think the fault is mine as much as yours :) My schedule is weird and hard to work around. Sorry about that.

Also: yes make an edh deck!

>     I should ask her about a bunch of sources for anime memes.

They're common enough in group chats/discord servers. I get mine from there, and I also have a huge stash from my chan days.

>    I wonder if she would be interested in meeting K and L. Weebweb.

Always ;) Of course, us waifuists are considered weird even among weebs, so I hope I wouldn't weird them out too much `^^`

>     I thought she would like that philosopher more. Seems to have plenty in common.

Stupidly, I haven't been reading her. The website is actually too wide for my laptop, so I can't read it comfortably (reader mode isn't available for it, either).

I've not got that background in heavy leftist theory (yet). My theory knowledge is mostly limited to turn-of-the-century anarchists, and later the primmies/post-left.

This might be a topic we can think about together if you are interested. There are strong reasons we should favor destroying IP as it exists in Western legal systems altogether, but I appreciate how the GPL (which continues to evolve) abuses and turns a legal system that supports capitalism against itself.

I agree, and would be interested. One concern I have is that even desktops and laptops have largely become mere FIT-machines (can reduce so much down to even 10 platforms) in practice. Phones may be part of that process in a significant way too. Least common denominator drives which platforms will be centralized upon.

I got pretty lucky... I played my buddy Robert, who uses a black/blue milling type deck which is very weak to the deck I play; and I also played a younger kid who had to cobble his mono-red deck together because half the deck he walked in with was illegal. Those matches I went 2-0, and in the other two of four I went 1-1 and 0-2. A big reason I'm building a new deck is because that deck, while good, relies heavily on good draws and sharp play. It's like playing `1. e4 c5` as black in chess.

[[Liberal|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.11.07%20-%20*shakes%20fist*%20liberals]] is one of them really hard words to define. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the variations of Maoism I've seen, but I'm not sure the lines make sense to me either (e.g. I'm not convinced there's a meaningful difference between factory workers and farmer-peasants). I'm convinced the Rule of Law can be peeled apart from dictatorial totalitarianism (though perhaps that's uncharitable). To some [[dok]], I admire the fervor and willingness to sacrifice, admission of the necessity of violence, the vigilant appreciation for neverending class struggle, and the pursuit of unification of what I take to be Maoism. As a political program applied in the world, I consider it a failure (though that is typical of any system I've seen applied) since it still centralized political [[power]]. It never escaped capitalism in my eyes.

My opinion is likely irrelevant, as usual, =). I don't know what [[ratification|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Emigration%20Checklist]] looks like for you, and I'm sure you are ridiculously busy.

Plenty of people won't give a shit about your piece of paper, especially given your experience (though there are plenty who don't care about experience but focus way more on the interview and networking process itself), but if you think it would be difficult to ratify this once you are in the states, I think you should do it now.

When I'm wrong about what matters, you should call me out! While I have the political right, I do not have the moral right to say just anything. I'm grateful you would take the time to say something and to hold me accountable; it is [[The Golden Rule]]. I appreciate your desire to help me express the truth in a palatable way. Unfortunately, what I have to say eventually becomes unpalatable to most everyone in the end. Are you sure you aren't unjustifiably tone-policing me? Are you sure you aren't pointing to rhetoric rather than substance here? Despite how little I quickly say in that one bullet-point, there is more to see in this wiki. It's not clear to me you have taken the time to evaluate my sentence in my context with sufficient charity. I think we have just a misunderstanding here.

If it makes you feel any better, these were her words. I also don't think it's absurd because it's true. Unless it's necessary, I'm not here to quibble over the locution, connotation, and conversational implicature (as an autist [even this is shorthand, right?], that would be an endless task for me with everyone I meet and read). Tell me the significant semantic content that differs if you think I'm wrong. I think it's reasonable to cut me some slack in this case.

For irrational and immoral reasons, Whitney doesn't want to work with or be around this woman who is married to a transexual person (and, yes, the details are morally arbitrary in this case). I am taking her to task, and I suspect I will have to defend my new co-worker. To be clear, when Whitney signaled for this outgrouping with her disgust about this gossip, I corrected her with a: "cool, that's wonderful," knowing full well that turns me into an untouchable with her and anyone she tells (certainly my boss, as I have seen). She chose not to wrestle much further with me on the topic though.

You are correct that I owe the entire rainbow a great deal. I think I know something about this solidarity you speak of, and I cede very little ground when it comes to morality. I have the opportunity to defend, explain, and justify the moral rights of persons all the time with the people I teach, including those who have [[power]] over me. Yes, I regularly intervene and listen to my youth on these topics. However imperfectly, I'm actually fighting in the trenches here; I'm paying the price in my mission. I aim to follow [[The Moral Law]] all the way down, as you know (which is hardly to say I'm succeeding). Does this ease your conscience some?

; 2019.08.25 - [[@h0p3|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#%40%3A%20h0p3]]

In your wiki review - 2019.08.23 - Wiki Review: Bacon is Delicious - you mentioned that Whitney was "married to a trans". My approximate reaction. That's a really strange way of putting it. A trans woman (mtf) or a trans man (ftm)?

Ever since meeting Nobu (a trans woman) I've been wary of phrasing like this, it leads down some sketchy avenues. I'm very enthusiastic about LGBT rights, being a pansexual woman myself, and from my perspective solidarity across the entire rainbow is indispensible; cede a centimeter, and social conservatives will take a kilometer.

IDK, this isn't a callout post, it's your wiki and you can write what you want (and even if I didn't say that I doubt I could stop you from doing so, lol). Just my conscience demanding I say something, really.

* The cooler that comes with the Ryzen is loud, imho, but I've not slapped my hyper212 on it (maybe I should).
* One of the reasons I didn't go with that SSD is because it is QLC. We've had 2 SSDs die on us in our household, so I'm worried about it (perhaps irrationally). Nvme has not disappointed me! 
* I assume you will be gaming or doing GPGPU with that beast! You might consider a cheap GPU for passthrough.
* If price matters:
** You might consider dropping to a 3600/3600X.
*** Single-threading is still king to me, but you may make far more use of those cores than I would.
** When was the last time you used an optical drive? I still had a floppy drive 2 builds ago, and my last build, [[monster-10]] still has an optical. Might not be worth it; I simply don't know. If you've used one in the past year, then I think should you should keep it.
* I know some people think 32GB of RAM is too much, but they are wrong. I think this machine will last for a long time.
* Call me shallow, but I want to see the case too! =)

No, doubt, the wiki is a [[mind-amplifier|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.07.30%20-%20Loper%20OS]]. It's a fuckton of work, imho, but it allows one to autonomously generate feedback loops, abstractions, and relationships in the stories we tell ourselves like no other tool I've used before. Tools which help you communicate better with yourself (iteratively improving or growing representations) may often be amazing [[communications devices|http://www.loper-os.org/?p=568]] as well.
