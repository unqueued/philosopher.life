title: 2019.09.17 - TDL: Shop

* You need to shop. You could probably make it one more day, but I think everyone wants more fruits and veggies.
* Hey, check in with [[GB]]. Sounds like he could use a friend knocking on the door.
* That you have anything in [[The Beautiful]] is weird and wonderful. Just leave it a pile of shit whenever you want. Entire careers are spent answering it wrong.
* Keep grinding along with all your chillun. Be a useful man to them.
