I do not want anyone to get close to me, I do not want anyone to see me, and this is the way things have developed: no one gets close and no one sees me.

Why should you live in a world without feeling its weight?
<<<

<<<
As your perspective of the world increases not only is the pain it inflicts on you less but also its meaning. Understanding the world requires you to take a certain distance from it.

I’m not interested in the words or the meaning of the words. I’m interested in disappearing in it completely, to not be aware of yourself at all. That’s the way music works for me. It’s purely emotional. It goes straight to the heart. There are no explanations. That’s just it.

I enjoy the phenomenological analysis here. I can't say the philosophical work is correct.

Meteorology of the mind. This part is terrifying to me. I am, ofc, a tyrant of a father in many respects. I expect (though I do not predict) their best.

Does he really not want to be close to anyone?

I appreciate the "I can't remember" sequence quite a bit. 

The phenomenology of parenting is dead-on. His writing tends to be plain. I like that. The worry about meaning issue is different for us, but I see he's on the money all too often.

So far, this is an easy going to story. It's visceral, easy to read, and appears honest. 

Unfortunately, I'm not learning about how to do I'm doing in the wiki any better. [[Infinite Jest]] was far more pertinent, I think.
