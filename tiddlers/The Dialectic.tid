title: The Dialectic

//Unified trinities of harmonic oscillation.//

Being and Nothing are sublated by Becoming. [[The Right]] and [[The Beautiful]] are sublated by [[The Good]]. 

So...

Subject and object are sublated by? Part and whole are sublated by? Truth and absurdity are sublated by? Necessity and contingency is sublated by?

I have no idea how these are related.

There is an "ought be" and "ought not be" (two kinds, from what I can tell). Hegel buys you the "is" necessary for the "oughts."
