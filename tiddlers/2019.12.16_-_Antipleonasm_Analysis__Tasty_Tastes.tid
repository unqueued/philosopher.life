title: 2019.12.16 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Tasty Tastes

!! Respond to the following gem:

: There is no disputing about tastes. There is no accounting for taste.

There is disputing about tastes; we're doing it right now. QED. Whether or not we ought to dispute about tastes is another matter. If it is correct that there is no accounting for taste, then I don't know what it means to say anything about tastes (including your sentences). 
There are sufficient reasons for our tastes, but providing a complete and coherent account is not practically possible for us. Partial accounts can be still justified and meaningful though.<<ref "s">>

There are tastes which appear almost universal after tasting. Who can't possibly appreciate that sublime experience which seems outside of time, outside of words, that perfect moment where everything stands still, a blinding glimpse of existential satisfaction, a unifying egodeath, the world's silent yet deafening whisper? Dat shit is zen, yo. But, there is still disputation about this, and even simply offering particular accounts are hard problems (let alone generalization). 

Qualia, pure subjectivity, and the what it is like to be that particular, cannot be effectively disputed about to some [[dok]] by definition. There's something irreducible about perspective, at least for us. That we are experiencing, at least in the moment, cannot be disputed (though the correspondence can obviously be doubted).

Alright, now let's get to ~~disputing~~ talking about what you meant to mean. Prima facie, all else being equal, in a vacuum, one ought not dispute about differences in tastes. That would be stupid, or so I feel. Except, new tastes arise out of the dialectics of tastes too. More importantly, [[SO]] tastes give rise to something normative beyond taste as well, and we ought attempt to reason about the consequences and relationships between our tastes.
