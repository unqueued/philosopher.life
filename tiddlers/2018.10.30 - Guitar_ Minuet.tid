title: 2018.10.30 - Guitar: Minuet

We made time to practice today. My son did some chord work, my daughter continues on her piece, and then my son and I played through Minuet in G. We're playing louder and with a bit more confidence. My son could feel the difference for not having practiced. I think we sounded pretty decent. It's coming together. My son is following the sheet music more effectively and jumping in. I'm glad to see it.
