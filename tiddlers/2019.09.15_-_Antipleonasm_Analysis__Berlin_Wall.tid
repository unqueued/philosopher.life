title: 2019.09.15 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Berlin Wall

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The walls which are now being thrown up all around the world are not of the same nature as the Berlin Wall, the icon of the Cold War. Today's walls appear not to belong to the same notion, since the same well often serves multiple functions: as a defence against terrorism, illegal immigrants or smuggling, as a cover for colonial land-grabbing, etc.

I'm simply unqualified to define what the Berlin Wall really means and how it affected the world. Its fall formed some of my earliest memories of politics as a child. I don't see why the Berlin Wall didn't or wasn't meant to serve these functions though. I'm also convinced those who taught me what this wall symbolized cannot be trusted. I must be reading this quote out of context because the mistake seems so profound that I don't think you would make it. I do not know what I am missing. Breaking one of my own preferences/rules here.

It's from //Lenin 2017: Remembering, Repeating, and Working Through//. I'm fine with saying transnationals are (and have long been rather) a fundamental sublational threat to national sovereignties (I suspect I'm more paranoic in this respect). The only option is an international democratic sovereignty. The odds are beyond slim, but that is our only meaningful option. [[TPK]] or bust. This is part of the reason the workers must own the means of communication production so profoundly, including the internet, as it is the only method by which any such voting process could arise.

You nail plenty of the outer argument. I still have no idea what I should take up this inner argument. It's out of place to me.
