What you up to today?

Grabbing some wings, then off to see if i can get my drill battery charger replaced, then cleaning up my basement
5 HR AGO
That sounds delicious and productive.
5 HR AGO
I'm excited to see  your bench.
5 HR AGO
Once i got it out of the package i wasnt pleasantly surprised.  Might use some angle iron to stiff it up underneath, we shall see 
5 HR AGO
Ah. Well, it will be your starter bench to give you the chance to build the one to rule them all.
5 HR AGO
Exactly my hope
5 HR AGO
Hrm. Is there any good software for woodworking and this kind of stuff?

Pos workbench, missing one essential piece lol
1 HR AGO
I'm an insanely envious, lol. That is amazing. I know it's shit to you, but I think it's awesome.

The little black pegs on the top of the vise... should be 4, can only find 3
1 HR AGO
You are bootstrapping.
1 HR AGO
Sorry, shouldnt sound so ungrateful
1 HR AGO
No, you don't sound ungrateful. I'd be pissed too.
1 HR AGO
Im glad i have it, should make some tasks much easier

I'm about to give up on Black-wolf-3 as we have it. The CPU upgrade worked, but the BIOS upgrade has not given me what the motherboard spec says I should have, a RAM slot appears to have died. Good knews, we still have that pimp GPU. I'm going to get a barebones instead to recover what we can. He will have it. I've just failed on this particular attempt (like my cyrix godtower)

Phoenix is online and the best computer in the house by a mile. She's dual-booting, still working on passthrough.
1 HR AGO
Your workshop reminds me of my computing infrastructure so much.
1 HR AGO
I'm working to make sure the kids have done the installation work. It's a learning opportunity they will rarely have.
1 HR AGO
Oh, [[1uxb0x]] is almost finished with his MUD in Python. I think he wants you to play it.
1 HR AGO
How much would you need for his computer to be as good as hers?
1 HR AGO
We will have enough. You have already given me too much. I'm not sure yet. I'm still hunting.
1 HR AGO
We already have the SSD and GPU set. Mobo, CPU, and case is probably where I'm going to go. Gonna attempt to snipe a barebones since we already have most of what we want. Most of the cost of the gaming machine is in the GPU, which I know works (since it is identical to [[j3d1h]]'s, we've swapped them out to test).
1 HR AGO
Tell the kids they should look into Cemu to emulate the wiiu, having a lot of fub with zelda, and if i can get it running on windows, im sure with their skill they can get it to run on linux
1 HR AGO
Fun
1 HR AGO
I guess once i knew it was possible to emulate that particular zelda, i was motivated to wade through a lot of troubleshooting, they probably don't have that same nostalgia to motivate them
1 HR AGO
Oh, well, the goal is to run Windows (though [[j3d1h]] has a strong preference for passthrough we're working toward here). [[1uxb0x]] already has a pretty sweet laptop for Linux (no GPU though). [[1uxb0x]]'s machine will be dedicated Windows. They will love it.
1 HR AGO
No, they certainly don't.
1 HR AGO
Neither have dived as deep as we have into addictive gaming. This will be a valuable use of our time. They need someone who can pull them out of the water to help them see the value in what they are doing.
1 HR AGO
Obviously, it can be an amazing storytelling tool. I'm grateful they have the chance.
