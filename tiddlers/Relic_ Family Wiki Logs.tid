title: Relic: Family Wiki Logs

This relic demonstrates so clearly how little I understand about what I'm doing in life and in this wiki, but I think it also reveals how seriously I take the lives of the people I love. This relic represents a shift in family dynamics and goals; it greatly enhanced and accuratized my models of my family members, but also seeded [[Find The Others]]. 

When I first realized what the wiki really meant to me, what it did for us, and what I [[hope]]d to create, I immediately begged my family to join me. In fact, I've been begging all of my closest family to join me in this process to varying [[dok]] of success. This was my ignorant attempt to help my family and to teach us (especially myself) what personal wikis were meant to be.

Through these mediums, my family has come to understand each other so much better. We still have forever to go, and I'm grateful to have the opportunity. It's been a journey!
