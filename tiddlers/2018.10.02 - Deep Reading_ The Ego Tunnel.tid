title: 2018.10.02 - Deep Reading: The Ego Tunnel

It's depressing to have basically nothing to say about this amazing fucking book. I listen while I do my grocery shopping. I'm just plain excited as fuck by this book.

The signaling outside of lucid dreaming is hilarious. I never even considered that possibility. I'm still unsure of how valuable lucid dreaming will be to understanding consciousness. It's not nothing, but it's not obviously going to bust it wide open to me.

The interview was dandy. Love to see Dennett thrown under the bus, yet again. We are lucky to have Dennett, a fierce man.

Lacking compatibilist intuitions makes this book extra tough. Even the empathy section becomes problematic (though, it is an outstanding section!).
