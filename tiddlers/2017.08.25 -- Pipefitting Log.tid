title: 2017.08.25 -- Pipefitting Log

On the way to work, we saw a 30 foot flame shooting out of a vertical pipe into the air: Mordor indeed!

Chris and I talked about the automation of pipefitting. For the better part of a year, I believed this was infeasible, and I've had that thought confirmed for me at every turn and by everyone. But, people are wrong, and I didn't know enough to make that judgment (although, we must make judgments with the information we have, it is our plight).

I have just understood that fab shops will become more and more automated. The part of pipefitting I seem to like the most I believe will become automated. They are already doing it, although it is bit by bit. Take our spools. I can see the lines where orbital welders made perfect welds. No human did that, although a human set it up. This is just the beginning. I am convinced now, unfortunately, that manufacturing many spools will be largely automated in the foreseeable future. I have mixed feelings about this.

Imagine a warehouse, a computer with isometrics, robot hands, and the right machine-learned out-of-order manufacturing process. You could cut out the labor and guarantee a kind of quality that humans simply can't put forth. Even if you had to design new fittings and methodologies to make it cleaner and easier to automate, it would still be worth it.


Chris, for the umnpteenth time has recommended PLCs. He says I should quit what I'm doing right now to do it. He says I'd love it and be amazing at it. He gave me his teacher's name, Dale Hudson. He told me about Dale's line of work. I may look into it. My brother has recommended this to me before as well.

I could program the computers which automate pipefitting. Perhaps that is what I should do. I had considered it for valves, but now I'm not so convinced that I will have access the training I need for valves. 

It took forever to get through the gate. They are having a serious problem with the security badges. This actually sucks since it detracts from the amount of pre-work time I have to write in peace. I ended up just busting out hte computer in the middle of the van to get something done while we waited. 

Time to work!

I cut carpet to line some iron so that we can slide some massive pipe without any paint damage (or worse). I helped (barely) move some trunion support pieces. I was very excited when I saw the caps, since I thought I'd be making some 18"-on-30" saddles. I'm out of practice, and we were just talking about making them. Chris-M was excited to have me do it. Unfortunately, after I retrieved my stuff, we took the caps off and saw the saddles were already fabbed. Sucks! The work I wanted to do, the work I was trained to do, we didn't get to do. 

Industrial fitters are the ones making the good money, but they also aren't doing what I really, really loved about pipefitting. They are doing something between rigging and pipefitting, or, well, I don't know what to call it. 

Afterwards, I helped Roland (foreman of riggers) adjust the pieces, since we had his son place them (unbeknownst to us) in a bad spot.

Break!

I ended up not doing the carpet thing, since an ironworker was told to it. Instead, Chris-M and I started setting up for the trunion support installation. I did the marking around the pipes, finding the highest point and lowest point, dropping center lines, and marking where the saddle fitup would occur. 

The rigging crew brought our supports over. This addressed a worry a brought up with Chris-M. I was not convinced we could get a 90 degree saddle all the way around off the ground, although he said it fine. Later, he changed his mind, and decided we would actually mount the top piece to the large piece and then the bottom saddle underneath to correct for the problem I was worried.

Roland told me that we can use his hotwork permit only for prep, but it doesn't cover welding. This is a serious problem, since it takes forever to get permits here. I immediately went to tell Dave, who had been planning on doing the later in the afternoon.

More grinding. We stopped since the firewatch didn't want to wait for lunch, and I decided to help her out (otherwise, she is stuck waiting for half an hour).

Lunch!

We finished the grind on the giant vertical piece (which eventually will be demoed out during the shutdown). We moved our pieces into place. The bevel from the fab shop was some kind of nightmare. I made better grinds on my first try, I shit you not. I got it to my welder's and journeyman's liking (honestly, I cleaned up my journeyman's work on it too). QC blondgirl, Tanya, came by. She liked my work (likely a dyke from what I can tell, but I ain't picky ;P). We had to move some conduit out of the way. I let my journeyman do the high-up work (I did not volunteer for that shit), but I made it as easy and safe for him as I could.

My hands and arms are sore from all the grinding. I'm used to doing a significant amount in the shop, but not "in-position" grinds. Most of the time, I am able to continually reorient pipe and myself to gain leverage and the best position against the disk. Not out here, no sir. You're just plain fucked sometimes. It's okay. I got it done.

Break!

Looked up PLC classes at Northeast State. Classes start on Monday. I think this is worth my time. 

We didn't do much besides cleaning up. Our general foreman just basically gave us busy work from what we can all tell. Even his work was underwhelming. He just smooth talks the entire time. It's kind of gross.

We left. Chris said he'd still give me rides. I think I'm annoying him at this point.
