!! About:

//I dedicate this page to my [[monsters|Monster-Î¦]]; without you, I'd truly be lost. Now, HMB while I virtue signal about my hyperreading.//

<<<
The matrix has its roots in primitive arcade games...in early graphics programs and military experimentation with cranial jacks... Cyberspace.  A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts...  A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system.  Unthinkable complexity.  Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data.  Like city lights, receding...

For better or worse, digital //pharmakeia// is a fundamental force in my life. This habit has profoundly shaped and defined me. I've lived a stupid amount of my life on my computer, and that has afforded me a staggering array of cyber experiences and digital practices (not that I have much to show for it). While I have definitely slowed down, and perhaps even lost my magic touch, I am still a force to be reckoned with. Here I quite imperfectly document my practices of hyper-reading the web and scouring the internet. I suggest you pay attention, deshi.

I think I'm an exceptional content aggregator.<<ref "1">> Relevance is conceptually bound to contexts, and including the usual postmodern problematics, I fear you will not be able to stand in my shoes. Thus, with grief, anger, and loneliness, I concede that few are able to appreciate the narrative in these sequences that I do.<<ref 2">> Of course, I sound arrogant, and I mean no offense. Long-term, habitual drug-users may become biased connoisseurs of a sort, developing consumption rituals, refined systematic palates, and impeccable tastes for their drugs of choice. Consider it an act of big-balled Aristotelian magnanimity if you must; I'm accepting all challengers in this dialectic. 

Essentially, my reality map is not always easy to appreciate; most digital natives simply haven't habituated the digital sixth sense I have. I was an internet addict long before even using the internet on a weekly basis was socially acceptable (at least where I grew up). I'm an autistic savant with at least 50,000 hours spent on his computer (generally the interwebs) by the age of 30.<<ref "3">> I do not exaggerate when I tell you that I've some non-trivial virtues of the practice of using this drug.<<ref "4">> Through addictive habituation, I've deeply embedded this practice into my [[fastmind]].

In cyberspace, I've been around the block, traveled there and back again, and forgotten more than you might ever see or know. You may never have the chance to explore the dead roads I've been down or experience //The Stack// exponentially grow as I have. Nobody can see or understand it all, but some see and understand far more than others. I am an expert witness of this network. I'm what you might call //well-read// in this domain. Here I feel somewhat like a gatekeeper because I am a grandmaster, sad as it may seem.<<ref "5">> I'm an internet guardian, protecting the sacred grounds from intruders.<<ref "6">> I'm a nomadic survivor in the digital desert. I'm a scholar who came from the bottom (3rd world education) up who doesn't play the academic game anymore, and now I think of myself as just a plain philosopher searching the giant experience machine we call //The Internet//. I'm still a low-class user just like you, but with more time, talent, experience, and willpower (or lack thereof) on his hands. 

Surely, you must fall on your knees before this delusional man-child internet addict. You are so very welcome to the fruits of my labor in my daily digital grind. With my insane integrity and virtuous perception, I pick out many morally salient features of this network on a daily basis. Come, partake with me. Take a hit.

Just as I do for the rest of reality, I am always sifting through the sands of the internet for [[Diamonds]] and [[Redpills]]. Even when you become adept at tuning your signal-to-noise ratio up as high as it will go in a constantly evolving landscape, most of what you find is still bullshit.<<ref "7">> You're happy to have seen many things, but they usually have a single-use appeal to them. Some links are worth keeping though, and some moreso than others. Furthermore, it's important to document your information sources, your consumption habits, to analyze the data you feed your mind, and to be more reflective about the inferences you draw from and about this never-ending flood of data. I might understand about half of what I read, and that's okay. I have to keep exploring my epistemic periphery. In crucial respects, the internet is my looking glass for the rest of world; it's a heuristical tool for exploring and observing the hyperobject we call reality.

Since I'm trying to centralize my data and maintain control of it, I've migrated my bookmarking and curation practices to the wiki instead.<<ref "8">>  I am still looking for a better way to categorize and think about my links. One day, I hope to have the tools to mine this information for insight. May this be an epic annotated bibliography of the self-selected works from my primary channel of information consumption.

!! Principles:

* In general, the goal is to create annotated links as both a long-term stream-of-conscious index and a bibliography of what I'm consuming.
** Attempt to say at least something about the link. Sometimes you can't or won't, and that's okay too. Just do your best. However, if you can find a link that belongs somewhere, grow that place.

* Organize, analyze, and compute links in lists of Archetypal comments
** When you can't fit a link into your archetypes, think about why, develop new ones and revise old ones.

* Try not to hold links hostage in your browser. Browsers must be reset each day if possible. If you have to dump it, then do so (and don't feel bad about it).

* Start categorizing those links are more useful than others.

I memorized the URL, IP, or even how I got to a location. I didn't realize it would be worth cataloging. Even the bookmarks I had were lost because I didn't take the time to transfer/sync them to my new machines. Much progress has been lost because it wasn't recorded. Although, even those things which I didn't bookmark ultimately played into how I thought about and used the internet (and perhaps life in general).">>
