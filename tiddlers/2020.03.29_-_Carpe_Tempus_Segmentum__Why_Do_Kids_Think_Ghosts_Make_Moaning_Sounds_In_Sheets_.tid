title: 2020.03.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Why Do Kids Think Ghosts Make Moaning Sounds In Sheets?

* Bloody paw prints on our floor
** Ranga seems fine. We don't know what happened, guessing a cat-fight against one of the ferals in our neighborhood.
* Spoons
* [[Morning Routine]]
* [[Family Time]]!
** Discussion of prepping...=/
** Ah, and [[MWF]] complained about "honoring thy father and mother" with a flex that he's taking care of his dad.
*** lmao. First, [[AA]] is the one who really does that year-round. Second, he knows he's not allowed to preach to my offspring. 
**** I'm glad my offspring are old enough to reason about it.
** One-on-ones
*** My son sees so far sometimes. It's absurd.
**** Up and down one for him. We tried to see how much we could remember.
*** My daughter had a solid week. 
**** We thought about the clock she's on with her teacher (if she chooses).
** I despise that Caplan is a talking point.
*** Still, never forgetti Biden's talking point: "Poor kids are just as smart as white kids."
* Inform the Men!
** After, she fell asleep on top of me. Pure snuggle.
* Meditation
* Shower of the Gods!
* [[Family Log]]
** Not so fun going through the [[TTP]]s, but that's okay.
*** We did have fun picking out topics though.
* Wife and I made pizza, potstickers, and the veggie tray was made the night before.
* [[AA]] called me accidentally.
** Neat. We talked about how life was going for her and her family.
** [[UJ]] is making sure kids are getting fed through his school. Noice.
** Talked Chicken-shop.
* Dinner was delicious
** Cards Against Humanity
*** My offspring are hilarious. Their goal was to guess which one was mine to make sure I didn't win, lol!
*** My wife closed her eyes, and I swapped a couple cards to play them for her black card. `/giggle`
** We need to get those potstickers again, if they will be available.
* Read our wikis
** Smooth, fun, arguments, giggles, and disgust (with mine).
* Hugs for all
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 2
