title: 2018.09.07 - Prompted Introspection: Common Colors

!! What are some colors you see the most in your every day life?

I am colorblind. This has been a valuable tool for opening me up to the world of epistemology and philosophy of mind. I have no idea! That's the kind of thing I'd need to record and test. This is a topic I talk about often with my children. Blindness and vision are always profound metaphors.

I feel like I see a lot of black, but that's because whatever is on my screen is in dark-mode (with rare exceptions). I tend to be up late into the night as well. 

I suggest yellow is the most common color. It tints everything. The gorgeous, blinding sun shines into my living room. Also, I like bright colors against black backgrounds.
