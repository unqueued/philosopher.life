title: Adult Children of Alcoholics

My parents see themselves and their family through this lens. While they do not take the time to understand my point of view (and maybe they literally can't), I will try to understand theirs.  

The Laundry List:

* We became isolated and afraid of people and authority figures.
* We became approval seekers and lost our identity in the process.
* We are frightened by angry people and any personal criticism.
* We either become alcoholics, marry them or both, or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic to fulfill our sick abandonment needs.
* We live life from the viewpoint of victims and we are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship relationships.
* We have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility and it is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves; this enables us not to look too closely at our own faults, etc.
* We get guilt feelings when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others.
* We became addicted to excitement.
* We confuse love and pity and tend to "love" people we can "pity" and "rescue."
* We have "stuffed" our feelings from our traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings because it hurts so much (Denial).
* We judge ourselves harshly and have a very low sense of self-esteem.
* We are dependent personalities who are terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings, which we received from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us.
* Alcoholism is a family disease; and we became para-alcoholics and took on the characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink.
* Para-alcoholics are reactors rather than actors.

ACOA principles are so generalized that strict and blind adherence to its hypothesis is equivalent to falling for scams like fortune cookies, psychics, and cold reading. Indeed, my brother [[JRE]] was right about this. Science does not support ACOA, at least not yet.<<ref "1">> Essentially, everyone feels these ways to some extent (some more than others). Perhaps most people in pain or those who come from dysfunctional families (and who doesn't, to some extent?) can find themselves, to varying degrees, on this list.

What does that tell us? Why can we all identify with it? It seems unlikely that it is all wrong. That so many of us feel connected to this laundry list should not be thrown away. I take this list to be specific enough (however general it may be) that we should worry about it. What is it about this list which describes the human condition? This list is compelling, and we need to find the cause of its intuitive appeal. 

I believe I've cracked the ACOA code: the concept of [[empathy|Empathy]] is the key to unlocking this laundry list. People who have systematically experienced a lack of empathy are going to find themselves on this list in various ways. Perhaps that seems reductionist (admittedly, that's what I do in my pattern recognition, and I am often wrong). Think carefully about the list, and be charitable in your interpretation here (don't straw man, instead steel man). 

Let's tackle the list and see why empathy explains it better than alcoholism.

* We became isolated and afraid of people and authority figures.

Why would we be afraid of people and authority? Because they don't empathize with us enough. Because they don't treat us with respect. They don't recognize our human dignity in important ways. When people don't empathize enough with us, they are prone to hurt us, deceive us, extract capital from us, use us, and treat us as mere means; when they //otherise// us, treat us as objects, aliens, or enemies; when they lack hospitality and kindness; when they do not treat us humanely (which comes in degrees), then we are forced to flea and hide from them (or fight, depending on which direction of fight-or-flight fork in the road we take). We're especially afraid of psychopaths (and, as an unfortunate conflation, it's also why atheists are viewed with intense suspicion, since religious people do not understand how morality can make sense without their own personal religious views). We purposely isolate ourselves from those who don't empathize enough with us. Why? If we empathize with ourselves, we will care about not being hurt. When we don't experience empathy, we will become isolated and afraid of people and authority figures (in various ways and to various degrees). It seems very logical to me. It may be the right thing to do, even if it sucks (it's bad that we must, but not wrong that we do). 

* We became approval seekers and lost our identity in the process.

This is a complex claim to unpack. In particular, it requires conceptual analysis of [[approval|Approval]] and [[identity|Identity]]. There is an enormous array of literature on and philosophical frameworks/architectures about these concepts. I can't distill a sufficient answer into a single book for this, let alone a few paragraphs. More importantly, I'm not an expert (but it is my practical plight to at least come up with answers for myself anyways). I'm not convinced that we need to delve far into the concept of identity here, but I believe we need to examine the concept of approval to understand the ACOA claim. I'll try to give a common sense answer that will juice your intuitions.

Approving, roughly, is when we [[like|Like]] something to the extent that we agree to it or condone it, that our liking is a source of motivations for condoning, that our liking provides content to our intentions and perspective for the act of condoning. 

Vitally, //liking //something isn't "up to us" in important ways (unlike [[love|Love]]), since that would require direct doxastic voluntarism. That I like pizza isn't "up to me" in any direct way. I can't choose not to like it. I can, however, habituate or train myself to like or not like pizza (acquiring or de-acquiring a taste), and thus liking may be indirectly up to me. Whether or not we like pizza is the result of training our intuitions (both consciously and subconsciously) through utility calculations and pattern recognition over a series of encounters with pizza. Liking is a gutteral, fast acting response. The process of liking occurs in our [[Fastmind]]. Liking is an intuitive desire+belief about the merits, value, or acceptability of a thing in a given context. 

Approval is an action. An action has two halves, an act and an intention (a maxim, a motivation, a reason for acting that way). What kind of action is it? It seems to be a kind of "condoning," usually in moral contexts. Liking provides the content for the intention half of the condoning act half in an approval action whole. So, as an example approval action, if I approve of what someone is doing, my act may be telling them "That is awesome!" and my reason for that act would be that I like what they are doing.

Seeking approval is seeking an action from someone (because, I assume, only persons can perform actions). It means we seek for them to condone the value of something (e.g. in us, about us, regarding us, etc.) based upon what that person likes (the rewards-based intuitions embedded in their Fastmind). One difficulty in approval seeking is that a person can't change what they like overnight. A person can't fully like what you are doing if they don't understand what you are doing (and why). The like-intuitions aren't there for them to approve.

I take this ACOA claim to be saying we don't approve of ourselves, and instead we seek the approval of something outside ourselves. Basically, this is saying that we no longer care about what we like, but instead care about what other people like. 

Is this a bad thing? Not obviously. It depends on your context. Is it a bad thing for a murderous psychopath to repent, to not like themselves (to not approve of themselves) and seek approval of something external to them? No. It's a great thing. In fact, one formulation of the [[Categorical Imperative]] boils down to seeking the approval of ideal [[Rational]] persons. Asking yourself, "what would the virtuous person (e.g. Jesus) do?" is moral approval seeking. Thus, approval seeking outside ourselves is fundamental to our moral character development, to becoming a good and morally excellent person who does the right thing, at the right time, in the right way, for the right reasons. 

Even friendship appears, at least in large part, to be about approving of each other in important ways and to large extents. It is a kind of mutual social masturbation. You stroke my ego, I stroke yours. We cheer each other on. We help each other accomplish the others' projects (we take their projects to be our own). We do things together because we enjoy mutual social masturbation more than going solo. We're programmed to be social creatures. If you don't care about your friend's approval, are they really your friend at all? Maybe. Often not. It depends. How empathic are you being? 

Alright, how does empathy fit in this picture? Approval of someone requires liking someone. Liking someone requires understanding, such as developing a theory of mind about how someone thinks, how they understand the world or context, why they do what they do, etc. Liking someone is fundamentally entangled with empathizing with someone. Thus, approval is fundamentally about empathizing with someone. 

Now, of course, we can disagree with and disapprove of someone while still empathizing with them to some degree. And, of course, perfect empathy is impossible for us (we can't magically transfer our complete minds to each other). But, it seems obvious that there always remains the possibility that when you are disagreeing with someone that you don't fully understand what they are thinking and why. It is here that I think my parents are prone to dismiss my view as a confabulation (and I'm done taking it: they will get the exact same thing back).  

In any case, I think the causal chain goes something like:

empathy => like => approval

As to how empathy relates to the ACOA claim: people who can't empathize with themselves enough to approve of themselves will seek empathy and approval from external sources. Sometimes we shouldn't like aspects of ourselves. We have be more objective about ourselves while maintaining our empathy for ourselves to make the changes necessary for us to like ourselves. This is a necessary thing to do. Clearly, the way we approach the ACOA claim requires us to bring the issue of empathy to the center stage.

Okay, I'm not satisifed with my answer here. I need to come back to it. There is so much packed into this issue. I'm still convinced that empathy is the core of the issue, not alcoholism. I think alcoholism and addictions (and all other causes) which replace our empathy for others is the real source of the problem, and the reason for the confusion people have with this ACOA list.

* We are frightened by angry people and any personal criticism.

This is the parallel of the previous point about approval, simply coming from the other direction. They are corollaries of each other. I also think it is much easier to understand how empathy fits into this direction of the equation. 

Criticism is very rarely done perfectly. Constructive criticism is about delivering the right message to a person. That message requires empathy. In order to correctly criticize someone, you must craft a message that effectively changes their point of view. You can't change their point of view without understanding it. You have see the world through their shoes, to see why they think the way they think, in order to provide them the means to find the right path. You have to empathize with them to criticize them. Without empathy, criticism tends to become a strawman, to border on fallacy. Without empathy, criticism is a personal attack. 

How do we know when someone is constructively criticizing us and when they are attacking us? It isn't always easy to distinguish. It seems that the receiver must also engage in the practice of empathy. There has to be a mutual trust between the two parties. They must believe they want the best for each other, in a way. 

Frankly, that's not the way the world works. We suck at empathizing. Of course most criticisms are so imperfect that they have attacks in them. At some point, people are just going to be frightened and hurt by failed criticism that demonstrate a lack of empathy. Someone who hasn't experienced enough empathy and correspondingly who themselves lack empathy (our ability to empathize has biological limits in the our brain's rTPJ, but is also a muscle to be trained) will of course be frightened by people. They will see criticism as lacking empathy. You can only take so much of it.

* We either become alcoholics, marry them or both, or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic to fulfill our sick abandonment needs.

I think this is a rhetorical scarecrow in its wording. What it should really say is something like: People who haven't experienced empathy may seek others who haven't experienced empathy so that they can empathize with each other. Oh, you mean people are seeking empathy? No doubt. We need empathy; it's part of our being social creatures. It's like food and water at a social and existential level. Man cannot live on bread alone.

* We live life from the viewpoint of victims and we are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship relationships.

Like the previous point, this is another facet to the empathy seeking gem. We live life from the viewpoint of victims because we are victims. All of us, to varying degrees, are the victims of not receiving empathy. Sometimes people don't empathize with us on purpose, and sometimes they don't empathize with us by accident. The "man-up" mentality is about discarding our need for empathy (even empathy for ourselves). Victim-blaming is about disregarding someone's need for empathy and making it all the victim's fault ("they deserve that pain; I'm glad they have that pain; I'm a good person who doesn't need to feel their pain because I wasn't stupid like they were"). 

Of course, victims are attracted to other victims. Victims need empathy, and other victims can empathize with them. Other victims understand what it means to be a victim. This isn't wrong, it's just sad and a bad thing that it must occur.

* We have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility and it is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves; this enables us not to look too closely at our own faults, etc.

This is a very poorly worded claim. Can you overdevelop a sense of responsibility? No. Can you be addicted to moral responsibility? Yes. Can you think about being responsible to the detriment of actually being responsible? Yes. Can you see the flaws in others without seeing your own flaws? Of course. What is the core of this enabling?

My hypothesis is that when we see the failures of others over and over again, when we see they do not live up to their responsibilities, when we see their psychopathy, when we can no longer empathize with them, we become habituated in our lack of empathy. We fail to empathize with the world, and eventually we fail to empathize with who we really are as well. We stop looking inwards, and why should we when nobody else is either? At best, we create a false narrative of ourselves that we empathize with, but no longer can see who we really are. At worst, we see the futility in empathizing altogether.

What is odd about responsibility is that it is innately about being empathic. When we are responsible, we are empathizing with our future selves or with others (and their future selves). It is only through a terrible turn on that righteous path that we become psychopathic, that we colloquially "judge," that we fail to remove the log from our own eye so that we can see clearly enough to remove the speck from our brother's eye. 

It is empathy that starts us on the right path in the ACOA claim, and it is the lack of empathy takes us down the wrong path. Unfortunately, I'm not even sure I can blame someone for lacking empathy anymore. I can see why they don't. Ah, but this is part of my struggle to understand our freedom (which I'm failing at, and I guarantee, we all are). So, let me set this aside and say: empathy is clearly the key to understanding fundamental moral judgement problems brought up in this ACOA claim.

* We get guilt feelings when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others.

This one is interesting for me personally. I definitely feel this way with my parents. I don't know how to stand up for myself instead of giving into them. This is in part because I can't communicate effectively enough, but also because what I need to communicate to them would really hurt them. It would be painful for them, and I really don't want to cause them pain. It would be painful for us. 

I need to stand up for myself and communicate these issues though. I need to empathize with our future selves. It would be better for us in the long run to experience the short term pain (that said, my reality map conflict is strong enough that it makes me suicidal). Would you tell someone something that could make them suicidal if they actually understood it? That really wouldn't be empathic. But, it may be our only option.

I must say, I don't think my parents are capable of empathizing with me. A foolish, uncharitable part of me worries that in some ways they lack the intellectual integrity and capacity. That my real vulnerability is that I worry they choose not to empathize (definitional psychopathy). I don't feel guilty here, but I feel like I must protect myself. Putting myself out there is not a risk always worth taking.

Back to the claim directly, why would we feel guilty? Guilt is an experience that only occurs with empathy. Psychopaths don't feel guilt because they don't feel empathy. As to standing up for ourselves, there seem to be so many reasons one might not. At least part of the problem rests upon empathy here. Presumably, when we don't stand up for ourselves when we ought to, it is because we haven't empathized enough with ourselves. We don't take ourselves to be valuable enough in some way. 

* We became addicted to excitement.

[[Addiction]] needs a definition. Roughly, it is a consistent, impulsive behavior which we judge to have suboptimal enough utility calculations that we collectively call it irrational. 

Addiction demonstrations one's lack of executive functioning. That is to say, it shows an inability to appropriately empathize with one's future self. Boredom is a classic psychopathy personality trait, and it may be the case that addiction to excitement is a psychopathic expression.

* We confuse love and pity and tend to "love" people we can "pity" and "rescue."

[[Love]] needs a definition. It is easy to bandy that word about. Let us assume that love is a choice to be empathic. To love someone is to choose to empathize with them, and to be moved to seek the best for them after standing in their shoes (obviously, all of these come in degrees). 

Of course love and pity have enormous crossover. Those who are pitiable, in need of rescue, are those who need our love the most. 

Someone who desperately seeks empathy, who needs it, who systematically or crucially failed to receive empathy in appropriate ways will empathize with others who they perceive to be in a similar position. It seems to be part of empathizing with ourselves when we vicariously empathize with others in similar shoes. Surely the person who lacked food growing up will become adults keenly aware of the hunger of children. To some extent, it seems very healthy to be moved in this way. It's not obviously the wrong thing to do. 

* We have "stuffed" our feelings from our traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings because it hurts so much (Denial).

Call it a confabulation if you want, but I think we've evolved to undergo the 5 stages of grief, and it might actually be rational. It is not obvious to me that we should aim to go through all 5 stages. There may be many cases in our lives which are best dealt with by remaining in one stage. Acceptance is not obviously always the most adaptive answer (or, we at least need need better reasons to agree to such a generalization).

Being able to "tune out" the thing causing us grief is sometimes the most practical option. We may not have the resources to do anything about it. We may not even have the intellectual and emotional resources (let alone the financial and social freedom) necessary to achieve acceptance (which may just be stoicism). Again, this is the difference between good and right. Being unable to accept, while being stuck in an earlier stage is not a good thing (that doesn't it make it our fault though), it may still be the right thing (assuming it is even a choice).

Dealing with grief is a process of empathizing with ourselves, making crucial transitions in our reality map and identity. Empathizing with ourselves is hard work. Some people may be so damaged they can't.

* We judge ourselves harshly and have a very low sense of self-esteem.

This is another normatively loaded claim. Answering it is logically equivalent to answering fundamental questions in metaethics.

Maybe the world would be a much better place if we all judged ourselves harshly and had less esteem for ourselves. Is it a bad thing that me do? Sometimes, yes. Is it wrong? Not obviously.

<<<
[[KIN]]: I want us to see the difference between what is adaptive for us and what is morally right for us to do. They are not the same thing. This is the nature of justice. 
<<<
<<<
[[RPIN]]: Morality is not practical. At least your obsession with doing the right thing, being virtuous, is not normatively required. Even though you know you can't achieve it, you still almost blindly aim to be virtuous. There is hope there that I recognize, but it is unwise. Come to the darkside of "practical wisdom," brother. Find a middleway to be "moral enough" while still happy. Everyone else is doing it, so why not you? Can't you empathize with sinners like this? =)
<<<
<<<
[[KIN]]: To not aim for the right thing is literally to not aim for the right thing. Moral law is moral law by definition. It really is an all or nothing thing in a sense. That isn't to say we will achieve what we seek (as you charitably point out), but it Maybe Hursthouse is correct; maybe we are Marred.
<<<

I'm almost sick of how redundant I'm being. This is obviously about empathy. Presumably, appropriate judgment is deeply empathic. Having a low self-esteem is a failure to empathize with yourself because, presumably, in empathizing with yourself you appreciate your dignity and self-worth.

* We are dependent personalities who are terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings, which we received from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us.

Is this telling me to abandon my parents? Are my parents abandoning me for this reason? Lol. How are we supposed to deal with the psychopaths in our lives? There are competing interests, priorities, and values here. 

<<<
[[RPIN]]: To me, this is saying, don't be dependent when you can choose not to be. Be independent of others, and avoid making major sacrifices. Or, essentially, play a game where you acquire as much empathy as you can for the least cost (even a Kantian cost). 
<<<

My parents can't sufficiently empathize with me. Sure, they know what it is like to raise children while struggling financially. Sure, they understand vocation. Sure, they are struggling with a lack of empathy in their lives and the world. They do not have the tools or inclination to empathize with me though. They are mix of inept+fallible humans and psychopaths, to some degree, toward me. 

What they have earned in our social bank-accounts through our tit-for-tat game of generating trust and empathy with each other is spent. That account is empty (arguably, in debt to me). 

How can we empathize with each other? Maybe they can understand me enough in the wiki to empathize. I don't think they can though. Odds are high they won't. The risk does not seem worth it in that respect. I don't know how. Maybe I should just accept that we aren't compatible in this way. 

If there is hope, I believe it is through my mother.

Maybe I shouldn't try to hold onto the relationship, or maybe the relationship is just going to be us maintaining social capital with each other (i.e. using each other).

<<<
[[KIN]]: How noble of you. /s
<<<

This ACOA point requires more attention, no doubt.

* Alcoholism is a family disease; and we became para-alcoholics and took on the characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink.

This should read: Psychopathy is a family disease (a memetic virus which spreads through social conditioning, particularly to those with genetic predispositions). Those are the "characteristics" ACOA are trying to point out in both alcoholics and "para-alcoholics." I.e. This isn't about alcoholism; this is about a lack of empathy.

* Para-alcoholics are reactors rather than actors.

<<<
[[RPIN]]: My god. The sheer ignorance in this sentence is extraordinary. Define [[Freedom]]. Your common sense definition is going to fail. Freedom is epiphenomenal. We are all reactions, and none of us are actors. The appearance of being an actor is confabulated. You are the consequence of a detailed circumstance. A genetic and memetic story fully explains your actions (you are reducible and not emergent in a strong enough way). 
<<<
<<<
[[KIN]]: So, para-alcoholics aren't responsible for their actions? They aren't persons. They don't have dignity. What an ugly claim. It is the end of being a moral agent, it seems.
<<<

I'm not really sure what this ACOA claim is saying. It is obviously a very strong (strong doesn't mean justified; I just mean that the point of view has a rich set of assumptions) metaethical claim. 

I do find it at least offensive. The presumption is that para-alcoholics do not have meaningful lives, and that further, others are somehow "more autonomous." It's the absurd hypocrisy of calling someone a "reactionary." I have bad news: everyone is a reactionary. 

Charitably (perhaps too much so), I take this ACOA claim to apply to me in this way: I am obsessively empathic or autistic, that my decision procedure appears so "black and white" that it seems obvious to others that I am a reactor. Hilariously, just because someone's decision procedure is less clear (although, I don't think mine is ultimately very simple) in this respect does not make them any more of an actor than me. 

ACOA solves nothing in the metaethical region. It points out a set of empirical rule of thumbs about the nature of human interactions. It is a descriptive tool (and a very poorly conceptualized one at that). Prescriptively, it either begs the question, providing no justification, or it doesn't even actually prescribe. That said, I'm glad to have thought about it (and I will continue to do so). There is obviously something compelling about it, and I hope it will aid me in my philosophical investigations and existential healing.
