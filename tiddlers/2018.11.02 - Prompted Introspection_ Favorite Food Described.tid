title: 2018.11.02 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Food Described

!! Using all of your 5 senses, describe your favorite food.

I'm really hungry right now. I've not yet eaten today. I'm not sure what my favorite food is. I recently talked something about this: [[2018.10.18 - /b/]] (and it's odd to see me linking to [[/b/]] here). 

Pizza can be made in a thousand ways. My favorite style is hand-made Brooklyn style. It's oily, thin, cheesy as fuck, and it's visually appealing to me. I missed New Orleans for that. We lived within walking distance of the best pizzeria I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. God damn, my mouth is watering thinking about it. 

Pizza doesn't really have a sound itself. You can talk about making it or eating it, but that's not the same to me. I actually have a poor sense of smell and taste (or it is completely fucking overwhelming to me...all black or white on this issue...I suggest it something important to say about the nature of my memory).
