title: 2018.03.22 - Computer Musings: m14 & m15

I'm working on making m14 something I enjoy using, and m15 is getting and OS refresh from GalliumOS to Manjaro XFCE. Having a seriously hard time getting a USB that fully works (I've pulled all the normal methods out, and I'm even trying for ghetto hacks like USB Passthrough to VM).

Tried isohybrid out. Gave an error message, but it did write it. Tried it out, and it gave me a kernel panic (but a step closer).

SUSE Studio Imagewriter is outstanding! It did it. Also, checksum didn't show up correctly. That helped fix the problem as well.
