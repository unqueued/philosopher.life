!! Tell about a time you slept outdoors.

My last answer was a sad one: [[2017.12.30 - Prompted Introspection Log: Sleeping Outdoors]].

The last time I slept outdoors overnight was when my family went camping with my brother [[JRE]] and Rebecca. We didn't bring enough padding, and we could feel the gravel (I've never had gravel on a campsite before, I believe). My wife and I didn't sleep well, but it was a good experience. The kids loved the trip.

In fact, we're going to have to do it again. I was hoping to go camping with [[AA]]. Maybe we could just invite everyone. I will need to ask her what she wants.
