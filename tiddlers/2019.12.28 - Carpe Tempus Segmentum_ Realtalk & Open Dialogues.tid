* Talk
* My offspring just played today. It was excellent.
* Tons of extremely serious discussions today with everyone.
** I'm grateful that everyone here is building bridges hard and fast. 
*** Especially because I'm such a condescending pain in the ass to speak with extensively in some cases. 
** Charitable, patient, and methodical dialectics.
** Worked on a puzzle with folks. 
*** Valuable icebreaker, talking point generator, analogy device, etc. 
** I think one of my favorite aspects of our gathering is that everyone is comfortable enough to be anxious around each other (trusting honesty), and it's not a big deal.
** We rabbitholed so much, that I'm not even sure how to describe everything we discussed. I want to do it justice here, and I'm going to fail.
*** [[UJ]] discussed the concepts of motivation, value, freedom, compromise, and many other normative issues. 
****  I'm grateful that he would take the time to so carefully examine our differences of opinion with me. He was thoughtful and kind in his approach. I appreciate his pragmatism too. He's highly constructive.
*** [[AA]] and I walked through theories we have of everyone's minds, active ways to continue building ties (including with our offspring), thinking about the past with charity, approval-seeking considerations, and tons more. 
**** I'm exceptionally grateful for everything she has done to make this happen. I am listening as carefully as I can, and it's completely obvious that she is too. I don't even know how to speak highly enough, especially in disagreement. She bends over backward to make space for the perspectives of others. Raw hospitality from her again and again and again.
*** [[L]] and [[K]] have been gluing the day together for everyone. 
*** I'm grateful for the extremely high bandwidth exchanges. We covered an enormous amount of ground very quickly. 
*** Depth and listening all around. It's my honor to even be here. I'm by far and away the least graceful of the bunch, and it shows.
* Talking dominated the entire day. 
* Chili
** [[K]]'s recipe was solid, a classic.
* Played board/card games and chilled.
* Snacks
* Finished Mandalorian.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 3
