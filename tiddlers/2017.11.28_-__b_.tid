My brother once said a line that I found interesting. I got to wondering if he felt the reason I wrote this wiki is that I feared death. In varying ways and degree, of course. I didn't think it was one of the primary causes of my work here until yesterday. Now, I see a way of understanding in that light. That is to say, in reshaping myself, I'm trying to cut memories out of myself. I've chosen to retain those memories here, in a sense. I'm trying to build a memory base with a decent structure to remember who I was, in part. Although I think this computation actually serves the future me in many ways, it is also a kind of trophy-incentive medal that I give to the parts of me that I kill off ("here you go, soldier; thank you for your service"). 

Look at my Retired: sections. It's clear that I want to remember something about myself or at least who I was. I remember the wrestling, but it isn't so painful. To the victor goes the spoils; history is written by the victors, etc. I honor versions of myself I have defeated, sliced out of my working memory to some extent, or shaped out of who I am. I fear death in the sense that I fear killing parts of myself off.

Imagine a car company making an unsafe car, bribing your local motor association to "test" it and give it a "5-star safety" rating, and then taking out life insurance policies on the customers who buy the car.

A beautiful analogy for what bankers did in the previous crisis. Seldon, help us.

If college being free for everyone would make a college education worthless, then you are blatantly admitting a college education exists to be a class gateway.<<ref "2018.12.21">>

Free hardly makes it worthless. It should be free. Losing your competitive advantages and abilities to manipulate the masses on political, social, economic, and intellectual levels is definitely not good for those in power. The uneducated bring psychopaths to power.

[[Virtue is Knowledge]].

Decentralize knowledge (power). It's so fucking obvious.
