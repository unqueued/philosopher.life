How's your week going?
TUE 3:48 PM
Your costumes set for the con?
TUE 3:48 PM
Hey [[h0p3]]! My week is alright. Having no desire to do anything at work is frustrating, but if anything it fuels me to get out faster. And no, I still have an outfit to sew first before I’m totally ready. I’m nervous to start sewing again though. >_>
TUE 3:50 PM
It’s been awhile since I’ve used a sewing machine.
TUE 3:50 PM
I'm glad it serves as fuel for you. I suppose it feels surreal, maybe even dead-man-walking-esque. I often feel covert and find it difficult to contain.
TUE 3:55 PM
One more outfit. What are all your outfits?
TUE 3:56 PM
Surreal is a good word for it. I think I understand how everyone else who ever left felt.
TUE 3:56 PM
Assuming everything falls into place for you.
TUE 3:56 PM
I believe the plan is Team Skull grunt, character from a volleyball anime named Sugawara, and this last outfit I’m working on which is a play on the Pokémon Espeon. More an “inspired” outfit than a straight up cosplay.
TUE 3:58 PM
Sorry, had to drop for some meetings. How have you been?
TUE 5:33 PM
I'm okay. Looking for another job since this one is over.
TUE 6:03 PM
Working on school with the kids, and I'm reading and writing my wiki as usual.
TUE 6:44 PM
Your job is straight up over? Dang. Not coming back up after summer is overV
TUE 7:18 PM
over?*
TUE 7:18 PM
No. It should be back.
TUE 9:28 PM
Hoping to find something that pays a living wage.
TUE 9:29 PM
