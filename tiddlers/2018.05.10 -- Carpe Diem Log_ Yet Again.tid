title: 2018.05.10 -- Carpe Diem Log: Yet Again

* Woke at 5:45 without the alarm. My body's timer is just going off. It was a beautiful night of sleep, and I needed it!
* I think I know my way to work now without GPS. It usually takes me a few days to get the hang of it. 
* I'm very much enjoying my Stephenson //Interface// book. The nice part of moving back to fiction from Russell's book is that I can move from 1.3 to 2.0 speed again. 
* Work
* "David" Brian told me about "Creepy Trail," and downhill bike trail that costs my family about $75. Will consider it.
* Got home, bliss gummy
* Talked to JRE
** An odd talk. He had an odd day though. He said little or nothing about donors+L+K. I'm surprised. He did receive an e-mail about it during our conversation though.
** Also, our phone conversations keep disconnecting, on multiple devices.
* Read+Write
* Tried watching a show, but it wasn't for me.
* Fireman Time!
* Couch by midnight?
