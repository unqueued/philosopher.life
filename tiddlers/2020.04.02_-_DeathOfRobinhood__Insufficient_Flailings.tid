"""
How's your week been?
Mar 22 7:44pm
Full of insufficient flailings
Mar 22 7:59pm
You?
Mar 22 7:59pm
Lol. Yup. That fits me too.
Mar 22 8:00pm
It's been good. World is in flux, and I'm stressed thinking about it. Inside the house though, it's been solid.
Mar 22 8:00pm
Are you still going to be able to have your wedding?
Mar 22 8:01pm
We will have the wedding God wants. Stripped of excess and people-pleasing, we've been forced to find the core expression of what this marriage means
Mar 22 8:02pm
Preach, yo
Mar 22 8:03pm
In our case, a small private affair with a witness or two.
We both have peace about it
Mar 22 8:03pm
It will be a day to remember. I'm glad you are still having a wedding!
Mar 22 8:04pm
Do you want to continue our conversation au vive voix?
Mar 22 8:05pm
Can we do tomorrow night?
Mar 22 8:06pm
Still have a lot to do in Family Time tonight.
Mar 22 8:06pm
Sure. I'm happy you got in touch.
Mar 22 8:06pm
I'll go ahead and relish one of my last few nights of deafening solitude :)
Mar 22 8:07pm
lmao
