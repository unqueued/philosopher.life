title: 2018.05.07 -- Carpe Diem Log: Work

* Woke many times between 4-6. At least I got 5 solid hours of sleep
* Hugged wife before leaving. I love that brief period of time with her. I feel bad that her head is killing her today.
* Worked
* Came home; offspring were liars and failures
* Inform the Something
* Read+Write
* Dindin
* Bed at 10, don't know when I slept. Fairly easily though.
