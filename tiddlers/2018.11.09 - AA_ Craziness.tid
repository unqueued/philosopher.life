```
What you up to this weekend?
FRI 1:35 PM
Craziness—way more than I should have
FRI 1:36 PM
Tonight I work and then I have to spend the night at the church for a lockin with [[AG]]’s AHG troop.
FRI 1:37 PM
Lol
FRI 1:38 PM
Tomorrow I have a meeting at Lifeway at 8am and then I go back to the church to help clean up...and then lunch with [[UJ]]’s sister Sarah at noon
FRI 1:38 PM
That is jam packed.
FRI 1:39 PM
Then time with my bed...because I have to work 5:30-9:30
FRI 1:39 PM
Sunday after church we are meeting [[L]] (and maybe [[JRE]]) to celebrate Gpa’s 80th for lunch
FRI 1:40 PM
Somewhere in there is laundry and shopping —but likely I an gonna sleep :sleeping:
FRI 1:41 PM
Can I hide at your house?
FRI 1:41 PM
Ofc!
FRI 1:41 PM
lol
FRI 1:41 PM
You think you'll get any sleep during the lockin?
FRI 1:42 PM
Woot!
FRI 1:42 PM
Um last time I was out by 11—(I have an air mattress
FRI 1:42 PM
noice
FRI 1:42 PM
So I shall torture the kidlets with my dragon snoring
FRI 1:43 PM
:dragon: :sleeping:
FRI 1:43 PM
lol
FRI 1:43 PM
[[AG]] has anxiety about not being with her parents and does better when I am there
FRI 1:44 PM
[[j3d1h]] is the same way.
FRI 1:45 PM
I do not know what to do about it.
FRI 1:45 PM
probably spend some time with her Uncles, etc.
FRI 1:45 PM
It was not my intention to shelter her that hard, but homeschooling has several prices we pay.
FRI 1:46 PM
She was fine until Gma Lois died and then it occurred to her that we may too someday. Somehow she feels like it can’t happen if she is there. She won’t even sleep in her room. (She rarely has ever) she sleeps on the couch
FRI 1:46 PM
That is hard.
FRI 1:47 PM
She is an introvert and given the option would stay home and never leave
FRI 1:47 PM
Introverts unite!
FRI 1:47 PM
(not an oxymoron, right?)
FRI 1:48 PM
Unless [[L]] is there —she will go anywhere with [[L]]
FRI 1:48 PM
Yes! I love it
FRI 1:48 PM
I have tried getting her involved in more things...not sure that works as well as I would like
FRI 1:50 PM
I think you try a lot harder than I do on this front.
FRI 1:53 PM
I'm so hermitic and misanthropic, I'm like: why the hell would you want to spend your time with almost any other people? Lol.
FRI 1:53 PM
Part of me thinks the kids are just so different that it's a waste of time trying, perhaps like it's a better use of my energy to prepare them for the life of a pariah. Survival skills for the desert.
FRI 1:55 PM
Well [[UJ]] and [[L]] are not the hermit type like [[AG]] and I so I am trying to balance. I also know that staying at home all the time feeds my depression so that is why I work at the bookstore so I stay out of the  pit during the summer and school breaks
FRI 2:15 PM
I would like to think that [[AG]] can stay out of that pit...naive I know —maybe that’s a talk she and I need to have at least so she knows that she has someone who she can talk to and who understands
FRI 2:20 PM
If it comes
FRI 2:20 PM
That makes sense to me.
FRI 2:34 PM
I think it's really cool that the bookstore helps with your depression.
FRI 2:35 PM
[[AG]] is almost old enough to have a job, just a few more years.
FRI 2:36 PM
Hell, she's gonna be drivin' soon. Lol.
FRI 2:36 PM
Its a stay up all night—sleep all day cycle. The depression comes because I get nothing done during the day and can’t at night (everyone is sleeping) so I am again up all night —it gets bad. But if I work, I can’t sleep all day and I have accomplished something—so I can sleep at night :blush:
FRI 2:37 PM
She wants to get a job at 16 so we shall see —thats a year and a few months away
FRI 2:38 PM
The stay busy mechanism seems to work.
FRI 2:38 PM
Yeah she has laid claim to my green hamster car ... we shall see
FRI 2:39 PM
I either want a honda accord (yes I love hondas) or a small pickup truck
FRI 2:40 PM
When we finish paying off [[UJ]]’s monster car
FRI 2:40 PM
Both options sound good to me. High-gas mileage car or a truck that can actually move stuff.
FRI 2:41 PM
What would you do with the truck?
FRI 2:41 PM
Yeah we often seem to need to move things ...well as we slowly fix the house
FRI 2:42 PM
Right now we have the blue truck that was Gpa’s until January
FRI 2:42 PM
Alright, Honda plus a hitch for a small trailer bed.
FRI 2:43 PM
Perfect
FRI 2:46 PM
You will be an elite Appalachian woman then.
FRI 2:46 PM
1337
FRI 2:47 PM
I am sure you knew this but Gma Lois’ mother died because of depression
FRI 2:47 PM
Woot 1337ness
FRI 2:47 PM
It runs in the family.
FRI 2:49 PM
Yeah —suicide by knife—not pleasant
FRI 2:50 PM
Nope.
FRI 2:50 PM
She would have done better if she could have stayed with Gma and Gpa —at least she had something there to do and feel needed. But no one knew she was that bad —the whole not talking thing
FRI 2:51 PM
Anyway —what are your weekend plans?
FRI 2:52 PM
I am convinced that exercising The Golden Rule, empathizing with Others, is necessary. I still keep my exit strategy available (I do not intend to experience pain for any serious duration), though there are a couple hurdles I have to jump through first. I think I'm on the other side though.
FRI 2:54 PM
I have a small librarian party to attend. I have a new friend I met this week, Brad. He's a computer geek shutin, and I want to get to know him.
FRI 2:54 PM
Gonna spend some time tomorrow with him tomorrow and maybe Sunday.
FRI 2:54 PM
Laundry...we've not been able to do any for a week.
FRI 2:55 PM
It's becoming monstrous.
FRI 2:55 PM
Image attached to message
FRI 2:55 PM
haha
FRI 2:55 PM
Christmas decorations?
FRI 2:55 PM
I think my guess about the exhaust pipe being clogged (the one in the apartment) is correct. Maintenance spent a couple hours yesterday, and they are supposed to come by again today...they have not.
FRI 2:56 PM
I rush ordered the fuse to be here today as well.
FRI 2:56 PM
If the stars align, I will have a dryer working tonight/tomorrow.
FRI 2:56 PM
Weeehoooo!
FRI 2:56 PM
I use the one at the church a few times when mine was out
FRI 2:57 PM
Noice
FRI 2:57 PM
I intend to make a serious push in The Remodeling this weekend. The wiki is a very difficult tool to learn. I'm two years into it, and I still feel like a noob. That's where my hope is, as usual.
FRI 2:59 PM
I've got ~7k tiddlers to edit, tag, restructure. It's going slowly. Lol.
FRI 2:59 PM
Oh my
FRI 3:00 PM
It's been interesting looking through a history of other people who have attempted similar projects. I'm definitely on the crazy train. =)
FRI 3:00 PM
That’s ok though - It is a worthy quest
FRI 3:01 PM
Does [[k0sh3k]] still do the renaissance fair things?
FRI 3:13 PM
We actually only did that once. I think she would enjoy that still.
FRI 3:16 PM
Hard to do in our position.
FRI 3:16 PM
Maybe when we are older.
FRI 3:16 PM
Yeah we talked about [[AG]] sewing ...and I wondered if [[k0sh3k]] still did those. It might make [[j3d1h]] interested in sewing at least small things
FRI 3:17 PM
Also these two sites (clothes) always remind me of [[k0sh3k]]
FRI 3:20 PM
https://holyclothing.com/collections/dresses-1
FRI 3:20 PM
That definitely is up her alley. Sending to her.
FRI 3:20 PM
[[j3d1h]] doesn't seem very interested in sewing. She draws quite a bit on paper and with her drawing-tablet. https://www.deviantart.com/42sans6/gallery/
FRI 3:23 PM
I like this one: https://www.deviantart.com/42sans6/art/A-E-S-T-H-E-T-I-C-Mountains-754972712
FRI 3:23 PM
Wow —very nice!
FRI 3:23 PM
Most of her work is computer science though. She builds some complex things for me. Currently, she's building a new search plugin tailored for Tiddlywiki.
FRI 3:23 PM
She is an exceptionally gifted young lady —doesn’t surprise me with her parents
FRI 3:24 PM
This was the other site —fun dresses with pockets!
FRI 3:31 PM
https://holyclothing.com/collections/dresses-1
FRI 3:31 PM
Grr
FRI 3:32 PM
https://svahausa.com/collections/adults-dresses
FRI 3:32 PM
There we go
FRI 3:32 PM
She's going to want them all.
FRI 3:32 PM
There is even a dewey decimal system hehe
FRI 3:32 PM
Yes !
FRI 3:33 P
