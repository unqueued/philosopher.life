//Hue myrrh us voice-to-text inaccuracy slips, silly homophones, mondegreens, catachresis, paraphasic mispelings, eggcorns, and mumpsimuses earworm their way into me; I'm ticklish, and that's important for a healthy self of steam. I am butt dust, and their I shall return. I feel like a child in this parody pair of dice. It's like when I don't know how to pronounce a word because I've only read it, but the other way; my illiteracy canoes no bounds. Like most human beans, I am a profoundly incompetent man, and this is my life rye cheer. I just gotsta enjoy the shit in my ear-or else I'd go crazy.//
