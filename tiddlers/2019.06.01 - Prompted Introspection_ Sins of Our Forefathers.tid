!! How are your father and grandfather alike?

Enlarged amygdalas, schizotypal, ultra [[pright]] conservatives, evangelical, reactionaries, violent, hardknock lives, chipped shoulders, hearts on their sleeves, they've been in a lot of fights, Massholes, balding, barrel-chested into obesity, vampiric con-artists, mostly hypocritical Christians, exceptionally frugal, do not have significant relationships except with their spouses, bare minimum investment in their children, have helped those in poverty, loners, drive a lot, losing their minds, loudmouthed, tradeskilled, significant grip strength, physically and emotionally abusive, dark triadic, and neanderthalic with high-T.

I'm quite similar. Reason is the only thing which holds those parts of me back, and poorly at that.
