Reading my entire wiki is the price you will pay to speak in person with me. You don't have to agree with it, but you do need to understand it as best as you can.

Otherwise, if you want to engage in the dialectic with me, you'll do it in writing. I will do my best to give you the hospitable charity I give to all strangers in the dialectic. Do your best, and have a good attitude.
