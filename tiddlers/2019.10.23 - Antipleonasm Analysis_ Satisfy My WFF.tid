!! Respond to the following gem:

    The strength of our convictions is not evidence of their correctness, unless you are the virtuous agent.

Well, hello there, Saint Aristotle clone! Do you feel the convicted by this aphorism? Are you a convicted virtuous agent? The traction from attachment is the root of suffering and satisfaction on our repulsively attractive existential treadmills.<<ref "s">> Some roots of justification, especially casuistry, have a basis in conviction, but I'm convinced I don't really know what that means all the way down. Reliable indicators of correctness are reliable indicators of correctness insofar as they are reliable indicators of correctness. No, this isn't circular at all, or so I am convicted.

The strength of your convictions are only justified insofar as your disposition which generates those convictions is justified, and how you verify correctness recursively folds in on itself. [[Virtue is Knowledge]], of course. It is crucial that we doubt our emotions all the way down, but paradoxically, we can only do so by wielding our emotions (necessary for reason).<<ref "b">> The empirical process distorts itself, and it appears [[faith]] is required to resolve the problem at the bottom; there is no realism without a leap.

`/spiderman-point`

Frustratingly, I am the wrong kind of word-salad creature needed to satisfactorily answer (by my own ridiculous standards, of course) this question.
