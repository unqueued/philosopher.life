title: 2019.11.05 - Prompted Introspection: Greener

!! What do we mean when we say, "The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence"?

Oh, shit, we have another previous answer, [[2018.01.31 - Prompted Introspection Log: Grass is Greener]], which I don't know how to improve upon. I'm envious, of course, of my previous self.

Who is "we"? I don't know. I almost never hear this phrase uttered unless it's meant to point out a flaw in one's reasoning.
