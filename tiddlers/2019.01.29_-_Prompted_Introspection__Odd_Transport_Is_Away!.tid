title: 2019.01.29 - Prompted Introspection: Odd Transport Is Away!

!! What is an unusual form of transportation you have used?

Unusual to whom in what context? Give me the [[gfwiwcgws]] standard of unusualness, the observer's point of view to call it that, etc. I do not know. I used to ride ramps and halfpipes with my skateboards, rollerblades, and bikes. I liked sackraces, hippity-hops, and my pogostick. Lots of different kinds of boats. We had a school bus (when granddonors moved to Russia for a while). I've "transported" myself on a bunch of odd things temporarily out of boredom. 

One of my favorite transport methods: sliding with my socks on slick floors. ''Just take those old records off the shelf!''

I will never forget riding elephants as a child at that carnival or as an adult in Thailand. The absurdly dangerous motorcycle fancy work I'd have to do in Thailand with my wife riding purposely blind for years felt the most odd to me. We are lucky to be alive. I did a damned good job, imho.
