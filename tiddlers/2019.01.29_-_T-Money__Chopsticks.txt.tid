Years ago in Danforth hall I watch you eat ramen with a pair of plastic chop stick. I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
TUE 9:25 PM
You gave me those chop stick and said you had me. (I have sense lost those sticks years ago) but I have not lost my affinity for ramen and chop sticks or just being good with chop sticks.

It is amazing the little facets of things we take away from people and carry with us.
TUE 9:26 PM
Lol! That is awesome.

Sometimes it's the big things. And sometimes. It's just chopsticks and ramen. I have also passed this down to my kiddo. Who only eat her ramen with chop sticks. Lol
TUE 9:27 PM
I still love chopsticks too. I love having the chance to teach my kids as well. It's a good tradition.
TUE 9:28 PM
The small and the big things add up, like you said.
TUE 9:29 PM
Agreed. Hope you are well. I am ready for this weekend. And ready for this hidious cold snap to be over.
