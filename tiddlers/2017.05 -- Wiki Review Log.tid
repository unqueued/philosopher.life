!! Review:

* There are many, many storylines running through the Wiki Review Log. In a weird way, it is the central heartbeat of the wiki. 
* It has been my first full month of log, and I can now see how much they did shape my perspective, goals, and my month in general. 
* There is a lot of weighing, skepticism, and waiting in these logs. 
* The [[Wiki Review Log]] helped shape [[h0p3's Log]]
* A lot of posts just have "edited" or "audited," and that's okay. At the very least, I've clarified myself. I won't get tectonic shifts all the time, and that probably would be the best thing in the world anyways. Drop by drop!
* It's clear that [[Philosophipolitical Prescription]] and [[Realpolitik Speculation]] dropped off the map. I believe that [[Link Log]] has taken place here. This may not have been a good thing, but I just don't seem to have the energy or desire to write in these older repositories. 
** I need to think of proper ways to retire them or set them as long-running repositories which don't expect constant posts.
* Ha, I saw in my Wiki Review Log what I saw in my monthly audit of my Pipefitting Log about my constant claims about being unproductive, I just forgot about it. I'm still formulating a theory, I guess.
* While I will continue to complete this log, as I see its merits more clearly, I also believe it does not even come close to solving the executive function and self-conversational problems I'm still having. I hope to improve it over time and eventually find out what's missing.
* I must admit that I feel like I'm on autopilot and just "getting through it" in my Review logs. That said, I now have a story to look through. I have a narrative to interpret. I will continue to think about ways to improve this. I also feel like I need an unstructured writing time on my wiki. I need to force myself to write for a certain amount of time, but not on a specific topic (or something like that).
