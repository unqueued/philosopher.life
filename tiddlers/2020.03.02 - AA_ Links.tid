So what are your plans for the weekend?
Feb 14 2:57pm
Welll I really need to clean the house and get some papers graded but....maybe just sleep ? And something for Valentines day dinner?
Feb 14 2:58pm
This morning was rough ...somehow I ended up with two different shoes on and didnâ€™t notice until 10 am
Feb 14 2:59pm
Two of those sound really good.

Lol, that's awesome.
Feb 14 3:00pm
Oh my...
Feb 14 3:00pm
That's like a thing these days. Like, you are cool.
Feb 14 3:00pm
Woot!
Feb 14 3:00pm
We had a field trip to the local trampoline park and gattiâ€™s pizza â€”I am tired

Billie Eilish does the two shoe thing all the time: https://www.thethings.com/photos-of-billie-eilishs-most-interesting-outfits/
Feb 14 3:01pm
yeah, that does sound exhausting, even if fun.
Feb 14 3:01pm
Nice!!! It was an accidental cool ðŸ˜Ž
Feb 14 3:01pm
I like giving tests, but I hate grading them.
Feb 14 3:01pm
Yeah grading is not fun ðŸ¥º
Feb 14 3:01pm
But I have off Monday and Tuesday so maybe I can get some done then
Feb 14 3:02pm
How you manage to get off Monday and Tuesday?
Feb 14 3:03pm
Lazy yet comprehensive test designs are my favorite. I want to mindlessly do it, watch a show.
Feb 14 3:03pm
Exactly
Feb 14 3:04pm
Watching this show called //Watchmen// with [[k0sh3k]]. Good for snuggles.
Feb 14 3:04pm
Monday is presidents day and Tuesday is supposed to be a teacher in service but I donâ€™t need contact hours so I am skipping
Feb 14 3:04pm
Sweet.
Feb 14 3:05pm
Not gonna ask â€”will apologize later if I have to ðŸ˜Š
Feb 14 3:05pm
Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.
Feb 14 3:05pm
Exactly
Feb 14 3:05pm
I found some candles for [[L]] â€”thinking that she has maps and music for dnd, this would be smells

Musty carpets, grave yard grasses and dusty furniture hehe
Feb 14 3:07pm
There is a library one too
Feb 14 3:07pm
Dope.
Feb 14 3:08pm
She's gonna like that.
Feb 14 3:08pm
I think that is one of the heartbeats of her week.
Feb 14 3:09pm
I hope so
Feb 14 3:09pm
Yes she loves it
