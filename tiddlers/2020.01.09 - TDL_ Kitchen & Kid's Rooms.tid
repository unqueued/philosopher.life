title: 2020.01.09 - TDL: Kitchen & Kid's Rooms

* Kitchen is much better, but it has to be completed. 
** It's hard to cook and clean with everything strewn about, and it's consuming too much energy from my offspring.
** Landlord is replacing dishwasher on the 14th
* Wife needs to just fucking chill. Girl's running 100%, and I'm worried about her health.
** She's feeling anxious and oscillating a lot. It's so much to take in all at once. 
*** She wants to attend service Sunday. Guarantee that it occurs, sir.
** I think we should reconsider the DMV and just let her have a fucking day to herself, a weekend even. She's going way too hard.
*** Probably not possible for her not to do stuff, but at least minimizing it as far as we can. She needs a break. 
*** Thus, finish the bed off for her, make sure coffee+tea is set, have books and a machine to play on. Beg her to sit with her cat and watch Doctor Whoshit while reading. She needs space and more sleep.
**** Date if she wants and we can. Up to her.
* Call the podpeople since they might not follow through on their own scheduling (they have failed already twice).
* Feeling super disconnected from [[JRE]] lately. =/. 
** Will push harder to chat. Sad that I had to AFK when he was on.
** Same for [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
* Offspring should complete their rooms next.
** They can't complete their uncle's gift-assignment without the knowledge of what their room looks like, and this is a logical step.
** So, you'll need to move the dressers and construct the bunkdesk beds with them.
* [[kicks]]' read-listing and RSS is still on hold. =/. Fek.
* You need to keep trying to sleep. Every ounce you can squeeze between your coughing fits.
** More seltzer.
*** Offspring need to walk and wander. Send them to buy some. Maybe another Goodwill run for them would be useful too.
** Your body is breaking out in hives too. Keep yourself clean.
