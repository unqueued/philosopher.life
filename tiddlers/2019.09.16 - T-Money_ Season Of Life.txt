I'm not up to date on keeping up with photos or what's going on here. I feel the slippage of disconnect. I started a letter months ago it seems and never finished.
SEP 16 7:36 PM
I count on one hand... The people I give a fuck to talk to... Life is a bitch.
SEP 16 7:36 PM
Been a busy few months.

Aye

I take it you are in a season life. Between the interviews, house hunting, getting the boat all set, and taking care of a household, it's a gift to be able to maintain a relationship when we can.
SEP 16 7:38 PM
You might be one of the few people I know who even think, "wait, the connecting is as strong as I want it to be." Miles ahead of most people I know.
SEP 16 7:38 PM
I think you should take your time, especially on the letter.
SEP 16 7:39 PM
isn't* as strong
SEP 16 7:40 PM
I will never have the intellectual connection you have with some. Man nothing are beyond my comprehension. What is not though. Is emotional real interaction.
SEP 16 7:41 PM
Many things are*

Emotional interaction is paradoxical to me; it borders on being difficult and sometimes impossible to put into words, but it's also one of the universal languages; we're all born with it to some extent. It's a gift to connect. I realize I'm not the easiest on that front, and I'm grateful you help your autistic friend out on that front.
SEP 16 7:44 PM
How's your throat?
SEP 16 7:44 PM
Also, have you heard back on the job(s) you interviewed for?
SEP 16 7:44 PM
Dude. I have continued to be turned down for jobs. It seems lockheed martin pay more for helicopter mechanics than scheduler planners.
SEP 16 7:45 PM
Lol
SEP 16 7:45 PM
I refuse to take a pay cut when I currently come and go as I please without reprocuaaion. As long as I have vaca
SEP 16 7:46 PM
Lol.
SEP 16 7:46 PM
I don't blame you.
SEP 16 7:46 PM
Were I working there, I'd prefer the job which respected my need for freetime.
SEP 16 7:47 PM
I think it's a fear of union.
SEP 16 7:50 PM
It's a healthy fear....
SEP 16 7:51 PM
Never have we flexed. But haven't yet needed too. The Healthcare situation is absurd. But it is everywhere.... I dunno.
SEP 16 7:51 PM
Waiting on a breast biopsy from kathys doc by end of week
SEP 16 7:52 PM
Yikes.
SEP 16 7:52 PM
Life may move on.
SEP 16 7:52 PM
Or get turned upside down. Those are 50:50 coins.  You can unjust roll with.
SEP 16 7:52 PM
Ypu just
SEP 16 7:53 PM
I hear that. That is not a skill I've learned well enough.
SEP 16 7:54 PM
Beer helps.
SEP 16 7:55 PM
Reminds me of Daoism, some Bruce Lee quote about water.
SEP 16 7:55 PM
Beer is the life force.
SEP 16 7:55 PM
I drove  home sipping a bud. Had 3 people pull out in front of me. Almost spilled it.
SEP 16 7:56 PM
Hahaha
SEP 16 7:56 PM
I've been on a beer kick as of late too.
SEP 16 7:56 PM
Hopefully, I may get invited to make some moonshine here in a bit.
SEP 16 7:56 PM
Never made it before.
SEP 16 7:56 PM
(I so rarely drink when I drive I feel it funny) many coworker do everyday.
SEP 16 7:57 PM
We had a large jackhammer on a backhoe all day in hanger. Couldn't hear anything.
SEP 16 7:57 PM
Ugh.
SEP 16 7:58 PM
People left early to go get a beer.
SEP 16 7:58 PM
How much ear protection you guys have to wear?
SEP 16 7:58 PM
I imagine it can be insanely loud sometimes.
SEP 16 7:58 PM
It's recommended but not required. I wore most of day due to crazy sound. They are rebuilding tracks hanger doors run in. It's all concrete. Had to endure it all last week. And we thought we were done. Nope ðŸ˜€sunrise this am. Lol
SEP 16 7:59 PM
We are required when it reaches above osha approved levels...  Which isn't always the best way...
