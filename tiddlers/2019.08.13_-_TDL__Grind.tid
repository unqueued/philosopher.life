* Letters and Accutrane
* Continue to go with the flow at work and get to know your children.
* I like that you are going healer in WoW. That is not normally your role, quite the opposite. It would be good to master it.
* Continue convincing and pushing your offspring to do their best.
** 80% is still the goal.
* Ribs?
** Watermelon must be eaten. 
* Read the book alongside your son. Hopefully we'll have something to talk about.
