Have a wonderful Friday!
JUN 14 10:05 AM
You too, sir! =)
JUN 14 10:23 AM
What are you up to?
JUN 14 10:23 AM
Work. Finishing my session, and hang out tonight with my bro. Dnd tomorrow. :)
JUN 14 10:39 AM
That sounds excellent.
JUN 14 10:43 AM
How's your original immediate doing?
JUN 14 10:43 AM
(I don't know what to call it these days. I think of my immediate family as being my wife and kids, but you know... I see my older immediate family as another immediate family)
JUN 14 10:44 AM
So my parents and siblings?
JUN 14 10:45 AM
Yeah.
JUN 14 10:45 AM
My brother chase is living paycheck to paycheck in my parents basement. They’re going to start charging rent so he’ll move out.
JUN 14 10:45 AM
And, how's [[L]] doing? She hasn't really been talking much.
JUN 14 10:46 AM
My sister got a black eye from softball but she’s okay.
JUN 14 10:46 AM
[[L]] has been...struggling.
JUN 14 10:46 AM
But I think she is finally pulling herself out of the pit of Humana depression and trying to escape.
JUN 14 10:46 AM
Depression sucks. Climbing is hard.
JUN 14 10:47 AM
It sounds like times are going to get even harder for Chase.
JUN 14 10:48 AM
Well. He works at McDonald’s and spends all his money on games.
JUN 14 10:48 AM
So it’s a hell of his own making. Lol.
JUN 14 10:48 AM
Mmm...I will agree he is not perfect.
JUN 14 10:49 AM
He’s been there for five months and hasn’t saved a dime. So says my mother.
JUN 14 10:49 AM
That is a mistake.
JUN 14 10:49 AM
Of course, I would have little hope in his shoes. I don't consider the vast majority of his circumstance to be of his own making.
JUN 14 10:50 AM
Most or Chase’s issues are a result of laziness and negligence. Two things I have experience firsthand in my darkest states.
JUN 14 10:52 AM
So I really understand why he struggles.
JUN 14 10:52 AM
I can appreciate that.
JUN 14 10:53 AM
Of** experienced*** words are hard. Haha
JUN 14 10:53 AM
What I don’t understand is that he begged for therapy for the longest one and as soon as he had the opportunity to do so, he turned it down.
JUN 14 10:54 AM
And, perhaps there is an element of learned helplessness in there as well.
JUN 14 10:54 AM
It is expensive to empathize with the mentally ill. That is actually quite common.
JUN 14 10:55 AM
I'll say, if they are trying to get him to move out, he may or may not be able to survive on McDonald's wages.
JUN 14 10:56 AM
The lives of those with only highschool diplomas are getting worse and worse (they have for decades). The demographics look bad at all ages.
JUN 14 10:56 AM
He also refuses to enroll in the community college literally down the road.
JUN 14 10:56 AM
Yeah. You’re right.
JUN 14 10:57 AM
Finding a job that pays a living wage is very difficult these days.
JUN 14 10:57 AM
Even with a college degree.
JUN 14 10:57 AM
I don't know how much your brother understands about the world.
JUN 14 10:57 AM
Me either. Your guess is as good as mine.
JUN 14 10:59 AM
I know his issues are a direct result of our upbringing. I have struggled. My next two brothers have struggled. He is struggling now.
JUN 14 11:00 AM
That's part of it. I look at much larger structures in a society and find most people don't have an interest in his flourishing. He's poor, uneducated, and they only care about him insofar as he is exploitable.
JUN 14 11:02 AM
Entertainment is cheap, but living is quite expensive. We live in times as rough as the great depression, but with better drugs.
JUN 14 11:02 AM
YEP
JUN 14 11:02 AM
I'm not saying there's anything either of us can directly do about the lives of despair people live beyond political action (which still probably won't work, lol). He is partially responsible for the hell he experiences, but not most of it.
JUN 14 11:04 AM
I just wish he would try to get out of it.
JUN 14 11:08 AM
Floundering at McDonald’s won’t do a thing.
JUN 14 11:08 AM
Especially if he isn’t saving money.
JUN 14 11:08 AM
That's true.
JUN 14 11:09 AM
He could always work with my dad doing physical labor. It would pay a lot better. But he doesn’t wanna do it.
JUN 14 11:09 AM
I’m not surprised that he flunked college and doesn’t wanna go back. School’s never been his thing but he doesn’t wanna learn a trade ether.
JUN 14 11:11 AM
Either***
JUN 14 11:11 AM
He literally can’t play Fornite all day.
JUN 14 11:11 AM
Well, I will be giving more thought about [[L]] and Chase. They are lucky to have you.
JUN 14 11:21 AM
Thank you. <3
JUN 14 11:21 AM
[[L]] is truly getting better.
JUN 14 11:21 AM
I’m glad to see how she’s adapting to overcome her odds.
JUN 14 11:22 AM
I am continually impressed by how much you love your family. I don't think most men your age have that much on their shoulders.
JUN 14 11:22 AM
Meh. It’s important to me.
