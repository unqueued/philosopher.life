title: 2018.07.28 - Prompted Introspection: Constitutional Amendment

!! Which amendment to the constitution is the most important to you and why?

I could write a book on what I think about these amendments, about my feelings of the constitution as a dead document, about the fundamental criterion of law (philosophically), about legal positivism, etc. I'm not in a position to answer this question as I'd like to. 

The 1st amendment says something important to me. It's given me insight into [[The Original Position]] a bit more than the others. The amendments form clusters of Hohfeldian rights to me.
