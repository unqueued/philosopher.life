!! Respond to the following:

<<<
Sometimes when I try to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason they could possibly have for saying what they say and doing what they do? Then I ask myself, "How well does that reason explain what they say and what they do?" 

-- Petyr "Little Finger" Baelish

It's a game, right? What's wrong with playing a game? What isn't a game that we play? It's a skill of creating possible worlds and empathizing. 

You have to make assumptions about contingent truths for your possible world game. 

Ah, explanation's force, in this case, is at least partially linked to the coherence of the possible world that is created. Imagine Kant's test of the rationality of the world; it is much like that process in understanding the explanatory force. Empathy Possible Worlds are powerful. 

Guess what? Petyr is right! Don't see you!? It's so fucking obvious that he's right. Regardless of whether or not you agree with the "common parlance" Machiavellian prescriptions he offers, you must accept his description as being wildly accurate in profound ways. He understands his enemy: humanity. Don't you fucking see it? Don't you see this Human God, God of Humans?
