Several years ago, I decided that I wanted to guarantee I could live in a drug-induced experience machine if I needed to. The world sucks, and perhaps the only escape is in my own head. 

Significant Use:

* Alcohol (which I stay away from as best as I can; it is my last resort drug)
* Cannabis
* Deschloroketamine
* Psilocybin Mushrooms

Experimented:

* A variety of nootropics
* Kratom
* Kava
* Nutmeg
* LSA
* LSD (likely 1P-LSD)
* Methamnetamine (not to be confused with meth//amph//etamine)
* Flubromazolam

The Ark:

* Nootropic Powders
** 750g ALCAR
** 25g Noopept

** Diphenidine (5g)
** Diclazepam (50mg)
** Flubromazepam (50mg)

** 35oz Kava

* Pill
** Diclazepam (5mg)
** Norfludiazepam (25mg)
** Diphenihydramine (15g)
