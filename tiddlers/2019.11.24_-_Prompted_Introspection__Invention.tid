title: 2019.11.24 - Prompted Introspection: Invention

!! What would you invent to make life better?

Madcap: [[2018.03.10 - Prompted Introspection Log: Invent]]. I have no idea how to define invention. All the pieces I can see already exist. Perhaps that's the point, but then I would argue inventing is a radically expansive notion. What choice isn't an invention at that point? I like discovery more.
