How goes your day, and how was your weekend?
SEP 16 11:04 AM
Weekend was good and relaxing. Today has been garbage though, but mostly because it is that time of the month. Thankfully I took today off too to focus on finding a new job too. I just wish most of it hadn't been wasted on this.

My coworker also texted me today and said that my boss has basically been MIA since I started my time off last Thursday. Apparently she's hardly logged or done any of the things she said she would. Sounds like returning to work is going to be just dandy. -_-

I'm glad you took today off!
SEP 16 8:58 PM
Sorry it's feeling like a waste.
SEP 16 8:58 PM
What will be the impact on you for her not logging on?
SEP 16 9:02 PM
Gah! Sorry, I missed these. It will probably just mean future stress for me in the form of her rushing to get things done and dragging us into it.

=(
SEP 17 7:25 PM
That sucks.
SEP 17 7:25 PM
It's how she operates, unfortunately. I honestly have no idea how she's been in a manager position like she has for so long.

I am a broken record. The Gervais Principle is worth your time.

Short read, hilarious and scary.
SEP 17 7:27 PM
Shockingly accurate.
SEP 17 7:27 PM
I am sorry you are paying for her choices.
SEP 17 7:27 PM
Oh hey, there's apparently a free web-based version of the book? Interesting.
SEP 17 7:28 PM
It's just why I need out. I am stagnating under her and I am NOT going to let her ruin my career. Not worth it.
SEP 17 7:28 PM
It's a series of blogposts.
SEP 17 7:28 PM
but, the book has some which aren't public, unless they've been released since then.
SEP 17 7:29 PM
ooooooohhhhhh
SEP 17 7:29 PM
It lists those as "ebook extras only"

How's your day been? What are your plans for the weekend?
SEP 20 7:16 PM
My day wasn't bad! My boss has been fairly preoccupied this week so I have been free to do what I want, which is super nice. I also just spent three hours driving to Ohio to hang out with friends.

Noice. I hope it's an excellent day. =)
