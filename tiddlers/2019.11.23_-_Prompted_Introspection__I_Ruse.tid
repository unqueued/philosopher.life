!! What makes you laugh?

Dumb, disgusting, perverted, absurd, childish, faux clever, or competely over-the-line surprises [[irwartfrr]]. You have to tickle me in just the right spot. I milk whatever cows I can find here. My offspring regularly pick out what is [[salient]] here for me. I know that eventually they will grow up and find what I think is funny unacceptable or unfunny in the end (understandably). 

I laugh in some weird places (like any decent crazy person). Sadly, some of what I laugh at is just disturbing.
