!! What is your most invaluable possession and why?

* What counts as a possession? 
* Ah, do you think I'm making the mistake of responding to a question with a stream of questions? 
* What else do you expect from a philosopher?
* Is there a difference between "most invaluable" and "most valuable," and if so what is it and why?
* Why is that question valuable?
* Why is the above question valuable?
* Why is the above question valuable?
* Why is the above...go fuck yourself.

I take a possession to be the target object of some person's or persons' Hohfeldian ownership claim right(s), a molecule of rights reducible to a complex set of atomic claim rights with corresponding duties assigned generally to other people. Problematically, possession comes in degrees and perhaps different kinds, especially under a variety of normative contexts (legal, moral, etc.). Possession, therefore, is a very complex normative concept, and it is likely more inclusive and complex than you imagined. 

Do I possess my children? To the extent and kind that I do, they are clearly it. My wife's and my happiness are instrumentally invaluable qua being a means to my children as my telos. Or, perhaps Eudaimonia is still it. The Good Life in itself, inescapably, is that which I seek above all else. I'm a proper Egoist who understands how the happiness of others is necessary for my happiness. Is this a chicken or egg problem? I don't know. 

Your question comes embedded with serious problems, and it's foundations are unclear. I don't even mean this in some Derridean post-structuralist sense about "There is nothing outside the text" or other equally skeptical problems (although, I take the point here too). There are too many unanswered questions for me to rightfully answer your question.

So, can I //possess// a telos? If so, in that respect, Eudaimonia seems the obvious answer. Maybe there is a difference between saying I "have" a telos and I "possess" a telos. I don't know. There is a sense in which it is perfectly natural to say it is my happiness, and yet there is another sense in which I find it strikingly odd to say I "own" my happiness. I think plenty of people don't have a right to the happiness they enjoy.

What has pure, unified, unconditional intrinsic value? Is it for me only? Is it universal? How universal? Is it particularized to the point absurdity? 

Is this what I believe to be my most valuable possession, or are you asking something more objective? Can it change, and how so?

The question requires a metamodern framework to overcome so many timeless questions, clearly.<<ref "1">> I don't quite have one, other than to attempt to give you a practical answer.<<ref "2">>

Okay, um, so I take my life to be my most invaluable possession.

Oh, you don't like that answer, do you? Maybe you find my answer to be #iamverysmart annoying to you.<<ref "3">> Maybe you think it's cheating? It's sneaky and cheatyfaced, eh? It's kind of like answering "Jesus" in church; you'll get the answer ultimately right at least 50% of the time, but you've somehow evaded the intention of the question's author by piercing too much to the heart of the matter. You were looking for a more concrete, simple, almost relativistically dismissable answer, I suppose. You think that answering the question with some physical object tells the answerer something important about themselves. Well, then my answer seems fine. It says what I mean and tells me about who I really am, right?

Thus ends my first masturbation session in my newly founded [[Prompted Introspection Log]].
