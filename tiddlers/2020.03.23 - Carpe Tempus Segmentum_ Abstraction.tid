* Cleaning
* Dialectures
* Spoon!
* Shopping
** No TP in the store still, but plenty of most everything else.
** Wages have decreased for workers. =/
* Paul doesn't have many teeth. 
** Also, was a car accident.
* [[vidyas]]: Linear Algebra & Sapolsky
** Pretty sure we are all enjoying Sapolsky the most. It's not more gorgeous, but it's more relevant (it appears).
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
** Hopefully, will go smoothly tomorrow.
* [[Abstract Objects]] for [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] with offspring.
** Excellent conversations. 
** Cute watching my offspring take my questions, including managing [[Family: Battle Language]] finger signaling.
** Hoping they'll catch on to the method too.
*** My girl needs to get her machine working. I am going to lose my mind.
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
** Delirious
* A late dinner: Pizza
** Think my daughter prefer thick crust to thin from Aldis
*** Shame she doesn't care as much for Brooklyn style. Probably healthier for her though.
* Played [[Magic]] and Fluxx. 
* Wine
* Tried sleeping by 11:30...didn't really click until 1:30 though. =/
** Also, I forgot to call [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. Fuck.
