* [[Autobiographical Profile/CV|https://www.picassomio.com/alan-falk.html]]
** "Established American artist Alan Falk is recognised for his unique ability to represent with powerful colours a world filled with mythology, biblical scenes and poetry."
** American born in England, 1945, emigrated 1974
** Education: Manchester College of Art & Design + Manchester Polytechnic
** Teaching History: Visiting/Adjunct/Associate/Professor at Portsmouth, Sheffield, Liverpool, Manchester, NYU, SUNY, New York, and Sheridan College.
** "The artist reveals to us in his own words the origins and evolution of his successful artistic career...In 1988 I embarked on a series of wilderness paintings based upon several trips I made to the South West United States. These works became charged with symbolic content and personal mythology dealing with re-discovery and spiritual challenge. As I entered the physical wilderness, I also entered my own 'inner wilderness'. Later, I reintroduced the figure (the central theme of earlier works) as a metaphor for this quest. This focus continued through 1990 to 1997 in a series of digital works based on world mythologies, biblical themes and poetry. These and subsequent works represent a personal quest for an aesthetic purity and balance."
** "My current work is greatly influenced by Judaic texts and prophetic writings. They mirror an interest in a myriad of contemporary topics concerning the human condition as viewed through the prism of personal experience and a maturing vision. Within these new works, religious, personal and contemporary themes and issues coexist side by side."

** Aims to maximize each student's understanding of the fundamental concepts.
** Aims to teach historical insights into major artists and movements.

*** How far does it go beyond offering one's teacher their passwords? 
** Aims to teach a "basic understanding of how to draw, paint, break the rules, and learn to explore the world around you through your own personal vision."
** Extremely optimistic about how far he can teach those willing to work for it.
** Classes specialize in "teaching still-life, the figure, landscape, portraiture and personal artistic development."
** "The first thing every artist needs to learn is the ability to see, and then be able to look at an object or scene or create an idea and understand why it appeals to them visually and how they can express their vision in a way that can be shared with others."

* [[Artist Statement|http://www.alanfalkart.com/Statementpage.html]]
** "In the tradition of great painting, my work is an ongoing quest to define the sublime, the ineffable, and a heartfelt yearning for harmony and spiritual wholeness."
** "My work, which concerns core moral and humanistic values, is informed by diverse texts, prophetic writings, modern theology and history and contemporary socio-political references."
** "Integrity, ethical dilemma, parables on mortality and the need for spiritual connection link the lessons of my heritage to present-day concerns."
** "Through my allegorical and poetic visual language, expressed through thematic vibrant color, expressive line, and dedication to creating aesthetically whole works, I explore the theme of the subject. Personal intuition and free-association form the foundation of my creative expression."

** [[Between Two Worlds|https://www.zip06.com/living/20200213/between-two-worlds-art-exhibit-by-alan-falk]]
*** "Between Two Worlds, is Falk’s exploration of the romantic and magical aspects of love and the search for the sublime."
*** "These are contrasting narratives—one is physical, earthbound, and rich in the abundance of life, whilst the other is spiritual, soulful, and weighed down by tragedy and death—yet in both, unconditional love prevails over all challenges. Falk’s works seeks to direct viewers toward the unity attained by the lovers as they transcend their duality through acts of love."

** What do you want from this teacher?
*** Were I in your shoes:
**** I'd build a friendship+mentorship with him. Have fun with him. 
**** I'd seek to learn the fundamentals in practice with him, break his rule concerning imitation (it may be a significant point of friction), learn how to find at least parts of the bridges between the analog and digital with him, and develop a significant language to discuss theory with him (including philosophical, religious, political, and personal channels).
***** I'd go easy on him in dialectics (you'll note that I tried to not even hint at disagreement with him, especially in my own areas of interest). You've been sealed in a low-oxygen room with a madman your entire life at 5G's, and you are mutant freak because of it (my fault). He might not be ready or be able to take what you're serving up. As you point out, the other artists you know can't stand in the pocket trading blows like you can (it's a surefire way to be hated by most too). He wasn't raised to have what you have, and you must take that into account when you wrestle. Go 110% against me, but go 30% against him (at least to begin with).
****** Further, recall that his elderly mind has crystallized (it's actually deteriorating outside of vocabulary aptitude). He is unlikely to be open to fundamentally changing. You are the plastic pupil. Sponge and wrestle wisely.
**** I'd work to make sure he had every chance to see your competencies in a variety of areas. He has never had a student quite like you, and you are going to have to show off.
**** Maximize the value of the windows of time in which you have his direct attention with significant outside preparation and thoroughness.
***** An exceptionally thorough, [[antipleonasmic]], and well-worded Conceptual Analysis of the fundamentals with examples and the works can be done outside. Dive deep; you know how to survive in many oceans. Trivialize this problem for him and narrow the space to practical practice.
***** I'd begin every two weeks and ramp into every week.
****** Give yourself time to procrastinate, diffuse, wander, digest, and marinate. The virtue-theoretic properties can be practiced between large gaps. Let him see you reveal your evolution before his eyes.
**** Might as well begin working on drawn pieces that can do what the rest of his students can do. Make it a progression, sequence, or portfolio of improvement of that thing.
***** I'd try for different styles of the same object, a tree of attempts.
