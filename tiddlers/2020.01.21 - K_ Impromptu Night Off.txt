[8:01 PM] h0p3: You have a good weekend, homie?
[8:45 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yeah. Fun and relaxing. :slight_smile: how about you?
[8:53 PM] h0p3: It was good. Still piecing everything together, buying things we are missing (hopefully, will have another vehicle here soon)
[8:59 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Fingers crossed. Got everything moved in?
[9:15 PM] h0p3: Most everything is in the correct room.
[9:15 PM] h0p3: Just got couches tonight, but haven't moved them upstairs.
[9:35 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Moving is a process. :joy::eyes:

[10:01 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Have a great day!
[11:33 AM] h0p3: :slight_smile:
[11:33 AM] h0p3: You too
[11:35 AM] Ardent_Assailant: What are you up to today?
[11:37 AM] h0p3: Cleaning, organizing, reading and writing.
[11:41 AM] h0p3: How about you?
[11:41 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Work, brainstorming, seeing some friends later. I have a session this weekend I need to prep for.

[9:49 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Hope you have a good day today! Are you feeling any better?
[9:57 AM] h0p3: 2 steps foward, 1 back. Feeling better, but still sometimes a useless lump, lol.
[9:57 AM] h0p3: Hope you have a good one as well.
[9:57 AM] h0p3: You have a good time with your friends?
[10:02 AM] Ardent_Assailant: That’s never fun, but progress is progress nevertheless.
[10:03 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Not too bad. We’re already getting busier again. Hoping that things chill soon.
[10:05 AM] h0p3: Aye. Hope it chills for you too.
[11:44 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Fingers crossed. Got an impromptu night off. Gonna take it easy hopefully.
[11:44 AM] Ardent_Assailant: How are [[k0sh3k]] and the kids doing?
[11:54 AM] h0p3: Nice. They send you home from work?
[11:55 AM] h0p3: I think we are all still adjusting. Kids have been okay. Lazy, as usual.
[11:56 AM] h0p3: [[k0sh3k]] seems to fit in well, and she's not coming home absolutely exhausted. It's sane, and they seem to treat her right.
[11:57 AM] Ardent_Assailant: We had evening plans but they fell through. That’s wonderful to hear! I’m glad she loves her job!
