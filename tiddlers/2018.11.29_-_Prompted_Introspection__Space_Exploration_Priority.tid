title: 2018.11.29 - Prompted Introspection: Space Exploration Priority

!! If you were the ruler of the planet, how would you handle space exploration?

As much as I'd love to visit space, which I've said many times, it is abundantly clear to me that those who seek to engage in space exploration have completely avoided the crisis of capitalism on our planet. I [[Straussian]]ly suggest they do so on purpose. If we can't make Ear//f// habitable, why the fuck would any other planet or space be reasonable? What does exploration buy us? Zero-G scientific experimentation and astrophysics that study the structure of the universe are reasonable, but I find space exploration with humans to be a complete fucking waste of time and resources. Space exploration is misdirection. It is a coldwar tool. It is retarded or evil at this point.

I'd have much, much bigger fish to fry than space exploration.
