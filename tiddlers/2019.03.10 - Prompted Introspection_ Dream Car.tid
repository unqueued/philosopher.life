title: 2019.03.10 - Prompted Introspection: Dream Car

!! If money wasn't an issue, what car(s) would you have?

Lady Melisandre, you fulfill every manboy's dreams. I am reminded of living next to Fort Knox and being a soldier in pretend games with my brother in our room. God damn, we lived in our own worlds. It's fascinating to see my ability to simulate harnessed, call it a dreamyverse, Rick: self-slavery with extra steps. Clearly, I value the autonomy of making ourselves, and the [[phenomenology]] of simulating in imagination for ourselves toward reality, even if only via constructing our reality maps as wisely as possible. You do give me perspective. 

Alright, the conventional answer will be a station wagon, probably a Volvo. The still somewhat conventional cheese answer will be a very expensive car I sell to buy what matters. I can talk about amphibious flying cars too. Of course, why not just build the communist utopia car?
