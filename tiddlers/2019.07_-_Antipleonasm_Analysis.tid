!! Audit:

* I have three interlocutors in here. That is uncommon for me. They conjure very different moods out of me.
** [[Saint Chomsky]] is rarely too hyperbolic, and he supports his claims differently. Like 1984, he's required reading. 
** Sir Voltaire has a way with words. Like Nietzsche, he's can deliver [[antipleonasms]], and they are fun to disentangle.
*** I didn't really learn much though. He still got me to say something though.
** Sir [[Zizek]] is a beast. He is by the most dangerous opponent I have faced. [[Ayn Rand]] required some tentpegs deep in the desert, but [[Zizek]] is actually doing philosophy. I think he'd hate a lot of what I'd have to say, and that's okay. I'm grateful for the opportunity to reason about his words.
* I've been writing longer answers than usual, I believe. It feels like it.
* I'm grateful for the chance to be careful or not careful in the occasion. 
* I'm preachy AF here. Yup, you gotta do it in philosophy.
* One of the strengths of doing this here rather than on public forums is that I actually get to say what I think given what I have, know, and name. Translation and connecting enough dots is infeasible all too often.
* I have massive disagreements with Ziz in psychology, ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, but not as much in politics.
* I'm having responding to Ziz. He likes jokes, and I don't mind being an asshole with him.
** I admire how much he understands too.
** He aims for the unconditional. =)
* Lots of discussion of faith across the board. Voltaire requires it.
* I ripped Voltaire apart.
* Tons of recursion in here.
* As usual, I keep hearing the echoes of Saints Plato and Aristotle. 
* My offspring have been wrestling with some of these as well.
* I am at war. Good job!
