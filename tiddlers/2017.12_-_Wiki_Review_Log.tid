!! Audit:

* I'm not sure what to do about the fact that some of my links become dead after renaming. It is what it is, I suppose. 
** Perhaps this can be fixed programmatically, although I don't see a good option for it in Tiddlywiki. They do it with tags, but not in the actual linking. I wish they did.
** This can also be handled with my daily snapshots.
* I clearly did way more work early in the month. It started to wane very hard, but I also was quite busy, imho.
* This monthly audit doesn't seem so bad to me.
* [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]] is exactly what I was hoping it would be as a directory description.
* I felt like I dived deep. I did a lot of work. I'm glad. I noticed that I needed to slow down, and I did. That's okay that I felt less productive; I meant to!
* It is interesting to see the interplay between this and my [[Wiki Audit Log]]. Some days were focused on adding completely new content, while others were about digestion.
** Sometimes I feel like I'm adding more than I should be compared to my revisions. It's hard to tell. 
* Jesus. Looking back over this, I can see I did so much work. It is getting cleaned up. I've been failing in my audits, but still doing a lot each day.
** I think the more I clean this up, the easier it is to work on it. 
* I clearly struggled once I hit {[[Vault]]}. I'm just not ready to write that section fully. But, I'm glad to start creating a skeleton.
** Perhaps in the next decade or so I will be able to write this section out fully.
* I feel like some of the problems I bring up are just trapped in my comments like I fire and forget.
* I love my title.Titles. 
* I spend time soothing myself in these comments.
* Carpe Diem content spills into this, and I think that is fine.
* D-D-D-D-Ditto
* This is such a fast log to do. I'm still glad I do it. I think it is good for my memory + narrative. 
* The one-worders annoy me at the end of the month, except when I'm being extremely expressive in a single word.
* I can see the shotgun approach in action. I need to remember that a lot of this just is trash, and that's totally normal. I can only tune it so high, and at some point, I just need to accept that revision is about wading through the trash to find the diamonds and redpills. 
* My head started hurting about halfway into the month, around job application time.
* I'm amazed that my {[[About]]} project isn't more clearly demonstrated here.
** But, I only cover [[New]]. Hrmm... This process doesn't have everything I really need.
* My [[Computing]] section has improved dramatically, and it allows me to have better habits.
* Tons of sexual content.
