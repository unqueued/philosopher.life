I need to go through my books, highlight everything, and read the chapters this weekend. It's important that I smash through it. There is a possibility that my teacher will be expecting me to take the exams on Monday and Tuesday, and I want to complete them. 

I will focus on making a couple tools and dropping my roots. I need to get my stick welding up to snuff. I want to weld and fit!
