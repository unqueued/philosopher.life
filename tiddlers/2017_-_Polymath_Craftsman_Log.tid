!! Audit:

* Lol. I don't even have audits for these. The notion of auditing wasn't even fully developed. I was first just building the constructive practices necessary to have anything to say in the first place. I'm proud of this seed.
* I've actually had to use the log to recreate a summary of my work experience. I'm glad I had it!
* As usual, with my yearly audits, it's like reliving everything all in a short span of time.
* I fear I have lost much of what I've learned about pipefitting over the past year. That's okay though. I believe I can relearn it, and I would know where to turn for it. 
* My focus on theory was probably the only way to get my foot in the door, but I'm also very pleased to have had the experience. That's how I was able to push anything into the virtue-theoretic Fastmind.
* I spent far more time writing about this initially than I do today. I'm glad I did though. It helped me dive in. Today, many people think I'm just one of them, which is exactly what I need. I need to blend.
* The class was poorly made. I believe I could have been taught the majority of the information I needed in the space of 2 weeks. The practice, well, that I needed months of.
** People were extremely lazy in that setting (as they are in all, I suppose).
* Chris was an eye-opener for me. I'm grateful to have met him.
* I love using the grinder. I feel adept with it.
* It's sad to see that I was fed a line of bullshit about the UA fitters. It's useful though, since now I am trying to walk into the IBEW with open eyes, the appropriate amount of mistrust, and the willingness to find greener pastures if necessary.
* I'm glad that I showed up even when no one else did.
* Welding practice was awesome. I may not be a great welder, but my stick welds could pass inspections. I'd need to practice up a bit, and I'd need a grinder, but I could do it. I feel like I picked up that skill "for free" kind of as I worked through the program. I'm very pleased to have had the opportunity.
* Happy to take AB&T's money; Johanna was a neolib/conservative asshole. I'm glad she's losing her job.
* I totally forgot about the torch.
* I eventually stopped caring so much about the bookwork, although I did pick up books that I cared about. I like having the hacks.
* I really ended up giving up on pipefitting at the end. I'm glad I did.
* Ah, I started auditing in April. It has been a useful practice to me.
* Basically, I've had a somewhat functioning wiki for about a year now.
* It's interesting to see how I've come to understand the role of my autism in regards to my professional relationships.
* I'm glad I went to school, since it was the introduction to a set of industries for me that I probably could have no acquired otherwise. I'm also glad to be learning on the job now.
* I still haven't learned my lesson to not discuss politics with those around me. They truly can't appreciate my point of view, and I need to stop telling myself there is a hope that they can.
* I'm very glad I get paid to learn now.
* I've been sore and losing weight for quite a while now.
* The torque class didn't need to take so long, but I'm glad I understand it.
* It turns out that it was worth my time to continue to look into drug-testing.
* I was right to want to become vested in multiple organizations. I hope to continue doing so.
* I did plan ahead decently enough. I'm still trying to put it together. I can see I also like having a "program" to go through where I don't have to do all the planning. I believe this is part of my executive functioning disorder as an autist. 
* I picked up a really decent set of tools from AB&T. With my own money, I feel like I've rounded it out fairly well.
* I was extremely stressed on my first job. I'm glad to have survived it.
** I'm grateful to have worked with Jaye (Jihad)
** That was more stressful than it had to be. It was like being burned alive.
** We were under significant financial stresses at the time. I simply couldn't afford to fail or get fired, and I was underequipped. I'm really proud of myself.
** Terry was a profound dick. Fuck him. I'm glad his body is breaking down; he deserves it.
* I'm glad we got our phones. This has been very useful to us.
* I'm continually depressed by how little contractors give a shit about worker safety.
* I can see the goal is to not demonstrate my ignorance to my foreman as best as possible.
* The jump from commercial to industrial fitting was a big one. I'm glad to have had the experience.
* We desperately needed the money. I'm glad to have made as much as we did. It dug us out of a hole.
* I do not like the socializing aspects of these jobs at all: surprise!
* I'm pleased to see that I have had good ideas that people listen to and use from time to time. I'm new at this. I think in time, my creativity will become even more useful.
* Baptized by fire, and I feel so much more comfortable starting at the bottom rung. I feel like I'm not completely clueless and green now. 
* There is a lot of wasted time in my Industrial job. 
* These jobs all felt dystopian.
* Every job has its own kind of clusterfuckedness going on. 
* It was interesting to work with so many fitter who came out of my program.
* I continue to see that literacy is a redflag to these people.
* I'm glad that I've realized the extent to which I need to be able to type on the job. Taking notes has been super useful to me.
* My move to electrician has been a long time in the making.
* Will I always have a "grass is always greener" mentality?
** This has been enormously useful to me in video games.
* I hate how much these jobs are more about controlling perceptions than anything else; it's not even perception of the truth. That is humanity though.
* I'm really glad I've become a toolporn addict. I hope to continue this trend. It's been a very good thing that I continue to invest in my professional life. I wish I told about this from the beginning.
* It's been interesting to see that pipefitter work is damned hard to find in my area. I'm really stuck out here.
* I ended up not going into pipefitting more directly. I'm glad I spent my time on my children instead.
* I'm pleased to have switched to the craftsman goal. I actually had said that to my teacher, Tim, when I first started pipefitting.
* The year seems harsh, bittersweet, and difficult. I wouldn't want to live it again, but I'm glad I made it through. I learned a lot.
