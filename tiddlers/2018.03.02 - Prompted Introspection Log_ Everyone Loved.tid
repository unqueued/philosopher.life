title: 2018.03.02 - Prompted Introspection Log: Everyone Loved

!! I wish everyone loved......

Wisdom. I wish everyone //truly// loved wisdom. I want them to be philosophical, to be practical in applying it, to be moved by it, to constitute themselves by it, to construct and deconstruct the world and themselves with it. I wish everyone pursued relevant truth. It is the foundation of being a good person. The world would be a radically better and better place if everyone did as well. Why do you think I chose to be a philosopher? 

Admittedly, the opportunity costs of pursuing academic philosophy have been tremendous, and in other circumstances, I could have pursued philosophy without having given up so much otherwise. I will continue to try to be a man of integrity, even when it seems no one else does.
