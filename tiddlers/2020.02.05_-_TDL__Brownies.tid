* [[Recent Obsessions]]
** Yup. You need to rock.
* [[Wiki Audit]]
** Let's try to begin [[The Remodeling]] again.
** Won't need to switch modes until next [[Monthly Audit]].
* Wife wants pasta
* Perhaps we should move to voice in the household. They are going to want to spend their time at their desks more and more maybe. =/
** Human contact is pretty damn important though.
** It has been a long time since I've allowed such a thing on my primary device. 
** Practicing remote is going to be necessary for them. We need to make it a second-nature process.
*** They also might need to set up some things. I have no idea how much.
* Buy missing pieces for various boxes in the house. 
** Daughter will need to strike things off the list.
* Need to set Bluebird balances correctly.
* We need to make a fuckton of brownies for our neighbors. Introduce ourselves.
** Afterward, I would like to eventually start inviting people over for dinner.
*** This neighborhood is difficult. Even worse than our last apartments, many people barely even live in their homes, or so it seems. It's so blank feeling so often.
* We need to mail that noif off. Money will wait, as will a letter.
