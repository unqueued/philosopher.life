When I walk up to strangers, I make the prediction they are not good persons because that is what my experience has demonstrated. Of course, acknowledging it is prediction necessitates doubt and being open to the possibility they are a good person. This is [[T42T]] territory. In fact, I'm going to be wrong many times all the way down. I can only ever improve my modeling. It's really hard work.

Koorsgaard and many moral philosophers who attempt to define agency speak of the privation of [[The Good]] or [[The Right]] of an otherwise sapient-appearing Dasein as definitionally lacking agency. This coherentist position falls flat and lacks a [[salient]]ly justifying [[Foundation]]. On such a view, you cannot constitute yourself as an evil agent. On that view, evil, to some [[dok]], necessitates the lack of agency, personhood, dignity, and that which merits respect. There is both something right and wrong about it.

If there is [[good]] constitution, then there is bad constitution. We have to deconstruct and construct. You cannot have one without the other; it's conceptually impossible (though, that is not to say [[The Dialetheia]] is privatized to [[Itself]] in any way).

My counteroffer is an inspection of the unforgivable sin. How do you know when an evil agent cannot redeem themselves? Absolute privation, evil in toto. But, if you believe in radical freedom, if you think they are turing complete (or more) and sufficiently mutable, it seems as though, at any given timeslice, there are timelines in which many evil agents can become the Koorsgaardian agent. Not all costs can be paid, but it appears that sometimes we must sacrifice in [[T42T]] because we owe those possible future moral agents which functionally can arise from an evil agent. There is a moral obligation to future possible agents in some cases. Perhaps this is an emerging or virtualized autonomy that sits on top of what is functionally not a person.

Note, of course, this would have enormous impact on how we can understand how human lives can become living persons. What is justified and tolerant line of inclusivity? How can we fairly draw it?
