title: 2019.09.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Soon Enough

* Woke at 10
** Half-brained, terrible sleep. Jesus.
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* Brunch with family, grits and eggs. Yum.
* Read+Write
* Watching political junk on the youtubes.
** What have I become? OMG. Kill me now. Soon enough, I will be ranting about politics on a blog or something.
* Guy stopped by to clean out the dryer vents for the apartments.
** I forgot to offer him something to eat and drink. 
* Work
** My offspring texted me that a crew came in to clean the chimney, but we have never used it. They said it was too cramped in here to take a peak anyway (it's true, lol). My daughter told me as they were leaving, they started to notice the uncut sheet of magic cards, my [[monster]]'s motherboard on the wall, and my computer. They told my offspring they were lucky to be homeschooled by such cool parents (oh yes, you see, my mad skillz in geekdom have always made me cool, especially a cool parent); it's nice to have someone confirm that they have some luck in their lives.
*** They were surprised the kids knew how to play. They should have offered them a game on the spot. Gobbos. You'd need to be a real Legacy player to beat them consistently (at least before we stopped practicing).
**** Speaking of which, my guildies play magic. But, they do not play eternal, just EDH (understandably).
* Chatted with [[GB]]
* Spoke with [[JRE]]
* Rice Pilaf, berries, fruit
* WoW
* Read+Write
* I feel like I didn't get enough time with my wife at all today.
* Tried sleeping at 3...but...no idea.
