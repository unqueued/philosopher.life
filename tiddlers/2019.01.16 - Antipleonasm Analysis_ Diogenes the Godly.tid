My god, that quote is perfect. Jesus' failure will always be in the retaliatory aspect of [[T42T]].<<ref "r">> Eye of the needle, flip some fucking tables, yeah, yeah. You could not have predicted thousands of years (yes, I know how far that Trinitarian rabbithole goes), and I don't blame you, ya' Son of a BITCH!

[[Saint Diogenesocrates]], I'm gonna suck the wisdom straight out of your dick. I will not spit it out on the floor, and I'm not much for snowballing (no matter how much the wealthy need wisdom). No, I need to keep it; I'm a good swallower. Those greeks were hilarious.

Alright, homage rhetoric aside (which is difficult to do given how the quote is a master stroke), I adore how it assigns moral responsibility, licenses us, and defines what matters. Few men ever handed Saint Plato's ass to him.
