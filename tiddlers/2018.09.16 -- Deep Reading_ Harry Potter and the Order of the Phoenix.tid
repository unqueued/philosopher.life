I wish there were Dumbledores in this world. I love that someone so powerful really aims to be so a good person. I think there are Mrs. Weasleys in the world, but no Dumbledores.

The "impressiveness" of HP's magic doesn't actually jive with the impressive things which Dumblore and Voldemort (et al) accomplish at the same age. 

I don't quite see why Dumbledore is a teacher instead of a fiercesome force in the world doing things. 

I'm annoyed that Dolores is ugly. It's the pathetic fallacy in literature grafted onto humans (or, there is probably a well-known word for this). Evil is far more alluring.

The lack of interest in the truth is always discouraging.

`Witch Hunt` could not be more literal.

Full court is some bullshit. =)

The status positioning thing is odd.
