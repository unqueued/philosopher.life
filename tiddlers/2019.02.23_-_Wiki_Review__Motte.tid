title: 2019.02.23 - Wiki Review: Motte

* [[TLDR]]
** I have no idea if this is a good idea. Is this for me? Abstracts only go so far. Elevator speeches are rhetorical devices which I aim to use judiciously. Frankly, place is insanity for most people. I can't undo that.<<ref "2020.02.25-1">>
*** I need advice.
* [[2019.02.22 - JRE: Sounds Off]]
** He really is sounding off. I'm concerned. What can I do to help him? I keep calling him up. He doesn't answer half the time.<<ref "2020.02.25-2">>
* [[2019.02.22 - BDS97: Dewdrop]]
** It's interesting to see us cover ground we've been covering for years in different ways. I think he's slowly coming around.
* [[2019.02.22 - Afterschool Teaching: Dictionaries]]
** No writing, but I got some good work done. 
** Those fatherless boys have me.<<ref "2020.02.25-3">>
* [[2019.02.22 - Trove Yapok: The wiki/project]]
** I need to respond. This was out of the blue. Admittedly, I'm pretty concerned I'm being trolled here. Regardless, I am going to respond kindly!<<ref "2020.02.25-4">>
* [[Trove Yapok]]
** Furry? Probably. Cool.
* [[2019.02.22 - Be A Good Dad: Programmatic]]
** We talked about more. I can't remember what it was.
* [[2019.02.22 - MPXN: First Contact]]
** Apparently, I am a weirdo. Surprise!
* [[MPXN]]
** Reminds me of a research chemical (a powerful one).
* [[2019.02.22 - Wiki Audit: TW5Nav Woes]]
** It's halfway working. I can't wait to hook it up to [[Sphygmus]] button concepts.<<ref "2020.02.25-5">>
* [[2019.02.22 - Link Log: Hmm]]
** Uh, I didn't get jack shit done.
* [[2019.02.22 - Wiki Review: Not Cool]]
** I really haven't had my act together. I need to start doing the core daily earlier.
* [[2019.02.22 - Prompted Introspection: Flower Gift]]
** I'm so embarrassed that I can't remember her name. It is on the tip of my tongue. Schizotypal aging FTL.
* [[2019.02.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: CÃ¢mara Mara]]
** Edited.
** I'm not that good of a person (though I hope to be one day). I can see he's right.
* [[2019.02.22 - Self-Dialectic: Doorways]]
** This is something TW does really well overall. I'm not sure how to maximize it.

<<footnotes "2020.02.25-4" "You got me. I realize that I open myself up to trolling in a profound way. Such is the life of staying in a barrel in the market.">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.25-5" "Ugh. The TW5Nav experiment failed. I'm glad I tried. It helped me better understand what I'm doing in the wiki. I'm sad to see it didn't work out, ofc.">>
