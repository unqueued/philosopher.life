!! Audit:

* Reading Stunning!, Preach, yo!, and KYS is often quite interesting to me.
* I've really slowed down on my information consumption here. 
* I was working a lot.
* I'm pleased to see SCWRing hard.
* I lost a large stack of links, sadly. I need to make sure that doesn't happen. I'm wondering if I should just start cleaning it out daily. A "linkdump" at the end, past SCWR. That's a good idea.
