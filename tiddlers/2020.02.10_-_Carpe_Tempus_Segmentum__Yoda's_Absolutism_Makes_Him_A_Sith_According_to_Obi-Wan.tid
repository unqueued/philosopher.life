* Woke at 10:30
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* Set offspring on task 
* Set up appointments.
** Fuck yeah! 
** Unfortunately, we can't get them on the same day. 
*** Will be an opportunity for my offspring to begin to take over their own healthcare. We have a lot to talk about.
* Offspring did not take off this morning. =/
* Dialectures
* Mic is set, though it wants to slip at the mount-point.
** Son and I hacked something together. Might work.
* Daughter's laptop started freezing. 
** Probably not a memory error from the tests.

** Plenty of work she never did is coming back to bite her.
* Dialectures

* First electric bill: $690. Holy mother of god. wtf is that? I've only had a higher bill in Thailand, roflmao.
** I mean, it's the only bill for the entire house, but that's still insane.
** We're good with lights. Can more aggressively bootdown machines.
** Heat for house and water seem the most likely culprits to me. 
*** Down to 55 degrees now instead of 65. That should do something. 
** Maybe I should test? That just seems so crazy high. Need to ask neighbors too.
* Made dinner with muh wife.
* Salad, Beans and Rice
* //Battlestar Galactica//
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4?
