Are you genuinely open to the possibility that significant sections of your [[reality map]] are inaccurate, wrong, and even detrimental? No? Okay, we have nothing to talk about.<<ref "2018.12.24">>

Forced into a corporate scheme. System working as intended. Small business equals the only real path for working class upward mobility under our current system. Gotta close that loophole and make every single worker fight for a shrinking pool of corporate jobs, thus keeping wages low for another business cycle.

The Federal Reserve manipulates the economy to guarantee some minimum level of unemployment in order to keep the status quo as stable as possible.

We are the casualties of deindustrialization, automation, etc.

SUMMARY

* Procrastination is our voluntary delay of an intended action.
* Not all delay is procrastination.
* In order to overcome procrastination, we need to understand our reluctance to act when it is in our best interest. e.g. anxiety, perfectionism etc

IDEAS

* Categorise which delays in your life are procrastination.
* Make “pre-decisions” using implantation intentions.
* Just get started (tell yourself you only have to do 5mins or a small portion of the task).
* When working online, block distracting websites. e.g. Facebook, Instagram etc. Google Chrome has a plugin called StayFocused.
* Use willpower strategically. Not everything is a priority, not everything needs to be done.

Freudian dogma revolves...[around] the conflicting feelings of love and hate that we all carry concerning the people closest to us

Understanding the proof is far different from being able to find the proof. 

I see so many people who ask their term-paper question on reddit. Lol. Yeah, you got the right answer kid. You even understood it. But, you didn't earn it. In a lot of cases, not earning really doesn't matter. However, to some extent, it does in the case. Essentially, being the kind of person who has struggled to find the answer is super fucking important. It defines your character. When nobody can answer the question for you, when reddit fails, are you going to be able to find the answer for yourself? How much practice have you had? What kind of person are you? ... Don't you see the problem? So, I'm not fully against it, but I think it is something we need to be mindful of.

 If I asked my brother for $1k, I think he'd give it to me. He legitimately loves me. $1k is likely 80% of a paycheck for him. I'd be asking him to sacrifice at least 4 days of his effort for that money. If I asked my brother to read my wiki for 4 days, that would be out of the question. In fact, I think even asking him to read it for 4 hours would be beyond his willingness to give. He will spend his time in one case, but not the other. That is an interesting asymmetry, but I do not think it is irrational. He clearly sees the value in one and not in the other. He understands the opportunity cost, the cost-benefit ratio. This is not a poorly understood economic decision to him. And he is quite rational. Thus, you have your answer.

I think I put my brother in an awkward position. To approve or validate the contents of this wiki, to accept its value in solving my problem, he is faced (because I have the tendency to ask) why he wouldn't use such a tool himself. That is far too costly, I realize.

We reduce our social connections to mere threads so that we can maintain as many of them as possible. This leaves us with signposts of familiarity that are frail remnants of the real thing...This can lead to a problem; namely that we become increasingly vulnerable to imposters

I've cracked the code (or, I think Julian Jaynes was fundamentally onto it). I am completely convinced that what people take to be spiritual experiences, especially, for example, being Slain in the Spirit, or feeling God talking to you, or feeling "moved by the holy ghost," etc. really is just us listening to our non-conscious minds. It is presented to us phenomenologically as that, but it is reducible too something far different in causal reality.

It is so perfectly obvious that evolution is selecting for increasingly effective psychopaths. It is a fact that humans are in predation with each other, in so many profound ways. Romanticists, when will you learn that nature is evil? Lol.
