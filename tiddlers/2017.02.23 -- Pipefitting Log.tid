We've been working on X-piece-90's. It is so much easier without Nash. I love Thursdays since I'm the only one in the shop. Everyone else has computer or bookwork they choose to barely work on. I have the shop to myself, except when I absolutely need another pair of hands (welding and sometimes marking). I finished two projects in a day. That is relatively uncommon for me.
