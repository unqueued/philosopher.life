Ahoy!

I've come across your wiki, and I've waded in a bit.

I resonate with your Axioms. I too seek to find the others. I believe that most people are capable of great generosity and goodness when given the opportunity and the inspiration, but there are assholes out there too.

I engage firmly and gently from a place of vast patience, radical generosity and maximum reading-between-the-lines-and-listening-through-communication-to-the-meaning-insideyness.

I have no clear picture of the dok of our cooperation, engagement, malarkey, shenanigans or tomfoolery as we move forward, but I certainly felt compelled to begin the discovery process in that direction.

At the Oracle's alter I place as tribute a measly typo spotted, a single missing letter, as small a contribution as possibly possible, as both an offering of goodwill and as hopefully the first of many contributions to the mind I have but glimpsed through a dozen of your pages. 

On https://philosopher.life/#Tit%20For%20Two%20Tats, "mutally" should be "mutually"

Humbly, I offer you what your whole wiki is dedicated to discovering: 'u' ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Onward and upward,

James üöÄ
