How's your day going?
MAY 1 12:35 PM
Pretty good —got accepted into that master’s program—hopefully I can start this summer
MAY 1 1:12 PM
Noice. Congratz, and I hope so too. That would be awesome.
MAY 1 1:12 PM
And I have an appointment tomorrow with the cardiologist to talk about a nerve ablation
MAY 1 1:13 PM
Hows ur day?
MAY 1 1:13 PM
Nice. You will have to let me know what the cardiologist says. It would be sweet to be able to fix or mitigate it.
MAY 1 1:14 PM
Yes yes it would
MAY 1 1:14 PM
It goes. I'm in the middle of [[Monthly Auditable]] [[Log Audit]]s. It's an important practice for me. I read as I write, I [[Review]], I read again in [[Family Time]], I cover most of the territory again in [[Monthly Auditable]], [[The Remodeling]] of [[Wiki Audit]] is a distant look (and hopefully continuous re-evaluation), and my searches (super common for [[Prompted Introspection]], [[Computer Musings]], and letter writing in [[FTO]]) are another route. This is the repetition of burning things into my memory and thinking about it from multiple angles.

Uncle John has been very excited about DNA stuff...he called me and talked for an hour about it
MAY 1 1:16 PM
I heard, lol.
MAY 1 1:17 PM
Will you be doing that?
MAY 1 1:17 PM
I have actually—wondering about my paternal side—it would be nice to at least have medical info
MAY 1 1:18 PM
I can appreciate that.
MAY 1 1:18 PM
My search has not been fruitful yet but with John taking it, it has been easier
MAY 1 1:18 PM
I can eliminate all of the ones he and I have in common
MAY 1 1:19 PM
He also has a theory about Gma Lois....
MAY 1 1:19 PM
I am not knowledgeable enough in the topic.
MAY 1 1:19 PM
What's his theory?
MAY 1 1:19 PM
Gma Lois had two sisters...Thelma and Mary
MAY 1 1:20 PM
I think I met Thelma once, maybe.
MAY 1 1:20 PM
Theoretically—John should have as many markers in common with Thelma’s kid as he does with Mary’s kids
MAY 1 1:21 PM
And they should have the same # of common markers with each other (being first cousins)
MAY 1 1:22 PM
John’s are much lower than the other cousins to each other
MAY 1 1:23 PM
And mine are too
MAY 1 1:23 PM
It’s almost like Gma Lois was adopted/raised by her aunt
MAY 1 1:24 PM
It’s weird
MAY 1 1:24 PM
I have no idea. I wouldn't be surprised. Quiet adoption and plenty of borderline-incest on that side of the tree, if I understand correctly.
MAY 1 1:25 PM
Yes and people didn’t talk about it —she herself may not have known
MAY 1 1:25 PM
If Gma Lois had her way —I would not have known
MAY 1 1:26 PM
I am glad you know.
MAY 1 1:26 PM
The Boomers are looking to the past for their meaning; it's a bad sign.
MAY 1 1:26 PM
I am not looking for meaning necessarily—it’s just interesting
MAY 1 1:27 PM
I will say though —breast cancer runs rampant with Gma’s 2 sisters and there daughters and even grand daughters —but we haven’t had any
MAY 1 1:28 PM
I can appreciate the medical concern quite a bit, as well have having evidence for the beliefs about the narratives you've been told.
MAY 1 1:29 PM
If you are strongly considering it, and if you are concerned about privacy and anonymity (I am!), give me another chance to look for options for you. Everything I have seen has been an abject failure on that front so far (I'm also quite doubtful I can find any solid option, but I would try).
MAY 1 1:29 PM
It’s ok —I was interested in what nationality and medical stuff not necessarily forming relationships. I am not sure how or if I will pursue more
MAY 1 1:30 PM
Thank you though
MAY 1 1:30 PM
I did find that I am almost 1/2 Italian so there at least is a start
MAY 1 1:31 PM
You must try perfecting breadsticks. Maybe your chemistry training will make revolutionize it. (I'm hungry, lol)
MAY 1 1:34 PM
Hehe woot!
MAY 1 1:37 PM
I love breadsticks :baguette_bread:
