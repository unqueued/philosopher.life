title: 2017.09.20 - Pipefitting Log

We jumped straight into our stainless project. Setup took a while. I beveled a pipe, cleaned up the other side. That was about it.

!! Break!

Chris and I still have a table to ourselves. This is surprising, and I don't understand why.

I cut and beveled more pipe. I got to do some fitting solo. I helped mark the lines for the saddle as well.

Chris came by and showed me one of the unique shaped fitup bars he found rusting on the side. I've been looking for one since we got here. Lucky bastard!!

!! Lunch!

We finished our bevels and cut the saddle. We organized and cleaned. We took back some of the pipe. We ran out of things to do.

I told Chris-M I wanted to finish my stainless dogs. He said to hold off. We have been bird-dogged by that asshole all day, and every time he has to say something negative, even when it is clearly irrelevant. We shouldn't give him ammo. He is already pissed that we are completing this job for another Yates contract on the other side of Eastman.

So, we moved onto fixing the flanges that 4 fitters (among a host of management and riggers) failed to accomplish for days. Chris-M said the only fix is to bore out slightly diagonal holes for the remaining 2 bolts. Whoever fabbed the flanges fucked up. Chris-M is right. We ran the wires and his our activities from the white hats. It is working.

!! Break!  

We finished putting bolts in. Some of the others that were already put in need adjustment.

I did a hell of a lot of nothing besides cleaning up.
