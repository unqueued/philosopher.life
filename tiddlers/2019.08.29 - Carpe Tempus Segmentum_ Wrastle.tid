* Woke at 10:30
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* Got my offspring to work.
* Wrestling
* ISP is fucking us. I spend an hour and a half speaking with various reps and techs trying to convince them that I really do want port forwarding, and they really could provide it to me if they wanted. We aren't supposed to use our own routers. Wow.
** They desperately did not want to be on the phone with me. Their arguments were trash, and they had no intention of helping me. Escalation only went so far. I'm annoyed that they see me as an annoyance for seeking a basic human right on the internet.
** I'm pretty convinced we've lost the ability to serve from our house directly. We have to VPN a tunnel in now.
* Work
* Inform the Men!
* Red Beans and Rice, Salad, Alcohol
* WoW
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 2! =)
