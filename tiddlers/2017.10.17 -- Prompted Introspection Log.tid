!! Do you prefer that people shoot straight with you or temper their words? Why?

Always with the questions, Samwise. Okay. This is an important one. As always, my answer is: //it depends on the context//. 

If I am open to criticism, if I need the truth, if I want to know what you really think, or if I don't have time to play games, then I prefer straight-shooting. If I am feeling quite vulnerable, sensitive, in need of empathy, or believe that your straight-shooting answer only displays your willful malicious ignorance, then I beg you to temper your words (if you say them at all). 

If you don't temper your words, then you better be right. If you don't couch your argument in caveats, then you have boldly proclaimed yourself an authority. You have a duty to be right on such occasions. 

I say this as someone who is generally an incredibly honest straight shooter with the people I care most about, and I have failed that standard before. Of course, with everyone else, I'm essentially forced to temper my words: I can't say what I'm really thinking or in the way I believe it should be said.
