title: 2019.09.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Busy and Delightful

* Woke at 10
** Insane dreams. At this point, my wife and I are sleeping very poorly again. It's enough for me, but I don't know if it is for her. 
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* Reading
* Dialectures
* Work
* My wife was just exhausted. She's pitiful on the couch. Work is wrecking her.
** Vitamin D is low, but worried about her calcium.
** CFS
* Beer Run
* Beans and Rice, veggies
** We need to do this more. I like this meal. I don't have the skill to perfect the seasoning for it. I have been blown away by it before.
* WoW
* Read
** Where is your writing? Reading isn't enough.
* Fireman Time!
** Allergy is wonderful. =)
* Sleep by 3
** Though it was not smooth.
