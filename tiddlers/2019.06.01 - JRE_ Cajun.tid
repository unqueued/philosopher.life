Awesome. It won't be too late for me.

I think my brother went on a date tonight. He got some cajun food, but it was awful. He met his General Foreman there by accident. He felt weird about how the conversation went; he talked about YT videos. He was pretty hard on himself. His foreman defines socialism like a Democrat. I think Cajun will now be a codeword for retarded.

The guys at his workplace thought his handmade stropp was the equivalent of macaroni art. That's so weird to me. I doubt they could build one.

Doc won't be running a test for low-T for 3 months because my brother is waiting for changes in anti-depressants. He's worried about his liver and side effects. He also had to remind his nurse practitioner about what the chart in her hands said about his blood work (inspiring confidence, and my brother is extremely quick to defer to expertise). He is being his own advocate, and that's a necessary thing. I am grateful that my brother has access to good healthcare and he's using it!

We talked shit about the fitters at his job. 

My brother talked about enjoying Venture Bros with me. We talked about reference and I recommended that Baudrillard book to him. I think he will find it interesting (even where we disagree with it).

He's planning stuff for my offspring. I think they are going to have a blast no matter what.

I told him about [[kicks]]' odd video. He'll be checking it out. I'm not convinced he's reading my wiki, but that's up to him.

[[JRE]] is trying to reach out to [[AIR]] again. That is good of him.
