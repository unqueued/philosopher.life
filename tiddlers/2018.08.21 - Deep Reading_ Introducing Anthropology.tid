title: 2018.08.21 - Deep Reading: Introducing Anthropology

I must be an ignoramus or something because while I admit Kinship is a valuable concept for engaging what I take to be anthropology, I really think systematic material conditions and memetics are what good anthropology must be zooming in and out on. I don't understand the love affair with kinship here; it seems to be the wrong lens to me.
