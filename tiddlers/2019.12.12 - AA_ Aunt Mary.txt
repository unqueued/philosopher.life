Mary passed away last night in her sleep.  I have no idea what or how to do arrangements but Stephen and I are going to figure it out

I'm sorry.
Dec 12, 2019 8:57pm
Wow. =(
Dec 12, 2019 8:57pm
Yeah she didn’t suffer and I am glad of that
Dec 12, 2019 8:58pm
Yes.

(I'm shocked. I have no idea what to say. It's like a kick in the chest. I can't imagine how you are feeling. I'm sorry.)

Please let me know if I can be of use.

I truly never expected anything like this.  I am still in shock —I think we all are

[[AG]] is a mess. She was a mess with Grandma and we knew that was going to happen.

How are you feeling? I can only imagine how difficult it's been for you these past few days.

Well I am up and down —wishing to crawl in the pit with hostess cupcakes
Dec 15, 2019 8:22pm
=( I hear that.

I assume you've been insanely busy (on top of what was already a really busy month). Barely time to digest it maybe.

Right now I just arrived in Florida with [[REDACTED]]
