title: 2019.10.07 - Afterschool Teaching: Fast

3 people working on 3 person prep is nice. I complemented the conversation as best I could. Carson was telling me about a daycare facility she worked at in which they cannot say the word "no" to children. Lol. We talked about that.

My favorite part of Madame Carson is her attention to our children. She knows much of who they are for only having a week. She spots things fast, develops accurate and evolving models of our children, and her ends for them are both realistic and meaningful. She has enormous patience and handles children with care. I enjoy watching her reinterpret and retell the rougher sides of our children to others; she makes the children sound much better than they are. She's good at her work, and I will try to hand her whatever missing pieces I have.

My children had good weekends, except 5DB. He's feeling off again. I think I've been useless to him today. 

I have new arrivals. 6AJf stands out strongly. She's got an attitude, and she fits in with my other 6th grade girls just fine. She needed to show me her toenail fell off. Poor girl.

Carson took 5th, and I took everyone else. I sent her a few stragglers, but none of my serious problems (since I should face the beasts). One misprediction I've made is that my boys would gather around her more. MadameM attracted them very clearly, and Carson is significantly more attractive. Is it because they know she's one of their teachers and not a random outsider? 

6DM and I talked about video games and computers. His uncle swears by FF and Linux. I hope he will listen to his uncle.

6CF apologized to me, embarrassed to do it, but he may have even meant it a little. That is unlike him. He asked me about my computer, but he had to leave before we got anywhere.

8A also asked about my wiki. It looks cool to them. It's not easy to quickly describe it to them. Lots of small computer questions today.  

8L was reading today. She's reading fantasy. She had to cry in the bathroom, but she brought 8M with her. She's been somewhat more chipper.

The prison was simple. We had a bee today, lots of people in their pajamas, phones and conversations. 6KA and 6BG were the PITAs today, but I only had to play hardball with 6KA. 

My nakesake felt more restless today.

I sat with my final students talking. I will stop being surprised to see Carson join me in speaking with the students. Whitney, Matt, Delp, Bacon, Mitchell don't engage in this behavior. She does, at least for now. 8J and I talked about his homelife, shoebeatings, his dad's carpentry business, the gruffness of construction workers, and even some of my past (he asked me questions, and I answered to the best of my ability for him).
