It has been a very extended weekend. That's okay. I got a lot of sleep and plenty done around the house (and even on this wiki and with myself<<ref "1">>). 

I love speaking to my brother about his work. My brother is damned smart, although he doesn't always use it as well as he'd like (totally understandable; it's true for all of us). He has insight, and he can articulate it. I'm lucky to have him.

He keeps pushing for me to go union. He has negative things to say about his union, but he seems to be more and more convinced it is the right choice. I'm glad he ended up going there too. Hearing him only strengthens my resolve to get into a union, even if I have to live apart from my family to do it.
