!! Audit:

* Philosophical. I'm glad.
* This reminds me of GRE analytic writing questions turned weirdly personal. I hope they at least keep me sharp.
* I'm obviously annoyed by many of these questions, particularly the wish based. However, there is some real content here.
* I often just couldn't answer the question, and I don't feel bad about it.
** I did my best in the space I had, and I tried to explain why it was not possible for me to give a satisfactory answer.
* A few edits jump out at me. Good!
* Some of this material is incredibly emotional for me.
* After writing about D2, I decided not to foist it any further upon my children. If they elect to play, great. If they don't, then that's okay. I can say I tried.
* I wrote about my wife fairly consistently.
** I need to write more about my children.
* I had a metacomment about the questions that didn't directly pertain to the question. Hrmm. I don't know if I should do that or not. 
* Ah, I see some {[[About]]}ness in here.
* The 19th had that SDO question. That had more depth than I expected to it, although it rambles.
* I have a wide range in the length of my answers.
* As usual, I have very charged responses.
* Some of my arguments suck.
