infinigress := ''infini''te re''gress''

The ancients were quite worried about infinigresses, and so am I. The quantitative aspect of philosophy finds them everywhere. What are we do to? Skepticism is not prudential in many contexts. Unfortunately, I find myself locked between a rock and hardplace all too often, with the infinigress being sometimes the best of the unappetizing options. It is my opinion that metamodernism, or some form of prudential faith in metamodern axioms and metanarratives, must help us resolve or at least handle some fundamental infinigresses in a meaningful and acceptable way.

I am worried about wasting my time, about getting stuck in thought-loops, about trying to solve the unsolvable by definition, about missing the forest for the trees.
