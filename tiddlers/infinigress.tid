title: infinigress

infinigress := ''infini''te re''gress(es)''

---

The ancients were quite worried about infinigresses, and so am I (though perhaps sometimes only insofar as it might make me a reliable indicator of where to find [[The Infinite]] in the desert). The quantitative aspect of philosophy finds them everywhere in an externally provable manner, and the qualitative in an internally provable manner. What are we to do? Skepticism is not prudential in many contexts, and anyone who took [[The Golden Rule]] to be true, would know skepticism, to some [[dok]], isn't justified either. The correct method is a pragmatization of the particular to the ideal of the skeptic (this is the epistemic trinity). Unfortunately, I find myself locked between a rock and hardplace all too often, with the infinigress being sometimes the best of the unappetizing options. It is my opinion that metamodernism, or some form of prudential faith in metamodern axioms and metanarratives, must help us resolve or at least handle some fundamental infinigresses in a meaningful and acceptable way.

Solving the incompleteness or incoherence in any dialectical correlation will always require The Foundation. Platonic Diaeresis is turing complete.

I am worried about wasting my time, about getting stuck in thought-loops, about trying to solve the unsolvable by definition, about missing the forest for the trees.
