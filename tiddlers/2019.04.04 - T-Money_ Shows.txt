I could have tapered off slowly.
THU 9:31 PM
But I wanted to feel the pain. So I dumped everything in the front yard and ran over it with the lawnmower the following day.
THU 9:32 PM
But they sell it at the local 24hr truck stop. So it's just symbolic.....
THU 9:32 PM
Lol. Well, symbols still mean a lot to me.
THU 9:33 PM
I like for the story I get to tell.
THU 9:34 PM
