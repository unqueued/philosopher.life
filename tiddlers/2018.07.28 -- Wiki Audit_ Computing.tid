title: 2018.07.28 -- Wiki Audit: Computing

I'm spending my weekly family audit time on [[Computing]]. As I've recently expressed, I desperately need to give it a facelift.

Also, Grammarly is out. It's lagging my work. It's also wrong far too often. I just stopped giving a shit what it says. I'm going to make obvious mistakes, and so be it.

Does my wiki require googling too much?

I don't like that other people don't understand my wiki. But, at the same time, there is only so much I can do about that.

Husserliana organized by a team of Husserl's himself. Husserl wrote an hour or a day, whether he needed to or not. Stephen King for 4 hours, Shakespeare for 8, and I aim for 12. 

Someone who has something I find intelligently kind to say about my {[[About]]} page, especially showing me something I didn't know about myself or how I'm thinking about myself, or clarifies it for me, or gives me good analogies, etc., is a person who clearly knows me well.

[[Root]] could be organized for readers other than me more effectively. The whole point is for me to write this wiki to myself first in a sense. Yes, it will be obtuse, difficult to appreciate, lots of people who don't want to spend time exploring and piecing it together will truly hate it. So, what?

I don't have an entrance to this wiki for newcomers. I need one.

I need to be able to say what this wiki is to other people, otherwise it is going to fail to [[Find The Others]].

I target the 1% on many bellcurves.

Writing myself out in the open with maximum transparency is how to habituate and teach myself that I am a good person who continues seek to be a better person.
