title: 2019.02.13 - Be A Good Dad: Virtue

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

We had a very long, excellent discussion about theory of mind as it pertains to virtue, particularities of our contexts, reaping what we sow, planning and autonomy, using our leisure time to be constructive, experience machines, GPGPU vs CPU, AlphaStar, agency, communicating with ourselves, the wikis, dialectics, how those around us think and evaluate, comparisons to others their age (and parents), etc. I cannot effectively encapsulate the conversation.

Some excellent arguments out of my daughter. They are both going to be [[monster]]s in the dialectic.
