title: 2019.06.19 - Wiki Audit: Remodel Redeux?

[[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] has me thinking I'm spinning my wheels again. That is closer to what I want, but it's obviously still clean up. I need to clean the mess up, and that means I need to work on the non-dated material, right?

---

Tagging and alias work. One problem I'm running into again and again is atomization. Some of these tiddlers have next to nothing in them, and some of their peers are fairly large. Should I mix them? If I can sure, especially if I see that it should morph into it as a practice. I am, of course, a hoarder. I'm glad too, I've partially forgotten some of these (out of sight, out of mind); they'd have been lost to the sands of time without recording for me.

---

Cleaning up formatting. I wish I knew what I was doing from the beginning. That's okay.

---

It's such a weird feeling to be engaged in [[The Remodeling]] for semantic edits which aren't in terms of footnotes. These are meant to be editable, and the snapshots cover the Orwellian side otherwise.

---

I like that many of the structures are still built by hand. There's no reason to [[Firmcode]] a lot of this. 

---

I really like what I did with [[Humor]]. Like, I'm proud of myself (probably without justification). I like having a list to walk through, but I think sprawling and covering the references in the rhizome to construct molecules has to be the right way to do it too. It reminds me of my first [[Wiki Audit]] where I started walking through layers in [[Root]], ROFLMAO. I have to find the right balance though. 

[[Documentaries]] is merged, directorified, defined a bit, cleaned up, and the constituents edited. Yay. =)

---

I'm spending a good bit of time looking through references, and the "open all" function off filtered searching is coming in handy too.

---

[[Music: Library]] is finally getting another judgment pass! Woot! It desperately needs it too.
