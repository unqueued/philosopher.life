Welcome, nomad! Well met, indeed. It's a pleasure to hear from you. Please let me know if I can {[[Help]]} you. I've been thinking about you and trying to construct a model of you for myself.<<ref "i">> I am excited to get to know you. 

<<<
@h0p3 First, thanks. I am deeply weird and to me, it's a compliment. ;-)
<<<

I am glad you know that compliment when you hear it. You got the spark of crazy-in-a-good-way in you.<<ref "g">> The more I look into the threads you leave online, the weirder and more interesting I think you are.<<ref "f">> It is my opinion that you read me under the table. I think you're contemplative too.

Your writing can be: hilarious, quite opinionated, heterodox, heavily cited, forcefully argued, engrossed in your current obsession, and open-minded bordering on paradox and/or the appearance of inconsistency.<<ref "p">> Sometimes you hold back from saying what you think as you know it will receive backlash, but I appreciate your willingness to go against the grain. You tend to be patient and fair in the dialectic. Perhaps most importantly, it is obvious you care about being moral (even if we may profoundly disagree on that nature of such a claim). You are clearly a philosopher, Sir carapace.<<ref "c">>

<<<
Second, OMG your website is a custom TiddlyWiki? It looks fascinating. Email sent. Well met.
<<<

Yes, it's a Tiddlywiki! I adore it. It has a lot of properties I admire, and it's productive for me. I feel it fits me like a glove. This wiki is probably bigger than it looks too. You may have very strong opinions about my next claim:

I'm trying to model what is [[salient]] about myself and the world with this tool. In a sense, I'm trying to upload my mind into this wiki.

I can see you've used Tiddlywiki before as well. If you did, why did you seem to lose interest in it?

<<<
Hey, this is "carapace" from HN. How's it going? 
<<<

It's going well. If you are interested, that question is best answered by the wiki. Today was exceptionally busy, and I was afraid I wouldn't have the time to respond to you.<<ref "m">> I have a bunch of questions to start us off:

* Why did you choose "carapace" as your username on HN?
** Would you prefer a different moniker on my wiki?
* Why are you such an H.G. Wells fan?
* Why should my children learn Prolog?
** Be as technical and philosophical as you wish, please.
* Why don't I see much about [[Rust]] from you?
* Do you have any particular writing you'd like me to read to understand you better?
* You have experienced significant depression and homelessness. I would like to know more about your tribulations. You have overcome serious adversity.
* Do you have anything more I can read about the brain interface you had mentioned on HN?
* How are you liking Mouseless OpenBSD using Tmux without X?
** Why not have a DE (tiling window managers, terminator, and tmux gives you lot of options)?
** Why OpenBSD?
** I apologize that my site cannot be effectively browsed from the commandline.
*** It technically renders in browsh, but that is cheating. =)
* You are interested in permaculture sustainability. How do you personally practice it?
* What resources about NLP would you like me to read/watch/think about?
* This may be something you hate or love, I do not know (I would argue you are interested in some topics quite related to it):
** https://github.com/FormalTheology/GoedelGod
* Is there something that happened in 2014 that caused you to kind of drop off the web (or change how you used it) in some respects?
* How do you identify yourself philosophically, politically, and religiously?
** Feel free to wrestle with the question as being incoherent in itself if you wish.
* What questions would you like me to answer for you?

[[Find The Others]] is one of my {[[Axioms]]}. I'm hoping that we can build a profound relationship online, and if not that, hopefully as deep a relationship as we can. I [[hope]] I don't scare you away with my weirdness and intensity. I also realize you might not find me worth your time. That's up to you.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
