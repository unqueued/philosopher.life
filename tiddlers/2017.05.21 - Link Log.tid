** I have run across rumors of pedophilia in Hollywood many times. I am not surprised.

** I agree with much of the article. I continue to inspect humanity's dependence upon mobile computing and the way it influences our lives.

** Yet another tool I wish I had the will power to learn to use and integrate into my life.

** The monetization of Reddit continues from the inside and out.

** An interesting read, and visuals are also pretty.

** Conservatives: kill yourselves. The authoritarian restrictions upon fundamental democratizing, access, and mobility information tools is beyond disturbing.

** I'm not surprised to see the US at the top of these lists (I say that without a drop of nationalism).

** It's sad when you expect the contradictions.

** AMP does look like an attempt to build a walled garden inside the web itself. Disgusting.

** Motivated me today to clean the house top to bottom. 
** I would like to note that I've seen several tidbits towards a theory of this. I've seen anecdotal evidence a'plenty as well.

** Oh, I can see that you have an emergency from my surveillance of your life, so now I can price gouge you.

** It never made sense to socialists. I've found it's increasingly not making sense to capitalists either. I assume they will have more reactionary approaches to the issue though.

** This is no accident. This is a bribe. Capitalism is working just //fine//. Let me guess, you don't even see the connection to capitalism here (go ahead and play dumb). Oh, this isn't real capitalism? I suppose you think we live in a constitutional democratic republic too. You think you can honestly divide economics from politics? Are you fucking retarded? Open your eyes. The US has killed hundreds of millions of people off (and enslaved even more) for the sake of capitalism.

** But, I want to have my cake and eat it too. Certainty is a powerful drug.
