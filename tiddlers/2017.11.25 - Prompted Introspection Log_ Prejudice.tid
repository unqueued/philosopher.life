title: 2017.11.25 - Prompted Introspection Log: Prejudice

!! Why do you think prejudice exists in the world?

What is prejudice? We think of it as a preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience or forming a judgment on (an issue or person) prematurely without having adequate information. Is it conceptually, in all possible cases, epistemically wrong? Not obviously.

You see, humans come with innately embedded categories and ways of thinking about the world from birth, even if only minimally so. Perhaps it is not conscious judgment, but it is still judgment. This is prejudice, right? But, it is acceptable. What other choice do we have? How could we possibly even begin learning to think, developing an understanding of the world, without it? 

I do not have absolute certainty about a great many things, I only have degrees of confidence. I am subconsciously constantly updating my probabilistic inference calculus, attempting to make inferences that maximize the chemical rewards I receive in my brain. I must be highly inductive about the world. I must make judgments with minimal information, snap decisions in the blink of an eye with little or almost nothing. I must seek patterns, generalizations, and templates. I have to hack it together and cheat. This is part of risk management in the postmodern world torrent of information and decisions which all homo sapiens have dealt with from the beginning of our species. There is nothing we can do about it but make do.

Essentially, I think we are prejudiced out of necessity. I don't think it is wrong by definition. I think bad things and terrible judgments come out of it, but what other methods are available to us? Ah, it is only through being philosophical, scientific, and careful that we can clear our vision. We must pick our battles, and of course, we can all make improvements. Hindsight, of course, is 20/20. We can only be Present-at-Hand a finite amount, and there are serious opportunity costs. We can only do our best. I must admit, I'm not sure what it means to say we aren't doing our best when I look under the hoods of our minds. Yes, we are deterministically fallible.
