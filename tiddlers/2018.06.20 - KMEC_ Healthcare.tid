title: 2018.06.20 - KMEC: Healthcare

I just want to point out that you've only switched to supporting universal healthcare AFTER SLT started getting sick. You've conveniently shifted your values. I can't even see a progression in your thought to it. It looks like you just flipped a switch, and I can see you really don't have a justification underneath your initial justification (and that is a fundamental problem for you, and I'm not talking about the epistemic foundation problem). I don't think you really have reasons for what you believe which aren't fundamentally (again, not the foundation problem) selfish.
