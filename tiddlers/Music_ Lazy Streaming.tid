title: Music: Lazy Streaming

I'm getting older, and music doesn't tell me stories I care about nearly as much as they used to. I care about it most when I'm high, but otherwise it is background noise to me, just another layer for stimulation. Music complements my life, but I am rarely immersed it in. As such, I now just prefer access, automatic-discovery, and streaming to all else.

One of the largest Pandora interface updates told me how many hours I've spent on each channel. They claim my total usage of Pandora was 6793 hours (although, I don't know if they've tracked all 6.5 years of usage). I average listening to Pandora 12% of my day (that sounds very low to me). Otherwise, I keep play music files from a device while I can. Except when I'm not allowed to listen to music given social requirements (e.g. work), NPR, audiobooks, podcasts, speaking to people IRL or on the phone, video, and sleep are usually my only reprieves from my music dependence. I literally drown myself in music, and yet I do not feel as immersed. Perhaps I am desensitized. I'll keep taking the drug though. At the very least, it allows me to add the spice of happiness to practices I might not otherwise enjoy.
