!! Audit:

* I have food, cleaning, and working on the brain.
* These are rolling lists, probabilistic, and they spread in my life.
* Hey, some of this is just practical, and that's it. I adore it.
* I don't beat myself when I fail so much.
* I hear way more executive functioning dialogue in here.
* I see [[Wiki Audit]] and [[Wiki Review]] in here as well. Hrm. It's getting gunkier.
* Some of the projects I get to way, way after identify the fact that I want to do them. Some take longer than they ought.
* We give away a lot of PII up in here, lol.
* Our music library is much better off now.
* My wife was not amused.
* Oh, shit, our dental appointments. We need to do that.
* There encouragement in here. So weird. =)
* I can see I'm having a hard time connecting with my brother [[JRE]] here as well.
* Writing to write moar works so well...It takes forever for me to finish some letters.
* I've wanted way more sex.
* Our meals and prep have been more on point. 
* I'm grateful that we've switched rotation on kitchen duty. It's actually getting done in a way that doesn't drive my wife insane.
* Still no swimming, and I obviously failed to do so much on these lists.
** Your offspring have gotten more swimming in, although that has been eaten by our frisbee time too.
* The Sexton position doesn't even pay close to a living wage.
