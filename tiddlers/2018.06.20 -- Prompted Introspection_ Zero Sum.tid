title: 2018.06.20 -- Prompted Introspection: Zero Sum

!! "If someone gains, someone else loses." How much does this reflect life, and how much does it come up short. Reflecting upon this, how could your attitudes have been different during events in your past?

I think descriptively, the world is largely playing a zero-sum game with [[T4T]] psychopaths defecting at critical moments to climb the chaotic ladder of a giant pyramid scheme named Capitalism, the technopolitically evolved State of Nature. Those who do not play by the moral rules, particularly when it benefits them enough to be worth the risk, have conceptual competitive advantages that cannot be otherwise defeated except by mass, highly unlikely cooperation of the rest of humanity working to stop them, to decentralize power, etc.

That said, not everyone is perfectly rational, and more importantly not everyone is truly playing a zero sum game of perfect competition. Some can't even [[T4T]], and many engage in [[T42T]] to some [[dok]]. This is just part of justification for why I think [[T42T]] is the axiom I must use. This is the best model I have at the moment. I am autistic though.

I can see I have been far too trusting as an autistic person. I've generally thought people were ignorant, but I'm still (somehow I'm stupid here) coming to more fully realize how ultimately large swathes of humanity are and will continue to be profoundly malicious to some [[dok]]. I would have taken much greater steps to secure myself and my family against them memetically, financially, and physically. I'm sure that sounds excessively paranoid to you Samwise. If you want to debate it, I will. I suggest you think about the contents of my wiki first; are you sure you understand my argument well?
