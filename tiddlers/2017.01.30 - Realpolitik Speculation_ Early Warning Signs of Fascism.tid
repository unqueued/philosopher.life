title: 2017.01.30 - Realpolitik Speculation: Early Warning Signs of Fascism

I read Animal Farm two decades ago, and it set me on a path. I've long thought there was something deeply right about that genre's descriptions of who we are as human beings. I see the golem we are raising. Of course, we always risk violating Godwin's law. What regime isn't compared to Hitler? Here's the crucial fact: fascism comes in degrees and kinds, and it seems to have many definitions and associations. I think we are slipping into "new normals." Below you will find Britt's "Early Warning Signs of Fascism."<<ref "1">> Included are my oversimplified, sweepingly generalized ratings (with bias!) of the current political climate:

* USA | Political Problematic
* 4/10 | Powerful and continuing nationalism
* 7/10 | Disdain for human rights
* 5/10 | Identification of enemies as a unifying cause
* 3/10 | Supremacy of the military
* 2/10 | Rampant sexism
* 8/10 | Controlled mass media
* 9/10 | Obsession with national security
* 6/10 | Religion and government intertwined
* 9/10 | Corporate power protected
* 6/10 | Labor power suppressed
* 5/10 | Disdain for intellectuals and the arts
* 5/10 | Obsession with crime and punishment
* 8/10 | Rampant cronyism and corruption
* 6/10 | Fraudulent elections

Lists like these are useless, except when they aren't.

Obviously, the US is not monolithic. It's large, diverse, complex, and deeply divided. The various sects within each of the proletariat, bourgeoisie, ruling, and hyper classes have their own ratings, as well as different contributions and relationships to these warnings signs.<<ref "2">> 

Fascism is the last defense of capitalism. This is late stage capitalism in the developed world.

<<footnotes "1" "Laurence W. Britt wrote about the common signs of fascism in April 2003, after researching seven fascist regimes: Hitler's Nazi Germany; Mussolini's Italy; Franco's Spain; Salazar's Portugal; Papadopoulos' Greece; Pinochet's Chile; Suharto's Indonesia. It pulls on my heart strings, but that doesn't mean this is an accurate list. Something about it seems obviously right though.">>

<<footnotes "2" "I have the kneejerk reaction to put Proles one side and everyone else on the other. There is some truth to being that generalized, but our opponents are divided in crucial ways.">>
