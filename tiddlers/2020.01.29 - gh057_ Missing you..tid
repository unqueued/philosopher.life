We're getting used to it up here. The city is a different pace of life. [[k0sh3k]] hit the ground running in her job, and I'm happy to see everything just click for her. The kids have been picking up the slack for their ol' man in the house.

We're all sitting on our machines in the living together again, which is basically the definition of home for me.

I'm sure it's a lot faster than Elizabethton LOL. And a lot more crowded too. I knew [[k0sh3k]] would do well. I'm glad things are going good for you guys. Hopefully things will level out and keep getting better every day. I still miss you though and I wish you was here but that's just me being selfish LOL I'm sure the kids miss you over at the school as well.
