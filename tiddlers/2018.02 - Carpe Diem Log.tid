!! Audits:

* Weekly Post-Mortem
** Yeah, I took too long on some of these tasks, but I often made up for it. 
** We are continually piecing school together. I know it's slow going, but week-by-week I see improvements not only in my children, but even the rate at which they are improving. This is no accident. It has been hard work on all fronts.
** I'm really glad I solved my problem with Deluge. It took me longer than it should have, but I'm proud that I didn't give up.

* Carpe Diem
** Tax season is clearly not over for us.
** I did improve my sleep schedule. It has been shaky at times, but overall, I am doing better at this. I'm glad.
** We consumed plenty of media this month, that's for sure.
** I switched the titles a couple times as I realized what I was doing. I'm glad I didn't have to setup these naming conventions for anyone else. It's easier on me that I can change it whenever I feel like it. 
** It's clear I was feeling depressed the last week just by the titles alone. Lack of Cannabliss started to take its toll after a week, I suspect.
** I had extended family stuff this month, moreso than usual.
** I did some very cool technical work. I'm glad.
** I think we've done a better job getting the kids to work in their wikis and schoolwork. It's been rough in some respects, but it has been paying off. I think the nightly checks are pretty necessary.
** I stopped watching //The Wire// and I don't know why.
** I've been horny as of late. I think it is my way of making of up for a lack of cannabliss.
*** Speaking of, Zlam was relaxing.
** Our family meetings have been fairly long. That's okay. I'm glad we have them.
** I think I've finally converted my son to Regular Show. It's funny because he will regularly have such strong emotions about the show that he has to walk out of the room for a second and run back in. 
** I've tried to be there for my brother JRE. I might be failing him. I'm not sure what I can for him.
** It was good to hear from C.
** I don't think I've resolved the lack of reciprocation from L.<<ref "2019.03.26-4">>
*** She never initiates. Redflag.
** Our Baked->Fried chicken method worked really nicely. I like it.
** I really want to start getting to bed 1 hour earlier and getting up 1 hour earlier.
** I've had more to drink this month than last month.
** I want to play more basketball with the kids. They need to practice working with their bodies. Perhaps we must force the issue as classwork again?
** We eat really well for living on such a tight fucking budget.
** I can tell that I've been a failure in [[Employment]]. It sucks to face it.
** Despite my failures, it has been a good month. I'm glad to have lived it.

<<footnotes "2019.03.26-1" "The cringe is strong with this one. Doubling my failure rate. I'm glad I took the risk, failed, and continue to take risks. Sometimes they pay off.">>

<<footnotes "2019.03.26-2" "This is one of the reasons I'm glad I've moved to tagging and using [[alias]]es. I can evolve the names of projects. That happened three times in a month for a [[Core Daily Requirement]]. This might be the only case. Clearly, I'm still learning how to even use the basics of this tool. I feel like such a moron, but progress is progress, homie.">>

<<footnotes "2019.03.26-3" "I switched back to the original while doing the weekly.">>

<<footnotes "2019.03.26-4" "It's a year later, and I'm convinced you probably never will. =/. Yet, I am proud of myself for trying to think clearly and carefully about it. I have more than held up my end of the bargain here.">>
