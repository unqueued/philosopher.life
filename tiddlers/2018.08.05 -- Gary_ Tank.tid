title: 2018.08.05 -- Gary: Tank

We have fish and a fish tank. Gary is simplifying life and taking care of fewer people, and this may be related to wanting his daughter to leave the nest (seems to be hinting at it).

I talked to his wife and daughter. They are kind people who don't mind weirdness (although, I'm too weird for them, I'm afraid). I like that they are homeschoolers, and I listen to what they have to say. Sometimes they've been around the block.

I wish I knew how to connect better with them. I'm trying with the wiki, of course.
