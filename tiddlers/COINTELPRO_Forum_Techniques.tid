title: COINTELPRO Forum Techniques

; Forum Sliding
: Using multiple accounts and prepared dialogue exchanges, spam new threads or necro older threads (which can be positioned in advance) to "slide" or "flush" an offending post out of view. It's not direct censorship, but it drowns out the offending message with believable spam, pushing it out of focus.

; Consensus Cracking
: A dialectic between a strawman offending position and an increasingly steelmanned position of preferred disinformation are presented over time so as to appear like a realistic defeat of the offending position. 

; Topic Dilution
: Without actually getting banned: troll, shitpost, and banter about unrelated topics to misdirect, burn mod and user resources, and cut into their productivity. Encourage gossip, conjecture, distracting drama, lowering the standards of what counts as acceptable levels of participation, and shifting topics to the irrelevant.

; Information Collection
: Ask leading questions (answering with multiple accounts) or incite anger to cause people to reveal more about themselves and their intentions than they otherwise would. Multiple accounts allow you to lead people out of their shells. That information can be used against them at a later time.

; Gaining Full Control
: Infiltrate and maneuver for a moderator or admin position. Once obtained, the forum can be controlled by deleting unfavorable postings,  taken offline at will, purged of unwanted users, and eventually steered into the ground or wielded as a lolcow-strawman or honeypot.
