!! Iron Golem

So far, I've not been able to make one that survives any intense fighting whatsoever.

* Aura When Equipped works
* Having "Slow" is very strong, obviously. This is a higher damage Clay Golem
* CB is strong too obviously, since that and your merc are the only sources of it.

Particular items of note:

* Kelpie Snare. Better than gumby.
* Insight Runeword: cheap, no more mana problems.
* IK Maul: Amn, Amn
