!! Respond to the following gem:

...capitalism is basically a system where everything is for sale, and the more money you have, the more you can get. And, in particular, that's true of freedom. Freedom is one of the commodities that is for sale, and if you are affluent, you can have a lot of it. It shows up in all sorts of ways. It shows up if you get in trouble with the law, let's say, or in any aspect of life it shows up. And for that reason it makes a lot of sense, if you accept capitalist system, to try to accumulate property, not just because you want material welfare, but because that guarantees your freedom, it makes it possible for you to amass that commodity. [...] what you're going to find is that the defense of free institutions will largely be in the hands of those who benefit from them, namely the wealthy, and the powerful. They can purchase that commodity and, therefore, they want those institutions to exist, like free press, and all that.

Money does buy political freedom something like what Berlin and Hobbes imagine. It seems to even buy the way in which we politically enslave those who have metaphysical freedom necessary for moral agency as well. Freedom and our identities are commodified to some absurdly significant [[dok]] in capitalism. The centralization of power extends beyond the right to flourish into unjustifiable luxury at the expense of [[others]]. The top 9% control pretty much everything in exponentially rising degrees of oligarghic aristocracy. 

Those with money dictate demand and hence what is supplied. As that power centralizes, society is cyclically retrofitted to serve those winners who take all. The elite use us as a loop, their interests form (perhaps contradictorily) and hold a monopsony and monopoly over buying and selling power. We are simply cogs in that machine which collapses upon itself.
