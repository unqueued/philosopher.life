* Called [[Charlie]] and [[JRE]].
* [[JRE]] called back.
** Baby is not going to be called Rigs, and he's got a fever. 
** We talked about our wikis, and he commented that it's going to be interesting for 25yo versions of my offspring to be able to precisely speak about some of their childhood with evidence.
** He doesn't want to go on a trip to the beach, or he'll buy an expensive laptop to do it. 
** Rebecca still hates her job. He's doing what he can to make alternatives for her.
