* Pod Delivrary
** Still feel like shit, but [[m16]] and mattress sound like pure heaven.
* Find adult breastfeeding relationship. 
** For the record, if I'm asking someone if they are going to have children: I'm consciously asking them if they are raw-dogging it (and, I adore that I have the opportunity to ask it, even with euphemistic phrasing). There simply aren't enough creampies in the world. Thank you, grandma.
* Start putting a house together
* Offspring [[CDR]]s would be noice.
** Don't hold your breath. You are coughing too much as it is.
* Speedtest
* Audits galore!
* If you feel like shit, then just rest. Nuffin' you can do there.
