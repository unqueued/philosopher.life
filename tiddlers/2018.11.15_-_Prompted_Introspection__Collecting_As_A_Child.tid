title: 2018.11.15 - Prompted Introspection: Collecting As A Child

!! What was your favorite thing to collect as a child, and why?

Autistic individuals adore collecting things, organizing them, and trying to model them with precision. It's calming and allows us to just be there. I think it's almost flowstate inducing for autists.

I think my favorite thing to collect as a child was Pokemon? I'd argue it was towards the end of my childhood, but still so much fun. It's great to see the creator of the game was also autistic. He knew exactly what it felt like. I only caught 'em all once. I did so on a trip to the Grand Canyon. After that, I only caught what I considered to be valuable, broken OP, and absurd in that game. I've tried getting the kids into it, but they don't give two shits. I don't blame 'em though. It's not that amazing anymore, and there are better things to do with out time...like our wikis! =)
