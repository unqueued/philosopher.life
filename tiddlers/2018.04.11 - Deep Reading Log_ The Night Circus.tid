This book doesn't look like it's for me.

Can the author motivate the game for me? I'm a gamer, but not a narrativist. I fear the pieces won't be there. The book is highly praised though, so I have evidence to think I could be quite wrong.

Let me say, I hope I'm desperately wrong. I want my socks to be knocked off.

My wife has a lady-hardon for Shakespeare this year, why? The threatre is centered in two books now. Does she miss it? I want to understand my wife through her book choices.

Give me all the hacks!

Admittedly, non-linear narratives are much harder for me to interpret. As an autist, my mind doesn't work so well in several directions that normies seem to grasp with ease. You must pardon me, please. My mind is either a world-class duelist or a retarded child. I'm sorry.

I'm in love with character lists. That helps me so much. I'm very bad at that. It's the leg up I need.

I'm afraid I'm too stupid/lazy to understand the names. 

Btw, that's a lot of fucking characters (#written-while-drunk)

Ugh, the non-linearity is going to fuck me over. I know the lit-whores are going to hate me for my lacking here. Yes, you have a qualia, but I don't think it does the work you think it does. I think you are just easily bored, seek over-complex puzzles, etc. Good for you. Enjoy the game.

Okay. I can see I can't read this while drunk.
