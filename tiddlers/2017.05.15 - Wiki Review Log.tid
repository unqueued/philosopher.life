title: 2017.05.15 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.05.14 - k0sh3k's Wiki Log]]
** Maybe my wife and I should set aside an hour together each day. I know she just wants to veg. Sometimes it helps to have an accountabilibuddy who does it alongside you. I know weightlifting was that way for me.

** I really need my wife's help to help my son. I can't motivate him. I can't get him to do it. She is the only one who can. Without her, he will fail.

** I need to stay on her about the calories counter. Having the discipline to maintain the habit of being honest with ourselves is really the major hurdle. After that, getting it done is often easier (although, not always).
* [[2017.05.14 - Family Log]]
** It really sucks doing the [[Homeschooling Log]], [[Family Log]], and [[Family Wikis Log Collection]] completed at the very end of Sunday night. We had to out of necessity, but we should plan around it as much as we can. It is a very intense series of objectives to complete in a single setting.

** My wife will be going to conference, so I worry that my children will fail more towards the end of the week without her daily accountability session with each of them.
* [[The House]]
** I'm glad I'm dreaming. I looked it up. It would be crazy expensive. It doesn't hurt to dream though. Motivations rock, even if you don't achieve the dream you had in mind. I'll do the best I can with what I have.
* [[ASCII & Unicode Art]]
** Doodles, yay!
* [[2017.05.14 - Link Log]]
** I've found that I use my lunch breaks to generate my Link Log. It saves me time. Eventually, I'd like to make sure I have zero sync problems so that I can edit from multiple devices. This may not be possible. I should at least work on it though. Ultimately, I'd prefer not to use a text editor for notes on secondary machines.
* [[2017.05.12 - Pipefitting Log]]
** It was interesting being away for a weekend. I think I need to develop better coping mechanisms. That said, retroactive writing is still better than nothing. I know I can't always get what I want. I should plan around it. I'm not exactly sure what I should do though. I'm glad I didn't just give up on it for those days I was away.
* [[2017.05.14 - Diet Log]]
** Found the sum total.
* [[2017.05.13 - Diet Log]]
** Surprisingly didn't eat much that day, although I didn't eat healthily either. I'm betting I just felt anxious.
* [[2017.05.12 - Diet Log]]
** Eat all the things that are bad for you! Nom, nom.
* [[2017.05.14 - Wiki Review Log]]
** A few edits.
* [[2017.05.13 - h0p3's Log]]
** Edits
** Also, glad I reminded myself to send the invite and the libgen address.
** I need to set the VPN up.
