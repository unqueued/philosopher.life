title: 2018.08.13 -- nomasters: handshake

```
I've got an early prototype working both on payload generation and a simple server for backend
10:51 AM
h0p3
are you doing an integrity check?
rjrbt
yeah, the message is signed by NaCl Sign - which is an ed25519 based signing tool
oh - shit. I haven't told you about the context on this
So... IPNS the name service for IPFS isn't quite ready for mobile
its important for handshake, but I think a cryptographically signed and ephemeral key/value store could be generally useful to folks
h0p3
yes
rjrbt
right now, the reference build is just an in-memory KV store, but we're looking to possibly support badger kv store for local storage, and redis as a backing store
its very light weight though. payloads are less than 2KB in encoded json
EDITED
h0p3
one of the keys to decentralization is trusting others to hold my metadata for me
rjrbt
exactly.
and the cool part is: with this, you can (and should) post the "value" as an encrypted blob
so, on hashmap I have no idea who you are, or what you are storing
and you get a cryptographically guaranteed endpoint to store some blob of data
for handshake, this is an encrypted blob that, when decrypted, points to a specific IPFS hash
EDITED
We also plan to support TOR hidden service on day one of going live on this
I like to think of this as pastbin of cryptographically signed key-value stores :)
h0p3
that makes sense
this is thoughtfully done, and I can see things built on top of it
rjrbt
yeah, its the only reason we took it on, I didn't want to get destracted from handshake but we were going to have to jump through a bunch of hoops to avoid it
this also keeps handshake much simpler 
h0p3
do you think IPFS should already have this functionality?
rjrbt
so they do, sort of.
IPNS is a major influence for hashmap
but IPNS is restricted in some important ways
IPNS allows you to have a "mutable endpoint" that is the hash of your peerId
which is your pubkey on IPFS for your node
EDITED
you can do this:
ipfs name publish /ipfs/QmQa6GUBpW8H7spepQri6s62uv1NZhxzjTW73BgWKM7WH5
Published to QmUTwqtL5veio86ZZ3u5TmGptnM5iCA4bm9vbTVocUKo3N: /ipfs/QmQa6GUBpW8H7spepQri6s62uv1NZhxzjTW73BgWKM7WH5
but there are a couple of important things:
1) you can only publish a reference to an IPFS hash
2) right now its kind of slow to propegate
3) its not supported on mobile - you have to run a full DHT node and it gets tricky
Honestly, IPNS and even new tech like Iota Masked Authentacted Messaging (MAM) look really promising
but they aren't quite ready yet.
once they are for mobile, handshake will absolutely support them
we have this core idea on handshake we're calling strategies which are configuration choices that Bob and Alice can make while setting up the handshake
they can agree on cryptography methods, sharing methods, and "backend" tech
h0p3
mobile may simply be a dummy terminal that requires I run a real server, perhaps something like Matrix
the battery drain on decentralized tools is insane
rjrbt
yeah, for real.
so handshake is unique in that there is no outside auth
h0p3
what do you mean by that?
rjrbt
IPFS is just storing hash blobs, so there is no auth there
and Bob and Alice exchange pubkey's to know where to get "latest messages" from the other person after they leave
h0p3
(btw, I adore how "no outside auth" fits your internalist views in epistemology...random sidenote)
rjrbt
haha :)
as long as Bob controls his set of preshared one-time-use keys for encrypted messages and his priv_key for signing payloads, that is all he needs to operate his side of the chat
Alice does the same on her side
to the outside world, there is no correlation between bob's hashmap endpoint and alice's hashmap endpoint. and with encrypted references to IPFS, there isn't even a way to tie IPFS hashes to hashmap references 
h0p3
That is a strong claim
I mean this in humility, you may easily be correct
correlation is not an easy thing for me to understand
rjrbt
well, you are correct, that is lazy logic I was using
there shouldn't be a way*
it is not designed for there to be a way*
this absolutely needs to be vetted :)
the idea is: coordination happens in person on the handshake, and if something breaks or changes down the line: tough luck, you need to do a new handshake
parts of this are brittle by design simply because being "forgiving" can have serious escalation vulns
h0p3
mile-high view usecase time, tell me the story of alice and bob again...they meet in person, exchange pseudo-one-timepads, and now they can connect over IPFS in a way that is difficult to correlate
right?
who are Alice and Bob to you?
rjrbt
good questions. So yes, the idea is that "secrets never go over the wire" and that we use tech that is quantum ready
the idea is that handshake is a fun exploration of out-of-band tech that is decentralized
the way it is currently designed, Bob and Alice meet in person,
- Bob intiates a new handshake as "initiator" and Alice initiates a new handshake as a "peer"
- Let's assume Bob goes with the "default" strategy options. This is: salsa20 + poly1505 authenticated symetric 256 bit encrypted messages using hashmap as the mutable store for latest message
- Bob's device generate a QR code with some important initial keys, and config details
- Alice scan the QR code to do the initial handshake
- Bob and Alice p2p connect over a local LAN and send symetrically encrypted data back and forth to do the rest of the configuration
- this includes coordinating generating aroudn 100K single use 256 bit keys and 100K single use "lookupHashes"
- lookupHash is used to let the other party know which private key they will be using for a particular encrypted message. Bob and Alice get their own 100K keys, and they can use these keys in any order they want.
100k keys is just an arbitrary number, this can be scaled up or down depending on what Bob and Alice want to do.
- Bob and Alice also generate ed25519 private and public key pairs and share their pubkey's with one another
the multihash in base58 encoding of the pubkey is used for finding key-values in hashmap


h0p3
I like how you aren't afraid to use significant resources, in a sense...some of my favorite cryptography ends up being about blowing up resource usage like a baloon (in the right way, ofc). 
What kinds of local LANs?
I also think this tool is obviously paranoic. It reminds me, in a sense, of the Briar chat application.
Tor should be default.
If you are going this far down the rabbithole, might as well automagically integrate the low-hanging fruit equipment
rjrbt
ooh. I didn't know about Briar
as for TOR, it will be a first class citizen
we won't default to it, but we will make it as easy as we can to integrate with it
Briar is super neat.
h0p3
aye, very thoughtfully designed
rjrbt
the other thing about handshake is that its based around the deaddrop idea
h0p3
you are pushing the sneakernet hard
rjrbt
so that, to an ouside observer, its just a bunch of "handshake like IPFS blobs"
h0p3
even virtually
rjrbt
haha.
exactly.
this is squarely in the cyber-punk vanity project realm of projects
though I still very much think it could have good use in the right circumstances
h0p3
there is something to be said for steganography
well, I don't see your work as a mere exploration (even if it is exploring)
rjrbt
I look at this as sort of "readiness games" so that we are familiar enough with a set of tools and ways of thinking in the case that it became important to use them.
h0p3
sounds truly stoic, sir =)
rjrbt
haha.
I got inspired by the HAM radio community, since they do this sort of stuff all the time
h0p3
indeed
digital networks over HAM radio are non-trivial tools...3 letter agencies really don't like that community
rjrbt

12:15 PM
h0p3
I feel like a luddite when I talk with you sometimes; I don't mean that in a bad way.
rjrbt
heh. I've been in full "mad science" mode on this, so its hard for me to sort out external interest.
its very exciting to me, though.  :)
