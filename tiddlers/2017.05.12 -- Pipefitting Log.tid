title: 2017.05.12 -- Pipefitting Log

I'm writing this a few days later. That's not my preference, but I think it is better to have a retrospective than nothing at all. 

Friday was quite busy for me. I had spent my previous evening studying for the exam I wanted to take on Friday. When I got there, my teacher asked me if I still had to leave early. I said yes. He continued to ask questions about when, I said by 10:00 or as early as possible. He said he'd give me the test asap.

I studied more. Everyone decided they would be taking the tests early as well. I was told by Mel and Chris that since I was leaving early that the teacher was likely going to let everyone out early. The teacher usually only does a full day when I'm there: like I'm the only reason he does his job. I will find out on Monday.

I took the test. This was the longest test we've ever taken in the class. I felt fairly comfortable with it. There were a couple questions I wasn't sure about, but that's okay. I believe I did a decent job. It is known to be a difficult exam, even for those who have been pipefitting for a while. 

I gave Luke my information, and the teacher saw me. He realized that I had asked if Luke could leave early to help me. He told Luke that he could leave as well. Luke and I headed straight to the house. We basically didn't have to clean the shop at all. 

Luke and I threw away the dead dryer, and we moved the old washer into my room (in case the newer one didn't work). We had to wait for a couple hours for the lady to actually deliver it. I was on a tight schedule since I wanted to leave as soon as possible to reach my brothers house before nightfall. That didn't go the way I wanted, but that's fine. 

She showed up, and we quickly moved everything up into place. We tested the washer, it worked. The dryer, unfortunately, has a different electrical hookup. My brother says I need to do my research before I make changes. The amperage could be different, and that would be dangerous. Luke tried to fix it by pulling the ground off. Lol. A failure. We'll get there.

Afterwards, we put the washer in his truck. Since it worked, he thought he'd find a home or use for it. Then we mounted the door, got something to drink, and then packed up and left. We arrived 2 hours later than I thought we would at my brother's house. It was a productive day, and it was a start to a good weekend.
