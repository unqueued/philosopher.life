How's your weekend going?
SUN 2:28 PM
It’s going. I might be coming down with something but it’s hard to tell for sure.
SUN 5:39 PM
I hope not!
SUN 5:58 PM
I'm so confused. My stomach feels sour, but not sick. I'm not sure what the issue is...
SUN 6:03 PM
Hm.
SUN 6:03 PM
You feel any tightness in your chest?<<ref "2020.02.12-1">>
SUN 6:05 PM
Maybe a tiny bit?
SUN 6:05 PM
I don't know either.
SUN 6:06 PM
Web MD says it's cancer.
SUN 6:06 PM
:D
SUN 6:06 PM
Lol!
SUN 6:06 PM
Random: But I think I'm gonna start messaging [[JRE]] every day too on here.
SUN 6:07 PM
!
SUN 6:07 PM
=)
SUN 6:08 PM
So, I have noticed a significant change in how you communicate this year. I think it's fucking awesome.<<ref "2020.02.12-2">>
SUN 6:09 PM
The last time I hit him up was on is bday, and I never got a response back.<<ref "2020.02.12-3">>
SUN 6:09 PM
thanks!
SUN 6:09 PM
I'm trying super hard, haha
SUN 6:09 PM
I can tell! Lol. I'm pretty blown away by it.
SUN 6:09 PM
I think my change is starting to affect others too, because I am seeing a slight resurgence in friends and family meeting me halfway in this same regard.
SUN 6:12 PM
Fruit to my labor. :)
SUN 6:12 PM
And more healthy relationships all around
SUN 6:13 PM
It is tough to not here responses back.
SUN 6:24 PM
hear*
SUN 6:25 PM
Yeah, my resolve to do this for so many people is really showcasing just how many people don't care to message back, no matter how much I try.
SUN 6:26 PM
Yup. =(
SUN 6:29 PM
Let's show 'em how it's done.<<ref "2020.02.12-4">>
SUN 6:29 PM
Hell yeah1 lol
SUN 6:29 PM
Man fuck typos
SUN 6:29 PM
lol
SUN 6:29 PM
:sweat_smile:
SUN 6:29 PM
You will have to tell me what it means to DM for yourself in a 1-man D&D game. It may not even be conceptually possible all the way down, and I'm interested in knowing why.
SUN 6:31 PM
Wait what?
SUN 6:32 PM
Ah, I am curious about how you would DM a game with you as the player.
SUN 6:32 PM
just you!
SUN 6:32 PM
I think I would just call it writing a book. xD
SUN 6:33 PM
lol
SUN 6:33 PM
I'm still interested in writing a book with a d20!
SUN 6:33 PM
I think it would be an interesting, albeit uneven experience.
SUN 6:33 PM
I have an idea.
SUN 6:33 PM
Hit me!
SUN 6:35 PM
[[JRE]] has asked me to write science fiction. I do entertain it, but I'm really not skilled enough, imho. I'm not a storyteller in the right way for fiction, imho. Still, I like to think about it.
SUN 6:35 PM
I've long though that rolling for characters (even in buckets of narrowed down characters) and forcing myself to introduce the character to the story would be fun. It reminds me of a dice game I use to play with my kids.
SUN 6:36 PM
We throw dice with pictures or words on them, and we'd have to create a narrative by sequencing them and building the relationships between these objects.
SUN 6:37 PM
http://tvtropes.org/
SUN 6:38 PM
That is a wonderful rabbithole to me.
SUN 6:38 PM
Tv tropes is GREAT
SUN 6:38 PM
Those dice sound like a ton of fun too<<ref "2020.02.12-5">>
SUN 6:38 PM
If I had to write a book with dice, that would be one of my dice games I played.
SUN 6:39 PM
That might be stupid, I don't know.
SUN 6:40 PM
I don't think so
SUN 6:40 PM
It would be experimental!
SUN 6:40 PM
Agreed.
SUN 6:41 PM
It would be empirical. =)
SUN 6:41 PM
I think it's something that would would great in a shorter format with a meta spin, informing the reader of what was happening behind the scenes.
SUN 6:41 PM
Sounds like a graphic novel to me.
SUN 6:42 PM
Also, the question of what makes a character valuable is not a simple one. Are there characters or groups of characters in tvtropes that are more valuable than others, and why? That is not an easy problem to solve.
SUN 6:44 PM
Machine learning targets monetizable story arcs, characterization, etc. in movie scripts.
SUN 6:49 PM
Will the market be able to define which story arcs and characters matter the most?
SUN 6:49 PM
One of my concerns is how we tell ourselves the stories of [[Humanity]] as humanely as possible.
SUN 6:55 PM
Well and the medium can portray those characters in incredibly different ways too.
SUN 6:55 PM
The same archetype would likely appear differently in movie form, book form, anime, theater, and everything inbetween
SUN 6:56 PM
Just because of the stereotypical media conventions!
SUN 6:56 PM
It would appear differently, but the question is who made the story and why? I'm still looking for the human story. That is part of  what interests me about your dice-augmented authorship idea.
SUN 7:10 PM
So are you saying that you are looking for an engaging story about humanity behind this gimmick?
SUN 7:48 PM
I'm not convinced it's a gimmick.
SUN 7:48 PM
True. It might just be an untapped genre
SUN 7:49 PM
:)
SUN 7:49 PM
D&D uses dice to tell emerging stories both in and outside of play that are quite real to me.
SUN 7:49 PM
The book is a different medium to portray the characters than D&D, but they obviously have something in common.
SUN 7:50 PM
Serious conceptual bridges.
SUN 7:50 PM
Magic is another great example. You do tap that genre.
SUN 7:52 PM
Some mechanics lend themselves to particular tropes and storylines more than others. We tell each other stories through our dice, through cardboard interactions and a social convention about the rules which regulate the cardboard, etc. I am convinced, philosophically, that randomness to some non-trivial extent is necessary for meaning and the kind of empirical computation which gives rise to trust and empathy. We need experiments to learn what is worth having faith in.

SUN 8:01 PM
I think this idea would benefit from this specific dice system!
SUN 8:01 PM
Perhaps I do not understand. That sounds like a way to hunt for story arcs. That is another kind of dice throw to add to the mix.
SUN 8:03 PM
:thinking_face:
SUN 8:04 PM
Are we still talking about using dice to write a story?
SUN 8:04 PM
I don't see why not. I must be missing something.
SUN 8:05 PM
Likewise. Lmao
SUN 8:06 PM
lol
SUN 8:07 PM
I’m also studying for a quiz so my attention is a bit divided. XD
SUN 8:07 PM
My bad!
SUN 8:07 PM
First mythology quiz!
SUN 8:07 PM
Oh, study away! =) We will talk about it later.
SUN 8:07 PM
How hard do you think it will be?
SUN 8:07 PM
If it’s hard, I will be genuinely shocked.
SUN 8:07 PM
I’m just gonna memorize the 12 Olympian gods then wing the rest.<<ref "2020.02.12-6">>
SUN 8:08 PM
Cool.
SUN 8:08 PM
I was recently introduced to Yggdrasil.
SUN 8:09 PM
Did I tell you that he made us watch Pan’s Labyrinth for glass?
SUN 8:09 PM
Class***
SUN 8:09 PM
Yeah? Tell me more! :)
SUN 8:09 PM
That is amazing.
SUN 8:09 PM
Norse Mythology is great
SUN 8:09 PM
Yggdrasil is Norse right?
SUN 8:09 PM
Yes. I know little at all about most mythologies. Yggdrasil keeps popping up for me though.
SUN 8:10 PM
It's a big tree.
SUN 8:12 PM
The tree of all life right?
SUN 8:12 PM
It’s been awhile for me. Hah
SUN 8:12 PM
It connects different worlds.
SUN 8:13 PM
Saw a network protocol with it: https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/
SUN 8:13 PM
Good name for their network! :laughing:
SUN 8:17 PM
No doubt.

I don't know. You know what I fear: even if I lived in the same city, part of them wouldn't want to build with me consistently. I am one huge asshole, I know (I mean: do you see these words?).

I also fear that my new brother is kinda alone...or he doesn't understand just how big the gaps are (blissfully, perhaps). I'm hoping that he will eventually jump into doing the [[PSM]] wiki thing too. It'd be right up his alley.">>
