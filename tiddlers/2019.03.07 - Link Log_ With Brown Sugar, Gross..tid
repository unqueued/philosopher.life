//I sift my sifting without hesitation while drunk (fool). Fascinating problem arising: the "I still don't have remotely enough comprehension or opinion" few are leftover, and it leaves residue windows more and more. I've got 13 fucking windows open in the workspace now? Fuck me. I never have enough time. That's okay though, right? It's gonna be fuzzy and worse.//

** https://numenta.com/blog/2019/01/16/the-thousand-brains-theory-of-intelligence/
*** Wat. That means I've flipped it. Or, it means there is far more parallelism that I envisioned. Okay. Fine.

*** Ultimately, I'm one layer below in this dialectic. I'm not able to speak effectively enough.

*** If I'm analog, I have a hard time believing analog isn't part of the answer.
** https://theantimedia.com/universe-conscious/
*** Convinced dualism will always prevent me from giving an answer either direction. Sorry folks. Hilariously, it's the dualists going this far. I think it splits both ways (thanks Kant).

** https://www.zdnet.com/article/intels-neuro-guru-slams-deep-learning-its-not-actually-learning/
*** zdn, ikr, but that might be right. Still in analog mode. It's like the difference between rationalism and empiricism as energy efficiency to me.

*** Should see my wiki. Jesus.
** https://phys.org/news/2019-03-welding-breakthrough.html

*** GO 4 IT. I'm not convinced you can make those kinds of input+output differences equivalent enough.
** https://lwn.net/Articles/687294/
*** Jesus, Marlin. Centralization of power is convenient, but it isn't pragmatic in the end. Call me a moralizer all you want. You've already lost (and I use your fucking software). This is the one thing I really hate about it. I fear you don't want to lose control of it.

*** Aint' gonna stawp it. You fuckers are responsible. Don't even act like you are responsible for the company you work for. Fully fight back (give it all to the poor to makeup for your transgressions) or KYS.
