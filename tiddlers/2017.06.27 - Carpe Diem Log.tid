title: 2017.06.27 - Carpe Diem Log

* I had a nightmare about being in the car with my parents. See [[2017.06.27 - h0p3's Log]]. I started writing it here but realized this is the wrong place for it.
* I woke up right before the alarm clock. 
* I didn't work crazy hard on what I usually do in the shop. I did work hard though, it was on strategizing, planning, and thinking about the means to my ends.
* Lunch was great (I basically ate two, lol), and I was able to connect with my family over Pidgin.
* I've tried contacting several people today, including the Landlord. The light isn't quite fixed. Also, we may have a different leak next to the dishwasher. Lol. It's been busy!
* The kids were on task, and I'm glad. I did some studying as well.
* Fireman time!
* We went swimming, grilled, and had a good time.
* Worked on my wiki.
* I tried very hard to get udev to run a script when my USB drive was inserted. I've done everything, and it doesn't work. I give up. Lol.
* Turns out my kids didn't finish their wikis. =(
* Rick and Morty until I fell asleep.
