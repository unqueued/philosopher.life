title: Intuitionist Finitist Constructivism

This account of logic denies the law of excluded middle as an axiom, thus reductio ad absurdum arguments are not valid moves.<<ref "1">> Propositions concerned with the finite still maintain bivalence, but this does not extend to infinite notions. It is a verificationist epistemology about the existential quantifier, taking the law of excluded middle to be merely inductively and empirically justified from our experiences (and thus doubtable).<<ref "2">> This is idealism such that what can be known to each of us is limited to our subjective experiences. 

On Intuitionist Logic, there are three valences:

* True
* False
* Can be judged T or F, but not dedicable right now (i.e. we cannot prove it)

Essentially, the law of the excluded middle implies //every mathematical problem has a solution//. As a computationalist, I take this to be the denial of the principle of sufficient reason. This is the pre-Socratic Godellian enterpise. It speaks to the heart of realism and anti-realism, the nature of the relationship between epistemology (mind) and ontology.

It is a profound puzzle that on the one hand mathematical truths seem to have a compelling inevitability, but on the other hand the source of their "truthfulness" remains elusive.
