!! What would you say to your loved ones if you could tell them absolutely anything?

I'm not trying to sound too cynical here (too late! ;P), but I feel like this question is designed to be manipulative. God damnit, Samwise. You think you are going to trick me into blurting out what I've been holding in or wrestling with something I'd normally hide from myself? I'm sure that folkpsych mentalist bullshit works with the average person, but I'm a madman, dude. Have you seen my ~~movies~~ wiki?
