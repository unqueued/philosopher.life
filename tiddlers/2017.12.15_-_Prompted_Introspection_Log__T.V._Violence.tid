title: 2017.12.15 - Prompted Introspection Log: T.V. Violence

!! What is your opinion about the amount of violence on T.V.?

I haven't had cable for 11 years because piracy simply delivers a better product. Also, a non-trivial amount of video I watch isn't on traditional television content platforms. This question, in a sense, is a bit outdated. Perhaps you just mean video generally consumed by the public. 

I think media can be a form of violence towards its consumers. That, of course, is not what you are talking about. You are trying to narrow this down to violence embedded in the content of TV itself. 

Is this a loss of innocence question? Meh.

It is this about desensitizing our minds, teaching us to normalize violence? Not obviously.

I think it's important to see the reality of evil. My only problem with violence in the media is that it fails to be realistic enough. I think violence is also not simply physical, and that needs to be accurately captured and identified as well. I think we need more redpills.
