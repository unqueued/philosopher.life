title: Acceptance

I must accept that my parents lacked empathy in their lives, that they are the result of the [[Adult Children of Alcoholics]] (ACOA) process. Consequently, I am as well. I'm trying to forgive their mistakes, even if they aren't willing to forgive mine. 

I am not convinced they will be able to withhold judgment, to fundamentally empathize with me. They have so much skin in the game, they cannot see clearly. It is already very difficult to appreciate my point of view. I must accept that, to some large extent, they cannot empathize with me. I think empathizing with me would require facing their own demons, which they cannot afford (but, then, why am I expected to afford it?). They are very strong people, but they were not prepared for this (would would be?).

[[KIN]]:If you burn me, then you burn me. I simply have to trust you. That's the only thing which can make me happy.

[[RPIN]]: Ah, but trust comes in degrees. To what degree should I trust you? What does it even mean to have degrees of trust? Is it systematically not really trusting if you don't have the right configuration of trusting instances or guiding principles? 

Be wise in your extension of trust. But, that also means be wise in your extension of empathy. You have finite emotional and intellectual resources. How much are they worth spending on? Think of this as a risk analysis problem.

I have to recognize that as much my parents want to love me, sometimes they won't. They want to follow the Golden Rule, but they cannot always apply it to me in vital ways (and vice versa). I must accept them as they are. I hate what that means. It means we likely will never be close again (let's fight against this!). It means I'm in defensive mode with them. It means I can't be vulnerable to them like as I used to. I can trust their intentions to a large extent, but I cannot trust their judgment in generating the contextual content of maxims. 

I don't want to lie with them. I want to be myself. I will need to set healthier boundaries with them.

I must accept that we are in a tit-for-tat game of rebuilding our trust and empathy. It is the most successful game-theoretic way to generate trust. It is a sad game to have to play. 


------------------------

Can we accept that we will have differing opinions? Can we navigate that messy affair? Can we really empathize with each other? Can we accept each other? What is a friendship that can't do these things (is that even a friendship)? I want a deep friendship with you.
