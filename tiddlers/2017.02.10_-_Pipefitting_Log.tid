title: 2017.02.10 - Pipefitting Log

Ask, and ye shall receive. Today, my teacher threw me a curveball and I struck out (although, I thankfully didn't land on my ass). He told me he purposely designed it to fool me, and it did (I'm glad I at least offer the appearance of humility in my face and words when I ask him to check my work). The schematic had a beautiful trick in it that made it easy to misread. He said, "I finally gotcha! You did something wrong," and he smiled with pride. I took it in stride and laughed with him. It was bound to happen. I knew at once where the mistake was to be found. Something felt really funny about that part of the schematic, and I didn't pay enough attention to really understand what it should look like. It was a clever curveball. I told him what I thought my mistake was and how it was supposed to look. 

By not understanding the schematic well enough, I could not perform the fitting<<ref "1">> math, which meant that not only was my shape wrong, but the lengths were slightly off. I took the offending portion of the construct apart, and thankfully I had spare pipes ready just in case I needed them (be prepared to fail). I fixed it very quickly. 

Afterward, I asked to see a stack of schematics. I clearly need practice in understanding them. I want it to be second nature, like reading a map I've seen a thousand times or reading English, etc. I must remember that nobody does this instantly. I must work for it. My hard work will pay off; my talent will shine; I will succeed eventually; I will breathe this. Being someone who understands will be useful. I suspect it will be something that separates me and maximizes the value others see in me. It is bargaining power and mobility. Anyways, he gave me a stack of actual CAD schematics used in actual projects. They are different in some ways, with way more information to decipher. There is much to learn.

The teacher said that he was worried that I would not be able to say he challenged me on his course evaluations. He said he didn't know why the other students are there, but he knew I was there to become a pipefitter. This is the second day that my partner Nash has missed. He can't afford to miss that many days before he gets kicked out. Our class dwindles. 

I visited the union training facility again today. The boss man wasn't there, but I met another guy who seemed relatively high on the totem pole. It was obvious to him in the course of our conversation that I didn't know much of anything. After he found out that I was nobody, he was far less interested in me. Redpills for everyone.
