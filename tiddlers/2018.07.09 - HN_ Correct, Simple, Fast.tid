title: 2018.07.09 - HN: Correct, Simple, Fast

Correct, [Simple|Fast]: In That Order.

The above is definitely the correct algorithm. Surely you don't think it is wrong! Come at me, bro!

If you aren't trying to make your representation correct, then why bother? Correctness is either the telos or closest of these in the pursuit of the telos (the assumed intrinsic purpose). To make it simple and fast are the instrumental (and heuristical) means to increasingly correct versions of that correctness end(s). You can only ever simplify a representation (hello, Kant!) because you never have complete (hello, Gödel!) access to the thing-in-itself directly.

The representation is the only thing you can consciously (the Daseinic emergent result of the non-conscious [that you know of: problem of other minds, OOO, dualist's hard problem of consciousness, etc.] aspects of your brain using language to talk to itself) attend to; it's the only way to tell and retell these stories to yourself. How correctly can you recursively represent correctness? I can only begin to meaningfully compute by starting with a meaningful notion of correctness as my foundation (however flawed it may objectively be), else it is meaningless. What does it mean to correctly tell yourself about an object if you don't assume the concept of correctness in how you tell yourself about an object?

In a sense, you beg the question of the Ontological Proof (hello Kantian idealist vs Gödelian realist in dialectic!), the reality of the possibility of the goodiest good of your program (and I suggest even beyond), in thinking about the telos of your program (and, clearly, you change your mind about what counts as that).

Simplifying and/or optimizing a representation already begs the question of having something to be correct about. "Simplify" according to what standard? The pursuit of correctness is the necessary precondition to having a reason to take the means. Epistemic justification in coding computers (be they silicon or brains) is inevitably tied to this telic processs and metanarrative. We do not escape the chain of sublations. Be a transcendental coder! I believe in you, folks. I know you care about correctness, deep down. Don't you want to be correct about this code too?

It's dangerous to go alone! Take this: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism
