Having a scattered day today..how are you?
WED 1:29 PM
Yeah, not enough time in the day here.
WED 1:29 PM
It's going.
WED 1:29 PM
I start something and get distracted and then I have piles of half finished thing :flushed::face_with_rolling_eyes::grinning_face_with_one_large_and_one_small_eye:
WED 1:30 PM
Scatter brained today
WED 1:30 PM
That is my life sometimes. I'm not sure how to make that better, lol.
WED 1:41 PM
Me either —grateful it’s not every day ...
WED 1:43 PM
My friend is trying to work through stuff with her angry spouse...so far ok but both need counseling
WED 2:36 PM
Not sure it’s gonna work so I am trying to be a safe space
WED 2:36 PM
Ohhh and I like your DC goal.  [[UJ]] wants to take a trip there too
WED 2:37 PM
I'm glad she knows she has a safe place with you. How far away is she? Does she have her own transportation? Does he know where you live?
WED 2:47 PM
That goal is just a dream right now. It would be awesome if we get to go.
WED 2:47 PM
Less than 5 miles. Yes she has her own car but would might be too stressed to drive. I told her to call and I will come get her. Yes he knows where we live but he’s not a big guy and I am not scared
WED 2:49 PM
Lol. K
WED 2:50 PM
Good
WED 2:50 PM
Yeah we are going to have to save for that ...
WED 2:50 PM
He would also like to go to Europe for our 20th anniversary. That would be awesome but not sure that’s gonna happen. I would like Great Britain (Scotland, Ireland etc) more than the others
WED 2:52 PM
That would be amazing.
WED 2:53 PM
Something to work for
WED 2:54 PM
Must go hunt for caffeine if I am going to survive teacher’s meeting today...:sleeping:.. blarg
