!! Audit:

* I am excited to see my daughter work in Rust and my son in Python+Bash. I'm hoping we can build some really cool things.
* I can see it has been a very busy month.
* It's interesting to see my resolutions.
* I'm pleased with the commentary. It's brief, but I'm catching moments I need. 
* I'm glad I started and stopped on Rust.
* I can see I'm struggling with depressive tendencies this month.
* Some of my days have been very busy.
* I need to move back into a more practical realm, although that is not to say I should stop working on these projects entirely. I simply have bigger fish to fry this moment. My family needs money, and that's where I need to direct myself right now.
