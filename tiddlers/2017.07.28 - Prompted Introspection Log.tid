!! Define Unschooling

It's a method of allowing your children to guide their own studies. It reminds me of the Dewey Method. It has obvious risks and flaws. The worry, of course, is that a child isn't wise, experienced, or intelligent enough to direct their own studies. It's a double-edged sword. This risk is also what may be its greatest. It's a tool to force children to do what adults have to do in their own studies. It is a motivational tool. It's very much like the real world. 

It allows a child to focus on what matters to them. Nothing is forced, everything is chosen. There aren't timeslots, categories, etc. It's about managing your own time and energy.
