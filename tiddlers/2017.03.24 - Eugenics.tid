title: 2017.03.24 - Eugenics

I use to be pro-life, top to bottom, hardcore pacifism and all. Now that I have seen the value in taking my own life, in realizing how less precious life really is, in realizing that some lives aren't worth living, in realizing that death is sometimes a compassionate gift to so many human beings in so many contexts, I've lost my pro-life stance.

Once the Kantian Bubble is burst, it is up to the Utilitarian to pick up the pieces and find the more rational argument.

If shaping our genes is really about shaping the sum of human experiences, then what is eugenics really? Is eugenics really just modifying genes in a good way? What counts as a good way? The contents of that are probably spelled out in a utilitarian calculus or weighing model of human goods. Our happiness matters to eugenics. Good for whom?

Abortions are often or always eugenic, depending on how we think about it. Euthanasia seems highly eugenic to me in certain ways. It seems obvious that genetic manipulation is eugenic. We might even think that gene testing and genome sequencing are profound tools of eugenics. The person who doesn't have a baby because they predict a high chance of birth defects is engaging in eugenics, and so is the person who aborts their down-syndrome fetus. The person who sterilizes anyone for any reason is doing a kind of eugenics. Those who don't have kids because they know they would be bad parents are practicing eugenics. That we pay people to get kicked in the balls in video productions like Jackass (and numerous Youtube copycats) is a form of eugenics. That we don't wish to destroy our own genes is eugenics (mmm... cancer is bad...mmmmkay). That we think we should reproduce is a form of eugenics (you probably think you're improving the gene pool don't you, idiot?). That we have married bloodlines, that we care about the status and genetics (even if only as it pertains to the memetics) of our children's spouses.

Ultimately, who is hurt? A ball of cells that don't have the nervous system necessary to feel pain like ours? Doesn't seem like it is really hurt. Now, as the fetus develops, it can feel pain. What if we ended its life without it feeling pain? What's wrong with that? It wasn't a person at all. It was still a lump of flesh and no more. Even those who are not even conceived miss out on opportunities. They are mere possibilities. They aren't persons though. We have no duties to them except insofar as they become persons.

Why shouldn't you trash the world? Because you owe duties to fetuses that will eventually grow enough to become persons. Does that mean you owe duties to all fetuses? No.
