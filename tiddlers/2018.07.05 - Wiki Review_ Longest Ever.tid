title: 2018.07.05 - Wiki Review: Longest Ever

* [[2018.07.04 - Wuliheron: Fellow Nomad]]
** This failed...
* [[Wuliheron]]
** Dramatically. He's brilliant, but not capable of conversing with others effectively.
* [[TEOTWAWKI]]
** Storing it up.
* [[2015.01.06 - Symbolic Logic: Final]]
** I'm always sad by how little ground I was able to cover in class.
* [[2015.01.06 - Symbolic Logic: Midterm]]
** However, I do like my tests. They are gorgeous documents, comprehensive yet easy to grade.
* [[2015.01.06 - Symbolic Logic: Multiple Quantifiers]]
** These lecture notes aren't very good. There are errors in them!

* [[2015.06.27 - Intro to Phil: Syllabus]]
** This was such an odd class to teach, and it satellite was clearly a diploma mill. It was morally reprehensible.
* [[2015.07.20 - Intro to Phil: Paper Requirements]]
** I still have the papers they turned in. They are beyond terrible (I'm not picky either!).
* [[2015.07.06 - Intro to Phil: Intro]]
** I'm glad I have something to say on the first day. If I were going to continue to be a professor, I think I would become much better at this process, refining it, etc.
* [[2015.08.03 - Intro to Phil: Authority and The State]]

** This is a useful class for me to teach. I learned a lot about myself from doing it. I will eventually go through these with my children. It was part of what made me cast off my yolk. Again, the lecture notes suck. Sorry!

* [[2013.12.05 - Philosophy of Law: Class Notes]]

** She was the inspiration for this. I can see that I want to branch out.
** Edited.
* [[2013.04.25 - Skepticism: Wright]]
