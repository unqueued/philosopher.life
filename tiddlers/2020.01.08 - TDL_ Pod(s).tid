title: 2020.01.08 - TDL: Pod(s)

* At least one more pod must be cleared, but I'd prefer both.
* There's so much to put away, and the kitchen is a wreck.
** Our meal will just need to be ghetto. 
* Make space for your offspring to write.
* TIAA
* Maybe we can set up the beds together.
** I'm grateful just to have a mattress. Things I've missed for the past couple weeks.
