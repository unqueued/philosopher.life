!! Respond to the following gem:

Anytime you have to rely upon your enemy for a job youâ€™re in bad shape.

The gist is correct, but it's not literally true. One can fabricate ad hoc examples here which meet the conditions and hardly qualify as "bad shape." Of course, generally speaking, this is almost always true. Slap a "nearly" or an "almost" on there and we're set. In capitalism, it becomes worse when they know you know they are your enemy too. Decentralizing power through structures which themselves are continuously decentralized appears to be the best way to cooperate and live peacefully with otherwise enemies, but violence is required to implement such a thing. It aint pretty. It's not the easy going tolerance and sympathy for the basic human condition we prize. The obligation to be violent in some contexts, including our own, is the horrible truth which we encounter again and again in history. We begin with memetic violence and philosophical wrestling, but it must often escalate. We likely must all participate in justified coercion to appreciate what's at stake.
