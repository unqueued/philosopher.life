!! About:

//Music is a rationally irrational, quantitatively qualitative atmospheric drug. My favorite kind of music is the kind that makes me feel.//

<<<
The music was human; the static was natural.

-- John Updike

Music is a drug that is accepted by most social conventions in a broad set of contexts, which is quite rare among most of my drugs. It gives me legit commonground with some people just because it is the least qualia-ridden of them. That I can use it in public settings and alongside most kinds of activities gives it enormous utility and range as well. That's part of why I should invest more heavily in how I consume it. 

As to my music appreciation, I make no claims to having a list that will be well-conceived or acceptable to anyone with "good" taste (//I'm so cool, I don't care//). Somehow, speaking about music in public always requires explanatory caveats and justifying virtue signals, so here goes nothing. 

I wouldn't say I'm musically illiterate, but I'm also not a vapid fanatic obsessed with defining myself through music. To be clear, I've formally played musical instruments (primarily piano, clarinet, guitar, and banjo) since I was 9-years-old in a wide variety of settings (including recitals, gigs, instruction, post-secondary classes, and competition). I bought mp3 players before there was an iPod, and I've been pirating since 1997 (hail dial-up). I love consuming music; I tend to average +6 hours a day. I've got all the credibility I need in order to justifiably say I appreciate music, thank you very much.

As I have noted in my [[Prompted Introspection Log]], music is a drug of mine. I like repetitive music (perhaps even moreso than the average person). I'm a high-functioning autistic person, so I try not to be too surprised (that happens enough in my bottom-up reasoning). I abuse this drug to help me get into the diffuse mode, to leverage my non-conscious Fastmind, and to stimulate a ready-to-hand experience.

Perhaps annoyingly, I rarely care about lyrics, although you will find [[major exceptions|Hymns of h0p3]].<<ref "nm">> Being that I have a sensory processing disorder, I often can't hear or remember them, or at least they don't trickle into my Daseinic experience as strongly as it does for neurotypicals.<<ref "of">> To whatever extent it is stored, I simply can't access it as I might other kinds of memories. There are exceptions, of course. Despite all this, I'm hardpressed to see why I should give a shit what most musicians have to say. Let's be real, they make sounds homo sapiens like to hear, but that doesn't give us reasons to think the meanings of their words are worth our time. Music is art, but it's not nearly as expressive as most people seem to think. It's intrinsically emotional but only instrumentally reasonable. Perhaps insufferably to most, the sound of the music, including the vocals devoid of the semantics of the lyrics, is what I usually aim to hear, even though I make no claims to doing so effectively. 

I am halfway to being a musical relativist, suffering my usual vertiginous [[gfwiwcgws]] considerations. I think our tastes evolve by requiring escalating surprise, irony, syncopation, distortions, and essentially dissonance in our music to remain entertained on the musical hedonic treadmill. Of course, our tastes crystallize, and nostalgia is a powerful emotion as well. 

Since music is a drug, I deliberately select music to push my primal buttons. I'm not sure what (if anything) my music tastes say about me, but I'm not sure if I care too much either. Music, of course, does say something about us, but teasing out what that story is requires context that simply can't be expressed by looking at lists. Thus, the primary unironic hipsterian anti-hipster snowflake political statement hypothesis I hope to make about music is this: at least for mere humans, if your identity can be significantly expressed in music or its selection, you must have a fairly shallow identity.<<ref "kg">>

I spend almost none of my time looking for new music anymore (although, I should). Once in a while, I have a tiny rabbithole or a recommendation, but that is rare. From what I can tell, there will always be low-hanging fruit which just falls into my lap over the years. I often associate music with where I initially heard it (from watching a movie, playing a video game, wandering, etc.), though not always (some grow on you differently). There is a price to pay for this laziness: my music selection may come off as unimaginative to others, /shrug. So, I concede: my tastes in music are wholly unoriginal; I often adore mainstream music. I don't think I have interests in obscurity, although I recognize some songs are more widely consumed than others. I think my love of run-of-the-mill music may be one of the most neurotypical aspects about me. I'd argue it is even a marginal form of empathy.

I love popular music quite a bit; the wisdom of the crowds is often my curator. Classics are classics for a reason, amiright? I'm a simplistic musical sheepleton who goes wherever the wind takes him in the world of music (be it popular or otherwise). Consider my dissent commodified and my consent manufactured. I openly admit my preferences have been strongly manipulated by others around me in this respect. It is a reminder of my lack of autonomy. My inauthentic tastes (just like all the rest of you faggots™) could be boiled down to a handful of catchy tropes and simplistic music structures algorithmically compiled (what the fuck do you think comprises music in your brain?). Yet, I will still cherish it. Yes, it's all been done before, but I still get the qualia cake. I'm not here to be cool (even though I //so obviously// am); I'm here to use this drug price-efficiently.

It may also concern you (for what reason I do not comprehend) that I don't ultimately care about origins of content, plagiarism, or intellectual property. Whatever sound, mix, or version I like is what I like, and I've no interest in participating in any unjustified social conventions or immoral legal games regarding this drug. Essentially, I often don't give a shit; just please, [[don't stop the music|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd8jh9QYfEs]]. 

Again, I'm just injecting music into my brain for the pleasure chemicals. Like most art, music boils down to the primitive sounds and accompanying visual signals of primates seeking to emotionally influence others primates (usually in fairly complex social contexts). Music may be mere rhetoric and simulation, but I know what kind of animal I am. These are nootropics, buttons-pushers, emotional stimulants, and primal experience machines. Give me music which has demonstrated a high [[S2NR]] amongst people most like me, a contextualized guttural memetic fitness worth devouring. I'm jonesing for my music to skullfuck me.

<<footnotes "nm" "I'm really bad with names too. All I have are these imprints of music in me. I know I've heard a song before; I can feel it again. I usually can't tell you the title or artist, and I probably can't name the subgenre, era, or other contextual considerations either. Sorry, bro. I don't think I'm a poser, but I just don't find it worth my time to handle this shortcoming of mine.">>

<<footnotes "of" "I'm reminded of visiting old folks on their deathbeds, many of whom had lost their minds to the point that they didn't know their own names and couldn't speak. But, when we would sing hymns like //Amazing Grace//, they would light up and begin singing with us. These broken toy-humans who were otherwise non-functioning actually remembered the lyrics like it was yesterday. My brain is dysfunctional in this respect (and many others, I assure you).">>

<<footnotes "kg" "Hold up, I hear Kierkegaard coming. Everyone be cool; we don't need to hear him droning yet again. Also, the same can be said for many other aesthetics and mere virtue signals. For example, it's just as shallow to build your identity around food, obsessing over what you should and shouldn’t eat, with no conception (let alone moral behavior which must stem from) recognizing how many people barely have complete meals to eat each day.">>
