Music is a drug that is accepted in most social conventions, which is quite rare among most of my drugs. That I can use it in public settings and alongside most kinds of activities gives it enormous utility and range. That's part of why I should invest more heavily in it as an activity.

To the haters, I make no claims to having a list that will be well-conceived or acceptable to anyone with "good" taste. I wouldn't say I'm musically illiterate, but I'm not a fanatic obsessed with defining myself through music. To be clear, I've formally played music since I was 9 in a wide variety of settings (including instruction). I bought mp3 players before there was an iPod, and I've been pirating since 1997. I love consuming music; I tend to average +6 hours a day. As I have noted in my [[Prompted Introspection Log]], music is a drug of mine. I like repetitive music (perhaps even moreso than the average person). I'm a high-functioning autistic person, so I try not to be too surprised (that happens enough in my bottom-up reasoning). I abuse this drug to help me get into the diffuse mode, to leverage my non-conscious Fastmind, and to stimulate a ready-to-hand experience.

Perhaps annoyingly, I rarely care about lyrics.<<ref "nm">> Being that I have a sensory processing disorder, I often can't hear or remember them, or at least they don't trickle into my Daseinic experience as strongly as it does for neurotypicals. If it is stored, I simply can't access it as I might other kinds of memories. There are exceptions, of course. Despite all this, I'm hardpressed to see why I should give a shit what most musicians have to say. Let's be real, they make sounds homo sapiens like to hear, but that doesn't give us reasons to think the meanings of their words are worth our time. Music is art, but it's not nearly as expressive as most people seem to think. It's emotional, not reasonable. The sound of the music, including the vocals devoid of the semantics of the lyrics, is what I //usually// aim to hear. 

I am halfway to being a musical relativist, suffering the usual [[gfwiwcgws]] considerations. I think our tastes evolve by requiring escalating surprise, irony, syncopation, distortions, and essentially dissonance in our music to remain entertained. Of course, our tastes crystallize, and nostalgia is a powerful emotion as well. Since music is a drug, I deliberately select music to push my primal buttons. I'm not sure what (if anything) my music tastes says about me, but I'm not sure if I care too much either. Music, of course, does say something about us, but teasing out what that story is requires context that simply can't be expressed by looking at lists. Unfortunately, if your identity can significantly expressed in music, you must have a fairly shallow identity.

I spend almost none of my time looking for new music anymore. Once in a while I have a tiny rabbithole or a recommendation, but that is usually rare. From what I can tell, there will always be low-hanging fruit which just falls into my lap over the years. I often associate music with where I initially heard it (from watching a movie, playing a video game, wandering, etc.). There is a price to pay for this laziness: my music selection may come off as unimaginative to others, /shrug. So, I concede: my tastes in music are wholly unoriginal. I would argue I'm no hipster because I often adore mainstream music. I don't think I have interests in obscurity, although I recognize some songs are more widely consumed than others. I think my love of run-of-the-mill music may be one of the most neurotypical aspects about me. 

I love popular music quite a bit; the wisdom of the crowds is often my curator. Classics are classics for a reason, amiright? I'm a simplistic musical sheepleton who goes wherever the wind takes him in the world of music (be it popular or otherwise). Consider my dissent commodified and my consent manufactured. I openly admit my preferences have been strongly manipulated by the others around me in this respect. It is a reminder of my lack of autonomy. My inauthentic tastes could be boiled down to a handful of catchy tropes and simplistic music structures compiled algorithmically. Yet, I will still cherish it. Yes, it's all been done before, but I still get the qualia cake. I'm not here to be cool; I'm here to use this drug price-efficiently.

It may also concern you (for what reason I do not comprehend) that I don't care about the original content, plagiarism, or intellectual property. Whatever sound, mix, or version I like is what I like, and I've no interest in participating in any unjustified social conventions or legal games regarding this drug. Essentially, I often don't give a shit; just please, [[don't stop the music|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd8jh9QYfEs]]. 

Again, I'm just injecting music into my brain for the pleasure chemicals and other utility. These are nootropics, buttons-pushers, emotional stimulants, and primal experience machines. Give me music which has demonstrated a high signal-to-noise ratio, a memetic fitness worth devouring. I'm jonesing for my music to skullfuck me.

<<foonotes "nm" "I'm really bad with names too. All I have are these imprints of music in me. I know I've heard a song before; I can feel it again. I usually can't tell you the title or artist, and I probably can't name the subgenre, era, or other contextual considerations either. Sorry, bro. I don't think I'm a poser, but I just don't find it worth my time to handle this shortcoming of mine.">>
