13 hours ago
 my daughter figured it out fo r me yesterday

 I'm basically nesting tabs insides of tabs like branches

 what you up to this weekend?
11 hours ago
 Going to friends house to take a meal and see the new baby.  Just heading out of the house now.  Plus, their other two kids can play with ours.
11 hours ago
 neat
11 hours ago
 Just tried zerotier. I think I'm in love.
11 hours ago
 It's Hamachi on steroids
11 hours ago
 It's absolutely disgustingly easy
11 hours ago
 We brought every computer on our network and abroad, including our phones, in just a couple minutes.
10 hours ago
 I feel stubborn for not just accepting this tool before.
10 hours ago
 Make an account, 4 lines of code...boom
8 hours ago
 Cool beans.  I remember Hamachi - that was awesome.
5 hours ago
 Should set one up yourself
5 hours ago
 it gets around the awful ISP NAT problem beautifully
5 hours ago
 Certainly gonna take a look!

 Discord is a CPU whore
2 hours ago
 Never used it.  Just now finished the Matrix with wifey
2 hours ago
 noice
2 hours ago
 the longer you can stay away from the Discord cancer, the better
2 hours ago
 cannot get my mic to work with it either...qTox works like a charm though
2 hours ago
 yeah, I have heard some stories about it
2 hours ago
 hmmmm
2 hours ago
 Anything that lots of 'normal' people use make me a bit suspicious - especially when it comes to privacy.
2 hours ago
 several applications work (I've got audio running by the skin of my teeth on this system...)
2 hours ago
 yeah, it sounded like you were just about to give up with the sound on your system
2 hours ago
 aye, audio output isn't a problem so far (once I figured out the solution; I'm glad I didn't give up)
2 hours ago
 Yeah, it sure seemed like you were close though.
2 hours ago
 oh, no doubt
2 hours ago
 I certainly have come to like Manjaro.
2 hours ago
 I liked Fedora quite a bit - but I like this even more.
2 hours ago
 aye, Arch EZ mode is nice
2 hours ago
 If the software exists - it is nearly certain to exist on the AUR
2 hours ago
 aye, one of its superpowers
2 hours ago
 hehe
2 hours ago
 Manjaro can still be a bitch for some things
2 hours ago
 just so that I am in the loop, what would some of those things be>
2 hours ago
 I have more difficulty getting virtualization to work in Manjaro than anything else I've tried seriously
2 hours ago
 Oh.
2 hours ago
 Manjaro makes it easy to switch kernels, but I've not been in love with how it handles modules
2 hours ago
 even Arch is easier on this front
2 hours ago
 imho
2 hours ago
 but, overall, Manjaro is the least headache of any system
2 hours ago
 no system is perfect, sadly
2 hours ago
 so how did the playdate go?
2 hours ago
 It was very nice.  Lots of common interests with me and him.  He likes 40k, movies, comics, and totally chill.  He has 3 boys, with the newest being 2 months old.  I work with him but he is on leave for the kiddo right now.  All of the kids had a blast and played legos, nerf guns, and other such things.  We all kinda had a nerf gun fight in the house.  Total blast.  Wish we could have spent more time there.  [[Jop]] made food and we took it.  Definatly need to spend more time with these folks.
2 hours ago
 [[Jop]] even got in on the nerf gun action.
2 hours ago
 lol
2 hours ago
 that sounds fun
2 hours ago
 Sarah wore a wolverine mask with a big pink bow.
2 hours ago
 The couple home schools the kiddos.
2 hours ago
 neat
2 hours ago
 Their grandmother teaches them Latin via skype.
2 hours ago
 It's nice to have grandparents that give a shit
2 hours ago
 She obviously stays at home but used to work as CSX.  He, like I said works with me, and thus he got 4 months of paid time off to spend with the kiddo
2 hours ago
 Noice
2 hours ago
 He work in the same dept?
2 hours ago
 Yeah
2 hours ago
 Nice to have a friend at work
2 hours ago
 The is a manager in the middle office.  My desk is close to his.  He is a differnt focus area tho.
2 hours ago
 He helped me get a Job at BoA and also recommended me for this new position that I have now.
2 hours ago
 ah, you know him from outside work?
2 hours ago
 Yes, he is in my Sunday school class.  He doesn't go to the class all that much.  Spends most of the time watching over kiddos as a volunteer.  haven't quite figured that one out as of yet.
2 hours ago
 hey, you never answered my question before about  your mom
2 hours ago
 on the other hand perhaps I do, our Sunday School teacher is quite the bore and deep study is not something that occurs in the class.
2 hours ago
 Whats that question?
2 hours ago
 writing a letter to my AA and UJ
Sat 9:20 PM
 trying to use my wiki to reconnect with people
Sat 9:20 PM
 it has been wondering to connect with [[L]] with it, but I have my doubts I will be able to have the same with AA&UJ
Sat 9:21 PM
 actually, I think it's [[UJ]]*...I think he has the standard spelling
Sat 9:21 PM
 I'm always curious to know what you'd tell your mother with your wiki. I know our situations are different, but they also have similarities.
Sat 9:23 PM
 That is a deep question, and I ain't had my coffee yet.  I spoke to her very briefly yesterday when she called to talk to Sarah on her birthday.  Sarah was quite the trooper.
Sun 6:56 AM
2 hours ago
 Yeah, I had forgotten about that question.
2 hours ago
 Sunday school classes serve many purposes; you still in the same one from when we visited you?
2 hours ago
 Most likley.  We haven't really moved around as there is just one really large class for our age group.  It is more or less of a networking class.  [[Jop]] got recommended to her job from a fellow class member.
2 hours ago
 aye,  you have said that before; makes sense
2 hours ago
 her work going okay? transition decent?
2 hours ago
 I suppose I should ask her, lol
2 hours ago
 There are good and bad days.  It is mostly a matter of getting back in the rut and the newness wearing off.  I know that my stress level at work has come down from the high.  Mostly for the same reason.
2 hours ago
 She is reading to the kids in bed right now FYI
2 hours ago
 not a problem, one reason I like instant messages...asynchronous enough for me to avoid e-mail
2 hours ago
 Back to the mother question.  I do not quite know what I would say to her to be honest.
2 hours ago
 I'm glad to hear work is growing less stressful, I bet in 6 months, it will normalize for the most part
2 hours ago
 said your daughter was a trooper for speaking with her on the phone
2 hours ago
 Yeah, given how little contact that they have had with one another it is akin to speaking with a stranger.  I know that my shyness would cripple me in a situation like that especially at that age.  But, then again, Sarah is more like her mother in that regard than she is like me.  Melissa  on the other hand takes more after me with social skills.
2 hours ago
 I hear that
2 hours ago
 My kids are going to have stellar social skills...homeschooled by autistic parents
2 hours ago
 gotta do what you can with what you've got, hehe
2 hours ago
 well, if you figure out what you'd say to her, let me know
2 hours ago
 I'm still in the process of writing the letter
2 hours ago
 The letter to [[AA]] and [[UJ]]?
2 hours ago
 aye
2 hours ago
 takes it out to me to write letters
2 hours ago
 I'm glad I do though
2 hours ago
 I tend to think that I would have lots of questions to ask my mother.  Why this or why that.  Also, I would ask her about her relationship with my father - though I have heard some of that in the past and I don't think that I could really believe everything that she would tell me.
2 hours ago
 that makes sense
2 hours ago
 I'm not sure what I'd say or ask in your shoes either
2 hours ago
 I would also like an answer as to why she shacked up the soon to be arsonist.  That seems just bat-shit-crazy territory
2 hours ago
 perhaps
2 hours ago
 Drinking with my brother's friends also seemed to disturb me quite a bit
2 hours ago
 I didn't know that about him myself
2 hours ago
 rofl
2 hours ago
 I meant her drinking with them
2 hours ago
 right, I gotcha
2 hours ago
 Seeing her drunk after such an encounter really dumbfounded me
2 hours ago
 TBH I think she has suffered a mental meltdown and I have no real way of knowing if she is over that yet.
2 hours ago
 Or if she could ever really get over it
2 hours ago
 (you use TBH a lot)
2 hours ago
 I do, don't I
2 hours ago
 I wonder why that is?
2 hours ago
 That I don't know
2 hours ago
 That makes two of us.
2 hours ago
 been watching KOTH with the kids
1 hour ago
 ?
1 hour ago
 King of the Hill
1 hour ago
 Oh
1 hour ago
 been an interesting experience seeing myself in the adults of the show
1 hour ago
 useful set of references for explaining Tennessee as well...Southern Gothic is useful

 found an interesting RPing book: Microscope
1 hour ago
 you should check it out
1 hour ago
 I swear, life somehow keeps moving faster and faster
1 hour ago
 True dat
1 hour ago
 so what you think about zerotier?
1 hour ago
 Not quite for sure what it would be used for.  I read the about section.  Still a bit puzzled.
1 hour ago
 It's used for building networks across your devices
1 hour ago
 particularly good at piercing NATs
1 hour ago
 which you and I both seem to face
1 hour ago
 (it's no accident that ipv6 isn't being rolled out)
1 hour ago
 can you give me an idea what you use it for?
1 hour ago
 SSH, SFTP, SCP, LAN-based anything
1 hour ago
 a host of technologies are built on it
1 hour ago
 I've given you examples before on this.
1 hour ago
 I am sorry, this is simply used as a method of accessing all of your devices from any of your devices correct?
1 hour ago
 aye, direct access like we are sitting on a LAN
1 hour ago
 or at least to pierce through a NAT
1 hour ago
 I can't SSH into my own home. I can't NoMachine in either.
1 hour ago
 Not without a reverse proxy or a tool like this.
1 hour ago
 ah
1 hour ago
 When we were growing up, we were handed an IP (usually dynamic, but still an IP) in which we were at least semi-first class citizens on the internet
1 hour ago
 direct TCP/IP connections were completely viable
1 hour ago
 that is under attack right now
1 hour ago
 ISPs aim to prevent average people from having the ability to serve or upload, to have an outward facing set of ports that can be reached
1 hour ago
 it turns us into passive consumers of what is available
1 hour ago
 do you not need to connect your devices to each other?
1 hour ago
 A lack of devices makes that a rather non-issue for me
1 hour ago
 I mean, when I'm out of the house, I still want to use my phone to connect to my desktop
1 hour ago
 I don't have the need to reach my phone as much from my desktop, admittedly
1 hour ago
 although, that does happen
1 hour ago
 I really don't have anything meaningful to access on my desktop from my phohne
1 hour ago
 not a lack of devices then, just no need to connect your devices
1 hour ago
 more than cloudservices, I suppose*
1 hour ago
 this is a cloud service, as far as I'm concerned, but yeah, I see where you are coming form
1 hour ago
 what did you like about Hamachi?
1 hour ago
 control from afar.  It was more or less a parlor trick.  I didn't really use it much
1 hour ago
 oh
1 hour ago
 so how was The Matrix?
1 hour ago
 when was the last time you saw it?
1 hour ago
 (besides tonight, obv ;P)
1 hour ago
 been a long time.  The computer had a hard time playing it.  It studdered a bit
1 hour ago
 ah
1 hour ago
 720p is what I will make sure to get
1 hour ago
 you want anything, btw?
1 hour ago
 I'd love to see the newest avengers movie :P
1 hour ago
 k
1 hour ago
 give me a title
1 hour ago
 avengers infinity war other than that im good when it comes to moives at this point of time
1 hour ago
 I've almost entirely stopped watching movies. Even new shows.
1 hour ago
 I rewatch shows though.
1 hour ago
 We mostly watch Thai tv now
1 hour ago
 why?
1 hour ago
 Nothing really worth watching and it works out well for wife and hubby time
1 hour ago
 We like this singing show where they wear masks and the celibrity panel tries to guess who the singers are
1 hour ago
 Real top notch and it helps me improve my language skills.  The kids like it too
1 hour ago
 The kids don't understand much really.  We just want them to have exposure to the language other that just hearing me or [[Jop]] talking to them
1 hour ago
 think you'll eventually get them to fluency?
1 hour ago
 I'd love to, but i dont think that it will happen
1 hour ago
 would be cool to have a secret language in Amerika
1 hour ago
 We would like to move back to Thailand eventually though.  The kids will need to be grown first though
1 hour ago
 Lol
1 hour ago
 why's that?
1 hour ago
 We both miss the place.  We are currently trying to save to send [[Jop]] and the girls there next year to visit family over the summer.  have them stay a month or so
1 hour ago
 We want the kids to know both sides of the family
1 hour ago
 That is an expensive month!
1 hour ago
 You have that quite correct
1 hour ago
 At that price, I'd be tempted to just move, lol.
1 hour ago
 We have been saying that we want to make this trip for years now.  I really want to come through in the clutch for this
1 hour ago
 Yeah, the problem is that we know the kids would be best served getting an education here.  Other than that we would like to go back
44 minutes ago
 Will they get a college education here before you'd move?
43 minutes ago
 I agree the education thing is rough.
43 minutes ago
 I'm not sure what their lives would be like even as adults over there, especially if they aren't fluent in Thai
43 minutes ago
 I would want them to either do college, trade school, or the like before we make a move
42 minutes ago
 sounds like this is 15 years away or something
42 minutes ago
 still, gotta have a goal
42 minutes ago
 would you move if they chose not to?
41 minutes ago
 It is.  hence the need to do a visit as often as possible so the other family member can see them
42 minutes ago
 That is an unknown
41 minutes ago
 We would need to see how our children come to see things as they get older
41 minutes ago
 You all do video chat with family over there often?
41 minutes ago
 no doubt
41 minutes ago
 Perhaps we will be dissuaded after making a trip or two back - who knows
41 minutes ago
 We do do video chat
41 minutes ago
 Imho, your goal should be to secure a telecommuting job
40 minutes ago
 Indeed
40 minutes ago
 your salary right now in Thailand would be fucking sick, yo
40 minutes ago
 Yup, [[Jop]]'s brother makes near what I make and works for Shell in Thailand.
39 minutes ago
 [[k0sh3k]] applied for a UN librarian position in Thailand
38 minutes ago
 Wow
37 minutes ago
 we homeschool, so it would be fine
35 minutes ago
 I'm pretty much an alien anywhere I live at this point, so meh, whatever
33 minutes ago
 I can kinda see that
33 minutes ago
 I am concerned that a global catastrofuck would be easier to handle here in the States
31 minutes ago
 not sure what life in Thailand would be in such case
31 minutes ago
 Really?  I was thinking the opposite really
31 minutes ago
 Why do you think that?
31 minutes ago
 Well, I see things getting pretty cray cray fast when it comes to tribalism.  As as mixed race couple with kids the same we would be a target here in the South even if I have opinions that align more with the many southrons.  I don't think those opinions are going to be enough to spare us.  But, we run into a similar situation in Thailand.  However, it seems to me that Thailand is more accepting of luuk krung.  But this is all speculation and in any shit hitting the fan scenario the unknown will be plentiful.
28 minutes ago
 ah, so for you in particular
26 minutes ago
 well, she also has family there, so that makes it even easier, imho
26 minutes ago
 I don't have your hopes for Thailand
26 minutes ago
 That was a consideration as well.  Don't want to alienate any support
26 minutes ago
 How do you see the sitaution?
25 minutes ago
 tourism is their #1 export, if shit hit the fan, I expect their military control of their people will only tighten, including foreigners (you are all tainted on that front)
25 minutes ago
 That is true.
25 minutes ago
 In terms of natural resources, raw defense against surrounding nations, infrastructure... The US is very well positioned.
24 minutes ago
 yeah, dem oceans have been useful in the past
24 minutes ago
 I'm radically opposed to nationalism, but strategically, the US appears to be one of the better places to exist (and I say that with profound distrust of almost everyone)
24 minutes ago
 Yeah, that is a good point
23 minutes ago
 I think Thailand is a SEAsian country which is largely dependent upon interactions with China, the EU, and the US.
22 minutes ago
 I really do not know what we are going to do.  I know we want the kids to be able to visit over pretty long stretches during summer breaks as much as possible and we have a nebulous idea that we would like to go back sometime in the future.  Right now, i guess we are more focused on getting the kids grown and educated.  That is the reason we have for being where we are now.  Whether we will really have the desire to move at a later date is really up to what happens leading up to that time.
22 minutes ago
 it seems to have high population density, and I think they would suffer greatly in a global catastrophe
21 minutes ago
 yes
21 minutes ago
 that makes sense
21 minutes ago
 I have no idea what the world will look like 15 years from now either
21 minutes ago
 Imho, the world is only getting worse as the Crisis of Capitalism continues to unfurl
20 minutes ago
 We don't know what we are going to do either. =/
20 minutes ago
 I do have some nostalga of going back to KY and living in the area around where I grew up and having some land.  But that is just a pipe dream for the most part as I do not think that [[Jop]] would like that and I want my other half to be happy.
