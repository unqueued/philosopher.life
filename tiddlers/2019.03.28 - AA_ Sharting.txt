So I’m testing a student today for common assessments. And I ate those beans twice yesterday. During the test I have to let one rip and I hold it as long as I can which causes it to be even worse. I finally let it go, trying to not just release it. But it was like a tidal wave and it went on for like a minute. Finally I’m done the kid looks up and goes “you should probably go to the bathroom” and then goes back to his test like nothing happened.
