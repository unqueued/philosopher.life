The link wouldn't load but aye, that's a lot of writing
Fri 9:03 AM
 that's a lot of thinking!
Fri 9:03 AM
 i feel your pain
Fri 9:03 AM
 thinking sucks
Fri 9:03 AM
 [[k0sh3k]] told me you were waking with headaches from thinking/writing in your sleep
Fri 9:03 AM
 I wish I could offer any kind of useful advice or suggestions
Fri 9:03 AM
 I used to suffer a lot from too  much thinking
Fri 9:03 AM
 for most of my life
Fri 9:03 AM
 the only reason I think it changed ... well, I worked at it consciously for years so I'm sure that did nae harm, but the main thing for me seemed to be that things were different after my total nervous breakdown
Fri 9:04 AM
 but you've got kids so i'd not recommend one of those! lol
Fri 9:04 AM
 (not that we get to choose them, of course, i'm being facetious :P )
Fri 9:04 AM
 For definite, weed helps me not think so much. Which is weird cause it didnae have that effect when I was younger, sometimes the opposite!
Fri 9:05 AM
 and it's not like I don't do plenty of ruminating stoned, still
Fri 9:05 AM
 but somehow it helps me be more focused on BEING
Fri 9:05 AM
 so I think less, spend less time in my haed
Fri 9:05 AM
 My head is a shitty place to be a lot of the time, it's good to escape ;)
Fri 9:05 AM
 I'm guessing you can relate lol
Fri 9:05 AM
 There's a song Ed quite likes (I like it too but I heard the band through him) ...
Fri 9:05 AM
 fuck, i wanted to send you the link, but apparently the video is not available in my country so it won't give me the link...? eh?
Fri 9:07 AM

Fri 9:07 AM

Fri 9:07 AM

Fri 9:07 AM
 business market consultancy bullshit, something about welsh microbreweries... which makes it sound like it SHOULD be more interesting than it is. Bleugh

 You may need to wait for the link to load (let me know the error you are getting). It's a ~20MB html file (even though it's compressed down to ~6MB). You can also download the entire site just by "Save Page As" (it's self-contained in a single file).

 It is a lot of thinking. That is how I spend my life. I can see you feel that pain too. It's one of the reasons we both turn to substances. We're honest about reality, which is super painful.
Fri 12:37 PM
 Yeah, those are my dreams often enough, lol. It's my season/plight in life, I think.
Fri 12:37 PM
 I appreciate the focus on "being there in the moment," setting aside cognition. Heidegger calls it the "present at hand" mode, and it's an emotionally unsettling state which he hoped to escape in many respects. Seems to have quite a bit in common with several Eastern philosophical practices.
Fri 12:39 PM
 Thank you for the song recommendation.
Fri 12:39 PM
 I've always wondered what it is that you transcribe.
Fri 12:41 PM
 What percentage of what you transcribe do you believe deserves to be transcribed?
