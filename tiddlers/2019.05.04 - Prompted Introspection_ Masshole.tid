title: 2019.05.04 - Prompted Introspection: Masshole

!! What state or country what was your father raised in?

Primarily around Southie Boston and Brockton, though some San Diego. I don't consider him fully "raised" until ~25. Thus, Chicago as well. His thick accent has dropped over the years. He is still ever the Masshole. New Englanders and I rarely get along (but, c'mon, I barely get along with anyone, lol).
