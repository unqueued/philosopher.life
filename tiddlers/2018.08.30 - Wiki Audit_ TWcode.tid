[[Sphygmus]] gifted me a very kind problem. I need to find a way to graft other people's code in here while demonstrating they said it (or mixing it more effectively with my own. Sphygmus deserves to have a voice on this wiki, and I need to find a way not to fail them.

I've also decided to start cataloging the people in my life more effectively. [[1uxb0x: Isaac]] is a damned good idea.

I'm having doubts about how I'm engaged in [[Music: Exploration]], but I'm not sure if adding names or anything is really an improvement. Evidence is evidence, and I can always just parse through it if need be.
