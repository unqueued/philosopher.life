!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The Superman is a symbol, the exponent of this anguishing and tragic period of crisis that is traversing European consciousness while searching for new sources of pleasure, beauty, ideal. He testifies to our weakness, but at the same time represents the hope of our redemption. He is dusk and dawn. He is above all a hymn to life, to life lived with all the energies in a continuous tension towards something higher.

It's a shame you don't speak of [[The Moral Law]]. Do you think there is actually something higher? Is The Ideal real? Or, is it simply a symbol which represents a delusional desire in the human condition? Let me guess, you feel like that's what you want, but in darkest honesty, you deny there's something objectively higher than yourself and your own perspective in the world? Everything is just equal, relatively absurd, merely constructed, a matter of personal taste and style. XD. 

I adore the "continuous tension towards" phrase. It's dialectical, philosophically intentional, and captures our [[fff]]itude.

I agree The Superman testifies to the source of our weakness and redemption: [[hope]]. What do you really think you are hoping for? What is worth every price in your life? Surely, you do not lay yourself on the altar of yourself.
