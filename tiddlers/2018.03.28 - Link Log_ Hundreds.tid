*** Same old story.
** https://aeon.co/ideas/the-desire-to-fit-in-is-the-root-of-almost-all-wrongdoing
*** You are so very, very close, my friend! There is a deep selfishness in failing to empathize with yourself, to treat yourself not as mere means. Don't you see? You must identify with your future self. The egoistic description can also convert your "fitting in" (or any variant of any action) as itself a selfish procedure. Who is the self being selfish, and what does it mean to be selfish? When you go down these paths, you will see that you've only pointed out one of the branches, not the roots.

*** Top post says something quite important (although, there are positives to containers still)
*** I've stopped using the containers because of serious performance problems.

*** I didn't even expect them to pay this price.

*** I am clearly never cynical enough.

* Think About It
** http://www.psypost.org/2018/03/many-heterosexuals-view-bisexual-women-promiscuous-confused-study-suggests-50953
*** I think it's superhot. I will admit, however, that dark-triadicism is stronger in bisexual women. I don't think this is conceptually necessary, but primarily (if not entirely) an empirical result of conditioning and societal circumstances+attitudes.
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16687521
*** I am continually disappointed by the neoreactionaries. There are some reasonable claims here though.
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16682949
*** Yes. This is just churn, and yes, FB's optics only look bad right now. I don't think they are going anywhere. Let's be honest about this. It's optics all the way down. Surveillance capitalism will continue.
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16679354
*** I think this too is churn. I'm not convinced people will ever really own up to the true evil of humanity.

* Fishy
** https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/jobs/quit-social-media-your-career-may-depend-on-it.html
*** It's pretty obvious this only fits a select set of people in particular areas. Take yourself out of a high demand area, put yourselves into most people's shoes, and this argument is far weaker.

*** Signaling, posturing, manipulation, etc. Sadly, celebrated.

*** It's an odd split in wealth, and I wish I understood why.
** https://www.inquisitr.com/4843788/new-study-explores-personal-and-group-identity-formation-in-online-communities/
*** I'm not surprised. I'd argue this goes for online communities in general.
