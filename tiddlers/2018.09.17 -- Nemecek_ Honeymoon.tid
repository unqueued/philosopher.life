Nothing different here. Grinding hard, making progress bit by bit. Sleep deprivation is catching up to me. Nothing unexpected on my front though.

Why are you sleep deprived

h0p3
years ago, I bought some RCs, store them carefully...I have a lifetime supply at this point
adamnemecek

it was a time where the doctors couldn't find an answer, so I had to start taking much larger risks. Research Chemicals.
