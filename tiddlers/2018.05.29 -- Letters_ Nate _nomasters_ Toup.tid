Hi Nathan,

I'm h0p3. It's nice to meet you. I've been reading through your lifelog: https://nomasters.io/. It's an interesting take. If this post is "out of the blue" for you and inappropriate, I apologize. I liked your project and reasoning (which seems to be a variant of the Cartesian "Meditations" approach).

Despite our differences, I think we have major similarities in our goals and methods: https://philosopher.life/. I can appreciate the aim for quantitative minimalism, particularly in one's pursuit of axioms and engaging in effective Bayesian training of our blink-of-an-eye, emotional, non-conscious brain processes. Perhaps in contrast, I take myself to be a qualitative/narratival maximalist (which I think helps me reason about the quantitative aspect in crucial yet gutteral ways).

I found you by reference here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17171665. I would like to understand your response to their comments. What do you think?

Anyways, this letter is just a shot in the dark; it's worth my time to reach out and try to start a dialogue with you. I don't meet enough people who think like you do.

Sincerely,

h0p3

Hi h0p3,

Thanks for the email. I'm flattered that you find my perspective interesting. I'd be happy to try to answer some questions, if I can.

I checked out your site. Wow. 
Dense, complex, absurdist, and at times very funny. 
I got a kick out of the disclaimer.

I noticed you are using TiddlyWiki, how are you liking it? I'm using hugo https://gohugo.io/ and after the learning curve its been really nice.
