"""
[5:33 PM]  h0p3: How's your weekend going?

[10:12 AM]  robotic_scarab: hey h0p3 :)
[10:13 AM]  robotic_scarab: needless to say, it was a weekend full of procrastination, including but not limited to, putting off replying to this message. XP
[10:13 AM]  robotic_scarab: I caught up in your wiki today, though, which is a good step! sounds like you had a great anniversary (sushi :heart_eyes: )
[10:16 AM]  robotic_scarab: it's interesting watching how your homeschooling shifts and changes, and I wonder what sort of things you and my mom would talk about together
[10:24 AM]  robotic_scarab: I'm sure she remembers the frustrations of trying to get me & my brother to do our work much more vividly then I do, lol
[11:30 AM]  h0p3: I feel that procastination. There's 10,000 things to do, lol. I hope it was still a pleasant and rewarding weekend for you.
[11:31 AM]  h0p3: I think my [[Recent Obsessions]] is my procastination trapper keeper, lol.
[11:32 AM]  h0p3: Sushi was amazing. I'm going to bet it tasted better because it's such a rare texture and flavor for me. It's rare that I get to eat raw fish. I'm in there thinking: wait, why do I want rice? Just let me eat raw fish. Anyway, it was a great day. Gonna be hard to top it for future anniversaries, I assume.
[11:34 AM]  h0p3: I think my homeschooling is like throwing things at the wall, seeing what sticks. I never understand my offspring well enough.
[11:38 AM]  h0p3: I bet your mom and I would have plenty to talk about. I assume she'd find me pretty crazy (rightfully so). It is interesting speaking with parents who take their offspring's educations seriously (and not merely for the sake of getting a job).
[11:39 AM]  h0p3: I'm curious to know if your brother has your abilities. I know everyone is different.
[11:45 AM]  h0p3: Also, I hope you have fun at the concert and a good meal with your mom. Sounds like you have an excellent weekend coming up.

[8:38 PM]  robotic_scarab: You would have so much to talk about! She might find you a little crazy but probably not too much (my dad has echoes of the same paranoia)
[8:40 PM]  robotic_scarab: I admire her dedication to putting the time and effort into teaching my brother and I (it wasn't easy and she sacrificed a lot for it)
[8:41 PM]  robotic_scarab: My brother has similar abilities -- our grandfather gave us a World Book Encyclopedia at one point and my bro bookmarked so many entries and made himself a personal index to it. :)
[8:41 PM]  robotic_scarab: He took to the social world of public school and beyond like a duck to water (compared to me)
[8:42 PM]  robotic_scarab: I had a wonderful wonderful meal with my mom! And had a great day of letterboxing beforehand. Though I only found 3 total and checked over 10 -- some people just don't know how to hide them so they last. :C
[8:43 PM]  robotic_scarab: And I lost my wallet at the restaurant but thankfully someone turned it in to them so I picked it up as soon as I went back in. ''phew''
[8:43 PM]  h0p3: Noice. I am glad you found that wallet. Would have me freaking out.
[8:46 PM]  h0p3: Letterboxing reminds me of messages in a bottle, the signs which poor travelers leave for other poor travelers, and I imagine it is very difficult to make these survive the elements.
[8:47 PM]  h0p3: I would actually take pictures of that event, I think, even though I don't normally take pictures.
[8:47 PM]  h0p3: I'm glad you had a good meal with your mom too. That is a gift.
[8:52 PM]  h0p3: I would be honored to speak with her, if she ever wanted to (and, that's up to you too, imho). I would be lucky to understand her perspective. However, I would not want to be someone who is problematic for her. I regret that I would be an echo of something which might be unacceptably painful.
[8:53 PM]  h0p3: I admire her dedication too. Lol. If my children could do half of what you and your brother can, I would be proud of myself.
[8:54 PM]  h0p3: Personal Index to the encyclopedia is so leet. Lol.
[8:54 PM]  h0p3: I'm jelly.
[8:55 PM]  h0p3: I am still considering public school for my offspring. I am receiving mixed signals from people around us about the schools.
[8:57 PM]  h0p3: You are in a unique position in my life to advise me. I would be grateful to know what you think is best for my offspring.
[9:00 PM]  robotic_scarab: So this is just off the cuff, and I've had a few drinks and I owe you a response more considered ;)
[9:00 PM]  h0p3: Of course. Take your time.
[9:01 PM]  robotic_scarab: My brother went into public school for 7th grade, which was the start of middle school in our town (I know it is 6th grade in some places)
[9:02 PM]  robotic_scarab: Basically my mom couldn't get him to do any of his work (we had a schedule and curriculum, of course) and I remember she was getting super super frustrated with him
[9:03 PM]  robotic_scarab: I went in at the same time - for my junior year - and I believe I was the one who asked to go (which triggered also sending my brother)
[9:03 PM]  h0p3: (my brothers were pulled out of school because I was kicked out)
[9:04 PM]  robotic_scarab: Whether it was temperament or not, my brother did much better with external teachers - actually did his homework and got good grades and so forth (in class sizes of 50/60, we were in the gifted section, and he made friends there)
[9:05 PM]  robotic_scarab: I don't know if it would have been better for me to go in earlier or not
[9:05 PM]  robotic_scarab: I'm grateful that I did go for even two years before college
[9:06 PM]  robotic_scarab: I don't think it helped my academics, but perhaps the official high school diploma made getting into universities easier (I don't know)
[9:07 PM]  h0p3: Neat trick in CT is that the GED gives you a diploma from the state.
[9:07 PM]  robotic_scarab: Interesting! That seems reasonable.
[9:08 PM]  robotic_scarab: Everything I've heard of middle school from my friends makes me glad I didn't go through that, but my brother didn't seem scarred by it so maybe in the tiny rural junior high it was okay
[9:09 PM]  robotic_scarab: I felt like in a sense I got a free pass in high school to break the rules because I was one of the "star students" if you will
[9:09 PM]  h0p3: ha :slight_smile:
[9:09 PM]  h0p3: Yeah. I bet you walked on water there.
[9:09 PM]  robotic_scarab: Broader access to the library, got an exception to go to my locker at the beginning of the day when nobody else was supposed to do that
[9:10 PM]  robotic_scarab: Also got to volunteer at the circ desk in the school library for like an hour a day which was great
[9:10 PM]  robotic_scarab: There is (probably?) much more competition to consider when going to a CT school
[9:10 PM]  robotic_scarab: Less of a big fish in a small pond effect, perhaps
[9:12 PM]  robotic_scarab: But I get the sense that [[j3d1h]] has a strong sense of herself and would probably be feisty and butt heads with teachers, call out stupid rules, and generally not conform in ways that... are disincentivized by the system
[9:12 PM]  h0p3: ha, yeah
[9:12 PM]  robotic_scarab: That could be a good thing or a bad thing, I don't know XP
[9:12 PM]  robotic_scarab: Obviously to what degree and what definition and so forth ;)
[9:12 PM]  h0p3: :stuck_out_tongue: preach
[9:13 PM]  robotic_scarab: So, I don't have any particular thesis there. So much is dependent on the context.
[9:15 PM]  robotic_scarab: The longer you wait, the more independent they'll be before going into the system and so be less molded by it (to some degree).
[9:15 PM]  h0p3: There's a lot to think about here. I think they have such an amazing opportunity to learn at home (or sneaking into classes at Yale or wherever). But, socialization and motivation are problems I can't fully solve myself.
[9:16 PM]  h0p3: At this point, I think they are both functional aliens to all of the people their ages I've met so far (and that I recall in my youth).
[9:16 PM]  robotic_scarab: Motivation is huge; for whatever reason I didn't need that externalization as much as my brother did. But it worked for him!
[9:17 PM]  robotic_scarab: I definitely felt like an alien, only partly functional ;P
[9:17 PM]  h0p3: ha, yeah, I'm there too.
[9:17 PM]  h0p3: I think it's a stronger problem for my son.
[9:19 PM]  h0p3: My daughter can blend, codeswitch, reverse engineer it (if she decides it's worth her time). I'm more convinced that homeschooling is necessary for him than my daughter. He's come a long way, but we have a long way to go still.
[9:20 PM]  robotic_scarab: I feel that worry too; my gut reaction is that public school would be cruel to his difference.
[9:20 PM]  h0p3: yeah :frowning:
[9:21 PM]  h0p3: It will be a decision we need to make before the Fall. Thank you for thinking about it so carefully with me.
[9:21 PM]  robotic_scarab: I will be listening as you talk about it in your wiki, too.
[9:22 PM]  robotic_scarab: If I think of anything else, I'll let you know.
