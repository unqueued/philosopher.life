title: 2017.02.02 - Realpolitik Speculation: Conservative DNC

Through a series of false compromises, the DNC has inched more and more to the right over the decades. Pelosi herself praises Capitalist dogma. The Clinton's are a wonderful box of contradictions. Obama was an incredible disappointment; he's a war-criminal. The core of the DNC has already been hollowed out by corporate interests. 

Bernie was an indication of a more leftist possibility for the party (and I consider Bernie lacking zeal and direction, but at least he's remotely on the left path), and he was denied by influential and powerful people at every turn (despite having the obvious popular majority). The DNC has clearly not learned their lesson, those fools and selfish assholes. I think they see the Trump presidency as a conflict to thrive upon and a way to only further entrench their version of conservativism through yet another false compromise. 

Give me a parliament and game theoretically correct voting procedures. Even the will of our retarded people is better. It is sad to see that no one represents us. Expectation (ought) and prediction (is), of course, are different.
