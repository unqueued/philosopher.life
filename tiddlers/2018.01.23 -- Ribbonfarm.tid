//principal-agent problems// are asymmetric situations where the party you are paying for a service is also the knowledgeable party who can determine what services are actually necessary, and how much to charge.

Trade in small denominations of trust. Duh.

First day in prison: you have to set up and win an underdog fight, where you’re not too much of an underdog, but you can't provoke/start the fight.

Work to Rule examples:

* "Not in my job description.”
* “I am just following the rules.”
* “Our policy is...”
* “We are not allowed to work on weekends.”
* “I am not authorized to do that.”
* “I don’t know what the policy is on that, I’ll have to ask my manager.”

Due diligence is a powerful weapon to slow things down. As a boss, you want to develop the opposite, a "sphere of improvisation" in which you give others the benefits of going beyond the rules, while taking on the risks.

Rao goes on to tell us to employ blatant archetyping (which somehow isn't stereotyping?), typecasting people, using induction to make leaps of logic. Learn to control your induction, but use it. He's whitewashing what this is.

Rao argues not to train your ability to detect lies or lie, but rather to learn how to effectively confront a liar.

Cursing and Candor ("let me be honest with you") are "pseudo-truth-telling behaviors [which] arise from internal narratives that are grounded in unprocessed denial, rationalization and the like. You are being invited to participate in a fiction they’ve unconsciously constructed to protect themselves."

Be a cold-blooded, low-reactor, contempuous listener to insults and ad hominems. Be confident in your identity and self-assessment to the point that you feel no need to defend yourself or acknowledge the unnecessary layers of what you are listening to. This is beyond having thick skin; it is contempt for the other. Be clinically objective in your listening. //Don't feel the need to convince the other!//

You can be effective or you can be liked.

The Hierarchy of Delusion Organization

* Getting out of the way: arranging matters so things and people you care about are moved out of the way of an impending train wreck.
* Creating a sandbox: At a more advanced level of practice, you catalyze, encourage and sustain delusions that benefit you. The sandbox allows delusions-memes to survive and incubate when they normally wouldn't. Organization gets a little harder: you have to create a safe sandbox so the delusion can survive a little longer than it would if reality were allowed to hit it too early. "reality distortion field"
* Pouring fuel on the spark: fuel and amplify stabilized delusions on a more massive scale; manage perceptions/optics.
* Manufacturing Delusions: last-resort approach, rarely worth the cost.

The larger the scale, the simpler the delusion must be. 

I must admit that I regularly hold people in contempt, but I am so worried about violating their human dignity, whatever shred there might possibly be, that I avoid treating them as mere means. I have not reconciled the fact that the vast majority of homo sapiens I've met are terrible people, human specimens who don't deserve to live, with the fact that I want them to be happy. I can eventually see the selfishness in almost everything, and it's a strong redpill. If I am to be effective, I need to dive in fully into that world. I must refactor my perceptions.
