I'M AFRAID OF "MAKING MISTAKES" OR SAYING ANYTHING THAT WOULD HURT YOU OR BE MISUNDERSTOOD.
<<<

"[[TOO LATE!|cruise control]]"

I don't believe you. If you actually feel like you can't do anything right, it's because you've habitually done it that wrong. Of course, I think you say those words with forethought. That much I believe. When you say that you just don't feel like you can say the right thing, what's really happening is you can't find [[words which enable you to not take responsibility|The HolY ShrinE Of AyN rANd]], and so you wish to conveniently act like it's my fault or nothing can be done about it. We have different accounts of the concept of "mistake" here; go ahead, high priest: what do you mean by evil or the knowledge of it?

You have an empathy problem, sociopath. Don't act like you've [[taken the time|Wiki Review]] to understand your children (this wiki, again, is living proof), and don't you dare act like they haven't taken the time to understand you. I know you better than anyone except your husband, woman. We do have a misunderstanding here, and that's primarily your mistake. 

Being afraid of actually making mistakes in this regard is not how you have behaved with me. You have already spent several lifetimes of my epistemic charity in your brainwashing, creator; you have wasted the lives of your children. To some non-trivial [[dok]], I think you are just saying those words, and I don't think you actually mean them all the way down.<<ref "ty">> 

You've salted the Earth, and you trigger landmines you planted. Don't you dare act like it's our fault we have strong reactions to your words, tokens, and decades of cultic [[brainwashing|Memetic Warfare]] and violence. You have no intention of giving any credence to what you trigger, and the goal of your letter is to quietly deny the validity of our experience without transparent and verifiable reason. You owe your sons nothing less than a public apology and matching behavior, and that still doesn't make up for your evil. Take a hint: you have two-and-a-half out of three [[sons|2017.07.07 - Prompted Introspection Log]] who want you to leave them alone.<<ref "hl">> If you are going to respect even our minimal preferences: apologize and leave, or just leave us alone.  

Let's be clear, you are not entitled to my silence or to enforce the filter of what you conveniently define as civility. Kindness does not mean niceness either. Conversely, in [[T42T]], you owe a massive listening debt to your sons; you could spend the rest of your lives and still never repay it. You clearly have no interest in listening though; you make that abundantly clear. You don't actually give a shit. You've had more than your fair share of fair chances. Now you must face unfair chances.

Reconciliation sufficient to stand in the same room with each other, of course, is hardly [[restoration|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi]]. I'm not here to half-ass this, and I'm not going to disingenuously participate in mere polite and confabulatory narratives with you. I aint no [[gentleman|The Gentleman]]. Are you ready to transparently put your identity online on the line as I have? Are you really going to put your skin in the game? Let me remind you, this is a public conversation. I'm not going to hold back with you though. This is civility with my enemies; do you hear me, [[psychopath|The 48 Laws of Power]]? I wager you don't have the integrity to take off your mask and fight with honor. What? Are you afraid I'm going to rip you apart limb from limb and shred you memeplex from memeplex? [[Pussy|2019.02.24 - TLDR: A Car Ride]].

<<<
THIS CARD, THE BOX, & THE CONTENTS HAVE "NO LAYERS." THERE IS NOT ANY MANIPULATION OR CONTROL INTENDED. NO GUILT. NO DISAPPOINTMENT. NO ANGER.
<<<

Mmmhmm. Lol. That's what I hear from you though. It oozes out of you, and it's going to take a lot of work to overcome the inertia generated through habitually interacting with your children in the way you claim you do not. I'm not interested in starting some NPD/BPD cycle with you. With decades of intimate experience, this is what your children see in you. Are you going to do something about it? I assume not.

Part of me very much wants to believe your words. I wish it were so easy. It would be [[beautiful]] but not [[right]] for me to just hand you [[trust|Trusting Trust]] that far down without evidence. Your words to me will always have many layers to them, and there's nothing you can do about it (even if you somehow actually wanted to speak plainly [and no, you don't]). 

I'm not going to buy your thesis at face value: the burden of proof is on you. I already have all the evidence necessary to justify the claim you are unjustifiably manipulative. Your first move should be an apology and a display of regret for having been manipulative in the first place. Seriously, it's a character flaw in your identity, a vicious disposition generated through decades of practice manipulating those around you. I'm willing to give you [[enormous space|/b/]] here because both of your donors are clinical psychopaths (you know, just like mine), but I demand the truth. You are still lying to all of us, including yourself, in denying it. You're a sophist who primarily persuades through emotional influence and misdirection rather than primarily reason. You're a saleswoman and a stage magician who has literally convinced herself and others that she can exorcize actual demons out of people. This is literally how you've made your living. I did not twist your words; you delivered them twisted.

Note, of course, I don't have a conceptual problem with [[layers|hyperconversation]]. Layers don't have to be unjustifiably deceptive at all! We require [[multi-threading|Rust]] and [[multi-plexing|Outopos]] to maximize our bandwidth throughput and the dimensionality of our communications. You are especially talented at this, particularly in person (indeed, Sister [[SLT]], preacher woman, you have plenty of rhetorical training and decades of experience in exploiting human psychology). Your guttural talents are necessary for your success as ~~preachers~~ con-artists. 

Even if your communications didn't have layers (which is absurd), your allegedly plain words are not the first step to restorative justice. If you meant your words, saying them wouldn't be your first action. You have sat and watched your children dying, and you blame them for it (don't you dare fucking deny it). Are you ready for the same? When you [[die|2017.05.24 - Prompted Introspection Log]], I'm literally going to [[throw a party|Boogerpicking]] in honor of whatever took your life.

You don't get to say "No Guilt. No Disappointment. No Anger." First of all, those sentences are manipulative because they are meant to be read as purely emotional appeals. They aren't arguments at all; they look like cultic-gaslighting and precursors to doubletalk. You have to provide evidence for the conclusions you want us to draw; you don't get to just state them and expect us to swallow. Second, if you actually meant them, you would renounce your previous claims and identity (and, I know you haven't changed your mind, bucko); you would seek forgiveness and aim to restore the damage you've caused. Third, I think you don't want to face these feelings from your own children, and so you act like you haven't been that way (and still aren't). No, you don't get to take the weapons you used on your own children off the table when they come back to judge you. As you have done to your sons, I'm going to burn you alive.

Crucial sections of you are full of shit. I've seen it in your faces, experienced it in your actions, and heard it in your words. I know you still think your sons deserve their lives non-trivially, especially the parts and [[dok]] you are responsible for. It drips out of every expression in your interactions. You aren't going to be able to hide it; it's part of who you are. Barring some miracle, you really do think your sons are going to hell. Congratz on that, btw; they are already there. You did a great job.

I'm not going to simply offer you a [[reset|2018.07.14 - L&K: Let's Reset!]] here. I have already tried too many times with you. If you want to [[reconstruct|Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]], you'll need to work 10% as hard as I have (I'm fairly confident you have no intention of doing so; it is only a [[hope]] that I am wrong). C'mon, let's see a [[Golden Rule]] tithe to your God in serving an enemy's request here. [[Point|Alias]] to your symbols and {[[Axioms]]}, [[tell|hlexicon]] me what [[they mean|Antipleonasmic Catholicon]], priest. Oh, wise ones, {[[help]]} us understand your [[Straussian]] holiness and why we should trust you or your alleged [[faith]]. Openly commit yourselves with integrity in our dialectic.

<<<
WE SIMPLY, PURELY, IN THE MOST HEART-FELT WAY POSSIBLE WANT TO EXPRESS TO YOU, WE LOVE YOU.
<<<

ROFL. Protip: you do not speak for your husband, woman. Only that piece of dogshit can speak for himself.<<ref "w">> I've seen both of you [[communicate|2018.01.11 - h0p3's Log: Donor Divide]] fairly extensively (more than any other human alive). You wrote the letter. [[MWF]] did not, and I know he didn't (it's possible he didn't even read it). You are different people. If you are going to do this right, you can't act like you speak for him. I expect honesty from you (though I don't predict it), and that means separating yourselves in this dialectic. You are each individually accountable (which isn't to say there is no emergent [[responsibility|2017.05.25 - h0p3's Log]]).

I know you don't love your [[children|2017.07.06 - h0p3's Log]]. You aren't going to convince me by simply claiming otherwise. This is my definition of [[Love]]. [[Are you ready to wrestle|Wiki Litmus Test]]? Seriously. Show me. Show us all. I'd be shocked if you did.

<<<
EACH ITEM IS "INTENTIONAL" THAT WE SEND TO YOU. SOUP, BECAUSE YOU USED TO ENJOY IT A LOT. CIRCUS PEANUTS, BECAUSE. YEARS AGO, YOU ATE THEM. (PRO'LY TOO SWEET NOW?!)
<<<

Oh, it's not just intentional, it's //intensional//. Keep your nostalgia to yourself. It is a false narrative. [[YSB]], your aging brain conveniently strips away negative memories; it's increasingly less useful to you to reason about how others feel now unless it makes you happy. The negative feelings you cause don't even phenomenologically register with the same intensity anymore; you increasingly lack empathy without even fully realizing. 

You want to know what the unforgivable sin is really about? It's about having [[crystallized|2018.04.27 - Prompted Introspection Log: Elderly Hands]], programmed, and habitually conditioned your limbic system to the point where your predictive coding becomes [[phenomenologically]] tunnel-visioned, closed, and incapable of changing the core of who you are. Your plasticity was used to eliminate the flexibility necessary for you to repent. To remove the invalidity in you now would take your life; you'd have to be reborn into a vegetable. It's what you deserve.

You will not whitewash or launder the past. Even if much can be forgiven, it is not yours to blot out. You raised suicidal children, completely failed to prepare them for the world, and then you blame them for it! You've not even begun to try to makeup for you mistakes here. Even the appearance of your kindness only serves your ego.

I WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS BOOK-TITLE BAG, THOUGH, BECAUSE OF MEMORIES LAUGHING OVER WHO WOULD END UP WITH 1 COPY WHEN YOU LEFT HOME. (I THINK IT WENT WITH YOU!) 
<<<

I don't think you care about my preferences, which is fine if you are going to back it up with argumentation (and you won't). Decorating my home is among the least of my concerns, and you know that too. We're past the surface, and I'm not heading back up to it with you. Like [[a real mother|R]], you're gonna have to sacrifice now. You either baptize yourself and swim in the deep with the shark,<<ref "sd">> or we have nothing to talk about. You either cognitively wrestle, or you don't mean it. I respect your Reason, what little there is left of it in you.

If you want to reconstruct with me: you are going to have to cognitively grind with me. It's the only thing I can trust out of you, and that's only because I can verify it. You have no moral right to [[touch|Hugs]] my feelings; you lost it many times over. The only gift from you that matters is actually engaging what I have to say with as much charity, precision, and care that I've given yours for decades. There is no clean slate for you. You have to at least genuinely attempt to fix your mess. Make no mistake: you can't fix it, but you have to prove that you are trying.

<<<
I LOVED SHARING THE BOOK WITH YOU, AND THOUGHT IT TOUCHED YOU TOO, MY FAVORITE REASONS/PARTS WERE: 1) THE ERA & CHALLENGES; 2) THAT, FROM A CHILD'S VIEWPOINT VERY ADULT CHALLENGES WERE INTERPRETED, & 3) THE RESILIENCE OF THE MAIN CHARACTER & HER FAMILY MEMBERS, DESPITE HARDSHIPS, SADNESS, & FINANCIALLY OVERWHELMING CIRCUMSTANCES. RESILIENCE & FINDING HOPE -- EVEN WHEN ALL SEEMED DARK. 
<<<

I'm sorry, you are speaking in layers again. Go on, do tell. Walk me through these points, explicitly map them to our reality maps in detail.

I too can vacuously point to a book and try to let it do the talking for me. Let me tell you a book we haven't quite shared together yet: //The Poisonwood Bible//.<<ref "ir">> God damn, that was a good book. What do you think? Roughly, I like it for similar reasons as you've outlined. You know, I can empathize with all the characters in the story, but some merit very little empathy upon reflection. What do you say, high priest?

I see [[light|Sphygmus]] in the world, but it's not in you. [[ridtyawtr]]. I'm not convinced you are a force for [[good]] in the world, woman, so you can keep your platitudes about resilience, [[hope]], and escaping darkness away from me. You have no fucking clue what I see; you've not even tried to step into my shoes.

I am your child, creator. I am [[still paying|2018.01.21 - /b/]] for the sins of generations of my creators. Keep your poisoned sentiment and corrupted origins. Your actions don't match. You desperately want to believe you have loved me more than I have you; stop lying to yourself and to me.

I sent you this wiki about 2.5 years ago, quickly approaching almost 10% of my lifetime ago. I have paid my tithe. You are so very welcome that I made it. Now that I see you have no interest in rationally cooperating, I hope it haunts you. We're past the point of grace here: the [[wiki|2017.10.19 - /b/]] is already that gift to you. There is nothing else like it in [[The Great Human Conversation]], and I have sacrificed my [[privacy|EFF: Cover Letter]] so profoundly that most consider it insane (and you know how highly I regard privacy). If there is incommensurability in our paradigms, the fault does not lay with me; I have given you a gift no son has ever written before. You clearly have no intention of thoughtfully wrestling with the fruit of my labor, so you doubly have no right to expect me listen, creator.

I don't give a shit about your gifts. Your [[trinkets|Psychedelic Videos]] aren't going to fix the brokenness you have caused in me. Your general silence and inaction condemn you. Set aside shallow symbolic gestures. The only gifts which count now are arguments and actions; keep your emotional manipulation to yourself. If you mean it, then let's actually read and write all the way down about it. Are you ready for an open dialectic? Indeed, you owe it to me. [[Any parent|2019.04.07 - JRE: New Phone]] who would brainwash their children down to this level has, at the very least, a duty to listen carefully all the way back down to that level in fundamental disagreement. You clearly have no intention of living up to what you forced on your children.

Your rhetoric is timeless, [[well|2018.04.22 - Carpe Diem Log: Donors]]-[[designed|2018.04.22 - h0p3's Log: Unannounced Visit]], cliche [[music]] to our ears, and I'm sure part of you wishes you believed it. Go ahead and //demonstrate// how your love is deep and wide, farther than I predict, eternal, constant, and real: roflmao. You are going to have read and write like the wind to us woman. Go ahead: stick your neck out. Engage in the dialectic with me. The gauntlet I've thrown down is larger than you can imagine. I dare you to love that much. Our honor and [[integrity|2018.01.08 - /b/]] in the claim that we really [[love]] the [[other]] is at stake. I'm flooding you with it in this wiki; take care not to [[drown|2018.03.28 - Prompted Introspection Log: Granddonor Question]]. Do you really want the chance to be in our lives? This is it. Put up or shut up. 

Where we "are" includes our current beliefs and desires, and it is possible (in fact, from the evidence, it is probable) that "where you are" precludes actually loving your children by definition. It is not, therefore, "regardless of" these properties, it can only be in virtue of them. [[Wax poetic|2017.11.08 - Prompted Introspection Log: Let's All Go 'Round to Mary Ann's]] all you want. You don't have the substance, the fruit, and the reality of love here. I'm not taking the bait, but I will eviscerate your conveniently shitty argument.

I hope you receive my message too. [[Bitch|2017.11.13 - /b/]], you are non-trivially responsible for the darkness I experience day-in and day-out.

Perhaps you can find a spot to go fuck yourself.

funny that I started cutting from the bottom! =) ->

I'm sure you will be as light-hearted in appearance as you want. Those who actually know you know better. I've seen behind your mask.

I think you should do us both the favor of not contacting me again until you've [[sufficiently read|2018.10.14 - ALM: The Discussion]] this wiki.<<ref "tl">> That is the only example of provable cooperation from you I'm accepting. No, you don't have to agree, but you better come correct with argumentation.<<ref "jr">> Humbly and wisely pick which digits and limbs to put in the guillotine because if you're wrong, [[you'll lose 'em|2018.07.17 - L: And...We're Back!]]. 

I'm not convinced there's a way to restore our relationship back to a non-trivial measure of [[depth|2019.01.10 - T-Money: More Letters =)]] without entering into zones where you are going to "[[make mistakes|2018.07.13 - Prompted Introspection: Wrong Judgment]]" which are going to hurt me more than you know and demonstrate at least some sort of [[misunderstanding|Virtue is Knowledge]] (and perhaps vv.). It's a risk we both run. If you want me to believe you, you are going to need to work to understand me. There's no way around it. Empathy for and with an autist is not easy. Of course, I've yet to meet a soul who doesn't eventually claim it is difficult to understand me at times, and I'm sorry: we made me like that, didn't we? 

The [[good]] news for you is that I have worked harder than you can imagine on this wiki,<<ref "ie">> and I aim to build a [[bridge|2018.06.03 - Prompted Introspection Log: Lost Loved One Question]] into my mind for you. [[Are you listening|2018.01.25 - h0p3's Log: Serving it Cold]], creators? If you think it is narcissistic for me to morally expect you to understand what I'm doing here, how I systematically think and feel, then the mutually [[constructed|Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]] project of our relationship, one which defines us both so profoundly in our dialectic, will sit at an impasse which entropically sours and atrophies. 

Here are some simple moves:

* Accept [[Crocker's Rule|The Rules]] in your dialectics with me; it's your obligation in this case.
* If you aren't willing to be wrong all the way down, you have no business [[speaking with me|2019.02.14 - L: Goto Jesus, Don't Collect $200.]]. Don't be a hypocrite with your offspring.
* Read the wiki, respond to it.<<ref "ic">>
* Interact with your family in writing on a daily basis. Prove you don't give a shit just a handful of times a year. 
* Support us in how we choose to raise our children, especially in terms of how it departs from how you did it and the values you hold which differ. I don't mean remain silent: I mean you need to understand it. If you don't agree, you better come with the best argument of your life because I'm going to eviscerate you with it.
* Provide an honest, open, public re-evaluation of your epistemology. You are allowed to change your mind (sometimes that is morally obligated of us), but you better give a profound post-mortem account of what went wrong (and what you owe for your mistakes).

You have no idea how much I have [[honored|2019.03.19 - Prompted Introspection: Vocational Guidance]] what I respect about what is valid about you. You are maliciously ignorant though. It's going to be difficult for us to weave something together when I despise the fabric (though not all the fiber) of your being.

Never forget that I am a dialectical extension of your identity, creator. I will continue to [[reciprocate|2019.04.07 - Prompted Introspection: Male Grand-donor]] in writing.
