!! About:

//Part of my soul is trapped on plebbit. Follow the memes.//

Reddit is a fundamental part of my [[Link Log: The Stack]]. It's probably the most important site I use on a daily basis. It's one of the central components of my internet dependency. I could literally live on Reddit if I had the time.

Subs come and go for me. Periodically, I take a multi-reddit snapshot. Currently, I see some categories emerging for me:

* Antipleonasmic Catholicon
* Technology, FOSS, & Decentrality
* Sociopolitical Science, Ideology, & News
* Curated Deep Narratives, Perception Refactoring, & Well-Roundedness

I test my subreddits in the most naive way at the moment. I go through each sub and scroll through the posts (the majority of which I never click on), and pay attention to which I've seen, which I've clicked on, and guestimate a gut feeling about the relevance of what I've seen and not seen. One interesting thing I've noted is how some of these subs are most useful just for the title themselves (maybe they should just have their own separate multi-reddit?). My [[Link Log]] helps me recognize some of salience here too. I fear my greatest difficulty is pruning; I wish I could just read them all. I need to narrow it down as hard as I can.

I'm especially interested in eliminate subs when:

* the sub has lots of clicked links/threads and now I regret having spent my time looking through these. There has to be the right kind of ratio of being happy enough to have not just browsed but clicked and consumed. These waste my precious deep-reading time.
* there are no clicks in the sub for hundreds of threads (for highly active subs; the less active), watering down my overall multi-reddit signal-to-noise ratio of the Front Page.

Seeking universality through the commons, average, etc. One must look at the bottom-up foundations of towers in order to judge which may be most salient from the top-down.

!! Dreams:

* Perhaps Karma could be worth something, but avoiding the sybil attack is almost impossible. Social capital must be spent wisely with those we trust. They can agree you earned that karma, and you can spend it. i.e. This will show up at the top of your feed, etc. When we own the means of production, while the network is loosely organized, this kind of trust-spending securely works.
