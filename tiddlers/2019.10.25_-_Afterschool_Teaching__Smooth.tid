title: 2019.10.25 - Afterschool Teaching: Smooth

Prep continues to be instant. Carson may have listened to my critique yesterday of the hypocrisy of our sanitation procedures, as she is now washing even the apples by hand. Fascinating. They both have a project for class which they've been procrastinating on. I have wished them luck. They discussed 5TB's behavior, and they are increasingly recognizing what I have said about the boy. I have made it clear they can send whoever they need to send to me to handle. Give me the monsters. They've been taking me up on it: good!

One-on-ones were smooth enough. Some of my kids are concerned that I do not care about my appearance as much as they do. 6AJ is hilarious, explaining to my other children that Jesus wouldn't care; she told me not to take it and to preach, lol. Peas in a pod. 

I've noticed that kids come out of their seats to come speak with me when when I show up early. They know I'm going to speak with them. I'm grateful they give a shit about being heard and developing a relationship.

8HM and 10AM are trying to convince their father to let them hit the pumpkin patch instead of working on the construction of their house. Those girls are [[gems]]. Their ribbing is growing harsher. 

I continue to affirm the necessity of reading with many of my students. 5Em has some books again (good, I've been on him about his lack). I've asked him to start keeping lists and to write about his books, especially because he doesn't want to do it.

Carson and Whitney are working on a yoga certification. I am grateful that I am not required to do it (even though I enjoy yoga, that's not why I'm here [though I think a [[Fitness Routine]] more effective than yoga should be taught]).

Whitney is running off to play office fool again, and I took her children as well. I spoke with Sir Jones, the new teacher. We talked mathematics, CS, and education. His family is filled with teachers (nursing and teaching are the only reliable jobs in our area). We covered a tremendous amount of ground very quickly in my mapping of him. He was humble, reflective, and he aimed to be kind. I'm grateful to meet someone who seeks to be thoughtful. Of course, it's not fun to wrestle with an asshole who thinks he knows more than you, and he handled it gracefully. We actually got to talk about philosophy too. I have [[hope]] in this man.

I was switched up to take a different section of students. Lots of students came with me to play magic and chillax. I am surprised by the number of monsters who decided to pick me today as well (at least for while). 6KA and I have been rumbling. 6NP was clean enough, and 6NP2 shocked me with his respectful and even patient attitude in dealing with me (that is a different child than 6 months ago).

8TB got in trouble for having cleavage today. Of course, she is evil for having gone through puberty and wearing a regular shirt. This kid is poor AF: these are the clothes she has. I told her to ignore the shaming as best she could. She has a wonderful "fuck you" attitude which will require appropriate channeling.

I'm glad to see 8D playing magic today. I helped her construct her deck, but she had to leave early. I kicked 7L's butt instead. He's the best player here by far.

[[gh057]] has had a shit day. He's been getting up extra early to train newcomers, and the owners are yelling at him like it's his fault they won't hire more people or build out saner schedules (and give moral pay). Gaslighting him. He was fed up, and I don't blame him. 

Delp had a meeting at the end. Talked about inspector as predicted, phone policy (lol, like I'm going to enforce that bullshit), and an odd concern that someone left the children unattended from a teacher complaint. Gonna bet that was Mrs. Stout from the 22nd. I went to the bathroom while there were two adults in the room and my high school volunteers. She was annoyed that I didn't take my children out of the room before the time she said she'd have parent-teacher conferences (despite the fact that she had indicated she had no problem with them being there during the conferences upon my asking). My students were not left alone though, and I don't think it's unacceptable to leave them alone either. Hilariously contradictory prescription of running out to get someone, leaving them alone momentarily, so you could run out of the room without having left them alone afterward (he really meant to say we should call).
