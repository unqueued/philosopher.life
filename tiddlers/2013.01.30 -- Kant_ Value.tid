title: 2013.01.30 -- Kant: Value

(Admittedly, this is not an essay, but really a compilation of notes and questions.)

The good will is the only good thing without limitation. Other talents of the mind and character have limitations; they can be twisted to do evil things. Only the good will enables worthiness of happiness.1 Some qualities are instrumentally useful in enabling the good will, but they unconditional worth. Their value stems from the end they cause, the good will. “Moderation in affects and passions, self-control, and calm reflection” aren’t merely instrumental, but “constitute a part of the inner worth of a person.”2 .” Yet, these can be twisted for evil as well, and thus are conditionally good.

A good will is not good because it causes another end. Even a will which isn’t efficacious is still a good will.3 Only the good will have absolute worth (value!).4 Surely it can’t be merely the idea of a good will that is good. It must an instantiation – any particular good will is absolutely good.

I’m left wondering: Why can’t action, even while not out of respect for the moral law, have any moral worth? Yes, actions in general are conditional in value. But, why can’t value be contextual and particularistic? Also, does the good will admit of degrees? I asked this before, perhaps, regarding motivation. I feel as if I’ve either failed to understand the explanation or I’m unsatisfied with it.

Reason does not exist for our preservation, welfare, or happiness, but rather for the good will.5 Reason is certainly necessary for producing the good will.6 Is it sufficient? Reason can master our desires and other motivations, so perhaps it may be.7 Also, why should I think reason can master our desires?

Actions have no worth if they do not come from respect for the moral law. Actions are definitely conditional in their moral value. 8 Kant provides some famous examples (which continue through 398).

Sometimes it is only respect for the moral law which can motivate us to do an action.9 I need an example action? What sort of action couldn’t be described by the egoist’s motivation?

The concept of morality holds for all rational beings, not just humans.10 Why is the categorical imperative an apodictic law? It seems doubtable to me? Am I not rational? Yes, the CI is based upon pure reason, it is known a priori, and not be based upon experience or even by popular vote, but apodicticity is a very significant claim.11

Kant explains: “Only a rational being has the capacity to act in accordance with the representation of laws, that is, in accordance with principles, or has a will.”12 When reason does not infallibly determine the will, then such a being is necessitated.13 He continues, “The representation of an objective principle, insofar as it is necessitating for a will, is called a command (of reason), and the formula of the command is called an imperative.”14 Imperatives are ought for those being which are necessitated.15 No imperatives exist for the divine, holy, perfectly good will; they aren’t necessitated. Human wills, however, are necessitated.16 There are two kinds of imperatives: hypothetical and categorical. Hypothetical imperatives are practical, instrumental reasoning. Categorical imperative demonstrates what is “objectively necessary of itself, without reference to another end.”17 So the hypothetical imperative is about actions which are “good merely as a means to something else,” and categorical imperative is about actions represented as in themselves good, and “as necessary in a will in itself comforting to reason.”18

For the CI, is the action good in itself? I assume not. What then, it meant here? It seems like the action is instrumental, as it is a necessary means to an end, the end being having a good will. It isn’t good in itself, I assume, because it could be done not out of respect for the CI, or it is contingent in its efficaciousness, or it could be twisted, maybe.

I worry that what Kant’s sketching a better argument for something like moral rationalism than he is about the CI. That moral claims should be motivating in themselves and that they override any other sort of reasons seem to come from his argument. Only those moral propositions which are always true, necessarily true, are those which override all other reasons. Lots of moral theories could agree to that though, right?

Alright. I have more thoughts and questions, but I’m feel I’m way over my limit and that this should be sufficient.

January 30: Value

Groundwork Section I (pp. 4:393-397)

Groundwork Section II (pp. 4:405-414, 426, 437)

Critique of Practical Reason (pp. 5:57-67)



Groundwork Section I (pp. 4:393-397)


4:393, Good will is the only good thing without limitation. Other talents of the mind and character have limitations, they can be twisted to do evil things. Only the good will enables worthiness of happiness.


4:393-394, Some qualities are instrumentally useful in enabling the good will, but they unconditional worth. Their value stems from the end they cause, the good will. “Moderation in affects and passions, self-control, and calm reflection” aren’t merely instrumental, but “constitute a part of the inner worth of a person.” Yet, these can be twisted for evil as well, and thus are conditionally good.


Question: Why can’t action, even while not out of respect for the moral law, have any moral worth? Yes, actions in general are conditional in value. But, why can’t value be contextual and particularistic?


4:394, A good will is not good because it causes another end. Even a will which isn’t efficacious is still a good will (Korsgaard disagrees, maybe).


4:394, Only the good will have absolute worth (value!).


Question: Surely it can’t be merely the idea of a good will that is good. It must an instantiation – any particular good will is absolutely good. (Ha, no question mark)


Question: Does the good will admit of degrees? I asked this before, perhaps, regarding motivation. I feel as if I’ve either failed to understand the explanation or I’m unsatisfied with it.


4:395, Reason does not exist for our preservation, welfare, or happiness, but rather for the good will.


4:395, Question: What is practical use?


4:396, Question: Reason is certainly necessary for producing the good will. It is sufficient?


4:397, Actions have no worth if they do not come from respect for the moral law. Actions are definitely conditional in their moral value. Shopkeeper example.




Groundwork Section II (pp. 4:405-414, 426, 437)


4:405, Question: What does Kant mean by wisdom? It is a term of art in other contexts.


The natural dialectic is the “propensity to rationalize against those strict laws of duty.”


4:406, “refined self-love” is egoism, I assume.


4:407, Sometimes it is only respect for the moral law which can motivate us to do an action.


Question: I need an example action? What sort of action couldn’t be described by the egoist’s motivation?


4:408, the concept of morality holds for all rational beings, not just humans


4:408, Questions: Why is the categorical imperative an apodictic law? It seems doubtable to me? Am I not rational?


4:409, The CI is based upon pure reason, it is known a priori, and not be experience or even by popular vote.


4:411, Reason can master our desires and other motivations.


Question: Why should I think this is true?


4:412, “Only a rational being has the capacity to act in accordance with the representation of laws, that is, in accordance with principles, or has a will.”


4:412-413, When reason does not infallibly determine the will, then such a being is necessitated.


4:413, “The representation of an objective principle, insofar as it is necessitating for a will, is called a command (of reason), and the formula of the command is called an imperative.”


4:413, Imperatives are ought for those being which are necessitated.


4:414, No imperatives exist for the divine, holy, perfectly good will, which aren’t necessitated. Human wills, however, are necessitated, and thus there are imperatives for us.


4:414, There are 2 kinds of imperatives: hypothetical and categorical. Hypothetical imperatives is practical, instrumental reasoning. Categorical imperative demonstrates what is “objectively necessary of itself, without reference to another end.”


4:414, “All imperatives are formulae for the determination of action that is necessary in accordance with the principle of a will which is good in some way.”


4:414, So the hypothetical imperative is about actions which are “good merely as a means to something else,” and categorical imperative is about actions represented as in themselves good, and “as necessary in a will in itself comforting to reason.”


Question: For the CI, is the action good in itself? I assume not. What then, it meant here? It seems like the action is instrumental, as it is a necessary means to an end, the end being having a good will. It isn’t good in itself, I assume, because it could be done not out of respect for the CI, or it is contingent in its efficaciousness, or it could be twisted, maybe.



4:426, Kant really fucking hates the empirical world. =)


Question: I worry that what Kant’s sketching a better argument for something like moral rationalism than he is about the CI. That moral claims should be motivating in themselves and that they override any other sort of reasons seem to come from his argument. Only those moral propositions which are always true, necessarily true, are those which override all other reasons. Lots of moral theories could agree to that though, right?



4:437, “act in accordance with a maxim that can at the same time make itself a universal law”


Question: What does it mean to “provide access for the moral law?”


The will which is good is by definition not evil.


Question: What exactly is meant by a maxim (I’ve heard many definitions)?


Question: Is the CI objective? Does it have a metaphysical existence? Does reason? Is Kant begging the question on these?



Critique of Practical Reason (pp. 5:57-67)


5:58, “The only objects of a practical reason are therefore those of the good and the evil.”


5:60, Distinguishes good and evil from well-being and ill-being.


5:62, Well-being is empirical, conditional, etc.


5:63, “the concept of good an evil must not be determined before the moral law…but only…after it and by means of it”


5:66, Perfect (forbidden/obligated) and imperfect (permitted) duties.





To be clear: Would Kant agree that a Psychopath (a) possesses reason, and (b) is a moral agent, despite lacking emotional, empathic motivations?

6:399-400


If I don’t feel the pull of rationality, if I don’t immediately see that it should override my other reasons, am I irrational?
