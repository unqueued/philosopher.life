title: j3d1h: Getting ethernet to your room

* Getting ethernet to your mom
** Measure the distance we need
** Pick it out the cheapest on either Monoprice (w/shipping costs included) or Amazon (I highly suggest using Prime costs). 
** We buy the cheapest one. 1uxb0x and I run the cable. 
** You setup one of our classic DD-WRT routers to be a switch for you. Voila.
