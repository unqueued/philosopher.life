title: 2004.09.07 -- Candide

	Voltaire was one of the most influential satire writers of the Enlightenment. He was a leading philosopher, author, and was known for his clever assaults on the French government, Facile Optimism, and organized religion.

The European monarchy and nobility were ridiculed for their greed, jealousy, and poor judgment. The Baron (referred to as My Lord the Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh) is quick to judge Candide for an innocent kiss to the princess, giving Candide many kicks in the behind while expelling Candide from the castle. The Baron represented the impulsive commands given by European monarchs. Candide is brought into the Bulgarian (actually Prussian) army; Voltaire mocks the famous “tall” soldiers. Marchiousness of Parolignac symbolizes how almost every monarch would sell their soul and even other peoples lives, disregarding the necessity of character and values, for riches and treasures (like huge diamond rings). The sheer greed of the European monarchs disgusted Voltaire. Senator Seignor Pococurante was a perfect example of what Voltaire thought about the nobility’s unappreciative view towards their possessions. The Senator was shown to have everything he could ever want, and yet Candide and Martin find that wealth does not bring happiness.

	Voltaire finds organized religion (church) to be corrupt and hypocritical. During the course of the story we find many corrupt priests and leaders of the church. These men strike political deals (as in the case of the mistress Lady Cunegonde), commit adultery, and harbor non-Christian values. Voltaire, through Candide, mentions that in a utopian environment there is only one God, and no need for monks, priests, or other such corruptions of the church.

	Wealth, status, and greed are some of the main themes examined in Candide. Almost every person in the book was corruptible and buyable. Ship captains ran off with Candide’s loaded sheep, people wondered at Candide for how he had not the slightest hint of sadness when losing a fortune and even the Jewish merchants would pay only half of what a diamond was worth out of sheer greed. It is evident that Voltaire finds all people, the monarchs, nobility, clergy, sailors, and even common ordinary people corruptible and easily twisted by the very sight of wealth. Voltaire in defining a utopia (El Dorado) and through the use of characters shows that wealth, status, and power are of no use, are the root of much evil, and warp even the purest of heart.

	Voltaire believes love and romance is not always to be, and optimism in the area of love is ignorance. He shows the relationship between Lady Cunegonde and Candide as being hopeless. When they finally get to settle down, Cundegonde is ugly and old, and Candide no longer loves her, but marries her out of pride. 

	In Candide, the “Enlightened” philosopher Pangloss’s many tragedies point out how, ironically, life is not perfect (never will be) and is not always for the best. The book of Candide itself symbolizes the complete lack of insight of the “Enlightenment.” Voltaire proves that life is not always for the best by simply observing the tragedies and horrible outcome of Candide’s life and of the many other characters in Candide. Voltaire conveys that man’s misery comes from himself, and that evil is innate. The happiest man in the world realizes what the world is, and is comfortable saying that the world is not perfect, and that “there is a pleasure in having no pleasure.” (spoken by Martin the philosopher)

	Candide is relevant to today’s society because it addresses core issues of humanity. Candide addresses what causes pain, why the world is not perfect, the irrelevance of worldly wealth in attaining happiness, the hypocrisy of the church, and the everlasting corruption of the government.
