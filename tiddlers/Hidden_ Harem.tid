title: Hidden: Harem

//This is recurring half-woken dream I keep indulging in my morning glory. I've decided to write about it.//

Who wouldn't want to have multiple partners to fuck? Seriously. Sex is a drug, so why not develop lifestyles and environments where we get to take that drug as often as pleasurably as possible? I think polygamy sounds damn fun. It would be amazing to have multiple women living with me. Flavor is good. Always having someone to fuck would be great. Orgies sounds excellent. 

Setting/Concept/Mechanics, Subplots, Recurring Themes:

* Dystopian Utopia, maybe something like the Crasterian Harem

* Remote control vibrators. Everyone must orgasm, especially when it is inopportune.
** Heartrate equipped, biometrics analyzed, machined learned, tailored to each individual, very good at bringing each individual to climax, edging, and multiple-orgasms
** Must carry phones or be in my wireless network range at all times, as that's how the vibes are controlled.
*** Video monitored as well?
** Swap equipment daily, charge, them, etc. 
** Have tiny window of time to swap
** For women, would seem like crotchet underwear most of the time, except on the red tide. 
** For the trannies, would be a loose cockring and perhaps testicle stimulator.
** Everyone must wear Vibes at all times. Those who fail in any way are imprisoned at various stages in the dungeon. GIMP being the lowest circle of hell.

* Substance Use
** Cannabliss and MDMA to share the love, heighten experiences, etc.

* The Household Orgasm is a ritual. Think of this as similar to Islam's Salat, but instead of 5 times a day, we go 3-5 times a day, depending on mood or festivity.
** Everyone wakes up to my push of the button (or my voice signature controls it, like a clap-on). Start the day off right.

* Individual Scenes
** Awkward:
*** In the middle of class
*** While breastfeeding
** Punishment:
*** At dinner
