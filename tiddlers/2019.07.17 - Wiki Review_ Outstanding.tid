* [[2019.07.16 - Wiki Review: Converse]]
** I'm going to get tipsy again tonight. I have saki, cheap AF, will go with le sushi.
* [[2019.07.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: RW]]

** Well, I got almost all of it done today! It's okay, homie.

** I'm not giving him as much space here. 
* [[2019.07.16 - BDS97: LF]]
** Replacements. Should just go with the b3nsn0w at this point though, eh? 
** Excellent conversation. As usual, I don't understand nearly enough.
* [[2019.07.16 - SWW: I'm Sorry]]
