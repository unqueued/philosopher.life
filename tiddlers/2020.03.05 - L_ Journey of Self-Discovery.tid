[8:51 PM] h0p3: How goes your weekend?

[2:55 PM] h0p3: Heyas, how was your weekend?

[8:49 PM] h0p3: How's your week going?

[8:45 PM] h0p3: Yo, you okay?
[9:08 PM] Sohalia: Oh shit, yes I am. It’s been a stressful adventure these past few days. I’m sorry I missed your messages.
[9:09 PM] Sohalia: I have been hyper focused on [[K]] and am trying to scramble to prepare as much as I can for a full week of PTO next week.
[9:09 PM] h0p3: Awesome. I think it's wonderful.
[9:09 PM] Sohalia: Thankfully he’s getting better though, slowly but surely.
[9:09 PM] h0p3: I hope you have the time of your lives.
[9:10 PM] Sohalia: I always do on vacation xD
[9:10 PM] Sohalia: Even if it’s just sitting around. It’s nice to not have to worry about work for once.
[9:10 PM] h0p3: Sounds like you guys could use a break to chill together.
[9:12 PM] h0p3: The whirlwind, I think, might get worse in the Fall for you here. It sounds like you have a ton of transitions, including health.
[9:13 PM] Sohalia: Yeah.... these medicine escapades have been rough for us. When things started feeling weird for him, his instinct was to withdraw even from me which was strange. We’re still more than okay, it was just strange not being as affectionate/close with him for that period.
[9:14 PM] h0p3: I think it's smart to knock out anxiety/depression. I know it's stupid hard, but I think it's awesome that you keep hunting. I hope the break will also be super helpful for that too.
[9:17 PM] Sohalia: It has honestly gotten better. Slowly but surely. As weird as this sounds, I think a lot of my journey with depression has just been trying to figure out who I really am/what I want/what I believe. [[K]] and I have changed a lot. Our beliefs and values have changed so much in these past few years. It almost feels alien to talk to mom about Christianity now.
[9:23 PM] h0p3: I'm sorry.
[9:24 PM] h0p3: I know that pain.
[9:25 PM] h0p3: I agree that depression and anxiety help us come to terms with who we are and in relation to what.
[9:25 PM] h0p3: Terrible process.
[9:26 PM] h0p3: When we are lucky, it's a positive disintegration.
[9:27 PM] Sohalia: I mean, it’s been positive for me so far
[9:28 PM] h0p3: That is good. It's not always. Sometimes pain and falling apart is just that.
[9:29 PM] Sohalia: I wouldn’t say that I don’t believe at all anymore but I sure don’t believe this mainstream bullshit that a lot of Christians carry to their graves.
[9:30 PM] Sohalia: I’m also absurdly positive though, so... maybe it was always going to be this way for me, no matter how it degraded.
[9:30 PM] h0p3: Being unwilling to change through reason is not something we should maintain with to our graves. That said, I think we should be willing to die for what we really believe. It's an odd mix of a problem.
[9:31 PM] Sohalia: True that
[9:31 PM] h0p3: I will argue that we can question our biases very thoroughly. It's not inevitable, however, I will agree it is more likely.
[9:33 PM] Sohalia: It’s just crazy to me how much people will believe that garbage and see any questioning as blasphemous
[9:34 PM] h0p3: Aye. They take their emotional desires to be more important than cognitively evaluating. Being unable to question, no matter how it is phrased or explained, is unacceptably dogmatic.
[9:34 PM] h0p3: You able to find other Christians your age who feel similarly?
[9:35 PM] h0p3: [[k0sh3k]] has a Discord of Anglicans that she gets along with really well.
[9:36 PM] h0p3: Dicksword Christians might be easier to connect with sometimes.
[9:36 PM] h0p3: One of the folks in the discord turned out to be a student worker of hers. Lol. That was neat.
[9:37 PM] Sohalia: Honestly? We haven’t. We’ve stopped going to church altogether. We had one we liked, but it disbanded (of course). So now we just do whatever on Sundays.
[9:37 PM] Sohalia: Pretty sure my mom would have a cow xD
[9:39 PM] h0p3: I feel that pain.
[9:40 PM] Sohalia: True that,
[9:41 PM] Sohalia: I have just been silent with my mom about her faith. She keeps giving me books I don’t want to use. >_>
[9:41 PM] h0p3: I wish I knew what to do there. I still stay at home myself. I see my sabbath as being with my family still.
[9:42 PM] h0p3: I don't know what to do about the book issue. I have mixed feelings obviously. Open disagreement is sometimes much harder than a quiet one.
[9:44 PM] Sohalia: I think family time is a good use of that
[9:44 PM] h0p3: I have it easy here. I'm so ridiculously annoying, frustrating, and infuriating to speak with on this topic that people will generally attempt to avoid speaking about it with me. It's tricky, of course, because I rabbithole around a lot in conversations.
[9:44 PM] Sohalia: Well... and part of it is that I don’t entirely not believe. I just don’t agree with her in most things now.
[9:45 PM] h0p3: I have to say, it's been very difficult for my wife with her own mother.
[9:46 PM] h0p3: Ridiculously painful. I feel like the relationship between them is often a simulation, not real enough feeling.
[9:48 PM] h0p3: I feel exceptionally lucky to be able to spend so much time with my offspring. It's hard to be well-prepared for fundamental disagreements.
[9:49 PM] Sohalia: Oof
[9:51 PM] h0p3: That is one thing which has stood out to me about your mother: at some point, she doesn't give a shit how much she disagrees with you. You are literally her baby until the end.
[9:51 PM] Sohalia: It’s true.
[9:51 PM] h0p3: I hope to emulate her model in my own parenting right there.
[9:52 PM] Sohalia: She is a good mom in that respect for sure. I think she’s worried about growing apart from me... but what’s funny is that I enjoy her company outside of talking about faith quite a bit.
[9:52 PM] h0p3: She's brilliant, fun, and different.
[9:53 PM] h0p3: Honesty has been costly for me.
[9:54 PM] h0p3: But, it's been super awesome to see what stands in honesty. That has been important to me.
[9:56 PM] Sohalia: What do you mean by “stands in honesty”?
[9:58 PM] h0p3: I think I get to be more forthcoming and myself in coming to terms with my own depression and anxiety.
[9:58 PM] Sohalia: Ah, gotcha
[10:00 PM] Sohalia: I can somewhat say the same
[10:08 PM] Sohalia: It forced me to look at my faith more seriously and stop letting me talk myself into and out of things.
[10:09 PM] h0p3: Sounds like a stabilizing force.
[10:09 PM] Sohalia: I never realized how bad I am about that
[10:11 PM] h0p3: I don't think you are bad at it. It's an expensive existential task.
[10:20 PM] Sohalia: Between what I wanted to do with my life and what I believed I feel like I’ve been talking myself into and out of things for awhile
[10:23 PM] Sohalia: Now I’m just worried [[AG]] will do the same when it comes to her college
[10:23 PM] h0p3: Yeah, I think that is a common difficulty people of our generation face.
[10:24 PM] h0p3: You have very different dispositions and personalities, and I don't know enough about the future. I am simply unable to guess where [[AG]] will be traveling in life.
[10:24 PM] h0p3: What would you recommend to [[AG]]?
[10:31 PM] Sohalia: I would talk to her about what she wants her home life to be like.
[10:32 PM] Sohalia: Because if anyone had told me that my personal life would be stepped all over as an engineer I never would have gone in that focus
[10:32 PM] h0p3: That is a fascinating place to start.
[10:32 PM] Sohalia: It’s almost thinking backwards
[10:33 PM] h0p3: It also depends on how that home life came to be, but I think that has to be a necessary (even if it isn't sufficient) look. That is a good starting place.
[10:34 PM] h0p3: I wish you knew up front what you were facing. The world is very, very large and complex.
[10:35 PM] Sohalia: I guess the conversation should shift to “what do you want most in your future”
[10:35 PM] Sohalia: Oh for sure
[10:35 PM] Sohalia: Being so sheltered from it didn’t help much either. I had no idea what to expect.
[10:36 PM] h0p3: I still don't feel like I'm doing enough with my own offspring. It's a scary hard problem.
[10:37 PM] h0p3: http://www.raisinggodlytomatoes.com/
[10:37 PM] Sohalia: [[h0p3]] no xD
[10:37 PM] Sohalia: I read parts of this blog and it eventually led me to the Amazon reviews of ordering her book
[10:38 PM] Sohalia: Those 1 star reviews basically confirmed for me that it was exactly what I expected.
[10:40 PM] h0p3: Lawd. Those are some reviews.
[10:41 PM] Sohalia: I still believe you’re doing a good job by honestly presenting and discussing modern problems to them
[10:42 PM] Sohalia: Sure they may not always pay attention these days but you’d be surprised how much teenagers retain even when you think they’re not listening.
[10:42 PM] h0p3: We're still thinking about schools up here.
[10:43 PM] Sohalia: For high school?
[10:43 PM] h0p3: They have done between reasonably and excellently these past two weeks. But, it's not easy for them.
[10:43 PM] h0p3: Middle for [[1uxb0x]], High for [[j3d1h]]
[10:44 PM] h0p3: I've been going through the Yearly Cross-sections of our wikis with them to try and see more clearly what our progress has been like. I feel more hopeful when I see it.
[10:46 PM] h0p3: I'd prefer they make decisions here before the Fall (but, it can be after).
[10:47 PM] h0p3: I think they'd be crazy not to homeschool and work their asses off here. But, there are some non-trivial advantages and risk adjustments in going to school.
[10:48 PM] h0p3: I think their attention spans are excellent. They can recite my opinion back to me better than I can sometimes, lol. Motivation is hard though.
[10:49 PM] h0p3: I've been asking them "What do you want, and why?" including about their future quite a bit.
[10:50 PM] h0p3: Not that young people can answer that well enough on their own, but it's necessary for preserving and training their autonomy that they take the wheels here.
[11:03 PM] Sohalia: It’s true
[11:04 PM] Sohalia: I was taught to look ahead at least enough for it to help me get on the right track again, and it helps keep me out of trouble most days at work
