This is the most interesting of the pieces of his I've seen so far. It takes a great deal of effort to peel apart the appearance of hypocrisy here. The exact kind of work he's engaged is about instilling fear and paranoia. His point is largely correct though. He does not contradict himself (although he isn't as careful with his words as he should be).
