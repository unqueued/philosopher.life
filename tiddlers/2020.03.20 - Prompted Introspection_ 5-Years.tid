title: 2020.03.20 - Prompted Introspection: 5-Years

!! Where do you think you will be in five years?

[[2018.06.04 - Prompted Introspection Log: In 5 Years]] is fascinating to see. I agree that I'm awful at answering this question, but I feel like I have a feasible chance to get better at it (though I will not yet claim that I am getting better at it). I also don't think that so much of this will be up to me, so I'm happy to be more satisfied with a vague answer.

[[TTP]] work with my offspring has been useful to us. I hope we continue to make progress. I'm less embarrassed by my [[TDL]]s these days, [[WINTCIS]]. 

I still have 3 years to go before I'd hit that 5-year mark from the last time I answered this question. I'm sad to say I recognize that my offspring might not flourish, and they might not choose to go to college (or have the chance if the world becomes significantly worse). I am [[hope]]ful though. I appreciate my offspring's autonomy, and I'm grateful that we have the chance to practice. Who knows what will happen?

We've already moved, and it was big deal. I have more [[faith]] in my wife than she has in herself. I'm glad she went for it. I can tell you my {[[dreams]]} are narrower (I'm glad too, in this case). We have a sick opportunity here. I've told my daughter that she is a minor, and the odds of her actually getting into any serious legal trouble are so low that she should take much greater risks in hacking her way into Yale; social engineering is her best bet. It might only take one or two professors to realize who she is.<<ref "w">> We could prep for this. But, of course, that is a {[[dream]]}, and the stars must align.<<ref "b">> I hope our fear of regret will outweigh our fear of risks here. As I often tell them, I will be honored for them to be wise janitors.

It's possible my daughter will wait to go to college. The extra money Yale would provide my offspring won't kick in for her until she's already 19 or 20. A gap year. Working as an artist, programmer, or just learning on her own, socializing, I don't know. I don't know enough about my daughter's choices to know, and neither does she. I am glad for the uncertainty. She'll be dating (or not). What will it be like to speak with her SO? I am afraid that my daughter will not find someone intelligent, knowledgeable, and decent enough to understand her; no one has ever received training like hers before.

I am an abject failure in predicting my son. I hope he will be happier, focused, and practiced in being himself in a hostile world. He'll be 17. My god. That's so fucking hard to imagine. He's my baby. Even tonight, I hugged him and pecked him with a dozen kisses. I'm going to be lost without my son. I predict my son will still be the kindest person I know, and I hope he will be understood and deeply loved by many. 

The world has been in flux in 2020, the contradictions chain-react in the world. I suggest my projection will be radically altered by the state of political affairs in the world.

I cannot answer the question. I am sorry. It weighs on me every day. I just want to [[Be A Good Dad]] with what I've got. I'm blind.

I think there's a reasonable chance we will all still be writing our wikis together. Let us see.

As for myself, I will be masturbating, reading and writing, annoying all who maintain relationships with me, and/or dead/imprisoned. I'm hoping my hair will completely grey/white. I anticipate I'll be fatter. My word salad, intelligence, and memory will only get worse. I wonder if I will finally accomplish my Frankian goal of "gettin' real weird wit it." Cultivating mass and madmanimity, right?
