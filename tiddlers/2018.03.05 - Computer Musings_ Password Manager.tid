title: 2018.03.05 - Computer Musings: Password Manager

I've tried this before, and it just sucked. I was super unhappy with all the password managers I tried. My last consideration was using a a password hasher salted by the context, of which there have been many tools. I'm not happy with that either. It's time to suck it up and start using the tool. Opensourced and lots of development. KeePassXC seems to fit the bill. I'm having trouble with it though (not a good sign), but overall I'm impressed with it.

The browser extension will not connect to the program.

Tried what's in Pacman, tried compilation from AUR. 

```
sudo pacman -S snapd --noconfirm
sudo systemctl start snapd.refresh.timer
sudo snap install keepassxc
```

No go. Kill and removed.

Tried Appimage. No go. Removed.

I don't feel like figuring it out.

Wanted to try IRC, but it's not working well. It's slow as fuck on multiple servers, a connection problem I suspect. Two clients, tried a VPN. Something's not right.

Upgrading system, rebooting, and going to see what happens.

I want to embrace rolling releases, and I'm willing to have my system break to some degree. I'm hoping to eventually setup a safe enough nightly update, but I can't afford for my kernel or graphics to either break or require nightly restarts (I never know when I really would prefer not to restart). I will upgrade these, but I have to do it manually to check for breakage and/or rollback. The rest of the ecosystem is actually more stable, imho.

So Manjaro pushed KeePassXC through Unstable->Testing->Stable very quickly. Within hours it was done. Someone relies upon it, clearly.

Also, I found an option to make it work in Firefox. Setup complete. Unfortunately, can't export Chrome passwords. Good news is that I'm going to have to go through each and every one of them in the first place, so...yeah.
