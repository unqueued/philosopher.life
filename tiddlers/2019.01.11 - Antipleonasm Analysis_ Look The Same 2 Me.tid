I am not an expert on the definitions of socialism and communism, but I am not convinced Rand is either. This exaggerated claim doesn't appear to have much charity at all. To my understanding, socialism is the means to communism for we [[fff]], but communism is either the end or the means to [[Humanity]] (personhood) itself as the end. It appears, at least in our case, that they do in fact have the same means, or that socialism is only the first step of those means. 

Rand and I are going to have a profound disagreement on what counts as slavery. Justice is obviously a continuously updated pattern of Hohfeldian moral property rights which we can only ever heuristically come to understand (into [[infinigress]]). Clearly, since Rand denies the unconditional normativity of [[The Golden Rule]], she will deny that we collectively have a profound set of moral property rights to each other. I think serving each other is a moral duty, and in fact, people have a right to my person by definition in a wide variety of cases (including the current state of affairs). 

I think Rand's proposal leads to a massive form of slavery instead. It is a failure to respect the dignity of persons, to fulfill our obligations to others, to give ourselves to each other to the [[dok]] we owe each other, etc.

Rand appears to favor some instantiation of the state of nature. There is no voting in such a thing. The notion that we must be held accountable to the desires and beliefs of others to any [[dok]] (and I'm not claiming that this is maximal or unconditional in all cases, obviously) is incoherent on her view.

The murder vs. suicide line is pure hyperbole. Obviously, I think what she proposes is murder and slavery too.
