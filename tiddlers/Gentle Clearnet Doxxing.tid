//Who are you, nomad? I seek you in many deserts.//

All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.

Privacy is flatout controversial on this wiki, but I'm not playing a useless game. I will defend this process, a public experiment in public consciousness.

I regularly argue the claim that privacy is a crucial morally-justified political right in a wide variety of contexts. Unfortunately, I'm not convinced it is a moral right in all possible contexts (a radically universalized, unparticularized Categorical Imperative); it's clear to me that losing my privacy was actually my moral duty in this case. I suggest your Hofeldian moral and political privacy rights aren't nearly as simple as you think they are. You may be worried that my taking my clothes off in public doesn't give me permission to state who I think you are outloud: I'm listening to your arguments.

Until then, you will see what I'm thinking about in public, including how I'm reasoning about you (a load which already pushes my spare cognitive capacity to the limits; privacy of many [[dok]] is far harder to achieve than almost any of us realize). Is it really wrong for me to want to know who you are by using readily available public information? I suggest I'm not at fault for whatever wrongness you may find in this case. I am open to debating it with you.

Fear not, the asymmetry in our relationship is beyond profound at this level. Be honest with yourself: you have the information advantage. I think you should be easy on me here, in part, because I've doxxed myself into oblivion with this wiki. The vulnerability here is truly mine. You know more about who I am than I could probably ever know about you. I get to have an idea of who you are through the internet; you get not just that, but you also practically get to see what's inside my head beyond even my imagination. I gently level the playing field for myself in our [[T42T]] trust game because my radical transparency merits yours to some non-trivial [[dok]]. This is a [[Wiki Litmus Test]].

I suggest you charitably consider why you want to cast your stone, nomad. With moral justification, I'm willing to keep a secret a secret; the personal information herein, however, is neither private nor secret. This is public information, folks.

I will inspect your online identity because I, a naked lifeblogger, have a non-trivial moral right to try to interpret you charitably and openly with information readily available on the clearnet. I'm not digging deep here, but I am trying to get a sketch of you and materialize a representation of your identity for myself in my wiki. I do so with enormous transparency (and you are most welcome). 

I write stuff down that catches my eye, guesswork, etc. Feel free to contact me about it.
