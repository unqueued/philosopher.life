title: 2018.03.26 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Fighting the Cold

!! How did your family fight the common cold? What was the 'cure'?

Sleep, drinking fluid, effectively blowing my nose (I've had pneumonia twice already in my life; my lungs ain't so good), washing hands, coughing into elbow-pit (?what do I call it?), and mild quarantine to attempt to prevent transmission to others. We did receive cough syrup at times, and I think this was primarily to make us sleep.
