title: 2020.01.29 - TDL: Something Better Than Nothing

* Tortellini, salad, fruit
** Need to figure out something for [[k0sh3k]]. Might have a non-dairy option directly. We need to check.
* Your offspring still haven't turned in lists. =/.
* I like the work they are doing in CS. It's at least constructive, and something is better than nothing.
** Desperately need to get back into a groove.
* You aren't sleeping enough still, but there's not much you can do about it. Take it where you can find it.
* Calls to folks would be solid.
* Plenty of wiki work.
** Docker + https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter + a tiddler
*** Still a fan of ratox, but Discord is far more feature rich.
