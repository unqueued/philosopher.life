title: 2018.06.12 - Wiki Audit: Titles

I'm changing up the titles a bit. I want to make them cleaner to look at. I know they are logs, so why continue saying it? I've been at this for a couple years now, and I might as well make it say exactly what I want it to say, right?

Upgraded to Tiddlywiki 5.1.17

Prepped for [[Infinite Jest]]

Got lots of little things done in {[[About]]} and [[h0p3's Lexicon]].
