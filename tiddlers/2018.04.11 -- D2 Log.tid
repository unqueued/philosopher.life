Sorc, first Council run, I died. I'm so Insight reliant. =/ Had to get my merc's resists to 90. Second run, where I actually cleared them: Ist!

I need leech on my merc, but it cost is his resists. This is tough.

Running Summoner Keys. I need at least 18 or something (probably 24-27). Might as well grind them out.

YES!!!! FOUND NATURE'S PEACE RING!!! This is exactly what I was looking for to farm the last key. Nihthifukilak is such a pain the ass, and I was about to Lawbringer it on a char that didn't want it (and I didnt' want to necro that shit). So...Sorc is back in bidness!

22 Keys of Hate found on my runs. Random shit, but that ring was worth every penny. Now I can farm the full set of keys without a problem. That is what I'm doing.
