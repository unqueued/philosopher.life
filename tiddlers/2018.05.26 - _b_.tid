I find myself stuck:

* If anything can be real, nothing is real.
* If everything is necessary, nothing matters.

I'm looking for goldilocks zone for necessity and contingency.

I know someone who barely empathizes with others unless it has an immediate, gutteral, in his face requirement that forces him to face it. I know I can trace much of what he does back to psychological egoist principles. I suppose, even if he does not empathize all that much in general, he make several moves to do so with me. That's why we are still friends. 

I think this problem of not seeking to be a political animal, of not actually giving a shit about solving the crisis of capitalism, feels far more like a direct attack on me because I'm part of the group suffering from capitalism (although, let me point out, I'm not suffering nearly as much as the vast majority).
