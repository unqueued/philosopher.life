title: 2017.07.22 -- Pipefitting Log

I will be getting a new smartphone soon. I will take pictures of my work with it. I need to start a portfolio. 

I bought new clothes that actually fit me. I selected very cheap, rugged, wide-pocket jeans that actually fit my waist. Oh, I'm now wearing 34x29 and 36x29 pants. Good job! I look actually a bit muscley in my new shirts which are stretchy and provide excellent breathing (it's hot as fuck). The shirts are bright green for safety, so I don't have to wear the hot vest as well. I got underwear that breathed and was correctly sized (mine fall off really easy since I've lost weight), and I picked up socks (which I desperately needed). I picked up 2 more bandana/handkerchiefs, and I will try wearing them in addition to having them in my pocket (I may pick up 5 more if I like it: they are very cheap, thankfully). It cost about $120 for 5 days worth of clothes (my work schedule). 

After picking up new mattresses for the kids, I'm holding off on more purchases, including our unlocked phones and switch to likely T-mobile until next week. I want to actually still be filling the bank account.

I'm going to setup the old chromebook, and give my wife my current laptop, monster-13. I want her to have a working machine between work and home. I just need something simple while I'm way. I can work within limits.
