title: 2018.10.11 - Prompted Introspection: Band

!! If you were in the band, what instrument would you be playing?

Piano, guitar, banjo, and clarinet have been my primary instruments. I like clarinet the least of them, and I have quite painful memories of piano. I don't know what the band needs. If it were important enough, I suppose I could learn any instrument except voice. Give me 12 hours a day for a couple weeks, and I'd be able to play most instruments at an intermediate level. I don't see the value in it.
