title: 2017.01.09 - Donors: Post-Kids'-Birthdays Letter

We received your letter from October in the mail today. It was good to hear from you again.

I also forgot to say thank you for the birthday presents for the kids. [[j3d1h]] says thank you for the GoPro. She said she wants to make piano videos with it. She's definitely interested in making content/art. [[1uxb0x]] says he loves the marble racing kit (the kids spent the better part of two days making towers). Also, they made their first stop-motion video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErFFTa4NbXc ([[1uxb0x]] is in charge of directing and narrative, [[j3d1h]] setup the tech side [she'll still do the uploading/posting, but he now can create the videos himself]). Thank you for making their birthdays special. 

It snowed two days ago. I haven't seen real snow in a while. Our home is warm though (we found some plastic that creates an air bubble insulation for our patio + windows), and we're doing normal mammal things together (yay, I love being a mammal). You guys may want to bring some warm clothes. 

I mean this literally: you are welcome to stay with us. 

[[L&K]] found our place (understandably) claustrophobic on their first visit, so they stayed at a hotel on their last visit. It can be tricky having family over with a small place. I know I can't provide the space that you may need, so I want you to choose whatever will make you feel comfortable. I don't want you to feel you aren't welcome, because you are. I also don't want you to feel forced to stay in a cramped room, because you aren't. 

Whatever works, let's do that.

Love,

[[h0p3]]
