<<<
It's been a while!
<<<

Aye. I'm so excited to see you! I hope you are doing well. What have you been up to? How's life going?

<<<
I see I've got two links to check out in your link logs.
<<<

Oh, yeah, lol. I appreciate that you dig for it. I had to go search for that when you said it. I'm still trying to figure out how to make it convenient for people to search themselves and what they find interesting on the wiki. My brother [[JRE]] wants a more "highlight reel" kind of feed in [[Timelines]], but I have no idea how to do that for me. You know how to dig and take it upon yourself; I think I'm going to stick with that for now.

I wish I had more links for you directly. I've slowed down recently on that log, the hoarded buildup is getting worse, lol. It comes and goes, I guess.

<<<
Everything was all turned around when I visited your site - the nested sidebar tabs are pretty cool, and whoa, firmcoding has been fleshed out a lot!
<<<

You are one of the few people who know how much it has changed! It feels so different to me too.

We've been experimenting, and it's been fun. I'm slowly inching into the dynamic pool. Nesting the tabs has given me some breathing space and provided more hierarchy. Again and again, you have had me constructively wrestle with [[Tags|Tagging Theory]] and hierarchy. I don't think I'd have jumped into even the beginner side of the embracing TW as a programmatic tool beyond simple hypertext and markup without your encouragement.

[[Firmcoding]] is still the escape hatch and may still provide performance benefits for the user in the end. I wonder if I continue down this rabbithole if I will eventually let go of the static escape hatch. $:/plugins/bimlas/locator is such a special beast too.

I have a billionty things to build in here, and I'm never sure where I'm supposed to go.

<<<
I can't believe it's almost been a year since I found kicks and you and wrote my first letter. 
<<<

I've been thinking about that lately too. It's been a surreal experience. I geared up to meet people with [[FTO]], and I'm glad you and [[kicks]] were some of the first people I met online over our sites. It feels like what a birthday is supposed to be.

<<<
It is hard coming back to my wiki; it doesn't feel like a second skin any more, but more like a skin that's been shed.
<<<

I'll be interested to know if it is like riding a bicycle for you (assuming that plays any role), and insofar as it is still not a second skin after that, I'd like to know if you will be reaching for another second skin.

<<<
I'm uneasy at the thought of reading some of my own words in the same way that I hate reading papers I've written after they've been written, even after they've been submitted and feedback returned.
<<<

Ugh. =/ I'm sorry. Does that go for both in your private use and public? Critics all around!

I look at a lot of my writing from a long time ago and shake my head. It's painful, cringeworthy, but I'm probably more shamelessly [[naked]] and [[arrogant]], so it doesn't bother me as much. Sometimes I'm able to have a "shit happens, it is what it is" attitude, but, not always. I am not sure how it works out.

It's a semblance of part of the story of your life in this weird medium. I'm grateful for what you share with yourself, me, and others. 

<<<
> I feel your fear (even from your first letter), and imho, it's not just with me.

I haven't done words in a while. In this moment they feel trite and performative and I'm second guessing them, this sentence as I write it now.
<<<

I hope the moment passes. That's not a fun feeling.

Performative is an important word. I do not understand the concept well enough. It's a significant moral problem. I think we at least each perform for our personal selves, and to some [[dok]], we ought. That is part of the act of autonomy in action. Seems like every representation is performative to some [[dok]]; it appears to be conceptually necessary for interacting with [[others]] (including future versions of ourselves, I take it). 

I mean, don't get me wrong, when you choose to poke your elbows out and do a dance, that's fun. You obviously have serious thought too, and it's not obviously for anyone else in a direct fashion. It's not a mere performance to me, but I'm your audience and friend. There is only one way I get to know who I faithfully take to be you: you tell me who you are and keep performing with me in our play. That's online or offline. I have no idea how to make it feel more authentic, genuine, spontaneous, or non-performative.

<<<
I'm afraid this started as a note to you and turned into something all about me and how I'm feeling, when I wanted to convey that I care about you and how things are going - when of course I've checked your wiki and gotten a rough picture of the past few months for you.<<footnote "tv" "and nodded my head in great appreciation of our shared enjoyment of //Russian Dolls//, and something else I can't remember now.">>
<<<

Ha, it's cool. I am interested to know how you are doing and what you're thinking! 

How's CollectScents going? Looks like you're deep into something fun.

I think I like hearing more about the Discworld series than reading them. I'm not very good at turning most kinds of words into pictures though, and I'm spoiled on le TV. I'm looking for moar shows. If you remember, please tell me.
