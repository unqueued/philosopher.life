"""
[10:35 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Hope today is good for you. ^_^
[10:37 AM]  h0p3: I hope the same for you, sir. :slight_smile:
[10:37 AM]  h0p3: How's the GRE and application thing going?
[10:37 AM]  h0p3: and, what are your plans for today?
[10:37 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: In the works! Finally started getting paid again so I can actually do the application. :joy:
[10:38 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Reviewed my deadlines, June 1st IIRC
[10:38 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: GRE, gonna look into it after I do the application.
[10:38 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m gonna work then see some friends later. :)
What are you up to?
[10:41 AM]  h0p3: Ah, yeah, it's important to have that coin for an application. Hopefully, it works out smoothly.
[10:42 AM]  h0p3: It's a pleasure to see your friends so often.
[10:43 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Yeah it’s dumb, but it’s a system I’m already used to. XD Still gonna apply for teaching jobs in a few months too.
[10:44 AM]  h0p3: You have a wonderful lull for a few months before the whirlwind picks up again.
[10:45 AM]  h0p3: I'm working us back into a groove over here. Aiming to avoid games as much as I can. So much to do. Chess has been calling me.
[10:46 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Hahaha. You deserve a break every now and then though. :eyes:
[10:48 AM]  h0p3: I agree, it's important to take breaks. In my experience, I tend not to spend my time wisely enough. I owe a great deal to others. In a world with slaves, I don't have a right to just to do whatever I want to do.
[10:49 AM]  h0p3: Virtue is generally a golden mean between two vices (one of excess, the other of deficiency...e.g. courage is a virtue, recklessness a vice of excess, cowardice a vice of deficiency).
[10:50 AM]  h0p3: My vice is usually that I am excessive in how I fritter my time away on what doesn't really matter in the end.
[10:52 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: That’s fair, I’ve been putting too many hours into Persona. I’m bad with RPGs because monkey brain wants to watch the numbers get higher.
[10:53 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: At least storytelling is pseudo studying for me. :alien:
[10:57 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Writing is going well too though. I’m back to the drawing board but I have a self-Imposed deadline of 12/31 to have a first draft completed this year.
[10:57 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m skipping the short story this year to hit that goal.

[12:13 PM]  h0p3: Hate to ask, but you got me all nervous about the possibility I'm going to have to do the same here soon. How has it gone giving up caffeine, tomatoes, hot sauce, etc?
[12:15 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Hey! I haven’t really given them up but I’ve lowered my intake by a sizable chunk.
[12:15 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I honestly think it’s getting better but I’m also taking prylosac for 14 days in addition to it.
[12:16 PM]  h0p3: Going to ask for all the drugs when I see them.
[12:16 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: What are your symptoms?
[12:16 PM]  h0p3: Mild allergic reactions
[12:17 PM]  h0p3: Lol
[12:18 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Wait... to tomatoes and caffeine?
[12:18 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Do you mean like your throat swelling and stuff? Trouble breathing?
[12:19 PM]  h0p3: Hives on arms and face, dry and irritated skin, mountains of snot (though Mucinex has helped a fuckton), losing a ton of sleep because I can't lay down because if I do, I just cough for hours and hours non-stop (coughing so hard I'm just triggering my gag reflex)
[12:19 PM]  h0p3: yeah, a couple times I've needed my inhaler badly, but can't find it
[12:19 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Omg
[12:19 PM]  h0p3: My body is sore from coughing
[12:20 PM]  h0p3: but, some of the allergy symptoms have passed
[12:20 PM]  h0p3: taking claritin for a couple weeks now
[12:21 PM]  h0p3: It's not the best time to get sick, but not the worst either. It's been a month.
[12:21 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: So right now I’m taking Zyrtec and Singulair for allergies as well as a nasal spray all of which is helping my allergies a ton. The generic prylosac is supposedly going to reduce the stomach acid my stomach produces because the allergy doctor things it might be irritating my throat and making it hard for me to breathe. That’s everything I’m on now. I’m trying to quit the Inhaler for good.
[12:21 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m glad to hear allergies are getting better.
[12:22 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m not sure what you might have. Something super fucking aggressive.
