title: Libertarian Taxation Non-Hypocrisy

I’m struck by the ad hominem argument levied against (Nozickian) Libertarians and Randians (a.k.a. Egoists) that goes something like this:

People who are, by and large, against taxation, are being hypocritical when they choose to benefit from the infrastructure, safety, services, etc. paid for by taxes, and, in virtue of that hypocrisy, they are doing something morally wrong.

The idea is that Libertarians and Randians aren’t living by their own principles. So, if even if we were to assume their own ethical positions, they would fail to be moral through the inconsistency between their behavior and belief. Mind you, ad hominem arguments, despite what you may have been told in your logic classes, can actually be acceptable in ethics (when used correctly). I take seriously the above argument – we should not brush it aside. It seems reasonable to me that being hypocritical may be immoral, particularly about something as significant as this.

First, it seems obvious to me that if egoism/Randian objectivism, which is primarily and perhaps exclusively concerned with maximizing one’s personal utility, is true (and somehow survived the many powerful criticisms of it), that choosing to benefit yourself in any possible way is morally justified. Seriously. Anything goes; fuck everyone else. Ayn Rand wasn’t being hypocritical by taking government aid for health care; she was doing as any proper egoist would do: maximizing her personal utility. She might have been wrong to think her theory is actually the true moral law (let’s face it, she was), she might have been a terrible, immoral person when assessed from the true moral law (let’s face it, she was), but on this point, she was not a hypocrite. If she wasn’t a hypocrite, then it isn’t clear that from within her own moral framework (even if it is false), that she was being inconsistent or immoral.

As to Libertarians, the issue becomes much cloudier. Libertarianism is a deontic property theory which seeks to maintain (and rectify violations of) legitimate acquisition and transfer of property rights. It is surprisingly powerful and complete enough (in some sense) that it can serve as a framework for explaining human rights entirely in terms of property rights.

Libertarians come in many flavors. The most common flavor, at least in the major political arena, is the minimal statist view, which allows for a state to prevent theft. Minimal states may tax for the sake of preventing theft, but nothing else. Theft, in all flavors of Libertarianism, is a term which is broader, richer, and more robust than how we use the term in everyday life. So, this prevention is no small or insignificant task. Beyond this minimal taxation, any further taxation is in itself viewed as the government stealing from those who are taxed. Beyond legislating against over-taxation, the thefts which have already taken place must be rectified. This rectification is the tricky spot.

Let us say a minimal statist Libertarian was taxed $1 million, only $10k of which was necessary for the minimal state (flat or scaling taxation issues aside), and the remaining $990k would be considered “stolen” on the Libertarian’s view. It seems to me that when this Libertarian uses the government’s infrastructure, services, etc., he is recuperating some measure of his stolen money. Let’s say he recoups $100k in goods/services (pretend it was price adjusted to some sort of free market).  This rectification surely isn’t fair (on the Libertarian’s view), he isn’t getting  the full $990k in goods/services, he probably prefers money to these goods/services, and he is probably owed interest on that $990k. It remains clear to me, however, that the Libertarian is seeking rectification, and is not being hypocritical.

Take the same situation, only the Libertarian was taxed $30k, $10k of which was necessary for the minimal state, and he recoups $100k in goods/services. My intuition is that he’s going past his rectification right, taking far more than he should. Who is he taking this money from? Other citizens (present overpayers and/or future debtors), of course. It seems to me that the Libertarian is stealing, on his own view, in this case. This does seem to be a case of hypocrisy and immorality from within the Libertarian view.

Of course, the exact amounts which people are taxed, how much is required for the minimal state, and how much people recoup is not a completely solved empirical matter. We at least have a theoretical way to understand the problem, however, even if we don’t yet know how many Libertarians are seeking justice and how many are being hypocritical and immoral.

I submit that most Libertarians (many tea-baggers, for example) are receiving far more benefits than they pay for in taxes. Insofar as they benefit beyond their taxation, I take them to be hypocrites, inconsistent with their own views, and doing something immoral.

I fear that most Libertarians are merely ill-disguised egoists. They are not people who actually care about your rights and other peoples’ rights. They care about themselves, end of story. They should own up to that ugly fact. The problem, of course, is the Egoism, unlike Libertarianism, is far less defensible. Egoism is clearly wrong to sane people. I think Libertarians want to be egoists, but not have to own up to such insanity.
