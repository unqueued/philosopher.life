title: 2017.06.28 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Vivid dreams, woke up off and on for an hour before the alarm.
* I got the kids up and started. Asked them to work on their wikis first. 
* I worked hard. I'm still coordinating. That's what I'll be doing for the next couple weeks, I think,
* I hit the mechanic up. I'll go again tomorrow.
* I came home and worked more.
** I spent time getting my tool situation ironed out somewhat.
* Motivated le chilluns.
* Fireman time.
* Got a snack, woot!
* Watched some LCS, surfed, and wrote the wiki.
* I went the library with my wife. We also went to Harbor Freight to pickup some gloves, and to Wal-Mart for beer (for our weekend) and pie for our "Tao day."
* Inform the men!
* We made tacos for dinner, and we watched an episode of GoT.
* The kids finished off the last of their chores and work for the day. We informed them that they had the next 5 days off. Yay!
* I talked to my friend ALM and my brother JRE over chat. 
* I worked on DND characters.
* Pigged out and finished Rick and Morty.
