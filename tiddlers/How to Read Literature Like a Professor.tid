title: How to Read Literature Like a Professor

//Even if it isn't new, I have to learn how to do it better. Reading is for everyone, not just professionals. Still, I have plenty to learn from professionals.//

!! Chapter 1: The Quest

# quester
# destination
# stated purpose
# challenges that must be faced during on the path to the destination
# a reason for the quester to go to the destination

The motivation for the quest is implicit. The stated reason for going on the journey is never the real reason for going. The real reason for any quest: self-knowledge


!! Chapter 2: Acts of Communion: 

# sharing and peace
# not always holy
# personal activity/shared experience
# indicates how characters are getting along
# communion enables characters to overcome some kind of internal obstacle

Communion scenes often force/enable reader to empathize with character(s). We all eat to live, and we all die.


!! Chapter 3: Vampirism

# older figure violates younger
# vampire leaves mark on the victim
# vampire steals innocence
# sexual allure
# older figure is corrupt, with outdated values
# victim is stripped of youth, energy, and virtue
# the old vampire’s life-force continues
# the death/destruction of the young victim

Vampires are always about something other than themselves demonstrated through exploitation. We are attracted to danger.


!! Chapter 4: Sonnets

# 14 lines
# iambic pentameter
# lines have 10 syllables
# ten syllables long is about as high as fourteen lines in length
# two sections, two units of meaning
# there is always a shift between the two units
# arranged in lines, written in sentences
;
* Petrarchan/Italian Sonnet details:
*# First stanza has eight lines and another stanza of six lines
*# Rhyme scheme unifies first eight lines and another rhyme scheme unifies the last six lines
*# First eight lines have relate to one idea, last six lines relate to another idea
;
* Shakespearean/English Sonnet details:
*# First stanza has four lines, second stanza has four lines, third stanza has four lines, last two lines are a couplet
*# First three stanzas have their own rhyme schemes and the last couplet has its own

Always pay attention to the shape of a poem. The shape indicates the divisions in subject matter and shifts (mood, tone, setting, etc.).


!! Chapter 5: Patterns

Be aware of patterns, archetypes, recurrences. You have to look for them. There’s no such thing as a truly original work of literature. Eeverything contains elements from somewhere else. All writing builds on what has come before authors play on a reader’s knowledge of history, culture and literature; they expect the reader to make subconscious connections. 


!! Chapter 6: Shakespeare

Every writer reinvents Shakespeare in some way. Intertextuality, and the ability to identify it, is key. Good writers cause us to question what we think we already know (as Shakespeare often does). 


!! Chapter 7: Biblical Allusions

* garden
* serpent
* plague
* floodparting of waters
* loaves
* fishes
* forty days
* betrayal
* denial
* slavery and escape
* fatted calves
* milk and honey
* tongues
* voices from whirlwinds
* Apocalypse
* four horsemen fall from grace/loss of innocence
* circle of life
* the Prodigal Son
* tension between brothers
* etc.


!! Chapter 8: Situational Archetypes/Patterns

All literature comes from other literature. It's easy place to spot archetypes in children’s stories.

Metonymy is a part is used to stand for the whole.

Common situational archetypes (as found in fairy tales):

# Lost, young couple
# Crisis not of their own making
# Temptation
# Youngsters must fend for themselves


!! Chapter 9: Greek Mythology

Common types of myths:

# Shakespearean
# Biblical
# Folk/Fairy Tales

Myth is the shaping and sustaining power of a story and its symbols, including our ability explain ourselves. Myths are ingrained our cultural memory that they both shape our culture and are shaped by it. 

# How does the base myth function in a literary context (what does it contribute to the story/writing of the story?)
# How does the use of the myth inform a story/poem?
# How is the myth perceived by the reader?
;
* Fall of Icarus, a youngster who failed to listen to his parent and died as a result
*# Parental attempt to save the child
*# Failure of the attempt and the resulting grief
*# Cure that proves as deadly as the disease
*# Youthful exuberance leads to self-destruction
*# The clash between sober, adult wisdom and childhood’s recklessness
*# Terror
;
* In situational archetypes, characters’ nobility and courage are tested
*# The need to protect one’s family
*# The need to maintain one’s dignity
*# The determination to remain faithful
*# The struggle to return home


!! Chapter 10: Setting & Weather

Setting establishes mood and foreshadows events to come. Pathetic fallacy. Ask yourself why the weather is what it is in the story. Weather is a signal of atmosphere and mood. Whenever you read, analyze the weather- how does it impact the story and what does it lend that couldn’t be otherwise deciphered?

* Rain's functionality and symbolism
*# plot device for trapping characters together or forcing them apart
*# atmosphere can be mysterious, murky, isolating
*# an equalizer which falls on the just and unjust
*# cleansing
*# transforming
*# restorative
*# fertility
*# agent of new life and restoration
*# source of illness and death 
*# replenishment
*# rain connects directly to Spring


!! Chapter 11: Violence

Violence is a personal, intimate act (fuck yeah).

* Functions of violence
*# symbolic
*# thematic
*# Biblical
*# Shakespearean
*# Romantic
*# allegorical
*# transcendent

* Symbolism of violence
*# Violence is metaphorical
*# Violence may signal that death lurks in every day tasks
*# Violence illustrates the hostile relationship we have with the universe
*# We ultimately face our mortality alone

* Types of violence
*# specific injury that authors cause characters to do to themselves or one another
*# narrative violence (i.e. authorial violence) causes general harm to characters
*#* Generally, authorial violence is the death and/or general suffering that authors inject into their work in order to advance the plot or develop a theme. The characters do nothing to cause/spur the violence.

* Why do authors kill characters?
*# spur action
*# cause plot complications
*# end plot complications
*# trigger stress in other characters

* Questions to ask while reading about a violence
*# What does this misfortune accomplish thematically?
*# What famous or mythic death does this one resemble?
*# Why was this particular type of violence used instead of another? 
*# Some aspects to consider before answering:
*## psychological dilemmas
*## spiritual crises
*## historical concerns
*## social concerns
*## political concerns


!! Chapter 12: Symbolism

Everything is a symbol.

# What does it mean?
# What does it stand for?
# What is the writer doing with this image/object/act?
# What possibilities are suggested by the movement of the narrative?
# What does the object/image/act feel like it’s doing? 

Symbolism isn’t universal. You will see various elements from your own unique perspective. You must be able to support your interpretations with the text. 

An allegory uses different elements to represent different things. In other words, whereas symbolism usually has one thing representing some idea, an allegory is comprised of a series of symbols that individually represent various ideas. Allegories always strive to convey one particular message. Allegories are usually easier to decipher than symbols because all readers are supposed to interpret allegories the same way. 

* Steps to decoding symbols
*# consider our past (allusions)
*# consider the author’s particular use of the item (meaning)
*# consider any possible ironic elements
*# reach a conclusion that builds on the first three steps
;
* Caves as symbols
*# connection to humanity’s most primitive elements
*# security and shelter
*# getting in touch with deepest levels of consciousness
*# the idea that all experiences are individualized rather than generalized (everyone experiences caves somewhat differently)
*# force us into contact with our deepest fears
*# death
*# the great Void
;
* Rivers as symbols
*# death
*# escape
*# danger
*# safety
*# path to maturity
*# division
*# connection
*# corruption of modern life
*# collapse of Western civilization 


!! Chapter 13: Political Angles

A parable intends to change the reader and through the reader, to change society. Political writing “can be one-dimensional, simplistic, reductionist, preachy, dull.” Political writing addresses the realities in its world, including human problems (both social and political), and expresses the rights of humanity and the wrongs of those in control (power).

Steps to understanding the political angles:

# understand context of story (social, political)
# understand author’s background
# understand author’s goal
# understand how the work engages with its specific time period


!! Chapter 14: Archetypes/Christ Figure

All works are influenced by its dominant cultural religious beliefs (whether the author believes in them or not). Values and principles of the dominant religion will inform the literary work itself. 

Christ archetypal qualities:

# crucifixion
# agony
# good with children
# self-sacrificing
# loaves, fishes, water, wine
# 33 years old
# carpentry
# very basic modes of transportation 
# walking on water
# outstretched arms
# time alone in the wilderness
# tempted by the devil
# in the company of thieves
# creator of parables/aphorisms
# arose from the dead on the third day
# disciples (notably 12, of varying degrees of devotion)
# forgiving
# came to save an undeserving world
# unmarried and/or celibate (though not historically necessary)
# wounded/marked in hands, feet, side
# a crown of thorns
# sacrifices self in some way for others (not necessarily voluntarily)

Themes associated with Christ figures:

# triumph over adversity
# value of hope and faith
# attainment of grace

Why do writers use Christ-figures?

# to make a point
# to deepen our sense of sacrifice
# relates to hope
# relates to redemption
# relates to miracles
# to make a character look smaller (to be used in an ironic way)


!! Chapter 15: Flight

If you drop a person and a bowling ball off the top of the Tower of Pisa, both will hit the ground at the same time. If someone can fly, he/she is a superhero, a ski jumper, insane, a work of fiction, a circus act, suspended on wires, an angel, heavily symbolic. Interrupted flight always signifies something negative. Falling and surviving is as symbolic as the flight itself. 

Major flight archetypes in literature:

# Daedalus & Icarus
#* Daedalus flew too close to the sun and plummeted into the ocean
# flying Africans
#* Africans flew out of Africa and when they were dropped, they were dropped into slavery
# Aztecs
#* Quetzalcoatl was a god with the body of a snake and feathered wings
# Christians
#* Christ was tempted by flight

What does flight symbolize?

# Freedom
# Escape
# Return home
# A thriving spirit
# LoveFlight IS freedom

Things to consider when character survives a “flight”:

# What does it mean to survive certain death?
# How much does survival alter one’s relationship to the world?
# Do the characters’ responsibilities to themselves or to life change?
# Is the survivor the same as she/he was before the fall?


!! Chapter 16: Sex

Freud established a number of symbolic representations of sexuality based on the sexual leanings of the subconscious.  

# tall buildings = male sexuality
# rolling landscapes = female sexuality
# stairs = sexual intercourse
# falling down stairs = rape, loss of virility, loss of erection

Sexual symbols

# penis = lance, keys, swords, gun
# vagina = chalice/holy grail, lock, bowl
# sexual intercourse = waves, trains entering tunnels, wrestling

In older literature, sex is usually hidden in metaphors but if you examine the language and rhythm carefully, you can discern what is really happening. The search for the Holy Grail: crops are failing, drought, livestock and people are dying, kingdom is becoming a wasteland and fertility must be restored. How? Send a knight with his big lance to seek out the fertile chalice.


!! Chapter 17: Sex that isn’t Sex

Describing sex acts in a literal sense is wholly unrewarding so most writers opt to cloak sex in symbolism and/or metaphors. They talk about sex by not talking about sex. When writers write about sex, they’re really writing about something else.

# freedom
# individuality
# espionage
# personal sacrifice
# psychological neediness
# desire for power
# fulfillment
# liberation
# failure of liberation
# religious subversion
# artistic subversion
# political subversion
# self-expression
# exertion of control
# birth
# pleasure
# sacrifice
# submission
# resignation
# supplication
# domination
# enlightenment


!! Chapter 18: Baptism

Possible reasons for drowning:

# wish fulfillment
# exorcism of primal fear
# exploration of the possible 
# handy solution to messy plot trouble
# control

Meaning of water rescues:

# passivity
# good fortune
# indebtedness
# luck
# serendipity
# rebirth

Baptism, when someone goes into the water and comes out alive, symbolizes: 

# rebirth
# pain
# charge
# religious association
# death (not literal)

Baptism as device:

# revelation
# thematic development of violence
# thematic development of failure
# thematic development of guilt
# plot complication
# plot denouement


!! Chapter 19: Geography/Setting

Questions to ask about setting:

# What does it mean to the novel that its landscape is high or low, flat or sunken, steep or shallow?
# Why did this character die where he/she did?
# Why is this piece set where it is?
# Why does the author use specific geographic settings so often?
# What does geography mean to a work of a literature?

What should be considered while analyzing the geography of a story?

# rivers
# hills
# valleys
# buttes
# steppes
# glaciers
# swamps
# mountains
# prairies
# chasms
# seas
# islands
# people
# economics
# politics
# history
# attitude
# psychology
# finance
# industry

Geography also takes theme, symbolism, and plot into account. Geography/setting can foreshadow, set the mood and tone of the piece, develop characters. Environment and a character’s response to the environment serve as characterization. Geography must impact behavior in some way. Generally, when authors send their characters south, it’s so they can “run amok”. Often, they engage in these behaviors because they are having raw, direct encounters with the subconscious. 

* Low areas:
*# swamps
*# crowds
*# fog
*# darkness
*# fields
*# heat
*# unpleasantness
*# people

* High areas:
*# snow
*# ice
*# purity
*# thin air
*# clear views
*# isolation


!! Chapter 20: Seasons

Scansion: how the stressed and unstressed syllables function in lines of poetry. 

# Spring = Childhood, youth, freshness, directness, openness, naiveté, flirtation
# Summer = Adulthood, romance, fulfillment, passion
# Fall = Middle age, decline, tiredness, harvest, exhaustion, reflective, benefitting only from our efforts
# Winter = Old age, resentment, death, anger, hatred, cynicism, worldly, emotionally reserved, totally dependent on the opinion of others


!! Chapter 21: Markings

Physical qualities, shapes, always tell us something about characters. In literature, physical deformities mean something thematically, metaphorically, psychologically or spiritually. In Shakespeare’s works, physical deformity indicated moral deformity. Deformity is difference, a projection of the perils of man seeking to play God which will ultimately consume the power seeker. In folktales or mythology, the hero is always marked in some way. The marking sets him/her apart from everyone else. Often, the deformity is metaphorical. Blindness, for example. Injury: symbolic of the destruction of possibilities, spiritual and physical. Scarred characters may reflect the imperfections of the reader.


!! Chapter 22: Blindness

Blindness is a physical representation of a metaphorical blindness to circumstance/ An author includes blindness in order to emphasize other levels of sight and blindness (other than physical). Why is the character blind? What does it represent? What does it foreshadow?When literal blindness, sight, darkness and light are introduced into a story, it is usually an indication that metaphorical sight and blindness are at work.


!! Chapter 23: Heart Disease

The heart is the symbolic vessel of emotion. Heart trouble indicates emotional burdens.

General meanings of heart disease

# bad love
# loneliness
# cruelty
# pederasty
# disloyalty
# cowardice
# lack of determination
# pain
# suffering
# regret
# something amiss at the center of things

Symbolism of the heart

# loyalty
# trust
# courage
# fidelity
# honesty


!! Chapter 24: Illness

Illness is a reflection of some emotional/psychological weakness. Physical paralysis, emotional paralysis, moral paralysis, social paralysis, spiritual paralysis, intellectual paralysis, political paralysis

General rules:

# Not all diseases are equal. 
#* Authors tend to choose diseases that aren’t ugly unless that ugliness is part of the message
# Diseases should be picturesque.
#* Authors often make use of diseases that give their sufferers an ethereal quality
# Diseases must have strong symbolic or metaphorical possibilities. 
#* The type of disease has to speak to the theme or character of the work
;
# Tuberculosis: chosen because many authors suffered from the disease themselves or watched friends deteriorate, wasting disease
# The Plague: widespread societal devastationMalaria: bad air signifying malicious gossip, hostile opinion, feverish decisions, overheated state that leads to poor decision making
# Smallpox: sign of divine judgment against vanity and/or marital lapse (in certain plots)
# AIDS: lies dormant and turns every victim into an unknowing carrier, high mortality rate, disproportionately appears in younger people, devastated people in developing countries, gay community was initially hardest hit, became a symbol of tragedy, despair, courage, resilience, compassion, political angle, religious angle.
# Fever: represents the randomness of fate, the harshness of life, the unknowability of God
# Venereal disease was hidden in other illnesses: signified bad behavior, intergenerational tensions, irresponsibility, misdeeds

Issues addressed through illness in literature:

# how a person confronts the devastation of illness
# the isolation caused by the disease
# the uncertainty caused by the disease
# the random nature of infection
# the despair faced by the physician/loved ones/patients in the face of an unstoppable illness
# the desire to act to cure the illness even when one recognizes the futility


!! Chapter 25: Put it in Context

A reader must know the historical/political/social context of the piece in order to understand all of the levels of meaning. A reader must not add interpretative data that wasn’t available when the piece was written or the interpretation will be flawed. Read with perspective that matches the historical context. Understand the social, historical, cultural, personal backgroundsDeconstruction

# [[Question Everything]] in the work
# demonstrate that the work is controlled and reduced by the values/prejudices of its time rather than by the author
# Focus on what the writer is focused on
# Adopt the writer’s perspective in order to understand his/her point but do not abandon your own perspective completely
# Readers must adopt the worldview the work assumes of its audience or we will misinterpret themes, ideas, plot points


!! Chapter 26: Irony

Irony occurs when something other than what is expected occurs. It isn’t a “surprise” but a way an author can turn expectations upside down in order to make a point. Irony forces our expectations to work against us. Irony trumps everything else. When irony is used, the other rules don’t applyIrony is a deflection from the readers’ expectations.

# Ironic mode: characters struggle futilely with forces that the reader might be able to overcome. The characters are not our equals.
# Rain’s literary cycle: rain-> life -> birth -> promise -> restoration -> fertility -> continuity.
# Observe characters who have a lower degree of autonomy, self-determination or free will than ourselves because these characters usually end up at the heart of the lesson
# eiron: in Greek comedy, the character who seems weak, subservient, ignorant
# alazon: in Greek comedy, the character who seems pompous, arrogant, clueless

In ironic pieces, the reader has a sort dual awareness stemming from the dislocation between what we expect and what actually exists in the work. Irony doesn’t work for everyone; not everyone understands the irony.
