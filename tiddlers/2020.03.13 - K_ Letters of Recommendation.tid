"""
[1:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Hey [[h0p3]]! Hope you’re doing well today. :slight_smile:
[1:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’ve reached out for letters of recommendation and getting clarification on testing so I’m getting a lot done today
[1:49 PM] h0p3: Doing well. Taught [[1uxb0x]] to cut hair and shave. He didn't cut me once, lol.
[1:50 PM] h0p3: I'm glad that it's been productive for you.
[1:50 PM] h0p3: You guys have any date plans or things you are doing around Louisville?
[1:52 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Nice! RIP to your glorious beard.
[1:53 PM] Ardent_Assailant: We discovered a reservoir park on Monday and walked around. It was fun. Did a lot of errands about town too. Today is our relaxation day before we go out of town tomorrow.
[1:53 PM] Ardent_Assailant: We are having a blast though. :slight_smile:
[1:53 PM] h0p3: Good. :slight_smile:

[1:18 PM] h0p3: You guys still enjoying your trip?
[1:29 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Very much so. Ohio is pretty good right now tbh. Of course we’re trying to minimize time in public
[1:29 PM] Ardent_Assailant: How are you all doing?
[1:29 PM] h0p3: Doing well. Chugging along in our work.
[1:30 PM] h0p3: I hope you get a lot of bonding and planning time in.
[1:30 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Oh that reminds me. I got my letters of recommendation all lined up! Got the last confirmation yesterday so I’m stoked about that.
[1:30 PM] h0p3: Congratulations, sir. That is fantastic.
[1:30 PM] h0p3: I am super excited for you to dive in.
[1:43 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Me too. It’s going to be a great chapter. :slight_smile:
[1:43 PM] Ardent_Assailant: How are you doing health-wise?
[1:44 PM] h0p3: I'm fine. Knee hurts, and ointment isn't working. PT if it doesn't work, apparently.
[1:44 PM] h0p3: Neck is better, and I can breathe. Flonase did most of the heavy lifting, I think, for my allergies.
[1:44 PM] h0p3: How about you?
[1:45 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Numbness is improving. Still feels off down there but I’m slowly getting back to some sense of normal. Other than that I’m fine.
[1:45 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Nasal spray is so good.
[1:46 PM] h0p3: I'm glad to hear that is stabilizing.
[1:50 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Me too. :joy:
[1:50 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’m tired of having persistent health issues.
