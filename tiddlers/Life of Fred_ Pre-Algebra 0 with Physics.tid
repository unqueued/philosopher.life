title: Life of Fred: Pre-Algebra 0 with Physics

We dove into this book. It's a lot more fun than the previous two in some ways. We move glacially through the Pre-Algebra concepts, but we keep running into real examples of math in the world. We have our minds taken off of math to focus on some other discipline. This is but a feint, as we are carefully taught math in that slow, beautifully insidious way. You will accidentally pick up on the math while learning physics because you had to. 

I see some genius to this style. I knew that was what it was before I started, but the phenomenology of it is just different. I hope it is the fundamental bridge from arithmetic to algebra that we need. I had one of the shittier bridges you can get. I hope this lays the foundation for success for my children.

My daughter hasn't missed a single math problem in the book (although, the physics definitions/concepts problems can be wrong). My son has a 90% success rate on the math problems. That is significantly better than the previous two books. They've slowed the math down, and it's just about applying it and making it come alive. 

I was worried this was going to be the hardest part. It has turned out to be easier than the pure mathematics books.

Even with their flaws, these books are brilliant.

60 pages a day is what we average. That's 300 pages a week. There are ~1960 of content left, and if we kept that pace up, we'd need about 7 weeks more solid work to cover it. That's 2 months at the pace we are going. I now see I may not have time to realize the dream. 

I glanced through the back of the highschool books. Each has a super-condensed concept and explanation list for the entire book, called an ART section. It is well done! It basically reduces all major ideas into a beautiful intro/refresher outline. When we finish this pre-algebra book, I'm going to walk them through all of these first. I give them a first peak, and then we push through the books. I very much want to see them push through Khan academy for mechanical mastery after this. Afterwards, we should give mathematics a break or put it on idle-30 minutes a day mode. Our next big push will we redo our symbolic logic, perhaps getting a taste for mathematical logic. Then they will go through the series for deeper understanding and crystallization. I would love to find another profound tool to round it out.

I feel proud of my ignorance in a sad and weird way. I'm glad to see my children not only learning things before I did, but learning what I do not know. I can only hope to give them to tools to talk to me.

The Physics book is finished. The geometry supplies are ordered.
