there’s no point hunting down the inner person, the humanity behind a mask—it’s all the mask. I truly believe this—maybe our greatest power is in this. The truth is in that mask, it’s what you are projecting.

`_______________________________________________________` This has been a long and hard read for me, and I really appreciate it. I have no idea how I would have tackled this topic in the past, but I would be happy to know that I was able to explain why I think I think what I think and feel about this topic. And again—I really appreciate the time and effort it took me to get this out—it took me some time to find the words and make them fit together. As usual, I really enjoyed reading your responses, and I hope you have a wonderful day.
