title: Cypher's Choice

//What's the difference between ignorance and apathy? I don't know and I don't care.//

Phrasing reminds me of //Sophie's Choice//

Trying to enter back into the experience machine, becoming once again blissfully ignorant of the problem of meaning, freedom, external world problematics, etc.
