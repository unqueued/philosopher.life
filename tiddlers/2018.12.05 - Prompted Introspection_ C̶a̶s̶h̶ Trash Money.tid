title: 2018.12.05 - Prompted Introspection: C̶a̶s̶h̶ Trash Money

!! What if trash became more valuable than money?

Yeah, I remember this one: [[2018.01.15 - Prompted Introspection Log: Trash Money]]. Let me meme this one: "when everything is money, nothing is money."

There'd be a lot of money floating in the oceans. Those who own dumps and hoarders would be instantly wealthy. I am also reminded of "the last shall be first, and the first shall be last" mentality here.

In reality, this is a radical shift in the desires and beliefs of all money-using creatures on the planet. Note, even the other primates use money, and I would argue that money may be used (even without an explicit notion of it) in a very wide variety of social interactions beyond the higher animals. Of course, I'm willing to push the limits of the concept of money to absurd lengths as well, so this question's circumstances turn out to be hard to even conceive for me.
