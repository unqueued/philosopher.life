Fantastic. That is a good idea.

It's good to have a variety of representations of homes and living in them.

Itâ€™s a heating pad covering a wire basket
Fri 7:05pm
Yup.
Fri 7:06pm
With towels for insulationâ€”not a regular heating pad but one made for an outdoor cat house
Fri 7:06pm
Looks comfy

[[UJ]]â€™s alarm clock has an outdoor weather monitor so I put the outside part in their house so we can monitor the temp
Fri 7:07pm
Neat.
Fri 7:07pm
They will self regulate though â€”in when theyâ€™re cold and out when they are warm
Fri 7:07pm
I don't know when we officially get to speak of someone as a farmer, but I think you're a farmer in a way. It's cool. I appreciate the self-sufficiency and care given.

Dope
Fri 7:13pm
I like the deep litter idea and roosts

There donâ€™t need to be a nest for every hen â€”they sleep on bars like a parrot
