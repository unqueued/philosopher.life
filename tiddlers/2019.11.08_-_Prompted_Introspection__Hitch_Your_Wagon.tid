title: 2019.11.08 - Prompted Introspection: Hitch Your Wagon

!! What do we mean when we say, "Hitch your wagon to a star"?

I don't remember hearing this phrase before. It seems very much like "shoot for the stars," but the hitching may imply something else here. Perhaps it's about imitating, surrounding yourself with, or working alongside someone who has star-like qualities in a given practice. I'll agree that learning from a virtuous agent is critical. I'm always in need of good teachers. Unfortunately, this could also just backfire, and perhaps it could even be exploitative.
