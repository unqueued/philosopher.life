title: 2018.08.18 - Deep Reading: Introducing Anthropology

I love how it covers some of the standard philosophical paradigms. I'm having a very hard time peeling this out of history and philosophy, but I suppose I should. This is fast and furiously paced, and I love it. This series appears to be a dot connector.

The kids need to go through this book.
