title: Wiki: Other Frameworks and Paradigms to Consider

* Utilitarianism
** Diminishing Marginal Utility

* The Unix guru philosophers of yore offer us this wisdom
** Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
** Write programs to work together.
** Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

* Other famous programming principles and dictums:
** DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
*** Write code designed to be reused (corollary of DRY).
*** Rule of Three (a pragmatically weakened rule-of-thumb variant of DRY for refactoring). Code can be copied once, but when the same code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.
** If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

* The Bayesians have much to say.
** Subjective Logic: https://folk.uio.no/josang/sl/

* The Less-Wrongers, Positive Disintegrationists, Meaningnessists, Nihilists, Socialists, Redpillers, Daoists, and other Metamoderns also have much to say.

* When all else fails, carefully consider the wisdom of the crowds, but turn up the signal-to-noise ratio as high as you can by curiously curating (be intellectually honest).
