[[My posts|https://www.reddit.com/r/FamiliesYouChoose/comments/cbnbpv/33yo_american_madman_pseudonymous_wiki_penpal/]] don't last long on [[Reddit]]. I'll be [[openly drafting my letter to you|https://philosopher.life/#2019.07.13%20-%204GAA%3A%20A%20Letter]]; you'll see the <<tag [[Draft]]>>tag eventually lifted. [[Contact]] me however you please. 

It's awesome to hear back from you. I hope we get to be long-term penpals.

I tend to quote and reply to everything (perhaps annoyingly), and I ask you to pick out the [[salient]] threads. Ignore what you know is irrelevant, please. I am not skilled in the art of conversation, so you'll have to guide me.

<<<
You read me scarily accurate for a stranger...but I may surprise you yet.
<<<

I would be surprised if you didn't surprise me. I do not mean to imply there isn't a great deal beneath the surface. There's an asymmetry in how quickly I can get to know you. I can only follow the breadcrumbs you generously leave for me. My vision is often blurry or blind.<<ref "c">> 

<<<
I too am wholy errant-an anachronism at times, chameleon at others-naked, vulnerable and fierce all the same.
<<<

I hope to get to know you. I'm not always the quickest crayon in the box, so you'll have to help this autist understand what may be obvious to others; I am mindblind too often. I'm curious why you think you are an anachronism at times. That's an interesting label. Fierceness and vulnerability go together well. 

Why are you chameleon-like, and in what contexts? I am forced to do the same sometimes. It is not my preference. Some enjoy it more than I do.

I simply do not know the story of the stories of you well enough, nor can I know them all the way down.<<ref "t">> I straddle a difficult fence in identifying and identifying with [[others]]. I have no other option but to model people, to label them, to pigeon-hole them, and, of course, I must be open to being wrong. It is much like any philosophical pursuit. I tend to think I lay down tentpegs in the desert, but I must be willing to nomadically move my tent when necessary. All models are axiomatic rules, translations, and inferential systems; even our emotions are non-trivially codified computations.<<ref "a">>

<<<
I'm trying to shed the nihilism and cynicism I picked up along the way dealing with severe and chronic pain. Good news: I'm slowly improving. Very slowly.
<<<

I can see you've been climbing out of a pit.<<ref "m">> If and when you are up to it, I would like to know the causes of your chronic pain. I likely don't have enough experience to understand it correctly. 

I am worried I may be the wrong man to speak with. It is important that I do not hinder your improvement. The problem of evil, particularly unnecessary or unjustified suffering, plagues my mind. My worldview is unpleasant to the point many will not stare at what I see for very long. [[ridtyawtr]].

<<<
It's robbed me of so much, I'm trying to reclaim what I can. I used to be an unstoppable dynamo-now I hardly recognize my pathetic self. But I'm trying to focus on //slowly// improving. Had to fight withdrawal and isolation, bursting from a suffocating guilt over my wasted potential and having failed mine. //Slowly//

Now I'm swimming in a pool of ennui, listlessness and anhedonia.**

...

Ps: **Taking suggestions on how to help ennui and anhedonia.
<<<

Ugh. =( You turn my stomach inside-out. The robbed sense is terrifying to me. That is difficult to wrestle with for me; there are zones in which I am not a forgiving person, even to myself. If it matters, you do not seem pathetic to me. I cannot gauge your potential from here; perhaps you are a harsh self-critic at times (a topic I have very mixed feelings about). It sounds like it's been a helluva of a transition. 

Even though I experience it a great deal, I am not absurdly knowledgable about the various [[dok]] of existential anxiety and depression. I'm also arrogant (or arrogant appearing) enough to be fairly skeptical of those who claim to be experts in the matter.<<ref "eg">> Perhaps, to some extent, depressive realism may require your consideration (a controversial issue when we look at human eudaimonia and justification). From what I can see, you already know all my suggestions, and I suspect you are wiser in your pursuit of mental health than I am. 

My suggestions, which I am convinced you already know (even if not by these [[name]]s): [[Stoicism-fu]], significant exercise, maintaining deep and accountable relationships (it sounds like your husband is your rock; my [[wife|k0sh3k]] is mine), dieting, and coming to grips with the difference between who you were (or thought you were) and who you think you will be with a reconstructive [[Positive Disintegration]]ist mindset.

I am a hypocrite for offering you this cliche advice. I beg you take it with a mountain of salt; I am so clearly not a mentally stable human. Learning how to trust oneself, rebuilding, and searching for meaning are not problems I have solved to my own satisfaction, though I have come a long way in the past few years. This wiki is a profound sign of my brokenness and zeal. Writing helps me reason about and interpret myself and the world with evidence; efficient modeling is one of my weaknesses. 

<<<
Which really blows for an empath, human connection was my code, my god.
<<<

Forgive me for being pedantic or assumptive. While you may have been burned alive, I have a hard time believing human connection still isn't your code. It looks written into you, but maybe I have no right to make that claim.<<ref "y">>

I will agree that empathy is not sufficient (though it is necessary); there is an [[irwartfrr]] to it in applying [[The Golden Rule]]. For much of my life I was a pacifist. Much has changed for me. [[T42T]] requires forgiving retaliation.

<<<
The most important aspect that's been unscathed by all this is my sacred bond music, like you with your codes and links and root(s). I sing, I dance it, I compose it, I play instruments badly, it's my intoxicant, companion and my salvation.
<<<

What music resonates most with you? Has it changed for you over time, and how so? 

I'm heavily dependent on [[listening to music|Music: Library]]. I used to play [[music]], and still do once in a while; I usually only do so when I'm really feeling down. I think there's something constructive about making [[beauty]] in the world, including through music, which can't be replaced (though I do not claim it maintains the highest moral priority in all contexts). I have found many who strongly disagree with me on the nature of music (including my [[son|1uxb0x]]); I do not mean to step on your toes. Intoxicant is on the money for me.

Do you get to play music with [[others]]? 

This is going to sound a bit crazy, but I keep running into more and more people who aren't into music anymore. Is it a sign of the times? Does it happen with age? Am I just noticing patterns which aren't really there?

<<<
As far as for who YOU are, of course your voluminous wiki is 100% a faÃ§ade in the sense that you've curated every entry, every word, the aesthetic, the diction and prose. The images and colors.

They are all a performance, like our outfits and mannerisms. We are presenting ourselves as characters to the world.
<<<

Who does this not apply to? I agree there is more effort put into this object than most [[self-representations|PSM]]. [[IATVMOASRM]].

Most people I speak with have a significant disagreement with me about the limits of representation. Others have a political problem with it. I tend to think words go a very long way (the furthest of any medium). I run into this issue again and again with almost everyone I meet; few believe there is faith in what appears to be such cold codification at times.

Do you mean to say it is all //mere// performance? What does sincerity and trust look like and mean to you?

<<<
What you're not including is how similar to the rest of us you are. You too fart and ache like us.
<<<

Oh, I'm [[fff]], flesh and blood, farts and tears like everyone. You may even find me gross in the end (I think most people do). I'm disturbingly honest and celebratory about my farts.<<ref "l">> Let me pull the unholy ghost of my ego out of my ass with some examples for you:

* [[2017.05.03 - Wiki Review Log]]
* [[2018.04.22 - Family Log]]
* [[2019.01.28 - Afterschool Teaching: Monday]]
* [[2019.04.24 - JRE: OK]]
* [[2019.06.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Read & Write]]
* [[2019.07.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Veepidity]]
* [[Poem: Realpolitik Speculation]]
* [[Poem: Scent of Man]]
* [[The Fifth Season]]
* [[The Solitude of Prime Numbers]]
* <<tag [[Smelting Muh Silly Farts: ð“‚º]]>>

The aches are in here too. This heap of a wiki has a lot in it. I might not do a good enough job highlighting the everydayness of my life. I'm still learning how to represent myself correctly, especially to myself. Honesty is fundamental to truth-seeking, and I don't think I can find what is relevant without very clearly understanding the kind of creature I am. There is a great deal I have to write at a breathtaking pace in here, but I will shoot to build doorways which highlight and explore my farts and aches more clearly. At the bottom, I am a savage child.

<<<
I'll admit you project a crazed enigma that hooked me in and I'm STILL going thru your wiki to attempt to know this you.
<<<

I'm flattered that you would attempt to get to know this me. I will mull that //projection// label around some more. 

You are not the first to call my construction of this wiki an enigma or a mystery. My family and I are still a bit surprised by this language. For my safety (for however long it may last), there are some pieces of information I withhold from this wiki, but otherwise I radically go out of my way to deprivatize myself (though that may itself just be the enigma; why would I make myself so vulnerable?). It's big and unfun to traverse, easy to get lost in, and too much information to reason about effectively: so I see a puzzle there. Some of my language is considered impenetrable or purposely obscure, but I'm trying to say it as exactly as I know how. If I knew how to build a more accurate model, I would.

I am crazy though. No doubt. My family will attest. I am obsessive, savage, manic, addiction-driven, preoccupied with limits, absurdly sensitive, living in his own world, and I hold what are considered insane moral expectations (which are not the same as my predictions) of  everyone. It is a madness I cannot shed. Usually I am not much of a risk-taker, but sometimes I bet everything, my life, on metaphysics most people find absurd.

<<<
Gimme some more time and I will tell you who you are as I gather. As of now, here is you: I smell great humor spiked with super strong ego and a bit of rough salt.
<<<

I'm lucky to be humorous when I am. Neckbeard Kanye West ego and angry at the world salt are about right, lol. I'm pretty sure I've not yet had an online guest on my wiki call me an asshole (and, surely, I am). I beg you to do me the honors if and when the time arises (if you can spare a hug at the same time, all the better).

<<<
I'll leave you with this question: Why is it that sometimes we treat strangers better than those close to us?
<<<

This question caught my [[daughter's|j3d1h]] eye as well in [[Family Time]] today. You will have to tell me why you ask it. This is a classic and piercing question. I adore it. 

I'm afraid I do not have satisfactory answers. I have seen [[beautiful]]ly masked <<tag [[Dark Triadicism]]>>aiming to exploit strangers. I have seen the poor and the meek offer refuge and hospitality beyond my imagination to strangers and persecutors. The motivational gulf is wide. I have seen, of course, the same gulf in how people treat those closest to them.

I can tell you [[The Golden Rule]] is an infinitely complex problem. I aim to communicate it in the [[language of the wicked|Game Theory Agents]] as best I can. You will find I have exceptionally high expectations of and loyalty to those who are close to me. We will need to step through what it means to "treat someone better or worse." These normative words require significant metaethics. Niceness, of course, is not the same as kindness. I [[love]] with everything I have.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
