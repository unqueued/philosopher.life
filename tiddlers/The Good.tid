!! About:

//I dedicate this work to my children. I hope you partake of [[The Good]] with everything inside you; give it your all, every iota. Wrestle gently with yourselves, and be wise. This is the pursuit of wisdom here, the whole reason I hope to be a philosopher. I want nothing more than for you to be happy, and I think, on average, this pursuit will be worth every single unit of energy you pay for it. If there is a law worth enslaving yourself to, it would be this one.//

Faith is our plight. This is my metamodern faith interpretation of speculative realism. I have always found it serendipitous that "Good" and "God" are but one letter apart. Fear and hate the heathen disciple; I am aware of the sheer audacity, futility, and unoriginality of my heretical claims. I apologize for having an unfashionably old-fashioned risk-taking black-and-white all-or-nothing opinion, but Reason compels me. I sincerely appreciate anciently-rooted postmodern critiques from Continental, Analytic, and Eastern traditions, but I see the practical necessity of putting down our tentpegs in reconstruction. I am forever indebted to my teachers, the parents I choose,<<ref "mf">> and the philosophers before me.<<ref "pb">> Here I preach the conjectural gospel of [[h0p3]] and part the postmodern waters with my Staff of Reason to behold the mystical groundwork once again. These are the words of the blindest of prophets, so keep your eyes open for me, please.

I believe meaning is real, and meaning without a good/bad duality cannot be a reality by definition. The struggle for meaning is meaningful, being both good in some ways and bad in others. Therefore, I begin my argument with the heart and soul of an //effective// moral realist's claim: 

!!!{''Axiom'': There exists some intrinisic good.}

How ought I interpret or evaluate this axiom? The formal logician can only take us so far. How can I [[h0p3]] to speak of [[The Good]]? I do not know. Whether we realize it or not, we all:

* point to it,
* seek it,
* interpret it,
* wrestle with it,
* exist in virtue of it, 
* innately have inescapable rationalist virtue-theoretic subconscious faith in it.

We beg the question of The Good's existence in taking up meaning at all. There is no solution to this question begging for us, since there is provably no proof, and empirical verification is impossible by definition. Thus, in order to unify ourselves regarding The Good, it is our goal to become consciously faithful with our minds to that which we were already consciously faithful to in our hearts in self-dialectic.

I humbly offer you my educated guess-vision.

```
The Good is:

    the only intrinsic good,
    the unified end of all ends,
    the joining final telos of epistemology and ontology,
    the transcendent transcendental encoding bridge between minds and reality,

    the Form of all forms (including itself?),
    the real ideal of idealism,
    the sole and absolute law of all normativity,
    the essential eternalist source and cause of all meaning; it is the core of meaning itself,
    the inescapable concept of computationness, logosness, eidosness, meaningness, valueness, and transcendence,
    the objectivity of all instrumentalities; the objectivity bestowed on all objects,
    the precise measurement all measurable things, and thus precision itself to every degree or kind in which it itself is measurable,

    The Criterion of all criterions, including the infinigressing criterion of criterionness,
    The Limit of the unlimited,
    The True Contradiction,
    The Eternally Emerging Being of The Becoming 
    The Self-Solving Unsolvably Solved Second Order Sublator of the Grand Dialectic of Between Being and Non-Being,
    The Grandest Metanarrative which rules them all,
    the reality totalitizer, typifier, unflattener, constructor, sublator, identifier, hierarchicalizer, striator, categorizer, and stratifier,

    The Thingiest thing in itself,
    the maximally generalized and particularized metaphysical embodiment of abstraction with possibly physical modes/appendages,
    the salient unentroprizing order of 1's emerging from the unending sea of random 0's chaos,
    the object of at least the 11th (or highest stable, decidable, non-collapsing) dimension,

    the most sufficient and necessary reason,
    the most self-sufficient and self-necessitating thing,
    the self-coherent foundation,
    the self-evident alpha first principle/mover epistemic big bang and unified omega final telic meaning singularity,
    the self-conceiving, self-computed self-explainer,
    the self-normifying normative force of existence,
    the self-justified Axiom of Reality,

    The One,
    The Way,
    The Holy Grail,
    The Sublime,
    The Right and Beautiful,

    Truth with a capital T, 
    Rationality with a capital R,
    the turtleness of "Turtles all the way down"
    the observable light at the end of all tunnels, vortices, and worlds,

    clearly not me, and obviously something outside me,
    the God of all gods,
    the God of the philosophers.
```

Yes, I worship this non-personified Almighty God. The Master of Reality has but one power: giving meaning (which turns out to be the only power that matters). Be Thou My Vision! I am your slave. The Good is the one true God. Monotheism, absurd warts and all, has always been correct to point to the Goddiest God of them All, the reason I admire it more than polytheism.

The Good defines the meaning of reality, and whatever it paradoxically means to say it, there can be no meaningful reality outside it. As the meaning maker, it governs that aspect of Being which can possibly be meaningfully expressed, and beyond that, we necessarily cannot conceive.<<ref "bm">> I'm attempting to speak of that which may be ineffable by definition as I point to the mystical gateway of the paradoxical blinding light of [[The Good]] emanating from that metaphysical vortex which shines on all we can see and cannot, including itself, the conceivable notions, grounds, emergences, and aspects of Being, and inconceivably (for us) beyond.

I suggest that even The Good cannot prove (i.e. articulate) itself beyond Being, or if it does, it can only prove itself to itself, thus my burden in our dialectic has fundamental limits; I won't even get close to it though. Assuming certainty as my epistemic standard, I am agnostic. But, by definition, I can never be certain either way. Given an only marginally less skeptical, yet quite high Bayesian standard, I'm confident I'm on the right track.<<ref "cf">> I hope to border upon the stoic quietism of the sublime before this truth suffers too much analysis for my sanity, but before I do, I will tell you what I see. This is my vision of the groundwork of all expressible Being, meaning itself: [[The Good]]<<ref "bl">>

!! Principles:

* Gather ye rosebuds:

* Axioms:
*# [[The Good]] and Being are not identical.
*# Symbiotically, [[The Good]] provides meaning to Being, and Being provides existence to [[The Good]].
*# [[The Good]] is an internal part/subset of Being.
*# [[The Good]] is true and obtains in all possible worlds, i.e. it's necessary.
*#* However, that is not the claim that all aspects of Being are necessary. For example, contingent truths may be possible. We are in no position to deny or confirm with certainty.

!! Focus:

It is that metaphysically incarnate concept of which there is none greater because it is that perfection which defines perfection and that meaning which gives meaningful meaning to all meanings. The Good recursively and circularly defines, explains, justifies, and partakes of itself. It is the transcendent externally coherent foundation of objective normativity (that's just what "Good" means). In other words, The Good is the unified standard of [[The Good]] subsuming even the possibility of [[The Beautiful]] and [[The Right]]. 

The Good is the fundamental intrinsic value from which all other values and hierarchies of meaning emerge, the standalone Reason from which all other reasonable reasons emerge, and (if any) the duty from which all other duties emerge. It is the sound and complete metaphysical code of totality which perfectly imbues and translates all essential meaning. The Good is the priceless gem of //wisdom// which provides closure to the "is/ought" distinction; it is the ought, it is that "is" from which "ought" is/emerges. The Good presents us the only existential game which matters or can matter by definition.

Meaning obtains and is intelligible only through the analogical light The Good shines upon the world around us. It is entailed by even the possibility of understanding meaning, value, purpose, or any normativity at all. Even these very words are only intelligible to you because of The Good. Whether you are aware of it or not, you beg the question of The Good in even getting out of bed in the morning. 

As with all fallible and finite minds, we are limited to perceiving and experiencing but a fleeting shadow of reality, and that we do at all is due entirely to our ability to at least partially implement and bind ourselves to The Good. We can only understand and partake of what is objectively relevant about reality insofar as we are constituted with The Good. 

Ontologically, The Good computationally generates the manifold lattice overlay grid through which normative meaning supervenes upon reality. Epistemically, The Good is the lens through which the ideally-ideal virtuous perception picks out what is salient in the matrix of reality. Utimately, only The Good bestows meaning that matters. In all possible worlds, there is no Good//iff// normative anti-realism obtains. Nothing ultimately matters if The Good isn't true or doesn't obtain.

To be clear, conditional concepts can store hypothetical normative content,<<ref "hi">> but The Good is the only concept which stores and emits absolute normative meaning. Hypothetical imperatives are never ends in themselves; they only (timelessly) become categoricalized in a context via The Good. The normativity of the conditional embedded in the hypothetical (e.g. P->Q) can only have real value in virtue of The Good. We can say X is //good for// Y, but even the standard of the good of a thing obtains only in virtue of being good qua The Good. Essentially, only The Good is //good in itself//, and all other good is subservient to, illuminated by, emergent from, and parasitic upon it.

The Good is the unified, infinitely particularized and generalized, universal, absolute, unconditional, necessary, immutable, transcendent, logical truth. The Good is true in virtue of itself and nothing else. There are no possible worlds in which this proposition is not true, and thus it is semantically equivalent to all other logical truths (in fact, it houses them all, possibly including itself in infinite orders). 

The Good defies simulacra because it defines simulacra. Thus, The Good is neither an anthropocentrically constructed object nor an anthropomorphized God. In our pursuit of understanding, use, and partaking of The Good, we innately employ and plastically reconstruct epistemic shadows of it for ourselves. Unfortunately, as our empiricism shows, we are often wrong about these shadows and their causes. Crucially, a law which is constructed by something outside itself cannot be universally normative. What would be the normative standards for the construction of The Good besides itself? The Good is external to everything except Being itself. 

Furthermore, constructions imply a time when they were not constructed and perhaps the possibility of not having been constructed. Constructed truths are contingent truths; logical truths, however, are necessary by definition. We do not construct logical truths because they were true before we could have constructed them; logical truths are never contingent by definition. Logical truths are immutable and necessary because they are true in all possible universes, even those worlds without beings to recognize their truth. Thus, like its subset, mathematics, The Good is external to us. Hence, the ultimate concept of The Good is discovered, but not invented.<<ref "1">> Theories of solely constructed and contingent normativity pursue counterfeit idols. What makes something truly normative cannot be in virtue of my wanting, choosing, believing, attending to, or recognizing its normativity (what arrogant madness to think I am responsible for it!); it obtains and is normative regardless of my cognition or existence.

Insofar as logical truths are constructed, they only construct themselves. We can only speculate here. Mathematics might be said to construct itself through deduction (because it just might be deduction itself), even though all its logical truths imply each other simultaneously. The Good as a whole may construct or deduce itself in a similar sense. Any appearance of a sequential construction of The Good is merely an epistemic path for we mortals to walk in discovery, however, the timeless transcendent path was always there. Since we never have access to the thing in itself, we only have access to subjective constructs of the objective CI. 

At its conceptual core, The Good is the universal moral algorithm, the unambiguous specification of how to interpret the complete class of moral requirements and meaning. In this sense, The Good is a methodology for experiencing, perceiving, and understanding morality. Only by computing and using The Good algorithm as the end of ends in itself is it possible for us to intend and act morally, i.e. to be moral. The Good is a complex proposition comprised of a unified algorithm of all normative algorithms, an associative array mapping all possible inputs with their corresponding normative outputs. It is the universal moral computer.

The nature of The Good's infinities are beyond what any finite mind can compute. Ultimately, I am not sure what it means to say The Good computes itself, nor am I convinced the algorithm ever halts. I suggest we need not worry about an infinigress in this case. The ideally-ideal may very well infinigress, and that The Good is the only computer which can compute itself in whatever sense and degree it can does not eliminate its normativity to us for all practical intents and purposes. While we may not be able to conceive of The Good's transcendence (indeed, with humble ignorance and vexation, I suggest that if hypothetically The Good were to have a ray of intentionality, it could not concieve of its own transcendence likely due to incompleteness problems), it is clear that it provides us what we need: the practically-ideal, that which is fitting for our finite contexts.

Thus far, I have only spoken of the computational structure and nature of The Good, but not satisfactorily pointed out its contents. Like all good philosophers in the Kantian lineage, it is here that I arrogantly take up that old article of faith: the second greatest commandment which emerges from the authority of the first. The initial content kernel of The Good is simple: do unto others as you would have them do unto you (where "do" here includes motivational content). The golden rule is the essence of categorical computation; ideal empathy, not making yourself an exception regarding others, is the spirit of the law.<<ref "2">> The Good is exceptionless (as its name implies); thus, you should not make an exception of yourself. That which is exceptionless just is constitutive of The Good. Insofar as we do not make exceptions of ourselves, especially through correctly empathizing with both ourselves and The Other, we are effectively constituting ourselves with and partaking of The Good. Thus, one core task for we mortals is to uncover the principles of picking out appropriate theoretical and practical empathy in each context.

Of course, germinating and fleshing out the contents of this kernel is an exponential task. Unfortunately, this algorithm is not as simple as one might hope. In coming to grips with the application of the golden rule, you will find it particularizes to the N^^th^^ degree. The codification of the particularistic contents of the infinite set of all morals truths (which includes all possible contexts and their corresponding moral laws) are embedded as functions inside The Good algorithm, i.e. The Good contains the judgement of the content of all possible maxims. All moral truths are coextantly true because The Good is true in the same way that all mathematical truths are coextantly true. Thus, the contents of all moral laws are not merely the product of The Good, but in fact are functionally constitutive of The Good.

We finite rule-followers can only hope to find the best heuristic implementation of The Good; to construct and employ the best version of it we can conceive. The instantiations of The Good in our brains are constructions; they are but poor shadows of the form of The Good. We cannot escape subjectivity, especially since we cannot peer through the threshold of the noumenal gateway. You can't stare into the sun, but you can see its reflecting light everywhere. Essentially, a dumbed-down version of Goodconstitutes your perception-capacities which enable you to see the normative reflection properties in the concrete and abstract objects in and around you. For each given time-slice scope, we cannot be perfectly Rational, ideally-ideal, but we can attain a semblance of it, where the ideally-practical and practically-ideal meet. We are fallible, but not hopeless. It is our goal to reach for the limits of practical perfection in our own fallible implementations and unique circumstances. 

Since we are finite creatures and "ought implies can," we cannot be held accountable to implementing the complete Goodbecause it requires infinite computation. The Good, however, generates a subset of itself targeting the finite architectures and contextual particularities of each of our minds. Essentially, there is always a uniquely fitting implementation of The Good for every creature because The Good contextualizes itself. Perfect infinite theoretical wisdom must reduce itself to the fitting finite practical wisdom for mere mortals. It wouldn't be //the// ideally-ideal moral law unless it could computationally interpret itself into a practiceable law for each possible context. Thus, what is directly relevant about The Good for each individual scales to our specific computational capacities and other contextual circumstances.

Through the process of reflective equilibrium, we can only hope to grow objectively less wrong each day. Excepting a few possible corner cases, proper implementations of The Good will generally include a normative learning sequence for improving our versions of it. Essentially, effective subjective implementations of the objective Goodare genetic algorithms in our minds which mutate and optimize. The nature and demands of the objective Goodare progressively revealed to us as we metacognitively study and bind ourselves with it. When performed correctly, through the oscillation of positive disintegration in the Dialectic, we grow closer to the Truth itself each cycle. The application of our continually developing understanding of The Good is how we morally "level up" as persons (the telos of Dasein).

While mathematics and The Good are true regardless of our recognition of them, there are worthy differences to recognize. First, The Good is a superset of mathematics. All forms of reasonable reasoning, including deduction, are constitutive of The Good. Unlike mathematics, however, one cannot understand The Good from deduction alone. Ultimately, because The Good is Reason incarnate, the reason to embrace The Good can only be emitted from The Good itself.

We do not give ourselves this reason, we only accept it through. Indeed, deductive, inductive, abductive, prudential and alethic justifications may be necessary for us to accept The Good, but it appears insufficient. Crucially, The Good as a whole is something in which we can only have faith. There is no evidence for it beyond our subjective intuitions and the coherence it provides our perceptions and identities. Essentially, we can never be certain of it, and yet, it certainly must serve as our core axiom. It transcends us, and therefore we finite and fallible creatures ultimately only have shadows to work with. 

The Good is our plight, but interestingly we can attempt to constitute ourselves without it (poorly and quite inconsistently). Mathematics binds us without our consent, but The Good does not. I can cut off one of my arms, and I will only have one left; the math cannot be avoided. The fact that I ought not cut off my arm does not prevent me from doing so. Distinctively, the bindingness of The Good is contingent, even though its normativity is not.

We are all subject to the moral law even if we do not bind ourselves to it. You are cosmically judged by it whether you follow it or not.<<ref "3">> The only good form of self-legislation is that which is ordained by The Good. Either being constituted by or constituting yourself with The Good axiom is profoundly rational.

Like The Good, our freedom is an article of faith. Is it valuable to have this faith, and is it valuable to have this freedom? Only The Good can tell us. Of course, the degree to which we are free is the degree to which there is [[The Right]] for us because "ought implies can." Thus, if we are not free, there is [[The Good]] but not [[The Right]] for us. Even if we cannot say "you should pursue X," The Good may still make hypothetical freedom sufficiently meaningful to say "if you could choose to pursue X, then you should." 

There is the good of following the contextualized Goodimplementation and the good of following The Good implementation for ideal agents. The ideal is better by definition. In the same way that we are finite creatures who cannot implement the ideal Gooditself and thus are not ethically accountable to that standard, if somehow we magically gained the ability to choose to instantiate the ideal CI, then we ought.

We can still speak of the normative without freedom, but we neither praise nor blame an agent without it. We can only rejoice when [[The Good]] obtains and be saddened when it does not. Thus, the conceptual possibility of freedom is not necessary for the existence of The Good, although it would be sufficient (but, this is vacuously true, since logical truths are the logical consequences of any set of assumptions, including the empty set). Freewill is necessary for [[The Right]] to have direct normative meaning in our lives, but I cannot establish that we are free. 

My warning, of course, is that I've provided no actual normative content beyond demonstrating that there is normative content. I've explained the stoop off extending from the transcendent threshold, but nothing more. Clearly, I must rely upon all the tools in my arsenal to come up with the best answer I can, and so should you.


Famous philosophical descriptions, depictions, and pointings to The Good:

* Wittgenstein's Ladder
** "Anything that can be reached with a ladder does not interest me."




Nothing is actually meaningful outside The Good by definition. This has two important interpretations: 

# There is nothing in our domain that has a meaningful predicate outside some relation to The Good.
# The Being of Non-Being, Nothingness, is actually meaningful outside The Good by definition.



We input a {[[Maxim]]} variable into The Good functional computer and receive an output tuplet variable. 

The complete {[[Maxim]]} is composed of the context. The resulting output gives us a score of the value contains is composed of three parts:

* Context
* Act

of whether or not we are permitted or obligated to use that maxim. 



The output will always be exactly one of these:

* Required
* Permitted
* Unpermitted

A complex object which includes the [act, context, intention  and are given a tuplet output



Autonomy may be an irrelevant question. It may just be a matter of faith. 

You have two choices to make. Do you believe in The Good? If you don't, then do whatever you want to do. Do not be idle (unless you want to, of course). Second, assuming you do believe, will you bind yourself with The Good? If not, then do you really believe in The Good? True faith exhibits little or no space between doxa and praxis.


We are not ends in ourselves. We are secondary ends, ends before the end of ends. We have dignity in virtue of The Good. 

The best way to value and respect your own dignity is to recognize how you fit into the world and to respect the dignity of others. To see The Other as an end in themselves qua The Good as the end of ends



There is a terrible beauty and truth to the madness of effective evil persons. Evil unity is possible only because it takes The Good constitution and corrupts it. 


We have no reason to believe The Good is a personal God or a God at all. It's not that which merits worship. It has no feelings, opinions, beliefs, etc. It is just a computer computing itself and the world. 



For those who have been burned by metaphysics before, I suggest a few underappreciated stoic rationalization balms to quell and reframe your allergies to faith. 

# Since universizable necessity is obviously better than localized contingency, to point at a mere construct would be to point to an object less perfect than The Good.
# As a practical matter in the trascendental nature of our epistemology, while just because you inescapably beg the question of The Good at the core of your inferentialism does not entail your assumption is a proof for others, it does, however, entail it for you. You don't have a choice in the matter. Essentially, you might as well make do with the axiom of Reason embedded in your reason because there's no reasonable point to arguing otherwise.
# The argument against the objectivity of the [[The Good]] is not only contradictory, but it's also //ad hoc// in the same way that denying the existence of the external world is ad hoc. Skepticism serves to help us understand the limits of knowledge. The appearance of the possibility of denial, however, doesn't make it a //good// argument against what it brackets. While you may never achieve certainty, you're being irrational to deny the objectivity of Reason, the externality of [[The Good]].

I am clearly given an outline between the moral caluculus of consequentialism and the standard deontic account while still paying very close attention to the computational model that virtue theory (done well) attempts to provide.


I find myself forced to give an account of Meaning and Being together. I cannot give one without the other. I'm afraid an account of consciousness cannot be avoided either.

Those networks of physical objects which are not reducible to randomness must be explained by a sufficient reason. The sufficient reason may be an agglomeration of many reasons, but it cannot be explained by an object inside physics. Thus, the principle of sufficient physical reason is not itself required to have a sufficient reason, and it is not epistemically up to us to determine further reasons because it is beyond our determination by definition. Thus, Being for us can be divided into the physical and the metaphysical. Being that we cannot understand by definition is metaphysical to us; it transcends us.

That which escapes the randomness of the quantum world deterministically is atomic meaning (which may be smaller than what we normally model as a physical atom). Those deterministic bits of information are the very beginning of intelligible meaning possible for us to apprehend (that is not to say they are causes of meanings, or that they don't themselves have causes). Only about that which is determined can we make determinations. Molecular meaning and time form the physical grounds of ordered meaning for us.

Much of meaning is reliant upon physical Being, but it can't all be. That which determines meaning sits beyond physical being.

If Meaning and Being are not identical, then we are not required to claim that 

It is crucial to see that a computer can use RNGs, and that even that which causes physical reality need not provide us deterministic output, even if it has core deterministic elements in causing it.


* [[The Good]] simultaneously describes and prescribes.



Something deterministic must intervene on the randomness, bringing order to the chaos, determining objects with meaning to emerge from the meaningless. Those objects which can be further reduced to superposition are the atomic informational meanings which can be presented to consciousness. Those objects which are resistent (and perhaps immune) to superposition may qualify as an observer of meaning (it is a matter of debate whether all of these objects are conscious or just some of them). I suggest that superposition-resistant objects have their own meanings, and perhaps they are quite special. 

Perhaps it is the meaning of which consciousness can understand, the pattern that emerges from structures built on top of quantum randomness. Perhaps it is consciousness itself. Randomness is the goal of entropy, and ordered meaning the goal of consciousness. Thus, The Good is the two-way epistemic bridge between the objective and the subjective.

Information expressed in physics doesn't seem to be all the information we are aware of, and this inevitably requires us, even as skeptics, to admit the possibility that dualism between the mind and brain may peel apart at least partly into metaphysics regardless of our understanding of physics. In this space of faith and doubt, I am willing to take into account the external world skeptic's point of view, and it does no damage to my claims (this kind of bracketing is one of the hallmarks of good phenomenology, imho). However, information expressed in physics does seem to provide the fundamental moral medium in which to understand [[The Good]] of Being itself. 

* [[The Good]] is identical to a computational mind, but I do not know if it is conscious.
* [[The Good]] causes meaning to obtain in the rest of [[Being]]. It is [[The Good]] of Being.
** There is good we did not know about before. It's not about our awareness. Anti-realists are making poor empirical moves. 
* [[The Good]] is the transcendent cause (even outside of time) of meaning in reality, physical or metaphysical. However, just because it supervenes meaning onto reality doesn't mean in intervenes on the random foundation of physics to determine the relativistic world. It seems that it can be a meaning-giver without causing the physical object or motion. For example, that it gives meaning to itself does not mean it really ultimately causes motion. I suggest that if it required motion, because it is infinitely computed, it would infinigress. I also don't know what it means to say "metaphysical motion," I think that is outside our ability to understand by definition.
* It appears possible (and we can never know by definition) that [[The Good]] is not the cause of objects which have meaning, even if is the cause of any object having meaning at all. There can be something which causes meaningful events, such as superpositions, without themselves being [[The Good]]. 
** The appearance of the lack of [[The Good]] is an empirical existential reason for us to believe that the world could be better, that this isn't the only possible world, and that [[The Good]] is not the sole cause of objects which have meaning.

I suggest that the transcendental gateway is null or random noise. Insofar as there is no meaning possible for us to acquire from it, it is trascendent to our reality. We might also say that 

Quantum vs Relative world. Relative meaning.

What is odd is that randomness does mean something to me. That gateway of the transcendent is meaningful. 

The Good is that great mythical metaphysical computer in the heavens, the one which brings meaning to everything. 

Questions to ask Charlie:

* What aspects of quantum theory are not random? 
* What aspects of quantum theory are full deterministic (if any)?
