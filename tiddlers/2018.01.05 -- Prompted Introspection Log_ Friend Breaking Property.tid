title: 2018.01.05 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Friend Breaking Property

!! Has a friend ever broken something or yours? How did you react?

I don't know how to define friend, but I assume I can be expansive here. What counts as breaking? How abstract am I allowed to go? Breaking seems to be construable as changing something in a way that I don't like, eliminating the functionality I preferred, etc. This is a very broad question in my eyes. It ranges from breaking my future or my heart to plastic forks and blades of grass.

My reactions are rarely in the middle. I'm usually either non-plussed or have an intense reaction. I lack moderation on this front. I'm fairly anti-social, which doesn't help. I also see everything through a moral grid of threads that all too often seems to be invisible or //miragical// to everyone else I meet. They do not understand the consequences, implications, and meanings embedded in everything, or tend to only insofar as it suits their selfish framing of themselves and the world surrounding them. 

Alright, it's time to cherry-pick an example that makes me look good. My friend ALM broke my couch, toilet-seat, and bookshelf in a span of 3 days. He is morbidly obese. Goodwill and Wal-mart fixed that. Internally, I'm thinking it's kind of insane. Externally, I tried not to make a big deal of it. These things didn't mean that much to me anyways.
