title: 2018.08.24 -- Computer Musings: m.2

black-wolf-0 rose again momentarily when I ripped out some useless(?...I hope!) object out my C720 chromebook in order to make room to replace that piece of shit mSata 16GB drive with the m.2 126GB SSD. Bitches, it works.

XFCE burned. Without a super/mod key, I don't want to learn another set of hotkeys. Fuck that. I adore i3 for my main driver, but I don't use my laptop like that.
