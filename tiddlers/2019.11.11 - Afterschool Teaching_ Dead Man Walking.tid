title: 2019.11.11 - Afterschool Teaching: Dead Man Walking

I dressed in my ragged black for the occasion. Today has been a terrifyingly painful day. I know I won't see them again. I doubt they would be able to find me even if they wanted to. These are my last hours with them. 

Today has been one-on-ones the entire time. I'm doing it as casually and openly as I can, but it's been intense. I hand them my empathy-envelope, my model of them for them, including my telic explanations and justifications of who I see and [[hope]] to see. I'm advising my own children before we are exiled. I'm having a hard time making my voice loud enough. Ironically, I think the parts I can handle best are those cases in which they aren't listening at all or it doesn't matter to them; it helps me remember it is largely irrelevant and absurd. It hurts more to speak with the ones to whom it matters.

By the middle, it's clear some know I will be speaking to them about this. I spend my resources with them as wisely as I can. My goal is to be useful. There's not enough music in the world to describe the feeling.

Held it together until I got to 7CM. I could tell she was having a hard time with the news too. She ran out of the room when I told her I was leaving. Yeah, she is my favorite, and she knows it. My permissiveness with her is one of the few ways I get to express it. I'm not going to be able to say it in one pass to her.

Been a day of archetypes and details, but I don't know how to capture the impression.
