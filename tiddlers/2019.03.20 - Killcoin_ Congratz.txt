You have enlightened me, thank you. =) Lol.
22 MIN AGO
:pray:
22 MIN AGO
How you doing?
21 MIN AGO
Sooo, if a straight guy is going down on a non-op trans woman is it still considered gay to be blowing her?
21 MIN AGO
I’m doing well actually, got a job in Nashville and moved down here. Daughter is in town this week then I have two weeks of training in NC that I leave for on Sunday. :+1::+1:
20 MIN AGO
Yay!
20 MIN AGO
Congratulations to both. =)
20 MIN AGO
What you training for?
19 MIN AGO
Thanks, it’s her Spring Break and she flies out on Saturday. Since I just started my job I haven’t spent much time with her though. She understands though.
19 MIN AGO
Insurance Claims Adjuster.
19 MIN AGO
It seems pretty cool, lots of phone calls involved but it’s not sales so I’m down.
19 MIN AGO
I hear that.
18 MIN AGO
Did you submit your resume for that Internet Activist job in SF?
18 MIN AGO
Yup
18 MIN AGO
Rickrolled em twice in the cover letter
18 MIN AGO
Hear back?
18 MIN AGO
Nice
18 MIN AGO
I did not get the job, lol.
18 MIN AGO
:man-shrugging: eh, worth a shot.
17 MIN AGO
How’s the family been?
16 MIN AGO
Yeah. I'm glad I did it. It was a good experience. Normally, I hate writing cover letters, lol.
16 MIN AGO
The family has been okay. Ups and downs. We make progress in school and life.
15 MIN AGO
Today, the kids are installing i3 manjaro on their laptops.
15 MIN AGO
documents to read, configs to configure, and desktops to rice
14 MIN AGO
Wife has been feeling sick lately. Seems like a lot of people have been around here too. Flu is everywhere.
14 MIN AGO
How about you, how's your health?
14 MIN AGO
Man I hear the flu is super bad this year, like killing people bad.
8 MIN AGO
My health is ok, I’m getting stronger, walking better, still some nerve damage and bladder damage but I think I’ll be functioning fine enough with the right meds. Shouldn’t be an issue (I hope)
8 MIN AGO
That is good news.
6 MIN AGO
I think so. I moved all my boxes into my apt by myself. I bought a bed-in-a-box from amazon that I’ll have my daughter help me carry it into my place. But yeah man, things are looking up. Went to church in Sunday for the first time in a while, felt good.
4 MIN AGO
Outstanding. It sounds like things are lookin up for you.
3 MIN AGO
Not counting any chickens but I’m reluctantly optimistic.
3 MIN AGO
Maybe hesitantly optimistic is a better way to put it.
3 MIN AGO
You've earned it.
3 MIN AGO
Climbing your way out of a pit.
2 MIN AGO
You got the kungfu, homie.
2 MIN AGO
I’ve been trying to do that since I got out of college. I’ve definitely had some humbling experiences and have drastically altered my ways and opinions about life.
1 MIN AGO
I’ll brb, going to lunch.
1 MIN AGO
I hear that. It has been an existential decade for both of us. I hope it slows down and gets easier. What ways and opinions about life have altered the most for you?
NOW
Sooo, one of the main things that’s changed is the need for traditional gender roles in my household, I’d love to be a stay at home dad and cook and clean and shit
23 MIN AGO
Another thing is the type of woman I’d like to be with, I’m much more laid back about it now. Just give me someone I fucking click with and don’t hate being around.
22 MIN AGO
Right on.
22 MIN AGO
Those make sense to me.
22 MIN AGO
The older you get and the more you go through the more you find that a lot of big issues aren’t really all that big and you just need to chill out and enjoy the other person more.
21 MIN AGO
It’s common sense now but 20 year old Matthew was way different.
21 MIN AGO
Another ten years will probably change some more.
20 MIN AGO
I would say my big issues have changed. It's still the big issues which bind my wife and I together, even in fundamental disagreement.
20 MIN AGO
Enjoying the other, I totally get that though.
19 MIN AGO
Isn’t that what life does? We start out as these huge rough jagged rocks dropped into a river and time is the water that shapes and mold us to be smoother and less abrupt. You learn to flow with the water and not fight it, yet you still maintain your core principles.
19 MIN AGO
It is possible you have matured beyond me here.
18 MIN AGO
I will think more about it.
18 MIN AGO
Doubtful, just differently.
18 MIN AGO
I’ve only dated a couple of people I legitimately enjoyed being with and that I considered one of my best friends. This has now moved to be the top necessities in a s/o.
17 MIN AGO
Makes good sense to me. I, uh, have no idea how to date. It must be a fascinating experience.
16 MIN AGO
It’s terrible.
16 MIN AGO
Especially in today’s society with apps and the internet being the primary means of hunting.
15 MIN AGO
I think women are less likely to use the apps, which leads to an unnatural imbalance in the ratio and economics of it. Unless you find the unicorn you’re getting matches that are two to three points below where you normally find yourself.
14 MIN AGO
Okcupid posts a lot of interesting thoughts on sexual behaviors and markets in our species.
13 MIN AGO
Then when you do find a decent potential partner they’re probably already established in schedules so you’re expected to fit neatly into that schedule or it won’t work.
12 MIN AGO
I’ll have to check out their stuff.
12 MIN AGO
Life is so absurdly busy. Making time to get to know someone, even remotely, cannot be easy.
11 MIN AGO
It takes sacrifice on both sides or tremendous sacrifice by one.
10 MIN AGO
As the male, you will pay an asymmetric price most of the time, I assume.
9 MIN AGO
But, it is pretty cool to see the lifestyles and career fields of those single people. Like nurses, doctors, attorneys, and teachers are all overrepresented in the women online because they’re either female dominated fields or time intensive fields.
8 MIN AGO
Good news is that you don't hit your prime market value until about 50, IIRC.
8 MIN AGO
Oh yes, the man is still expected to be the aggressor and initiator even with the modern feminist movement and beliefs.
7 MIN AGO
And hardly any women put up a fight to get the first tab on coffee or drinks.
7 MIN AGO
Of the handful of dates I've been on, they all insisted. [[k0sh3k]] even refused to allow me to pay for mine.
6 MIN AGO
Yup, she was a keeper. I met someone last week for coffee, she stepped right up and ordered and then I did and paid without a word. No thanks, no anything. I have date coming up on Saturday but she’s coming in from out of town so in this way I feel like I’m obligated to pay since she traveled.
5 MIN AGO
Yikes.
4 MIN AGO
Travel makes sense, ofc.
4 MIN AGO
I don't have the chops to do the signaling or interpretation of things like flirting and subtext.  It's a lot of work to try to understand social conventions and arguably irrational preferences.
3 MIN AGO
I do not envy you there.
3 MIN AGO
It's cool you have a date though.
2 MIN AGO
I hope it kicks ass.
2 MIN AGO
Thanks, she’s a pretty sweet girl and we’ve clicked well over text/snap/ohone
19 MIN AGO
Phone
19 MIN AGO
Do :hand_with_index_and_middle_fingers_crossed: I’m not getting seriously catfished
19 MIN AGO
lol
19 MIN AGO
Although, the older I get the easier it is to separate the wheat from the chaff right away. You know whether things could work and if it’s not even worth another date or more time in talking.
17 MIN AGO
Aye.
17 MIN AGO
The coffee girl was a psychologist so I just pretended I was meeting with my shrink and learned what I could about my mental illness. Pretty sure I’ve accurately self-diagnosed.
16 MIN AGO
Lol.
15 MIN AGO
I assume that made for a vivid experience.
15 MIN AGO
It was interesting. She works with a lot of DID people so hearing about alternate personalities was cool.
15 MIN AGO
Vice also had a really good article on DID and one guy’s experience with his gf the first time she disassociated while he was there.
13 MIN AGO
It must be intense.
13 MIN AGO
Disassociating is not fun.
12 MIN AGO
I think I’ve done it to a very slight degree before, nothing close to the full on DID thing. And I think it would be terrifying.
11 MIN AGO
I've experienced varying degrees of it. I have used psychedelics to save my life. Ketamine's disassociation is one of the reasons I'm here.
10 MIN AGO
The k-hole is terrifying; I'm not able to describe it.
10 MIN AGO
The guy that wrote the article mentioned that it reminded him of someone doing ketamine. It was just a blurb but he mentioned that. Interesting.
9 MIN AGO
I’ve always liked psychology and have read quite a bit, being an armchair shrink is fun.
7 MIN AGO
Given the state of the discipline and the reproducibility crisis (perhaps understandably), I think it's something we all should do. Gotta do it to understand ourselves and others.
6 MIN AGO
I enjoy it too.
5 MIN AGO
I’m all about figuring out what makes me tick and what personalities are like.
5 MIN AGO
Similar to the “5 languages of love” if you know what you need and why you do certain things it’s much easier to explain to those around you
4 MIN AGO
Aye.
4 MIN AGO
I’m a physical touch and words of affirmation person
3 MIN AGO
My wife is a gifts kind of person.
3 MIN AGO
I don't know what I am.
3 MIN AGO
A lot of women have gifts as a primary or secondary language.
3 MIN AGO
Gifts don’t do shit for me. Sit in my face and tell me you love me.
2 MIN AGO
I'm not sure the conceptual distinctions are very strong to me.
2 MIN AGO
On my face*
2 MIN AGO
rofl, preach
2 MIN AGO
I’m easy to make happy. :man-shrugging:
1 MIN AGO
That is a beautiful talent.
1 MIN AGO
Alright [[h0p3]], doing the conference call thing, gotta jet. Don’t be a stranger.
NOW
ttyl, have a good one!
