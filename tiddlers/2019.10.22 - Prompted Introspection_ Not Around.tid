title: 2019.10.22 - Prompted Introspection: Not Around

!! What do you think people say to each other when you're not around?

Whatever most people normally talk about. Presumably, this question is about what I think people say about me  when I'm not there or in virtue of me not being present. Generally, nothing or nothing too different, I assume; that's how little my identity plays into who we are. I don't think I register with them significantly enough. However, I can tell by the way many people are going to qualify some sentences or direct parts of the conversation to me that they wouldn't feel it useful or necessary to do without me being there, and I assume that is passed over when I'm not present.
