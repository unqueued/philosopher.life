*[[2020.03.05 - h0p3ful Review: Cling With Purpose]]
** Talking has been fundamental to writing for us here.
*[[2020/03/05 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: Silence]]
** You know how to pick'em.
** Your answer is stunning. I don't know many adults who could have said that.
*** I would be so sad to see you drop this project. You have no idea. 
**** Something to think about with those Reddit Prompts, if these are competing for your time. Maybe rotate them?
*[[2020/03/05 -- Prompted Introspection: Appearances, Again]]
** What do you mean by "People just can't judge you based on what you wear, because there's much more to who you are than a suit and tie or a jacket and jeans"?
*** What is the modality of "can" here? 
**** You mean "ought not," but why should I think that is true all the way down?
***** Don't we necessarily rely upon first-impressions to some [[dok]]? It's not possible not to make judgments, but we can shape or mitigate them. 
***** We do need to think about whether or not the person dressed as a fireman is a fireman, but seeing fireman around us should have an impact on what we are doing in our context.
***** You are after the center of the truth here, and I appreciate that. I agree that so often we have not correctly accounted for our bias here. I agree that we must do our best to ensure that our final analysis goes beyond the surface [[irwartfrr]] to the context.

** Lol! I'm glad you think they are on topic. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy too, lol.
*** You bet your ass I'm going to argue against his awful arguments. I'll keep pointing out the places to you. The dude is brilliant though, and most of what he has to say we all better fuckin' wrestle with.
** You do it however you want here. It's your life log, so be messy as you please. You might consider italicizing //titles// as a gut instinct in your writing. 
*** Everyone you work with will judge you even on the smallest details. Microexpressions are not necessarily something to which we can consistently or cognitively focus upon and reason about. I am not claiming this is fair. I'm not claiming this is excusing either. It's something we need to think about carefully. Good habits and hygiene can go a very long way here, [[WINTCIS]].
**** If you think writing will be your greatest tool (and it very well could be), then we'll have to dig into the perfectionist qualities of the practice (though, note that even messiness [[irwartfrr]] is part of that too). 
*[[2020/03/05 -- Wiki Log]]
** Okay. XD.
*** When was the last time I asked this question? 
** Philosophers are bunch of fuckin' bellyachers sometimes.
** "Loser" is such a strong word in your vocabulary, even when you are just using it to joke.
*[[2020/03/05 -- To-Do List Log]]
** This is brief. You might talk about things you'd like to do. Some might stick. {[[Dream]]} away.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I don't know what kinds of braids are useful for your hair type. Learning this will be worth your time.
*** If I were in yours shoes, I'd try to be a cosmetology low-hanging fruit skiddie hacker. Be intelligent with your laziness (enjoy), but care about your time and what matters.
** [[2017/03/06]] is embarrassingly good, lol.
** [[Invisign]] is still there if you are ever interested. Your brother might practice on it as well.
