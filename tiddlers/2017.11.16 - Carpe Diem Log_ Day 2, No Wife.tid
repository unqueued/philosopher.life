title: 2017.11.16 - Carpe Diem Log: Day 2, No Wife

* Woke at 8:45.
* IASIP
* Woke kids
* Cat is driving me insane.
* My daughter discovered FF updated (fuuuuuuuuuuuuu, ok). I tried to prevent it but failed. We spent the morning trying to find a solution that we loved. See: 
** [[2017.11.16 - Computer Musings: Downgrading Firefox 57 to ESR for TiddlyFox]]
* Tuna hit the spot!
* Son spent his time trying to get his FF setup, and my daughter spent time reading //Dune//.
* Kids played outside, and I walked and talked.
* Cannabliss
* Talked to JRE
** May have made him sad or uncomfortable, I think. 
* Talked to my wife!
** Very cool conversation
** My son came through the door and said he might have lice since the mother of two of his friends talked to him about it. 
*** Although, I don't see any lice, it is a serious concern. 
*** Headshaved. Mine was recently cut, so no worries. I'm worried about the females in my house.
* Pizza, Salad, and brownies!
* Food coma, fell asleep...I don't even remember falling asleep.
** My son said I fell asleep at 9 something.
