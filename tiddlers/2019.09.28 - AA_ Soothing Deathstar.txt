How's your week been?
SEP 28 8:50 PM
Pretty good but tired
SEP 28 8:51 PM
/salute
SEP 28 8:51 PM
I hear that.
SEP 28 8:51 PM
How'd your exam go, btw?
SEP 28 8:52 PM
Gpaâ€™s exploratory went well. He was really nervous. Next step is a ct to make sure his leg veins are big enough
SEP 28 8:52 PM
I got a 92
SEP 28 8:52 PM
I'm glad on both accounts.
SEP 28 8:52 PM
And she said she was going to curve some since people had troubles â€”so I should go up sometime next week ðŸ˜Š
SEP 28 8:53 PM
You are in such a busy season. Job, school, parent, helping Gpa, on top of surviving. 
SEP 28 8:53 PM
heck yeah
SEP 28 8:53 PM
Got all the junk out of [[UJ]]â€™s office and put some more professional looking/starwars stuff in
SEP 28 8:54 PM
I love how those two phrases "Professional" and "Star Wars" belong in the same sentence. I hope to see a picture eventually.

SEP 28 8:55 PM
Coolest VP ever.
SEP 28 8:55 PM
Howâ€™s your week?
SEP 28 8:55 PM
Hanging in there. Grinding away.
SEP 28 8:55 PM
He stopped a kid throwing a fit by playing with his death star puzzle with him
SEP 28 8:56 PM
Been pleasant overall, imho. 
SEP 28 8:56 PM
Leet jedimind trix.
SEP 28 8:56 PM
Yeah here too â€”do you have a break coming up?
SEP 28 8:56 PM
No idea.
SEP 28 8:57 PM
There are no breaks in homeschooling, lol.
SEP 28 8:57 PM
I think the guitar is easily my favorite part of the room.
SEP 28 8:57 PM
Yeah â€”have to have that
SEP 28 8:58 PM
I filled the little fridge and cabinet with food and drinks
SEP 28 8:58 PM

SEP 28 8:58 PM
And of course the fun death star
SEP 28 8:59 PM
Have you ever considered homeschooling math/science things with other kids for $?
SEP 28 8:59 PM
Sometimes those are areas parents canâ€™t do
SEP 28 9:00 PM
I have thought about it. Would mostly be teaching the rich kids. 
SEP 28 9:00 PM
Yeah but wouldnâ€™t have to be every week day?
SEP 28 9:01 PM
Dunno we end up getting homeschool kids that just come to us for those two classes
SEP 28 9:01 PM
Neat.
SEP 28 9:01 PM
How are [[k0sh3k]] and the kidlets?
SEP 28 9:02 PM
Kids are doing a bit better in school.
SEP 28 9:03 PM
Oh good
SEP 28 9:03 PM
[[1uxb0x]] is starting to grow a tiny mustache, lol.
SEP 28 9:03 PM
Thatâ€™s great!
SEP 28 9:03 PM
They seem happy enough. I'm glad we get to talk a lot. Never enough time in the day.
SEP 28 9:04 PM
[[AG]] got a caramel frappe spilled on her today. She smelled great but was sticky
SEP 28 9:04 PM
lol
SEP 28 9:04 PM
Itâ€™s good that they talk with you ...best relationships that way
SEP 28 9:05 PM
She also dragged me to weight watchers...kid motivation
SEP 28 9:05 PM
My strategy has been to prepare for offspring who would stop speaking with me after 18. I suppose everything after that is gravy (not to say it is easy).
SEP 28 9:06 PM
I need to lose weight again too.
SEP 28 9:07 PM
All of us in this house do
SEP 28 9:07 PM
Every since I stopped working with my body, I put on the weight again. I know my eating gets worse too. Much easier to motivate myself to lose weight when I have to work with my hnads.
SEP 28 9:07 PM
Glad [[L]] has an awesome metabolism
SEP 28 9:07 PM
Quite a blessing in the 21st century.
SEP 28 9:08 PM
Yeah I like to eat my way through issues â€”doesnâ€™t work but itâ€™s delicious
SEP 28 9:08 PM
I think thatâ€™s why gpa does the gym so much and also cause heâ€™s bored
SEP 28 9:10 PM
It is one of the characteristics he values about himself.
SEP 28 9:10 PM
Yes thatâ€™s true
SEP 28 9:10 PM
Heâ€™s always been proud of his physical strength
SEP 28 9:11 PM
[[k0sh3k]] is recognizing that Yale might be real, and that has torn the veil in how she sees her current job. I think the thought of not getting the job is heavy for her.
SEP 28 9:11 PM
Well I hope she gets it!
SEP 28 9:12 PM
How much longer until she knows?
SEP 28 9:12 PM
They fly her up in two weeks.
SEP 28 9:12 PM
after that, I have no idea
SEP 28 9:12 PM
the results have lagged behind the stated time tables
SEP 28 9:13 PM
Yeah that happens
SEP 28 9:13 PM
Two weeks is exciting though
