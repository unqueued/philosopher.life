title: 2019.11.11 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Civility

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Dissent does not require incivility.
<<<

Achtually, sometimes it does. There's a difference between ever and always here. Instead, rather, let us say not all cases of obligated dissent require incivility.

<<<
Dissent is not inevitably or automatically more powerful, more decisive, or more effective when delivered uncivilly.
<<<

And, vice versa, of course. Aim to reason, and failing that, employ unreason where required. 

<<<
Civility is not about what individual people deserve and it’s somewhat dangerous to treat it this way.
<<<

Wait, why? If you think we don't deserve to help ourselves to incivility, then please explain why. Justice is about desert, by definition, and it begins with individuals and their fundamental moral rights as autonomous agents. Everything that could possibly matter about civility begins with what we deserve. Further, dangerous to whom or what, and [[gfwiwcgws]], and how is that not reducible to Hohfeldian desert? If it isn't about what we deserve, then what grounds do you have for making any of these claims, and/or why does civility have any normative value?

Admit it: you're really aiming to claim that it's difficult to deliver a working definition of justified civility. Asking us to be humble [[irwartfrr]] makes sense. That I can agree with. You have a long road to go with me, however, in defining (or perhaps even denying, on what may be your view) the concept of Respect owed to all persons.

<<<
Thinking civility is about what people deserve risks exacerbating social hierarchies.
<<<

`/facepalm`. Watch this:

Thinking "Thinking civility is about what people deserve risks exacerbating social hierarchies" risks exacerbating social hierarchies. Your point isn't as strong as you [[hope]] it will be. Insofar as you think it's stronger in one direction, you'll need to give an argument. Of course, I'm all for claiming we should be careful in our judgment, both explicit and implicit. 

More problematically, just in case it must be said, not all social hierarchies are wrong or evil. In fact, we're aiming to build the right sort with justified civility. You mean exacerbating unjustified social hierarchies. Yes, that is true.

<<<
Talking about civility need not, and probably should not, take other people’s conduct as its focus. 
<<<

Need not according to what standard? I'll agree it ought not to some [[dok]] in many cases, of course.

So, insofar as civility is not directly concerned with desert, the focus ought to be on moral motivation, right? Unfortunately, conduct is often the only measure we have. We aren't going to escape a relationship between doxa and praxis here. Insofar as you are suggesting we each become more reflective and self-critical, I agree; but, that doesn't buy you what you [[hope]] it does either. Universalizing enriched maxims can only be in virtue of building them with significant knowledge of other people's conduct and our models of their minds (and motivation), and radically so at that (it's very expensive to compute this wisely, imho). 

<<<
Civility constrains but this does not mean that it bars expression of certain (any?) emotions. 
<<<

I agree, but almost vacuously. I think you mean to speak about morality here, but you keep hesitating to pull the trigger on such an archaic word (despite the handful of "oughts").

Over time, if we had a much longer time to discuss the matter, I'd like to know how you define civility. I realize the approach here is to put some tentpegs down and point (which I appreciate). Unfortunately, most of these points disintegrate upon inspection.

<<<
Civility does not equal niceness, bless your heart.
<<<

PREACH, YO! ROFLMAO. <3. I could have written those words. It's a rhetorical device from my upbringing I abuse sparingly. Thank you for distinguishing niceness from kindness. 

Yes, yes, I agree that signaling disapproval comes in many [[dok]]. Justified rebuke must escalate wisely. I agree that "employing indirection, irony, or even ambiguity to signal pointed messages while also allowing their target to 'save face' and correct course, all without explicitly holding her up to public shame" can be "a kindness that doesn’t reduce people to merely the worst thing they happen to do or say." This isn't always possible though, especially if people have committed their lives to traveling in the wrong direction. Sociopathy is far more common than you may be implying. Generally, rhetoric which bypasses defenses isn't respecting their Reason either. The goal should be to say the truth as best you can upfront, but I recognize you don't always have the chance.

<<<
Civility requires restraint but part of how it can dissent is by performing restraint.
<<<

I'll agree that calibration and exacting restraint in how you do or don't cross lines can send a crucial dissenting message. Escalation is part of that restraint too (it's a process). Eventually, however, there are times where you are morally obligated to unleash your darker impulses. I appreciate that you caution us though. I will add, of course, that I very, very rarely meet humans who are going to stand toe-to-toe with me in reasonable dialectics. I'd rather not turn up the rhetorical heat, but sentimentalist-embracing dispositions require multi-ordered affective escalation. You are correct though.

<<<
Civility is not prima facie oppressive.
<<<

I suppose it depends on how you define civility. I'll agree there are definitions which satisfy some version of these conditions in at least some contexts, but that's not saying much. This word is doing too much normative work for you not to be straight-up talking about morality instead. That's where you have to go. Dialectically, something is being oppressed, and it's another matter of whether or not it ought be.

<<<
Taking a wrecking ball to civility to help the downtrodden or oppressed is not always or automatically helpful.
<<<

I'll agree that taking a wrecking ball to many things isn't always useful or helpful to those who need our help. It is a speculative matter of empirical investigation to determine where those lines are. You don't get to help yourself to silence wrecking balls here or preventing people from saying exactly what they think. I don't get the feeling you value honesty nearly enough.

<<<
The uniformity of civility can be a handmaiden to fairness.
<<<

Insofar as civility can be defined as universalized (uniform) categorical imperatives, then, of course, it is fair by defintion. You aren't taking that leap though. Ah, but all the exceptions rest upon this universalizing process as well. So, yeah, there are rules to engagement in many orders, and I appreciate that "can" be attitude here.

<<<
Calls for greater civility can be manipulative and disingenuous ways to get people to shut up—i.e., it can be a social dominance strategy. But demonstrations of incivility can also be a manipulative and disingenuous way to get people to shut up—i.e., incivility can also be a social dominance strategy.
<<<

Yes, appearances can be deceiving, and unjustifiably so in many cases. I don't disagree there.

Given your hierarchical claim, however, I'm worried you've not carefully considered the limits and moral requirements of social dominance. It's a crucial problem to dissect, no doubt. Would you agree that dismissing social dominance out of hand is itself just as hypocritical an act? I'm not convinced people actually understand the implications of the phrase. It's like claiming no sublation or even Rule of Law ought occur. It's a [[beautiful]] sentiment which has no basis in reality. Violence is sometimes obligated. Yes, you must force psychopaths to submit in many cases. Obviously your concerns are crucial though.

<<<
A commitment to civility does not entail mindless and unvarying following of every etiquette practice.
<<<

A commitment to justified civility does not, I agree, except insofar as etiquette is defined by the [[CI]] and not merely as some human construction.

<<<
A commitment to civility does not entail mindless approval of every etiquette practice or rule associated with civility.
<<<

A commitment to justified civility does not, I agree, and that is solely based upon the [[CI]]. You've got a boatload of oughts without pointing to a foundation (standard agnostic practice, ofc ;P).

<<<
Incivility is not categorically braver than civility.
<<<

Two points here beyond the lack of definition of the normative concept of civility (passing off the real work to the moral layer beneath), I'll run with it and say it's fine to say incivility isn't as moral as civility in various cases, and I wonder if you mean braver or simply more toward recklessness on the spectrum here (but, it should work out fine for you here, I think).

<<<
Incivility can swamp meaning.
<<<

You aim for efficacy, and I appreciate your pragmatism. Note, of course, that swamping meaning might actually be more effective. Furthermore, civility, as it is standardly used, obviously swamps, hides, and misdirects meaning all the time. So, sure, the sentence you've said is true, but perhaps you ought admit the tail end as well.

<<<
Incivility can foster epistemic vice and hubris.
<<<

As can civility. Thank you for the warning. I appreciate that you are concerned with testing our views with each other in dialogue, but I want you see the breadth of viable practices for doing so. Some of the wisest people I've ever met weren't what most people consider civil (and you have plenty of historical evidence of it as well in [[The Great Human Conversation]]). 

<<<
Civility can favor epistemic humility.
<<<

As can uncivility. You can only ever make progress through dialectics, even if only with yourself. 

<<<
Civility and incivility are not just, or even mostly, choices that you make.
<<<

Thank you virtue theorist, I'll take it from here for you. Habituation is still qua your choices over time, even if you don't possess completely direct doxastic voluntarism or real-time, complete control over your Frankfurtian autonomy. Insofar as civility is something we should be concerned with, those things which are to some [[dok]] in our control (a virtue theorist is fine with this claim, right?), it rests upon all things which are up to us. I adore that you ask us to cultivate moral habits and patterns in our limbic systems, but don't eliminate our responsibility to rationally do so.

<<<
You are ruder than you think or know.
<<<

Yes, that is probably true. I'd argue I have an idea of how much a pariah and asshole I am, but there is always more to learn on the topic. Rudeness, of course, is not the fundamental issue at stake here; it's a secondary normative property.

You make many fantastic points, and refining them is not easy. I tend to be pretty mean when it comes to how people aim to speak about civility because I've seen that discourse miswielded too often. Civil and uncivil disobedience are often retrospectively understood as justified, while successive generations are directed to believe any further civil or uncivil disobedience would be unjustified. Who is actually learning from the past? Those who shape the definitions, norms, and governance of civility all too often.
