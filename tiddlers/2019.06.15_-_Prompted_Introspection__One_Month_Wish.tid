title: 2019.06.15 - Prompted Introspection: One Month Wish

!! Cost being no factor, what would you do for one month?

Oh, Lady Melisandre, you are making me a dictator demigod for a month. Presumably, I can spend every resource (or more) available on the planet as I see fit. You give me a month to reset the world to [[Socialism]]. I don't know how to do it that fast; I have to do it wrong with a timeline like that, and I'm making huge assumptions still.

Immediate emergency supplies to the poor of the world. Like Genghis Khan, I'd kill off the aristocracy entirely and destroy our financial institutions. I'd unify every nation, institute e-voting, create a currency with the recurring redistribution model, move every atomic weapon to one spot in the world and aim to destroy it, and dismantle every military. I'd introduce every person to the concepts of socialism and moral realism. I'd hand every person a device that didn't have one. I'd engage in mass immigration in that time period as well. 

I basically have to go for a shock treatment rather than rolling things out. Obviously, this is just an initial gut reaction. It's the kind of thing which couldn't possibly be planned enough. I'm riding on the assumption that for a month, I have bought the cooperation of everyone. We would not be having fun; we'd be working our asses off for a month. Making sure the 3rd world wins out in the end is not going to be easy.
