** I'm excited to hear your oration.
*[[2020/03/12 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: 20% Off on Perfection]]
** Stunning.
** Paradise for who? [[gfwiwcgws]]? 
** It is obvious to me that one can train themselves to see the world without giving a shit about the suffering of [[others]] [[irwrongfrr]]. I suggest highly integrated psychopaths can choose paradise for themselves at the expense of others without sufficient accountability. Knowledge of the truth of what? 
** You are correct in your insightful analysis of freewill though. 
*** Thus, maybe you can correct the story of this quote to be more accurate, precise, or concise.
*[[2020/03/12 -- Prompted Introspection: Grounded, No TV]]
** Astounding.
*[[2020/03/12 -- Life Log]]
** Lol, that was a sick T1. Speaking of T1 (Type 1), maybe we should proxy up some vintage decks. I can show you the most broken parts of [[MTG]] with it.

** 卂卄乇从
** I understand that desperation. You are going to be sorely disappointed, I'm afraid. I'm sorry. There are social costs to being at particular ends of bellcurves. I think you are exceptionally comfortable in being alone in some respects though (which isn't to say human connection, skinhunger, and [[the other]] aren't needs; they cannot be replaced). 
*** It's a difficult problem, especially for an introvert. 
*** It's part of why quarantine isn't so bad for us. Most people go stircrazy, get cabin-fever, or just feel the need to get out and be with people or in the world in a much stronger way.
**** I don't, for example, understand the strength of the desire to be with other people at an explosively noisy and busy concert (but I do see why people should gather together, and I've often enjoyed such events before as well) that many people have. It's absurd to me. I don't think it's a real bonding experience; that is a delusion.
*** One of the reasons you have this wiki is to be able to tell the story of who you are (including the evolution of your desires and beliefs) with integrity. It also enables you to learn your story through spaced repetition. In time, it may also be a fantastic tool for helping someone else to get to know you with depth (and to find people who would do such a thing). 
**** A strong spouse, for example, is going to be interested in your thoughts at this level. I think real family, the kind in which everyone chooses to be family (not mere blood), will be interested in your thoughts at this level too (insofar as it is feasible, and so forth). I think even your best friends should care at this level too (though the ability to understand will vary, of course).
***** In some cultures, being called a "friend" is a much higher honor than others. Drawing such lines wisely is hard. I cannot define it to my liking; it is a profoundly formidable concept to learn.
**** I work to make you elite (not just leet) with the practice in and of this tool. Elite toward what? I [[hope]] the conjunction of our shared theories of [[The Good]] computed together as it applies to our context, as best we can given what we know in as risk-assessed, quantitative, qualitative, and rigorous a fashion as possible given all the other constraints, is the fitting method for finding and achieving that or those end(s). I can find no better golden-rule tool, madame. There is an autonomy here which you can supercharge, and I can help you build. [[IA2DYJ]], to equip you, and to help you practice being at your own reigns/reins as wisely as possible. 
***** By the time you are an adult, there will be few who are as practiced as you are in this art, this kind of dojo. It might be my Groggy retard version of kung-fu, but it's what we got. 
****** Language, protocol, and system design are stunningly beautifully hard problems.
** Pff. =)
** You have won games, and you will win many games. I have little doubt that at some point, you will be winning more often than me across the board. 
** Those sentences are expensive to read and write sometimes. There's a time and place for them, no doubt.
** Probability will be something that lights up a great deal for you in the world. Experts in this field see the world differently with regularity (and, I am not an expert; I can only attempt to tell you how much it influences the way I think about philosophy). 
** Plato might not have respected that you are a female (among other things), but if he heard the words you have argued in some of your [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] or [[Prompted Introspection]] projects, he would know you know him deep down. It's unmistakable. You could be a scholar in this topic with ease (which is not my endorsement of that route). You'd blow [[Saint Husain Sarkar]]'s mind; he has never met a child who can say what you have said.
*** You don't give yourself enough credit here. I've taught hundreds of students, but never one like you. You have a shocking vision and articulation at times.
** You don't spend much time on PC games (that would alter your changes significantly). In time, you'll find more people who like computers in the way you do. Even the older teenagers will tend not to have experience with much of what you have encountered, even among those who consider themselves powerusers. Mobile is still radically dominant across the world, including your age cohort.
** We all hate being controlled, lol. You need to understand it to resist it. If you want to viably play non-control strategies against control strategies, you still have to have empathized so profoundly with control strategies in your planning that you are effectively controlling for strategies. It is not easy to define what doesn't count as the pursuit of the control role in the dialectic.
** I ADORE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE MAYMAY MEANS TO YOU! You are doing great.
*** Please tell me it helps you remember your wiki better at times too. Landmark [[title.Title]] maymays, a shiny surface or piece of furniture.
*** You should consider using [[title.Title]]s on everything which has a [[title.Tag]].

** Thank you for the specificity! 
** I know too little about how speed factors into drawing. What are you looking for here?
** It still might be a hardware problem on the laptop. Have you at least tried to see if it will crash off a live environment off a USB?
** If you are failing to deliver the goods in a timely manner, then it's time to start accepting spoilers to make sure you complete the tasks on time.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** There is some superb work in here. Thank you.
