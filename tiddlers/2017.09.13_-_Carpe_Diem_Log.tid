* Heading to bed early means I wake up a bunch before the alarm. Sleep is sleep though. I need it.
* Worked hard. 
* //The Help// is heating up.
* Talked to JRE.
** His VR set sounds quite cool. I hope it is fulfilling to him. I worry it wouldn't be for me, but he is a different man. I know he's had some trouble too, and I hope it doesn't get in his way anymore.
* Pizza with the kids. We watched Rick and Morty too.
* Fireman Time!
* Writing, then bed.
