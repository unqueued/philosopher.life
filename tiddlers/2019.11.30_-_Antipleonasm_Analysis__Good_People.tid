title: 2019.11.30 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Good People

!! Respond to the following gem:

I think it's good to tell kids that good people aren't necessarily good looking people and that bad people aren't necessarily ugly people.

[[gfwiwcgws]]. Appearances can be deceiving, of course. That is a never ending problem. I agree that I'm constantly required to teach my offspring what it means to uncover what matters most as justifiably as possible. [[Question Everything]] can't be achieved all the way down; it's the kind of {[[Axiom]]}, I suppose like any decent existential axiom, which has to be pragmatized. In various ways, I think most children are told to value the whole or what's inside, to see past the surface, or to be critical of one's motivations, standards, and processes for evaluation to some [[dok]]. Habituating that kind of doubt is necessary, but obviously it's not a practice which only belongs to kids.

I think this is one of the places which most people find absurd about how I raise my own offspring. We jump into the deep end in a variety of pools. Doubt is a kneejerk reaction. It's not a pleasant experience in many cases. It's a messy, vertigo inducing affair. We speak about that vertigo, an apt word used by some virtue-theorists, all the time. Being lost is often unfun when so much is at stake, yet it is glorious when all requirements have been met. We're lucky to have the chance to logically build spaces for emotional creativity. I think reflexive doubt is a necessary survival skill for wandering with integrity.
