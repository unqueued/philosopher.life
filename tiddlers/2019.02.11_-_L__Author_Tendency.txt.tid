[[K]] has convinced me to write a vanilla one from the original.

I'd say his argument was a good one. My original plan was two letters, but then I ended up just writing the real one. He, [[JRE]], and [[k0sh3k]] all thought I should go standard, vanilla. I'm grateful [[K]] was willing to tell me what he thought. =)
