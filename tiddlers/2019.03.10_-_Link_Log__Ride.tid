* Think About It
** http://shifter-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sontag-Against-Interpretation.pdf
*** There is no //what it is// without the //what it means// on both affective and cognitive levels. Agreed to the postmodern flood, but picking [[salience]] out is a //what it means// kind of thing to do.
** http://www.mantlethought.org/philosophy/peripheral-philosophy
*** Even from the outside, on the other side, as a surviving ex, I still hold many of my classes in extremely high regard. These words would not have been written without that help. We are lucky to have the privilege to speak with some of those geniuses. Oh, there is plenty fundamentally wrong with capitalist injections and state influence over academia. Why do you think the Humanities are dying everywhere? Lol. The line is harder to walk than you imply. At least to my 11 years in post-secondary, I've found it's hard to have academic discussions online, even when you know where to look.

*** It's hard to know anything here. It could be the basis of GAI, for converting from digital to analog, or it could just be a weak set o esoteric problems.
** https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7882-westerners-and-easterners-see-the-world-differently/
*** I'd like to see a comparison to between the absolute elite easterners and those at the bottom. I found huge variance in my own anecdata. Marx has something to say here.
** https://aeon.co/essays/how-consciousness-works-and-why-we-believe-in-ghosts
*** You don't understand the hard problem still. It's a conceptual one. It's trusting trust, internalist skepticism, and postmodern philosophy of language meets the maker. You are fucked.
*** I applaud all attempts to defeat epiphenomenalism. This failed, but interestingly. The feedback loop can't be easy to describe. It's not nothing, it's just not ready.
**** Maybe I need to work on it.
*** You are worried about freewill, sir, not just consciousness. Ah, and that point, I will agree there is a problem even harder than the hard problem of consciousness. There is a [[Dialetheia]] there.
** https://iai.tv/articles/the-racism-of-the-western-philosophy-canon-auid-1200
*** Agreed to these evils, except that I think Saint Kant's influence is quite earned. It's a beast.
** https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/06/bruce-schneier-its-time-for-technologists-to-become-lawmakers/
*** They need philosophical training to be Statesman. Far too many STEMlords are ignorant where it counts most.
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind
*** Minus the anti-realism, that seems like a plausible theory.
** https://ncase.me/polygons/
*** Gorgeous. I will, of course, argue that not all cultures, memeplexes, and identities are valid. It depends on the context.

* Fishy
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/14/is-capitalism-a-threat-to-democracy
*** That is a very poor definition of socialism. It's a strawman.
** https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/14/too-many-people-dare-call-it-conspiracy/
*** Shocking to see these kinds of moves but his rightism.
** https://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/october/innovation-economic-impact-102412.html
*** Yeah, that's a good thing, right...
** https://www.businessinsider.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-tweet-workers-paid-far-less-than-the-value-they-create-2019-3
*** Uh, no, competitive advantage pursuits accelerate the collapse. Also, what is produced will simply veer into what is bought, namely by those who have centralized power. Furthermore, you didn't connect it to the fundamental point: the workers must own the means of production. You have not even remotely attempted to talk about Marx. You only connected the dots you had to, and poorly at that.

*** It's different. I think it's interesting, you might find it stupid. I'm doing what I can here. It's not quite a fit because it doesn't seem human enough, the presentation and the content. It's too advertisal in a market-oriented way.
