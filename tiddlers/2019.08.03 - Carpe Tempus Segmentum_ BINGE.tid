title: 2019.08.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: BINGE

* Woke at 9
* Nobody had work today. I even chucked chores out the window. 
** Might be a first in a long time for us all.
* WoW, my bro came online right after I did too. =)
** It was one of the most fun days I've had in a long time, all thanks to my brother. I don't know how he does it.
* Did I mentioned that I played World of Warcraft?
** Also, character name is digital vegan, literally Archlinux (because they wouldn't accept any of my standard choice. Makes me giggle. May they know my weaponized autism.
* Coffeebliss
* Stretch
* WoW
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Baked with the offspring
* Pizza, wedges, and onions (an experiment!)
* 3 episodes of BCS, just fucking binged today.
* WoW (I can grind, watch, pause the show to discuss [which we did several times because my daughter cannot stop asking good questions which we require her to try to answer]).
* Walked with wife
** Helped a tweaker out with her vehicle. She was really upset, understandably. I wouldn't want to be high working on my car in the middle of the night. 
* WoW
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4
