How's your week going?
Nov 6, 2019 5:43pm
Pretty ok â€”counting the days/weeks until Thanksgiving...is that bad?
Nov 6, 2019 6:40pm
Went will Gpa to the Dr for his after surgery check and he is doing great. Physically anyway...mentally he doesnâ€™t always hear or process what is said to him and will tell me the same things several times but he will be 81 tomorrow so I can give him a break
Nov 6, 2019 6:42pm
Howâ€™s everyone at your house?
Nov 6, 2019 6:48pm
Not bad at all..I adore Thanksgiving too.
Nov 6, 2019 8:06pm
It sounds emotionally expensive with gpa.
Nov 6, 2019 8:06pm
I'm glad he has he physical health.
Nov 6, 2019 8:07pm
We're doing well enough. Still struggling to get my offspring to do their best. I'm enjoying my time with my public children while I can. I'm going to miss some of them, lol.
Nov 6, 2019 8:07pm
How's [[AG]] and [[UJ]]?
Nov 6, 2019 8:08pm
Also, how are you classes going? I haven't asked about your masters program in a while.
Nov 6, 2019 8:08pm
For the most part he behaves for me...it is what it is ...there isnâ€™t anyone else here
Nov 6, 2019 8:08pm
I blew up a test last week but I can recover â€”otherwise its good
Nov 6, 2019 8:09pm
[[UJ]] loves his new job fir the most part â€”there are a few kids he is struggling with but its good
Nov 6, 2019 8:09pm
First year has gotta be the toughest.
Nov 6, 2019 8:10pm
[[AG]] is doing pretty well at school and at workâ€”not always her best but pretty well
Nov 6, 2019 8:10pm
Their grade took the ASVAB and Friday they get resultsâ€”I am interested in the recommendations they give â€”not military but just where she may excel
Nov 6, 2019 8:11pm
Aye. Makes sense to me.
Nov 6, 2019 8:12pm
I am sure there are some public school kids that will miss you too â€”itâ€™s always nice to have an adult that cares and is interested in them or that they can relate to
Nov 6, 2019 8:13pm
Hoping for snow already!!! Maybe we gets the blizzards this year!
Nov 6, 2019 8:13pm
Heard we might get snow here in a week or so.
Nov 6, 2019 8:14pm
Would be cool.
Nov 6, 2019 8:14pm
Hey Connecticut will have a lot more opportunities to snow board and sled and stuff
Nov 6, 2019 8:14pm
I like onesy season.
Nov 6, 2019 8:14pm
Yep yep
Nov 6, 2019 8:14pm
We polar bears enjoy the cold
Nov 6, 2019 8:14pm
I sleep better when it's cold, and I'm trapped in pillows and blankets.
Nov 6, 2019 8:15pm
Yes me too
Nov 6, 2019 8:15pm
You still use the heavy blanket?
Nov 6, 2019 8:15pm
Heat is on 64 here
Nov 6, 2019 8:15pm
(hard to do in the summer, I think)
Nov 6, 2019 8:15pm
Yes!
Nov 6, 2019 8:15pm
Yeah to hard to do 64 in the summer
Nov 6, 2019 8:15pm
But this weighted blanket is a cooling blanket so that helps
Nov 6, 2019 8:16pm
So ready for the weekend. ;P
Nov 8, 2019 10:28am
Me too
Nov 8, 2019 10:42am
[[UJ]] may have gotten rid of his student that spits and pees on him â€”-weehoo
Nov 8, 2019 10:43am
Lol. Good for him. That is beyond awkward.
Nov 8, 2019 10:48am
No kidding
Nov 8, 2019 10:52am
No one should have to put up with that daily
Nov 8, 2019 10:52am
I'm just trying to imagine what would have happened if I ever spit in a teacher's face. Lawdy.
Nov 8, 2019 10:52am
Nooooope.
Nov 8, 2019 10:52am
Well heâ€™s in 1st grade so may spit right in the leg?
Nov 8, 2019 10:52am
[[UJ]] wipes it off and puts it back on the kid...
Nov 8, 2019 10:53am
lol
Nov 8, 2019 10:53am
such a boss
Nov 8, 2019 10:53am
Says here this is yours
Nov 8, 2019 10:53am
