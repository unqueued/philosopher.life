Hey how's your day going
TUE 5:51 PM
Setting up hangouts one sec
TUE 5:51 PM
```

Bro's phone is on the fritz. Having problems connecting to anyone on it. He's using Hangouts to talk with me. We often signal to the NSA/FBI in the middle of particularly egregious moments. Lol!

We talked for 3 hours. Lol! Longest conversation we've had in a long time. My hands went numb in the cold walking: worth.

We talked about Pavlov, Bayesianism, empirical investigations into truth and honesty. We talked about our donors considerably. We talked about faith, doubt, and many epistemic tangents.

We talked about Hotdog and prolapses. My brother continues to call out rapists and racists in front of his co-workers. He does not have any intention of sitting by and not speaking against it. That costs him with these people a lot.

I made my brother snort a few times. =)

We talked about the letters our family have been writing. It's been exciting. He's reading through them. I wonder if he'll decide to respond to [[kickscondor]]. I have my doubts.

We talked about his therapy sessions. It's been a valuable contribution to his life. I'm glad he does it.

I can't even remember everything we talked about. I only have semblances and outlines. My memory continues to erode, or so I remember.
