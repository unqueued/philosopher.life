Hey [[h0p3]]! I hope you're having a good week and not roasting too much in the heat.
THU 12:31 PM
I have discovered that multiple workspaces is a spectacular thing and I don't know why more people don't use it. 
THU 12:32 PM
=)
THU 12:33 PM
I appreciate that. Yeah, it's been really hot.
THU 12:34 PM
I have been a total recluse lately, so I hardly feel the woes of the weather. Hurray?
THU 12:34 PM
Lol
THU 12:34 PM
Good recluse or bad?
THU 12:34 PM
Basically, working from home means I don't leave the house much rn, but it's actually been better for my mental health because I can separate myself from the stress of work more easily. It's nice.
THU 12:35 PM
Oh, yes. I think it's wonderful.
THU 12:35 PM
Definitely good recluse. I am actually happier and more mentally stable than I have been in awhile!
THU 12:35 PM
I'm especially bad at containing my emotional reactions on my face, and that distance buys space.
THU 12:35 PM
Wonderful!
THU 12:35 PM
Also, workspaces (or virtualized desktops, etc.) are the fundamental unit for me on a DE.
THU 12:36 PM
I feel that. It means when work makes me want to cry and scream I can actually do that and feel better rather than having to keep my shit together for fear that someone will notice.
THU 12:36 PM
Yes!
THU 12:36 PM
YES. I get to have a "fun time" space and a "worktime" space. It's spectacular.
THU 12:36 PM
The magic of well-thought-out tools. \o/
THU 12:37 PM
There are workspace options for Windows too, and they've been working to catchup to Linux (some linux geeks forced onto Windoze machines have been developing for it).
THU 12:37 PM
I adore it.
THU 12:37 PM
You have your KDE all beautified. Now, I want to argue that you should jump ship to i3 as soon as you can.
THU 12:37 PM
lol, "Windoze"
THU 12:39 PM
Aw, but I love KDE....
THU 12:39 PM
-cling-
THU 12:39 PM
Stick with it.
THU 12:40 PM
Eventually, you'll try i3.
THU 12:40 PM
Plenty to learn in KDE too.
THU 12:41 PM
You able to get your D&D game into your wiki?
THU 12:41 PM
Not yet! I have been more focusing on overall structure. And incorporating adulting stuff  like all the research I've been doing in preparation for the job hunt (specifically today)
THU 12:42 PM
Jumping into the meat and potatoes. Love it.
THU 12:42 PM
If this is truly going to be my life journal, then it has to have EVERYTHING. I've been taking notes on it all morning.
THU 12:43 PM
While building the overall structure, I started to realize just how much time and effort I've poured into D&D these past few years. It has been an emotional crutch for me, but I think in a positive way.
THU 12:44 PM
I hear that. D&D is some kind of story-telling vehicle. They are microcosms and experience machines that enable us to step back and be second-ordered about them, but then dive back in. I'm glad you've had a set of crutches.
THU 12:47 PM
On the job front, I've actually asked off time from work today, tomorrow, and Monday to give me time to focus entirely on searching. I have so much time off it'd be stupid not to use it.
THU 12:50 PM
Daaaammmnn, girl. You are all serious business. Even spending your precious timeoff on it. That is amazing.
THU 12:58 PM
I just hate my current occupation and know for certain it will get me nowhere. I am stagnating hard. The only thing I am currently learning is how NOT to be a manager. Weirdly enough, I realized just how badly I was stagnating when I made the leap to Linux on this laptop. Having to dig and teach myself how this all works has really worked my brain in a way that hasn't happened in an attrociously long time.
