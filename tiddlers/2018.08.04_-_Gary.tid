title: 2018.08.04 - Gary

We talked about Daoism today. I want to become better friends with this man. I've talked about him many times on this wiki. He's clearly brilliant, and he has several decades of experience in a world I do not have. I can't say I agree with him on a great number of issues, but I can say that it is definitely worth my time to understand where we disagree. He has changed my mind several times, and I think he enables me to be a more open person.

It is clear to me that my concept of [[The Good]] has an enormous amount in common with his perspicuous explanations of Daoism. He's so incredibly good at answering my questions, some of them quite technical philosophical issues. Gary is a man who understands a real section of my worry. I hope to learn a lot from him.

I wish I had recorded the conversation. There is too much for me to try to recall here. The rebellious punk contrarianism of Daoism is something I'm growing to appreciate. Forgive me for not

I gave him my card. I want him to be able to reach me if he ever wants to. I honestly believe my wife's boss is a genius. I can't say I always agree with him, but in fact our disagreements are beautiful sources of knowledge for me. I speak to him wife respect because I really mean it. I get to be myself with him, and that is incredibly rare.
