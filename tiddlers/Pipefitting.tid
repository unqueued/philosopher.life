I seek to be a master pipefitter. I'm fairly new to the profession, but I have covered significant ground in my short time. For now, this is a key subgame to the videogame of life for me, and I want to excel at it. Primarily, it serves as a way to make money. It also helps me get my foot in the door to various tradeskills and helps me on the path to self-sufficiency. 

Pipefitting is a gateway to becoming a [[polymath craftsman|Polymath Craftsman Log]] and embracing a part of the virtue-theoretic Heideggerian tradition. I love "being in the zone" while I am working. I love working with my hands, getting dirty, and having something physical to show for it at the end of the day. I love being able to point to something physical at the end of the day and say "I made that." There is something satisfying about working with your hands.<<ref "1">> Rational or not, it makes me happy, and that is also reason enough.

The future looks pretty grim for many professions, but I believe pipefitting will survive  automation to a significant degree for quite a while, particularly field work.<<ref "2">> The pay is reasonable, and there aren't too many people who can do it well. Further, I expect the supply of pipefitters to fall dramatically in the coming decades. This is a worthy long-term investment in myself.

I may be forced to nomadically migrate for work if I can't find reliable local employment in my rural area. I may transition into other tradeskills as well. If I'm sacrificing time with my family, then I absolutely must make this worth it. I need to be voracious, open, humble, amiable, and unstoppable in my pursuit.

<<footnotes "1" "It's not that I can't do the same with my intellect, but there is something visceral about it that is missing that sometimes fails to satisfy my innerbeast.">>

<<footnotes "2" "If and when it does become automated, to whatever extent it will be, I'd like to be a master that can at least make use of the automation (and integrate it into my work). If I could be on the ground floor of its automation, building and realizing the tools and shops themselves, I'd be a very wealthy man.">>
