** Others will tend to require their computers to attempt to predict their words and intentions from more indirect behavior analysis than you will require, imho. You'll have more independence in how you read and write about the world, I think.

** That's kind of you to think about your brother's schedule and needs too.
** Aww, shux. I reckon you'll learn urself hao 2 draw some day.
** I didn't. Your mother owned me.

** Yes. Nailed it. Wilde fucked up.
*** I'm not being sarcastic. This quote annoys me.
** I did not catch your sarcasm though. I am autistic AF, so I'm going to miss it often (or choose to ignore it in some rare cases). It will be up to you to decide if your encoding is fitting to the context. I cannot do that for you. We are outside my ability to safely and quickly interact with others now. 
** Striking low toward what? 
*** Ohhhhhh. I'm retarded. Okay. Might want to work on it more. 
*[[2020/03/31 -- Prompted Introspection: Same as They Are]]
** I do ask you to change gears often. That must be infuriating, to say the least.
*** I would like to mitigate that with you. 
** Fascinating naming conventions. Remember: they may read it.
*** Even when you say they won't, you must always assume they could. Write like everyone and nobody is watching at the same time (how absurd). 
**** I agree that you have to learn to be yourself in public wisely. 
**** I appreciate how you aim to maintain anonymity for them. It's so difficult to speak the truth well in these circumstances.

** lol. =)
** I agree; it has more ruglike qualities to it.
** You did a great job on it.
** I'll try to keep it shorter, but we will need to talk every day.

** Sick presentation. Thank you. We had a fruitful discussion.
*[[1984]]
** Thank you, madame.
*[[Uncivil Discourse]]
** We need to help your brother make his character.
*[[The Lightning Thief // Chapter Four]]
** Make this something you can do without thinking about. Make it easy. 
*** I [[hope]] to see you hack this together for //Alice//, //1984//, and Asimov's work too. 
** Making a comic strip would give you practice in antipleonasmified dialogues and storytelling.
** Watch your commas. 
*[[The Lightning Thief // Chapter Three]]
** I like your transitions. You aren't sectioning it off (though we will learn that style too, and it will be useful in analytic writing) in an explicit manner. You are writing something closer to your mother's narrative style. If feels so natural to read to me. You're really nailing the fundamentals of summarization. Run with it. Fly. 
** I will continue to argue that you will, in the end, benefit from hyperreading, making analogies, pointing out tropes, and giving both historical and philosophical arguments or interpretations. It takes time to get there (no need to rush it, but you can be a leet English major without much practice). Hooking up your summary to a larger story will be valuable to you.

** Your mom is probably the most likely of us to prank anyone on April Fools Day. She rickrolled me today.
