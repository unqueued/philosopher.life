title: 2018.08.18 - Computer Musings: RSS

I swear every once in a while, I miss RSS feeds. The signal to noise ratio becomes almost useless to me. There is too much. I eventually find that it's not even worth trying. Each time, I try to pair down what I'm doing. Often, it's better to just use bookmarks and tabs in firefox (that is my preference perhaps). 

I'm trying again! It possible nothing is going to beat just using the browser as my complete tool. 

I tried QuiteRSS again. I can't even live with the coloration, and I'm not going to fix it. I tried a couple addons. I'm on Feedbro...not in love with several things either. I'm such a picky ignorant sumbitch.

I'm going to keep better track (/fingers-crossed) in [[Link Log: The Stack]]

Zerotier time. I've watched this for years, and I didn't like it's centralization before and still don't. I'm giving up for now though. There aren't any decentralization tools that just work at this layer.

Made an account. Made a network. This is the easiest fucking solution I've ever seen in my entire life. It's disturbing. I don't know whether to distrust this even more or cum in my pants.

!! Arch

`sudo pacman -S zerotier-one`

`sudo systemctl enable zerotier-one`

`sudo systemctl start zerotier-one`

`sudo zerotier-cli join <network id>`

Authorize. Shit just works, yo.


!! Le Debian

```
curl -s 'https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x1657198823E52A61' | gpg --import && \
if z=$(curl -s 'https://install.zerotier.com/' | gpg); then echo "$z" | sudo bash; fi
```
```
sudo systemctl enable zerotier-one
sudo systemctl start zerotier-one
sudo zerotier-cli join <network id>
```

This is insane. Centralization makes life so much simpler. This is ridiculously easy. I'm just blown away.

Piracy for [[K]]'s schoolbooks, also for his brother (offered, may take me up, I don't know)

---

SSH setup on [[monster-15]]

Finding an SSH server for Android sucks. The system is simply not designed for it. There are lots of tools, but Android wasn't meant for this. 

Updated [[Annotated Piracy Tools, Networks, and Sites Collection]] for Android. Confound this shitty ecosystem! Android is straight up infuriating!

---

Added some IRC servers for book piracy

I don't want Dropbox on m10 (memory whore), but I have plenty of RAM to spare on HTPC. That's the direction I've gone. Found out that .sync/archive for Resilio isn't versioning on my machine directly because it's being modified on my system!

---

Looked at trackers again. Considering Bibliotik to round out my book access. BTN is just not feasible. I also lack to social skills to get in (despite being qualified otherwise). Had to go way back in time to get access to some old accounts. 

---

Trying to rebuild [[JRE]]'s old machine. I can't get it to work. This is the third try. No go! Mobo, CPU, or Memory is dead. I don't have the parts to troubleshoot it. Stripped for parts.

Testing mic and video. Video's not the problem, but the mic on the camera isn't working for Discord. There are applications which function. qTox is one of them! Discord is a huge CPU whore too (it's ridiculous).
