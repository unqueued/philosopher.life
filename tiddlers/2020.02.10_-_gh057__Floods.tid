Never long enough. Lol. How was yours? You on the mend?
Feb 10 4:00pm
I hear that. Lol.

Mine was solid. Got the DMV thing worked out for the most part, so I'm happy.

I am doing better. Just allergies that can be managed so far. Haven't had a coughing fit that kept me up late in a while, thankfully.
Feb 10 4:07pm

Feb 10 4:09pm
Not too much snow, and the cold is manageable here. It's not too cold to still walk, so that's my primary concern.
Feb 10 4:10pm
How about you? Saw that there was a lot of rain in TN recently. That affect you much?
Feb 10 4:10pm
