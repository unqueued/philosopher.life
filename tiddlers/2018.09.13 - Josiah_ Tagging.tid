lovely questions. very interesting. i thought they were great & well formulated.

you are probably going to be slightly frustrated by the replies :-)

a big issue (plus?) with TW is it often looks like its doing one thing, but internally it does quite a lot more. Tags are a good example of that behaviour. They really don't behave as passive "badges".
