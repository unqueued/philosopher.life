//As is tradition, I must stick out my neck here.//

Phenomenology is the systematic study of fundamental structure(s), [necessary, contingent, and sufficient] condition(s), essential nature(s), and normatively valid empirical inductions [of, from, and about] the properties of and relationships between ourselves and the external world given our own first-personal perspective(s).<<ref "c">> [[Phenomenology]] is just as much the study of appearances as it is  of metaphysics; both are real to some [[dok]]. Intentional conscious experience is the computational result of subjective representations being directed toward the external world (to various [[dok]] of accuracy).<<ref "s">> Since to some pervasively significant [[dok]] we just are our experiences (the [[self-dialectic]]al stories we tell ourselves of ourselves and the world), we are goal-directed to the ends of our representations. Subjective being toward objective meaning is the anti-luck normatively justified contextualist pursuit of the causal means and ends relationships of processes and objects. Phenomenology is innately telic because consciousness of any scope is being directed toward something.<<ref "io">> Without the capacity to doubt, phenomenological objects are the naive experiences of what the ego takes on certain faith to be things-in-themselves. Without the assumption of meaning, even of [[The Dialetheia]]'s appearance of non-meaning, there is nothing to which we can meaningfully attend.<<ref "ta">>

Ideally, our representations are practically directed toward what they represent. [[Good]] phenomenology, thus, is the recursively intentionally disciplined study of the experience of the apparent meanings of things (semblances) toward pragmatically uncovering the actual corresponding meanings of hyperobjective things-in-themselves [[irwartfrr]].<<ref "p">> In particular places in the [[Self-Dialectic]], empiricism is sometimes our only validly feasible means by which to disclose anything to ourselves.<<ref "mt">> 

Normatively valid reasoning about the knowledge of the structure of experience is valid in virtue of morally (and hence logically into [[The Dialetheia]]) valid reasoning. This is to say: phenomenology is necessarily fundamentally concerned with the algorithms and data-structures of the theoretical concept and practical implementations of significance [[Itself]], [[The Good]], including our intentionality toward it (dialectically both in terms of how [[The Good]] causally comprises our consciousness and how our intentionality is directed toward [[The End]]). The noumena is the [[gfwiwcgws]] of phenomenology.

Ultimately, phenomenology as philosophy is the morally virtuous perception and application of the implications of the relationship between epistemology and ontology universalized to your particular first-personal context.<<ref "con">> Justifying the significance, properties, and ordered emergences of our beliefs and desires (including our language use, volition, kinesthetic movement, and motivated action) requires recursively correcting our perceptions. We must modify our understandings of the structures of the perceptual awareness of our conscious streams of time and space in order to abductively justify beliefs about what is outside them.<<ref "ca">> Phenomenology thus uses immediate perceptions to dialectically evolve perceptions of concepts of the inconceivable [[irwartfrr]]; it is difficult to speak humbly enough about the transcendence of [[The Infinite]] because it is all too convenient to relativistically ‚ä•Elim whatever we wish out of [[fideistic]] necessity of [[The Dialetheia]] (since the finite are forced to model [[The Infinite]] into reductive absurdity).<<ref "bf">> Additionally, we must wisely beg questions of probabilistically defined necessity.

Perhaps intentional attention requires conscious awareness of the continuous fields generated between the adjustable limits of both inner focal points and outer horizonal margins.

Dialectically oscillating between [[construction and deconstruction]], phenomenology enables us to sublationally, existentially, reflectively, empirically, and probabilistically develop and work toward applying increasingly justified [[fideistic]] concepts of [[The Good]].<<ref "f">>  

Collective phenomenology is the study of cooperative resolutions necessary to probabilistically coherentify the logical inconsistencies which arise from the [[fff]] dialectical relationships between nodes, be they atomic or molecular.<<ref "am">> It is a weighing, a balance, a constitutive constituting, a unification, and a justification inside and out. One of the goals of effective phenomenology is to unify the explanation and justification of our self-modeling of both our own immediate self-consciousness (the ego) and our actual [[4DID]] self (weakly: the ego's tunnel [[self-model]]ed [[irwartfrr]]). Phenomenological justice extends the action of empathizing with yourself to [[others]] via empathically constructing a heuristical model of intersubjective collective agency in which one participates in the recursive attempts at self-justifying dialectical weighings into reflective equilibrium.

<<footnotes "c" "Insofar as is necessary, phenomenology also studies the unconscious parts of ourselves.">>

<<footnotes "s" "Skepticism is an extraordinarily high standard, sometimes requiring apodictic certainty. Bracketing must be done wisely. The ontological question which phenomenology raises the most for us: is there an objective of objects at all? Is there a thing-in-itself, and what does that mean? Taken to the Nth degree, therefore, what does it mean for something to be the objective context of all contexts?">>

<<footnotes "io" "One may skeptically suggest there is no //is// to the //ought//, and thus //is// and //ought// ought (paradoxically) not be conflated, but that program programmatically defeats itself. You beg the question of normativity in implying any form of normatively valid reasoning in phenomenology. Meaning is our plight.">>

<<footnotes "ta" "Is your phenomenology an anti-realist proving illusion? Wait, can you meaningfully say 'yes' to that question, even to yourself? Don't b0rk it. The capacity to doubt an objective reality given the experience of a subjective semblance is a privative delusion which merits certain doubt.">>

<<footnotes "p" "What is essentially non-esoteric about reality? Plato and Aristotle dialectically assume ontology's primacy to epistemology. Descartes flips that relationship around, and Kant seals it. Can Phenomenology escape the idealistic Kantian vortex back into pragmatically [[salient]] reality? One may argue I have fallen for the trap right now.">>

<<footnotes "mt" "Metaphysics is necessary for our [[self-dialectic]]. It must be some emergence and/or sublator. I really suck at metaphysics.">>

<<footnotes "ca" "What's outside the cave? We can only ever guess what is outside the ego's cave tunnel via what we can deduce and empirically induce from our experiences of the tunnel (even if indirectly through habituating unconscious processes).
