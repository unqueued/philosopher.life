title: 2019.12.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: No Vehicle

* Woke at 7:30
** Meh. Not enough. Not groggy though.
* Chitchat with my love
* Took vehicle to mechanic
** They had to bring me home. Turned out it would be longer than quoted.
*** Oh, and it's twice as expensive as they said it would be. =/
** Welp, hopefully this won't have been a waste of time.
* Offspring and I spent hours watching and talking about Kowloon City.
** Much better this time around. Last time we went for this, it didn't seem to click.
* Spent another couple hours on Shenzhen and tech.
* The only movers Yale will pay for want 6k, lol.
** Thought it was a racket before, but god damn. That is impressive.
* [[Fitness Routine]]
** Still sore AF.
* Fireman Time!
* Vehicle isn't going to be ready today after lots of phone tag. =/
** No shopping now. 
** Wrench in my wife's plan too. Ugh.
* Read+Write
* My offspring called me a "hug ho," lol. Yeah, that's true. 
** You will get randomly hugged. Watch out now.
* Clean
* Walked with wife
** Detailed accounts today from her. She has more energy.
** Peppy. I even got pushed off the sidewalk, lol. Noice.
** I'm never going to convince her not to sleep with her phone. 
*** Though, to be fair, I sleep with my computer right there. <3. But, but...it's different. I <3 U [[m16]]. 
* Isaac came by. 
** He played with my son using my machine.
** Got the kid to eat some food. He came straight from Boys and Girls club. 
*** He claims he's never had stirfry or curry. I'm surprised to the point that I think there's some other explanation.
* Thai fish sauce stir fry & Indian curry
** I like the way we did the potatoes. 
* Created 48 mini pumpkin pies. Set up the sausage and sauce.
** Those kids are going to have a damned good party.
* //The Mandalorian//
** Disappointed, but that's okay. I mean, I like the music and a baby yoda is still cute AF. 
* //The Newsroom// and spoon. 
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 2?
