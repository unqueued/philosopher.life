title: 2020.01.15 - Prompted Introspection: Wish Trees

!! I wish trees could?.. because?.

How fantastical an answer ought I give to this question? It seems really dumb, Samwise. I wish trees could have a world that used and protected them more fittingly because it would be good for persons.

I wish we could rapidly and safely genetically engineer trees that absorbed more carbon dioxide, grew very quickly, were resistant to all kinds of [parasites, changes in climate, droughts, lack of nutrients, etc.], and produced materials we need. I have profound doubts that such a thing could or would be accomplished, but I admit it is possible. I wish for our trees to reach the stars.
