* Talked with [[JRE]]
** People are feeling healthier in his house. Matthew is still exceptionally cranky.
** I got to hear him with his baby. Cute AF.
** Their social worker sucks. Despite trying to reach her many times, they never received the information for [[W5H]] the visitation. That's unfortunate. 
*** This is still likely a sign that the baby will not be with them for many more months.
** My brother is an excellent teacher and jman to his apprentices. He's got a new one everyone hates. The dude is likely autistic, talks about Saint Kant (who the fuck is this 33yo man, is he Jesus?), and is so weird. He's clumsy and not ambitious in a way my brother predicts of 3rd years. My brother seems to get along well enough with him.
** We talked about doing [[Afterschool Teaching]] or something else in CT. I'm pretty sure my brother thinks I'm insane or has diminished interest in my reasoning about my vocation here. I'm a wrestler, and I want my talents to be fruitful.
*** He brought up an excellent point about the openness of children.
** Conversation ended abruptly. He is an exceptionally busy man with a baby.
