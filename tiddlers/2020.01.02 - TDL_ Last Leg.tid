title: 2020.01.02 - TDL: Last Leg

* Hoof the last leg. 
** Aren't you excited to shit in a new potty!? =)
* Electricity
** Need to speak with landlord again on the matter. Switchover is later than we'd like.
* Interwebs appointment
** Have a feeling I'm going to lack interwebs for a while. 
* Wife needs a mattress. Her back cannot take the floor, and her sleep is sacrosanct. Let's find an air mattress.
* Need to find a way to feed ourselves. 
** We lack our kitchen entirely. Just bumming it for now. Probably need to pick up a supplementary minimalist kitchen for now (not like it won't get used).
* Probably need to make more than one shopping list, but I want to take it slow. Will be brokish for a couple weeks.
