title: 2019.11.07 - Prompted Introspection: Honey & Vinegar

!! What do we mean when we say, "You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar"?

[[W5H]] you catch flies matters. I've pointed this out before: [[2018.04.02 - Prompted Introspection Log: Vinegar than Honey]]. Disincentives can box prey in as well. Have you seen the invisible barriers, nudges, and oppression of capitalism? Of course, you need both carrots and sticks in [[T42T]]. Some methods are easier than others, but that doesn't make them [[right]].
