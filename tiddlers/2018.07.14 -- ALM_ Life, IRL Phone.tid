title: 2018.07.14 -- ALM: Life, IRL Phone

ALM and I talked about his job, anxiety. Sounds like he's not over the hump and still in deep waters. I think it will probably be several months before it starts to feel comfortable (or so I hope). 

Sounds like money is tight (the joys of fatherhood in Capitalist societies). Sounds like Jop is feeling anxious, not being a homebody.

We talked about IPT, Myanonamouse. He's setting up his chromebook as his PiHole. Neat. I think he may trying Manjaro out, which I think would be a great idea (no KDE though, which makes sense). 

I talked about what I was doing on the wiki and in life.

We spent time dreaming up computer builds on PCPartpicker. He has some thinking to do in that sphere.
