For a couple months, I've been taking a few minutes to look into my own eyes in the mirror once in a while. It's supposed to trigger interesting effects in people. For the briefest moment, I actually depersonalized today. I literally felt like the person in the mirror wasn't me. It was an interesting experience. I'm glad I liked the man in the mirror. Knowing about the effect also helped me not feel scared of it. It's an illusion.
