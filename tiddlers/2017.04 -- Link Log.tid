!! Audit:

* My links are not surprising to me. There is a heavy amount of technology and socialism that I highlight. There's some philosophy and psychology. I have very little else that seemed to resonate with me enough to say, "hey, I should save that." Do I need to change these behaviors? Is my curation process good enough?
* One thing I feel like I'm not doing in my routine is curating information about pipefitting itself. I need to do that. I could try to make that a goal, yeah? Pipefitting links.
