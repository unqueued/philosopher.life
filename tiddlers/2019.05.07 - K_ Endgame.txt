Hey, morning!
MAY 7 10:19 AM
How was yesterday?
MAY 7 10:20 AM
Good. And you?

Gonna see Endgame tonight.
MAY 7 11:26 AM
Yes. It was good.
MAY 7 11:26 AM
I hope you enjoy Endgame.
MAY 7 11:26 AM
I've heard a couple people at work talking about it.
MAY 7 11:27 AM
I’ve seen spoilers literally everywhere.
MAY 7 11:32 AM
I haven't seen one yet, but I assume it will be unavoidable.
MAY 7 11:43 AM
It is what it is. Haha
MAY 7 11:46 AM
Some stories are more resistant to spoilage than others. I don't quite understand all the rules.
MAY 7 11:47 AM
It’s just confusing. People that bitch the most about spoilers often spoil the most.
MAY 7 11:48 AM
Like once they experience it as intended they’re good and fuck everyone else.
MAY 7 11:48 AM
Lol.
MAY 7 11:49 AM
That wasn't where I was going with it, but that is also a reasonable (perhaps more reasonable) interpretation of my words! Adding to what you've said, I'm also unable to determine how much spoilage I should provide someone.
MAY 7 11:50 AM
I think there was weird cases in which I walk up to a group of people who have seen it who are talking about the film, and though it wasn't intended they spoil it for me in their discussion.
MAY 7 11:51 AM
But, I don't think they should all stop talking on account of me.
MAY 7 11:51 AM
No, but I think if you make them aware of the circumstance they should respectfully apologize and offer to stop.
MAY 7 11:52 AM
Someone in our guild blatantly spoiled a death literally 5 minutes after I asked everyone not to.
MAY 7 11:52 AM
Lol. Thought I sent this message, but nope...just sitting in my queue: "That may be correct in many contexts. I'm sorry they spoiled it for you!"
MAY 7 6:01 PM
Hopefully you are enjoying the movie soon. =)
MAY 7 6:01 PM
No worries. Haha. And thanks! I’ll let you know how it is.
MAY 7 6:11 PM
It was great.
MAY 8 10:15 AM
Sad but great
MAY 8 10:15 AM
=)
MAY 8 10:16 AM
I am glad you enjoyed it.
MAY 8 10:16 AM
It's rare that sadness and greatness come together nicely.
MAY 8 10:16 AM
It was a wonderful film. Had some weird issues with quantum mechanics but it’s fine I guess.
MAY 8 10:49 AM
I don't understand QM anyways. Pure magic to me.
MAY 8 10:50 AM
Hahaha. The directors don’t either so don’t feel bad. :joy:
