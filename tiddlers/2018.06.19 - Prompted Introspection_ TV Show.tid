title: 2018.06.19 - Prompted Introspection: TV Show

!! You have one hour to come up with the most interesting television show you can and describe/pitch it.

Don't need the full hour, bro. Thanks, but no thanks.

Interesting for whom? This is a [[gfwiwcgws]] problematic. Pitch to whom? Rhetorically persuasive or rational analysis? Goddamn, Samwise, ask a real fucking question, my dude!

Alright, I'm going to answer what I want to see.

We discuss socialism for 15-20 minutes (I'd bring on guests to talk, and I'd have a sick writing staff). The live audience gets horny as fuck (socialism gets me rock hard). Suddenly, there is a massive boinkfest involving:

* My wife, k0sh3k<<ref "2">>
** Cumberbuns, Growley, Drogo, and that Lokitard can join us.
* Lady Melisandre, Game of Thrones<<ref "1">>
* Kirstin Maldonado, PTX Daft Punk, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MteSlpxCpo
* Alexandra Daddario
* Salma Hayek
* Lucy Liu
* Me

To be clear: I'm //pitching// the orgy. I hope you enjoy what I //came// up with.

Samwise, you're going to sit in the gimp suit over in the corner drinking dog piss and learning to read.<<ref "3">>

We're getting paid ten million per episode, and I've so thoroughly satisfied these "ho's" that they are literally paying me their salaries (look, this is as interesting as I can make it). Let's make this a nightly thing.

I think this would be good for me, you, and the world.
