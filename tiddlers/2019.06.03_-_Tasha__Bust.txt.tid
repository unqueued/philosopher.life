MON 11:15 PM
Did you get the inside scoop on what happened today with the cops
MON 11:16 PM
I've been openly writing a letter on my wiki to my friend kickscondor for two months. I'm slow to respond sometimes. Life happens.
MON 11:16 PM
[[1uxb0x]] said someone got busted for stealing a car.
MON 11:17 PM
But, I have no idea.
MON 11:17 PM
Lol I hear ya
MON 11:17 PM
Oh really
MON 11:17 PM
Yea that guy they took was a creep
MON 11:17 PM
We were having our evening walk and saw 4 police vehicles and 2 unmarked.
MON 11:17 PM
They were zooming positioning for half an hour, and we had no idea what was up.
MON 11:18 PM
The other day I saw a police officer enter that building with several other people too.
MON 11:18 PM
I would not be surprised if they are in trouble for more than stealing a vehicle.
MON 11:18 PM
Yea we noticed that too
MON 11:19 PM
Esteban said they were out there knocking so they probably have been working on the busting for the last few days
