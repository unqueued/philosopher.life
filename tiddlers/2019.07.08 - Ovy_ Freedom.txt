[9:39 AM] Valdus: I hear you already. Damn bro my thanks for this. I was a slave to that typewriter.
[10:30 AM] Valdus: Wtf is this, I save and get this

[10:40 AM] Valdus: Sometimes it saves sometimes not
[10:40 AM] h0p3: That sounds infuriating
[10:41 AM] Valdus: Almost lost my pickled pepper recipe!
[1:58 PM] Valdus: major importing and changes, I will do on the desktop, not reliable on slave systems
[1:59 PM] h0p3: I hear that.
[1:59 PM] Valdus: now, to the palette, damn Im not good at that.
[2:00 PM] Valdus: my plan is to take an offline tiddlywiki and just play with it. Until I get...

[2:00 PM] h0p3: Oh, that is snappy as fuck, dude.
[2:01 PM] h0p3: I like the look a lot!
[2:01 PM] Valdus: its darkroom, its what I want, a terminal feel
[2:02 PM] Valdus: I found a website called codehunter or something, but I have no idea how to import what I got,
[2:02 PM] h0p3: What I sent you is the oldest copy of my wiki I have left. I started it in 2016.08, I believe.  I just want you to recognize that your palette, the ideas and organization, your infrastructures, etc. are going to evolve.

[2:03 PM] Valdus: I upload an image, the one I showed you, then I dont know what to do.
[2:03 PM] Valdus: oh Im sure.
[2:03 PM] h0p3: I will continue to recommend changing the palette by hand. You want to become familiar with it. It will eventually be a reasonable segue into stylesheets (something I'm a noob at).
[2:06 PM] Valdus: I hear you, but it really overstimulates me take a look at this...
[2:06 PM] Valdus: what do I do now?

[2:07 PM] Valdus: It woudl be great to make the tiddly those colors, but which, what the hell do you do with those?
[2:07 PM] h0p3: Aye. It's all overstimulating. I appreciate that. In time, you may want to pore over our conversations again to reason about it.
[2:08 PM] Valdus: Like, I am sure you blew away to oblivion the people at r/journaling, most of those are either bullet journal or damn scrapbookers
[2:10 PM] Valdus: damn and that up there is all the colors I want FRAK
