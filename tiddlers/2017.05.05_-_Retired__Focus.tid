//See first: {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]} & {[[Principles|Principles of Programming Myself]]} //

This is a metapage specifically about {[[Projects|Projects on this Wiki]]}.<<ref "1">> Someone needs to be thinking about the state and nature of the projects I am working on from a more objective or metanarratival perspective. This is the reification of my mid-long-term executive functioning. I do it naturally, but forcing myself to write it down is useful.

I need a constantly updating gameplan for this wiki. I must hold myself accountable and strategize. I need to consider where and how I spend my time and energy on this lifetool and wisely adjust my behaviors accordingly.<<ref "2">> 

Thus, here I generate a list of my currently prioritized projects. It's a mid-term report on what I've recently been working on.<<ref "3">> After gathering that information, I hope to provide a narrative for those priorities to inspect and weigh. In the end, I will attempt to strategize, forecast, and redirect my focus.

!!Current Focus:

* Self:
** [[Taking care of my things]]
** [[Cleaning my nails]]
* [[Pipefitting Library]]
* Everything under [[Logs Collection]]
* {[[Principles|Principles of Programming Myself]]}
* {[[Vault|The Vault of h0p3]]}

I've been sprawling out lately. My logs are clearly important to me. They are specialized journals that I continually grind through. They are places where I feel compelled to write.

!! Focus Goals:

* Self:
** [[Taking care of my things]]
** [[Cleaning my nails]]
* [[Logs Collection]]
* {[[Vault|The Vault of h0p3]]}
* [[Pipefitting Library]]
* [[Links]]

I would like to make sure I'm developing the memoir portions of {[[Vault|The Vault of h0p3]]}. I also need to continue to expand my [[Pipefitting Library]]. 

I can see I only have so much time in my day. It is crucial that I triage. Routine is excellent, but so is exploration and random injections (that's how things change). I'll keep adding to the wiki droplet by droplet while still grinding through my logs, filling out one existential section, and developing one highly practical section.

For now, there are two major changes I hope to achieve. One, I will be relaxing my work in {[[Principles|Principles of Programming Myself]]}. Two, I hope to migrate or graft my massive store of bookmarks into the wiki.

<<footnotes "1" "Here I briefly turn Husserl's ray of intentionality upon itself. When I am thinking existentially in a recursive manner, I can more decisively align my many orders of networks of beliefs and desires. Here I directly practice [[metaliving]].">>

<<footnotes "2" "Perhaps it needs to be done more programmatically. Having to give a qualitative explanation for quantitative arguments is a strong method of hyper-efficient inquiry (even with inductive/abductive risks).">>

<<footnotes "3" "How often should I update? How do I make these determinations? What standards am I going to use? Clearly, I have much to think about. That is likely a {[[Principles|Principles of Programming Myself]]} kind of question, in a sense. It might be the central planner that governs even this page, or it might just be me. I don't know. I'm clearly not finished in my pursuit of what counts as my autonomy.">>
