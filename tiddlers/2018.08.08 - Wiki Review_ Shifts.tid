title: 2018.08.08 - Wiki Review: Shifts

* [[2018.08.07 - Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos]]
** We will fix that, eh? =)
* [[2018.08.07 - Wiki Audit: Axioms of h0p3]]
** I now have an enormous amount of work. This is exactly what I need to be doing though. This is a key aspect of my wiki, and it remains in shabmles. I need to just buckle down and dive into it. I want to be as proud of it as I am of {[[About]]}
* [[Program Yourself]]
** I am excited to "voila" have a nice axiom. I've been worried about what I was going to do with this content until it dawned on me. I hate to say I'm making 
* {[[Axioms of h0p3]]}
** ! I am super pleased
* {[[Principles of Programming Myself]]}
** Honorary [[Root]]ed brackets for the name, but it's a transclusion now. This is messy to preserve in a way, but I can see that the replaced lives inside of the replacement. I also have my record/breadcrumbs of the transition. I'll leave what clues and monuments I can.
* [[2018.08.07 - Prompted Introspection: Instant Riches]]
** I could go further, but I try not to dream about what is irrelevant unless I'm explicitly doing so in {[[Dreams]]}...
* [[2018.08.07 - Wiki Review: Slowdown]]
** As usual, difficult to connect with family.
* [[2018.08.07 - Carpe Diem: Daughter]]
** Sucks! I was really hoping she would do it.
* [[2018.08.07 - Deep Reading: Infinite Jest]]
** I'm so close to finishing!
* [[2018.08.07 - JRE: Doctor]]
** I failed to contact him that evening, but I also failed to contact my other brother, AIR.
* [[2018.08.08 - Daily TDL: Letter]]
** Editing.
* [[2018.08.07 - BAGD: Meditate]]
** It slowly gets there.
* [[2018.08.07 - Self-Dialectic: Deprecate]]
** It's about right. Again, this feel like [[Wiki Audit]] material in some ways, but often it's just more philosophical and theoretical. [[Wiki Audit]] just feels more practical in some respects.
