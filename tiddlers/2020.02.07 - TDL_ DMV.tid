* Alright, alright, alright: time to get fucked at the DMV again. 
** My bussy is ready. Be gentle.
** Don't forget your laptop. Have something to do.
* Date
** She wants to try another middle eastern place. I like food. This is good.
* My son says he wants to put the shelves together himself. Okay. 
** Oh shit, I fucking forgot, I owe him $100 for the desk. He put that together himself too.
*** My fault, and he needs to see the implications of that. He should have asked too. 
**** It's not okay that it doesn't matter to him, and it's not okay that I failed here.
*** Will talk about why we shouldn't carry that much on us.
**** Time to build a stash that makes sense with him.
* NOIF, NOIF, NOIF!
* I'd really like to work on the room with [[k0sh3k]]. She's probably going to be too tired.
** I'll sacrifice my walk.
* Offspring have to do wikis, rooms, chores, and then they are free.
* Your wife needs a specialized lamp.
