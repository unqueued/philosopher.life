-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

Daughter asked about fate. We started talking about the difference between fatalism and different kinds of determinism. We hit Nietzsche, walked through some German Idealism, trying to doubt our interpretations, recognizing the branches in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. Big Bang, Beginning and [[End]], actuality and potentiality, [[phenomenology]] a good bit, etc. Discussions of randomness, pseudorandomness, cosmology, meaning that cannot be computed, etc.

POSR. This is pure [[CATI]] territory.
