My students were drawing penises on the whiteboard yesterday. If only they knew that's how I begin every chalktalk lecture with my own offspring. Have to have the right amount of absurdity mixed in with the seriousness.

Maybe it's a practice test (though that's not what it says, and the forms all look real to me).
