!! Are you losing your mind?

Aren't we all? Hypernormalization, Postmodernism, and Egoism corrupt all minds, directly or indirectly.

We do lose ourselves naturally over the course of our lives to some extent. We are in Ship of Theseus territory and several other philosophy of mind problems as well, I am sure. I take it that you mean in some 'unnatural' sense.<<ref "1">> You mean in a normative sense, as in losing more than I ought to given...what, my context? I can contextualize/relativize anything. It is what it is, amiright?

In short, I think so. I think I am at very high risk of losing my mind if I'm not already doing so. I can tell you my memory, perception, computation, and motor skills continue to decline in many respects. This happens as you get older, but it seems like a stark difference to me. It seems to me that I have careened off the cliff in ways others have not...'the harder they fall' and so on.
