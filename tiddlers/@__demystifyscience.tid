I stumbled across yall by way of [[this here thread|https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fkyjl8/all_words_are_objects_or_concepts_to_exist_an/]] on [[Reddit]]. I dove in and wandered around your site after that and thought I'd drop you a line. I [[hope]] to be a [[good]] philosopher (though I'm probably merely a polarizing madman); that's the primary interest that brought me to you. You are odd and intelligent, and I find that delightful.

I agree that [[evil is real|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/4/nuance-in-the-age-of-apocalypse]], and [[IA2DYJ]] with nuanced and [[Straussian]] interpretation. An [[honorable stranger|2019.12.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Ahoy]] I know has had me thinking about [[resonance|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/5/pqsy6p5bfogpk2juex5k5v3s3lasvm]], and I'm interested in knowing more of your thoughts related to that topic. Michael Shilo DeLay appears to be [[philosophically opinionated|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/7/what-exactly-warps-when-gravity-bends-spacetime]] in physics'n'metaphysics, and I reckon it's worth my time to see exactly where he is reaching as best I can. Anastasia Bendebury is [[clearly|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/whatiswork]] concerned with [[applied|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/10/why-carbon-emissions-are-a-proxy]] [[ethics|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/27/whats-in-a-pandemic-part-1]], which is [[something|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/16/an-animal-morality]] I hold in extremely [[high regard|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/13/bugs]]. I also appreciate [[Michael's perspective|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/13/lets-replace-remedial-ed-with-civil-conservation]] on [[school|Afterschool Teaching]], and we might have lots to talk about there too. I'm excited by your interest in Saint [[Leibniz|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/14/what-do-they-mean-energy]]. We may have some wrestling to do about [[concepts|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/17/demystifying-time-travel]], objects, [[ontology|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/3/12/exist-vs-occur]], [[representation|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/3/3/the-higgs-boson-is-not-a-physical-object]], [[reification|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/2/21/why-is-light-speed-limited]],  [[instrumentality|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/3/2/he-big-bang-is-an-exquisite-but-impossible-idea]], realism and definitions of [[rational justification|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/3/12/exist-vs-occur]], the hard problem of [[consciousness|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/2020/3/14/can-physics-explain-consciousness]], and [[metaphysics|https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/the-physical-definition-of-time]] (that's up to you). 

Even in disagreement, I've enjoyed your good work. It's my honor to [[speak|Contact]] with [[you|demystifyscience]], and I'm glad to have the chance to read your words.
