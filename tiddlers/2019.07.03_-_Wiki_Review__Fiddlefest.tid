title: 2019.07.03 - Wiki Review: Fiddlefest

* [[2019.07.02 - gh057: Hey there]]
** Awesome. This is surreal to me. It's one thing for people who've known me for a long time to participate with me on my wiki (which is super important to me, obviously), or to have an online stranger participate with me (which is shocking in other ways), but to hand my card to someone offline and then see them online is so different for me.
* [[Maps]]
** That is a long-term project, assuming it comes to fruition. It's still merely a {[[Dream]]}, and hence maybe it should go in the $:/core/ui/SideBar/More tab.
* [[Tagcloud]]
** I had to fiddle with it for a bit, and maybe I should fiddle some more. I think it works well enough, and I like how it shrinks to the size of the tiddler.
*** Speaking of which, I am grateful to how much fiddling I do. This wiki is one big fucking fiddlefest in how it progresses.
* [[2019.07.02 - Wiki Audit: Timelines]]
** Lots of tiny things were modified and tried. One thing I love about plugins is that I don't know how much I want them until I use them, and it often isn't expensive to try them (but it would be expensive to create them). 
* [[Timelines]]
** I like this idea a bunch now. It may add a few more clicks, but I'm in [[New]] the vast majority of the time.
** I want to start modeling the wiki more than I have been. This is part of it. I need the space in the sidebar to do it too.
** Besides the gap I don't like, I don't care for how slow it is. Unfortunately, I have no good way to speed it up. I have to move away from js to get what I want.

** Edited. I'm grateful that he let me speak so much. It really needs to be the other way though. My brother can always read the wiki, but our phone conversations are the primary method through which I come to understand his life. I don't want to monopolize the one major channel I have to hear from him. The asymmetry obligates me to some extent.
* [[2019.07.02 - Wiki Review: Meta]]
** I am interested to know if my wife thinks I ought to continue to taper down my [[Monthly Audits]]. Sometimes they serve a huge purpose, and sometimes they don't. 
*** Eh, it's not insanely hard work. It's a worthy practice, and you need that {[[Vault]]}-like scientific behavior (on top of memory improvements).
* [[2019.07.02 - TDL: Grind]]
** Yeah, me too. Lol. I did jackshit today. I don't get it. Time feels like it is speeding up. I must not be wrestling enough.
* [[2019.07.02 - Prompted Introspection: Yuss, Fav Holiday, Best Question Ever]]
** Okay, sometimes I'm sarcastic. I try not to be so desperately. Nobody is going to listen to the truth unless I throw stones and fastballs.
* [[2019.07.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Standard Open]]
** Completed. I am not exercising with my offspring enough.
* [[2019.07.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Mass Propaganda]]
** I didn't want to finish that one. Hrm. It's not a clean claim.
