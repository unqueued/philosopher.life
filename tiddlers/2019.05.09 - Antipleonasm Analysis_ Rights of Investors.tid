title: 2019.05.09 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Rights of Investors

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
A study of the inter-American system published by the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London concluded that, while the US pays lip service to democracy, the real commitment is to "private, capitalist enterprise." When the rights of investors are threatened, democracy has to go; if these rights are safeguarded, killers and torturers will do just fine.

Preach, yo!

These aren't "rights" of investors in any moral sense, obviously. They are social, political, or economics rights that are reducible to mere conventions.

Those who don't believe in Deep Government are fooling themselves into thinking their governments represent their interests. Anyone who thinks the most powerful people on the planet are incompetent have woefully misinterpreted malice as ignorance; the powerful have chosen to be evil, and so too have those who bury their heads in the sand. Of course, I also think it's insane to believe no justified government is possible (and not being able to immediately conceive of the answer is no excuse for not attempting to find one). It's also evil to apathetically do nothing about it. It should haunt you every day.

Aside, I'm concerned about a distinction between the current oligarchic political system as democracy in name only with the fact that we are collectively responsible as individuals for maintaining these power structures. If 200 million people in the US started flipping tables together right now, it could be different. Of course, the kind of coordination necessary for such an event is something radically attacked and prevented by those in power. What I mean to say is: regardless of the official political system, we still technically have the ability (however ridiculously unlikely) to revolt and engage in revolution. To me, getting the mob together for mob rule is still a kind of uncouth democracy in a state of nature. "Voting" is simply more violent in this case though. Obviously, I aim for an official democracy, but I will take the means to my ends.

I'm disgusted by people who argue against democracy by pointing to the idiots and saying "do you really want their vote to count?" Fuck you too; I don't think your opinion is nearly as reasonable or moral as mine either, lol. Of course, one of the problems with democracy is that it can become complacent to the point that everyone to hold their point of view. I have no resolution for it beyond [[T42T]] punishment, teaching, and pushing for better methods of representation.

Morpheus, as usual, is correct.
