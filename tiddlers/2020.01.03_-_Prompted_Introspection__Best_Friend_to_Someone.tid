title: 2020.01.03 - Prompted Introspection: Best Friend to Someone

!! How would you feel if someone told you that you were his or her best friend?

Uh, I would feel honored, and I would [[hope]] to be useful to them. I'm generally happy to be someone's friend, best or otherwise. I hate that I generally cannot reciprocate the claim; [[my wife|k0sh3k]] is my best friend. As usual, I cannot define //friendship// effectively enough, but I will agree that one can meaningfully speak of "best" friends in rank (despite the relative worries of context). 

I'm saddened by the number of people who are just plain fucking lonely. If it cannot be commodified by those in power, I predict it (including social structures) to be diminished or demolished; friendships of depth appear harder to attain (though this may be my bias coming out again).
