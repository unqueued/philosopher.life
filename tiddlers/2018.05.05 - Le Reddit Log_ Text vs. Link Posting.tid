You make an excellent point.

Imho, link aggregation is the lowest common denominator usage of Reddit. It's much easier to create or participate in subs that largely revolve around upvoting for salience in links than it is to create or participate in subs which revolve around making salient text posts. Text posts, on average, require more thought than simply linking.

I can ambiguously point you to an article, video, or picture without having to express a significant yet valid (according to mods or consensus) opinion, joke, or argument about it outside of my title (which is usually the most basic of summaries or one-liners). The barrier to entry for successful link posting is lower than text-only posting.

In my experience, users (including mods) are far more likely to violently reject you as a person or your post's content given your writing instead of a mere link. Text-only posting requires we speak a common language with similar values, that we are more tightly knit culturally, that we have the emotional energy and trust to engage in the tit-for-tat games of investing in understanding each others' writings and perspectives.

I suggest it is possible that users are somehow viewed as less responsible (blame or praise) for what they link to than what they themselves write. This may also be a factor.

Meta-based posts are perhaps even more complicated because they challenge the paradigms and powers of the mods and the sub's userbase. It splits communities, etc.
