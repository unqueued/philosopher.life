title: 2019.07.09 - TDL: Day Off

* Fuck it, Spinoza book is out for now. I got through half of it, and that's for now. 
* I should get veggies and dishtabs.
* The house is looking clean, but you should continue to make it even nicer. This is your chance to do a house cleaning without offspring as a variable. Time to do science.
* Your [[Maps]] are looking hawter.
* I'd like to see [[Recent Obsessions]] die off.
* We need [[Cover Letters]]. 
* More paperwork to do. 
* Paint
* You know, your wife is taking the day off, so maybe just chill with her?
