title: 2010.10.28 -- Neo-Aristotelian Virtue Theory Examination - 2

''[1a]''

In his //Groundwork//, Kant examines the “moral worth” of actions performed from duty rather than from inclination.<<ref "1">>  In his view, an agent who employs reason to understand one’s duty and then acts from and for the sake of duty has performed an act of moral worth, one which merits “esteem.”<<ref "2">>  He uses the example of the ‘sad philanthropist’ to demonstrate his argument concerning the moral worth of actions. 

Kant refers to the sad philanthropist as “the friend of man” who is “overclouded by sorrows of his own which extinguish all sympathy with the fate others.”<<ref "3">>  The sad philanthropist, in this instance, no longer has any emotional motivation or inclination to help others in need. From reason and freewill, the sad philanthropist overcomes his sadness as he “tears himself out of this deadly insensibility and does the [right] action without any inclination for the sake of duty alone.”<<ref "4">>  Clearly, Kant uses the example of the sad philanthropist to demonstrate the motivational requirements (from duty alone) of an action with moral worth. The sad philanthropist’s emotions (which are always outside the control of the agent) and inclination (which are also outside the control of the agent within this time frame) are incidental. Crucially, Kant isn’t talking about the character of the agent in this passage of the Groundwork, but rather the rightness and moral worth of the action. 

'' [Foot’s Criticism]''

Phillipa Foot argues that Kant has not properly understood emotion and inclination as necessary variables in the moral motivation equation used in judging the moral worth of action. Foot criticizes Kant’s sad philanthropist as an agent who is lacking the proper motivation and sympathy, and essentially the virtuous character, required to categorize the resulting action as having moral worth. Vitally, she explains:

<<<
Charity is a virtue of attachment, and that sympathy for others which makes it easier to help them is part of the virtue itself.<<ref "5">> 
<<<

Foot is suggesting that having the appropriate ‘virtuous emotions’ (whether or not we have control of them) is a necessary part of possessing the full virtue. In our case, Foot is claiming that the sad philanthropist lacks the emotional and pathological sympathy for others in need, and is therefore lacking some degree of charity. Foot continues:

<<<
Some actions are in accordance with virtue without requiring virtue for their performance, whereas others are both in accordance with virtue and such as to show possession of a virtue.<<ref "6">>
<<<
 
Foot believes there are some circumstances which pose few, if any, obstacles for acting virtuously, where it is all too ‘easy’ to perform the virtuous act, e.g. when the right moral choice involves self-preservation. There are, however, other difficult circumstances in which even a virtuous agent is truly tested, and where we can more readily see exactly where an agent is lacking virtuous character. The circumstance which caused the sad philanthropist to be ‘overclouded by sorrow’ is the sort of circumstance which really tests the character of an agent. Importantly, Foot distinguishes acting ‘in accordance with virtue’ from actually showing full ‘possession of a virtue’. It is here that she can accuse the sad philanthropist of not possessing full virtue, despite his acting in accordance with virtue. She argues:

<<<
The man who acts charitably out of a sense of duty is not to be undervalued, but it is the other who most shows virtue and therefore to the other that most moral worth is attributed. Only a detail of Kant’s presentation of the case of the dutiful philanthropist tells on the other side. For what he actually said was that this man felt no sympathy and took no pleasure in the good of others because ‘his mind was clouded by some sorrow of his own’, and this is the kind of circumstance that increases the virtue that is needed if a man is to act well’.<<ref "7">>
<<<

If the ‘friend of man’, despite his circumstances, had a character which was readily inclined to be philanthropic and charitable, taking pleasure in doing what is right, having the proper emotional state required to be virtuous, Foot would be willing to claim that his action wasn’t just in accordance with virtue, but also showed the possession of virtue. 

The sad philanthropist is simply not as virtuous as an agent who felt the proper sympathy. The virtuous emotions are necessary for moral motivation and virtuous character, and thus also necessary to claim an action has moral worth. The sad philanthropist lacks the virtuous emotions, finding it difficult because of his emotional turmoil to do what is virtuous, and thus demonstrates a flaw in his character. Foot, therefore, deems the sad philanthropist’s action as lacking moral worth compared to the virtuous agent who possesses the necessary virtuous emotions and character, easily doing what is right. As the virtuous agent can be said to have not only acted in accordance with virtue (just as the sad philanthropist), but to also actually possess the virtue because he had virtuous emotions and character, the virtuous person’s action has maximal moral worth.

''[Hursthouse’s Criticism]''

Hursthouse considers at length the implications of Aristotle’s distinction between the continent agent and the fully virtuous agent. The continent agent possesses self-control (//enkrateia//) and is “one who, typically, knowing what she should do, does it, contrary, to her desires.”<<ref "8">>  Hursthouse contrasts the fully virtuous person as “one who, typically, knowing what she should do, does it, desiring to do it.”<<ref "9">>  Unlike the continent agent, the fully virtuous person’s “desires are in ‘complete harmony’ with her reason; hence, when she does what she should, she does what she desires to do, and reaps the reward of satisfied desire.”<<ref "10">>  In Hursthouse’s eyes, both the disharmony between the continent agent’s reason and her desire, and the inability to have those desires satisfied when performing in accordance with virtue demonstrate why the continent agent is morally inferior to the virtuous agent.<<ref "11">>

Hursthouse, keeping in mind the continent/fully virtuous distinction, disagrees to some extent with Phillipa Foot’s criticism, particularly concerning how one should qualify and understand the clause “virtuous conduct gives pleasure to the lover of virtue.”<<ref "12">>  Hursthouse carefully explains:

<<<
There is no reason why an Aristotelian should not agree with Kant that there is something particularly estimable about the action of the sorrowing philanthropist. For here, the ‘difficulty that stands in the way’ of his virtuous action is of the sort that ‘provides an occasion’ for much virtue. It is his sorrow which makes noticing and attending to the needs of others particularly difficult; and as Foot rightly remarks, if he still manages to act with charity this ‘most shows virtue’, because ‘this is the kind of circumstance that increases the virtue that is needed if a man is to act well’.<<ref "13">>
<<< 

	If the sad philanthropist “finds it hard”<<ref "14">>  to be charitable //because //his mind is ‘overclouded by sorrow’, but still uses proper reasoning to choose and act charitably, then Hursthouse believes the sad philanthropist is displaying virtue in the face of a difficult obstacle. In this special case, assuming the sad philanthropist employs his capacity to reason correctly, he is possibly better than the merely continent agent - rather he might be fully virtuous. 

Hursthouse goes on to explain that to be inclined to have certain emotions isn’t sufficient for being a reliably virtuous agent.<<ref "15">>  The basis of this lack of sufficiency is Aristotle’s disagreement (Kant also disagrees) with the Humean principle of action, particularly “passion and desire.”<<ref "16">>  Hursthouse attempts to synthesize Kantian and Aristotelian definitions of inclination when she says:

<<<
[W]e all know that the ideal Kantian agent acts from a sense of duty, not from inclination, but if ‘inclination’ is that-principle-of-movement-we-share-with-the-other-animals, then the virtuous Aristotelian agent doesn’t act from inclination either, but from reason (logos) in the form of ‘choice’ (//prohairesis//).<<ref "17">>
<<<

	Acting from animalistic inclination is something that even the continent agent avoids. In this sense of inclination, Hursthouse is willing to agree, to some extent, with Kant’s ‘moral worth’ argument. Agents acting from animalistic inclinations are not performing esteemed ‘right’ action with any moral worth. It is here that we see Hursthouse’s true interpretation of Kant’s sad philanthropist, and she attempts to demonstrate how Kant has failed to understand the role of emotions in virtue theory; she says:

<<<
But, sticking to the text, the sorrowing philanthropist is someone with Humean benevolence, liable to go wrong in a variety of ways, who hitherto acted only from inclination and now ‘for the first time’ acts ‘for the sake of duty alone’; not a new sort of philanthropist who has been introduced in contrast to the happy ones. And, in Aristotelian terms, this is hardly a coherent picture.<<ref "18">>
<<<

	Essentially, Hursthouse criticizes the sad philanthropist of having been, historically speaking, motivated and acting from an animalistic/child-like Humean inclination. It is merely by happenstance, according to Hursthouse, that the sad philanthropist is in the rare case of having been motivated to act for the sake of duty, rather than his usual animalistic inclination. Hursthouse continues:

<<<
Once one has acquired reason, the only thing that would clearly count as being the sort of agent who acts ‘only from inclination’ and not from reason is being the sort of agent who is akratic or ‘weak-willed’ in character.<<ref "19">>
<<<

	Hursthouse is claiming that the sad philanthropist not only isn’t like a virtuous agent in choosing to overcome his sorrows, but he isn’t even (reliably) like the continent agent! The sad philanthropist has historically chosen to act from animalistic inclination, instead of reason, demonstrating that he has an akratic and deeply flawed character. An agent who has such a flawed character that he reliably chooses to act from animalistic inclination lacks real moral motivation to perform actions with actual moral worth. Hursthouse closes her criticism:

<<<
In so far as it makes sense to talk of Aristotle’s view on ‘motivation’, the continent and the fully virtuous have the same ‘motivation’—they each act from reason in the form of ‘choice’ (prohairesis). The difference between them lies not in their ‘motivation’ or reasons for action, but in their condition; the fully virtuous are better disposed in relation to their emotions than the self-controlled.<<ref "20">>
<<<

	The fully virtuous agent has a harmony between her emotions, desires, and reason. The continent agent does not possess this harmony. In order for an action to have moral worth it must be performed by an agent who possesses a virtuous character and reliably has the virtuous emotions in harmony with proper reason.  In Hursthouse’s view, the sad philanthropist fails to meet these requirements by a long shot (he reliably acts from animalistic inclination), and therefore his action lacks moral worth.

''[1b]''

	Hursthouse fails to properly address Kant’s primary argument. Kant’s major claim is that the moral worth of action is a result of reason and will, being motivated and acting from and for the sake of duty alone. Hursthouse argues about the character of the sad philanthropist, but fails to counter (strongly) Kant’s principle behind the claim that the sad philanthropist’s action has moral worth. This is an unfortunate oversight on her part. 

The sad philanthropist does not demonstrate Hursthouse's distinction between continent and fully virtuous. The sad philanthropist demonstrates the divide between one who reliably acts from animalistic inclination and the continent agent. The continent agent does what is right, despite his feelings and desires. The animalistically inclined agent does what is right because his feelings and desires drive him to do so. Hursthouse destroys the sad philanthropist’s character (his historical animalistic motivation), but she doesn’t demonstrate how the sad philanthropist is an example of why the actions of the fully virtuous agent have moral worth where the actions of the continent agent do not, and essentially, she doesn’t provide a strong argument against Kant’s ‘moral worth’-making principle.

	Kant is arguing that ‘moral worth’ is the result of being motivated to do what is right because it is right. Kant believes an agent requires continence in conjunction with this for-duty-alone motivation to perform actions of moral worth; Hursthouse believes the requirements for ‘moral worth’ are different and more difficult to attain. Hursthouse thinks both possessing the virtuous character (better than continence) and reliably feeling virtuous emotions in harmony with one’s reason (definitionally impossible for the continent) are the necessary ‘moral worth’-making preconditions. Why should we believe her?  

If Hursthouse is correct about what makes an action have moral worth, then I daresay I’ve never met a person who has ever performed an action with moral worth because I’ve never met (to my knowledge) a person with a fully virtuous character. If only the virtuous agent can perform actions with moral worth, then the rest of us (who aren’t fully virtuous) are doomed to perform actions (even if in accordance with virtue) which lack moral worth.

Kant can make sense of character development and give a plausible account of ‘moral worth’-making preconditions without putting us into the awkward position that Hursthouse does. I think he would argue that over the course of the character development of agents, some people will have initially strong dispositions to do what is wrong, and others will have the opposite, and yet others will fall in between. Kant thinks you can start out as being non-virtuous, but through repeated applications of reason and willing to act from duty, you will arrive at having a virtuous character. Character, however, is not the condition which determines the moral worth of action, rather it is merely a measurement of the moral worth of an agent’s choices from a broad temporal scope. Note that the ‘moral worth’ judgment precedes character determination.

Completely different from Hursthouse, Kant thinks one can act correctly, producing an action with moral worth, even with a poor disposition. Kant uses a small temporal scope, judging the smallest units of experience – individual choices. Kant believes that one may choose to do what is right and morally worthy at any point on the timeline of choices of the agent. In this unit of moral experience, inclinations, emotions, desires, character are incidental; the choice and reasoning which motivates a person are the sole factors in judging the rightness and moral worth of the resulting action. 

So, whether a person is a racist (Hursthouse’s example of a vicious agent) or a virtuous agent, at each choice, she has the ability to choose to act outside of her inclinations, emotions, desires, or character. When she chooses to act for the sake of duty, then her action has moral worth. Even the racist or Mafioso can choose to act for the sake of duty, and thus even their actions can possibly have moral worth. 

Hursthouse did not properly address the sort of account of character Kant might give; instead she implies that virtuous character is necessary for actions to have ‘moral-worth’. I don’t see why this is necessary or even plausible. As a part of this disagreement over the primacy of character and disposition, Hursthouse and Kant also have a fundamental disagreement concerning the role of emotions in ethics. We must ask: why should we believe that emotions are necessary components for ‘doing’ the right action? 

Kant would say that emotions are neither necessary nor sufficient for doing the right action. Emotions are subjective, not dependable, and, most importantly, agents cannot exercise will power over emotions – we lack control of our emotions. To lack control over our emotions (in an immediate sense) removes our (immediate) moral responsibility for them. Hursthouse fails to rebut this fundamental point. 

Hursthouse desperately needs to provide an account of how we are morally culpable for our emotions even if we aren’t in full control of them. It is possible that Hursthouse could instead claim we have full control over our emotions, but that claim seems very implausible (from my own anecdotal experience). She does think emotions are part rational and part irrational. She needs to flesh out the psychology of moral agents, particularly the relationship of will and emotion, in order to provide a plausible account of moral responsibility.

	The criticism of the sad philanthropist was a misdirected argument. Kant was clearly discussing the ‘moral worth’ of actions and the sort of motivation required for it, not the character of the sad philanthropist. Hursthouse should have shown why ‘acting from duty alone’ is not necessary and sufficient for the moral worth of action. Only after rebutting Kant’s major claim should she have provided a much stronger account of her own theory of what is necessary and sufficient for the moral worth of action. 

''[2a]''

In considering the nature of ‘reason’ in the claim that the virtuous agent chooses “a V action for an X reason” Hursthouse draws on Sarah Broadie’s “Grand End theory.”<<ref "21">>  Both Broadie and Hursthouse are concerned with whether or not we are justified in ascribing to the virtuous agent “an explicit, comprehensive, substantial vision of the good.”<<ref "22">>  Hursthouse questions the necessity of such an ascription and its impact upon the moral motivation of the virtuous agent. Hursthouse expounds:

<<<
When philosophers start implying that it is a necessary condition of virtue that the virtuous have reflected long and hard about what eudaimonia consists in and worked out a picture of what is involved in acting well so comprehensive and substantial that it can be applied and its application justified in every suitable case, we may be sure that they are falling victim to what could be called ‘the Platonic fantasy’. This is the fantasy that it is only through the study of philosophy that one can become virtuous (or really virtuous).<<ref "23">>
<<<

	The ‘Platonic fantasy’ is the claim that the virtuous agent must (either explicitly or implicitly) think about and employ a complete (and correct) moral philosophy. Those under the illusion of the ‘Platonic fantasy’ (primarily philosophers), according to Hursthouse, inaccurately ascribe philosophical reasoning to the virtuous agent, including “fancy”<<ref "24">>  terminology, abstract ethical structures, universal principle-based reflection, and formal //moral knowledge//. 

	Hursthouse is convinced the Platonic fantasy fails to capture the psychological makeup and sort of ‘X reasoning’ of the virtuous agent. As a matter of //brute fact//, Hursthouse claims: 

<<<
Of course people can be virtuous, really virtuous, without having spent clockable hours thinking about eudaimonia, coming to the conclusion that it is a life lived in accordance with the virtues and working out an account of acting well, just as they can possess a really good will without having spent clockable hours working out whether various maxims can be willed as universal laws.<<ref "25">>
<<<

	To Hursthouse, this is //obviously //true. Assuming philosophical reasoning does require clockable hours, the “absurdity of the [Platonic] fantasy”<<ref "26">>  is consequently also obviously true to her. The virtuous agent doesn’t necessarily ‘reason’ or philosophize, according to Hursthouse. Hursthouse states that “the ascription of virtue…is basic.”<<ref "27">>  Unfortunately, Hursthouse isn’t very clear about what she means by this basic ascription to the virtuous agent. She does explain:

<<<
Loving the noble, having a correct conception of eudaimonia and a grasp of the universal acting well, are not tests for virtue, or the grounds on which we ascribe virtue, nor are they the specification of an ideal of virtue to which everyone should aspire.<<ref "28">>
<<<

So, while Hursthouse fails to describe (in detail) what she believes are necessary and sufficient sort of psychological and rational conditions to be a virtuous agent, I know she believes that philosophical thought is neither necessary nor sufficient. The basic moral reasoning of the virtuous agent is non-philosophical.

	Hursthouse covers all the ‘Platonic fantasy’ bases when she reiterates Broadie’s extension of the fantasy from the conscious mind to the unconscious mind. She explains we cannot even implicitly ascribe the Platonic fantasy to the virtuous person.<<ref "29">>  Virtue isn’t just compatible with philosophical inarticulacy; it is also compatible with lacking tacit and implicit philosophical knowledge, intuition, and reasoning. Hursthouse is claiming that philosophical knowledge, conscious or unconscious, is unnecessary for a virtuous agent. 

For Hursthouse, the Platonic fantasy is easy to slip into; she explains why many philosophers are under the illusion of the Platonic fantasy:

<<<
If we philosophers were to think of ordinary virtuous people as possessing these ‘fancy’ things, we would have a better philosophical understanding of various topics that interest us—moral motivation, moral reasoning, practical wisdom, a correct conception of eudaimonia, virtue itself.<<ref "30">>
<<<
	
	She thinks moral philosophy is ‘actually’ done because it piques our interest. Perhaps we (the philosophers) are tempted to incorrectly ascribe the activity of philosophy to the virtuous agent as a necessary (and, for some, also sufficient) condition to being virtuous because it might benefit us as philosophers. To Hursthouse, philosophers use formal moral reasoning to describe the virtuous agent because they believe they are “saying something illuminating and important.”<<ref "31">>  I take it that Hursthouse is saying that it is all too easy for a philosopher of ethics to delude himself into thinking he is doing something really worthwhile, something which will help him attain not just knowledge about morality, but even help him (and those who listen to him) perform better practical and applied moral reasoning and perhaps become like, think as, be motivated for the same reasons as, and act like the virtuous agent. 

Noteworthy, it is //possible //that some virtuous agent, by happenstance, is also a moral philosopher who possesses “an explicit, comprehensive, substantial vision of the good.”<<ref "32">>  Being a moral philosopher, however, is neither necessary nor sufficient for the coincidentally virtuous moral philosopher to be morally motivated.<<ref "33">>

	In conclusion, Hursthouse believes philosophical moral reasoning is not a necessary part of moral motivation or a required for virtue.

''[2b]''

Hursthouse’s claim is much stronger than saying that virtue and moral motivation are compatible with philosophical inarticulacy.<<ref "34">>  She’s denying the necessity of not only conscious and explicit philosophical reasoning to be morally motivated and to be a virtuous agent, but also the subconscious, intuitive, and ‘difficult to make explicit’ philosophical reasoning. Hursthouse, in my view, is dismissing the need for moral philosophy in its entirety. Hursthouse would clearly disagree with the following claim:

<<<
The Platonic fantasy is no fantasy. It is utterly crucial if we are to perform our task as moral philosophers – in short, the nature of philosophy itself rides on the alleged fantasy.<<ref "35">>
<<<

	The denial of the above claim is pretty shocking, especially coming from a moral philosopher. If the Platonic fantasy really is a fantasy, then why in the world would a person pursue moral philosophy at all? Why did Hursthouse write this book? (Because it interested her?) If philosophical moral reasoning doesn’t help us and others on the path to becoming better moral agents, then there doesn’t really seem to be much of a purpose to (moral) philosophy. If moral theories are strictly incapable of actually describing moral experience and the moral universe, then can we really say that the virtuous person employs knowledge? The sort of knowledge that would come from moral philosophy is somehow not very useful to the virtuous agent (or to those seeking to become virtuous). If this is the case, wouldn’t moral philosophy, in Hursthouse’s eyes, be somewhat like memorizing prime numbers? Sure, having these prime numbers memorized might help you pass a test one day in your number theory class, but it is generally useless otherwise. Like memorizing prime numbers, if Hursthouse is correct, it seems as though moral philosophy is generally useless.

	 I think it is one thing to claim that modern moral philosophy is inaccurate (a charitable way to read this, in my opinion) and another to dismiss it altogether. If Hursthouse would claim that the correct virtue theory itself is much simpler than the complexity we see in modern moral theories (again, the depth of the arguments she has given in this book would demonstrate otherwise), then I could make more sense of her claim that moral philosophy (as we currently think about it) is useless to the virtuous agent or those seeking to be virtuous. 

	Hursthouse has (momentarily) forgotten what it means to do ‘philosophy’ in the first place. By definition, philosophy is about good reasoning, about pursuing truth, and about gaining wisdom. Whether a truth is extremely complex or simple, the good philosopher will pursue it because moral philosophy is about pursuing and possessing moral knowledge. Philosophers (at least ‘good’ or proper ones) develop, argue about, and use moral theories to try to describe the moral (aspect of the) universe; they do this because they wish to know the moral universe (morality) in order to become better moral agents (to become like the virtuous agent!). It is assumed by most moral philosophers (perhaps excepting Broadie and Hursthouse) that becoming virtuous is a rational process, not an irrational or random one, hence why we (should) do moral philosophy. If morality wasn’t strictly rational, then you could not be responsible for it. 

The virtuous agent does have moral knowledge. Hursthouse thinks so. How is this sort of knowledge not philosophical? How is it not rational and well-reasoned? Surely it must be. Does she just mean ‘true belief’ rather than knowledge?

	Let’s assume that possessing knowledge is the possession of justified true belief (just as Aristotle’s teacher assumed; and, arguably, Aristotle’s explanation of episteme in his Posterior Analytics implies). The moral philosopher, who is pursuing moral knowledge, is interested in having justified, true moral beliefs. Hursthouse admits that having the correct moral belief is essential to being morally motivated and a necessary component to the psychology of the virtuous agent.<<ref "36">>  If the virtuous agent is justified in his true moral belief, then, essentially, he has the object of moral philosophy, namely moral knowledge. If we are to assume that the virtuous agent must be justified in his true belief, then it would seem that moral philosophy, in this sense, is absolutely necessary to becoming a virtuous agent. Perhaps modern moral theories are wrong, but that doesn’t mean that moral philosophy is unnecessary.

	If the JTB assumption is correct, then the only way for Hursthouse to dismiss moral philosophy as she does would be to claim that the virtuous agent is not justified in his true belief, and thus doesn’t have moral knowledge. If this were true, then the virtuous belief isn’t necessarily reasonable. If this is the objection, we must realize that the virtuous agent did not think about his beliefs, he just ‘magically’ had them. Randomly stumbling upon the correct (but unjustified) moral beliefs, and acting from them (rather than from a duty deduced from reason), seems to take away from the moral worth of an agent’s action, in my view. 

	Heeding the Platonic fantasy is necessary if we are going to say that the virtuous person employs rationality, at least implicitly, to be morally motivated. Moral philosophy, even if not as complex or sophisticated as many modern moral theories, is certainly something which the virtuous agent must be doing, and the activity necessary for becoming virtuous.

Before closing, I would like to defend a possible spirit of Hursthouse’s argument, namely that virtuous agents may have difficulty explicitly articulating their thoughts. Given one’s understanding of the philosophy of mind, language, and intentionality (for example, if you deny some forms of pragmatism and expressivism), it is certainly reasonable to consider the possibility that a virtuous agent’s philosophical framework and motivation is in part intuitive and subconscious, and that, to some extent, the agent isn’t mentally and physically capable of articulating their beliefs. Obviously, Hursthouse said much more than this, but I think she may have hit on something pretty important in dissecting the psychology of the virtuous agent.

''[3a]''

Hursthouse spends a great deal of time describing the ‘degree’ paradigm of her virtue theory. She believes that virtues, beliefs, feelings, character traits, and practical wisdom admit of degree.  She says there are “a variety of ways in which people are not, ethically, all of a piece,” which complicates, but does not demonstrate, disunity of the virtues.<<ref "37">>

As Hursthouse sees it, the virtues are not “completely discrete, isolable character traits.”<<ref "38">>  The essential idea behind the doctrine of the unity of the virtues is that “to have any individual virtue one must have them all.”<<ref "39">>  Her theory is derived from Aristotle’s; he explains:

<<<
One might on these lines meet the dialectical argument by which it would be contended that the virtues exist independently of each other, on the ground that the same man is not equally well endowed by nature in respect of them all, so that he will be the possessor of one, but not yet the possessor of another. As far as the natural virtues are concerned, this is possible; but it is not possible when the virtues are those that entitle a person to be called good without qualification; for the possession of the single virtue of practical wisdom will carry with it the possession of them all.<<ref "40">>
<<<
  
	Strict reading would lead us to believe that possession of the full set of those moral virtues which aren’t practical wisdom (to what degree isn’t clear) is a necessary condition for possession of practical or moral wisdom. Hursthouse builds upon this, and, in my view, qualifies the unity beyond what Aristotle is saying right here. I believe Hursthouse extends this to mean that the virtues which are connected to practical wisdom (exactly how, I’m not sure) are the sort which can’t be independently understood apart from each other; inevitably, she will arrive at the notion that possession of any single virtue (not just practical wisdom) ‘will carry with it the possession of them all’. There is a holistic, codependent, perhaps even interdefining nature to the moral virtues. Consider what Hursthouse says:

<<<
 [‘Courage’ and ‘temperance’] are not excellences of character, not traits that, by their very nature, make their possessor good and issue in good conduct. They can be faults or flaws rather than excellences and they can lead their possessors to act badly.<<ref "41">>
<<<
 
	To isolate courage, and to apply it independently of the other virtues, especially independent of practical wisdom, seems to (at least sometimes) result in faults and flaws, in Hursthouse’s view. Independently then, these aren’t virtues at all, and because of this, I believe she considers (although ultimately concludes a unity stronger than) two ‘connective’ claims about the virtues. 

The first (and weaker claim) is the interconnectivity of the non-wisdom virtues, and the insufficiency of the sum of the non-wisdom virtues to result in ‘excellence of character’ and full virtue. If courage is not moderated by the virtue of temperance, then the feelings of fear and confidence may be skewed to extreme excess or defect, resulting in rashness or cowardice. It seems a necessary condition for the ‘excellence of character’ that each of the various moral virtues (momentarily, we will exclude practical wisdom from this set) have something to say about at least some of the other virtues. To what extent, and in what way, I am not exactly sure how Hursthouse thinks. So, to be properly charitable (so as to move a step closer towards excellence of character), the character trait of charity may require, borrow from, and be regulated by other sorts of virtues such as kindness or perhaps the sort of righteousness required to be aware of the misfortunes of our neighbors. 

It seem as though even more is required, however, for courage to be appropriately applied in the right situations, in the right way, at the right time, etc. The non-wisdom virtues, despite their interdependence, are not sufficient (although certainly necessary) for being fully virtuous. Hursthouse continues:

<<<
What this way of thinking about the virtues omits is the Aristotelian idea that each of the virtues involves practical wisdom, the ability to reason correctly about practical matters…The same sorts of judgments about goods and evils, benefits and harms, what is worthwhile and what is relatively unimportant crop up across the ranges.<<ref "42">>
<<<

This is the second (and stronger) ‘connectivity’ claim she considers. Practical wisdom seems to be the driving cognitive force and supervisory device behind the other virtues. This wisdom perceives the world appropriately; it makes sense of ‘what is what’; it is the locus of judgment and value determination; and, most importantly to the unity of the virtues, it governs the other virtues.  Pertaining to the unity of the virtues, the virtuous agent’s practical wisdom includes knowing how to properly connect and apply the sum of the various virtues in the proper situations and in the proper ways. 

So while the other moral virtues impact each other to some degree, they aren’t the masters of themselves; it appears that practical wisdom has very profound regulating powers over the other moral virtues. We do know that ‘excellence of character’ is the possession of practical wisdom, which will necessarily include the other moral virtues. Possessing the non-wisdom virtues is necessary for possessing practical wisdom, but we don’t yet know if they are sufficient for possessing practical wisdom, according to Hursthouse. Practical wisdom holds a very special place in Hursthouse’s virtue theory. Hursthouse concludes:

<<<
So it seems that what we believe in is what Neera Badhwar calls ‘the limited unity’ of the virtues and Gary Watson ‘the weak unity thesis’. This is a view that simultaneously recognizes the fact that practical wisdom cannot occur in discrete packages, limited in its area of competence to just this virtue or that, and also the fact that it is not an all-or-nothing matter. According to this thesis, anyone who possesses one virtue will have all the others to some degree, albeit, in some cases, a pretty limited one.<<ref "43">>
<<<

Vitally, Hursthouse explains that the possession of any proper virtue (not just practical wisdom) includes all the others (to some degree). For example, to properly have courage requires practical wisdom, and to have practical wisdom is to have at least some degree of all the other virtues. In this sense, ‘isolated courage’ isn’t courage at all; only the sort of courage which necessarily includes (some degree of) all the other virtues is really what Hursthouse means by courage. Note that Hursthouse’s ‘weak unity thesis’ is still stronger than just holding the two previous connectivity claims (although, the essence of these connective issues are still found within her doctrine of the unity of the virtues). 

What is clear about Hursthouse’s weak unity thesis is that one virtue necessitates them all, to some degree.  What is unclear about Hursthouse’s weak unity thesis is ‘to what degree’. The various connections between the virtues, and particularly the impact of practical wisdom in this equation, have not been fully fleshed out in her account of the unity of the virtues.

Hursthouse is denying the ‘all-or-nothing’ of the moral metrics in her virtue theory; instead she employs a ‘degree paradigm’, and this sort of degree-based argumentation is prominent within her weak unity of the virtues thesis. Each of the virtues can be possessed in (differing) degrees. Given what she says, there are some awkward and unintuitive results. [Objection #1] One of my problems with her weak unity thesis is that it results in the possibility of some extremely //implausible //agents who possess wildly imbalanced character distributions.
 
Consider how a hypothetical person in Hursthouse’s weak unity thesis might possess 98% charity, and only 1% of the other virtues, such as courage, temperance, kindness, etc. This seems implausible to my own intuitions. It is certainly explainable and possible in Hursthouse’s theory, but this sort of hypothetical doesn’t seem plausible or an acceptably possible result of a theory from my own moral experience.  (Admittedly, my intuitions could be wrong.) 

Her conception of the unity of virtues isn’t accurate enough. It seems to me that every situation requires all the virtues simultaneously. In short, [Objection #2] the virtues are too isolable in her theory. On one hand, she considers how the virtues are connected, and thinks they help to define and regulate each other, but on the hand, she thinks of particular situations as requiring (e.g.) ‘courage + practical wisdom’ or ‘charity + practical wisdom’ almost exclusively, as if we really can isolate most of the morally relevant factors of a situation as mostly requiring an isolated virtue alongside practical wisdom. Her theory does not do a good job explaining why the other virtues are necessary to these situations. She does ‘isolate’ the character traits to some //degree//. I don’t think she justifies it though.

	My theory of the unity of the virtues: there is only practical wisdom. All the other virtues are found inside practical wisdom. I think isolating character traits and specific moral virtues (other than wisdom) makes no sense whatsoever; I’m not convinced the non-wisdom virtues actually exist in this sense. I want to say that the situations which some people say require ‘courage’ are really situations in which practical wisdom is manifested so as to appear like courage. Practical wisdom is the only virtue, though. In my view, this is a much stronger unity thesis than what Hursthouse provides. The (so-called) ‘moral virtues’ either don’t exist at all or they are identical with wisdom (depending on how you want to look at it). Wisdom isn’t just the virtue, to the virtue ethicist, __virtue is wisdom__.

	Explaining Hursthouse’s views on practical wisdom would be its own paper (and beyond the scope of this question). I likely have a different view of what is meant by ‘wisdom’ -- so, in order to clarify what I mean by ‘virtue is wisdom’ (sounds like a modified “virtue is knowledge,” answering //akrasia//, etc., no?), let me first explain what I mean by wisdom (what I mean by practical and moral wisdom).
 
First, wisdom is rational thought about what is valuable, what is worth pursing, what one ought to do, what is right, the objective moral world. Moral thought and knowledge comprise the first half of Wisdom. Clearly, this isn’t a character trait by itself. To say a person is wise requires more than just moral knowledge and thought, it also requires that an agent reliably chooses and acts from this moral knowledge and thought. From my perspective, in order to explain ‘wisdom’ as a character trait, we need to add the element of the //will//.
 
The second half of wisdom is choosing to act (including mental acts) from and because of what you know is morally right. After all, the man with moral knowledge who doesn’t choose to act from it isn’t the sort I want to call ‘wise’. Wisdom, as the virtuous character, is about both moral knowledge/thought and willing it. 

Colloquially, we speak of wisdom as a type of knowledge. Insofar as one transmits moral knowledge, but doesn’t need to act on it (let us say that my grandfather was explaining a wise thing to me), we can call it ‘wisdom’ without will. But, wisdom as a character trait still requires reliably willing from moral knowledge. What exactly we mean by ‘reliable’ is cashed out in terms of averages and some broad temporal scope for which I’m unable to give an account (at this point). 

As you can see, crucial to my view of virtue ethics, particularly about how the unity of virtues relates to decision/action, is my disagreement with Hursthouse’s view of the primacy of the virtuous character. I agree with Hursthouse in claiming there are ‘degrees of virtue’. For example, one might be 38% virtuous, but that is just a result of an average of the rightness (and morally worth) of the decisions/actions for which one is responsible. Virtue, of course, is a measurement over time – in part a measurement of an agent’s reliability. In my view, the atomic elements (individual choices/smallest units of moral experience) which comprise the ‘virtuous character’ equation are the primitive objects of moral theory, not the resulting measurement. So, I agree to an absolute unity of the virtues (plainly, wisdom), but I don’t hold wise/virtuous character, as a measurement, to be primitive. 

	Note that my theory avoids the two objections I made about Hursthouse’s theory. I avoid my second objection to Hursthouse because my theory does not isolate the various moral virtues to any degree. Consequently, I also avoid my first objection. There are no wildly imbalanced and totally implausible characters as a result of my unity of virtue theory. There is merely an ‘appearance’ of charitable agents; actually, there are simply wise agents.  In this, we have no resulting 98% charity, and 1% of the other virtues. Talking of degrees of plain and totally unified wisdom or virtue, in this sense, seems intuitively more plausible to me.
