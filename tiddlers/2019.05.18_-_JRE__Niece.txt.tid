How has your day been?
SAT 9:24 PM
Rebecca's niece is staying the night.  I'm finding it hard to be fun and engaging.
SAT 10:23 PM
I don't know the extent to which you are obligated to entertain her. It's probably hard to connect with someone her age. I can barely hold a 2-minute conversation with most children.
SAT 10:25 PM
Unless it's on a topic of interest to both of us.
SAT 10:26 PM
I bet she is still having a good time though.
SAT 10:26 PM
She staying over for fun or cause her parents needed a sitter for the night?
SAT 10:26 PM
For fun
SAT 10:51 PM
Cool. =)
