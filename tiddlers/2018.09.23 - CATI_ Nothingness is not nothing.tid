title: 2018.09.23 - CATI: Nothingness is not nothing

Whatever it paradoxically means to say it: nothingness is not nothing. It's why evil as a privation of good is somehow real. The scholastics scream to us about it. They have no idea how to talk about it, and neither do I.

We're somewhere in [[The Grand Dialectic]], at the bottom of what we can understand. Exactly how the Being of Becoming exists and what it means, even as a mere phenomenological illusion to we [[fff]] physical creatures in this temporary physical universe, is a fundamental question. I regret that I can only point.
