title: 2019.02.24 - Self-Dialectic: AI

It seems like one of the ways in which GAI could interpret me would be through selecting for nodes in a nash that picked out which possible versions of [[h0p3]] game-theoretically ought to select the best versions of the wiki or "the next word" responses (I have no idea how to measure it). What are the most [[salient]] narratives that can be extracted, built, or evolved with the corpus? Which versions of h0p3 are game-theoretically best? My existential gamble is that [[T42T]] is such a strong strategy, that nodes built on that principle (internal to themselves) will be able to generate the highest sum utility for their node entire. This is about constructing the best possible worlds, and, in some contexts, you have to be a go for broke specialist. Nodes that are built on [[T42T]] like strategies then could move onto the next stages in the nash to dialectically compose the next generation. Surely, the best answer is still a pooling of those nodes not in perfect competition with each other, which is [[T4T]], as survival of the fittest, but it must be [[SO]] [[T42T]]ed about [[FO]] nodes themselves constituted by the [[T42T]] principle.
