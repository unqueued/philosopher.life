I applaud some of the work my donors have done. Sometimes, I feel like Jon Snow with them. You're sending your soldiers in the wrong direction. You've completely misunderstood the real enemy. You aren't fighting the right war, in the right place, at the right time. It's a triage problem. They do not ultimately understand how to interpret Paul and Christ.

Kids and I spent a lot of time talking about Alpha Zero. Excellent discussion.

JRE and I had an interesting discussion yesterday. Essentially, he is worried that his SO doesn't take the time debate with him, to solve significant problems, or care about who he ethically is or becomes in important ways. It seems like a commitment issue and perhaps a respecting personhood one as well. He was very upset by it, and I told him to think about it, write about it, and to make sure that he says it well to her. She needs time to think about it too. He already knew this, I think. He just needed a sounding board, and that makes sense. It's very difficult, and he very much loves her and wants to do it well.

That recent stunning article on the illusions of consciousness was outstanding, but I am now convinced they really didn't even come close to answering the hard problem of consciousness as much as they thought they did.

Why the fuck do I still call [[JRE]] by JRE on this wiki. He obviously deserves a lifehacker name. He is part of the family I would and do choose.

Seems like Al Franken was targeted. All Democrats are being targeted, but this was extra juicy. Franken was the most outspoken critic of anti-net-neutrality.
