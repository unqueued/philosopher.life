!! Define //Pornography//

Despite it's etymology, I think it's a broad concept. Pornography is art which arouses us, objects which cause us to lust, or media which is socially forbidden fruit. It has the same connotative problem as the distinction between dependency and addiction (and, of course, can be related). I'm not sure what can't be pornography, and it seems to scale and be relativized to individuals and social groups in context.

As they say, "I know it when I see it," but it is fairly hard to define in a meaningful way. I think this shows we don't want to engage in hardcore conceptual analysis on the topic because we know the conclusions will not be satisfactory, and it may rule out large swathes of our life. It is a weasel word.
