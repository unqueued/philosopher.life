title: 2017.07.24 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Alarm clock woke me. I needed more sleep. I wasn't able to sleep until midnight.
* I put on my new clothes, Pushed a Brick, and packed my lunch. 
* I didn't even need GPS at all today (ironically, I'm starting at a new place tomorrow).
* I worked my ass off. I even took a picture of my work. I need to make sure I graft it in.
** I need to start creating a portfolio.
* I talked to JRE. It was good to hear his voice.
** He walks me through a lot of what happens through the day. I appreciate that very much. He has a lot of insight into the tropes of construction workers.
* I tried calling my brother AIR. I couldn't reach him. =(
* Finished S6 GoT
* Fireman Time
* I called my wife. It was wonderful to hear her voice. She was obviously distressed. The kids hadn't done their work. 
** I had spoken with the children at lunch. They just stopped afterwards. Maybe I shouldn't have?
* I almost fell asleep. I hope to fall asleep early tonight.
* I talked to ALM on chat.
** He lost his credentials, and I can't reset them from afar very easily. Need to find a way to help him automagically do it or make it self-serveable.
* I called my chilluns up.
** It was not a pleasant conversation. They disappointed me today.
** I hope I was useful to them; I hope I was motivational, a voice of reason, and empathic. 
* Watched the first episode of Legion. 
** It was gorgeous, even if the plot sucked. The craziness was interesting. The cinematography had some genius going on sometimes. I loved exactly what my wife said I would love about it.
* Gonna write and watch something before I fall asleep.
* I ate a ton of fruits and vegetables today. =)
