It seems obvious that one of the reasons pleasurable activities are censored, prevented, or pushed against by those in power is that they desperately want to limit the channels to happiness to those which they control.

You must collect knowledge your entire life to be wise. Importantly, it is harder and harder to become wise because there is more and more each passing day which one must necessarily know in order to be wise. Post-modernism, hello, there.

My brother doesn't want to see his parents as evil. He doesn't want me to see the letters. He doesn't want to be fully redpilled about who they are. I think he feels there is a triangle, and I hope he doesn't resent me for it. My wife suggests I let him lead the way. I'm not here to push him. I'm here to catch him if he falls and encourage him, to be his listener. I'm listening to you, [[JRE]].
