title: 2018.02.20 -- Computer Musings: Sync

I finally have it running for my wife! I installed a shadowsocks gui client for her and pointed it at ATL. I had to uninstall Resilio Sync (because it just doesn't play nice in Windows 10) and reinstall. It worked after that. Everything is setup to autorun. I changed the Synkron to still backup to Dropbox for her on both machines, but Dropbox is just a backup slave now. I ran tests on both ends. It works great. I also setup wiki syncs across the board for her. It will be up to her if she wants more than that (depends on her privacy preferences).
