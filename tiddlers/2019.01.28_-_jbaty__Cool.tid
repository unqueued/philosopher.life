Watching conversations between you and sphygmus has been inspirational. It's like a private conversation, held in public, and that is fascinating.

I agree it is a highly personal conversation (normally private) held in public. I would also argue there are pragmatically private aspects to it mostly having to do with the amount of effort we both put into understanding each other. I think it can be hard to see how all the signs and signals add up without having jumped in to develop the "gotten my hands dirty" goggles and done both the explorative hyperreading and closer deepreading work.

 It's as if there is a communal bulletin board and we just pin notes to it for each other. Cool!

That is an excellent starting picture. A decentrally hosted, semi-automated communal bulletin board, yes. =) I appreciate how we own our data in the practice. I think there is a lot of translation and mapping-onto kinds of work that a bulletin board (including some arbitrary number of pins, pointers, and strings) might capture too (I realize metaphors will always be limited). That's where it really shines, imho. Sometimes I like to think of it as two rhizomatic [[Root]] systems or hyperobjects entangling and bonding with each other in the open desert (but even that metaphor seems to be lacking).

To be honest, my initial desire was simply to test the mechanism of communication via wiki, and you seem to be somewhat a pioneer in the area. But, I've now been following the changes to your wiki on a nearly daily basis and now I'm just enjoying the ride, as it were. There need not be any capital-R Relationship but I do enjoy what we've done so far, and I hope it can continue, even if only sporadically.

I'm very glad for your honesty—to just have your thoughts succinctly, rather than to beat around the bush for three months. The invitation is soft—no need to get involved with anything. Focus on your work. I’d rather be of a benefit, if that can possibly be the case. I'm open to [[T42T]] however we can.

It's been a pleasure so far,

Yes, it has been a pleasure so far. It may be useful for you to know where I'm coming from as well: I do not engage in writing my wiki or Relationships (either to or with myself or [[others]]) for the hedonic pursuit of pleasure (I'm not implying you do either). Obviously, pleasure is valuable to me, but it is not the driving force; it's not why this matters. That may make casual relationships with me somewhat jarring.
