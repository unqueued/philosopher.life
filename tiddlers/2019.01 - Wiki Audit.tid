!! Audit:

* Mixed bag here. Cool!
* I stopped doing it again. Fuck me.
** This is too often the most important log on the wiki.
*** Life is overwhelming. If all you can do it write, then do that. There is only so much you can do.
* [[FTO]] has been burning me out and building this wiki out hard. It's explosive.
* It's more changeloggy than usual. There's not a lot of planning or progress. 
* It breaks my heart not to continue [[The Remodeling]].
** WAIT! I SEE IT! Bob has killed off my tooling for shaping. I need to turn Bob off to do [[The Remodeling]] until I can replace TiddlyTool (which probably aint going to happen). The fact is that there is too much friction.
*** Most people have absolutely nothing like the amount of remodeling work I have to do. They'll have one-time shit to do. I have billions of big and tiny things to do, to normalize, to find equilibrium, to get in a habitual rut, etc.
* I made the upgrade to 5.1.19, and I've been stuck again. I cannot get CSS and TW5-Navigator to work.
** I hate to say it, but I may switch back to vanilla to bring back navigator. It's a function prioritized over form issue. I absolutely need to become adept with keyboard navigation in this space.
* I've been having tons of Bob troubles and leaks, but I have adored using it.
* The Yearly Audit turned out much better. It's clear to me [[The Remodeling]] takes huge pressures off it.
* Well, I might not be able to do you now, but I will someday. `/salute`
