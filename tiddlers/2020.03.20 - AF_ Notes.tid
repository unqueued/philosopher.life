What books do you recommmend?

- Bauhaus

---

I want to teach you how to see the world from your own point of view. The goal is to maintain your individuality while having learned the foundations.

After school, he went right back to basics. Geometry. Observational paintings. Abstract paintings too. Built from square one. Lots of phases as an artist. Discourages imitation. 

Why not look through college art requirements and pick up the curriculum ourselves to whatever extent we can? 

It's all about learning about objects in space.

---

Without the negative, you aren't going to have the positive. Argues they are equally as important. The man doesn't intend it, but he's whispering to me coincidentally.

---

This program changes the way you see, and artists see differently. You might not even know how you are seeing and thinking differently.

House as cube, grow the notion. Reductive compression, deconstruction. How the architects designed on top of this basic shape. 

The Teddy Bear can be seen as just a bunch of ovals, cylinders in space, shortening them, stacking them, etc. 

---

His own children never learned art. He said they never asked to learn how to paint, so he didn't force them to do it. We are on the same page to some crucial extent here.

I am curious to know how much my daughter really has to learn about the man. I don't know if she has learned anything new here, but having a friend, mentor, and guide can't hurt, imho. Having a teacher besides us in her life might help. This is quite an opportunity for her to connect with someone 

There is another 14yo girl who is homeschooled that draws a lot of characters as well. I've given permission to try and connect us with this girl. Hopefully, we'll hear back soon.

---

My daughter should go through our art history books. At least basic familiarity might buy her some examples and terms to express her point of view with other people who care for art.

---

Acrylic Paints, pastels, markers, colored pencils. Cheap. 

Purchasing our own supplies otherwise. 

Color Theory seems to be exceptionally important to this man, how they create emotions. He calls it drawing with color. I like that plainness. 

Doesn't push technique too much. Does it in an overall way, but doesn't aim to be too specific. 

---

Part of the strength of working with him, imho, will be his ability to pick out something related [[irwartfrr]] in a real-time fashion or at least to point.

His brother used to be an actor in film, but he didn't want to act later. Started up iano instead at 60.


Conceptualism

Postmodernism is what we are in right now 

Art tries to copy science.  Started with the impressionists. Studied light, dots of color, breaking it down. They tried to atomize it. If you imagine it before, a quick summary fo the theory image before you have the whole being called art. Look at a Rembrandt, there were no isms. There was just the renaissance. So an artist was using color, form, light, composition, expression, energy, in the work...

Artists didn't start with themselves, they started with where the other guy left off, and that is just like science in developing theories.  What happened over 80 years, the branches were broken off. 

Then you just end up with ideas, which is conceptualism. The general public lost what was happening in art. What were they doing? 

"Well I could do that"

Pomo, everyone becomes themselves. They paint who they are and what they are. The digital world might be the next ism in his eyes. Doesn't know. Can't really describe it. Still seems like conceptualism. 

Romanticism. Expressionistic means.
