title: 2019.07.27 - JRE: WoW Baby

My brother called me. He's hanging in there. No limerence or attachment (fairly normal even for biological parents), but he's being a good dad to that baby. Takes years to develop a relationship, and he's being hard on himself. Rebecca is eating it up, and he's not enjoying it beyond small increments. He's feeling like he's not pulling his weight, but I think he is. 

We talked about AM, [[AIR]], and similar conversations. We talked about Kant and moral merit. I hope he will go easy on himself here. 

We talked about WoW. I'm super excited for it. He has an AOE leveling build. I've been focusing on end stage PvP builds and understanding the theory in a vacuum. He doesn't want to do the PvP server, understandably. I'm going to play with him.
