title: 2018.07.20 - JRE: Still Thinking

Talked about his work. Bar was fun, but he left anyways.

It's hard to be a reminder [[irwartfrr]] here because I just dive into the deep end of the pool every time. I will continue to do my thinking then, but I'll try not to say it often to him (which isn't easy, but I must try). I'm not sure how to peel apart my wiki from our IRL relationship, but I'll do whatever I can for him as best I can. The [[Wiki Litmus Test]] ultimately does have a cost, but his social bank account with me is extensive. I know I don't want talking with him about myself or my view of him to be painful to him. I fear the day may come where it will only be that way.

This is partly where I am with L, I think. I'm not convinced she really does want to dig, but that means I'll be digging without her. I can only offer her my best wishes, my bridges, my thanks, my kindnesses in parting with the other nomad. I hope we grow together instead though. If we don't, then I think eventually they will confront their deserts, and I fear I will be continents away. Hopefully, this wiki is a semantic transporter bridge so we can be in the desert together.

He agrees he's in a fight for his life, and I have begged him to truly fight for it far harder than he has. Shrink the gigantic Seldon crisis down to 1 millenium instead of 20. I fear he is too passive about the "inevitable," and that he isn't anxious enough to survive (which is far less than resolving) it. He's letting life just "happen to him" more than he should, it feels. 

I argued that having a soulmate (and likely even a family) is part of sufficiently achieving eudaimonia for most humans, including those in his contexts. I gestured to the hedonic problems and relationships to egoistic eudaimonia. I get it. He is disappointed that having Raylan didn't help him feel that deep sense of purpose again, a kind of certainty and simplicity that he'll never achieve again. It's always going to be a struggle now. 

I told him he reminds me of Camus. We are dealing with the worry of suicide. He is already experiencing ideation, instrusive thoughts, and the morbidity of meaninglessness. I'm begging him to fight because the spiral is already there; he's on it.
