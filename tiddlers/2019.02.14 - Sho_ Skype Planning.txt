I never really heard back from him (I realize, I'm one weird mofo, and he shouldn't feel obligated).

THU 12:44 PM
i think the concept of conversing personally with someone he hasnae met personally is just culturally-foreign to him

what we should do sometime, tho gods know when because we leave here (friends' place where there is unlimited internet) tomorrow morning, but the four of us should have a skype chat or something
THU 12:45 PM
so he can 'meet' you, and [[k0sh3k]]
THU 12:45 PM
it's possible he'll be more receptive if he feels he's 'met' you or kens you a little
THU 12:45 PM
