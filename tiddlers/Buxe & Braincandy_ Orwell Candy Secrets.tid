Take one, please. 

Who are you when no one is watching? When and why do you have a moral right to privacy, anonymity, or deception against other agents? Are all identities valid? When is violence morally obligated? What counts as treating [[The Other]] as mere means? What ought you do, and who ought you be? 

Sacrificially study and apply [[The Golden Rule]] with everything you have in you. [[Good]]will is a priceless [[gem]]; it may cost you everything you have in the days to come.

Who are you?
