Your son sounds scared for you.  This more than a cold?
Jan 12 3:35pm
I'm not feeling well at all.
Jan 12 3:36pm
Pulling muscles I'm coughing so hard.
Jan 12 3:36pm
Can't sleep.
Jan 12 3:36pm
eyes are puffing up, and we don't know what the cause is. Trying to get the doctor, but our paperwork hasn't been completed (even though we are covered).
Jan 12 3:37pm
It was a cold for a while, but it seems to be getting worse rather than better, and I have a history of lung and throat problems (pneumonia, asthma, allergies, that one time I went to the hospital for vaginosis, strepp so bad I peed blood, etc.).
Jan 12 3:38pm
It gets better during the day, but at night, kinda a hell. Good news is that I don't have any serious pressure to do anything. All the major work for our timetable is done, so it's okay that I'm not there.
Jan 12 3:39pm
May be something to do with the apartment, since that's when it started. Section 8 housing, and they trashed it. Might be an allergy. I seem to do better when I'm not in the house.
Jan 12 3:39pm
Doh.  Hopefully not mold in the house.
Jan 12 3:43pm
Aye. Will be building papertrail with landlord here soon.
Jan 12 3:43pm
Rough start, sorry :(
Jan 12 3:44pm
You try benadryl to rule out allergies?
Jan 12 3:45pm
Two kinds of antihistamines. Might be helping some.
Jan 12 3:45pm
Shit
Jan 12 3:46pm
Sorry, that sucks
