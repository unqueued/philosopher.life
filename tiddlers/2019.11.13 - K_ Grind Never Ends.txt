Looks pretty decent so far. Our old car might be dead; going to ghetto tow it up to the house later tonight.
Nov 13, 2019 11:37am
Best $1800 I've ever spent. Lasted forever.
Nov 13, 2019 11:37am
 I hope you have a great day. How's the paperwriting going?
Nov 13, 2019 11:38am
I feel that. Are you going to secure a new one anytime soon?
Nov 13, 2019 11:39am
Good! I think Iâ€™m making solid progress on everytitnt.
Nov 13, 2019 11:39am
Everything
Nov 13, 2019 11:40am
Wow
Nov 13, 2019 11:40am
Meh. Just have the SUV and hope it lasts.
Nov 13, 2019 11:40am
Noice on the progress.
Nov 13, 2019 11:40am
I need one professor to approve my topic and another to assign it then I can do the rest of the semesterâ€™s work.
Nov 13, 2019 11:41am
You are on the ball. I'm super jelly, lol.
Nov 13, 2019 12:39pm
Donâ€™t be. Iâ€™m so strung out. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Nov 13, 2019 12:45pm
You are in a difficult stretch. I hope you are getting enough sleep (tough to do). I'm practically useless to you over here, but I am happy to help you however I can. I'm rarely useful to you on your work (beyond wishing your professor would let you just say more, lol), but if you want another eye, I'll make sure to hand feedback to you asap.
Nov 13, 2019 12:48pm
Iâ€™m getting more! My breathing issues are still persisting though. Iâ€™m taking care not to push too hard. 

I would love an extra set of eyes!
Nov 13, 2019 12:56pm
Also youâ€™re probably more helpful than you realize. I already appreciate the perspective you bring to the table. It almost always deepens my understanding of the material.

Have a great day today. :)
Nov 14, 2019 9:51am
You too, homie.
Nov 14, 2019 9:51am
What are your plans for today?
Nov 14, 2019 9:52am
Library-workin, homework-workin, and raid-workin

The grind never ends.
Nov 14, 2019 9:53am
You guys?
Nov 14, 2019 9:53am
Lol.

[[k0sh3k]]'s working on securing funding for the move and work. Then we have our evening together.
Nov 14, 2019 10:16am
My friend Sphygmus recommended //Crashing// (UK). It was excellent. Kind of like Mr. Bean has sex with //Friends//. You might check it out. It's painfully funny.
Nov 14, 2019 10:17am
Trying to get my offspring to do their schoolwork. Hope they figure this one out, lol.
Nov 14, 2019 10:18am
Thatâ€™s a solid list. Haha

Ohh Iâ€™ve never heard of it before. Where can I find it?
Nov 14, 2019 10:18am
What are they doing for school rn?
Nov 14, 2019 10:18am
I can send you copies if you'd like. No idea where you would find it otherwise.
Nov 14, 2019 10:19am
Sure! Thatâ€™d be great.
Nov 14, 2019 10:20am
Show is in the sync. I've added a bunch of first episodes to some other shows I enjoyed too, just in case you were in an explorative mood.
Nov 14, 2019 10:25am
Word. Iâ€™ll get em downloaded tonight.  Thank you!

[[1uxb0x]] is supposed to do prompted introspection, conceptual analysis (hand him a concept, he researches, summarizes, gives examples, and reflects), greek and latin roots, Life of Fred then Khan for math, python/tiddlywiki, set up virtualbox on his Arch machine, read and write about a The Lightning Thief, AP US history (his choice, weirdo) or a book on dinosaur history,  grammar on Khan, PE
Nov 14, 2019 10:28am
[[j3d1h]] is supposed to do the same, but no grammar, and she's working on a private P2P RSS toolchain for kickscondor (and perhaps a public RSS which will be pushed to git) and a bunch of other projects, reading and writing about Stardust, rotating a cryptography book //A Woman Who Smashed Codes// and social studies on Khan
Nov 14, 2019 10:33am
Mostly though, they play in their heads or online.
Nov 14, 2019 10:36am
lol
Nov 14, 2019 10:39am
Itâ€™s a lot of good stuff though
