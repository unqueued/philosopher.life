title: Life of Fred: Dogs (Elementary Series)

Long addition and subtraction, basic algebraic concepts, syntax/semantics distinction (because the author was wrong, I explained), necessary truths (again, author was pointing to it...poorly), and functions. I came rainbows when I saw functions this early. Why the fuck did no one properly explain them to me until graduate school? That is bullshit. This was a wonderful introduction.

Also, the story had some real darkness to it.
