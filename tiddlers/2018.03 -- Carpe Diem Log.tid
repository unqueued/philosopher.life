!! Audit:

* When I don't have bliss, I want alcohol.
* I did complete the IRS problems in a timely manner. I'm glad I triaged these issues.
* I need to continue to focus on positive reinforcement.
* Being honest about the problem is the first step. You aren't going to be perfect at controlling yourself. You have generate the right habits (and you can't expect yourself to be perfect at that either, etc.).
* I'm not proud of the contents of my weekly logs (those shame me), but I am very proud that I keep them and that I'm honest with myself about it.
* I've started writing more in my daily logs. I'm glad.
* We've been honing our meal-planning and recipes. I want to get my kids in good shape on this front as well.
** I knew how to microwave hotdogs and make a sandwich at that age. But, the mark isn't what I had, it's doing well with what we have.
* I've been watching LCS highlights. I like that. It doesn't take up much time, but I still feel like I've been keeping up and participating in that fandom. 
* My drug usage (substance or otherwise) is a major component of these logs.
* I'm pleased that I'm tracking my sleep schedule with consistency. These are the kinds of improvements I want to continue to make in my this log and the wiki in general. It's a slow climb up Mount Habit. Keep going, homie!
* I'm very tired of being lied to.
* Oh yeah, that hiccup with [[The Categorical Imperative]] was interesting. I rarely can recreate my writing, but I did a fairly good job that time. I've obviously internalized very strongly.
* The kids, on average, did a lot better in school this month than last. We are slowly getting there, pulling teeth, shotgunning, and doing whatever we can to improve.
* I did play some video games this month. Nothing serious, nothing big. I'm glad I did. It's important that I have something fun besides working hard in reading+writing.
* I'm getting to bed before 1pm very often now. I'm pleased with this change.
** The kids, however, keep wanting to stay up too late.
* I really cherish sitting/laying with my wife. I know she prefers the cat to me. That's okay.
* One of the biggest differences this month is a focused daily family time. I'm very glad we engage in it. It's been super useful.
* I need to take the hint; L doesn't want the same friendship I want. I suppose it's possible she may be purposely avoiding me as she does with AIR. She really is selfish, and I need to own up to the fact that she is responsible for who she is in non-trivial ways.
* My wife also continues to renege on multiple fronts. Here I will channel Derek Parfitt and say she is just a different person. 
** While at the same time accepting that she is training me not to take her word.
* I've not only been sleeping and eating better, but I've been consistent for the second month in a row in taking my multi-vitamins, D/Calcium, Omega-3, Fiber, and Probiotics.
* The anniversary meal ended up not being romantic (even my son said it aloud), but I tried /shrug. It was a good meal.
** Admittedly, sometimes I feel my wife and I are drifting apart. I worry our relationship has more to do with inertia at this point than actively building together. Perhaps it is a season of life? This could easily be far too critical; it's heavy lifting just keeping it together right now.
*** This, of course, is in no small part my fault.
* I'm learning, unifying, habituating, and slowly getting there.
* I'm glad I let them off the hook.
