title: 2018.05.01 - Carpe Diem Log: Knees

* Woke at 5:30, drowsy til 6. I had a very hard time sleeping.
* Drove, exactly on time.
* We worked fairly hard.
* My laptop had no space, but at lunch I had to time clear out the pacman cache and uninstall software I wasn't going to use anyways. I probably should just goto Arch. I can slim it down tremendously.
* I got off at 5:30, and I talked to my brother for a bit on the way back.
** He was busy and wasn't able to really talk much.
** He did read the analysis of the letter:
*** His words over XMPP (and on the phone): "Wow...I don't remember the scene in the book very well, but your assessment of their letters feels like Paul Muad'dib trying to force his mother to look where women cannot. I have an almost palpable sense of dread reading that...Holy shit that dune reference works"
** We will talk again later about it.
* Got home. Wife was unhappy because for the second day her wiki doesn't seem to be functioning.
** I can't do it all for her. She has to learn how to do it. We are moving to a USB drive at this point. She could do it otherwise, but it would take more effort on her part than she is willing to give.
* Kids did only a fraction of their work. 6 hours of school in 16 waking hours seems completely reasonable. I sent them to their room for the evening after speaking with them.
* Wife and I made dinner and watched //Barry//. Good first episode, although very subdued.
