Hey h0p3, nice to hear from you.

I've been skimming some of your writing and it's interesting but dense and disordered, like someone uploaded an entire mind to a wiki. As I understand it it's more of a way to organise your thoughts in notes than a blog or anything? I totally get that impulse, trying to turn knots of thought into linear text is damn difficult. But if you want to communicate to more people (?) I do think you need to write in a more user-friendly way.

If you use twitter we can connect there, might be better since I don't check this email that often.

Best regards,

John Nerst

Hey John,


It's good to hear back from you. I don't use Twitter, so I'll have to stick with e-mail.


I apologize if my work looks like a mere heap. You're right: I am working to upload my mind onto the wiki (hopefully to fix it). In the end, I'm not sure what it is (or what it will be), although I spend a lot of time trying to explain it to myself (particularly in {About}). There was a time when I wrote formal philosophy for philosophers (and others), but that's not where I'm at right now (I could, of course, be wrong). I appreciate your constructive criticism, and I will give it more thought. Thank you. 


You tell us about your undergrad philosophy work. I assume you did something else for grad school given your current occupation. What led you from philosophy to your work?


Your posts on "Wordy Weapons of Is-Ought Alloy" and "The Big List of Existing Things" are some of the most interesting to me. In your discussion of disagreement, you attend to epistemology more so than ontology (which makes sense). I believe the issue you are pointing to is an important one, and not just for social reasons. Regarding Erisology, I would be interested in your interpretation/stance on this idea:
