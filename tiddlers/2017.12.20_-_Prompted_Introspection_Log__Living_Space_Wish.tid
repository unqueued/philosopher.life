title: 2017.12.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: Living Space Wish

!! When you close your eyes and think of where you want to live, what comes to the surface? Specifically, what do you want your space to look like? And what do you think that reflects about you?

The absurdist stoic always answers what he has or worse, right? The wish could be overly ideal. I'm tired of answering wishes for more wishes. You are a copycat, Samwise, and not in a good way. 

I want a space around me that is long-lasting, clean, easy to manage, modular/flexible, made for constructing, secluded enough from others but accessible, off-the-grid as much as possible, independence-enabling, safe, defensible, preferably minimalist in some areas and collage of our eccentric loves in others. However, to be realistic, I will take whatever space I have available and make it our own. 

I think it shows that I want to be a functional hermit who has his cake and eats it too.
