!! Audit:

* So, in short: health, [[Self-Dialectic]], literal {[[Dreams]]}, [[CATI]], random question from my daughter, choosing to no longer assent to continuing my work on [[Matt McManus]]' work, Marxism, and the [[Audit]]. 
* [[/b/]] is a place to just get it out. It doesn't have to matter, although it often does. I'm glad I'm saying something!
* I think I hit the edge of absurdity and overbearing seriousness here.
* Does [[/b/]] stand in some unique contradistinctive relationship to {[[About]]}?
** This doesn't belong here. This belongs in [[Self-Dialectic]].
