title: 2019.03.12 - TDL: Veggies

* My wife is eating healthier. It aint right for her to have to do it without me (let alone that I should do it anyway). We need way more fruits and veggies. It's the only way I can keep my calorie count low enough while still be sated.
* Letters are moving, slowly. Don't stop. Ingrained inertial habit, sir. It ain't gonna be an accident.
* Work.
** My boss wants a STEM appearing project. Bricks and mortar. Substance is irrelevant to him (he doesn't actually give a shit about science). He wants a gimmick, and I'll need to think about one.
* BIOS has a setting, but it doesn't fix the problem! Lol. 
** Not a lot of good options now. Sit on it.
