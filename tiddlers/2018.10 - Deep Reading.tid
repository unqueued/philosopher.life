!! Audit:

* The Little Lovecraft books were not for me, but I can understand why they would be appreciated.
* I've been plain fucking lazy in my reading this month, basically a book a week. More problematically, besides [[The Ego Tunnel]] none of it was real, challenging, etc.
* I think I'm done with the "in 90 Minutes" books. They can be humorous, and parts of them are well-done, but they aren't what I personally need. I think I like the graphic introductions more. Biographies are just weaker philosophically. 
* I can see my family members in these books. That's cool.
* It's clear that I should move to just molecularized, monolithic tiddlers. I've just not made use of breaking them up. I suppose it was more valuable to me before, but I don't see the value in it. I like having the log, obviously, but I don't need to see how much I covered each day. It's not relevant to me.
* Ah HA! This is feeling like [[Link Log]] in a way. I get done what I get done, and it is what it is. I know I'm getting stuff done, and I push myself when I can.
* I need to finish off my wife's books soon.
