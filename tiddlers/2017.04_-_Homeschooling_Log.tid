!! Audit:

* This month was yet another turning point. It was another iteration of how we engage in the practice of homeschooling. 
* I have done much planning, structuring, organizing, design, etc. But, implementation, accountability, and effectively cultivating it in my children is not something I can do alone or even well. 
* My wife has taken up the bulk of responsibilities in that domain now. It has been very effective.
