How's life going?

Hey, are you okay?
OCT 16 11:59 AM
Oh shoot, yes I am I am just not checking this nearly as much as I should.
OCT 16 12:01 PM
We’re always up to something lately so I haven’t gotten to sit down with my computer much at all (which means I’m not really on signal either).
OCT 16 12:03 PM
I am glad you are doing well. Hopefully, you aren't feeling too busy.
OCT 16 12:03 PM
Hanging with people is nice, we just haven’t really gotten a day to ourselves in a hot minute. Work is on fire more than usual because we have a big event we’re planning and my boss is apparently worried about it but also not helping out with her portions at all.
OCT 16 12:05 PM
But I’m in a healthy “i don’t care I’m just gonna do me” space, so it’s not getting to me as bad as it usually does.

Got to go to the Ren faire this weekend and it was spectacular.
OCT 16 12:05 PM
Definitely expensive to make time to be with each other. I can appreciate that.
OCT 16 12:08 PM
I'm sorry it's on fire. You are approaching the leadership/speaking conference thing for Humana employees, right?
OCT 16 12:08 PM
Healthy is a difficult word to wield normatively. I can appreciate that it keeps you afloat. 
OCT 16 12:16 PM
Ren faire sounds like an absolute blast for you.
OCT 16 12:16 PM
What was your favorite part of it?
OCT 16 12:16 PM
Sorry, more work fires. I have been typing FURIOUSLY for hours and now my arm hurts lol. There’s not really anyone here that we CAN approach about it. I have talked to our department leader about these issues and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better. Perhaps I was too vague and should have just outright said “Leslie is a bad manager”. 

As for the Ren faire, I really enjoy the atmosphere. It’s less intense than a lot of anime conventions and people there still know how to behave for the most part so it’s less stressful too.

Sounds like absolute hell to me above, sounds like a blast in the other. 
OCT 16 5:15 PM
I think it's the stuff we do with our friends and on the weekends that keeps me alive honestly.
OCT 16 5:35 PM
If I were fighting through this alone I'd be in a much worse place.
