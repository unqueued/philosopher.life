title: 2018.09.06 -- BAGD: Testing

I was talking to MB the other day, and she reminded me of that fact that I need to help you become a very adept test-taker. The fact is that taking IQ tests and IQ-test substitutes (ACT/SAT correlate to g-eneral intelligence) is a high-stakes gatekeeping enterprise that is only going to continue to rise in usage. That is shit you can prep for, and you should. 

SCRATCH THAT.

My children aren't even fucking trying today. They are driving me insane.

Your mother and father are spending their [X time, Y emotional_energy-spoons, Z healthpoints] on you. Make our sacrifices for you worth it. Spend your own resources as wisely as you possibly can. Your eudaimonia is ours, however you go on to achieve it. You have to try though. Throw yourself into your lives. We spend our experience machines on yours.

It is not an Ego Tunnel, it is an Ego Lightcone of sorts into the nature of the contingent, Possible Worlds. That's the highest detailed physical clock available to us, but reality pregnant present and up-to-3-second (depending upon activity, context, etc...and could perhaps show even greater emergences through memory) phenomenology gap, as well as a number of other things which limit which worlds are really possible for us, demonstrate a very particular set of who we could be. It could be infinite number of possibilities, but I'd like to think it's actually finite. As though the tunnel has 10,000 forks to it each decision procedure. We snake our way through the tree of enless 10,000 branch-rings along the tunnel of choice. It's Fractal branching. I think most people have no clue about the detailed, explosive, rhizomatic, and fractal possibility in their lives and the world. Contingency is narrow to them.

I'm trying to give you a 1st class education, to teach you how to reason like gods among men. Don't waste our opportunities.
