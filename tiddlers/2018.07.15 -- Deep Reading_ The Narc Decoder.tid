title: 2018.07.15 -- Deep Reading: The Narc Decoder

This book is crazy short, informal, and reads more like a folk-psych survivalist guide. The explanations are very poor, the anecdotes heavy, and the argument isn't cogent. I can't expect a victim-survivor to be able to piece it all back together though. I'm listening.

Rules for communicating with a narcissist:

# No Engagement
#* Obviously, the priority when possible.
# Decode
#* Interpret everything as coming from a narcissist. It's an illusion have to pierce
# Gray Rock with Courteous Canned Responses
#* Make yourself an uninterest victim
#* Be robotic and thorough in your documentation
# Separate E-mail Account designed for use in court
# Choose your Battles
#* Truism...
# Take Control of Communications

This is clearly written for divorcees with children.
