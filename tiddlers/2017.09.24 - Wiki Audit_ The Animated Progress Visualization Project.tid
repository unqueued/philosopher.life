title: 2017.09.24 - Wiki Audit: The Animated Progress Visualization Project

You know how you loved to watch your bots play your video games for you. Part of the reason was that you got to visually study "yourself" play the game. You need to do this by building a GUI/Visual representation of the wiki itself.

This is a tool to understand my wiki. A truly remarkable one for a visual person like me.

Plus, this will be my version of [[Android Jones]]. This will be art. In this sense, it is masturbatory. However, that doesn't mean it isn't incredibly useful either.

I want to be able to see the progress/changes of this wiki. Imagine a video of the milehigh view of this wiki I can watch, preferably where I can pause, FF, Rewind, and change the speed settings on. If I had zoom, that would be fucking crazy.

I want edits to show up and then new pages to show up for each passing day. I want to be able to see the explosive light visuals on a faded map of my wiki. I want to see my wiki literally grow. I'd love to see

Imagine having on-demand video creation. I want to trace out the particular thought pattern by regex search or etc.

Also, I want it to be black, gray, and blue as the primary color pattern. I want The Matrix green to be the edit highlight that pops out. 

!!! On snap! There is a better way:

Just take the index.html files and do it. This is a hack, but it also represents addons, etc. No reason to tiddlypy this out.
