title: 2010.09.15 -- On Virtue Ethics

BigPIC – pg 1-22 – While I understand that it not only lays out the purposes/aims of the book, gives us some working, mutual definitions and paradigms for the rest of the text, I seem to disagree or have problems with some of the architecture of Virtue ethics and the concepts it employs (the terminology, in particular, seems to be tricky). It sets the tone for the rest of the book, so when I have problems here, it will show in later deductions.

1 – pg 1 – Deontologists would stress more than “acting” in accordance. Intention, the will, the desire, the motive, and the choosing to act in accordance with a moral rule is also an integral part of many deontological approaches.

2 – pg 2 – It is quite an assumption to think that Virtue ethics isn’t subject to the same (or parallel) problems which plague the other 2 approaches. Additionally, I think you’ll find that as we begin to interpret and explore the depths of Virtue ethics, the initial lines between the approaches will begin to blur. Yes, they all ask a different “starting” question, but after enough consideration (and perhaps some novel translation of ideas between approaches) we will see that they are very similar. Major differences rest upon even more important fundamental meta-ethical questions.

3 – pg 3 – Just because these issues (motives, moral character, moral education, moral wisdom or discernment, friendship and family relationships, a deep concept of happiness, the role of the emotions in our life, and questions of what sort of person we should be and how we ought to live) aren’t discussed or directly addressed by those espousing the other 2 approaches does not mean that they couldn’t have anything to say about these issues. Yes, these issues are not focused upon as much, but it would be unwise to assume that they aren’t capable of addressing them. While a virtue ethicist may focus on these, there actually may be strengths to an ethical theory which doesn’t have to strictly define these (and might have room for further crafting in such directions as the virtue ethicist may hope for).

4 – pg 3 – Let me also say that I agree that other approaches should be concerned about developing character-based versions or aspects of their own theories, as however circular the question “what would Jesus (the/a virtuous person) do” may appear in normative ethics, it is an essential question to consider. After all, we want to emulate that and become that, regardless of our initial approach.

5 – pg 4 – The expectation is that those who believe it (and have studied it the most) should be in the best position to describe it as succinctly as possible, and to be ready to elaborate where necessary. If you can’t define it, then we aren’t in the best position to really consider it. If you think you have something unique, then you need to tell us what, how, and why. That said, a crisp answer isn’t required; we should acknowledge at least the remote possibility that all questions about ethics may not be answerable by mere mortals. Maybe the answer is infinitely long or simply too long for others to pay attention. This does not make it invalid – likewise, I hope you show patience in this book with other approaches.

6 – pg 5 – I find this interesting that one would want to break Justice apart as a different segment of normative ethics. I admit that Justice forces us to ask questions about “what ought to happen?” which is much broader than “what should I do/be?” or even the corporate “what should we do/be?”. It seems that we should acknowledge that insofar as “what should I/we do/be?” falls under Justice, then Justice coincides with normative ethics. The rest, imho, falls into a larger discussion of value theory, perhaps.

Also, “what should I do?”, in my eyes, has everything to do with “what should I be?”.

7 –pg 6 – Perhaps you don’t like the idea that Duty and Right are corresponding parts to the same thing. I think “rights” are simply translations and fully explored implications of any normative approach to ethics. Now, I see that you believe these aren’t the “reasons” for why we ought to do something, and even if I attempted to grant that to you, I think we may find occasions on “rights” are part of the reasons why a virtuous person has a duty to do something. Certainly there are occasions where “rights” will inform my “virtuous character” and inform new duties to follow from it. I think if you really are seeking for a full answer to normative ethics, you are going to have to be capable of seeing and speaking in terms of rights and duties. Two sides of the same coin here, and the denial of one face is completely unnecessary or perhaps even detrimental to your own theory.

8 – pg 6 – Why aren’t Justice and Charity the same thing then? Perhaps they partake of each other.

9 – pg 6 – I’m not sure why “political theory” or “ethical politics” should be all that much different from plain ethics. If the virtues entail each other, I would be quick to point out that a domain in which one virtue is required entails that all virtues are required in that domain.

10 – pg 7 – I can’t think of an example where Virtue ethics is unable to give an account of justice or political morality where other approaches could. The account may not be particularly informative, but Virtue ethics begs the question at a deep level. If a person could possibly have the morally right answer/response/character/traits/will to a circumstance, surely Virtue ethics assumes that a Virtuous person would be moral in that respect (and thus there is an answer, even if we don’t know what the Virtuous person would be/do).

11 – pg 7 – You do have to admit that without a succinct answer, the number of people with the incentive to continue attempting to understand and believe your argument will decrease. Yes, succinct arguments may make your vulnerable where elaboration in necessary, but they also may prove as a quick path to redemption in the eyes of your opponents as well (if your succinct argument turns out to be strong enough to continue).

12 – pg 8 – Will you also be taking liberties in assuming common ground on other foundational topics, such as epistemology, meta-ethical concerns (a broad range, from agency and moral responsibility to value concepts), psychology and philosophy of mind? We should be leery that you will assume too much for us on these grounds. Virtue ethics, of all the approaches, may have the largest set of assumptions to be made in these other topics. Watchin’ yo’ ass like a hawk! One of the strengths of an approach that doesn’t have to make assumptions is that it can apply to more worldviews.

13 – pg 8 – Why do you think neo-Aristotelianism is the best version to use? Do you think that what you present in this book may as well just be called your approach? You will launch out on your own more than you seem to imply.

14 – pg 10 – I am not convinced Eudaimonia has any real, non-circular definition. Assuming the Virtuous as “flourishing” seems like an artificial construct and well-wishing. At the very least, it is an entrance point for a fallacy by functioning as a “weasel word”. This word could, theoretically, mean nearly anything. I am open to the Virtuous person “flourishing” via suffering and destruction (and not as some exception or “tragedy” either)—this is a raw strength of the other approaches which do not need to make this assumption.

I think this concept slips past our weasel radar because it we do initially believe that “one who is good” is “good and flourishing in being/doing good”, and secondly that somehow being ‘truly content’ and ‘deep happiness’ and ‘good existence’ as something that we deep down really both somehow want and should want. The “good existence” is nearly like begging the question of what “good” even means. Let us see if you are going to attach “extra” meaning to this word or give “obvious examples” (which may turn out to be assumptions which define this word more than you have so far).

15 – pg 10 – Even if we all had the idea of Eudaimonia deep in all of our psyches or instincts, it doesn’t necessarily make it correct. We could easily be wrong about Eudaimonia as actually being truly important or relevant to the discussion of ethics. Cognitive science (and Biology) may also have a lot to say about it.

16 – pg 11 – This sounds like an admission of Virtue ethics, at least in part, as having a Deontological front end (how you actually act, how it should be observed, how it could be understood in terms of rules), while the real argument you think you bring to the table about Virtue ethics is the back end – in particular, the back end is about character and traits, not what flows from them.

17 – pg 11 – Here I would like to say that “act” is a difficult word. Perhaps some actions are mental ones - choosing to hold belief X, etc. This will become important in the defense of non-virtue approaches which may very well be able to agree that the intention is part how we need to understand an “act” or choice, etc. It is very clear that virtue, from the onset, focuses on (at least) intention (if not something “extra”, whatever that might be). Being disposed to “act in certain ways”, of course can be deceiving, but being disposed to “intend in certain ways” (difficult, yet theoretically possible, to objectively measure) is what is meant by Virtue. This also means that there could easily be Virtuoso doppelgangers, and we would have absolutely no objective way to measure who was the imposter.

18 – pg 11 – These “attitudes” could easily be considered a form of action. I see no reason that other models of ethics can’t or wouldn’t incorporate these issues into understanding the value of choices. That said, I think here and now, I want the conversation to begin with CHOICES. There are only moral choices – all attitudes, morally relevant character traits, emotions, physical actions, morally relevant beliefs, etc. must be understood through the precondition of a choice to those things. Virtue, in this lens, seems like a series of choices about many things (which could very well be understood in the other approaches).

19 – pg 12 – This is what I don’t get: “entrenched”. It is almost as if you aren’t entirely responsible for your character. To the extent for which you are not responsible for your character, your character is an amoral aspect of that person. If by “entrench” we mean some “habituation”, I cannot help but think the individual instances (which comprise any such habituation) are each judged by themselves. If this is the case, then Virtue (as the author describes it) is merely a measurement or metric by which to judge an overall person; but it has nothing to say about any particular choice, although it may (or may not) be able to predict what the person will do.

20 – pg 12 – In conjunction with the “entrenchment” hypothesis, we are being led to believe that changes in character are perhaps rare, difficult to achieve, slow-going, and “deep”. Why should I think this? Why can’t people change “deeply” and profoundly in a rapid succession all the time? Why must it require nearly supernatural (or brain damage-based) causes? Again, we have this moral responsibility issue which raises its ugly head.

21 – pg 12 – The lack of freedom to change one’s character, which is the metric by which one is judged, is a serious fucking problem, as it negates much of moral responsibility (which can only spring forth from true agency).

This reminds me of an interesting problem with traditional Virtue ethics. How is character formed? The usual answer is habituation. Some may suggest that there is a feedback loop between character causing habituation of its own character. Is there room for agency in Virtue ethics, and if so, where? You’ll also notice that the other approaches to ethics can easily sidestep this issue, as they don’t have to say too much about our psychological makeup.

22 – pg 12 – But, again, we would suggest that Virtue ethics is ALL aboutz the “Tendency” to “be a certain way”. The “tendency” argument is what makes Virtue ethics unique, as it does not focus on particular choices (again, I have huge problems with this), but rather uses a much larger scope to define a person’s (choices’) value.

23 – pg 12 – Phronesis is involved in translation and defining all of the Virtues, perhaps as a filter or lens to understand appropriate responses in particular circumstances. Phronesis (“practical wisdom”), again, seems like a “weasel word”. It packs a lot of meaning in, makes a lot of assumptions, and yet it is poorly defined in scope and process. Ugh, this does sound like cheating. What exactly is “practical”? Why should we even assume that ethics is actually practical? How does this affect the Virtuoso in “impractical” ethical circumstances. Does this not limit the scope of what ethical questions “Virtue” can answer? Is Phronesis just good reasoning and rationality? Why can’t all the virtues just be Phronesis alone? It sounds as if Phronesis is the well from which all other virtues draw their water.

24 – pg 13 – I admire that Virtue ethics “scale” with circumstances. This isn’t relativism (although some may argue it as such), but it clearly suggests that the Virtues use a somewhat utilitarian approach (considering circumstances, with depth, to know what one ought to do). I think this also means that Virtue is vulnerable to the traditional utilitarian concerns here (omniscience concerns)– unless the author is trying to be slick and suggest that the Virtuoso, by definition, is immune to it. If that is the case, then she begs the question, and Utility seems just as plausible.

My major concern with Phronesis is that it makes ethics out to be “common sense”. I’m not sure I am willing to make that assumption. First off, I’m not convinced that ethics is practical at all. Why should I believe it is? Consider that impractical does not mean impossible* -- and, it is here that we must consider the possibility that the ethical thing could be insanely impractical and improbable to achieve. Second, as to the “common sense” aspect, when we not in the theoretical realm, but rather in the application of these studies, I think the “common sense” based aspect to the approach dumbs down ethical problems, and instead of allowing us to explore the problem and see that it could be much more detailed in nature, we are faced with “this is what we can, ‘practically speaking’, expect of the Virtuous, so why should we expect more?”. I see Utilitarians do this all the time. Theoretically, Utility should compute an insanely complicated value system, but in practice and application, people oversimplify and employ reductionism to a fault.

25 – pg 13 – This suggests that to the extent one is not virtuous, one is vicious (peccant). Character is a zero-sum metric. The author suggests that Virtue and Vices can contrast with multiples of the opposite. I posit that this is incorrect. If a choice only tests for one Virtue, then it is only testing one anti-virtue (Vice). To the extent that a choice tests multiple Virtues, it tests multiple Vices. For example, a perfectly Virtuous choice/circumstance may be comprised of 20% Honesty, 40% Generosity, and 40% Kindness; the corresponding fully Vicious choice/circumstance is 20% Dishonesty, 40% Ungenerosity, and 40% Unkindness. Any person between the “Virtuoso” standard and the “Vicioso” (el Diablo blanco) standard would have X Honesty and Y Dishonesty, whereby X% + Y% = 20%, and so on and so forth in corresponding proportions for the other variables (Generosity/Ungenerosity, Kindness/Unkindess). Essentially, each Virtue is just a spectrum.

This, of course, flow well with the idea that Virtues partake of each other. The idea is that if you have one virtue, you somehow, to some extent, has some proportion of all the virtues. I am not sure if this is a contradiction though. The very concepts of and words used to described the “Virtues” are very ambiguous and (be honest with me) subjective in the sense that people just “made them up” through pattern recognition and gut feeling. Perhaps our Virtue categories are ill-formed. Perhaps they could be condensed.

26 – pg 13 – If ‘virtue’ tout court (in short; nothing else) is considered in the Aristotelian way, does that entail was are looking at it through Aristotle’s non-purely ethical lens as well? How do/should other Aristotelian philosophical concepts interact and modify our understanding of Virtue?

27 – pg 13 – To the extent that one can be “too generous”, Generosity is not a virtue, but instead a Vice. Should we even call it ‘generosity’ if one is being “too generous”? Why? In my view, this is the equivalent of a person misjudging the proportion of Virtues which are applicable to a choice/circumstance. To be “too honest” or “too generous” is basically the misassignment of proportion of a virtue to a circumstance. For example, perhaps a truly Virtuous approach to a particular circumstance may involve 20% Honesty, 20% Generosity, and 60% Kindness. One who mistakes the ratios for 30% honesty, 30% Generosity, and 40% Kindness is actually being 20% Unkind. This is odd, because it suggests that this 10% overage of (each) Honest and Generosity is, together, the same thing as 20% Unkindness.

Is not Phronesis, then, at least in part, the judgment of proportions of each Virtue application to a choice/circumstance?

28 – pg 13 – To be clear, if it is not Virtue, then it is Vice. The use of the word “Fault”, instead of just owning up to saying it is “Vice”, shows that the author has not worked out a proper framework for this theory. The truism still exists. The virtuous person (virtuoso) is virtuous, and Virtue is defined by the Virtuoso. Imperfectly moral people (slightly immoral people) will act wrongly, but the Virtuoso, by definition, cannot. My framework would enable you to alleviate why your idea “all sounds very odd”.

29 – pg 13 – Is “wisdom” here denoting Virtue, Phronesis, both, or neither? “Just”, the virtue, is also in the same “universal virtue” vein as “wisdom”. I think this suggests that the Virtues are poorly defined and use redundant and/or overlapping terms.

30 – pg 14 – Or we could say the Desperado has misjudged a situation (or in the case of habituation, many, many situations) to require more Courage than it did and not enough Love (of oneself) or whatever proportionate set of Virtues the Desperado had replaced with corresponding vice (called, simplistically, “daring”). The idea of a ‘warped’ virtue is just a copout, it lacks rigor and finesse.

31 – pg 14 – This is a huge can of worms. Seriously. There is much that goes into this. I can’t help but think that major assumptions are going to (silently) be made along with or through this premise. Even defining this is a problem (even if it seems obvious). Virtue ethics has a huge responsibility to define the psychology of persons; that ain’t easy. I’d like more description though, what are the differences?

32 – pg 14 – The relationship between 1 and 2 will need to be established. Reason, belief, desire, and character need to be fleshed out in detail. The current argument is vague, ambiguous, and slippery. It lacks definition, and frankly, is a lot to assume. We need an account of our psychology. Let it be known that Aristotle’s understanding of science had serious limitations, and that needs to be reflected in a dissection of the mind and psychology of moral agents, as flatly importing his ideas without edification isn’t so hot an idea, imho.

33 – pg 14 – A valid point. With that said, you will eventually argue “but, what about the children?” to a fault. Virtue overemphasizes moral education and psychology, in my view, to the detriment of actual, applicable normative ethical claims.

34 – pg 16 – It seems unfortunate that many are so quick to divide belief and desire, particularly non-instinctive, non-biological (assuming determinism, agency, and non-compatibilism) desire which is so necessary to agency and free choice. Perhaps it is the case, but I’d like to see the relationship and definition of these things. I’m not convinced there is a difference at all. I agree with Aristotle, the desiderative (‘wanting to X’) intellect and intellectual desire (and emotion) is likely some mixture of cognitive and conative (‘what takes your thoughts and feelings and drives how you act on them’) faculties.

35 – pg 16 – I’m not sure I can agree to both rational and irrational though. I’m not sure you can directly be responsible for irrational choices, although you may indirectly be responsible for irrational choices if there were rational choices which caused the irrational choices.

There may be some ambiguity of the word “rational” in this context though. Don’t we want to say that what is ethical is rational? And, would we not want to say that you are only responsible while rational? Don’t we need to say you have rationally chosen to be irrational at times in order for you to be responsible for being irrational? How this comes to be, I don’t know. The virtue ethicist has serious psychological questions to answer though.

BigPIC – pg 26-42 – This section showed a very poor understanding of the framework space and possibilities of the other two approaches. The author is still unable to grasp the unique and essential metaethical precepts of these approaches, and is also unable to relate the approaches effectively.

36 – pg 26 – Clearly, all approaches to ethics can be re-written to translate into each other, and none of them immediately offer direct normative claims about actual circumstances. They all beg metaethical questions concerning the definition of “good”, causality, epistemology, agency, etc. And, as the author indicates, they all initially appear to have an equal problem in providing us actual detailed accounts of normative ethics beyond their first few architectural premises.

37 – pg 27 – Here, we part. I think it is quite possible to conceive of a Utility theory which captures and relates the among its many premises the idea of a “good agent” and “living well”. The lines will blur. What makes the Utilitarian approach unique is the value-classification of everything (and perhaps all possible things) in the universe, thus reducing ethics to math. Utility might be viewed as the vacuous, initial calculation process. It is the first codifiable and applicable step (process) derived from the metaethical theory that “value” exists and is quantifiable.

Please note that Eudaimonia is distinctly parallel to possible conceptions of “Good” in Utility.

38 – pg 27 – It begins with the “right” as best as you can, though. Normative ethics begs Deontology. “What ought we be/do/think/act/feel/want/desire/pursue/value?” is asking for a principle/rule-based answer, in my eyes. Nothing can escape being re-written or translated into Deontological formatting – Virtue ethics included! Deontology can easily serve as an abstraction layer to any ethical theory. Deontology is unique in that it is in fact “the entire answer list or codebook”, including the Utility answers from all circumstances and possible lives to be led. It is the lookup table derived from applied Utility.

39 – pg 28 – Perhaps, because the entire framework is still less fruitful or applicable in the eyes of the critic. Yes, none of the initial premises point out the answer, but the unique thing that Virtue Ethics brings to the table does seem awkward – “a psychological mindset”, which does, at face value, pale in comparison to the unique aspects of the other two approaches (which very easily can swallow Virtue ethics, it seems), as the other 2 approaches have stronger metaethical frameworks. The scorn is that Virtue still might be more circular, less practical, and perhaps even more subjective an architecture than the other approaches as well. Virtue looks like oversimplified deontology. “Be Virtuous” -> “Be Honest” & “Be X”, etc. Obviously, Virtue can do much more, but it does not seem to me that all 3 are in the same position; Virtue looks weaker, still.

40 – pg 29 – I posit that any meaningfully ethical (based on agency and free choice) normative claims which Virtue ethics could produce can still be written as Deontological claims (just as Deontology can innately swallow any ethical theory or system, for example, how all Utilitarian conclusions can be translated into Deontological principles/rules). Virtue ethics may be an engine to deduce and produce ethical conclusions, like Utility, though.

41 – pg 28 – I know you are just trying to make an easy-to-follow example of Virtue ethics foundational premises, and thus this might not be the full version by any stretch. Obviously, the word “action” involves more than it appears here. Intention/Motivation needs to be an integral part.

42 – pg 29 – If you think Eudaimonia is the aim, then this is really where you should start (somewhat like Utility). Don’t just assume and throw it out there without providing context and framework for how this initial puzzle piece fits into the equation. I’m still not sure what is entailed and why we should agree to Eudaimonia. Utility, at least, starts from the metaethical atomic value theory, in which it must first define values for everything.

43 – pg 29 – Insofar as Virtue ethics is not “agent-centered rather than act-centered”, Deontology is not “rule-centered rather than agent-centered or act-centered”, etc. This is a triangular spectrum of the same problem.

44 – pg 30 – Truism or not, it does point the parallel problem found in the other approaches. All the approaches have begin with intractably uninformative initial premises. You might state the questions as:

    Deontology – How do we know the correct principles?

    Utility – How do we know the correct values of everything (possible) in the Universe?

    Virtue – How do we know the correct Virtues?

These are the essential “omniscience” problems which (merely) appear to invoke Relativism via Ethical Subjectivism.

45 – pg 30 – Again, I posit that I can rewrite the “initial” claims such that each approach can be translated (cheatyface style) into another. Virtue’s initial claim, “An action is right iff it is what a virtuous agent would do”, is hardly unique in that “everyone accepts it”. Watch: Utility’s initial premises are easily accepted by Deontologists – “The best consequences can be brought about through the use Deontology’s decision/rule matrix”. Etc.

46 – pg 31 – It is here that we need to point out that just because people “can be wrong about the values” used in Utility equations does not mean that Utility is invalid. Given the corresponding problem in Deontology, the same can be said. Additionally, I want to note that the author is admitting that Utility is a natural way in which to approach ethics, and Deontology, likewise, should be counted as a natural and obvious approach (see codified law, etc.). I believe the author will later go on to suggest that Virtue ethics is natural, and perhaps somehow superior to the other approaches (ignoring her previous remarks about the other approaches here) because of how obviously natural it is for us to approach normative ethics with Virtue– but the reality is that they are all quite natural approaches.

47 – pg 31 – Again, the author points to how the other approaches are vulnerable to Ethical Subjectivism. Virtue is, likewise, just as vulnerable. This brings up the larger question: How do we objectively come to know normative ethics at all? We are all conditioned in our own environments, trained in certain ways, biologically destined for certain cognitive functions, and who is to be called the impartial judge to even begin discerning the objective path to find the answers to normative ethics?

48 – pg 31 – I am still not convinced it is not a truism. Virtue Ethics’s premises boils down to: “The Virtuous person’s method of decision results in what is correct”. This appears more cyclical and less informative as a FRAMEWORK than the other approaches. The other approaches at least tell us something useful about the architecture of ethics (Utility’s computability and atomic value theories; Deonotology’s codifiability theory).

49 – pg 32 – That is a very poor understanding of Utility. Utility is about maximizing value in moral equations – only a select few people are so bold as to equate Value with Happiness (but this is both likely wrong and also unnecessary to Utility theory). She’s not arguing against the method, she’s arguing against poor implementations of that method. Perhaps ‘telling a lie’ has cosmic implications that are invisible to the author, but objectively speaking, modifies that values of lying to the point that one may never be able to tell a lie. Remember, Utility assumes a value matrix/list, and we could certainly be wrong prima facie as to what values on that list. We are very ignorant in this respect.The author makes huge fucking assumptions about the value list (as if she knows what they really are). The author has shallowly assumed that Utility is practical and she actually knows the real computation – she is oversimplifying.

50 – pg 33 – I think Utility problems force us into a similar sort of positions of ignorance though. Being unable to find out the answer, of course, doesn’t not necessitate that there isn’t an answer, but it may suggest that it isn’t a worth trying to find the answer. It is here that all the approaches fail. We call it “subjectivism” for Virtue and Deontology, but Utility is likewise just as vulnerable to fall prey. The initial v alue matrix results in a similar position of ignorance which the amoralist can use to posit subjectivism. The ignorance of consequences, likewise, is also a real threat. Chaos math makes it plain as day that Utilitarian equations are fucking COMPLEX as hell – it may require omniscience to answer these questions even. Ignorance, of course, does not necessarily mean subjectivism is true; we can be ignorant within an objective moral system.

51 – pg 35 – Ironically, it appears as if you don’t even (necessarily) need to ask a Virtuous person, just a person who happens to know the answer, in the other two approaches as well. This, of course, is a terrible argument. Surely, if I found a database with all the answers, I could just “look it up”; that doesn’t help show that Virtue ethics is anywhere near as applicable as the other approaches either.

52 – pg 35 – This is a gross oversimplification. The author will later suggest that Virtuous agents can Virtuously choose 2 different options. Asking what one Virtuous agent would do in your circumstance (outside of being yourself) only tells you how you should act in your circumstance if you were them. Essentially, part of well-made Virtue theory will be that the circumstances include not just everything around the person in the Universe, but also who they are themselves, and that both of these together are required to determine what that person “ought to do/be”. Even worse is the fact that the author assumes that Virtue ethics is so practical a matter that one could even describe to a Virtuous agent what your exact circumstances might be. Virtue, through communication limitations alone, is subject to the same ‘ignorance effects’ in this situation.

53 – pg 36 – Ah, correction, it isn’t necessarily true (and thus merely possibly false) that “if I am less than fully virtuous, then I shall have no idea what a virtuous agent would do”. The statement is also possibly (in all likelihood, even) true. The rabbit-hole may run deep, and you may find yourself in the intractable omniscience problem after all – it would easily be true, and you haven’t provided enough evidence to show that it is “simply false”.

54 – pg 36 – Why should ethics be so simple? Why is Virtue this obvious? I have a hard time taking Virtue ethics seriously when it boils ethics down to something so simple – I’m not convinced it is so obvious.

55 – pg 39 – Why is it a “condition of adequacy” that a theory of normative ethics must “generate some account of moral education”? Who said that a theory of normative ethics would be practical or easy/likely to acquire, even with great effort? Should not rationality alone arrive at it – why must it be taught? You give far too much praise to Aristotle’s anticipation of moral education – this is not a strength of Virtue compared to the other approaches.

56 – pg 39 – Is this a purposely oversimplistic view of the capabilities of Deontology? It most certainly could be the case that Deontology would encapsulate everything found in Virtue ethics, and not necessarily from using the starting point of Virtue, but simply just as an end result of some other Deontological process.

57 – pg 40 – Did you just fucking throw the gauntlet down against Deontology? Nuh-uh, no you didn’t. Ninja, please. Deontology is innately the codifiability hypothesis; it is the universal language of normative ethics. Denying codifiability is denying normative ethics itself, and perhaps promoting Relativism directly. Here is where you fucked up:

Previous failures to effectively codify normative ethics, infeasibility, disagreement among non-omniscient (and often incorrect) coders, and the difficulty level of codifiability have nothing to do with the validity of the strong codifiability thesis. Seriously, saying “it is hard to do and we have sucked at it so far” is far from proving that normative ethics is somehow uncodifiable, especially in a theoretical sense. Codifiability must, at the very least, be theoretically possible. If not, why the fuck are we talking about this? If it is possible to answer “what ought you do/be?” (btw, that IS normative ethics ass-hole), then normative ethics is codifiable (i.e. answerable). You might say Deontology = Answerable = Codifiable. Essentially, Deontology’s strength is not some unique generator of normative claims (like Utility), but rather it gives the universal framework to answering any normative question in the first place.

Now, perhaps the author intends to say that if normative ethics is only theoretically and logically-speaking “codifiable”, but will never physically or mentally be codifiable by actual persons, then it is somehow “uncodifiable”. This, however, is far from proven. Who gives a shit if codifiability is unpopular or if modern philosophers have been unable to codify the oldest fucking problem in the world? That does not entail that normative ethics is physically and mentally “uncodifiable” (and merely only a theoretical, and thus “useless”, concept).

Why must we assume that we “should not” pursue the impractical? Who said ethics is practical? Maybe you are called and required to pursue that which is impractical and nearly (if not actually) impossible for you achieve. I don’t give a shit if it leaves a bad taste in your mouth (lulz, that sentence is awesome) – we need to reconcile the possibility that we “should” pursue ethics, even if we will never fully succeed in knowing all there is to know about it. Notice how I just “begged the question” of ethics itself – yeah, that is part of the beauty.

Additionally, I should not write while I’m fasting. I sound angry, don’t I? I’m hoping that a more charitable reading of this passage may just result in “that was unclear”, but for now, I’m pissed off.

58 – pg 40 – This oversimplifies codifiability (essentially, Deontology). It is certainly possible that there are rules which dictate that doctors need to not be “arrogant, uncaring, dishonest, and self-centred” in such circumstances. Assuming you are responsible for such things (and, likewise, therefore, capable of changing such things), then it can surely be regulated and codified.

59 – pg 40 – I’m not sure phronesis is really the issue at hand. Phronesis, at best, tell us that your “rules” are simply incomplete and your rule-maker too incompetent.



BigPic – pg 43-87

60 – pg 43 – Admittedly, it does seem prima facie that Virtue is subject to the similar “contradiction” exceptions we find in deontology. We could, of course, deny the idea that “honesty” is about “never lying”, but rather “never lying in these circumstances”. This might lead us to relativism/subjectivism, “how do we know those circumstances?”, etc.

61 – pg 44 – I’m not sure why irresolvable dilemma need be about two equally “wrong” things. It could easily be about two equally “good” things. In fact, the only truly irresolvable dilemma is when there is more than 1 (2, likely, given “di” in Dilemma) maximally valuable or correct choice. I might even deny that these exist, but the hypothetical seems worth considering for sure. Decision procedures, in particular, need to keep this hypothetical in mind.

62 –pg 44 – “Residue” and “Regret” over opportunity costs isn’t reasonable, as both equally-valued decision trees are going to have the opportunity cost. The same can be said for the “residue”. Essentially, it isn’t “resolvable” in terms of decision procedure. If they are equal, then one will never be “better” than the other (as far as choices go). That said, perhaps written into the decision procedure blackbox, that you could choose either at random (it doesn’t matter, is in fact, AMORAL).

63 – pg 45 – Essentially, you still have to “write” the residue into the choice of “which is right, x or y?” as a part of x and a part of y. Authors may have neglected to do such, but then maybe there is x1 and x2, and y1 and y2, with and without residue for each, etc. It would then easily be boiled down to the x and y containing residue as being the real irresolvable dilemma.

Why should except that there are irresolvable dilemmas as well?

64 – pg 45 – (This was regarding false dilemmas) Boy, I have a real problem with saying the “right” thing is “not quite as bad” in the sense that it is “bad” at all. I really despise the implication. It might “feel” bad; it might not even initially “look good”, but what “is good” is simply NOT bad. Her meaning of either “good” or “bad is meaningless, or she is contradicting herself.

65 – pg 45 – and, of course, she will be hard pressed to show how this assumption is not true. It may be a reasonable assumption, even if it wasn’t directly justified. Her analogy was poor.

66 – pg 46 – Satan!!!! Omfg. If there is a difference, then neither have real meaning to me. Whatever is the ‘right moral decision’ is actually the ‘morally right decision’. This is a false dichotomy. It plays nicely into her theory, but it isn’t true. Moral means right! It was the “greatest” decision available/possible. You cannot be expected to be/do more than is possible. You cannot be responsible for it. Each choice is its own moment of circumstance.

67- pg 47 – You should blame him for making choices that created the circumstances (if we are even to assume that those were blameworthy, and here it is). However, that is a separate circumstance and a separate choice. While it is related causally to the future circumstance, we cannot blame him if he choose A, he should be praised for it. In that instance, he is responsible for a particular choice, and we blame or praise that choice in its own right.

Now, the question of whether or not he should be ashamed or praised for a “range” of circumstances/choices is entirely different. Yes, he is quite blameworthy over the range of choices he made, but that does not negate the fact that perhaps some particular choices he made were in fact the virtuous ones.

I also question whether Virtue theory can truly be fully understood by the unvirtuous at all, especially at the denial of codifiability.

68 – pg 47 – I disagree with the idea that the lesser of two evils (assuming those are the only options) is evil at all. The fact that there is a remainder is merely accidental, and is assumed to be a part of that choice. Not having a remainder for each option is means this isn’t a dichotomy, but rather there are more than two choices. Please remember, if you can’t be held “responsible” for that remainder (i.e., it isn’t your choice or up to you), then we need not even discuss this as a moral question at all.

69 – pg 47 – Here I part ways with the author (again). There is no difference between “right action” and “right decision”, and this includes the possibility of “mental action”, which means that you might responsible for choosing certain sorts of your mental state. These are two sides of the same coin.

70 – pg 47 – To have remainder is literally part of the right action/decision/being. Ignoring remainder is ignoring the possibility of more choices (false dichotomies), it does not mean that seeking “right action/decision” is actually the incorrect theory though.

71 – pg 47 – This is my problem with using only specific versions (Mills/Kant) of an approach to ethics (in this case, Consequentialism/utility) to describe all the possible variants of these approaches. It is very easy to construct versions of these arguments which are completely immune to the criticisms offered by Hursthouse. Yes, traditional approaches to Utility might deny the relationship between “act” and “decision”; yes, traditional approaches of Utility might deny that “mental actions” count as real “action” at all; but, why should we assume that we can’t have an approach to Utility which does assume these premises? Consider how this would affect Hursthouse’s overall argument. Utility certainly could assume that ‘regret’ and ‘mental states’ for which we can responsible are choices/decisions/acts.

72 – pg 50 – Incredible. What is the scope of ‘review’? There is your problem. Are you a good person from time X to time Y, from choice A to choice B? If we divide moral guidance from assessment, then any decision previously affected (causally) by past vice can never be virtuous. It makes no sense to even talk about what the virtuous person would do in your shoes as an unvirtuous person. There is no “right”, just lesser than ‘the right’. If it isn’t “the right”, then why should we care? Ethics, in the scope of the smallest unit or moral responsibility, is about maximal correctness or go home because it isn’t good enough. Degrees of wrongness discussions are missing the point, why pursue what is wrong?

73 – pg 53 – Surely not. Surely only the Virtuous person would know the ins-and-outs of all these exceptional cases and whatever form of “prioritization” of the Virtues you wish to imply. I am unwilling to say that either Virtue or Deontology truly fail in this matter. I like the algorithm for life.

74 – pg 54 – Perhaps the author’s flavor of Virtue theory is not codifiable and capable of solving these conflicts, but again, I am unwilling to say that another version of Virtue theory could not solve these problems (likely assuming that the Virtue theory was codifiable).

75 – pg 57 – Why do you think codification is truly impossible? List all circumstances, list all corresponding degrees of virtue applicable to each circumstance. Boom. Codified and prioritized. You are either begging the question or simply not considering all the possibilities here.

76 – pg 57 – Are you sure we can even rationally speak about something which isn’t even theoretically codifiable or quantifiable or qualifiable? The cases which don’t fall into the universals have no meaning, they seem subjective and relative.

77 – pg 58 – Arguably, assuming the maximal set of principles, the diminished degree of applicability of at least some of the universal principles is exactly what we mean when we say there are exceptions to which there aren’t universally applicable rules.

78 – pg 58 – Thus, the author commits herself to a minimal, weak codifiability hypothesis.

79 – pg 59 – Reductionist to a fault. Of course these things are codifiable.

80 – pg 59 – Ah, a terrible way to view codifiability. The “moral wisdom” applied in this case is the formation and comprehension of why the codes are formed as such.

81 – pg 59 – Why can ‘acquire moral knowledge’ when we “ask the virtuous person” how to be and act, when the “lecture” (which often includes participation) cannot suffice? Surely a perfectly comprised lecture would contain the exact same answers that would be provided by the responding Virtuous person.

82 – pg 60 – “easily come by” does not mean one cannot “come by it with difficulty”. The argument is about whether acquisition can be done from codified learning or not. What sort of learning isn’t innately codified? This also puts a dent in a overall ‘moral education’ which you seem to think Deontology might be good at (via lectures) but Virtue cannot.

83 – pg 60 – The failure, in her eyes, then is a lack of understanding V-ness. Great. That was very informative. If you flesh that out, it simply means they don’t know the codified moral rules.

84 – pg 61 – I would talk about it, but if I could, then it wouldn’t be real. Virtue is “too complex” to talk about. It must at least be theoretically possible to talk about it.

85 – pg 61 – I suspect there are problems in assuming that the unvirtuous can even actually know who is Virtuous without already being Virtuous themselves.

86 – pg 64 – Pure assumption. Utility calculations are so insanely complicated that it very well may be the case that discussions of applied ethics may end up being unsolvable by Utility. You assume too much about the simplicity (only appearance at best) of Utility.

87 – pg 64 – Not necessarily at all. The presentation of irresolvable dilemmas that we see with immediacy in deontology is not necessarily why one would choose deontology over utility (which seems to lack that immediate sense of irresolvable dilemmas). Deontology may have other very strong points which utility fails to address; and also, we may not even be able to distinguish some ethical theories which (perhaps rightly) conflate Deontology and Utility.

88 – pg 65 – And, of course, I would that that modern conceptions of Virtue ethics are shaped by religion (particularly Christianity) as well. Jesus and God [is a]/[are] Virtuous Person(s). A great deal of discussion about the nature of God is a discussion of Virtue ethics in the eyes of many. As we don’t entirely know what God might do in a circumstance, we conjecture in the same way that we might about this (almost) mythical beast, the “Virtuous person”. Also, I hope that the author is not explaining this historical account in any pejorative sense, especially as her own doctrine is formulated upon a very religious foundation (hell, even Aristotle believed in God).

89 – pg 65 – The author is oversimplifying the matter. Religious views are more than mere prohibition, there is required proactivity.

90 – pg 66 – Of course, any appearance or ‘in fact cases’ of the Church’s failing to address ethical issues doesn’t mean that there isn’t in fact an objective answer. We also can’t judge the theory of deontology (or Virtue ethics) entirely upon the historical influences upon it or someone else’s (perhaps) poor implementation of these ideologies.

91 – pg 66 – of course, you also must show that there aren’t at least strong philosophical grounds on which to deny the possibility of irresolvable dilemmas. It may be the case that there aren’t any. I think this is absurdly complex to show prove either way, on the order of magnitude of defining the metaethical* sorts of value placements on all objects in the universe which is used for Utility calculation. It is something which may be perhaps out of our reach.

92 – pg 67 – Why should I assume that this is an irresolvable dilemma? Moreover, I dislike the idea that we should distinguish moral dilemmas of the sort which are concerned with “lesser of two evils” from “best of the best”. The truth is that whatever might be the best is good and moral. If the “final decision doesn’t matter” then we aren’t talking about morality within the context of the choices offered.

93 – pg 67 – Likewise, I think you can’t show that they are necessarily wrong either. At best, we are both in a position of ignorance as to whether or not there are actually any irresolvable dilemmas. We see appearances, but we don’t necessarily know.

94- pg 68 – For the record, if you don’t have (or aren’t concerned with producing) a decision procedure, then you aren’t doing ethics at all! This isn’t about rational choice and seeing why it is rational and understanding the algorithm and moral functions (f(x) sort), it is about something which we don’ t have full control and responsibility over. The contradiction being that you are somehow responsible for your feelings, attitudes, and character, even if you can’t necessarily change them. It is only that which you can change (in the proper scope of time) that you can be responsible for.

The definitive decision procedure for a true (theoretically speaking) irresolvable dilemma in which, ‘q’ circumstances put into our “black box of morality” function ‘p’, where p(q), results not in a single atomic answer ‘a’, but rather a set of possible and equally acceptable answers, [‘a1’, ‘a2’,…’an’] means that you must choose one in the set. You might argue there is a second decision procedure, but there isn’t. If you tried to plug the [a] set back into the “black box of morality”, you would be returned either a random selection from that set or the full set itself. That is to say, with respect to the choices in the set, they are amoral and equivalent. The set in respect the opposite set (all the choices not spit out), the former is clearly the morally superior.

95 – pg 68 – After much thought, and initial dislike because I thought it spun into moral relativism (incorrectly assumed that), I agree. If there are irresolvable moral dilemmas, then they within that set of possible choices, it is a moral. If we are assume irresolvable dilemmas exist, then there are definitionally speaking, the moral answer is “anything in the dilemma set”, and within that dilemma set, there are no morally correct answers.

I initially disliked it because: I assumed that choice exists for a reason, particularly for the sake of moral choices. I think free-will is what distinguishes us from animals and rocks and determined things (forget compatibilism), and freewill and moral responsibility co-exist simultaneously. There is freewill iff there is moral responsibility. One entails the other, and likewise, I thought that the exercise of choice always entailed that we had a moral situation. This is only partly true now.

Sp’ Situation Q, where Q is the possible world, including my physically possible future actions in this smallest unit of moral experience, let’s say my only possible actions are [a, b, c, d, e].

In a normal, resolvable dilemma (only the appearance of a dilemma), when I put Q into Decision (procedure) function P, where P(Q), I get an output of a single action. Perhaps “b” is the output.

However, in an irresolvable dilemma, when I put Q into Decision (procedure) function P, where P(Q), I get an listed output with multiple equally good options. Perhaps [c, e] is the output. It is here that I can say choice is still moral in the sense that I should not do ‘a’ or ‘b’ or ‘d’. However, within the set [c, e], there is no moral choice. So, the choice is still moral in the sense that I’m not allowed to do ‘a’ or ‘b’ or ‘d’, but it is amoral with respect to ‘c’ and ‘e’.

Another test of the amorality of ‘c’ and ‘e’ would be that if I were to rewrite Q world without the possibility of choosing ‘a’ or ‘b’ or ‘d’, and thus the possible choices available in Q world are only ‘c’ or ‘e’, the function would spit out all possible choices, namely [c, e]. Here the moral function cannot determine what is right, and that is because there is no right (or wrong) with respect to ‘c’ or ‘e’ exclusively.

It is the choice within the choice that lacks moral responsibility. Really, we must consider this as [a, b, d, [c, e]], where [c,e] is moral. However, to choose either [c, e] as a subset of subset of [a, b, d, [c, e]], is amoral. There are amoral choices if irresolvable dilemmas exist.

96 – pg 68 – By my thinking, since there are only 2 possible choices, and both are equivalent, then this is amoral. There is not moral choice here. It seems wiser though to question whether having only 2 possible choices is really possible; that is an insanely severe limitation. Why can’t I just blink my eyes? Why can’t I just take a deep breath? Why can’t I choose to contemplate World of Warcraft? These seem like choices I always have, just not part of the subset which would be the ‘dilemma’ in this sense.

97 – pg 69 – As well, It is possible to account for dilemmas without actually distinguishing “right” from “good”.

98 – pg 69 –Neither acted is obligated with respect to each other, but either act is obligated with respect to all other actions. Accordingly, we must say that acting “well” is obligated, but also amoral compared to the other equally good actions available. P([a,b,c,d]=[a,b], then [a,b] is obligated, but ‘a’ with respect to ‘b’ (and vice versa) is permissible (and essentially amoral).

99 – pg 70 – This is where we part (Pincoff, of course, hasa different perspective from Hursthouse). The decision procedure is universal, and there is no moral decision procedure for dilemmas besides flipping a coin. 2 Virtuous people cannot have differing moral stances, only differing amoral stances. Otherwise, you are arguing for moral relativism.

100 – pg 71- “opt for” is important, as it shows permissibility (in my theory), but not obligation. “Opt” implies there is no moral choice occurring. Permissible is meant that you didn’t deliberate it though. I think the Virtuous agent can’t rationally and morally deliberate between 2 equal choices, they can only rationally and morally deliberate and narrow down all possible choices down to the equally valued choices in a dilemma.

101 – pg 71 – My argument is actually the opposite. The virtuous agents aren’t deliberately saying there “neither decision is correct” with respect to all decisions available (assuming more than just the 2), but rather “both decisions are correct” with respect to all decisions available.

102 – pg 71 – It is worth pointing out that irresolvable dilemmas of ‘the good sort’ have no action guidance, but will have the action assessment of “good” or “well” (and very likely, “right”, even according to her distinction of these terms).

Obviously, I think it is insane to say something can be “right” but not “good”.

103 – pg 72 – This is a false dichotomy. If you have unclean hands, you have dirty hands and vice versa. Virtue ethicists like simplicity and imagery I think; they (think they) like pragmatist approaches to ethics; they like not having to define anything because it isn’t “codifiable”.

104 – pg 72 – Absolutely insane. The virtuous person does not do what is right? They can choose rightly, but not act rightly in a tragic irresolvable dilemma. Surely we must say that the relationship between decision and action is much (much) closer (I actually can’t separate them). This is a distinction between Orthodoxy and Orthodpraxy that shouldn’t exist. If the decision is right or good, wouldn’t we want to say also that the action was right or good? Decision is a mental action also*.

Hursthouse also can’t define ethics for us then. The virtuous person defines what is right. They definitionally can’t do wrong. Here she claims they do wrong (which isn’t right). Problematically, that means that even in her own view, “what is right” is therefore not defined by the Virtuous person, but rather by some one standard. Eudaimonia, of course, will be her response. Problematically, this is the same thing as Utility’s happiness.

It is insane to say that what is “right” is not what is “good”. If good is defined by some other standard than right, then we aren’t talking about morality. Perhaps we are talking about skewed hedonistic attempts at morality. The virtue ethicist will claim that “good” is somehow beneficial and Eudaimonic. It is clear that if tragic irresolvable dilemmas exist, then the “right choice” will end up not benefiting the Virtuous person and not lead them to Eudaimonia.

105 – pg 73 – This is important because while you claim “prior identification of right or wrong” is the incorrect approach (the sort of thing deontologists and utilitarians might do), you show us that you yourself actually must be using some “prior identification of right or wrong” as the standard by which to provide action assessment of a Virtuoso’s action (‘not decision’) in a tragic irresolvable dilemmas as “bad”, “wrong”, “not right”, and frankly immoral. Without some objective standard outside of “what the virtuous person is/acts/thinks”, you could not claim they will do “wrong” in TID’s.

106 – pg 74 – Here she claims the virtuous person doesn’t act badly, even though it isn’t “right”. The “way in which” they felt and deliberated to reach that act is what made it different from the Vicious.

107 – pg 74 – How very slippery! Eudaimonia is the standard of “goodness” and what is “valuable” and “worth pursing”, not necessarily “virtue”. The basis of Virtue is not the Virtuous person, but Eudaimonia, and the Virtue is useful in “Virtue ethics” of Hursthouse insofar as it results in Eudaimonic action. Insofar as Virtue brings about un-Eudaimonic actions, it is “bad” and “not well” and “wrong”.

108 – pg 75 – I would want to say that the Virtuous person did the “good” thing and the “right” thing, but what they were choosing both the particular action in mind + simultaneous mental action of regret/remorse/remainder.

109 – pg 76 – Another essential problem is that of moral responsibility. I’m not talking about the man and his 2 woman, I’m talking about “unfortunate” tragic dilemmas and choices presented, by no fault of their own, to the Virtuous agent. An agent is responsible for moving from P([a,b,c,d]) to [a,b] (or even if it there is just one choice which ‘seems’ painful or ‘seems bad’ in appearance, just [a]). I cannot hold them responsible for the appearance of pain or lack of Eudaimonic qualities about the circumstance and correct decision/action (same thing in my view of psychology). I cannot say they did wrong if they in fact did what was right. I cannot hold them responsible for doing anything better than what the circumstances allowed for. If Jesus himself were in that position, whatever he did would in fact be MORALLY correct and good. It seems as if the Virtuous agent is “morally responsible” for pursuing Eudaimonia outside of “moral luck” and outside of the realm of what was possible to choose/do/be in the reality of circumstances provided to us in life. How can you be responsible for something for which you can’t be held responsible?

110 – pg 77 – There is a difference between feeling “sad” that the only thing possible was unpleasant (perhaps even “wrong” in most other circumstances) and feeling “sad” that what you chose may have been itself “wrong”. If I only have 10$ to give to a starving child on the street, and the best possible action possible is to give them 10$ and nothing else, it seems acceptable for me to feel remorse that I don’t have more to give and this was the best possible option in the circumstance and that I couldn’t help the child anymore than that, but that doesn’t mean I need have the sort of remorse that one might have had in actually doing something wrong (such as stealing 10$ from that kid). Similarly, even in tragic dilemmas, etc., I can feel remorse for the fact that there weren’t better options (and I should hope for better options), but I shouldn’t feel remorse as if I’ve done something directly wrong.

The thing itself is not terrible. Terrible can only be described given the input circumstance to P(Q) decision procedure. The circumstance, which is not in our control, might not be as we wish or as good as possible. But, we aren’t responsible for that. The scope of moral assessment may only take into account that realm for which the agent is responsible, and in many cases, the circumstances are outside that realm of responsibility. Even if you were responsible for the circumstance, each new choice and decision tree may simply have to be judged on its own. If that is the case, then circumstances INPUT will never be a part of the responsibility equation, only the RESULT of a previous decision will show the person’s culpability (at that time and choice) with respect to what resulted.

111 – pg 78 – Of course, I would say there is action Guidance in some (if not all, because I think Q is VERY FUCKING LARGE IN ALL) cases. In P([a,b])=[a,b], there is no action guidance (definitionally pure dilemma). In P([a,b,c,d])=[b,c], there is action guidance up to the dilemma, and then none thereafter.

112 – pg 78 – Measuring Character as the moral standard makes sense only if you can be responsible for it and if you can change it. I also think Character is completely separate from the circumstance. The circumstance is an input into standard of Charity, and the output will be charitable as far as it can modify how you give guidance (even if that guidance seems like it directs us to something which is otherwise unsavory ).

113 – pg 80 – Extremely Aristotelian in the sense of paronymous predicates found in his Categories. Exemplar->Particular Virtue

114 – pg 80 – It seems as if you deny the ‘primacy of character’, you aren’t left with anything different from Deontology or Utility.

115 – pg 81 – So, you can understand some or even most of a particular Virtue or application of a V-rule, but you can’t understand all of it or all its applications unless you are Virtuous person who is “fine-tuning” through the use of moral wisdom. So, the character of ‘moral wisdom’ used in fine-tuning the other virtues is primal?

116 – pg 81 – You only want primacy of character, particularly fine-tuning, when it suits you. In tragic cases, you want action to be prior to character. Clearly, you are both pointing towards “Right is defined by the Virtuous Person” and “Right is not defined by the Virtuous person, but some other act-based standard”.

117 – pg 82 – The virtuous person is now the one who knows how to reach Eudaimonia given a fuckton of “moral luck” and never being in unfortunate circumstances; they know how even if they will never attain it. Normally we want to think of the Virtuous person as “doing” and “being”, essentially “attaining” what is good. Her definition sucks.

118 – pg 82 – You aren’t even talking about MORALITY. Wtf is wrong with you?

119 – pg 85 – This sounds as if “absolute rules” have primacy in many cases where they apply. How is this separate from Deontology?

120 – pg 86 – Did she just commit the same crime of which she accuses Deontologists, namely God’s interference in the circumstances which appear such that the Virtuous could always do what is right? How does that Jive with tragic dilemmas for the Virtuous?
