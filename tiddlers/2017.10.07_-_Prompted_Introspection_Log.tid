!! What are your three favorite albums? Why?

I wouldn't say I'm a person who has ever really been into albums. I've been pirating since I was a young person. There also is a difference between my favorite collection of songs on a particular album and my favorite singles (whether of the same artist or other). There are also composers which never had albums, but they have bodies of work I find incredible. I'm also having to simply measure the which "album" had the maximum utility packed into it (compilations are cheaty, but they work). This is talking about a sliver of my favorite music here, and it fails to talk about other kinds of narratives which are still valuable. That said, I will attempt to answer the question as is because it is still meaningful. 

* Rage Against the Machine - The Battle of Los Angeles
* Nine Inch Nails - The Fragile
* O Brother, Where Art Thou? - Soundtrack

To be fair, I've never actually bought these. I've never even held them in my hands. There are even songs on the albums which aren't in my favorites. But, they are the best mix I can find.

Of course, these answers have changed over the years. I keep coming back to these more often than not though. Some narratives simply resonate with our persistent identities better than others. The short excursion into other narratives alters us, but they do not remain a part of who we are as clearly. These really are my mainstays.

Ultimately, three is too limiting. It's like trying to nail down 3 movies, 3 books, 3 video games, or 3 other experience machines. I could do that with drugs though. Hmm.
