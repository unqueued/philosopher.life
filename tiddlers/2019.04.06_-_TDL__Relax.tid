title: 2019.04.06 - TDL: Relax

* Family Time
** Walk, cozy 1on1s, wikis, log, meal...
*** Should we have a game too? Meh.
* We should all complete our writing to [[kicks]]. This is so cool.
* I think [[Deep Reading]] with my wife will move toward the intro books too. There is something quite right about it.
** Maybe some hard ones too.
*** She deserves some fun.
* I'm a stay at home dad who is homeschooling and working at middle school, and I should try to relax my expectations of my productivity.
