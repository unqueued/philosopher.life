title: 2018.09.09 -- Wiki Audit: Root

[[/b/]] is leaking!

---

It's clear, when using cannabliss, I need to focus on [[Root]] and big picture as hard as I can. Even though it literally lowers my IQ, it's motivation I would not otherwise have. I am so deeply akratic, but I also think it's so computationally expensive! It's mind-boggling hard. This wiki is truly a hyperobject for me. I cannot consciously, cognitively visual my wiki into its depths in the majority of perspectives. I'm increasingly blind to what this elephant grows into. I suggest I'm coming to understand that better by actually developing models for myself which demonstrates it. 

Alright, put your money where your mouth is. Ask TW forum about the value of tagging. Problems which should not be solved by search, marginally equivalent title naming conventions, and effective linking+transcluding?

Perhaps the next big task is to go back through the entire wiki. We are at the end of the year. 

I feel like Links allows me to "crosspost" to other tiddlers. Since I can't spam myself, it acts as a profound categorization softlink system.

I don't think Category creep a problem for me at all! Am I wrong?

Rotate first person and second person paragraphs. Say something, talk back to it like someone else said it? It would be an interesting exercise, but I think it would be very hard. I don't always have that ability.

Ah, this is where I should be writing while on Cannabliss. I want to generate evidence for myself that this practice is as worthwhile as possible. Give the best proof you can.

Fine. I need to devote some work to researching tagging with depth. Perhaps more a lot more quick theory of tagging under my belt, I'll be able to ask the right questions. 

Ask wife to ask her teachers. I need good resources on the topic. Look, tagging could be an absolute goldmine in this wiki if it turns out to add a dimension which I cannot or suboptimal-computationally should not....

Fine [[Tagging Theory]]

I need to talk about [[The Grand Dialectic]] and [[Self-Dialectic]] as a dual project. [[Self and World]]?

I do need to do the unilink plugin. There is something right about it.
