THU 2:27 PM
Should be okay.
THU 2:27 PM

THU 2:27 PM
She’s leading a meeting rn. But I’ll have an answer for you around 4. :)
THU 2:28 PM
Sorry for not being super on top of picking these days. Life has been busy as always. XD

Take all the time you need. It's a gift to be able to see you all. I know how hard scheduling is.

So it is written. So shall it be done.
