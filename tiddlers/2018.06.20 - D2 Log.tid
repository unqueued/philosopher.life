I did a single run. It would take 3-4 more to hit 77. I'm pushing the limits of what NM Baal can offer me. I really just don't have enough gear, but I think running The Hole is incredibly safe if my merc is up to it. Speaking of which, I'm really lucky to have the drops for my merc that I do have. If I could pickup a solid armor for him, he'd be all set. I'm very worried he'll just get crushed. I'm going to rely upon my MF doing all the fucking work for me.
