title: 2018.06.10 - Le Reddit Log: The Economist

Call me paranoid and uncharitable, but my interpretations of The Economist in these works lead me to believe they aren't ultimately "coming around" to favor Marx's position. I think they are dogwhistling. They are telling the elite to "wake up" so as to effectively react against the attempts to decentralize power, to suppress revolution, and to plunder what's left of humanity's future before the next mass extinction.
