title: 2020.01.07 - Wiki Review: Tryhard

* [[WINTCIS]]
** Might grab [[Sphygmus]]'s too. I don't have a particular way of saying that sentiment that crops up again and again for me. 
* [[The Neckbeard]]
** I am quintessential neckbeard. I bask in the #awfuleverything. I think it's too much irony and dissonance for most stomachs.
* [[2020.01.06 - TDL: Transclude is EZ.]]
** My body is feeling the toll, and so is my brain. I feel like I'm walking around in a haze, almost like I'm drunk or something. I did get the big stuff done though.
* [[2020.01.06 - Prompted Introspection: Food Affects Me]]
** Reminds me of asking about how sleep (or lack thereof) affects me. Talked to death.
* [[2020.01.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Forget Your Plans]]
** Completed. I have no rational rules for which kinds of mucus disgust or arouse me and in what context. It's terrifying.
* [[2020.01.06 - Antipleonasm Analysis: No Lil' NME]]
** Okay, I am feeling the itch to pickup some of the Eastern aphorisms. 
*** And, I also feel like handing Nietzsche's ass to him.
* [[2020.01.06 - Wiki Review: Man Up, Man]]
** It was another fairly isolated day. But, when I'm feeling sick, I don't talk much. Plus, we don't have a living room. I'm hoping that will change it back.
*** My daughter is using her closet as her sleeping area, rofl. It's like a Holy of holies or something.
*** My son is staying up too late playing teh vidja.
* [[Emojified]]
** Okay, I adore the tryhard paintjob. Some tools render it monospace too. There is some hope in the world.
