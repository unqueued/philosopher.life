!! Audit:

* I love reading [[Sphygmus]]' work. I don't think many people realize how important this log can be.
** It's easy to see that few people read it. I don't understand why. Some of the most important juice is found here.
*** It does have boring and even irrelevant stuff in it too. The [[S2NR]] has too much variance in it, I guess.
* Hrm. I still haven't touched BDS97.
* Always feels like this is the real post facto [[Carpe Diem]] log. 
* So many jokes and little things, but also a lot of emotes.
* This pulse-taking has gotten harder this month; there are more things to write about.
* It's absolutely fascinating to cover these logs after doing all my other [[Log Audit]]s. 
** I get to see my day-after meta opinions/feelings and compare them to my monthly.
