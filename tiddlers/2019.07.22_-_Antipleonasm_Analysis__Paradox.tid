title: 2019.07.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Paradox

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Think about the strangeness of today's situation. Thirty, forty years ago, we were still debating about what the future will be: communist, fascist, capitalist, whatever. Today, nobody even debates these issues. We all silently accept global capitalism is here to stay. On the other hand, we are obsessed with cosmic catastrophes: the whole life on earth disintegrating, because of some virus, because of an asteroid hitting the earth, and so on. So the paradox is, that it's much easier to imagine the end of all life on earth than a much more modest radical change in capitalism.

We^^re you, tho?^^ Was it really a debate? I have my doubts. I can't even trust polls, and the overton window has always been artificially narrowed, herded, and propagandized. I'll agree people accept capitalism, even those who claim they do not in many cases. I don't meet many people who can define the concept of capitalism, but it does appear that most take it as both description and prescription. Plenty of people will agree with the above claim, even capitalists! 

I will not call that a paradox since the term should be reserved, but it has some paradoxical qualities. It's absurd, ironic, ridiculous, and an epistemic inconsistency. 

All this said, The Zizek's gist is on point. I suggest the reasons are for entertainment, hiding the truth from ourselves, and perhaps a pseudo-stoic deathwish. It's important to see that it's not only hard to conceive of effective alternatives but almost impossible to implement them. I will keep reaching out even though I am strongly convinced it won't have any consequences beyond my moral value as a person (which is, ofc, the only motivation of merit).
