!! What is a joke you played on someone?

I don't usually play a ton of jokes on people. I'm not a terribly humorous person unless I'm being absurd. I don't know what to say: I have a hard time finding most comedians funny these days. That's sad. Comedy has been an easy drug for me. It's now work.

I've clearly enjoyed putting rickrolls in my real [[EFF: Cover Letter]]. I hope it makes them laugh. I've come to love the song.
