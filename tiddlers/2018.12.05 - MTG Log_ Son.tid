title: 2018.12.05 - MTG Log: Son

My daughter wasn't interested in playing, but she helped her brother out with a chore to let him play. It was a goblin mirror. I had T1 Lackey->SGC with port and waste compared to his vial. My son sacked his Cratermaker to hit my vial. We talked about it. MWM off a lackey connect too, and prospector ended the game Turn 4 by sacking my board for the remaining 5 damage channeled through SGC. The die roll is hard to beat. The SB changes a lot too.

I feel like my memory is much better while playing magic. I can remember the narratives and reasons for those narratives with a particular kind of clarity and depth that I often don't have in other practices.

I found a format on the source which is wrestling with Legacy format with only basics or common lands (since 90% of the cost of a deck is in the manabase). I adore pauper for a number of reasons. I think I may build out the format since I could probably construct every major deck in that format (and I'm super tricksy too ;P).
