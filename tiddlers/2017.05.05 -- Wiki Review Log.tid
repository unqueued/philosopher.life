title: 2017.05.05 -- Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.05.04 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** I've given more thought to what I said yesterday about not drawing awesome conclusions. My work on the wiki has been kind of minimal. Somehow working in a stringent and programmatic fashion seems to detract from my motivation to freely make content. We'll see how this weekend goes. In any case, I can't expect myself to be redlining the entire time. It's okay just have regular, slow days on the wiki.

** It was a delicious day, wasn't it? A moderately active man at my weight must eat 3,290 calories to maintain weight. I'm probably not that active. I'm still overeating. I can feel it in my stomach. This addiction is one of the hardest to kick. Jesus.

** That League on Linux trick didn't work. Shame. I've now tried several things and none worked. I'm not really interested in digging around. I run league in Win8 VM. It can have serious FPS drops, and even at full screen, Virtualbox doesn't always place nice with my cursor placement (especially towards the edges). It works well enough though. I only play ARAM. Of course, that doesn't prevent me from swearing when it messes up.
** Made some edits too.

** We'll see about fixing it on Monday.
