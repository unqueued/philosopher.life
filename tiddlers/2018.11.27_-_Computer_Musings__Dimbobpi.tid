!! On dimbob (since I can afford to lose root on it):

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
mkdir ~/dats
cd ~/dats
echo 'dat://6ca5bfb34c0bbfa8751b6d85f591b7a007b89df7207dc0aa9885bf00be610c8f' >> feeds #kickscondor
echo "hypercored --cwd /home/pi/storage/dats" > /home/pi/storage/dats/services
sudo su
npm install -g hypercored dat add-to-systemd lil-pids
add-to-systemd dat-lil-pids $(which lil-pids) /home/pi/storage/dats/services /home/pi/storage/dats/pids
systemctl enable dat-lil-pids
systemctl start dat-lil-pids
exit
```

Voila. Fuck it.

!! On dallas:

Stripped everything out and went for it on root. Also did an upgrade.

`add-to-systemd dat-lil-pids $(which lil-pids) /home/h0p3/dats/services /home/h0p3/dats/pids`

Insane mistake with git. [[JHBFC]].

[[kicks]] now has 2 dat nodes of mine up. Doesn't look like he has it set to auto-update. I'm a fan of the dat public key over the domain name specifically because we can own the private keys, but we can never truly own our domain names on the internet.
