[7:28 PM] robotic_scarab: Can you tell what this is of?

[7:34 PM] h0p3: I'm afraid not. Rorschach time. I see a human body as the trunk of a tree with the upper limbs (and head) and branches. I see psychedelic teeth and vertebrae.
[7:35 PM] robotic_scarab: yes!! you're the only one to see the whole thing so far :blush:
[7:35 PM] robotic_scarab: everyone sees the tree but the legs are too trunk like I guess
[7:54 PM] h0p3: Yay! :smiley: I like when I can see correctly (or at least appear to). Also, I'm surprised the trunk is the hard part. Those legs look ripped muscular to me. Reminds me of anatomy.
[7:54 PM] h0p3: How was the image produced?
[7:55 PM] h0p3: It feels shiny.
[7:56 PM] robotic_scarab: So I took an anatomy muscle drawing and an old-looking tree drawing and messed with them in photoshop before printing and transferring to a rubber like carving material
[7:56 PM] robotic_scarab: Printed with plain old rubber stamp ink
[7:56 PM] robotic_scarab: "shine" would probably be where some of the ink is patchier in places
[7:57 PM] robotic_scarab: This is only 2" x 3" ...
[7:57 PM] robotic_scarab: hard to fit that much detail in!
[7:59 PM] robotic_scarab: another one I did this week!

[8:00 PM] h0p3: I would never have guessed 2x3"
[8:04 PM] h0p3: I know basically nothing about art, so I can only talk about how it makes me feel (and poorly at that). Both have a perilous and haunting effect on me.
[8:05 PM] h0p3: They aren't the same, but they remind me of this one guy I like: Zdzislaw Beksinski.
[8:06 PM] h0p3: What brought these images to your mind?
[11:09 PM] robotic_scarab: (sorry for leaving you hanging!)
[11:09 PM] robotic_scarab: perilous and haunting wasn't the vibe I started going for but it feels right to me for these images
[11:10 PM] robotic_scarab: oooo I like this guy's surrealism
[11:10 PM] robotic_scarab: it reminds me of de Chirico but with a side of undead horror
[11:11 PM] robotic_scarab: so with letterboxing I've been thinking about things to carve, and pretty much that exact image (or very similar) of the head in the clouds popped into my mind's eye
[11:12 PM] robotic_scarab: so then I kept thinking about combining nature & the body and legs = tree trunk was the next thing that came to mind
[11:13 PM] robotic_scarab: I had a lot of fun carving those tree branches - I might just make another 2x3" block but zoomed much closer into the branches
[11:13 PM] robotic_scarab: I'm also doing these on "speedy carve" which is a pink rubbery surface
[11:14 PM] robotic_scarab: very different from the battleship grey linoleum I usually use
[11:14 PM] robotic_scarab: the pink stuff is extremely easy to cut through, compared to the linoleum
[11:15 PM] robotic_scarab: which made the curves of the tree branches and clouds as easy as wiggling the knife
[11:15 PM] robotic_scarab: much trickier to do curves in the harder linoleum
[11:15 PM] robotic_scarab: the pink stuff feels sketchier and looser because of that (even though I'm getting really tight with the detail in 2x3 blocks)
[6:22 PM] h0p3: de Chirico is cool too! :smiley:
[6:24 PM] h0p3: Reminds me of painting and sculpting. Do you mock anything up before you do your carving?
[6:24 PM] h0p3: I think I would strongly prefer the ease of cutting.
[6:28 PM] robotic_scarab: I do! I usually make a black and white image in photoshop then transfer that onto the block
[6:28 PM] robotic_scarab: Shep gave me thoughts on these as I worked through them today!

[6:28 PM] robotic_scarab: (These are the photoshop beginnings of a few blocks)
[6:29 PM] h0p3: left side look like aquatic fins to me
[6:32 PM] robotic_scarab: I'm exploring botanical renditionings of tree leaves
