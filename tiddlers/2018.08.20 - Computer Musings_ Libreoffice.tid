title: 2018.08.20 - Computer Musings: Libreoffice

LibreOffice turns out to be a pita to install. I'm a bit surprised. Fuck it. I'll VM. ROFL That failed too. Sho's music list did open in GDocs though. So be it.

Saw a cryptocoin with anonymous messaging built into it. With other tools, layers are nice, as usual. I like that it attempts to do something. Still not convinced it's better than [[Outopos]] itself.  

Fuck the sybil attack. Build trust directly. My prediction is that blockchains that will be the most useful will shard for performance. It's the only option. I think only certain kinds of trust and monetary models can arise from it, and [[T42T]] may be at the heart of it. Learn your lessons from Bittorrent folks, one of the oldest federated pseudo-blockchains.

In any case, I can't find suitable decentralized messenger replacements that are multi-device and cross-platform. It is a ridiculously hard problem.

I think I killed xonsh somehow? I do not know how? Libreoffice install and uninstall may have fucked me up? I don't see why. Yikes!
