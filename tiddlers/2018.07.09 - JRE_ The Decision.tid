title: 2018.07.09 - JRE: The Decision

My brother [[JRE]] called me today. 

It sounds heartbreaking with Raylan and Rebecca. He is facing decisions, and I've gotta be his supporter!

He said he was sorry about not having the best attitude when I asked him to think about his commitments and to talk to himself. I told him there was no need to apologize, that I loved him, and I hope to be of use to him. 

We talked for a while about the surrounding issues, how to reason about it, etc. He talked about the Parfit problem with the man who makes a promise to his wife. I wish I could help him more.

My brother wants to feel motivated through Adderall, but I explained how I thought it might not help him {[[Focus]]} on what really matters.
