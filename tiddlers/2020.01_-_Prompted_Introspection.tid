!! Audit:

* I'm tempted to have a caveman tag and write in that voice more. 
* Weird to see answers which are so temporary.
* I've despised the "wish" questions for the most part. 
** Probably still worth thinking about when you have that much a visceral reaction.
* My attempts to be silly were general failures, but I did an okay job of trying to come up with specifics rather than complete answers in cases where I'm tired of answering completely.
* I don't know many parents who would agree to anti-natalism. I'm like some kind of monster for agreeing to such a thing. 
** Similarly for the distinction between [[love]] and like.
* OOooo, you found a [[Relic]]! That is exceptionally rare. =).
** And from a wish question too. I can't really hate on it too much. Look at what it did.
* I kind of want to clump things together which are related but aren't similar questions. 
** I have no idea how to do that.
