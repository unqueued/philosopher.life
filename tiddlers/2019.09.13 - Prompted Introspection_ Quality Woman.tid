title: 2019.09.13 - Prompted Introspection: Quality Woman

!! What is the quality you like most in a woman?

A radical, sacrificial pursuit of [[The Golden Rule]]: balancing their egoism correctly by calculating and binding themselves to [[The Moral Law]]. It's easy to be nice and likable. That's simply not kindness itself. Those who know when to hate appropriately are the only sort who can [[love]] appropriately as well. I like when they throw themselves on the line where it matters most. It's the same answer for men.
