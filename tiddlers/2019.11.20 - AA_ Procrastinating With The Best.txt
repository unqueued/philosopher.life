How's your week going?
Nov 20, 2019 2:21pm
Pretty ok â€”so excited about Thanksgiving ðŸ¦ƒ and winding down to a stopping place in each class
Nov 20, 2019 2:24pm
The anticipation of a holiday and the memory of it might be at least 50% of it's utility, I think.
Nov 20, 2019 2:25pm
I have found another person in the pit â€”trying to help her scrape out too
Nov 20, 2019 2:25pm
Thanksgiving has good memories of family and food joy
Nov 20, 2019 2:25pm
It makes me smile that you look forward to the event so much. I hope when I get older, I'll be able to unify my family and build memories as effectively as you do. It's just gorgeous.
Nov 20, 2019 2:26pm
I am sorry they are in the pit. Scraping out, lol. =) That is such a good word for it. 
Nov 20, 2019 2:26pm
ðŸ˜Š I am excited about the cabin too â€”family and laughter â€”and always food joy
Nov 20, 2019 2:26pm
I will need to build a dictionary of your vocabulary of the phenomenology of it. 
Nov 20, 2019 2:26pm
Hehe itâ€™s certainly a journey
Nov 20, 2019 2:27pm
Hell yeah. It has been so long since I've been on a vacation (beyond a staycation). 
Nov 20, 2019 2:27pm
How are [[UJ]] and [[AG]] doing?
Nov 20, 2019 2:29pm
Also, if [[UJ]] ever wants to have an especially annoying chatbuddy (he deals with enough children already, I am sure), send him my way (I prefer signal, but I'll use whatever is necessary). It's rare that I have the chance to speak with him. 
Nov 20, 2019 2:31pm
They are doing well â€”[[UJ]] is much less stressed now that they have moved a few kids to behavioral programs
Nov 20, 2019 2:32pm
Controlling the chaos.

How's the week been going for ya?
Nov 25, 2019 2:09pm
Pretty good â€”procrastinating with the best of them hehe how are you?
Nov 25, 2019 2:12pm
Pretty good. Still trying to find a place. Packing some. 
Nov 25, 2019 2:14pm
Packing is not fun
Nov 25, 2019 2:15pm
Have they helped with housing suggestions?
Nov 25, 2019 2:19pm
Their agency just sent us a packet. Not much help on that front, lol.
Nov 25, 2019 2:19pm
Bleh
Nov 25, 2019 2:19pm
There are areas we prefer.
Nov 25, 2019 2:20pm
Is there such a thing as staff housing or house parents?
Nov 25, 2019 2:20pm
Not from what I've seen.
