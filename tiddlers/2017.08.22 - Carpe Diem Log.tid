title: 2017.08.22 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up before the alarm, but just snoozed on and off until it landed.
* I've streamlined getting up, I think,
* Worked my buns off (not really, buns still there, blooming)
* Came home, laid down, Archer.
* Wife came home after taking the kids swimming. 
* Chili and cornbread.
* Rick and Morty, then True Blood.
