title: 2018.12.19 - MTG Log: Le Coach

I coached while I cooked this morning. They were good matches. My daughter crushed both games, including me being with my son. She has finally beat me. =)

We dropped a T2 SGC and MWM. She inc'd and dropped blocker to survive, and then she switched from control to beatdown off a single whirler. Lots of excellent moves on both side of the digital table. I am so excited to see them prove to themselves that they can beat me. Now we must practice, practice, practice. We will get them up to 40% against me; it's a good thing I adore Goblins because playing the mirror into oblivion could be tiresome, lol.

It is clear that they are getting better at playing the game. Construction still needs a ton of work. My son's substitutions were awful, and my daughter didn't make any. We will get there. I'm waiting to see who finds the Pyromancer first (including whether or not they choose to read these words). I'll let 'em enjoy it for a game before I temporarily ban that shit. That shit's OP, yo. Maybe I should build that deck just to show them? Ugh, I really want them to find it! I want them to see the value in searching for the [[diamonds]] and [[redpills]] the [[MTG]] metagames/contexts. I'm hoping that we will have a mini metagame shift with Pyromancer; they need to see what it means for a sublationary card to warp the metagame not only into "who built the deck around the //i-win// card the best?" but then into "who drew the i-win card first?". Eventually, when you hit the rock-paper-scissors mode, the game ceases to be a game: it's just luck at that point. It can never be [[Good]] in itself, even though there is a [[good]] in its language (a good for the sake of winning). Then we shall reduce this once game to absurdity; it can only ever be instrumentally valuable. Finally, we shall point to [[The Telos]]. The game is a'foot. I'm going to show them the [[salient]] grid of the world like no father before me; lulz.
