I hope your Easter is going well.
26 MIN AGO
It was really good.  Since I got back from NC I've been going to a new church and I really like.  I did that this morning and then went to KY for lunch with the rents.
24 MIN AGO
How was yours?
24 MIN AGO
Noice! That sounds excellent.
24 MIN AGO
What do you like about the new church?
23 MIN AGO
Mine has been solid.
23 MIN AGO
Felt like a zombie yesterday, took ketamine today, and I'm back.
23 MIN AGO
Family talked until 10:15, then we had to send folks to bed.
23 MIN AGO
Sounds good.  It's a Reformed Presbyterian soooo, there's a lot I like.
21 MIN AGO
That makes sense!
21 MIN AGO
I like the structure, all three Sunday's have been using OT and NT scripture.
20 MIN AGO
The Pastor seems really good, the church folk themselves are a little hesitant to welcome but I understand that.
19 MIN AGO
And I like the structure that seems a little like Catholic Lite.
19 MIN AGO
Lol.
19 MIN AGO
But apparently the Reformed means they're Calvinists.
18 MIN AGO
I'm glad you love the structure. My wife is extremely interested in structure as well (though she comes from a Pentecostal background).
17 MIN AGO
I mean, I was raised Southern Baptist and went to a First Assembly of God for 3 years.
16 MIN AGO
Talk about non-structured.
16 MIN AGO
I've seen a lot of people more toward higher-steeple and more structure or even the Orthodox from evangelical backgrounds.
16 MIN AGO
Imo, this is really just how I feel and could understand the shift, it's all the non-denominational shit that's becoming prevalent.  The non-don and neo-baptist stuff is turning folks like me away.
14 MIN AGO
I can see that.
14 MIN AGO
But anyways, did ya'll have a good dinner with all the fixins?
11 MIN AGO
Lamb roast, veggies, potatoes. Apple strudel. We ate and read our wikis together.
9 MIN AGO
Sounds delightful.  I've had lamb but only with a gyro.
8 MIN AGO
It is an extremely rare treat for us. They had lamb at Aldis on special.
7 MIN AGO
I like that store a lot.
7 MIN AGO
Nice.  I need to find my Aldis that's near me.
7 MIN AGO
It really is a good place.
6 MIN AGO
Not too many options, but just enough. I can get in and out. It's cheap.
6 MIN AGO
Oh, the ol in out in out.
5 MIN AGO
My love!
5 MIN AGO
I still say that from time to time.
5 MIN AGO
I don't think I've watched that movie since we watched it in college.
5 MIN AGO
lol
5 MIN AGO
Watched //Dogma// last night, //Dumb and Dumber// today. I don't know when we'll hit that one. Soon enough.
4 MIN AGO
We have to build a strong memebase.
4 MIN AGO
The whole fam watched Dogma?
4 MIN AGO
Aye. This was our second time through with the kids. They laughed a lot more this time.
4 MIN AGO
:flushed:
3 MIN AGO
I'll wait to introduce my kiddo to that one.  lol
3 MIN AGO
I am considered an extremist on the issue, I realize, lol.
1 MIN AGO
She likes those murder/rape shows my mom watches on TrueTV
NOW
Googling.
20 MIN AGO
Neat.
20 MIN AGO
No way, I hate those things.
20 MIN AGO
Ah. Yeah, I don't watch them either.
20 MIN AGO
Some people find them a lot more thrilling than I do though.
19 MIN AGO
I guess, i don't get it.
19 MIN AGO
I prefer the less macabre, or at least fictionally macabre.
19 MIN AGO
What are your favorites, the ones you watch again and again?
18 MIN AGO
Pulp Fiction is a must.
18 MIN AGO
Preach.
18 MIN AGO
Tombstone.
18 MIN AGO
Classic.
17 MIN AGO
Ace Ventura 2
17 MIN AGO
Lol! Why 2?
16 MIN AGO
Because it's way better than the first.
16 MIN AGO
But one is good too.
16 MIN AGO
Just not nearly as good as 2.
16 MIN AGO
Thinking back on it, I agree.
16 MIN AGO
Bumble bee tuna.
15 MIN AGO
Nice to see you too ;P
14 MIN AGO
Watch any new good movies?
14 MIN AGO
The Highwaymen was pretty good on Netflix.
14 MIN AGO
Coming down now. Never heard of it.
13 MIN AGO
I'm a hermit, and I'm unfortunately unaware of most of what happens around me, lol.
12 MIN AGO
I have seen a few good movies though; it gets harder to find good ones (I must be getting old and cranky...get off my lawn).
12 MIN AGO
Samsara still makes me weep...10 times into it.
11 MIN AGO
Hunt for the Wilderpeople
10 MIN AGO
The Big Kahuna
10 MIN AGO
Ex Machina
10 MIN AGO
Samsara?
10 MIN AGO
If you would like, I'll send you a copy.
9 MIN AGO
I am a fan of Resilio Sync.
9 MIN AGO
There's like two of them.
8 MIN AGO
I've only seen one.
8 MIN AGO
Oh, the wilderpeople has the kid from Deadpool 2.
7 MIN AGO
https://www.barakasamsara.com/
7 MIN AGO
Yes. That movie was awful though. Hunt for the Wilderpeople was outstanding. I don't know how many times I've seen it.
7 MIN AGO
Hard to live up to Deadpool though.
7 MIN AGO
Hard to continue working with that schtick, imho.
6 MIN AGO
Arrival and that new Spiderman movie were good too. My brother, [[JRE]], recommended or took me to half of these movies.
6 MIN AGO
How is he doing?
5 MIN AGO
If you have not seen it (I had never heard of it until recently), The Big Kahuna is the one you should watch first.
5 MIN AGO
Is he still with the rents?
5 MIN AGO
He is doing the best of we 3 brothers.
4 MIN AGO
Union electrician job, well-trained, well-paid, maximum flexibility and workers rights on the job. Union here didn't take me as an apprentice sadly; my pipefitter skills would have been useful since I've reasonable experience with threadpipe.
3 MIN AGO
Louisville has a lot of work.
2 MIN AGO
He lives with his SO, Rebecca.
2 MIN AGO
They are trying to adopt.
2 MIN AGO
He is a VR pornography apostle and a woodworker in his spare time.
2 MIN AGO
Not married?
1 MIN AGO
VR porn apostle?
1 MIN AGO
He is divorced and will likely never marry unless legally obligated or forced for the adoption.
1 MIN AGO
He preaches the gospel of virtual reality pornography. He's right. It's amazing.
NOW
LOL
NOW
Nice.
NOW
Who was your youngest bro?  What's he doing?
17 MIN AGO
Did [[JRE]] marry someone from Berea?
17 MIN AGO
[[JRE]] married someone he worked with in Thailand. A troubled missionary. It went poorly.
16 MIN AGO
I think he hated me for whatever reason.
16 MIN AGO
Maybe not hate but strongly dislike.
15 MIN AGO
OMG spit it out man.
14 MIN AGO
Lol!
14 MIN AGO
I cannot speak for the man, and I wouldn't want to put words into his mouth. Pushed to it, I would say he was unhappy with some comments you've made about women; I think he has significant concerns with your historical views on race, gender, and class.
13 MIN AGO
:shrug:
13 MIN AGO
I'm not everyone's cup o tea.
13 MIN AGO
Image attached to message
12 MIN AGO
Ever see this?
12 MIN AGO
It's a classic.
12 MIN AGO
My brother is significantly redpilled about human sexual mating behaviors and social dynamics, but it's possible you both still have profound disagreements. I cannot speak for either of you well enough.
11 MIN AGO
I was about to say, maybe when I meet a woman to actually prove me wrong or change my opinion, I will, but until then... hoes gonna be hoes.
10 MIN AGO
Among those whom I've disagreed with so profoundly, I've always admired your willingness to talk about it plainly.
10 MIN AGO
There is some serious integrity in the way in which you engage dialectics and disagreement. I have learned a lot from you in that regard.
9 MIN AGO
I too am an outcast in many circles.
9 MIN AGO
Seriously man, it sucks having to withhold your opinions all the time because if you didn't you'd be shunned.
8 MIN AGO
It is why I will fight for your right to anonymous free speech, even though I think your identity is invalidated by your egregious beliefs.
7 MIN AGO
I shun, ofc.
7 MIN AGO
But, I also listen.
6 MIN AGO
Odds are good I still have more hours clocked on 4chan.
6 MIN AGO
I leave breadcrumbs to my true opinion to those that I engage in discourse.  Unless you're a friend and then you pretty much get no filter Matthew.
6 MIN AGO
lol, from what I've seen 4chan is cucked these days.  Is it 8chan that took its place?
5 MIN AGO
Seems like it split in many directions.
5 MIN AGO
Mook or whatever his name was turned Spaz and started censoring shit.
5 MIN AGO
Even Hotwheels regrets 8chan
5 MIN AGO
Reddit has now suffered the same fate.
4 MIN AGO
I am grieved by the censorship I see.
4 MIN AGO
The only thing they don't tolerate is views contrary to their own.
4 MIN AGO
I should have the right to filter you out of my feeds (and rely upon the trust I have vested in others to filter for me), but I should not be able to moderate you out of the conversation entirely for everyone.
3 MIN AGO
^^
3 MIN AGO
Agree.
3 MIN AGO
Toleration comes in degrees and kinds.
3 MIN AGO
But, hate speech is not free speech etc.
3 MIN AGO
I am disgusted by anyone who opposed free speech as a political right. I deny your moral right to say whatever you want to say, but I must protect your political right.
2 MIN AGO
Comes back to the whole, "when they came for the jews, I did not say anything..."
2 MIN AGO
That silly quote.

1 MIN AGO
Chomsky is right.
1 MIN AGO
(even though he is Left)
1 MIN AGO
That's the problem, the people doing right aren't willing to be as extreme as the opposite side, like you're favorite author said, "when good compromises with evil, evil always wins."
11 MIN AGO
Your*
11 MIN AGO
There I can't agree with you on multiple points.
10 MIN AGO
I suppose I need to ask what it means to "compromise." I think T42T (Tit For Two Tats) requires testing waters to restart the possibility of cooperation in iterated prisoner's dilemmas.
9 MIN AGO
Even the Pavlov strategy will do that. It is possible this forgiveness is a form of compromise.
8 MIN AGO
It is turning the other cheek.
8 MIN AGO
I think the righteous can be just as extreme as the wicked (perhaps even sacrifically more extreme).
7 MIN AGO
I'm too good at turning the other cheek, wish I were a little less forgiving with most people.  Even though I would like to think I'm otherwise.
7 MIN AGO
But, I can understand tit for two tats, but it's more like after two tats I'm beating you with a fucking brick.
6 MIN AGO
It is "turn the other cheek"
6 MIN AGO
I am in favor of violence in some contexts; The Golden Rule commands it.
6 MIN AGO
I agree.
5 MIN AGO
But, I am probably more in favor of violence than you.
5 MIN AGO
At least in college
5 MIN AGO
I have no idea.
5 MIN AGO
In college, I was a pacifist.
5 MIN AGO
Yes, you were, very much so.
3 MIN AGO
Not to freq hop on you, but I think I'm going to get baptized after I've made certain about this church.
3 MIN AGO
Neat.
2 MIN AGO
Not that I expected a big response given your feelings about God and all, but I don't talk to many people about that.
2 MIN AGO
I hear ya. Lol. It's not easy to find people to speak with, imho.
1 MIN AGO
I baptized my own children. They are powerful memories to me.
NOW
That's awesome, I never did it for a few reasons but I'm done putting it off and dodging it.
SUN 11:54 PM
Anyways.
SUN 11:54 PM
This will be your first baptism?
SUN 11:55 PM
Yessir.
SUN 11:55 PM
That is fascinating.
SUN 11:55 PM
I know, right?
SUN 11:55 PM
What do you think Baptism means?
SUN 11:56 PM
(or, should I say my thought first?)
SUN 11:56 PM
I can't do communion at this new church, they specify "baptized Christians" and while I've been baptized in the Blood, I have not with water.
SUN 11:56 PM
Your first though.
SUN 11:56 PM
Thought
SUN 11:56 PM
Baptism is the new circumcision. It is a mark that you are meant to be set apart. It is not salvific. There is only one mark.
SUN 11:57 PM
You can be saved without Baptism as well.
SUN 11:58 PM
I believe that as well.
SUN 11:58 PM
You are full of surprises.
SUN 11:58 PM
That is an orthodox move I do not see often.
SUN 11:59 PM
It's just the public acknowledgement of Salvation, the public announcement of living a Godly life and being expected to be held to that standard by your brothers and sisters of the church and faith.
SUN 11:59 PM
What move?
SUN 11:59 PM
Ah, well...maybe we part then.
SUN 11:59 PM
I'm arguing about a set of rules and interpretations which don't directly matter to me anymore. That probably seems weird.
16 MIN AGO
I've had many arguments with people that don't believe in things as I do, but I welcome the argument.  Helps me sharpen that sword of the word.
15 MIN AGO
Presbyterians believe in child baptisms and I'm still not convinced on that one point.  I could be made to change my mind but it's not too important of a disagreement imo.
14 MIN AGO
I still believe in circumcision.
14 MIN AGO
Aye. It is why I asked.
14 MIN AGO
And judging by what I see on Reddit I should be put to death for that.
13 MIN AGO
You don't believe what I said then.
13 MIN AGO
No, I know what you mean by it, my point is that it's NOT required for salvation, so it's really a minor bickering issues imo.
13 MIN AGO
That's the one holdover I have from my Baptist upbringing.  But if I had a child with another believer and she wanted to baptize them I'd be fine with it.
12 MIN AGO
If I were a Christian, I would not see it as a small matter. But, I agree: I think it is a minor issue.
12 MIN AGO
Like I said, I can understand both sides of the issue.
12 MIN AGO
Eh, symbolisms are minor imo.
11 MIN AGO
Surely you cannot mean what your symbols represent.
11 MIN AGO
You don't have to be baptized by water, you don't have to take communion...
10 MIN AGO
But they play an important part in the faith and should be respected.
10 MIN AGO
I think the world is one of signs, that I do not access things-in-themselves.
9 MIN AGO
My own  baptism has been a huge issue for myself, I've struggled with it since I was 13.
9 MIN AGO
(with perhaps some very unique exceptions)
9 MIN AGO
I think you mean these differences of opinion on Judeo-Christian symbols are minor.
8 MIN AGO
Yes, that's what I meant.
8 MIN AGO
I prefer just Christian.
8 MIN AGO
Not Judeo-Christian.
8 MIN AGO
Judaism became paganism after Christ fulfilled the prophecy.
7 MIN AGO
Not a fan of Dispensationalism.
7 MIN AGO
I no more believe modern Jews are going to heaven than I do Muslims.
6 MIN AGO
Not at all.
6 MIN AGO
Christ said "My sheep hear my voice, and follow me"
6 MIN AGO
The Bible must be an interesting read for you.
6 MIN AGO
Jews are clearly not his sheep then, since they ignored the call.
6 MIN AGO
Might I suggest that you grafted into a tree, and those who claimed to practice Judaism who failed to convert may not have really been in the tree to begin with. That will resolve some important problems for you.
4 MIN AGO
This is another Remnant problem.
4 MIN AGO
Perhaps that is another minor quibble.
3 MIN AGO
I appreciate your point quite a bit.
2 MIN AGO
Oh, we won't go there but I don't believe the modern Jews are the Israelites of the Bible.
2 MIN AGO
They are two distinct peoples.
2 MIN AGO
That is also a fascinating claim, lol.
2 MIN AGO
Are we distinguishing religious Judaism from a genetic lineage here?
1 MIN AGO
Of course.
1 MIN AGO
I have no problem with your claim.
1 MIN AGO
Like I said, there's too much to get into tonight.  I have to go to bed before 4 am, so there isn't a lot of time to hash out the Israelite/Jew difference.
22 MIN AGO
Lol. I hear that.
21 MIN AGO
But, basically the genetic Israelites heard Jesus' call and followed.
21 MIN AGO
That is my belief.
20 MIN AGO
Summarized in few words.
20 MIN AGO
I have never heard that theory before.
20 MIN AGO
It's not a very common one.
20 MIN AGO
As are a few others of mine, I'm sure.
19 MIN AGO
Constructing one's theology is hard work.
19 MIN AGO
I admire your dedication.
19 MIN AGO
I don't know I'd call it a construction when there is no end to it?
18 MIN AGO
I am fine with the word discovering too, if that is preferred.
18 MIN AGO
I cannot say I know what you by "there is no end to it".
17 MIN AGO
The Good is The End.
17 MIN AGO
It's a lot like a house.  You build your house out of basic materials, then you fill your house.  Then you remodel your house.  The you're always cleaning it, getting rid of things and acquiring more, refining and remodeling without end.
17 MIN AGO
Neyet.
17 MIN AGO
I can't agree with "The Good"
16 MIN AGO
Sure you can. It's perfectly orthodox.
16 MIN AGO
Not all that is Right or righteous is "good"
16 MIN AGO
Good for the sake of what?
16 MIN AGO
The Right is dialectically part of The Good.

15 MIN AGO
Well, I'm going to let you think on it. =)
14 MIN AGO
You may find my exact wording is not as problematic as you initially thought.
14 MIN AGO
We're always going to argue over whos Right and whos Good.
14 MIN AGO
There is only one, and it's neither of us, homie.
13 MIN AGO
I am a fan of your house analogy. Let me say that construction is often a dialectical oscillation between deconstruction+reconstruction.
12 MIN AGO
Well, sometimes you have to deconstruct to construct a stronger house.
12 MIN AGO
I speak of The Remodeling in my wiki quite a bit.
12 MIN AGO
I can handle like three of your wiki articles at a time.  My head starts to hurt and my fingers get sore from googling so much shit.
11 MIN AGO
And my computer is about to crash from all the links to links to links.
10 MIN AGO
I am sorry. I am a terrible writer.
10 MIN AGO
Wtfever.
10 MIN AGO
You do tend to write for yourself imo.
10 MIN AGO
It should not crash though. It all fits into a single file, and even a phone should be able to open and render enormous amounts of wiki.
10 MIN AGO
The first thing they teach you in public speaking is use language that your audience uses: you clearly don't intend for your audience to be the common man.
9 MIN AGO
Preach.
9 MIN AGO
Give me time.
9 MIN AGO
No, I mean from googling so much shit and words that it's like I have a virus from bangedup.com
9 MIN AGO
Lol!
8 MIN AGO
You remember in college when I'd wake up and my computer would have 148 internet links open?
8 MIN AGO
Good times.
8 MIN AGO
I have tried to move to a machine this week and failed. My daughter had to put my old machine back together for me.
8 MIN AGO
bangedup.com isn't the same anymore.  The closest thing is efukt.com
8 MIN AGO
Love them both.
8 MIN AGO
32 Xeon cores, 128GB RAM...$350 server off ebay.
7 MIN AGO
I'm having trouble fitting into 16GB of RAM these days because my browser windows are often very filled (and I use a lot of extensions/addons).
7 MIN AGO
128gigs of ram?
7 MIN AGO
holy shite
6 MIN AGO
aye. I usually use 20-30GB with swap
6 MIN AGO
My laptop uses 8 I think?
6 MIN AGO
I have had as many as a thousand tabs open at a time though.
6 MIN AGO
Resilio Sync is a whore too. Can easily eat 4GB with all of my syncs up.

(though, it is dirt cheap compared to so many other decentralized sync tools)

5 MIN AGO
You wanna hear a good self deprecating story?
4 MIN AGO
Ofc.
4 MIN AGO
You put this on your wiki I'll hunt you down and make a buffalo bill suit out of your ass.
4 MIN AGO
Don't say it!

Hey, I was somewhere where if it had to happen at least it happened there so it wasn't as bad.  No one was at the house, so I could clean up and deal with it alone.  That's about the most I could ask for.
15 MIN AGO
No doubt.
15 MIN AGO
What was your experience?
15 MIN AGO
When I get food poisoning (3 times), it is so painful I start blacking out, and the only way to stay awake and relieve myself: I lay facedown on the floor and shit straight up. I have sprayed the door, shower curtains, my hair, and, of course, it slathers my ballsack. I have been lucky not to have the kids walk in on it. My wife, however, has an incredible sense of smell, and I've woken her up with it. I am a worm crying in pain on the ground with shit covering me and the bathroom. It's feels like something out of Saw.
13 MIN AGO
I have no idea why she still fucks me.
13 MIN AGO
(though, I have two children come out of two-holes which became one)
13 MIN AGO
My goodness man.
12 MIN AGO
I think by that point I'd lay in the shower and just leave it on.
12 MIN AGO
Tried. Not comfortable enough, not enough space.
11 MIN AGO
Two holes became one.... yikes.
11 MIN AGO
I should consider just going outside next time.
11 MIN AGO
but, apartment complexes...
11 MIN AGO
That's always a choice, just wear dark boxers and leave them on.  Loose for drainage, dark for cover.
10 MIN AGO
I stick to darker pants these days for that reason.
10 MIN AGO
Ah, smart man. I should have just left my underwear on!
10 MIN AGO
Khaki shows EVERYTHING
10 MIN AGO
Aye, lol.
10 MIN AGO

It's a gamble everytime.
9 MIN AGO

8 MIN AGO
I am lucky not to be the schizoid homeless man wandering the streets.
8 MIN AGO
You found your woman early, that is a great thing.
8 MIN AGO
I'm done looking, I think.
8 MIN AGO
If I'm to meet one it won't be with me looking.
7 MIN AGO
Eh, that's prolly horse shit but I feel like that right now.
7 MIN AGO
I love women too much not to want one or try for one I like.
7 MIN AGO
Love/Hate.
7 MIN AGO
Aye. If there is light at the end of the tunnel which isn't an oncoming train: your market value continues to rise for the coming two decades. I'm a pessimistic man, but I am optimistic that you will find someone. Give it time, homie.
4 MIN AGO
I mean, my market value has done nothing but decline since college, so I'm glad someone is optimistic.
4 MIN AGO
I hope that I find someone that changes my outlook on women.
3 MIN AGO
Or proves me wrong, rather.
3 MIN AGO
The one thing I hope I'm wrong about, lol.
3 MIN AGO
I am strongly convinced you have not studied the topic enough. Feel good about being wrong. =)
