Hey homie!

I'm sorry you are feeling bad today. That sucks. And, of course, I am delighted to spank and bash a product of capitalism with you!

<<<
hey dude, how you going?
<<<

Oh, I've been very busy. I wake up late, and I do my thing until early the next morning. I've been working on [[monster-16]] and doing schoolwork with the offspring. It's been good and still a whirlwind. 

<<<
just had a brief chat on whatsapp with k0sh3k...
<<<

You know, after she left FB (though she went back), you were one of the very few people who maintained any contact with her. I will never forget it. I learned a lot about how her relationships stacked up against each other by thinking about you.

I was troubled and angry when I heard what your so-called "friend" did to you. That is //fucked// up. I'm sorry. I spoke with my offspring for a couple hours about it in dialecture.<<ref "d">> It's painful to think about, let alone live with what our relationships are and what they are supposed to be, and your pain required our reflection.

<<<
I finally finished stranger things (season 3) the other night, despite having to watch the last couple episodes alone because Ed went off it totally.
<<<

Ha, why was he off it? What shows does Ed like to watch normally? 

My friend [[Sphygmus]] recently [[recommended some shows|2019.07.29 - Sphygmus: Strangely, Rewind]] to me. Do you have any you think I should [[watch|TV: Library]] as well?<<ref "i">>

<<<
I was off it, too, but wanted to finish out of loyalty, i guess.
<<<

Lawd, I have this problem. It's a sunk cost fallacy. I have an easier time putting books down early, but once I'm far enough into them, I feel obligated (irrationally in at least some cases). I've been working on putting shows down too in [[TV: Exploration]], but it's way harder with shows that have at one time been stellar for me (it's like they've earned the benefit of the doubt).

<<<
Also, I want to rip the piss out of it and read other people doing it online, but cannae without having seen it, I felt.
<<<

I don't read too much about shows, but I should. I have a hard time finding the will to enter that scene. It would probably help me reason more effectively though.

<<<
Haven't had the chance to look up online gossip/bashing, yet, but I mentioned to k0sh3k and she is too sentimental about the 80s thing (she admitted), haha. But she said you hated it also so I thought yay, let's have some S.T bashing!!!

`:)`
<<<

It feels like a moneygrab and nostalgia hack. I [[just watched|2019.07.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Can't Stop]] the show, and I've already forgotten it. I think [[it attempted|2019.07.09 - Wiki Review: Suspicious Things]] to play off and exploit our political climate without making any commitments, a neutral-appearing enlightened-centrist reactionary move. They tried to appeal to everyone, and in doing so, they made an argument for my enemy. It was preachy through the mouths of children,<<ref "u">> and there was no attempt at integrity.

The New Cold War fervor is misdirection too. 

Surrealism can be beautiful, but I think it can also be terrifying and schizophrenic in a bad way. Watching this load of propaganda felt surreal to me, and it made me sick my stomach. The only unblemished [[beauty]] about the show is dat music.

I'm pretty sure most people would accuse me of raining on their parade, like they should be able to consume these drugs without any reflection. Fuck that.

<<<
(I'm also not in a very great mood at the moment, anyway, so feeling hateful is feeling good, hahhaha!)

Okay, gotta get to work. Poo.

Take care! Sho
<<<

You too! We gotta blow some shit up, yo. Take a massive shit on the show with me. What irked you?

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
