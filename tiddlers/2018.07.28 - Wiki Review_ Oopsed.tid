title: 2018.07.28 - Wiki Review: Oopsed

* [[compressed-backup.sh]]
** Sexy. It does a fine job.
* [[m10: Root's crontab]]
** It does the job. I've been watching it.
* [[2018.07.27 - Computers Musings: Gtrdn]]
** Well, now that I'm compressing, it will do nicely.
* [[2018.07.27 - Wiki Audit: Crawling]]
** I'm excited to find ways to build my computing around this wiki more effectively.
* [[2018.07.27 - Prompted Introspection: Memory]]
** Deja vu...I swore I responded to this.
* [[2018.07.27 - Wiki Review: It's Crystallizing]]
** I'm glad I decided to just make more tiddlers to contain stuff. Sometimes that is just the best answer.
* [[2018.07.27 - Carpe Diem: Need Sleep]]
** Really not enough sleep.
* [[2018.07.28 - Daily TDL: Will I Finish?]]
** I keep carrying over a rolling TDL list...
* [[2018.07.27 - Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos]]
** It is nice about being obsessive.
* [[i3-layout-autostart.sh]]
** This kind of script is exactly why I love i3.
* [[2018.07.26 - Prompted Introspection: 5-Year Plan]]
** Do it!
* [[2018.07.26 - Wiki Review: Conky]]
** Btw, I'm still loving this mouse hover popup for links.

AND...I'm losing my god damned mind. Here you go, was in my Carpe Diem (I keep messing this up).

* [[compressed-backup.sh]]
** I should test run it.
* [[m10: Root's crontab]]
** Timeshift is working; I've not tested a rollback.
* [[2018.07.27 - Computers Musings: Gtrdn]]
** I did get some stuff done. I'm glad about that.
* [[2018.07.27 - Wiki Audit: Crawling]]
** This is a good idea. Between CLI/npm and i3, I should be in good shape.
* [[2018.07.27 - Prompted Introspection: Memory]]
** Yes, sir!
* [[2018.07.27 - Wiki Review: It's Crystallizing]]
** Weird to have a "Ditto!!" that was different in a sense.
* [[2018.07.27 - Carpe Diem: Need Sleep]]
** Completed
* [[2018.07.28 - Daily TDL: Will I Finish?]]
** Fuck no, I won't.
* [[2018.07.27 - Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos]]
** I slowly move through this book. Some is better than none, yo!
* [[i3-layout-autostart.sh]]
** This is making my life a billion times easier already, btw.
* [[2018.07.26 - Prompted Introspection: 5-Year Plan]]
** I saw late.
* [[2018.07.26 - Wiki Review: Conky]]
** Sorry, yo.
