title: 2018.07.25 - Computers Musings: Almost Finished With i3 Setup

IRC setup. Decided to register again.

Discord and Slack installed. =(

Another GPG problem. 

Setup Discord a bit.

Not autostarting Slack though.

I finalized [[.i3/config]] enough for the kids to use it.

Conky shortcuts file ([[/usr/share/conky/conky_shortcuts_live_maia]]) is getting a major facelift. Adjusting background image to fit in like a glove if I can.

Setup [[visudo]] to give automated root for pcmanfm and mousepad on request to h0p3. I realize that this is consider a huge security no-no (even for a PC). Sorry, bros. YOLO. In fact, I'm autostarting them now. I never want to have to fiddle with it if I don't have to.

Never edited `/etc/sudoers.d/10-installer` before...

I didn't realize the order mattered. Killed sudo access. Glad to have a spare KDE thumbdrive which automounts to change it right.

Still struggling to windows placed correctly on the workspaces.

Conky is sexed up. I built both pieces to have exactly what I want.

Konsole for Dolphin set.

Resized windows in i3. Now I want to find a way to save layouts.
