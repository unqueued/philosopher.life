title: 2019.09.02 - Wiki Review: There Ya Go

* [[2019.09.01 - Family Log: My Turn]]
** But, the schoolwork. You know, we've had it worse. The transition for my daughter has been awful, but my son has made enormous progress. Ups and downs. We'll keep at it (what else are we going to do?).
* [[2019.09.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Family Day]]
** You know how time flies when you are having fun? WoW is compressing the [[phenomenology]] of my days.
* [[2019.09.01 - Wiki Review: Brief Here Though]]
** We need to go shopping soon enough. We can do one more day without, I suppose.
* [[2019.09.01 - Prompted Introspection: Bes Q; <3 LM]]
** A conversation I have basically everyday with my wife. My offspring bring it up often too. They say I think almost everyone is evil, and yet I hope to be gullible and trusting. I am torn, I know. 
* [[2019.09.01 - TDL: Bot]]
** It's gonna be another beast with passthrough and botting.
* [[2019.09.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Y U NO C?]]
** Yeah, I saw a thread which annoyed this shit out of me on HN. There ya' go.
* [[2019.08 - Wiki Review]]
** Will need to be completed later.
*** Also, where is your grafting?
* [[2019.08 - TDL]]
** Lost in having fun. It's what I want to do with my life. Ugh.
* [[2019.08 - Prompted Introspection]]
** This log has been unpredictable. Sometimes, I pour myself into it, and othertimes I think the question is stupid. This is how it has gone for years for though. 
*** Also, I hope I stop asking whether or not this merits a [[Monthly Audit]]. It captures so much.
* [[2019.08 - Family Log]]
** We're not getting the job at Yale. No way.
* [[2019.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]
** Completed. The month passed so very quickly, but it was wonderful. This has been the best month I've had in a long time. I adore my drug.
* [[2019.08 - Antipleonasm Analysis]]
** I'm digesting, but I have so little to say. This was an emotional one for me.
