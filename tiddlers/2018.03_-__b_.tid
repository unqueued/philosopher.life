!! Audit:

* Dark and honest, as usual.
* It served as a serious outlet.
* I'm going to more actively monkeywrench.
* I had a serious PII slip. Glad I fixed it.
* This was the beginning of writing more of my axioms. Good work!
* This is a place to wrestle with myself, those I love, and everyone else.
* I continue to shape {[[About]]} from here, and I noticed that I also made an [[About: /b/]]. Keep going.
* I'd argue I have less to say directly to my donors. This is good. I need to let them go.
* I very much respect my brother JRE.
* My wife and I have been arguing about FB (for the past decade). I may finally have convinced her. I hope I have. This is important. 
* Some of these are downright funny (while still being serious?).
