title: 2017.02.12 -- Realpolitik Speculation: Devices of the Hyperclass

The gnostic "Illuminati" and "Targeted Individuals" conspiracy theorists see many false shadows, but I believe they have felt and identified a real political undercurrent in the world. Let me be clear, they are fucking crazy, yo. And, yet, we should still listen to the murmurs and mumbling of crazy people. Their insanity is not entirely accidental, and the causes and triggers are worth examining. Unfortunately, they are crucially right (and have been for a long time) about the existence of the deep state, dark money, mass surveillance, and the absurd power inequalities in our world. Their exaggerations, lack of tact and careful examination, however, allows us to dismiss them. This ad hominem, unfortunately, is not always accurate (the fallacy itself is actually fallacious sometimes).

Even the sometimes less fringe-like appearing (but still crazy) libertarians are often half-right about many things (dat Lockean allure and Randian charm, lulz). The fact is that the federal reserve and the monetary policy of the US (which has profound impact on the monetary policy of the world) is not answerable to the people of the US, not controlled by elected officials, and is clearly owned and operated by multi-national corporations and their pets.<<ref "1">> 

The Bilderberg Group and its ilk are real. What we've been reading about the NSA, and other governments (and branches of corporate intelligence), has been true for many decades (Snowden was not a revelation to those of us paying attention; he was only vindication). Our political scientists know that [[the average person has no power or influence|https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/div-classtitletesting-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizensdiv/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B]]. Ironically, even some academics used to justify the status quo are bought and sold (have you see the clinical psychopathy rates in Economics professors? [let us be clear, the virtue theorist can actually unfallaciously wield //ad hominem// attacks]). We are not our own masters (not that we ever were). 

Let us not assume that some cabal of individuals has carefully choreographed every detail of every move in the world. That would be absurd (and I suspect a childish strawman used to irrationally defend the hyperclass). Politics is obviously far messier and more volatile than that. Political reality is more of an oligarchic mesh constantly changing through internal competitions and political blackhattery. The signs of this deeper political narrative are there for us to see. Can't you see the public-facing instruments of the Hyperclass machine which has evolved to enslave us? Political nobility has not died, rather it has complexified to the point that the politically illerate cannot readily identify it for what it is.

People are loathe to accept their enslavement. They are unwilling to see it. They must confabulate their way to feeling free. It's also hard to understand how the pieces fit together. The machinations grow complex enough that few can appreciate the Golem (which has emerged from the political primordial soup) for what it really is. I worry we are reaching a political singularity where the proletariat will never see through the political event horizon to discover reality, where we are so thoroughly controlled to a point of eternal practical powerlessness (or, at least until the coming end of humankind). 

One must habitually take a fistful of redpills to generate the virtuous perception of political reality, to understand what is salient about our world in order to deduce what we are, what we've become, and where we are going. At best, we can only make out the blurry outlines. Unfortunately, the Realpolitik truth does not set you free. It only allows you to better recognize how unfree you really are. Let us hope that our knowledge creates opportunities to flourish and the foresight to avoid hardship.

<<footnotes "1" "It is ironic and farcical that Ayn Rand so firmly struck back at the world (I gotta' say, I think that psychopath was deeply angry) by so violently igniting the capitalist (a.k.a. Egoist) monetary policy we have through her disciple+pawn Alan Greenspan. It's one thing to have non-egoists regulate capitalism; it an entirely different monster to have egoists (the corruptible of corruptibles) regulating capitalism. That is to say: we have allowed the smartest+cleverest+hardest-working of the most psychopathic //homo sapiens// among us to devour us all. That is the farce. This is the irony: Libertarians are attacking the very thing they created. Libertarianism is fundamentally egoistic (it does not rely upon even Rawlsian principles [which is the minimum of justice; it is only a pragmatized version of the Categorical Imperative, an injection of who we are as psychopaths into the CI decision procedure of idealized Humanity]). Libertarianism is a thoroughly Randian Kantian injection into Locke. It puts Egoism on the philosophical map again like no one has since egoist, anti-realist, relativistic, non-cognitivist interpretations of [[SAP]] (Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato's) Virtue Theory (them are some ugly Neo-Aristotelians). As a historical conversation, Libertarianism may have started as a worthy enterprise, but it has gone down hill really fast. I believe Rand has successfully been injected into Kant injected into Locke for a large number of people on the planet. Libertarianism is quite the mental virus infection in humanity today.">>
