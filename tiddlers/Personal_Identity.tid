title: Personal Identity

Enumerating the kinds of signified referents for the signifier one's "personal identity" demonstrates that our natural language employs and points to a number of overlapping classical paradoxes in metaphysics.

* Speculative realist [[faith]] in knowing the thing-in-itself, including one's self.
* [[Infinigress]]es and problems of induction in modeling, including self-modeling.
* Essentialism
* Mereology
* [[Transworld Identity]] problematics
* Autonomy, Locus of Control, Freewill, Grey slate Self-construction, External Forces, [[Moral Luck]], and escaping the reduction of nature/nurture determinism.
* Selfhood defined by dialectics with [[The Other]]
* Mind/Body dualism and priority

If the self is a falsehood, then when an object is spoken of, what is that speech false in relation to? What is the truth-bearer? Is it non-sense, or is there a true image to uncover? Is identity a pure fiction? What object is not then a pure fiction?

Why is the cogito not a proof of at least some sort of identity? 

Note the difference between the proposition that X is an object and one's ability to justifiably come to believe in that proposition. Why should we accept the primacy of epistemology over ontology?
