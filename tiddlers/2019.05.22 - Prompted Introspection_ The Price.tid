title: 2019.05.22 - Prompted Introspection: The Price

!! Tell something you like about a friend from the past.

I appreciate how much latitude my past friends have given me for being quirky, tactless, opinionated, unable to see their point of view, and costly to interact with. It has been my experience that my friends drop off the map with me in the end. I'm so tunnel-visioned on being moral that it comes at great costs in happiness. It is incredibly rare to meet people who will pay that price. I am always indebted to people who pay the price for purpose.
