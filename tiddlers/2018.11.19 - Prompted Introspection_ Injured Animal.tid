title: 2018.11.19 - Prompted Introspection: Injured Animal

!! What would you do if you found an injured animal in the street?

Another one I've answered before.

Rofl. Yeah, this question is hard to answer. When Neo-Aristotelians speak of the non-cognitive anti-codificationism of their egoistically misguided internalism (and complete failure to understand [[The Telos]]), these are solid examples of why the virtuous agent is going to have a tough time explaining wisdom. Even if you are maximally articulate, the problem is a postmodern flood of information required to answer such a ridiculously large question. This is pragmatism of rule-utilitarianism, and this is the Neo-Kantian's move as well (though theirs runs the deepest because it is truly the most content-laden description of the possibility of prescription).

As usual, tell me the context, and I will try to give you my answer. Particularize my maxims, please.
