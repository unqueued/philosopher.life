I think that's exactly what [[antipleonasm]]ic [[diamond]]s and [[redpill]]s are like! They are crystallized into a kind of elegant simplicity which is highly efficient in terms of computational bit per unit of [[salience]]. Who doesn't love a glorious [[S2NR]]? Not all things can be simplified into what we normally call simple (and simplifying is itself a quagmire of [[gfwiwcgws]] considerations). 

Obviously, even if Draper the anti-hero turns out to be a complete piece of shit, he is truly competent in generating the viral maymays [[irwartfrr]], in a sense. That is to say, given his practice (which isn't a moral one), he is a virtuous agent. This is part of the virtuous perception. These are the fucking hacks. He plucks the few good ideas from the sea of flatness and develops them into hardened [[salience]] ready to launch into [[The Great Human Conversation]]. He is rhetorically (and thus, to some extent, dialectically) savvy.<<ref "c">>

Occam's Razor has some conceptual flaws, but it's such a powerful fucking rule-of-thumb that it extends from mathematics to advertisement, to alcoholism, and beyond. Computational efficiency ("free energy"<<<ref "l">>) in our empirics is dope.

<<footnotes "c" "Master manipulators are extremely rational except in their pursuit of [[The Moral Law]]. I warn you again: the question 'Why be moral?' is conceptually begging the question as hard as I do in taking morality to be the very definition of The Overriding All-Encompassing Reason. If [[The Moral Law]] is real, then that question is conceptually incoherent (even if we might initially think it has meaning as [[fff]] creatures).">>

<<footnotes "l" "I really don't like that phrase.">>
