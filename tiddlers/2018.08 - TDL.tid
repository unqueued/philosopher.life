!! Audit:

* I'm halting the monthly and weekly logs. It didn't seem to work. I'm not going to beat myself up about it. I hope to come back to it. Sometimes it takes me a couple tries to finally integrate it.
** Is this a mistake? Ugh. I have a bad feeling about it.
* I did accomplish quite a bit this month, and I failed to accomplish many other tasks.
* I totally failed to get my children into any groove at all. This month has been a waste on them almost entirely.
* m10 has been crystallized, except whatever the fuck happened to python
* My work on AA&UJ's letter and [[JASG]] turned out to be difficult. I'm glad I did.
* My TDL's have been fairly short, and they really don't plan out much.
* I can tell this month has been focused on [[FTO]] and jiggling life into place.
* A lot of filling in the corners. I think I have quite a bit of that left to do.
* I feel like I had 10,000 things I wanted to do, and I only got a few of them accomplished. I feel like I didn't have much control over what I did either. 
** Am I depressed? Is it ketamine time?
* We found another dish that I like, and interestingly, it's best cold: quinoa, chicken, and veggies!
* We've done a lot of reading and writing this month. I'm pleased with that.
