title: 2018.08.30 - Prompted Introspection: Boss

!! If you could tell your boss what you really want to do in your job, what would it be?

What boss? I'm lucky not to have this problem at the moment. I have had very few bosses that I respected as bosses and none that I found to be decent people. Bruce Brower was a good boss, but he was really handsoff. 

I can't say I'd know how to be a good boss, but that doesn't mean they have a right to be inhumane. Of my bosses, I want them to let me learn as much as possible and to be treated like a human. I don't want to be exploited.

Currently, I want to be my own boss. I'm too antisocial (i.e. I see through the bullshit of other human specimens in many cases) to be able to stomach having someone else as a boss. Yes, I'm aware of the truism that everyone has a boss: ultimately, mine is [[The Moral Law]] of [[The Unmoved Telos]]. I am telling that boss (which I dare not anthropomorphize) what I think; my life is the expression itself.
