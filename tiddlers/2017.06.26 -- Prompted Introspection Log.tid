!! What are you looking forward to the most?

I'm looking forward to being wrong about the world and myself in such a way that I am fulfilled, happy, and joyful. i.e. I'm most looking forward to being happy. Of course, the conditions for my happiness aren't simple, and I am not convinced I'm wrong. I'm looking forward to having better reasons for hope. I hope I get what I'm looking forward to.<<ref "1">>
