title: 2019.03.15 - Prompted Introspection: Inelastic Gas

!! How much was Gas the last time you filled up?

Yeah, I've answered this [[2017.12.22 - Prompted Introspection Log: Gas Price]]. Jesus. The only wealth we accumulated was intellectual, mental, social, and emotional. My children have grown leaps and bounds since then. We've worked really hard. We still live precariously. I cannot be superman; there are only so many things I can accomplish.

I still don't pay attention to gas prices. It's simply too inelastic and not a significant portion of our budget.
