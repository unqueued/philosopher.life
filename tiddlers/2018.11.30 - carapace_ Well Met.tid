@h0p3 First, thanks. I am deeply weird and to me it's a compliment. ;-) Second, OMG your website is a custom TiddlyWiki? It looks fascinating. Email sent. Well met.

Hey, this is "carapace" from HN. How's it going?

"The history of mankind for the last four centuries is rather like that of an imprisoned sleeper, stirring clumsily and uneasily while the prison that restrains and shelters him catches fire, not waking but incorporating the crackling and warmth of the fire with ancient and incongruous dreams, than like that of a man consciously awake to danger and opportunity." 

--H. P. Wells, "A Short History of the World"
