title: 2020.02.12 - GR6A: Finally, a reason to say: Hi!

Hello there, h0p3!

This is GR6A :) but, other than that pseudo-pseudonymisation, my real name really is Grigor (which is nicknamed as Гриша, and in my language for 6 we say "шшшшшест", so GR6A really is actually pronounced Grisha, ш=sh... anyhow...)...

I'm writing for many reasons: interesting wiki you have there... very hard to read, crashes all the time, don't know how you work on it, and am curious to know?... also wanted to look closer at your tag cloud (what it does, how you made it) but... it crashes on me... also very interesting to read it all, especially since I *can* relate (!!!) to both your style and, of course, your "themes"/ideas/ramblings/fractalisations - I enjoy them thoroughly, when I manage to read them..., but as I said, crashes aaaaall the time - maybe it IS a feature? which I haven't overcome yet :(

The immediate reason for this note, though, is that I'm looking for help, h0p3fu11y you'll take a look here:

And if you can offer me some h0p3 of getting this to work, I'll take it! (I have one response there, which is setting my on the right track, it looks like..., but did I say I waited for a good reason to write specifically to you...)

But, and quite seriously now, I came across your wiki looong time ago and was really just waiting for a chance to take you up on your offer to get in contact with random passersby/nomads/strangers, like me (although I'm not much into the "nomad" thin/k/g, like to be "settled", much rather):

Thanks man! (I'd bet you are a man, I'd be surprised a lot if you were a lady? And if you are indeed, then I'd apologise :)

P.S. The attachment is the picture from the poetry link above (just saying, in case you are paranoid to open stuff from "strangers" :) given you protonmail and such ;)

Oh, and if you do get back to me, and you'd prefer, I'd open a protonmail myself - always looking for *good* reasons to do stuff: as I mentioned, I waited years for a reason to write to you, for example...

Take good care! h0p3 you'll write back!
