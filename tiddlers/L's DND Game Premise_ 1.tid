--PURPOSE OF THIS... THING--

Hello hunters! Please use this document to create your fantastical characters within my (hopefully) reasonable limits. If you have any questions whatsoever, please do not 
hesitate to ask me! I want us all to have fun and enjoy playing this game together.


--STORY PREMISE--

You have been hired to work for a well-known hunting guild called the Defiance (oh so edgy!). The guild is housed in a once-great crossroads city called Orinmarr (pronounced 
oh-RIN-mar) in the country of Iberim (pronounced IH-bur-ihm). Notice I said once-great. Unfortunately, this city has been dwindling lately because of a recent increase in 
monster activity. That's where you come in! 

For one reason or another you have signed up to work for the Defiance and are now taking orders from your guild leader Brenna Faust. As far as you know, the guild receives
jobs from local leaders and occasionally even king himself. These jobs are usually to slay particularly nasty beasties that the king's army is largely unequipped to deal with,
but can also involve escorting particuarly important people if they have the gold for it. Yes, despite the edgy name, the guild does not exist to defy local hiearchy but
rather to defy the position man was born to in this world - that of easy prey. 

=Important Names=

HUNTING GUILD: The Defiance
GUILDMASTER: Brenna Faust
TOWN: O'rinmarr
NATION: Iberim


--CHARACTER CREATION GUIDELINES--

There are a few things I would like you to keep in mind as you pull absurd ideas from the depths of your brain:

	(1) Use D&D 5th Edition rules while generating your character. 

		If you don't know what those are, some good places to start are "https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex" or "https://www.dndbeyond.com/". 
		Or ask [h0p3] to...obtain you some copies of the core rules. *cough cough*

		You are very much allowed to use any supplemental material (i.e. Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Volo's Guide to Monsters, etc.) or homebrew material for your 
		character as long as the stats have been tweaked to fit 5e. I do have final say on the homebrew stuff though, nothing too OP. (I'm looking at you, min-maxers.)

	(2) Play what you want to play... within reason.

		I will work with anything you give me, provided you follow my guidelines. If you are unsure if your character will fit in for this specific context, 
		talk to me and we'll see what we can do!

		RULES

		> Create a level 2 character of any class/race. This one is easy.

		> Your character CAN be evil, but only if they can reasonably work with a party and complete their job. Please think about this seriously as I will not
			stop your party from killing you if you do something they really don't like. Just saying.

		> Quirks and special abilities are welcome unless I say otherwise. I know, I know, big bad bossy DM is raining on your parade and won't let you turn invisible
			whenever you want at despite the fact that you fell into a vat of magical disappearing ink as a child. Boo hoo.

		> Please limit the use of technology as it comes to your character, unless the premise can be tied to magic or high intelligence. For example, I will not
			allow technology-based robot characters in this world, but magical ones are alright provided there is a reasonable backstory behind them (i.e. you were
			created by a powerful wizard who set you free once he realized your sentience or something).
	
	(3) Generate a backstory for your character.

		Everyone has a story, and I REALLY want to know yours. Well, in this case your character's. It can be randomly generated, finely crafted from your own mind, 
		or stolen from someone on the internet. I don't care. However you come about it, please convey it in your character bio (template in the folder!). If you could
		do me a favor and leave a few things open-ended in your backstory I would really appreciate it. It means I can help integrate your character's background
		into the game which will make the world feel "more alive" so to speak.

		Your backstory should also end on your character working for the hunting guild mentioned above (the Defiance). Your motivations for doing so are entirely up
		to you, but please do me a favor and already have your character there when our story begins. Your character can work for the guild for as long or as short as
		you'd like (the guild has existed for hundreds of years, so no worries there.) Again, if you have a really cool idea that contradicts this at all, come to 
		me first and we'll duke it out.

		Keep in mind that your character's backstory should be somewhat realistic as you are starting out at level 2. Basically, this means your character is
		competent enough in their class to clearly be a step above the common folk but nothing too special yet. For example: your level 2 barbarian could not have
		killed Hurok the Horrible, the man who has slain an entire city in one sitting, because your character is not strong enough yet. You CAN however be seeking 
		your revenge on him as part of your backstory. That's excellent material.

		NOTE: I'm starting you at a low level to give you a chance to get used to your skills/spells/abilities. I know you want to be super stronk, but bear with me
		for a bit. I promise the growth is worth it.
