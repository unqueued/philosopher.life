title: 2019.02.08 - Wiki Audit: Lag

I've noticed the wiki is getting even laggier over https://philosopher.life/.<<ref "2020.02.09-1">> Even after I see something render, it takes a while for it to become functional. If it's just the sheer size, I'm fine with that (I guess). The new browser-saving mechanism may open up a window into fragmenting TW into more manageable parts that are lazy-loaded, but I still want to emit one thing (it is possible that something will be fixed...).

I need to learn how to profile this.<<ref "2020.02.09-2">>

I need to strip out all the tags and see if that's the problem. If it is, then I'm going to have to radically shift what I'm doing.

Perhaps I should ask on the forums.

[[Real-Time Embedded Wiki Signature]]s are almost live.

Gitpages seems to be struggling more.
