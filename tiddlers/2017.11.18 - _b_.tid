The fact is that society is a giant cluster of many orders, kinds, and degrees of societies. Many complex relationships emerge from these sets, all subject to the redpill as far as I can tell. Further, some people really just are outsiders. They don't fit in. There are bell curves and exceptions. I have a lot of evidence to suggest I am just different, that I don't fit in, and it isn't necessarily my fault. 

I have tried it your way, world. I think you're wrong on some important issues. I am definitely biased, fallible, and broken too, no doubt. I regularly fail to hold myself to the standards I hold you to (and before you think you don't, you do too). That I do not agree with you, that I do not value what you value, that I do not feel as you do, that I do not connect with you as you do others does mean that to some extent I do not empathize with you. And, you know what? Sometimes that's okay. That doesn't mean I've committed some grave sin in every case. Sometimes I have sufficiently empathized with you to the necessary extent and justifiably stopped. And, sometimes, that is the right thing to do.

It is clear that certain kinds, degrees, and instances of empathy are morally required, but not all, and not in all cases, and so on. 

Here is the problem with your groupthink Kantian reflective equilibrium: you cannot help but concede there must be some external metamodern "good" and "right" (external of your construction, lest you fall prey to postmodernism yet again), and while you might think to join the herd is the best route (and, often, for most people, it is), and while I agree that decentralizing power (even epistemic powers) is crucial, you must concede that there are obvious cases in which individuals can see the metamodern Good and Right better than the reflective equilibrium can...and they have a right to act on it. It seems like you have justice without morality. This is where they peel apart,<<ref "1">> even if only momentarily.

There is enormous friction and asymmetry. Being a "jerk," however, is not necessarily wrong, even on your own account. You can try and peel jerk apart of empathy, but you won't succeed, I fear. Jerkiness is an empathy problem, but not all empathy problems (including many instances of conceptually applied Jerkiness) are morally unacceptable. Do not confuse a lack of being a part of your set of tribes, thinking and feeling as you, or what being what you consider to be anti-social to definitionally be wrong. I grant you, your heuristics are often correct on this matter, but you are not conceptually correct. There are exceptions. 

This is a classic problematic for the Categorical Imperative; it really sucks at handling people and situations that are the exception to The Rule, including a Reflective Equilibrium as a distributed computational model of the CI. Your only retreat is a metamodern hope in particularism. But, again, you simply encounter similar contextualist epistemic problematics of the consequentialists.

My goal is not to feel bad anymore about having different answers than you do while still maximizing corrections to my fallibility. That is to say, I still must learn from you, but I need to stop being emotionally connected to your opinions outside of my truth-seeking and basic moral obligations.

I'm done trying to join your tribe, Humanity. I see I do not belong. I will learn to be a happy alien. I owe you that which aliens owe to aliens. I charitably extend the sufficient social/emotional capital with you necessary to engage in rationally measured tit-for-tat trust games with you, play the game, and then not worry about what is outside my control. I must stoically triage my relationship with humanity and stop rejecting myself.

Also, I've decided that: //__'' When I want to speak to myself really loudly and clearly in a random place on the wiki, I will bold, italicise, and underline the text. Make it scream to yourself.''__//

I'm convinced that when I'm high, I am gutturally open to myself. [[ehyeh]] is more likely to express himself in constructive ways.

I use tags for dialectics. Dialectics with myself in [[RPIN]] and [[KIN]], [[ehyeh]] and [[RPIN]], and dialectics with others [[JRE]], [[k0sh3k]], [[1uxb0x]], and [[j3d1h]].<<ref "B1">>

My goal with editing my past is to make moves I would have agreed with back then given what I know now? At the very least, what my past would have changed given only what he knows. I like the integrity of the narrative.<<ref "2018.12.20">>

That hits the nail on the head. I am addicted to having negative thoughts; they are incredibly useful to me in so many cases that I

My donors were shitty guides because they are also OCPD in many respects. They can only point out what is wrong. I'm the same way with my children. I have to stop that cycle.

[[R]] and I talked past each other about our definitions of Faith. I was talking about moral responsibility, about how doxa becomes praxis, about what faith in action looks like. She was talking about it more axiomatically, and it's why it is more personal in her view.

My wife and I talked about her //Round Table//, about vampires, psychopathy, empaths, and the odd relationships and humans in her life. We talked about my friendship list and asked ourselves: why were we friends? What did we get out of it? It was very useful.
