title: 2017.04.18 - Pipefitting Log

Today was yet another day we spent in the classroom. Ferguson was absent yesterday, and that meant that he had to do the math today (thus so did the rest of us). Otherwise, we probably would have done some socket welds. We basically reworked everything. This was fine though since it gave me a chance to practice. 

I feel like I have it down pat, although, I must say that this is a place to really check your math at least twice. A single error has a beautiful chain reaction. I hate to admit it, but it doesn't appear that trig is terribly useful unless you would be actually engineering something novel for pipefitters (but not //as// pipefitters).

My teacher asked me what I thought of it. I said I thought it seemed really useful because you could build whatever you wanted, with any angles. He corrected me and told me that good pipefitters keep it simple (KISS principle), using 90's at all times unless they must use 45's. Custom angles shouldn't be used whenever possible. It's obviously easy enough to mess up. However, he went on to say that he used this stuff all the time to make it work. 

For the moment, I believe I will use custom special offsets whenever I'm forced to, but also whenever I feel it will save me a ton of work. Perhaps I'll use it to make things pretty. Making these aesthetically pleasing is part of my job too (even my teacher agreed to this before). So, we shall see. KISS, except for the exceptions, amiright?<<ref "1">> The official drawings I saw were all fairly simple though. This is one of those things I won't be able to decide or clarify until I get into the field.

Ferguson and I talked quite a bit. He is a very charitable listener, and he seems to understand what I'm saying decently enough. He generally tries to parrot back inferences that follow from what I've said to see if he has it, and it's easy enough to correct it when he doesn't. He is, essentially, very teachable in my view. What is weird is that my teacher has a very hard time teaching Ferguson. I think it is a frame of mind problem though. When it comes to teaching Ferguson something he thinks he already knows, he kinda sucks at learning/listening. It is probably a blind spot in all of us, come to think of it. 

We talked about autism. I went through what it meant, etc.  His mother works with autistic children =). I told him I thought he was an aspie. He didn't seem too surprised by the possibility. We talked about myself and my son as well. 

I worked on the wiki in class. I was handed a copy of a scrap of paper that had takeout information for different size and strength flanges for welding (for 2 kinds of flanges). This is the kind of information that is easily lost. Having a permanent, digital record seemed prudent. 

I think I need to spend more time developing my [[Pipefitting Library]]. I am amazed at how few practical and academic resources about this field are available. It's kind of a joke. At the very least, I want practical cheatsheet resources. A pipefitting calculator would be nice. 

Tomorrow we move onto socket welds again. I think we should stay on it for a while. I do not feel virtuous of the practice, although I can definitely build whatever I need to build. I don't feel excellent at it.

According to the teacher, interview question #1, apparently: What is the 90 degrees TO or Radius for X" buttweld pipe? You need to instantly parrot back X(1.5) (well, evaluate the expression first). 

I think I annoyed my teacher by putting up the appropriate formulas on the board for the other students who kept asking me. I was tired of trying to explain it verbally, and I thought the visual would help. My teacher felt I was crossing the line, I believe. It is weird though since he constantly asks us to teach each other. I'm sure he is straddling a kind of laziness fence here but doesn't want to look bad. It's okay. I kept a good attitude and acted like it wasn't a big deal. I know it is intimidating to have the most educated person in the school to be sitting in his class as his student. I do my best not to make him feel uncomfortable about it (or anyone else for that matter).

I actually shot the shit with a lot of people. This is the second time a student has asked me to root their phone for them. I told him I felt uncomfortable doing it because I simply don't want to be responsible for bricking it. I was willing to give him resources on doing it himself. This time, the catalyst was about adblockers. I am so surprised people put up with that brainwashing. It's a short-term technical ignorance/convenience issue mixed with the risk of failure.

The teacher told us we don't have class on Monday (rather, he said we should do something "outside the school" and to "read between the lines."). Fine enough. I have shit to do anyway. 

Joanna from AB&T came into class. I signed paperwork saying I'd likely receive enough money to cover my toolbox and most of the tuition. Apparently, I will owe some money to the school (yuck, this is not what she said before). Yesterday she called my wife (saying that was the number she had for me, which can't be true since she has contacted me on my own phone multiple times). I had to fill out a FAFSA. Oddly enough, she seemed far less sure that funding would be guaranteed this time. That is disconcerting, to say the least. I hope it goes through. That said, I believe I can bevel and weld pipe, and with the math, build whatever I need to. I understand the theory of it just fine, and I've got the practical skill ingredients to do this. If I couldn't attend school for financial reasons, then I'd still be able to move on. 

Ferguson noted, after she was gone, that she is a scatterbrained lady. This is partially true. While intelligent, parts of her planning and executive reasoning are missing. I know the type. The kind of messy English professor thing, she's got a solid dash of it.

I talked to mom after work. It was a pleasant enough conversation. I often say very little (if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all). The conversations are obviously stilted and abrupt. I do my best, and I know she does hers. It is what it is. She generally elects to end the call by announcing that she is happy I called her, and that's that.
