I hate to admit it, but I think the prophesy standoff is dumb. I really want to like it. But, I think divination is retarded (and I am actually open to fatalism, philosophically). 

I am terribly immature and always will be. I want to know about magical sexual behaviors, attitudes, culture, etc. 

The Neville scenes are always tough; I can barely bear them. It's incredibly painful.

I think combat is deeply unperfected. It makes no sense.

I can't help it; I do love when Dumbledore duels.

The ability to empathize is a strength, as long as it is wielded for [[The Golden Rule]]. There is real pain in this book. It is the most visceral of them so far.

Snape reveals, yet again, his integrity.

I appreciate Dumbledore's desire to be honest.

Not a fan of the bloodpact.

Of course, I appreciate the worship of knowledge.

Rowling went way too corny at the end.
