How has your day been?
SAT 9:24 PM
Ah! I’m sorry I missed this! [[K]] and I were playing D&D yesterday and it got intense. We all cried.

So it was a good day hahaha. It’s been awhile since we played with this group. It was wonderful to see them all again. Between that and [[K]] really bringing the feels we were in deep. We played for seven hours with only one short break.

That is a very long day!

I'm glad you had a great time and saw your group again.

I‘ve felt like time is running like sand through my fingers lately too. It feels like my waves of apathy/lack of motivation have robbed me of a lot... but since I’ve really been making steps to get out of work my mental health has improved by leaps and bounds. It‘s sortof bittersweet though, because on the one hand I’m happy to start feeling better but I also know I’ve been bad about actually filling commitments/ doing the things I’ve said I will do.

Sifting for gems through the sands of time is often unpleasant. I'm sorry that it's so bittersweet. I'm not convinced one is ever completed by the process, but I hope you find what matters most.

It sounds like that game was cathartic.

It was! [[K]] did a great job. It helps that we’re all mushy people too.

I still owe you a book to be read and, once I get my shiz together, a campaign for you alls too.

I think you should put those on ice for now. You have a full plate. If and when you get to them, that is great. I don't think you should worry about not getting to them though.

Too late... >_>

I honestly think about them nearly every day, along with everything else I don’t do like I want to.

Taking my life back from this depressive episode has been one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.

And I feel bad that I haven’t been interacting with you, [[k0sh3k]], and the kids like I want to for a long time now.

We'll keep building.

Slowly but surely. I’m sorry if this is frustrating for you — I’m sure it is, and I really appreciate your patience with me.

Don't worry about it. Just keep grinding. Being in the pit sucks.
41 MIN AGO
That’s the problem with my pit — I always worry

I worry myself back into the pit. Hurraaaaaaayyyy... .—.
