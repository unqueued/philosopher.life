* Destroy in [[Magic]], then Victory Fucking Ur Mom...or a walk. 
** Also, we need a dank victory garden to grow bliss, salvia, and shrooms. 
* Seriously, dude, you need flonase. Get it.
* Your son chose [[Animal Consciousness]].
** Lawdy. Boy knows how to pick'em. I'm excited.
* Can we finish the Graham Priest interview? 
** Slow going. Not much time. So much to do. Still, would be nice. 
*** We have [[vidya]] time to burn too.
* Nightly Git problem? Let's find out.
* We should start building out our [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] [[Calendar]], eh?
* Ribs, asparagus, wedges, fruit.
* Push for [[Deep Reading]] proofs.
** And, son is falling behind on [[CDR]]s.
