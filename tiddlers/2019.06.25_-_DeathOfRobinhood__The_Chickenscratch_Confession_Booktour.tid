//May the Good of all that is Right and Beautiful be exalted. We are grateful The Light enables us to perceive the world. May our words and meditations satisfy the conditions of our purpose, and may the blueprints of The Kingdom of Ends motivate and form the pattern of our conversation.//

Dear Ivan,

I feel fortunate to hear from you again and again. It is my honor to engage in the sacrament of conversation with you, nomad. I've been jotting thoughts into this letter, mulling it around, growing it realistically over-the-top, fingerpainting and repainting it for months now.<<ref "su">> You asked me several questions which required my digestion, and you've been extraordinarily patient with me as I delusionally incubate and ferment my foaming rainbow word vomit which spews from this avatar with a dipshit homunculus for a pilot. I assume it must feel a bit like a giant pause in the [[hyperconversation]], and I'm sorry if it's ... awkward. I have felt the weight of this letter; it is among the heaviest I've written on this wiki.

I appreciate that you aren't worried about it being sophisticated or having me spend too much time in it. [[IA2DYJ]] and be content with my effort, to see moral merit in my interactions, and to maintain justified integrity (which is not to say I am succeeding or will).<<ref "iw">> I'm still figuring out what that consists in. I'm not used to writing letters all that much, but I'm hoping practice will [[ltf]] and make it one of my stronger social habits. So far, this letter has felt like time dilation in Eve Online. On top of living the life I have, communication has slowed down as there has been much to think about. 

<<<
Dear h0p3,

I've been looking forward to this reply and appreciate the thought you put into it. 
<<<

That warms my heart to hear, and I appreciate your reciprocation. Not everyone takes the time to write letters, especially not to random strangers or even a pain in the butt like me; I [[hope]] the practice spreads like wildfire. It is something missing in our virtual world. The cost of committing oneself to such a transforming task is among the highest I've encountered.

I'm grateful you indulge this ⦗👉 ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°⦘👈 feeble fool in dialectic. Whatever is left of trust, authenticity (whatever it means), genuineness, and sincerity during the pomo apocalypse in [[The Great Human Conversation]]: you are bringing it. Thank you for keepin' it real and kindly wandering the desert with an all-too-serious-clown trapped in what he delusionally hopes is creative non-fiction.<<ref "cf">> I could only [[hope]] to find more [[Humans]] like you. I've looked forward to hearing from you too, and I still do. 

<<<
I don't have any formatting preferences.
<<<

Your e-mail is well-formatted, and I don't think I [[do it justice|IA2DYJ]] here. This may need to be something I put more thought into.

I like the plaintext look too (I try to let the words and links do the talking), but I also want to do your voice justice (plus, it's fun). In case you ever change your mind, the offer stands. I will make whatever reasonable accommodations I can.<<ref "ac">>

<<<
> One thing stands out to me: you are an artist. I am still not sure why I tend to connect with artists (usually my personality is considered deplorable among the artists I've known offline), but that is one of the few threads you have in common with the others I have the opportunity to speak with in depth.

That's funny - you're definitely an artist yourself.
<<<

Well, thank you. I hope to be a useful, impactful, and talented artist like yourself.<<ref "n">> Assuming I live long enough, maybe in a few decades, this pile of mine will be worth thinking about more generally. Sometimes I think of my delusional ravings and artful narcissistic avatar as a spiritual trufe bomb or a dialectical ball of lightning I'm hurling at the world (not that I predict almost anyone would listen). Of course, I'm probably just a retarded prejudiced keyboard-warrior arrogantly trying to take over the world.<<ref "p">> XD. Yeah, I've got a ways to go, lol.

<<<
 Maybe what your installation does is filter out the elements of your personality that some artist-types find abrasive? What kind of people besides your family and friends do you tend to get along with out there? 
<<<

This term "installation" is wonderful. It reminds me of my [[RGM]], our computing practices in the house, the ways in which my family's wikis have transformed us together, and how this horcrux-pensieve has been such a moving artifact in everything I do and all the relationships I have (which is hardly to say I've done it well). It's an installation alright, perhaps an invasive one: sometimes a black dropbox with a polymorphic payload. However, I don't think it does much filtering of my abrasiveness so much as it gives more context to it. When I'm openly engaged (you need to know me pretty well offline) and not holding back, this is what I sound like in person too. It is rare that I get to say what I actually think without what I usually deem unjustified reservation requirements. Who would want to hear that? Lol.

I do my best to accurately represent myself in this wiki. The artists on the wiki seem to handle my abrasiveness and extreme disagreeableness well enough; it probably requires a high-tolerance to differences in some sense. I have found some people tend to drop off fairly quickly with me, understandably: I have the tact and finesse of a dripping asshole,<<ref "cu">> I'm painfully absurd, I seek precision and possibility where others find it impractical or lacking (what they refer to as) grace, and I'm what most people consider overly concerned with moral accountability down to the detailed threads of the fabric of our lives.<<ref "lo">> Out of the gate, I assume people do not find me worth their time and energy (or worse), and you and [[others]] restore my waning faith in [[hope]] for [[Humanity]]. Sometimes I'm just a mean old perfectionist gom jabbar;<<ref "gj">> you continue to demonstrate you are the rare credit to our species. 

I try to radically invest myself in the people who interact with me. How else should I spend my life? Unless I'm [[smalltalk]]ing, joking, informing, or learning (and not usually even then): I tend to be overbearing, insolent, judgmental, and demanding in dialectics. There are arenas in which I give abnormally little space,<<ref "is">> and I make you walk me through every single step. I'm paranoic in how I aim to detect [[sociopaths|Game Theory: Agents]].<<ref "oc">> I'm like a masked bloated fascist hyperlegalistic hairsplitting vigilante sovereign citizen<<ref "sv">> freespeech domestic terrorist cringeworthily testing people for [[The Golden Rule]]. [[Privacy]] is a difficult right to exercise with me; I don't think most people deserve it in most cases. I'm a challenging person to deal with because I demand everyone tell the truth as best they understand it; I am on a mission. I aim to show what P2P friendship, integrity with enemies, and epistemic humility look like (which, again, is hardly to say I'm successful in these practices). We live in a low-trust society where I predict the majority of my interactions with humans to be failures at some level which require me to be on guard. It's hard to be realistically hopeful without being naive; some [[dok]] of happiness are the result of holding particular delusions in one's context.

Indeed, my respect for identities, including emergent branches of possible versions of my identity(s) at any given timeslice in my [[4DID]], comes in a wide range.<<ref "rn">> There are many places where I do not respect the beliefs, feelings, and desires of others (including other versions of who I have been or could be) which they find unbearable (though I aim to be painstakingly justified). Horrifying to many progressive neo-Kantians, I make the distinction between one's constant 'moral worth as a person' and one's variable 'worth as a moral person.' I take people to task for who they are and how they represent themselves. I see accountability where others do not because I see radical freedom in our identities which most aim to ignore (it is why I like you so very much; this is no mere game<<ref "ct">>). I think Hanlon's Razor is the [[psychopathic gaslighting|Memetic Warfare]] variant of my axiom: [[Virtue is Knowledge]]. I'm the asshole who will openly express the [[dok]] to which you are evil to the best of my accountable, transparent knowledge (with my skin in the game from the beginning). As an elite elitist debate-me-dickhead (who argues with himself in the shower like an anxiety-god), I self-righteously hold most adult humans I meet in quiet contempt, and I'm told I eat people alive. I agree that psychological egoism is a fitting description of most humans I meet, but it is never the prescription: we are free to be [[good]] persons.<<ref "gp">> Lifelong friendships of mine require developing immunities to being allergic to me (my bark is my bite) and a paranoic openness to being wrong all the way down; I vulnerably bend over backward to put my own mutable perspective on the line in [[T42T]].

I'm not convinced the wiki is a significant filtering mechanism on myself exactly (though it gives me a chance to prepare my expression and digest) but rather a distance or space in which we can all reason asynchronously, often embroiled in multiple simultaneous conversations with my premoves and hopefully some memetic scaffolding set in advance for a rapid mindmeld.<<ref "cl">> As usual, there is too much emergence in [[hyperconversation]]s for me to easily give a clean account (though I aim to do so in time); it is easier to show than to tell yourself, especially with two or more hyperobjects of discourse.<<ref "tel">> Of course, it has other properties; for example, I have a chance to transparently wrestle with a number of sociopaths on this wiki which I'd otherwise not be in a position to do offline. Further, the length, density, and intensity of the conversations I can have over the wiki can require quite a bit of emotional and cognitive energy, prices difficult for all parties to pay realtime. Maybe that is the point, though, and I will continue to think about how this medium is or shapes the message. I also like that the wiki gives me a chance to communicate my unkosher milk+meat (simultaneously rather than one before the other) insanity without unfairly putting someone on the spot to some [[dok]]. I can't communicate my point of view in person to most people very easily unless they have traveled similar paths in the desert or have practiced speaking with me significantly. My offspring and my wife decode my compressed idiosyncratic abstractions fluently (a sentence goes a very long way with us); the wiki gives someone a chance to engage in that practice, imho.<<ref "ds">> Letter-drafting, even with our radical information asymmetry, likely saves us both time in the end, as iterations give me a chance to unpack my suitcases and connect dots that would normally take longer for me to recognize need connecting in the conversation, and the wiki aids in making it otherwise high-bandwidth and crawlable (if any, I don't know which links or searches are going to be useful for you).

So, to your question: I generally don't get along with people unless I am not openly myself, or I've identified that my interlocutor is not capable of understanding what I have to say,<<ref "dl">> or my interlocutors ever so politely ignore who I am. As you no doubt can tell, I'm a deeply flawed, paranoid, and fucked up person. You'll find most will not speak with me beyond [[smalltalk]] (though I think most people primarily engage in smalltalk). It takes an extensive attention span, focus, and perseverance to build a relationship with a 4eak like me. It is rare that someone doesn't eventually experience bad vibes from me or find me horrifying (and even rarer that people maintain a relationship despite those feelings); this becomes more complex in discourse in which I challenge others, sometimes by forcing others to look in the mirror by drawing up illustrations for them, mimicking semblances of themselves back,<<ref "ti">> or more often by argumentatively flipping the switch at every turn toward a reductio (generally with material leftover to help us build something else). Some change their minds about me later, but most don't. Being justifiably useful to others is one of the primary goals of [[FTO]], and that often conflicts with maintaining what is standardly conceived of as a friendship. Please feel free to exercise [[The Ol' Yeller Clause]] with me if I'm too rabid.

Perhaps jarringly, I am willing to openly burn bridges where others wouldn't, but that's part of what makes crossing them so meaningful. My paranoically charitable hyperreligious perspective and seemingly imperious assertions of what I take to be my moral rights and obligations in my context combined with my unpredicted sticky, rabbitholing, and looping viscosity in both verbal and hypergraphic conversations (some of my conversations take decades) make it appear like I'm a devious ambusher, epic grudge-holder, appalling rhetorician, dogmatic fascist, and sadistic interlocutor. Part of my vocation as a philosopher is to sincerely, surgically, and kindly engage in morally justified ad hominem. Who wants that? Everyone should. Even as a madman, [[IA2DYJ]]. Pursuits of truth and honest existential wrestling are gorgeous exceptions I encounter with [[others]]. Especially in virtue of being what most people call insane, clearly, I'm lucky to have some absurd people who speak with me consistently and long-term; they likely hedged-[[love]] me far more than I deserve.

I don't feel like I'm an effective guide, but I try to be useful to people I interact with; I'm trying to meet them where they are. I make for a reasonable study and sparring partner, especially if you seek a deconstructor to throw protons or more complex functions at the layered images we grow together as we shed light upon [[The Other]] via a lossy interactive process of discovery and mediation. I can be thorough and rabbithole with a [[Straussian]] mindset, which can make me a useful sounding board. Metagamers and I get along well enough. Some people like to geek out with me. I've been trying and failing to set aside mere games for the only one which matters (a recursive problem complicated by the fact that playing mere games is part of playing the one that matters).<<ref "mg">> In a way, I think openly sharing the wiki allows me to filter people. It reminds me of OkCupid hackers who fight to balance the odds men face in finding partners in sexual mating markets.<<ref "rm">> Giving my self-model away freely accomplishes many goals, including changing the odds of finding meaningful relationships and hopefully being useful to others.

As I get older, I think I'm becoming increasingly intimate and alienating (however paradoxical that may sound). My text and meaning are more black-and-white (with some links and functions, I guess).<<ref "dv">> Even while I am less confident and certain in many areas, there is less and less middleground with me. I get along with the [[power]]less who are doing their best with what they have (those are the people I'm fighting for) and others engaged in the same activity. With these people, I try to listen in silence or ask leading questions. When I do speak, it is to build a bridge in their reasoning by handing them the best steelmanned expressions of their argument I see while pointing out the gaps (and, usually, I think the gaps are tremendous). My children and these people (almost all of whom I will never meet) are the only reason I have left to live on this planet. I await the day that I can be done with my work.

I know it isn't pleasurable to hear it; maybe you'll think I'm evil, radically wrong, or insane for it: I'm convinced I should like about 3% of the humans I get to know. I do my best to [[love]] everyone and their Reason even when I hate their guts (to varying [[dok]], of course).<<ref "ta">> [[ridtyawtr]]. I see the light of possibility in almost everyone, and it is why I hold us so very accountable for not being who we ought to the best of my knowledge and abilities. 

<<<
What are some other threads you find I have in common with the others, or did you mean to imply I was otherwise very different?
<<<

Sorry if I wasn't clear: I meant to imply you are otherwise fairly different, from what I can see (I'm fairly blind). It appears the Judeo-Christian memeplex is part of many of the people I speak with, but you come with a forceful set of tentpegs. You speak words I have once uttered myself, and I am still bound to them. Hopefully, in time, I will be able to show you my family [[tattoo|Δουλος του Θεου]].<<ref "tat">>

Perhaps one of the other things you have in common is that you like to read, and you have the ludicrous patience to speak with the mentally deranged (and paranoic pricks like me who take themselves far too seriously). 

At least up front, you are one of the most dogmatic interlocutors I've had so far (this is not conceptually a negative trait to me, despite the shades of meaning it may have with most people; and, further, I'm not saying you are unjustified in at least some of your dogmatism), and you put your faith on the line. You've got all the direct and subtle marks. Your chosenness [[naked]]ly bleeds out of you. I don't have to question whether you put your money where your mouth is, and I know you would die and spend your life for the truth in some of the books on your shelves. I'm lucky to meet you: a man whose [[faith]] I can respect in some of the most difficult contexts I've encountered. Of my interlocutors, I likely have the most memetic material in common with you. Anyone who can point to [[The Good]], as I've written it and say, "eh, that's not so bad," is already much closer to the thing I'm pointing at with this wiki than most. We both aim to build our lives with Jesus' words (though we may have strong differences of opinion on how to interpret those words). While I have only seen snippets of you, I already see Christ in you. Homie, you are in the trenches (and not just in your kindness to a lunatic like me). I'm honored to meet you.

<<<
> Initially, I meant "DeathOfRobinhood." I want to know why you are connected to it and what it means to you.

I came across some art by NC Wyeth while researching children's book illustrators, and impulsively bought reproductions of two of his works online. One of those works was 'The Passing of Robin Hood'. I couldn't articulate what drew me to that painting initially, but having spent more time with it, I sort of feel it signals both my aspiration and my narcissism. I...could say I wish to be some kind of Robin Hood figure...but his legendary aspect is so beyond me, I might instead have identified with him as a sort of tragic martyr (seemed more accessible at the time, which, in hindsight, is pretty disrespectful to actual martyrs). Since acknowledging how I childishly upholstered a heroic self-image via the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods, I held onto the identification because I think it maybe kinda has in it the kernel of a sincere yearning for the Good, however crassly expressed.
<<<

Your story makes your name meaningful to me as well. This paragraph inspired me to be as forthcoming as I can about why you should not like me in this letter. Reciprocal revelation is necessary to mutual witness. I [[hope]] to have the honesty and sincere self-reflection you have here. It is a special thing to dialectically name ourselves in virtue of our opposites, mistakes, or faults. I see far more sincere humility than mere irony in your self-identified image.

Aesthetics and appearance are not simple topics in philosophy and religion. I imagine images must take on a special meaning for you. You are likely more equipped and attuned for this practice than I could ever hope to be.

<<<
//related aside: Two nights ago I had a dream where I was some kind of cartoon superhero, along with my girlfriend, doing battle with evil, fighting upon rooftops, and then among the stars. After the laser show, we realized we had mastered the elements and were summoned before a suit behind a desk. He informed us that we were ready to advance to the next plane where our mastery of the elemental building blocks of reality will form the foundation for a new sort of relationship with Creation. Someone suggested that we'd be under the management of an angel named "*****", but the suit corrected us saying we would see God directly. At this point, the tone of the dream changed entirely. I found myself alone with a huge sense of longing growing in my chest beyond all proportion. Tears stung my eyes as I started thinking "I just want to see God. That's all I really want.". Eventually the crying woke me up, but I continued to lie there dazed crying continuously before fully rousing myself.//
<<<

That is a helluva dream! I cannot remember mine so clearly at all; they dissipate so quickly, and I'm convinced my mind's eye doesn't have nearly as much richness to it as that. 

You are not the first to share their dreams and waking up from them with me. I am lucky to hear these stories. I have no idea what to make of it, especially because I'm not convinced we are ourselves in our dreams (perhaps excepting lucid dreaming, but I can't commit to that either). I do not know what they mean (if anything), but I'm convinced they tell us something about the structure of [[phenomenology]] itself and perhaps one's health. So, please take what I have to say as an interpretation of a fictional story about someone else because I don't know any better.

I am reminded of [[Awe]], and I appreciate the goal-directedness of the character. I sometimes feel like someone peeling away layers of reality, much like Bill in //West World//, seeking the meaning of the maze, hunting in the desert for what matters most, thirsting for purpose. I can never be certain, but leaps of faith assume such certainty in their contexts (hence the tentpegs). It has been extremely painful to see that what I once thought was a spiritual experience was not. I feel the yearning of your character. 

Of course, I would like to know more about what you make of it and dreaming more generally.

<<<
Also, thank you for sharing something about your own irl name :)

There's something sincerely aspirational about the name 'h0p3', though saved from over-sentimentality by a good measure of leet, that feels like it wouldn't be out of place in some updated, ironic-but-not-really take on //Pilgrim's Progress//.
<<<

This line has sat with me for almost a month as well. That is quite a comparison. You are beyond charitable to me, and I can only hope to live up to even a sliver of anything like that. I appreciate how you peel apart my irreverence from my reverence so cleanly.

You come to the table with a mixture of charity and sincerity. I'm going to listen carefully to what you have to say about the concepts. I suppose it's sometimes one of those "I know it when I see" kinds of problems to some non-trivial [[dok]]. It may play a significant role in our discussion of codificationism. 

<<<
> Your father sounds like a man of honor, presumably doing what he could with what he had. I hope to do the same with my own children.

My father was a wanderer who settled down later in life. He was personally disciplined, though relationally easy-going, and he cultivated my interests. He also showed me how to suffer the indignities of loss and decline with humility and resilience. Whatever your challenges, I think kids retain what you did with your bad as much as your good.
<<<

You appear to have the virtuous disorganization and diffuse mode of artists I've met, but clearly you are disciplined in your faith. I suggest you are relationally easy-going as well. I do not know what you have suffered and lost,<<ref "sl">> but I appreciate that your father prepared you for the hardest parts of life. There is a defensive risk-assessment which I admire about that strategy. If I am lucky, I will succeed in teaching my own children to have that disposition, wherewithal, and skill.

It's possible you have more faith in homo sapiens than I do. At least from what I can recall about the nature of human memory, retention and recall aren't shaped by such an objective and fair pursuit of the truth. I am not convinced most children grow into adults who are actually all that thoughtful about these contexts. You cannot deny it, DeathOfRobinhood, you are a statistical deviant; that may show up in your clearer self-reflection upon your childhood as well. I have wrestled a great deal with it myself. 

I'm trying to [[Be A Good Dad]]. It's not easy when you are going insane (history is littered with people who go crazy looking at the thing I'm looking at). To various [[dok]], we are each unreliable narrators. My offspring write wikis as well, http://j3d1h.philosopher.life/ and http://1uxb0x.philosopher.life/. I hope to give them the best tools for remembering, analyzing, and synthesizing the narratives of their childhood with as much respect for their autonomy and [[4DID]] as I can possibly muster. It is my goal to have the tools and methods to construct long-term, high-bandwidth, remote relationships in which we can fairly represent the historiographic evolution of how we tell the stories of our lives together. One of your father's attributes that I hope to habituate in my character is the ability and disposition to be easy-going; I'm awful at that except with people ridiculously close to me (as in: am I going to try to hug you the first and last moments I'm going to see you in a day?), though I'm still bad at it with them too.

<<<
I was being unfair to suggest the writers I meet hate cartoons. The condescending attitude to the material //some// of them hold as they cynically use the gig as a stepping-stone to more prestigious opportunities certainly seems like hate to someone who loves this stuff as much as I do.
<<<

I will be interested to understand your normative interpretation of the concept of cynicism, including how it departs from skepticism. Are you lucky enough to work with any others who love and take their vocations as seriously as you do? I assume it requires a kind of obsession to be as skilled as you are, and, given the competition (much like pro gamers must overcome such a high hurdle because many people enjoy the practice just for fun), I assume you have to be pretty elite to get anywhere in your industry.

<<<
I'd like to think that, as an animator, I'm fairly competent/principled (I'd like to be a virtuoso by my mid-50s), but as a story crafter...I'm still disappointingly amateur. I got gags and novel ideas, and I think a decent grasp of credible human psychology, but my structure is soft and my pacing undisciplined.
<<<

I'd like to know more about the work you do. I don't really know what it means to be a virtuous animator. Has technological advancement started to slow down enough that you don't have too much turnover in your tooling?

Do you intend to move toward writing the stories and perhaps doing it all (or as much as one could; I assume the business end of things is its own maze)?

<<<
I also don't want to give the impression I'm working in an environment that does not regularly require me to compromise (artistically), but in some ways, this too is good as the dialectic spurs me to growth and to a healthy skepticism about the brilliance of my own ideas.
<<<

What artistic compromises have you made in the end, and do you have any you look back on and wish you did otherwise? Conversely, what are you most proud of in your vocation? I know precious little about your process. I don't think I have what it takes to stand in your shoes.

Epistemic humility is a hard problem, and perhaps the root of all problems which are up to us. It's crucial that we have people we trust to help prune and shape the brilliance or self-perceived brilliance of our ideas. I rely on my [[advisers|Offline Users]] to help me compromise (you can tell I'm beyond awful at it), though perhaps not effectively enough (and that also has its own [[infinigress]]es). 

<<<
Can you unfold your question as to the commodification of my voice a bit? I already choose to not take gigs that sell cereal to kids or whatever, but are you asking how my talent has not been used by anyone to assert their own thesis anytime ever? because I'm not sure that's been the case. 
<<<

I agree it is unlikely that your talent hasn't been used by anyone to assert their own thesis. This must be a hard problem for you. It is for me, and I'll probably never be a tenth of the artist you are.

I adore how you ask me to clarify myself multiple times; that is important to me. Alright, I'll unfold it. I was asking: "Do you know why that commodification is evil?". Like a bridgetroll, I was asking you to transparently pronounce שִׁבֹּלֶת.<<ref "f">> I'm curious about your faithful tongue. Those who know [[The Good]] (and hence [[The Right]]) can generally point out the dialectical edges of what it is not, but I am not worried on this front. You have demonstrated you actually give a shit again and again.

You are correct, btw, there is a profound asymmetry in how we get to know each other. As we all do, I have to blindly guess, tease out, and infer. As you can see, I'm often wrong, but it's also something I'm doing with a non-trivial information asymmetry handicap. I am paranoid, prejudiced, and inaccurate as ever, surely. I hope in time, you will learn to trust and forgive me for what may be significant errors. Of course, everyone can appear humble (it is an image we show ourselves even when we sin), and I regularly see figurative snakes of varying [[dok]] in most humans; unfortunately, my suspicions are often confirmed. Though I do my best, it's difficult to give the benefit of the doubt in a desert where the vast majority do not merit it. Your responses, however, have convinced me you aren't a snake. I take my 3% figure (though there are likely communities which break that rule),<<ref "mc">> for adults, seriously, and you demonstrate integrity I so rarely encounter in the world. One question I ask myself: would the world be better off, more coherent, and significantly closer to the Kingdom if this person in question were billions rather than one? It's my honor to meet you, sir.

<<<
Locating this cartoon is sitting in my backlog of low-priority side-quests, but I wouldn't be surprise if its eventual discovery is synchronous with some symbolically significant and cathartic life-epiphany.
<<<

I'm moved by nostalgia, but this is so much more than that. I can't imagine what finding that symbol would be like today. I don't think I have any parallel left in my life. I'm weary of such moves because I think they are opportunities for eisegesis; it gets me in trouble especially with those who build their faiths too vulnerably around standard icons or common coincidence.

<<<
May I ask if you have any good material to recommend on autism and the perceived lack of emotional connection associated with it?
<<<

Of course, you can. I'm not an expert in psychology, including autism. Autism is still being explored and defined significantly. My recommendation must be taken with a huge grain of salt. I am convinced there is a great deal more to discover about the nature of the autism spectrum(s). My philosophical study of autism is like a side-quest. I'm happy to field questions as best I can. Some people find me too high-functioning to merit the label (I work hard to blend and codeswitch),<<ref "pa">> but I don't think it is conceptually a disability in all contexts. From what I can tell, you have non-trivial opinions or hunches about my own psychological status, and I appreciate your willingness to explore it with me.

Moral psychology is an area of interest for me because it has strong implications for metaethics and practical wisdom. It's helped me come to better grips with who I am and who we are.

My earliest memory of a drawing I'd made was some kind of flower-headed box that I called a lion. I loved drawing comics and started at maybe five? A lot of it was derivative, either knock offs of what I saw on TV or in other comics. I started making flipbook animations at nine-ish after I took a book out from the library, 'Chuck Amuck', by Chuck Jones, and would study the little Roadrunner antics at the margins of the pages endlessly. I started off with simple two-frame before and after loops, then started making increasingly sophisticated cartoons in whatever notepads/textbooks/dictionaries I could get my hands on. A couple years later I discovered Jasc Animation Software which lead to my first foray into digital cartoon-making.
<<<

I like how cleanly and far back this narrative goes for you. That is such an existential gift. My memories fade and fragment, but yours stick together into an elegant sequence. I only ever watched animations, and you were actually making them from such a young age. It beautifully screams purpose. Have you been able to keep any of the work you made back when you were so young?<<ref "tl">>

How much of your process is done analog these days? Do you sketch on paper for prototyping before moving to the digital workstation? I would like to understand your workflow and how you reason about your job. 

<<<
How about you? Were there any precursors to this wiki? Primitive ancestors? Or was it created ex nihilo?
<<<

Yes. I'm held hostage by my terrible ideas. There are writings I've had here and there through my life, but one strongly stands out to me: I call it the H-book, a pile of filth even worse than this wiki. I started to write it as I lost my faith while in graduate school. 6 years of graduate school in philosophy was a tall task for PK/MK and ex-missionary, and there were some classes I knew would test me for everything I was worth. I was not wrong about that. One of my problems as an autist is the amount of variance in my ability to identify emergence, and this is especially problematic for self-identifying and empathizing with my [[4DID]] (this is a source of my lack of executive functioning, on top of which my actual sinfulness stands so boldly). I have had to hunt for effective means to self-medicate, and the "H" in H-book stands for "Highdeas." 

Only one section of the book was devoted to writing while sober; sober me would speak with high me as well. Always on the Road to Damascus, the beginnings of [[h0p3]] began in that timeframe as well. This precursor includes pseudonymous correspondence with family and friends, journaling, and a scrapbook in it. As usual, I have little of value to say in it. One cool thing I still appreciate about it: I wrote and edited in a different color each time, and kept a key. It's rainbow inside (I like rainbows and bright colors, they stand out nicely for my colorblindness).

Grafting all my old writing into the wiki is in the ol' [[Wiki: TDL]]. Capturing the draft of the book inside the wiki is going to take some work.

Aside rabbithole: not even nothing was created ex nihilo. Nothingness comes from something. I'm an eternalist and essentialist (annoyingly so). I'm a mortal enemy of [[Meaningness]] (though it is beautifully written). Many of the people who seem to find my wiki interesting are fans of that particular family of sites. I'd like to know your take on it as well. 

<<<
As far as animation I hold in high regard today, a lot of it is the sort of stuff you'd expect, and there's seriously too much to make an exhaustive list. A lot of the generally highly appraised stuff, I raise my horn to (I like that you appreciate The Last Unicorn :)).
<<<

//The Last Unicorn// is special to my wife and me. Plus, it's not some Disney tale with vegetables. While I love animation, I probably only know the usual mainstream stuff you'd expect. I often have no idea how people make animations. It's like magic and hacks to me. 

I'm redundant on the topic. Some autists are especially prone to watching and re-watching animations. Despite how many people in my life were convinced animations would rot my brain, I would not be here without animation. I'm repetitive about it, but I'm grateful that they help me suspend my disbelief, engage in theory of mind construction practices, offer dojos for training my analytical world-building and affective gut world comparison, and have excellent footholds for memory built into them. Children and fanbois like me are especially lucky to have you in the world. I think more highly of animation than I know how to express off-the-cuff, and I hope to reason more carefully about the morality of animation, rhetoric, storytelling, and communications with you.

<<<
A short list of animated things I've followed the last few years accompanied by cereal (which means I'm really indulging myself) include Gravity Falls, The Amazing World of Gumball, Rick and Morty, and Bojack Horseman. I'm not sure the things I enjoy neccesarily correspond to the things I respect or aspire to, but the eyeballs don't lie.
<<<

Lol: the eyeballs don't lie. I've never heard that succinct phrase before. I have such strong feelings about that claim. Mmmm. Thank you for it; it's delicious. I also want to binge cereal and cartoons all day. I like talking about cartoons with my offspring and my public children. This was one of those things with which I connected with the kids in Thailand on too (rice not cereal though). Indulgence, yes, and there's something beautiful and even pure about it in the right doses (which is not to say I elect to have any self-control here, as you can see).

<<<
I'm a big fan of Japanese stuff from more than a couple of decades ago: Rémi sans famille, Gamba no Bouken, Gutsy Frog (the former two directed by genius and hero Osamu Dezaki) as well as occasional contemporary oddball picks like Ping Pong directed by Masaaki Yuasa. Indie directors like Michael Dudok de Wit and Torril Kove, I like to follow. I am continually enchanted by Suzie Templeton's 'Peter and the Wolf'. You ever watch Cybersix?
<<<

I've never heard or seen any of these until you told me about them. Lol! You will need to assume that I know almost nothing. Thanks for pointing out animations to think about; I am in your debt. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to repay your kindness here. Also, I cannot say I see the common threads in these (which is exciting), but I have not studied them. 

For an untrained eye like mine, dat Ping Pong series is the standout toon here. It's screamin' off the screen. It doesn't even need words to tell a surprising percentage of the story. It reminds me of some weirdcore my daughter likes, too. It's interesting to me when what appear to be flaws or mistakes end up being part of the charm. I'm amazed at the art of adapting the unintentional into the intentional. Plus, I adore literal ping pong - it's gorgeous and a simple-looking dialectic. It's one of my favorite games to play. (I've spent far too much time on it; I really like spinning objects and liquid).

<<<
In the world of art at large, I am not a man of great breadth, but if there is anything your daughter would like to discuss, I'd be happy to engage. A Twitter feed she might enjoy is: https://twitter.com/_ibcf_?lang=en (I certainly do!)
<<<

Thank you! I'm a lost father (as usual). We work to get her books, supplies, and machines, and to talk with her about art. (Even though I'm trying to be some kind of artist, I have no idea what I'm doing on that front). I'm an intense father, but I desperately do not want this part of her life to be something I shape beyond simple support and interest.<<ref "it">> Given the opportunity costs, [[Music]] was a giant waste of my life, but I don't think her art is a waste of her life. 

I'm an amateur with [[computers|monster]], and I'm a foolish (mostly useless) fanatic with them. One of the reasons I've not too strongly pursued working with computers for a living is that almost all the people I know who work with them for a living end up not wanting to use them outside of work. That is absolute madness to me. I can survive without my computer, but I could not imagine having this techne fade or ripped from my identity. Perhaps hypocritically, I force my children to rapidly learn and construct with this tool.<<ref "tt">> I pick my battles with my offspring. I cannot, however, tigerdad my daughter with [[her art|http://j3d1h.philosopher.life/#Gallery]]. I'm deadset against the possibility of snuffing out this flame and flair for art, and I may not touch it. I can only observe and cherish it with her. I may not metagame more than is necessary for us to be minimally practical. 

Assuming all moral constraints are satisfied, I want her to adore it because she adores it, wherever that goes. 

<<<
I found //When Helping Hurts// useful, but I have difficulty identifying interesting points of discussion that don't relate to specific applications of its recommended best practices. The best practices advised are certainly very good (avoiding paternalism, identifying the assets a target person or group already has, locating the person/group on the timeline of need), but I'm not sure what a discussion would be like (I've also never been much a of a Bible study guy, heh).
<<<

That makes sense to me. Despite practice, I can't say I'm much of a Bible study guy either, but I've not found many settings where greater than 2 or 3 are gathered which remained meaningful to me outside of a standard classroom or entertainment. I'm a peer-to-peer kind of guy in the end. Video games are like that for me, too. I much prefer meshes of small numbers, as I spend large amounts of emotional energy to deal with large crowds.<<ref "x">>

<<<
I'm about to pick up //Friendship at the Margins// as recommended by Craig Greenfield, a servant whom I admire, and I sense it may have more of the narrative and theoretical accents that make for a more natural point of conversation. I could very much be wrong, and if your research on WHH leads to determine it's a book you'd like to read, I'd certainly be open to having that discussion.
<<<

I am going to wait in part because I've been flooded of late, and I'm not able to commit. I've been failing on the reading front. That is a topic I'm interested in, though! I also prefer to wait for you to recommend the book first, especially because it is going to be an emotional rollercoaster for me no matter how we slice it. I am rough with [[authors|JASG]] and [[speakers|2018.10.19 - Jop: Continuing]] admired by many of the Christians who are close to me, and that may not be something you want either.

//The Lost World of Genesis One// was good fun. What is your wife reading these days? Right now I'm just about half way through //Decoding Nicea// by Paul Pavao, which I'm finding very engaging.
<<<

http://k0sh3k.philosopher.life/#Books has her current reading list. I can appreciate the appeal of //Decoding Nicea//. It's a vast topic, and I know too little of what it means to say Jesus is or becomes God and the evolution of this memeplex.

As usual, where I have failed in reading books this year, she has succeeded. She reads a decent variety and large quantity (particularly during time periods in which we don't watch any shows or movies). Sometimes, she is like a walking encyclopedia, and it's very fun to talk about some of her books with her. She reads differently than I do. She is the charitable constructor of almost all authors, and I am the mean deconstructor: it's a solid combination. She builds images in front of us, and I shoot them down until we have an alternative image that is more secure, coherent, or hilarious. I prize her ability to make leaps with me, to fill in all the dots that I forgot, to fill the world in, especially when she helps me destroy and reconstruct my own thoughts. She is my thoughtpoison and antidote.<<ref "wl">>

I see you're kind of a D&D enthusiast. You ever play Baldur's Gate? I had a narrow gaming selection as a kid, but still, this was a title I replayed way too often in proportion to what other activities were available to me at the time.
<<<

I'm a terrible D&D player; roughly, [[I play as myself in every character|https://www.kickscondor.com/normality-rpg]], as though I know I'm playing in a paranoically fictional narrative which objectively matters in the real world. Maybe it's a form of LARPing? I'm just straight fucking crazy, my dude. I'm a metagamer more than a gamer. I like thinking, talking about, planning, or watching D&D more than playing it. Baldur's Gate is a classic I've never touched. I have read about the game, and it looks intense. I have played the mindless skinnerbox versions of Baldur's Gate (the Diablo series), but I have never been much of a quester or RPer. Even in Everquest and WoW, I avoided it. I prefer the ludology to the built-in narrative almost every time. It's not that games don't serve as rhetorical devices in which we tell ourselves the stories of ourselves, it's just that direct story-telling mechanisms of authors don't tend to click with me. I must be doing something wrong. I have a flagrantly disrespectful, hard-knocks, chip-on-my-shoulder approach to authors and teachers, including game-devs. [[W5H]] they kick my ass is sometimes the most trustworthy expression of integrity.

That must have been a helluva a game to play as a kid! I had to fight to have the chance to read or play games which had any serious RP elements to them in my household until we were older. (Like pornography, D&D was the kind of straight-up evil activity that would have gotten you kicked out of the house).

I hope you don't mind if I sort of desync our conversations from here? I'd like to address the more theological/philosophical content in a separate email to keep some level of brevity and to allow our exchanges some thematic breathing room. The conversational streams may, of course, cross or split again in the future.

Thoroughly enjoying this,

Ivan
<<<

Excellent idea, yes, please sync and desync the conversation at will. We have to peel apart and synthesize ourselves again and again. That's the only way this can work, I think. Pick out the [[salient]] threads for us, sir! You are equal in the dialectic, and I must connect myself to the words you pick out for us. It is trust in the shaping and metashaping of our [[hyperconversation]]; it is justice as fairness. I beg you to practice [[The Golden Rule]] with me, and that means holding me accountable.<<ref "tw">>

I save quotes inconsistently, scattered across paper journals, Notepad.txts, cellphone photos, and random pieces of paper I'd thoughtlessly dumped in the recycling bin. I'm terribly disorganized.
<<<

At least you record it. I've done a bad job of it for most of my life. I have too many sections of my life which I can no longer see. My memorabilia is an image I cannot trust. I still feel the same way as you do (you can tell that even with my attempts at organization, I'm still somehow radically disorganized). Eh, I'm still learning.

I bought an i386 for $10 at a garage sale when I was 16 while staying in California for a summer. It was a retro experience (back to when I actually used these machines as a youngster). I fooled around on it, but I also collected quotes on it which were eventually transfered and lost among muh floppies. I've had paper journals. I've tried just a bunch of text files. Nothing has stuck with me until the wiki. I still have junk strewn about everywhere in my digital identities. One day, I must comb through them to integrate into this awful beast. I am not looking forward to it. It's been on my [[Wiki: TDL]] for a while now. My wife is thinking about how to do the same. [[Sphygmus]] also has a great deal to import and normalize into her wiki. The thought of unification is exciting to me.

The first entry in my current journal begins with a quote from Jane Austen's //Persuasion//:


>    "...they all went indoors with their new friends, and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think of accommodating so many."

I adore that quote. That is part of the spirit of the law of ancient hospitality. It reminds me of an important book in my childhood: //Always Room for One More//. It is one of the inspirations for my [[Find The Others]] {[[axiom]]}.

By my precious numinous/voluminous claim, I simply meant that God is not better understood through an excessive expenditure of words.
<<<

Oh. I have to turn it up to 11 here. `/paranoically peers over the edge of that cliff`. Umm ... Wait, you can't really mean to jump off this thing, right? ლ(ಠ_ಠლ). Hear me out first, dude, just in case I've misunderstood you.<<ref "joke">>

Are you sure? How did you come to understand this again? Do you really know what those words mean? Do you understand the price of these symbols? Surely, I do not. Given the radical ramifications of this provocative thesis, I suggest it merits profound exploration, honing, and resolution; I assume that must be your intention here. I hope I am not putting words into your mouth, but (as you know) you have uttered a redflag with me.<<ref "sq">> I appreciate your simply going out on a limb to state this ''bold'' claim. Make no mistake, this is a monster of a problem, and it's going to be a monumental struggle to show and explain to you what I (perhaps delusionally) understand about it, which is at best an approximation of just the tip of the iceberg. 

I will agree there are contexts in which uttering more words is not [[salient]], qua lacking fitting [[beauty]] or [[right]]eousness, and I aim to describe and preserve that with you as best I can. I'm fascinated by what it means to say one can tacitly know more than one can tell. Even Saints Kant, Wittgenstein, and Heidegger had no other choice but to talk a whole lot about what they said could not be talked about. I also recognize it is possible you understand far more about God, understandingness, language, the kinds of creatures we really are, and the world than I do. So, please tell me why. If you could be more clear about what you mean by this, I might be able to understand. What makes that true? Why are you justified in holding that belief? What is understanding if it is not through some sort of language? What is that which is rasterized into your [[phenomenology]] that conceptually cannot or ought not be described in a language? What is not a vessel of meaning? What cannot be reduced or translated? When ought we not talk about it? Tell me what is signified by //The Word//, sir. It's hard to say, I suppose. 

Yes, proselytizer, I have heard your fideistic words before, some more extensively than others. If excess is by definition vice on the virtue spectrum then, of course, the rest of your statement follows. Granted! It is not so easy to pick out what counts as excess, and the same for deficiency. It is my experience that homo sapiens tend to viciously favor deficiency to excess here (though you may be an exception) which is why I find myself advising us to overshoot the golden mean toward codification. Generally, I see humans who prefer sentiment to the expensive publically computable cognitive workload I'm pointing at. Beware, it's far more energy-efficient and convenient for our predictive modeling to take up this prescriptive quietizing skeptical thesis. DANGER, WILL ROBINSON! 

If what really matters is so basic that you can utter all that need be said about it in a few words then please tell me those words. I've been looking for them my entire life. What do you think is so [[salient]] it needs to be understood by everyone yet can be abbreviated, unqualified, and merits no radical intellectual exploration? What is [[good]] universal, basic, [[antipleonasmic]] philosophy which need not be fleshed out in language much further? Obviously, better understanding will not be the result of just any expenditure of words. Some sets of words point to and possess more [[good]] than others in a given context. 

We can never completely name [[The Infinite]] with a single finite word.<<ref "s">> In fact, we can never name anything related to [[The Infinite]] (which is everything) all the way down as finite creatures. Handling vagueness through precisification is not simple, problems of the consistency and completeness of ontology (and thus epistemology) are profound, and ultimately I'm unable to speak about the truth or falsehood of bivalence at [[The Dialetheia]]. Picking out what is [[salient]] with the virtuous perception particularized to one's context is a recursive problem into [[infinigress]]. I agree, we only arrive at a probabilistic lossy compressed abstraction, an image, a representation of the thing-in-itself. It is our risky plight to name "The I Am," //The Word//, The Original Self-Namer, as well as the animals in the garden as best we can. I do not deny [[faith]] is at the bottom and top of Wittgenstein's Ladder, but I have high demands on how we pull mystical rabbits, absurdities, and justifications for quietism, sentimentalism, and internalism out of the epistemic hat. 

I am concerned that epistemic sentimentalism devolves into mere subjectivity. We are linguistic creatures, and that includes our faiths and wrestling. Problematically, I'm not sure how else to fairly and kindly resolve fundamental disagreement about our emotions, desires, our trained System 1 fastminds, and qualia beyond this reflective equilibrium based on Reason. I have seen the dangers of showing without telling in many contexts.<<ref "ra">> I target both anticodificationism and circumlocutory rhetoric as far as I can. It is one thing to have personal [[faith]] (everyone does), and it is another to have a publically defensible one. Indeed, [[The Golden Rule]] is perilously demanding.

We have very quickly reached this point of contention I hold with most humans. I aim to make or break mystics in this space.<<ref "ef">> My pluralism is limited, and I will not accept relativized "this is what I feel" from those who are unwilling to go all the way down in expressing and defending it as the ground of all being. Translating the feeling of the ineffable into words is the price we must pay not only with one another, but also with ourselves as [[other]] over time. Even though it is not the fastest way to persuade or come to understand, it is often the only way to respect [[The Other]].

Most resort to quietism with me, but to that extent, these enlightened monks have a restricted right to participate in political discourse or social life with their egoistic, privatized point of view. Unfortunately, I'm convinced we are morally obligated to participate barring some exceptional reason, which, ironically, one would usually need to be able to account for (there is no escaping the fact that we must use our language as wisely as we can to engage in [[The Dialectic]]). Like everyone else, you are going to have to give me reasons and signals to trust what's inside your black functional beetlebox; understanding ourselves, each other, and [[The Good]] will always be an unending empirical and linguistic enterprise.

I'm straight-up mean about all roads to non-cognitivism. I'm hoping you will be able to forgive me in time for my violence. I am forced to use unreason with those who do not respect Reason enough.

This is all to say: I suggest we are both broken babblers in this space (and, it's fair to say, I am far more broken here). I admire your conviction. Yes, I'm trying to speak about the ineffable with you. I'm a wild, discombobulated animal compared to you here; you appear far more stoic and accepting of this problem than I do. It's not easy to balance or express to anyone, including ourselves. I appreciate your absurd generosity with me. There is something right about what you are pointing toward, but it is not simple; more importantly, in public discourse, we must draw those quietist linguistic_thought-terminators carefully. Yes, I trust your gut instincts and black box in places I do not with others, but our windowed language game is a trust-building exercise which generates public evidence. Faith without explicit reason is as dead as faith without works; the intention of reason-defined intentionality (being toward [[The End]]) is essentially one of the uncounterfeitable fruits of the spirit and an indispensable type of dialectical building-block.

<<<
One of the more ridiculous books in my library is this huge tome on the Sermon on the Mount by Martin Lloyd-Jones. What the gospel writers saw fit to condense into a quick maybe 20-minute read, is not //necessarily// better understood (in the way it needs to be understood) by being teased apart with its elements rigorously defined.
<<<

That is a fascinating claim. It almost sounds like bibliomancy to me, and I think it's fair to say this is //The Great Awakening// sort of language. I wish the "do what I mean" and [[The Truth]] particularized to our contexts were so simple. Even the Two Commandments I still hold run deep and wide, seeping into the cracks and details of everything I see. I must iterate over and continually reconstruct that supposed 20-minute read to grow and hermeneutically circle or spiral my understanding.

There are, of course, contexts in which it is not necessarily better to continue reading. I can give some quick, contrived, ad hoc examples to show that it isn't conceptually true in every case in all possible worlds. I agree to that. I'd like to see you unfold when it is necessary and when it isn't. What are the ways in which it need be understood? 

I don't know how much theology or biblical studies you have under your belt. You clearly like to read, and I'm convinced you know it is generally necessary to continue reading. What I see is a sprawling memeplex of progressive revelation since the beginning of the oral tradition (and arguably before). Even the gospel requires a lifetime of study and practice. Maybe that book on your shelf isn't necessary for you, particularly if you've found the same or better outside it, but I think you'd agree it can be fitting for others participating in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. I'm convinced your pursuit of what matters most will always require you to sign and interpret that which is significant again and again in reconstruction. 

Rigorously defining the [[salient]] elements allows one to have a concept of [[The Good]] which is more transferable. It goes more places.

<<<
To the extent I am speaking from an unacknowledged anti-intellectualism, I am impoverished. Maybe you'll prove me wrong. I also don't want our discourse to become a burden to you. 
<<<

I appreciate how you do not want our discourse to be a burden to me. You aren't a burden to me, though it a heavy letter for me, and I'm slow. It is my privilege to engage in discourse with you.

I don't believe you are really anti-intellectual, nor do I think you are impoverished in this regard. You are obviously smart, and your point of view is no accident. We have some crucial disagreements I am highlighting. It is difficult for me to gauge how strongly you stand on some of your claims. It's not my intention to waste your time or pointlessly grandstand. I'm drawing lines as brightly as I can for you.

You may see me the other way around here, like maybe I'm some ridiculous Spock-wanna-be or someone who turns his nose up at his limbic system too easily. It's not going to be easy to convince me to be less intellectual about my [[faith]]; it is exactly what deserves the most scrutiny. We're in trusting trust territory, and I aim to be confident in the depth of my Bob turtle. I seek precision here, even at the cost of concision.

Unfortunately, I must be annoying or worse to you on this topic. Most romantics are horrified by my position, but I think it's fair to say I regularly run into this issue with most people I meet at some point. For example, I'm fine with trying not to be excessive with words, but then you will get a very compressed claim. I look at [[Love]], [[Phenomenology]], [[Power]], [[Awe]], as being fairly technical and [[antipleonasmic]]. Unfortunately, there are moves in there which aren't going to feel justified or explained unless you've studied how those words might map onto something much larger. 

Here is where you may need to go full ad hominem on me (I've got the words around here somewhere to help you). Perhaps you need to tell me "you just don't get it" or worse because my vicious disposition prevents me from seeing (let alone fixing) it. The virtuous agent //just knows// in their heart of hearts, right? The mystic is fine with not explaining at some level (at least temporarily) - but where will we draw the line for justified mysticism, especially when we are obligated to provide public reasons? 

A proof is a step-by-step demonstration that one set of propositions is the logical consequence of another. Proofs are contextual; they ought to be particularized to the audience. I'm sure when you speak with an audience of artists of your caliber, you get to tell stories and use some fancy words, abstractions, and idiomatic libraries which compress and pick out what is [[salient]] to those fluent in the language with energy-efficiency and increased computational safety. You get to rely upon your audience's ability to make virtuous inferences which usually can only have been acquired through habit and experience like your own. Similarly, the mathematician's "left as an exercise to the reader" is sometimes a high barrier to entry. 

We're playing a language game right now (though not a //mere// game at all; this isn't some useless performance). We're building proofs in a lossy way. Unfortunately, even under ideal conditions (for the [[fff]]), philosophically, I can never be certain you are following the same rules that I am. Empiricism and continually testing for coherence in our linguistic rule-following is all we have left at that point. This includes our own self-dialectics, too; you are telling yourself the stories of who you are, and you need reasons to trust, guide, and justify it.

I think anti-intellectual is a harsh word. I hope to reason about the limits of reason here, and that's ridiculously hard. 

<<<
Also, I guess we'll get to the question of free will eventually. I sometimes wonder if even the fact of this question was imparted to us by God or the devil. I genuinely expect you'll help me clarify some thoughts on the matter. 
<<<

I will do my best to answer your questions, but I'm not convinced I will have anything satisfying all the way down for you (especially because I'm an incompatibilist). I'm straight-up question-begging our moral responsibility from my [[phenomenology]]; metaphysical autonomy appears to be a categorical assumption for the intentionality I experience (a controversial claim, no doubt). While I find the metaphysics and metaethics of agency fascinating and crucial, I have no satisfactory explanations of the essential ontological mechanics at the core of freewill, selfhood, contingency, change, and non-being. It is not easy to "pay the price of contingency for the gift of freedom." It's part of [[The Dialetheia]] as far as I can tell (a problem that Saint Gödel whispers to me). I have used reason as far as I can go, but I'm forced to guess which way to go in the desert; these are not small tentpegs to be dropping, especially since they have to be dropped in clusters.

I'd like for a moment, in the spirit of Mark 9:38-41, to pause and worship with you.

> May the Good God of all that is Right and Beautiful be exalted. We give You thanks and praise for the Light You have sent into the world. May our words and meditations be pleasing to You and may the blueprints of the Kingdom form the pattern of our conversation.
<<<

Thank you for your extremely gracious words, Ivan. It's so pointed and disarmingly simple: it brings tears to my eyes. Your words are exceptionally close to my belief. Homie, you are speaking my language. Preach, yo! I clearly see Mark 9:38-41 in this. Thank you. I see empathy in how you represent my own thoughts to me. Your prayer is more than a recognition of my argument, it points at the heart of everything I [[hope]] to be. While it is difficult to write a creed, especially with a pedantic squabbler like me, I can barely articulate your prayer more effectively to my understanding. I pause and worship with you, and, in the spirit of Mark 9:38-41, I recite your prayer back as best I can.

<<<
You've written (in the Good):

>    The Good, however, generates a subset of itself targeting the finite architectures and contextual particularities of each of our minds. Essentially, there is always a uniquely fitting implementation of The Good for every creature because The Good contextualizes itself. Perfect infinite theoretical wisdom must reduce itself to the fitting finite practical wisdom for mere mortals.

Given that this is true, why reject the contextualized aspect of the Good as it has been given us? I'm referring to your insistent de-personalization of the Deity. If the ideal outworking of the Law is empathy, why do you not empathize with the Spirit whom you grieve by robbing Him of Personhood?
<<<

I think you are the first person outside of my immediate family to have taken the time to engage my writing in [[The Good]]. Thank you. You aim to talk about what matters most with me. I am lucky to have the opportunity to inspect my gibberish with you. [[The Good]], as a tiddler, sits in shambles, and you are exceptionally charitable. Thank you. 

Let's see if you struck true, proselytizer. 

One move available to me, given your interpretation, is that I am //not// rejecting [[The Good]] as it appears to me whatsoever. Instead, on this interpretation, it would be because of my experience and lifelong study of [[The Good]] as it has been presented in my [[phenomenology]] that I'm justified in denying or refusing to take up the personhood of [[The Good]]. Furthermore, given the agglomeration of our contexts into some semblance of intersubjectivity, it appears I'm still justified in holding my claim. It gets worse for this approach when we include the perspectives of a hundred billion homo sapiens with such different experiences. However, I'm open to the claim most people are simply wrong even in their own context particularized to [[The Objective]], and I'm not talking about simply accepting the bare appearance of the thing-in-itself as it is given, especially because we're doing metaphysics here. 

There is a difference between how it is objectively contextualized and how it is given to each of us in our subjectivity. I'm worried you've conflated them. I also recognize it may present differently to each of us as well (probably conceptually the case). I'm not sure we really agree on what it means to say my claim is true (and it's my fault for lacking clarity). I'm attempting to reason about how to pragmatize [[fff]] computing about [[The Infinite]] which is infinitely computing itself (e.g. a Hegelian might say: The Absolute must reflexively negate Itself). I see no reason to think that pragmatization is best accomplished by attributing personhood to [[The Good]], let alone is even conceptually necessary (which appears to be the much harder task you must accomplish here). 

Why do you think justified contextualization of [[The Good]] conceptually requires us to commit to a personal God? Why is that an essential attribute of [[The Good]]? Is personhood a better-making property? Occam's Razored, hedged-conservative, epistemic humility in speaking about the noumena is more costly than you imply. You've already granted what is considered inflated metaphysics with me (breaching the Sagan standard is usually the hard part).<<ref "im">> The burden of proof is on you; you have to give me reasons rather than appeals to emotion here. This will become more important when we start to hit [[The Dialetheia]].

I think a better argument you should be using against me is the claim that some people are justified in holding beliefs of the personification of [[The Good]] even if their beliefs turned out not to correspond to the objective truth. In the contextualist "justified true belief" (JTB) tradeoff, I hold justification to be supreme. `/points-to-the-soft-belly` - this is where you need to strike, homie. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this can help you out in particular (since the capacity to provide the explanation likely precludes the disability of meaningfully exploring the opposing point of view), but there are other homo sapiens which it may fit. 

The tables may turn with this claim. Contextualization here does not imply you've perceived or epistemically acted correctly. There's a trail of deductions to make, one which may hermeneutically spiral. To be clear, I have empathized with your position. I was born into it. I did not take the shift from theism to deism lightly at all; it was world-ending for me. Even still, I am open to the claim we must attempt something like empathy with [[The Good]]. I also argue that [[The Good]] is computing [[Itself]] (perhaps like Saint Aristotle's god), but I am in no position to take up a variation of Saint Hegel's radical claim that the external world (or even just metaphysics or some part of metaphysics) is also a mind. Is it possible? Sure - but I am not justified in taking up the belief.

Standing in my shoes, don't you think it's fair for me to think you've got some balls to speak on behalf of your God? Surely you must say the same of me. How exactly do you know He is grieved again? If you are going to take up contextualization seriously, how do you know you aren't speaking to a prophet in the progressive revelation of your own memetic lineage right now? As you may imply the converse, deanthropomorphization of [[The Good]] may just as well be part of the justified pathing of your epistemology.

<<<
Maybe you do not want to risk building graven images? You've no doubt seen many of those who would be guilty of thinking He was altogether like us!
<<<

Oh, I am radically guilty of this, sir. I'm faced with the impossible task of accurately speaking about The Transcendent. My mind imposes categories on representations of everything in my [[phenomenology]], and I aim to humbly speak about what it means for a thing-in-itself to transcend the categories available to me without denying realism. What I experience is, in part, a construction of my mind, and, of course, that doesn't mean what appears to my consciousness otherwise obtains externally to it in all cases. Humble doubt is necessary for justified [[faith]] as an [[infinigress]]ive problem. Jacob/Israel wrestled, so did Saint Plato. Justification is a martial art.

<<<
Maybe you distinguish yourself from the simple who believe every word, thus you prudently consider your steps.
<<<

Lol. That is quite a line. Am I supposed to imply the inverse? Let me rehearse that: "Maybe you distinguish yourself from the ivory-tower skeptics who are certain they can reduce God and faith down to a mathematical equation or deny His existence from what they call some amalgam of pure reason or empiricism, thus you prudently leap off your non-cognitive cliff." Fuck that. I don't think either of these "maybe" lines charitably describe us. There's more to both of us than that.

[[Arrogance]] is not a simple problem. I try to be fairly empathic here since I was brainwashed, I've been incredibly gullible, I've been self-deceiving again and again, and I fail all the time (I mean: have you seen this letter?). Part of my belief that most people are evil boils down to the fact I've seen they aren't interested in justification; I would know, I'm profoundly guilty. Scaling our moral responsibility in our epistemology is a hard problem. 

Prudence would not be the word I'd prefer to use. I have a specific notion in mind when thinking about prudence in epistemology. I seek alethic justifications over prudential wherever (oh, yes, the circularity gets ugly) reasonably possible. You are correct: I'm trying to be careful. I have made so many errors in this space.

<<<
Your doubt is rooted in good.
<<<

That is exceptionally high praise. I hope to always live up to such a thing. Sometimes carving the negative space out of the marble slab leaves me the positive sculpture. Those who doubt have some conception of [[The Good]] by definition, though they may be wrong. There's a way in which the possibility of doubt and belief (as well as their dialectical relationship) are necessarily rooted in [[Good]]. Without a doubt, without doubt, there is no possibility of intentionality in how we reconstruct our epistemologies, make judgments, and interpret our [[phenomenology]]. 

<<<
Your moral receptors are sensitive and functioning, but what to make of your divine prosopagnosia; your inability to cry out "Abba! Father!"?
<<<

ROFL. Right back 'atcha, kiddo. //Good God//, you are here to play ball, proselytizer. You have no fucking clue what you are saying. You are going to have to pay a price for those words with me, son. 

Alright, I suppose this letter needs more posturing and [[villainous|Villains]] monologing, so lemme bust out muh sick kar-ah-tay cranekicks for ya.<<ref "wa">> Watch out now, it's on like donkeykong. Them is fightin' words, homie. Are you prepared to eat them or even die for them? Get your dukes up, [[Durden|Fight Club]]. I adore how you know that not all perspectives are equal. I am grateful that you take the time to point out my inabilities. There are many. I warned you upfront, my friend; we don't have to do this. Despite my usual retarded condescension and gratuitous pursuit of violence, I aim to harmoniously resolve our disagreement without having to kick your ass, sir. Sometimes the difference between us feels so minimal to me; it is painful to damage you. Must you press this button? 

If it matters to you: I did cry out. And, I cried out when I saw the futility in crying out. I don't think most people even have a teaspoon of the faith flowing through my veins. Intense failure that I am, my life is a test and testament. It was my [[faith]] that led me away from my faith, and don't you dare fucking forget it. Are you paying attention, son? I think you see where I'm at right now far better than where I've been, nomad.<<ref "tc">> Though it's fair to say I'm still crying out in this wiki. 

Moral receptors are divine receptors, and vv.; we're doing moral philosophy right now. That's exactly what [[The Good]] enables: perception of anything at all, intentionality, a being toward a unified [[gfwiwcgws]], and awareness of the sufficient reason all the way down into [[The Dialetheia]]. We hurtle inexorably toward it (which is not the claim we recognize or arrive in any satisfactory manner). But, if you really think you see The Face more clearly than I do, then I've some blind-sighted questions which need reasonable answers, master. I beg you decode the mysteries for me.

So, tell me, angel of Ehyeh ašer ehyeh, what is more worthy, good, and divine than [[The Good]]? //My debt to you would be unpayable//. I would be blind-sided by [[awe]]. Yes, despite my best efforts to doubt it, I believe in the divine beyond compare, but why should I believe it is your God which is The One? Tell me why the Judeo-Christian God, in particular, is the one and only necessary answer. What makes The Bible and your strain of that memetic tradition objectively authoritative? Why should we think everyone else is wrong not to believe some precise subset of what you do here? Why should I think you see what comes out of that blinding light any more clearly than I do? Lastly, proselytizer: why does your God allow evil in the world when it doesn't have to?<<ref "yw">> If you have an ounce of the integrity I had, you'd be scared shitless to answer those questions with publically verifiable reasons. ''I know'' you can't answer those questions, so I ask you to babble wisely with me. I'm not saying you aren't morally justified in some semblance of Christian faith, but I am claiming you do not have the moral right to proselytize as you have thus far. Your private evidence does not have the public weight you've implied it does.

As you were worried, having done it myself again and again, I think you've constructed an image of God in your own likeness; I don't think you've really reconciled what it means to say [[It]] is The Transcendent (and you must say the same of me). It's time for you to start putting your skin in the game now. Choose your words, tentpegs, and weapons wisely, sir. Private non-cognitivism and quietism masquerading as fully functioning public justifications must be punished. Failing to justifiably codify your apologetics with publically verifiable reason is evidence of sophistry, hubris, and egoism. If you really think it wise, if this is the rabbithole we must go down, then lay it on me. In [[T42T]], I'll hunt it down in you, if that's what you are really asking for. I'd much prefer to dance rather than brawl.

I suggest it is worth tabling this discussion until you have digested why I think we don't have to fight here. Aren't you the least bit curious how my wife and I get along on this one? You don't have to lose limbs in this guillotine. I suggest there is still profound compatibility available to us. Disagreement here is an ethical one we can more gently resolve, and given what I understand (perhaps poorly) about you, I don't think you have to pay any major price for it. 

<<<
> If you are interested in telling me, [[W5H]] did you convert?

I was baptized in a Catholic church as a baby and attended a Sunday school at a Presbyterian church until I was ten or eleven. My mom came from a Christian family (her grandfather converted in China) and, growing up in Malaysia, she and her large family were often helped by a local Presbyterian group, leaving her with positive emotions towards the denomination. I think it is important that I don't neglect to share the generally favourable Christian context I grew up in, even if we weren't actively practicing for many years.
<<<

I'm grateful for all context you provide me. It is important to see why we have the emotions we have, especially since part of our disagreement may be concerned with sentimentalism and the role of reason in [[faith]]. I also have no intention of neglecting what was favorable about my Christian context growing up, but my home is very messy and cluttered (it takes some hunting). I don't have a full account for you, but I'll start where you do.

I was baptized at 8 by my male donor in one of his small country Methodist churches on a circuit in KY (my female donor had to travel considerably further into the woods for hers).<<ref "bap">> I lived 500 yards from it in the tiny parsonage. It was completely funded by two families who had their wealth due to growing tobacco and illicit substances (helicopters flew over our houses to burn crops on various property lines), reinvesting in real estate, and constructing competing lumber-based manufacturing facilities which exploited the poor. They were highly influential, it was a good ol' boys club, and one family even got in trouble with the FBI for stuffing ballots. 

Having been a heavily practiced PK, my exposure would make any honest person both fairly cynical of those who claim to be Christian and radically convicted by those few who actually spent their lives serving others (though even this line of reasoning is clear in The Bible). Looking back, I admired those people who fed children food, visited shut-ins, wrestled for the truth with the books and people they had, and participated as political animals with integrity. [[Saint Laura Holmes|2019.02.12 - Prompted Introspection: Lulu]] was a Christian woman I've been so lucky to have met, unlike [[some others|2019.03.02 - Prompted Introspection: Mrs. Cox]]. I cannot unsee the [[beauty]] of what made her [[right]]eous; I could only [[hope]] to live up to her, to pay her back, and to live with that much integrity. I still see Jesus Christ in her. She blinds me.

I wish you could have met her.  You have the biggest shoes to fill I've ever witnessed in my life, sir. If you are so lucky, whose gigantic shoulders do you stand upon?

<<<
In my early teens I started reading Naomi Klein (No Logo and Shock Doctrine) which lead me into anti-corporatism, and then eventually Zeitgeist-ism.
<<<

Zeitgeist may be an important word for us. I find myself in many contexts, each with their own norms and intentional tendency of being toward some set of goals. Do you consider this a "when in Rome" kind of notion? Do you think there are justified instances of zeitgeist? I am interested in both explanations and justifications of memes sweeping the herds and masses. Of course, I'm happy to talk shit about unjustified meme markets, convenient signaling, and merely chic posturing. There may be more to handle here though.

<<<
I developed some contempt for Christianity, which I associated with Bush-era American imperialism, and, being a mystic, viewed the Yahweh of the Word as a sort of usurper of the Goddess of the Image's proper place. I didn't actually know any earnest believers to measure my impressions against except for one bible-thumping con-man who I only met infrequently.
<<<

My contempt wasn't so much developed toward Christianity nor even Christians if you are going to define it as the remnant. As a PK, I was privy to the lives of many families in a way the average person does not access. My contempt for Christianity has developed in virtue of contempt for self-described Christians and people in general. As an autist, I have a difficult time generalizing without an excessive number of particulars. It has been a horrifying [[redpill]] for me. My wrestling with American imperialism and political questioning began with the Clinton-era, though the Bush-era was also a confirmation for me. Living in KY during the Bush-era helped me begin crystallizing who the humans around me really were (likely to be) though.

Earnest pursuers of [[The Truth]] are difficult to pick out. Some of the most earnest believers I know do not have the faculties to follow my violent gibberish arguments, but they follow the best arguments available to them. They don't have to be Christian, but they are religious. They aren't haphazard, and their goal-directedness isn't arbitrary. They are obviously doing the best they can with what they have. Of course, I've seen hundreds of Bible-thumping conmen (and some from other belief systems), but I have been lucky to meet some rare and honest people who aim to be continually and justifiably transformed by their [[faith]]s too.<<ref "ap">>

When I was 21, I found someone on Youtube making a positive case for Christianity, and because he seemed both thoughtful and sincere, I was intrigued. I was familiar with the basic doctrines already, but the internet opened up an avenue to explore the personal consequences of the faith in a way I had not seen before.
<<<

I agree the internet is fantastic for this. Sometimes that is the only way available to us too. I should warn you that academic Christian work still has not be digitized effectively (they jealously guard their intellectual property), so you are limited online regarding some kinds of research. Exploration through the leet work is going to require access to paper material. We can, of course, dismiss the relevance of that work to some [[dok]]. I am fine with taking Jesus' words extremely seriously, though I am far more concerned with the spirit of his law than the letter. 

<<<
I knew enough at the time to realize that 'belief' in something must be grounded in something that was demonstrably plausible, and that it ought to have consequences in the way I ordered my reasoning and practice.
<<<

I hear that. We're very much thinking about that epistemic problem together. Most people will agree they have a moral code of some kind for picking out what is [[salient]], but few take the grounds of the metaphysics of morals seriously.

<<<
I also can't deny the role emotion and fear played in moving me in the direction of belief as I found myself increasingly worried that if anything like the God of the Bible existed, my current lifestyle choices were not aligned with Its principles.
<<<

I am grateful that you call it //principles//. That is an expensive stance to hold.

To my understanding, there is no reason without emotion. It's not just an evolutionary issue, but likely a conceptual one. At the very least, it's inescapably part of our self-dialectics as homo sapiens. I cannot say your worries were as rational as they could be, but I have no room to talk. It's hard to call the origins of my belief rational by any stretch. My belief began before it was a choice, and it continued even as I stripped standard aspects of Christianity out of it. 

What is most orthodox^^tm^^ about Christianity remains the two greatest principles.<<ref "ort">> Crucially, one can argue for these without ever encountering The Bible or Christian memeplexes. Dasein(s) in a vacuum can arrive at the spirit of those truths; that is the hallmark of categorical normativity. Truth which can be found in nearly all contexts is about as universal as it gets. All roads lead to it, brother.

I wrestled for months with unease until I gave up one night, face down in my room, and spoke with the God Jesus presents as 'Our Father', asking me to take Him as His own.

What followed were weeks of a sort of disorientated joy. Circles of love for others were being drawn increasingly larger, habits of sin (traditionally defined) were violently rooted out of my life, and then commenced the beginnings of a pattern of prayer and answer.

Thank you for telling me a crucial part of your story. It cannot be fun telling it to a contentious asshole like me. I believe this is your experience, and I am grateful for your honesty. As you know, I've listened to variations of this story since before I could read and write. I have witnessed the testimonies of non-Christian religious, spiritual belief systems, and cults that parallel it too. Memes spread virally with such testimony. I am glad insofar as it produces [[right]]eous humans like yourself.

Obviously the issue of cherry-picking for my bias comes into play here.

<<<

Cherry-picking and bias are hard problems in epistemology. They aren't always the swearwords to me they can be with others. It turns out that the virtuous agent of a practice possesses the virtuous perception for picking out what is [[salient]] in a domain, including some ability to reliably name objects and processes using an [[fff]] semblance of the logic of the good of that practice in a context. I aim to grant you significant space in inarticulacy on the matter insofar as you are willing to continue articulating it more precisely; in the end, I aim to understand the various practices you are trying to be a virtuoso in, especially as they are unified into the practice of being who you ought to be.

To what extent do you take seriously the notion of being filled with the Holy Spirit? What do you think it means from a neurophysiological perspective? Some of the most pious humans I've met were not people who appeared (or spoke) of being filled with the Spirit. Devotion to [[right]]eousness is difficult to fittingly measure.

But actually, as much as I fear my power to select memories in favour of my bias, I've seen direct answers to prayers often enough that, if I have to doubt, I doubt in the direction of reality maybe being constructed along the lines of some kind of The Secret notion. Which would just be awful. Awful!
<<<

JUST AWFUL! XD. Lol! You are wonderful. I wish I knew how to do that gentle riot thing as well as you and others do. By comparison to your fragrance, I'm a living homicidal fart joke. 

I'm not sure what kind of //The Secret// notion you have in mind. Is this law of attraction, gnosticism, preordination, or some other kind of divine intervention? They are delicious and inspiring. I don't deny it. It's an impressive story to tell oneself. I am, of course,  deeply confused because I'm religious without being terribly spiritual. 

I do my best to be as deflationary about metaphysics as I can. I make the target window pinhole into the other side as tiny and safe as possible while still biting the bullet. All that said, I am lucky to experience serendipity, [[beautiful]] coincidence, [[awe]], the unfolding of the world and finding my place in it. I wish I knew how to describe it well enough (still working on it, poorly).

> Any story you can tell as a theist I can translate as a deist.

Ok, but why?

Because it's wise to doubt the representative accuracy of the image you are seeing and to recognize the limits of what you can really say about what is behind it. If you are really going to call your God transcendent, you're going to need to own up to flat out guessing here regardless of what you've seen. This isn't an empirical question, it's a rational one: we have to try to be humble about the noumena here. (I am obviously awful at this). I regret that my [[faith]] is so damned legalistic, hairsplitting, coercive, and painful. My transparency is not an accident; it's what I expect of anyone who is going to argue at this level. If you think it a prison, I am sorry. The Justified Rule of Law is an emergent feature of people binding themselves to [[The Golden Rule]] all the way down.

<<<
Assuming you can account for truth-telling, reliability of memory, etc...Why would a slew of personal stories of prayer being improbably answered, sometimes hours later, not count in favour of a listening/responsive deity?
<<<

Yes, so, let us grant you all the fitting lighting conditions: your testimony isn't offered under duress, you satisfy the conditions for being a reliable indicator, your mind fits some reasonable standard of coherence, your codification of your [[phenomenology]] aims to be honest and accurate, etc. Your experience counts in favor of talking about an appearance here. That doesn't mean you get to help yourself to pulling a rabbit out of the metaphysical hat. Despite what it feels like, I'm doing my best to help you safely and fairly pull rabbits out of that hat. Does it count in favor, as in does it justify a belief of a personal god? In many contexts, yes. Of course, that comes in [[dok]], as do the permissions and obligations of beliefs based on that evidence.

Note, of course, how most of humanity doesn't share your experience either. Going off their experiences, granting the same generous epistemic conditions and intentions, results in beliefs about images contrary to yours here. Even as a particularist and contextualist, I'm no relativist. I'm fully willing to admit the possibility they could all be wrong about their experiences and you right about yours. I prefer as public of reasons as we can muster to be the core of our discourse.<<ref "pf">> 

[[Phenomenal]] experience of the noumena is mostly a wash; the standard model in philosophy demands it is impossible by definition.<<ref "ub">> I'm sticking my neck out as some kind of speculative realist here. I'm not saying you don't access it at all (purely fucking crazy to say in many philosophical circles), but I think it's fair to pressure you heavily where you might think your raw experience overrides everyone else's. But it might! That's part of the reason I believe I'm morally permitted to demand codification of your testimony here, a quadratic sacrifice of your voice, social capital, and energy in our voting procedures. That evidence is limited in the [[dok]] of warrant it supports. Those privately generated reasons are weaker than other more public kinds because they can't be intersubjectively verified (even as some non-apodictic lossy pursuit). Sprankle the qualia, and we've got ourselves a real problem in trying to fairly resolve a fundamental disagreement about that which transcends experience (except insofar as it is paradoxically immanent).

I'm not a radical skeptic; I'm fighting those bastards on their own turf. Further, I not only aim to protect your political right to testify, I demand it. [[Humanity]] requires it. There is a difference between the tongues you speak and how it ought to be interpreted by the congregation. There is a justice as fairness problem here. There are objective moral requirements, due process, skin-in-the-game bonds, and constraints on how we tell ourselves and others the stories of who we are, especially in relation to [[The Absolute]].

I think this is a hard pill to swallow, coming from me. Most people think I have ridiculously high standards and expectations of everyone, and they think I'm delusional or even evil for demanding that they wrestle with what I'm pointing at.

I know three ex-Muslims, two who are close friends, whose conversions were catalyzed by visions of Christ. Why pull back the goalposts when a visible emanation of the deity manifests?
<<<

I have ex-Christian friends whose conversions were catalyzed by experiences of many things (not all of which were visual). This conflict and variation is a reason to doubt the universality of what those individual visions correspond to. Appearances can be deceiving, so what about it at least appears like it can't be or is less likely to be deceiving (ad nauseum)? I'll gladly agree we partake of the divine in perceiving anything at all, but that doesn't mean what we've perceived is so directly representative of the divine [[Itself]]. 

Is it fair to say you are accusing me of moving the goalposts? That is a strong accusation, one we both will have to work hard to live up to. I'm grateful you'd take the time to hold me accountable to such a thing. I'd like to ask you to very carefully walk me through it. I grant it is our plight to speculate given our experience. I take us to be negotiating the principles which govern the contextualized goalposts used to measure the warrant and justification one ought find in any account, explanation, or experience of what matters most.

That is a fascinating question with an [[infinigress]] built right in. I don't have a satisfactory account of giving a satisfactory account in all contexts (we are both in this boat together). I would also argue it's even more important to answer "what reasons //ought//." I'm not convinced we ever have a right to stop [[Questioning Everything|Question Everything]], but I'll agree we can do so in [[dok]]. The problem always obtains for finite creatures. We can only ever work toward [[The Good]]. I'm not sure if or what you aim to import by "rigged" here, but I appreciate that paranoia ought to be limited [[irwartfrr]]. In my experience, most humans don't doubt enough, and I think I have a prima facie right to request they doubt further, especially insofar as I demonstrate I'll walk down the path with them.

I'm not asking you to //apologize for contemporary Christianity// sharing milkshakes with Mammon at the Hamusement park, but are there other expressions of the ancient faith out there?

XD. I'm glad you add humor to a good point. 

Yes, there are many expressions, variations, interpretations, branches, and evolutions of this memeplex. To be clear, I take my own words to be such an expression. I appreciate that you do not ask me to apologize for elements or aspects of (so-called?) Christianity that cannot be defended. If you are asking me about the limits of my pluralism, I'm not convinced Christianity has or will ever have an epistemic monopoly on expressing justified faith. One can arrive at what matters most without ever encountering an image of Christ (Romans 1:19-20, Romans 2:12-16). There are lines of reasoning in many sections of the Judeo-Christian tradition which are universalizable, though, and I am deeply indebted to untold numbers of humans who have lived, defined, explained, and justified their faiths, both Christian and non-Christian.

What ought all [[faith]]s have in common? What is categorical? What is that which matters in all or most all contexts? What is the foundation to all other possible foundations? What selects what is salient in everything, including [[Itself]] from [[Itself]]? What is the self-explaining, self-interpreting, self-computing, and self-justifying Axiom of Reality and Ideality? That's what I'm going to apologize for, and the rest fades by comparison for me.

I just came back from the States meeting up with friends from a Christian charitable organization I'm involved with. Some of them are missionaries, others are involved in practical expressions of love which include helping guide sustainable farming development, building safe house networks, and many other good things where poverty forces people to rely on God in ways we rich folk rarely have to, and they tell of ways that He moves and reveals patterns that can't simply be chalked up to good luck or good planning.

I can tell you know many of the moves here. You've been charitable, humble, and careful with your words. I'm going to hand back probably what you predict I'd say to continue the conversation train.

I appreciate that you believe this. I have also believed and felt such things before. It can be quite [[Beautiful]] (especially for someone like me who can be preoccupied with their pattern recognition), but it's another thing to call it [[Right]]. Our experiences here don't have the weight we might [[hope]]. I also cannot tell you I am certain. I'll tell you that humans are pretty awful in some areas of metacognition concerning probabilistic reasoning. The Monte Hall problem is a practical example of how many of us are ironically susceptible to misunderstanding inductive reasoning.<<ref "ih">> Confabulation is difficult to mitigate, and impossible to eliminate; we can only ever become more confident in what is behind the image (outside of the indubitable aspects of "what it is like to experience that image as oneself").

Skepticism is often useful for teaching us about the limits of what can be justified and [[W5H]]. 

<<<
> Every ounce of evidence you have requires no personal interaction; it could all have been set into motion by anything. It appears functionally reducible, and I'm worried it is hubris to think one could see that far into the noumena to know. I don't see why you will ever have public or private evidence of a personal relationship with a theistic God, not even for yourself.

Am I claiming to know that much?
<<<

Yes, I think you are claiming that you know (which is not the claim you are certain), and if not that, at least claiming you are justified in your belief. Am I wrong? Do you deny it? Even if I don't see why you could have that private evidence, I'm willing to grant the possibility. But, there are significant moral limits and requirements on how that evidence must be interpreted both privately and publically. 

Here is another weak spot in my epistemology: I believe the fitting epistemic standard in our contexts is higher than others might. This is probably where you should go with your goalpost concern (perhaps not that I've insidiously moved them, but rather that I might have unreasonable standards of reason even if they were static goalposts).

<<<
My models of the world have had countless re-iterations, and I expect to continue updating for as long as I refuse to prize cynicism.
<<<

I agree they have and will update; in fact, they'll update whether you want it or not while you are still alive. You also shape how they update to some [[dok]]. I'm not convinced that cynicism necessarily has the effect you've suggested here. 

I would like you to tell me what you mean by cynicism, especially concerning its normative properties. I have to ask you: do you think I'm immorally cynical in this matter? It's okay if you do, and I hope you'll think carefully about it with me. I'm building the best bridge I know how for ya: it's a bridge to many people I know, too.

<<<
As for evidence, I'm not sure we could even have a real conversation about that as you seem to have rejected the notion of epistemic possibly-ness for this entire category of subjects.
<<<

I can appreciate that you aren't sure. I am curious about what you think consists in "a real conversation." I can scarcely tell you myself. There are different currencies being exchanged here. Some of them can be verified by computers as being structurally valid and, in some cases, sound. Others are a matter of trust and appearance. I think we're still in a real conversation about that.

I apologize for being exceptionally pedantic in this exact phrase, but I mean something so absurdly specific by it: "epistemic possibly-ness." I would, for example, be open to the claim that every possible thought is found in [[The Infinite]]. I think you mean this in terms of whether or not your spiritual experiences have any possible positive weight in public epistemic evaluation. 

<<<
If there is no evidence you will ever allow, then I'm afraid I'm just a poor sparrow of the field colliding with your spotless, but closed, window.
<<<

What do you mean by "allow" here? What are the standards of what ought to be allowed in the game you are considering? My argument is that some kinds of evidence have priority in our discourse. If you pay very close attention to my political position, you will see I aim to make radical space for your evidence in a fair manner. Resolving fundamental disagreement over accounts of [[The Good]] is a serious practical matter for me, one which must be computed through the second commandment. Let me suggest that my dogmatism is in virtue of protecting an open window that aims to respect the evidence, even if it isn't as you wish.

I think "why" the window appears closed matters, and that goes for all of us. 

<<<
> More fundamentally, it is not clear to me that examination isn't a form of engagement, but I'd like to know why you think you are engaged any further than I am

Thank you for provoking me to exercise caution here. I don't want to make assumptions, in my arrogance, that devalue what you've learned and experienced.
<<<

Thank you for being so thought-provoking as well. I hope you can see that I think you have a right to devalue what I've learned and experienced in various contexts under fitting conditions. Of course, I agree, we can be mistaken, arrogant, and fail to make the correct assumptions given what we have, and I appreciate your humility and honesty in our discourse.

This letter has not been a simple one to write. I appreciate your willingness to think and feel carefully with me here. I too aim to exercise caution and evaluate what we both have learned and experienced as accurately as possible. [[IA2DYJ]]. As empirical creatures who cannot rely upon pure reason alone, we are forced to make assumptions; thankfully, we can alter at least some of them.

<<<
I'm not sure the allusion to a linear journey as implied by terms like 'further' are always helpful as they suggest that there is a common route we all take where such measurements are meaningful.
<<<

This is a serious concern of mine. I don't take it lightly. I seek to make ample room for this problem. I am a pluralist to some [[dok]], though most find me absurdly narrow-minded, dogmatic, amygdalic, and [[arrogant]] in my approach. 

Insofar as our lives are linear, and insofar as some versions of ourselves are better than others, I may disagree. It's not that it isn't meaningful, but it's not as meaningful as we'd like or might initially think. Not all routes are equal, and they can be measured against an objective standard (even if we ourselves, subjectively, can never be certain, and in many cases, not even confident). I am convinced there are many humans in history who are morally better persons than I am: they did better with what they had for the sake of that which matters most moreso than I have (even if Based Elon were to give away everything he had right now, he'd never pass through that eye with the comparable virtue of the saints I have met). Of course, our moral effort must lead us down different paths in many cases, but all moral paths have something in common, as even [[The End]] defines the means. All roads lead to One, even if our lives are too finite for us to reach such a thing: we can only ever point, even with our gibberish, sir. 

You would agree there are some things which are universally true which we must all pursue, right? Surely, philosophy cannot be reduced to mere subjectivity wandering aimlessly in a meaningless desert toward no end.<<ref "pd">> I fully grant the need to contextualize, and I will even agree that making comparisons between journies is difficult for us to do; however, to deny that such a measurement is even theoretically possible has far-reaching implications. I appreciate why you are not sure.

Do I think some of the saints in the world have backgrounds as or are in fact Jewish, Agnostic, Hindu, Buddhist, Atheist, Yoruban, LDS, Muslim, Spiritually-Queer, Aesthete, Aesetic, Scientist (though probably not Scientologists ;P), etc.? Sure, though in the 21st century, they are likely radically heterodox and widely read given the resources available to them. They aren't self-proclaimed moderates. In the history of Daseinic homo sapiens, I am convinced some minority of them are the heroes we all need but don't deserve. Perhaps most of them are illiterate, barely putting together the words they have to say the truth as best they can, fighting for what matters most. As always, to whom much is given, much is required; and, of course, ought implies can. What do they all have in common? Why, the two greatest commandments, of course, even if they don't realize it or have argued or pursued it in wildly the wrong direction at some level. 

<<<
Instead, I like to think we're all either oriented towards or away from the Good (embodied in Christ) and that part of our duty to one another is simply to strengthen and particularize that orientation, regardless of our starting point (which could be all over the map). 
<<<

Preach, yo. Surely, you are the sort of Christian my donors warned me about: the [[Good]] kind. XD. Excellent.

I agree that everything is meant to be toward [[The Good]] (as best as possible) and inexorably hurtles toward [[It]], some things and persons more effectively (or goodly/well) than others (some aspects being up to us). As you know, it is quite a radical claim to say [[The Infinite]] is embodied in something finite (unless you prefer to doubt this, which is unorthodox but perhaps worth your consideration). I am unqualified to say much about it. I agree the [[The Good]] obtains in or is reflected by all things which exist to some [[dok]]. I suggest that is not the embodiment you mean, but it's a start (my claim is compatible even if underwhelming).

I race toward your belief about our duties to one another, but I'm not sure how to say it well enough for you. I think you are agreeing we can each be wrong about anyone's positioning, orientation, and circumstances. I take it, by particularizing an orientation, you mean that you pick out [[salient]] features and details for them in their context, and perhaps strengthening tends to be motivational or concerned with increasing the odds of their success toward [[The End]]. It's not easy to gauge their positioning, velocity, resources, and endpoints on that map, including what is available to them. It's a lossy blind leading the blind affair, and I agree humility is especially in order. 

The algorithm for empathizing [[irwartfrr]] is very hard to name. What does it mean to construct ourselves with [[The Other]], and more importantly, [[gfwiwcgws]], toward what [[End]]? How do we fairly compute our conception of the [[The Good]] in how we interact with others. What does it mean to use both our private and public evidence to compute [[The Good]] of [[The Other]], including with respect to their own beliefs and desires (which comprise who they really are to some non-trivial [[dok]]). The privacy embedded in trust must be wielded with profound humility, even when it looks like hubris to do so in some cases. 

Part of what makes me so insane is that I believe we each, as individuals and perhaps emerging collective agents, have an objective set of morally justified sequential purposes at any given timeslice. One of the ways in which I am [[arrogant]] (or, too charitably, [[arrogant]]-appearing) is that I'm a heavy-handed dipshit in how I judge, interact with, resolve, and integrate with others and their conceptions of [[The Good]], including their paths to [[It]]. I aim to be stringent on a particular set of grounds (there are critical places I see which I'm convinced others cannot and sometimes choose not to see), yet radically open and pluralist everywhere else. In some ways, my autism is a blessing and other times a curse here. I have the gall to not only think I know something about [[The Good]] for us but also [[The Good]] of and for you; and I aim to be justified and escalatingly coercive in how I force people to face it. I would rather just let people do their own thing (it would be so much easier to say "you do you"), but it's my purpose, sadly. I will fail myself and [[others]], but I must try. I know that to some extent I will be justifiably hated for it.

One of my primary [[Lifetime Projects]] is [[The Original Position]], which is generously stated as collectively and reflectively finding and fairly negotiating a representation of [[The Good]] given our disparate perspectives on [[The Good]] in as fair a manner as possible. I take your concern seriously, and I aim to decentralize [[power]] in a radical fashion here. There is a place where your voice must count just as much as mine, regardless of authority. I suggest this is a place we should think about together. 

<<<
Anyway, forgive me for my imperfect addressals. Please don't think this is a burden to me, I very much enjoy it, and I'm glad we're both in a position to respect each other's busy-ness and responsibilities.

In sincerity and brotherly love,

Ivan
<<<

No need to forgive anything. I'm grateful for how seriously you take our conversation. You are too gracious to say I am not a burden or that speaking with me is enjoyable. I have what many consider to be a freezing cold faith, like I'm some heartless bastard who doesn't feel the pull of what really matters most. And I am grateful for your radical patience with me as I cobbled this letter together. It might not look like it, but a lot of thought and soul-searching went into it. Thank you for sending me into a deepthink. I'm grateful to you for empathizing, asking penetrating questions, and allowing me to evaluate. 

One of the things I respect most about you is that you actually care about what eternally matters, and you sacrifice for it. Your signaling has been valuable in helping me understand and dismiss my doubts about you. You're one of the few people I speak with who are open to the possibility of being a "sinner" in any radical sense; moreover, you actually do something about it. It's shocking to see. 

<<<
I've really enjoyed seeing your letter to me dated 06.25 develop. However long it takes until you consider it 'done', I appreciate you taking your (and my) words seriously.

It's like I have 10,000 things to tell you, and I have no idea how to cram it in here. I'm such a poor modeler of your mind that I take a ton on [[faith]].

I also appreciate the constructive condescension you've shown me as my superior in this art. I'll refrain from returning the flavour until the meat browns.

XD !!! Ayyyyyy.

I am [[in for|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnWCGwB7idc]] a [[treat|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w1vMWsB3wc]]. I hope to be a good [[pupil|https://tv.getyarn.io/yarn-clip/e72c5b19-004f-47df-9d02-55dac88d46b4]]. If you pin me, please [[don't spit in my mouth|Boogerpicking]] unless it is necessary for the lesson.

You have a right to fire back. While I would like to increase the rate of our chitchat in general, I'm going to request that you take at least a month to respond to this letter in particular (in addition to how much time you've already spent thinking about its evolution). I find it highly unlikely that you will be able to digest and fire back a fitting reply without a chunk of time. There's some serious wrestling to do in here (even for experts who would read this letter). 

Ask yourself how well I can see you without being able to read your wiki. Perhaps I'm just flat wrong (I'm sure I've made many mistakes in modeling you). I hope you see I am empathizing with you the best I can with the asymmetry of information between us. Hopefully, you can flip me the bird and hug me at the same time. It aint easy.

<<<
Interesting.

“What is necessary, after all, is only this: solitude, vast inner solitude. To walk inside yourself and meet no one for hours—" (Rilke).
<<<

That is a fantastic quote! I would like to understand what you think about it. My initial perspective: [[2019.11.20 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Rilke]].

<<<
Experiences I share with you will likely be misunderstood or transformed in the transmission. Not because you are autistic, or a Deist rather than a Theist, but because information loss is the tax we pay on communicating while remaining distinct. But you mitigate a ton of this by asking clarifying questions, and by obviously adopting the mindset of a serious listener. Likewise, a lot of what you've written (not to me directly), I find difficult to grasp, but I am making efforts to think about you and understand you. Despite our vast differences, I don't feel especially far from you.
<<<

Aye, not just because I'm different in those respects, but that I'm different at all. I'm grateful that you take the time to try to close what gaps there are with me (even though we will always remain distinct). I can tell you have been thinking about it too. Thank you. I'm sorry that my gibberish is precisely that. I appreciate how much time and effort you give me to build bridges with you.

<<<
I sometimes wonder if alienation is a communication-level phenomenon. Like, if we all just understood each other, meaningfully, maybe that would be enough.
<<<

Enough for not being alienated, right? It depends on what you mean by understanding. There are [[infinigress]]es and bullets to bite here, including some conceptual problems I've pointed to already. Insofar as we are distinct (even from our own various selves), those won't be going away (however infinitesimal in appearance), which is your point, I believe.

<<<
But the voice cries out in the desert (not you, the other one): Repent! Is that it then? If so, then understanding is only a prerequisite to change, which is the necessary act. The extent to which you and I will diminish our mutual estrangement will be the extent to which we've changed meaningfully to more resemble one another. I don't feel far from you, but we are estranged insofar as our goals and actions don't cohere (which is arguable).
<<<

There is a difference between resemblance and translation here. I agree we resemble each other in some surprising ways, but I think your translation and bridge-building goes much further. Perception, including judgment, as a modeling activity has corresponding resemblance between representation and thing-in-itself as a virtue.<<ref "ari">> I take it that not feeling far from me is in virtue of better understanding me, but alienation might only be solved by complete sublation of us.

Just in case it should be said, I'm still taking up [[Virtue is Knowledge]]. I will agree virtuous [[Self-Dialectic]]s require relating our cognition and affectation [[irwartfrr]]. Understanding comes in layers or filters, and to some extent, various parts are only necessary but insufficient. Further, the act of binding ourselves to [[The Moral Law]] may have a qualia to it, and complete understanding would include the action as well. Where doxa and praxis meet is a hard problem. 

<<<
"Then all things will be put under Him, that God may be all in all." We shouldn't merely understand each other, but act to transform each other to be better workers of Righteousness (neither of us are walking this path perfectly, though I think we're both trying - the goal of all meaningful communication is to orient one another towards that path , thus we get greater coherence (again why I appreciate the way you're writing 06.25, the points you contradict, you don't merely refute, but you're trying to get me to understand!)).
<<<

Preach, yo! That's the spirit of it. Thus, we //often// get greater coherence. Sometimes, we can't or ought not in some respects. Some people consider this paternalism, but it turns out that we can't escape having to privately reason on behalf of others to some [[dok]]. Respecting the dignity of [[The Other]] is not an easy problem here.

I aim to be useful to you. I'm being redundant, but it must be said. I'm a rude manfool who believes pervasive degenerative evil and moral entropy tend to be the status quo. I've been told I suck out all the [[hope]]-oxygen in the room. Like, holy shit, I'm a skeptical nitpicking reaper slowly swallowing and infecting people with his heartless contagion. Everyone in my life needs to take a break from me (including me). I'm the opposite of an eternal well; I'm a black hole of despair for many vessels (engage your warpdrives!). Some people do not merit their lives, but I do not want to damage you one iota without profound justification. I rely upon your judgment of whether or not I am fitting for you, especially insofar as I cast a withering gaze, be it public or private. Please, feel free (REALLY, REALLY) to tell me to STFU, ghost me, or run fo' yo life! 

<<<
So Death-Thought Association: I've heard social priming studies are on the rocks recently, but assuming there's something to this research...they suggest that threatening one's worldview will increase DTA. Have my death-cognitions increased since we started communicating?
<<<

Aye. I'm in no position to feel confident in that regard. This is just speculation for me.

<<<
You've been very gracious, but you are challenging me.
<<<

You are absurdly kind to wrestle with this insane autist. I know you take it to heart.

<<<
How about you since becoming a public mind?
<<<

I cannot say I fully understand what a public mind is. I am doing my best to help us construct one, and I want to be just another random signal in the music. I've been writing this wiki in the open for three years. Its publicness has morphed. Initially, only a handful of people knew about it. Eventually, [[FTO]] became an explicit {[[Axiom]]}, and I've gone out into the world on purpose. I have received threatening spam, and my paranoia is absurd; thoughts of death and persecution of myself and others come and go.

I don't know if and how my DTA has changed. I should though, right? I would argue my DTA has tended to be fairly high.

Incoherently, I would argue, now both [1] if all my obligations could be met in trade for my life, I would take it (part of me would be so relieved to end it today) and [2] yet I am so grateful+[[hope]]ful that I will have the opportunity live with [[others]] another day in what would otherwise be desolation. That ain't rational.

Relatedly, my anxiety is as high as ever, but my depression and suicidal ideation have tended to decrease. I'm still freaking out, but I think that is rational given what I see.

<<<
Has your wiki made you feel less alienated? More?
<<<

It depends. Am I allowed to say both yes and no, or both more and less? More gibberish for you. I don't feel like I'm alienating myself from myself so much anymore, but I'm more aware of being manically alien now more than ever. Part of my alienation is a result of how alienating I choose to be. I've joyously found a lot of aliens, too, but I am never delicate and diplomatic enough. 

It's not that I feel less alienated by those I'm so lucky to know, but I trust at least some people again (a grace I have no idea how to articulate yet). I feel more useful in general, and while there are usually oceanic gaps between me and my interlocutor, I've been able to construct more bridges than usual. My wiki is continual evidence that I lack relationship chops and the ability to be an effective human, among other things. 

<<<
> I know you would never treat prayer like you are just using some cosmic vending machine. It's serious. That practice has helped me habituate myself to talk about what matters most when I'm all alone or with others.

Let me share with you a cosmic vending machine story.

A few years ago, journée Saint Jean-Baptiste (public holiday), some friends from church wanted to have a picnic in the park. No one brought a frisbee (lame), so I left to go find one. A few blocks later on the main street I realized that most stores were closed; public holiday (doh!)...ALSO turns out that I'd left my wallet back at the park and had no way of buying one even if there were an open shop that was selling (double doh!).

So I zigzag my way back, hoping to find one in a dumpster or something. All the way, I'm praying to God for a frisbee. I don't normally pray frivolously, but at that time, I felt that praying for this frisbee was the right thing to do (and given what happened, I feel (post hoc) vindicated).

Now I give up checking out the alleys, and just walk straight back to the park, a heart full o' faith, and then, right in front of me, this lady walks out of her house with one of those large circle plastic sleds for children. It's the middle of summer, and she decides now to throw out a perfectly good saucer sled! I ask her if I could have it and she says yes. I walk back to the park a hero, we toss it around, and it flies like a comedically oversized dream. Bonus: It rained later that afternoon, and the 'frisbee' did double duty as an umbrella.

I'm not sharing this just to be contrary. I live in the conviction of the seriousness of prayer, and the immense abomination of plying Divinity for earthly gain. But I do want to broaden how you interpret my thoughts when I talk about God in relational terms. In a vacuum, an anecdote like that would be trite, or blasphemous, but in the context of a submitted life, it's wine from a water barrel.
<<<

I appreciate that. I didn't mean to do you injustice here. I didn't pack enough into what I said there, and I'm grateful for clarification (there's a good chance others would not have assumed it). I fully anticipate this kind of story; again, I grew up with it. I can appreciate the happiness which comes from small miracles, gratitude for mana, and even the notion that God has a sense of humor, playfulness, and would be personalized down into the tiniest details. I have been there. It's been no fun to come to believe those have been epistemic errors in my life. I don't know how many of my stories and patterns disintegrated.

<<<
Thank you for honouring what I hold sacred. I've re-read this letter a few times, but in addressing this paragraph, at this very moment, my heart and throat swell.

> What were you eating?
> When did you know you wanted to marry her?

Shish Taouk.

Not right away! I've been in delirious, jackhammer to the chest-love before, and this...wasn't immediately like that. Instead, everything feels just so right when I'm with her; when we're doing stuff together, or not doing stuff. Pictures in my head of Selah stooping, swinging her arms, tilting her head, pointing with her nose, my chest warms, she looks at me, and I wake up. But on our very first date, I remember thinking "She doesn't know what a podcast is? This can't go very far!" I don't know at what point I knew that I trusted her with the future; that I love her; (I feel my anemia) but I do, and she is happy to be with me, somehow, and I can only hang my head and be loved.
<<<

Anemia, roflmao. 

`/slaps-you-on-the-back`

Oh, no. Lol. You are killing me. I know I'm a cold-hearted autist, so bear with me (I am so awful at understanding another's humor). I don't hear anemia in that at all. I hear wisdom, [[love]], [[naked]]ness, perhaps paradoxically both openness and completion, humility, gratefulness, [[awe]], pragmatic idealism, a Body, and a home.

I respect your __joy__. 

Cosmic. Delicious. Uplifting. Fuck yeah. That's quite a place in the world you got there. That is a solid foundation for your [[faith]] in [[The Other]]. You are lucky, brother. I could only hope for the same for my son and daughter (keeps me up at night). You set the bar high, sir. It's not just [[beautiful]], it's [[right]]. I wish I could find better words; I wish everyone could see and experience what you do right there. I'm happy for you.

<<<
I find you an interesting and provocative person. Maybe 'like' isn't the right word? Though I have high moral expectations of others in general, I have difficulty not empathizing with the person before me, regardless of how far off the map I think they are. I may not be oriented alongside a person, but I actively dislike very few, even people I recognize as evil. SO, I like you, but my liking is not worth very much.
<<<

Fair enough. I take //like// to be something which isn't up to us directly or in the moment, but we can be responsible for it long-term. I might not like the taste of a food now, but perhaps in a few years I could. I think it also makes sense to say we like or dislike parts, not just wholes, of people to various [[dok]].

<<<
I admire you, which is rarer with me. I think I really started thinking positively of you a week or two after I started casually reading your wiki, I found a letter you'd written (to your sister? sister-in-law?) pleading with her to leave her job at a vampiric (redundant?) life insurance agency. I love that.
<<<

That was not an easy letter to write. It sucks knowing that my words will often destroy my relationship even if it is best for [[The Other]]. I'm grateful that you appreciate the letter to my cousin who is functionally my sister. This letter has cost me many, many times more than what that letter cost me, brother; I have left the chronological stack in the snapshots for you to see it too (if you do not already). I am writing my life with you as best I can, sir.

<<<
There are a handful of people in my life who are very strange, or intense, or violent, or whatever, who I absolutely make time for. I feel like I would upend my plans to spend time with you regularly. You sweat salience.
<<<

That is high praise. Thank you. I appreciate your epic patience with me; I am an expensive man to speak with (perhaps not worth your time). 

It is possible, btw, that I am moving closer to you in January. 

<<<
That said, forgive me if I'm hurtful here, I'm also half-expecting a reversal of affection at some point in our exchanges. Your letters have thus far been very complimentary of my character, but there are many things about me that are unlikeable. I have not yet resisted unto blood.
<<<

It's true. You are up way high on a pedestal. Affection is not the word I would choose: it's not enough. Respect is a far more accurate term, and sometimes that lacks affection. But, I am not a terribly affectionate person with most people, though even my affection is rough or disgusting. I tend to be a very serious man, especially in the threads you are picking out with me. It's crucial that I pick out what I find [[salient]] in you for us (and vice versa). I aim to be gentle to compensate for vices.

Carefully making your comments, honesty, and building your argument for the alien will go very far with me. It is very expensive for me to compute, which is why I ask for high-quality input. Bloodshed can be avoided by ceding ground wisely in epistemic wrestling. Thus far, [[Sphygmus]] has been the most careful interlocutor I've had; I feel the formality in her moves. I also want you to consider the differing responsibilities which might arise from our information asymmetry. You are still massively private in a way. Your skin is not in the game in the same way. Lower the privacy, a radical political [[power]], no doubt, and you will receive very different wrestling from me. 

I don't know if you've ever seen grapplers practice. There are times where you both throw everything you have, but sometimes when you are learning a technique or how to practically reason about a concept, you go very slowly. Otherwise, some of my moves look like mere ceremony. I'm glad you are ready to laugh at the punchline of who I am with you. 

<<<
My neighbour has become more erratic, and even creepy. Sometimes she will harass Selah and I with nonsense accusations "you're stealing my identity." "you're profiting off me." "you're a vampire." "you're a demon.", other times she'll just wordlessly follow me around. I'm probably not as worried for my safety as I should be (Selah visits frequently, but doesn't live with me), but we've recorded an encounter, which might be useful. The landlord wants to kick her out, but that would likely mean homelessness for her at this point, so I'm trying not to involve him too much before we can find a way to get her help.
<<<

That is not an easy situation. I'm grateful that you take her well-being into account so thoroughly. [[YWSOAM]], and I am confident those are nonsense accusations toward you; they are likely labels which at least figuratively fit some of the people in her life. How is she doing now? How are you all doing?

<<<
Btw, I find j3d1h's art really smile-inducing (not just because I find Undertale a lot of fun). I especially like her tribal wolf and vaporwave designs! Has she ever done longer form comics?

Undertale is a really big deal for her. It's a common jumping-off point for us into many topics. I'm glad she wrestles with it while finding ways to have fun. She's not done much comic work at all, and nothing longer-form.

Oh well. [[Call me up when it's time for the book tour!|2019.11.21 - DeathOfRobinhood: H0P3², you madman!]]

My attempt at an Anti-neo...plastic...um...:
<<<

I am grateful for how consistently careful you are with your words to me, and I hope to honor them. That is a great title for such a long letter which has taken me so long to write. 

Give me your number (or a key), and I will call you up (you won't be the first from this wiki). You'll have to let me know your preferences for being called. 

Of course, as with my letters, writing an [[Antineoplastic Analysis|Antipleonasm Analysis]] can be much easier than it looks, especially for someone who just shuffles words around as arrogantly as I do. I'm going to need to build a [[Hall of Fame]] for those who honor me as you have. I don't have enough people in my life who I trust to make fun of me in a loving way. You interpret the man who lost his marbles into his mouth, and he never seems to be able to pay you back in [[T42T]]. I am in tears beside myself with the gifts of [[The Other]]. Thank you. 

I am grateful for your kindness and [[naked]] honesty shrouded in quasi-jest; I am sorry about the asymmetry in my stupid brain (especially about what is in my control) and what appears to be some reptilian cold-blooded faith (I'm trying to make it justifiably warm). [[I am trying to listen|2019.11.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: 〚TM™〛]].

Sir【[[Kicks]]】the Stampeding<<ref "tri">> Librarian, like you, is a creative interpreter of [[Humanity]] and a foot-washer of great honor (the proof in the [[hyperconversation]] runs paranoically deep to my eyes<<ref "cr">>); I hope to become as filthy, lucid, humble, wise, and radically [[reconstructive]] in modeling and building the computational foundations, towers, and bridges of the City of God as you both do all the way into your virtuous affective sensibilities. Y'all write proofs to your autistic destructive-hordeling brother;<<ref "ree">> only a madman would spend time with a madman (and it takes becoming one to know one). Of your many signs, I blindly and brokenly see your worthy Wordwork.<<ref "gal">> Some people think [[faith]] is an entirely personal affair, but I know it is communal. Even though I can barely see any of your self-modeling, you are proof of the only commandments I [[hope]] to know.

I am so grateful to those of you who hold me by the shoulders, gaze into my twitchy eyes, forgivingly retell me (yet again) I'm your dipshit brother<<ref "mn">> whom you love, hug me as I cry with you, and continue leading me out of my caves and through the desert of this dying world. Despite similarities and analogies, it is a journey unlike any [[Other]]. I am your disabled brother who you (a man of [[faith]]) do not leave to rot and suffer alone in the dark. It must cost you a great deal to be CBT violent with me; I'm not a fun beast to tame. Sometimes I am ignorant, and sometimes I am maliciously ignorant. Thank you for quadratically spending yourself on me; I aim to stake the tentpegs of my life on your sacrifice.<<ref "rui">> 

Paranoically, even your multi-ordered and emergent masks are sincere in demonstrating [[W5H]] even the appearance of [[FO]] defections are [[SO]] cooperations. It is my honor to know your words are mutual scalpels, not unidirectional daggers. You perform surgery on me as though it were your own body; there is not a nick from you that doesn't [[golden-ruled]] cost you something in our dialectics. Thank you.

Lastly, thank you for generously weaving a Kintsukuroi vessel with me from my broken claypot over these many months. Despite working with a poor medium like myself, you shape art with your hands, potter.

[[Love]], your lost madman²,

[[h0p3]]

I'm putting my proverbial money where my mouth is when I write.

<<footnotes "gp" "It is ever clearer to me that [[The Golden Rule]] memeplex offered by Jesus Christ was so radically viral in his contexts because the ancients met face to face; their interaction was slower and more direct. The [[power]] structures of our world are designed to eliminate the opportunity for the suffering, the poor, and disenfranchized to force those who sin against them to look them in the eyes. Our perceptions and limbic systems are hijacked by a capitalist infrastructure, and hence the unforgivable is much easier to achieve. The letter of Christ's words is sometimes dead, though I seek the spirit of the law in a digital age he could never have foreseen. Marx has the same problem.

Make it your simple thing, like taking your pulse together. I can't tell you how often it is the highlight of my day, but the mountain ranges traversed in those walks are the real view. They are some of the most important memories and moves I have, sir.

Our internal mental states represent the external world. Which of those things in the external world are minds or thoughts in themselves? We can never be certain; this is one of the hard problems. More generally, why should we think our representations correspond to any world outside ourselves? This Cartesian problem has been handled in two ways. Berkeley bites the bullet and denies the external world, claiming there is only thought and thinking things. Saint Kant argues our representations are co-produced by our minds and the world, but he appears to think we can only ever directly attend to our [[phenomenology]]. Kant begins the destruction of metaphysics in the history of philosophy like none other.">>

I do not accept the evil which comes from this place, so, by all means, let your God speak for itself in this case. By all means, keep me in your thoughts and prayers. If I am wrong, however, and you feel it worth your apology, I warn you (yet again): you should have the humility to recognize the limits of your epistemic justification. Don't [[arrogant]]ly go down this path with me unless you are willing to pay the price. I will crucify you for this question, mystic.
