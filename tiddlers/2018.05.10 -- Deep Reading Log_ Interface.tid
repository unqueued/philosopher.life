I've only encountered some of Stephenson's work. This is an old one, and it is pulpy as all get out. I'm pleased to see how far ahead Stephenson saw, how realistic he makes it, and how fun it usually is. Stephenson is skilled at worldbuilding.

He spends a lot of time foreshadowing. It feels Manchurean Candidate-esque, but also kind of forced. It's pulp fiction though.
