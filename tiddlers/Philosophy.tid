//I will do my best to understand the nature of reality.//

One cannot [completely] refute what one has not ...[completely] understood.

Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible.

Philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom; it is the art of applied normative epistemology.<<ref "1">> I revere it. If persons had a telos, philosophy would be it. Even if they don't, I hope to make it my purpose anyways. 

I'm philosophical throughout this wiki, but the core philosophical treatises in my self-dialectic must wind up here. Here are the highlights of my wandering and tent-peg laying through the existential desert.

I believe it is the systematically correct way to pursue the truth of reality in one's context.

!! Principles:

* Be wise, empathic, charitable, paranoid, doubtful, and yet ever practical in laying down your tent pegs.
* Try to find and compile the story-lines in your self-dialectic. 
* Eventually work towards rigorous, academic pieces on topics. Until then, keep good notes.
* Use the wiki to help define terms and branch out. Wikify your systematic philosophy.
* Work on saying things simply and concisely. Write your wall-of-text, but then crystallize it.

<<footnotes "1" "Where 'art' is theory and 'applied' is practical...That is clearly only one step of many to providing a good definition. I'm, of course, fascinated by [[philosophy-ness|Definitions of Philosophy]], but I will never be able to satisfactorily define it here (if ever).">>

<<footnotes "2" "In additional to our family's library, my wife is an academic librarian, and I am a skilled pirate. We have access to everything. There are certain kinds of tools that are extra handy though, and perhaps there are collections I need to keep tabs on. I run the risk of just including everything (what isn't philosophical?), so I'm going to be as tidy as I can be.">>
