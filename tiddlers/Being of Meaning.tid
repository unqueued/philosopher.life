Since Being and [[The Good]] are separate, then there is a sense in which Being doesn't rely upon [[The Good]]. What it could be, however, cannot be known or somehow isn't meaningful outside [[The Good]]. We border upon the ineffable, the true contradiction, and the necessary paradox. This is that being of non-being, of becoming, and a host of ancient problems in metaphysics. It isn't up to us to solve this one. It is necessary that we cannot. 

However, we can attempt to make valuable inferences about it. Metaphysics is the highest art. Can we paint it faithfully? That is our quest as philosophers.

Chicken or Egg problem?


# Every meaning has a sufficient reason, cause, or origin. 
#* A meaning conceptually requires a language which describes, proves, computes, causes, and gives meaning to it.<<ref "gL">>

# There is objective meaning external to my mind for which I am not the sufficient reason.
#* There is computation external to me.
#* The world around us is computed, and that computation isn't reducible to us. 
#* Insufficiency does not rule out the possibility of my being a subsidiary mode, cog, component of, contributor to, element of, or perhaps even necessary cause or reason for this meaning to emerge.

# Therefore, there is a necessary self-sufficient reason, self-causing, self-interpreting, first-mover, first-computer, an objective and external locus of meaning.
#* Coherentist, monadic, rationalist, pantheistic, stoic traditions are a possibility. This makes the 

# There are contingent truths.
#* THIS IS THE BIG ONE. IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING NORMATIVITY AND NOT. THAT THIS WORLD OBTAINS AND NOT ANOTHER. OTHERWISE IT FLATTENS INTO NEUTRAL MEANINGLESSNESS, INTO MERE 'IS'.
#* Freedom obtains. How does a necessary thing cause contingent things?

When everythign is necessary and nothing is contingent, you have a collapse of normativity into a neutral "is," with no ought (moral or ethical). There is no "good," there just is what is. 

In the pascalian wager, and side which has infinite value/meaning, however improbable, will always the game-theoretically the best choice. That assumes that we ought to employ game-theory to answer the problem. It's pragmatist. It's egoist. It's eudaimonic-pursuing. It might be even be selfish. Is what we value therefore the deciding factor in whether or not we "ought" to elect to value game-theory for pursuing the pascalian wager.


It appears that the quantum vs. relativity gap is closed by metaphysics. We cannot have entropy or time without uncertainty, and that uncertainty is likely something outside of physics by definition.



I clearly must answer the problem(s) of Being of Non-Being and Being of Becoming. Are "events" the stuff of the world? I think so. There is algorithm+data-structure. Neither have meaning or being without the other.


Language users are recursively comprehending meaning properties. As a computer, I'm a unit of hardware that processes software representations, meanings. The rationalists are guaranteed to be right about having innate knowledge to some degree; we couldn't be computers otherwise. Empiricists can make sense of input very nicely, of course.


The principle of sufficient reason is the most plausible, the de facto until we have better reason.

Chicken or egg problem for meaning and language. What is the sufficient reason for the infinigress? Itself. Or if another infinigress of infinigresses, then that self. Data and Algorithm chicken or egg?

The possibility of possibility. The possibility of contingency is the question. DOes it make sense to say "possible"?

The world is free to be or not be in a particular way...

If you believe there is more than one substance, then you believe the dialectic is real and not simply some virtualization inside a monadic all-encompassing world-spirit.


will still need a metafoundation. There is no reason not to bite the infinigress bullet in some sense. Turtles all the way down. If you don't have faith in a foundation, the chain of falls apart. You assume it is there to read this sentence and believe it is truly meaningful [[adok]].


I am not the sufficient reason, cause, or origin of all meaning, even if I necessarily play an inescapable role in interpreting and manufacturing meaning for myself. I am neither the initial cause of my Daseinic consciousness nor that to which my consciousness attends. My consciousness, or the mind-processes from which it epiphenomenally arises,<<ref "om">> innately imposes rationalist categories and top-down models in/upon my perceptions of meaning. These are the necessary preconditions and assumed axioms to my awareness, i.e. the bottom-up inductive empirical investigations of my sense perceptions. 

Justified belief is the result of recursive non-concious bootstrapping between my basic percepts (the result of perceptual organs) and models (perceptual  (to which I am my perceptual abilities, generating more accurate Bayesians

training

Despite the necessity of subjectivity in interpretation, there obtains objective meaning externally given and ungiven to my consciousness. The external world is filled with objects and corresponding meanings which are not reducible to mere constructions in my own mind. I subscribe to a prejudiced<<ref "pj">> variant of object-oriented ontology in which computational correpondentist meaning obtains in a physical<<ref "pu">> universe through a plurality of meaning properties.<<ref "mp">>

[[Meaning]] is an information property of an object of any degree or kind ([[adok]]) for which it is logically possible for at least some hypothetical language user of adok to interact with or interpret in adok.<<ref "md">> Objects are particular substances, properties, or processes<<ref "ps">> of adok. Properties are instatiated in substances, processes, or other properties.<<ref "po">>

Language users are computers in adok; they need not be conscious in the slightest. Even billiard balls striking each other transfer, interpret, and interact with information properties of each other. Thus, it is quite unclear what doesn't count as a language user on my account. Thus I am to maximally inclusive definitions of minds and meaning without defining Daseinic consciousness thus far. Predicates attached to subjects to adok have meanings. Causality and change, in adok, are processes which have meaning. Truth, in adok, is a meaning, a necessary relationship among meanings.<<ref "nr">> 

All intelligible objects (of adok) possess a meaning property, by definition. Even stringently bracketed phenomenology must assume meaning is embedded in anything to which our consciousness attends. For something to be a thing is to already claim it is intelligible to some degree, thus it possesses a meaning property. Hence, whether we are aware of it or not, meaning is embedded in everything.<<ref "nb">>

Meaning is computational; there is no meaning which isn't computable to some degree. Computability is an essential property for meaning; it is necessary for meaning to be interpreted, perceived, experienced, understood, processed, cognized, or instantiated.

The physical universe is an object composed of physical substance. The physical universe is the object which includes and reductively emerges  from at least other physical objects. 



Cybernetic axiom: The purpose of a system is what it does (POSIWID)

Form < Function ? Both are parasitically necessary to each other, but function is what gives form meaning. Form is a medium of functional expression. Form is mere subtrate. Form gives Function Being, Function gives Form Meaning.

Perhaps we start with two things: Mind and matter (where matter need not be materialistic, rather it has meaning). It is the changer, interpret, thing that brings into being, and the data structure itself. But, there must be something above that exchange/event/activity which enables it to be that way. The principle of sufficient reason takes us into eternity.
