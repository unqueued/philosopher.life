As an autistic man, I have a hard time knowing when someone is being sarcastic, deceptive, etc. I often do not understand conversational implicature, and instead I rely upon standard logical translations (there's a good study on this issue, also, hello Grice!). Am I to doubt one of my root users at this point?

> h0p3: I care a good deal about my versioning (it's part of what makes my wiki what it is, imho). It's fairly common for me to go back in time to see what the original tiddler or structures in my wiki were.

Question: do you use an EXTRA "system"? Or do you do that some solo method?

No idea. Other than your own.

I'd never want to get between a user and their horcrux. 

Backups are fine. We talking here about VERSIONING--i.e. systems that help optimise the relation of now and then.

Absolutely not. You are spot on my miscreant mis-drift on not understanding your versioning that is preservation of a new universe.

Lol. I can't tell if he's joking or not. I hate to say it, but that doesn't sound charitable. My argument seems reasonable (even another user referred to their use of git for versioning). I'm preserving my identity, not a new universe. I'm not an internalist. It's important to note that Josiah has not effectively responded to my last few letters. Lots of signals here. It's time for a [[T42T]] investigation.

[[k0sh3k]] and [[JRE]] will decide since they pull rank.
