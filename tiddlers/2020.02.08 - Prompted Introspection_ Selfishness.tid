title: 2020.02.08 - Prompted Introspection: Selfishness

!! Which quality do you dislike most about yourself–laziness, selfishness, childishness–and why?

I'm having a hard time peeling those apart. They all seem connected to the same problem at the first glance. Insofar as childishness is a negative trait, I take it to be a kind of immaturity that can't be morally justified, an existential laziness, and certainly a selfishness. Selfishness is the core to me of these three, so that's my choice. There are some cases and [[dok]] of selfishness which are not up to me, and I can dislike those, but that which is up to me is something I despise.
