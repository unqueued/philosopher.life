[11:32 AM] h0p3: How's it hanging, sir?
[11:34 AM] Ardent_Assailant: It's going! Working on tomorrow's session :slight_smile:
[11:34 AM] Ardent_Assailant: How are you feeling today?
[11:35 AM] h0p3: I'm here, coughing and snotting, but aware and present. Happy to be here. Not being as productive as I'd like. Hope to fix that.
[11:37 AM] Ardent_Assailant: That sucks. Gotta hold out for insurance hahaha. Got any weekend plans?
[11:37 AM] h0p3: Hopefully, doing the DMV stuff.
[11:37 AM] h0p3: Finishing off our room with my wife.
[11:37 AM] h0p3: Maybe a date!
[11:37 AM] h0p3: and, Family Time, ofc
[11:38 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Nice! You both deserve to treat yourselves :slight_smile:
[11:38 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Family Time is good time
[11:38 AM] h0p3: How about you? What are your plans for the weekend?
[11:41 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Taking my brother and his family to a ramen place tonight and dnd tomorrow. Going to be busy but good
[12:09 PM] h0p3: Sounds very pleasant
[12:09 PM] h0p3: how is he doing?
[12:10 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Bouncing between jobs. Hopefully things are looking up soon.

[3:24 PM] h0p3: You have a good time with your bro and his fam?
[3:31 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I did! The weekend was... busy but relaxing.
[3:31 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’ve started nasal spray and Prilosec to try to figure out my throat problems. It’s going ok so far.
[3:31 PM] Ardent_Assailant: How are you all doing? Family Time tonight. :slight_smile:
[3:33 PM] h0p3: Hopefully, you'll have some good veg-out time too.
[3:34 PM] h0p3: When I can get to the doctors, I may be on the same warpath with you to solve my allergies (TN wasn't bad, but this place is absurd for me).
[3:34 PM] h0p3: We're doing well. Lots to talk about during family time. We're working together on our computers in the living room atm.
[3:35 PM] h0p3: I'm grateful to have a living room which is functioning. Furniture is outstanding.
[3:35 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Fingers crossed they can get you some good stuff. I’m taking so much shit right now. But my nose feels amazing.
[3:36 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Nice! Do you feel like you all have plenty of space?
[3:36 PM] h0p3: It's too much house for my taste.
[3:36 PM] h0p3: But, we are enjoying the space.
[3:36 PM] h0p3: At some point, I can't morally justify having more space.
[3:37 PM] h0p3: Will see if we can put it to good use for the strangers among us though.
[3:39 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I feel that. I never want to live in a giant house.
[3:39 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It’s too much to clean. :wink:
[3:39 PM] Ardent_Assailant: A place for guests is good tho
[3:40 PM] h0p3: Perhaps, if it is used wisely.
[3:40 PM] h0p3: It's pleasant to have, but that is not my goal.
[3:42 PM] Ardent_Assailant: We’re having a super lazy day today. Normally we would go grocery shopping but we kinda did a few days back? Gonna try to make it on what we have to save some money haha.
[3:43 PM] h0p3: Fuck yeah
[3:43 PM] h0p3: I love that game of seeing how long we can wait.
[3:43 PM] Ardent_Assailant: [[L]] is making something out of old jeans. She said she wanted to make a quilt, but she cut them I to strips and now is braiding them, so I’m too afraid to ask what she’s making now. :joy:
[3:44 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Me too. We have plenty of stuff, but only really one meal to cook, but we have leftovers too so we might be good.
[3:44 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I need to do laundry myself and probably the dishes at some point.
[3:44 PM] h0p3: I hear that.
[3:45 PM] h0p3: Been working on my laundry workflow as well.
