So, out of curiosity, I've been watching point and standing fluctuations. They either are feeding us misleading data or are modifying it (my bet is the latter). I didn't go into this with high hopes (especially since it looks like some neoliberal/libertarian bullshit). Perhaps my opinion/bias is being confirmed? Anyways, I'm still curious, and that's really why I'm still participating. This will be the last day I do though likely. I can see it's not my ratrace.
