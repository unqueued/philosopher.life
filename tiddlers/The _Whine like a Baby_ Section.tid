title: The "Whine like a Baby" Section

I see this as our primary conflict:

I think I have more empathy for you than you have for me.

I'm tired of bearing a load for you that you aren't willing to bear for me.

That isn't to say you are even capable of bearing the load (I recognize the raw appearance of arrogance in that sentence). I have had absurd opportunities you have never had. I've won a couple genetic and circumstantial lotteries (moral luck) that you haven't. 

You really have done well with what you have been given. 

I very much have taken your reality map seriously. Even when I thought I saw flaws in it, I have tried to plug those holes for you. There are no more doors open for me to make your point of view logically work in my head. It's done.



If you feel like you've been lied to by your sons, you have. We really haven't had the chance to just be ourselves without judgment from you. You make our lives painful when you get to know us. We don't like sharing who we are with you. Now, do you really think that's because you so blameless and we so evil 


It breaks a tit-for-tat strategy.

If relationships are like bank accounts,



I can't help but worry that you simply see me and our relationship through a lens of biblical stories of children and parents (particularly sons of the priest class, and those who turn away). I think of Cain and Abel, of Samuel, of Jacob and Esau, of Eli's wicked sons, of the prodigal son, and of Adam, Christ, and God the Father.

This was the lens that I saw the world through. It is not anymore. I am convinced this is a problem for us. I worry we can't find bridges over this problem. 

I think you have an empathy problem. 

I think you have an easy time empathizing with children, but that you fail to empathize as effectively with adults (and I'm not exception to this). This may be based upon your view of agency and responsibility. This may be influenced by your childhoods. This may be based upon biblical interpretations of humanity. This may be based upon a growing disillusionment with the adult's you've met in your ministry. This may be for a multitude of reasons. 

I think you've missed the point of who I am.

I want you to be proud, in an odd way, of the fact that I took seriously and zealously sought after what I considered to be most important in the bible: love, empathy, and rationality (to be like Christ), and I ended up at a different destination than you. I want you to see I applied those principles, and my reality map changed because of it. I took the redpill, and this is the world I see now. It's not up to me what is revealed to me. It's not my fault that I'm not a Christian anymore. 

I still care about love, empathy, and rationality. They drive me. They are my goal. We have disagreements about which paths best arrive at that goal. 

You could throw us away. You might. In some ways, you have. I'm not blaming you for it anymore. I'm not trying to judge you. I'm trying to move past it. I know [[you did the best you could with what you have|Doing our Best]]. Can you do the same for me? Can you not not blame me, judge me, and move past it?

What kind of relationship do you want with me? Can we really have one?


I simply can't have the relationship with you that you have with your parents.

I think when we meet it feels like a yearly inspection. You have no idea what I've gone through.

You have abandoned your children. I see why. Some part of me has even internalized and accepted it. I know you did your best. 



I fear that you will see my asking for empathy and understanding of my reality map as demanding that you revolve around me. I don't know what to say to that. If you want to miss out on a huge portion of who I am and who I will be, that's really up to you. You don't have to revolve around me. But, if we are being fair here, my life has revolved around yours quite a bit. In fact, I believe there is an asymmetry in our relationship in which I'm the one who has revolved around you and not the other way around.

You chose to live across the globe, to have your way of living. It was not up to me. 



I don't think children are beholden to their parents in the way that you do. I think the Biblical story on this is not rational (the justification for your belief does not extend into the secular realm). I think parents have strong duties to their children, but it is not obvious that children necessarily have the same strength of duties to their parents. 


I think you are struggling with your relationships with your parents too. I feel like that requires me to give you more latitude. 


I am convinced [[the end of humanity|The End of Humanity]] is coming in the next century. I hold us all responsible for it to varying degrees. I'm angry at everyone for it, including you. I think you have an optimistic, blind faith view on the world. Your lack of urgency over the bigger picture, your defense of the contemporary Christian community in the United States, your libertarian-bents, your acceptance of capitalism and study of humans as resources...I think you are part of the problem and not the solution. I think it your generation that has sealed our fate. I think that millenials are called the "ME" generation, but I think the Boomer's perfected that art long ago. I think your switch from the idealism you had when I was a child to your pragmatism today lacks integrity.


That I care about your approval and you don't of mine shows a lack of empathy. You don't care what I think, and you should.


I worry you make the mistake of assuming that any reality map which doesn't enable one to have hope, happiness, or take on pursuits that your reality map justifies is somehow wrong.


I try not to be angry though. I try not to blame you. I think you were and still are people who feel called by God. I know what that means, and I know what that feels like. I can forgive that.
