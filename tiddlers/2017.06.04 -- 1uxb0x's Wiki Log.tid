* I love your "new" tab.
* Your "Writing Log" needs to use periods, not commas. Use correct syntax, please.
* You've made significant improvements to the catalog structure of your wiki. Good job.
* Continue writing your magic decks down. Use Cockatrice formatting. Keep up with that beautiful function-based organization.
* Create structure and paragraphs in your About section. It's a great start. 
* Don't forget your Blessings Logs.
