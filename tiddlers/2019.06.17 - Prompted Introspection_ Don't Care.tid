title: 2019.06.17 - Prompted Introspection: Don't Care

!! If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be?

I'm so tired of being asked what I virtually unconditionally want. It's a waste of my energy, it's incommensurable with being moral in most cases, I can't compromise it in such a way that it is meaningfully actionable or reveals something important about my life which I've not already iterated a million times over. I don't mind playful questions, but the world is grim to me. This is not the drug I need in my life.
