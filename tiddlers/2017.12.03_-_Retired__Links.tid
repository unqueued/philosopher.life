I spend a considerable amount of time on the web, and I have since I was a tween.<<ref "1">> I have not been as systematic about it as I should have been.<<ref "2">> Perhaps I should comb through my old interwebs accounts for more context, links, etc. as well. There is history there.

I have the unenviable task of going through thousands of bookmarks collected over a decade. I'm not quite sure how I want to systematically tackle them. I would like to eventually just house it all here. This is my new computing home, right? Lol.

Let me tell you, I am very nervous about this project. I do not know if I will be able to do the kind of work I want to do with it. The easy part is sorting stuff, and the hard part will be digesting it. I will simply do my best though. What else can I do? The silver lining is that I have more control over it. Categorization, tagging, and flexibility may give me the power to build something that I simply can't do in a standard web browser.
