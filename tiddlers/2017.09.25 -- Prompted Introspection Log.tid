!! Do you get enough sleep?

I get the least amount of sleep on days after DCK. I have a rough time on the weekends in general, particularly when I'm trying to pack everything I want into them. During the weekdays, I feel like I generally get enough. 7.5 hours is about right for me, I believe. Anything beyond that feels like "oversleeping," which I take to be a form of drug use. I don't have a problem with it, but I also don't feel the need for it.
