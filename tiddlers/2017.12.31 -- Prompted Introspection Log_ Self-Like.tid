title: 2017.12.31 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Self-Like

!! What quality do you like about yourself–creativity, personality, appearance–why?

I assume this question requires that I answer one of those three qualities. Perhaps you want them ranked? 

I'm not quite sure how best to define these concepts. I think there are kernels underneath the hood, but they can also be conceptually entangled. 

Creativity seems to be an expression of raw intelligence in a practice. Personality seems to be an expression of your dispositions, the identifying touch.  Appearance seems to be an expression of what you want others to see. But, creativity is an expression of your dispositions, and appearance has personality, etc. 

I think appearance can have aesthetic, creative values even when you live alone on an island. However, for the most part, appearance is a redpilled behavior. This tells us about one's personality, of course. It tells us about not only what one hopes to project, but even about who the project is to some extent. Appearance is useful for manipulation, even if only in manipulating ourselves.

Is there a difference between personal identity and personality? Insofar as there is, it seems like personality might itself be appearance generated from creativity. We, of course, are collections of narratives we tell ourselves. Personality might just be another gateway to consciousness in that sense.

Creativity is necessary for The Good and The Right, perhaps moreso than the others in a way. I suppose I choose it.

This is a messy, terrible argument. Importantly, I've also not talked about "myself" directly enough. I suppose creativity is still the right answer, but I wouldn't say I'm good at it.
