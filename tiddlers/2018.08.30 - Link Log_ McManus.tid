*** Interesting edit, and the paper doesn't mention socialism directly enough.

*** Deep history of anti-intellectualism.

*** I adore the word "flattened" as a phenomenologist seeking salience. There are some excellent moves in this article.

*** And AI will be in a good place to capitalize

* Think About It

*** Sounds like function nesting and dialectics.

*** I think you don't assign blame effectively enough nor understand our responsibilities, but I can agree to this claim. Humanities, engage! Hard to build good philosophers.

*** I'm annoyed by those obsessed with their vehicles (I don't mean gratefulness or those who fix their own cars). I think automation here will ultimately increase the class divide. It costs you 1000 bucks to kill someone in Thailand. The wealthy really don't give a shit about you; it's just a fine. The standard ethical computation problems arise, and you bet your ass injustice will prevail in capitalism.

*** And, yet, I continually find the *NTJ crowd has something going on. Is this really bias? I've run into so many times, I'm not sure what to do, bro?
** https://www.jcu.edu.au/news/releases/2018/august/the-god-of-small-things
*** My problem is that these confabulation lead to a bias that can be conveniently molded to whatever selfish ends they pickup for themselves. I buy that the details of life have moral values and processes embedded/attached to them, but I just don't see why their faith is more justified than mine.

*** And, yet, you have not discussed the fundamental decentralization at hardware and software levels. If you can't say that, you don't mean it.

*** And, yet, you don't really take up the leftist position. This is lipservice.

*** These creatures are worth your time. I'm continually amazed by them. Gross, yes. They are truly special mammals.
