title: 2018.07.06 -- Self-Dialectic: The Good, Right, and Beautiful

Perhaps the fundamental dialectic is [[The Good]] as sublator found between [[The Right]] and [[The Beautiful]], insofar as they conflict. It's messy and probably the wrong model still. There is something to say about Kierkegaard's aesthetic, ethical, and religious existential modes/attitudes/stances which must be unified, likely through dialectic.

Tiddlywiki is great because I don't have to build it all at once. It lends a flexibility to my describing semantics to myself that I didn't already have by enabling as ambiguous a syntactic specification as I need for a context necessary for first trying to initially cognize what I didn't know, bracketing in doubt enough to be able to make the representation something I can inspect [[SO]]ed for the dialectical sublation process. This is how I get to modify my belief structures, and the Tiddlywiki gives me a graphically (barely functioning, highly fallible mirror) usable functional mapping spider to crawl around and modify myself. Tiddlywiki allows me not have to fill in the gaps until I'm ready, and it allows me to bend over backwards to refactor my perceptions. The Tiddlywiki allows me to be more [[SO]]ed about myself in a way that nothing else could.

I get to think creatively and stupidly...for example, here's a functional compututional theory of mind wiki theory, just an idea:

Up and down scrolling

Take the 3-symbol (blank, 0, 1) turing machine. Perhaps, on some model, each tiddler on the story river I'm perceiving is a memory unit on the Turing machine tape. Functions add up to "show" me a blank, 0, or a 1. I'm running along each tiddler trying to perform the instructions I'm giving myself, jumping along the tape of my story river, modifying the tiddlers to eventually say "blank, 0, or 1." The functions inside the tiddler (with reference to the tiddlers it connects to like a neuron) resolve to some name (down to an individual constant) in the logical semantic domain. Each tiddler will present to me (whether I'm conscious of it or, and generally not) a program that I run that fulfills the syntactic trivalance (dialectics with a sublator) reduced to semantic bivalence (contained in the 0's and 1's, but not the blank, dialectics without the sublator). Basically, each tiddler is a function that producers a semantic "blank, 0, or 1" result for me in the story river Turing tape.

Obviously, I'm engaged in reasoning other than this, but there's something to it that seems quite right to me. That's probably gibberish to most people. In time, I can unroll it, unpack it, and attempt to reason about what's right or wrong about the idea, be it this example or some other.
