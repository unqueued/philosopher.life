title: Rules: Alerting

* Alerts should be urgent, important, actionable, real, and represent either ongoing or imminent problems.
* Err on the side of removing noisy alerts.
* You should almost always be able to classify the problem.
* Symptoms are a better way to capture more problems more comprehensively and robustly with less effort.
** Include cause-based information in symptom-based descriptions, but avoid alerting directly on causes.
