title: 2019.04.15 - Prompted Introspection: The Table

!! What kinds of activities when on at the kitchen table at home when you grew up (eating doesn't count)?

The primary use of the table when we weren't eating was having a place to put stuff. The putting and taking of stuff on and off the table in and for various combinations and reasons was the highlight of my non-eating-based usage of the table. 

My brother and I often circled the table while talking, and sometimes our hands would glide on it.
