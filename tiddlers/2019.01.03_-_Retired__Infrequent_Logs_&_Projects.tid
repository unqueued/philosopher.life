title: 2019.01.03 - Retired: Infrequent Logs & Projects

!! About:

//A bottomless bag to catch the [[/b/]]ishness of established logs and projects. I'm not committed to vaulting these yet, thus here they accumulate in limbo.//

Logs come into and go out of {[[Focus]]} fairly often. Even the contents of the Daily Core Requirement are modified often enough. I suspect it always will change (which is good, right?). There is a prioritized stack, essentially. I need a place to house logs that are used infrequently, but not dead. Vaults are for dead things. These aren't dead; they are simply dormant until I need them.

!! Principles:

* Keep logs you use infrequently here.
* You are free to host links to these logs in multiple directories, however, Frequent Logs belong in Focus of {[[Focus]]} and not here, and vice versa for infrequent logs.
** If you use a log frequently, then move it to Focus of {[[Focus]]}.
** You gotta keep 'em separated.^^tm^^
