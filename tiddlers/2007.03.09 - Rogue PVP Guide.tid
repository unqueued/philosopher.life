title: 2007.03.09 - Rogue PVP Guide

Every rogue, regardless of gear, can excel in PvP and dueling (some more than others), and I hope to demonstrate that fact with this strategy guide. The guide is not written for the most well-equipped rogue in the world. I’m not expecting anyone to have 10k hp with 300 resilience. You should be breaking a basic 7.5-8k hp though, and you should be attempting to bring HP (and resilience) as high as possible without incurring massive opportunity costs in the AP/Crit/Hit department. Your gear doesn’t necessarily reflect the quality of your playskill, and the rogue class, fortuitously, can be quite fruitful simply through tactful play because we are not as gear reliant, to some extent, as other classes.

Why write to the average rogue?

Simply because it is the average rogue who has the most to gain from strategic play. While the extremely well equipped can win in virtue of their gear, rather than their skill, the average rogue is relies upon themselves a lot more than their gear to defeat opponent. The average rogue is not well equipped. But, as I said, the rogue class is quite linear, which is tied to our innate abilities (although we scale with gear to some extent, we aren’t as proportionally reliant upon our gear as other classes). A rogue can do well even without great gear; we simply become that much stronger with each item and buff we use to enhance ourselves (conversely, we become proportionally weaker as gear inflates). In any case, we can still be useful without full epics, but a rogue in full epics is very capable of winning matches without playing correctly.

Admittedly, I’m tired of gear doing most of the work for people (their time played does not equate to skill or justification for a win condition)–I want to see what you can do without that gear (thankfully TBC gave us some opportunity for this). Although we are already seeing a divergence in itemization as spread across the population, even properly used green gear can allow you to compete with those in full epics. If you are still wearing greens and blues, then you will have a lot to gain from following some of the steps I’ve outlined. As for the full epic rogues taking on people in greens/blues, that really doesn’t show skill, nor does it require the same degree of tactics in most cases. The guide isn’t for you if you simply outgear your opponents to an extent that playing correctly doesn’t matter. The test of a well played rogue is best found when he takes on skilled players with greater gear than him, winning even when the odds are actually against him. Eventually, every person will meet their match, and it is at that point that your choices and tactics matter the most. So, even full epic rogues may want to pay attention.

Essentially, to some rogues who either outgear their opponent completely or fight stupid opponents, going “all-out” so to speak, and maximizing the potential of their character isn’t necessary. That’s fine. You can always scale your efforts back. But, this does not negate the need to know howto make the most of your character when the time comes that you meet an opponent(s) who is just as (or even more) skilled and/or equipped than you. Making the most of your character is the point of this guide, not “how to defeat noobies”. I will be describing “all-out” strategies, but I will certainly admit that against most opponents you won’t need to go “all-out”.

I’ve detailed fights assuming pretty basic gear so that all rogues can make use of it. I’ll treat each opponent as hostile and as a maximally problematic to our situation as possible, generating a strategy that is designed to defeat an opponent when the odds are least in your favor and you wish to win by the largest margin possible. The tactics outlined are good enough that you can win the majority of fights outside of IF or Org with a level 1 dagger (seriously, go try it out); you can win in spite of your gear rather than in virtue of your gear. Having gear simply means that the fights are that much easier for you. This means that most of your fights will never require this much work. Good for you! This doesn’t diminish the point of the guide though, you’ll still meet people who will require every once of your ability.

Why play to maximize your character’s potential?

Play to win. It is pretty simple. This doesn’t mean you can’t brainfart or dink around. But, when you are serious about playing, you are playing to win. And, in the end, the winners will be those who maximized their character’s potential. If you are playing to win, then you are going to make choices that give you the best chance of winning, often by the largest margin.

For the rogue, this issue of winning without using the strategy with highest probability of winning often comes up into play in consideration of the use of cooldowns. Not using cooldowns means you aren’t maximizing your characters potential. If you have a problem with using cooldowns at all (i.e. playing your class to its best), then this guide isn’t for you. Generally, almost every fight against a skilled player in equal gear requires the use of CD’s for the rogue. Rogues that brag they don’t need CDs to win either completely outgear their opponents or simply fight stupid opponents. While I’m not saying you’ll use all of your CD’s in each fight, it is a fact of life as a rogue that we’ll be using our CD’s not just to overcome gear inequalities or higher quantities of opponents, but also to beat well-played classes with even comparable gear to yours. Using those CD’s and specific builds to their maximum efficiency is a concern though. This guide assumes you don’t have a problem using CDs. Hopefully, with the trains of thought presented, you’ll be in a position to tailor your playstyle and tactics to your particular opponent(s).

Lastly, this guide is more than just useful in the context of duels, it is useful for pretty much all PvP situations. Even if I only layed the groundwork in a 1v1 context, the contents of the guide are applicable to all PvP contexts. The fact is: you simply can’t be a good PvPer without being a good duelist. And, yes, I know, I know, it has long been the opinion of Blizzard and of many WoW players that “PvP is not based or balanced around 1v1 matchups”. This is a myth, and something fabricated by people too lazy to do the math. This concept just shows the incompetence of Blizzard devs and the masses that blindly accept the garbage fed to them. All encounters are based upon the 1v1 matchups. The very equation used to understand how and why people win in any encounter requires a clear analysis of all individuals’ offense/defense ratios in relation to their opponents’, specifically an evaluation of the 1v1 matchups, including the metagame that proceeds from the initial 1v1 rulesets. The following guide is an insight into the rogue classes 1v1 matchups directly, but it also demonstrates the required thought process to be an effective PvPer in any circumstance, including world PvP, group PvP, BG’s and arenas. To those who disagree, then I ask you to go no further. You need context to begin playing your rogue to his fullest potential, so please read these first:

Back to Basics:

Slightly dated, it still remains true in many respects. Most importantly, the principles are fundamental to understanding MMO gaming. Luckily, the context is in regards to the rogue class itself. Here you’ll see the math behind why PvP –must- be balanced around 1v1.

Form of Gaming:
http://www.hypercynic.com/?p=8

A good starting place for those who need to know what a game really is in the first place, why players make decisions they do and how they make them. It is a defense of underlying claims made thus far.

Hopefully, these will give you some context as to why we must be concerned with our 1v1 matchups.

Moving on, for the dueling guide, I’ll be assuming 30/0/31 or 23/3/35. These specs are really made for 1v1 fights and expending a great deal of resources in a short deal of time to briefly bring our offense/defense ratios to a very high level. Assuming you are serious about dueling, or even PvP in general, you’ll want to consider these specs above all others…with that said, you can easily adapt the tactics to whatever your build may be using. I’ve seen plenty of rogues do fine in general play with mutilate or combat. But, without question, these are not dueling speccs, and they are hard pressed to be the most viable PvP speccs until we hit the very organized group PvP scene where sustained damage becomes a large factor.
30/0/31-Daggers

The premier dagger PvP spec, it is extremely well-rounded in a PvP context; think of it as the new 21/8/22. It has the highest burst damage in the game. MoSub + Serrated Blades + Imp Eviscerate for a Premed-Ambush (usually crit)-CB-Eviscerate means a rogue can nearly two shot a poorly-equipped player and puts serious pressure on all casters. While it can burst very well, it can also stunlock quite effectively. High crit rating abuses SF quite well. You’ll need an excellent MH dagger.

Feel free to pickup hemo on your way to 31 in sub. You can weaponswap (even during combat). I suggest this, as stunlocking is still best done with a sword (and it always will be). A rogue that isn’t weaponswapping really isn’t using this build to its fullest potential. Once you get used to it, it will be very easy for you.

Example Stunlocks:

Sword (or alike)= CS-H-G-KS-H-H
Dagger=CS-BS-KS-BS
Combination (using weaponswap)=CS-H-G-Swap to dagger-KS-BS-BS

Example Burst:

Premed-Ambush-CB-Evisc

With relentless and 4-piece assassination, you can probably BS at the very end of that burst most of the time.

This is a versatile spec with arguably the highest possible combo point generation available within a very short time frame. It can burst or stunlock, dagger or sword…it has options. You’ll miss imp gouge, but the SF gains are well worth it for those who can break 20% crit.
23/3/35-Hemo

Even with only 2.6 and 2.7 speed weapons available, this is still a viable spec. I remain convinced hemo is still the best dueling spec available. It has the most robust control, solid damage, and is guaranteed to have all the PvP sub talents (unlike dagger-sub specs). Stunlocking is not only viable, but necessary. Bursting down opponents in duels, with zero regard for control, has become a thing of the past. Burst DPS is still very important, but control has become more and more a central theme of rogue PvP and is the very center of the rogue duel (hemo has both burst and control). While dagger specs are extremely powerful, they do lack the ultimate control of a hemo build. And, as we see itemization scaling up yet again, hemo will become better and better. Where rogues can currently afford to not control a fight from start to finish, allowing gaps and what not, eventually non-linear classes that scale even better with gear than the rogue will become powerful enough that heavy CD’s and stronger control will become necessary. At any gear level, hemo has it where it counts for dueling. Excluding the mage matchup, where other builds fail in a duel, this one will win.

Beyond HP, concentration on AP and +hit is vital. Your crit rating, while important, means far less to you than making sure every special hits and that you can abuse the anormalized Hemo/GS hit. For Pete’s sake, be sure to macro GS/Hemo on the same key. Arguments about saving GS (in PvP) for the dodge is nearly irrelevant in all cases. You want the damage now, and you want 25% more damage than hemo for 5e whenever you can get it.

Example Stunlocks:

CS-GS-G-KS-H-H

From here you have 65e to use. Blind, gouge-Evisc, or Hemo are all acceptable in different situations. It is the second strongest no-CD stunlock. It is also quite adapatable, CS-H-H-KS or with 4x Assassination set CS-H-H-Eviscerate are good as well.

Example Burst:

Premed-CS-(check for 5 points, H/GS if it isn’t at 5)-CB-Evisc-H-

From here, you can gouge or hemo, and then follow with KS, blind, just follow through on the beatdown, or if you timed it well, gouge-restealth. Remember that the server checks OOC on each energy tick, and it takes 2 ticks before you can OOC, so gouging right before an energy tick (and you have 3 usually with imp gouge) can buy you a restealth before the end of gouge.

Combat Mace/Sword/Fist (huge variances 11+/31+/0+ requisite):

So far considered the highest potential damage per minute available. This sports some crazy good non-stealth based damage. What makes combat really viable in PvP beyond the sheer damage: imp kick, imp sprint, SA, BF, and AR. The loss of prep is combated (haha) by improvements to kick and sprint. In my opinion, mace rogues utilize this tree the best in PvP, as the best combat weapons available are hasted maces, and the stun proc is very relevant; even if the stun procs require adaptation, they can do some amazing things in PvP. Combat fists should not be overlooked either, it is consistent damage.

Learning howto create and identify situations in which it is most effective to blow AR/BF can be difficult to a newcomer, but otherwise this is a pretty straightfoward spec. While it might have less bells’n'whistles, its heavy sustained damage is a force to reckon with. Admittedly, this spec is not the best PvP spec overall, but it has become more viable in sustained damage fights (certain 5v5 arena fights, etc.). But, with the right gear (and you will need major gear to be using this spec in PvP), your rogue can turn into an outright monster on the field.

I really only recommend this build in PvP to those who are very, very well equipped and also with a team of people who can support you out of stealth. This really isn’t going to be a top dueling spec, but I certainly expect to see combat specs in 5v5 arenas.
Mutilate- 41/0/20 or 41/20/0 or 41/3/17

Be sure to have some nice and slow daggers!

Whether combat or sub, this is the most clear-cut build to play. When playing against poorly played and equipped players this is a very strong spec, and you can often kill people before the end of KS. But, as gear inflates, and the rogue loses his proportionate gear advantages as people move from green to blue to epic, this spec loses some viability in PvP, especially in consideration of the opportunity cost of not having a 30/0/31. It lacks control beyond the initial stunlock round, but it has, without question, the strongest single stunlock round in the game.

CS-Mut-KS-Mut (or CB-Mut)

This is standard, easy and powerful. Another problem this is with anti-poison targets/measures, alongside the issues of having high energy and poison investment which does not lend this build to switching targets as effectively as other builds, but it certainly puts up some impressive numbers regardless. In honesty, it is a build that is best fit for those who are:

1.) Doing 3v3 and 5v5 arena
2.) Aren’t speccing to PvP/duel exclusively, and prefer to have a spec that does well in both PvE and PvP.
3.) or even simply newer to the rogue class (or if not new, simply not very skilled)—this is an easier spec to play as it has much fewer choices to make.

Generally, if you are a very serious dagger PvP rogue, stick to 30/0/31 (the only exception would be for 5v5 arena). This is a build that I consider more viable for dueling purposes than pure combat, but is still strictly worse than a 23+/0+/23+ CB/Prep build.
Warrior-

The class everyone is trying to beat. All classes are crafted as a response to this one. Pound for pound, nobody can truly toe-to-toe with a warrior. It has long been the case that a rogue cannot stand up and trade hits with a warrior. Sure, you can evasion and rush down to some extent (combat spec does best at this), but even then, a warrior played correctly will still beat you if all you did was toe-to-toe. Everyone must control the PvP-specced warrior in some fashion, including the rogue (regardless of build).

A PvP-specced warrior will be MS + a minor in Fury to pickup Deathwish and Imp Intercept. They are a force to reckon with. They have high rage generation (even after normalization), outlets to spend it, tools to prevent kiting, and they will continue to progress in power as they effectively scale with the inflating itemization. Personally, I have found that I have less and less room for error against this class. This is the fight of patience and finesse–Going kamikaze will get you killed.

Even as mitigation levels have dropped across the board after the expansion (due to itemization and leveling), you will still be hindered by their massive hp/armor defenses. Because of their defenses, in a duel, a rogue should initially be using DoT abilities (wisely) to atleast let them open on a warrior with 60% health instead of 100%. You will use a combination of DoT-kiting and stunlock to beat any warrior that is geared, specced, and played correctly.

Your initial open should not be CS. We used to stunlock, build 5-combo points and 5-8 kite–you know, the old unload while stunned and deadzone kite otherwise. Sometimes we could deadzone kite for a restealth (shout keeps us in combat, and they certainly know to do this), but mostly we’d 5-8 to get our energy back up and unload on a KS from behind (as we jump through them). Even if the tactic still retains some use even now, the old 5-8 days are generally over against a skilled warrior. They will always get the intercept. If you play against a pro, be prepared to reap the whirlwind (haha) if you do nothing but 5-8 kite…this is NOT a zero-CD fight against a good warrior. But, sometimes your options are limited, by all means use the 5-8 tactic when applicable and necessary, and do remember to stay closer to 5 than to 8.

Lastly, the introduction of the second wind talent makes long-term stunlocking less appealing, as both health and rage generation can be extremely dangerous. When we are stunlocking a warrior, we need to win quickly. The more stuns we land, the more rage+health a warrior will gain over the course of a fight. As in many matchups, the longer the actual combat duration, the more likely our opponent, the warrior in this case, is going to win. Chain stunning just gives them juice. You cannot accept this. Your objective is to build up resources to a high threshold through a few pre-combat tactics and DoT-Kiting, without the warrior gaining hp or rage advantages, and then unloading all at once inside a single stunlock round.
Step 1–Poison of Choice

It goes without saying (but I will anyway), Crippling Poison is required. Gouge, sap, and blind are too important to dare use deadly poison. Some who wish to risk it may try 1x Instant + 1x Crippling on either hand (as you can shiv). But, usually it is best to just keep them snared at all times, even at the sacrifice of some damage (control is everything).

Step 2–Generating pre-open combo points, the “combo point kite”.

Remember that this is a duel. Your opponent already has a huge advantage in simply knowing that you are there–thus, our stealthy element of surprise, a distinctive advantage we have in most world PvP situations, is gone. But, that doesn’t mean we can’t use stealth to its fullest advantage, even in the warrior fight. I am of the belief that you should take advantage of everything in your arsenal in a duel, even if it seems “cheap” to an opponent. That means I do use psychological warfare, for example I might wait 15 seconds before opening just to frustrate my opponent, and it also means I use tactics that might be less-than-useful outside of a dueling context. One advantage that we don’t use enough is the ability to sap/CS. Sure it is cheap, but c’mon people, that is why they call it “Cheapshot”, this is part of the class. So, if you are serious about winning duels against the best, expect to use pre-combat tactics to generate small advantages in your favor, especially as you’ve already sacrificed your element of surprise. When you and some warrior are the last people standing in an arena match, you’ll be thinking the same thing.

Your opener is a cheap way to gain a small advantage that can make a big difference in the end. On every warrior you ever duel, you should open with Imp sap and attempt to CS through sap. Do it carefully of course! I don’t care if you have premed, if you have Imp sap, you should always at least try it once against a warrior. The majority of warriors in this game will not berserker rage out of sap, primarily because they are saving it for gouge. Some will be slick by zerker raging and will try to shout you out, but if you are good, you’ll be far enough away that it won’t matter. Just run in for the sap, and run out quickly. See how the warrior reacts (he is your specimen to dissect while you are in stealth). If the warrior BR’s (berserker rage) out of sap, then stay far enough away and watch your castbar. After BR and sap-DR (diminishing return) is up, go for it again while his BR is on CD. Eventually, you should get your initial points, and these DO matter (as well as to annoy and/or psych your opponent out). So, get your sap/CS (remember to CS without breaking sap!), and flat run away. Go for your restealth (camo helps if you have it).

If this takes too long for you, or you have a build without Imp sap, then you can also forget the sap and just CS and run (but beware a warrior that is going to trinket CS and intercept you). Minor run speed helps here, just make sure you CS at max range and immediately start running, you can get your restealth, and it is worth every penny. Just remember to save yourself room so you don’t stray to far away from the flag.

For those who will not be sap/CSing, then just premed right here. No, it isn’t as effective, and yes, after your upcoming vanish you may wish you had that premed to burn for your real open. But, in some cases, for example due to time constraints, premed can be the best option. If you don’t wish to sap/CS for some reason, then premed is definitely a solid replacement.

Step 3–The DoT Kite.

You should be starting this fight at 2-5 combo points (depending on your build and how many times you sap/CSed). What do you do now? You want to garrote+rupture and get back into stealth asap; let that sucka’ bleed while you wait to go in for the kill. To start, make sure the warrior has no rage, sprint in from behind, and start spamming garrote, which should put you have 5 points, immediately rupture, run off and vanish (throw in a shiv if possible, but not at the cost of getting bled). Be quick about it! You really don’t want to eat a bleed effect, use a Luffa if you need. In fact, you may even want to use a macro that spams garrote in stealth and rupture out of stealth. Be sure to be out of range of shout as well.

A Garrote + 5-point Rupture (especially with talents) will bring most warriors to 60-65% by the end of those DoTs (especially with Berserker stance). Your job, during the DoT kite is to prevent the turtle. A good warrior will attempt to regain that health back. This happens through eating and/or bandaging during and after DoT effects, also through limiting damage taken by going into defensive stance. Crippling poison does an excellent job of preventing them from escaping to fully turtle, so use your your remaining sprint wisely. At no time should you allow them to eat/bandage or mount up (as they’ll run away to eat/bandage). If you wish, and you want to end it quickly, as you can even help prevent spirit regeneration from going OOC, you can vanish, wait a moment and goto the next phase of this fight without waiting the full duration of the DoT’s.

Step 4–The Stunlock: rushdown, busting the trinket, and abusing his stances.

The stunlock can vary on the stance of the warrior. Stance dancing is a part of life as a warrior, and it calls for adjustments in our playstyle as well. The most important part of the stunlock is this: it should not last long. You are opening on a warrior with 60-65% health, a bit of rage, who dearly wants to heal up before you open. You don’t want to give them a chance to heal, nor do you want them to in anyway benefit from the use of a trinket or second wind. Make it short and sweet.

Defensive– They mean to tank you (and yes, they can with major gear). Eviscerate is acceptable depending on the warrior’s gear, but KS is a much stronger route. Go heavy stunlock. Gouge is a very potent tool in this circumstance as well, so use it wisely. Watch for disarm. Remember they can’t charge or intercept, so kiting can be easy here, just watch for the stance dance.

If the warrior is in defensive stance, then you’ll want to try (if possible) to wait for the very end of the DoTs before you reopen so that you can use gouge effectively. Gouge is a powerful tool, and it punishes non-zerker stances. It can give you a restealth, energy, a combo point, positioning, time to wear-off bleeds/MS effects/hamstring, and even a quick bandage.

Dealing with the PvP trinket can be a pain (some don’t wear it, but they certainly should). You really want the defensive warrior to trinket on CS so you can follow up with KS. But, assuming he is a good warrior, he will save that trinket for KS. Follow up with a gouge on his trinket or blind him, and go for your restealth. Do not lose control of this fight. Get your restealth, and he loses right here…restealthing against the tank warriors is imperitive. 5-8 kiting into a restealth is common right here.

Berserker–The most common stance I find a warrior at this stage of the fight. While you can’t effectively gouge, he takes a truck-load of damage–Rush him down within a stunlock. Post-DoT-kite, I often Premed-CS-CB-Evisc-GS to 10-30% and Evasion tank him down. But, do remember: If he isn’t stunned, and you are in melee range, then you should have evasion on. The trinket doesn’t matter much here. The majority of your damage has already been dealt via DoT’s+CB-eviscerate, so it looks more like a 10-30% warrior vs 100% rogue…Of course, use your stunlock component’s wisely, there is no reason to eat a 2.5k MS if you can just pin him down. Standard stunlocks, minus gouge, are perfectly acceptable. If the warrior BR’s early, then KS, unload and gouge out for a restealth. Blind is always up if it gets ugly.

Battle–He aims to bleed and overpower you down, but he makes himself vulnerable to a rushdown AND gouge. I rarely see warriors jump into this stance at this point in the fight, but I punish them with both a rushdown and gouge. Easy restealth, 2nd real open…he won’t come back.

In any case, know the stance your warrior is in, and be ready to fight differently according to each stance.

Tips:

a.) Intimidating shout–Trinket/WotF this immediately. You should be fully ready to trinket on Intim-shout at all times.

b.) Keep evasion up at all times against warriors not controlled by your stuns/incapacitate/disorient or stealth effects (yes, stealth is a form of control). It kills their rage generation, negates the majority of their damage, sometimes forces a stance dance, begs their intimidating shout, and serves as a gateway to other control functions of a rogue. Evasion gives you a brief window in which your offense/defense ratio is equivalent to theirs, use it wisely and often.

c.) When in doubt, blind. Even if you feel like it is “too early” in the fight. This is your ‘oh shit!’ key. Against dwarves, if they refuse to stoneform out of your crippling, then you are SoLuck (although it buys you a second or two, which CAN matter).

d.) Prepare yourself for trinkets and stun resists. Gouge, KS, Vanish, Blind, Evasion, Bugging the intercept, and 5-8 kiting can all be appropriate responses. Even sprinting away after being newly intercepted but not Hamstringed can be powerful. Every warrior will have stun resist, not all will have trinket at the ready.

e.) Watch your timers judiciously. If you saw them misstep by popping BR too early, and you see a gap to use it, then capitalize off it.

f.) Watch for last stand and life giving type abilities as usual, especially in arenas. This is the instant turtle, and the gap that many rogues aren’t prepared for. It counteracts a rogue going “all-out”, and punishes us for sacrificing future resources just to get the win “now”. In my opinion, you really want to outlast these effects rather than DPS through them. But, at no time can you afford for the warrior to heal or turtle. Roll with the punches on this one.

g.) Bugging the intercept. Basically, if you circle-strafe a warrior who is crippled poisoned, when they intercept, it will often send them in the wrong direction. The intercept stun will wear off, and you will get a restealth.

Summary:

1.) sap/CS (or premed)
2.) Sprint-Garrote-(Shiv if possible, and if necessary for 5th point)-Rupture-Vanish
3.) Prevent turtle
4.) Open appropriately on stance, generally premed-CS-CB-Evisc-Evasion
5.) Restealth when possible and if necessary.

Overall, this fight is one of finesse. You build up your resources and overtake them in a fell swoop. In a fair fight, a rogue should be winning this matchup the majority of the time.

Paladin-

The ultimate turtle, both in solo and grouping. While they can be defeated solo, they are without question the best counter to a rogue in group PvP. They (or their teammate of choosing) simply cannot be “rushed” down in the same way that any other class in the game can. Given time, we can certainly win this fight even against the best paladins. The drop in mitigation levels, changes in speccs and itemization, and a few rogue changes have made this class much easier to deal with.

Paladins will be aiming to outlast you in some sense. How long they wish to turtle is dependant upon their build. Some builds deal way more damage than others, and will often rush you down and use very minor turtles to beat you, for example a ret pally might use his HoJ to be dealing some damage to you rather than using it entirely for healing. On the flip side, holy paladins lack damage but have excellent healing. They are more apt to use HoJ to heal up and to play the outlast game against you. Overall though, this class has become much easier for the basic rogue, and thus far, the matchup is less gear reliant on the rogue’s end than it used to be.

Like the druid, this class has very high turtle-potential, a potential that most pallies you’ll meet simple won’t reach. The general abilities we should be considering:

Hammer of Justice- 6 second stun, 1 minute cooldown. It provides ample tempo advantages every minute to a skilled paladin. A combination of heals and damage can be used during an HoJ. It can also be the creation or elimination of a kite. Silence effects, stuns and CoS provide temporary prevention of this spell, however, good paladins anticipate and work around our counters. It is one of the strongest spells in the game as fast as I’m concerned. While paladins can no longer heal to full in a single heal, HoJ gives them longevity. Most paladins fail to burn this CD every time it comes up….

The Bubbles—Absolute immunity from a rogue’s damage, what a strong counter to our class in so many situations! Combined with healing, these bubbles are generally the core turtle-engine of the paladin. HoJ and repentance are good, but they simply don’t compare to the absolutist impact of true immunity. A paladin can bubble through everything in a rogue’s arsenal. There are two bubbles:

Divine Shield-12 seconds of immunity. 5-min CD. Nothing you can do.
Blessing of Protection-10 seconds immunity from physical damage, 5 minute CD. This can be blinded (pray he isn’t a dwarf with half a brain).

BoP can be countered with a blind, but stoneform counters it. Bubbles give a rogue the time to restealth and/or heal up. Sprint, bandage, restealth, sap, eat or some combination thereof can get your health back up. Even just flat running off to bandage-restealth can be fine. Match his healing with your own. This is a war of attrition folks. Do notice that all bubbles have 5-min CD’s, and that they have the “Forbearance” debuff applied to them, which lasts for one minute, preventing them from bubbling again. Good paladins have the means to live another minute beyond their first bubble when played correctly, so expect at least 2 bubbles in a fight.

Laying of Hands- 100% of paladins health + 900mana restored, 60 minute cooldown. When a paladin goes all out, this just makes them all the harder to defeat. A dominant spell.

Repentance—A 6 second incapacitate (like gouge, only sexier and ranged) with a 1 minute CD. 31-point ret talent.

Blessing of Freedom—Immunity from movement impairing effects

Consecration-Point blank AE around paladin. Rank 1 is spammed every 8 seconds. A mod to show the ticks would be nice if anyone wants to make one. It can deny a rogue open. If you are that worried, then just CoS through it.

The proper rotation of these abilities can make life rough for a rogue. It is really not simple to defeat a paladin that uses their abilities to turtle to a maximum extent, although you’ll rarely meet paladins that really play perfectly. Most of the time they won’t be too difficult for you to defeat. You’ll break the initial turtle and win on the spot or drain his mana through tit-for-tat measures, and he’ll lose the game. Wound poison puts huge pressure on their mana and CD’s as they are unable to heal as effectively. Less healing means they have will have to blow more CDs to cast more wounded heals. More heals used means more mana burned. This is good as it eliminates the long term use of HoJ, Repentance, Bubbles, and spirit regen to overcome us.

Speccs you’ll face:

Retadin (approx: 44 ret / 17 holy)—Damage specced, Often noobs (no offense). Big numbers. They’ll often go rushdown on you, and with enough gear, they can make it hurt. While they can deal good damage, these guys also take a lot of damage. Survive their initial assault and you’ll come back on them. At maximal gear levels, ret pallies will be our hardest matchup.

Holy (approx: 47 holy / 14 prot)—Healing specced. A great turtle; crap for damage though. Run his mana dry and you win.

Protection (approx:13 Holy / 41 Prot / 7 Ret)—Not a terrible spec. Heavy damage shields, and those DO add up (sit and parse it if you don’t believe me). Decent damage.

Differences in the builds can change the fight slightly, but the same tactic will remain the same. Force his CD’s as early as possible, heal up if necessary, and kill him before he can CD into another turtle-round. Paladins won’t be healing us to death for now, and they have, at equal gear, great difficulty in taking out even 50%+ of our health in a single HoJ. Paladin healing, damage, and mitigation are proportionally much lower in TBC (this is due to low end itemization at this point).

Step 1—The open, forcing the bubble early within a softlock.

Wound MH, Crippling OH. Shiv when you need to kite. Watch his Consecration spamming. You might even catch him off it for a sap/CS (yeah, he can break with a bubble…but that would be awesome!).

Premed and charge in for the open, n52 spamming is excellent for spamming the open through consecration. For this fight, control only matters in eliminating the paladin’s ability to turtle, you don’t care so much about his offensive abilities, with the exception of HoJ/Repentance. The virtual tempo advantages of Cheapshot aren’t as useful here because we aren’t concerned with a paladin’s damage as much as we are concerned with simply forcing a bubble. With that in mind, garrote is simply a better open on a paladin. It silences for 3 seconds and deals some damage in itself as opposed to “allowing” us to damage to paladin within the protective hedge of a stun. A silence will be almost as effective as a stun in this portion of the fight, and coupled with garrote’s cheaper cost and damage it is the better choice.

If you can catch him off consecration spam, or you want to CoS through consec, you can generate precombat points generated through sap/CS, it should look something like this:

Sap/CS-wait for DR-Garrote-Rupture or CB-Evisc-CoS-Yellow

If you don’t go for precombat points, then use:

Premed-Garrote-Yellow-Rupture or CB-Evisc-CoS

The whole point of the opener is to setup for a lethal rushdown while minimizing the effectiveness of non-bubble abilities. Keeping him silenced and CoSing eliminate the utility of HoJ/Rep. Remember to connect Garrote-CoS, there can be no lapse. Most pallies will be spamming HoJ right off the bat, so avoiding it means you can put heavy pressure on them to force a bubble because they can’t HoJ/Rep for a heal.

It is worth considering the use of CB-eviscerate instead of rupture. Against a large portion of the paladin population, CB-Eviscerate will down them to 40% so quickly that they’ll be in dire need of a bubble. On the flip side, cold blood offers an excellent tool to combo out within a stunlock. If for some reason they get low on health, CB can let you beat them right there. This is up to you, both rupture and eviscerate are good options.

In any case, you want to deal major damage and apply 5 wound poison within the first 8 seconds.

Step 2—Forcing the Bubble

CoS is ending, at what health do you find your paladin? Did he bubble? Does he have his PvP trinket active? These are all factors in your decisions. In the best case scenario, you dropped him to low enough health in the 8 second of garrote+CoS that he bubbled. If he bubbled, then just run off for a restealth as he is healing up. If he is low on health, a vanish-CS-Finisher can finish him. If you didn’t get too far on his health, and you don’t want to vanish-CS-Finish, then you might be forced to just eat his HoJ. Generally, it is best to vanish-CS. Why? Vanish-CS furthers your softlock on the paladin by another 4-15 seconds (depending on what you do after the CS), and it provides even more pressure to force a bubble. You really don’t want to eat an early HoJ if you can help it. At the very least, vanish offers us a way to burn his trinket while forcing just a bit more damage through. You go vanish-CS-KS or vanish-premed-CS into CB-Evisc or KS, and continue that pressure.

Against a top pally who is blowing a trinket into a HoJ (you’ll get hit no matter what you do):

CoS-Sap-CS-wait for CoS timer-Garrote-Rupture-Yellow-CoS-Yellow-Yellow-Vanish-CS-CB-Evisc

This is 9-12 seconds of white + 3 yellow + 5 wound poison + Garrote + 5 pt Rupture + 5 pt CB Evisc, which is a serious open on any paladin. I’ve yet to meet one that didn’t need to bubble out of this. Even after you open, consecration shouldn’t be problematic as CoS-Vanish-CS will let you resist, which will no longer bring you out of stealth. This assumes he’ll blow trinket->HoJ on CS. If not, then you can work him down with KS if you know there isn’t a trinket for it.

Post Garrote, you want to do everything in your power to force a bubble without eating a hammer and apply 5x wound poison. Forcing a bubble means you get to runoff and restealth while he heals up (with wound on him), and more importantly, it means you have almost a minute to kill him before his second bubble. At the very least, you are drawing out his resources, forcing reactive play and inefficiency on his part, allowing you to control the situation. You overcome his CD-Turtle and you win.

Step 3—Continued Anti-Turtle, Attempting to win before the 2nd bubble.

You forced his bubble, you should be at decent health (bandage if necessary). You’ve got a minute to defeat him before the next bubble. You’ll defeat most pallies right here. Garrote or CS is perfectly acceptable, and if he isn’t a dwarf, then blind is extremely potent as well. If you haven’t used premed due to precombat point generation, then now isn’t a bad time to use it. You are hoping your second open is what defeats the paladin before he can bubble again.

Unfortunately, CoS and vanish were used up early to force a bubble (but it was worth it), and if CoS didn’t eat it already, you’re likely to eat a HoJ/rep. You can’t really do much about it other than stack wound poison. Any healing he gets off from this point on will be greatly diminished through wound poison, but you really don’t want him healing period. As usual, interrupt all heals when applicable. You’ve got a full minute to work him down, each heal puts him closer and close to surviving to the next bubble. Additionally, evasion is quite useful right here.

It is at this stage that you need to be careful around the very well equipped ret pallies. They can power through some substantial damage. They have compressed turtle fights. This is good and bad in some ways. The good part is that we can force the ret pally to bubble much earlier because they are not specced or geared for survivability. You are much more likely to have CD’s left after opening and forcing a bubble on a ret pally. Additionally, you’ll meet many retardins that spam HoJ directly into CoS (even though they saw you use it…lol) simply because they think they are going to burst you down. Countless retpallies will blow HoJ and sometimes even repentance during CoS, they’ll realize it too late, they are forced to bubble, and the rogue gets to reopen on a pally that has zero turtle capability for straight minute. That is the best case scenario, one that happens often enough, and allows the rogue to truly capitalize off the paladins mistakes. On the other hand, a very well equipped ret pally will still be breaking 60% mitigation with some nearly lethal HoJ/Rep rushdowns, and if played correctly, i.e. not HoJ/Rep when you CoSed, then your sure to eat it after your second open. Unfortunately, this is a case where you really must have the damage to force bubbles, but also the defensive stats to live through his assault. It is here that your gear will matter most in the pally matchup. Post bubble, having not blown HoJ/Rep, the well-geared/played retadin is the most difficult paladin to defeat for a rogue.

Holy and Protection specs are much easier at this point. Depending on whether they burned their HoJ during your CoS or not, you are just running them down. Garrote is preferable here because the mitigation levels are high enough that you simply want to win before the minute is up, and you really aren’t concerned about his damage. Premed-Garrote-Yellow-Rupture and rush him down. Keep 25e up at all times, you need to kick all heals and be sure wound is stacked to 5x as usual. Most pallies will be holy/prot specced, and that makes the fight relatively easier in general.

Pretty much every CD and attack is at least useful in this matchup. Deadly throw is good damage and interruption. Shiv is great for getting that crippling to stick. Our anti-caster and anti-melee tactics are all excellent. In any case, sometimes you lose control of this fight. Bandaging can be invaluable. For the long, long fights, as often found in the case when the paladin outgears you, you’ll be needing to bandage/eat. Play the out-last game, business as usual against turtles.

Tips:

a.) Dwarven folk are your bane. Blind can be very valuable in this match, and a good dwarf will BoP->Stoneform->Heal to eliminate blind’s utility. Not much you can do. Try and lure his Stoneform on a kite if you want, it probably won’t work (BoFreedom is always available). You are quite likely to play the out-last game against a well-played and equipped dwarf pally.

b.) This is a rare fight that can be done no-CD for many rogues. Our CD’s simply make us more likely to win, and help us win faster. If winning matters, then go all out.

c.) CoS and Blind (w/elus) are on pretty short timers. It is quite possible to use them twice in a fight.

Summary:

1.) (CoS)-Sap-CS-(wait for CoS timer)-Garrote-Rupture-Yellow-CoS-Yellow-Yellow-Vanish-CS-CB-Evisc (or whatever it takes to force bubble)
2.) Restealth
3.) Premed-Open-Evasion-interrupt heals while rushing them down.
4.) If they turtle through it, then play outlast and/or prep.

The paladin fight has become much easier for rogues. I suspect that as gear inflates, this class ill become harder and harder for us. In the meantime, you should be winning against most pallies unless they are very well equipped.

Shaman-

A shaman can pull out some amazing clutch damage and healing. The can do a mixture of kiting, utility-DD, melee, healing–somewhat a jack-of-all-trades. What really defines the matchup for a rogue are the cues that you’ll see throughout the fight that tell us the intended tactic of the shaman, of course these do vary per spec and situation. Will you be preventing the kite, turtling their damage, or cracking their turtle?

There are three trees and three different directions you’ll see this class going. Each tree lends itself towards a certain tactic, but all three are capable of kiting, toe-toe-toe’ing, and turtling to some extent.

1.) Elemental–strong DD damage, they aim to kite. Expect to see these guys splash for other trees, usually resto. They will attempt to permanently kite you throughout the fight.

2.) Enhancement–They can finally dual wield. Stormstrike is also quite powerful. This is arguably their highest damage spec, but it is melee heavy. They will toe-toe-toe, so evasion is excellent here.

3.) Resto–by far our hardest shaman matchup. They turtle very effectively. Wound poison and kick are your friend. A resto shaman will do some kiting and some toe-to-toe, but generally will prefer to keep their distance. Fire totems are especially deadly here, as the fight can be quite lengthy.

Generally, you know you are fighting at least a decent shaman when you see three things: a.) Poison cleansing totem and b.) a shield and c.) a PvP trinket (you’d be surprised how many no longer wear these because of a lack of stats). A shaman will do a combination of kiting and toe-to-toe depending on their situation at hand. You need to recognize which they are attempting to do and counter it. Blowing CDs at inappropriate times is a waste of valuable resources, so anticipating and reading the situation can be vital.

Step 1–Poisons

Crippling must be either MH or OH, I prefer it OH in this fight. The reason is that they will be dispelling your poison throughout the fight, and you’ll be shivving in response. Your MH poison should be wound. Eliminating the effectiveness of their healing dampens their future action trees greatly. You want to sustain a stack of 5 wound poison at all times as a shaman can get some quick heals off, and if they get any off, you want to make sure it isn’t for alot.

Step 2—Totems, How will you Open?

Totem Lineup should look something like: Earthbind, Magma/Searing, Poison Cleansing, Grace. A good shaman will keep the poison cleansing totem far away from them, making it a sacrifice for the rogue to take it out, and will be sitting on their fire totem (usually magma).

The totems you should be concerned with:

Earthbind=AoE snare. It has a CD to cast, so use that to your advantage. Beware of newly casted EB totems, the first tick WILL bring you out of stealth.

Magma=Excellent at denying the rogue an open, a shaman’s flare/trap camp equivalent. It pulses an AoE. Watch the timing of it, you’ll see it flicker. You can run in between those pulses and get your open. Lag or lack of time available can make this much more difficult, a good shaman will know this and use it to his advantage. CoS is a preventive measure.

Poison Cleansing totem=It periodically removes a poison effect on the shaman (and his team members). This removes our weapon-applied poisons but also our blind. Our poisons are quite essential; leaving PCtotem up is a major sacrifice for us.

You can choose to ignore the totems, kill the totems, or a combination. I suggest doing one of the latter two choices, particularly in order to remove poison cleansing. The common method is to sap the shaman and squish the totems, restealth before the end of sap, and go in for the kill. You can also remove the poison cleansing totem, if it is very close, during CS, gouge or KS.

If you ignore the totems, it is a sign that you intend to win very quickly, and that you don’t need blind. It could also be the case that you have timers on the totems, specifically PCTotem, and that you are opening at the very end of its duration (giving a window to blind if PC is not recast). If the shaman is not resto, a rushdown is acceptable, as long as you maintain control of the situation (i.e. prevent kiting, keep evasion on when appropriate, prevent all heals). Ignoring totems is quite viable if the shaman doesn’t have all the right totems down yet as well or he runs out of range. If you go this route, then premed-CS-CB-Evisc and follow through on a stunlock, just stay on them like glue. But, if they are a pro, you really can’t afford to do this as the totem advantage is very large.

You may also sap/CS the shaman, restealth and wait for DR, sap/totem squash, restealth and then re-open on a target you’ve already built combo points on. Remember that rogues now keep combo points on a target (even if untargeted) as long they do not generate combo points on another target. Sap/CSing and running away for a restealth is difficult to pull off on a shaman, as fire totems and EB make getting the restealth more complicated. For this reason, it is quite acceptable to do either.

Step 3–The Stunlock

Your shaman should have no poison cleansing totem up at this point, maybe even all relevant totems are gone. It is also possible that you’ve sap/CSed into pre-combat combo points, but I’ll outline the fight without those. I expect that gouge is on DR at this point, so watch your timers, and try and save the use of gouge for when it isn’t on DR or for trinket. If you are totem squashing during CS/Gouge/KS (generally gouge), then be quick.

Premed and open with CS on all shaman. Control is most important. Go through your normal stunlock routine, while accounting for diminishing returns. You should consider saving gouge, as it is very useful in preventing the kite on a trinket. Be sure to shiv if crippling doesn’t apply naturally. In some cases, especially non-resto shamans, rushing down from here is quite acceptable. Premed-CS-CB-Evisc brings them to 50-70%. From here, a shaman that has no PCleansing totem up and chooses not to trinket out of the initial stunlock has already lost the fight.

Generally, a good shaman will trinket on CS or KS, and I see arguments for both. In either case, watch for the trinket. If the rogue is not quick in responding to a trinket, you should see the following things occur in this order:

1.) Poison cleansing totem is cast
2.) A Shock hits you
3.) SStrike or NS when applicable.

The rogue wishes to prevent a successful trinket. If the rogue is not successful in responding to the trinket, then he has yet another PCTotem to take out and the possibility of being kited or DPSed down. Expect frostshock. The best response to a trinket is a gouge or a KS if available. If and when you don’t get a gouge on the trinket, then CoS/Sprint/Evasion/Vanish/Blind (as long as PCtotem isn’t up) are all viable counters. CoS is especially good at the end of a stunlock, and pretty good on a trinket, as it will often eat the initial shock, preventing the kite in large part.

Here is where I’ll break up the fight, we’ll go from easiest situation to hardest.

Step 4–Toe-to-Toe

Usually only an unskilled shaman will use this tactic exclusively. Enhancement shaman who are used to 3-4 shotting people (and it does happen from time to time) are quite prone to toe-to-toe, especially as their spec is designed for it. Generally, this means they will be attempting to burst you down and will rarely be healing. They’ll melee+shock you to death.

At any stage a shaman wishes to toe-to-toe with you, you should pop evasion. A SUBSTANTIAL portion of a shaman’s damage comes from melee. This is especially true for enhancement shaman. Evasion will shut them down cold. Keep your face to them, and stick on them like glue. Anticipating a shock with CoS is also quite helpful. By the end of evasion, the shaman should be in trouble and CS should be off DR. Just vanish-CS into him and he loses.

Step 5–The Kite

You really prefer to have shiv’ed the shaman and kept them toe-to-toe, but a good shaman just won’t have it. Somehow, they’ve managed to escape your grasp. They will attempt to snare you through frostshock and EBtotem rotation (attempting to avoid DR and work around cooldowns). Easy damage for them and opportunities to heal up. This tactic wins matches, and if left uncountered is a loss for the rogue.

Deadly Throw, Sprint, CoS, and Vanish should be used to close the gap between you and that shaman (basically, use anything you have to catch them). Sprint is the most powerful in closing the gap, and should be saved for this portion of the fight (don’t use it during the open, use it when you actually need it).

1.) CoS (F-shock/EB)-> Sprint

2.) Vanish (F-shock/EB tick)->Sprint

3.) Deadly Throw is excellent (requires combo points though). It is pretty decent damage, and if the shaman is very low on life, feel free to CB Deadly Throw them. The snare effect is quite powerful, and with PvP Gloves it becomes downright amazing (yay, our own little earthshock).

I truly suggest CoS-Sprinting. Nothing will stop you from closing the gap, and you saved your precious vanish(-CS) and combo points for later in the fight. Generally, I want to sprint up and either gouge, kick or KS them in the face. Preventing heals is vital, so if you can’t get up to them in time, then you need to deadly-throw or blind.

From here, you are going back to step 4ish. You WANT to toe-to-toe with them. Keep them stunlocked when you can, and keep your energy available for a kick at all times.

Step 6–The turtle

While elemental and enhancement are easily defeated by the steps 4 and 5, the resto shaman is a different beast. You can’t “rush” a resto shaman down as a rogue. Properly geared, a rogue (w/o poison) cannot outdamage their healing. Their earth shield effect has 10 charges on each cast (which scales with +spell gear to some extent), and combined with any quick heals and NS, the resto shaman is going to be staying at high health for an extended duration. Luckily for us, the resto shaman deals relatively little damage compared to the other trees. The turtle can be similar to toe-toe-toe and is the tactic a resto shaman uses almost exclusively, but is also used when a rogue has closed the gap at the end of a kite on a low-health shaman of any spec.

Here is where wound poison shines SO much. Keep those PC totems smashed and keep them wounded. Cutting their healing in half means you’ll be cracking the turtle while taking less damage. This is a war of attrition, and you’re going to be eating their hits (and you’re gonna like it too mister), conserving energy and abilities with one purpose in mind: interrupting and preventing all heals.

At no point should your energy drop below 30, and preferably not below 45. You’ll need available energy to prevent and interrupt heals (shaman are pretty fast cast). A combination of kicks, KSes, vanish-CSes, blinds (yeah, that is plural, I’ve had fights last long enough that I’ve used 2 in a fight), and gouges to interrupt those heals. Gouge and blind are particularly useful for giving you a window to bandage yourself. Don’t be afraid to gouge->bandage. The war of attrition will lead to one of three things:

1.) Catching the shaman with his pants down having no Earthshield while being at 40% health with no poison cleansing totem. Just blind right here and you win.

2.) Running out of mana.

3.) And, sometimes, dealing lethal even through earthshield, usually due to perfect spell interrupts, wound eating heals and even his NS, and quite often because it was a poorly played or geared resto shaman.

Running a resto shaman out of mana is a common practice in arena as well. You can always go for the gouge-restealth-get to safe place and bandage just to re-open on a shaman with far less mana (assuming he has no summoned food or drink). You’ll outpace his mana regeneration by a long shot, and, for long enough fights will give you CD’s back. But, generally, in regular duels, you never want to give them an opportunity to eat/drink. Most likely, if you ran them out of mana, you were diligent in gouge/blind/sap->bandaging.

And, as stated, sometimes you be so lethal from interrupting the big heals that NS and Earthshield are simply speedbumps to the finale. Good for you!

In any case, if they are turtling, then they aren’t dealing really lethal damage at the same time. Proper heal prevention and bandaging will crack a turtle.

Tips–

a.) You CAN effectively blind through PCleansing. Luck might be required to some extent. The cleansing effect is periodic. So, it is common to blind a shaman and quickly kill his totem before he is cleansed.

b.) For extremely long fights, it is quite acceptable to simply reset it by gouge-restealthing, running off to bandage up and coming back again to fight. This is especially common in arenas, against resto shaman, and when you’ve made one or more large play errors.

c.) Consider taking out fire totems, as this eliminates another good portion of their damage.

d.) Never drop below 30% health, as a shaman can one-shot you in this health range.

e.) While EA is good, it is not optimal. Expose armor is generally not worth the point expenditures in this matchup. CB-Eviscerates, KSes, and deadly throws are simply better finishers for this matchup. If you are very skilled, sap/CSing into a sap/EA/killing the 2-3 relevant totems/restealthing/opening is a possibility. You need to be pretty awesome to pull this off though, getting OOC/restealth before the end of sap in this lineup is difficult.

f.) Gouge those who don’t jumpshot kite and just walk backwards (retards).

g.) Note that wolf form prevents sapping. But, he can’t cast totems inside ghost form.

Summary:

1.) sap/squash relevant totems/restealth
2.) Stunlock
3.) Prevent kite and interrupt all heal
4.) Bandage as necessary

This is a fight a rogue should be winning, we simply have too many tools to prevent or eliminate shaman’ strategies.

Hunter-

This used to be a matchup I loved when they didn’t know I was there, and one of the worst matchups if they were prepared for me and played correctly. Flare/Trap/Track Stealth camping nearly counters a core function, possibly an entire tree, of the rogue class. Geared and played correctly, I always felt a hunter should win more times than not in this matchup (having played both and written PvP/Duel guides for both, that was still true until late 2006). However, as we closed in upon TBC, we saw a few meaningful buffs to the rogue that gave us a much better chance against the hunter, putting the fight in our favor.

1.) Cloak of Shadows removes everything, can help eat traps and also gives us the opportunity to get rid of that awful Serpent Sting. When trapped, a good hunter will open with AS-SSting, and as vanish has been bugged for a long time (and always will be, *sigh –”working as intended”), SSting will stick even through a spammed vanish–no rogue could effectively restealth or escape. We could sprint up and vanish into his face, and we had a brief gap between DoT ticks to get an open…but we could never reset the fight. CoS lets us reset the fight, often on our terms. Finally, rogues have both a proactive and reactive disruptive feature that gives us anti-gank measures.

2.) Vanish removes hunters mark, and without SSting on us, it is a true restealth. Don’t forget it, because hunters will often forget to re-mark you in later combat (and that can come in handy, especially in group pvp).

3.) Evasion now also gives us a 25% avoidance to ranged/missiles. This lowers their effective damage on a kite, as well as dealing with pet damage (which can easily break 250-300 DPS).

4.) We have the HP to withstand more hits, no longer can we ever be 2-3 shotted by this class…even though you will see 3.5-4k Aimed Shots once in a great while. On the same token, the hunter has higher survivability as well, but not the same proportional increase in survivability as the rogue class.

5.) Deadly Throw–not bad damage, can be chain thrown with relentless, and is effective at snaring your ranged hunter. Not a bad deal, especially as once you’ve closed the gap you’re going to premed-CS open for 5 points, so extra points are wisely used here.

With that said, we won’t put a hunter on farm status just yet. Even among certain nerfs they’ve faced, they’ve also had a few buffs. Dropping traps in combat (even if they have a timer), pets that immediately stop attacking on a CC’ed (mezzed) target (giving them less to worry about, and higher damage on average), becoming difficult to CC with their 41 beast talent, and greater survivability as well.

With any rogue spec, you’ll be aiming to close the gap, stunlock, and prevent any kiting. Almost all builds will be putting huge pressure, enough to kill, or nearly kill, any hunter that eats a full stunlock round. Get that open and you’ll win.

Step 1–Choosing how and when to open on a Hunter.

The hunter wants to kite you. Period. He wants to put distance between you and him, keeping you out of stealth while he pwns you. He’s going to flare/trap camp to start, and no matter how it works out, you’re going to want to stop him from kiting at all costs. Obviously 2x Crippling poison is what we’ll be using.

You need to ask yourself one question before we can go on: Are you going to eat the flare/trap and be forced to dance, or are you going to wait out the hunter’s silly flare/trap camp?

Given that we are a stealth class, we are gifted by the deities of Blizzard with the innate ability, via stealth, to choose whether and when we wish to strike an opponent. This ability to wait for “the moment of opportunity” is mostly present in gank-type situations, but it certainly has relevance in a duel. In the hunter matchup, we come face to face with it quite vividly. A hunter that is fully prepared for a rogue will, obviously, have laid a trap for us to walk into. We know it, we can even see that trap (both literally and figuratively). The hunter will be double flare/trap camping, and with even mediocre spirit regen he can keep it up all day. If you choose to not wait him out, then you lack “opportunity” in every sense of the word when you, begrudgingly of course, accept your fate that you will not get a stealth open, and will also be forced to trap-dance. In a friendly duel, I’ll gladly swallow my lumps and trap-dance, but if winning matters, then I’ll use everything I have in my power to win, including the resource of my time while in stealth (plus I get my CD’s back if they are down for some reason).

Alas, our stealth gives us the choice. You can just charge in, or you can sit and wait for the hunter to stop camping (or camping incorrectly, thus allowing you to catch him when he wanders off just slightly). Some hunters will call “waiting them out” poor etiquette, but clearly they have no clue about the very nature of the rogue. Blizzard gave us this ability and even if it pisses everyone off, we can surely use it to our advantage. We were designed to do this, even in duels. Time is on our side. It takes 100x the effort and concentration of a hunter to chain flare/trap camp as it does for me to walk to safe place and AFK until I’m darn well good and ready to open. For example, in the arena, when a hunter and I are the last people standing (I’m stealthed of course), I simply refuse to eat his flare/trap. Within even a minute, that hunter will get frustrated (and I won’t). He’ll slip up; he’ll run around, he’ll get outside of the flare radius, he’ll try hopping from flare radius to flare radius. Even if he goes to get a see-stealth buff, he’ll screw up while I’m patiently waiting at a safe distance. If it matters, then you can choose to get your open from stealth, and for important matches, I do suggest it.

Steps two and three are going to assume you will not wait him out, but if you do wait him out, then skip to step 4.

Step 2 (eating flare/trap)–Trap Dancing

So you’ve chosen the harder route, good for you–the fight is action packed and exciting. The hunter is sitting directly on top of his trap, or thereabouts, and he’s chain flaring. You will attempt to circle him, hitting him with shots just outside the trigger radius of the trap. There is only a slight difference in radius between melee range and the trap-trigger radius, but with practice you’ll become quite adept at weaving around the fine line. If you need, you can blow CoS, forget the trap, and just rush him.

Feel free to watch your timers, you can tell how long until that flare and that trap will wear out. You will want to at least wait until these are almost up before you start trap-dancing. You want to make sure they will run their duration quickly. Why? Because trap dancing should lead to eventual control of the fight. You are accepting loss of control from the beginning, but you need to quickly gain it back…Stealth is required to win against a good hunter. You cannot stealth neither on a trap nor on a flare. So you either need to draw him away (by letting him kite you), or even better, catching him with a blind at the end of the flare/trap duration so that you can get your open.

When you trap-dance, and most hunters won’t be used to this technique, they have a few responses available.

1.) They sic their pet and take your hits, keeping autoattack on, but not budging from the trap, hoping you’ll eat the trap or the pet will take you out before you take them out. This is the response of a noobie hunter.

2.) They’ll back up, and circle, attempting to keep the trap between you and them. Interesting technique. The proactive chaser (rogue) will close the gap though.

3.) They’ll Scatter Shot you, attempting to make you eat a trap, and will begin kiting. The normal response you should expect. CoSing the trap is quite nice right here. Early cripple/shiv takes care of a big kite. CoS-Shivving is huge.

4.) They go all crazy red incredible hulk on you and zerg….just run off and vanish, you can’t CC him. He just wasted a CD.

5.) Pet intimidate and begin the kite.

Those are the general responses, and sometimes they’ll use a combination. A poorly played hunter is highly susceptible to continual trap dancing. Sprint and evasion can help here. If you catch him off the trap, KS and unload on him. Generally, though, a good hunter is going to stabilize the fight first on you, and he’ll make you eat an SS, trap, or pet stun, and then they’ll start kiting.

Step 3–Preventing the Kite

On the kite, they’ll aspect of cheetah for the run speed, lay a trap while running (if not on CD), and open. Feel free to evasion right out of a trap. Be careful to avoid traps layed during combat, you’ll see his animation when he does it (don’t be deceived by those who jump+trap). A good one will begin kiting and drop it midway. You simply cannot allow for him to stay at range obviously, but don’t eat a trap you don’t have to just because of your fervor to prevent the kite and reopen. You need to close the gap and reset the fight, this time on your terms.

It depends on the situation, but sometimes simply sprinting up to him and vanish->opening is all you need. Other times the hunter will get his huge open on you–and if you decide not to CoS-Vanish (usually do to CD or flare constraints), then blow evasion when they are going to get some ranged hits on you. Feel free to deadly throw at him if you have the spare points. Anyways, you’ll catch up to him, hopefully not having sustained a ton of damage.

So, when his flare/trap is gone, or they’ve kited you to an area where there is no flare/trap, you want to get your real open on them. You have two options, you can Blind and/or Vanish (generally CoS->Vanish is required). Whatever it takes, you aim to get your open on them in a non-trapped/flared area. Again blind is less useful against dwarves, but it still might be necessary to blow it (maybe wait until they blow it to get off crip poison). Once you’ve stabilized the fight, you aim to control him the rest of the way.

Step 4–The stunlock

Assuming you’ve stabilized the fight or you are getting the open on a hunter, then you’re going to open with a fat CS on him. Here his PvP trinket is your only worry. You’ll go through your normal stunlock routine, but you watch for that trinket. He can bust out of either of your stuns (and your crip poison). You need to catch him on it. If you don’t catch him on it, then he may SS you in the face and start the cycle again. The perfect catch is a gouge on his trinket-SS. If he drops a trap here, just avoid or CoS it.

Full CD, on the open, and no trinket (a surprising number no longer equip this), you’ll win 100% of the time if you play correctly. No hunter comes back on our open. Premed, blind, vanish, and CB are invaluable in this stage. Burst him down within your stunlock, and continue for as long as you can. If you have it, or even need it, a blind post-KS (against non-dwarf) seals the deal every time.

If you can’t fully stunlock him, that’s okay. Stick on him like glue; he’ll be very low on health, and your remaining CD’s will overcome any measure of control he can muster.

Tips:

a.) Shiv that crippling poison on them if it isn’t already applied.

b.) Restealthing isn’t effective, as pets still charge at you even after you stealth. You have to vanish.

c.) It is possible to sprint-Sap a hunter within a flare. It won’t work 100% of the time, and it is latency based.

d.) CoS can be used in stealth, and it can be used to eat a trap. Charging into a flare/trap camp and CoSing to eat that trap can be quite powerful (and is sometimes necessary, especially in arena).

d.) Boar Charge can buy them additional kite time, be prepared for it.

Summary:

1.) Trapdance or Open
2.) Use Anti-kite measures to gain control of fight
3.) Stunlock (maintain anti-kite measures)

Until I start seeing better equipped hunters, I think a well played rogue should win this matchup more times than not. Armor levels have dropped considerably, and most hunters aren’t stocking up enough on HP gear. Prevent the kite and you win.

Druid-

A PvP druid will usually be feral, if they aren’t feral then you own them (wound poison and stunlock cures all). Now that doesn’t mean they’ll be in feral form the whole time by any means, and it doesn’t mean they won’t have points invested in other trees. But, the strongest PvP druids will be feral, and that is what you should prepare for, especially as non feral druids are much easier to deal with. Mind you, as an odd “hybrid” (and I use this term very loosely in regards to the druid, who really plays “role-replacement” in my mind), the feral druid can have varying gear, and thus a varying tactic that we must identify and respond to. Some are going all out damage, at the expense of a solid mana-base and armor; some are going to tank you; and, some will keep their mana-options open, but sacrifice feral damage and tankability–the best will use a combination thereof. Mangle and gear variations can make this a difficult class. Finding truly skilled druids that can make use of their abilities is a different matter together (how unfortunate!).

It is to know what gear configuration they are using. You need to identify whether they are dealing very lethal damage (even higher yellow DPS than a rogue as far as I’m concerned) or if they are going the defensive route. If they are in tank gear, then you’ll be more likely to DoT and tank them down. If they are damage based in gear, then you’ll really want to kite them more than you tank them, on the flip side their mitigation won’t be nearly as high. Their mana supply is also an issue to consider. Druids with low-mana bases really can’t afford to shape shift several times in a short period of time.

Good druids will start bear form. Refer to the rogue stealth section if they try and cat-stealth you (it is a sign that the druid thinks you suck; even if their PvP gloves have stealth detection, it is a poor choice by the druid). Other things to keep in mind is that they can use their bark skin armor buff during stun, NG even in feral form, and bash has become more effective as dodge levels have dropped. Beyond their amazing mitigation, I have become more and more impressed with the bear forms ability to dodge/parry–fighting from behind is always a good idea against these guys. Constant positioning is a powerful and even necessary tactic.

In bear form they hope to survive your initial stunlock/dots/kite, and they’ll attempt to bring you down as far as possible without putting themselves in harms way of not being able to heal up effectively. They hope to catch you at a crucial point where you are possibly low on CDs (if you needed them), they have 30-50% health, and you are susceptible to traditional CC. It is here where they want to heal to full and bring you down the rest of the way. They’ll Bash->Cyclone, heal to full, and re-bear form. Expect to see Nature’s Grasp trix and well-timed trinkets. The longer this fight lasts, the more likely the druid is going to win. Finding druids who pop these CD’s at appropriate times and every time they are available is rare as well. We just don’t see a lot of druids that maximize their potential, beware of those who do….this is a class that has the potential to beat a lot of rogues if played correctly.

There are 3 tactics that should be used when dueling a feral druid:

1.) Stunlocking
2.) Evasion tanking
3.) Kiting

Knowing the gear configuration changes the effectiveness of each of these tactics, and sets priorities for the rogue. Stunlocking is always good, but if we go too heavy on it, then we lose the ability to punish a druid out of bear form. Evasion tanking is good, but it is both temporary and is most useful when attempting to dodge a bash. Kiting is also a two-edged sword, as it makes you more vulnerable to CC effects and a druid getting a heal off, but it is necessary against high damage druids. In the end, a combination of these will be used against a well-played druid.

Step 1–Preparation

As much as some rogue’s don’t like to use it: Wound poison…you need to stack 5 quickly and sustain that 50% cut in their healing. I don’t care if you use rank 1 wound poison or the highest rank. All that matters is that they won’t be healing effectively–in the end, a very good druid will get a few heals off, it is up to you how effective they will be in their healing endeavors. Healing is greatly diminished with wound poison, to the point that you can force earlier bashes, blowing fewer CDs and taking less damage. It is so important to keep them from healing that you should be using wound poison MH. Keeping their healing down is at a premium….12k hp bears (attainable in greens) that get a single full heal on you in a fight are 24k hp bears….and there will be times that you can’t stop them from healing.

A rogue really cannot afford to give up the ability to gouge->bandage or blind->bandage against a very good druid, and so DoTs must be used wisely. This fight is in part a war of attrition, one that will be lost when you can’t effectively heal yourself because deadly poison is breaking your disorient/incapacitate effects and also because they can effectively heal because you haven’t stacked 5 wound. If you do go the deadly route, then go all out, be sure to use Envenom. I don’t recommend this against a well-played druid. They’ll outlast your damage…they are a turtle. Breaking the turtle is best done with wound poison/crippling poison, not deadly.

Only at the beginning of this fight do we want to risk using DoTs, as the beginning only sets the tone of the fight, it isn’t until we are 20 seconds into the fight that we have to worry about CC effects. So, we are setting up for a warrior-type open; a garrote->5pt rupture is quite optimal. CS-Imp Gouging for pre-combat points is easy an excellent. They can still hit you with FF from a good distance, but with minor run speed and quickly running after the gouge you’ll always get your restealth. If you do get hit you can always CoS-restealth. Saving your premed, you’ll want it later in the fight after you vanish into him. If you choose not to use precombat point generation, then premed is just fine against these guys, just be careful to use those points quickly–this can be difficult when the druid is jumping and twirling around, as you’re open must be from behind for garrote (and many have stealth detection)…so you’ve got to use premed points in 10 seconds, but you can’t let them catch you in stealth for an FF. With FF preventing vanish, you may consider using it liberally from the get go, negating some of the utility of pre-combat points, COS does give us more flexibility though.

Step 2– The open

You prefer to save sprint if possible, as it closes the distance quick on a kiting druid, but sprinting in for the open is acceptable if it is necessary (you really prefer to save this though).

Some might prefer CS, and against non-bear tanks this is strictly correct. But, as a rogue can generally afford to not have to use gouge/sap/blind in the initial 20 seconds of combat, DoTing is a very effective means to deal some major damage to these heavily-armored feral units. On top of this, the druid fight is one of the very few in which I am greatly concerned with my diminishing returns. Opening CS->Gouge->KS eliminates the immediate future effectiveness of these abilities, and that can really come back to bite you. As usual, these are pseudo-warriors, don’t even open until they have no rage, and avoid the shouts. And, please, watch your castbars, you don’t want to open on a druid that has freshly casted NG (Nature’s Grasp). This also goes for the druids who think they are smart in HoTing themselves right before the beginning of a duel–just wait these out.

If you do choose to open stunlock, then consider vanishing within your KS and premed-Garrote-5pt rupturing. Assuming precombat points, something like CS-Gouge-KS-Yellow-Vanish-Premed-Garrote-Rupture-Yellow is fine. Be ready for the trinket on KS though (ouch). If you choose to DoT open, saving your vanish (with CoS it is another open, and that can be very powerful), you’ll go something like Premed-Garrote-Yellow-Rupture.

Step 3– Toe-to-Toe’in, Kiting, and Stunlocking

I generally give the druid a few seconds of tanking from my open. Why? Generally I’ll get a few hits in before they even join in on me, I’ve got the energy to blow, and I get a feel for their gear if I didn’t already inspect or visually identify what tactic their gear points them towards. Most importantly, staying in melee range lets you apply your poisons, and this is vital. You need 5x wound poison and crippling. Jumping through the bear and circle-strafing around him properly will give you his back. You really want to avoid both his damage and his frontal defense when possible. Get your poisons and run those DoTs.

If I see my druid is taking and dealing heavy damage, usually because they aren’t wearing their +defense tank gear, it is usually best to treat them like MS warriors. Go ahead and 5-8 kite (closer to 8 than 5 for the druid though), regen energy, jump through, stun and unload on them, and do it again. You want to beg their charge and bash early, and you also want to beg them to pop out of bear form for a quick heal. You want to catch them with their pants down, while running into unload and running back out to avoid his damage.

If my druid is a true tank, then I’m more inclined to tank them as well because their damage will be lower. Generally, you’ll want to be using rupture, but only when KS isn’t on CD. You can’t afford for them to pop out of bear form for you not to have KS when blind is going to fail on a DoTed target. And, when you aren’t rupturing you should be using gouge to bandage and regain energy. Toe-to-toe is more acceptable in this case because you aren’t likely to be bursted down.

Step 4—Preventing Heals and Catching them in Caster form.

Assuming his HP is getting low, it is going to beg a response. The first response from a druid with lots of rage and not perfect health is Frenzied regeneration. Good ones will blow this early to maximize effectiveness against your wound poison, with 100 rage (not hard to get) it heals them for a base 2,500 health). There isn’t much more you can do to prevent this, but winning before they can do it again is something you can do. If frenzied is down, they have three other answers in bash, charge and nature’s grasp.

At some point, usually around 50%, a druid will bash-Cyclone or NG (NG-Cyclone is common). After landing the fearsome Cyclone, a druid is free to heal, maybe even DD you, and get back into bearform. You need to prevent this at all costs. We have a few counters. In the end, you want to end up catching them in caster form with a gouge/KS/CS/blind if possible. Even a few seconds in against them in casterform is lethal.

The counter to bash is quite singular: Evasion. The higher your chance to avoid that stun effect the better. For DPS feral druids who generally take sizable damage from you even in bear form, but also deal lethal damage themselves, going evasion early is a good idea. Minimizing the damage they deal to you is very important, and conversely, their need to bash will come much sooner than a bearal tank’s need, early enough that going evasion while their at 75% will put huge pressure on them as you burn them down to 30% in the next 15 seconds. For bearal tanks you really don’t want to evasion until they get to 50-60%, otherwise they’ll just wait through your evasion and bash afterwards. If bash is dodged, then they are in serious trouble. They’ll be forced to NG.

The counter to Nature’s Grasp: Cloak of Shadows. For now I catch many druids with their pants down as they jump out of bear form because I’m 12 yards away, only to see my CoS into a blind on their caster form. It can be good to CoS-Vanish (as FF is now gone, and this is a rare opportunity to use vanish)-CS them. If the druid catches you CoSing out of NG, and doesn’t pop out of bear form, they’ll be stuck with their last resort, charging.

Charge is a root, but it doesn’t eliminate your abilities, just your movement. Vanish can get you out. Catching them with a gouge on a charge is most optimal. KSing is fine too. If they get away, blind is a good idea. Deadly-throw on a caster form is pretty amazing too. You might see charge before bash or NG even, just be ready to gouge it immediately. Otherwise they’ll kite away, pop out of bear-form for an abolish poison and an HoT, and pop back into bear form.

If you get him in caster form, he’s dead. Druids don’t come back from it. Unload on him in casterform. Even a 2-3 point CB-Evisc can be lethal at this stage of the fight.

You are going to eat some bashes, NG’s, and charges that will net the druid in a successful cyclone. Druids will get heals off if they play correctly. We just need to come back on them.

Step 5—Recovering

So, they successfully cycloned, or CoS/vanish was down on an NG, or you just saw them Abolish poison, and now you lost control of the situation and they went back to full health. What can you do?

Prep gives you all the options again. Constant gouge->bandaging is important. Blind->bandage is very good. You need to outlast him. Things like Mark of Conquest and Heroism card are very good in this matchup. Catching him on a gouge/blind (or even KS) at the end of FF duration might net you a restealth. Continue to follow through with the gameplan.

Tips:

a.) Restealths are good, they happen often enough with the help of CoS. Gouge-CoS-restealth can be of use.

b.) Be prepared for stun resists and trinket.

c.) Don’t be afraid to CB-Eviscerate very low-armor bears, you’d be surprised how hard you can hit.

d.) If you do use deadly, envenom becomes quite excellent.

e.) Watch for abolish poisons when they jump out of bear form. It periodically removes poison effects, rendering them unblindable (for the full duration atleast).

Summary:

1.) CS-Gouge-Restealth
2.) Garrote-Rupture-Apply 5x wound and Crippling
3.) Kite high damage and tank low damage bears.
5.) Counters his abilities appropriately.
6.) Catch him in caster form or kill him before he kills you in bear form (gouge/blind-bandage is good).

In the end, most druids really don’t maximize their characters’ potential. How many druids even use their PvP trinket to pop out of the crucial 5-point KS? How many are popping NG, bash, charge, and Frenzied regeneration every time it comes up? Each of these put pressure on the rogue, and often require us to blow CD’s in response (or even as prevention). It is quite possible for a bearal tank to live long enough to use these abilities a few times. Most of the time you’ll trounce druids simply because they just don’t know howto fight a rogue….seriously, premed-garrote-GS-rupture-evasion-rushdown will defeat most druids. But, should you meet one that does play correctly, you’ll need to be tactful.
Rogue-

The once awful mirror match is now not as bad as it once was. Pre-TBC, save for a dodged gouge or a stun resist, the open is really all that mattered at some threshold of gear. Once you met that gear level, any rogue could be defeated. With itemization changes, this has become a slightly more skill intensive fight than “get the open and win”. Don’t get me wrong, the open REALLY matters, as it sets the tone and pace of the fight, but it is no longer the tell-tale sign of a win or loss in a match. There are very few rogues that are pumping out lethal damage before the end of KS, and none of them can do it consistently (they got some really, really lucky crits). This will now, at the very least, be a matchup that requires CD’s if we do hope to 100 to 0 another rogue. With that said, there are a few things you can do to improve your odds of getting the open, and you should take all possible measures to make sure you get that open.

Step 1–Getting the Open: stealth and odd mechanics

The ability to see them first is 9/10ths the open for most rogues. Perception, potions, heightened senses, and certain pieces of gear can improve your stealth detection. There are also many effects that increase your stealth levels itself. MOD is obvious, but don’t forget boots, cloak enchant, Nelf racial, and a few other things can improve your stealth. In general, stealth detection seems stronger, per piece of gear, than increasing your stealth level itself. I highly suggest getting as much of both as possible. Put it on a gear-swap macro, you’ll find yourself using your stealth setup quite often in BGs, dueling, and even world PvP.

The other thing that helps greatly in getting the open is something akin to Belkin’s Nostromo N52. Now, while the n52 isn’t necessary for a rogue to play, it does make high-end play easier and more effective. In this case, the macro spammability feature is certainly game-breaking in the context of getting the open in the stealth vs stealth matchup.

Most rogue’s stealth around, trying to just walk past their opponent, then they target their opponent and CS. This is not what you want to do. Stealth was designed so that you are either a.) forced to AE the area in which the rogue is, or b.) manually target the rogue in stealth and then use an ability. The “bottleneck”,so-to-speak, for a rogue vs rogue, is in 1.) Actually having a visual of the the stealthed opponent, 2.) Taking the time to target (whether by tabbing or clicking on him), and 3.) Pushing CS about as fast as you can spam it by hand. The N52 gets around all three of these.

You can setup a macro that will allow you to hold down your CS key to spam CS faster than humanly possible for an indefinite duration (as long as you hold the key down or press it again, depending on how you set it up). What does this do?

It is an odd feature of the game, but if you spam CS at the n52’s amazing rate, you don’t actually have to target a stealthed opponent. If I am next to a stealthed opponent, my CS-spam will automatically hit them. Even better, the spammed CS will almost always hit my rogue opponent even BEFORE I have a visual of them on my screen. I’ve played without MOD and opened repeatedly on rogue’s with MOD just because of this CS-spamming. This is a serious advantage.

Assuming you didn’t just stand still, and you didn’t walk some obvious path, you should most likely get your open on another rogue using the tools above. So, step one, you’ve CSed your rogue opponent. What now?

Step 2: The stunlock

This is your standard stunlock situation–Always stunlock a rogue. Don’t be fancy here, no “rush-down” until you know you’ve won…you may not come back if you lose control of this fight. Your job is to stunlock your opponent from 100 to 0, or, if you must, rupture kite them while you are out of their blind range. 2x Crippling Poison is clearly the best poison choice. Use your usual stunlock, but remember you must keep 25-30e open before the end of your KS. You will need to proactively disrupt your opponent by the end of KS, or you will get a.)blinded, b.)gouged in the face, c.)vanish-CSed. There are two viable end-KS choices:

Blind–Blinding at the end of KS signifies that you are going all out, and to me, if used after you get the open, it is the closest to sure sign of a victory as we can say. You get to re-open, and that rogue is most likely going to die. This is the safe way. And, some might view it as cheap. My opinion: Do what it takes to win. That means blowing CD’s. Blind after KS (when available) is ALWAYS the correct choice in a duel against another rogue. (By the way, elusiveness now puts blind at a 1.5min CD.)

Rupture Kiting–This can be dangerous, but it is sometimes a necessary evil when we don’t have CD’s available, specifically blind. Rupture kiting is simple: apply rupture and get out of their blind range, restealth and re-open. Rupture prevents your rogue opponent from effectively restealthing. In the meantime, you seek to go OOC, gain some energy, and restealth. If you don’t get OOC, then generally you’re going to be vanishing in for the 2nd open and, hopefully, the kill. Your job is not only to get a restealth, but essentially to avoid an incoming blind that your opponent has been spamming since your initial CS. If your opponent blinds you, then they get to restealth and open on you (regardless of DoTs).

Rupture at max range, and rupture early in KS. You’ll need at least a small time buffer of KS-time to escape blind range. Be sure to test your build to make sure you have enough room after KS so that you don’t eat a blind. For example: you can generally get 2 Hemo’s in and rupture during KS, and still be far enough away not to eat a blind. This takes practice. Shorter rupture durations means you have less and less of a time advantage over your opponent, maximizing is good, but not at the expense of eating a blind.

Your opponent might bow/throw you to keep you in combat. He has 30% health, you have 100% health…just trade blows with him and throw back at him (keep your distance of course). A reasonable rogue opponent is not going to try and keep you in combat, as this is merely an exercise in futility. Sprint-Vanish will take care of these rogues too.

A good rogue opponent is going to do one of two things:

a.)Pop CD’s and try and open on you directly.
b.)Pop CD’s and run away from you, primarily to heal up and try again to open on you.

CoS, Vanish, and Imp Sprint all remove crippling, so be prepared to blow CD’s in response. My usual rule is to pop the same CD my opponent has popped. If my opponent vanishes (still has rupture on him), then I vanish. If my opponent sprints, then I sprint. You can tell when your opponent is going to let you OOC and when he isn’t. Be prepared to blow CD’s, maybe even pre-empt them.

For those chasing you down, the good ones are simply trying desperately to get a blind on you. If you can smell the blind, then just vanish…you can always circle for another minute to find him, and your next open will be lethal. Rupture-Vanish is perfectly acceptable. The problem is that they can escape pretty easily if you do this immediately. They can get just get out of crip poison and sprint out to restealth. If you do choose to rupture-vanish, then be sure to keep up with him, sprint and distract can help in this regard.

The reason rupture-vanish is simply not as good as blind is 2-fold. 1.) Diminishing returns on CS, Gouge, and KS (ouch), and 2.) Lack of energy (blind gives you 100, rupture-vanish gives you varying amounts, usually less). If my opponent is very low, I’ll often Premed-CS-CB-Evisc, and it ends right there. It is a difficult balance between DR/Energy issues and whether I let my opponent escape or not.

Always remember that even if your opponent does get the blind on you, he still can’t kill you in a single round (most likely). Use anti-rupture kiting techniques on him…and you are both even, only your CD’s are more likely to be up on the 2nd encounter than his.

The real problem I foresee is that at some gear threshold, since neither rogue can effectively 100 to 0, it is conceivable that many times both rogues will get each other to half health, and in fear of not getting the open, both will hide and bandage up their health to open, yet again, on a full health rogue. Endless cycles…I find this common in arena especially. Prevent rogues from kiting you is a major skill to have.

Tips:

a.) Sometimes it all turns into a real mess. Evasion isn’t a great answer, but at least they won’t be gouging you or really dealing massive damage to you from the front. Always remember to blow this when all hell breaks loose.

b.) Recovering from another rogue that opens on you means spamming blind and using anti-rupture kiting techniques. Remember that you can always stealth away after escaping from being opened on and find a comfortable place to quickly bandage/eat. This essentially resets the fight completely.

c.) Don’t use deadly poison.

d.) Be patient, don’t get lazy or frustrated when you are having a hard to finding them. Even circling that silly flag or what not takes some degree focus and concentration.

Summary:

1.) Get your stealth detection and +stealth mods on.
2.) Spam your CS open, and think while you prowl around. Don’t be obvious in your walking patterns, and if you see a safer place to be scoping out the area, then use it.
3.) If you open full CD, then win, if no blind available, then rupture kite. If they open, then blind and/or use anti-rupture tactics.

Priest-

A match that has become almost unwinnable for a shadowpriest and arguably easier for, but still not in the favor of, a holy/disc priest. Cloak of shadows and lower mitigation levels have made this a much easier fight for the rogue in general. On top of this, a rogue that is properly sap/CSing can frontload so much damage while maintaining a lock and severely stifling their healing that most priests simply can’t come back on you. Our main problems with priests in general are a.) Shielding every 15 seconds, netting no increased cast time from taking damage and, of course, +virtual HP, b.) Killing the priest before the 2nd (or 3rd for UD rogues) fear, and lastly c.) Preventing the kite.

I’ll first outline the open stages of the fight against all priests, and then I’ll elaborate on the spec.

Step 1–Getting the open on a zero armor target

Sap/CS is so powerful in dueling. Honestly, it is an abuse of the game mechanics, but I’ll take anything I can get. The priest is the prime target of this tactic. Here is where expose armor becomes useful as well, and the good part is that a rogue can put EA on a target without sacrificing his open!

Your routine:

1.) Sap/CS, restealth and wait for DR on both. (2-3 combo points)
2.) Sap/CS, restealth and wait for DR on both. (4-5 combo points, generally 5)
3.) Sap/EA, restealth, OPEN HERE.

Remember not to actually use your last sap until a.) they are 12-13 seconds from losing their shield (which won’t happen against most smart priests), or b.) they newly cast their shield. You want to either be really opening on a priest with no shield or the inability to cast another after you crack his shield. Shielding and fearing are chokepoints for anyone dueling against a priest, and so we really want to unload as much damage as we can before the next shield and/or fear chokepoint.

For sap/CSing, blackout-procs can be a pain, and also be sure you don’t deal any damage (even from weapon procs+enchants). CoS+vanish takes care of those problems though. CoS+vanish is a reset of the fight (only you get to keep your combo points).

Again, the n52 is so powerful in this matchup. I have this all hotkeyed. I sap and push one button and the EA through sap happens for me automatically. I restealth, and I’ve got a zero armor target for 23-25 seconds). Remember sap shares DR with gouge–Try and wait out the DR before gouging (if your opponent even lasts that long?). From here, the fight diverges into two different approaches:

Step 2 (Shadow)—Elimination of their damage+healing.

Shadowpriests put out some serious damage, and have the highest damage+healing ratios in the game. But, TBC has certainly changed this matchup. Rogues are in a much better position because we have the tool to eliminate the damage (and thus the healing potential) of shadowpriests in our beautiful Cloak of Shadows (some might even say cloak of skillz). At equal gear, a rogue should win this fight every time. Crippling poison is a must have (MH or OH, either is fine), and is acceptable in both hands as well. Preventing the kite is the game. A 1x of Mind-Numbing or Wound is also acceptable.

Generally, I’m just going to rush these guys down. They have 15% damage mitigation (after 5-point EA), and I’m in an excellent position to premed-CS-CB-Evisc them to half health right now. Stunlock them down if you can, but they’ll usually trinket right on CS. Be ready to answer a trinket+fear. Rush them down. Let them Vampiric Embrace+DoT, and then use your CoS (15 second CD on VE). CoS gives you practical immunity to their damage for 5 seconds and also eliminates whatever they just threw on you, it is most powerful in bridging the tempo advantage of a kite while you sprint up to them. They won’t be denting your HP, nor gaining any life back–they are in serious trouble. They won’t be coming back on you if you play your cards right.

As always, if you are having a really tough time, blind is your ‘oh-sh*t’ key. It resets the fight and gives you yet another open. Easy enough.

Step 2 (Holy/Disc)–Overcoming the turtle

This fight has become slightly harder for the rogue. Holy/disc priests are pretty decent turtles. Pain suppression, blessed resilience, and a few other talents make for a decent turtle. I do recognize that Disc and Holy are very different trees, but for now, I lump them together because it is the same basic gameplan: Prevent all healing, stunlock as much as possible. Catch them at 40-50% health with no shield or trinket and, if necessary, blind to restealth and premed-CS-CB-Eviscerate for the win.

Although you do want crippling on at all times if you can, what you really MUST have is wound poison. You need to out DPS their healing (and they will get some healing even through your wall of disruption)–wound poison cuts the heal to DPS margin in half (actually, slightly better including damage dealt by Wound poison). Wound MH and Crip OH is really what you want in this matchup. Sprint fills in any crip-gaps you might have, and shiv prevents most kite gaps from occurring in the first place.

You should still premed-CS-CB-Evisc on your open. Although, Premed-Ambush-CB-Eviscerate is good, it isn’t a stunlock. For the moment, you should CS even instead of ambush as it forces a trinket. Like a resto shaman, here you’ll sustaining damage, being sure to kick, gouge, KS, blind, deadly throw, and even vanish-CS all non-instant heals. Apply your wound poison as a source of pressure to both the time available to get their HP up, but even as a way to put pressure on their mana supply. 5x Wound Poison is a huge detriment to the very fabric of their spec and class, and they will not overcome it.

Proper responses to stun resists, fears, and their heals should still guarantee you a win. Don’t go too low on energy, because if they get a flash off, you’ll be sitting there even longer. Don’t go kamikaze to the point that you don’t have energy to disrupt their heals.

Use CoS Wisely. Generally, I wait to burn it as it can provide guaranteed opens alongside vanish. But, in this match, you could arguably just burn it early to have it ready yet again. CoS early on SW:P forces them to cast it yet again, using up their precious time and mana just to deal a bit of damage to you (and keep you from easily vanishing, not that you shouldn’t be capable of vanish-CSing in between ticks anyways). It is up to you.

Against not so great holy/disc priests you can go pure rushdown, against the better one’s you are fighting a slow war of attrition, one that the rogue will eventually win. Some fights will be slow enough that SnD is worth it, other fights are more concerned with bursting.

Tips:

a.) Proper CoS usage can be key. You should atleast wait for them to DoT you before you blow it though. Using in anticipation of a fear won’t be a good idea until the end of the fight.

b.) Never, under any circumstances let them kite you.

c.) Stunlocking, even if only a softlock, is STILL a good idea–so what if they have stun resist, tempo is tempo (any rogue who says otherwise simply has no idea how this matchup works).

d.) Try to kill before the 2nd shield, but make sure you kill before the 2nd fear.

e.) Wear your PvP trinket, have it bound to a key, and be ready to push it. Time lost during a fear kite is time you could have been punishing that priest.

Summary:

1.) Sap/CS into 5 points
2.) Sap/EA/restealth/Open
3.) Premed-CS-CB-Eviscerate
4.) Prevent kiting/healing and respond to fears quickly.

The shadowpriest matchup is considerably easier, and the holy/disc matchup is considerably harder before TBC. At equal gear, a rogue should beat a shadowpriest every fight, and should win the majority of fights against holy/disc priests.

Mage-

As always, a lightning fast fight, arguably an even quicker fight than before TBC as we both have access to even more tools against each. In general, with CoS, this fight is in the rogue’s favor, even against frost-mages. Non-frost mages should lose 100% of the time to a rogue– even played to their peak capacity, we out-CD them and apply far too much pressure for them to control us. While a fire mage is dead in the water when you blow CD after CD, the frost mage has alot more answers, and the longer the fight (as usual), the more likely your opponent is going to win. Your mission is to deal massive single blows at all choke points, prevent the kite, not eat their blasts, and as always, avoid getting polymorphed at all costs.

All mages aim to do one or both of these:

1.) Sheep you (without you having a trinket left) (the fire mage really wants this)
2.) Kite you using instants until you die (the frost mage will do this).

The mage and rogue are actually very similar in terms of the situational control and survivability we possess. We have answers and lots of disruption to use against each other. When fighting a mage, Blink, Ice Block, Blazing speed, PoM, Slow, Water Elemental, and Nova all require a rogue to blow CD’s/trinkets to effectively counter. And, if a mage is given a chance to use all of these abilities, the rogue will eventually run out of CD’s. Once the rogue is out of CD’s he is dead in the water, as he has no way to prevent the mages disruption, and, on the same token, will never catch up to disrupt the mage. The rogue must win before the mage can use all of these abilities because he won’t have enough responses.

The mage’s use of CD’s allow him to blink and shield/barrier enough times, burning all the rogue’s CD and options, such that he lives through each burst, and eventually overcomes the rogue. We trade CD’s to just get in range and deal any blows to a good mage. But getting past his CD’s isn’t your only problem. With each shielding he throws up, he gains virtual hp (like the priest), adding even more damage that is required of us to actually kill him. The longer the fight, the more often a mage will be able to shield/barrier himself, and thus a 7-8k mage becomes a 11-12k hp mage pretty easily.

This fight is NOT about sustained damage, it is about dealing lethal singular hits in between the choke points of iceblock, frost-nova, blink, and shielding. If you treat the fight like it is a sustained damage fight you lose immediately; this is completely about burst and disrupting/responding to the mage’s control features. The mages control abilities are mostly instant cast, and they happen in rapid succession, and so the rogue’s damage is choked through each of these abilities. We are forced to create opportunities to deal sizable amounts of damage in single shots. We aim to out-CD the mage, eliminating chokepoints before we reach them, and to deal massive blows.

Before we go on, I’ll go through possible responses to each of their abilities:

Frost Nova/Freeze/snare=Vanish, CoS, Blind, Imp Sprint
Blink=If sprint is already up, you can catch them before any major spell can hit you, assuming no PoM. I’ve even run the opposite direction to restealth from OOC in some cases. Vanish works as well.
Sheep=Avoiding it in the first place with Vanish, CoS, or any stun, Deadly throw for interrupt, and trinket if it hitst.
Ice Block=Depending on whether WE is out, turning off autoattack, either sit next/behind them and be ready to mash if they melt, or hit your special of choice at 0.5 left on their Ice block. Or, you can OOC and restealth. Killing their Water Elemental isn’t a terrible idea either if you’re combat. Be ready to blind the mage.

The good part about this matchup is that the more you know about your opponent, the better choices you can make. So, for example, if you know they don’t have PoM, you can use strategies that aren’t flawed by PoMable gaps, etc. The general fight is the same though, but as you’ll see that CD’s are extremely important in the frost mage matchup…probably to an extent greater than any other matchup.

Step 1–Setting up the anti-kite

As usual, 2x Crippling poison is best. 1x Mind-Numbing is “okay”…but, generally, the mages that you’ll have a tough time beating, frost mages, will be using instant casts the entire fight.

All mages will start the fight AE’ing. This can make your Sap/CS setup kinda difficult. Be patient, play like a stone cold killer. And, if you don’t get that perfect open, then just restart the fight with a gouge, vanish, or even CoS-OOC-restealth after they blink away. Even here, if you really want to win, I suggest sap/CSing. It saves you a premed, and that can be quite powerful after a vanish. They can Ice block through sap, and if you force a block by just sapping, well all the better for you! N52 spamming of sap is invaluable here. CS through sap if the coast is clear. For those who don’t want to spend time doing this (even though it is highly effective), you can just sprint in, premed-open and continue. Premed is safer, less frustrating for your opponent, and much faster, but it is not as effective.

Once you’ve generated your pre-combat points, either through sap/CSing or premed, it is time for the actual open.

Step 2: The Open.

Generally, like the priest, you either want to open when they have no shield on, or when they just newly casted a shield. Wait for this point.

A rogue has three opens to consider:

CS=2-3 combo points for 40e, forces a blink, keeps them immobilized for a split second, and usually gives you a second hit (like an Eviscerate). Can be used from any angle (a huge plus against those twitchy, ‘jumping around’-type mages that make positioning difficult).

Ambush=1-2 combo points for 60e and a massive hit. With talents, it is going to crit most of the time. Requires positioning and doesn’t control the opponent in any way (both of which suck). However, with MoSub, a successful crit Ambush-CB-(4-5pt)Evisc will flat kill any mage that isn’t packing stamina gear, and if it doesn’t kill them, they are at very low health.

Garrote-1-2 combo points for 30e, DoT, and THREE second silence. Three seconds against a mage is an eternity. This requires positioning. It is a DoT, so it deals damage, conversely, it prevents you from effectively blinding/gouging/sapping until the DoT is removed.

They certainly all have their strengths, and plenty of rogues will argue for each of them. I’ll admit a good rogue can defeat the most mages with any of these three. But, I’m more considered with what is the most optimal play. I’ll go in order of what I consider the strongest and explain why.

While I’m a control fanatic, and I do hate to say it, Ambush (especially with talents) is the strongest open you can get against a mage. Assuming precombat points, CS or Garrrote -> BS/Hemo/GS/SS -> CB-Evisc is strictly worse than just Ambush-CB-Evisc. All end with a blink into WE/Block. The question is simply, which dealt more damage before the turtle?

Against a mage, assuming pre-combat combo points, Ambush-CB-Evisc can easily see 5-6k damage in a single second. This is the only class that I absolutely prefer daggers in 1v1. As explained previously, massive singular blows win this match as it eliminates the viability of future action trees and the choke points that mages attempt to use to overcome our CDs. Ambush is a massive singular blow that is easily coupled with a 5-point CB-Evisc. If you have daggers talents, then this is where it is at.

I’m sure plenty of garrote fanatics will argue that “they can just blink away”. But, we have to really look at the time structure of the open->blink. Given latency and the small pause before a blink, you clearly still get a full 1 second against a mage after an open. This is a second strike against a mage before or on his blink (two hits). Certainly, garrote extends this to 3 seconds, and this is good, except Garrote really doesn’t do that much for you. Meanwhile, Ambush->CB (No global, just macro it)-Evisc will still hit every mage if you play correctly. It cannot be stopped when done from n52 spam with normal latency, and it puts on alot more pressure than other opens. It is 5-6k damage now. Garrote or CS leads into 2.5-3.5k damage now. All the opens will force a blink, the question is really this: what life total will they be at when they arrive? (And, will you be able to gouge/blind effectively?)

Cheapshot and garrote are actually nearly tied for a sub rogue. As a sub rogue, CS requires no positioning, nets you that 5-point CB-Evisc. Garrote requires positioning and nets you a 5 point CB-Evisc and 3 seconds of white + 1 tick of DoT. Against extremely twitchy mages, sometimes you might not have time or room for positioning. In addition, as I always sprint for my true open, I can often catch my mage on a gouge as I run towards their blink location post-open…garrote won’t let you do this. For non-sub rogues, garrote is the clear winner. Mut rogues get poison application and a mut in, and combat rogues can extend the silence to 5 seconds (AR early) with kick.

Choose your open. It is going to end up in the same place…the mage will blink, WE, shield if he can, and Iceblock when you catch up to him.:

Precombat points-Open-CB-Evisc. Just macro the open folks:

Open into a one-press, “take 3k damage” key:

/use AP trinket
/cast Cold Blood
/stopcasting
/cast Eviscerate

You want some mean damage to punch through. From here, especially if the mage is retarded (intellectually or lag), then you can maybe add some yellow to the frenzy. Unload everything you have until they blink. Just keep in mind that you’ll want to control the fight from start to finish keeping this mage on his toes. Be sure to shiv if you don’t see crip apply immediately.

The last part of the open is simple: know the direction your mage is facing and be ready to run in that direction while he is blinking. In addition, watch your castbars to know what he is casting, you may have a different response depending on what is cast.

From here, the fight breaks up into two trends. They will either poly/DD or instant you out. The first is usually from a fire mage and the latter from a frost. Look at their buffs and any debuffs applied to you, which type of mage are they? I will divide the fight into PoM/Fire and frost from here.

Step 3 (Fire)–Not eating the poly or the blast.

From the moment the fire mage blinks he will do one of two things: the good ones will PoM/Poly or just poly, the poor ones will PoM/blast or just blast.

If they do not PoM, then consider gouging/kicking/KSing. If you can land one of these hits before they hit you with their sheep/blast. If you don’t think you can make it in time or you see them PoM, then you have 2 options:

1.) CoS-reduces it to a 10% chance to eat a poly/blast, but sustains 5 seconds for you finish them or bring the fight back under your control. Unfortunately, as the fight is pretty fast, this will be the one time you can use CoS, so you need to make it count if this is your choice.

2.) Vanish-Premed- this is a guaranteed chance to not eat a poly, but if the mage is talented and you aren’t quick on the go, it is a chance for them to AE you out of stealth–usually CoC. On the flip side, most mages won’t have the timing to AE quick enough and you get a premed-CS on them for yet another 5 point eviscerate.

Personally, I’m already sprinted, and I prefer to vanish-premed into them, saving CoS for the rainy day…or for when I might lose control 3 seconds later. CoS has more uses that vanish, and CoS can’t be prepped. Better to conserve it for when it really matters. But, if your open is strong enough, you can sprint up to them and kill them within CoS, it is pretty common.

In any case, the mage is in a lot of trouble. Remember that KS is quite useful after a blink. It is a solid tempo advantage. They should not escape at this point. The fire mage won’t have enough control over you because you just won’t give him any time to use it.

Step 3 (Frost)–The control matchup

The frost mage is a pseudo-turtle. He isn’t a turtle in virtue of his direct hp or mitigation, but he is a turtle in virtue of his sheer survivability, shielding+blocking+nova/blink/freze/snare kiting. He will attempt to outlast you, pecking you with instants while he kites and reshields the entire fight. You’ll catch up, break through the shield, just in time for him to slip out of your grasp to start the cycle again. The skilled frost mage will not be using sheep, he’ll be aiming to kite and shield as much as possible while burning through your CD’s. The longer the fight, the harder it is for the rogue to win against a frost mage. With their 41 point frost talent, the Water Elemental, the mage will eventually out-CD us, overcoming our disruption, pummeling us with the control of kiting and peppering us with instants the whole way.

We are talking about multiple frost novas, ice lances all day (and they hurt when frozen), CoC+fblasts to keep us tender, armor to snare us, blinks to keep us blowing CD’s, a pet that deals decent damage and furthers the snare/root aims of the frost mage, double shielding which you will be forced to penetrate atleast once, usually twice, and up to 3 times in a fight–and on top of this they have the uber Ice Block. While it is not as robust as a bubble, it has similar qualities. Just when you controlled your way into an opportunity to deal some serious damage, the mage shuts down your gameplan, letting his pet eat at you, while he gets to blink to safety post block.

For a rogue to win, you must win in seconds. You want to force his CD’s earlier than they should have to be used at no cost to you. I always want to see early iceblocks and catching him with a blind before a coldsnap. If there was ever a matchup that daggers were just the serious bomb it is this one. It forces through so much damage before his next shielding, and begs an early iceblock. Sap/CSing is seriously a powerful tool here as well. Some frost mages will IB through sap (if they are stupid). Otherwise, it means you have premed for your followup open.

Basic lineup: Sap/CS-wait for DR-sprint-open-CB-Evisc-add as many hits as you can before blink if they are slow-

From here you’ll need to consider blowing either CoS or vanish. Which is it? I prefer to vanish against a top mage. We will see. Choosing between CoS and vanish is going to be up to how you are going to respond to their WE/IB.

A good frost mage will blink-WE immediately. WE is the monkey wrench. When you catch up to the mage, you’ve got a pet to deal with and an Iceblocked mage. Bad ones are Iceblocked with no pets, just restealth or spam on melt. To the WE mage, your responses:

1.) Deal with the pet and attempt to blind the mage out of IBlock.
2.) Vanish or restealth off, wait for pet to subside (mage will eat/drink up)
3.) Vanish off, reopen on the mage after block (avoid his AE): Premed-Open-CB-Evisc

Some rogues advocate blinding the mage (and I admit I do this often, but not because it is optimal in a duel, but more often because I know my opponent isn’t the skilled enough to have CSnapped out of block). The reason blind isn’t good is because a good mage is going to be spamming Coldsnap out of block. In the same way a mage cannot stop us from getting a 2nd hit in after our open due to latency and small pauses, we cannot stop a mage from coldsnapping out of block. As he controls when he breaks it, even if you are a miracle worker, he’ll still Coldsnap before Blind hits him. Your blind should still fail against a proper mage.

I’ve heard a few rogues exclaim the beauty of 1.), and in arena matches or BGs, I have to agree. This is the best route due to time constraints. But, in a duel or arena duel (1v1 left over), this is actually not the best option. Option 2.) or ideas similar to it are particularly strong in long matches. You burned his Coldsnap, WE, and Iceblock. You get to charge up and do it again. In arena, this can be very useful. You get blind and CoS back, and even vanish with talents long before they get their CD’s back. Using option 3.) is similar to its predecessor, only in eliminates the possibility of eating/drinking/shielding(in some cases).

From here, you’ll need to use CoS, vanish and prep wisely. A blind after his first iceblock (but before he may have coldsnapped) is very good if you are in range of killing him with a premed-Ambush or CS-CB-Evisc.

Tips:

a.) Good mages double Poly (even after the CC nerf). Be careful about trinketing immediately out of poly. You need to be watching his castbars so you don’t eat the second one.

b.) CoS is the end-all-be-all spell in this matchup. There are certainly pro and cons to using it early. If the fight lasts long enough, a 2nd CoS can be extremely demanding of the mage.

c.) KS can be extremely powerful after a blink.

d.) Deadly Throw can be absolutely spectacular. You can even activate Cold blood on it. Interrupting long cast spells (if they cast any), dealing good damage, and dazing them is really quite nice. With relentless, you can chain throw. Sap/CS-CB-CS-Evisc-Relentess-Blink-Start casting poly-Deadly throw….lol, hilarious.

This is a match that rogues should be winning, except against the best frost mages. Generally, it has more to do with your CD’s than your gear. But, timing, dexterity, and skill are king in this matchup.


Warlock-

We are the hard counter to this class. There is no class in the game that comes back on a warlock that opens on them, except a rogue. The introduction of Cloak of Shadows has made this match very easy. Huge drops in mitigation levels and warlock’s gearing up +spell damage, while often sacrificing stamina, means we have disproportionate gains in HP levels and pretty much buffed melee damage against warlocks as well.

Warlocks aim to use traditional CC methods and kite. If they can sustain their DDs/DoT’s, within the lock components of fel-intercept, fears, seduces, and deathcoil, then they’ll win in a pretty quick fashion. They are truly a fierce opponent against non-rogue classes, nightmares for most people. Luckily, stunlocking is extremely effective against a warlock, and almost completely eliminates their tactics altogether.

Regardless of spec, their DoT and DD damage is sizable, you always aim to avoid it. In addition, they tailor their play style with a pet. We really have three pets to concern ourselves with:

1.) Felhunter–High stealth detection, nominal damage. The counter is sprint and coming up from behind. Be wary of Fel’s on aggressive mode, as they will pull you out of stealth. Generally a weak pet against even a decent rogue.

2.) Felguard–A 41 point demo talent, the felguard is actually pretty good damage, I’d put it on par with an average hunter pet’s damage. What makes this guy actually troublesome is his stun intercept. Timed properly it can disrupt a stunlock and buy a warlock a DCoil. Be sure to evasion right out of your opener, it gives you avoidance and negates a great deal of the Felguard’s utility.

3.) Succubus–Back to CC 101. Seduce shares DR with fear, but it is quite powerful none-the-less. A pro will keep his succy far away, much like a shaman will keep his PCleansing as far away as possible. He’ll reinvis it asap as well. He’s going to try seduce/nuke you. Your trinket, wotf, and CoS are all good ways to break or make yourself immune to seduce. You can choose to kill the warlock despite the succy, or blind the warlock, kill the succy, and then deal with the warlock. Generally, it is better for a rogue to simply go straight for the warlock at this point, especially for all UD rogues. Sprint is invaluable in preventing kites, CoS can eat seduces if necessary. Additionally, seduce/fear/nuking is hindered in that the DR effects build up very quickly. Premed-CS-CB-CoS-Evisc+4-5 seconds of beatdown will kill all but the most stamina’d of warlocks using succies..

The rogue tactic is pretty much the same: burst him down within a stunlock. If the warlock is geared well enough, and my burst isn’t going to take them out, I prefer to save CoS for AFTER deathcoil/DoTs. CoS will eat his DoTs and give you a 2nd open. No warlock comes back after a second open. For second opens, when DC is down, Ambush is perfectly acceptable.

Step 1–Preparation and Open

Pretty straightfoward fight, 2x Crippling poison. Mind-numbing OH is acceptable as well.

Standard stunlock. Should go something like premed-CS-CB-Evisc. If you think they’ll be dead within 5 seconds, then feel free to pre-emptively blow CoS and kill them within that safety net. Mind you, a good warlock will not deathcoil while you are CoSed. Most anticipate that you’ll CoS at the end of a stunlock, and they won’t immediately spam it like they used to. So, if you know the warlock is good, don’t try and be slick and CoS his DC, just wait until after a DC and CoS. Depending on your situation, use a combination of CoS, Vanish, sprint, and blind to lock the lock. Pretty straightforward fight. Stunlock and win.

Step 2—Other warlock issues

It is best to save your sprint until after a fear/DC, primarily because if you sprint away while feared, you’ll have to sprint back, so there are no actual time gains from having sprint up during a fear. Assuming you saved it, sprint can be amazing in catching up to a warlock. Countless times after a warlocks opens on me, or DC’s me in a stunlock break I’ll just COS-Vanish-Sprint for the 2nd opener.

Stun resists are always painful, especially against a class that is unforgiving in regards to stunlock gaps. Once again, our advantage is SO large that vanish-CSing will make it seem like nothing happened.

Soul Link Warlocks can be a monkey-wrench type class. Yet, they are merely a shadow of their former uberness. SL-tanking took some major hits. You’ll see the glowing aura, and it is especially the case when you see that Voidwalker (VW) out. While their damage is substantially lower than other speccs, it has the strength of turtling. It is conceivable that we’ll see 20k-25k virtual HP warlocks in the coming months with SL. But 20k isn’t as big of a number as it once was. With lower mitigation levels, and rogue substantial CD-based burst damage, SL warlocks will still lose. As they can recast pets at near instant speeds, it is usually best to stunlock 100 to 0. You’d rather only have to eat through 1 pet+shielding than two. Blind seals the deal here.

Healthstones should be the in the back of your mind. While they might not be able to DC you during CoS, they’ll certainly be able to create a buffer with an HS that might last long enough through CoS to make you eat a DC.

Tips:

1.) Refer to CoS as “Cloak of Skills”…it is quite parallel to DC’s colloquialisms “Skillcoil” or “Lollercoil”..yes, it is that game breaking against this class.

2.) Kick all fears, seriously. No need to burn a trinket when you don’t have to.

3.) For affliction spec locks, you’ll notice they have a 2nd instant cast fear, an improved Howl of Terror (I.E. Psychic Scream). Watch for it.
Races:

Human: Watch for perception, it is 10-yards of stealth detection beyond what they already possess. You can come from behind. Sprint is good.

Gnome: Can break our snare.

Dwarf: Stoneform breaks all poisons and makes them immune. Goodbye crip/wound/blind.

Nightelf: 1xLevel of Stealth detection

Undead: Not much against rogues.

Orc: Stun resist, good gracious. Don’t let them talk smack if you lose a duel because they resisted 3 stuns in a row but played like a moron.

Troll: Not much to worry about.

BE: Possible to have a boost in energy if they blow their CD for it and have charges. Wait the charges out?
