title: 2019.05.11 - Prompted Introspection: Common Cold

!! How did your family fight the common cold? What was the 'cure'?

I spoke of what my old family did: [[2018.03.26 - Prompted Introspection Log: Fighting the Cold]]. 

My current immediate family does not get the common cold that often. We're not shut-ins, but we spend enormous amounts of time in our home together. My wife and I go out to work with a range of people, but we tend to give enormous space to people and clean our hands often. My children have exposure to the kids who are well enough to play outside, church, and people they meet while on a random errand. We got sick in Thailand constantly though. We have little practice fighting the common cold in our house. 

I already aim to make sure my kids get enough sleep (though I'm worried my daughter gets up too early on her own). My son has always had significant sleep problems since he was a toddler (adulthood might be quite difficult for him). Sleep and rest are my first responses. If they don't feel good, I don't feel good (though I try not to freak out; part of me is completely non-chalant whatevs [homo sapiens have been catching the cold for, like, ever, dude], but the other is berserking yet hoping my children don't feel my intensity). I make them take their temps, drink a ton of water, sneeze and clean themselves in semi-reasonable patterns, stay away from the kitchen, and attempt to make sure others don't get sick.

We keep soap and giant tubs of sanitizer in both bathrooms, pile up tissues on our desks, we don't share much food or our dishes anyway, and we live sedentary enough lifestyles that we can often still work just fine with the cold.

The adults are the most vigilante in interactions with the children. However, I'm less likely to care about transmission from my wife to me. If she's up for it, I'm going to kiss, hug, hold hands, and fuck her. I'd rather be sick than alone.

Time is the cure.
