title: 2019.10.31 - Prompted Introspection: Trophy, OK boomer

!! What kind of trophy would you like to win?

As a millennial, I've won enough of these to stop caring as much about them. Of course, Lady Melisandre, you are the trophy I'd like to win. How do I win it? Oh, I don't know. I suppose the "how I won it" is the important thing to me at the end of the day. My real trophy, of course, is the highest number of GBP possible, as that is the completion of my moralfag hedonic treadmill. Alright, fine, fine, fine: justified eudaimonia across my [[4DID]], and my life will be its own trophy, one which I would gladly live again and again into eternity.
