title: 2019.05.27 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Dangerous Classes

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Very commonly substances are criminalized because they're associated with what's called the dangerous classes, you know, poor people, or working people.â€¦ Actually, the peak of marijuana use was as I said, in the seventies, but that was rich kids, so you don't throw them in jail. And then it got seriously criminalized, you know, you really throw people in jail for it, when it was poor people.

These are old quotes. I think the peak of new cannabis is still rolling out as it is becoming slowly legalized. The Libertarians want it, so it's getting rolled out. Yet, blaming drug users for their addiction and escapism is radically preferred to decentralizing power. Substances are red herrings and arbitrary probable cause. Of course, those who simply favor legalization without paying heed to the class warfare built into it clearly guilty as well.

I am not convinced we will congeal. Class consciousness is being attacked, and we aren't dangerous yet. Most are pacified into being completely against violence (I'm guilty of this) or channeled into [[pright]] movements and conservatism.
