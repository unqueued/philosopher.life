!! About:

//I'm not trying to be asshole about it, but I think this is a moral requirement of humans in the 21st Century.//

Linux is only free if your time has no value[, but freedom is priceless].

Linux is not idiot-friendly, but it's profoundly poweruser-friendly. I'm part of the GNU generation, and I hope to learn how not to be an idiot with my tools and toys. This page is toolporn with a purpose beyond ejaculation. I can't list it all here, and every system is different. This is meant to be [[antipleonasmic]].


---
!! Principles:

* RTFM
* Categorize, replace, and curate. Build a sexy toolbox.
* Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Avoid the gates of hell; free your mind and computer with GNU/Linux.


---
!! Focus:

* RTFM
** TLDR - babby's first man page. Simple initial step.

* troubleshooting
** iotop - What's eating your drive's IO for lunch?
** powertop - Very detailed
** htop - standard top replacement
** iftop - network monitor
** bmon - network monitor
** nethogs - network monitor
** ncdu - make space by deleting shit
** discus - because df sucks?
** mtr - traceroute god
** smem - because memory measurements are hard to take
** inxi - list my hardware
** hwinfo - list my hardware
** hdparm - hard drive swiss army knife

* terminal/shell
** xonsh - bash+python=win, I feel like a ninja with this tool
** [[terminator|Terminator]] - umm, yeah, I'll pay the computational price for this much flexibility 
** antigen - making oh-my-[[zsh]] even more excuselessly easier

* package managers and glue
** npm - js just won't die
** pip3 - lazy whore ;P
*** pynacl - wiki
*** pyperclip - wiki
*** when-changed - crazy fucking lazy
*** py-figlet - pretty
*** beautifulsoup4 - TW parse

* file-handling
** dolphin - shame it doesn't integrate nicely
** mc - I adore the commander interface
** ranger - fast as fuck with sick previewing
** fzf - because search is hard, and I need speed
** unrar - because I often forget to install it
** dtrx - lazy as fuck
** p7zip-gui - the only client on any platform
** timeshift - backup when I want more than rsync
** truecrypt - sledgehammer
** veracrypt - sledgehammer
** SUSE Studio Imagewriter - bootable USBs; even better than DD frankly
** furiusisomount - once in a while
** exa - ls replacement

* remote files
** rslsync - Closed source, untrustworthy, the only fucking tool that actually works like it
** lftp - ridiculously powerful
** filezilla - when you are feeling stupid
** sshfs - cheap hack
** aria2 - curl alternative
** qbittorrent - it works

* virtual (private) networks
** sshuttle - ridiculous! =)
** shadowsocks-libev - high performance server
** shadowsocks-qt5 - fine client
** nomachine - remote access

* messenging
** weechat - l337
** hexchat - EZ
** finch - Not great, but you never know
** pidgin - Swiss army knife
*** pidgin-otr - XMPP sucks
*** pidgin-xmpp-receipts - See?
** toxic - goes more places
** qtox - functional
** keybase-bin - wish they'd decentralize further
** discord - I accept kicking and screaming
** signal - I don't trust it, but what alternatives will others accept?

* The Real Debate:
** [[nvim]] - seems 1337 enough
** subl - sublime-text2 is outstanding
** visual-studio-code-bin - when subl build systems fail
** diffuse - compare

* Virtualization
** vmware-workstation - performance
** virtualbox - tricks
** genymotion - sadly, the best I can find

* web 
** browsh - an expensive toy, a headless hack
** w3m - shows up at odd times
** firefox - dope
** firefox-developer-edition - I hope doper every time

* Network
** dnscrypt-proxy

* DE
** [[i3]]

* Media Consumption
** vlc - swiss army knife
** kodi - threatre
** calibre - the only option
** cozy-audiobooks - gross, but it works
** deadbeef - not pretty, but it works!

* Media Creation
** gimp - easy swiss
** masterpdfeditor - I guess it works?

* scripts
** [[dropbox_uploader.sh]] - Script to Dropbox API.
** [[lussh]] - Easy passwordless/keyed SSH

!! Dreams:

* Please, learn it!
