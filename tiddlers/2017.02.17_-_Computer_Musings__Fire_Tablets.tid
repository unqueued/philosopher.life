title: 2017.02.17 - Computer Musings: Fire Tablets

* 7" Fire Tablets with Fire OS 5.3.1.0 to plain Nexus Android
** Devs are making it harder and harder to gain control of these devices. I was lucky not to use wifi (and use it minimally when it was necessary for this procedure).
** I've never done this from Linux, but it turned out to be crazy easy on the desktop end.
** Found a great kit that said it sometimes did 5.3.1.0 after multiple tries (why it takes multiple tries blow my fucking mind, but it was true). 
** Root took quite a while, threw on some other stuff, and it took a while to find a version of FlashFire that worked on this device.
** I actually bricked the machine on the first ROM substitution.
** Thankfully, unbricking wasn't too bad. Grabbed an image and pushed it on the device while in recovery mode through adb.
** The second time went much faster, and I tried a slightly different ROM. Worked like a charm.
** It's one of the cleaner installs of Android I've ever used. It's very bare. I adore it.
** This was the second or third hardest time I've had taking control of a mobile device. This one was especially locked down.
* [[j3d1h]] was setting up her grandpa's VM to autostart on our HTPC. Whatever she did seemed not to work. 
** It was running hot anyways, so we took it apart, cleaned it, and attached the CPU-fan (which apparently needed some fixing anyways). 
** Whatever the problem, there was no simply troubleshooting. So, we actually just reinstalled. It took about 2 hours to get it all together, but it's basically set now.
