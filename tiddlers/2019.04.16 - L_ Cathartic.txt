How's your day been?
TUE 7:34 PM
Better than yesterday truthfully! I was a ball of stress yesterday and didn’t want to do anything.
TUE 7:44 PM
But that’s how my work at home days tend to be. Makes things much less “ugh”
TUE 7:44 PM
Noice. I'm glad. I know you had a ton on your plate.
TUE 7:44 PM
Telecommuting is awesome.
TUE 7:45 PM
So
TUE 8:03 PM
We have been living in our apartment for a year and still haven’t put up our anime/video game/puzzle art frames yet because we are still working to put our place together
TUE 8:04 PM
And one of friends got so sick of seeing our frames stacked up to the side that he is asking-not-asking to help us hang them xD
TUE 8:04 PM
Lol.
TUE 8:04 PM
It’s weird how cathartic it feels
TUE 8:05 PM
And yes, telecommuting is super awesome. I wish my coworker wasn’t so weird about it.
TUE 8:05 PM
Cathartic, lol.
TUE 8:05 PM
What made it cathartic?
TUE 8:05 PM
That is a strong word for it.
TUE 8:06 PM
Seeing that there are still piles of things that need “homes” (or official spots) or decor that hasn’t been hung up yet is subtly upsetting to me.
TUE 8:06 PM
But because it’s been going on for so long I think it was just kinda building up. It’s crazy how different hanging things up makes a room feel. .
TUE 8:07 PM
...weird extra period.
TUE 8:07 PM
I must a weirdo here.
TUE 8:07 PM
must be*
TUE 8:07 PM
Nah, I’m definitely the weirdo xD
TUE 8:07 PM
We have stuff hanging, but the only two objects I desperately need boil down to the chalkboard and the clock. So many of the furnishings in my life become irrelevant to me over time.
TUE 8:08 PM
I like my motherboards though, but that's just in memory of my monsters.
TUE 8:08 PM
I'm glad that you feel less upset and stressed about it though.
TUE 8:08 PM
Settling into home is a weird experience.
TUE 8:11 PM
I always find moving to be surreal, depersonalizing, and like I'm warping.
TUE 8:11 PM
I'm not used to staying in one place for very long though. I don't have the same kind of phenomenological and existential attachments, so that may play a part of it. That may affect you as well.
TUE 8:12 PM
Hmm... I’m not totally sure what you mean by the last bit, but I definitely am used to moving around a bunch.
TUE 9:00 PM
I mean that people who have roots have strong sensory experiences, emotions, and stable stories of their lives tied to the physical objects around them.
TUE 9:01 PM
Ah, that makes sense
TUE 9:01 PM
I have that with some things, though I am less that way these days
TUE 9:01 PM
It’s more my cheap jewelry as weird as that sounds. I remember who gave me what pieces and think about them when I wear them.
TUE 9:02 PM
I say cheap, but not all of it is. It’s just not overly expensive.... cheap was a bad word to use >_>
TUE 9:03 PM
I can appreciate that. They are the existential relics and talismans.
TUE 9:03 PM
I now feel bad to everyone who gifted my jewelry. RIP. XD
TUE 9:03 PM
me**
TUE 9:03 PM
Uh, I wouldn't. In fact, I think somehow treasuring that which doesn't have monetary value makes it shine more brightly in many cares.
TUE 9:04 PM
cases*
TUE 9:04 PM
I have a piece of art [[JRE]] gave me. I would save it if my house were burning down.
TUE 9:05 PM
I can recreate my monsters, but I can't recreate that one.
TUE 9:05 PM
That’s a really great way of putting it. I feel less bad now hehe
TUE 10:30 PM
I've talked some about it. I think you would enjoy it: Love, Death & Robots.
TUE 10:34 PM
That show is intense, beautiful, fun.
TUE 10:34 PM
Short too.
TUE 10:34 PM
Unfortunately short.
TUE 10:34 PM
The best shows always are
TUE 10:34 PM
I am surprised you haven't tried Aggretsuko, btw.
TUE 10:34 PM
That show seems 100% up your alley.
TUE 10:34 PM
I am a terrible curator, unlike my brother (who is practically an empathic god).
TUE 10:35 PM
Also, I'm drunk. I should drunkpost. What topic is most suitable?
TUE 10:37 PM
Last time, it was Boogerpicking.
TUE 10:37 PM
God bless them boogers.
TUE 10:37 PM
Hmmmm
TUE 11:17 PM
Do one about hugs, because I’m a squishy son-of-a-bitch
TUE 11:18 PM
