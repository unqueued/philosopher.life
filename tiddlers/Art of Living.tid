title: Art of Living

I am not convinced happiness is absolutely a result of mind over matter. Yes, what counts as the substance of happiness boils down to having the right kinds and degrees of computational, chemical, and electrical configurations in our brains. However, I think we our genetic, memetic, and other environmental conditions are the inputs to our computational minds, and depending on the inputs, you'll have different states in that black box and varying outputs. Obviously, there are significant feedback loop mechanisms and complex interactions between the mind-like processes in our minds, but externalities still matter. Achieving eudaimonia is no accident, although there is plenty of moral luck involved. Regardless of our circumstances, there is an art to living well. That sounds nebulous because it is. When we attempt to flesh out the content and methodology, we seem to only have more and more questions to answer. I hope that in time, I will have something valuable to say here beyond claiming that the [[Art of Living]] is an actual art we must practice.
