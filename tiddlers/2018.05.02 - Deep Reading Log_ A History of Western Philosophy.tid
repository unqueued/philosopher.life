title: 2018.05.02 - Deep Reading Log: A History of Western Philosophy

Duns Scotus and Occam were interesting. These are not philosophers I've spent any serious time looking at (and probably still won't from the sounds of it).

I hate to say that much of my bias has been confirmed about how much influence the church wielded over philosophical inquiry for these dark ages. It was lightning refresher that solidified it for me. 

I'm surprised by how little Russell has to say about the philosophical works of the Renaissance so far. Most of what is interesting, perhaps, isn't as philosophical in the ordinary sense as it is economical, scientific, political, social, religious, artistic, etc. I'm also hoping his most detailed account of philosophy begins here. Truly, the jump from the ancients to the moderns just wasn't important enough in my eyes.
