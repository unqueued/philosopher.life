!! Audit:

* I made a toolset for my son, but it hasn't been used. I would like to find a way for us to make more use of them than we have. This will happen in time, I hope.
* I started this later in the year. I feel like I'm not doing so well at the practice (not as well as when I first started).
* Perhaps I'm not using my evenings correctly either. I need to make sure I limit the amount of video I watch.
* My analysis is brief, but that's okay. You have to start somewhere.
* I think part of the reason these felt better in the beginning was because they aren't daily.
* I like when I'm specific in my logs. I need to find the right particularistic approach to setting my objectives (quantifiable preferred).
* These lists should be aimed at what I didn't already expect to do in a sense, or to when I have too much on my plate, it is a way to prioritize.
* I have been able to figure out that some things aren't worth my time by analyzing my To-Do-List logs.
* It certainly gets me into an idiomatic rut, a habit. It may also be the tool which helps me break habits in some ways as well.
* It's clear I've been consistently working to make sure my son is equipped with a good computer. I'm glad to see it paying off too!
* Since I've not been working, I've been hyperfocused on organizing our family's life cycle. It was kind of falling apart when I was working. 
* The kids have made tremendous strides in school.
* I've been reading with more aim.
* I feel like I'm reliving my past when I look through these. I remember doing them.
* I worry that if I become too dependent on this log that I will somehow fail to have natural executive functioning. Much of these things seem to be the kinds of things that others do without thinking. So, the question is: am I offloading this habit of planning in such a way that I am not actually integrating it into myself? Or, is this literally the training, and am I actually making progress into being a better planner and executor?
* D2 Dropped off the map
* More importantly, pipefitting seems to have dropped off the map.
** But, it can always come back if it needs to.
* "I clearly has an executive malfunctioning" - rofl
* So, yes, I have routinized my life, but have I really taken the best routines? Some of them yes, but not obviously all of them.
* I've been trying to get my kids to engage in the wiki practice for quite a while. I keep failing, but I cannot give up. They obviously need it.
* I like having titles! It seems to mark the day.
* I really do need more of a calendar for longer-term planning and a running honey-do list that doesn't have to be done today, but could be done whenever I need. I should habitually inspect that list though. That's part of the problem too.
* I spent a great deal of my energy on my children for math tutoring. I'm continuing to spend it trying to teach them how to swim, fish, farm, etc. for themselves. 
* Planning Inform the Men! has been incredibly fruitful.
* I can see the weekly cycles. I love the diving analogy.
* Ah, I can see that I'm also making some of the same inferences that my past logs made in this log. Rofl. 
* I can see that some of my important events lag on forever. I'm not taking myself or my plans seriously enough. 
* I like that I planned to reach out to people.
* The boilerplate, copy'n'paste To-Do-Lists may or may not be a good thing. I'm worried about it. 
* Meal planning has been excellent. I like being able to definitively answer my wife. I know when she comes home from work hungry, I want to have a plan. I don't want her to feel like it's up to her (although, I do ask her to help cook).
* I am just so fucking proud of myself. It's definitely not perfect, but I'm so happy that I'm taking the time to do this planning. I want to be systematic about my life.
* Moving from Cannabliss nomenclature to Bliss.
* That is weird that I must force myself to go outside. I think this is a good step forward. This is part of my checks'n'balances.
* We've remodeled many things in our lives since I've been home. Our technology is a big one. I'm very pleased to see everyone is taking more responsibility for their own data. This is the correct method.
* It took me too long to complete the application process.
* I'm still learning how to drive my car, and I literally am the only man who can drive it.
* I'm glad I take the time to demonstrate to myself that my life is meaningful. Even the small things. I have a tendency to look at the heavens and hells, to see the macro picture. I'm glad I fight the tendency here in this log.
* Clearly, I must read from atoms to molecules to see how my process flow operates.
* I anticipated having a job sooner. I have not. I need to.
* There are clearly days where I switched up what I was doing. I think I need to find a feasible way to analyze that. 
* One of my problems with only looking at simply this log itself is that I don't see how it ties in holistically with all the other logs. There are relationships that I am missing. I fear adding too much bureaucratic auditing, and I want to be wisely-lazy in efficiently auditing. Should I do a complete daily audit? Right now, I've got a skeleton, but not the unified flesh of such a thing. This is something to ponder.
* You did such a good fucking job. I'm proud of you, self.
