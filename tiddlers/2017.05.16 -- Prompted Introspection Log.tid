title: 2017.05.16 -- Prompted Introspection Log

!! What is your idea of a boring evening?

I am straight-up addicted to not being bored. I realize that being bored, from time to time, can be a good thing. I hate the feeling. I need another hit off the various kinds of "drugs" in my life (which is far broader than mere substance use, which I barely use at this point). Hell, even this wiki serves as a kind of drug, a constructive one at that though.

My idea of such an evening is frightening. I'm psychologically dependent upon not being bored. I need bangs and flashes, one after the other...

//God fucking damnit. Fine. This prompted introspection is inescapably useful to me.//

As I was saying (before I rudely interrupted myself, *ahem*), I need to be titillated, entertained, appeased, surprised, and constantly (with zero interruptions) have my attention focused on something interesting. I refuse to be bored. 

What are the negative effects of not living a life in which I experience more boredom? 

I really don't spend time sitting on the porch. Life moves too fast. I jump from one thing to another, and perhaps I lack the reflection I really need. Is it important to have brainfart, space-out, veg-out time? What is the use in just sitting there? What is the value in being bored? I don't mean to confabulate here. It is something I should investigate. 

Okay, so I'm committed to giving more literal answers here as well (even though the theory is obviously crucially practical). Um, a boring evening would be:

* Zero electricity or battery-powered objects
* Little or no light
* No substances
* No music (even from my own instruments)
* No ~~bored~~ board games, magic, etc.
* No books of interest
* It's especially bad if I have no one to talk to. I can survive such an evening just fine if I have people to talk to. In fact, I enjoy those uncommon evenings often enough. It's part of what has led to me walk and talk with my family more often (that sounds sad). 

I mean, being truly bored requires a kind of isolation from everything and everyone I care about (it reminds me of one of the better theological descriptions of Hell). Of course, I'm not sure if I can ever be truly isolated when I have myself in a way (conversing with oneself seems to be the basis of not feeling isolated and truly alone). Maybe being bored, to that degree, is a bad thing. 

There is the phenomenological question (actually many) about boredom. What would Heidegger say? His view, imho, seems far less laced with normativity, except his question begging about the superiority of the Ready-at-Hand mode. I'm not sure how useful that perspective is here, besides helping me identify what even counts as boredom.

Maybe the feeling of boredom isn't itself a good thing, but rather from a virtue-theoretic perspective, being someone who experiences sufficient quantities, time-periods, degrees, and kinds of boredom in the right ways at the right times, etc. is living, ultimately, a better kind of life.

Aristotle warns us about The Calm. Sometimes it seems as if he could be wrong. Diminishing marginal utility often seems like it is only kept in check by taking "tolerance breaks" from those thing which give us utility, joy, happiness, pleasure, hedons, etc. Maybe boredom accounts for a tolerance break that ultimately enables us to enjoy the lives and resources available to us in a more efficient, economical, and stable way. Boredom allows us to more effectively lick the spoon, suck the marrow, etc. out of life.

Is it conceptually possible to embed boredom in the notion of carpe diem?

Clearly, there is much I do not understand here.
