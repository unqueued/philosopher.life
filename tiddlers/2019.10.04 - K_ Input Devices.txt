Heck yeah ;P
OCT 4 9:39 AM
What you up to this weekend?
OCT 4 9:39 AM
Also, is [[L]] doing okay?
OCT 4 9:39 AM
Struggling with work as always. Itâ€™s like pulling teeth to get her to apply to new places. But sheâ€™s taking Monday off to put more applications out.

Gonna hang with friends tonight, dnd tomorrow, and working on midterm shit on Sunday. I have Monday and Tuesday off so those days will also be midterm days.
OCT 4 9:42 AM
Iâ€™ve started planning my annual horror story too. ðŸ‘€
OCT 4 9:42 AM
Also looking into adding Bluetooth to my desktop...

Any advice?
OCT 4 11:50 AM
Iâ€™m interested in just doing a USB dongle but it seems too cheap/ good to be true.
OCT 4 11:50 AM
I'm glad she's able to take a day off to do it. `/fingers-crossed` It's gotta be nerve-wracking and draining. 
OCT 4 2:07 PM
I hope the weekend will be joyful.
OCT 4 2:07 PM
I can't believe it's midterms already. This is insane.
OCT 4 2:07 PM
I like that you have an annual horror story. When you are old, you will have a large collection.
OCT 4 2:08 PM
Itâ€™s scary dude.  Life moves ever faster.
OCT 4 2:10 PM
Hopefully I can see clear change. ðŸ˜‚
OCT 4 2:10 PM
I've never added bluetooth to my desktop. It probably depends on the distance and application. I think I would go for the cheaper option first in this case, unless you knew it needed to be sick. I would be surprised if the USB dongle didn't work for you here. 
OCT 4 2:11 PM
I just wanna connect a DualShock 4 wirelessly haha.
OCT 4 2:11 PM
Nothing super crazy.
OCT 4 2:11 PM
Ah, so I don't know how much latency matters to your application here. That might be something to worry about. 
OCT 4 2:12 PM
I still head back to wired for my input devices because it comes up too often for me.
OCT 4 2:12 PM
I feel that. Iâ€™m trying to do some fucky things.
OCT 4 2:13 PM
I want to use our steam link to run a PS2 emulator, but the emulator wonâ€™t recognize the VIRTUALhere software on the steam link.
OCT 4 2:13 PM
So any controller will need to be connected to the desktop instead of the device in order to work.
OCT 4 2:13 PM
Lol. Hey, that should work.
OCT 4 2:14 PM
It doesnâ€™t tho! ðŸ˜‚
OCT 4 2:14 PM
I even got Steam to recognize the emulator.

Alright. Time to figure out how to damage my temporal lobe. ðŸ˜†
OCT 5 12:01 PM
This is really interesting to read about. Lol
