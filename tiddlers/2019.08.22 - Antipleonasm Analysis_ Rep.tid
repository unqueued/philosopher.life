title: 2019.08.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Rep

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The oppressed are allowed once every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class shall represent and repress them in parliament.

Preach, yo! I am, of course, in favor of radical representation in [[TOP]]. It is possible to construct governments which fairly, coherently, and reasonably represent their constituencies. That is not what generally occurs. The elite wear a democratic mask; they can point to a system which appears to be representative in name in my country. It is clear the wealthiest in the world have imposed the same on everyone else. I am guilty as well, and we haven't even attempted to unify ourselves with representation at that scope (UN, LoN, and others don't count).
