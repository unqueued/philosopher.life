title: 2019.06.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Just Come Out

!! Respond to the following gem:

just come out, state it straight, and tell the truth: we'll do whatever we want because we think we're going to gain by it. And incidentally, it's not American citizens who'll gain. They don't gain by this. It's narrow sectors of domestic power that the administration is serving with quite unusual dedication...

Rofl. I'm not going to engage in even a semi-formal analysis here. The people who might even eventually say "yes" to this are either going to say they don't care or they'll confabulate a reason to not care. Most, however, will either call you judgmental or a conspiracy theorist for such a thing. How dare you, fucking commie! It's malicious ignorance. [[Saint Chomsky]] does a great job of reminding me both that I absolutely hate most people, and yet I know there are a handful of people worth our sacrifice.
