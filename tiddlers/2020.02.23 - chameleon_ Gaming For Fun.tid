"""
[5:33 PM]  h0p3: How'd FNM go, and how's your weekend been?
[5:33 PM]  h0p3: (Commander looks like a ton of fun)
[5:33 PM]  chameleon: I ragequit tbh, lol
[5:33 PM]  chameleon: lost to the abyssal, made me feel bad
[5:34 PM]  chameleon: then I lost again, and got salty
[5:34 PM]  chameleon: so I dropped
[5:34 PM]  h0p3: Sorry. That sucks. :frowning:
[5:34 PM]  h0p3: I know that feel.
[5:34 PM]  chameleon: I have no idea what happened tbh
[5:35 PM]  h0p3: I think that's normal, at least for me. I'm there to have fun, and if I'm not having fun, it's okay to walk away.
[5:35 PM]  chameleon: yeah, you're right
[5:36 PM]  chameleon: thanks. I actually really needed that. haha
[5:36 PM]  h0p3: :heart:
[5:36 PM]  chameleon: you know what it is? Ironically. I think it's my time of the month
[5:36 PM]  chameleon: like, HRT gives trans girls a period same as cis girls (no bleeding, but I get pms and shit)
[5:38 PM]  h0p3: It is an important cycle in the human species. I consider my wife's period to be a small kind of shit-test which occurs right before ovulation which allows me to demonstrate my devotion to her, me being a safe person for her in vulnerable times, etc. I think there is a dialectical component to this chemical reaction in our species which provides a heart-beat, a tick-tock for social computation, and it is likely part of how we are social.
[5:38 PM]  chameleon: interesting!
[5:38 PM]  chameleon: my husband was very kind to me
[5:38 PM]  chameleon: and even the dude I lost to seemed to sense the mood. he gave me a hug
[5:39 PM]  h0p3: Fam
[5:39 PM]  chameleon: which was much appreciated haha
[5:39 PM]  h0p3: (that said, I still adore the table-flipping MTG vidyas)
[5:39 PM]  chameleon: hahaha
[5:39 PM]  chameleon: >when you find out "put X cards in hand" doesn't count as drawing
[5:41 PM]  h0p3: rofl
[5:44 PM]  chameleon: this video is hypnotic tbh
[5:44 PM]  chameleon: I've put it on loop before
[5:44 PM]  chameleon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zkz6djMHIc here's the original
