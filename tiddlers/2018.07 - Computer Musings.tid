!! Audit:

* I <3 zsh. I'm wishing I installed it almost first. 
* I still haven't setup my VMs or vpncloud.
** Hell, there's plenty of software I don't have put together yet. That's okay.
* Alsa was driving me insane.
* It took a couple weeks to get everything the way I wanted it. This is one of the longest rebuild processes I've ever had. That said, it's wildly more ergonomic too. Furthermore, I tweaked KDE for a very long time. I should remember that it didn't happen overnight.
* I have had a lot of ISP and electrical problems lately. =/
* It's been a busy month for this log.
