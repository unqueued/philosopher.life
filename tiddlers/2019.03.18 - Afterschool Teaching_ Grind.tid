title: 2019.03.18 - Afterschool Teaching: Grind

Whitney showed up way early today again. I consistently ask everyone how they are doing. I know her schedule now, so I ask her about her classes for the day. 

Wonderfully Mattless.

We couldn't find some of our paperwork because our highschoolers shuffled the room around. I spoke to them, and they gave me a weird look. I've obviously missed something.

I have a new student: 5CM. His ESL teacher spoke with me. It was an interesting encounter with her. I gave her all my lasers, and that was offputting for her (sorry: I'm listening to you). The boy hasn't turned in any homework this year. She thinks I should read his questions out loud to him. He speaks well, and I'll find out about his reading skill. I do not hand answers to people in many cases, and I do make them work for it; even my weak readers seem to manage with encouragement. In any case, we thanked each other, and now 5th grade is even larger. I wonder what's happening in the faculty meetings to spur this.

I met the kid, and did my usual rounds. I was careful to question him after he saw me interrogate others to give him a chance to prepare. Sounds like his parents can't speak English, and he's got no one to hold him accountable.

5NP tells me that he's not allowed to be under my care. Mitchell and Delp sorted him out. That said, I so rarely deal with him already. I understand: I'm harsh, brutal, unforgiving of purposely failing to do your best, etc. Tough titties, kid. You have to do your work; you have to learn to code too. I've been (still am?) in the school of hardknocks. He sees quite a range from me too. Don't have to like me; I'm going to help you.

I continue to grab Mitchell to know what he wants. I never know if I can rely upon him to be there, so I have to let him call the shots. Mitchell and Whitney took 5th, I took the other 3 grades.

The girls who read are given absolute latitude, and I aim to preserve their right to read in peace. People finished homework quickly. Most choose to draw. They have some fancy paper today.

6AB asked me to define the word "complexity." Oh, they'll learn to stop asking me questions someday. Although, funny enough, my own still risk it again and again everyday.

6JK continues to receive a free pizza from the ballplayers. It is a frenzy.

7Jm is spending my spoons fast. I'm grateful to have student reinforcement. He is the 80/20 today.

I took over the kids still working in the library. A handful of students from the gym also came with me. We finished off our work. I'm having a hard time convincing people to read. 

We played with the infinity cube. I can tell who actually likes fidget toys and who doesn't immediately.

5KB and 5Af each played chess with me. Afterward, we had an impromptu solo singing talent show. I have reminded these students that if adults see them with their phones, they will get in trouble. 

5Af claims they ran off the last person who had my position because she was weird. She was proud of it. She wasn't so concerned with my weirdness. We got into a discussion about OCD. I was then interrogated about my education. 

Several of the students spoke with me about anxiety. I believe it; look at the forces in their lives. Jesus. It's hard to see these kids struggle. I am honored that they speak to me at all.

I continue to receive lots of questions about what I'm writing and why. 

I didn't have an opportunity to speak with my favorite adults. That sucks. =/ Well, tomorrow maybe!
