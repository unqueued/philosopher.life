title: 2018.08.05 - Prompted Introspection: Another Period

!! If you were born in another time, what time would you choose and why?

I swear I've answered a question like this before (perhaps more than once). I can't seem to find it (I need to get better about that). I'm not sure. Anywho...I can't see into the future, so I can't make a reasonable judgment. I can't think of a time in the past.

I'd probably ask to be born before my donors met. That would ensure I had different parents. I'd be a bit older, but still very marriageable to my wife (despite the fact that she likes them young<<ref "1">>). If time and space are deeply connected, I suppose I could be a radically different person. I still need to find my wife. This becomes really complicated in a bunch of ways. I love my family, and I don't know how to recreate them (and I couldn't for a bunch of reasons). Do I just choose 1 second before or after I was born before to maximize the odds (butterfly effects set aside) to meet them? How do I know the odds of reaching these people are even reasonable? There are so many unanswered and unanswerable questions here.

<<footnotes "1" "As I've said to her before, if she ever gets a time machine, 9 is the earliest version of me which could consent to banging her, imho. She'd be 18 at the time. Sounds pretty awesome.">>
