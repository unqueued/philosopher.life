title: 2019.07.31 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Titanic Copernicus

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The wreck of the Titanic functions as a sublime object: a positive, material object elevated to the status of the impossible Thing. And perhaps all the effort to articulate the metaphysical meaning of the Titanic is nothing but an attempt to escape this terrifying impact of the Thing, an attempt to domesticate the Thing by reducing it to its symbolic status, by providing it with a meaning. We usually say that the fascinating presence of a Thing obscures its meaning; here, the opposite is true: the meaning obscures the terrifying impact of its presence.

I've gotta hand it to Sir Žižek, I have to put everything on the line when I wrestle him. I appreciate our commitments.

I will admit that The Sublime instantiates or inheres in all objects to various [[dok]]. The Titanic has hyperobject status and serves as an existential intuition pump. What I see in the argument is something restricted to [[The Great Human Conversation]], as though meaning were simply a nebulous construction. You do not get to help yourself The Sublime without paying all the explanatory and justificatory tentpeg costs in dialectics at this level. Since anything can be surd-elimed (a logical consequence of [[The Dialetheia]] for the [[fff]]), I expect (though I do not predict) radical integrity and humility in what we construct in that space. Even the Bayesians beg the question of [[faith]], and thus one of my goals in intersubjective dialectics is to eliminate the attack surface because I know psychopaths are quite real: capitalism selects for them. Outgrouping cannot be escaped, not even with our own selves! 

There is irony in the conclusion, bordering on incoherence (and surely you will say the same of me). The Titanic points to [[The Infinite]], but you will only ever be able to reductively, incompletely, and [[fff]]ingly symbolize [[It]]. I don't think we should feel bad about our plight here. It is a matter of speculative realism to get beyond this correlationist representation problem, right? I'll agree there is something unfathomable about how the Thing-in-[[Itself]] obscures its meaning and being because it creates the possibility of any meaning and being. I do not deny the subject's role either, but one has primacy and finality while the other is fundamentally more instrumental and perhaps less real.

I favor deflationary approaches to metaphysics which still buy [[Straussian]] Platonic metaphysics whole hog. The terrifying impact is that we aren't the center of reality. We keep fighting against that Copernican revolution.
