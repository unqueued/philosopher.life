!! Audit:

* I see plenty of dead links. As weird as it sounds, I'm very pleased with that.
* My content has been ridiculously explosive this month. I've become more and more willing to graft content in. I'm glad I have. Centralizing this data has been useful.
* I've been generating [[antipleonasmic]] names. Lots of little tiddlers to make life smoother. I like that.
* I want to point out that I've been making serious timestamp errors lately. I'm not sure why.
* Since I spend so much time in my wiki, it's clear that a non-trivial portion of my [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] content is also found in this log.
* I'm meme-ing to myself quite a bit. In fact, there's a lot of gutteral reactions here. It's less analytical than usual, imho.
* I love that I do this log. It really forces me to think about what I'm doing and what I've done. Not everything matters, but this log really adds up.
* title.Titles are almost [[/b/]]ish in their bravado
