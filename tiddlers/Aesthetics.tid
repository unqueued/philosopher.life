All art preserves mysteries which aesthetic philosophers tackle in vain.

-- Anthony Burgess

The purpose of art is expression...[A]rt becomes more human and valuable in proportion to its intellectual content. This does not deny that excellent technique may express triviality, evil, and insanity. It asserts, however, that what should be expressed is rational and intelligent.

-- Gordon H. Clark

No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles, nor to prescribe in any way the character of the questions investigated. Neither may a government determine the aesthetic value of artistic creations, nor limit the forms of literacy or artistic expression. Nor should it pronounce on the validity of economic, historic, religious, or philosophical doctrines. Instead it has a duty to its citizens to maintain the freedom, to let those citizens contribute to the further adventure and the development of the human race.

-- Richard Feynman

Aesthetics is merely an undiscovered force, expressed by a yet un-devised mathematical equation.

This is precisely what is decisive in Nietzsche’s conception of art, that he sees it in its essential entirety in terms of the artist; this he does consciously and in explicit opposition to that conception of art which represents it in terms of those who “enjoy” and “experience” it. That is a guiding principle of Nietzsche’s teaching on art: art must be grasped in terms of creators and producers, not recipients. Nietzsche expresses it unequivocally in the following words (WM, 811): “Our aesthetics heretofore has been a woman’s aesthetics, inasmuch as only the recipients of art have formulated their experiences of ‘what is beautiful.’ In all philosophy to date the artist is missing.” Philosophy of art means “aesthetics” for Nietzsche too — but masculine aesthetics, not feminine aesthetics. The question of art is the question of the artist as the productive, creative one; his experiences of what is beautiful must provide the standard.

-- Saint Heidegger

There can be no question of selecting in any direction, but of a penetrating the whole cosmic law of rhythms, forces and material that are the real world, from the ugliest to the most beautiful, everything that has character and expression, from the crudest and most brutal to the gentlest and most delicate; everything that speaks to us in its capacity as life. From this it follows that one must know all in order to be able to express all. It is the abolition of the aesthetic principle. We are not disillusioned because we have no illusions; we have never had any. What we have and what is our strength, is our joy in life; our interest in life, in all its amoral aspects. That is also the basis of our contemporary art. We do not even know the laws of aesthetics. That old idea of selection according to the beauty-principle Beautiful — Ugly, like to ethical Noble — Sinful, is dead for us, for whom the beautiful is also ugly and everything ugly is endowed with beauty. Behind the comedy and the tragedy we find only life's dramas uniting both; not in noble heroes and false villains, but people.

To make the material speak to man in the name of man, this is the aim and reality of art.

A’s papers contain a number of attempts to formulate an aesthetic philosophy of life. A single, coherent, aesthetic view of life can scarcely be carried out. B’s papers contain an ethical view of life.

-- Saint Kierkegaard

For art to exist, for any sort of aesthetic activity or perception to exist, a certain physiological precondition is indispensable; intoxication. Intoxication must first have heightened the excitability of the entire machine: no art results before that happens.

-- Friedrich Nietzsche

<<<
The World and Life are one. Physiological life is of course not "Life". And neither is psychological life. Life is the world.
Ethics does not treat of the world. Ethics must be a condition of the world, like logic. Ethics and Aesthetics are one.

-- Saint Wittgenstein

Aesthetics is for the artist as Ornithology is for the birds.

* Definitions/Conditions
** Theory of Beauty, Taste, or Philosophy of Art: it has to define art.
*** Can designate a kind of object, judgment, attitude, experience, or value.
*** Taste is habituated, conditioned, concerned with elite cultural values.
** Examines subjective and sensori-emotional values, judgments of a specific kind of sentiment or in a specific manner
** Aesthetics is either art as knowledge or art as action, but aesthetics is neither epistemology nor ethics
** Six Conditions for the presentation of art: 
*** beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation
** Six (not obviously universal) signatures in human aesthetics:
*** Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.
*** Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
*** Style. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
*** Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
*** Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
*** Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.
** Concepts/ideas in sensuous form reflect two things: the meaning of objects in contemplation (meaning is at least partially in virtue of our own spiritual nature) and power of the object in virtue of the artist as vehicle for the idea.

* Kant's aspects: freedom from concepts, objectivity, disinterest of the spectator, and obligatoriness.
** Beauty is a symbol of Morality
*** Judgments of pure beauty, being selfless, initiate one into the moral point of view.
** The enjoyment of nature is the mark of a good soul.
*** Beholder harmony. Evolutionary story, but Daseinic categories appear more universal and narrow than human categories. We have to be [[Straussian]] on his behalf. 
** Some beauty is simply subjective, and some universally beautiful to everyone.
** Beauty can be for enjoyment, but judging something to be beautiful requires reflective contemplation.

* Aesthetic Formalism: the content of a work of art is not of aesthetic interest.
** Fine Art has the appearance of freedom from being too cognitively tied to concepts.
** Harmonious cognitive free play with an object
** Pure [[Beauty]] in an object maintains our ray of intentionality without further contemplation.
*** Thus, it is an end in itself.
