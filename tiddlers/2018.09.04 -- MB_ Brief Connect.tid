 Hey, you aren't talking to me! =)
Sun 11:44 AM
 You must be super busy, lol.
Sun 11:45 AM
 Hey! I have been. What have you been up to ?!
Sun 11:45 AM
 About to watch that link you sent!
Sun 11:45 AM
 I've been good. Letter writing to lots of people on the interwebs. Interesting conversations. Working hard on the wiki, as usual.
Sun 11:46 AM
 How about  you? How's life going?
Sun 11:46 AM
 You watch Baraka?

 Life is good and busy. Lots of birthday parties and get together now that summer is winding down. People are starting to come back to town. 

This stuff makes great background music! Chill enough I don't focus but not boring so that it wastes my ears time. 

I haven't watched it yet, have you?

 I've seen it a couple times before. I tried the short film, but it just wasn't the same for me.

Called her tonight. Dinner. She called back. We talked about how life was going. She's taking her anti-anxiety meds again, keeps her sleepy. Still doing the late night thing. I know the night owl. We talked about a book she was reading and hating. She's growing to like non-fiction more (which is unexpected, imho). 

She was having a hard time staying awake. We talked about school with the kids. I talked about the wiki a bit. I don't think she's really taken a look. That's a shame. I've talked to her about this thing for over 1.5 years, and I've worked my butt off on it. I don't understand how someone who reads so much wouldn't try to see/understand what I'm doing here. I think there is work here she would like... I'm sure I'm missing something important.

She said she was interested in the conversations I was having, so I told her to check out [[Find The Others]] off [[Hub]]. I'll be interested to see if she follows through.

She said she'd be a good friend and call me back this week. Lol. It's true, my phone records show that I am doing almost all the attempts at connecting with her. There is a deep asymmetry here.
