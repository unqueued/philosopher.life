<<<
Thats a pretty cool way to introduce yourself.

Thanks. I hope it will be expressive and functional. Building relationships over a wire isn't easy, imho. This method has some valuable properties to it. Hopefully I'll figure out how to do so more effectively. I aim to have [[hyperconversations|2018.08.23 -- kickscondor: Hyperconversations]] enriched by referencing other parts of my wiki.

My self description is as a critical theorist who embraces a broadly left liberal/democrat outlook on politics,
<<<

This I have gathered. I do not have a critical theorist's background, but I'm learning. In fact, I've had to unlearn a great deal about critical theory (coming from a background which has been egregiously uncharitable to the continental tradition), which I've come to admire more and more over the years. You'll have to forgive my ignorance (and the accompanying arrogance). 

I read your [[recent article|https://merionwest.com/2018/08/29/standing-by-my-criticism-of-canada-in-decay/]]. I have nothing of substance to add. Hagiographic is a great word. Shit's gettin' real, yo. Good to see you're making enemies for the right reasons.

 while being pretty close to Whitehead/ Schelling ontologically, and an epistemological pragmatist. Not sure if that makes any sense but then, given my influences, may it is better that it doesn't all fit together.
<<<

These I did not gather. Perhaps I should have from your writings. I'm still working my way through them. If you have any pieces you consider to be more representative of yourself than others, please let me know. Despite what little knowledge I have in those areas, I can see how these positions would also have impact on your political philosophy.

Obviously, I fail to understand your influences since I'm not sure why it would be better they don't fit all together. These may be some very important philosophical differences between us, I do not know.

I teach these subjects at the university, which of course doesn't mean I know how to deal with them on my own time.
<<<

How are you liking teaching? 

I found teaching at university helped solidify my ability to rehearse and forced me to take up a few positions (revising my philosophy of religion perspectives quite a bit too). I felt uncomfortable exploring with my students beyond what they bought to the table. I can barely teach myself at the end of the day though.

You have a realpolitik bent in your publishing. Perhaps that is how you are dealing with it, in a sense.

Why the wiki by the way, and the kind of retro 80s style. It reminds me a bit of vaporwave.  

Matt

{[[Help]]} and {[[About]]} are the best answers to "why a wiki" I can give you. 

The vaporwave aesthetic isn't where most of the art of the wiki comes into play, imho, but it serves the functional aspects I need. The terminal feel is what's easiest on my eyes (although, I understand many people abhor it). I use a custom narrow-width monospace font (I often work with very large bodies of text), and I want links and footnotes to stand out to me strongly (I'm colorblind, and I do a lot of work in the dark).
