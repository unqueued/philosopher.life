title: 2019.08.31 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Crypto-Cratylian Kripkean Zizekianism

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The Real is therefore simultaneously both the hard impenetrable kernel resisting symbolization and a pure chimerical entity which has in itself no ontological consistency. To use Kripkean terminology, the Real is the rock upon which every attempt at symbolization stumbles, the hard core which remains the same in all possible worlds (symbolic universes); but at the same time its status is thoroughly precarious; it is something that persists only as failed, missed, in a shadow, and dissolves itself as soon as we try to grasp it in its positive nature... like a traumatic event constructed backwards.

Ah, finally, I don't have to hunt for evil in your words. Your opening claim is [[beautiful]]. This is much closer to the truth. Of course, it is ontologically consistent: we simply don't know [[W5H]] to [[infinigress]]; you have no right to contend otherwise without destroying your right (surely you know that too). I am, of course, one [[arrogant]] sumbitch. You may not describe something as indescribable or deny the consistency of [[It]] without denying your own by definition, but you ought admit it dialectically sublates everything else all the way into something which appears to be a paradoxically true contradiction (painful words to utter as a philosopher, no doubt). I think we can interpret you to be saying that here.

You mean to say, every //finite// attempt at symbolization of the big ball of modal necessity found in all possibly possible worlds will be incomplete by definition. Preach, yo! Only [[The Infinite]] can compute [[Itself]]. Of course, correspondence is unsatisfying, and beholding the thing-in-itself, especially this Thingiest Thing-In-[[Itself]], will never be had with certainty: it requires a leap of faith and an acceptance of our [[fff]]itude all the way down into an abyssal [[infinigress]] that seems [[hope]]less into meaninglessness to a skeptic (all the rage again since Kant's enchanting of the epistemic vortex in [[The Great Human Conversation]]). It is why some realists feel compelled to quietly and hedged-conservatively call themselves //speculative// realists these days. We are losers. =)

The precarity of this Wittgensteinian ladder, this rule-following problem (even amongst the selves which comprise our [[4DID]]), [[The Foundation]] problem in its various reincarnations is as old as [[naming]] and signs for Dasein. It is traumatic. Too often, the dialectics with the facelessness and magnitude of [[The Other]] forces us into [[awe]], isolation, frozen overloaded self-destructing bracketing, and existential despair. It is dialetheistically impossible, so why try, right? It's easy to get down on your knees before a mirage in the desert; it is our plight to stand back up.

Fuck it. {[[About]]} is [[right]]. It's time to wrestle and wander.<<ref "p">>
