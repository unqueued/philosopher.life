title: 2018.04.03 - D2 Log

I don't use a standard D2 installation. I use the PlugY modification. There's extra content that can only be had online, and I want to simulate it. Furthermore, I want an infinite stash, particularly since I have no access to an economy (and it's simply more immersive than muling applications or literal mule characters). 

One of the oddities posed by PlugY is its instantiation of Diablo Clone spawns. If I leave the game running overnight, he generally spawns. I've had him spawn multiple times now on the necro, moreso than the other characters. It's odd, and I don't understand why. I may test it out further, but I left the game running but in "Esc" pause. I come back the next day, unpause, and the Clone magically spawns right on the spot. Interestingly he replaced my first wave of baal (sucks). I don't even have Lifetap, I believe. With the Crushers, I won't care about having my merc. Furthermore, I can easily goto max revives. He's killable. On top, I'm not wearing my full combat regalia (although, to be fair, there aren't many other improvements I can make of huge consequence....maybe +5-7 more skill).
