title: 2020.01.23 - TDL: Organize

* Hey, I guess you aren't sleeping enough. Sleep as much as you need.
* Need to organize a gameplan for the vehicles
** Bill of Sale
** Inspections
*** Vinn lookup on car?
** Licenses
* A semi-completed living room would be []D[][]V[][]D, homie.
* Look into a TV for your daughter?
* Allowances need to be reinstated. 
** Son needs to call them up for a replacement card. Pointless without it in many cases.
* Kitchen is almost set. Revision on organization.
** Pantry and fridge setups are garbage again though.
