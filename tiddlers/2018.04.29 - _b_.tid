I am open to the possibility that people are generally evil. I think most people aren't open to that, and this is not an assumption they are simply allowed to help themselves to. I also think people fail to question the nature of their reality; they are unwilling to consider the possibility that they are largely wrong about the most important things in life. 

You've been shaping who you are for many years. You haven't listened to me when I've begged you to learn some humanities. You went STEM, which is cool, but you didn't even attempt to round yourself out. I explained what counts as an effective education and the scientifically demonstrated lack of critical reasoning in: business, communications, and education majors. You go on to get an MBA because its a signal. You didn't seriously look into the opposing points of view to the Libertarian Chicago-Style Economics you've received. You trained yourself to have a mind which can't reason about what's most important in the world, and you are literally trying to become bourgeois without taking the time to ask if you should.

You've now held a position at Humana for years. I've told you from the beginning what they were. You are a part of a machine that kills thousands of people each year. You have this knowledge, and you do nothing about it. You really aren't trying to leave. 

Let's be honest, you call yourself a Christian. How much actual Christian study and work do you engage in each week? Do you put your money where your mouth is? I think you're a hypocrite.

Further, I've tried to create a relationship with you for many years now. You have initiated conversations with me less than 5 times in the past decade. I always do the initiation. And, let's be clear, I'll call or message you 10 times before you eventually respond. I've tried to build a relationship even through that asymmetry. There came a point this past winter where you stopped responding, where I'd call and you'd send me straight to voicemail everytime without calling back. You ghosted me. 

Here's what that means: you don't actually want to want a relationship with me in the end. That sucks. And, it's taken me a while to realize and accept it.

I am reminded of your treatment of my brother AIR. You've essentially ghosted him without a second thought. I found that pretty disgusting. I've also seen you, in my own house, joke about the fact that you won't be responding to our granddonor. You don't have the integrity to say what you mean to those around you. You merely maintain the appearance of a relationship. You use them. I think you're asymmetrical in your approach, and you fail tit-for-tat tests. You've become Emily in this respect.

You are the sum of your habits. Your habits are bad, and that means you are a bad person. =/

Economic division was built into USD: you either pay interest on Treasury bonds, or you live off it.

An interesting claim. I don't think this is the crux, but it is a factor.
