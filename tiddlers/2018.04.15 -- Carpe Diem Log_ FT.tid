* D2
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Atlanta
** Didn't finish. Weird Michael Jackson-esque episode. The show is losing some of its shine for me. I get the schtick. It's very well done. I don't feel like I'm stepping into a new world anymore. 
* Called JRE
** Also, I found out my brother AIR finally got his S.Chef position w/$40k/year. I'm very happy for him, proud of him, and I wish him the best of luck. He doesn't seem to stay in contact with any of his family (and I can understand that). 
* Noobliss

* Family Time!
* The kids made Soup, Sandwiches, and Salad.
* We kept the door open to let the cool breeze in. It was very nice.
