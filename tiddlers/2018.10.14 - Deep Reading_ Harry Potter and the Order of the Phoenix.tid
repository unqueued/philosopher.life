Occlumency is actually something we need in the world. One must defend themselves against memetic warfare. 

The lessons are fun scenes. Love Snapes' pensieve defense, lol. Also, Rick and Morty. Why don't they duplicate their memories, modify them in pensieve? What happens if you have contradictory memories you attempt to implant? 

I too repel people with my mind rather than my wand (though, that probably would repulse others as well ;P).

Emptying yourself of emotion, but it's not clear that Snape is really a master of this. He obviously can control his outward appearance, but his motivations do not appear to be in his control.

It is funny that trying to close your mind to someone trying to break it seems to open the mind.
