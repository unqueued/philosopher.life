title: 2020.03.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: do i r have stupid?

* Woke at 10:30
** Still sore, but I can move and I had better sleep. Apnea cannot be countered this way though. =/
* [[Morning Routine]]
** [[TDL: Yesterday]] fits nicely. We'll see how it goes.
* Offspring fucked up. =/
** I like that we have a chance to fuck up and not lose the day.
* Dialecture
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
** Short this time. 
* [[Deep Reading: Tutoring]], chapter 4
* Dialecture
* Cleaned up dining area some, and started our assembly line.
** We attempted without instructions, and it took us a couple minutes to figure it out. 
** My son had a blast. He wishes he could do this more.
*** Odd considering his [[TDL]]s. 
*** I'd like to see him go for this as well. He could go into the trades. The social costs will be lower there in some respects, but he'll be even of a pariah in other ways.
** The original hardware assembly left something to be desired. We had to go back over it by hand.
** They give some tools, but not enough for the job. The ones they give you are not good enough for the job.
*** Ended up using our cordless drill and long hex wrenches to finish.
** Tables and chairs look excellent. 
* Walked with wife
** Weather was good enough to go without a coat. Neat.
* Tried something new:
** Biscuit sliders using our leftovers.
*** Adults enjoyed them, the youth did not so much.
* Our teacher delivered our papers, including mine! =)
* Built [[MTG]] decks. 18 decks tonight, then I found the last box of cards. We'll have a variety to play, no doubt.
** We've been thinking about how to handicap players and decks wisely. 
* Walked and talked with myself
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 3?
