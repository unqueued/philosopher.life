title: Wiki: Be the Kind of Author that...

Be the kind of author that:

* chooses to value writing over reading (and other activities) when something feels wrong.
** Self-reflection should replace all other compulsions.
* pragmatically chooses not to read or write on this wiki when it is getting late in the evening.
** Unless you don't absolutely need to go to bed and feel very strongly about needing to work on it. 
** Be warned: it will keep you up. 
** This wiki is a difficult kind of introspective work that needs to be done in a constructive, quiet, safe, and focusable environment.
* records aphorisms. 
* looks for rules of thumb about himself and the world. 
* habitually seeks patterns in thought and behavior. 
** You need to have the most accurate picture of who we really are to make effective, world-class, virtuous decisions about what to do. 
** You are habituating virtue in yourself when you have the executive function to look at yourself and the world in a consistent, practical, and theoretical manner.
* ignores haters, would-be haters, and hypothetical haters.<<ref "1">> 
** Some people will think this is too cold and calculated. They think life should feel more organic. I mean no offense to these retarded Romantics, but they clearly do not understand the nature of reason as it relates to meaning, virtue, and The Good itself. They are defensively and confabulatorily rejecting you. It's irrational, and you should see them as such. Don't be hurt by their stupidity.
** Additionally, the anti-intellectual #iamverysmart crowd of cowards and psychopaths can fuckoff. They do not care about you or what you are doing. You have to care about yourself. You are valuable because you value yourself, QED.
