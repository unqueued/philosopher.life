* Full body fungal infection and inflammation is getting worse. 
** What else can you do? Stop looking at and for the truth? ROFL. Fuck that.
** Keep grinding away, and remember there is [[hope]]. Eat your fruits and veggies, continue your vits, med and stretch. Walk and talk.
* Your son is jumping into CS more. This is exciting! 
** Lavish him with praise for his effort, especially when he fails to accomplish one of his goals despite his efforts.
* I think the kids aren't exploring enough in their time outside. 
** I have no idea how to incentivize it. Continue to reason with them.
* That porch is clean, but it needs to be swept more. 
** Maybe we need to shield it against mowing more effectively.
** Still haven't taken apart that table. =/
* Need to use that chicken.
