Hey Josiah,

My chosen name is a leetspeak (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) derivation of the word: "hope." You are free to use the name Hop if you wish (it's humorous).

I'm sorry that it's not up. My index.html file was wiped down to 0 bytes sometime past 10pm last night. I do not know why, but that's why I keep so many backups. I've been putting out other fires. We've had 2 extended electrical outages and I've been desperately trying to get i3wm manjaro's alsa and pulseaudio sound systems to fully function work for a couple days (I'm throwing in the towel). The site is back up now. Here's hoping I'll get my shit together. =)

Sincerely,

h0p3

I read a lot of your wiki. Its interesting because its "prolix". By which I mean the thoughts develop though iteration. Its one of the very few wiki I ever bothered reading through.

It is different than much stuff on the net which tends to "the statement", not "the exploration".

You writing style very much reminds me of writer-philosophers who consider self-reflection the essence of both life AND writing.

The closest analogy I can think of is Montaigne.

Your approach is really good. You comments, at points, about some people who "don't get it", are accurate. But, IMO, you don't need labour those points. Readers will get it. People not into it are unlikely to ever get it.

On the tech side, maybe, in time, you could offer visitors a notification system for updates they could sign-up to?

Best wishes

Josiah
