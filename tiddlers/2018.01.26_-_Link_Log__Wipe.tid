* Stunning!
** http://quillette.com/2018/01/17/jordan-b-peterson-critical-theory-new-bourgeoisie/
*** God damn is that a good article! The sanity, clarity, and honesty are breathtaking. 
*** Even the comments are good: "problem of the self-exemption" is right on the money.

* Confirm My Bias

*** This is hilarious.

*** Tool of the future.

*** A golem continues to emerge. What platform can I possibly escape to?

*** Hence why you exchange into anonymizing currencies and back.
*** Statute of Limitations

*** Shower me with praise.

**** Not surprised.

* Think About It

*** Not sure it says anything new. I don't glorify this person either. But, I appreciate the message.

*** Unfortunately, I don't think this is an honest look at the overton window as it is today. We continue to shift to the Right. This extends beyond neo-reactionary views; they are the dominant idealogy that continues to make progress towards their goal.

* Fishy
** https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/01/25/why-it-costs-so-much-to-be-poor-in-america/
*** Oh, yeah, you really care. These are symptoms of a larger memeplex infection, and you choose not to address it. How convenient for you.
** https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hating-gerrymandering-is-easy-fixing-it-is-harder/
*** The problem with quants is that they often lack human vision (I say that as a quant of sorts). The solution to gerrymandering and a host of voting problems is a complete revamp of the constitution. No, that's really not that hard to do. And, it should be part of our political process. Even the founders agreed. =) Not even really arguing for the possibility is a sign of dishonesty. I adore 538, but their agenda is not mine.

*** Oh, that is far too charitable, to the point of dishonesty. This was no accident. 

* Interesting

*** Libertarianism at work. Unfortunately, it's still not as simple as this. Slavery is very real in libertarianism; it's built into the notion of being able to own yourself, imho.
