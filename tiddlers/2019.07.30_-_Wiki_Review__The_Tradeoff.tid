title: 2019.07.30 - Wiki Review: The Tradeoff

* [[2019.07.24 - K: Games, Computers, and Writing]]
** Delivered pics as I said. It usually doesn't go the other way around.
* [[2019.07.29 - K: Weekend]]
** Part of the problem is that when someone who knows me well asks "how are you doing?" it's pretty obvious they don't mean it. It's like passing someone in the hallway, but they don't have any intention of digging into my identity in the wiki. It's shallow and unjustifiably deceptive rhetoric to me; it often feels like mere social networking.
* [[2019.07.29 - Tasha: Busy]]
** My offline connections are in decline in many cases. 
*** 3% rule, sir!
* [[2019.07.26 - AA: Starting School]]
** I think this is why I strongly prefer the [[Public Self-Modeler]]s. They are honest about what matters, and they wrestle. It's not just a signal-fest.
* [[2019.07.23 - T-Money: No Dice. Fuck.]]
** Likewise. We've stopped discussing anything. It is painful, of course.
* [[2019.07.23 - Ovy: RPG]]
** We've basically fallen off the map lately. 
* [[2019.07.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Blaze It]]
** You know, I've been feeling good about life and my family lately. If we have enough money to survive and make progress together in school, I'm doing fine.
* [[2019.07.29 - Wiki Review: Living the Dream]]
** We have another set of people to invite to the house. Now that the student has graduated, we can invite her and her fiance/bf over. Linux and alcohol sound good to me; maybe bust out the MTG cards, eh?
* [[2019.07.29 - TDL: i3]]
** I'm doing a shitty job today. Lol. 
* [[2019.07.29 - Prompted Introspection: Losing My Religion]]
** I've been doing way more religious reasoning lately. I didn't choose it all by myself. 
*** I'm indebted to [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. I'm lucky to have the chance to think.
* [[2019.07.29 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Meaningless Traces]]
** Completed. To an important degree, I'm on his side. I am fine with allying with people who are radically opposed to my chain of reasoning when the lives of others are on the line.
* [[2019.07.29 - Sphygmus: Strangely, Rewind]]
** Her letters are always gifts. I remember years ago getting my first Amazon package in the mail, and it had a bit of that effect. After a while, I just couldn't be bothered. I don't think that is ever going to happen with letters. 
* [[Script: system-maintenance.sh]]
** Tagged. There are many things which could go in here. I think a tmux or terminator based system monitoring script would be worth building too. I want windows into my system beyond Conky. I htop every day, and it makes sense to have a place for it, yeah?
* [[2019.07.29 - Computer Musings: Exeunt]]
** Completed. I don't think I want to modify vim too hard though. The moment that packaging is that all that important, I think it makes more sense to go evil mode. I want to vim my way around config files, nothing more.
* [[2019.07.29 - Wiki Audit: Rice]]
** I am so ready to get on [[m16]]. I'm impatient and lazy, a solid mix. I am crawling on [[m10]] right now.
