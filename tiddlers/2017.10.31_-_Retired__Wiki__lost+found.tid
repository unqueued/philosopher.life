title: 2017.10.31 - Retired: Wiki: lost+found

!! About:

I need a container to store junk and whatnots. I don't want anything getting lost. I might as well know where the "lost" things are. Admittedly, I'm not even sure what I'm doing with this. I need an outlet for "not knowing," and this is one of them.
