title: 2019.08.28 - TDL: Be Useful

* You still aren't doing it. Write.
* You are reading books though. They might not be challenging enough, but I'll take it.
* Freezer is full, fridge is dwindling. 
* You should try getting to bed earlier. It's time to start being productive in the mornings again. Late nights are ridiculously unproductive for you except when you are manic about something productive.
* Graft chats eventually.
* Seedbox is inching. `/smh`
* Your brother will likely be losing his baby soon. Listen carefully, sir. Be useful to him.
