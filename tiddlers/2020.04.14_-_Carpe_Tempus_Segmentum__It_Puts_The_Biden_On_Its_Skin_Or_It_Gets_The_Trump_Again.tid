title: 2020.04.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: It Puts The Biden On Its Skin Or It Gets The Trump Again

* Woke at 8
** Fuck me. That was not enough.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Dialecture
* Read
* Found a skunk with a den 10 feet away from our house.
** We're trying to avoid having the stinky-cat removed (I think they'd kill the creature instead of finding another home). Hopefully, it will come to see us not as a threat.
*** Famous last words. I'm also worried that Ranga will not abide. He doesn't like any unaccepted animals in his wide territory.
* My offspring are still screwin' around a lot on the interwebs.
** Just like their ol' man, ofc.
* Chats
* Whippin' it out during her workday (best during meetings).
** Put on that micro show.
** I should have cum right there for her. I can hit 5 feet ez.
*** I seek her blushed giggle swat mixed with disgust and disdain that I would dare stain her.
* Fireman Time!
* Picked up meds
** Hospital is on even higher alert.
*** Interrogations and spacing felt anxious everywhere (nurse was shaking).
* Shopping
** Finished off the dry ark. 
*** Costco had nothing price-efficient left to offer (I've been in full AH [[vidya]] [[game]] mode), but we hadn't systematically mined Aldis yet.
*** We have a lot of pasta and grains now (pantry is already set on these, but the ark didn't have them because I wasn't sure what should go there).
*** Rounded out our condiments, canned goods, and baking supplies. The shelf is stuffed to the gills. May it never be needed.
** Frozen ark
*** I'm taking the mini-section of the chest freezer for another ark. Concentrated energy (metabolizing a lot of sunlight) that I think may become rarer and more expensive in the coming year.
**** Basically, cheese and meats. Dense.
**** We're using the deep freezer for meat at the bottom, and I'm trying to limit how often we open it. 
***** Leftovers, frozen veggies, frozen junk, high-traffic food, etc. are something I prefer to keep in the smaller freezer unit of the fridge. 
** Bought cheap but durable plastic pots (huge, with measurement lines) and also picked up berry plants.
** We got heckled for prepping by another customer (though I didn't take hoarding amounts and sat below the limits assigned by the store). They were shushed and asked to be more careful with their words by others.
*** It was tense in the store. I think we are all feeling it.
** Watched a man for a while to make sure he was pushing carts without going into the store before approaching him. 
* Kitchen, pantry, and ark organization.
* Dialectures
* Marked lines on the ground for a tiny garden. 
** May violate the lease for it, but it's easier to ask for forgiveness (especially since we are paying our rent).
* Tried to buy gardening supplies, but they were closed by 6. =/
** I think they can't find enough employees.
* Walked with my wife
** Tons to talk about. 
** Both feeling exhausted and stressed.
** Planning.
** Hasn't felt like a vacation; we continue to push hard. 
* Called [[AIR]]
** Funding looks saner for him.
** Lots of eggs, curry, rice. His roommate has family in town, and they are helping. You can tell they love their son.
** Brother continues to require that I do not utter the phrase or any notion like it: "I might be crazy." He doesn't believe it, and he thinks it isn't good for me to say it. He's really nice to me. I am crazy, lol.
** He's been soaking in the rare free time, the tubes, and chillin'. I wish he had more. 
*** He continues to pump memetic lead like a machine gun into capitalist ideology. 
* Chats
* [[Family Gathering]]
* Pizza!
* [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]: Presentations on [[Dualism]]
** Wildly better than last time. 
* Cleaning
* [[vidya]]: Sapolsky
** Having a blast thinking about homo sapiens and all the other primates. Damned good use of our time.
* [[h0p3ful Review]] was about making the best of a bad situation.
* Read+Write
* Dogfucking tired today...
* Sleep by 1
