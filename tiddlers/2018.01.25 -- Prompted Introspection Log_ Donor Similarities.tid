title: 2018.01.25 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Donor Similarities

!! How are you and your parents alike.

Very good //question//, Samwise. We share genetic code, a history together, and a significant memeplex. We're intelligent, headstrong, and each think we're doing what is right. We are all type A personalities with dark-triadic spectrum characteristics. We're all obviously selfish, although not all of us are willing to admit that. We share a broad range of intellectual interests. All of our donors are terrible parents, and each of us are terrible parents.

I know this: if we could snap our fingers to make our lives simpatico, we would (although, perhaps not for the same reasons). Unfortunately, it isn't that easy.

I think we each hold the other generation in contempt and non-trivially responsible for where we are now.

Lastly, I think we have each attempted to give up on the other. Good for us.
