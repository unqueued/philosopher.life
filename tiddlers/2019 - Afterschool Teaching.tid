!! Audit:

* It took me a long time to spiral into what this position was and figure out the lines of where I could be useful.
* I see a lot of people following rules and attempting to limit their own liability while climbing. 
* I agree teachers are facilitators, but I don't see nearly enough 1-on-1 dialectics both private and public. We are wrestling to tell stories more wisely, and they aren't getting practice with wrestling.
* At the heart of every classroom is a telic intentionality toward [[The Good]] (though some are far more effective than others). 
* I got to understand a lot of people. It's been a joy in many cases. 
** I can't say I feel more hopeful for society in general, but I do feel more hopeful that my effort is worthwhile.
* I'm still fighting on their terms too far. What does it mean to build an Academy?
** I simply don't have all the resources necessary to accomplish the task. What is the next goal then? 
** Might simply be best to go where they are.
* This was a waste of my talents and potential, but a wonderful use of my time.
* It's been an honor to knows these children. I doubt I was terribly useful to them, but I think we made progress.
