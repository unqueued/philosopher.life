* Sum your diet logs
* Choose a more serious and fitting title for "CodeEval Things" -- "Portfolio" may be a better word.
* Be more specific than "Potential School"
* Finish your school logs.
* Stop lying; do your writing.
* I am thankful that you did diet logs more often, but you need to complete all of your work.
* I loved your cat logs.
