!! Audit:

* Super personal. This is an emotional rollercoaster.
* There are non-trivial moments of raw humility here. I like that about myself. I want to cultivate that [[irwartfrr]].
* Self-deprecating humor, noice.
* I have more edits to make than usual.
* Going in order has an odd story flow to it. They do kind of clump together. This is not the usual go of it.
* Many of my claims just feel so natural to me now. I like that.
* I'm surprised that I'm asked to explain or define common idioms. Why? What's the point? It often doesn't seem to be useful to me. Am I supposed to find ways to apply it that I'm not seeing?
* I'm pleased with this log. I really am pulling myself onto the pages of this wiki with this log. There's some good gutteral emotional work here as well as some standard reasoning I admire.
