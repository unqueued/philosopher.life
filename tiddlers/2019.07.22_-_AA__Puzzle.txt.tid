Hey, how are you doing? We've not been talking as much over the summer as when school is in session, lol.
JUL 9 2:06 PM
I am doing good —fighting with motivation to do things but right now I have a puzzle of the schedule...how are you?
JUL 9 2:07 PM
Ah, schedule puzzles are rarely fun unless they are video games for me.  I'm sorry.
JUL 9 2:07 PM
Doing good is good though.
JUL 9 2:07 PM
How's [[AG]] and [[UJ]]?
JUL 9 2:08 PM
I like messing with the schedule
JUL 9 2:08 PM
Its a puzzle I enjoy
JUL 9 2:08 PM
Oh, cool.
JUL 9 2:08 PM
What are you scheduling?
JUL 9 2:08 PM
They are good —lying around too but good
JUL 9 2:08 PM
Noice. Chill summer.

Classes for the high school middle school
JUL 9 2:08 PM
I end up fixing the admins mistakes otherwise
JUL 9 2:09 PM
Yup
JUL 9 2:09 PM
Are you reasoning about your schedule alongside other teachers?
JUL 9 2:10 PM
Yes they come and tell me what they like or I go ask
JUL 9 2:10 PM
You are the conduit and the speaker. Represent, grill.
JUL 9 2:11 PM
Yep yep
JUL 9 2:11 PM
Also, I'm fine. I've been trying to read and I'm failing entirely (totally normal). Putting out fires on the technical side of my wiki. I miss my daughter for her expertise, lol. She made it easy on me though.
JUL 9 2:11 PM
Why missing [[j3d1h]]?
JUL 9 2:11 PM
She and [[1uxb0x]] are with [[JRE]] until the 19th.
JUL 9 2:11 PM
They have to get out of the Zoo and experience life with sane people.
JUL 9 2:12 PM
Ahhhh nice!!!
JUL 9 2:12 PM
Right
JUL 9 2:12 PM
Maybe they would go to the water park with us or something?
JUL 9 2:12 PM
Also, practicing remote relationships and Family Time^^tm^^ over our machines.
JUL 9 2:12 PM
Right
JUL 9 2:12 PM
I bet they would love that. Although, I am worried they didn't pack any swimsuit.
JUL 9 2:12 PM
We can find out —i shall ask if its ok with you
JUL 9 2:13 PM
Totally up to you guys! Whatever works out is great.
JUL 9 2:13 PM
Awesome!
JUL 9 2:14 PM

How often does her group meet?
JUL 11 7:45 PM
Every Thursday
JUL 11 7:46 PM
Seems especially nice during the summer. I assume there aren't a ton of folks around her age in your neighborhood.
JUL 11 7:49 PM
Nobody in the neighborhood her age so its good to get her out of the house
