I am reminded of Asimov's //Solaria// (and Bioshock), an attempt at individualistic utopia turned dystopia. Sometimes the individual must have the integrity to quadratically spend their social capital to attempt to override the collective's indifference to our moral obligations. Rand denies there are obligations to [[others]] without qualification or justification. No explanation is given to how her conception of the centralization of power enables voluntary relationships at all, and that's because she can't. She has to lie through her teeth to you. Pay attention, Libertarians. You cannot acquire the justified Rule of Law for free. Even the minimally justified state requires a profound collectivist methodology to secure the consensual consensus of the social contract necessary to construct our emergent [[philosopher king|TPK]]. Indeed, ruling ourselves wisely is costly. We must serve each other to enable the freedoms which matter most.
