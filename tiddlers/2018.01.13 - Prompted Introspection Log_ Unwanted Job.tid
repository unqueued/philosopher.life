title: 2018.01.13 - Prompted Introspection Log: Unwanted Job

!! What's one job you would never want to do?

What does it mean to //want// and //never//? Do you mean, with zero conflicting desires or reservations? I can construct examples in which the world is ending unless I do a job, and since I don't want the world to end, I would then want to do the job. Even if I didn't want to do the job in virtue of itself, I still would want to do it as means to something else. That might sound like a good argument against my example, but then I would remind you that most jobs are just that: a means to an end. 

I would never want a job that I consider to be fundamentally evil. I'm striving to think of what counts as the most evil job. The "ideal" maximally evil job likely is permanent torture of all possible beings throughout time (or otherwise), especially if it was part of my job to enjoy it (that's a weird job description in many ways). More practically, however, I might say any kind of job designed to facilitate and exploit Daseinic slaves. 

Unfortunately, my practical example becomes (to many people's eyes) unintuitively problematic in the real world. I see the implications of jobs that others do not. I think we use and enslave each other directly and indirectly in almost every job. I think it's one of the reasons I have such a hard time fitting into society.
