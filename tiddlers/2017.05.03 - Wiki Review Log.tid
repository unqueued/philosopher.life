title: 2017.05.03 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.05.02 - Wiki Review Log]]
** Monthly audits are good. I like how it gives me an overview. I'm actually excited to see what I say about this month in my next review. The structure of the wiki is definitely more programmatic than it was the previous month. That said, I've had a lot less of other kinds of content.

** I probably shouldn't have eaten that extra wrap. I need to eat smaller amounts over the course of the day. I need to feel hungry and not exactly fill myself up. I don't need to go to the "full" feeling every time. Also, my farts have been smellier than usual. I'm guessing it is the introduction of having the occasional beer and the chili. Chili is especially potent for me.

** Made some edits. Also, it helped me realize what I failed to think about or say in today's Pipefitting Log. Being able to compare daily logs against each other is useful!
