!! Audit:

* It's true: [[/b/]] has been injected everywhere, as I have noted. [[CTS]] is a prime example. 
** It's interesting that the ray of intentionality of consciousness is strongly linked to our ability to filter. The argument is then that I'm not being very conscious, in some sense, when I lift filters, right?
* My interest in sex is declining. My libido isn't as strong. 
** It happens with age. It also may be a sign of other health problems.
* I need to stay off the [[Games]].
** So god damn tempting. I'm still fairly proud of myself here.
** Though, I consider playing with [[JRE]] to be one of the highlights of my year (and, oddly enough, of my life).
*** If not THE, in some respect?
* I know alcohol is bad for me. I think it is fantastic when others can avoid it (and, I'm strongly hoping my offspring don't drink). I've worked to tame it. There are seasons where only it does the trick. 
** I keep plenty around, but I'm glad I've not gotten drunk in many months. Something is going right in life when I'm not drinking (and, ofc, one might argue that it is going right //because// I am not drinking...but that is not so obvious to me).
* Our cars always need something done, it feels. 
** Maybe in time, this will stabilize some. In a couple years, I will likely need to get a vehicle for my daughter.
*** I'm excited to have them simulate driving and then to teach them stick. I'm worried that they just won't care about the ability to drive, like the freedom won't be relevant to them? I don't know.
* I'm enjoying the exploration of [[title.Title]]s, which is arguably something this log has done best. Hard to sum it up, and sometimes, not pointing elsewhere is better too.
** Humor continues to be a valuable addition. 
* Omg, I've been dating my wife again for almost a year! 
** I mean, it wasn't perfectly consistent, and it couldn't be. Hard to do with offspring, our finances, and our obligations to [[others]]. It's been damn good though. I love to walk, works even when you are poor AF. It's also a joy to be able to drive somewhere and do something.
** I don't think I'm romantic enough. My wife isn't so concerned about that, but I feel like I'm still a failure to her on this front. 
*** I feel like neither of us have energy to be spontaneous most of the time, and it's not clear that such a thing has a high chance of helping the [[other]] always either.
* I think this year shows serious shifts in our homeschooling. 
** My son continues to make serious development progress. 
** My daughter is driving me insane.
** Neither spend their time wisely enough, just like their old man. 
*** Fuck me.
** I'm trying to grant them space and freedom to fuck up while coaching as well as I can. 
*** You know, eventually they get it, usually. This is a big cluster of lessons; it might just take way more time.
**** Straight-up scared for my offspring. It has to be done though.
* Our meals continue to improve. 
** It's not like I can cook anything fancy. But, it's certainly the best I've ever eaten in my life. 
** I like that my offspring continue to play a larger and larger role in our kitchen (and all the things in running a house). There are so many plates to spin, so many skills in which to become proficient, so much which must be predicted and planned for. I hope they can look back with as much scrutiny as they can muster and still find merit in our parenting and choices for the family. 
** Not just that, but you've had more guests than usual. You've given out more food, and you've invited more people to sup than ur used to.
* I've stepped up my wordplay in the wiki in general. It's not that there isn't serious to be done (and even some of the serious work must be rhetorically accomplished in wordplay), but I'm enjoying what the play adds.
* ''Dialectures'' are my term. Sometimes it's Rabbitholing, sometimes it's openly adversarial to various [[dok]], and sometimes it's just fucking fun. They tend to be intense, interesting, and discursive; I can't even remember them well enough. It's like being trapped in a room with your professor for tutoring. Oxford Tutorials even, though without enough writing and formal presentation. 
** This has been one of the most important uses of my time this year, if not the most important (especially for my offspring). 
** It's wrestling. If they can learn to push it, they are going to be leet monsters. They are already like aliens. So much danger in the desert. We will never be ready.
** Hopefully, we find the right mix of this "pointing and answering" short form and the depth of dialectures.
** I'm proud of you. 
* My wife's moods and feelings are something which we are both paying even more attention to. She's been under enormous pressure.
** We're autistic, and adaptation is not our strong suit, but she's made it work. 
* We've made strong progress in reasoning about [[TV: Library]] together. 
** I'm hoping they will eventually dive into it themselves, squeezing it. I have had to watch some of these a dozen times. 
** I've also been glad when we don't watch. Too often, it has been a waste of our time.
* It's been an extremely social year. I'm not used to speaking with this many people. 
** I'm not used to reflecting so carefully about speaking with so many people either. I hope I have done it fittingly. Not easy for an autist.
* Timestamps seem to be useful for [[@: hypertext 2020]], but I still don't think they do much here. 
** There are circumstances in which I can imagine their utility, of course. I'm not writing real-time though, and minutely accounting doesn't buy me anything here.
* I've been focusing more on the nature of my sleep, but I've not done as good of a job recording it as I'd like.
** The log, in general, seems to be filling out in the [[Sphygmus]]ian style.
* One of my favorite visuals of my wiki is glancing or fuzzily squinting at my screen to see the sharpness of the oscillation of the text. This log, in particular, shows steep peaks. The waves are very choppy, pointy, and organic somehow. Picking out the [[salience]] is something I will always need to practice.
* Meditation may or may not be useful. I still can't tell. Rumination is another possibility. It's not much different than when I'm walking and talking to myself either though; I'm often barely perceiving what's happening in the physical space around me during those times. 
* [[Charlie]] has curled up more. He's talking to fewer people. It's not as important to him these days. I don't know what that means.
* My immune systems starts going bonkers when I'm anxious enough. I need to pay more attention to my body.
* My sleep schedule is garbage. It's just not going to get better, and I need to stop acting like it can be normal. I'm not going to be normal.
* Clearly, I regret numbing myself so much. Fuck. =/
* Yeah, the feel of time seems to be speeding up. Days pass so fast. 
* I consider myself reminded, and remembering that I was going to remind myself. XD.
* You want to know why you don't lose weight? You eat too much. Dipshit. =)
* I've had a harder time connecting with my brother. [[Project: Ascension]] helped, but I think it weakens. It started before Matthew. He may have started withdrawing upon knowledge than he would be fostering.
* I did, of course, a terrible job reading books. Tada.
* I talk about masturbating, a lot.
** I don't talk about talking about masturbating nearly enough.
*** Nor do I talk about...lol.
* Tea, coffee, bliss, fruit, nuts, meditation, [[Fitness Routine]], read+write, Fireman Time!, dialectures, delicious sleep...I want to see those words every day. 
* I'm fucking sad that [[gh057]] is not going to be appearing often in here. =(. 
** We never did make that grain alcohol. Lol.
* God damn, WoW fucking dominated, even when I forced myself down to 2 hours of play a day.
* [[CTS]] is a catchall.
* Whirlwind of a year. It was better than the previous too, imho.
