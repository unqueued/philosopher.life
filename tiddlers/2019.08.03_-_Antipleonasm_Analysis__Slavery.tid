title: 2019.08.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Slavery

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
When the entirety of your earnings are exhausted on food and shelter, your labors are no longer viewed as an opportunity for economic advancement, but rather as an act of self preservation. In the real world, thatâ€™s called Slavery.

Slavery comes in [[dok]]. Yes, unjustified taxation is theft and thus a form of slavery; the Libertarians are correct in their fundamental material Hohfeldian analysis such that all moral rights can be equivalently stated in terms of property rights. Unfortunately, they have no idea how to talk about what actual rights obtain, and their deflationary theory is a simple trojan horse for centralizing power (with plenty of huge problems for even attempting to justify self-ownership). By this token, however, slavery is a radically inclusive concept. 

What sort of life we have a right to is going to be particularized to our contexts. The gist of the claim in our context is obviously correct. Even something like self-preservation as a dialectic [[power]] is not so easy to pin down (Spinoza comes out swinging too).
