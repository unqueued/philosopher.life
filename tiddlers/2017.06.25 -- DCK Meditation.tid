title: 2017.06.25 -- DCK Meditation

The Us vs. Them mentality is powerful, pervasive, and I'm not sure it is escapable. This meme is so strong and so embedded in who we are that I'm convinced it's not merely software, but perhaps even part of our hardware. We are hardwired for it. That said, there is always "Faith in Humanity," the hope that we can evolve to be better than we are, etc. Can we modify, control, self-legislate for our Tribal Firmware?

I don't know. 

I feel like my Tribalism has increased, but I'm not surprised (about to be 32 here). It crystallized and the circle tightens. Call it wisdom, call it psychopathy. I don't know what to call it. It seems prudent. I hope to draw these lines in a way that I won't regret, to draw them in a way that maximizes our utility, in a way that makes us happy. I can't be perfect, but I should do my best. I do have enemies. However hard it can be to imagine someone wanting to kill me, enslave me, or make me suffer, I do have them. They come in various degrees and kinds. They come in large structures, institutions, and patterns. DJ Dr. Suess, drop a beat! Where be mah redpilled kid's book at?

There are many different sets in our object-oriented ontology. I'm a member of many sets. But, I feel like only some of these sets count as social spheres in which Tribal lines are drawn and understood. 

It is difficult to treat myself and humanity with respect at the same time. The deontic contradictions and systematic incoherences abound. Kantianism is a form of Tribalism. There are other metaethical tribal structures to consider as well. How do I know which Walzerian Spheres of Justice are more important? How do I balance, negotiate, and make sense of them?

Write because you care about what you think. You should, and you do. It is not immorally egotistical, self-centered, etc. Do not be ashamed of it. Clear that out of your head. Your arrangment of memes comprises who you are. To say you matter is to say that configuration of memes matters. You are what you think. Well, you are what you think in a consistent, habitual way. Or, maybe you are the thinking thing in all its particularities, including the patterns and exceptions. Regardless, I think who we are is still largely defined by how we believe (both gutterally through desire and through our frontal lobes). Simulations show who we really are: a memetic network, a computer, etc.

---

It is a lonely thought that few if any will want to understand what I believe, will want to get to know me. In a way, I lack marketability. I don't have what people are looking for. Again, egoism pervades our species.

---

I want my kids to be wise. As a means to that end, I think they must be absurdly educated. They need to see that the educational institutions around them are overidealized. There are many cults integrated into them. That said, being someone who navigates through these cults will pickup many valuable tools and experiences. 

It's not just education institutions either. It's all institutions, relationships, and organizations. Members seeking entry into a tribe pay tribute, they sacrifice, and they pay their dues. There is a tax on the poor, a capitalism to this tribalism. Sadly, even our educational institutions and infrastructure have it as well (they always have!). What say you, Plato? Handjobs for Wisdom, right?

---

I am grateful to my parents for the memes they have provided me to survive. I am entitled to them, no doubt. They didn't fuck everything up, but it only takes a handful of mistakes to ruin everything.

---

The world is so fragmented and large. It is chaos. I sound like an old-timer. I have this ideal in my head, and as I expand my understanding of the world, see it for what it really is, I grow conservative. 

----

While I see it sober, I am drowned more clearly in it on DCK. I perceive ontology differently through it. 

I see:

* strings. 
* wells.
* pin-holes with infinite pressure behind them.
* sinews twisting.
* atoms, molecules, and structures within structures, and overlapping structures. Thar' be the Metaphysical Dynamics.
** Why is my ontological status normatively superior? Ah, I cannot answer you, OOO. Because that's what I do?// **Hume "IS/OUGHT" Battle Hymn**//
* the machinations, the gears, systems, paradigms
* that I do not see clearly enough.

Evolution does have power embedded in it. 

I love and fear that feeling like I'm a blip. Like I'm cell. 

---

I want to be a visionary. I want to see the truth. I'm a philosopher only because I want to know.

I must do so in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, et cetera et cetera and so on and so forth. I should not sacrifice that which is most precious for it. I must be virtuous in my pursuit of the truth.<<ref "1">>

I have tasted metal 3 times in the past month of DCK use. It is sharp. I need to ask about this. I must research it. I need to think. That is not a natural flavor at all. It may be a benign effect of DCK, or could be something worse.

I feel like I'm building battlebots of my children. I want to equip them to fight the world. They must be gladiators. They must be chameleons. If I humbly serve as a philosopher king, I  think of them as something like Plato's Guardians. The analogy has tons of problems, I realize. Something is right about it. It's hard to isolate the signal.

I need highly trained, jedi, mentat assassin, renaissance man, kwisatz haderach (still in my father's language), 1337 hacker, chameleon gladiators. I must work with their strengths, shore up their weaknesses. I'm making an army with the right power dynamics, autonomy, love, and empathy.

I want us to be the FINAL FOUR. Triangles are special, strong, unique; there are 4 triangles. But, I'm dedicated to a four-way bond between us all. I need to develop friendships with not just my wife, but my children. I want to be their rock; I want us to form a mountain. I must give us a name. A fictional name I can use. We should go back and modify our names. We can programmatically alter it. I'll just keep a timeline. This is the narrative we build together.

I have neglected learning how to defend ourselves. It is important that my children are literal warriors as well. They need to be able to protect themselves. If life is a game, I think we need to wake up accept the fact that we have real enemies. Our goal is to protect ourselves. 

There are so many things to learn, and so little time. I wish I lived a life before I could raise my children so that I had the wisdom and experience to know how to even remotely know how to do it right.

We need to do philosophy.

Their success is my success. My old teacher is correct, fame and fortune. He sees it. 

---

HRD is about feeling powerful through other people. I see why my mother chose it. She feels powerful with it, like learning the science of people will allow her to change the world for God.

---

Trusting trust. I do not want our family fall apart. How do I make it so that we know we trust each other? Tit-for-tat mechanisms are the best way to build trust. It may be not be absolute best algorithm, but it is quite strong.

I feel like my father, planning. I remember the feelings.

---

I feel like a horcrux sometimes, but not in a bad way. I think it is an interesting philosophical notion. My wiki is my horcrux in a way.

---

Does it sound insane that I think there are drugs which help make my mind more powerful, productive, constructive, intuitive, and able to influence our lives in positive ways? They are two-edged swords, no doubt. Why would we not talk about the "good" side of the blade? 

I think taking on different perspectives, depersonalization, and derealization are things we valuable experiences, modes, and educational opportunities. I'm not saying we should be irresponsible with them. Quite the opposite. 

---

I think we should study pure war theory books. The problem is that it gets reduced down to "isms," obfuscations, gnostic secrets, etc. 

Warriors need to have that mindset. Humanity's Warriors.

Can you unsink a ship? Probably not. Let it go.

Strict utility calculation here. Sometimes, you have to trust the math, humanity.

Let your sunk costs go.

---

My goal is to flourish without being a predator of humanity. It's the gem of a life I hope to live. However improbable, I will pursue it. It is really fucking hard. But, that is a life I can respect. It has dignity because I say it does. QED.

---

What do you want to do, and why? 

I must ask my children that everyday.

---

I want my kids to start cataloging media they find valuable. These are important touchstones and anchors, memories they can revisit, analyze, cherish, and use.
