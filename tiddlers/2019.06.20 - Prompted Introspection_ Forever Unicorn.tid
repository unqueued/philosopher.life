title: 2019.06.20 - Prompted Introspection: Forever Unicorn

!! If you had the option of living forever, would you take it?

It depends (which is what my daughter says is my primary response to questions offline). If you can guarantee I'm a significant force for [[Good]] in the world and experienced non-trivial justified eudaimonia (perhaps even hedonia), then I don't see how I could refuse. But, I also have no idea how you could guarantee it, let alone get me to believe it.

If I make the decision blind, I will strictly answer: that's gonna be a "no" from me, dawg, hard pass. 

I would, of course, be interested in what it means to live forever. For it to even be the case would have enormous implications for my understanding of physics and even metaphysics. It is, of course, apparently possible, and thus modal realists will think an infinite number of unicorns and immortal h0p3's are stroking off in an infinite number of possible worlds, right?
