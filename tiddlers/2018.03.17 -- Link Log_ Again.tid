*** Platonic ideas. Please let me collapse the sensory and conceptual. I desperately want to try that. This is at least on my bucketlist.
*** Fuck it. [[Ayahuasca]] is a thing now. Already have the Syrian Rue. 250g HMRB OTW.

*** I am grateful to this user, obviously. It is a risky thing to say.
*** Trump's firings allow him to sift for the psychopaths that suit him. It's actually coincidentally genius (he might be cognizant of it, but the accident works out in his favor).
*** I am more worried about Mueller's failure now that I ever have been. I thought (naively) this was a sure thing.
*** I am extremely disturbed by how integrated Fox's tentacles have been embedded into the administration (and vv). It's even worse than I realized (and I was already quite suspicious).

*** I have a more Marxist perspective on it, but at least you are driving in a better direction.

*** Yes. Confirm My Bias hard. Say it loud and clear, please.
** https://webkit.org/blog/8146/protecting-against-hsts-abuse/
*** I'm annoyed by HSTS in several ways.
** http://nautil.us/issue/58/self/unhappiness-is-a-palate_cleanser
*** Aristotle hears you calling. Desensitized to happiness, taking a tolerance break from happiness. We have a very odd Bayesian kind of reasoning. I'd like to understand the distortions.
** https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/03/obamas-legacy-of-impunity-for-torture/555578/
*** Obama was very clearly a war criminal.

*** I will add, I think these will not be used to the people who read this site for good.

* Confirm My Bias
** http://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6149/976
*** And, we should be disgusted that we enable poverty.
** https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/how-europeans-evolved-white-skin
*** Vitamin D and virtue signalling/novelty. I wish more people thought about this. I think they would not find race to be as meaningful.
** https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/opinion/sunday/praise-adhd-attention-hyperactivity.html
*** Autism is adaptive in many cases, and it's no accident that we are selected for at times. I can only assume the same for psychopathy, AHDH, and a number of other mental differences.

** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16601545
*** Which is why only do fiction. For some of it, I also look it up beforehand. I realize this ruins some of the experience, but that's not what I am after.
** https://www.niels-ole.com/ownership/2018/03/16/github-forks.html
*** I keep my wiki there, but they can't be the safety or even the primary.

** https://protonmail.com/blog/turkey-online-censorship-bypass/
*** Sounds like good advertisement.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://daily.jstor.org/long-live-mister-rogers-quiet-revolution/
*** I'd usually have completely agreed with this. But, now, I hate to say it, but I think it's crucial that children understand darkness much earlier. It's important to see this kind of work growing up, of course, but I don't think it's the main story I want children to really take away.
** https://np.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/84jd62/being_a_dad_and_raising_a_son_would_love_to_hear/dvqano6/?context=3
*** Not from where most would expect, not even me (and I serious sympathies for many of their positions).
** https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/03/16/when-coding-style-survives-compilation-de-anonymizing-programmers-from-executable-binaries/
*** I am shocked. Stylometry at this level is so unexpected.
** https://www.wsj.com/articles/do-you-own-bitcoin-the-irs-is-coming-for-you-1521192601
*** 20k, tho.
** https://www.anandtech.com/show/12536/our-interesting-call-with-cts-labs
*** Much of the argument is reasonable.

* Think About It
** https://www.cjr.org/first_person/usa-today-reporter-source.php
*** Tragic. Timely. I am sorry to hear it, but I am glad we have it.
** https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-15/walmart-whistle-blower-claims-retailer-cheated-to-catch-amazon
*** I feel sorry for the whistleblower.
*** I am not surprised by Amazon's dominance. Wal-Mart is quickly having to deal with being both the mega Dollar store and having to attract higher income customers now.
** https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-academic-trawling-facebook-had-links-to-russian-university
*** Ugh. I am the Man Who Knew Too Little.

* Fishy
** https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code/
*** Forgive me. I agree with a non-trivial percentage of you message. I think you are discouraging competition out of self-interest. And, even worse, I think you do not understand the necessity of digital literacy even at this level for average citizens to make informed decisions about The Stack itself growing around us. I think you don't want educated citizens in crucial ways.

*** The author does not see the real problem. He doesn't understand the flaws in the centralization of power, the power dynamics at hand. He lacks empathy, very clearly.
** http://www.zdnet.com/article/adrian-lamo-hacker-dies/
*** I want to know the reason for the death.
** https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/84nyj6/a_shortish_history_of_new_features_on_reddit/dvr0y9t/
*** Sadly, I think it will go this direction, slowly.
** http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2018/03/palantir_new_orleans_gang_case.html
*** I highly doubt for the right reasons.

*** The only novel from the time period, and it has a very interesting review. I would like you to read it for me!
