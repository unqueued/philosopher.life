title: 2010.12.02 - Virtue Class Notes

    What is virtue; in other words, what makes a human trait a virtue?

    How does virtue ethics instruct us about what we should do rather than what we should be?

    How would virtue ethics help in resolving moral dilemmas (both resolvable and non-resolvable ones)?

    What account does virtue ethics give of moral motivation? What is the status of emotions in the

    theory? What role is wisdom assigned? How is the possessor of the virtues benefited?

    What is the role of naturalism in such a theory?

    How can virtue ethics escape relativism; or, alternatively, based on its version of naturalism, what account might it offer of objectivism in ethics?

    Finally, what might the rival consequentialist or deontological theories (or any other rule-governed ethical doctrine) say in their defense; or, how might they, in turn, argue against virtue ethics?



Notes – August 24

Utilitarianism –

Act-Utility: Max happiness

Rule-Utility: Good in accordance with rules, rules generated through Max happiness

State of affairs is maximally best/happy through utility-actions.

Deontology –

Categorical imperative

Maxim->subjective principle

Universalize maxims/rules/laws

Will to do what is right because it is right.

Morally right decision vs. Right Moral Decision

Action Guidance vs. Action Assessment

Decision/Action – Try/Fail

Notes – September 2, 2010

The Strong codifiability thesis:

Act-u = one single rule ? (rather all are derived from the single)

V-rules are not such that anyone can employ them.

Moral Wisdom.

She is against the decision procedure.

Moral wisdom + V-rules gives you a non-mechanical answer to a dilemma. Or a virtuous person with a virtuous disposition can tell you the right answers.

2 virtuous people with 2 different answers forces Virtue ethics into moral relativism.

Judgment, intuition, and perception are what is necessary to choose between dilemmic rules.

Permissible/obligatory are different concepts.

Discovery and justification are different.

For Kant, Intuition helps discover maxims, but it does not justify it (the Categorical imperitive, objectively, does it).



Notes – September 7, 2010

It seems to me that the Utilitarian or Deontologist need not resort to God preordaining the impossibility of irresolvable moral dilemmas or magical Laws which make the universe as such. Dilemmas are innately amoral, and this is only understood inside moral experience. I think Hursthouse has misrepresented the moral experience, particularly how it pertains to Decision procedure and how a set dilemma which springs forth from the procedure is amoral within its members, but the set is moral with respect to the other possible answers in that world. She has explained there are irresolvable moral dilemmas, but she surely hasn’t justified it.

There might be irresolvable dilemmas, but not necessarily irresolvable moral dilemmas.



Notes – September 9, 2010

If the decision was right, how could the act be wrong? Etc.

Eudaimonia is valuable, worth pursuing. The best way to pursue Eudaimonia is definitionally moral.



Notes – September 14, 2010

If there really are absolute prohibitions, how is there any room for the virtuous agent to fine tune. The distinction that the rightness of the act was dependent on the character of the virtuous person seems pointless if we assume there are absolute prohibitions. What is the basis of the absolute prohibition?

She talks smack about deontologists use of God as cosmically preventing contradiction of principles. However, she might be asserting the possibility of God cosmically preventing “bad” moral dilemmas or also that there will never be absolute prohibitions that are in conflict with each other. How can she talk smack about one and assert the other?

Foote-

Theological Virtues: Faith, Hope, Charity. These are not found in Aristotle, but rather in Aquinas. Secular Virtues: Courage, Temperance, Justice, Wisdom.

Aristotle thinks wisdom is the intellectual virtue, the others are practical. Foot sees wisdom as being much more practical ‘moral’ virtue.

Foot’s conception of the Will is compatibilist. Desires are extremely important in this account.

Virtues are corrective of vices.

Kant’s notion of Will is that the will must be free. Reason, unlike desires (desire is alien), is the important part of freewill. The crossroads when you must choose between a priori reason and a posteriori desires.

Foot thinks Virtues are beneficial. Hume says: Traits are virtuous when they are pleasant or useful to you or others. Foot is asking, who benefits?

Is wisdom incorporated into each of the virtues, or is it distinct from the other virtues?

Justice benefits the other person, not yourself. Eudaimonia is much like Utility. Maximal benefits no, some benefits, yes.

When the virtue ethics do not benefit, why should we be virtuous? Virtue ethics needs justification beyond Eudaimonia.

Wisdom is connected to Will which is connected to Virtues.



Notes – September 16, 2010

Kant separates Will and Desire.

Foot does not necessarily separate Will and Desire, they are related.

You can subdivide humans into classes with certain skill potential. Apparently, Foot thinks Wisdom is different in that ANY human adult can learn and acquire wisdom.

Notes – September 21, 2010

Desires are non-cognitive. Speaking in terms of cognitive means there is right or wrong, because this is about knowledge.

Wisdom is about what is cognitive and non-cognitive.

Natural attributes: Dispositions/inclinations sum up to be the tendency of a person, essentially, “character”  The paradigm case.

Desires are different (but related) to dispositions.

Emotions, Desires, Will, Reasons, Dispositions.

Continent/fully virtuous

The alcoholic has a strong will to overcome his desires to drink. He is continent.

Incontinent people suffer from conflicting desires.



Notes – September 23, 2010

Emotions are incidental to Kant.

How can a Mafioso act correct?

Kant is talking about the rightness of the action, not the character of the person. Virtue ethicists can’t divide the two though.



Notes – September 30, 2010

Should virtue be defined independently of emotions? Should then the emotions be derived from virtue (dependently)? Is Hursthouse using circular reasoning?

Can intrinsically morally valuable emotion defined by virtue? Is what makes virtue intimately defined by emotions?

She seems to be making virtues and emotions parasitic on each others definition.

Virtues + Emotions may be necessary for the right sort of “being”. The ultimate state of the virtuous person has the right virtues and emotions. The issue is whether or not emotions are necessary components for ‘doing’ the right action. Kant would say that emotions are neither necessary or sufficient for doing the right action.

Right action (devoid of emotions) – “jump overboard to save the drowning person”

Right action (with emotions) – “feels it is necessary to” (and in fact does) “jump overboard to save the drowning person”

Imagine the rape victim who goes on to law school. Her feelings for justice are strong in virtue of something which doesn’t seem to be in her control.

Kant: Emotions are subjective, not dependable, and unnecessary to do what is right.

Can you tame emotions? Are you in control over those emotions? If so, can’t we say that this is a mental action? Can we not say that the virtue ethicist is claiming simultaneous mental action of selecting the right emotion and performing the right physical action, only the do you have the sum, actual “right action”.

We aren’t divorcing the action from the subject, and vacuously judging the action? Hmm..

Are emotions necessary to have virtue?

Virtue – “right reason” + “right emotion” => “right action”

To what extent do we have control over our emotions? To what extent are we responsible for our emotions? Getting gray hair…is something I’m not responsible for? Virtue ethicists are very inclined to say we have control over them, and thus we are morally responsible for them.

Kant, of course, denies that emotions are in any way rational. We don’t seem to have less degree of control over our emotions in the Kantian view of ethics than we do in Virtue ethics.

Are we responsible in terms of cultivating and habituating? Previous mental states seem to determine our future ones, no?

Emotions are a part of the will. How can we define virtue in terms of the will? Hmm..

Insofar as the emotions are rational they are cognitive. Emotions, to Hursthouse, seem to have both rational and irrational aspects. They are in between.

The desiderative aspect of the mind part rational and part irrational. How these two connect together is very unclear.

Instinctive emotion and ‘reason/willed’ emotion are separate.

Education of emotions suggests they can be changed. Conditioning is irrational though?



Notes – October 5, 2010

Rightness of the action

Virtuousness of the agent

As a person is developing morally, some people will have initially strong dispositions to do what is wrong, and others will have the opposite, and other in between. Kant thinks you can start out as being non-virtuous, but through repeated applications of reason, you will arrive at being virtuous.

Kant thinks you can act correctly, even with a poor disposition, such as racism. Hursthouse thinks that they can’t. You need the right disposition to really perform the right act. Your disposition in an integral defining component of your act.

Why are you acting? Know thyself (to Kant). Kant thinks it cannot be a commandment to always get your motive right because motivation is so complex.

You might initially be a racist and still come to do what is right. After future reflection, you may come to realize that were had believed and perhaps done some wrong in the past.

Only a virtuous person can do what is virtuous. If you aren’t virtuous, then you can’t do what is right (because you aren’t virtuous).

Central is that Hursthouse thinks Virtue can give an account of emotions where other accounts can’t. Virtue has both ‘reason’ and ‘emotion’ in her eyes as well.

Virtue ethics account for doing through being.

Are emotions something for which are morally responsible? Hursthouse thinks so.

Kant thinks the right moral action cannot be determined by the right moral emotions. Hursthouse disagrees here. They are inextricably linked in Hursthouse’s mind.



Chapter 6

Phillipa Foot/Bernard Williams: believe moral reasons are separate from other reasons. They think there is no reason for us to believe that: If there is a conflict between the two sorts of reasons, then moral reasoning always trumps the other reasons.

Hursthouse is giving an account of acting for the sake of moral reasons.

Moral motivation

Kant: I think of a subjective principle, a maxim, and I ask if I can universalize it. If I can, then I have the morally right thing.

Moral motivation for Hursthouse is a ‘range of things’. There are many moral reasons to ‘act courageously’.

Kant thinks there is a singular moral law-based reason to be morally motivated. Hursthouse thinks there can be multiple possible reasons to be morally motivated.

Moral motivation will define not just how we act but also how we are. Moral motivation influences both being and doing.

If someone lacks a virtuous disposition, then it seems they lack virtuous/moral motiviation.

An act is right iff it is something a virtuous agent would characteristically do. This is the sort of disposition that defines rightness. Are you responsible in that moment for your disposition if you can’t immediately change it?

The philanthropist acts morally and ‘fairly’ well, but the fully virtuous person is acts better.

Is there a difference between virtuous and fully virtuous? Maybe. The philanthropist might has some virtue, but certainly isn’t fully virtuous to Hursthouse.

Does the fully virtuous person characteristically have the right moral reasons and the right emotions? Yes. The right emotions making them fully virtuous where the philanthropist is not.

Hursthouse thinks philosophical language fails to describe the moral fabric of our experience. One might be virtuous without being capable of meeting the explication-communication requirements. Virtue is compatible with inarticulacy.

Notes – October 7, 2010

It is wrong to think, according to Hursthouse, that philosophical/sophisticated reasoning will be exactly what the virtuous person will agree to. (pg 130)

Imagine a philosopher who is trying to understand the activity of a virtuous person. The phil wants to be able to describe virtuous person and action. Normal virtuous people don’t use sophisticated language, so philosophers shouldn’t use it to describe what normal virtuous people do and how they think and what reasoning they are using.

Scientists try to describe the physical universe. You can be wrong or right about it, but that is how you do science.

Philosophers use ethical theories to try to describe the moral (aspect of the) universe. Our words

You cannot have genuine philosophical understanding of virtue without already having some virtue.

V1, v2, v3, vn. – All or nothing.

D1(v1), D1(v2), D1(v3), D1(vn) – Same degree

F1(D1(v1), D1(v2)), F2(D0(v3), D0(v4), D0(v5)), Fn – Families. Requires that cosmically disunited and independent.

Why must all the virtues have the same degree? You can require that full, 100% virtue of one requires 100% of them all without being forced to claim that less than full virtue can have varying rates of virtue.

Think of gaming with stats. 100 str is minimized with 1 dex?

Notes – October 12

Philosopher: Scientiest:: Moral Theory: Scientific Theory

Aristotle may see our flourishing as having some possible scientific account. Although, unlike other creatures, we obviously have reason.

According to Hursthouse:

The moral philosopher isn’t giving you a good moral theory which describes a virtuous person in the same way that scientists can give a scientific theory which describes the scientific world.

Philosophers explicate this process for their own benefit. The virtuous person need not have the ‘words’ (or even, supposedly, the ‘concepts’) which philosophers use. E.g. A philosopher has the notion of eudaimonia, but the virtuous person may not possess the concept.

Moral ideas are neither sufficient nor necessary conditions for being virtuous.

The virtuous agent must follow from a settled character.

Do you need to be able to reliably give the moral reasons? Yes.

Is it that you as a virtuous person can’t explicitly state the philosophical ideas behind your moral reasoning, or that they don’t have any conception of the ideas behind the moral reasoning? No concepts either. Philosopher’s are guilty of assuming this is implicit.

Moral philosophy seems useless, to Hursthouse. It is an intellectual game.

Unity of Virtues should be intimately connected with right action.

Kant would think that we are learning and developing our character, entirely guided by the categorical imperative, to have virtuous character.

Countrafactual situations. If you do something because you believe in God, and then they become an atheist, will that person continue to do the right thing? If the answer is no, then Hursthouse will claim that the values aren’t ‘deeply grounded’.

Character reflects deeply grounded values you hold. This aspect of the irtuous person is what would define ‘rightness’.

What does it mean for the virtuous person to have a moral reason? They’ll offer something very simple, but I think there are many more reasons as the foundation to that which the virtuous person must hold. Hursthouse will call that foundation too philosophical and fancy and unnecessary for the virtuous person to implicitly or explicitly hold.

Keep “necessary” and “sufficient” conditions in mind. This is vital to chapter 7.

Deductivist model or particularist model’s, apparently, benefit only philosophers (not lay persons).

If particularistic models are true, then this is relativism. “doing well” is a big issue.

If “doing well” not relativistic, then surely there is a general principle.

Reading: Michael Stalker’s paper

Notes – October 14

Chapter 7 is about:

Degree  Belief

Degree  Character

Hursthouse argues against the all-or-nothing ascription.

Inverse akrasia – When you act contrary to your own belief, but end up acting correctly.

Unity of Virtue

Duham-Quine Thesis:

Beliefs can’t be tested against the world one by one (atomistic), but rather collections of beliefs must be tested against the world (holistic).

Hursthouse is claiming that our beliefs can’t be separated in this atomic sense.



Children do not have their own values; they are imitators. Well grounded values would stand up to counterfactuals.

Pg 136, footnote 12; the counterfactual claim is perhaps opposed.



What constitutes practical wisdom? How is it related/connected to the other virtues?



Degrees of: Virtues, beliefs, feelings, character, practical wisdom



If a nazi (someone lacking virtue entirely) does something that appears right, it isn’t right because they lack true moral motivation, according to Hursthouse’s theory.



Inverse akrasia is odd in that we don’t know whether or not the agent is actually morally motivated.

Notes – October 19, 2010

Who you are as a person vs. what obligations you are attempting to fulfill.

Multiple sets of values?

Friendships and family can’t be made on duty.

Bifurcation, split, schizophrenia of the sad philanthropist.

Visiting the friend in the hospital because of duty or because you are his friend?

Pathological love vs. practical love.

You cannot have a duty to love someone at the emotional level, because it is not up to you. Practical love can be demanded though. Practical love is moral love.

If you are interested in legislation, you are interested in getting things done. Teleology has replaceable means.

Humean emotions (reason is impotent. Reasons is the slave of the passions) vs. Kantian reason as the motivation.

Stocker means pathological love.

For whose sake are you loving?

Duty is the end or Humans are the end?

Indirection, unintended consequences. If you love someone else, you’ll be selfish in economics theory.

Notes – October 26, 2010 – Last Test

Direction, ‘what is right’ is external or internal? Externally applied to the virtuous person or internally flows out of the virtuous person.

“Reliable sensitivity” is when an agent reads and appreciates and weighs the precise factors of a situation. This is McDowell’s idea of moral knowledge. Either the deliverance of the sensitivity or the sensitivity itself would constitute knowledge.

Virtue is identified as knowledge. “Virtue is knowledge”, “Know thyself”

What is the difference between continent behavior and virtuous behavior?

Will and reliable sensitivity go on to be the proper explanation for what the virtuous person does.

The virtuous person perceives the situation differently than the continent person. The virtuous person can ‘silence’ their desires to do what is virtuous in a way that the continent person cannot in perceiving the situation.

Sensitivity might be perception. Deliverance is your immediate response to what you are perceiving.

Objective situations impose requirements on your behavior.

“perceptual capacity” in this is taken to be an ethical capacity. It isn’t just ‘seeing’ someone is wearing a yellow shirt. The perceptual capacity is understanding what the situation morally demands of me.

The virtuous person doesn’t need to juggle between ‘being kind to one person’ and ‘not violating the rights of another person’. The virtue person’s virtue is activated so as to silence the desires. There are no rules.

Virtuous person does not weigh or juggle or balance factors as contending reasons.

Desires and inclinations shape your perceptions (what you reliably perceive). This comes before the will.

“silencing” your desire is not an activity of the will. The process of silencing one’s desires comes before the will. The ‘bad’ feelings are dispelled. This silence is nearly instinctive and spontaneous. It isn’t so obvious when the choice is between two things which both look pretty decent.

Notes- October 28, 2010

Major premise – universal

Minor premise – particular

Conclusions – ought to do = reasons



McD argues against the codifiability of how one should behave.



If add 2 is the rule:

S1 – 2, 4, 6, 8…1000, 1002, 1004, 1006…

S2 – 2, 4, 6, 8…1000, 1004, 1008, 1012…

What does it mean to ‘follow a rule’?

We make the assumption that the individual who has been asked to follow a rule has in his mind a certain psychological mechanism, and that mechanism is what he consults to make the right series. Wittgenstein denies the existence of this mechanism.

If you have moral rules…say “one ought to save a drowning person”.

You can follow the rules in a variety of instances, and then suddenly if you don’t save a drowning person, you are then saying “I’m following the rule”…

We don’t have enough information to make perfect rules. S1 and S2 follow different rules because they didn’t have enough starting information to generate the actual rule.

The “form of life” justifies what you do and what you produce. It is exceedingly subjective view.



Notes – November 2, 2010

Non-cognitivist says we need more than a theory, we also need a desire to make an account of an action.

Orectic – Major Premiss – Desire – Necessary motivation, motivational energy

Minor premise – particularities of the circumstance

Theoretical reason

Which objective features of a situation does the virtuous agent pay attention to?

The virtuous agent has a remarkable perception of particular times and places where you can perceive the ethical reality.

C1 matches F1 where concerns matches Factors about the objective situation.

The interaction between the major and minor premise is important.

Utility has preordained weights of what is valuable. McD says there aren’t preordained ways to define which factors are salient or not.

You can’t form the Orectic by compounding the “appetitive state” with the motivationally inert perception of the objective situation.

Can’t justify what you are doing from some external standpoint, it must be within the Form of Life.

Ethical reality is relative to the objective situation. Or is the ethical reality relative to the form of life?

Ethical reality is in direct conflict with the notions of Form of life.

McD bills himself as a cognitivist, but he obviously isn’t.



Notes – November 9, 2010

If you list the virtues, which are connected to eudaimonia. The question is whether or not there is an external view, so that we can justify whether or the list of virtues is the right list.

Is there some independent objective criteria which you can use to justify the life of virtue?

Internal View: only was who is brought up well and is actually virtuous can actually see whether or not the virtues really are beneficial and worth doing.

Virtue is a “bet” – it is most likely, has the highest probability to bring about Eudaimonia.

Hursthouse focuses on eudaimonia where the egoist and skeptic focus on pleasure. It seems that happiness, however, shouldn’t be connected with what is right.

Sensible Knave, Virtue or Pleasure/Mafioso?

If you are choking on water, what will you wash it down with? This is why we can’t decisively refute the wicked who cannot understand the virtuous argument.

Virtue ethics is veiled egoism. Justifying Virtue qua eudaimonia, the claim is that unlike the egoist/skeptic, the virtue ethicist has the accurate/correct path to attaining happiness.

Aristotelian Enterprise connects ‘morality’ to ‘happiness’.

If the virtues do not contribute to eudaimonia then they can’t be justified on the ‘correct list’.

Hare’s argument is that there is a higher chance that the virtues lead to happiness than the eogisti’s theory. Hursthouse doesn’t like the empirical claim.

The overlap of the egoist and the virtue ethicist is that virtue produces some degree of happiness, justified in terms of a non-moral good.



Notes – November 11, 2010

Internalist thinks there is no neutral, independent (of character) way to understand virtue. Happiness is subjective.

Hursthouse is somewhat of an externalist.

The virtuous and skeptic may have two different views of life. Perhaps they have overlap amongst their views. If they do have overlap, could we defend the virtuous life to the skeptic?

To what extent is there an overlap? Is there one? There seems to be something, the virtuous part which doesn’t overlap with the skeptic, that can’t be translated or communicated effectively to the immoralist. The translation of happiness, in this case, the justification that is, will not be total and complete to the skeptic.



To some extent, understanding the happiness of the form of life of the virtuous requires that you are in fact within that form of life.

What is the role of Eudaimonia here?

Perhaps the overlap will be birthdays and marriages.

How do you justify the sort of act that marres you? You can’t do it on the basis of eudaimonia. The section which doesn’t overlap with the skeptic/egoist doesn’t seem to be based on eudaimonia, but simply virtue because virtue is right, not because it results in eudaimonia.

All forms of life have things in common which make us happy, etc. That is the overlap. This is the universal.

Hursthouse thinks Virtue can maximize the sort of happiness that the skeptic/egoist seeks. And, it is here that she thinks she can defend virtue to them, to communicate and translate it to them.

If Eudaimonia is the justification for morality, then whenever morality would conflict with eudaimonia, as Eudaimonia is primitive, whatever would bring about Eudaimonia in the moment, whether moral or not, is what we should do, right?

I don’t like how Virtue ethics avoids Justice. – The very problems of justice which require us to do things which aren’t in our favor are the very sort which are anti-eudaimonic, and against the justification for the virtuous character by consequence of Hursthouse’s argument.

The most wise, sensible knave is he who chooses to follow the principle, but in the exceptions, takes the advantage.

Those who have a deficiency in character enough to be virtuous when it brings about eudaimonia, but chooses to not as the virtuous person in exceptional cases which result in eudaimonia for being vicious and lacks eudaimonia for being virtuous seems to maximize eudaimonia, not the virtuous person.

If you describe morality as enlightened self-interest, it must be one which is informed by phronesis and moral wisdom.



Naturalism – The only things ontologically available are things defined by what is ordinary or natural, observable.

“Flourishing well” is a natural concept.



Notes – November 16, 2010

What constitutes a ‘Good’ (naturally good) Plant and Animal (which are non-rational)?

The 4 Aspects

Parts

Operations

Actions

Emotions/Desires (social is an end)



The 4 Ends:

Individual Survival

Continuance of the Species

Pain, Pleasure

Social



Neutral to Moral predicate, but there is something normative?



When you add rationality (talking about human beings), does this picture change?

The goodness of a particular distribution of ‘aspects’ is determined by the “ends” as a criteria.



Notes – November 18, 2010

The Virtues of the Animal Kingdom: Courage, Charity, Honesty, Justice, Liberality.

It seems that these traits might go towards the proper/virtuous makeup of human beings as well.

It is because Humans have reason that it completely disrupts the relationship between the animal kingdom and the human kingdom.

Animals are not endowed with rationality, and thus animals are considerably constrained by genetics and the environments.

Hursthouse differentiates humans based upon reason. It is difficult to understand what the constraints are, however, for human societies, etc.

For Kant, reason transcends the natural world. It doesn’t for Hursthouse. Reasons be contained within the physical culture, but the reasons which justify the rightness of action transcend and are independent of the culture. Hursthouse seems to disagree.

Human flourishing must be defined in naturalistic terms.

The variety of goals of human beings seems so broad that it isn’t easy to see what counts as immoral.

Are the four ends and the wide variety and capacity of humans so broad that we can’t easily point out any particular things which are wrong qua human being?

Virtues are those natural traits which are bring about/promote the four ends.

Particular act of a particular individual is the usual scope of ‘right act’.

The individual may violate the ends, it seems, and still be acting virtuously.

The ends are linked with the ethical. The ethical must be confined which is entirely naturalistic. There might be some actiosn which run counter to the ends, and yet we want to say ‘that’s ok’ and this ‘really was the right thing to do’. For that individual and particular act, it is ok.

Should particular actions be consistent with the naturalistic ends of humans in general?

It isn’t ‘too determinate’ as she worries about, but rather not ‘determinate enough’. It seems that simply anything will meet the requirements.

Even wolves and bees have variation in their lives—their lives aren’t fully determinate. Human beings have far greater variations, precisely because they have reason. It is reason that gives us richness and diversity to our lives. That diversity is entirely permissible in her view.

How much latitude must we give? What is morally acceptable is too wide, intuitively.

What are the ranking/priorities of the ends? Lacks structure in the ‘ends’.





It doesn’t seem that the objectivity of the ends would allow for flexibility. She seems to think it does though. The way she describes it, it is so flexible that it may even be relativistic.



If reason would lead someone to do what is wrong in a particular society, what does Hursthouse think actually constrains it?



Notes – November 30, 2010

Inventing Right and Wrong, J.L. Mackie, diesre and intents are a necessary part of making sense of Right and wrong action. Predicates of “Red rose” make sense, but not right and wrong. So, his argument show ethics is entirely subjective.

Aristotelian Virtues are supposed to be some objective fact about the world in the same way that bees and roses ought to be. Humans also have some way in which they objective ought to be.

We attribute certain properties to the rose (it is a good one, for example); we can also attributes analogous properties to humans.

“ethical disagreement” for Bernard Williams levy problems against objectivity?

She discusses/defends her third claim, that virtue of the individual and virtue qua humanity are intertwined.

Non-moral facts can be brute facts, but not moral facts, those can’t be brute facts.

She thinks we can’t expect more than a demonstration of the set of virtues and conventions of any particular society + empirical facts.

As a counter, imagine two societies with identical empirical facts, but they have different coherent pictures of the virtues and of what is convention.

Empirical facts can’t deny and contradict claims about the virtues, but do they verify the virtues?

Monogamy in marriage for the 3 Abrahamic religions is wrong, but is it wrong for atheists?

Is it possible to satisfy the same empirical claims for two societies, can you have two different societies exemplifying two different sets of virtues (even if they agree to empirical facts). If so, then the ethical theories of each culture is just convention and norms.

She could only demonstrate objectivity by saying: that given the empirical facts, only one ethical system can result and be built from it. Underdeterminism of science makes this problematic though. If you can’t show that a single empirical theory results (and not many) from a single set of empirical facts, how could do you have a single moral theory result?

Platonic world can’t be reduced to naturalism.

There isn’t an objective world, only an empirical world. The virtues correspond objectively to th e virtues. Is she now appealing to brute facts. She doesn’t want the external view, only the internal view.

She might think there is more than one objective reality. And, thus more than one objective moral reality.

Ethical disagreements between two societies, if they exist, what do you mean by it?

You may not know exactly how much to give to Haiti, even if there might objectively be a particular exacty amount you ought. This is epistemic indeterminacy.

It could be that 100$ is generous, and 5$ stingy, and an indeterminate continuum between those amounts.

If the concepts of right and wrong are to be abandoned in certain circumstances, it seems as if the concept of objectivity is diluted.



Notes – Study Session, December 1

Motivating reason, reliable sensitivity of virtuous agent – non-virtuous agents can’t match it. The form of life you wish to lead + reliable sensitivity, combined, will give motivation, according to McD.



2, 4, 6, 8, 10….11, 13, 15

Rule: add 2 to 10, then add 1, then add 2.

You can’t know you have the right rule. There is no objective rule.

What is that he means by rationality?

If you talk about reason in the sam way as the Kantians, then you are saying there is some rigid rule you must follow. He is challenging the codifiability thesis.

“This is where my spade turns” – meanin, in the ultimate analysis, there is nothing that transcends my particularities and form of life. You can find a rule. There are no rails to catch onto for guidance.

It seems as aren’t any objective rules, but you can’t do what you damn well please. Pg 149, last paragraph. He isn’t making a skeptical point.

Wittgenstein himself gives us arguments as to why we can go in different directions of life.

He hasn’t provided an argument about why the other person’s form of life or rules or ideas of morality won’t ‘come adrift’, unlike Wittgenstein. So, it seems he has left himself open to a possible attack on his argument that in following the ‘form of life’, that relativism or skepticism follows from it.



Aristotle thinks our moral lives are so complex that we ought not be seeking precision because it isn’t available in moral philosophy. Since there aren’t any rules, there isn’t a major premise.

The is the attack on the notion of general rules which Aristotle might give:

What you should do

This is impossible to Aristotle. This is why the Virtuous person, as a notion, is necessary. Note that the rule-based thinking requires justification for why things are right, in some way. Whereas for Aristotle, there is no need to justify it.



Aristotle thinks Eudaimonia, engaging in the activity that gods are, would be the right thing for humans to do. The gods would reflect, and they would reflect on what is most knowable. The height of eudaimonia would be contemplation of the eternal. Eudaimonia as comtemplation. It is that the ultimate or or a part of everything that is worth doing?

Hursthouse does not give a detailed account of eudaimonia.



Eudaimonia is a purposely vague word. Shit.



How does virtue ethics, justified by eudaimonia, not collapse into a form of consequentialism? If eudaimonia is primitive, how isn’t it consequential?



Virtuous agent justifies virtue for sake of virtue, not for eudaimonia or the four goals. But, what justifies the virtues are the four goals and or eudaimonia. Why do we need the virtuous person?

Why are these virtues? The only justification seems consequentialist, they satisfy these four goals.

Do the requirements of virtue ever violate the 4 ends?

Argument between Bernard Williams and Hursthouse. Williams is a moral skeptic or moral nihilist. Williams work springs from Charles Darwin, in some sense. He argues that Aristotle’s naturalistic project for ethics in particular is based on certain teleological considerations. Williams argues that this teleological view is no longer a modern scientific view (destroyed by Darwin). He thinks that the teleological view can be entirely discarded. If you describe teleology, from Darwin, there can’t be a function of humans (fulfilled function = flourishing). Teleology is reduced to the causal connections of evolution.

He makes a second point; look at the history of man. He uses the word ‘bricolage’. He argues that humanity has no end, that there is no morality.

Hursthouse wants to argue that when Darwin replaces Aristotle’s explanation of the species, he must be able to explain what consistutes a ‘good’ animal. And, from this, she believes that we can’t throw Aristotle away in total.

She also thinks that the History of man as understood by Williams is too narrow. Science is based on certain assumptions for which we have no proof, but we make those assumptions to do science. Likewise, moral philosophy is based on certain assumptions for which we have no proof, but we make those assumptions in order to do moral philosophy.

It is better to have the virtue of hope, that there is a possibility for humans to have Eudaimonia than not to, just as the sciences have a virtue of hope.

His claim is that Darwinian theory lacks any sense of normativity. We aren’t progressing towards some perfection.

She thinks the Darwinian view must explain Aristotelian Teleleogy. But, if Darwinian is purely mechanicistic, lacking teleology, then how could the Aristotelian view be transformed by the mechanistic view while keeping the teleology?

The Darwin cannot translate the Teleological view in purely mechanistic language.

Good species in terms of what? What is the unit of selection? Is the unit the gene? An individual of the species? How about species? Interspecies?

Darwinians can give an account of ‘healthiness’, but only in Darwinian terms. Measurements of reproductive capacities, etc.

Giving an account of altruism isn’t easy to define. Symbiotic relationships as well. We have to be careful to realize that the Darwinian explanation is not teleological, but rather physicalist and mechanistic in nature exclusively.

Hursthouse thinks she can use Darwinian terms and explanations to make moral claims about the ‘goodness’ or ‘badness’ of human beings. The connection between the biological and the ethical need to be layed out carefully, though (I don’t’ see how she can do it).

Studying the history of bees is easy. They have obvious patterns, etc. Williams thinks that humans live very dynamic and unpredictable lives that you can’t say that they have the same sort of regularity that creatures in nature demonstrate. Either Hursthouse will have to restrict the viable options, or the biology lacks some explanatory power to define why there is so much variation in humanity.

The historical argument, to Williams, that humans are mess. It seems that from the historical record, we can’t justify how humans should be.

There is no global justification of a theory against global skepticism. Both for science and for morality.
