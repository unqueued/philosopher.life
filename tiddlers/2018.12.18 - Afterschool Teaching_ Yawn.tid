title: 2018.12.18 - Afterschool Teaching: Yawn

More chance to listen and watch today. The amount of mammalian signaling in this place is overwhelming. It is a lot to listen to. It's the last day of class until the 3rd of January. It took me a bit, but I've memorized their names.

Matt is the man in charge. Okay. Dodgeball again. He has little justification for what he does and regularly breaks his own rules without virtue.

I have been Imagine Dragons'd out. It becomes noise.

New game to me: //Baby, Backpack, and Bench//

//Sookums// is tag where you pair up with linked arms. The chasee can link arms to jettison the other side (making them the new chasee). Those in socks are in trouble, lol. 

Matt is capriciously bossing kids around without merit. 

Standard tropes apply. Without thinking about the implications, the familiarity is pleasant.

I'm adoring listening to the girls sing. Ironically, no explicit lyrics or discussion of sex in every day class life, but the song can be about sex and they can definitely dance as sexily as they want (just as long as it's with the song). Arbitrary Rules! Lots of simulation in this prison. Matt clearly enjoys controlling the girls through DJing (and tricking them). It's interesting to see.

I'm considering having phone time as part of class now. Go find your skinnerboxes and drug yourselves out of reality kiddos.

It is not every day that I see folks teaching 11-year-olds to shake their ass and titties. I don't have a problem with it as long as we teach all the things that matter. Well, if you can't math, you better know how to attract mates with dat jiggle.

It is sad to see these kids who have been doing this prison thing for 12 hours today, and by the end of it, they are really feeling it. =(

I must listen and think.
