The Feyd fight just doesn't make sense. He never fights anyone who isn't already crippled, right? Why should we think he is trained to fight? Yeah, his cheat is there, but it's too close even with it. This is forced.

Irulan's commentary continues to be a wonderful mechanism to me. The book has a metativity about itself that I appreciate, and it extends beyond its own vocabulary.
