!! Think of the best teacher you ever had. Why were they a good teacher?

I answered this before: [[2018.04.15 - Prompted Introspection Log: Best Teacher]]. Best [[gfwiwcgws]] is correct, lol. This question is not getting easier to answer for me. It's not like I don't care about it. I've been a shitty student and teacher for a long time now. I've been wrong about plenty of my teachers. [[Saint Plato]] has been a helluva of a teacher, but that list is really long. Alright, standard teacher notion:

I have 11 years of post-secondary education ([[WINTCIS]], and further, which is not the claim that education ends afterward, but we're after the "standard teacher" here). A few stick out, but I can still hear one in my head. 

Saint Husain Sarkar teaches every student who walks into his class what it means to be a philosopher. He's a monster sometimes, so methodical, even his own writing doesn't tell the truth of how much work he's done, obsessive (he reads some of the books he teaches dozens of times right before he teaches them), has the best paper-grading method I've ever seen. He's prepared for class in a way that isn't outlined; only someone crazy self-taught could have the guttural instincts to do what he does. He'll pick up a new book cluster and make a class on it with a profound perspective; he doesn't hold much back. He'll tell you that you are stupid to your face, lol (nicely, ofc). He's meticulous. Even if he's wrong, it's for a good reason. He's a man of integrity in the dialectic (which is not the claim he is flawless).

His rhetoric is wisely chosen, and he means what he says. I know it. I've watched the man weep while he spoke of [[Socrates|WWDD]] and his recently deceased father; talk about uncomfortable (I'm tearing up again while writing it). 

If you are comfortable in Sarkar's class, you are doing it wrong. My god, everyone brought their fucking A-game to his class, and nobody took his classes who weren't there to fucking learn. He isn't just a researcher, an author, a wrestler: he teaches. Some professors mail it in. This was his vocation. He's not well-liked by his department, but no one is going to argue with him (such a dangerous wrestler). He's a teacher who knows where he stands and where you stand in relation to him, and he's a damned good guide. I wish there were so many more of him in the world, and I adore how he would know thoroughly what that means to me. He only might be 50 years older than me, but I couldn't be half the teacher he is with 500 more years of practice.
