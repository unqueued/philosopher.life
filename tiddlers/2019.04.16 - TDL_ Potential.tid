* Looks like my wife is okay with the sound enough to take the risk
** We had an impromptu family discussion about it, and the kids understood what we were worried about quite well. 
** I might be able to muffle it a bit more.
** I cleaned up the wind damage on the siding, and I'm going to pitch the table. I'm going to need help. I might need to take it apart.
* I just had some trouble with m14's connection to the VPN. I do not understand why.
** Probably need to look for other options. I refuse to have  this running on a server I do not own. I've seen a fuckton of people struggle with Termux options too. Bob is such a fragile tool. 
* I desperately need to clean.
