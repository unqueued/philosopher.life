Shit starts to get real. 

I love to see rebellion against the double standard. It's lovely to watch HP fight back. I don't know why I still feel strongly about it at 33 years old, but I do.

One thing that drives me insane about the Dementor incident is that Rowling, even though you might argue otherwise, clearly fails to represent the true evils of those in power. She makes them look like a more stupid than evil. Fuck that.

I hope my patronus would be an albino dementor, or maybe tiddies.

Muggle relations continue to get more complicated, and I think the continuity continues to get continually worse.

Some humanity in Petunia, just a bit. It's a curious thing.

I feel "in the world" with HP much stronger here. Why?

Tonks is hawt.

The conspiracy angle, the energy investment into HP's security, is somehow believable (and yet, fishy).

Having been kicked out of public school myself for hacking (not malicious at all), I can feel the pain. That was an important point for me growing up.
