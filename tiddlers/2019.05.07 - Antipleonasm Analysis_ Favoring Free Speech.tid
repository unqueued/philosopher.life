title: 2019.05.07 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Favoring Free Speech

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Goebbels was in favor of freedom of speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise.

It is surprisingly difficult to get people to admit this, and it usually boils down to a moral and political distinction they have conflated. This is the anarchic aspect of his Leftism shining through, and I'm in strong agreement.

There are lots of exceptions I want to try to throw up, but I can't categoricalize them. I need more time to answer this crazy hard problem.
