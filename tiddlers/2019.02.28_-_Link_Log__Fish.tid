*** LOL! I'm fine with being skeptical, but you still have to give an account of morality, and that alone is going to tame your argument. I think you don't have one, and you just want to look like you do.

*** I cannot speak more highly of being ourselves anonymously. The centralization of power cannot be answered any other way. Only the [[T42T]] Ring of Gyges Bombadillers can defeat evil, and our window closes.

*** Oh, you were right at the threshold. Could you please take one step further? Show 'em how it's done, pansy. Your publisher is on my shitlist though.

* Think About It
** https://redalemeden.com/blog/2019/we-need-chrome-no-more
*** Common post. I agree that we have to try. 
*** I'm a poweruser of my browsers (by no means an expert), and I can tell you that FF is still a giant pile of shit in a number of metrics just by feel and how I monitor my computer resources. I've yet to find a browser to rule them all.
*** The fact is that I do need Blink to use parts of the web. In fact, I have to regularly move out of my browser into a clean default.
*** I'm annoyed by people who claim they stick with Chrome for everything because they use it for dev. Use it for dev, and use FF for everything else.

*** I wish I saw this kind of reasoning put to use for decentralizing power instead.
** https://hbr.org/1990/09/why-be-honest-if-honesty-doesnt-pay
*** First, I have no idea why HBR keeps popping up for me. I need to pay more attention to my curation.
*** If you can't destroy the honest shopkeeper with the metaphysics of morals, you have no fucking argument.

*** No significant address of the centralization of power. That cannot be trusted.
** https://quillette.com/2019/02/24/we-must-defend-free-thought/
*** I, of course, value freespeech. When you start trying to decentralize your site and radically push for anti-censorship hardware and software, come talk to me. I don't think you really try to practice what you preach.

*** Yikes. You are dishonest about your reactionary position. Perhaps one day I'll come out of the woodwork for some headhunting. I'm not ready.

*** Confirm My Bias, but unfortunately, I think the Big Boys WANT you to believe self-hosting can't be safe.

*** I've seen a million. Smacks of false virtue-signaling and feels like misdirection from the real evils I see.

* Interesting

*** I am a differentiationist, and I don't buy OOO all the way down. You must answer me: [[Good]] for the sake of what in [[The End]]? I think we can only ever make progress in how we apply [[The Golden Rule]].
