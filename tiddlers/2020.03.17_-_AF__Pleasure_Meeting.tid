Hi [[h0p3]],
Because the Covid19 outbreak situation is rapidly changing, I sent out a notice this morning informing my current students and/or parents of my decision to err on the side of precaution and suspend classes through the end of April. If by then the situation has improved I will send you a notice about resuming lessons. You are still welcome to bring [[j3d1h]] this Thursday as planned - I have no symptoms and am healthy, but If you want to hold off until the situation improves I fully understand.
Regards, [[AF]]
