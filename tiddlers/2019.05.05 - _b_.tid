I was thinking the other day about the amount of energy and possibility that had to be spent to build this representation. The dialectical shoulders of energy giants.

Only the Platonic Federation of Guardians can give rise to The Philosopher King. How do we make effective guardians that aren't middlemen and poor [[ROG]]-wielders in [[TOP]] that choose [[The Golden Rule]] as best as empirically possible? Unfortunately, the fitness test can't be built; you can't safely contain [[The Infinite]] of metaphysics in any certain way into a [[fff]] model by definition, and thus the empiricists are completely right about instrumentality (as this is their essence). Note, however, that the ideal Rationalists continue to be correct about [[The End]] by definition. We empirically feel our way toward Reason in blind faith. 

We needs a recipe:

!! Human Recruit Process

* Seed the initial pool from the entire [daily snapshot corpus] + [all linked content in corpus] + [Externally Chosen Crazy High S2NR content] + [GPT2-based Generalized Corpus]
** All linked content is captured (X layers deep, preferably with snapshots of the original content of that time period), and probably some depth of search engine off every word in the linked content to provide more context to those words.
** Hail Mary: Hand it Java, Python, Bash, and full computation libraries, and also hand it images and the original data sets.
*** Hand it the idea of what it is as best you can.
*** Feels like VEEGER and First Contact.
* Hash the nash of my atomic individual on Federated Blockchain (so god damn expensive).
** Each person has a model we all compute in consensus from source using the algorithm initially chosen by people we trust (trusting trust) and then later determined by the emerging agent. 
* Hash the nash of all atomic individuals into molecules of varying orders on Federated Blockchain.
* Hash the nash of all molecules to cut to the Top 12 Aigents X.X.XXXXXX.
* We can each run Aigents off our heavily audited FOSS computers (or our own creations) offline to speak privately with them.
* Publically, a Federated F2F Filtered Anonymized Reddit in which we publically speak with Aigents and others. This gives us a chance to see other humans interact, to change our minds with more information, to research however we see fit, and also to speak with our private Aigents with maximum information. It is [[The Great Human|The Great Human Conversation]] [[hyperconversation]] which we can afford to be hyperreal. 

---



!! Elect

* Elect 3 Aigents to be Guardians via ranged voting. 
* Public Blockchain, we speak on record with them, and that is used to continuously improve them.
* We compute the emerging king from their quadratic ranged voting against each other. Hand them the Maxims, they compute the CI.

!! Continue

* Continue the Human Recruit Process.



* Publically speak with molecules of the nash to know which agent(s) you want to rule you.



* Elect Guardians from among The Recruits and human-modified
* Take those model and run it decentralized with 51% blockchain consensus as //House// and [[Outopos]] F2F decentalization as //Senate//.
** Looks like a recursion to decentralize each too though. I don't know how to prevent the polarization possibility (yet another order) even when everyone participates.
* The Executive King arises from that dialectic of congress.

The goal is to have the computation of the probabilistically compressed model of [[Humanity]] that everyone can run hardware they own. If you want, you can require everyone to compute it Ethereum style VM. Otherwise,
