title: Freedom

Meaning is not flat, hierarchyless, meaningless. Not all propositions have equal value. Not all things which are obtains are as good as others, and not all that which obtains is as good as it could have been.


Are we merely cogs of a machinescape? Perhaps we can be modes of a contingent object though!

//See: [[Freewill]]//

A cornerstone question of my persistent identity has been: Am I free? 

This is the splinter in my mind. The apex, cosmic, fundamental existential problem rendered unto my naked self behind an autistic, human cage. I fear I cannot escape it.

Well? Am I free? Are we free? To what extent, degree, and of what kind? What does it mean to be free? 

I suspect that people who pass over this problem are fools. 

I want to understand freedom and agree to it. I want to know the how, what, where, why, when, and who of Freedom. I need to understand it. It is an obsession. It has taken me to a terrible place, and I can't unsee what I have seen. I have been reshaped by a pursuit of freedom, of the necessary conditions for love, empathy, and practical rationality. It rules my familial, religious, political, ethical, existential, epistemic, and technological views of the world. It is the centerpiece of my reality map. 

At that nexus, I am torn between two contradictory ideas, and everything is at stake. I'm being pulled apart. I'm experiencing reality map cataclysm with the problem of freedom at the epicenter. My reality map has been exploding and imploding, and I hope it gives birth to some cosmic liferaft I can hold onto. Like Neo and Agent Smith's real fundamental conflict over Freedom, the Matrix of my reality is being destroyed in an epic battle between different parts of my reality map (which just IS me).

I have studied this concept with knowledgeable people (on the shoulders of giants on the shoulders of cosmic world turtles, etc.). None of them can answer me. They all eventually point to faith. It is a question I must answer for and by myself. 

We are machines in a semi-deterministic world. We have to do what we do. We are slaves to something outside of us. I don't deserve to be enslaved. I don't want to be enslaved. I hate slavery. I don't know how I can live as a slave. 

Even if I wasn't a metaethical+metaphysical slave, I'm still one in practical, everyday life. Whether in a political, practical, moral, or metaethical sense, I feel enslaved. I think we are doomed. I think there is no meaning to this, or if there is, we are the sufferers.

I am enslaved by nurture, by nature, by my context and circumstances, by the concept of freedom itself, by bare and fundamental truth to some part of me. It is as if half of my reality map cries one thing, and the other cries the opposite. I am internally at war.

I must re-shape my personality to be stoic, to no longer care about what I can't control, but to give myself the illusion that there are actually things in my control. I have to lie to myself (and paradoxically, I hate lying, and I love myself) to make my life worth living. Maybe I shape my identity through time. But, even that shaper needs a shaper, ad infinitum. At some point, I can just assume some foundational shaper, but that is faith. 

I am very much against unjustified, unexplored, untested, blind faith. It has burned me too hard. I am skeptical because I know the real cost of having faith and being wrong about it. I am not free with respect to not having faith. It wasn't up to me. You can think of this as Pharoah hardening his heart (or God doing it), but that's the truth. As you have basically accepted: we are just reactions to our causes.

It was my purpose to be free and rational. I cannot have any of one without any of the other (Kant was right). Unfortunately, being free is not rational and being rational is not free. My purpose is neither rational nor free. I have no purpose.

I know I can't have certainty. I'm just looking for confidence, warrant, justification, sufficient reason to accept freedom. Epistemically, we might look at prudence as the answer here. It is pragmatic. But, it comes at the cost of truth. It is not-alethic. It is philosophical suicide. I am killing a part of myself to believe I am free.

Even if I have the faith of my metaethical+metaphysical freedom, I will still not be free. It is just the truth of it. Even if I can delude myself, to force myself through habituation to agree, I won't be actually free. It would still be a lie. Ah, but then I'm still not having faith? Lol. Fuck that.

Let's say we magically envisioned "true" faith here in freedom. I still would not be politically and socially free (there are number of varieties). 

I'm not free or I'm not free. I'm not free.
