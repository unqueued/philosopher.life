!! SO:

* I'm doing it again. It is what it is, right?
** This is a fair way to make sure I'm making progress in both.

!! FO:

* [[New Haven]]
** I may just stick to bullet points. This is so hard to do. Right now, I just need to help myself get anything onto the page. I can practically feel my memory dying.
* [[Mannsville]]
** Just pouring myself into bullet points.
* {[[About]]}
** I swear I did a lot of work today, but it just feels like I shifted things around. I made a bunch of tiny edits. 
** I have stacked up my outline now. I'm trying to think about how it's going to fit together. It's a mess.
** I know this is supposed to take quite a while. I should not feel bad about how poorly it appears right now. This isn't supposed to be an accident, and if were easy, it probably wouldn't really matter that much.
