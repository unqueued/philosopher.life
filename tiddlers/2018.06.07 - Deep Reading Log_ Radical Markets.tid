title: 2018.06.07 - Deep Reading Log: Radical Markets

I like that we attempt to capture the intensity of motivation in QV. I do not know how to make sure this market won't be abused. I'm very worried about it. 

We do need a function that helps us understand when the intense preferences of a minority ought to outweigh the majority. We can't do majority rule precisely. This appears to be an unsolvable problem at first glance. We need more knowledge about what we want this relationship to look like before we attempt to prescribe. 

I am worried about wealthy people subverting this system. 

My worry is that this system is still too fundamentally selfish and that our system won't work unless we rely upon people legitimately being better than they are...

Is this not a stopgap? Is this not a move closer? Well...I don't know.

There is, of course, a way in which allowing selfish, ignorant, or evil people to have such a strong say just doesn't give us the philosopher king.

Okay, what if we did QV to allow one to cast a Ranged Vote? It is one step at this point. Let us call it QRV: Quadratic Ranged Voting. 

Citizens ought to be given voice, a set "political capital" in our voting systems which is quadratically spent on ranged voting. It does seem to have some force to it which I cannot deny.

This would fill in the cracks too. In that "hit em where they ain't," I'd "vote where they ain't."

Okay, crazy idea: what if we tuned the amount of "Voice" you are given based upon your demonstration of competency. This may feel like eugenics and eumemics. So, let's just consider it hypothetically. 

We could voice to those who deserve it the most conceptually. The poor, the philosopher kings, the young, etc. Those whom are affected most by the laws, those who are most vulnerable, those in most need, those who are most exploited, etc.
