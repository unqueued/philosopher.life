title: 2018.01.18 -- Rust

`::` is an associated function (static method)

The `.expect("Foobar error message")` will crash the program and return the error message.

`cargo doc --open` produces the necessary documentation for your crate and exports to your browser (sadly, deluminate doesn't work with it)

A //match// expression is made up of //arms//. An arm consists of a pattern and the code that should be run if the value given to the beginning of the match expression fits that armâ€™s pattern.

Rust allows us to //shadow// the previous value of a variable with a new one; it enables variable name reuse.

The `_` is a catchall value.
