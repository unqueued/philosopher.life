title: 2017.11.10 - Prompted Introspection Log: Perfect Vacation

!! Describe the perfect vacation.

Genie, with my first wish, I ask for infinite wishes. 

Lady Melisandre, surely you mean something more specific. I can talk about what I think heaven would be like for me on Earth (honey, you're definitely in my vacation plans), but I don't think that's what you really mean to ask here. It is too obvious, too explosively impractical, and you will not be satisfied by my answer (and I dearly hope to satisfy you).

Perhaps I should extract principles from what makes my perfect vacation and attempt to make them practical, to find a way to apply them.

Hrmm...I don't even know what a practical vacation would look like. Even the practical ones look like genies to me, at the very least as ways of altering my life permanently.

This question is asking me what I really want? Is it what I really want //tout court// or given my context? Is it the ideal or the practically ideal? 

I am sorry, but I do not have an answer for you (not satisfied, eh?). Clearly, I need to adjust my expectations and hopes, to reframe what I want and how to make myself happy.
