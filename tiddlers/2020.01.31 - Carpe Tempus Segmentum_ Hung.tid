title: 2020.01.31 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Hung

* Woke at 11
** Dreams and then coughing up a storm.
* Fireman Time!
* Read
* Dialecture
* Offspring went on an expedition to figure out dinner by themselves.
* Hung things on walls.
** My son officially knows how to use that drill. They did the stud-finding, leveling, measuring, mid-point reasoning. GJ.
*** If I can teach him to always put my tools back, we'd be set.
* We finally have a place to put coats. 
* Paperwork for DMV
* Massaged my wife.
** She is feeling much tighter. 
*** I am worried now about her medication. We need to get her to the doctor, since she will run out. 
**** We have passed the most difficult transitions (though not as cleanly as I would have hoped). We can afford not to have the meds at this point, but it would be preferred.
** It's too cold to use our massage table. 
* SUV door wouldn't close. Fixed.
* Chats
* Accidentally walked in on my wife who was too tired to even walk...best sound in the world.
** Uh, AFK.
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Read+Write
* Tried sleeping, eventually it occurred. Past 3 at least.
