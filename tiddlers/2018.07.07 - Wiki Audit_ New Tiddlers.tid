title: 2018.07.07 - Wiki Audit: New Tiddlers

I've noticed that [[Self-Dialectic]] is PROFOUNDLY related to [[Wiki Audit]] and [[Conceiving About: The Inconceivable]]. I will need to think far more about that. I'm so glad to have a place to put my thoughts, to recognize this as a category of how I wish to reason, etc.

Also, I've been practicing just using the "+" button to start a "New Tiddler [X]" to just write it down and then do the naming a categorization after. There is a [[/b/]]ness to this practice that I like, and I'm glad I don't have to worry about making it fit until after I've spit it out. Usually, I have an idea where it's going, but I need to not pay the librarian's cost up front in order to have the ability to just spit it out...like this sentence.
