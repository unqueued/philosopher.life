Not exactly. Her biological male donor died. I walked and talked with her about it.
FRI 3:56 PM
How about you?

She just told me. We didnt do anything either. We've never really gotten into valentine's. Not in a way that were against it. I think bc our parents arent the type to go overboard for holidays, we arent either.

Today I'm cleaning the apartment. It's slightly chilly so it's a good day to open the windows. I'm listening to a podcast about cults while cleaning. Are you aware of the NXIVM mess at all?
FRI 4:08 PM
Only seen a bit of it.
FRI 4:10 PM
This is just a deep dive into all that mess. I'm obsessed with following the case bc I watched soooooo much smallville growing up and Chloe was my favorite!

Celebrities and cults make it delicious.
