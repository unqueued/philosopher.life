title: Diablo 2

!! About:

Diablo 2 is one my favorite games of all time. It is the quintessential skinnerbox. It has so much depth, so many little corners, and a beautiful grind. You build trophies for yourself the entire time. It is a min-max dreamworld. Even its progeny, D3, couldn't capture that lightning in the bottle for me. 

I currently have an install from the past year. It's a game I play when I want and can easily walk away from. I build bit by bit in it. It's fun to see my collection grow!

This is a directory to talk about whatever. I could write an entire wiki on D2, but I don't want to waste my time. Only some things are worth recording.
