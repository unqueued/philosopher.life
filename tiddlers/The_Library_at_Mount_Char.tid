title: The Library at Mount Char

I'm trying a new tactic out. I'm going to research a book before I read (and not just after). My verbal reasoning is low enough this might be worthwhile. I've never done it this way, so I'm going to try. Spoilers and losing objectivity is a problem, but in a way, I think I already have a profound lens through which I view everything. So, I am doing science here. I want to know if this is a good plan or not.

!! Chapter 1

Carolyn is a badass. She also sounds hot and psychopathic at the same time. I'm going to have mixed feelings about her. She attempts to not kill needlessly, of course. She doesn't know whether to love or hate //home//.

Pelapi: Librarian + Pupil

Twelve catalogues. Go forth, my disciples. Father is Zeus and all gods rolled into something. This shit is cold as fuck. I will pay close attention to the use and non-use of empathy in this story. 

Guile. What is Carolyn's guile? How does it relate to language? How are librarians, language, power, and reality related?

Why the fuck is Father giving up his powers, or at least teaching others to have them? What is this lineage? Their power is compartmentalized, and I don't know why. Is this a chaotic pitladder?

Why are they looking for Father? What does that even mean? And, who is Duke? What does it mean for father to not be in the future and not dead. Is he alive only in their minds? Is there a noumena to which he escapes?

It is very interesting to see how trust in their relationships are built, test, and violated.

!! Chapter 2

God damn, Carolyn is hot. Is her flirtation part of her superpower? What's her body language like? (I bet she's an incredible fuck). How many languages doesn't she speak? She isn't a master, so the author gets away with no having her speak language I known exist (and I'm including the Gödellian problems as well). To be the language God may ultimately require being the narrative God, which just is to say, she can transport herself into all Daseinic states/minds. She is everyone. Ah, I doubt the author can do this. This doesn't seem like the move most people would make.

I want a Makita drill.

Super powers are always a form of the Ring of Gyges, I remind you. With great power comes great responsibility.

Why does Carolyn not essentially have all the superpowers? 

I would love to know more about the noble guests. The ontology of this world is not easy for me to understand.

I still don't understand who Nobununga is.

!! Chapter 3

Ah, Carolyn doesn't understand Lisa's language. Author, explain yourself. No bullshit, please. Either she is a master or she isn't. 

The David-McGillicutty scene is outstanding. I laughed. I rarely laugh at anything now. What a strong scene.

I'm not sure I'm following this "force field" gate thing. 

Banished wanderers. Go into the desert. Zion is no longer your home. Your God has abandoned you.

Why can't they send regular humans into this place, past the force field?

I'm not sure I'm following these interludes.

Original Sin concept, ruh-roh, yogi.

OMG, OMG! Philosophical Zombies too!

Very weird interaction between Father and Carolyn at the burning of David. The telepathy, the language problem. I do not understand this.

David, second king, you rest on the 7th day. You do not love your god anymore.

!! Chapter 4

Erwin is easy to hate. I think this chapter sucked though. I'm not being sucked into the story. The author needs to start tying it together again.

!! Chapter 5

I don't understand the magic of the lions. This feels forced. This book started out really strong. I am not happy with these past two chapters. Visceral yes, but they don't motivate anything.

!! Chapter 6

How the fuck does she know the code to get in touch with the president?

Why are the gods interested in the lives of men? Finally, at least a chapter that makes sense. I laughed out loud, for realsies, twice in this chapter. It's kind of over the top, but enjoyable. Also, I am super fucking horny.

!! Chapter 7

More lions. This chapter actually sucked.

---

Alright, I'm done with doing chapters. This book stopped needing it.

I still don't understand the lions. We've spent a fuck ton of time on them, and I don't see why. They seem completely irrelevant to me so far. It's action with no meaning.

Love the bootstrapping of power storyline of Father. I would suggest that the author has perhaps inadvertently also demonstrated a similar chain of "mastery" among the orphans. Jennifer was the first to be master, just as Father likely first mastered medicine. David and war seem second, etc. 

What is "pure thought" and "reality virus"? Fascinating notions, I am sure.

WTF is on the bookshelf?

The species of crazy is odd. It sounds beautifully chaotic, evil, etc. 

As I suspected, Carolyn has the ability to learn the other skills qua her language virtuosity.

I adore revenge plots. I adore "power-up" Goku shit. I adore training for the final fight. Cleverness, stealth, and learning are hawt. I need to bang Carolyn tonight! Did she start this whole fucking thing!??

If time doesn't pass for David, he can't be a mind (unless he is transcendent).

"Not this time" ROFL!

"Architecture of Thought" - I adore these phrases, btw.

"The risk in working to be a dangerous person..."

Hobbesian notion of freedom, Liber, Library. It's a library of power.

Ineffability of Father

Why does Father cause that much pain?

“I think perhaps God is angry.”

"The vocabulary of such a creature would be different from what I am used to, different from what I know."

Why aren't we being told about Carolyn relationship/choice of Steve? Make it obvious please. There is enormous pain and power in this story. Resolve it.

She is remaking Michael.

Carolyn-God is impersonal. Steve's argument so far is something to behold.

<<<
Normal men, she understood for the first time, burn surprisingly fast. In less than a minute, he was dead. Therein, perhaps, we find God’s mercy. Beyond that, the outer darkness.
<<<

It's a very moving scene. Why does Carolyn not see it in advance?

"adopt a stance of compassion” - Why does she not ultimately understand what it means? How can you be a language master but not understand it?

<<<
“Sure. Why not? I’ve been in a teaching mood lately.” He poked the meat with a carved wooden fork. “The secret is to start with a hot fire, as hot as you can make. Such a fire will burn away impurities, you see. Plus, there’s a ceremonial aspect to it. Fire gives a person something to focus on.” He rapped the bull with his knuckles, grinning. “So, yeah. Fire. That’s the first step.”
<<<

That is a powerful line for a woman who was burned alive.

The eternal suffering of his own son. It's truly poetic.

<<<
I must send you into exile, that you may be the coal of her heart. No real thing can be so perfect as memory, and she will need a perfect thing if she is to survive. She will warm herself on the memory of you when there is nothing else, and be sustained.
<<<

You know, when I was a child, my Sunday school teacher asked me who I thought was most like Jesus. I answered, "My dad." It is a memory that haunts both of us. 

I do not understand why it had to be this way. Father comes back, he has control of time itself. What lesson was there to really learn? I don't get it.

<<<
“It’s the idea that however deeply you understand the universe, however many mysteries you solve, there will always be another, deeper mystery behind it.”
<<<

Gödel. Yes. 

<<<
“I didn’t know, Carolyn. I had faith in you.” Father’s eyes twinkled. “You should probably start getting used to that.”
<<<

Holy fuck. I did not see that coming! It was so obvious, and wonderful, and sad.

I've never seen a book mortalize God as effectively as this one.

Excellent book.

Epilogue seems irrelevant.
