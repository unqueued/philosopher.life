One of the foundational reasons I believe I have freewill is my experience of it. I have seen some of the science attacking freewill as epiphenomenal, ofc. We also face some similar problematics in the external world and hard problem of consciousness of other minds, particularly when it can be expanded into OOO relativized and infinite perspectives (of which Spinoza and Hegel could or may go [I simply cannot offer a clean interpretation]). Once we exit epistemic standards of certainty, limiting skepticism to something far more pragmatic, I'm able to attempt to reasonably guess (it's actually my plight).
