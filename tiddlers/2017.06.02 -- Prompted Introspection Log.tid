title: 2017.06.02 -- Prompted Introspection Log

!! Today, I'm going to write about the picture below.

This is a fascinating existential picture to me. I'm not sure how to interpret it. The plateau on top is flat and empty. Is that a good thing or not? The staircases look like  a journey, some being easier than others, some more dangerous, etc. Is it a good thing to be on top? 

The difference between the two landscapes is stark. The vastness of the top and the escherness of bottom is not lost on me. It actually makes me anxious. One looks difficult because it literally requires climbing (whether up or down), but at least your are making progress (in some vertical direction). The other looks difficult because it is monotonous and without progression. Which should you fear the most?

Which direction is this person going? Have they crossed the flat desert plateau to descend, or have they ascended to see what's finally on top?

This is a very ambitious and ambiguous painting. My gut says they made the climb,  they've looked into the endless plateau, and they now experience dread. Hello, human. You've only climbed the first existential step. The pursuit of meaning starts in the desert, but it doesn't end there (I hope).
