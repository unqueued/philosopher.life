<<<
Faith is our plight. This is my metamodern faith interpretation of speculative realism. I have always found it serendipitous that "Good" and "God" are but one letter apart.
<<<

"Good" is the idea of an all-powerful, all-loving and all-knowing creator. God has created us and given us life and purpose. The idea of goodness, then, is a product of a certain type of cognitive dissonance. In this case, the cognitive dissonance is an attempt to reconcile two very different types of experiences — that of an existing reality with that of an abstract, universal ideal. When this dissonance is overcome with some type of religious experience, the person believes he is in fact experiencing that ideal reality. That is, he is in fact seeing reality as it truly is. The result is the

but its actualization is not. It is the objective meaning that is real. And if objective meaning is real, then it is real not because of its realizability (realizability does not entail objectivity), but because it is real, not because it is in fact a particular, but because it is objectively a certain, not because it is a particular, but because it is a certain meaning, i.e., an objective reality, a fact about the world.

The realist, on this conception, is the person who believes that this objective reality of meaning is real in a more than merely natural, immediate, and immediate way, as it were, in the way that the physical world is real, and that therefore the objective reality of meaning is not a mere "transcend

Spinoza bit the necessity bullet, but he flattened the world into unity. It seems to me that metaphysics is the infinigressing dialectic of ⊥ and ⊤. It is contradictory turtles all the way down.
<<<

There is no room for any other way of looking at the world. In my opinion, any metaphysical system is an "eclecticism" of sorts. It is an attempt to reconcile all conceivable ideas. In order to do that, there needs to be something that will accommodate all possible metaphysical systems. There can never be one theory that encompasses all of existence, so there is a need to make a compromise. Some such compromise is called "meta-metaphysics" or "meta-religion."
A quick note about this distinction between "metaphysics" and "religion": it may be a very subtle distinction,

In our incompleteness, we can never fully simulate that which is larger in bit-size than the simulator. We can only talk about fallible reductions of the whole; we never have access to thing in itself, especially not the thing of total reality itself. We are but a part of that whole.
<<<

But the part which is not the part of reality, and can therefore be considered "nothing" or "nothingness", has to be somehow represented. In the same way, our experience of reality, which is nothing but a "representation" of this reality (in which we can somehow know what we are seeing or hearing or tasting), is a representation of the part of reality which is not the part of reality. This part, however, is not what the part of reality is in itself. In other words, we are only a part of the whole, and therefore do not know what this "part" in reality is.

It seems to me that Gödel's ontological argument and incompleteness arguments are deeply intertwined. It appears that the modal collapse flattens reality such that there is nothing which isn't The Good, nothing to compare itself to in dialectic, and thus the ontological argument results in a contradiction.
<<<

But the same reasoning can also be used to establish the incompleteness argument against the existence of any objects. And if the truth-maker is something which does not exist then there is nothing which could be the truth-maker. For if it did exist it would have to be a contradiction.

The reason I think this is correct is that I'm in agreement with the modal collapse argument's conclusion. I've made the above observation because I think there's a good chance that I'm wrong. I'm thinking of things which are logically possible but which, in fact, do not exist. In other words I am imagining things that

something must be contingent in order for The Good to unflatten the world, but if The Good obtains then there are no contingent truths, which means there is no The Good.
<<<

If God is the ultimate source of all contingent truths, it is hard to see how he could have produced the best of his contingent truths, or even any contingent truths at all. If it is hard to explain how a divine being could do the things he did in the world, it's even harder to see how he can do them. But then, the question becomes whether God does them at all, and if so, what is his good. There are many kinds of good, but only some of them can be described as contingently true. In fact, if you ask many Christians these days if they believe in God,

There is no meaning that matters if there is meaning that matters. But, if there is no meaning that matters, why don't we get to help ourself to the claim that meaning matters?
<<<

And if meaning matters, why don't we get to see the universe as a whole as a being with purpose?

The universe and life are the only things we have a reason to trust because of the claim that it matters. If that is not true, what is? What reason do we have to trust it? How do we know that?

We don't have reasons, but we do have experience. And we do have reason to trust our experience. And what are the consequences of trusting that our experience has any validity?

Our experience has not been subjected to skeptical scrutiny. It has not had the kind of scrutiny
