My daughter was coming out of her room. And I scared her by yell "what are you doiNG" with a smirk on my face she knew I was just messing around. But still she was startled and scared. She immediately responded with a full right hand draw and punch to my bicep.

I don't know that you would appriciate the violence. But reacting to fear with anger is a normal emotional response. And for her own safety I hope she continues that emotional response.
