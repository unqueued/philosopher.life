title: 2018.08.30 -- Deep Reading: The Hobbit

There is more whimsy and magic to this story for me than LOTR. It's far less an epic, and that's on purpose I assume. I love the worlds it has given birth to.

This story is linear and fairly single-threaded, unlike LOTR, and that may be part of why I've always had an easier time "being there" in the virtual world created generated by this book. In a way, this book is more enticing, effortless, and escapist than the rest of the world is spawns. Perhaps that's because I'm borderline illiterate.

When the settle into the mountain, I feel like I'm building a pillow fort as a kid.

Smaug is a character I still do not understand these many years later.

I do not understand Tolkien's reactionary position.

Kant's jewel is shining forth, bitches.

The ex machinas have got to stop. I can't believe Tolkien had the balls to talk about Lewis' style. 

I think we're supposed to be pleased and then converted to love Thorin. When a president dies, same bullshit.

I do appreciate how queerness is celebrated in this book. 

The prophesy aspects always meant a lot to me as a Christian.
