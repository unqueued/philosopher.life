title: 2018.05.16 - Polymath Craftsman: Rained Out

I got there. It was raining. We sat. Colton eventually came out in the rain to say he was making a phone call. We sat. He came back and told us to go home. He said we probably won't work tomorrow either, to text him, and we'll see if there is work on Monday. We'll see what he does.

Colton is truly a piece of shit. His lack of organization is half ignorance and half selfish malice (and the two are likely intertwined).
