title: 2020.02.18 - TDL: Groceries

* Grocery shopping
* Offspring's rooms
* Need to see audiobooks actually used on their phones.
** There is reading being done. I hope we can keep the ball rolling.
* Son:
** Bikes, shelves, sound for his device.
* Daughter:
** Laptop, Desktop, RSS.
* I'd like to the dining area organized, thoroughly, head to toe.
* I'm liking this pattern of reading her wiki and responding to it in person after she gets home.
* I'd like to see tooling area cleaned up, and I'd like to see the kintsukuroi brought back up.
** Maybe it would be best to just wait for an actual table here. =/
* Enjoy your walking path. 
** That part is starting to feel normal too.
* I'd like to see you continue to reason about how to bring the familiar routine back into my wife's life carefully. 
** This is a long-term position. She will be crafting her own job description literally and less obviously. We should be thoughtful about what's right. Too much we don't see or understand at the moment.
* You should probably hold off on bliss for the day. 
** Modafinil purchase though. See what your brother wants. Last noots weren't used, I believe.
