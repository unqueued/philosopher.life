Hello, nomad. Thank you for responding. I reached out to you on a whim because I was moved by your words and noticed you've popped up more than once in the //Confirm My Bias// section of my [[Link Log]].

* [[2018.08.22 -- Link Log: Unending]]
* [[2018.08.29 -- Link Log: Keep Your Browser Clean, Sir]]

After looking into [[your clearnet identity|Matt McManus]], I am pleasantly surprised you responded. You are clearly a busy man. [[Hope]]fully, you will find a relationship with me to be worth the opportunity costs.

<<<
Thanks! Your page looks cool and I look forward to reading more.
<<<

I'm glad you find it aesthetically pleasing. This wiki is much larger than you might initially suspect.<<ref "w">> I suggest starting with [[Find The Others]], {[[Help]]}, and {[[Contact]]}.

<<<
 What are you interested in?
<<<

I'm not sure if you meant interest in your work or mine. The good news is that we share quite a bit in common, imho. To your work, I'm interested in your Rawlsianism, your ability to critically appreciate the postmodern problematic, and the motivation of your method. I'm going to need some time to consume and digest your work. I had considered waiting to contact you until I had done so, but I also don't want to make you wait.

As to my own interests, I try to make that clear in my wiki. I'm interested in philosophy, computer science, theology, and becoming an objectively morally virtuous agent in my context. 20 minutes of your time reading the top-level directories in [[Root]] will likely give you a reasonable approximation of my identity.

To pigeon-hole myself in a paragraph: I'm a (Straussianly charitable) Rawlsian who can't accept the subjectivist constructivism of the Neo-Kantians.<<ref "s">> I think of myself as a transcendental realist fighting against the postmodern memeplex. I'd call myself a Platonist aiming to cryptographically implement [[The Original Position]]. I believe we are in a race to defuse a dark-triadic bomb ticking inside the human species, the enemy of Reason Itself. The Crisis of Capitalism grows, and it's obvious to me that extreme collective measures must be taken to counteract the rapid enslavement and eventual extinction of our species (and others).<<ref "b">>

So, I'm putting you on the spot here, what's your self-description?<<ref "c">>

Alright, so I don't want to scare you off in the desert here. You may already think I'm a madman (perhaps a fair assessment). Hopefully you'll give me a couple looks before you throw me away. I'll be working my way through your work in [[T42T]]. I'm radically transparent with this wiki, so I'll be drafting my digestion of your work out in the open; you can observe my progress if you are interested.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
