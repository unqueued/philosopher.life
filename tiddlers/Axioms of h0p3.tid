!! About:

//My axioms are the principles to which I bind myself. Here I commit ideas to myself and myself to those ideas. A man's gotta have a code. Every philosopher needs a "Bob" turtle of the mystical "turtles all the way down" - the answer to the paradoxically true and real [[infinigress]]es. I dedicate this page to the heroes I worship: Anselm, Aristotle, Boëthius, Diogenes, Gödel, Hegel, Heidegger, Huxley, Jesus, Kant, Kierkegaard, Leibniz, Marx, Montaigne, Plato, Russell, Socrates, Strauss, & Wittgenstein. Faith is our philosophical plight. Assume wisely, sir!//

<<<
It is easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.

-- Alfred Adler
<<<

<<<
It is possible to [try to] believe in something and still fail to live up to it.

-- Dr. James Evan Wilson, M.D., //House//
<<<

<<<
The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the...unconscious expedient of discouraging [further epistemic justification]. 

-- Richard Dawkins

In blind paradox, even these words serve as the axioms of [[h0p3]]. I write this directory likely as some kind of self-contradictory dialectic which I can never fully understand.<<ref "p">> What is this?<<ref "r">> Where do my axioms begin? Who am I really? How ought I reason? Perhaps this is the metalogic or metalanguage of my axiomatic work. You gotta start somewhere, homie.

If {[[About]]} is my evolving verbal narrative, I [[hope]] this [[Root]]ed directory generates the quantitative narrative. Here I engage in the first and final task of autonomy. I must find those axioms which ought to be most immutable and central to my identity. I hope to find faith in those axioms which demonstrate themselves to be justified in requiring the absurdly necessary leap of faith into philosophical suicide.<<ref "lf">> The possibility of my reason rests upon faith, and I desperately hope to maximize the reason of my faith. I seek the coherent foundation of transcendental realism: [[The Good]]. 

This directory explains the core postulates of who I hope to be, and perhaps to some extent, who I am. Here I develop, interpret, and apply my first principles using both the epistemic internalist and externalist methodologies. Even the most humble are forced to be bold in this realm. Faith is our plight, and hence, the dialectical relationship between faithful reason and reasonable faith will always be our vocation as [[fff]] persons. I need a priori datum but also feedback-looped a posteriori corrections and dictations. I engage in solipsistic doubt and epistemic risk-management in speculatively exploring and discovering the brute facts, primitive notions, and [[infinigress]]ing principles of sufficient reason and realism down to the limits of the intelligibility of the epistemic+ontic unmoved mover(s).

There are axioms we do not choose, innate ideas hard-coded into our brains, and thus the beginnings of our minds (think spacetime category neurons). There are axioms that we "choose" which arise from our empirical conditions and innate ideas. I don't care if I have freewill here; it will always be crucial to my identity to have the best axioms I can have. If I have to beg the question of my freedom to engage in this process, if I must delude myself into it, then I should. It's worth it. Clearly, I already have some axioms. I believe there are contingent parts of my [[4DID]].

You walk on hallowed ground, friend. Choosing one's axioms ain't easy. You can only do the best you can with what you've got. This is a messy, painful, and extremely risky process. Yet, this is the sanest of activities. I must [[seize the timeslice|Carpe Tempus Segmentum Logs]] of my life, and ultimately this is quite necessary for resolving dynamic inconsistencies in my identity.

Here I engage in fundamental [[philosophy|Philosophy]]. I nakedly pursue and flesh out the content of question-begging wisdom while magnanimously drinking my koolaid.<<ref "ka">> This is the [[antipleonasmic]] [[Diamonized|Diamonds]] [[Redpilled|Redpills]] gemchild of {[[About]]}. I'm going to be ballsy and go balls out; here I lay down my tentpegs with manly //eros//.<<ref "er">>

Beware, you mindless non-cognitivists, principled anti-codificationists, foundationless coherentists, subjective constructivists, moral anti-realists, truth relativists, conveniently selfish consequentialists, crusaders of the Rightist Rand-Locke memeplex + mutations, and postmodernists lacking the integrity to engage in reconstruction:<<ref "fl">> I'm here to ''boldly'' codify my identity and metanarratives. My goal is to commit myself to, be constituted by, and habitually unify my persistent identity around the best possible axioms available to me. 

I aim to forcefully articulate a formal expression of the root of my identity. This is meant to be the distilled epistemic foundation embedded at the core of my identity. I [[h0p3]] to build the best life worth living available to me. 

I need axioms which produce my persistent integrity [[irwartfrr]]. I hope to coherently weave myself around these self-legislated commandments. I seek both those maxims universalizable in all possible contexts (big kahunas) but also the contextualist's universalizable maxims which are particularized down to the infinitesimal. Ultimately, however, I aim for the truest of the unconditional truths which require no justification other than being integral to the coherence of the very notion of rationality itself.<<ref "qb">> 

I have faith in reality. I cannot be certain; thus I seek an evolving, incrementally bootstrapped progression in my confidence levels in the axioms generated by my moral heuristics. I suppose this is a naive Bayesian approach to existential gambling. I have to take the risk of being wrong here; it's the only way I can have a chance at being right.

Call it //mere// faith if you must; sometimes [[hope|Hope]] is all we have. I'm doing my best to be a virtuous agent-human-person-philosopher in my context, but my construction will inevitably be imperfect (perhaps wildly so). I play with fire here, and I will burn myself. Pains are sometimes necessary prices of progress. I take up new axioms with enough faith to test them. Sometimes testing and appreciating the consequences of my axioms takes me years. As a finite being, I have to efficiently choose axioms, and of course there must be axioms for heuristically selecting and culling axioms, perhaps to [[infinigress]]. I must continually work on improving my axioms: my computational models of myself and the world.

I do not know the extent to which I choose my axioms or how it works: ab initio problems abound. I hope to forgive myself for my self-synthesizing qua self-analyzing (and vv.) hermeneutic circles/spirals. Consider the question of [sufficiently meaningful freedom necessary for a meaningful life] begged. I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't already assume it were real and meaningful. I'm engaged in transcendental reasoning and empirical existential investigations in this practice. I must find the way between faithful doubt and doubtful faith.

!! Principles:

* Be maximally Straussian in your philosophical point of view.
* Attempt to lexically order your axioms in computational priority and resolve conflicts between them.
* Fight and submit to absurdity in the least absurd fashion you can.

* Zeroth: [[h0p3]]/[[Hope]], seed anchor of faith & self-legislator

* To dream of more dreams for this page.
** [[Question Everything]]. Sack it up. Have the integrity. Be a good person. Be a philosopher.

* Crazy Candidates:
*# Nothing is free except randomness and meaninglessness. [There is a sufficient reason for everything, including, as a matter of faith, whatever skeptical exceptions you might levy against this. Randomness cannot be a physical attribute because physics, by definition, makes sense. It can appear pseudo-random, but true randomness is meaningless and cannot be physical. Being physical is a property of something, and you can't have an object with property that lacks meaning. Properties are meanings.] <--Possible result. Meaning and being problematic.
*# Information wants to be free. Is this also a matter of entropy?
*# Seek to be a better person rather than a good human.
*#* Pursue freedom and happiness only insofar as its makes you a better person.
