title: Axioms of h0p3

!! About:

//My axioms are the principles to which I bind myself. Here I commit ideas to myself and myself to those ideas. A man's gotta have a code.//

<<<
It is easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.

â€• Alfred Adler

Here I engage in fundamental [[philosophy|Philosophy]]. I nakedly pursue and flesh out the content of question-begging wisdom while magnanimously drinking my koolaid.<<ref "ka">> This is the [[Diamonized|Diamonds]] [[Redpilled|Redpills]] gemchild of my [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]], {[[Principles]]}, and {[[About]]}. I'm going to be ballsy and go balls out; here I lay down my tentpegs with manly //eros//.<<ref "er">>

Beware you mindless non-cognitivists, principled anti-codificationists, foundationless coherentists and constructivists, moral anti-realists, truth relativists, conveniently selfish consequentialists, crusaders of the Rightist Rand-Locke memeplex + mutations, and postmodernists lacking the integrity to engage in reconstruction:<<ref "fl">> I'm here to ''boldly'' codify my identity, metanarratives, and normativity itself. My goal is to commit myself to, be constituted by, and habitually unify my persistent identity around my axioms.

I aim to articulate a formal expression of the root of my identity. This is meant to be the distilled epistemic foundation embedded at the core of my identity. I [[h0p3]] to build the best life worth living available to me.

I seek both those maxims universalizable in all possible contexts (big kahunas) but also the contextualist's universalizable maxims which are particularized down to the infinitesimal. I aim for the truest of the unconditional truths which require no justification other than being integral to the coherence of the very notion of rationality itself.<<ref "qb">> I need axioms which produce my persistent integrity [[irwartfrr]]. I hope to coherently weave myself around these self-legislated commandments.

I cannot always be certain, thus I seek an evolving, incrementally bootstrapped progression in my confidence levels in the axioms generated by my moral heuristics. I suppose this is a naive Bayesian approach.

Call it faith if you must; sometimes that is all we have. I'm doing my best to be a virtuous agent, but my construction will inevitably be imperfect (perhaps wildly so). I play with fire here, and I will inevitably burn myself. Pain is the prices of progress. I take up new axioms with enough faith to test them. Sometimes testing and appreciate the consequences of my axioms takes years. As a finite being, I have to efficiently choose axioms, and of course, there must axioms for heuristically selecting and culling axioms, perhaps to [[infinigress]].

I [[h0p3]] to be a man of deep principle.

!! Principles:

* See where you can derive surd and clean it up.
* Develop theorems from maxioms
* Engage in the science of the reflective equilibriumized categorical imperative.
* Attempt to lexically order your axioms, but do not be afraid to resolve conflicts between them.
* I hope for this directory to become so mighty it replaces the quantitative root of this wiki: {[[Principles]]}.

** [[Reality is darker than you are willing to recognize, but it could be brighter than what you can imagine.]]
** [[An Eye for Two Eyes]]

* Crazy Candidates:
*# Nothing is free except randomness and meaninglessness. [There is a sufficient reason for everything, including, as a matter of faith, whatever skeptical exceptions you might levy against this. Randomness cannot be a physical attribute because physics, by definition, makes sense. It can appear pseudo-random, but true randomness is meaningless and cannot be physical. Being physical is a property of something, and you can't have an object with property that lacks meaning. Properties are meanings.] <--Possible result. Meaning and being problematic.
*# Information wants to be free. Is this also a matter of entropy?
*# Seek to be a better person rather than a good human.
*#* Pursue freedom and happiness only insofar as its makes you a better person.
