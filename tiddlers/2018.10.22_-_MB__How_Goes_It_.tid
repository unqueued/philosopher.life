```
How goes it?
MON 4:34 PM
It goes. I've had a bit of a cold/something that I'm getting over. The minute the temp dips below 70 my nose revolts, lol. It's gotten chilly here! 

So I can only imagine its FREEZING there! How are things with yall?
MON 4:53 PM
Yeah, it's getting nipply. Finally feels like fall.
MON 4:54 PM
You recovering decently?
MON 4:55 PM
We're doing well. Lots of reading and writing.
MON 4:55 PM
I'm beginning the hunt for a job again.
MON 4:55 PM
I am. I've been chugging Tamiflu just in case and I'm feeling like it's not going to turn into anything too bad. 

How goes the job hunt?
MON 5:07 PM
It's, like, my favorite thing to do, dontchaknow? =)
MON 5:08 PM
Hahaha, are you looking for something in welding/electrcianing?
MON 5:12 PM
I would take a job that paid well doing it and was safe.
MON 5:13 PM
Those aren't common.
MON 5:13 PM
I will be looking for those jobs as well.
MON 5:14 PM
I also think I wouldn't mind just going the desk job route.
MON 5:14 PM
Now that I'm so committed to my wiki as my magnum opus (been 2 years of relentless work), I know I'd be able to make good use of the time on a desk.
MON 5:14 PM
I think a desk job would be great. What kinds of places have you applied to (if any yet). If not, what kinds of places are you interested in?
MON 5:16 PM
Mostly getting started now. Gonna spam. I applied for a factchecker position with wikitribune (the guy who made wikipedia is starting what amounts to a newspaper).
MON 5:17 PM
But, I don't think I'll be landing a job I care about.
MON 5:17 PM
That's okay.
MON 5:17 PM
How's Adam doing?
MON 5:28 PM
And your brother?
MON 5:28 PM
I hope you get the fact checker job. That sounds like it would be interesting and would change enough to keep from getting stale. 

Adam is good. He's been massively busy with work, which is a good thing. Hes got a lot of projects finally starting to happen that hes been working toward for a while. 

Matthew is really busy with school. Hes working on two masters right now so we rarely talk to him. That's usually better with him. When he calls a lot it means hes not happy. So silence is good, lol.
MON 6:04 PM
Lol
MON 6:04 PM
I always find your relationship with Matthew interesting.
MON 6:13 PM
I'm glad he's doing well.
MON 6:13 PM
What projects of Adam's do you like the most?
MON 6:14 PM
And, have you been workin' on any projects as of late?
MON 6:14 PM
(I know you are still recovering before you head back to the trenches)
MON 6:14 PM
Adam's doing a podcast with a friend of his. They are going to focus on different musical topics. Their first "series" is them documenting a research project they're doing on a musician named Jabbo Smith. Since my family was in radio and I love the art of research this project is the most fun to talk about. 

I haven't been really working on anything. I repainted a couple of pieces of furniture, but that was mostly out of necessity rather than a fun project, lol.
