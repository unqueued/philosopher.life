title: 2019.02.11 - Afterschool Teaching: All By My SEEEEEELF

Whitney is out today. She's sick. It's all me so far. Mitchell took the 5th, and I took the others. I'm allowing them to use the chromebooks to do their work (frowned upon by all the other adults I've met). I'm going to have some percentage of students who just aren't going to try, but I think most of my students are making progress in the single hour of work I require them to do. 

Many of the kids desperately want to go outside or to the gym. I think I'm far more valuable to them as a teacher, if they wanted to learn. Setting aside what I think they ought to do (take me up on my offer), I feel bad they can't play. There's not much I can do about it.

I played more chess with a bunch of boys. Awesome. I was surprised by who wanted to play today as well. I have little time to type with the number of kids talking to me. Cool. I can do that.

I continue to preach the gospel of reading, focusing, doing their best, searching for the truth, and shedding what doesn't matter. I'm failing, as usual. It's okay. I'm a failure at these things too, lol.

Another sports game as fundraiser.

Matt did my paperwork for me...so he could be in the office rather than with the kids. Look kid, I get it. 

My lone friend talks to me as he cleans. Today he told me what he likes to do in his spare time: ghost hunting. I get it, and I don't. It was an interesting conversation which I approached as openly as possible. It obviously is something painful for him to tell others. I don't mean to be painful to him, and I am not convinced I will be of use to him here (some people have it, and others don't).
