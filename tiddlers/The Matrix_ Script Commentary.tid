title: The Matrix: Script Commentary

//I'm engaged in reasoning about the immediate phenonmenology of my experience with [[The Matrix]]. This is obviously messy and perhaps absurd to most. I'm sorry.//

```
                         THE MATRIX

                             by

                  Larry and Andy Wachowski

                        June 3, 1997

```

I adore the intro. Even the WB bullshit. This aesthetic has defined cyberpunk for me. As a 1985er, this movie was insane to me. There are few movies that I am ultimately glad I saw them in the theatre, and this is one.

```
FADE IN:

ON COMPUTER SCREEN

so close it has no boundaries.
```

No boundaries is correct. This is the initial computationalist ontology and epistemology here. We are drawn back to square one on the commandline, engaged in some kind of Cartesian method of doubt.

```
A blinking cursor pulses in the electronic darkness like a
heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath the
derma of black-neon glass.
```

It's no accident that my wiki has much of [[The Matrix]] aesthetic.

```
A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were
making the call.  The cursor continues to throb,
relentlessly patient, until --
```

Ah, you immediately have a feeling that there is something outside that cursor/screen. You are pulled between different worlds, or is it really just one? The question of reality, of what we must bracket, of what it means to attend to representation, is screaming at you.

```

                         MAN (V.O.)
          Yeah?
```

In being Straussian here, I wonder by Cypher is the first to speak in the film. It's interesting that he's asking for the truth here (at least in a sense).



```
Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing
faster than we can read:  "Call trans opt:  received.
2-19-96 13:24:18  REC:Log>."
```

1984 Big Brother. The paranoia slaps you in the face. When you are uncertain, you must ask where to begin trusting trust. How far down the rabbithole are you going to go?



```
                         WOMAN (V.O.)
          Is everything in place?
```

This is a curious question. It reminds me of //The Statesman//, and asking about the precise of the measure of the mean, of the fitting, etc. There is a dialectic here it seems. This question, taken to its broadest meaning, is asking about whether or not reality matches a given standard. 


```
The man is silent.  On screen:  "Trace program:  running."
```


Foreshadowing. Lacking an answer, or failing to provide an immediate one. Are things as they appear? Foreboding danger of the all powerful, the inescapable demon machine.


```
We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on a
third line.  The man's name is Cypher.  The woman,
Trinity.
```

We are the sublators of the dialectic, listening to both sides, either taking one of their points of view or our own. Inescapably, we must take our own. It is our Daseinic plight.

```
                         TRINITY (WOMAN) (V.O.)
          I said, is everything in place?
```

Repetition should never, ever, ever be ignored. 

We don't know their names yet in the film, but I think we should point out that the dialectic occurs between that mystical contradictory meaning in the name "Trinity" (a [[Diamond]]ic construction or model, imho) and that untrusting, covered name "Cypher."

```
                         CYPHER (MAN) (V.O.)
          You weren't supposed to relieve me.
```

What a curious claim. Relief is the about being saved from pain. What is the standard which defines the "ought not" in this claim? Presumably, it is a mere social convention which is implied here; that does appear to be a simulacrum.

```
The entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers.
Shimmering like green-electric rivers, they rush at a 10-
digit phone number in the top corner.
```

This is a brute-force attack. It is the inevitable computation.

```
                         TRINITY (V.O.)
          I know but I felt like taking a
          shift.
```

Why? Is there a good reason in Cypher's eyes? It is unclear if Trinity fully understands it herself.

Of course, this feels like a lie. It's a kind of social nicety, a kind of confabulated reason one rationalizes off the top of their head to make your story fit their story.

```
The area code is identified.  The first three numbers
suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.
```

This is a classic kind of device in countdowns, hacker movies, etc. One thing I like about the CLI notion here is how it attempts to define and model "where" or "who" in symbolic representation which is somehow both accurate and yet overly reduced. It's super salient information, how one might think about it, and yet it's not all the information we might consider necessary. This information is simply instrumental, a model/process which has a telos. What is that telos? How do we know it? Why should we agree to it?

I adore the computational explanation of reality, and it forces us to see that somehow there are limits to the computation of reality and mind. 

```
                         CYPHER (V.O.)
          You like him, don't you?  You like
          watching him?
```

Watching what? We perceive representations. This observing issue is from the beginning. They are observing Neo, and their conversation is being observed by whatever is running in the CLI (presumably, the computer which controls The Matrix).

Cypher appears to guess the truth. The envy (and perhaps jealously) in this jest is no accident. He's kind of asking, "why should you care about him?"

```
We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each
digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like the
wheels of a slot machine.

                         TRINITY (V.O.)
          Don't be ridiculous.
```

She has to hide it.

```
                         CYPHER (V.O.)
          We're going to kill him.  Do you
          understand that?  He's going to die
          just like the others.
```

Cypher keeps going for the throat. He's asking, "what is real mercy then?" There's an odd compassion here to allowing people to live in the Cave. I'm not kind enough to Cypher here.

```
                         TRINITY (V.O.)
          Morpheus believes he is the One.
```

Plato believes he is the means to The Good.

```
Only two thin digits left.
```

Time is short. You only have so long to answer these philosophical questions. What you dread is coming for you, whether you realize it or not. It's time to take risks, to take up faith, etc.

```
                         CYPHER (V.O.)
          Do you?
```
The problem of faith in others minds, their models of the world, in who they really are. Again, we have a social conventions issue showing up, but Cypher appears legit interested in fleshing it out with her.

```
                         TRINITY (V.O.)
          I... it doesn't matter what I
          believe.
```

Why not? Isn't that the fucking point? And, yet, that is her point too. Somehow, the truth is just outside us. Faith is claiming that what is true is independent of us, that we can't have complete access to it or its justification. In a way, what we believe doesn't matter to us in faith; the foundational justification for our faith doesn't matter to us by definition (even if coherentist justification does).

```
                         CYPHER (V.O.)
          You don't, do you?

                         TRINITY (V.O.)
          If you have something to say, I
          suggest you say it to Morpheus.

                         CYPHER (V.O.)
          I intend to, believe me.  Someone
          has to.
```

I don't understand this interaction. Cypher looking for someone who doubts Morpheus. We never ultimately fight the reason that Cypher is even on this ship in the first place; perhaps he felt forced. It may be a loose end of the story, or maybe it says something important. 

It appears to be more than Doubting Thomas.

Cypher doesn't seem to directly voice his concern to Morpheus in this story. Instead, he takes matters into his own hands. He uses his knowledge for perhaps more selfish reasons than is implied here. 

```
The final NUMBER POPS into place --

                         TRINITY (V.O.)
          Did you hear that?

                         CYPHER (V.O.)
          Hear what?

On screen:  "Trace complete. Call origin:  #312-555-0690."
```

How do they hear this? We're supposed to magically just go with it, but I have questions about it. Of course, I'd like to know who is in charge of this initial CLI.

```
                         TRINITY (V.O.)
          Are you sure this line is clean?

                         CYPHER (V.O.)
          Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
```

Lol, the certainty embedded in that lie. Cypher has faith in something, clearly.

The paranoia is excellent, but the particular words shine to me. "Line"-drawing not just for communicating but for any representative model that corresponds to the world. Cleanliness, of course, has traditional historical religious meanings.

```
We MOVE, STILL CLOSING, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green
NUMBERS GROWING into an ominous ROAR.
```

What is the reality outside any conceivable language? Those are Wittgenstein's roars.

```
                         TRINITY (V.O.)
          I better go.
```

Given what justification? Her standard of the good based upon the model of reality she has assumed. She doesn't trust something.

```
She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the
nether world of the computer screen.

Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
ourselves in --

INT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT
```

Gorgeous.

```
The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across
the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it
spooled soot up the walls and ceiling, leaving patterns of
permanent shadow.

We FOLLOW four armed POLICE OFFICERS using flashlights as
they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves on
either side of Room 303.

The biggest of them violently kicks in the door --

The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before
them.

                         BIG COP
          Police!  Freeze!
```

Dumb cop noir thing going on. The coercive CLI force influences events immediately.

```
The room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a fold-
up table and chair with a phone, a modem, and a Powerbook
computer.  The only light in the room is the glow of the
computer.
```

Nearly empty rooms are ominous, they are devoid of meaning, and it forces us to fill in the gaps, to find ways to tell ourselves stories with these negative spaces.

```
Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is
TRINITY; a woman in black leather.

                         BIG COP
          Hands behind your head!  Now!  Do
          it!

She slowly puts her hands behind her head.
```

She's processing what's happening. How does she not immediately realize Cypher is connected to this? What blinds her?

```
EXT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the
police cruisers.

AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car.
```

Degrees of authority. They stand out as soulless looking creatures. They are supposed to appear dehumanized in a way. Agency, of course, is a fundamental topic in philosophy. 

```
They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  They
are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones
in one ear, the cord coiling back into their shirt
collars.
```

Sunglasses at night is very odd. It's a sign of perceptual superpowers to somehow not be mostly blinded (the most symbolic of afflictions) in this case.

```
                         AGENT SMITH
          Lieutenant?

                         LIEUTENANT
          Oh shit.

                         AGENT SMITH
          Lieutenant, you were given specific
          orders --

                         LIEUTENANT
          I'm just doing my job.  You gimme
          that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can
          cram it up your ass.

                         AGENT SMITH
          The orders were for your
          protection.

The Lieutenant laughs.

                         LIEUTENANT
          I think we can handle one little
          girl.
```

Clearly gender/sex roles and considerations. Power dynamics at work in multiple ways here. The lieutenant is clearly blind of what's really going on in the situation. Vision is not what it appears to be.

```
Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
hotel.
```

Nods are interesting symbols. It's a "I know" even when we really don't. It's sufficient for us to assent, even if we don't know how to say it any other way. Agent Brown clearly doesn't understand Agent Smith, as is revealed throughout this story.

```
                         LIEUTENANT
          I sent two units.  They're bringing
          her down now.

                         AGENT SMITH
          No, Lieutenant, your men are already
          dead.
```

Lieutenant is actually considering the possibility he is wildly wrong, but quickly defends against it. He's clueless fodder. 

More importantly, for that "already dead" line to be true, then the chronological order the story to presented to us must be misleading. 

```
INT.  CHASE HOTEL

The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding a
bead.  They've done this a hundred times, they know
they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuffs
and Trinity moves --

It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly
fast.
```

Prescient, perfect kung-fu, breaking the rules of reality. It's virtue of the practice.

```
The eye blinks and Trinity's palm snaps up and his nose
explodes, blood erupting.  Her leg kicks with the force of
a wrecking ball and he flies back, a two-hundred-fifty
pound sack of limp meat and bone that slams into the cop
farthest from her.
```

But can she fuck really well? Be nice to my penis, please.

```
Trinity moves again, BULLETS RAKING the WALLS, flashlights
sweeping with panic as the remaining cops try to stop a
leather-clad ghost.
```

A scene forever burned into my memory. This description doesn't capture it, and the movie tells the story. It's reality-bending of her fight-dance is mind-bending.

```
A GUN still in the cop's hand is snatched, twisted and
FIRED.  There is a final violent exchange of GUNFIRE and
when it's over, Trinity is the only one standing.

A flashlight rocks slowly to a stop.

                         TRINITY
          Shit.
```

Why the fuck didn't the agents just "jump into" these men? No, they must be "already dead." The mechanic is there from the beginning, I suppose. 

Trinity, however, is afraid for her life. She's not even considering how she was betrayed.

```
EXT.  CHASE HOTEL

Agent Brown enters the hotel while Agent Smith heads for
the alley.
```

Cooperation, or is it one mind? The initial sequences don't immediately let us know. Hindsight is 20/20 on the matter.


```
INT.  CHASE HOTEL

Trinity is on the phone, pacing.  The other end is
answered.
```

Okay, how/why the fuck is this phone being used? She doesn't display enough distrust. There are unanswered questions here.

```
                         MAN (V.O.)
          Operator.

                         TRINITY
          Morpheus!  The line was traced!  I
          don't know how.

                         MORPHEUS (MAN) (V.O.)
          I know.  They cut the hardline.
          This line is not a viable exit.

                         TRINITY
          Are they any agent?

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Yes.

                         TRINITY
          Goddamnit!

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          You have to focus.  There is a
          phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can
          make it.

She takes a deep breath, centering herself.

                         TRINITY
          All right --

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Go.

She drops the phone.
```

Look, if you think your communications are tampered with, why wouldn't you be open to the possibility that even these voices have been fabricated? She isn't paranoid enough, it seems. 

The interaction demonstrates enormous implicit trust. Morpheus' representation of reality is immediately accepted. She trust him  (and this voice she is listening to) with her life, very clearly.

She has so little time to react, to digest, to reason about the issue. It is a prudential matter to her that she must start somewhere in accepting what can be trusted, what is relatively true, which representations should be trusted without further justification in the moment.

The metaphor of a "viable exit," traced communication lines, and cut "hardlines" forces a bunch of questions about the ontology of the world in the film.

```
INT.  HALL

She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall,
leading another unit of police.  Trinity races to the
opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the
fire escape.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE

In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at
her.  She can only go up.
```

Trapped! There are those in the material dialectic who force us into enormously dangerous positions.

Does it matter that she can only "go up?" Does the direction matter?

```
EXT.  ROOF

On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over
the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.

Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her
movements so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,
contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.

Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.
```

Unnatural grace! Grace is always somehow supernatural, or pointing towards it. It is about [[The Good]] somehow.

```
The metal SCREAM of an elevated TRAIN is heard and Trinity
turns to it, racing for the back of the building.

The edge falls away into a wide back alley.  The next
building is over 40 feet away but Trinity's face is
perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other
roof.

The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something
ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself into
the air.

From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she
hangs in flight --

Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.

                         COP
          Mutherfucker - that's impossible!
```

The glitches in The Matrix, the ways in which what they take reality can be bent by others, are dawning on these people. The impossible was just demonstrated to be possible to them.

```
They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the
move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder up onto one
knee.
```
The cops are playing in a game with gods, and they are having a tough time coming to grips with it. Feels like mythology.

```
Just below the building are the RUMBLING TRACKS of riveted
steel.  The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a RATTLING blur
of gray metal.  Trinity jumps, landing easily.

She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air
barely reaching the last car --

Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.
```

Why do these gods use guns? Why not go full Terminator 2 on this? Why not something way more powerful? How do they miss? What does it mean for the Agents to not achieve their ends inside this simulation?

```
Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.
```

Feels like serendipity

```
Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point
where the train has begun to turn, there is --

A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick
building.

Trinity zeros in on it, running as hard as she can, her
speed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL
rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the
turn.

Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body
leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head
as --
```

A leap of faith for self-preservation.

```
HER POV

The whole world seems to spin on its axis --
```

Losing faith in our safety calls forth other kinds of faith axioms/inferences to be made. It's the only prudential thing to do, right? We still preserve as many of our axioms as we can while fighting to plug the hole in our Neurathian ship.

```
BACK TO SCENE

And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then
falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down
stairs bleeding, broken --

But still alive.
```

Her faith pays off. Risk-taking is a necessity.

```
Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,
still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the wind;
stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train slides
him past the window.

Trinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.

                         TRINITY
          Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.  Get
          up - just get up!

She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.
```

It's kind of weird that we have to talk to ourselves, to reframe things for ourselves, to wake ourselves up, to convince ourselves, etc.

```
Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the
end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she
sees it.

The telephone booth.
```

She can see the instrumental means to her ends. It's bright to her.

```
Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,
focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE
begins to RING.

Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly turns U-turns,
its TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.
```

How did they find her this fast? Why didn't they find her this fast before when the cops were being sent up to get her?

```
Trinity sees the headlights of the truck arcing at the
telephone booth as if taking aim.

Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --
```

Again, she makes a display faith in the possibility of success where others might not. I'd like to point out that it's interesting that they don't have more of their emergency outs memorized/coordinated. This seems like something they would have worked out before. Why do we even have this scene (except to motivate the story in a sense)?

```
Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly bright,
bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

She answers the phone.

There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking
mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --

Barrelling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick
wall, SMASHING it to PLEXIGLAS PULP.

After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of
the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.
There is no body.  Trinity is gone.
```

Now is it clear to us that Trinity can disappear from this simulation, not simply bend its rules.


```
His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.
AGENT JONES walks up behind him.
```

Why do they even have human appearances? This is a rhetorical device which doesn't actually fit how I might envision these creatures given what I understand about their context and identities otherwise.

```
                         AGENT JONES
          Then the informant is real.
```

A powerful claim, of course. What does it feel like to him? I assume he doesn't get to feel what the sentinal experiences (I could be wrong). The communicator is telling us the truth about what's outside the Cave. Presumably, these creatures can know there is something outside the Cave, and that is exactly what makes them evil: they are attempting to deceive and use people as mere means.

This line is more important that I initially understood. Perhaps it will take some time for me to peel it apart.

```
                         AGENT SMITH
          Does that surprise you?  It was
          inevitable.
```

Whoa, why would you make that prediction? What was inevitable about it? That is very strong language, and perhaps it is just exaggeration. I'd like to know what is going on inside of Agent Smith's head here. He could, for example, have been engaging in game-theoretic simulations of rebels, attempting to undrestand their psychology and sociology; this would perhaps give him justification for his "inevitability" prediction. Of course, we also have The Oracle kinds of problematics. 

Perhaps he just means that he agrees with Cypher's choice to defect. I do not see why Smith would make this claim, unless he is just being oddly social in a way I wouldn't have expected of him with the others agents.

```
                         AGENT JONES
          He'll be contacting us again.

                         AGENT SMITH
          Expect it.  Did you get anything
          from the room?
```

Again, the expectations issue is a crucial one, but I'm not sure what to do with it.


```
                         AGENT JONES
          Their next target.  The name is Neo.
```

It is New name. Names have power, of course. Speaking of which, Jones, Brown, and Smith are the most vanilla English names on might concieve. That is not an accident, of course. Expect it!


```
The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground, separated
in the crash like a severed limb.

                         AGENT SMITH
          We'll need a search running.

                         AGENT JONES
          It's already begun.
```

I don't understand why they have to say it outloud. I don't understand why there is doubt about the search being done. I don't understand why it would take long. I think AI would pick this shit out really fast. One worry I have is that the Wachowskis are actually poor writers here, and they are having me do all the heavy conceptual lifting.

```
We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER
and CLOSER, until the smooth gray plastic spreads out like
a horizon and the small holes widen until we FALL THROUGH
one --

Swallowed by DARKNESS.
```

I adore when communications appear to be central to understanding reality. Language does seem to be inescapably all that is available for to use, but it can't be all there is.

```
The DARKNESS BEGINS TO RIPPLE WITH BRIGHT FLASHES OF BONE
WHITE as we PULL OUT of the eye of a skull.

It is a computer screen saver; the Jolly Roger flutters
against an electronic wind.
```

Pirate the truth, motherfuckers. Welcome to my life. I have to take back epistemic authority.

What is shown in the movie, however, is "Searching..."


```
We DRIFT BACK FROM the screen and INTO --


INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

It is a studio apartment that seems overgrown with
technology.

Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into thickets
that wind up and around the legs of several desks.
```

This scene reminds me a scene in the third movie in which we see the machine world.

```
Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay
open like an autopsied corpse.

At the center of this technological rat-nest is NEO, a man
who knows more about living inside a computer than outside
one.
```

Ah, why do you think that? This is such an odd statement. Hmm. Of course, he's a computer living in several simulations (themselves computers). You mean living inside of the simulated silicon machines inside The Matrix itself. Somehow, that's exactly what makes him so fit to understand the truth though. 

```
He is asleep in front of his PC.  Behind him, the computer
screen suddenly goes blank.  A prompt appears:  "Wake up,
Neo."
```

Rooted!

```
Neo's eye pries open.  He sits up, one eye still closed,
looking around, unsure of where he is.  He notices the
screen.

He types "CTRL X" but the letter "T" appears.
```

Ctrl+X is used to "cut" in many contexts, although not the terminal. It could just be a "X" as in variable (that it somehow didn't matter it was "X", but that it was a variable for the "control" key?)

```
                         NEO
          What...?
```

W5H is one of my goto question sets in fundamental philosophy. Like I child, I just repeatedly ask them again and again.

```
He hits another and an "H" appears.  He keeps typing,
pushing random functions and keys while the computer types
out a message as though it had a mind of its own.
```

Sucks not to be in control of your own computer. For someone who takes pride in their computing, this would be a feeling of tremendous dread, pride damaging, truly frightening. You would understand the lines of possibility for it.

```
He stops and stares at the four words on the screen:
"The Matrix has you."
```

Titledrop with a single predicate. "Has" is such a clumsy word, except when you think it is malicious. Interestingly, I think of the simulation itself as The Matrix, but consider the architect and other agents to not actually be reducible to mere parts of The Matrix as a whole (at least the initial "inner" experience machine).


```
                         NEO
          What the hell?

He hits the "ESC" button.  Another message appears:
"Follow the white rabbit."
```

A bad sign if all you can do is mash the Escape key. It's slapping you in the face with "escape" though. Escape from that cave.

```
He hits it again and the message repeats.  He rubs his
eyes but when he opens them, there is another message:
"Knock, knock, Neo."

Someone KNOCKS on his door and he almost jumps out of his
chair.  He looks back at the computer but the screen is
now blank.

Someone KNOCKS again.  Neo rises, still unnerved.

                         NEO
          Who is it?

                         CHOI (O.S.)
          It's Choi.
```

Knock, knock. Who's there? 

I think it's odd that he isn't freaking out more than he is. But, clearly, he's open to the possibility it is a mere dream. I can't say my dream states are like that, but some can (I believe).

Choi := "a governor who oversees the land and the mountain"

For a hermit, opening the door is a non-trivial thing.

```
Neo opens the door, leaving the chain on.  A young Chinese
MAN stands with several of his friends.

                         NEO
          You're two hours late.

                         CHOI
          I know.  It's her fault.

His GIRLFRIEND only has to smile.

                         NEO
          You got the money?

                         CHOI
          Two grand.

He takes out an envelope and gives it to Neo through the
cracked door.

                         NEO
          Hold on.

He closes the door.  On the floor near his bed is a book,
Baudrillard's Simulacra Simulations.  The book has been
hollowed out and inside are several computer disks.  He
takes one, sticks the money in the book and drops it on
the floor.
```

Clearly, I need to go carefully through the book. I like that the book is simulating through its hollowness. That's a nice touch.


```
Opening the door, he hands the disk to Choi.

                         CHOI
          Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man!
          My own personal Jesus Christ!
```

Preach, yo! Literally figuratively slapping me in the face.

```
                         NEO
          If you get caught using that --

                         CHOI
          I know, I know.  This never
          happened.  You don't exist.

                         NEO
          Right...
```

More simulation, more gaming, more deception, more knowing what exists and does not. Power dynamics ride on misinformation all too often.

```
Neo nods as the strange feeling of unrealness suddenly
returns.
```

Derealization and depersonalization are serious considerations. The authors have clearly experienced it. I'm not convinced this part really happens in the movie though.

```
                         CHOI
          Something wrong, man?  You look a
          little whiter than usual.

                         NEO
          I don't know... My computer...

```

Yeah, didn't return...it was there the entire time. Choi is just now remarking on it.


```
He looks back at Choi, unable to explain what just
happened.

                         NEO
          You ever have the feeling that
          you're not sure if you're awake or
          still dreaming?

                         CHOI
          All the time.  It's called mescaline
          and it is the only way to fly.

He smiles and slaps the hand of his nearest droog.
```

Neo's line here is famous, and it's older than he is. 

I think the choice of mescaline is interesting. I think it's only half a joke as well. Hallucinogens do make us more open. Big 5 trait, anecdote, and classic sterotype on the matter. 

```
                         CHOI
          It sounds to me like you need to
          unplug, man.  A little R and R.
          What do you think, Dujour, should we
          take him with us?

                         DUJOUR (GIRLFRIEND)
          Definitely.
```

This girl is ridiculously hot. Insanely. I need to unplug and plug into her. Of course, the language of unplugging here is outstanding. The call for an adventure down the rabbithole. This wiki is at least partially due to this scene.

```
                         NEO
          I can't.  I have to work tomorrow.

                         DUJOUR
          Come on.  It'll be fun.  I promise.
```

Seems like a poor argument, right?

```
He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  bands, symbols,
slogans, military medals and --

A small white rabbit.

The ROOM TILTS.

                         NEO
          Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.
```

I don't think I'd be able to think that fast on my feet. I probably wouldn't have noticed it. I think it's very, very interesting that Trinity is somehow presciently aware of Neo actually seeing the white rabbit. The girl has to move her body to make it visible, like a freak accident. Either Trinity got really lucky or she is able to decode the deterministic patterns in the girl's behavior and Neo's (for actually looking at it, recognizing it in the moment, etc.)

These are, of course, signs. The book is screaming to us.

```
INT.  APARTMENT

An older apartment; a series of halls connects a chain of
small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy casements.

Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there
are.

Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,
gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like jungle
cats around a tree.
```

And, one of my favorite numetal songs. Can I say more about how much I care about the aesthetic? It's a fucking masterpiece.


```
Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle of
beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to
leave when he notices a woman staring at him.

The woman is Trinity.  She walk straight up to him.

In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.

                         TRINITY
          Hello, Neo.

                         NEO
          How do you know that name?
```

Okay. Is that really the first question? It's obviously the person who pwned him (or related). That would not be my first question. Of course, Neo's name is no accident. Perhaps this is an allusion to more.

```
                         TRINITY
          I know a lot about you.  I've been
          wanting to meet you for some time.

                         NEO
          Who are you?

                         TRINITY
          My name is Trinity.

                         NEO
          Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity
          that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City
          D-Base?
```

D-Base /cringe. Okay, whatever.

Why is the IRS hack the interesting part? Look, your hacking me personally would be what had my interest. That's what we'd be talking about first. This is not logical to me.


```
                         TRINITY
          That was a long time ago.

                         NEO
          Gee-zus.

                         TRINITY
          What?

                         NEO
          I just thought... you were a guy.

                         TRINITY
          Most guys do.
```

Lol! Zing! Hard to find legit badass women in fiction (I'm sorry). This is actually believable. I love that.


```
Neo is a little embarrassed.

                         NEO
          Do you want to go somewhere and
          talk?

                         TRINITY
          No.  It's safe here and I don't have
          much time.
```

Not in the movie? This script draft isn't quite right.


```
The MUSIC is so LOUD they must stand very close, talking
directly into each other's ear.

                         NEO
          That was you on my computer?

She nods.

                         NEO
          How did you do that?

                         TRINITY
          Right now, all I can tell you, is
          that you are in danger.  I brought
          you here to warn you.
```

I"m not sure what I'd think at this point. She hacked me. Why should I trust her? What does she offer him? Intrigue, hotness, the right "feel"? I don't know. Perhaps it is just a matter of faith, which this film is clearly all about.

```
                         NEO
          Of what?

                         TRINITY
          They're watching you, Neo.
```

A haunting line that sticks with me. Ultimately, I do my best to let go of my paranoid tendencies. I have been correct many times, of course. I think it's about overshooting the mean to land on it.

```
                         NEO
          Who is?

                         TRINITY
          Please.  Just listen.  I know why
          you're here, Neo.  I know why you
          left your family and your friends,
          why you left your home to come to
          this city.  You're looking for him.
```

That's not what was said in the movie. It's close.

```
Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.

                         TRINITY
          I know because I came looking for
          the same thing, but when he found me
          he told me I wasn't really looking
          for him.  I was looking for an
          answer.

There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels the
words, like a drug, seeping into him.
```

Yes. She does "seep" into him. It's a memetic injection. It's odd that they talk about Morpheus as the real pursuit. I don't understand why there is a focus (at the apt. on his screen initially and now here). This doesn't make sense. He's looking for Plato, but really it's what Plato can show him.

```
                         TRINITY
          It's the question that brought you
          here.  You know the question just as
          I did.  It is a hacker's question.
```

Not exactly what is said in the film, but the gist is correct. Lifehacker, go!

```
                         NEO
          What is the Matrix?

                         TRINITY
          When I asked him, he said that no
          one could ever be told the answer to
          that question.  They have to see it
          to believe it.
```

Ah. That is ultimately a very philosophical answer. I fought against this claim for decades. God damn. I wish I was listening.

```
She leans close, her lips almost touching his ear.

                         TRINITY
          The answer is out there, Neo.  It's
          looking for you and it will find
          you, if you want it to.
```

Classic quote. I hate to say it, but I'm not sure what it really means. It has too much agency embedded in the answerer. The film regularly forces this stuff which doesn't make sense, and maybe that's on purpose. I can say, with deep regret, that the authors never made any other work which mattered to me (bordering on childishness). I worry that as the reader I'm simply contributing too much to the highly symbolic and sufficently-generic words being used here. I have mixed feelings on the matter. The Straussian in me, of course, tells me to jump down the rabbithole anyways. That rat bastard. ;P


```
She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
of bodies.

A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the MUSIC, pressing
in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to
consciousness.  He strains to read the clock-face:
9:15 AM.
```

Love how it really might have all been a dream. But, I have to say, if I experienced this, I don't think I would find it to be a dream. I also think I leave lots of clues for myself about the nature of my reality. My wiki is only one example of this. It's an existential anchor, of course. I think I was non-trivially prepared for drug usage through this film.

```
                         NEO
          Shitshitshit.


EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development
company.


INT.  CORTECHS OFFICE

The main offices are along each wall, the windows
overlooking downtown.  RHINEHEART, the ultimate company
man, lectures Neo without looking at him, typing at his
computer continuously.

Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down the surface
of the glass.

                         RHINEHEART
          You have a problem with authority,
          Mr. Anderson.  You believe that you
          are special, that somehow the rules
          do not apply to you.
```

Anti-authoritarian. Check.

What rules, of course? Social conventions without further justification? Obviously not. Business conventions? Only insofar as you really take them to be instrumentally normative, of course. Once we get to moral and more standard epistemic rules, and in the case of this film, ontic rules as well, we start we see that Mr. Anderson really does have something special about him.

Is there something special about being a philosopher? I legitimately think so. I really do take it to be part of my telos. Yes, I am an elitist and differentiationist who thinks that not everything and not everyone's lives, opinions, feelings, actions, reality maps, etc. are equal. How do I know, and how do I know what is good? These, of course, are fundamental philosophical questions. 

I can hear the neo-Aristotelians quietly shaking their heads at me. Yeah. Fuck you. Non-cognitive virtue of the practice just isn't enough; it really does take studying theory to maximize the value of your practice.

```
He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo who turns in
time.

                         RHINEHEART
          Obviously, you are mistaken.
```

Oh, obviously. 

```
His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.

                         RHINEHEART
          This company is one of the top
          software companies in the world
          because every single employee
          understands that they are part of a
          whole.  Thus, if an employee has a
          problem, the company has a problem.
```

Parts and Wholes are classic issues here. And, it's obviously crucial to understand the structure of experience machines and reality itself. Today, I'm thinking speculative realism about this issue.

```
He turns again.

                         RHINEHEART
          The time has come to make a choice,
          Mr. Anderson.  Either you choose to
          be at your desk on time from this
          day forth, or you choose to find
          yourself another job.  Do I make
          myself clear?

                         NEO
          Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly
          clear.
```

Submit in the dialectic, foo.

```
INT.  NEO'S CUBICLE

The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a
labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
elevators.

Neo slumps down into his chair.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
          Thomas Anderson?

Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle
door.

                         NEO
          Yeah.  That's me.

Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex Man hands him
the softpak.

                         FEDEX MAN
          Have a nice day.

He opens the bag.  Inside is a cellular PHONE.  It seems
the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS.  Unnerved, he
flips it open.

                         NEO
          Hello?

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this
          is?
```

I think this film spends a great deal of time asking questions like that. That's the point, I assume.

I have to say, I find the way in which Morpheus attracts/converts Neo doesn't make much sense to me. This feels forced.

```
Neo's knees give and he sinks into his chair.

                         NEO
          Morpheus...

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          I've been looking for you, Neo.  I
          don't know if you're ready to see
          what I want to show you, but
          unfortunately, we have run out of
          time.  They're coming for you, Neo.
          And I'm not sure what they're going
          to do.
```

I don't fully understand Morpheus. They've clearly syncretized a great deal here. It's kind of like Plato looking for Christ. That's fine, but I worry it muddies it. Artists can just say thats the intention, and I have no way to disconfirm it.

```
                         NEO
          Who's coming for me?

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Stand up and see for yourself.

                         NEO
          Right now?

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Yes.  Now.
```

Why does Neo trust what's happening to him, the people he's communicating with, etc.? Look, if I had lived the past 24 hours he had, I think I'd have cause not to react so non-chalantly and trustingly. 


```
Neo starts to stand.

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Do it slowly.  The elevator.

His head peeks up over the partition.

At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones
leading a group of cops.  A female employee turns and
points out Neo's cubicle.

Neo ducks.

                         NEO
          Holy fucking shit!

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Yes.
```

I adore this all-knowing "yes" tone in the film. It's hilarious. Some trust appears earned here.

So, why don't the agents use their superpowers more often in the general public? If it ain't no thang for them, why not? It's efficient. I suppose the argument is that they hope to maintain social constructions of how the world is to not make people go insane/reject The Matrix. But, I think they already do that plenty throughout the film. I want to better understand the thought process here.

```
One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the
agents.

                         NEO
          What the fuck do they want with me?!

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          I'm not sure, but if you don't want
          to find out, you better get out of
          there.

                         NEO
          How?!

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          I can guide you out, but you have to
          do exactly what I say.
```

Join the cult! The paranoid would consider the possibility that Morpheus has orchestrated all of this. Keanu plays the patsy just fine.

```
The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          The cubicle across from you is
          empty.

                         NEO
          But what if...?

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Go!  Now!

Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle
just as the agents turn into his row.

Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone
tightly to him.
```
Why don't the agents not hear him? How are they not visualizing this? How do they not know he's in the other cubicle? Why aren't they monitoring the other humans in the building with him as they do in so many other contexts?

```
                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Stay here for a moment.

The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to
search the bathroom.
```

Why are the agents so incompetent and powerless at times and then inexplicably gods in other times?

```
Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          A little longer...

Brown is talking to another employee.

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          When I tell you, go to the end of
          the row to the first office on the
          left, stay as low as you can.
```

It's very weird how Morpheus can see what is happening in the code of The Matrix here but the Agents don't seem capable. None of the reasons I can come up with seem plausible.

The "being watched" schizophrenic component is fascinating.

```
Sweat trickles down his forehead.

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Now.

Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he
freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.

Staying crouched, he sneaks away down the row, shooting
across the opening to the first office on the left.

The room is empty.
```

Modern surveillance appears to be radically stronger than this. I'm surprised how un-Big-Brother-like this film is at times. It was not visionary enough about the state of control I expect. AI's enslaving mankind would have been radically more effective than this. It's obvious.

```
                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Good.  Now there is a window.  Open
          it.
```

This parallels a future line about Neo having to walk through the door, since Morpheus can only show him. Feel Platonic Cave territory.

```
                         NEO
          How do you know all this?

Morpheus laughs quietly.

                         MORPHEUS
          The answer is coming, Neo.
```

How do you wake people from their dogmatic slumber? This reminds me of a thought experiment I often play with myself in which a future version of me has to come back and convince me in a matter of minutes that they are my future self with just an argument. What would that argument need to look like? I'm kind of surprised that technique isn't used more in this story (although, it is alluded to a few minutes from now).

```
He opens the window.  The WIND HOWLS into the room.

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Outside, there's a scaffold.  You
          can use it to get to the roof.

Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is
several offices away.

                         NEO
          No!  It's too far away.

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          There's a small ledge.  It's a short
          climb.  You can make it.

Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigoes into a
concrete chasm.

                         NEO
          No way, no way, this is crazy.
```

This is a test of Neo's faith in Morpheus, but a test of his integrity and willingness to risk it all to escape and find the truth. It's pretty hard to convince people to leave it behind. Just unshackling people in the cave is difficult, let alone helping them truly escape the mouth of the cave.

```
                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          There are only two ways out of this
          building.  One is that scaffold.
          The other is in their custody.  You
          take a chance either way.  I leave
          it to you.

CLICK.  He hangs up.  Neo looks at the door, then back at
the scaffold.
```

The issue of freedom is a central theme of The Matrix. This is one of the genuine feeling choices presented to us. This, of course, echoes the coming pill choice scene. Yet, again, I think a paranoid person would have to question whether or not this was a really a choice as well.

```
                         NEO
          This is insane!  Why is this
          happening to me?  What did I do?
          I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.
          Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
```

This may be the strongest version of this sentiment in the film. Why? Perhaps Keanu is chosen because he can look dazed throughout the film. It is a whirlwind.

```
He climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the
frame, he steps onto the small ledge.

The scaffold seems even farther away.

                         NEO
          I'm going to die.
```

Classic line there. What does one do when faced with death? How ought on think? Conservative tendancies arise.

```
The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,
knocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to
the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.

He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.

                         NEO
          This is insane!  I can't do this!
          Forget it!
```

The pursuit of truth often feels like that. You are saving your life from ignorance, and the unknown is scary+dangerous.

```
He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
door.

                         NEO
          I didn't do anything!


EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving
doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the
dark sedan.

Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her motorcycle.

                         TRINITY
          Shit.
```

This scene always bothered me. Why didn't they chase her? It's obvious they should have. Why do they even really need her on the ground right there? If you can watch the computer code the whole time, this was irrelevant. The escape, of course, was dumb from the beginning.

Why it is that agents have to transfigure into other humans really doesn't make sense to me. Why must those rules be followed? Whoever fucking designed The Matrix did a really shitty programming job it seems.

```
INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

CLOSE ON a camera monitor; wide angle view of a white room
where Neo is sitting at a table alone.

We MOVE INTO the monitor, entering the room as if the
monitor was a window.
```

We see the architect scene when the Agents first acquire Neo. It's not telegraphed in the script. Hrmm...they changed it in anticipation.

```
At the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.
Agent Smith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila
envelope slaps down on the table between them.

Neo glances at the name on the file: "Anderson, Thomas A."

                         AGENT SMITH
          As you can see, we've had our eye on
          you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he
flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at
the file or at him.

                         AGENT SMITH
          It seems that you have been living
          two lives.  In one life, you are
          Thomas A. Anderson, program writer
          for a respectable software company.
          You have a social security number,
          you pay your taxes and you help your
          landlady carry out her garbage.
```

Philosophers lead two lives. Caught between two worlds.

This is one of the most memorable scenes from the film. The confrontation with authorities (unjustified, it seems) is heart-thumping. I imagine Socrates was somehow mentally prepared for it. Agent Smith is smooth, rational sounding. So far, he tells the truth too.

```
The pages continue to turn.

                         AGENT SMITH
          The other life is lived in computers
          where you go by the hacker alias
          Neo, and are guilty of virtually
          every computer crime we have a law
          for.
```

Likely exaggeration. It also seems really odd to have the dossier but have done anything with it. Exactly what purposes do the Agents serve, and why should we think they are competent?

```
Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.

                         AGENT SMITH
          One of these lives has a future.
          One of them does not.
```

Agent Smith says only own life has a future, but he doesn't specify which. DING DING DING DING DING!

```
He closes the file.

                         AGENT SMITH
          I'm going to be as forthcoming as I
          can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are here
          because we need your help.
```

The modality of "can" here is suspect.

More problematically, why should we think the Agents really need Neo's help. This is slapped together, and it has loose ends.

```
He removes his sunglasses, his eyes are unnatural ice-
blue.
```

Not exactly what we see in the movie, but they obviously chose the actor for his eyes. The demeanor and expression are uncanny valley territory.

```
                         AGENT SMITH
          We know that you have been contacted
          by a certain individual.  A man who
          calls himself Morpheus.  Whatever
          you think you know about this man is
          irrelevant to the fact that he is
          wanted for acts of terrorism in more
          countries than any other man in the
          world.  He is considered by many
          authorities to be the most dangerous
          man alive.
```

Deals with the devil. Deception in this. What authorities? Why would it be irrelevant? Surely this is false.

```
He leans closer.

                         AGENT SMITH
          My colleagues believe that I am
          wasting my time with you but I
          believe you want to do the right
          thing.  It is obvious that you are
          an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,
          and that you are interested in the
          future.  That is why I believe you
          are ready to put your past mistakes
          behind you and get on with your
          life.

Neo stares to match his stare.

                         AGENT SMITH
          We are willing to wipe the slate
          clean, to give you a fresh start and
          all we are asking in return is your
          cooperation in bringing a known
          terrorist to justice.
```

Rhetoric. He's a sophist. It is a memetic construction designed to deceive and control (like The Matrix itself). You know, I'm surprised Agent Smith isn't far, far more persuasive. I expect AI to have better theories of our minds, models of sociological control (and security), and methods of interrogation. Why isn't he better at manipulating? 

```
Neo nods to himself.

                         NEO
          Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a real
          good deal.  But I think I have a
          better one.  How about I give you
          the finger --

He does.

                         NEO
          And you can cram that file up your
          Secret Service sphincter.
```

Cyberpunk. Who doesn't adore the anti-authoritarian "fuck you" (when it is justified). All this said, I'm surprised Anderson doesn't feel more compelled. I don't think this would be his reaction given what he has experienced so far.

```
Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.

                         AGENT SMITH
          You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.

                         NEO
          You can't scare me with Gestapo
          crap.  I know my rights.  I want my
          phone call!
```

Seems pretty unreal to me. 

```
Agent Smith smiles.

                         AGENT SMITH
          And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good
          is a phone call if you are unable to
          speak?
```

Do they not reveal their superpowers to him simply because they think they'll be more successful by not doing so? Why not increment here and give him one more shot to be convinced? This is not logical. You have these superpowers to convince (superpowers that likely negated the need for any of these scenes, if we are being honest), and you don't use them?

```
The question unnerves Neo and strangely he begins to feel
the muscles in his jaw tighten.

The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion grow
into panic.

Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
seal shut, melding into each other until all traces of his
mouth are gone.

Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents
restrain him, holding him in the chair.
```

Btw, the restraint here was poorly fucking acted. It's even worse than the cubicle escape scene. It's well within the scope of the aesthetic of the film, but they should have polished this. It looks like some ridiculous cartoon to me.

```
                         AGENT SMITH
          You are going to help us, Mr.
          Anderson, whether you want to or
          not.

Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.

From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a
long, fiber-optic wire tap.

Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over
his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the
electronic device animates, becoming an organic creature
that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.

Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into Neo's
navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature which
looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --

-- before it begins to borrow, its tall thrashing as it
worms its way inside.
```

Look, I don't see why this is the best way. Surely there are wildly stronger methods available to them. This isn't even beginning to look at the possibilities available.

I will say: they got the Star Trek "bug" moment down pat. We all had those nightmares.

```
INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.

He realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth
is normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a
deep, everything-is-okay breath when --
```

Waking from dreams, questioning reality, inspecting your experiences. I love that they continue to do it at multiple levels in this film. That said, I think I'd be having far stronger reactions than Neo here. I do not understand his neutrality towards these experiences.

```
The PHONE RINGS.

It almost stops his heart.  It continues RINGING, building
pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking
him in with an almost gravitational force.
```

Hrmm... not really the impression I get from the movie.

```
He answers it, saying nothing.

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          This line is tapped so I must be
          brief.

                         NEO
          The agents --

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          They got to you first, but they've
          underestimated how important you
          are.  If they knew what I know, you
          would probably be dead.
```

Agents would have been swarming. This is a huge hole in the plot. The authors rest everything on the mantle of fate. Why aren't the agents more directly following Neo? Why don't they just assume his shape once he can see Morpheus. They don't need a bug for that, right? What does the bug even do?


```
                         NEO
          What do you know?

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          You're the One, Neo.  You see, you
          may have spent the last few years
          looking for me, but I've spent most
          of my life looking for you.

Neo feels sick.

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Do you still want to meet?

                         NEO
          ... Yes.

                         MORPHEUS (V.O.)
          Go the the Adams Street bridge.

CLICK.  He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.
```

It might be a blur to him, but it feels like he is purposely not thoughtful about his situation.


```
EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

It is just beyond the middle of the night; that time when
it seems there are no rules and everything feels unsafe.

Neo's boots scrape against the concrete.  Every pair of
eyes he passes seems to follow him.

As he reaches the bridge, headlights creep in behind him.
He turns just as the car slides quickly to a stop beside
him.  The back door opens.

                         TRINITY
          Get in.
```

This scene was cut for the reason I mention above. If he were being watched, then the Agents would have prevented him from escaping The Matrix, caught Morpheus, ipso facto, etc.

```
INT.  CAR

A large black man named APOC is driving.  Beside him is a
beautiful androgyne called SWITCH, aiming a large gun at
Neo.

                         NEO
          What the hell is this?!

                         TRINITY
          It's necessary, Neo.  For our
          protection.

                         NEO
          From what?

                         TRINITY
          From you.

She lifts a strange steel and glass device that looks like
a cross between a rib separator, speculum and air
compressor.

                         SWITCH
          Take off your shirt.

He looks at the strange device and the gun still trained
on him.

                         NEO
          What?  Why?
```

Umm...how does he not immediately know what they are doing? He remembers his dream. He should have thought about this. This part doesn't make any sense at all.

```
                         SWITCH
          Stop the car.

Apoc does.

                         SWITCH
          Listen to me, coppertop!  We don't
          have time for 'twenty questions.'
          Right now there is only one rule.
          Our way or the highway.
```

Coppertop is an interesting name. I suppose it is an allusion to being a "battery." There seems to be little compassion in it, in a way. I suppose she has to see him as a possible enemy. This part of the plot is weak.


```
                         NEO
          Fine.

                         TRINITY
          No, we can't let him go --

Neo opens the door.

                         TRINITY
          Neo, please, you have to trust me.

                         NEO
          Why?

                         TRINITY
          Because you've been down there, Neo.
          You already know that road.  You
          know exactly where it ends.

Neo stares out into the dark street beyond the open door.

                         TRINITY
          And I know that's not where you want
          to be.
```

That is one of the most important lines in the story to me. The madness of doing the same thing, not taking philosophical risks to solve our existential problems, etc. Somehow, we must find the right end.

```
                         NEO
          ... shit.

He closes the door.
```

I don't recall "shit" being uttered. There was far too much drama to the scene to ruin it.


```
EXT.  LOWER WACKER

A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve over
the car's tinted windshield as it rushes through the
underworld.


INT.  CAR

Neo grudgingly strips off his T-shirt.

                         TRINITY
          Lie back.
```

There was a stronger tempo in the film. It was more dangerous feeling. Some of the moves away from the script have been valuable to not only hiding their mistakes (a bit), but also genuinely improved the story itself.


```
Trinity sets the device over Neo's stomach its three
corners resting on the points of his pelvis and sternum.
She then guides a mounted cylindrical probe into his navel
and squeezes a hand pump a few times to form a tight seal.

                         NEO
          What is this thing?

                         TRINITY
          We think you're bugged.  Try to
          relax.
```

As I said before, how does he not know exactly what they are talking about? This is annoying.

```
She turns a dial and the machine bears down on Neo's
midsection, the cylinder sucking hard at his stomach.

Neo screams, squinting in pain as Trinity watches the
needle on a pressure gauge climb steadily.

                         TRINITY
          Come on, come on...

The machine quivers as the pressure builds higher and
higher until something finally rockets wetly out of Neo's
stomach through the machine's coils.

                         TRINITY
          Got it.

Trinity shuts off the compressor, Neo cradling his
stomach.
```

They made it to be more of a timed game, as though she would lose it. More importantly, and I harp on it again, how the fuck isn't this sending signals to the Agents. Where is the self-defense mechanism?

```
                         NEO
          Got what?  My spleen?
```

They changed it. This line is even worse than the movie, and the movie was a fuck up here.


```
Trinity lifts a glass cage at the end of the tubing.
Inside the small fluke-like bug flips and squirms, its
tendrils flapping against the clear walls.

She unrolls the window and dumps it out.


EXT.  CAR

It hits the pavement with a metallic tink, reverted back
into a common wire tap, as the car disappears down the
street.
```

When it rains in The Matrix, it rains hard.

Why would it die off in the movie? Also, the thing they pulled out of him doesn't really look like the thing that was injected. Call it magic change or whatever. It bothers me.

```
EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

The car stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten
hotel.
```

So, why aren't they worried about being followed or found by Agents at this point? Why aren't there extra precautions being taken. I feel like I'm being lied to by the author. They used rhetoric to force the story instead of logic.

```
INT.  LAFAYETTE

It is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of
urban maggotry.

Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the
thirteenth floor.  They stop outside room 1313.

                         TRINITY
          This is it.

Neo can hear his own heart pounding.

                         TRINITY
          Let me give one piece of advice.  Be
          honest.  He knows more than you can
          possibly imagine.
```

Plato/God whatever usually does. Trinity also claimed to know a great deal, particularly about Neo. 

"Possibly imagine" is such an interesting phrase to me. It is related to the possibility of possibilities, in my view. She means currently imagine, not possibly. He clearly does imagine it later. This phrase needs more analysis. The author/Trinity is wrong, but wrong is an important way.

```
INT.  ROOM 1313

Across the room, a DARK FIGURE stares out the tall windows
veiled with decaying lace.  He turns and his smile lights
up the room

                         MORPHEUS
          At last.
```

I'm confused why all the drama must take place. I suppose that's part of having a Christ figure. I think there were obviously easier and more economical logistics here.

```
He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
behind circular mirrored glasses.
```

The glasses are cool AF.

```
He strides to Neo and they shake hands.

                         MORPHEUS
          Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have
          guessed, I am Morpheus.

                         NEO
          It's an honor.

                         MORPHEUS
          Please.  Come.  Sit.
```

Not how the film goes. There is more John the Baptist in the actual scene than we see here. It's clearly religious in the film.

```
He nods to Trinity.

                         MORPHEUS
          Thank you, Trinity.

She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an
adjacent room.
```

I always found it odd that she must exit. It felt forced. Why couldn't the other watch? To me, this 1-on-1 interaction smacks of dishonesty, even though it is meant to be the absolute opposite, right?

```
They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-
leather chairs.

                         MORPHEUS
          I imagine, right now, you must be
          feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
          down the rabbit hole?
```

The image becomes literal, imho. It's an important reference.

```
                         NEO
          You could say that.

                         MORPHEUS
          I can see it in your eyes.  You have
          the look of a man who accepts what
          he sees because he is expecting to
          wake up.
```

Now that is true! Keanu nails that really hard, and frankly, a lot of my comments might just be answered by this one line. Plato speaks.

```
A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.

                         MORPHEUS
          Ironically, this is not far from the
          truth.  But I'm getting ahead of
          myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why
          are you here?

                         NEO
          You're Morpheus, you're a legend.
          Most hackers would die to meet you.

                         MORPHEUS
          Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we
          both know there's more to it than
          that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?

                         NEO
          No.

                         MORPHEUS
          Why not?

                         NEO
          Because I don't like the idea that
          I'm not in control of my life.

                         MORPHEUS
          I know exactly what you mean.
```

The cheese was clearly eliminated, and thank goodness. /gag

Fate, of course, is not at all effectively addressed in the film. Determinism, yes. The Oracle may be a fateseer, and the religious elements seem to show it. Unfortunately, the distinction seems lost, and I daresay that Morpheus borders on holding an inconsistent position. I think he has some outs though.

```
Again, that smile that could cut glass.

                         MORPHEUS
          Let me tell you why you are here.
          You have come because you know
          something.  What you know you can't
          explain but you feel it.  You've
          felt it your whole life, felt that
          something is wrong with the world.
          You don't know what, but it's there
          like a splinter in your mind,
          driving you mad.  It is this feeling
          that brought you to me.  Do you know
          what I'm talking about?
```

Ah. I know that splinter well! I swear I hear the words of a prophet here. They scream out to me. Do autists and schizophrenics have this most strongly? Is it a matter of Bayesian reasoning or beyond? What is it that one feels in this way? Is it a particular relation to the world, the appearance of the world, or something else? Something is wrong, and you have the notion of 'rightness', and perhaps that is enough. I love how absurdly generic these claims are while somehow being accuratizable/particularizable/contextualizable. That is often the sign of good rhetoric, yes. It doesn't seem to be rhetoric to me though.

```
                         NEO
          The Matrix?

                         MORPHEUS
          Do you want to know what it is?
```

Well, no shit, sherlock. So, I take it you think you must ask for consent? But, clearly, consent only halfways matters. Morpheus is inconsistent on this matter, even though the authors attempt to paint him as a powerful freedom fighter. If his religion says to do it, consent be damned.

```
Neo swallows hard and nods.

                         MORPHEUS
          The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
          around us, here even in this room.
          You can see it out your window or on
          your television.  You feel it when
          you go to work, or go to church or
          pay your taxes.  It is the world
          that has been pulled over your eyes
          to blind you from the truth.

                         NEO
          What truth?

                         MORPHEUS
          That you are a slave, Neo.  Like
          everyone else, you were born into
          bondage, kept inside a prison that
          you cannot smell, taste, or touch.
          A prison for your mind.
```

It's truly beautiful. It's a poetic way to say something which I want to use technical language to describe. 

```
The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.

                         MORPHEUS
          Unfortunately, no one can be told
          what the Matrix is.  You have to see
          it for yourself.
```

Um, no that's not true! He could be told. This is a lie! This is rhetoric! I am disturbed by this claim. I agree there is a qualia to escaping the experience machine, but I also think you can easily teach a computer hacker how to reason about living inside a simulation.

```
Morpheus opens his hands.  In the right is a red pill.  In
the left, a blue pill.

                         MORPHEUS
          This is your last chance.  After
          this, there is no going back.  You
          take the blue pill and the story
          ends.  You wake in your bed and you
          believe whatever you want to
          believe.
```

Magicians "force" all the time. This always felt like one. Perhaps we are meant to be tricked into thinking it might be "fate." The scene is still ridiculously important. It is the "final" choice in the cave.

Why should we think Morpheus would really allow Neo not to take the redpill? Why are we even engaged in this dialogue at all?

I am struck by the final line. Obviously, he wouldn't be "woke," it isn't really "his bed," and he wouldn't be believing just "whatever" he wanted to believe. I suggest that the same line, unfortunately, could also be said on the other side (with the redpill).

```
The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.

                         MORPHEUS
          You take the red pill and you stay
          in Wonderland and I show you how
          deep the rabbit hole goes.
```

This is annoyingly inaccurate, but the Cave analogy always has that problem. You are going to stay in the Wonderland; in fact, nobody ever fully escapes that problem (and you can't by definition, that's part of the problem itself). He does attempt to show how deep it goes though.


```
Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture
growing in his palms.

                         MORPHEUS
          Remember that all I am offering is
          the truth.  Nothing more.
```

What more would there be to offer? And, clearly, it is only a representation of the truth as well.

```
Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The
Cheshire smile returns.

                         MORPHEUS
          Follow me.
```

Huh. It was a Cheshire smile. I never realized it. Perhaps I need to go back to follow the Alice story more closely against this script. That seems like an obvious thing to do.

```
He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with
high-tech equipment, glowing ash-blue and electric green
from the racks of monitors.

Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.

                         MORPHEUS
          Apoc, are we on-line?

                         APOC
          Almost.

He and Trinity are working quickly, hard-wiring a complex
system of monitors, modules and drives.
```

Okay, this is one of my biggest hang-ups, and they never truly resolve it. Personally, I feel like they did it at least enable vulnerability someone and not suffer the immediate Superman problem. I really don't fucking see why they need the gadgets inside to do this work. Why not do everything externally, outside The Matrix (at least the inner one)?

This just doesn't seem necessary at all.

```
                         MORPHEUS
          Neo, time is always against us.
          Will you take a seat there?
```

Umm... Why is time against you? Every reason I can think of would be such that you'd already be caught! This is incoherent.


```
Neo sits in a chair in the center of the room and Trinity
begins gently fixing white electrode disks to his head,
arms, and the back of his neck.  Near the chair is an old
oval dressing mirror that is cracked.

He whispers to Trinity:

                         NEO
          You did all this?

She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.  They
are wired to an old hotel phone.
```

His trust in her continues to build. I like that part. It goes nicely with the story.

```
                         MORPHEUS
          The pill you took is part of a trace
          program.  It's designed to disrupt
          your input/output carrier signal so
          we can pinpoint your location.
```

Yeah. I get this hand-waiving attempt at the problem. I just don't buy it.


```
                         NEO
          What does that mean?

                         CYPHER
          It means buckle up, Dorothy, 'cause
          Kansas is going bye-bye.
```

The build-up is really nice. Exiting the cave is phenomenologically profound. This is humorous and accurate.

```
Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc pounding
on a keyboard.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and
twitch when he notices the mirror.

Wide-eyed, he stares as it begins to heal itself, a
webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
mirror were becoming liquid.
```

It reminds me of several psychedelics, but especially ketamine. I would be shocked to hear the authors haven't themselves used these substances. It's too fucking sensational for them not to have some picture in their head already generated through experience with mind-altering substances. The nod to the classic mescaline earlier is a signal too, I think.

```
                         NEO
          Shit...
```

Glad they changed it.

```
Cypher works with Apoc, checking reams of phosphorescent
data.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.

Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers
disappear beneath the rippling surface.

Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy
stuck to his fingertips.
```

Why the fuck does he touch it? I think I'd possibly be freaking out too much for that. 

The mirror is the perfect object. This scene is poetic.

```
                         MORPHEUS
          Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that
          you were so sure was real?
```

Epic line. 

I hate to say it, but none of my dreams ever come close. I think part of what protects me from certain kinds of schizophrenic delusions is how fucking autistically grounded I am to my sensations at the expense of such models.


```
                         NEO
          This can't be...

                         MORPHEUS
          Be what?  Be real?
```

Hello, philosophy. =)

```
The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,
until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.

                         MORPHEUS
          What if you were unable to wake from
          that dream, Neo?  How would you know
          the difference between the dream
          world and the real world?
```

At some point, you must stop asking yourself that. There is some point in your ontic questioning that you stop, a causal question of the nature of the external world. There is another point where you stop asking for epistemic justification for the "thing in itself." You must eventually have a Bob turtle of "turtles all the way down," a foundation (even to your coherence standard). This is where your trusting trust faith in the paradoxical begins.

```
With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering SNOWFLAKES of
electric-blinking mercury fall, HIT the GROUND, and fade.

Neo looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored
icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running like
wax down his fingers, spreading across his palm where he
sees his face reflected.
```

Fascinating verbal description of a fascinating graphical representation. Again, looks like heavy drug usage.

```
                         NEO
          Uh-oh...

                         TRINITY
          It's going into replication.
```

I don't recall this particular line. That's not how it goes, right?

```
                         MORPHEUS
          Apoc?

                         APOC
          Still nothing.

Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.

                         MORPHEUS
          Tank, we're going to need the signal
          soon.

The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up
his arms like hundreds of insects.

                         NEO
          It's cold.
```

That's not the line. There was more urgency to the situation too.

```
The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,
tipping his head as though he were sinking into the
mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.

                         NEO
          It's all over me --

Morpheus is right next to him with the phone.

                         TRINITY
          I got a fibrillation!

                         MORPHEUS
          Shit!  Apoc?

Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.
```

Glad they changed it. This is silly. They needed to have more magic to it, and I'm glad they did.

```
                         APOC
          Targeting... almost there.

An ALARM on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.

                         TRINITY
          He's going into arrest!

                         APOC
          Lock!  I got him!

                         MORPHEUS
          Now, Tank, now!
```

I love watching this scene, but reading about it makes me feel like there are tons of holes and incoherences. Importantly, it forces me to pay attention to the inceptional/recursive experience machine problem which plagues the series (on purpose). I'm not in love with it.

```
His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a
high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM erupts in the headphones --

It is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to another
computer --

Neo's body arches in agony and we are PULLED like we were
pulled INTO the holes of the phone --

-- sucked INTO his scream and swallowed by DARKNESS.
```

This is not accurate, and the movie's liquid metal depiction is amazingly more 'otherworld'.

```
INT.  POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN'S BODY

floating in a womb-red amnion.

His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.

Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure
his face.  Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs and
cover his genitals.
```

What a vivid hell! It is Gigeresque. I am pulled into this world, rapt attention. It is forever burned into my mind. The aesthetic, the purpose, the horror...it's all there for me with surprisingly recall. Wachowskis had a vision, no doubt.

```
He is struggling desperately now.  Air bubbles into the
Jell-O but does not break the surface.

Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red
rubber cocoon.
```

This all happens far too quick, and there's so little of this scene. I think it must have been extraordinarily expensive to create. I'd love to see this movie modified and redone with the graphics we have today. Whoever is doing Westworld turned up to 11.

```
Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at
the thinning elastic shroud --

Until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he
sucks for air.  Tearing himself free, he emerges from the
cell.

It is Neo.
```

A Redpilled Neo, Ship of Theseus and Parfit need to have a word with you.
