!! About:

//I dedicate this page to [[Monster-Φ]]. In a sincerely radical way, this wiki is about the virtue of personal computing.//

[Excepting [[The Good]] and possibly Dasein,] computers are useless [by themselves].<<ref "1">> They can only give you answers.<<ref "2">>

I don't fear [all] computers. I fear the lack of [the right ones, and an excess of the wrong ones].<<ref "3">>

Don't let my demonstrations of ignorance fool you: I'm passionately devoted to computing. Computing is the essential desideratum of my vocation: philosophical inquiry. Computing is omnipresent, intimate, exquisite, fundamentally functional, and perhaps the basis of reality, if not reality itself. The more I learn about computers, the more I treasure them. It is who and what we are.<<ref "4">>

Programming a computer is about getting the computer to do what you want it to do. Traditionally, there are customary languages used to program a computer. Folks writing in an assembly instruction set, C, Python, or Brainfuck are certainly programming in the ordinary (and quite difficult) sense. There are, however, other kinds of //inputs// and //computers// though, and thus there are other kinds of programming. For example, the person who uses their mouse to provide inputs to navigate to a website has programmed their computer in a trivial (for them) way. Computing is a rich epistemic environment and telic //techne//, and far more generalizable than many people realize.

It must be said: humans are computers.<<ref "5">> We are programmable. We have to get ourselves to do what we want ourselves to do. We need to wisely program ourselves. That is what this wiki is about, after all. This wiki is a computer ran by and for many layers and kinds of computers, including myself and whomever else reads it.<<ref "6">> That may sound odd to some. Admittedly, I can't point to anything that doesn't count as computing. I am convinced everything which is intelligible is by definition computable, all else is transcendent.<<ref "7">> Thus, we should become the best, well-rounded programmers (including self-programming) we can be.<<ref "8">>

With that said, I have decided to narrow the focus of this page to the customary sense of silicon-based computing. It has slowly evolved to be that, and the wiki has taken on the other meaning. Thus, here I talk about my favorite hobby, my discipline mistress, (common denotive) computing.

!! Principles:

* Does it have to do with silicon computing? Either put it here or keep a copy/link here.
* This should eventually be useful a knowledge and tool base for your children.
* Build things you care about, and make your life easier and better with your technology.

<<footnotes "1" "Instrumentally valuable to whom and for what? Multi-paradoxically and solely based on axiomatic Differentiationist faith, only Dasein (or whomever we cherry-pick) can provide, compute, and imbue anything with instrumental and intrinsic value through the infinigress of nested implementations of reflective equilibriums of the Categorical Imperative. i.e. We are always trying to find better ways to re-compute the CI. It is the metamodern answer to the problem of autonomy/freedom/reason.">>

<<footnotes "2" "That is to say, computers take inputs and produce outputs. Consequence (output), Virtue (process), and Groundwork (input) are the fundamentals of moral computation.">>

<<footnotes "3" "We are computers using computers. Tools are double-edged swords. There is a face of computing we must fear.">>

<<footnotes "4" "Aristotle and Spinoza's Gods know what it do.">>

<<footnotes "5" "As an autistic person, I love computers because I think of them as exceptional minds (however imprisoned they may be), beautifully principled mechanicisms that make sense to me. I can more effectively develop accurate theories of mind of computers than I can humans, but that's because humans are far more complex computers than I had possibly imagined (to the point that I refused to believe humans were computers for a long time).">>

<<footnotes "5" "Before I had any real concept of what this wiki was, I made this page. This page is one of the original pages on this wiki. It was created somewhere between December 11-15th, 2016, before I started keeping daily snapshots. For a time, this wiki-page was for all things computing, mechanical or abstract, human or silicon, and otherwise. I am indebted to myself for taking the time to think of myself as a computer in this space. I deliberately forced myself to be open in scope, to go with the flow, to be organic, and to hope 'a rhyme, reason, and method to the madness will emerge.' It allowed this wiki to flourish. Good job, self.">>

<<footnotes "6" "Of course, many will worry that I broaden the meaning of computing to a point of absurdity, where the word itself no longer retains particularistic enough meaning that we can usefully wield it. I don't know what to say to you besides, look and try to see it again.">>

<<footnotes "7" "This very inclusive definition of programming reminds me of one of my most inclusive definitions of the concept of philosophy I've encountered. Because I can't put my finger on it for you (my intuitions won't translate nicely to yours), I'm left saying something unfortunately nebulous: it is quite practical for being so theoretic.">>

<<footnotes "8" "Unfortunately, when I think about it, I feel like almost every log on this wiki belongs here. Hell, the entire wiki belongs in here. I can crosslink, but I don't see the point.">>
