title: 2019.10.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Clusterfucky

* Woke at 8:30
** Not enough sleep, but you will live. I like the time.
* Meditation
* Kitchen
* Offspring on task
* Dialectures
* Read+Write
* Dialectures
* Work
** Flood in our bathroom. My offspring handled it, although they didn't call the office (my fault).
* Cleaned the bathroom and hallway.
** Gonna need a repairman for this. There's a broken seal from the hose.
* Walked with wife
** She is messed up today. She's so stressed and angry.
** Wants me to look over her work up to the prophets in the OT because she isn't satisfied. I am surprised. I have strong opinions, of course, but I'm no match for her in this part.
** Short stories she's reading are completely fucked up. Even the summaries turn my stomach inside and out.
** She's got a thousand projects running. White-knuckle she has.
** She wants to finish 200 books this year. 
*** I am, of course, retarded.
** She's hungry, and I think she's pissed I didn't go shopping, and she hates how things are falling apart in the apartment (and costing us money). 
*** Some books got destroyed, and to lose anything in her collection is like anyone fucking with my [[monster]]: immediate death sentence.
** I need to find a way to give her space, spoons, and sleep. 
*** I can prep for her tomorrow!
* Read+Write
* Spaghetti Squash (noice), Brussel Sprouts, Eggs, Toast
** Offspring said they enjoyed the meal a lot. Squash hit the spot.
* Prepped wife's lunch.
* WoW
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 1:45
** You can do it!
