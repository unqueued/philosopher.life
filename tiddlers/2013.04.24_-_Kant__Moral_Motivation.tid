title: 2013.04.24 - Kant: Moral Motivation

 Why must the moral law determine the will “immediately?”1 This time requirement seems odd. What exactly does immediacy have to do with our incentive? I suppose this immediacy requirement prevents the determination via the wrong sorts of forces (inclinations, etc.).

I really don’t fully understand what Kant means by moral feeling (hell, I’m not sure what I mean by it).2 Naively, it seems like a moral feeling is, at least in part, some special sort of joy/ pleasure or sorrow/pain one experiences because we are aware of selecting an action in or not accordance with (and perhaps even in or not virtue of, motivationally speaking) the moral law. I’d almost want to call it a rational kind of feeling (whatever that means), as this moral feeling seems highly connected to some kind of rational respect for the moral law. In some ways, it really isn’t very analogous to other kinds of ordinary feelings. It isn’t like sadness or anger, and it is not the warm-fuzzy feeling (a selfish kind of feeling if you ask me) one might get when doing something nice for someone else. Presumably, it is deeper than that (I’m doing a terrible job here, but I hope you understand what I’m getting at). One hopes the source of this moral feeling is somehow different than our other ordinary, fleeting, capricious feelings. We should be worried whether or not moral feelings should play any sort of role in motivating us to be moral (and why, how, and to what extent, etc.). I hope we flesh this out in class. Perhaps we could dissect and outline the sad philanthropist example regarding this topic.

Kant explains, “Therefore respect for the moral law must be regarded as also a positive though indirect effect of the moral law on feeling insofar as the law weakens the hindering influence of the inclinations by humiliating self-conceit.”3 This is fascinating approach, and I have seen it elsewhere. This is very similar to an argument virtue ethicists give us. It goes something like this: the virtuous agent has the ability to quell or suppress the inclinations, feelings, etc. which are not appropriate to the morally salient aspects of particular circumstances. The virtuous agent has the right sorts of feelings, inclinations, or whatever to subdue or negate those influences within herself which might hinder being moral.

This isn’t for class, but if you have any direction to give me for reading: I’d like to see an analysis of how theology influenced his work.4 The examination of divine will has a storied past, and it would be interesting to see Kant’s particular background on the matter. For a time, German theologians were the most influential in the world.
