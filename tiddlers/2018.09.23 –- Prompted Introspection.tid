!! What's your favorite place to escape from life temporarily? A park? A mall?

I keep running into questions I've had answers to before, [[2017.12.25 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Escape]]. This is exciting. 

Unfortunately, this reminds me that I'm yet another step closer to needing to bring out this sledgehammer. This substance is very hard to use for me. There are fascinating parts, but it is SO much work.

Alright, so my favorite place to escape is probably into...vidya games. I can get lost in the right game for years. It's "temporary," but barely, lol.
