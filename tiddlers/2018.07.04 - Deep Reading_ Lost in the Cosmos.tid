I am supremely enjoying Percy's walk through semiotics. I hear many philosophers screaming out of the pages through what feels like a "communications" major's mouthpiece. I have not found any egregious errors, although there are clearly places we have to look deeply. 

This part of the book seems like a naive, non-technical walk through phenomenology and language use. One of my philosophy of religion professors was in this sphere of southern gothic religious literature, and I'm used to this style of argumentation.
