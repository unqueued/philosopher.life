* [[Firefox Extension Collection]]
** I'm trying to migrate again. I've failed many times, but I will keep trying until I succeed.
* [[Web Traffic Obfuscation]]
** This needs a lot of work. The idea is important though.
* [[2018.03.03 - Computer Musings: Android]]
** Turned into a project that I transcluded in. That's not the first time I've done that in this log.
* [[Outopos: Topologies]]
** I clearly have no idea what I'm doing.
* [[2018.03.03 - Link Log: Take Out The Trash]]
** I love when my //Think About It// section has a lot to say.
* [[2018.03.03 - Prompted Introspection Log: Bad Honesty]]
** Edited.
* [[2018.03.03 - Wiki Review Log: Bumbler]]
** Um...Why didn't I complete this?
** Completed!
** I think it's funny that I have chain-reviewed. I suppose, in part, that's why I review, eh?
* [[2018.03.03 - Carpe Diem Log: School Cleanup]]
** Completed.
* [[2018.03.03 - Daily To-Do-List Log: Zlam Relax]]
** Wasn't very strong. I think I have to try monthly to consider tolerance. My mind/brain may also be fairly resistant to its effects.
* [[2018.03.03 - Deep Reading Log: Witches Abroad]]
** Great story. =)
