Hello, old friend!

I used to read this every year. I'd like to get back into the habit. I'm not sure how much I'll have to say. This looking glass which used to evolve so much has started crystallize for me.

/smh, I still can't believe how naive and illiterate I am/have been. I literally could not understand the Baron's sexual desires. I wasn't sure why he thought/felt like he did. Well, I don't know what to say; my exposure to this book predates my puberty.

Much of my redpilled social Darwinian understanding has a root that grew out the seeds of this book.

Love the tripod quote. Actually, there are just a shit ton of moments and quotes that are sealed in me. This audiobook is a good one. I've heard it before. I don't remember when.

This book is actually better at 1.7x speed. It rushes back to me. It's so fucking emotional!

This is also a book that really taught me the basics of a theory of mind, empathy in literature.

I do want to get all up in dat companion too. Despite being naive, this book was profoundly sexual to me.

The Bene Gesserit are truly terrifying in combat in all things.

One thing I'm finally learning to do is to stop trying to see myself as these character, to stop empathizing with the wealthy and aristocracy, to stop granting them, even for a moment and to some [[dok]], the possibility of any of them being good human beings, our saviors, worthy of my trust in their authority. It is wonderful not to have faith without justification.

I am very lucky to have this as a world of references to communicate with my chillun.
