title: Kant

It is my opinion that Kant was the smartest person to have ever lived: he is the best student of wisdom to have ever lived. Even the titans Plato and Aristotle did not philosophically accomplish the proportion that Kant did. He is the giant leap forward for mankind. I can offer no greater praise. 

His type: a scholar's scholar's scholar. I think it would not be doing justice to this man to call him the Archimedes, the Shakespeare, the Newton and Einstein, and the Copernicus of philosophy. Okay, I keep trying to offer better praise than being a better philosopher than Plato and Aristotle. Full stop.

Kant is the most praiseworthy of all philosophers. I am proud to have even understood what I understand of his work. Kant was a deeply virtuous man, and a man I could only aspire to be like. Kant was my hero. Hell, Kant still is my hero, even if he's wrong about a few things.

I need to complete the Kantian project for myself. I have to do what is against cannon: hybridizing Kantianism and Utilitarianism. We always seem to fail.
