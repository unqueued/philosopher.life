!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Every man is guilty of all the good he did not do.
<<<

This is so very close to the truth, but it's not correct. Every other bone in my body wants to leap out of my seat and shout: "Amen!" But, unfortunately, I cannot give this sentence a "Preach, yo!" seal of approval.<<ref "v">> The problem, of course, is one of opportunity cost. Even when you choose what is morally obligated, there is good you could have done which you do not (and I remind you that [[The Right]] is distinct from [[The Good]], but clearly related). Are you //guilty//? Insofar as guilt is fundamentally an error, in this case, an immoral one, then clearly not. The "guilty" by what standard, a [[gfwiwcgws]] problem, is generally best answered by [[The Moral Law]]. 

The conversational implicature is too ambiguous in Voltaire's claim. The best fix is to say add, "but which he ought have" or some such qualifier. This, of course, becomes a truism. There's no way around it.
