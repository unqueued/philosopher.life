title: 2018.03.01 - Wiki Audit Log: Monthly Audit

I have a lot to do today:

* [[To-Do-List Logs]]
** I'm moving to have a monthly set as well. This has been successful in many respects.
* [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum Logs]]
** I feel like I'm not celebrating as much as I'd like. I can see where I have failed too. That's important. Be compassionate too!
* [[Wiki Review Log]]
** A serious accountability log. I'm glad I do it.
* [[Prompted Introspection Log]]
** Sarcastic. Lovely.
* [[Employment]]
** Not there yet, but still wildly better than last month.
* [[/b/]]
** A surprising lack of content.
* [[Family Log]]
** I love the pulse. It's necessary.
* [[Link Log]]
** Breathtaking
* [[Computer Musings]]
** I wrote in this more than usual. I'm glad I did.
