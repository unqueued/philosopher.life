*[[Certainty]]
** Thank you for your preparation and presentation. We all felt the difference.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 5, draft 2]]
** Thank you. Keep kicking ass. Listen to what your teacher says, and do your best to practice correctly. 
*** This gets easier with practice! This gets better with practice! This gets more fun and interesting with practice! 
*[[2020.04.08 – Wiki Review: Pope Francis Bacon]]
** Stop comparing your work so much to mine. Compare yourselves to yourselves. 
*** For the record, look in the //Vault//:([[Wiki Review]]) and you'll see plenty of my [[review]]s are garbage. And, note, I am significantly older and more practiced than you (and they should be wildly better to some [[dok]] for that reason). Just do your best.
** I am honored that you take the time to stand up against me, sir. It is extremely unfun and even dangerous sometimes. 
*[[2020.04.08 – Prompted Introspection: Potato on paper]]
** Roflmao. Yet another copy of that shitrag.
** A thank you letter to whom and for what?
** Your list is hilarious, creative, and I adore your answer.
*** Do you like your answer?
*** I'd love to know //why// you chose these further than you describe.
*[[2020.04.08 – TDL: Certainty X1]]
** What work?
** What do you mean by [[TTP]] on your [[TDL]]?
*[[2020.04.08 – h0p3ful Review: Inspiration]]
** I'm excited that you want to do the engineering course for high schoolers. 
*** If you destroyed their tests, I bet you could even just do the private school here geared for it. Up to you.
*[[2020.04.08 – Carpe Diem: B&D]]
** Why not link to [[Certainty]] and [[The Lightning Thief: 5, draft 2]]?
** MUC*
*** I'd like to see you actually tell any story here. You've captured almost nothing. 
** This is still fairly light, but I'm happy to see progress.
*[[2020.04.08 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Darwin]]
** This is incomplete.
** "thing they could be" - what do you mean?
** What is the usual way?
** The argument appears between incoherent and underdeveloped to me.
** You are aiming not only for validity but soundness with a crisp rhetorical style. Make it easy on your reader to interpret and verify. 
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Look at your progress, sir. I'm going to keep point it out. It's delightful.
