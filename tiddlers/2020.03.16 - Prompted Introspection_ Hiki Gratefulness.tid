title: 2020.03.16 - Prompted Introspection: Hiki Gratefulness

!! What is one thing that I am grateful for today?

I'm grateful that my offspring and I have a lot of fun things we enjoy doing together. I don't think everyone is cut out for quarantine and our hiki-lifestyle (and wiki-lyfe), but it's great that we click together so well. I do not think most fathers get to connect with their offspring like this.
