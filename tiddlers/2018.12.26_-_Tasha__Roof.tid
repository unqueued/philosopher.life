Good morning neighbor! I’m sure you guys are appreciating the roof work just as much as we are:upside_down_face:

The day after Christmas no warning :warning: we were startled out of bed:flushed:
DEC 26, 2018 8:50 AM

Not to negative but I’m pretty livid

DEC 26, 2018 8:52 AM
Oh and our cars are blocked and I hope if anything you don’t plan on running to the store
DEC 26, 2018 8:52 AM
:joy::joy:I can’t believe they are serious
DEC 26, 2018 8:52 AM
Do they intend for us not to walk outside?
DEC 26, 2018 8:53 AM
I don’t think so just like they didn’t intend four us to be sleeping the day after Christmas at 830am
DEC 26, 2018 8:54 AM
Lol! Merry Christmas!

I’m sorry I’m just lost as a ball in high weeds that this is happening I thought someone was breaking in
DEC 26, 2018 8:57 AM
Ah, yeah, lol.
DEC 26, 2018 8:58 AM
Then I thought Matthew was having a seizure :pensive:
DEC 26, 2018 8:58 AM
I thought the kids were being really loud.
DEC 26, 2018 8:58 AM
:joy:
DEC 26, 2018 8:59 AM
How’s it going over there -
DEC 26, 2018 2:03 PM
It seems this is going to be an all day event :pensive:
DEC 26, 2018 2:04 PM
I have a giant headache. I am grateful to have roof and soon to be a new roof. The noise is killing me.
DEC 26, 2018 4:32 PM
Yea I can’t imagine it has not been okay I called and went down to the office. All they seem to do is apologize
DEC 26, 2018 4:40 PM
Yeah. They don't give a shit, lol.
DEC 26, 2018 4:48 PM
They get paid to say "OHHHH.....we're SOOO sorry about that." lol
DEC 26, 2018 4:48 PM
It would have been nice to have had a headsup
DEC 26, 2018 4:48 PM
Pretty much
DEC 26, 2018 4:48 PM
Yes
DEC 26, 2018 4:48 PM
Yall hanging in there today?
DEC 26, 2018 4:48 PM
I might have told them a little white lie but it was to get the point across
DEC 26, 2018 4:49 PM
We were til about 2
DEC 26, 2018 4:49 PM
Your dogs doing okay? Our cats are hating this.
DEC 26, 2018 4:50 PM
Oh no we had to take them out so they could see where it was coming from they had high Exide he and tell we thought of that
DEC 26, 2018 4:51 PM
My brother and his SO are coming tomorrow. They are going to be annoyed too, lol.
DEC 26, 2018 4:52 PM
I hope they finish this shit before then or don't work on the weekend.
DEC 26, 2018 4:53 PM
anxiety*
DEC 26, 2018 4:53 PM
yeah
DEC 26, 2018 4:53 PM
Yeah that’s what I told him today that we had company coming over for Christmas and had to cancel because it was too chaotic
DEC 26, 2018 4:53 PM
And we had Forewarnings
DEC 26, 2018 4:53 PM
Them*
DEC 26, 2018 4:53 PM
Sorry driving using auto text
DEC 26, 2018 4:53 PM
I can’t believe they are still here
DEC 26, 2018 5:22 PM
We just got home
DEC 26, 2018 5:22 PM
The silence is deafening. Love it. Did the office tell you how long they thought this would take?
DEC 26, 2018 6:18 PM
No
DEC 26, 2018 6:22 PM
Sorry I was so short earlier I am at work and had the girls bouncing around me
DEC 26, 2018 10:24 PM
It's no problem. My assumption is that you have good reasons for when and how you do things. That makes perfect sense to me. In this case, I'm appreciative you even had the chance to answer at all (I'm not so talented at multi-tasking in many cases).
DEC 26, 2018 10:26 PM
:joy: me either definitely depends on what I’m doing! And watching a 3 yr old and a 1 yr old is definitely a multi- task in itself
DEC 26, 2018 10:27 PM
Quick question for you also
DEC 26, 2018 10:27 PM
shoot
DEC 26, 2018 10:28 PM
Este and I have a quick trip in January- not that Matthew needs a Babysiter but I was wondering if you guys are home the weekend we go if you wouldn’t mind checking in on him and making sure he is ok Jan 25-28th
DEC 26, 2018 10:29 PM
Yeah, that'd be fine. Please remind me again in advance (because even though I have it written down, I can be absentminded). Happy to check in with him and give him some human contact. He need dinner or anything as well?
DEC 26, 2018 10:31 PM
Umm he shouldn’t I will definitely make sure he is full stocked! We have that deep freezer full of chicken hamburgers pizzas pop corn chicken etc.. but I’m sure if you wanted he won’t mind and I leave him money as well so he can Lyft or go with you guys to eat or do anything
DEC 26, 2018 10:33 PM
Fully *
DEC 26, 2018 10:33 PM
Cool beans.
DEC 26, 2018 10:34 PM
Awesome I will definitely remind you once we get closer
DEC 26, 2018 10:42 PM
Thank you for considering it
