!! Audit:

* I have been picking up more things around the house. I'm glad I do. It has made everything saner.
* NCCER dropped off the map this month.
* D2 oscillated.
* Mathematics has dominated the month.
* Despite the bluelight, sleeping in my own bed to my laptop w/earbuds has helped quell my thoughts and help me slip into sleep.
* It is clear to me that I annoy K, speaking to him. Perhaps I should call less.
* I need to eat healthier. We ate a lot of dessert.
* My morning and sleeping routines aren't down pat.
* We watch a lot of TV in the evening
* I did a lot of cleaning this month.
* I drink often when I don't take cannabliss
* I still feel quite productive without cannabliss, but there is still a noticeable difference
* I'm glad to be waking up at predictable times and that I'm waking the kids up to start their days.
* Perhaps I should record walking with my wife more. I didn't record all the {tried calling, talked} either.
** I love walking with my wife.
* I've been filling out Carpe Diem each day and the next day, and moreso the next day as the month went on.
* I think ALM and I might be done. It seems like it. His call, of course.
* I ate my wife's baklava.
* I wish I had a much better/automated way of keeping track of these stats, finding patterns and trends, etc.

Stats:

* Fireman Time = 28
* Inform the Men = 5
** HJ = 1
** Inform the Jabba = 4
* Cannabliss = 14
* {tried calling, talked}
** JRE{4,9}
** AIR{2,3}
** Charlie{2,3}
** C{,1}
** R{,1}
** L{1,2}
** K{,2}
** MB{1,1} 

* I'm glad I've made conscious efforts to reach out to people. I will continue to do so.
* Cannabliss usage was 1 higher than last month.
* Fireman Time was down by 8!, however, I had sexual contact with my wife 10 times instead of 8. Once every 3 days is outstanding!
* Good month, eh? Well-seized!
