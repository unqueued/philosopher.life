title: Self Dialectic

There is a perhaps neverending rotations between the slave and master, [[FO]] and [[SO]] versions of ourselves. Two or more non-conscious computer networks/modules inside us memetically and biologically competing and cooperating. We have to bring out the best in this dialectic, and we should do so computationally. It's all feedback loops.
