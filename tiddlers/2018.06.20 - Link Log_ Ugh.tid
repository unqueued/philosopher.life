** https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-shifting-connections-from-education.html
*** Ah, and when you think college is about training a workforce instead of habituating virtue in humanity (creating good political animals, philosophers), you've already lost. Typical economist. Yeah, you point out that employers are trying to externalize their costs, you point to popular opinion, and completely miss the fucking point of WHY schooling should not be tied to commerce. Don't you see? No, you are purposely ignorant. Malicious!
