one comment on the setup...

"If lots of people wanted to see the site..."

Turn it around ...

Do you? "Want a lot of people to see the site?"

Just a side comment.

This is a question that has weighed heavily on me since the beginning of the wiki.<<ref "1">> This is the kind of writing which I used steganography and cryptography to hide from everyone except myself. It has been difficult to open up.

I am desperately worried about political privacy, but I'm not convinced I have a moral right to it in my context. So, your question is an interesting one. What do you think about it?

I do want others to read it, of course. I could privatize it further just for family and friends (although, this is still the most convenient method for them). Problematically, I think allowing it to be public is the only efficient method to [[Find The Others]]. I'm forced to rely upon allowing strangers to read it somewhat conveniently from a technological perspective; that vulnerability is likely a requirement of my axiom. 

There are many kinds of people I believe it would be better if they never see this wiki because it wouldn't be constructive or useful. I also think it would be a bad thing for most people to look at it. I do not hope for wildfire, instead, I currently hope to cast a net with very large holes in it to connect to not just strangers, but the right strangers. 

It is incredibly unsafe to lose my privacy to this degree, but radical transparency is the practical price I must pay for radical moral integrity. Until I can reasonably convince myself otherwise, I'm morally obligated to continue to develop myself in the open. No pain, no gain.

I also don't want to be accused of building a site merely for virtue signaling to others. This really is addressed to me (and my children). I should try to put my time and money where my mouth is. 

Optimizing this site on that particular side of technical things is pre-optimizing in my eyes. The ability for others to access the wiki is sufficiently functional for my usecase. One day, that may change. I'm looking further into it. I may actually move away from Tiddlywiki if I really felt that serving it, in the end, should be piece by piece instead of as a self-contained unit.
