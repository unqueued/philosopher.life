title: 2017.12.06 - Wiki Audit Log: Vault

!! SO:

* I've completed my 1-Depth audit of {[[Focus]]}, and so now I move onto {[[Vault]]}.
* I keep adding to [[Wiki: Unique Syntactic Mechanics]]. I clearly have much to capture.
* Lots of new pages today.

!! FO:

* {[[Vault]]}
** Pushed narrative of //principles// subsection into //about//. It's clear that I want to be more quantitative in my principles.
* [[Art of Living]]
** Filled with more bullshit. I really have no idea what to say. But, it's okay that I don't feel qualified to write the section. It's okay to say it is one of my goals and that I don't have the answers. I'm just doing my best.
* [[Know Thyself]]
** It is weird how the article's narratival work is literally in its //Focus// subsection. That's got to be a mistake. Focus is for research.
** Fuck it, I don't think this is a directory. I'm going to undirectorify it.
** Re-writing it. Took quite a bit of work to get it into shape, but it is much better.
* [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]]
** Re-worked it. It's much cleaner now. I was trying to explain it to my brother, and I failed. He didn't seem to get it. Now I have been as clear as I think I will be able to get (at least for now).
