How's life going?
MAR 30 1:03 AM
Life us going busily. I've been staying with a friend this weekend. She had a ruptured cyst and didnt want to be by herself while her husband was out of town. So I've been with her just helping out while shes on bed rest.
MON 11:11 PM
How has life been going for yall?
MON 11:11 PM
That is really kind of you. You are often traveling to help your friends and family. I admire it.
TUE 8:41 AM
Life is feeling increasingly routinized. I cannot complain; it's nice to have it.
TUE 8:41 AM
Kids and I continue to Read+Write. They are growing up fast.
TUE 8:42 AM
How's Adam doing?
TUE 8:50 AM
Thank you. I appreciate that. I didnt realize how much of this last year had involved me going to other places, but yeah I guess that's been my job essentially, haha.

Routine is so comforting. I've enjoyed the spontenaety of the last several months but I'm hoping to get a little more routine after Easter. 

What are some project the kids are working on recently that you've liked helping them with, or watching them do?

Adam the same, busy but with things he loves. Hes got a new jump band which makes him happy. Festival season has started so hes reeeeeeeeeeeally neck deep in work. I'm hoping he can arrange a lighter schedule for himself soon. I worry about burnout sometimes.
TUE 9:13 AM
Aye. Perhaps that is your vocation/occupation, at least for now. You are a floater that flexibly fills in the necessary gaps for others.
TUE 9:27 AM
I hope you find the routine that suits you too.
TUE 9:28 AM
I have a hard time imagining Adam burning out on his passion, but I can see him getting tired during the season.
TUE 9:30 AM
They keep their wikis here: http://j3d1h.philosopher.life/
TUE 9:30 AM
http://1uxb0x.philosopher.life/
TUE 9:31 AM
They do not write in them as I'd prefer, but they are working on it.
TUE 9:31 AM
[[1uxb0x]] finished //Dune//, and I think [[j3d1h]] is finishing up //The Chosen//
TUE 9:31 AM
Like pulling teeth to get them to read and write.
TUE 9:32 AM
[[1uxb0x]] is going back to clean up his math with a second pass, [[j3d1h]] is working on number theory.
TUE 9:32 AM
[[j3d1h]] has been doing a ton of architect work on my wiki and our infrastructure. She is now the system admin and primarily developer.
TUE 9:33 AM
They cook a couple meals a week for us.
TUE 9:33 AM
Their history is going well. Training up my little Marxists with all the weapons I can find.
TUE 9:33 AM
[[1uxb0x]] has been learning python, tiddlywiki code, and configuring his operating system.
TUE 9:35 AM
[[1uxb0x]] has probably made the most progress. He has a lot more emotional control.
TUE 9:35 AM
[[j3d1h]] had a boyfriend.
TUE 9:35 AM
I'm so proud of the kids and all their progress and accomplishments. Km always so excited to get updates and hear what new and incredible things they're doing. What you and [[k0sh3k]] do with the kids has really made me commit to wanting to homeschool when we become parents. 

A boyfriend! Shes so grown up. Have yall met him?
TUE 9:41 AM
We did. They broke up. It was a fascinating moment.
TUE 9:42 AM
well, not moment, but time period
TUE 9:42 AM
I misread had as has. Didnt realize the past tense at first. Where did she meet him?
TUE 9:52 AM
In a roleplaying group online
TUE 9:52 AM
He's also homeschooled
TUE 9:53 AM
I'm of little use to my children on this front. I have been on dates and I didn't know I was on a date.
TUE 9:54 AM
I am blind as a bat.
TUE 9:54 AM
Hahaha, I dont anticipate being much use to my children either. I only had one boyfriend. We didnt even ask each other out, his cousin just said we were and that was that. Dated him for 3 years and didnt even like him. I was too polite to break up with him. He was long distance so it barely counted as dating. And then after that I never dated til college and then married the guy I met at 19. I was too efficient to garner much sage advice to give.
TUE 10:09 AM
Lol
TUE 1:11 PM
Married at 19 as well. Lol. I didn't know you polited dated someone for 3 years.
