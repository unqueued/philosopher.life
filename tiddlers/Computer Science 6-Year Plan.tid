I've taken you under my wing, and now it is time to teach you to fly and have you soar. Your brother has selected literature, which means your mother will be doing the same for him. This is the skill I'm going to teach you and push you to pursue for the next 6-years. I'm going to gameplan for you. I can't do it for myself, but I can do it for you.
