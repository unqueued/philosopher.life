title: 2018.02.07 - Prompted Introspection Log: Rule Following Goodness

!! Why do you think the rules you must follow are good or bad?

What rules in what context in what mode of "must" given what definitions of good/bad? Lawyered.<<ref "2020.02.07">>

Profoundly Oversimplified Matrix (because I know you can barely read, Samwise):

* If I believe it's morally right and produces moral good both in general and for myself: 
** Awesome, let's do it!
* If I believe it's morally right and produces moral good for others but bad for myself: 
** Sucks to be me; I guess I still have to do it because it's morally right.
* If I believe it's morally right and produces moral bad in general but good for myself: 
** Sucks to be you; I'm sorry, but it's morally right.
* If I believe it's morally right and produces moral bad both in general and for myself: 
** Fuck! I wish I didn't have to do this, but it's morally right.

Notice the symmetry:

* If I believe it's morally wrong and produces moral good both in general and for myself: 
** Fuck! I wish I could do this. 
* If I believe it's morally wrong and produces moral good for others but bad for myself: 
** Lucky for me; I'm glad I don't have to do it because it's morally wrong.
* If I believe it's morally wrong and produces moral bad in general but good for myself: 
** Lucky for you; I guess I can't do it because it's morally wrong.
* If I believe it's morally wrong and produces moral bad both in general and for myself: 
** Awesome, let's //not// do it!  I'm so happy it is morally wrong.
