title: 2017.12.23 -- Computer Musings: KDE

KDE is functionally gorgeous. It has improved dramatically. It is without a doubt my favorite desktop environment. 

Tried KDE Connect. Very interesting. Will keep it up.

Setup Samba to share with the Chromebook. Setup Kodi. Flickers, but can't stop the behavior. Doesn't matter on playback though, which is fine.

Tried Telepathy. XMPP configuration isn't functional. It looks pretty, but it doesn't work. I'll stick to using a tool designed for it. I'm sad, since it looks like it could have wonderful integration. 

Tried a KDE/Dolphin Dropbox addon. Meh. Also, it messed up my Recent in Dolphin. Cleaned that up.

Tried bcompare for KDE. Bcompare works, but I don't see the integration.

Tried out i3 wm for KDE.
