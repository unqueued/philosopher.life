Shadowboxing with Evil Twins

Let’s tackle a question of the existential “what am I doing with my life?”
<<<

Even if I disagree with the book, it is clear that we're playing in the big leagues together. He's too intelligent for me to not at least think about.

<<<
Your personality can be understood as comprising two parts: a self and a [[Jungian]] shadow. The self represents the parts of yourself that you accept, and are attached to [and see as strengths]...The shadow represents the [subconscious or unconscious] parts of yourself that you reject as weaknesses, and have developed an aversion to...You can generally only see your shadow by projecting it onto external realities. Especially other people. These people are, at a first approximation, the ones who feel like your evil twins: what is in your shadow is in their conscious self, and vice-versa. Your shadow persona manifests itself in your own behavior only under conditions of either extreme stress, or extreme relaxation.
<<<

This is an interesting notion. I'm not sure how accurate it is.<<ref "2019.03.23-1">> I will say this though, I am strongly convinced that I am shadow-boxing with myself. I make it incredibly explicit in {[[About]]}. 

<<<
So to truly explore your shadow, yes, you need to tiptoe into behavioral territories that feel slightly evil to you . This is dangerous business.
<<<

Preachin' to the choir, homie. That is exactly what I'm doing in the dialectic between [[RPIN]] and [[ehyeh]].

He suggests that I spar with live shadows, people similar to my shadow. That may be my brother. There are few who are my shadow and would engage it. It's a pretty lonely world, I think. I can do it through books, of course.

<<<
if you want to develop a more nuanced understanding of the Hobbes/Rousseau tragic/idealist dichotomy, I recommend two key texts: the show Deadwood, which was written specifically to tell a Hobbesian story, and The Dark Knight, which was written to capture a Rousseauish story. In the latter, despite the Joker’s best efforts to prove a Hobbesian theory of humanness, a Rousseauish outcome is achieved. You could also read Hobbes and Rousseau in the original of course (personally, I’ve only read second-hand summaries and sampled the originals).
<<<

I can tell. Also, Hobbes was a genius. And, it's very clear to me that Deadwood paints a far more accurate picture than The Dark Knight. I very much wanted to like The Dark Knight (I grew up on Batman, even when it wasn't cool), and while it attempted to do the right socialist work, it ultimately failed. My disappointment was no accident.

I will say that Hobbes' notion of autonomy is not accurate, or at least, I hope it isn't. However, much of his description is dead on. We can only hope to be more. It's very hard to find a justified explanation of how to be better than a neo-Hobbesian, redpilled description. I'm looking for the prescription, believe me. I am not convinced there are many humans doing the work I am trying to do here, and that's not an accident.

<<<
There are four status patterns: feeling low, playing low (LL), feeling low, playing high (LH), feeling high, playing low (HL), feeling high, playing high (HH). If the root cause of the fixedness is intrinsic and psychological, the same stable pattern will appear in all situations. This is absolute fixedness: you adopt the same pattern towards all. If the root cause is extrinsic and social-psychological, you will use a different pattern based on perceived relative status, which is the difference between the perceived status of the other, and your felt status.
<<<

It's hard for me to gauge where I fit. It depends on the context. I do have particular modes though. His prescription is to not be locked into status modes.

<<<
This is one reason I don’t consider Denzel Washington a good actor: he never seems to play convincing low-status roles.
<<<

This dude fucks. And Keanu Reeves, Will Smith, Kevin Spacey, et al. are part of that list too!

<<<
When two status-vacuum people meet, they typically recognize each other and abandon status-based manipulation altogether and spar with other weapons.
<<<

Ah, when two low-empathy people meet...

<<<
There is a subtle failure mode here: if you break locked patterns in predictable ways, you simply lock in new patterns. I knew a guy who figured all this stuff out, but then got hooked on “pushing buttons” and enjoying the reactions. That reinforced a “felt high” pattern rather than shriveling felt status to a vacuum. He could be manipulated by hooking his button-pushing instincts. The best way to break patterns in random ways is simply to play situations in ways that suit your situational objectives.
<<<

There is a true freedom to being released of the bonds of approval-seeking. But, even if you could abandon seeking your own approval, would you want to? This is 5th level Positive Disintegration kind of work. Sounds like French existentialism to me.

<<<
Being a status-player is also not an easy thing to hide in the long term, so you will be known for what you are, by people you interact with a lot. The best way to manage this perception is to openly acknowledge it and make sure your underlying values are understood and accepted by others. If you don’t make that clear, you’ll end up being viewed as an opportunistic, two-faced politician, and that perception is highly dangerous. Project your values clearly, and you’ll come across as “worldly wise,” a much safer perception.
<<<

i.e. Tell people you are dark-triadic. Classic.

I'm not sure what parts of my true colors I can viably show.<<ref "2019.03.23-2">> As my brother has pointed out, this wiki is anathema to most people. They literally hate who I am; they are afraid of it; they would never dream of even attempting to empathize with it. Being autistic makes it so that I have a hard time playing the game Rao speaks of, imho. I must play far more defensively.
