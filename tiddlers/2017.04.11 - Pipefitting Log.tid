title: 2017.04.11 - Pipefitting Log

Today was a fine day. When I arrived, I immediately started studying for my exam. I took the study room and did some grinding. Procedure:

I read the whole chapter, not just what we're being tested on. I then comb through the sections I will be tested on, highlighting. I then re-read the sections and make sure I agree with my highlights. I then cram. This is not the way I prefer to study for tests (I prefer more holistic, longer-lasting, systematic, and organic study methods [in a way, it defeats the purpose to study for the test]), but I can pass the memory tests just fine. The real critical reasoning happens on the field, in learning the art of the thing. 

I took the test after the first break. Easy enough. Umm...congratulations to me for being 4 months ahead in bookwork. We're going to keep pushing hard. I want to complete all 4 years worth of reading by the end of the second trimester if I can (or whenever). Basically, I want to make sure I have my complete NCCER certifications in case the union falls through (minimize my attack surface; trust fewer people). It will help me get my foot in the door for any plan B I may be unfortunate enough to need to take. 

My teacher and I talked during the test, which is interesting. I'm not sure what that means. I take it that my teacher assumes I'll just pass and don't need to concentrate. He was right though, I didn't for this exam. When I study to pass, I don't struggle (perhaps that will change as the content becomes harder and harder).

It may be a good idea to re-read these books before the interview for the Union. I want to sound like I know what I'm talking about, at least theoretically. Giving someone the representations of what I'm thinking of is often such a strong signal that even if I've never done it, they are convinced that I //can// do it or figure out the rest of how to do it. 

During the exam, I talked about what happened with the dryer. After the exam, my teacher took me to the electrician's shop to speak with the instructor.<<ref "1">> Everything I said made sense to him, and he suggested that I don't try to do this one alone (ugh, I am really bad this. I'm lucky to have people who know what they are doing around me.). He offered to come visit my house and help me after I said I couldn't bring it in (I desperately need a work vehicle). I don't know if he was falsely offering this politely or not. The caveat is that he would take a week to be able to do it. I take that to be a sign that he is trying to run out the clock and make it so that I just pay a professional. I'll take him at his word until the end of the week. That's okay though. I'm taking him up on his offer, lol! I'll see if I can do it without him as well. Might as well. I'd love to do this by hand. If I can't, we'll replace it.

Oh, we also talked about the go-kart he had in a truck (I think he owns multiple vehicles). He bought the chassis for $20. Like, whoa. He grabbed a new motor for $100, and he's bought some new wheels and something else that makes is safer for more weight. He's putting it together this weekend. If I had the time, I'd have asked him if I could help put it together. Was he signaling to me about this? I don't know. I'm too socially inept to understand what this man is really thinking or saying in a conversation sometimes. I am terrible at developing theory's of his mind.<<ref "2">>

It would be good to get to know this man. It would be amazing if I could take [[1uxb0x]] and perhaps even [[j3d1h]] (depending on whether or not I felt it would generate unhealthy competition between my children) to learn from this man. Even if they can't benefit from his directly, even indirectly would be possibly profound. He has a more severely autistic man in his class (I wish I could connect with the guy; it would be useful simply to make sure that I can help my son as best as I can [you need the practice!]). It would be quite useful to my son to learn this, to develop a relationship. I should give this man a present for helping me. Cookies and probably something else. The relationship may actually matter to me in a prudential way (for my chill'uns). 

Afterward, I went to work with my new partner Ferguson. This is my first time working with him as an equal partner and from the beginning of a project. He has already made the fabrication we're fabricating. He knew what it looked like, and I saw how he understands the objects to be fabricated in his head. He thinks of it in terms of vertical levels. His horizontal reasoning didn't seem as strong (although still quite good), but his vertical explanation was spot on. I will pry him for more information since maybe he has tricks to understand. He's a man that understands tricks. That is a special eye to have for the world. Sometimes it is a kind of principled, rule-of-thumb, virtue-theoretic, pragmatic, and contrarian approach to problems.

I outlined the parts (which can be deduced for the most part, and guesstimated for pipes) we needed, and he got the pipe for it (Also, he did a good job picking out pipe of the right lengths [I think he may have memorized important information, but he thought that knowing the total length was useful to him for finding pieces? I see it for a single piece of pipe, but not for our project]). I helped him acquire the rest. I did the math, and he double-checked my math at my request. Okay, I think he can do the math. I'm still not sure. He understood so much of the drawing that I have a hard time believing he can't do the math. The benefit of the doubt! Right?

I did all the external and internal grind work on the fitting and flanges. He wasn't trying very hard though. I suppose he has no reason. He has always been very slow in the class. It takes him a week to build anything.

He is slow and terrible at measuring and cutting pipe. He does too much "eye-balling" and not enough careful, exacting measurement and marking. I do not understand how he is this bad. I basically did everything except the cutting of the pipe, and he still couldn't get that right. He had to recut two different pieces, and 3 of them were 1/16th too short (which I let slide, even though I kindly asked him to start cutting just a hair longer than he was on the machine). He even cut one pipe too short by almost an entire inch. He went on to confabulate how the 1/16th to 1/8th additional space we would need for socket weld fitting would make up for this. That's fucking retarded in so many ways, I don't know where to begin. This is what I told him: it is already accounted for in the takeouts section of our pipefitter's bible (which is true). Getting the lengths spot on is important, especially as these grow more complex. He literally doesn't care about crucial details on his job, even though he cares about the details for so many other things. That is some executive functioning failure right there (he should know better). 

I kept asking him to cut off the ends which are damaged from welding/cutting. There's no reason to use this fraction of the pipe. He obviously didn't care. I'm going to cut the pipe from now on. I suspect I'll be doing almost all the work. That's fine though. I'm literally here to practice, practice, practice. I will be virtuous at this practice. By the end of the day, he had to leave early. He thought we got tons done (he was proud of himself, rofl). 

The kid has serious asymmetries in his intelligence (or use of it). Instead of doing it the way he is told, he tries to confabulate to his own method and then has to try 20 other tricks to fix it. It's unnecessary work, and it only adds to the frustration. Despite this, he clearly is persuadable on at least some aspects of our building. Perhaps we will mildly wrestle about how to do it.

Ferguson and I get along just fine though, even if he is sometimes retarded, and sometimes actually fairly intelligent (there is some cognitive dissonance there). That is a rare exception for my relationships with stupid people in my experience. I enjoy hearing his perspective because the way in which he makes up for his deficits can be creative. 

Fit 45's on the side (that pipe shouldn't point up or down, just horizontally)! It's the best way. My teacher said it is the best way for all 45's, even for screwpipe (but I know that isn't true: I've seen exceptions firsthand). It also allows you to level off nicely from the two pieces. 

My teacher did tell me something cool. He said to just tack the top and bottom, but not to drop the other 2 side tacks if I were going to continue running straight out on 45's (and I will be for this project). Instead, keep running it out and leveling with just the 2 top and bottom tacks. Afterward, we'll rotate it 90 degrees in the vise and level + tack from there. This is the magic I needed to hear from my teacher.

The other group, Chris and Nash, have been left. We're the only 4 students working in the shop now. It's quiet. I don't mind either way because I have my music earbuds + sound dampening/protective earmuffs which keep it silent. The only thing that gets in the way is when we've had too many people trying to share all the same resources in the room. Even the teacher believes we shouldn't have more than 11 students at a time (we just don't have that many tables, jack stands, vises, and cutting machines. Only the welding machines outnumber our maximum needs.

Nash doesn't remember the room ever being busy enough to have all the tables full, with 2 groups working at a table sometimes. He has a bad memory. I've seen him call others liars. Sometimes he is right, sometimes he is wrong. He has an ol' country boy wannabe "I reckon"-ness about him, but he is rarely insightful about it. He is clearly the son of capitalists. 

My teacher called me into his office. He wanted me to find a way for him to play Angry Birds on his computer. I don't mind if he plays video games if I'm learning at the pace and in the way, I wish to. He always answers my questions, and he always has patience with me when I ask for clarification. Someone with the willpower to learn in his class actually can learn. I think Chris and I are excellent examples of it. So, play some games if you want an old man. Given that, I feel terrible for this man who can't use his computer. What is he doing with his life? How does he manage it? The single most important instrument in the history of humanity, and he can barely search for what he needs. I bookmarked the original, some variants, and Kongregate for him. I showed him the bookmarks folder on his bar. He thanked me. 

We also talked about Ferguson. My teacher didn't know who to pair with him and was relieved I volunteered for it. My teacher has also noticed that Ferguson is exceptionally good at rotating objects in his end.

I think I'm not fun to be around, but I'm fun to work with. I get shit done. You're always glad to have me on your team. I might be annoying, but I try to not come off arrogant about it. I may have crossed the line though. 

I was watching my previous group, and they did not go the correct build path. They have a much simpler design than Ferguson and I have been given, with a single 45-degree angle, but no 45-degree fittings. It's just an offset. It's obvious that you start with the hypotenuse, that you build the parallel pipes off from it so that it lays flat for you when you level it. After that, you add the 45-degree bends. This is clearly the best way to solve the problem. It feels right. I can't quite give the reasons for it yet, but I am convinced the teacher is right about it. Unfortunately, Chris had already started it the wrong way, and that's was the earliest I saw it to say anything. <<ref "3">> I think I annoyed him by suggesting it to him.

They were really pissed working on the project without me yesterday. Chris was so mad he said he wanted to take a blowtorch to it. It showed too. It wasn't quite level and plumb where I'd expect. Don't get me wrong, I was struggling with this thing too. But, I would have finished it yesterday, I believe. I worry that this will only carry over into their new project. Maybe I'm wrong though. Chris may just find his own way. My suggestion was to turn it so that the 45'd area was level (while they still can, but I did not say that part). Let's see if he takes me up on it. I can see they are already struggling to get it. They are literally trying to eye-ball it. There is no need to eyeball or double-balance (balancing two things at once) or perhaps triple-balance on this one.

<<footnotes "1" "Like...duh? How could I have not figured out to just do that? Why am I not asking people enough questions? I don't even post enough online about the problems I'm having. It's clear to me that my even my own daughter has more sense than I do about this exact this (and I should be far more advanced in executive functioning). I'm glad he had the foresight to just help me talk to the person who knows everything about it. I'm obviously not employing my executive functioning very well. =(. God damnit.">>

<<footnotes "2" "A personal relationship with this man">>

<<footnotes "3" "I need theory, not just instinct. I need to identify when to apply theory not just with my gut, but with my frontal lobes. If you do it their way, you'll have a harder time knowing which direction to point the fittings. If you do it my way, the 'flat' sides of fitting will match up nicely (you can level off those points). This makes placing the fitting (fitting the fitting) more accurate. Getting the fitting, not the pipe, to be where you want it is most of the battle. That's why it is called pipefitting.">>
