title: 2019.03.13 - Prompted Introspection: Close to Nature

!! Have you had an experience that made you feel close to nature?

Ah, the weasel word: "nature." I have seen the studies, and I grant there is something to it. I have many hippie-granola friends who have been wrong here, and I with them. I must channel that place carefully.

I feel especially at one with nature when I'm camping or looking at mountains and trees. Beaches do it as well. Magic mushrooms always do it. Petrichor overcomes me. The feeling of unity is not the same as being unified. It's got to be justified affectation and cognition. Psychedelics have shown me plenty about my [[phenomenology]] and opened me up. I am, of course, incredibly skeptical of any kind of zen reasoning that ultimately denies the self to the point that it abolishes the struggle for meaning and to be [[good]] people. There has to be something right about henosis. Saint Spinoza has much to say, but he must be wrong about reducing everything to necessity. Contingency and [[fff]] identity are real, in even if in [[dok]]. Perhaps he might grant me such a mode.

In the end, even the computer in front of me is natural to me. Does it activate my prehistoric lizard brain fittingly? Not exactly. I hope to adapt.
