title: 2019.02.02 - Self-Dialectic: Saint Diogenesocrates

[[WWDD]] has been a force. Is it [[ehyeh]] or a projection of it? I don't seem to model this effectively enough. Gorgeously, [[Saint Diogenesocrates]] is a construction by constructed definition. He's fiction on purpose! What a kindly valuable [[infinigress]]ive vortex of a remodeling agent. Speaking to myself as my pretend friend (or adversary in [[T42T]], I [[hope]]) just isn't the same as speaking to someone else as my pretend friend. The external dialectic is conceptually necessary. It is faith, yet again. I must subjectively externalize the ideal.
