[6:01 PM] h0p3: Btw, I appreciate that you take the time to post your philosophical point of view. It's not fun or easy always. I hope to have the chance to read far more of it.
[6:01 PM] chameleon: aw, thanks
[6:01 PM] chameleon: don't listen too much to my sleep-deprived mind :wink:
[6:01 PM] chameleon: if I was to do a neo-rationalist and post "epistemic status" that would probably help
[6:02 PM] h0p3: Lol.
[6:02 PM] h0p3: I think you gave it fine context. I think you are looking in a place most neo-rationalists aren't willing to even touch with a 10-foot pole (but that probably goes for both of us; gwern probably finds me to be a quack).
[6:04 PM] chameleon: if I can use the wiki more honestly and more deeply, I think I can develop something really great
[6:04 PM] chameleon: hehe, I thought of reaching out to gwern too
[6:04 PM] chameleon: he and I might have more in common. he's a weeb, so maybe he'd find my waifuism interesting
[6:05 PM] h0p3: You should. That would be cool.
[6:06 PM] h0p3: No reason not to except that it can be expensive to speak with so many people at once.
[6:07 PM] h0p3: I have no idea if I'm a weeb or not. I've hung around lots of weebs (family members who consider themselves as such). I'm probably more weeb adjacent or something.
[6:15 PM] chameleon: weeb adjacent, hehe
[6:16 PM] chameleon: I joke that I'm a second-generation weeb because dad was into samurai and stuff growing up
[6:16 PM] h0p3: The man sounds leet.
[6:16 PM] chameleon: he's actually a huge role model for me
[6:17 PM] h0p3: Yes, I wish got to read way more about him.
[6:17 PM] chameleon: article for the future then!
