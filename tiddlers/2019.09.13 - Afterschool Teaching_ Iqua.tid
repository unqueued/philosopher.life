title: 2019.09.13 - Afterschool Teaching: Iqua

Whitney came in very late. She was on a date. I did all the prep again. Good thing I know my place. I'm glad I have the chance to use our fresh food before it goes bad. Delp was just doing his usual unjustified coercion I've seen before (also, it's more obvious what was wrong the other night). 

One-on-one's were excellent. Conversational opportunities spontaneously emerge on Fridays. When I ask my children about their plans outside of prison, I get to see what they really value. I especially adore the students who don't know. I take the good with the bad, and it's joyous when my child will cooperate enough to connect. I sometimes feel so airgapped, but there are real moments of connection to be earned.

I joked with Madame Bacon about her fulfillment of Delp's position. He was disgruntled by it (listening from another room); he wears it on his sleeve. 

We were locked out of the library, but since I wasn't specifically commanded not to enter, we went in.

Whitney has left me with all the children again so she can climb social ladders in the office. I'm a conductor of monkeys among some [[gems]]. Prisoner's Island won't fix 'em though. I suppose the students who would make the most use of me are also the least likely to be in this program. 

Oh, I had at least a dozen children sit with me within half an hour. Several were exceptionally unhappy. It is the price we must pay. I let it rip today, shutting down shitty arguments left and right. I gave no space today in our dialectics. I'm tired of being directly lied to without justification and being expected to play along with the worlds of confabulation surrounding these lies. It is one of the reasons I prize my namesake; everyone else might hate her, but her honesty is gorgeous (I told her so later on).

7G has an "iqua" gut instinct in her. Them fists came up like lightning (8J backed away when he realized). My wife knows it well; I try not to frighten, tickle, wake, or surprise her without being ready for it. There's no cognition in the process it is so automated, and I'm not convinced it can be so easily habituated away.

6KB's backpack was missing, and Madame Bacon allowed 6CC and I to hunt it down. <3 Things I only get to do with a sane boss.

5AN makes me guffaw all the time. My sometimes negative girls pick out the [[salience]] so well. She's hilarious. I can see she's going to struggle a great deal with her upbringing. I can tell her parents love her to some extent though. We talked about her grounding this weekend. She reminded me that I failed to give her a quote of the day (she randomly asked me for quotes I found valuable the other day). She didn't care for my quote, understandably.

Those who stayed in the library with me sang along to the diva songs I have (well, I hummed, since I don't know the words to any of my songs). I adore when they make fun of my music and then can't control their enjoyment of others. My daughter does the same.

I just want to live in the library and computer lab with the people who want to be here too. 5AO was livid, whining, and begging about us leaving the library a minute earlier than we have to (completely unlike this child otherwise). Pure music to my ears, child. Fuck yeah, you are entitled to this place! I hope she becomes a [[monster]].

We were discussing 8Jm's difficulties, and they agreed he has a difficult homelife (pretty awful). A few minutes later, the mother is joking about having used an extremely rare (as in: occasional) swearword in front of her child (rofl, like that is true, or like that is even remotely the real set of problems he faces), and the people in the room play along in this false narrative and chastise him for having caused his mother to do this. Gaslighting. I'm glad I have my chance to say otherwise when I speak with him in private. Well, at least she is forcing him to get some sleep. I applaud that.
