title: Revisionist History: S01E05

This mini-series inspires my anger. I already know what they are saying (been there, done that), but the narrative adds fuel to the fire (and I don't even particularly like the rhetoric of the narrative either). I despise wealthy people. I despise those who empower the wealthy. All are reducible to selfishness.

Revisionist History is clearly meant to influence the wealthy and powerful; that's the audience. I can hear it in the tone, in the subject matter, in the way it is conveyed. Malcolm Gladwell is trying to maintain some sort of celebrity status among these people.

He should have just called it what it is: a prisoner's dilemma. Only by cooperating to help the poor and needy will everyone be on a level competitive playing field. When one school doesn't make those sacrifices, it hurts all the rest, since that school maintains a kind of competitive advantage for picking up wealthy students. 

Gladwell tries to paint this as simply something the market itself must solve. As if it is only the people's will that could possible fix this. What neoliberal bullshit! I grant that we all have to step up, but boycotting is not effective enough. This is not radical enough to fix the problem. This is not the equalizer. Ultimately, much stronger wealth, knowledge, and power redistribution methods are going to be necessarily to stop the continued hyper-snowballing centralization of these assets in the hands of the elite.

Fuck you too Gladwell. You smarmy piece of shit. He probably thinks he is actually doing good with this. Jesus H.B.F. Christ. Kill yourselves.
