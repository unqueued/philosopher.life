"""
[8:15 PM]  h0p3: How's your weekend?

[9:48 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Hey! It was busy but good. We had a birthday party for [[AG]] and got to see [[L]]’s folks. It was good. How about you guys?
[10:23 AM]  h0p3: That is good.
[10:24 AM]  h0p3: You enjoy the axethrowing?
[10:30 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Yeah. I got the hang of it pretty quickly!
[10:30 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: [[L]] had trouble haha. I felt bad for her.
[10:30 AM]  h0p3: You are prepared for hunting now.
[10:31 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: As long as the deer stands still. :joy:

[12:14 PM]  h0p3: How's your day going?
[12:14 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Not too bad! I’m out of work only two hours in though. :upside_down:
[12:14 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: How are you feeling?
[12:15 PM]  h0p3: That's such a weird feeling at work. Like, it can make the day feeling longer.
[12:15 PM]  h0p3: Especially if you enjoy your job to some degree.
[12:15 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I just don’t want to be sent home. Ya know?
[12:16 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Yesterday I had the same issue and just walked around for an hour.
[12:16 PM]  h0p3: I slept like garbage last night, but I did get sleep on my belly (oh, sweet baby jesus I love sleeping on my belly, and I've not been able to do it in quite a while).
[12:16 PM]  h0p3: Yes, I get that. Finding ways to look busy can be difficult.
[12:17 PM]  h0p3: Still can't schedule an appointment. I patiently wait.
[12:17 PM]  h0p3: How's your allergies and anxiety?
[12:18 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: My breathing got better for a few days but now it’s back to shitty. I’m almost done with my prylosec though. 4 more pills.
[12:19 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: So i think it’s safe to say my throat problems can’t be stomach acid or allergies.
[12:19 PM]  h0p3: Ugh. You are still on the hunt, sir.
[12:19 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: So I have no idea what’s wrong, just that I’m entering month four of feeling like I’m suffocating. :joy: It’s not helping anxiety lol
[12:19 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m trying haha.
[12:21 PM]  h0p3: Lol, yeah. Sorry. I don't mean to make it worse either. I just want to know how you are doing. I admire your perseverence in pursuing a solution.
[12:21 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: No worries. I want to know the same for you.
[12:21 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: So now I wonder if drainage is irritating my throat. Is that even possible?
[12:22 PM]  h0p3: Dude, that is my life right now. Non-stop drainage. Tickles the living the shit out of me, and I can't stop coughing. But, I think it's the coughing that does the irritation for me. I have no idea if drainage can do it.
[12:22 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: My sinuses are empty but I feel mucus sliding down pretty much all the time.
[12:23 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Ugh it sucks
[12:28 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I think I might need to go see a specialist
