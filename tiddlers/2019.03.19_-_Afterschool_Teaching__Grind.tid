title: 2019.03.19 - Afterschool Teaching: Grind

Whitney was late. She isn't feeling well. This must be an insane semester for her. I got her paperwork done and did the prep. I'm trying to help her out.

I was asked by the librarian asked me if I did anything outside of this job. I was curious, so I said no. She asked me to volunteer my time to witness someone proctoring an exam. We have different goals.

The ESL teacher spoke again alongside 5CM. It was a curious moment. She was asking about the structure of the program. I do not understand what's happening in her mind, clearly.

Another teacher came to speak with me about 6Dm. He's not been doing his work. That kid is up and down. Not sure how to stabilize him.

Delp is gone today, so Mitchell has the office. I took 5th this time. Teachers are handing more of their work directly to us. It's a fascinating experience. I'm having the kids study for their vocabulary test, and then we have a math packet. 5CM is sitting next to me though because he has to get his homework done first. 

5NP has been an asshole, so I set him in front of the office in the cafeteria. I have no other option; I can't create a space for people to study. There simply aren't enough people working here to handle it all. There are only 2 of us. Escalation gives way to it.

5CM and I sat working together for a long time. He can read, and he can write. It might not be perfect, but his competence is far higher than the ESL teacher said. I wonder what is lost in translation here. I must be missing something.

Many of the 5th grade girls came to press me on my insistence that they are not allowed to use the phones according to the school. I continue to repeat school policy. It was a long conversation, and I made sure to explain what I have explicitly said to them. 

The smartest of the bunch understood, and the others struggled. I also cannot take a hint either, so I have zero room to talk. It was an opportunity to talk about the nature of authority and justification. I love having the chance to say that I have no way to defeat their arguments while expressing what my job's duties supposedly entail.

It must be a disorienting experience for them (and my kids experience an even wider range). In the dialectic, I demand we radically focus together. I'm an asshole about it even. It's crucial that we can have crucial conversations. Yeah, yeah. But, when it comes to freetime, which is most of what we do, I'm extremely permissive and open. It is perhaps the appearance of contradiction in me that I'm so radically perfectionistic and authoritarian in aspects of our dialectic, but almost the opposite in other contexts. Part of understanding authority is that we see the difference between justified moral requirements and mere social conventions, and the entailments.

This is one place I fail my own children. They have a powerful vocabulary and framework for interpreting the world, but they don't run up against enough social situations and authorities to have the practice necessary for virtue. They naturally pass right now, but in time, they will not.

I preached the gospel of the library to the kids in the gym. Ofc, 6HM came. She's been reading the entire time. She is exceptionally observant too. That is a future allstar and a darkhorse among everyone here. She's intensely quiet. I want to hear her voice. It's a fucking travesty that she is stuck with the rest of these kids. Maybe I should bring her a book? She even makes her older sister seem unfortunate. 

7Jm is wearing pretend fake nails today. They are gorgeous. I love having the chance to play along with the kids. He wants to wander, and I'm continually having to tell him I don't want him to get in trouble for it (so be careful).

The girls played with gak that wouldn't ruin the carpet. The cop sits in the room next to me. I'm sure she must find it insane. That's okay. 

I talked with the janitors about ghosthunting. I don't fit in, but they graciously do not care. 

Mitchell said he's done with 5NP and 5KA. They are just going to sit in the cafeteria from now on. He gets to see them throughout the day, and apparently, it's bad everywhere. 5NP saw some improvement, but it's hell again.

8CH looks exactly like her mother. It's insane. Twins 20 years apart. Spitting image.

Mitchell wanted to go early and left the fort to me. Okay.
