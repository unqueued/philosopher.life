title: 2018.11.08 - Polymath Craftsman: Dryer

Yay! It turns out I'm not absolutely incompetent, just mostly. My guess about the exhaust pipe being clogged is correct. They spent 2 hours with a snake and vacuum. No go, and even has water trapped in thar. Now they have to get into the attic to clean it out. Bought the part, rushed for tomorrow. Worth the extra cost, since I'd be paying for it in quarters at the laundromat anyways, and I'd rather just be in my own home.

One nice part about my greybeard and time spent in the trades is that I can pass for being an actual handyman/roughneck. I consider myself, ofc, a fish out of water.
