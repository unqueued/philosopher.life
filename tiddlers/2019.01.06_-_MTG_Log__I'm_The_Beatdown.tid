//Switching kids to MUC while I play the targeted deck.//

Daughter:

Mull to 2 mountain, 2 vial, sting, crafter. Ugh. Island->Go. Mountain, vial. Island. Mountain. Kids get all the caverns, and I get none (boohoo). Island. Wasteland. Island, AV. Vial->chief, swing, unanswered. Island, disk. Cavern->leader->(whiff), vial->crafter->leader (I DIDN'T SWING WITH LEADER!), swing. Island, EoT->ping her. I talk to her about not taking risks and actually do something (she's going to lose otherwise). Cavern->Matron->leader->vial->leader->(WHIFF GODFUCKINGDAMNIT), swing, cracks disk, timmy in response, crafter->leader->(lackey, kiki), drop my sandbagged vial. She drops disk. Swing, cavern->inc. AV lands, island, shackles? I ramp (sting ready), move at attack step and she loudly chooses to do nothing (and jokes about trying to lose to annoy me), NO ANSWERS, WTF....

We have a serious discussion about taking risks when one is new to something, lacking confidence, can't be certain. I'm so pissed off that she isn't even trying. I even guessed her hand for her. We walk through fables and parables. I need her to do her best, to take risks, to make mistakes [[irwartfrr]]. How many times must we talk about this? We continued to talk about it. I feel like Lombardi.

Gamestate moves back to declaring attack step. Shackles->leader, vial->sting->leader in response hydro->inc, cavern->leader->(instigator, skirk). She erupts for 2. Cavern->lackey, EoT->shackles->lackey. Jace, no activation, EoT->vial->inc. Vial->leader->(lackey, matron), swing, block and BEB (still having to coax her to try). Jace+2->Keep, shackles->lackey. Cavern->matron->trash, vial->trash, hydro->trash, sac gobbos to hit her artifacts, she doesn't crack disk?, I keep lackey, EoT->FoF->(kp[disk],[jace, flash, 2 islands]). Disk, Jace+2->bottom. Cavern->skirk, swing lackey, BEB, pass. Jace+2->bottom, EoT->krenko. Swing with both, disk, lackey. Jace+2->keep. Mountain topped->chief, swing, BEB->chief, lackey->kiki, EoT->Hydro->lackey, attempts ERUPT->mountain (all at once, I didn't kiki because of that). Erupt(1), Jace+2->bottom, AV (zero cards in hand). Mountain, Cavern->chieftain, clone, swing, gg.

Son:

2 Mountain, vial, krenko, kiki, leader, matron. Island, AV. Mountain, vial. 

Conversation train discussion. My son babbles a fuck ton (just like his ol' man). I gotta help him see his obligations here to say something [[salient]] to and with others. Ramp, port. Upkeep port, island. Chieftain, attack, flash. Island, B2B. Ramp, pass. AV, island, Jace, Jace+2->bottom, EoT->vial->matron->leader. Vial->leader->(2 inc), swing at him, vial. Jace+2->bottom. Mountain, gempalm resolves, swing. Erupt@3, EoT->Vial->Krenko, Hydroblast. Forgot Vial (derp), vial->leader->(SGC, crater). Vial->leader->(whiff), swing 1 at each, Flood on Jace's leader. Disk, Jace+2->bottom, EoT->vial->crater. Skirk resolves, swing for 4, vial->inc, vial->SGC, sac out and shoot him for the last 3 life.

This is a conversation train teaching tool for my autistic son! We had a very long discussion.
