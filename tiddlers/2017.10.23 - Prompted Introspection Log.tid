!! What do you think of your friend ALM's wiki?

I am very glad he does it. I think it's very useful to him. He needs to empathize with himself. He has obvious psychopathic tendencies in him (definitely on the spectrum, as we all are), which he hesitates to admit (but indirectly does when he is being as honest as he can be with himself). I think it will give him a chance of living to be an older man, will make his family happier and will make him enjoy life more.

I try not to say anything to him about the contents of his wiki because I don't want to argue with him. I know that will make him feel bad. He will not be capable of understanding my arguments (sometimes because they are beyond him and other times because he will refuse to acknowledge the truth). I don't want to interfere with the benefits that he can receive from the wiki. I keep it general, and I try to be as polite as I can be with him.

I look for edits almost every day, and I think about his posts. I will continue to do so. He's my friend.
