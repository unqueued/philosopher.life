title: 2018.07.29 -- Prompted Introspection: Free Speech, Bitches

!! Is speech always free? When and where might it not be free?

Freedom has a million definitions; it comes in many [[dok]]. I'll give you my usual spiel here. I believe we ought to enact significant political free speech rights (to the point that I'm not sure what one doesn't have a right to say politically). I also believe that we morally have very few things we are permitted to say (and many obligations) in each of our contexts. I agree that we have to construct society in such a way that you have the political freedom to say the word //Nigger//, but that I think you almost never have the moral right to say it. Deontic logic is complex; Hohfeldian analysis is not easy.
