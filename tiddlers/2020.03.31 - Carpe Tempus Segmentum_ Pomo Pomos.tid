title: 2020.03.31 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Pomo Pomos

* Woke at 10:30
** Kinda groggy.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Offspring weren't as far along as they'd have liked.
* We're calling them "pomos" now.
** Trying to encourage everyone to pomo. Lol. 
* Read+Write
* Wife and I went out
** Picked up meds (our hospital contains our pharmacy)
*** Hospital experience was surreal. Never seen anything like it except on the youtubes.
** Shopping at Costco
*** I'm keeping a separate ark for us beyond rice and beans. 
*** We had a hotdog, seaweed, and pralines. 
** Tons to talk about. We've done a fuckton in the past 3 months. Her probationary period is supposed to be coming up, and we thought about how to ensure the paperwork was done (some grey considerations).
*** E-mails a few minutes after the conversation from both her primary bosses about passing with flying colors and being such a good rolemodel during the crisis. Paranoically, I trust them very little, but, yeah, she has been kicking ass.
* Cleaned the garage, tool nook, vehicle, and boxes.
* Put away the food-ark; it's a shelf.
** Maybe halfway full. I'm going to round it out, I [[hope]]. 
** The goal is to not touch it. We'd be in rationing territory if we did anytime soon.
* Ordered seeds
* Read+Write
* Dialectures
** Feeling anxious. Also, I turned down sex to talk. I must be stupid.
* Made pork, asparagus, and brussel sprouts
** Too salty for my wife. =/. 
* [[Family Gathering]] with Presentations
** Offspring needed way more than 5 minutes a piece. Glad they know it's a minimum. 
** I tried not to veer and rabbithole too much. 
** My wife is going to play Cratylus, lol. =)
** We're considering making a comic, maybe ASCII art one. Distilling the basics of each character's logical argument can be my primary duty, and my offspring can attempt to build the affective qualities. They like to RP.
* Minimal kitchen
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
** My daughter and I stayed up for another hour to talk. Too much to think about.
