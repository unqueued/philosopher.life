!! Audit:

* Now that is weird. Let's have a party, and we'll take notes during it! Lol. 
** For real tho, that's what you have to do sometimes. You have to give a shit about what you think.
*** I hope it will be a kneejerk reaction for them. They might hate it now, but maybe they'll be profound naturals one day.
**** Still can't convince the girl her memory will fade like mine. Can't get him to remember to take notes. We have a ways to go.
* Okay, we all tend to give the same answers during "Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with?"
** Should we have a set of questions which have no names attached? We just throw shit at the wall together in them?
* These are taking us longer to write. We trail off into completely different things too easily (sorry kids, that's my fault).
** Sometimes it's just a chore. So be it. Even if only 10% of them are worthwhile, it's worth the price.
* I think we spent half a day just talking to and about GPT-2.
* The positive facts section is problematic. It's a learning opportunity in many cases where we have to inspect them thoroughly. I try not to argue more than I must.
* It has taken me far too fucking long to get her to start reaching out and joining communities of people (I know it's weird talking to adults at that age in a way). I'm so glad it's now something which I have to peel her away from rather than push her to do.
* Gonna have to ask him to start using his writing tools here. 
** Still isn't listening when I'm begging him to learn to type quickly. What's new. Listening to a crazy old man.
* The fact that we were moving hit hard.
