title: Family Memes

//Developing our own Atreidian Family Battle Language (but not really), one meme at a time.//

* Phrasing, boom.
** Non-sequitur 90% of the time; the normal meme the other 10% of the time.
** All bets are off with my son's usage.
* Your mom
** Super cereal reply, rebuttal. 
** Usually non-sequitir, but sometimes gets serious really fast.
* and...regular sheets
** And so forth, and so on, etc., ad inifnitum, ad absurdum.
* We do like music
** We agree. 
** I like that; me too.
* Do I look like I know what a jpeg is?
** Not sure yet?
* We're not square.
** Breech of contract.
