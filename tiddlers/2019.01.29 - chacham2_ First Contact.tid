Hello chacham2,

I'm {[[contact]]}ing you out of the blue to say "hi!" I'm not trying to freak you out, but I was interested in openly speaking with you. I noticed you in [[this thread|https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/al3if4/what_are_youre_personality_types_and_or_your_3/efapahe/]]. We appear to have several interests in common, including Jung, [[Diablo 2]], and computers.

I happen to be a complete Jung noob, imho. I was drawn in by your claim:

<<<
Everyone's "main" archetype is the shadow, because it defines the personal unconscious, and without it we'd be boring computers. 
<<<

I beg you elaborate! Do you think we are more than computers? What is particularly boring about being a computer without a shadow (are you even sure that would be a conscious computer?). I was wondering if you had any particular Jungian media sources you thought were worth consuming, especially as it relates to a computational theory of mind.

Obviously, I'd be interested in [[getting to know you|Find The Others]] long-term. I think we could be good friends. Let me know if I can {[[help]]} you, and make yourself at home, please.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
