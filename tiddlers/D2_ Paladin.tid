title: D2: Paladin

//Nog, 88 Hammerdin, DClone//

My first class in D2. I remember it like it was yesterday.

There are three builds that interest me:

# Hammerdin
#* Non-Uber Farmer
# Pure Smiter
#* Uber Farmer
# Zeal Smiter
#* My ideal Paladin; the role I ultimately love. By far the most expensive. This is where melee classes ultimately have the most profoundly unique requirements.
