title: 2018.07.31 - JRE: Flood

Chatted with my brother. He's having a shit day (and a shit month).

His basement flooded. So much is going wrong in his life right now. ARGH! It's a really hard season of life to endure. I bet he feels really fucking alone. I need to stop that. I need to find a way to listen better to him. How can I transfer his pain to me?
