How's your day going, brother?
TUE 2:33 PM
Hey buddy how are you doing today
TUE 2:33 PM
Running errands, getting that dryer fixed today assuming the exhaust pipe gets cleaned out (I think it will).
TUE 2:33 PM
Reading
TUE 2:34 PM
I thought you was mad at me for something because I hadn't heard from you
TUE 2:34 PM
and getting the kids on task
TUE 2:34 PM
Oh, no, lol.
TUE 2:34 PM
I heard that
TUE 2:34 PM
How about you, what you up to?
TUE 2:34 PM
I have another pc in my shop that has a i9 and 32gb of ram it has more cores than the new i7 I have but it's a little older it's a 6th generation chip
TUE 2:36 PM
You interested in it
TUE 2:37 PM
I can sell it alot cheaper
TUE 2:37 PM
I think the 64GB RAM machine matters. I would actually use 64GB of RAM.
TUE 2:37 PM
It also has two gtx 750tis in sli
TUE 2:38 PM
I don't think 750 ti's can SLI.
TUE 2:40 PM
I don't think there are 6th gen i9's
TUE 2:42 PM
As I said, I'd actually use the 64GB machine thoroughly, but I'd still be interested to know the precise hardware on the other machine.
TUE 2:43 PM
I just added what I have invested in the i7 machine and I don't really think I can afford to let it go for $700 I've been looking on ebay for similar machines which are not even as good as mine and they are selling for way over $700 as far as the 750s it could be another 7 something gtx but they are in sli I bought it to help a friend out so I'm not positive on the specs but it is a i9 and was told it was 6th generation and I know the gpus are 7 something gtx in sli you may have to check it out if you are interested
TUE 2:44 PM
Alright, I hear ya.
TUE 2:46 PM
It's also a bad pc or I wouldn't have it
TUE 2:46 PM
Ha, what do you mean?
TUE 2:46 PM
But I've always got the pos amd
TUE 2:46 PM
What would you be willing to see the i7 machine for?
TUE 2:47 PM
sell*
TUE 2:47 PM
I mean when I buy a PC I usually try to get one with good specs on it
TUE 2:47 PM
aye, I can see that
TUE 2:47 PM
lol
TUE 2:47 PM
I really don't know I don't want to make a offer and offend you it's just not worth losing a friend over but I can't afford to lose money either but hay I have two more just look at the i9 and I'll make it cheap enough for you to buy another 32gigs of DDR4
TUE 2:51 PM
Naw, don't worry about losing a friend.
TUE 2:51 PM
It should be close to as fast as the i7
TUE 2:52 PM
It's not that old except for the 7 series video cards
TUE 2:52 PM
You have it there to check the parts?
TUE 2:53 PM
I'm positive that they are 7 series and I'm positive it's a i9 I was told it was a sixth generation but don't know for sure
TUE 2:54 PM
Yea it's in my computer shop in top of the garage
TUE 2:55 PM
I didn't know that we your computer shop. Neat.
TUE 2:55 PM

TUE 2:55 PM

TUE 2:55 PM
Well it's not a real business it's just a top floor where I keep my pc parts and build pcs at
TUE 2:57 PM
Idk I need to find out the exact generation of the i9
TUE 2:57 PM
