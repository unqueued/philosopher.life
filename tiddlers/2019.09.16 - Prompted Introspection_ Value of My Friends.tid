title: 2019.09.16 - Prompted Introspection: Value of My Friends

!! What do you most value in your friends?

Undying loyalty, worship, telling me I'm [fabulous, superior, excellent, and perfect] at every turn, never disagreeing with me, paying attention to every single detail of my life all the way down, always standing behind my own positions and choices with no resistance or correction, willingly offering themselves for exploitation, cultic herded sheep slave mentalities, and any qualities which are useful to my will to [[power]]. They also better laugh at every god damn joke I utter, or else! Basically, you have to play along with the confabulated stories I tell myself, make sure not to question or call attention to any mistakes, illusions, or flaws in my paradigms or perspectives. Don't lurv me in virtue of the reality of who I ought to be, just like me for who I am at all costs.

I value their [[Humanity]], and I'm grateful to have people interested in binding ourselves together in [[The Golden Rule]]-based dialectics. It is too rare to have bi-directional friendships of radical depth in this world.
