I decided to just do it, so I did. I'm 92 on the necro. It took forever to clear his stash out into the shared stash. I'm starting to set the character's second stash page to the lower non-gem-combinable runes. I'm throwing all the lower-mid ones into little strings deep in the shared stash. Might as well keep them, even if I have no idea what I'm going to do with them.

I then went gambling 55 million gold. I picked up a couple +2 ammies that were usable (though generally not better than my perfect mara's). I also cubed down to find FCR/+1MPK jewelry. I've decided that I will likely need to do speedruns. Insofar as I do, I think the sorc is obviously the best to do this with. Might as well pickup sockets and HF. 

Where do I grind next? I desperately want to build the Death Runeword, and that requires the Eth Berzerker Axe. I have non-eth, but that would be a huge fucking waste of my runes in the end. I'm going to likely do a85 grinds with minimal MF gear on the Hammerdin for levels. Once I have death, I should be in a fantastic position. It should work very nicely on my kicksin, barb, and the zeal+smiter. But, if I can't do that, then maybe grind for the runes for grief?

I don't know.
