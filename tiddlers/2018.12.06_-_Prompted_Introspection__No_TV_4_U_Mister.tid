title: 2018.12.06 - Prompted Introspection: No TV 4 U Mister

!! How would you be different if you had never watched television?

Wow. I have no idea. I'd be radically different. Incidentally, I discussed with my brother [[JRE]] yesterday something like this question. It turns out to be an important issue for an autist who studies socialization, political structures, and people through video narratives. I think my [[Television Show Collection]] and [[Film: Library]] are high [[S2NR]] (though not high brow ;P).

I think I'd be stuck without it. I needed television because I certainly wasn't going to receive that information from anyone else. Nobody cared or they would actively be against me learning such things. You'll have to recall: I grew up in poverty in a cult. Television actually did free my mind in many respects, even if it was an absurd drug that I've wasted far too many hours on in others.
