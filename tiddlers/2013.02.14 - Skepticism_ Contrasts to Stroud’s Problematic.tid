title: 2013.02.14 - Skepticism: Contrasts to Stroud’s Problematic

In Lammenranta’s offers an interpretation of the Pyrrhonian Regress argument which goes:

    In order to be justified in believing something, one must believe it on the basis of good reasons.

    Good reasons must themselves be justified beliefs.

    Therefore, in order to be justified in believing something, one must believe it on the basis of an infinite number of good reasons.

    No human being can have an infinite number of good reasons.

    Therefore, it is humanly impossible to have justified beliefs.
