My brother spoke with me for about an hour today. I'm glad he called back. We were having serious signal problems, but I think this was in part due to the fact that he was doing chores and using a bluetooth piece. 

We talked about his business plans, about teaching culinary arts, about cannabis edibles, about working for himself. 

We were catching up. I talked about my daughter's music tools. I talked about my son fixing the door. I talked about writing.

My brother says it isn't draining at all talking to me, but at the very end of the conversation, he immediately changed his mind and said he was just done talking to me. I kept having to ask him to repeat himself because it wasn't clear what he was saying. I think he isn't engaged to the same [[T42T]] level that I am. 

Imho, I owe him more than he will give me, but not wildly more.
