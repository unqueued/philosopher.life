Mega suck. lol. 

But we are addressing issues and that is good.
Dec 1, 2019 2:09pm
How are you feeling, sir?
Dec 2, 2019 8:46pm
Not bad. Taking it easy. Have 2/4 classes now complete!
Dec 2, 2019 9:44pm
Awesome. I'm glad you are taking it easy and feeling not bad. Two more classes to go. It's great that you worked so far ahead that you could afford this significant disruption.
Dec 2, 2019 11:56pm

Lol.
Dec 3, 2019 2:31pm
My day has been good. Feeling better about the move, so I'm less stressed.
Dec 3, 2019 7:04pm
How is your health?
Dec 3, 2019 7:04pm
Good to hear :)
Dec 3, 2019 7:31pm
I’m good. Relaxing and breathing well.
Dec 3, 2019 7:31pm
Noice
Dec 3, 2019 7:31pm
Aced my final. Two papers to go. How are you?
Dec 4, 2019 1:00pm
Fuck yeah, dude.
Dec 4, 2019 1:00pm
How much time on the papers?
Dec 4, 2019 1:00pm
I'm doing well. School, getting car fixes, groceries, read and write.
Dec 4, 2019 1:01pm
One due Saturday. I’m well into it. One due Monday I haven’t started it. I’m going to try to get them both done by Friday.
Dec 4, 2019 1:05pm
Good! Did the car problem turn out to be a nonissue?
Dec 4, 2019 1:05pm
Well somewhat of a nonissue. Haha
Dec 4, 2019 1:05pm
You never actually need help on your papers, but I am happy to read them if you want or need with quick turnaround.
Dec 4, 2019 1:20pm
Not sure yet. Still at shop.
Dec 4, 2019 1:20pm
Supposed to be minimal.
Dec 4, 2019 1:21pm
I'm flying by the seat of my pants on all of them right now hahaha
Dec 4, 2019 1:21pm
I do have a new problem tho
Dec 4, 2019 1:21pm
The quotes I wanna use in my recently published sources are also quoting something, but it's super old. So I'm trying to figure out how to properly cite a quote that also cites a quote in MLA
Dec 4, 2019 1:22pm
It's weird
Dec 4, 2019 1:22pm
Excellent. Obviously, this one is near and dear to my heart.
Dec 4, 2019 10:52pm
I feel pretty good about it. Even if my prof doesn't agree, she can't deny that I did my homework, hahaha.
Dec 4, 2019 10:57pm
Why do you think your professor may disagree?
Dec 4, 2019 10:58pm
When we first workshopped these papers, she strongly felt that the text didn't provide enough evidence to support my claims.
Dec 4, 2019 10:58pm
...
Dec 4, 2019 10:58pm
But I feel that in utilizing the secondary sources, as well as using simple logic, that the evidence is easily grasped.
Dec 4, 2019 10:59pm
Especially in this new iteration of the paper.
Dec 4, 2019 10:59pm
I have not read the source. I have a hard time seeing how you aren't correct. I am obviously biased.
Dec 4, 2019 11:00pm
hahaha, thanks
Dec 4, 2019 11:00pm
If you back me up, then I know that this version is much stronger
Dec 4, 2019 11:00pm
;)
Dec 4, 2019 11:00pm
Thank you for checking it out. I have one major project to go!
