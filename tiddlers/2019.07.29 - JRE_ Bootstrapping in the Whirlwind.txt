I'm having a blast thinking about how to level.
SUN 9:38 PM
I'm glad they let us respec every 10 levels. I think first respec for me will happen at 30 (unless I'm wildly wrong).
SUN 9:39 PM
Talents are the fundamental resource for leveling, not skills. Or, that's what it looks like.
SUN 9:41 PM
You all have a good day today?
SUN 9:41 PM

MON 6:14 PM
Also soaked through a diaper today and got my pants wet.  He is ticking off the boxes fast.
MON 6:15 PM
=)
MON 6:15 PM
Rebecca said he dropped a crazy grey paste today, even she was bothered by it, and he already shit into her hand a few days ago, so must have been nasty
MON 6:15 PM
It is likely the case that he will have some digestive problems for a while.
MON 6:16 PM
I assume you all will normalize his system after some time.
MON 6:16 PM
Hey, do you not drain your beef before putting it into sauces?  [[j3d1h]] said you never drain the meat
MON 6:17 PM
That's not true.
MON 6:19 PM
It depends on what I'm doing.
MON 6:19 PM
I often don't though.
MON 6:19 PM
Should I always drain?
MON 6:19 PM
Nah, just surprised that they had never seen it
MON 6:20 PM
Her memory is failing her. Lol.
MON 6:20 PM
I do a lot more cooking without than with them though.
MON 6:21 PM
How is monster comin
MON 6:22 PM
Very slowly.
MON 6:23 PM
I'm designing from the ground up.
MON 6:23 PM
Lots of small things I've never done before.
MON 6:23 PM
Building the recipe out.
MON 6:23 PM
[[1uxb0x]] is behind me, but he is coming along.
MON 6:23 PM
He finished installing the base system today on his laptop. =)
MON 6:23 PM
I hope to be far enough ahead of him that my recipe will be a good feeder for his.
MON 6:24 PM
This is in preparation, hopefully, for a couple years from now where they will be doing linux from absolute scratch (for embedded) and source (with some other package managers that have it in mind). Slowly working our way toward it. They don't need that yet though.
MON 6:26 PM
Just saw the first episode of venture brothers on hulu that didn't censor nudity.  Actually never realized that the black bars in older episodes weren't part of the original drawing...
MON 6:30 PM
Saw mrs monarch topless.  Yep.  That'll-do
MON 6:30 PM
Lol!
MON 6:30 PM
She is stupid hot.
MON 6:31 PM
Don't put your arm high up while using a q-tip, cause when you turn a d hit the corner of the wall, it hits your eardrum and you feel a whole new kinda pain.  Don't think I ruptured it, but damn that sucked
MON 7:09 PM
Yikes!
MON 7:10 PM
That is a nightmare for me.
MON 7:10 PM
I doubt you've had the chance, but in case: how's the WoW going?
MON 8:09 PM

MON 9:27 PM
Prolly could now, but too tired lol
MON 9:29 PM
