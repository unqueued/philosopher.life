title: 2018.03.11 - Prompted Introspection Log: Familial Importance

!! Families are important because?

Important to whom, in what respect, given what standard? Also, define family. Do you mean blood, or the family we choose?

Families have played a profound role in evolution. It's clear that embedded in almost all of us is the irrational desire to procreate from our own genetic and memetic code. The act of creating is power, aesthically pleasing, a form of self-expression, and for some a pursuit of eternal life. It's part of the circle of life experience, of living a life that connects us to all our ancestors and people around us who have undergone the same rite of passage. Blood-relative tribalism is one of the original forms of Otherization, the beginning of governments out of the state of nature, and it has thus far been incredibly adaptive (simply in terms of survival and reproduction, which is to say nothing of its eudaimonic or moral properties otherwise). I can't say it's been a nearly wholesale force for good in the world like I once blindly thought.

The family we choose, that seems to have more hope to it. There are different reasons to bind ourselves to others besides sharing a genetic heritage. I have a profound respect for my brother's choice to foster. If I could go back and adopt my two children, I would have. I increasingly see the value in the family we choose compared to the our blood-relations. What does it really mean to be family? At the end of the day, it's how we empathize with each other, a realm in which blood is virtually (if not entirely) irrelevant.
