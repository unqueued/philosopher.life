title: 2018.06.30 - Carpe Diem: Pho

* Woke at 7:15...
** Umm..Okay. The cat dander is killing me, but that's okay. I'm very glad to be here.
* Took a shower.
* Read+Write
* Oatmeal. =)
* Talked some with folks, but my brother decided to play vidya games instead of talking. I'm sure I'm annoying to talk with. That's okay. I'm fine living in my wiki with music. We did talk more in the day though!
* Took a nap
* Pho and walked with my brother
* Mostly chilled, which is cool.
* I got to talk more with Reb, and that's nice to be able to connect more with her.
* Watched ER and worked on the computer a bit.
* Augmented Fireman Time!
* Venture and sleep by 12:30
