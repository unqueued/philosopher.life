title: PH

!! About:

PH stands for Placeholder. They are stages and drafts. This is also an attempt to escape [[/b/]] and categorize more effectively.

This a quick way to force the creation of a link and a way to generate peace of mind when I feel overwhelmed by my mind-mapping.

Sometimes I need to signal to my [[futureself]] that I should do something, but I don't immediately have the time to do it. Perhaps this is procrastination, but often I'm exploring the unknown, defragmenting, or unclusterfucking a number of ideas and issues. Sometimes I just don't have time to write a definition down, etc. This is that signal tool.

!! Principles:

* Write "PH" at the top of anything that you would otherwise leave blank.
* Is it a work in progress not ready for the light of day? Feel free to PH it.
** Feel free to not have finished something, to give yourself time to develop, etc.
