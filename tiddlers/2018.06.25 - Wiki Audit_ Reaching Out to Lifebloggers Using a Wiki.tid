title: 2018.06.25 - Wiki Audit: Reaching Out to Lifebloggers Using a Wiki

I need to reach out to people who engage in this process to figure out how best to do it in my context. There is a serious [[gfwiwcgws]] thing going on here, a contextualist, anti-luck, externalist problem. 

Send something to /r/wikis. 

Spend time with [[Sifting Letter Template: Seeking Wiki-Lifeloggers]].

I've clearly got a fuckton of work to do in [[Self-Dialectic]]. I'm glad I see it as a project that needs major work.
