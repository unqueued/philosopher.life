title: 2019.03.09 - Prompted Introspection: Farm

!! Tell about living or visiting a farm or ranch.

I lived around farms for a long time. I don't have any particular story that stands out to me though. It has been fascinating to see the lives of farmers, their politics, and their socialization. Looking back, I can't name a single farmer who was moral, including The Farmers (not really farmers; Matt and Theresa were smart kids). A few existentially, sacrificially generous women glued that town together. They are the only people I hold in esteem. I am, of course, such a snob.
