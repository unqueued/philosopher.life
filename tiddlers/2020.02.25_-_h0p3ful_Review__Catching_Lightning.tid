title: 2020.02.25 - h0p3ful Review: Catching Lightning

*[[The Lightning Thief]]
** Recall that this is a ROUGH DRAFT! You and everyone else knows it's not even close to what you want it to be. It's a fine rough draft. We're going to take it to the next level.
** I'd like to know your notetaking -> paper process. I am not sure if you need stark separation like I am asking of your brother. You are naturally far, far more gifted than I will ever be in this space. If you can deliver results which I cannot deconstruct, you've got a non-trivial process.
** You've broken up the writing considerably. 
*** Why not just go for the bare minimum off the bat? Just in case, make sure to write the 3 paragraphs she asked for up front to make sure you've covered ever single base that was initially requested. You may have accomplished this already before writing further, so I may not have room to speak here.
** "In this chapter, we are introduced to the characters and writing style."
*** So? Why should this be your opening line? It says nothing relevant enough in the eyes of your reader. 
**** You may be correct here, but it's not what your audience is looking for. You are writing to our teacher. Let us assume our teacher does not know us well; let us assume our teacher merits the convenience of speaking on their terms.
**** Opening lines and paragraphs should have a bold thesis or catch-point. It's rhetorically necessary. Where are the delicious breadcrumbs?
** Run-on sentences will be your bane. Passive voice as well. Shit is hard, yo.
*** The way in which we speak verbally doesn't help us here. Our habits betray us in this case.
**  Ideally, we will be able to tie our paragraphs together with smooth transitions. 
*** I'm awful at this. It's a skill you must learn from our teacher here.
** The ~~strikethrough~~ device should rarely be used in formal writing.
** //emetic// - so hawt 
** Your summary is thorough, and it can be tightened in your next draft.
*** It may be a place to begin pointing to other kinds of meaning which emerge from the base narrative.
** You may want to flesh out the conclusion of the last paragraph (or tie it to the story) of the second section.
** You caught plenty I didn't too. There's good work in your final section.
*** It's considerably better than mine.

** Edited. Oopsed a title.Title. My bad.
** The fleshing out, please.

** I think you will eventually want to consider what you claim to not care for here. 
** It is very difficult to make the claim that smelling flowers wasn't useful to us, and I think you've overgeneralized. You have a specific point to make in teleology, but you have not picked it out clearly enough for your reader.
*** At the moment, it appears to be a strawman in that regard. Survival in what contexts? 
** You know, for someone who adores art and creates so much of it, this is a topic you will need to wrestle with pretty often. There is so much to say here, and I'm glad to see you taking up a point of view (and, I hope you are prepared to continue modifying that point of view here).
*[[2020/02/24 -- Prompted Introspection: Art Theft]]
** Excellent argument. =) 
*** I am such a fucking asshole here. I know. 
*[[2020/02/24 -- Life Log]]
** Thorough enough for me. Good job.
** Growing it to pick out what you think was interesting otherwise may be useful to you.
*[[2020/02/24 -- Wiki Log]]
** It's an easy place to point which holds the results of the query. We may change it, but I think it's a fine start.
** You didn't fill out your routines. I'd like to see that you fully understand this structure which must fit into your day and week. You've got to bring some order to the chaos here.
*[[2020/02/24 -- To-Do List Log]]
** This TDL has specifics. I adore it. Maybe some of these belong in a [[Standing TDL]]. 
** We ended up not having much time. Our morning did not enable us to have as much free time in the evening as we'd prefer.
* [[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Last year today, you did solid work. 
** //The Chosen// has been an important book for us.
*** I'm grateful for your effort.
** That 5-sentence punishment, which is honest, rings true.
** I appreciate when you take the time to evaluate yourself thoughtfully. It is hard to do well, especially for a perfectionist.
