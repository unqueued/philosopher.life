title: 2018.08.05 - Weekly TDL: Unschool

* I need to make sure my son gets into the groove of building this structure. I need to offer him guidance. I must be patient, kind, and as clear I can be. I need to help him see his effort is worth it.
* I need to encourage my daughter to build her vision.
* I want to finish the {[[Principles]]} audit.
* I want to continue to work on m10 quite a bit.
* I need to go shopping, and I want to make sure I get the items my wife needs.
* I need to make serious progress in [[DND]], as I promised to L.
* I hope to complete some letters to many people this week. I have a huge [[FTO]] backlog, imho.
* I'd like to come up with a gift to my mother, [[R]].
