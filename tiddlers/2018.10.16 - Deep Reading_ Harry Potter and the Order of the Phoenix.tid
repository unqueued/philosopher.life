Rowling has worked hard to demonstrate a coming of age story, and she does a reasonable job of showing the stages of sociosexual development.

I'd kill for a good quick-quotes quill ;P.

Hermione, again, is pointing it all out to us. I love her. Solid empathy, as usual. I love how she doesn't give a shit about sportsball.

I despise Dolores. You know that bitch is a conservative too.

I think modern censorship, unfortunately, is radically more complex than Rowling portrays.

Dumbledore doin' his thing. He always seems to win. Such a badass.
