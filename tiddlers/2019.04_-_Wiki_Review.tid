!! Audit:

* I've not been feeling productive.
** [[FTO]] has been so consuming, I've barely got anything done. Add in [[Deep Reading]] and [[Link Log]], and I've made almost no progress. On top of that [[Wiki Audit]] is falling apart quite a bit. There is only so much attention I can pay. 
*** I'm afraid I don't do any deeper work now. =/ I have a lot of time though (right?). I probably still have another 15 years left, right?
* Sundays continue to become a profound day of reflection, and I'm wondering if I shouldn't start recording the weekly chatlogs on Saturday so that I do my [[Review]]s on Sunday. 
** I could handle this commentary through fields or even within the tiddlers themselves. I'm glad I do it in the [[Review]]. It's a different space, I get to see more at once and think about the week as a whole.
*** Hrmm. That sounds like a [[Log Audit]] to me, lol! That's a weekly log audit which naturally arises from my recording habit.
* Lol, I think most people are tired of hearing from me. I am unfun, labor-intensive, and mostly an asshole, right? 
* My daughter has been doing more direct work in the wiki than usual.
** In fact, the whole family has. People are editing, and the [[Family Log]] is often not written by me. 
*** [[1uxb0x]] needs to take his turn too.
* I know this is really a [[Wiki Audit]] point, but I'm reminded of it here. I read as I write, I [[Review]], I read again in [[Family Time]], I cover most of the territory again in [[Monthly Auditable]], [[The Remodeling]] of [[Wiki Audit]] is a distant look (and hopefully continuous re-evaluation), and my searches (super common for [[Prompted Introspection]], [[Computer Musings]], and letter writing in [[FTO]]) are another route.
** Should I add a "This day last year"? 
** Should I add a more random look?
** This is the repetition of burning things into my memory and thinking about it from multiple angles.
** The [[Review]] is a special top-down overview in the [[Log Audit]] process. Maybe it should go first or last? 
*** I've not really thought about ordering here.
* Fascinating to see [[Review]] keep a record of [[PH]]ed tiddlers which didn't make the cut for [[Wiki Audit: Purged]]
* The [[@]] for [[FTO]] has been useful for me, but I'm not convinced anyone else cares (which, again, is a useful indicator for me).
** I'm lucky to have a place to think with consistency about [[FTO]] in general. This has been an awesome catchall.
* I've had sex and sleep on the brain.
