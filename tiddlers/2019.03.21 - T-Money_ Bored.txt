THU 12:42 PM
Ouch. Sorry about your guitar.
THU 12:43 PM
It's hilarious how often you send me screenshots of text. That is the norm, I think.
THU 12:43 PM
How's that back?
THU 12:43 PM
It makes it easier than re typing it on the Telephone.
THU 12:44 PM
Aye
THU 12:44 PM
Im also at home, out of work. And bored out of my mind. Sending texts to friends and trying to pass the time. Since I found out my diagnosis Ive been an emotional. Roller coaster.
THU 12:45 PM
I've been in bed all day after last night.
THU 12:45 PM
Still worth it.
THU 12:45 PM
Didn't know. If you caught the last part of the screenshot of text.
THU 12:46 PM
I did. I wasn't sure how literally to take it.
THU 12:47 PM
I am often a poor interpreter.
THU 12:47 PM
I'm sorry you've been in bed.
THU 12:48 PM
That must be driving you absolutely crazy, dude.
THU 12:48 PM
I hope it is a time of meditation for you.
THU 12:48 PM
I try to do stuff. I've been in the garage twice since my back went out. After one time I could barely get out of bed to piss. Pain finally subsided that night back to the kinda constant ache which is manageable
THU 12:50 PM
But whenever I get up and out and do too much I can tell. It hurts bad. Shooting pains and shit.
THU 12:50 PM
It's not the end of me, but I need that physical therapy.
THU 12:51 PM
You are a grown ass man. I hope you get enough rest to recuperate.
THU 12:51 PM
I have started some stretches. Which seem to help. Resting helps.
THU 12:51 PM
Noice.
THU 12:51 PM
I think it's good that you are taking time to reach out to people (and perhaps yourself) as you are bedridden.
THU 12:52 PM
I hope you don't feel alone.
THU 12:52 PM
I can see you are anxious as fuck and rollercoastery, and understandably so.
THU 12:53 PM
I've talked to alot. Of guys. Both good and bad results. I think alot of it has to do with learning your body and paying attention to what your limitations are.
THU 12:53 PM
Yeah. I'm not bed ridden. It is just where I feel the lease pain.
THU 12:53 PM
Ah, well, when you are*
THU 12:53 PM
I'm sure you know your limits.
THU 12:54 PM
Lol. I can move about the house and shit. I'm not crying out. I'm driving some to. Get my daughter in the evening.
THU 12:54 PM
I'm a pansy when it comes to pain.
THU 12:54 PM
Noice.
THU 12:54 PM
Me too.
THU 12:54 PM
I bet she enjoys that too.
THU 12:54 PM
How's she doing, btw?
THU 12:54 PM
She keeps forgetting. I'm. Injured.
THU 12:54 PM
Lol
THU 12:54 PM
She sees me. In the evening and she like. How was work dad?
THU 12:55 PM
As I'm hunched over walker her back to the car.
THU 12:55 PM
Walking
THU 12:55 PM
I tried to get her to help. Me in the garage yesterday. But we just kept fighting with each other.
THU 12:56 PM
That is my life.
THU 12:56 PM
She is definitely bull headed, thinks she knows everything, and argues constantly, whines, sass. We are Pretty sure she is going to be an early bloomer
THU 12:57 PM
She is already the tallest in her class. Kathy has started having to. Make her wear kids deodorant.
THU 12:57 PM
And you can see the hormonal change from kid shit too (I hate everyone shit)
THU 12:58 PM
Lol
THU 12:58 PM
Yup.
THU 12:58 PM
We both developed very early. So no surprise.
THU 12:58 PM
But to be honest I have wasted most of my time binge watching a TV series. Staying up late so I can sleep. In. And one or two errands a day. And then I'm in more pain again and have to rest.
THU 1:07 PM
Most of the tasks I enjoy or get the most gratification from are larger projects that required alot of work.
THU 1:08 PM
Love Death & Robots is excellent.
THU 1:08 PM
I can appreciate how we are collections of narratives and projects.
THU 1:09 PM
I'm actually watching hell in wheels. This is my 3rd Time thru the series. Not since I've been off. Just since it was released.
THU 1:10 PM
I will check out love death and robots. Looking at trailer now.
THU 1:10 PM
Looks wild!
THU 1:11 PM
What are the shows that you keep coming back to?
THU 1:29 PM
I usually just watch nature documentaries. BBC, PBS and the like. But I don't normally watch alot. Of TV.
THU 1:30 PM
We watch episodes when we eat dinner. But that's just for fun.
THU 1:31 PM
And relaxing.
THU 1:31 PM
Aye. Same. Good way to show kids the stories that matter to me too.
THU 1:31 PM
Gives us a chance to talk
THU 1:31 PM
Almost done with KOTH.
THU 1:31 PM
We're taking a detour with the Love, Death & Robots atm.
THU 1:32 PM
Your shitting me. We are literally in season two of king of the hill.
THU 1:32 PM
It will be the second time we have watched it with Samantha. The first was a few years ago, and she didn't pay any attention.
THU 1:33 PM
Now she likes it.
THU 1:33 PM
We were on Malcom in the middle until he got. To high-school. And they started make out scenes with the kids and talking about sex.
THU 1:34 PM
An uncomfortable topic, no doubt.
THU 1:36 PM
Yeah, we haven't had that convo. And it's tougher for me to talk to a girl about it... It is, within the year or so I won't doubt.
THU 1:40 PM
It is likely a series of many conversations and integrations into how we interact with our children.
THU 1:41 PM
Agreed
