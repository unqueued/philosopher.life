!! If you were to die today what would like people to say about you?

[[2018.06.05 - Prompted Introspection Log: After Death]], yeah, Preach, yo! 

This question is icky to me. It's easy to pursue approval [[irwrongfrr]] here. It is not a bad question in itself though.

I have been told by a handful of people in my life that they couldn't bear for me to die. I don't know what they would say. I'm not sure what I would want them to say. I [[hope]] they would be safe, that they would laugh and cry about my being gone, that they could move on. I don't want to leave a hole. I want them to be whole again. If I were to lose them, I don't think I could recover; I hope it's the opposite for them. I hope my memory would make them more resilient, only fragile when it is safe.

I'd like them to be able to say that they know I [[love]]d them, that I did my best to be a [[good]] person, that they forgive me for being a bad one so often, that they were glad to have had me in their lives. I'd like them to be glad they've met their retarded friend. I cannot say I have earned that.
