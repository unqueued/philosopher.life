title: 2017.07.30 -- Pipefitting Log

Rented a vehicle for the week. I'm waiting on Eth money, a paycheck, and an extremely generous $500 gift from my father-in-law (who refused not to give it to us). We'll buy a vehicle on Saturday with the money.

T-Mobile Coverage blows through the mountains. Verizon is still king. My bluetooth headset is wonderful. I'm sold immediately.
