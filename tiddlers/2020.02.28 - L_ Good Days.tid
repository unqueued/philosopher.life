[9:39 PM]  h0p3: hope translation went well for you today

[1:08 PM]  h0p3: Yo, homie! How goes it?
[1:42 PM]  Sohalia: It goes! I am so incredibly glad itâ€™s Friday. I am very much over it with work this week lol
[1:44 PM]  Sohalia: Boss got back from her vacation and has basically done nothing but whine since she got back.

Outside of work, things are generally good. [[K]] is slowly feeling better and is having more good days than bad.
[1:44 PM]  Sohalia: Which means we both are having more good days than bad.
[1:45 PM]  Sohalia: How about you?
[6:59 PM]  h0p3: I hope your weekend will kick butt.
[6:59 PM]  h0p3: Life is so much better when the boss is gone.
[7:00 PM]  h0p3: I'm glad [[K]] is feeling better too. I do not like that hunt at all. =/
[7:00 PM]  h0p3: I'm doing well enough. It's been an intense week.
[7:00 PM]  h0p3: Keeping my head above water so far.
