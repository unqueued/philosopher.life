Dear Laurel,

<<<
Hi h0p3,

So great to hear from you, please forgive my slow reply.
<<<

I'm happy to [[hear from you|Contact]]. Please feel free to take your time! I like that we can communicate asynchronously here.

Welcome to New Haven so soon! Exciting... I suppose if there's anything I recommend, it'd be the Yale Beinecke Library, which you should visit on a sunny day so you can see the sun shining through the marble from inside...
<<<

Thank you! I'm looking forward to visiting that library. I tend to like libraries and librarians a lot. My wife will be working as one up there, so that'll be cool. The sun and marble are important symbols for me, so I'm excited to see it on a sunny day. I appreciate the recommendation, especially since I'm not always terribly effective at exploring.

I actually live in New York (riding the Metro North one day a week up to New Haven) and only teach in the fall semester. But I showed your ever inspiring philosopher.life in my class this semester. We tried our own tiddlywiki to archive our writing exercises... http://suddenly.rocks/living-the-puzzle.html, if you're curious... it was our first time trying Tiddly...
<<<

I saw that. Super cool. The exercises looked fun too. I am curious, especially since I feel like a total outsider, lol. I hope more people try Tiddlywiki out. I'm hooked on it. You should check out https://sphygm.us/. I think that is the best Tiddlywiki I've seen.

p.s. Meant to ask... how do you like ProtonMail?
<<<

I like it; it's the best service of its kind I've used over the years. I also think protonmail is often much better than the standard e-mail alternatives. It's a practical tool (ergonomic for plenty of paranoids), and I admire many of its goals. I'm grateful for the opportunity to use it for free, and I think it's a non-trivial step in the right direction. I wish more people would use it. I realize it's necessary to have usually a few e-mail addresses, and having a protonmail account in the mix is a good idea.

Sincerely,

h0p3
