Laura Ekstrom’s Coherence Theory of Autonomy


Ekstrom accepts the basic picture of autonomy with which we’ve been working, which is that a person is autonomous with respect to a desire that moves her to act if that desire is authentically her own – if, as she puts it, it flows from her “self.”


But what makes a desire D authentically one’s own? For Frankfurt this was a matter of having the right second-order volitions. For Christman it was about not resisting the process by which D was formed. For Ekstrom it’s about D’s being supported by the right preferences.


For Ekstrom, a preference is:


…a very particular sort of desire: it is one (i) for a certain first-order desire to be effective in action, when or if one acts, and (ii) that is formed in the search for what is good.”


Preferences, then, are just second-order volitions that have been formed in search of the good.


Frankfurt’s mistake, she thinks, was allowing a person to form a second-order volition for any reason at all, which undermines its authority. For Ekstrom, by contrast, a person forms a preference for a first order desire only if she finds a first-order desire to be good.


Still, this account raises a number of questions, such as:


    Does condition (ii) rule out all that much (see 604)? Is it even rational to form second-order volitions without that happening in accordance with the good?

    What kind of goodness does Ekstrom have in mind? And are we talking about objective or subjective goodness?

    Why not form the preference in the search for who one is, as Frankfurt sometimes suggests? Why a goodness-based account over a self-discovery based account?


Even if this account works, there is still the question of what makes people autonomous vis-à-vis their preferences. Is it in virtue of some higher order mental state? No, says Ekstrom. That way lies a regress. The autonomy of your preferences, she claims, depends on how well they cohere with each other.


But then why not offer the same account of our desires? Why not say that a desire’s autonomy depends on how well it coheres with your other desires? Why bring in the idea of goodness at all? Or, if you’re going to bring in the idea of goodness, why not just run with that and drop the part about coherence?


Character, Self, and Autonomy


Your character, thinks Ekstrom, or your “self,” consists of your accepted beliefs and preferences (i.e. beliefs formed in pursuit of the truth and second-order volitions formed in pursuit of the good).


Why not think of your character/self as consisting of all of your beliefs and desires? Because your non-accepted beliefs and desires lack longevity, the power to individuate, and they’re not approved by you (see 606).


But then why not say that your coherent second-order volitions form your true self, whether or not they are preferences?

Assuming that these questions can be answered, we can then define your true self as the subset of accepted beliefs and preferences that cohere with one another. The thought is that some of your accepted beliefs and some of your preferences will form a tight, coherent set, and these are constitutive of who you really are.


Your preferences are authorized – sanctioned as your own – when they cohere with your other preferences and acceptances. The authorized elements of one’s character system should be long-lasting, well-supported by reasons, defensible against external challenges, and you should be able to act on them wholeheartedly and without discomfort.


Acting autonomously, on this view, is a matter of acting in accordance with your authorized preferences. These preferences constitute who we are, so when we act on them we are self-governed. Or so Ekstrom argues.


Questions and Concerns


    Ekstrom’s basic picture of autonomy, while quite typical, might be problematic because it runs together autonomy and authenticity.

    Ekstrom offers a model that’s partly coherentist and partly rationalistic. Why both? Why not drop the bit about reasons and the good and just embrace coherentism, or vice versa?

    On Ekstrom’s view a preference is autonomous only if it resonates with its bearer’s conception of the good. But the idea of the good can be interpreted objectively or subjectively, and either way there appear to be problems.

    Why not identify the self with all accepted beliefs and preferences, whether or not they cohere?

    How does Ekstrom’s account fare with respect to the three problems we’ve thus far encountered: manipulation, the regress, and the ab-initio problem?


Her coherentist approach seems to avoid both the regress problem and the ab-initio problem – everything bottoms out in the true self. But perhaps these problems resurface at the level of preference formation.


She also thinks that she avoids the problem of manipulation through an appeal to considerations of personal identity. But I’m not yet convinced that this works. Her account seems to permit a thoroughly manipulated person to be autonomous.


Lastly, on Ekstrom’s view, a second order volition becomes a preference when its bearer judges it to be good. But must that judgment be autonomous? Ekstrom suggests that that judgment should be made partly in accordance with one’s accepted beliefs, but unless these are also part of one’s identity it’s hard to see how they have the requisite authority. And if you already have an identity, why is it necessary to appeal to something else – i.e. judgments of the good – to elevate a second-order volition to the status of a preference?
