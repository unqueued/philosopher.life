title: 2020.01.19 - Prompted Introspection: Wish Everyone Would Learn

!! I wish everyone would learn to ?.. Then everyone would?..

Be as moral as possible in their contexts, then everyone would have a much higher chance at closing the gap between maximum eudaimonia and justified eudaimonia. I think justice would be far more likely to obtain, and we'd be far more satisfied (though hardly complete) creatures. I think we'd have more purpose, a sense of belonging, and a willingness to sacrifice.
