Welcome to the overt scheduler of my CPU! This is a simple implementation of practical {[[Dreams]]} algorithms. Here I plan for the future, even if only one day at a time. These are planned opportunities to advance in the grind of the computational game of my life. 

I cannot help but feel embarrassed by this directory. I know it shows my flaws so clearly. I am autistic, and my executive functioning is dysfunctional in ways that are not easy to debug and tease apart. I do not wield my excuse as an autonomy-defeater; I'm  pointing out how difficult it is for me to be well-integrated. 

I must tame myself with this log and overcome the dread of empathizing with my persistent identity. I have to earn it! Thus, here I climb Mount Habit. This is a way to make sure I just //get it done//.

Clearly, I engage in basic (almost atomic) legislative practices in this log. Writing it down enables me to hold myself self-accountable. Essentially, this is a thin internal power dynamics tool which provides checks and balances on the executive branch ruling over my city-state identity.

!! Principles:

* TDL := To-Do-List
* Rule/Step Zero on To-Do-List: Write your To-Do-List
* Write simple, quantifiable, tangible lists.
* Be honest, make sure you don't expect too much or too little of yourself.
* Try to write your To-Do-List for the next day before you go to sleep (it may [[help|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29058942]] you sleep).
* Work on least fun to most fun when possible. Do the hardest lifting first, and as your emotional muscles weaken, your tasks get easier and easier. 
* Don't expect yourself to complete everything. You aren't perfect. Prioritize and triage.
** Eventually, you'll acquire the skill of knowing what you can expect of yourself and improve from there.
** Don't forget to post-mortem via your [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum Logs]] and [[Wiki Review Log]]
* Maintain To-Do-List logs for different time-slices.
** Daily
** Weekly
** Monthly
*** This log's monthly audit can be used for the audit. I don't think I need to [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum Logs]] this one.

!! Dreams:

* Find a way to formally engage in long-term kinds of To-Do-List planning.
* Find an intelligent way to form To-Do-Lists for multiple contexts.
* Find a way to create "To-Stop-Lists." In a sense, part of what narrowing down what to do is through selecting what you will not do. Understand your opportunity costs.
