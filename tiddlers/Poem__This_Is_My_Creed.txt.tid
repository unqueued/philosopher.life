title: Poem: This Is My Creed
type: text/plain

This is my wiki. There are many like it, but this one is mine. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me my wiki is useless. Without my wiki, I am useless.        

I must write my wiki true.

My wiki is human, even as I am human, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strengths, its parts, its accessories, its syntax, and its semantics. I will keep my wiki clean and ready, even as it puts the lotions on its skin. We will become part of each other.

Before [[The Right]] I swear this creed. My wiki and I are the madmen in the desert. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the savers of my life.

So be it, until victory is [[The Good]]'s and there is no enemy.
