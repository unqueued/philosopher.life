title: 2019.04.10 - Afterschool Teaching: Books

When I arrived, maintenance had just finished the installation. No need for my tools, but I'm glad it got done. I set 9Tm and 9AM onto reorganizing the room. I think they weren't too happy with it, but I am grateful.

Whitney and I talked about how she and Matt do their data. They just make up the information, but they make sure basic attendance matches. I must be exceptionally annoying to them in this respect.

I took every kid that had homework and anyone else that wanted to come to the library. It was surprisingly quiet. I picked out books for 6AB, 8Gf, and 6CM. I am, unfortunately, not the most qualified person, but they need some help picking out [[salience]]. We talked about what books they liked and why, and we hunted for new books.

8Gf and I talked about Persepolis again.

Matt stopped in for a break. The other kids were driving him insane. I offered to go to them and have him stay in the quiet library. He turned that down. Hrm. I wonder what's going through his head.

5Am and I struggled together today. He found an error in his math packet. I was proud of him for providing proof. I'm trying to get him to not give up instantly when he doesn't see how to solve the problem. It's not a fun subject for him, I realize. 

I'm surprised by the roleplaying pretend games in my 8th graders. The others are petting each other. Wide range.

Matt initiated a conversation with us about 5CC's significant changes in mood, her fits, and her rebelliousness. He's paying attention, though his problem is an authoritarian one (primarily). We discussed the cliques forming and the dynamics of the girls in a particular group.

Oh, the lab is closed off to us again because there are "extra wires in the room which Dorsey doesn't want us to touch." That sounds like a terrible excuse to me, lol.

8Hm's mother came in again. Delp talked to me about her because he felt she wasn't quite right in the head and was delusional (probably lying too). The woman is clearly schizophrenic, and I tried to explain why we should empathize with her and how we might reason about her. When we get to a point where he recognizes the implications of me teaching him, he becomes uncomfortable; it is not befitting the conventional status he holds so dear.
