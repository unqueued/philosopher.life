title: 2018.06.18 - John Nerst: Maybe I'm Wrong

<<<
Hi again,

I didn't mean to say there's anything wrong with your approach to writing, for 'uploading your mind', so to speak, it seems the right approach. It's just hard to approach for others.

Interesting to hear you uses to do philosophy (although not too suprising given the mutitude of references), where and when? I was sort of drawn to it for 15 minutes or so, but picked something that could make me money instead :) Didn't study it much formally, my bachelor's thesis was in the context of my engineering education where we sampled a lot of social science and humanities courses and were to pick one field for a BT. I've only really taken Philosophy of Science (and History of Ideas which is obviously somewhat relevant).    

On dialetheism, well I skimmed that dense article a little bit and it seems a consequence of applying a logic framework to the non-logical-and-non-discrete-on-the-macro-level nature of reality. It's true in reality to the extent that semantics are fuzzy, not true in logic-world.

regards

John Nerst
