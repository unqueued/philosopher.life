title: Mathing: Linear Algebra

//So many good directions in here. Make the discovery process embedded in learning wisely connected to the most salient sources of guidance available to you. An autodidact must imaginatively and pragmatically curate their curriculum and advancement. Do you know when you don't know? Do you know how to find out? Should you do it? Are you going to do it? Figuring out how to ask the right questions is the hard part, but one must still learn how to find the quality answer efficiently. Grind.//
