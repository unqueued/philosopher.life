title: 2019.01.12 - Wiki Audit: New

As usual, I am behind on [[The Remodeling]] and instead jumping into new territory. I fear I will never strike the correct balance. There is simply too much work to be done.

I have realized that [[T42T]] requires I generate a more effective and articulate model of [[kickscondor]] for him too! I don't and I can't do it like he does, but I think he knows that. I'm glad to have the chance to engage in this. I am pretty goddamned worried I'm going to offend him right here. I strongly prefer to allow the modeling work I've got so far to continue its own path. Symbolically, however, I simply have no choice if I am going to do him justice; he has pressed the button, and now I must respond.

{[[Principles]]} and [[FTO]] have been modified in virtue of this project:

* Conversations are a sacrament.
* Break {Axiom}atic Reasoning down into Lemmas.

I have been wrestling with his words for quite a while now. I'm still fucking wrestling with them. The dude knows how to craft a powerful memetic molecule for me. I keep re-reading our words, and I do not have a satisfactory response in my eyes. How many humans on the planet can do that to me?

The [[Audit]] is a massive [[/b/]]ish catchall changelog. Hm. It's not forced in the same that the [[review]] is (even though I'm supposed to consistently do it, derp).

---

[[FTO]] continues to grow. I'm definitely feeling the pressure here. That has sucked everything out of me (and I am willing vessel!). [[Public Self-Modelers]] is a thing. I need to talk with people who are going to be engaged in the same practice.
