!! Audit:

* My predictions have been wrong very often.
* I'd like to thank you for speaking to yourself second personally.
* Tons of failure here, lol.
* Slave to my passions more than I'd like to be. Hard to fight that unconsciousness, though it reveals itself nicely in here.
* I like how I avoid talking about much of my work in here, but I also talk about normal mundane things too.
** I have no idea what makes for the appropriate patterns.
* [[FTO]] shows up here reasonably. 
** Also, I think the pinging will pick up after school is in session.
* It's been a helluva summer. The only money I made was getting our money back from the IRS. 
* I failed to find a job, but I did get some interviews.
* Emotional. I can see the whirlwind in here. 
* I'm coming to grips with what is in my control here, perhaps poorly.
