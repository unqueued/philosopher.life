!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

I'm doing well. I'm probably eating too much, and I'm having odd dreams. Also, I've noticed tingling sensations in my feet at night. I think it has something to do with how I'm laying at night. That's a bad sign. I have terrible circulation. 

I've been experiencing plenty of thought loops.

!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

I'm feeling anxious about my "next step." I feel a bit like I'm in limbo like I don't have a solid gameplan like I don't know where I am going, and I feel like I'm under significant pressure to know immediately.

Finding work hasn't been easy. I feel like electricians, mechanics, and welders have an easier time finding a job. I still have options. I'm not in an insane rush. But, our car isn't doing well. We have money, but it dwindles.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself.

I still don't have a solid grasp of this economic landscape. I don't know how things work. I'm still learning. I do have time to learn. It's okay to feel anxious! Use it as a motivational tool. Keep working hard!

It's important to maintain empathy for those around you while particularly the ones you love.

Welders either have the certs and can weld, or they can't at all. It's binary. In a way, you practice before you can, and then it floods in on you. It's also the only skill that I can practice on my own at home (once I get a machine). The others require a kind of field experience which one doesn't merely pick up in isolation. I feel like welding should be the art I learn on the side, even if it I may end up doing it for a living. But, I may be wrong! It seems to be the area I have the most to learn in right now.

!! What are you going to do about what happened?

* I will continue to try and get my Ethereum account back. I have a significant amount of money sitting in there. It was a very wise investment. Admittedly, I feel like it is too early to take it out still. But, we could use it!
* I will apply to the electrician's union.
* I will apply the boiler maker's union.
* I'll keep pushing in my welding. 
** I need to practice making roots.
