title: 2019.10.30 - Afterschool Teaching: Chill

Carson reads a lot of plays and poetry. She says she couldn't have survived high school without poetry and art. She talked about some of her favorites with (I am obviously beyond ignorant here). We talked about her fiance's preference for documentaries, and they too decided to watch //Love Island// as pure braincandy. 

Carson and Whitney asked me about my opinion on Matt's claims about 6NP's bullying. I confirmed their biases with my own.

One-on-ones were smooth sailing. I'm sad that most of my 6th graders aren't interested in a serious conversation. 6NP2 surprised me again. We talked about people being hell sometimes (6AJ was, of course, offended by the word). Other than that, it felt like Duck Duck Goose with 6th. They are the roughest bunch of the kids on average. Some people put up with my offputtingness better than others, and I'm not directly fun.

My children were loud, but respected each other fairly well. Lots of socializing, fairly chill, not as many games today. Lots of giggles.

MadameM has confirmed for me the friendships built in this program tend to form groups which last. Prisoners together, common experience. Makes sense. 

6JR started reading the Bible. Cool. He asked me how often I read it, and, dissatisfied, he asked me if I was saved. 6AJ joined. That did not go well for him.

Surprisingly, I had almost 20 minutes free at the end. I talked with [[gh057]]. He's ever gracious with me when I'm I have to come and go or can only afford to wave while I'm working. Talked about our loved young ones. I'm grateful to be able to listen to an older dad think about it with me. We talked about how our views have shifted over the years. Also, had to tell him that, according to Whitney, the "gh057"-like signature was 7CM's rap handle. I aim to confirm that to rule out possibilities.

I stayed late waiting for 5KP's pickup. I sat and listened to the extended adolescents speak. I had little to add to the conversation, as usual.
