title: The Red Pill

The Matrix is the best movie I've ever seen. It's worth studying. There isn't a real, philosophical system underpinning it, but it does a nice job of weaving together many important concepts. The new show Westworld has much in common, not just at a surface level (the experience machine), but for many other significant problems. As in every experience machine story, the Red Pill is always present.

The Red Pill is the catalyst to fundamental paradigm shifts in one's reality map. After taking the Red Pill, one can see the world as it "really" is (or at least as a step closer to the objective truth, or at least that is the faith in the Red Pill).  

The primary force behind the illusion of choice in our minds is a rewards system in our brains that runs on pleasure-inducing chemicals. In a way, happiness is reducible to the right configuration of sustainable IV drip of these chemicals (this problem of hedonic happiness definitions is an old one). Your brain already shows the choices you've made 2-4 seconds before you are consciously aware of it. We aren't consciously free because our subconscious is clearly steering the ship.

The Red Pill shows us that appearances can be deceiving on the scale of our reality map. The Red Pill itself, however, is still a kind of appearance. The Red Pill can be deceiving. When we attend to the Red Pill over time, we see we were right about some thing and wrong about others. Our reality map becomes inverted after the Red Pill, but then it has to settle down.

We each may experience many Red Pills of various sizes, shapes, and potency in our lives. The more radical the reality map the stronger the redpill.

I think one of the more important Red Pills is at the apex of the disagreement between the Marxist and the Libertarian, and both of these can be pulled in another direction that is psychopathic.

So, I think there is Psychopathic Marxism (hard to understand what it is, but I think this is the visual that people have) and Empathic Marxism (which is what I take Marxists to really mean by Marxism [No true Scotsman, let's talk about the nature of fallacies]). Similarly, there are Libertarians who have Empathy and those who don't.

Internet slang also includes: "being woke" (AF, etc.)

Heidegger called it "The Event"
