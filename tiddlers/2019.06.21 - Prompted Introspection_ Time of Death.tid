title: 2019.06.21 - Prompted Introspection: Time of Death

!! If you had the option to know the day and time of your death, would you want to know?

If that is possible to know, it would have something very significant to say about the nature of fatalism, truth, knowledge, contingency, and much more. You'd have to tell me about the nature of that knowledge, as it would surely be the most interesting aspect of the encounter.

I don't know how you could convince me that it was true, but let us presume you could really get me to "know" in that sense. The answer is: yes. I would want to know. It means I could take insane risks, plan against the clock, and have that oh-so-sweet ~~methamphe...~~ certainty which is surely what my amygdala craves so desperately.
