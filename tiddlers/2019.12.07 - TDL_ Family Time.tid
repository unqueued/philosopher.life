* Family Time
* Roast, veggies
* Our room is already getting slurped up into boxes, be useful to your wife's sorting.
* Coffeebliss
* Should consider remaining social engagements we might have before leaving.
* Activate the card
* You need to exercise. You've got some serious lifting to do in the next month, and you can't afford to be exhausted.
* Need to plan meals with [[AA]].
* Grafting would be nice.
