//I'm going to continue to practice this stack game and extend the notion.//

Son:

Island, crack disk. Mountain, Chalice@2. Disk. Draw pryo (omg). Island. Mutavault. Cracks disk, B2B<-REB<-hydro<-pyro. Mountain, trash. Flood, MAIN FoF(kp[3 island],[flood, FoF]), island.

He's not listening to me. But, we are getting the logistics of even engaging in this practice down better (which is necessary for him).

Daughter:

2 mountain, tomb, cavern, ruin, shusher, trash. Mountain. Island. Mountain, shusher (I want to sit on trash, to force it through). Island, BEB. Cavern, shusher. She thinks I have REB in hand because I left the mountain open ;P, Island and nothing else (she inquiries if I am screwing with her). I drop tomb (top boil, sitting on it). She hydros<-boil, bye shusher and islands. Mountain, trash. Island. Trash, mountain, swing. Island. Ruin, nin, we decided to remove the trashmasters to think about this card. Draw, go (forgot to ping). Draw, go, ping. Mountain. Island, B2B<-REB, ping. Mountain. AV, ping. 

We spoke for an hour about the game of life, controlling randomness, handling risk, and a fuckton of magic metaphors. I have a tool to talk with them; they can practice and distance themselves enough from it to use it as a lense. Acting on the maxim that their lives matter is the name of the game right now (obviously, that is true).
