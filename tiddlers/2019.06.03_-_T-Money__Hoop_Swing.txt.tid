What the f***?
MON 5:13 PM
This is why I want to f****** code name
MON 5:14 PM
The codename is up.
MON 5:14 PM
10-4
MON 5:14 PM
I'm driving so speech to text.
MON 5:14 PM
Did the dude have anything interesting to say
MON 5:15 PM
He's just having fun. I wouldn't take the part where he's teasing you and me too seriously. Perhaps sometimes he's an archetypal jester. He writes, "I know T-Money probably thinks I am teasing."
MON 5:18 PM
No that's fine. I just appreciate the code names
MON 5:18 PM
I've been very diligent and hiding my identity on the internet. It helps that there is a c-list Hollywood actor named Trent Moore
MON 5:19 PM
How are you and what are you and what are you up to
MON 5:19 PM
Stop trying to stalk me on the internet [[h0p3]]
MON 5:29 PM
I'm flipping hidden
MON 5:29 PM
Actually I show up on the White Pages. And of course my Facebook but it's supposed to be not searchable.
MON 5:30 PM
Sorry, had to go pickup my wife.
MON 5:30 PM
I am lucky that none of my mugshots made it to those mugshot sites
MON 5:30 PM
You're fine man I'm just driving and wasting time
MON 5:31 PM
Lol. I bet your mugshots are amazing.
MON 5:31 PM
Well there's three of them somewhere in the system
MON 5:31 PM
I just got lucky that while in Berea Madison County wasn't posting to those websites back in 06 or 07. And then the Georgia incident was me as a minor so they probably would have got in trouble. However my buddy that I got arrested with in Georgia had the guy print out another mugshot and put it in his pocket for him was it while he was handcuffed

That hoop swing looks like a blast.
MON 6:12 PM
The hoop is actually a tire of the old day wagon wheels. I found 2 in crab orchard Amish country for $25 for both.
MON 6:14 PM
Aye. You showed me.
MON 6:14 PM
My grandpa's neighbor had one. Still does. Me and my cousins woukd spend hours on it.
MON 6:14 PM
That is a good use of them.
MON 6:14 PM
Apologies. I forget. It  is! I have to move this one. But I have to do some pruning with my pole saw. To move it. But I got it up just so sam wife and  and I could play with it.
MON 6:16 PM
The other one I have to weld the overlap joint and grind it smooth. It has a small catch. Easy fix. Putting it in front yard
MON 6:17 PM
Then I'm done with swings. And then my kid will never use them again.
MON 6:17 PM
Lol
MON 6:17 PM
Lol
MON 6:17 PM
I got the house free. I'm gonna write you a letter. It is gonna be dumb. And silly. Prepare yourself. I am not going to defend shit.
MON 6:41 PM
I am preparing my butthole as we speak.
MON 6:42 PM
I love getting letters.
MON 6:42 PM
It might be a dying art.
MON 6:42 PM

MON 6:56 PM
Here's your key:

Everything else is on your side.
MON 7:25 PM
