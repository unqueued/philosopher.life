title: 2019.09.21 - Prompted Introspection: Finest Education

!! What?s the finest education?

Standard [[gfwiwcgws]] and particularized contextualist questions have to be answered. I assume being surrounded by a broad set of geniuses who love you, resources to open any doors and experience damn near everything, and avoiding the radical tolls of poverty (which isn't to say a fine education doesn't require the experience). Saint Aristotle is correct about the value of education, especially since [[phenomenologically]] we experience, on average, half of the passage of time of our lives before we are 19. I think the vast majority of education ends a few years after our frontal lobes have developed and our perspectives have crystallized. 

I am, of course, interested in an elite education for my offspring in particular. There's a lot of barriers to such a thing for them; we do what we can with what we have. Motivation and hope are difficult to come by. The disease of the educated is ugly. We know even if we do everything right, we're still in a fuckton of trouble.
