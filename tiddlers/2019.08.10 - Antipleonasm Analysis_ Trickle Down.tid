title: 2019.08.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Trickle Down

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The 'trickle-down' theory: the principle that the poor, who must subsist on table scraps dropped by the rich, can best be served by giving the rich bigger meals.
<<<

I've seen probably a dozen similar metaphors.<<ref "i">> The more insidious variants artificially narrow the tree of possibility to show that global utility is maximized only under capitalism as some brute asserted fact. They will point to all progress and say capitalism is the cause. Further, capitalism, apparently is the best way to help the global poor because we should blindly assert the truth of egoism, right? Denying our metaphysical ability to do otherwise serves to eventually eliminate our political ability to do otherwise and hold those in power responsible.
