title: 2020.03.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Diabetes Runs In Family, But Don't Give A Shit Because No One Runs In My Family

* Woke at 11
** Outstanding sleep.
* When I came downstairs, my son was excited to tell me about what he had accomplished. 
** Among them, my son has fixed his problem by using macchanger with a cronjob. Lol. What an ugly, terrible, functional hack. GJ.
*** Let us not understand, just make it work. That is my life.
** It is one of the highlights of my parenting to hear my son say "I spoofed it" to me.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Chats
* My daughter is taking control of dealing with her art teacher. 
** She's cautious in thinking about her messaging. 
*** I am reminded of how fucking stupid I was at her age by comparison. 
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** He puked! Seems okay.
** He's taking care of the baby. Long day for him.
* Dialecture
* [[vidyas]]: Moar Graham Priest
** More disagreements too. 
* Thinking about our [[Family: Battle Language]]
** What an odd design opportunity.
* [[Animal Consciousness]]
** I wasn't able to focus well, sadly.
** Discussions were //sick//. Leet. 
** Also, SEP has blackedlisted my IP for multi-threaded downloading their site. Offspring and I have set up proxies and rules.
* Ribs, wedges, asparagus
** Son helped me prep. We moved at full speed today.
* Talked with [[JRE]] again! =)
** I need to watch //Dave//.
** We cracked up, lol. 
** He has adjusted his sleep schedule. 
** Rebecca is busy with lots of webinars and meetings.
** I'm so glad that my brother is enjoying IASIP.
* Talked with [[AIR]]
** We both laughed and cried.
** He's got a lot on his plate.
** I have missed him a lot. Glad to be back together.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
* Talked with [[AIR]]
** He spoke with my offspring during [[h0p3ful Review]]
*** He's one of the only people in the world who can see them so clearly. He's seen 'em grow up.
** He's helping some foreign coworkers who have been cast-aside by their corporate sponsors. They have no where else to go, and they are staying with him.
** I have no idea how to compress or express everything we said. 
* Tiktok
* Read+Write
* //Dave//
* Sleep by 3
