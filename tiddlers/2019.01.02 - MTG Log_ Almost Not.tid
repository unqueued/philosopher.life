//The offspring are driving me insane. I'm worried this carrot isn't working well enough.//

I coached my children today. This was a valuable use of our time. Talking non-stop while we play prevents them from taking excellent notes, but I've decided we'll push some notetaking in a sidewindow (so they can keep their eyes on it). This isn't how I do it. I just bounce between workspaces, but I have enormous advantages for taking notes here. I can afford it, and I don't mind the practice either. They aren't ready for it; just getting anything on the page is already hard fucking work for them.

The magic games were spectacular. They continue to learn a lot about magic and themselves (and the world...these are fantastic opportunities to engage in philosophy). Once we have the discipline to stop making mistakes huge mistakes with Goblins, we may eventually be in a position to really, really construct. I wish I could get them more interested in doing this systematically. Understanding how to search for cards (and why!), reasoning about the functions of the deck, and understanding the metagame will become key notions for them. We are going to learn [[The Dialectic]] at this level come hell or high water.
