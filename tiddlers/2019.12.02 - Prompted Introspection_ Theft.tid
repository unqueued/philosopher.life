title: 2019.12.02 - Prompted Introspection: Theft

!! What advice would you give to someone who stole something but now feels guilty?

It depends on the circumstances. Without knowing much more, I'd say they should give it back. There are instances of what is called theft by a lot of people that I don't think count. For example, there's a lot of homeless people who I don't think have done anything wrong by walking into a Wal-mart and getting something to eat without the permission of the employees. You'd need to provide more context for a more particularized answer here.
