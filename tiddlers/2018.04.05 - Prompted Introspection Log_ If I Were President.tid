title: 2018.04.05 - Prompted Introspection Log: If I Were President

!! What would you do to change the country and the world for the better if you were elected president?

I'd get elected on Friday / Assassinated on Saturday / Buried on Sunday

Executive power is a complex topic. It's a shifting landscape. On top of this, we have serious philosophy of law problematics to contend with, such as: what is the criterion of the law in a constitutional crisis? I'm not sure what I ultimately could accomplish, nor if I should use my power that way.

I'd aim for socialism, the decentralization of power. That's it. If a pornstar wanted to fuck me, that'd be great too (would change my world, lol).
