title: 2019.11.16 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Really Dreamy

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Reality is for those who cannot face their dream.

False. Reality is for everyone insofar as seeking what is [[salient]] in reality is for everyone (and it is!). That's what we're doing in philosophy. I like this nifty one-liner. Obviously, one's dream is part of reality, so this sentence is rhetorical. I suggest this points to a convenient slip I find in pragmatism which doesn't shoot for an exceptional ideal. Where one draws practical lines can all too often simply be wielded as an excuse not to seek what really matters outside of our comfort or desires. The reach of possibility is far more radical than most people recognize and choose to recognize.
