!! What is “home” to you?

Home is wherever you originate or belong in a given context. Currently, for my everyday context, that is my apartment in Johnson City, TN. It's with my family, my computer, my cats, my things, and the life we build together. Wherever it is that we move, we move our home with us. I suppose this is the standard answer, but it seems obvious.

The "belonging" aspect of "home" isn't quite addressed here though. I will say that I feel most at home in the Appalachian region though. It's a place where I feel most comfortable being an alien. In this sense, I guess I don't feel like I truly belong anywhere. I'm the wandering foreigner wherever I go. What is home to the alien, to the nomad, to the wanderer? I don't exactly know. It sounds like an oxymoron of sorts. 

There is something missing. I can tell you that. I don't have the right orientation toward the world around me.
