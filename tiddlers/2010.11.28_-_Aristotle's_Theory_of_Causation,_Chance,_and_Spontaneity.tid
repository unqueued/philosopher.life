title: 2010.11.28 - Aristotle's Theory of Causation, Chance, and Spontaneity

//--In Memory of Ian Crystal//

Aristotle holds ontology to be primitive to epistemology; his theory of the four causes, chance, and spontaneity are no exception. The four causes, in particular, are part of the conceptual link between the ontic and the epistemic. Without this theory of causation, in the eyes of Aristotle, the world would cease to be intelligible. The //Physics //(where we first see a description of his theory of causation) in some ways is a study of being qua movement, and Aristotle’s conceptual framework for this study is understood in terms of the four causes. He is clearly interested in describing change and motion (and defending these against the Eleatics), demonstrating the relationship between potentiality and actuality, aiding in the explanation of being and non-being, and justifying his account of essentialism and teleology. 

As an essentialist, Aristotle is deeply concerned with making sure we do not conflate the accidental with the essential. While he recognizes that the existence of the physical world is immediate and obvious (almost like a brute-fact), it seems as if natural sciences, which are studies of what is beyond that which is immediately obvious, require an explanation of change and motion. Before he goes on to give us this explanation (his theory of causation), Aristotle provides us a distinction between natural and artificial substances. This distinction will be further demonstrated within his causal theory as well. He explains:

<<<
Of things that exist, some exist by nature, some from other causes. By nature the animals and their parts exist, and the plants and the simple bodies (earth, ﬁre, air, water)—for we say that these and the like exist by nature.<<ref "1">>
<<<

<<<
All the things mentioned plainly differ from things which are not constituted by nature. For each of them has within itself a principle of motion and of stationariness (in respect of place, or of growth and decrease, or by way of alteration). On the other hand, a bed and a coat and anything else of that sort, qua receiving these designations—i.e. in so far as they are products of art—have no innate impulse to change. But in so far as they happen to be composed of stone or of earth or of a mixture of the two, they do have such an impulse, and just to that extent—which seems to indicate that nature is a principle or cause of being moved and of being at rest in that to which it belongs primarily, in virtue of itself and not accidentally.<<ref "2">>
<<<

That which ‘exists by nature’ is a natural substance and that which is a ‘product of art’ is an artificial substance. Natural substances, as the name implies, are the sorts of substances which exist in nature and without an agent to change them. Conversely, artificial substances are generated by artists and do not occur naturally. Artificial substances could not exist without natural substances because the latter are the necessary preconditions and materials required for a technician to generate the former. 

Importantly, the difference between natural and artificial substances isn’t just a question of origin, but also a question of the nature of change and motion which inheres in each of these kinds of substance. Change occurs when a substance loses and gains accidental features (e.g. change in place, etc.), and the internality of change and motion differ between natural and artificial substances. An essential aspect of a natural substance is the principles of motion and change which are internal to it. Artificial substances don’t have these principles internal to them insofar as they are artificial, but they do insofar as they happen to be made of natural substances.  

This distinction between natural and artificial substance heeds Aristotle’s essentialism. Change is essential to the natural substance, but change is accidental to artificial substance. In analogous juxtaposition, change (as a principle) is essential (to the world), but change (of a property in a substance) is in some way accidental. These differences are further explained by Aristotle’s causal theory.

In further consideration of change and motion, in explaining being and non-being (including the passage into each), and in order to provide a foundation for the sciences (linking the ontic to the epistemic), Aristotle sets out a conceptual framework for causation. He explains:

<<<
Knowledge is the object of our inquiry, and men do not think they know a thing till they have grasped the ‘why’ of it (which is to grasp its primary cause). So clearly we too must do this as regards both coming to be and passing away and every kind of natural change, in order that, knowing their principles, we may try to refer to these principles each of our problems.<<ref "3">>
<<<

Let us first realize that this question ‘why?’ is fundamental to Aristotle’ teleological structure. In coming to acquire knowledge about the world in a complete sense, we must be able to fully answer the question ‘why?’. His causal theory is going to demonstrate how we can fully answer the question ‘why?’ regarding anything which is intelligible and how it is central to the link between the ontic realm and the epistemic realm.

So, any successful and coherent investigation of the world, according to Aristotle, requires that we understand the causes and teleological ends of things in the world. If it wasn’t possible to provide an explanation for the question ‘why a thing exists as it does?’, then the world wouldn’t be intelligible. Aristotle thinks this particular view of his is somewhat unique. While giving partial credit to his predecessors (e.g. the Monists and Plato) concerning this topic, he claims they had only vague notions of the causes (e.g. Plato is accused of only believing in material and formal causes), and that he alone is able to provide the true account of the causes.<<ref "4">>  In this, he is also alluding to limits to the viability of the scientific inquiry of his predecessors because they lacked an adequate theory of the causes.

One other major point of context to his causal theory that we need to consider is the word ‘cause’, which needs to be interpreted carefully and fleshed out.  Aristotle’s understanding of the word ‘cause’ (//aitia//) is broader than the modern sense; it might be thought of as an explanation (a broader term in modernity). ‘Cause’ is likely the better word because the connotation of ‘explanation’ misleadingly emphasizes an epistemic view of substances, which fails to highlight the primacy of ontology in Aristotle’s worldview. The word ‘cause’ (overall) might then best capture both the ontic structure of (Aristotle’s) reality and how we understand the world. Lastly, and at the risk of redundancy, a crucial component to understanding Aristotle’s view of an adequate theory of //causation //is realizing that he is setting out the conceptual framework for a teleological explanation of things. His essentialism and teleology are arch motivations in providing his account of causation. 

There are causes for all substances (else, they wouldn’t be intelligible). Aristotle answers and explains both the ontic and epistemic ‘why’ through four causes: material, formal, efficient, and final. He explains the first cause:

<<<
In one way, then, that out of which a thing comes to be and which persists, is called a cause, e.g. the bronze of the statue, the silver of the bowl, and the genera of which the bronze and the silver are species.<<ref "5">>
<<<

Here, Aristotle introduces the first cause, referred to as the //material cause//. It is the matter which comprises a thing. The material cause is the matter which is the subject of change. The material cause is “that out of which” a substance is made and explained. An example of the material cause of a natural substance would be the flesh and bone (material) which comprises the matter of Socrates (substance). Take a house as an example of an artifact (artificial substance); its material cause is the wood and bricks of which it is constructed. Note that the natural wood of a tree and the bricks’ natural clay and minerals are the subjects of change. These are examples of primary substance (‘primary’ as understood in his categories); the material cause of secondary substance, however, would simply be ‘matter’. 

Importantly, matter can be viewed in two ways, both as physical stuff and also as potentiality. Matter only has no meaning outside the other causes; it is only conceptually discreet in our minds, but never truly independent of substance and the other causes. The wood of a tree is potentially a bed, but it is not actually a bed simply because it is wood. The carpenter manipulates wood to receive the form of bed. Conceptually linked to the idea of potentiality, the shape and form which matter takes on will lead us to Aristotle’s next cause; he explains:

<<<
In another way, the form or the archetype, i.e. the deﬁnition of the essence, and its genera, are called causes (e.g. of the octave the relation of 2:1, and generally number), and the parts in the deﬁnition.<<ref "6">>
<<<

Aristotle introduces us to what we call the formal cause. The formal cause is the definition of a thing. It is the shape and form that matter takes on. 

Aristotle’s essentialism seems emphasized in the// formal cause//. The essential features of a substance, those things which are necessary conditions of a substance’s being, comprise its formal cause. Aristotle thinks you really can’t answer ‘why?’ a thing exists as it does without understanding the essential characteristics of a substance. Clearly, the formal cause is necessary to give an account of the shape and form (//eidos//) of a substance. These first two causes are central components of Aristotle’s //Hylomorphism//, the notion that a substance is a composite of form and matter.  Consider that while the material cause of the bed is wood, it is the shape and form of bed-ness that the wood takes on which counts as the formal cause. Note how material cause alone isn’t sufficient to causally explain the bed, and the formal cause is also a necessary ingredient (though the sum of just these two aren’t sufficient either) in the causal explanation.
	
The formal cause does have a special relationship with the material cause, but it can also be understood to have a special relationship with the final cause (which we will get to in a bit). At this point, we can at least see that the formal cause points out Aristotle’s distinction between potentiality and actuality. In fact, the formal cause is exclusively potentiality. This form is, however, associated with something’s actuality. Each of us has the form of human being inhering in us, and as a consequence, we are human beings. You can’t just ‘potentially’ be a human being.  The relationship between the formal and final cause demonstrates part of the relationship between Aristotle’s conception of potentiality and actuality, the formal cause being analogous to potentiality.

The formal cause of a house is the definition of a house, namely, a shelter constructed for people to live in. The formal cause of a secondary substance would be its species. The formal cause of a man is being a rational biped. Note that in answering Aristotle’s ‘why?’, these definitions in themselves (insofar as this cause is conceptually discreet from the others) are strictly potential and not actual instantiations of substance at this point in the causal process.

Peculiarly, the formal causes of natural and artificial substances differ. The formal causes of natural substances are definitions which are independent of agents and technicians. Just because a person doesn’t grasp the definition of horse does not mean that horses don’t exist or that they lack formal cause. The definition of horse is external to our human minds, and the definition does not exist in virtue of us in any way. Unlike natural substances, the formal causes of artifacts are in some way dependent upon agents. The formal cause of an artifact is in the mind of the technician who generates the artifact. It is the definition of an artifact which is dependent upon being in the mind of an agent who possesses the corresponding //techné//. So, the ‘idea of the house’ inheres in the house-builder who applies the techné of house-building to construct the house. This example nicely leads us to Aristotle’s next cause:

<<<
Again, the primary source of the change or rest; e.g. the man who deliberated is a cause, the father is cause of the child, and generally what makes of what is made and what changes of what is changed.<<ref "7">> 
<<<

This is what we refer to as the //efficient cause//. The efficient cause is that source which literally causes a thing (in the modern sense of the word ‘cause’). An efficient cause could be the agent of change and motion which brings about a thing. Clearly, Aristotle’s efficient cause is much closer to what we normally understand a cause to be because it encompasses the preceding agent (the cause) whose acts and motion bring about an effect.

Consider examples (some of which aren’t as easy we might initially assume): parents are clearly the efficient causes of children (natural substances), easy. For secondary substance, the efficient cause is conceptually there (difficult to see though), namely, God is the efficient cause as the highest principle (although he isn’t the creator of the species, as we think in the Judeo-Christian tradition). The efficient cause of a house would be the house-builder applying his art of house-building. Oddly enough, in describing the relationship between what is potential and actual, we come to see that there might be several ways to describe the efficient cause of a thing (perhaps especially so for artificial substances). Aristotle explains:

<<<
All causes, both proper and accidental, may be spoken of either as potential or as actual; e.g.  the cause of a house being built is either a house-builder or a house-builder building.<<ref "8">>
<<<

<<<
In investigating the cause of each thing it is always necessary to seek what is most precise (as also in other things): thus a man builds because he is a builder, and a builder builds in virtue of his art of building. This last cause then is prior; and so generally.<<ref "9">>
<<<

Given the possibility of having multiple ways to describe a thing’s efficient cause, we should be careful in selecting that which is truly essential (and not accidental) to being something’s efficient cause. In consideration of the above passage, and in an attempt to discern what is essential to being the efficient cause, it seems that at least in part, the art of the technician is the efficient cause of an artifact. If this is the case, then while we can say the house-builder applies the art of house-building (and thus he is somehow part of this process), the house as an artifact exists in virtue of the art of house-building which inheres in the mind of the house-builder. So, perhaps, the efficient cause of the house is to some extent the art itself, even though the art’s existence is dependent in some way upon inhering in the mind of artist. Like the difficulty in making sense of the efficient cause of secondary substances, describing the efficient cause of artifacts is not as straightforward as moderns might initially assume.

Note how the efficient cause directs us to Aristotle’s teleological worldview. The efficient cause is clearly linked to the steps of a thing’s coming into being. The house-builder uses particular materials instead of others, pieces together the various parts of wood and brick in a certain form or shape, and employs his art by using specific tools of his craft in a certain way. While these three causes are often the only sorts of things that many people would consider to be a ‘cause’ of a thing, they are not complete and they are independent of the end. Aristotle thinks there is more required to answering the question ‘why?’. Clearly, the first three causes all have purpose, and all the steps in this causal process exist in virtue of the teleological end. Thus, Aristotle completes this conceptual framework with his fourth cause:

<<<
Again, in the sense of end or that for the sake of which a thing is done, e.g. health is the cause of walking about.  (‘Why is he walking about?’  We say: ‘To be healthy’, and, having said that, we think we have assigned the cause.)  The same is true also of all the intermediate steps which are brought about through the action of something else as means towards the end, e.g.  reduction of ﬂesh, purging, drugs, or surgical instruments are means towards health. All these things are for the sake of the end, though they differ from one another in that some are activities, others instruments.<<ref "10">>
<<<

This is the// final cause//. The final cause is the teleological end and the realization of the definition. It is the formal cause actualized. You can’t overstate Aristotle’s reliance upon the final cause in this teleology. We should note the stark contrast between the potentiality of the formal cause and the actuality of the final cause. Obviously, the formal and final causes are inextricably linked. The final cause of the house is the actuality of the house, where people live in it and use it as a house. For secondary substance, the final cause is the realization and actual existence of those species. The final cause of man is an actual rational biped. There would be no purpose in talking about the other causes if you didn’t have the final cause, the actual substance.

Granted, the final is perhaps the most controversial of the causes for some critics (and Aristotle spends time trying to defend his final cause). The fourth and final cause seems the most essential of the four causes; arguably it has the highest explanatory status of the four causes. Change, motion, potentiality, matter, and form are not intelligible outside of what is actual, namely the teleological cause, the end, the final cause. The process of generation is for the sake of (and can only be properly explained and understood by) the actual end. Aristotle’s primacy of ontology is clearly demonstrated in the significance of and emphasis on the final cause.

Connecting the causes together, we can see that Aristotle wishes to answer the question ‘why’ about all substances using this teleological theory of causation. In doing science, and in making the world intelligible, we must employ this causal framework. Aristotle’s theory of causation provides a structure to make sense of being and non-being, chance and motion, certain vital components of the relationship between potentiality and actuality, and his teleology and essentialism at large.

After Aristotle lays out his theory of causation, he considers the implications (and possibility of) small elements of randomness in the world and those things which are unintentional, unexpected, undetermined, and coincidental (which initially might seem problematic for his teleology). He refers to this as chance and spontaneity. It is fitting that this section comes after his four causes because, of course, we should have serious questions about the nature (and explanation) of what might be random and indefinite within his teleological framework. How do you make sense of what is coincidental in such an end-based and purpose-filled view of the universe? (I daresay this question remains a damned good one.) Aristotle attempts to show the dependent relationship of chance and spontaneity upon the four causes. Interestingly, his construction of this account is also deeply motivated by a desire to have a middle path between the extremes of determinism and a skepticism which claims the world is utterly, entirely random and chaotic. Crucially, if chance and spontaneity cannot be explained by the causes, it seems as though the world, to some extent, is unintelligible. To start, Aristotle gives us some informal criteria for what sorts of things do not qualify as chance. He says:

<<<
First then we observe that some things always come to pass in the same way, and others for the most part. It is clearly of neither of these that chance, or the result of chance, is said to be the cause—neither of that which is by necessity and always, nor of that which is for the most part.<<ref "11">>
<<<

Things which consistently come to pass are not usually the sorts of things which we deem to be events of chance or spontaneity. The sorts of things which always come to pass in the same way, or even for the most part in the same way, are softly determined, so it isn’t much of a leap to say that these can’t qualify as chance or spontaneity. So, things which do not come to pass for at least the most part are the sorts of things which can qualify as either chance or spontaneity. Aristotle explains what else is necessary for chance (as opposed to spontaneity):

<<<
Of things that come to be, some come to be for the sake of something, others not. Again, some of the former class are in accordance with intention, others not, but both are in the class of things which are for the sake of something.  Hence it is clear that even among the things which are outside what is necessary and what is for the most part, there are some in connexion with which the phrase ‘for the sake of something’ is applicable.  (Things that are for the sake of something include whatever may be done as a result of thought or of nature.) Things of this kind, then, when they come to pass accidentally are said to be by chance.<<ref "12">>
<<<

Chance is clearly about being ‘for the sake of something’, in accordance with intention, requiring an agent (e.g. man), and, most importantly, it must be accidental. Chance requires an agent, and it is in part a description of the accidental and random events which cross the path of an agent. Aristotle gives us his example of chance:

<<<
A man is engaged in collecting subscriptions for a feast.   He would have gone to such and such a place for the purpose of getting the money, if he had known.  He actually went there for another purpose, and it was only accidentally that he got his money by going there; and this was not due to the fact that he went there as a rule or necessarily, nor is the end effected (getting the money) a cause present in himself—it belongs to the class of things that are objects of choice and the result of thought.  It is when these conditions are satisﬁed that the man is said to have gone by chance. If he had chosen and gone for the sake of this—if he always or normally went there when he was collecting payments—he would not be said to have gone by chance.<<ref "13">>
<<<

The man went somewhere intending to do X, and it just so happened, by accident, that he also happened to fulfill a different end, namely getting his money (which wasn’t X). The man chose and intended for X, but an unintentional effect was getting his money. In this case, when the man crosses paths with a person who owes a subscription for the feast, neither person had intended, in each of their cause paths, this transaction of money; rather, the ends, the ‘for the sake of’ which they had started on their paths,  were about something else altogether, with different purposes and ends. It is only by accident that some other purpose, the ‘getting of money’ for this man, is somehow accomplished on his way towards something else. Clearly, chance (and spontaneity as well) requires two paths to cross.

Note how the causal chain of the man can be described by the four causes. The path that each man took and the teleological structure of their intentions are clearly understood and made intelligible by the four causes. It is only when two (or more) distinct causal chains just by happenstance overlap, and strictly at the point of contact of that overlap, that there can possibly be an occurrence of chance or spontaneity. Aristotle continues:

<<<
It is clear then that chance is an accidental cause in the sphere of those actions for the sake of something which involve choice. Thought, then, and chance are in the same sphere, for choice implies thought.<<ref "14">>
<<<

The sorts of accidents which are related to choice and reason are different, in some way, from what is spontaneous. Insofar as this accidental or indefinite occurrence is the result of the choice of man, then it is said to be chance. Aristotle elaborates on the differences between chance and spontaneity:

<<<
They differ in that spontaneity is the wider. Every result of chance is from what is spontaneous, but not everything that is from what is spontaneous is from chance.<<ref "15">>
<<<

Chance events are a subset of spontaneous events. The distinction of spontaneous events of agents from non-agents makes a great deal of sense when we consider the significance of reason and choice in Aristotle’s cosmos. Aristotle seeks to differentiate agents with reason and choice throughout his teleological system, and his division of chance and spontaneity continue that mode of thought. The argument continues:

<<<
Chance and what results from chance are appropriate to agents that are capable of good fortune and of action generally.  Therefore necessarily chance is in the sphere of actions. This is indicated by the fact that good fortune is thought to be the same, or nearly the same, as happiness, and happiness to be a kind of action, since it is well-doing.  Hence what is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance.  Thus an inanimate thing or a beast or a child cannot do anything by chance, because it is incapable of choice.<<ref "16">>
<<<

<<<
The spontaneous on the other hand is found both in the beasts and in many inanimate objects.  We say, for example, that the horse came spontaneously, because, though his coming saved him, he did not come for the sake of safety. Again, the tripod fell spontaneously, because, though it stood on its feet so as to serve for a seat, it did not fall so as to serve for a seat.<<ref "17">>
<<<

Obviously, the indefinite aspects of inanimate objects seem to fall into this category of spontaneity, but it isn’t so obvious (without context) why children don’t count as having choice. Note that while children are human, they aren’t (in Aristotle’s understanding) fully developed humans, and they haven’t fully reached their ends as rational bipeds. In lacking elements of reason and choice, the sorts of accidents which they happen upon aren’t chance, only spontaneity. Aristotle clarifies even further:

<<<
It is necessary, no doubt, that the causes of what comes to pass by chance be indeﬁnite; and that is why chance is supposed to belong to the class of the indeﬁnite and to be inscrutable to man, and why it might be thought that, in a way, nothing occurs by chance.   For all these statements are correct, as might be expected.  Things do, in a way, occur by chance, for they occur accidentally and chance is an accidental cause.  But it is not the cause without qualiﬁcation of anything; for instance, a housebuilder is the cause of a house; accidentally, a ﬂuteplayer may be so.<<ref "18">>
<<<

<<<
Spontaneity and chance are causes of effects which, though they might result from intelligence or nature, have in fact been caused by something accidentally. Now since nothing which is accidental is prior to what is per se, it is clear that no accidental cause can be prior to a cause per se. Spontaneity and chance, therefore, are posterior to intelligence and nature.  Hence, however true it may be that the heavens are due to spontaneity, it will still be true that intelligence and nature will be prior causes of this universe and of many things in it besides.<<ref "19">>
<<<

Chance and spontaneity are parasitic upon and understood through the four causes. We might call them pseudocauses because of this. There are causal explanations for each of the crossing paths, and Aristotle says in order to even begin to understand the nature of the crossing, we must first describe the causal chains through the four causes. The four causes are a precondition to the pseudocauses, chance and spontaneity.

Chance and spontaneity can only occur when two independent causal chains meet or cross by happenstance. The exact point of contact of two causal chains is where chance and spontaneity occur and have meaning. Notice that without two causal chains meeting at a crossroads, there would be no chance and spontaneity. That is also to say then that without the four causes, no causal chains would exist, and thus no events of chance and spontaneity would exist; this is why they are called parasitic upon the four causes.
Similar to Aristotle’s example, an example of a chance would be my going to the store to buy some chips. The end I am seeking is to buy chips. Now, by happenstance, I run across a guy to whom I owe money at the store. Importantly, my creditor had come to the store to buy pretzels. Neither of us had come to the store for the purpose of meeting each other; neither of us had come to the store intending that I pay my debt there. We both had different ends in mind. It was mere chance that our independent causal chains overlapped at the store. It just so happens that I am required to forego my chips to pay back my debt that night. 

Crucial to this picture of two (or more) paths intersecting by happenstance is the underlying causal structure which is a necessary prerequisite to making sense of what has happened. You can explain my path to the store via the four causes, and it had nothing to do with my creditor. You can explain my creditor’s path to the store through Aristotle’s theory of causation, and it likewise had nothing to do with my paying my debt. Without the four causes, we’d have no paths to consider in the first place.

The four causes explain our activities and independent causal chains. It is only at the point of contact of our independent causal chains, whereby I am unexpectedly forced to repay my debt, for example, that we can understand Aristotle’s conception of chance. Spontaneity falls in the same vein of reasoning, the difference being that it isn’t the causal chains of agents; rather, it describes the above for non-agents.

It is important that Aristotle took the time to describe chance and spontaneity. If chance and spontaneity were too prevalent and too important to the world, and there was mass chaos and pure randomness, then we couldn’t do science. There would be point to it. Too much randomness is obviously against the intelligibility of the world which Aristotle deems to be so crucial. If there was no chance and spontaneity in the world, however, then everything would be determined, which is a supposition Aristotle wishes to avoid. Aristotle’s description of chance and spontaneity as being parasitic upon the four causes is a middle path between these extremes.

Aristotle helps give a more complete causal theory by including an explanation of chance and spontaneity. He is responding to his predecessors, and he is also providing a way to make sense of a world with both teleological ends and elements of indeterminacy. The inclusion of an explanation of indeterminacy is also significant because it makes it somewhat more difficult to criticize his teleological view, as it remains fairly self-consistent as an argument in general and also capable of answering the question ‘why?’ in a wide variety of circumstances. 

Aristotle’s theory of causation in conjunction with the pseudocauses, chance and spontaneity, provide the groundwork for the intelligibility of the world. These notions clarify and explain how Aristotle conceives of potentiality and actuality, the passage into and out of being, chance and motion, particular aspects of his essentialism, and his deeply-rooted teleology.
