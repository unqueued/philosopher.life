Someone who has mastered a tool has made it an extension of himself, a ready-to-hand neural-network-to-hammer integration into his identity. My computers are literally a part of who I am. In a way, they are deeply embedded in my virtue-theoretic [[fastmind]]. I like to think they make me more powerful in many ways, although they have certainly weakened me and cost me in others. I would like to call my 4D cybernetic identity: [[Monster-Φ]]. Can [[h0p3]] have another name? There is nothing functionally illogical with it, but perhaps it isn't prudent.

What if we say [[h0p3]] is most like the identity of an era, just as [[4eak]] and [[gdoghomes]] were. We may feel like we're in Residual Self-Image territory, but I think it's still quite meaningful. Perhaps Monster-Φ is definitely the story of the hardware. Different OS versions live on it over time.
