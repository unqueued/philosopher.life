title: Wiki Litmus Test

//Here you face my vindicating shadowboxer proxy//

I sift humanity for persons, and I sift persons for real friends who empathize with me. I lovingly denounce you all, and now I will see which relationships matter. I take no prisoners in my [[Wiki Litmus Test]]; it is the only safe option now.

We must engage in science with each other to understand the theory of each others' minds, especially to approach meta-dyadic accuracy. This is a sane way to think about those around me. I guard my approval-seeking with avarice because it is prudent. If you don't like my wiki, then you don't like me. That is obviously true. I suggest there's a non-trivial chance that you aren't justified in not liking at least some aspects of my wiki. 

If we are not friends, then here is a [[Poem: Realpolitik Speculation]]. I'm not here to be your doormat, and hopefully, you aren't here to be mine. I'm done playing useless language games with others, at least for a while. Perhaps I'm the hermitic persona non grata, but I worry you willingly choose to be xenomemephobic. Perhaps you have objectively put forth more effort into being a good person than I have; perhaps you are just flat out better at being a person than I am. I'm listening to your argument. Let us draw the lines in the sand together.

I entreat you: come wander the desert with me; travel down the rabbithole. It's easy to dismiss me; and, it's hard to empathize with me. I'm profoundly weird at times, and I know how you treat aliens. Thus, in my [[T42T]] approach, I aim to be forgivingly retaliating in our game-theoretic attempt at cooperation.
