!! Audit:

* I got my OSHA-10 Card
* I definitely did a ton of reading and writing.
* Wife made no headway on SQL, and I'm going to give up asking her. It's up to her.
* I did play some D2, but ended up stopping for the most part.
* The house did have some major fixes, although it still needs more I think.
* I didn't find a job, but that's okay. It would interfere with the trip my wife planned.
* Overall, I did a worse job on my monthly TDL this month (compared to last). I think I've been having that trouble for a while though.
* I'm pleased to have done so much reading this month.
* I did complain about the toilet, but nothing came of it.
* My son got his tools set, but now they just sit there.
* The door was fixed.
** I had fun doing that with my son.
* I've spent a lot of my TDL's telling myself to encourage my chillun. I think I did a good job at this. By the end of the month, they were kicking butt.
* I dealt with the rent increase and our checking account.
* It's interesting to see me schedule Informing the Men! time...I was generally relaxed about it over the course of the month, I believe.
* I planned to swim several times, and I often failed to do it.
* I ended up not planning meals in advance as much in TDL, although I usually knew our options and had them basically prepared.
* I had several days invested into IJ.
* I helped a stranger online, ghostheadx9. I wish you luck, stranger!
* I had some trouble digging into IJ. It's a tough book.
* This month was grindy.
* I feel like some of my [[Wiki Audit]] content is embedded in here, but I don't have a problem with that.
* I was pleased to help ALM's family. I hope they will use their newfound access to books wisely.
** I suspect that his insistence on joining the sync swarm was because he was worried I'd give his wife books he wouldn't approve of (that she would be "allowed" to read). 
* I didn't end up doing the AWS thing. Ought I?
* I definitely started several projects and didn't close them out. That's okay. This is the shotgun approach.
* That steak was amazing. I'm glad k0sh3k had a birthday!
* Several days I anticipated the need to call out to others. I'm glad when I did. It's important to systematically stay in touch.
* Two days this month I wrote my TDL late in the evening. That almost defeats the purpose of it.
* The trip was a focal point of this month, pretty clearly.
* My TDL's have been short, less productive somehow than I'd have hoped, and often only partially completed. Well, I must capture myself honestly, failures and all!
