* Very few changes, despite my efforts. Fuck. 
** Probably not exploring hard enough, as usual.
* Subs have to be surprisingly generalized without being generic.
* It's expensive to cover this much ground, but I don't see a better way.
* [[Link Log]] died during this gap.
* [[Straussian]] metativity about [[The Great Human Conversation]]. I avoid a fuckton of the theater here, but I do hear very different tales from these people.

Out:

* BreadTube
** [[S2NR]] is far too low, especially for something which dominates my attention like video. If you aren't hyperreadable, you better  be god himself. It has the podcast problem.
* Ithkuil
** Cool, but not important enough. Glad to see it is evolving.
* LateStageCapitalism
** Consumed. Top 100 current posts, only one ended up mattering to me, and it was only humor.
** LateStageImperialism seems better for now as well.
* lewronggeneration
** Schtick can be consumed via Top. Waste of my time.
* FaithFormation
** Just going to stick to her wiki for it.
* thethread
** Nope. Wasn't useful a single time.
* WorstGeneration
** Cute garbage
