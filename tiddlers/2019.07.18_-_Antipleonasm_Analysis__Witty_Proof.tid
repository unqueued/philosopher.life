A witty saying proves nothing.

ROFLMAO. Voltaire may never be literally correct, but he's accurate, recursive, and cuts off almost all the fat. Obviously, there are witty sayings which prove something, and this sentence, even if it must be read [[Straussianly]] is proof of it's opposite. This is much like the liar's paradox. Voltaire thrives on conservational implicature. I think he's straight fucking trolling quibblers like me.

I adore how he's destroying rhetoric with rhetoric here. 10/10, homie.
