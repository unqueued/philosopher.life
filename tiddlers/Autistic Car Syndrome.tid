title: Autistic Car Syndrome

Imagine some dude in the movies or cartoon who has owned his beatup junker jalopy for a long time. He knows all the ticks and oddities about it. Nobody else can start the car because you have to hit the dashboard at a specific spot, push the gas pedal halfway while turning the keys 3 times, etc.

It's a Rube-Goldberg machine, of sorts.

It's a wonder that the car can even be operated because it's in such disarray and poor shape.
