title: 2017.08.13 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up late.
* Fireman Time!
* ARAM-marathon
* Archer
* Surfed
* DCK Meditation
* Talked to my brother JRE
* Talked to ALM. Was a short conversation. He had to go, and I think he felt really awkward. 
** I believe it is possible he has not been paying enough attention to the changes in my beliefs over the past decade (something I have struggled with myself, no doubt). I've tried talking to him before about it, but our conversations stopped being conversations; I think he often does not wish to debate with me. The idea that I am right is terrifying to many people. I'm now someone he cannot empathize with very well.
** He was also very uncomfortable with the cognitive dissonance I'm experiencing. 
* Worked on the car
* Took my wife to her workplace and back for a small errand.
* Brownies were made. My daughter did the baking, I was her helper.
* Fried chicken, fries, and salad. Delicious.
** Smoke in the house because the oil cooked too much. Took a while to air out. =)
* Family time. 
* Bed.
