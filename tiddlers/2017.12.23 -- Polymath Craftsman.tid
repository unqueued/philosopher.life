My wife's steampunk watch-locket's hinge axel broke. I fashioned a new one from a push-pin and a couple pliers. This was tiny, and I'd need an absolutely tiny welding rod to hit it (I don't have a machine though). So, I superglued both ends of the hinge with a toothpick as my application/brush. I got the glue deep in the hinge and applied multiple coats. I had to flex the hinge to make sure the mid-piece wasn't glue, just the ends. It turned out perfectly.
