How goes it?

 It goes.  It had been a awful busy week.  In the back yard giving [[Jop]] a hand with some gardening.  You caught me taking a break.  This morning was wonderfully cool and we both sat outside in front of the house drinking coffee and having some rice soup.  A most excellent morning and one I have been looking forward to all week.  In my opinion, for where I live, this could be called the first day of fall.

 Very nice.  The relaxing morning has been very much needed.  Work, especially on Friday, was a zoo.  We were so amazingly busy and I basically was doing the new job work all day without a space between.  Quite stressing.  Some things I am getting better at, but still very much to learn.

 [[Jop]] wanted me to ask you why you are so mean.

 Some of the pictures from the hurricane we're quite shocking.  We got lucky it didn't come our way.

 So, I never heard your reasoning for the advice you gave me. What are your thought?
