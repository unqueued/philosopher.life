Yesterday, I ate a clock.
SAT 9:35 PM
It was very time consuming
SAT 9:35 PM
Especially when I went back for seconds.

lol
SAT 9:36 PM
the third but really makes it -- I laughed at the second sentence but was not expecting the last one
SAT 9:36 PM
*the third really
SAT 9:36 PM
That's exactly what I thought. It's the third strike that takes me out. I've been thinking about which puns click with me. That appears to be one method.
SAT 9:37 PM
I can't say much for Reddit, but I really appreciate a good pun thread
SAT 9:40 PM
Yes. The voting mechanism makes the threading for competing responses exceptionally good for chaining puns.
SAT 9:41 PM
What do you think about Reddit?
SAT 9:42 PM
I have such a hard time finding good replacements. Maybe I should do more RSS work by hand than I do.
SAT 9:42 PM
I like it most when I'm obsessed with a certain topic and spend a lot of time in that specific subreddit. Eg. when a game comes out and I'm first binging it, I'll spend tons of time on the game's subreddit when I'm at work. I also liked the knitting subreddit when I was more heavily into that hobby
SAT 9:46 PM
Yes. That's often how I enter into new things.
SAT 9:46 PM
Quick Top read, sidebar, maybe a wiki (rarely), and then passively collect...unless I'm obsessed, then I binge it alongside.
SAT 9:47 PM
Gag as I might, it's unfortunately also a source of news for me.
SAT 9:49 PM
I don't know what to do about it.
SAT 9:49 PM
.../r/all is basically where I get news. But I also just...avoid seeking out the news in general, so I don't know where I would go were I seeking it.
SAT 9:50 PM
I can't say I'm good at looking at the news. I cut out most of the usual. I assume the real stories aren't in there, and if it's big enough, it overflows into everything.
SAT 9:52 PM
I need a place for news about where to get news.
SAT 9:52 PM
(afk, tv time :P)
SAT 9:57 PM
