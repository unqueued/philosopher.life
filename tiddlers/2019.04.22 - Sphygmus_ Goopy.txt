10:39 AM] h0p3: I'm checking in. I hope you are doing well. You have a good Easter?
[3:16 PM] robotic_scarab: thank you for checking in! I know I've been pretty quiet on the wiki front...still catching up every few days with your wiki reviews, and popping around the rest of wiki town.
[3:18 PM] robotic_scarab: I'm doing well, though I don't quite know what I'm doing. I don't feel stuck but I'm not exactly un-stuck, either.
[3:18 PM] robotic_scarab: the goopy-ness of your recent /b/ tiddler really hit home reading it today
[3:20 PM] h0p3: I have noticed you've been really quiet, but you have been on my mind. It sounds like you are thinking and working. It sounds like a season of life to me (not to reduce it).
[3:21 PM] h0p3: Thank you for noticing the goopyness, lol. It's an odd experience for me. I think understanding gunkiness is part of the visual structure I'm supposed to look for.
[3:22 PM] h0p3: Thinking about analytic binary machinescapes and fluid, unified, rhizome gunkiness in dialectics with each other.
[3:23 PM] h0p3: What hit home?
[3:24 PM] h0p3: Also, what have you been up to for fun, if any*?
[3:27 PM] robotic_scarab: yes, thinking and working and letting things hibernate and grow under the surface.
[3:27 PM] h0p3: Germinating. Digesting. Growing that forest.
[3:27 PM] h0p3: Hope you have many wild flowers too.
[3:28 PM] robotic_scarab: it is really that time of year!
[3:29 PM] h0p3: :smiley:
[3:31 PM] robotic_scarab: it was emotional to read your mention of kicks and I in your state of stream of consciousness; and it reminded me of poetry, full of really juicy adjectives and sensory words. also I LOVE HAVING THE RIGHT TO BE GIBBERISH. is important and good because I'm feeling like I'm always trying super hard not to be gibberish ever.
[3:36 PM] robotic_scarab: I was really deeply into productivity porn etc through my teenage and to some extent college years, all that "optimize yourself" (and here are the 10 best ways to become the most productive capitalist cog) buuut I don't think I ever totally believed in the rabbit hole. and peeling myself out of it and - I really don't want to go to extremes, but to figure out how to live here & now with what is while also being free to act and resist? I see that in the dialectic between analytic binary and fluid rhizomes.
[3:38 PM] h0p3: It is a balance I cannot say I have begun to understand. I am not mentally well as a person in so many ways, some for justified reasons others unjustified. I realize my approach is crazy. Lol.
[3:39 PM] h0p3: I can see why you are not using your wiki, and it sounds like a good move to me.
[3:40 PM] robotic_scarab: I almost hate the thought of starting new projects now, because my mind then immediately goes to "well how could this turn into a monetized side hustle?!" and that feels yucky and kills the energy so fast. I don't think I've directly been avoiding my wiki because of that, but it's a knock-on effect, probably.
[3:47 PM] h0p3: You know after a couple months of using my wiki, I had a {[[Donate]]} page. For a while, I thought I was going to monetize it too. I'm glad I went a different direction with my goal. I totally understand the capitalist infection in the projects and narratives of our lives. If I understand you correctly: you are in decontamination and oscillation into a quiet season of (and I hate that I'm using this word, but it's the only one I've got) organic growth to settle what matters to you, going with the flow, and trying to resist being just a ludological quant machine and not a gooey qualitative story. It sounds like a crucial part of the [[Self-Dialectic]] to me. There's something profoundly right about it, and I'm not good at putting my finger on it (in part because you sometimes just can't, despite however hard we must try [[irwartfrr]] all the way down particularized to our context, etc.). I'm translating and thinking for myself here, but it's my goal to understand and feel it too.
[3:47 PM] robotic_scarab: yes, that sounds exactly right
[3:49 PM] robotic_scarab: actually, because of kevin, I subscribed to robin sloan's newsletter, who recommended the book "How to Do Nothing" recently, and I went and picked it up and started it over the weekend. only through the first chapter and part of the second but I'm both enjoying it and pondering it
[3:50 PM] h0p3: Noice. Do you think it would be worth my time, or should I leave it alone?
[3:51 PM] robotic_scarab: so far I'd say it's definitely worth your time
[3:53 PM] robotic_scarab: I think the writer does a good job of taking into account many facets without losing her aim
[3:54 PM] robotic_scarab: not sure if that's a thrilling recommendation for it, but I also think it's a book I'm going to reread (which I don't do often)
[3:55 PM] robotic_scarab: and of course I'd be interested in your thoughts on it. :)
[3:56 PM] robotic_scarab: for fun I've been getting outside a whole lot more; exploring the city with letterboxing, which is like geocaching but with stamps and puzzle clues! it really appeals to both of my interests in the visual and in mystery. I've also been doing a lot of hiking in the trails in the woods near a lake by my boyfriend's house -- there's a big well graveled trail, but also these tiny dirt path trails back and forth and around it and I'm slowly learning my way (and adding them to openstreetmap).
[3:58 PM] robotic_scarab: hiked about 6 miles on them yesterday, then sat at a tiny nook I discovered by the lake and read; startled a black snake on my way down to the sitting spot, then much later it (or another one like it) slid across the rocks behind me - and a second one! I also learned all snakes can swim, as I saw a third one toodle across the lake with its head stuck up, straight for shore.
[3:58 PM] robotic_scarab: lots of chunky bees looking at the holes in the hillside, not sure what for
[3:58 PM] robotic_scarab: it was a good time!
[3:59 PM] h0p3: Gonna ILL the book. May be something [[k0sh3k]] and I both read. Thank you for the recommendation.
[4:00 PM] h0p3: it sounds like getting out into the world is doing you some good!
[4:00 PM] h0p3: I am reminded of Heidegger when you talk about it.
[4:01 PM] h0p3: It sounds like a blast too.
[4:02 PM] h0p3: Chairman Meow recently caught a snake and brought it (living) into the house.  Poor snake.
[4:03 PM] robotic_scarab: omg, that must have been quite the ride for the snake.
[4:06 PM] h0p3: Aye, the cat was kind of freaked out too. We got a picture of it. Also the letterboxing reminds me of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game, Pokemon Go, and also a oneness with nature (even a mildly urbanized one in some cases). You have been going places. There is a great deal of evidence that it's necessary for us to do so. I need to do that too.
[4:07 PM] h0p3: Sitting in my clipboard manager: My k-holes are wonderfully emotional. I don't know how to describe what that trip is like. Psychedelic dissocation that helps with my depression (and my anxiety to some extent) is like jumping into another universe and self.
[4:08 PM] h0p3: REDACTED
[4:09 PM] h0p3: Also, snek: http://bookwyrm.philosopher.life/#Friday%2C%2012%20April%202019
[4:10 PM] robotic_scarab: awe! that's a pretty one
[4:10 PM] robotic_scarab: first topic: yes! I got lucky and a local artist actually planted 26 different letterboxes around my metro area - they're small painted altoid tins with magnets, and it's unnerving yet thrilling to reach blindly into a hiding spot to find the thing! It's also wonderful to be led to the city's hidden places that aren't touristy.
[4:13 PM] h0p3: Ha, I never really thought about how it might be unnerving. Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
[4:13 PM] h0p3: There is a cool risk in it.
[4:13 PM] robotic_scarab: there's even a TV Trope for it! https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandInTheHole
TV Tropes
Hand in the Hole - TV Tropes
The Hand in the Hole trope as used in popular culture. So. There's a hole in a wall or floor filled with an impenetrable, inky blackness and the vague …

[4:14 PM] h0p3: Lol!
[4:15 PM] h0p3: That is delightful. Reminds me of a story of [[JRE]] who stuck his hand into a hole with bees. It is a weird story in our family, we even have a song about it (which I never sing because I don't want to make my brother feel bad about it).
[4:16 PM] robotic_scarab: second topic: it sounds both exciting and scary! on the one hand the reported effects of psychedelics sound like something I'd be interested in exploring (cool visuals w/some & the letting go of ego etc of some) but at the same time I'm not sure I want to phenomenologically experience my brain as affected by something outside of myself? even though intellectually I know that it's affected by SO much outside myself, and even phenomenologically to some extent I am aware of hormonal affects on the brain - still, idk, it's weird
[4:17 PM] robotic_scarab: and thank you!
[4:17 PM] robotic_scarab: actually, you'd asked this question a while back and I hadn't answered it yet - about substances
[4:19 PM] robotic_scarab: for the last two years of college and a few after that, I definitely enjoyed drinking and getting drunk - the social lubricant part was huge for me - but now I get an enormous headache after one drink :(
[4:19 PM] robotic_scarab: it's interesting to observe how that stopped being a part of my life
[4:20 PM] robotic_scarab: unexpected and not really planned, just... stopped drinking
[4:22 PM] robotic_scarab: I tried weed a couple times after college...never did anything for me that I wanted to pursue further
[4:23 PM] robotic_scarab: my boyfriend got a wild hare and decided he wanted to try LSD microdosing, so picked up a few tabs off the dark net, got the whole light proof bottle & distilled water/vodka setup going on. I've been taking a pretty small dose of that every so often and it's been interesting
[4:24 PM] robotic_scarab: mostly interesting in that I couldn't tell you if it was a placebo effect or not, other than my knowing that I am ingesting an actual psychoactive substance
[4:25 PM] h0p3: I have never tried LSD microdosing. It is possible I will be gifted some soon enough. I may have to do that.
[4:25 PM] h0p3: Lol, that may be part of it. From my light reading on the topic, I am convinced it actually does something.
[4:26 PM] h0p3: I don't mean a third of a standard deviation of Big5 openness change within a 12 hour experience, but it's also not nothing from what I undersatnd.
[4:27 PM] h0p3: It sounds like you are wise about how you use substances.
[4:27 PM] h0p3: Harm reduction, engaging in reflection on it, hedged-conservative.
[4:28 PM] h0p3: I do not think ketamine is a fun substance to use; it's an emergency tool when the other options fail. It's a sledgehammer for treatment resistant depression, suicidal ideation, etc.
[4:31 PM] robotic_scarab: I would agree that it's done something for me, but subtly enough that I can't point the finger straight to it! :)
[4:33 PM] robotic_scarab: I have to thank my parents for being generally reasonable about substances. the occasional sip of wine when I was young and glass of beer as I was older - I presume that helped form my approach.
[4:34 PM] robotic_scarab: though I went from quite judgmental about partying and drinking at 18 to enjoying the experience quite a bit once I hit 21. nice cognitive-dissonance moment, ha.
[4:34 PM] h0p3: Removing the forbidden fruit, practice with the [[phenomenology]], and good habits from the beginning. I'm teaching research and harm reduction to my children as well. I prepare for the fact that it is highly likely they will use.
[4:35 PM] h0p3: I had that cognitive dissonance as well. I grew up in a household in which it was evil. Understanding moral drug-use has been a steep climb for me.
[4:37 PM] h0p3: I'm asking my kids to wait until their front lobes are more fully formed before they take the psychedelic openness reset and have their fully rational autonomy available to redefine and shape themselves in the gunkiness.
[4:38 PM] h0p3: My wife gave me my first drink (Eve is my love). I hope to eventually not drink again.
[4:41 PM] robotic_scarab: that is a reasonable ask, from my perspective. I'm grateful I got to things later than most of my peers, even if I do feel like the odd one out sometimes because of it.
[4:42 PM] h0p3: They have tried many kinds of alcohol though, and we talk a lot out about these industries.
[4:44 PM] h0p3: It sounds like you have been busy and flourishing to me, btw. Sounds like a good balance between the stuck and unstuck.
[4:45 PM] h0p3: The mutable and immutable, perhaps.
[4:45 PM] robotic_scarab: the mutable and immutable, i like it
[4:45 PM] robotic_scarab: and thank you for reflecting with me :) it can be hard to have perspective while in the weeds of things.
[4:46 PM] h0p3: It is my honor and a pleasure.
[4:49 PM] h0p3: Also, you clearly do the same for me. I am grateful for your thinking with me. You definitely make me know I'm not alone. I really appreciate that.
[4:50 PM] robotic_scarab: it's got nothing on the real thing but: O=(^_^)=O :)
[4:51 PM] h0p3: O=:smiley:=O
[5:19 PM] robotic_scarab: oh! i'm also starting to have i3 muscle memory attempts while on non-i3 computers
[5:19 PM] robotic_scarab: I'll be working on one screen and attempt to mod+# to the browser and catch myself like - waaiit that doesn't work here
[9:23 PM] h0p3: That is the worst-best feeling, lol. When I get onto any other machine, I feel like I'm trapped. Why won't this thing work!?
