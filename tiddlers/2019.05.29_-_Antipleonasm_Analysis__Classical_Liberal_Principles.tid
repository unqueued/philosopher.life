title: 2019.05.29 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Classical Liberal Principles

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Thomas Jefferson, the leading Enlightenment figure in the United States, along with Benjamin Franklin, who took exactly the same view, argued that dependence will lead to "subservience and venality", and will "suffocate[s] the germs of virtue". And remember, by dependence he meant wage labor, which was considered an abomination under classical liberal principles.

The word //liberal// is borderline unusable in this context. I'm not convinced "classical liberal principles" are logically consistent. I give Saint Aristotle a huge pass, but have you seen his work? Jefferson and Franklin aren't even in the same fucking league, and they have a few thousand years to be opposed to slavery from the beginning (though Franklin proved more rational). I think they meant to selectively decentralize power in a convenient fashion, and I think their influences are not nearly as morally justifiable as we like to think (and yes, moral motivation is fundamental). 

I know, I know: but what-about contemporary neolibs and neocons who claim to adore Enlightenment figures but hypocritically oppose the fundamental ideology? Yes, I agree, egoists are bad people, and today's [[pright]] love taking credit for the achievements of yesterday's [[pleft]].
