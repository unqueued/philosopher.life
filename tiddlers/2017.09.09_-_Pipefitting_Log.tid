title: 2017.09.09 - Pipefitting Log

We took extra time to get through a different gate. We also have new Yates badges, signing in and carding.

Dave didn't lead the morning meeting. A new pipe foreman did. 

I asked if we were going to finish the fitup from yesterday. I was told no by Chris-M. I got our gear for the trunion. Immediately told we were switching to fitup, lol.

I got my harness, untangled some drop cords and waited. Still no oxy torch for the cut we were waiting on. They did it by Metabo. 

Eventually, I was asked to put a ratchet strap on so we could twist the pipe. I am not convinced this will work. I think moving the elbow at the top is the best option. Rope, yo!

I talked to Greg a lot this morning. He has a unique perspective on the field. He recommends HVAC or electrician if I can't get on at Eastman on BAE through Thompson. He has also regretted traveling. He says the quick buck wasn't worth it.

!! Break!

We fitup the pipe. I just helped position. It took a lot of hands several hours.

I asked Dave for a list of his tools. I probably have everything he recommends, but better safe than sorry.

!! Lunch!

Tina, Chester's wife, brought pizza for us coming in on Saturday. That reminds me of the glad-handing "We appreciate you" bullshit. This is manipulation.

!! Break!

We took down some rigging off the pipe we fitup. We took down a giant tarp (I have no idea why it was there in the first place). My wire cutters were quite useful. 

I talked at length with the new pipewelder/fitter Oliver. He was homeschooled, as are his kids. The usual conservative story. He is fairly intelligent in some respects, although clearly uneducated. We talked about a great many things.

I took our gear back to the tool room.

I struggled to find anything to do. Chris-M helped me out by having me take measurements of pipes and label them against the isos. I didn't get far before Dave asked me to clean.

We are cleaning early today.  We are preparing for the hurricane/tropical storm coming our way. Additionally, we have to make room for an exceptionally large train coming through on Monday.
