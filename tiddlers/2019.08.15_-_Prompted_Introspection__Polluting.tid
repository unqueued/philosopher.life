title: 2019.08.15 - Prompted Introspection: Polluting

!! What is your opinion of people polluting the environment?

I've written on similar topics: 

* [[2017.11.05 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
* [[2018.02.16 - Prompted Introspection Log: Polluting]]
* [[2018.03.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: Pollution]]
* [[2019.01.12 - Prompted Introspection: asdfl;kjasdf;lkj]]
* [[2019.03.21 - Prompted Introspection: Helping The Environment]]

I have little to add here. There are always costs in the material dialectic; it's a basic law in physics. Pollution for whom and what? Even if we were to buy some transhumanist future (and I begrudgingly admit possibility here), biological computers are the only scalable solution. We have to pollute, but there is at least one best way given our context. I don't know anyone who doesn't pollute, but some are aiming to follow [[The Golden Rule]]. I'm not able to give a blanket statement.
