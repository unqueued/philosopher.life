title: 2017.06.13 - Wiki Review Log

* [[Summations, Brief Explanations, and Valuable Paragraphs]]
** I need to reorganize that part of my wiki. I care about those collections. I use them.
* [[2017.06.12 - Carpe Diem Log]]
** This is an interesting log. Not all of them work, but this basic one seems quite reasonable. 
* [[2017.06.12 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** You know, I'm fine keeping it shorter. Exploring futility is something I should do only when I'm really up to it. Pointing it out I should always do though.
* [[2017.06.12 - Diet Log]]
** Summed.
* [[2017.06.12 - Wiki Review Log]]
** I didn't end up writing more. Lol. But, upon reflection, I think it's fine. Sometimes a lot will spill out, and sometimes none will. I can't hold myself accountable for always delivering an incredible wall-of-text. That's okay. Do your best.
* [[2017.06.12 - Pipefitting Log]]
** I'm glad I kept trying. I should take that as a lesson to never give up.
* [[Carpe Diem Log]]
** We'll see how it goes, eh?
* [[Social Engineering Principles]]
** Fill your toolbox, pray you never have to use some of them.
* [[2017.06.12 - Link Log]]
** I've noticed I've been surfing less. That's okay.
