title: Dave Chappelle's Redpill Conversion

After his crisis, he stopped doing comedy. He stopped participating in public life. His recent work, however, demonstrates an extremely strong redpill perspective, even moreso than his previous work.

I must admit that I feel a kinship with Dave Chappelle. I don't mean this in some delusional celebrity sense. Of course, we see parts of ourselves in others. It is inevitable. I think my crisis, of course, was different from his. However, he is obviously an intelligent man struggling with many of the same problems I have. I have long thought that comedians were informal philosophers and statesmen in disguise. 

He has found himself again. He really understands the evil of the world and himself better. His commentary is even more obvious in this respect.
