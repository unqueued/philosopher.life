title: 2017.11.22 - Prompted Introspection Log: Least Favorite Chore

!! What is your least favorite chore and why?

Define chore. I feel like a chore is a small thing. There are much larger kinds of jobs I have to do that are more worrisome and difficult for me than small chores. That said, I'll stick to the standard meaning.

Dealing with the cats. I don't like cleaning up their shit or puke. I also don't like putting their harness on them (or taking it off). I don't mind taking them outside or letting them in so much though. I like petting the cats, but I don't enjoy having to take care of mammals beyond my moral duties.
