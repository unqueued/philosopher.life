title: 2019.11.04 - Afterschool Teaching: Communion

Carson and I talked about moving around, social awkwardness, autism, her brothers, health of her family, her dog, and more I can't remember. We had what I would call my preferred normal conversation I have with normies. She even full-blown laughed a few times. That's fairly uncommon in my experience. 

Whitney stopped in for a bit. She found a cat! I am lucky to be armed with cat jokes from the interwebs. Further, I teased Whitney about permanently having to take care of this animal she didn't want, well, until she told me she was going to shoot it (yikes, wtf) if it scratched her dog (she's trying to find a shelter for it).

One-on-ones were mechanical. It's to the point that if a student wants to talk, I don't need to throw a can-opener at them, they just start talking, and I listen. I still ask anyway. I know I'm sometimes the only person who asked them how they are doing that day. I like to tease them about patterns in their answers which aren't embarrassing to them (though they pull me aside for many topics). It's also one of my goals to demonstrate how remembering their stories and connecting the dots over time with them is part of what they should look for in a friend.

My hoods and I had a good time today. I offered a word of caution to 6KA about how he can rhetorically entertain me instead and get away with quite a bit more (it's a way for him to break rules more constructively). I found out 7CM got up in Carson's face (after doing the same with another student). Damnit, girl. You know better. Like a reaper-guardian, I took my toll from her. She's going to apologize for that, even if she doesn't mean it (8J helped here; he knows she just needs to do it and get it over with). This is important practice for her. We practiced reasoning about it, considering what sincerity sounds like, editing it down to a sane radio edit soundbite (she couldn't help herself the first few drafts, understandably), and walking through how she will handle responding to rebuttals (I'm holding my breath hoping she'll hold her tongue). 8J is going with her as support and peer-chaperone, as she requested.

I caught students reading e-books on their phones (ye fekin weerdoz). We immediately went to libgen for bookmarking and pirating. They asked for porn sites, but I can't do that for them. Sorry, even I have my limits. Ask me anywhere else, sure. Go search.

My oldest students are having fun on their less-censored phones. I'm glad they prefer their own devices here (though I wish these were laptops instead). I love to see them huddled up together around the little rectangles which feed them crack, interacting with each other (and sometimes even me) over this life-affirming bread. It is our communion. It is the least favorite students of all the teachers who stay with me to be with each other; it is among the highest honors I know here. Music is up loud so they have cover, the door locked to buy us time to shuffle should the authorities intrude.

I have students playing the programming games on their own today. DO IT! My favorite part, beyond not having said nuffin to get them to start, was watching them bang their heads against the keyboard until they found the answer. My wrastlers, please don't give up.

5DB2 and I had a special moment. He saw that many students were breaking the rules (I'm the only person bringing folks to the lab). He's a boy who will even blindly follow rules, and so I told him more explicitly than I ever say to my other students. As usual, if he were my son, I'd be fighting for him to break the rules too. I asked him to quietly enjoy the freedom. I'm gonna miss that kid.

I actually connected with 5TB after he found out I was leaving. End of the day, no energy to feed off of but me, and he decided to converse. Cool. Hope that trend continues with him.

7CM made the apology. It was good to hear Delp defend the girl and recognize the difficulties she faces (while still holding her to a standard).
