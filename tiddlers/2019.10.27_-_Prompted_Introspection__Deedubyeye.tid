!! What do you think should be done to keep people who are under the influence of alcohol off the road?

I'm such an asshole on this one with people.

I was, of course, having a good day when I wrote: [[2018.02.09 - Prompted Introspection Log: M(e)ADD]]. There are systemic problems which must be addressed. There are some basics I can drop though: [[Gradual]] escalation, progressively scaled costs (you know, because for the wealthy, laws are just fees one pays to the government for a license), perhaps directly taxing alcohol sales (I'd be sad), restorative justice (though 12-step programs are a joke) and trying to resolve underlying conditions which might cause someone to do this, community service of taxiing drunk people around (free ride if you pwn the breathalyzer), and enough fucking MADD drunk-driving accident eyebleach to scar them for life (I suppose absurd escalation here requires VR games in which they are forced to play as themselves killing their own loved ones?). 

Obviously, there's good money to be made here instead.
