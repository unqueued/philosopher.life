MON 5:49 PM

MON 5:50 PM
He and the foreman got there and the boss stuck out his hand and said that it "looks great brother"

Felt like passing a test :sweat_smile:
MON 5:50 PM
Sounds like it. I am not surprised you passed. Hopefully, they will start trusting you more.
MON 5:51 PM
I'm getting sick. Still functioning, but I don't think they want me to come to work. They are quarantining me, lol.
MON 5:53 PM

MON 5:55 PM
So ill have that and try out a newish video game
MON 5:55 PM
Cool. What game?
MON 5:55 PM
Fallout 4
MON 5:55 PM
Played it before, but lots of mods out now
MON 5:56 PM
Will be like new then.
MON 5:56 PM
ever seen one of the fallout games?
MON 5:56 PM
they are all in the same engine since fallout 3, which means that they all kind of suck as far as combat goes
MON 5:57 PM
its clunky and hard to aim
MON 5:57 PM
however, the combat strategies can be fun and building char is fun
MON 5:57 PM
Seen it. Never played.
MON 5:58 PM
so to make up for the shitty combat, they made something called VATS, which lets you slow down time and choose where to automatically shoot, with a percentage of accuracy shown for each body part based on the targets visibility and your weapon skills
MON 5:58 PM
so you CAN shoot manually, but to preserve ammo and win, its generally better to use VATS
MON 5:59 PM
each time you take a shot in vats, it uses action points, which slowly regen
MON 5:59 PM
im not a huge fan of vats-- gets tedious
MON 5:59 PM
however, there is a new mod that lets you use up your action points and still have full control of your character-- think bullet time
MON 6:00 PM
I'm going to play with that and hopefully add mods to make it a bit harder to make up for it
