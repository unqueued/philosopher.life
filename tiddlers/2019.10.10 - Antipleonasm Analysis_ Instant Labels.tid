title: 2019.10.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Instant Labels

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Anybody that gives even a just criticism of the Jew is instantly labeled antisemite.

Oof. This controversial sentence folds in on itself. What madman would touch this with even a 12-foot pole? I must throw my stones judiciously here; it takes a dialectical pair to walk the line on these eggshells, around these landmines, and with uncharitable interpreters.

I understand we both have religious histories and personal stakes in the matter. I may be part of the blood lineage, and memetically I'm clearly inundated and grafted into various trees. Interpreting the stories of Saint Jesus and Sir Paul have defined me as a person. I grew up on the edges of Zionism and Dispensationalism. 

I will tone it down for you carefully. It is not anybody who is criticized, but many, and unjustifiably so in some. As for almost any community, there are just criticisms to give, including the various notions and rhizomatic instantiations of the Jewish peoples, both genetically and memetically. It is also not always instant, and sometimes the fitting antisemitic label is never applied.

It is crucial to see, however, that Zionism has been a tool of capitalists who aim the centralize [[power]] and feed off destruction and warfare. Peace is not prosperous enough to prevent psychopaths from exploiting racism and religious zealotry.
