How's your week going?
WED 11:55 AM
Better! Been struggling with physical health on and off, but mentally I’m doing much better.
WED 1:26 PM
Well, yesterday was a struggle. But suck is the life of a corporate slave forever in meetings lol
WED 1:26 PM
Such* not suck
WED 1:26 PM
both meanings work, XD
WED 1:27 PM
You been able to play more KH?
WED 1:28 PM
Not a ton more because I’ve been crazy tired lately with all the weird sickness stuff. But some.
WED 1:30 PM
Poor [[K]] — he barely has any time to play but he’s still being super considerate by letting me have time. I know it’s silently killing him hehe.
WED 1:30 PM
He’s such a dear. Sometimes I wish I could pause time for him so he can do all the things he wants to do.
WED 1:33 PM
Lol. That is true love.
WED 1:34 PM
You guys have been busy.
WED 1:34 PM
Flu spreading around up there too?
WED 1:34 PM
How's the new D&D game going, btw?
WED 1:40 PM
Flu is spreading around here, yes. But I thankfully have not gotten it yet. Most of mine is stomach sensitivity or sinus issues because of the crazy weather.
WED 2:02 PM
As for the D&D game, our first session went REALLY well! I am excited to play with this group. I’m specifically trying to play a character that is very different from me. It’s hard, but fun!
WED 2:03 PM
[[K]] really is a fantastic DM.
WED 2:03 PM
That sounds excellent. =)
WED 2:23 PM
It was. Did [[K]] tell you about the shitty behind-the-scenes stuff related to that game?
WED 2:23 PM
Yeah
WED 2:26 PM
sounds unfun in that respect =(
WED 2:26 PM
The more I think about it, the more inclined I am to say that they don’t truthfully understand the emotional repercussions of their decision.
WED 2:26 PM
Virtue is Knowledge. The question is why they don't understand.
WED 2:27 PM
Ignorance is often not blameless. I do not take Hanlon's razor up in all cases, however politically correct it may be to do so.
WED 2:28 PM
It is entirely likely I am giving them too much credit here.
WED 2:29 PM
Hahahaha, I like Hanson’s razor. Had to look it up.
WED 2:39 PM
I think I tend to fall into that principle too often, truthfully.
WED 2:39 PM
Here it is more likely that they didn’t give consideration to it hurting his feelings because (1) they personally would not be hurt by or (2) they don’t care if they hurt his feelings at all.
WED 2:40 PM
These two are considerate to the general populace often enough... but they are also very prickly and say things that are often insensitive. They have VERY few fucks to give.
WED 2:41 PM
The problem with the conscientness Big5 trait, imho, is that it fails to capture intention and capacity. It's an ambiguous marker. Some of the most successful sociopaths are highly conscientious, that's exactly what enables them to reason about the means to end relationships of using others.
