title: DjinniOS: Ideabox

* Plan9-esque
* NixOS generated
* Perfected bootstrapping into arbitrary network and permissions topologies
* Should be goto OS for any federated or decentralizeable tool (including blockchains)
* Set minimum permissions. Install as users.

* Focus on high-performance command line software
** Build its development+test environment in itself
** IMUNS
** Decentrally self-hosted with decentralized developer permissions/ranged-voting

* ARM, x64 are required targets, and eventually hopefully WASM as well
* Actively support VMs and containers

* Ultimate languages:
** Nix
** Rust
** Go
** Xonsh

* Script Families:
** Nix
*** Build minimal environment
*** Intercompatible modules

** Xonsh
*** IMUNS Testing Scripts
*** Nix Development Macros

* Modules:
** Decentralized Reddit
** SyncThing
** Meshed VPN (arbitrary topologies)
** Incorporate [[Atropos]] protocol
** Build [[Outopos]] trust notions

Nixpkg repo should be distributed Git, so my packages are self-hosted. Clients that can't afford it can even ask for packages to be held and built for them (for their architecture, possibly).
