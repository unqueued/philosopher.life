!! Audit:

* Plenty of sarcasm in here. It's true. Tearing my flesh right off the bones.
* Plenty of weird, grotesque, and absurd responses. I like those which make me laugh and still make the philosophical point.
* However delusional it may appear, I think the point of view has crystallized in many respects. It's my job to talk about it incessantly.
* Not all [[title.Title]]s are going to last. 
* Pretty much just one-paragraph answers these days.
** With some rabbitholish rant exceptions.
* I want to see more `/emote`s.
* The Meat Grinder is everpresent in here. Finding hope in what appears so hopeless.
** There is progress though. Look!
* I'm considering just stripping out the exact dupes in [[Generic Prompts]]. Getting myself to the end so that I can do a judgment pass would be nice.
** Seems like I've seen a lot of these questions before this month.
* These are me. No way around it. It's true: they hated me in Sunday School. XD.
* Glad to see more of the "I don't know the answer" answers.
* Yeah, sometimes I commit with something technical too. Solid representation.
* Ah, I see why I made that move in Books+Art now.
