Yes it has truly! Thank you :relaxed: 
Esteban wants me to ask you if you would be able to get the new Dumbo movie he is dying to see it. The one that was just released by Tim Burton. We have a copy on the Exodus -but it’s not that great;(

I can't get you a better copy, sadly. The DVD might not be released until July 2019.

Had no idea that movie existed. I like Tim Burton. I might have to watch it.
