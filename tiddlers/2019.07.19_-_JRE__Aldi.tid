title: 2019.07.19 - JRE: Aldi

My brother and I talked while I wandered Aldi today. He wants to have my children over again in December. I think that is excellent. Both of my offspring are looking forward to it (though I want to make sure they are doing their schoolwork). 

He took an old (but nice) knife and built a new wooden handle with brass. My offspring helped him. It has "h0p3" inscribed on it. It's so nice, I'm not even sure I can use it. I adore it. It's meant for my [[h0p3: EDC]], so I think I will. It's nice to have the momento with me.

My brother is thinking about having older children instead. I think it gave him hope. It sounds like everyone had a good time in general, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.

Unfortunately, it was I who had to cut the conversation off a bit early. I had to finish shopping to get back home.
