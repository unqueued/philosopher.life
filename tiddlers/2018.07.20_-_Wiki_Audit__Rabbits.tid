title: 2018.07.20 - Wiki Audit: Rabbits

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

My audits are often about hyperreading (rabbitholing) my wiki in as valuable a manner as I can.

My problems with tagging, I think, stem from seeming to lack natural hierarchies to me. That everything has properties "tagged" onto it doesn't seem to necessitate a structural order of meaningful meaning arising from those mere tags. Some tags just fundamentally have to be structures then. 

Directories give us sequences. Can tags? Sets are dead fucking useful, I do not deny it. I do not see how I can't just transclude and use the same link multiple times to functionally achieve what tags can (and far more, I would argue). If it's a matter of searching, then why not just search? Labeling is categorizing, and categories that really matter in the end seem to be worth directory tree structures. Are tags just leaves on these structures? Why can't I just use the search functionality of this wiki instead of tags? Tags still create too much semantic flatness, they don't seem to give "rise" to a narrative by themselves effectively enough.

I got some work done around the wiki, and I need to continue working on {[[Help]]}. It's not there yet. Afterwards, I can clear {[[About]]} up m more effectively.
