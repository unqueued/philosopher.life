title: 2020.01.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Shizzle

* Woke at 11ish
** Went to bed feeling terrible, but that sleep was delicious. I dreamt again. Neat.
* Dialecture
* Read+Write
* Moar proof of residence
** Gonna try a different DMV (totally unused to that possibility)
* Fixing problems with my son
** I'm thinking diff is making more sense this time around.
* Clean
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Sent my offspring to go shopping for a meal on their own.
** They each took a CC. Time to build trust there too. 
** I adore that they had to wander and figure things out without a list or instruction.
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** He's sounding happy! =)
*** Work is good, food is good, baby is good. Life is good.
**** Fuck yeah, dude.
**** Avoiding talking about the baby's future today. Want him to enjoy it while it lasts. 
*** Talked about how life is coming together here for us. 
**** I'm not feeling the pull of substances this month. 
** He's right that the Winter holiday season sucks for him. I'm sad that it seems to be getting worse each passing year for him. I'm hoping that will change.
* Walked with wife
** She now has a pair of $15 shoes that are well-made in the style she likes. Should last for a year (we just threw the last pair away before the move...those are the shoes she walks with me in most of the time, except during her self-proclaimed boot season). That old-school ghetto skater shoe ends up looking cute AF on her. She is my grunge. 
*** For the record, I still a pair of JNCOs that fit my sorry ass. One day, I will be cool again. 
** Got a bowl of fast Korean food for us to share (aint never had that before). Um, yes, please. I'll take a million of those.
* Tortellini, salad
* Kodi config just corrupted out of nowhere...alrighty. Fixed that.
* Snuggles 
* Fell asleep
** Coughing brought me right out of that one.
* Read+Write
* Tired sleeping, no go. 
* Fireman Time!
* Zoned in and out starting at 3?
