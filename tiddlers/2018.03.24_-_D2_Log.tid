I'm very slowly climbing levels, to 88 now, with the necro. He's extremely safe though. I need to grind Baal simply because he drops everything. I've done thousands of Mephisto runs. I think I'm done with that.

I need to test magi's to see if they were are worth a HOTO. AoKL has sigificant drawbacks when I'm being struck (have died to it). HOTO is sexy, no doubt.

I actually don't care about FCR so much on the necro. It's pleasant, but not fundamental to my DPS, especially not the hard part of my DPS (getting a corpse in the first place). +3 Curses frees up at the minimum 6 points to put into Magi. I like the +1 CR. 

I could try Iron Golem again, but I'm convinced that path is dead. He must be built from Armor, I'm convinced. 

This would be solved by just having a Ber rune. I'd go Beast instantly. Meh.

Tested Iron Golem with Duriel's Cuirass. He was defensively very powerful. He offered nothing for damage though. Gumby + more mages is just better damage and control. I'd need a very high end runeword to even consider Iron Golem worthy otherwise.
