title: 2019.11.27 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Kissing the Hand

!! Respond to the following gem:

I take "kissing the hand" to be a complimentary initiation to some social engagement. I suppose it is fancy, a show of respect, maybe a demonstration of loyalty, and definitely how you greet anyone you want to have sex with (tasty fangers). 

Call me narcissistic, but I'm a man who often doubts compliments and those who offer them. Gestures require dissection. I am touched when I'm convinced they are sincere (which turns out to be difficult to know). Perhaps hypocritically, I enjoy complimenting people when I have the chance (especially since I'm fairly harsh in general). Yeah, I can be nice to anyone, but the opportunity to honestly tell someone what I respect about who they are, their choices and character,<<ref "l">> is one of the highlights of socializing for me. It's probably a mix people jerking someone off, encouraging, and building bridges. 

Are we forced to //merely// virtue signal by kissing hands? Sure, sometimes. Have you ever had a reactionary or capitalist hold [[power]]-over the lives of your children? I'm not much of a civil [[gentleman]].
