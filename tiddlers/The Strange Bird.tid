Beautiful ~~cashgrab~~ story. I'm glad it was short. I love seeing it from another perspective. 

Lovely love story. I like seeing inside the other characters. The magic became scientific, and it became magical yet again. Identity is there. Still not sure what I think of "made" things. 

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
