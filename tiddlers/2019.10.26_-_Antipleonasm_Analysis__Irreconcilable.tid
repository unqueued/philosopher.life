title: 2019.10.26 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Irreconcilable

!! Respond to the following gem:

Where two principles really do meet which cannot be reconciled with one another, then each man declares the other a fool and a heretic.

In fundamental disagreement over the essence of wisdom, definitely. It is not always easy, however, to determine when two contrary principles are diametrically opposed or incommensurable. Since neither are [[The Absolute]], at least logically, either one sublates the other, or both are sublated from outside. How do you know you have reached fundamental disagreement, and how ought that alter how you interact with the person?

There is an [[irwartfrr]] to the tact and sometimes deception embedded in justified diplomacy. How //ought// one stake out one's position on a map to demonstrate what they'll die for as a branded or, in fact, fool or heretic, and what regions ought they be willing to cede for peace?<<ref "j">> It is said that negotiation must be rooted in mutual respect and concern for the rights of [[others]]. These terms too we must negotiate.  

Successful and satisfying [[good]] [[faith]] efforts to empathize with the [[other]] require reflective equilibrium on both sides, sometimes incurring asymmetrical costs, proofs, and sacrifices. 

Godwin's Law, Stardate 20191026102217: can you really negotiate with Hitler in the end? Hitler is going to be objectively wrong about what counts as justified negotiation. Is there a time where you ought to call him a fool or even a malicious heretic? At some point, don't you have not only the permissible right but the obligation to stop considering and respecting Hitler's feelings and supposed reasons? How ought we draw such lines? The possibility of just war obtains. Sometimes you should take the shot in yet another trolley problem.

Seek peace, but never surrender. Peace is not so precious as to be purchased at the price of unjustified chains and slavery. Of course, we must serve [[the other]]. Codify, compute your contradictions together, and compromise as effectively as you can; do your best to exhaust reasonable resolution of that which even initially appears irreconcilable, but there comes a point or a line you must draw. 

To various [[dok]], not all perspectives are complete, valid, equal, or consistent. One negotiates peace for the sake of what? Is it because it's [[Beautiful]]? Oh, I know plenty of people who find grace, artistry, and [[beauty]] in war. Eye of the Beholder [[Beauty]] does not provide universal justificatory grounds for pursuing peace, but I'm grateful when I'm lucky enough to have additional sources of secondary motivation to pursue peace. Clearly, only [[The Right]] can be an honest attempt to answer the question. Negotiating what counts as justified cooperation and defection in negotiation is a hard problem. It requires moral clarity. You cannot define a categorical end or the means to it without a foundational function and honestly-crafted maxim input.
