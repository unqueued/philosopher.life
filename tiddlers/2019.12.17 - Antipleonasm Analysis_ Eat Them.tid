!! Respond to the following gem:

: No one gets rich quickly if he is honest.

That's not true. I'll agree it's incredibly rare. You could win the lottery as an honest person.<<ref "r">> So, "almost no one" would be fine with me. The honest shopkeeper isn't being honest in all relevant details though; moral motivation requires honesty too.

One question: how honest? It is possible to say the truth most of the time, saving up dishonesty for big lies. To my eyes, honesty runs deep here, including an honesty about one's moral obligations and moral luck. It's clear that you cannot be materially wealthy and moral at the same time for very long. But, acquisition is not the same as long-term holding. Almost no one gets rich, quickly or slowly, if he is profoundly honest; and, an honest person doesn't stay wealthy for very long.

Capitalism (and the state of nature) selects for psychopaths. Being honest does not materially pay off for the individual. Dishonesty as information advantage is often at least a virtualized comparative advantage in the market.
