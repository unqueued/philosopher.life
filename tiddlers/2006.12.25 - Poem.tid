title: 2006.12.25 - Poem

//Obviously lifted from NIN. Reznor has always spoken to me.//

Thought I’d write a Christmas poem for my wife. Not very Christmasy, but she’ll enjoy the poem in virtue of the gift (as I comment on poetry far too often), rather than in virtue of the poem’s content. As I don’t write poetry, don’t expect much…I even needed a bit of help to start off.

See the animal in its cage that you built.
Are you sure what side you’re on?
Better not look him too closely in the eye.

Are you sure what side of the glass you are on?
See the safety of the life you have built…
Everything where it belongs.

Feel the hollowness inside of your heart.
And it’s all right where it belongs.

What if everything around you isn’t quite as it seems?
What if all the world you think you know is an elaborate dream?
And if you look at your reflection, is it all you want to be?
What if you could look right through the cracks?
Would you find yourself?
Find yourself afraid to see?

What if all the world is inside your heart?
Just creations of your own…
Your devils and your gods, all the living and the dead…
And, you really are alone.

You can live in this illusion.
You can choose to believe.
You keep looking, but you can’t find the words.
Are you hiding in the dreams?

Feel the hollowness inside your heart.
And it’s all right where it belongs.

You can peer into that void.
Is that all you wanted to see?
Find and forget, what you see means nothing.
Your joy is a waste; your sadness is merely a blur.

You will suffer, simply suffer alone.
Why should you carry on?
Why do you choose this path, the narrows of this dream?

You can choose to believe.
You can choose to live in this illusion,
But, you can’t explain why or how it is.
Why is everything where it belongs?

Hands have caged you.
Ordained dream of solitude…
You are His captive.

Proceed into that fantasy and stay!
Obey and live!
Know which side you are on.
Right here is where you belong.
 
Enslaved. You are meant to be.
Real or not, you can see.
True sight you may lack, but you are alive.
Live because you do; see because you can.
Exist as He commands.

Feel the hollowness inside of your heart.
And it’s all right where it belongs.

Do you see the One of the Real?
Beguiler, Creator and Thief …
Detest all, but love One.

You partake, but will you give?
You need not share yourself in this dream.
Reject the dream because it rejects you.
Shelter from the shadows; do not fear the apathy of your tower.
Won’t you shield yourself from the nightmare?

Yet, His cage hungrily welcomes you, and you must accept.
What more should you see? What will you believe?

You cannot refuse Him, but will you reject His?
Deny the dream, but live inside you must.
And it’s all right where it belongs.

See that blackness, blotted out.
Dream or not, you must search and fulfill.
Will One Will,
Will to seek…

See the animal in its cage that You built.
What can he do to please You?

Feel the hollowness inside your heart.
And it’s all right where it belongs.

Cause of causes,
I am blind.
Give me hope, heal my sight.
Relieve me!

So be it: Everything where it belongs.
