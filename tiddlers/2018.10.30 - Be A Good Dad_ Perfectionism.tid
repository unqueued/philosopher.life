title: 2018.10.30 - Be A Good Dad: Perfectionism

For a thousand reasons which seem so reasonable, I push you hard. Even though I ask for 6 hours of work, somehow we work from the time I see you until your bedtime. Even our play is planned. Yeah, it ain't healthy, but then what does eudaimonia ([[The Good]] of humans, and alternatively of persons) and [[The Right]] in our contexts really, really look like? Intensity is a hard problem. 

My son hurt himself today. On purpose. He did it, and therefore, so did I. He talked to me about it. We held each other for a long time. How can I restore him? Who should I be for him? What does he need? How can he be restored? 

The perfectionism vortex is absurd.

I must go back to the drawing board. What will I morally do to give my children the best consequences.
