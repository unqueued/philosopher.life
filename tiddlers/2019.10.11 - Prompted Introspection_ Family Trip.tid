title: 2019.10.11 - Prompted Introspection: Family Trip

!! If you could only take 3 people with you on a trip around the world, who would you take and why?

It depends on the nature of the trip around the world. Presumably, you mean some standard, safe, [[beautiful]], luxurious trip. Insofar as I can just functionally say: whichever 3 people taking a trip with me around the world would result in the maximum justified happiness in all relevant scopes of time and context, it would be them. Assuming even those requirements were met somehow externally to this question, and I'm meant to just pick people in my life who I //want// to be on a trip with me outside of [[The Right]], it would be my family: [[1uxb0x]], [[j3d1h]], and [[k0sh3k]]. This, of course, is but a mere distant {[[dream]]} for me. Could the world be such that most folks could justifiably travel like this? Yes; communism as an ideal can be pragmatized this far. The probability is so radically low that I do not plan on it, though I plan in virtue of it.

There are many people I'd like to take a trip around the world with. In a virtualized way, I think I get to do a semblance of that through wikiing.
