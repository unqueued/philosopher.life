!! Why did you choose TSM as "your team?" Why do you have a team you want to be a fan of at all? Isn't that some dirty tribalism?

It is irrational in some respects. Thank you, Samwise. There are a couple rationales/rationalizations to consider.

I've followed them for a long time. I connect with the narratives, even if only because I've seen more of their narratives than others. I like their pursuit of excellence. Don't we live vicariously through their stories?

I also like limiting what I need to watch. I watch TSM, and the others I don't give a shit about except insofar as they affect "my" team. It's practical to be a fan in this way.

I think I also compartmentalize my fandom here in a reasonable way. I don't think it affects how I view or interact with others. This tribalism is contained and by itself not obviously affecting anything else. Yes, I see subconscious butterfly effects are a possibility. 

Okay. I will think about it some more.
