What you up to this week? How's it going?
6 hours ago
 I still want to try to finish the book. It's hard for me so I'm going slowly.
5 hours ago
 I hear that. There's one book I've been trying to read for months, and I can't summon the willpower+courage to do it, lol.
5 hours ago
 I wish that you could just teach e that will be so much faster.
5 hours ago
 I can't believe that you have truble with any books.
5 hours ago
 Oh, well, I consider myself borderline illiterate. There are many people who drown me in their ability and practice of reading.
5 hours ago
 I also try to finish the book from [[SLT]] gave me long time ago.
5 hours ago
 Which book was that? She is a very talented reader herself. I will likely never catch up to her quantity.
5 hours ago
 From Buddha to Jesus.
5 hours ago
 Among Christian books, it is a famous one in Thailand.

 What do you mean when you say "borderline illiterate" is that mean you don't want to share your idea?
5 hours ago
 I think I am a very poor reader in the end. I have seen what strong readers accomplish, and I don't ever see myself climbing that mountain (however, I will do my best, lol).
5 hours ago
 I think you underestimate your self.
5 hours ago
 I always feel comfortable to share my thoughts with you because I think you are one of the bookworm. I don't think you are 100%correct but it helps me to see another idea.
5 hours ago
 I try not to over or underestimate myself on this point (believe me, I'd love to just assume I'm a badass at this). I know I'm wildly more well-read than the average person, but that doesn't make me well-read, imho. I know that some of the books I read are among the hardest to interpret in analytic settings, but I'm also smart enough to know what it's like to stand in a room with a genius at reading and see that I'm still amateur compared to them. You are right, "borderline illiterate" is not the correct phrase; I aim to show humility and respect to those I consider profoundly  literate.
5 hours ago
 I do aim to be a bookworm. I just don't think I am successful at it in the end.

 Maybe this is a better way to it: I swim (i.e. read) every day, but I've had the chance to swim in pools with many Olympic swimmers. I'm a "swimmer," but not compared to these people I have seen.
5 hours ago
 I do my doggy paddle, and I don't drown in the deep end. Meanwhile, these guys are  swimming faster than I can run on land, doing quadruple backflips with perfect form off the diving board, and holding their breath for 4 minutes straight.

 Anyway, do you like the book I shared or no?
5 hours ago
 I have not read it. I assumed you did not want to engage in the practice with me.
5 hours ago
 I would expect you to wrestle with me about the book.
5 hours ago
 I expressed my misgivings before: I know the school the author comes from, and I did browse through it.
5 hours ago
 I think it's not scholarly work.
5 hours ago
 What do you mean by en gate in the practice with you?
5 hours ago
 I would not could not wrestle with you for sure.
5 hours ago
 That would be a problem. I think you are asking me to read a book which is profoundly  wrong.
5 hours ago
 I am willing to pay that price for you.
5 hours ago
 But, you would need to understand why I think it is wrong.
5 hours ago
 I don't think I saw that message.
5 hours ago
 I'm sorry. It is there, though I must not have said it clearly enough.
5 hours ago
 Well, it's good to know.
5 hours ago
 I just try to find the correct way to believe. That's why I have changed. But religion is very difficult.
5 hours ago
 Preach, yo! =) Amen.
5 hours ago
 What!

 (I'm agreeing with you. I'm trying to do the same thing. Amen = 'so be it')

 After I stayed in the state for a long time. I have seen many people say they are Christian but the way they act cannot even compare with some Buddish.
5 hours ago
 My rule is 3% (used to be 2%) actually mean it.

5 hours ago
 I'm agreeing with you again.
5 hours ago
 For every 100 people who claim to be Christian, I've found at most 3 of them are actually Christian in how they attempt to lead their lives.
5 hours ago
 Oh
5 hours ago
 One thing that I see is because they grew up with it so it is not easy for them to see.
5 hours ago
 Definitely lots of biases at work
5 hours ago
 I still hold them responsible for failing to improve.

 It is very nice to hear your ideas. I have to go pick up the kids. I will try to think more about it.
