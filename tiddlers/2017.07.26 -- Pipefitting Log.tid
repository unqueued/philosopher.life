title: 2017.07.26 -- Pipefitting Log

I arrived early today. No one was there. Jaye came next. We talked and I wrote while we waited. Nobody came. So, we started our work. We were brainstorming on how to take the measurements we needed. Jaye has never done a job like this with "so many problems" as he put it. It's definitely not simple, although it appears simple enough to Bull (who is obviously an expert at this practice [been doing it for +25 years]). 

Eventually, at around 7:50, I found Bull in the boiler room. I'm guessing he must have showed up at around 7:30, despite telling Jaye to show up at 7:00. My guess is that this includes "travel time." I will keep this in mind. I think they are fairly relaxed about showing up late around here. I think that is very interesting, as that is not as I've heard otherwise for most companies. That relaxed attitude might be a large part of why these people are so loyal to a company that pays them less than they are worth. 

I heard that bonuses come out around October-ish, but it would probably not be a ton, if I understand correctly. I'm guessing I might not even receive one, even if I were to stick around that long. Jaye knows I'll probably be leaving the moment I have a job close to home. I think several of those in company may already suspect it as well. They find it odd that I travel this far for the job. They aren't wrong.

In any case, I asked Bull for his expert advice. He told me he needed to clock me in. He fumbled with his phone trying to get it to work. He obviously feels odd around me. He told me he had heard the rumor that I was college educated, and said he wanted to give me the nickname "professor" (a swear word to many around here, no doubt). I laughed. He asked me where I went to school. I listed them. My goal is to not make a big deal of it with these people. He told me that another person he had worked with that had gone to school before becoming a pipefitter as well. I told him it was hard to make money as a philosopher, and he laughed. That's the best way to handle it, I think.

Bull came with me to the room. Upon second inspection, he told me to start with the bottom piece. This made far more sense, since I was worried I had nothing to measure off of. That was my gameplan coming into today, and it felt good to have it confirmed. I needed to take the Blind Flange off, and our Supply needs two threadolets (he'll just bushing the second 3/4" sockolet, he said) pointing up. To take the Blind flange off, I needed to release some sludge water from a globe valve coming after the butterfly valve (which apparently has some real pressure behind it). 

Let me tell you, it is scary as fuck being up on these unsteady ladders. I really don't know how we are going to safely handle so much heavy pipe. There's got to be a better way. I can do the measurements and flange work off the ladders. Bull said he could get us some scaffolds, but these are thought to be even worse. We can't use a lift because of the tiles. This sucks.

I told Bull about my 90 rolled onto a 45 angle into a 45 shooting down. He liked it. He decided later we might have to go 90 straight down into 45 on 45. He asked me if I could do the math for these. He does the 1.141 whatever trick. He told me I needed to divide instead. I think I'll just stick to my standard 5/8 Diameter method for the TO. Hopefully, I don't fuck this up terribly.

We took off the blind flange, we measured to the wall, and then I had Jaye run up to the roof to drop a plumb bob. We measured off the plumb bob mark to the wall, took off another 8 inches for the box above, and that gave us the total length.

We went to cut some pipe, but Bull stopped us. We were using the wrong pipe, meant for sprinklers. We noted the schedule was tiny, S10, likely. We then went on break.

After break, I grabbed the right pipe with Jaye. We put a flange on it. Jaye started welding. Bull came by to inspect the weld. 

I figured out that I lacked the right BNG (Bolt and Gasket?) kits for 3" pipe. Bull had some extra 3" gaskets and bolts, thankfully. When I came back, I found that Jaye's weld, including cap was all fucked up. That machine really sucks. You can't tell what heat it is on at all. We cut the flange and pipe off and started again. 

While he did that I setup the hangers (lowered them), took a measurement for the second run of pipe, grabbed 3/4" and a 1/2" threadolet (Bull agreed it best to use the right size instead of a bushing). I cut the pipe (a bit too short, eek!), and marked the center points and then the circles for the threadolets.

We could not get the oxy acetylene cutting torch to work correctly. We gave up by 12:15. We'll deal with it after lunch. Arguably, we are far behind.

After lunch, we grabbed Bull. Basically, after the oxygen hose came off while the torch was on with Jaye, and I ran to turn it all off, I decided we needed a professional who had used this particular torch. Bull did his magic, and he flicked the gauge, and it worked. I cut some beautiful holes.

I'd say I didn't have as much to do in the latter half of the day. Most of my planning and work was in the beginning, and I staggered enough work to keep Jaye constantly busy at the end. I hope I can continue to do that. In the fitter/welder duo relationship, you want to be the best guy on the team, since that means you'll always be waiting for the other guy. Right now, I'm not that good (although, I think I could do this lower quality pipewelding, as long as I don't have to mind any gaps [although, I learned to do that the other too: it's all in the speed])

We got it fabbed up, and the second piece as well. Jaye finished the last cap on the first piece, but had to go before we could mount it. I spent the rest of the day cleaning up our station, and then talking to Bull. Bull doesn't seem to spend much time working, but he does get a lot done. He's easy going. Definitely a good boss/foreman to have, thus far.

Bull asked me what I could work on. I was straightforward with him. Since we didn't mount the piece, I have nothing to measure off of. Everything is already tacked. I basically couldn't do anything. He didn't seem to mind. He told me to finish cleaning up and come help him (where "help" didn't actually mean any work at all). 

I have to say, every single interaction I've had with Bull has been neutral or better, at least on my end. I have no idea for him. I'm quite pleased to have a boss that isn't an asshole, and moreover, is quite fun to be with.

Bull and Spaz stayed late with me. We didn't get shit done. Although, I was given black spraypaint for my welds to prevent the rust. I'll continue to do that. They found room in the gangbox for my tools. That is hospitality. I'm going to feel really bad about leaving Bull and Spaz, I think. We all stayed a bit later today, just shootin' the shit, looking for scissor lift in the building, etc.

Bull spends a lot of time talking about his daughter (3-4 years younger than me, similar story/ethos) with me. I do not quite understand it. I've not seen him talk about his daughter with others. Why me? His daughter, of course, is quite educated. Maybe he is using her story to get a feel for whom I am. I'm not sure. We definitely talked plenty of politics today. I was as humble and cordial as I could be. We have serious idealogical differences, although Bull is not an idiot. He's not educated, and that is his fault to some extent. I like how much he loves his daughter though; it's clear he has really worked to keep his bridges with her despite their serious differences.

I picked up our phones. I'm feeling confident enough in the job and the car to do this. Eth is my backup, but I hope we don't have to spend it (I anticipate another price rise). I also grabbed a bluetooth, rugged belt clip case for the phone, and the obligatory screen protector. I've yet to have a phone actually break in any way on me (I tend to be gentle with my electronics), but I know the job is tough on my body and things on my person. I also want easy access and to unburden my pockets a bit (and not to have things in my pocket banging my phone up). I think this is the best option. I believe it should last me for quite a long time. I know my other phones lasted forever.
