!! What would you write in a letter you could send forward in time to yourself in 10 years?

Dear [[h0p3]] or whomever you call yourself,

I have no idea what to say to you, homie. I hope your family is happy! I hope the world somehow stopped spiraling out of control (I do not have high hopes). I hope you found out what matters, how I've been wrong, and fixed whatever needs fixing. I'm working hard for you and your family, bud. The evidence is here, and I hope those many years later you will agree.

Sincerely,

Current Me (also you, right?)
