*** I am reminded, again, of The Lottery Paradox for inconsistency (though not immediate, direct contradiction). [[The Dialetheia]] appears unanswerable too. I don't know how to talk about freewill in a way that won't be paradoxical or a giant fucking leap of faith.

*** He is superfluous except insofar as he points to the two greatest commandments. Only we can redeem ourselves insofar as anything is up to us (and you must remain a humble quietist otherwise; stop anthropomorphizing).

His game-theoretically sound memeplex, however, is extremely fit, and it's obviously [[diamondic]] in description and prescription. Your centrism is retarded and/or malicious.
