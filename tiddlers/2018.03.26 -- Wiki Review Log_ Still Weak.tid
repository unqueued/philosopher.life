title: 2018.03.26 -- Wiki Review Log: Still Weak

* [[2018.03.25 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Uncle Memory]]
** This was a sad one to write.
* [[2018.03.25 -- Wiki Review Log: Peter out]]
** Funny enough, their AI is finally catching on. I'm lucky to squeeze $1k from them a day at this point. 
* [[2018.03.25 -- Weekly Post-Mortem: Electrician]]
** Good job. The philosophy will come. I had RL duties that were overriding. 
* [[2018.03.25 -- Daily To-Do-List Log: Famiry]]
** I called. JRE called me back during family time, which is cool. We needed a break (had just finished with kids' wikis)
* [[2018.03.25 -- Weekly To-Do-List Log: Insurance]]
** Doable. Let's do it!
* [[2018.03.25 -- Family Log]]
** My children think about their week in terms of their work. Once we get it down, I think they will see it opens up to them. 6 hours is not 16. Once they figure this out, they will have control of their lives.
* [[2018.03.25 -- Carpe Diem Log: Family Gathering]]
** Completed.
* [[2018.03.25 -- D2 Log]]
** 2 more to go, then I get to gamble very hard. I may do more Mephisto runs as well, since I need that homunculus, and it's probably  the fastest route still. 
* [[2018.03.25 -- Deep Reading Log: Borne]]
** I'm very grateful to my wife for this book. I told her she took take it off the list, it was that good. No reason to spend 1 of her 12 books like this unless she wanted to.
