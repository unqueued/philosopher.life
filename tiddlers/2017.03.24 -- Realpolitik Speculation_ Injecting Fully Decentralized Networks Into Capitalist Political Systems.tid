title: 2017.03.24 -- Realpolitik Speculation: Injecting Fully Decentralized Networks Into Capitalist Political Systems

Let's say the world doesn't end anytime soon. What can it look like? There may be many possibilities. Are there hopes for the masses amongst any of those possible worlds? How many and to what extent? When weighing the average risk-assessed utility over all the possible worlds, does this favor us wanting to live or not? Is there a reason for us, the masses, to live? Let us say there were good reasons. What would those be? How do we maximize the chances of having a world worth living in for the masses (Veil of Ignorance)? What are the means to our ends? I am convinced one of these means and perhaps necessary conditions for such a world will be //decentralizing information//. This is a form of decentralizing power; the old adage [[Knowledge is Power]] is fundamentally true in many crucial categories of cases in our general lives. 

Not all decentralized networks are good, of course; I spoke about this [[before|2017.02.28 -- Web Assembly: The Browser VM as Decentralized Cloud]]. Maximizing decentrality is key though. Partial decentralization still has the problems of relying upon central powers. I believe there is a chance that completely decentralized networks are a fundamental cryptoanarchic tool for both socialist and libertarian utopias. This is old news to many. And, of course, I'm not saying utopia is achievable. I'm talking about the most ideal practical utopia that is possible; the Leibnizian Best Possible World sense (which, logically, must be open to some very shitty worlds). I think there is a reasonable chance we could all be relatively happy people on the planet if everyone worked together right now to throw our yokes off. 

Decentralized networks of information are decentralized networks of power. 

# It is a crucial method for uniting [[The People]] of the world. 
# It is a fundamental necessary condition on the autonomy of the People in the future as well.

These two facts are deeply intertwined, obviously. 

I also think there is a chance that decentralized networks not controlled by major corporations will be able to live in the future. The dangers these networks pose to those in power is still not completely clear to the entire Hyperclass (but obviously to some of them). If they were to fully realize the threat posed by decentralized networks, they might kill them faster or require at least some degree of "accountability" centralization. Yes, it is possible for these to be squeezed out through legal systems and significant financial pressures. There are those who wish to destroy decentrality. Thus, we must preserve publicly owned, fully decentralized systems by commercializing it (the GNU model is excellent). Like standard VPN technology, we need full decentralization to be so key-turn easy and fundamental to the software ecosystem that it would be unfathomable to make it illegal.

Decentralized tools like Bittorrent got a bad wrap, yes, in the name of piracy. I also think there are significant federalist/centralists/capitalists in power that have desperately tried to stop decentralized technology (except for parallel computing) in a generalized way. I think there is an attack on the decentralized web coming from multiple directions. We have to make it necessary now to those in power before it becomes illegal. The hopes of the survival of revolution rest upon injecting decentrality into the very network architectures of the wealthy and powerful. Make it too painful for them to lose it, and we won't.

The only way for the People to maintain and grow their power will be through decentralized networks. If we close them out, people will be compartmentalized, completely owned and managed from surveillers and controllers. Those with the financial interests to have these powers will have them, and it isn't obvious that anything will stop them from trying to maximize their control. The free gateways to the Wild West are closing as the Walled Gardens continue to grow so large they shrink/tame every corner of the Wild West map. 

I will admit, there is a deep irony to the fact that this is now revolutionary. The oldschool hacker ethic has an increasingly smaller voice amongst those who shape the internet.
