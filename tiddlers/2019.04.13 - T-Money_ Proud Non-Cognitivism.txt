I push in lots of places until I don't have to push. Lectures are everyday. It depends on the topic. My temper can be quite short if they are unjustifiably deceptive or not doing their best on top of a history of it.
SAT 6:22 AM
I wouldn't say my son is in college level anything, except philosophy (but only in some respects). It's been a lot of work getting him to function at all.
SAT 6:23 AM
I have never pushed myself at anything except physically. So. I suppose in that respect we are very similar.
SAT 8:06 AM
In how we raise our children.
SAT 8:06 AM
For instance, when Samantha is helping me complete a task outside, or inside, I hghlu expect her to watch closely, hold the flashlight properly, watch the task at hand and be ready to had me what I need as soon as I need it. To push her little body to pick up stick in the yard with vigor and to do job with pride and all effort.
SAT 8:08 AM
Fuck. I'm like. [[h0p3]] but hands on. Gdit lol
SAT 8:09 AM
"I wish I could enjoy the contradictions and absurdities. What a wonderful life that would be, right?"
SAT 9:36 AM
Gorgeous
SAT 9:37 AM
More marvelous than I can speak of.
SAT 9:37 AM
It is your words sir. If you don't recognize them.
SAT 9:38 AM
Oh, no, lol. Sorry
SAT 9:38 AM
I had no idea.
SAT 9:38 AM
Well, it is good that I agree with myself.
SAT 9:38 AM
Drunkillfuck
SAT 9:38 AM
Oh, jesus. You are in an embarrassing part of my wiki, lol.
SAT 9:38 AM
No. I don't think so.
SAT 9:39 AM
And if you placard it on the internet....
SAT 9:39 AM
Honesty has a high price.
SAT 9:39 AM
3/4 of our conversations are in there. I need leverage.
SAT 9:40 AM
Haha
SAT 9:40 AM
Indeed. Take all of it!
SAT 9:40 AM
It your part of [[The Golden Rule]] that you hold me accountable.
SAT 9:40 AM
I'm afraid it is my machivellian ethics that are shining with that statement. As I. Learn more about you I appriciate your struggle, we have similar but yet very different. I struggle with the same complex of supiority and complete worthlessness.
SAT 9:44 AM
It's a solid combo.
SAT 9:44 AM
I empathize. Genuinely, with all the children who grow up in suffering. Who are misunderstood, out numbered, cast aside.
SAT 9:45 AM
I can identify with many of the emotions. But no one really understand one another.
SAT 9:46 AM
I hope to deny the latter as far as I can.
SAT 9:46 AM
Ah. Superior this morning?
SAT 9:47 AM
Lol. Always.
SAT 9:47 AM
I'm in great need of it too.
SAT 9:47 AM
I received a letter from my female donor, the first in a very long time. It will take some work to respond to it.
SAT 9:48 AM
My lasers and my teeth are out in full force today.
SAT 9:48 AM
I called my step dad shit faced blackout drunk the other night. I have no recollection of what is said. But I know I lectured him for over an hour.
SAT 9:49 AM
lol
SAT 9:49 AM
I remeber saying. "don't you remeber all the drunken lectures you made me sit through, you will remain on the phone until I am done"
SAT 9:50 AM
That is hilarious.
SAT 9:50 AM
It was after 1am
SAT 9:50 AM
My. Mom, who is living in a camper away from him, called the next day.
SAT 9:51 AM
Terrified that I exposed his little secrete.
SAT 9:51 AM
(poor guy went to work hungover as a registered nurse and they took his nursing license)
SAT 9:52 AM
He has never told me or his parents the truth.
SAT 9:52 AM
My mother told. Me because she has no one to confide in.
SAT 9:52 AM
That must be extremely hard for both of them.
SAT 9:52 AM
He has fabricated a chronic pain injury and hasn't worked in years. He gave me a 12 rules for life book for Christmas but doesn't even live by a shred of the info.
SAT 9:53 AM
He is sadly, broken.
SAT 9:54 AM
With a genius iq and amazing intellect. He is broken
SAT 9:54 AM
I. Use to. Idolize the guy. Now it's difficult to not speak to him. Like a child.
SAT 9:55 AM
My sympathies for the letter from your mom.
SAT 9:55 AM
I tend to get very emotional.
SAT 9:55 AM
I hope you can remain strong.
SAT 9:56 AM
Brokenness sucks. =/
SAT 9:57 AM

SAT 9:57 AM
No additional reflections on the letter you received? (I love this idea both literally and philosophically)
SAT 10:01 AM
Well, I just started about 30 minutes ago. I've not even transcribed the full letter yet. I anticipate it will take me several weeks to respond.
SAT 10:02 AM
Fun fact: the wiki started out as a letter to my donors.
SAT 10:02 AM

SAT 10:02 AM
I draft letters in public though for a variety of reasons.
SAT 10:03 AM
I'm finishing the vault today. Maybe more of  later.
SAT 10:03 AM
Aye, you'll have to forgive how much that place in shambles. It's the kind of thing which will take a lifetime to grow.
SAT 10:04 AM
I feel this weird obligation to learn what I csn from you. Or more so about you.
SAT 10:05 AM
I think that's what friendship is like. We reveal ourselves to each other, learn about each other, and attempt to tell the stories of our lives together.
SAT 10:06 AM
Yeah. I'm. Not the autistic one. I know that. I was revealing to you.
SAT 10:07 AM
I say that with humor and love
SAT 10:07 AM
Don't misread tone
SAT 10:07 AM
Lol. Yeah, it is something which is harder to define as an autist.
SAT 10:08 AM
I have to be more literal about it, even when it is obvious to others.
SAT 10:08 AM
(for the record, even Aristotle failed to define the concept of friendship, imho)
SAT 10:09 AM
Because it's fuxking emotion, no reason, that make a friendship.
SAT 10:10 AM
Not
SAT 10:10 AM
That cannot be right.
SAT 10:10 AM
Rationally yes we get things from each other therefore the is a mutually agreed upon basis for the friendship. But I believe true friendship and love are not rational.
SAT 10:11 AM
They literally come from a different part of the brain.
SAT 10:12 AM
Ugh.
SAT 10:12 AM
Lol
SAT 10:12 AM
Why should I agree?
SAT 10:12 AM
I think it is a solid mix of emotion and cognition. In fact, I deny there is even "a self" without both.
SAT 10:12 AM
To know [[The Other]] is to empathize both cogitively and affectively.
SAT 10:13 AM
cognitively*
SAT 10:13 AM
I don't care if you do or dont agree with me? Generally I will agree with you just to lay the nonsense down.
SAT 10:13 AM
Lol.
SAT 10:14 AM
Friendship sir. =)
SAT 10:14 AM
It's okay, I'll help you along anyways.
SAT 10:15 AM
I can provide you this though: I think it is about having trained our limbic systems virtuously enough together that we can trust our models of each other enough to bypass cognition in a large portion of cases. I'm open to emotion being more central to friendship than cognition.
SAT 10:16 AM
You over analyze. It's ok, I will help you along.
SAT 10:17 AM
Lol
SAT 10:18 AM
Lol. Let's table this akward nonsense for another day. It is the weekend!
SAT 10:18 AM
I'm sorry, I can't hear you without cognizing those symbols into guttural meanings.
SAT 10:18 AM
Tabled!
SAT 10:18 AM
I hope you and the fam have a good day!
SAT 10:19 AM
You too. =)
SAT 10:19 AM
