!! What do you think of the Charlottesville debacle?

I'm not convinced it is time to be scared yet. It is not clear to me that the Republicans believe they can effectively control the Alt-Right enough to fully exploit them. I anticipate this being yet another reason they will have to impeach Trump, who has used this to gain more popularity with his Alt-Right support base.

Obviously, this is horrifying and tragic. I wish that stupid people could see capitalism is the root cause, not "niggers, jews, and transgenders." 

It annoys me that I am considered Alt-Left. Almost no-true-Scotsman territory, I see myself as just plain Left. Democrats are the new conservatives. I am convinced that the political center is still shifting right. I hope Millenials won't fall for the trap, but they already have in many ways.

If violence and surveillance escalate enough, I will be making this wiki private (although, I will hand keys to those I choose).
