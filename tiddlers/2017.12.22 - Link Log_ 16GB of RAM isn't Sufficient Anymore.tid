* Stunning!

*** Excellent. I can't say I agree, but I will need to re-read this and think about it again. This is important. Pinker changed my life forever, and I am still responding to him.

**** Look, I don't buy the miracle or free-rider arguments. I'm willing to hand you tons of slack here, but you still have to recognize the raw predictive strength of the redpill. It's so incredibly accurate at micro and macro scales that the onus, the burden of proof, is on you here. Be skeptical, your justification is still weaker.

* Disconfirm My Bias

* Think About It

*** If they are neutral, they should not shape, censor, or filter anything without your reversible consent. I have the same problem with every search and media platform giant I've found. I do hold them responsible for attempting to offer sane defaults and possibilities. You need to have informed consent (insofar as that is even conceptually possible and meaningful), and they should be leading the pack on this front. Open web, yes; actually creating the open tools to shape ourselves and the world around us. For now, they have the blackbox powers. With great power comes great responsibility, and they are most definitely responsible, even for powers they should have relinquished.
*** Let's be clear, FB's owners and employees have never had a moral compass, and they are far more powerful than you realize. You still don't get it. They are more than King-makers; they are phenomenological reality shapers at a transnational scale.
