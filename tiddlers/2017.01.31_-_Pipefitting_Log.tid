title: 2017.01.31 - Pipefitting Log

I gave my mom the first pipe I threaded. 

We did much of the same: take a schematic, build it, have it checked, take it down, change pipe size, do it again. I expect to become adept at this process. I hope it becomes second nature to me to the point that I can think about other stuff as I do it (safely, ofc). I'm told I will have many such similar projects over the course of the trimester. So be it. I need the practice.

Atm, I'm fairly sore. I'm not used to this level of physical exertion. It isn't on the order of lifting weights and serious workouts though. We'll see as the week progresses how it goes. I'm sure I will grow into it. I tend to develop muscle quickly enough. As long as I take care of my flexibility, my natural strength growth factor will carry me.
