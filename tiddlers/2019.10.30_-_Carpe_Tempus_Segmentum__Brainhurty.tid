title: 2019.10.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Brainhurty

* Woke at 9:30
** Refreshed. Neat.
** Brain hurt though. Dreams were insane.
* Meditate
* Dialecture
** Debate heavy. <3
* Read+Write
* Work 
* Called [[JRE]], [[Charlie]]
* Chilled with wife. She was just slumped there. =(
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** Warren, school, speaking about sad things at work, thankfulness for being in a union for this tool debacle, speaking with the owner, shutdown.
** He's articulate! I wish he wrote. It's sad that he doesn't. His dialectics are dangerous in many cases. 
* Burgers (surprised we had all the ingredients), acorn squash.
** Offspring seem to know how to roast it really well, particularly for my wife's texture preferences.
* //Daria//
* Fell asleep at 9? I don't remember enough, that's what I'm told.
** Sweet baby jesus, amazing.
