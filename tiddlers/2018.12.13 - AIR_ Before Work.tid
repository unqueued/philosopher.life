My brother called me today! He wrote on his wiki again last night, and we talked about it. I understand his situation more effectively, and it is clear the psychopathic boss aims to subdue and force the hierarchy (and signal to his bosses about it). My brother is controlling his emotions, and it's hard. It's fascinating to see the details about the salmon, to hear the purposely vague moving goalposts, to see how power is wielded not for construction but something else. It leaves a mass of people alienated.

We setup the sync on his new phone, and I sent him a bunch of audiobooks. I hope he continues to read. I think it will be a good use of his time, will be relaxing, will help him to empathize, be a release valve, engage different perspective.
