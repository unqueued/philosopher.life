If you have a collection of quotes sitting around somewhere, I would like to read them; you know how to pick out the [[salience]]. There is something special about [[antipleonasm]]s. I would argue, in your shoes, that Christ is something like an antipleonasm (in terms of moral responsibility only the //finite// aspect of the [[fff]] is applicable). I'm extremely curious about your numinous/voluminous claim. I stand on quicksand trying to reason about how the transcendent becomes immanent to any [[dok]]. When it comes to [[faith]], one of our strongest disagreements will be about the conditions of freedom; that may also be worth our attention.

Yes, I got stuck on that Booth quote and thought the possibility that someone somewhere might benefit from a visit from some reddit nomad was worth the time to it took to share it.

Don't worry about taking a lot of time to respond, or even about making your responses to me especially sophisticated. I'm still working of my response to the other half of our earlier exchange (the 'God email') and am coming around to the idea that the numinous does not necessarily reside in the voluminous :)

I am a fan of [[that quote|https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/c9pafd/william_booth_on_loneliness/]]. I take it you've been reading //Friendship at the Margins//. The letter is taking forever, btw. I'm sorry.
