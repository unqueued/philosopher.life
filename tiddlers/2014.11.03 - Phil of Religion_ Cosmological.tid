title: 2014.11.03 - Phil of Religion: Cosmological

We had a session on Aristotle’s God. This puts us in a decent position to understand Aquinas’ arguments and where he is coming from. Perhaps Aquinas sheds some of the characteristics of Aristotle’s God, but retains much of Aristotle’s systematic view of ontology, teleology, and arguments for the existence of God.

Aquinas

Aquinas offers us objections, an argument (in this case 5), and responses to the original objections in virtue of his argument. As usual, he gives us a short, but action-packed prose-style.



Objection 1:

God’s infinite Good and the evil in the world.

    If God existed, then there would be infinite good.

    If there was infinite good, then there couldn’t be any evil in the world.

    There is evil in the world, therefore God doesn’t exist.

Objection 2:

Something like Occam’s razor

    The fewest number of principles is the best explanation for something else.

    One of the simplest explanations for the physical world are natural principles and causes.

    God’s existence isn’t necessary to explain the natural world, thus we don’t need to posit that God exists



5 Ways to Prove that God exists.

I’m not what Aquinas means “Prove” here. Normally, I take the word “Prove” to be a very strong word. When I think of proofs, I think of deductive proofs in logic or mathematics. In philosophy, outside of logic, we usually shouldn’t claim we have proof. It is better to more conservatively claim that we have strong evidence, or good reasons, or a worthy argument for a claim rather than proof.

1st Way (and clearest) – Motion, the Unmoved Mover argument:

This is very much like the Aristotelian argument we looked at:

    Some things in this world are moved.

    Everything that is moved is moved by another.

    Everything that moves is in a state of potentiality, moving toward the state of actuality.

    Only an object in some relevant state of actuality can affect the motion of something else .

        Example: Consider a fire in a relevant state of actuality, and consider a piece of wood which has the potential to be hot. The fire moves and alters the piece of wood, making it hot.

    It is impossible for something to be simultaneously in potentiality and in actuality with respect to the same thing

        What is hot in actuality can’t be hot in potentiality as well.

        A change in degrees of temperature requires potentiality.

        There isn’t a potential to have the same temperature; that’s just what maintaining actuality is.

    Therefore, Aquinas says, “it is impossible that something should be both mover and moved in the same way and with respect to the same thing, or, in other words, that something should move itself.”

    There is not an infinite chain of movers.

        If there were an infinite chain, then there couldn’t be a first mover.

        If there is no first mover, then there can’t be any movers.

    Thus, there must be a first mover, an unmoved mover, and that is what everyone should take to be God.

Objections:

    Why should we agree that nothing can move itself?

    Why deny the infinite regress?

        More specifically, why should we agree that if there isn’t a first mover, then there can’t be any movers.

    If God is pure actuality, then it seems difficult to see how God moved anything.

        The only recourse is this “by inspiring desire” kind of movement that Aristotle gives us. But, is this really a kind of movement?



2nd Way (efficient cause):

Aquinas is taking a page straight out of Aristotle, again. Aristotle categorized “causes or aspects of change” into four fundamental types. All physical artifacts and natural objects have at least one of each of these 4 causes to explain its causation. These 4 causes explain “why” (and maybe “how”) something has been caused.

    A material cause is the aspect of change which is determined by the material a thing is made of.

        It is “that out of which” a thing is made.

        For a table, that might be wood; for a statue it might be bronze.

        The material cause is really about material composition.

    A formal cause is a change caused by the arrangement, shape or appearance of a thing.

        It is “the form” of a thing, or “the account of what-it-is-to-be” a thing.

        For the table, it is having some kind of shape, generally with legs and top. This can vary somewhat, but it has to some a table-shape.

        The ratio 2:1 is the formal cause or shape or arrangement of the octave in sound.

    An efficient cause are the agents of change. These are things interacting with the changed thing.

        It is “the primary source of the change”

        For example, the efficient cause of a table is a carpenter

        The efficient causes of a child are the biological reproducers

        The efficient cause of the statue is the sculptor or artisan

    A final cause is the aim or purpose being served by it.

        It is “the end, that for the sake of which a thing is done”

        Health is the end or final cause of dieting and exercise.

        For a seed, it might be an adult plant.

        The final cause of the kitchen table is to have a place to make and eat food, a place to sit around and talk, etc.

        The final cause of the statue is beauty or to inspire happiness or contemplation or remembrance.

The following argument focuses on the efficient cause.

For Aristotle and Aquinas, the concept of motion involves dependency, relying upon the concepts of potentiality and actuality, and not necessarily temporal succession or creation. That’s probably the main difference between the unmoved argument and the efficient cause argument. The efficient cause is conceptually bound to a temporal, causal sequence, and perhaps it deals more in bringing a thing into being rather than simple change. So, it’s likely that Aquinas thinks the efficient cause and unmoved mover arguments are relevantly different.

Aquinas’s argument:

    Argument form:

        There is an efficient cause for every sensible thing; nothing can be the efficient cause of itself.

            If something were the efficient cause of itself, then it would need to be prior to itself, which is impossible.

                You need a carpenter, as an efficient cause, to build the table. The table, before it comes into being, can’t build itself as an efficient cause.

        It is not possible to regress to infinity in efficient causes.

        If there is no first cause then there will be no others.

        Therefore, a First Cause exists (and this is God).

Objections:

    Why should we agree that it isn’t possible to have an infinite regress of efficient causes?

        Consider the initial objection, an argument from simplicity:

            If the simplest explanation is the best one:

                Perhaps an infinite regress of causes is a more simple explanation than the existence of God.

    Why should we agree that time has a beginning as Aquinas’ argument seems to assume?

        Aquinas assumes a foundation, a beginning, to prevent this infinite regress. Maybe we shouldn’t accept that foundationalist move.

        For example, maybe the universe is a circle of causes which have no foundation, but loop around in some coherent web of causes. This coherentist loop of causes might prevent the regress as well, and it doesn’t require a first-mover.

    Why does the First cause have to be God? Even if we agree there is a first cause, do we need a further argument to show why this first cause is actually God?

    Multiple First Causes

        Even if we cede much of the argument to Aquinas, why should we agree there is only one first cause?

        Maybe there are many first causes, many unmoved movers. Aquinas’ argument seems conceptually open to this possibility, right?

        If there was only one first cause, we would be more tempted to agree that first cause is God. But, for multiples, that temptation may wane.

        Of course, this doesn’t seem to defeat Aquinas’ argument - he could conceptually agree to multiple first causes and that God is one of them, but it does seem foist the burden of argument on him a bit further. Why should we think of one of those first causes as being so special that it is God?

    Without Aquinas’ understanding causality, this argument fails.

        Accidental Correlation Problem

            Just because Event B has always followed Event A, doesn’t necessarily mean Event A causes Event B – the sequence may simple be accidental correlation rather than causation.

            But, the skeptic worries this applies to all events. How then are we to truly distinguish between correlation and causation? How do we know, beyond a shadow of doubt, that causation obtains in the world? It could all just be correlation.

            I think Aquinas might be able to come back as claim this radical kind of doubt has too high an epistemic standard.

        Simultaneous Causation Problem

            You might worry that as you scope in on an instance of causation, you won’t really find causation, but rather two events happening independently and simultaneously.

            Any appearance of causation simply means you’ve not closely examined it enough. You have to magnify your scope in time and space.

            Perhaps this is also a radical kind of skepticism.

        Other Scientific Models of Causation

            Perhaps Aquinas’s theory of causation might be too simple, simplifying natural causality just in terms of a temporal sequence of causes.

            There might be better theories of causation which simply don’t allow for this kind of argument to work.

    We might worry there is a contradiction in the argument, where it seems to difficult to see why the first premise is logically consistent with the existence of God.

        The first premise states, "There is an efficient cause for everything, nothing can be the efficient cause of itself."

        Is, then, God something or nothing?

            If God is something, then we can ask, "What caused God?"

                By assumption, nothing causes itself, therefore something would have to have caused God. But, few would be willing to accept that God could be caused by anything or at least anything else.

                If you deny God was caused, then you’d have to say God is nothing.

            If God is nothing, then God's existence is not proven or perhaps even provable.

        If God is claimed to have a privileged status, an exception to this first premise, then maybe the argument becomes viciously circular or maybe there is a kind of question begging which occurs in the first premise.



Third Way (Possible and Necessary):

The Argument from Necessity:

    Since some objects in the universe come into being and pass away, it is possible either for those objects to exist or for those objects not to exist at any given time.

        i.e. The existence of some objects are contingent and aren’t necessary

    All contingent objects at some point in time didn’t exist.

    Assume for the sake of argument that: every object which exists is contingent.

        Then at some point nothing existed in the world.

        But, “What does not exist begins to exist only through something that does exist”

            i.e. No thing is created from absolutely nothing (not to be confused with creation ex nihilo, which actually posits that something exists, namely God, before everything else was created)

        Thus, given our assumption, nothing would exist now.

        But, Objects do exist now.

        Thus, our assumption is absurd. Therefore, the opposite must be true.

    Not everything which exists is contingent.

        i.e. Something is necessary, and moreover, we can trace the existence of contingent objects eventually to some necessary object (or objects).

    Every necessary object is either caused to be necessary by something else or not.

    An infinite regress of necessary objects causing the necessity of other necessary objects is impossible.

    Therefore, some necessary object is not caused by anything to be necessary. This object or being is “necessary per se.” This necessary per se being is God, and He causes all other necessary objects to be necessary.

Objections:

    Attacking the regress:

        Why should we think non-God necessary objects are caused to be necessary?

            If we deny this, it isn’t clear that Aquinas really gets to diffuse a regress with God as the foundation.

        Why should we think contingent objects didn’t exist at some point in time?

            Maybe there are some contingent objects which have always existed, and maybe exist eternally, but aren’t necessary objects.

                There might be possible worlds in which those contingent objects don’t exist.

                Remember the distinction between possible and contingent.

        Why should we agree that something contingent cannot come into existence except through something that does exist?

            i.e. why should we agree that no thing is created from absolutely nothing

    Some people might have a problem with presenting objects themselves as being necessary or contingent. Some people might consider necessity and contingency to belong to the realm of ideas alone.

        If you think it’s unacceptable to apply logical notions to objects, then Aquinas’ argument may or may not work.

        Others, like Plantinga, are more than willing to extend these logical notions to states of affairs, and perhaps even to objects.

        Perhaps we could re-interpret the argument simply in terms of propositions, but I’m not sure if it would still work.



4th way (gradations or degrees of existence in the world):

FRIENDLY REMINDER ABOUT FINAL PAPER – Due about 6 weeks from now

    There are different degrees of goodness, nobility, and “being” in things.

        Again, think of the scholastic assumption (which is also an assumption that Plato and perhaps Aristotle make) that there are degrees of existence or realness tied to goodness of the object. To Aquinas, a holy being is ethereal, not concrete, and has a higher, greater, and more real existence than tangible and more evil beings.

    “more” or “less” can only be predicated of things in relation to something which is maximally predicated in the same respect

        E.g. “the hotter something is, the closer it approaches that which is maximally hot”

        i.e. For there to be degrees of being at all, there must be something which has “being” in the highest degree.

    According to Aquinas’ take on Aristotle: something which is “maximally true” is a “maximal being”

        But, “that which is maximal in a given genus is a cause of all the things that belong to that genus”

            E.g. fire, which is maximally hot, is a cause of all hot things

        Thus, since truth, goodness, and nobility are predicates, something is maximally true, good, and noble.

    Therefore, something is a “cause for the being of all beings, their goodness, and their perfections.”

        This something, this cause, is God.

        God is this Being in the Highest Degree, this Perfect Being for which all other things on gradiant of his attributes rely upon for their existence.



Objections:

    Does this argument not also show that there is also something which is maximally evil? Should we have a problem with that?

        Maybe this is related to the first objection Aquinas is dealing with: the problem of evil.

    Why should we agree there are degrees of existence?

        Is existence something which is more like a binary switch: it either exists or it doesn’t, with nothing in between?

    Why should we agree that for something to be somewhat hot, that there must exist something which is maximally hot? And if we can deny this, can we not deny the same for all supposedly graded predicates, including goodness, nobility, and existence?

    Why should we assume, as Aquinas seems to, that “goodness” is a quality of objects?

        Without this assumption, the scholastic belief about the relationship between goodness and existence doesn’t do any work for explaining the existence of God

    Similarly, if there is a conflation between goodness and existence, one might worry that existence is taken to be a first-order predicate here. If you deny existence to be a first-order predicate of objects, then this might be a problem.



5th way (Governance – The Final Cause argument - The Teleological argument):

    Some things which lack cognition “act for the sake of an end.” (And probably all things on Aquinas’ view)

        They have a telos, a purpose, a function, a “for the sake of which” they exist and act

        Further, they are ordered and arranged toward those ends.

    These things without cognition have their telos not by chance, but by design and on purpose.

    Things without cognition “tend toward an end only if they are directed by something that has cognition and intelligence” similar to how “an arrow is directed by an archer.”

    Therefore, something with cognition and intelligence has ordered these natural things which lack cognition, and that something is God.

Objections:

    Why should we agree everything has a telos?

    Even if everything has a telos, why should we agree everything has been designed, ordered, or arranged?

        How do we know what a design, ordering, or arrangement would be like?

        Even if something is ordered, why couldn’t it simply be naturally ordered or self-organized?

    Problem of evil:

        Why should we think a God would design the world to have evil in it?

            But, this was one of the original objections Aquinas wants to answer.

    Why should we think that the God is the great designer?

        Couldn’t there be many designers? This argument doesn’t seem to rule out polytheism



Reply to Objection 1 (problem of evil):

“it is part of God’s infinite goodness that He should permit evils and elicit goods from them”

    Permit isn’t the same as design, is it?



Reply to Objection 2 (Occam’s razor suggests God doesn’t exist; there is a simpler explanation for existence):

There must be a higher agent that designs or directs nature to some end, and God is that director, designer, and first cause.





Clarke

Some immutable and independent being has always existed.

All other things are dependent on this immutable, independent being for their existence, else there is an infinite regress.

Nothing new.

Rowe

Paints in very broad strokes, and divides arguments for God’s existence into:

    a posteriori ("from the later")

    a priori (“from the earlier”).

    These are epistemic labels for beliefs, knowledge, arguments, or justifications.

        a posteriori

            a belief, knowledge, argument, or justification obtained (or obtainable) via experience

            e.g.

                I know there is a table here because I sense it, and because I trust the lighting in the room, and I trust my eyes, and I know I’m not use any hallucinogens. That knowledge is obtained via experience and sensation.

                I learned the rules and mechanics of a video game by reading about it, by being in the world, by experiencing and sensing the video game and literature surrounding it.

            Traditionally, experience is concerned with sensations. Maybe this is an oversimplification though.

        a priori

            a belief, knowledge, argument, or justification obtained (or obtainable) independently of experience

            e.g.

                Perhaps 2+2=4 is something you could know even if you had no sensations whatsoever.

                The truth that a bachelor is an unmarried male.

                I am think, therefore I am.

            A priori knowledge is traditionally considered the pinnacle of belief-types. It often is associated with absolute certainty and necessity.

                Many questions about how these work, the nature of them, etc.

    Ontological argument is a priori.

        It deals solely in concepts and thinking. You need not sense or experience the world, perhaps, to understand the argument.

    Conversely, the Cosmological argument is claimed to be a posteriori.

        It assumes the existence of the universe.

            I’m actually not immediately sold on this. On a developed solipsistic view (Descartes expanded into phenomenology), it isn’t clear to me that the cosmological argument absolutely has to be a posteriori.



    Rowe briefly traces the history of the Cosmological argument.

        He claims the first three arguments in Aquinas’ 5 ways are versions of the Cosmological argument, and he summarizes them.

        Later, Rowe considers the influence of Leibniz, Clarke, and Hume on this debate.

            This 18th century arena is where Rowe will concentrate his argument

    Rowe considers the real structure of the Cosmological argument

        Rowe says: “Now it might be objected that even if Aquinas’ arguments do prove beyond doubt the existence of an unchanging changer, an uncaused cause, and a being that could not have failed to exist, the arguments fail to prove the existence of the theistic God.”

        This objection demonstrates that the Cosmological Argument really has two parts (even if it isn’t articulated or defended that way by Aquinas)

            Rowe Claims the first stage is “the effort to prove the existence of a special sort of being.”

                Rowe wields Aquinas’ word here like the double-edged sword it is. As I said before, and as I think Rowe should be claiming in charity, we shouldn’t be charging the theist with the effort or need to prove God exists. A justified argument is good enough!

            Second stage is to demonstrate that this special sort of being which exists is actually God, with the sorts of attributes traditionally ascribed

        The arguments we read from Aquinas are only the first stage, but later in work we didn’t read, he tries to develop this second stage.

        Rowe wants to concentrate on the 1st stage of the 18th century form of this argument



    Rowe gives us some technical terms

        Dependent Being

            A being whose existence is accounted for by the causal activity of others

        A Self-existent Being

            A being whose existence is accounted for by its own nature

            At this stage, I think it might be natural to wonder why we aren’t using “Independent Being” here

    The 18th century form of the Cosmological argument seeks to establish the existence of a self-existence being.

    With the terms, Rowe states the broad-strokes version of first stage of the Cosmological Argument:

        The argument form:

            Every being (that exists or ever did exist) is either a dependent being or a self-existent being.

            Not every being can be a dependent being.

            Therefore, there exists a self-existent being.



    A brief primer in deductive validity

        Validity is concerned with the structure of arguments. Primarily:

            A valid argument is structured such that:

                If the premises are the true, then the conclusion must be true.

                    The conclusion follows from the premises as a matter of logical consequence

            Validity isn’t concerned with the truth values of the premises and conclusion, except with respect to that structure

        E.g. A valid argument

            Babe Ruth is the President of the United States

            The President of the United States is from Indiana

            Therefore, Babe Ruth is from Indiana

        This example argument is valid.

            In any possible world in which the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.

            There is no possible world in which the premises are true and the conclusion false.

            The actual world, this world, is such that the premises and conclusion are all false. In such a case, it doesn’t matter if the conclusion is true or false.

                Even if the premises are false in the actual world, the argument itself is still valid.

        E.g. Invalid argument

            Babe Ruth is not the President of the United States

            The President of the United States is not from Indiana

            Therefore, Babe Ruth is from Indiana

        The premises are true, but must the conclusion be true? Does it deductively follow from the premises?

            No! There is a possible world in which the premises are true, and the conclusion false. Our world is an example counterexample to the validity of this argument.

                The conclusion is false in this world.

            Even if we change the conclusion to be true, adjusting Indiana to Maryland, the argument is still invalid!

                Our world isn’t a counterexample world in such a case. But, we can conceive of a world in which the premises are true, and the conclusion false.

                    That we can conceive of such a world already demonstrates how it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, and thus how the structure of this argument is invalid.

            There are no counterexamples to valid arguments. A valid argument is such that you cannot, by definition, conceive of a possible world in which the premises are true and the conclusion false. Validity is a very strong claim!

        A sound argument is a valid argument in which the premises are true. Which means the conclusion must also, as a matter of logical consequence, be true.

    Is the broad-strokes first-stage of the Cosmological argument presented by Rowe valid or invalid?

        Valid.

        The question is whether or not the premises are true.

        These premises have to become the conclusion of a supporting argument, which has its own premises supporting each of these.



PSR and the First Premise

    First premise

        “Every being (that exists or ever did exist) is either a dependent being or a self-existent being.”

        At first glance, we might take this to be obvious or even a logical truth.

            This isn’t P v ~P though.

                Only if we conflate “self-existent” with “not a dependent being”

                This is almost trivial

        Is there a possible difference between “a being not explained by others” and “a being explained by itself” (a self-existent being)?

            Rowe thinks it isn’t obvious that there isn’t a difference.

    Anselm’s Three Cases – a 3-pronged disjunction…Everything is either…

        A. Explained by another (dependent)

        B. Explained by nothing (or, i.e., doesn’t have an explanation)

        C. Explained by Itself (self-existent)

    The first premise claims that “for all things, it is either of sort A or of Sort C.”

        This is the denial of anything being of sort B. It is the claim that no thing is explained by nothing.

        That makes it non-obvious and non-trivial in Rowe’s eyes.

    Anselm also accepts this principle:

        “whatever exists has an explanation of its existence”

            This is the denial of sort B.

        Hence, with this principle, it would be reasonable to adopt the first premise.

            Since this principle denies one of the disjunctions, we’re only left with this 2-pronged claim which is identical to our first premise

    18th century proponents of the Cosmological argument were also convinced of this principle, but by that time, it was also known as a crucial part of the “Principle of Sufficient Reason” (PSR or PoSR).

    PoSR has two parts:

        Restatement of Anselm’s claim: “There is a sufficient reason or explanation for the existence of any thing”

            Rowe calls this PSRa

            PoSR is more complicated though, and perhaps PSRa is incomplete. We can consider an example to understand why.

            E.g. I am in this room.

                The first part shows there must, at the very least, be an explanation for my existence.

                    But, note, not how, or why, or when, or where, or what I exist as. Many parts of this claim go beyond just my existing.

                There are other “positive” facts besides my existence, and the first part doesn’t require an explanation of those other facts.

                    I’m overweight. I like philosophy. I like beer. I’m in this room rather than at home.

                These attributes, predications, or facts aren’t required to have explanations on this first Anselmian part.

        This second part of the PoSR requires an explanation of positive facts.

            On the PoSR, there isn’t just a reason for my existence, but there must be a reason why I like beer. An explanation sufficient for it. The same is true for all facts about me, and all you all, and every thing.

        Hence, there is also a sufficient reason or explanation “of any positive fact”

            We’ll call this PSRb

    Rowe claims the Cosmological argument accept both full PSR, both PSRa and PSRb

        Maybe it doesn’t, or maybe it doesn’t have to.

        PSRa is the justification for the first premise of the Cosmological argument.

    Maybe this is what we are after:

        PSRa & PSRb -> PSR -> Cosmo Premise 1 and 2 -> Cosmo Conclusion & Second Stage of Cosmo -> God exists

            We know the latter stage from Cosmo premise 1 and 2 to 1st Stage Cosmo conclusion is valid.

            We know the first stage is valid by definition

            We don’t know about this middle stage

    Rowe wants to consider the validity of this middle inference

        He wants to consider whether it is correct to think that “if the PSR is true, then both premises of the Cosmological argument true.”

        If Rowe can show otherwise, and he can show that the PSR is not a valid argument for both premises of the Cosmological argument, then there would need to be a different justification of these premises of the Cosmological argument.

            But, it isn’t obvious what other sort of justification we might give.

            This might be a damning objection

        PSR’s “a part” validly supports the first Cosmological Premise

        Now, we need to figure out if the second premise can be validly supported by the PSR.

    Afterwards, we may want to consider whether or not the PSR is actually true.

        Even if the PSR validly supports the Cosmological premises, that doesn’t make the PSR true.

            Remember, just because an argument is valid doesn’t make it sound.

            We might be asking too much in truth and proof.

            At some point, we might not be able to know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, whether or not a proposition is true.

                We can for mathematical claims, like 2+2=4. We can be certain of the truth of it.

                But, can you know with the same force and certainty for other propositions, like, there is an external world and we don’t live in the Matrix.

                    You can’t provide a proof of it. At some high standard of knowledge, we can doubt it.

            Rowe knows that going for certainty and outright truth or falsity here just might be available to us. We might not be able to make a convincing argument either way to demonstrate truth or falsity.

        Rowe is trying to figure out if we can be rationally justified in accepting PSRa and PSRb.

            Rowe is going after rational acceptability, a weaker notion and separate notion from truth.

            Back to the Matrix example:

                You all still want to say someone is rational when they believe they don’t live in the Matrix though, right?

                    The claim “We aren’t in the Matrix” is rationally acceptable, even if don’t know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it is true.

        Rowe is conceding the following:

            If we are rationally justified in believing the PSR, and if the PSR validly supports the Cosmological premises, then we are rationally justified in asserting the Cosmological Conclusion.



The Second Premise

“Not every being can be a dependent being.”

    The proponent of this premise thinks there is something fundamentally wrong with an infinite regress of dependent beings caused or explained by other dependent beings.

    “A series” example

        Assume for some specific time slice there only exists one being, A1, a living thing, and a dependent being.

            Since it is dependent, something else had to bring it into existence

        In a previous time slice, A1 was brought into existence by something else, A2, which perished shortly after it brought A1 into existence.

            Hence, only A1 exists at this time slice

        We can see that A2, similarly might need an explanation or cause, let’s say the same kind of story occurs, only with A3.

        And for the same can be said for A3 from A4, and so on and so forth into the past.

        Each of these beings in the A series is a dependent being.

            It “owes its existence” or is explained by the preceding A in the series

        We have an infinite regress in this A series of dependent beings.

    Rowe claims the Cosmologist must show there is “something wrong with the idea” or “view” of this infinite regress.

        This is slightly ambiguous

        If there is a difference between idea and view, I would say that an idea is a concept. To show there is something wrong with the concept of the infinite regress is a higher task than showing something is just wrong with a view possibly.

            I’m not sure if Rowe is asking too much of his opponent here.

    Rowe claims a “popular but mistaken idea of how the proponent tries to show that something is wrong with the view” goes as follow:

            There must be a first being to start any causal series.

            If every being were dependent there would be no first being to start the causal series.

            Therefore, not every being can be a dependent being.

        Valid argument, 2nd premise is true, but the 1st isn’t obviously true.

            In fact, it seems to just be begging the question.

        Note that the proponents in question are the 18th century Cosmologists

        This is actually a part of one of the arguments Aquinas gave us. So, as far as generally how the Cosmological Argument goes, this is perhaps one of the ways in which proponents try to show what is wrong with the view,” but it may be a mistake to attribute this view to the 18th century Cosmologists

        Rowe claims “there seems to be no good reason for making” the assumption that the infinite regress of dependent beings without a first does not or cannot obtain.

            (note that you can have a first, then an infinite series afterward…but this isn’t a regress!)

            That might be correct. Seem like there are ways to attack this though.

            I worry there may be disagreement here which we can’t resolve on argumentation alone. For all I know, this may be one of those points in philosophy where it is okay to rely on your intuitions, and some people just have intuitions that deny the infinite regress, and so this rationally acceptable.

                There are many, many definitions and ways to talk about rational acceptability. So many unclear things here.

        18th century Cosmologists “recognized that the causal series of dependent beings could be infinite, without a first member to start the series”

        18th Century Cosmologists “rejected the idea that every being that is or ever was is dependent not because there would then be no first member,” but rather “because there would then be no explanation for the fact that there are have always been dependent beings.”

    Back to the A-series example.

        “no individual A” in the series has an unexplained existence

            No particular being is unexplained, apparently

                Although, if the series itself isn’t explained, then it isn’t clear its components are explained either

            Apparently, this satisfies PSRa, according to Rowe (although, maybe you’d want to deny that)

        The 18th Century Cosmologist thinks the series itself lacks an explanation.

            As Rowe likes to express it “The fact that there are and have always been dependent beings” remains unexplained.

                This seems to be a violation of PSRb, which Rowe believes the 18th Century Cosmologist agrees to and/or needs.

            What happens when we seek a reason or explanation of the entire A series?

                Rowe admits that we can’t explain the series by saying there is a series. That would be circular.

        The supposition of an infinite regress of dependent beings causing dependent beings cannot be explained. There can’t be an explanation for it.

            There is nothing outside the series, and only something outside the series could explain the series.



Questioning the justification of the second premise

There are critiques of this lack of explanation of the series as a whole.

    1st, Treats the series of dependent beings as itself a dependent being.

        E.g. The series of dependent beings is no more a dependent being than a collection of stamps is a stamp.

        There is a trick to this one though. A lot of metaphysical problems sit at the root of this critique, and the Cosmologist has plenty of ammo to respond.

        The analogy between beings and stamps is made too quickly. What exactly is a “being”?

            This critique seems to imply that we can reduce any collection of beings down to the constituent beings. That no being is the result of a collection or series of beings.

                Why should we agree to that?

            I’m a being, right?

                Are the things which constituent me also beings? Probably!

                    The cells in me are beings, and all the cells are ordered in such a way that something greater seems to come out of it.

                I’m also a being in time.

                    Part of who I am isn’t some time slice, but rather my identity passing through time. I’m a changing being, a person who moves, and that sequence or series of is still me.

                        All the cells in my body have been replaced several times, but I’m still the same being.

                    We can think of me as a series of being through time. The whole of which is greater than just the sum of its constituent parts through time.

                        But, if I don’t just reduce down, then perhaps the cosmologist has a really good point about how the series of dependent beings might itself be a being or at least something which itself needs an explanation.

        I fear this critique uses a very narrow definition of “being,” and that the PSR proponents still have plenty of rational, justifiable positions in metaphysics which support their view here.

    2nd: Mistakenly infers that because each member of the collection of beings has a cause that the collection itself must have a cause.

        E.g. Russell: As fallacious as inferring that because each member of the human race has a mother than the collection has a mother.

        My worry with this is that if the Cosmologist can answer the first criticism by arguing the series is a kind of being (a complex one), then this objection no longer holds.

            The reason this objection works, if it works, is because of the problem in the first criticism.

    3rd: Hume: A failure to realize that “for there to be an explanation of a collection of things is nothing more than for there to be an explanation of each of members of that collection.”

        I.e. Explanation for the whole is entirely reducible to explanations for the constituent parts

        But, by definition, each member of the A-series has an explanation (the preceding, N+1, member). So, on this view, since all the members are explained, then the entire series is explained.

    4th: Why can’t we just claim that the series itself has no explanation, as a “brute fact.”

        Maybe this seems to be begging the question in the other direction if we take it as defeating the Cosmologist or PSR proponent.

            I see no more reason to accept the brute fact of “no explanation” for the series as I do for the brute fact of an explanation.

        However, perhaps this point really shows is that there is no reason to believe one way or the other. But, so what?

            Sometimes we have to guess in human life, and that’s okay.

            We can make pragmatic moves in epistemology.

            Consider a case in which I have to leap from a burning building into one of two dumpsters, or I’m going to die in the fire. Perhaps I know that one of the dumpsters will be a cushion and the other is filled is glass (presumably killing me), but I don’t know which is which.

                Presumably, it is pragmatic and prudent to make a guess. I’m justified in guessing. It is rational to take one side, or to take the other. I’m not more justified in one or the other, but I’m justified in taking one of them.

        Can’t the Cosmologist come back and say, “well, you can accept that rationally, but I can also deny it, rationally.” We are both justified.

            This lacks the same oomph, since the cosmologist would prefer an argument for the existence of God that extends to all intuitions. But, at the very least, I think the cosmologist can respond to this criticism by turtling up, and recognizing that the best he can do is justify his own belief, and not much more.



Responses to Criticisms

    1st: Rowe grants the Stamp mistake, and thinks “it is very likely a mistake to think that the collection of dependent beings is itself a dependent being.”

        Just because the Cosmologist thinks the collection of dependent beings needs an explanation is not sufficient grounds for concluding the collection is itself a dependent being.

            This only seems to be a great criticism is we deny the first premise (which if we denied it, would already be the end of the argument).

            What’s the other option? If we accept the First premise (every being is either dependent or self-existent), then the other option is that the series itself is self-existent.

                This is an odd move.

                At first glance, I’m tempted to think anything which being constituted by dependent beings must itself be dependent, right?

                    If so, then this seems to be answer.

                Hence, if we argue the series can’t be self-existent, but it is a being which requires explanation, then by the first premise, it must be a dependent being.

        Rowe doesn’t do anything with this.

    2nd: Attributes the following reasoning:

            Every member of the collection of dependent beings has a cause or explanation

            Therefore, the collection of dependent beings has a cause or explanation

        I worry this is a kind of strawman. My bet is that the cosmologist is supporting the conclusion with more premises than just the 1st, and it is these premises which Rowe really needs to flesh out and criticize.

        The examples of “having a mother” or “lightness of marbles” might be radically different predicates from “whether or not something is a being” or “being a dependent being.”

            I’m just not sure the analogy follows.

        Rowe doesn’t think the Cosmologist even needs to use this inference.

            Instead, the positive “fact that there exists a collection of dependent beings” requires immediately requires an explanation by the PoSR. No other inference is required.

                Thus, this “fact” move enables the PSR proponent to avoid the first two criticisms.

                    Although, I’m not convinced the PSR proponent must rely upon the second stage of the PSR, this “fact.” They might be able to successfully diffuse these criticisms simply in terms of beings and metaphysics. If the Cosmologist can demonstrate the series is a being, then these two criticisms fail, even without appealing to the “facts” require an explanation move.

    3rd: Rowe claims this reductive explanation critique rests upon an assumption the Cosmologist would not accept.

        Assumption: “to explain the existence of a collection of things it is sufficient to explain the existence of every member in the collection”

        The 18th Century Cosmologist requires two conditions for explaining the collection of dependent beings:

            C1: There is an explanation of the existence of each of the members of the collection of dependent beings

            C2: There is an explanation of why there are any dependent beings.

                I wonder if the “collection” itself is a being, is the explanation for it any different from this explanation?

                The 3rd criticism claims that satisfying C1 results in or is the same as satisfying C2 (or C2 is reducible to C1)

        Rowe gives us an examples of a self-existent being causing all the dependent beings. His intuition, from looking at these examples, is to agree with Cosmologist against the 3rd Critique.

            Explaining each things individually doesn’t show why the whole is explained.

                “Why are the dependent being at all?” just isn’t reducible on Rowe’s view.



The Truth of PSR

Rowe considers the final criticism and again outlines the argument.

    To support the first Cosmological premise, the Cosmologist uses PSRa.

    To support the second premise, the Cosmologist uses PSRb (about facts).

        Essentially, we’ve agreed to Cosmo premise 1, that for each being, it is either dependent or self-existent, then if every being were dependent (and hence there are no self-existent beings), then PSRb couldn’t be satisfied. Namely, there isn’t an explanation for the fact of the collection of dependent beings as a collective whole.

    Here Rowe seems to accept the validity of all the chain of arguments. Now, his only attack is to argue either against the truth of the PSR (which he doesn’t seem to think is worthwhile), or that the PSR is unjustified.

    Why should we believe the PSR?

    Two defenses of the PSR:

        PSR is intuitively true

            Here, “intuition” is associated with apodicticity, certain, and absoluteness.

                It’s more than just being confident, or having evidence.

            Once you “fully understand and reflect” on the meaning of the PSR, then you must know it is true.

                Knowing that every triangle has exactly 3 angles is something you know to be intuitively true. It is certain. It may even be known a priori.

                    Perhaps this would make the Cosmological argument rests upon a priori truth.

                Similarly, my daughter might deny that .999 repeating is identical to 1, but upon further reflection of what .999 really is…you’ll realize it must be identical to 1.

                        1/9 = .111

                        9 X 1/9 = .999

                        1 = .999

                    My daughter just didn’t fully understand the concept of .999 repeating.

                    Once she does, then she’ll know it is certainly true. It is intuitively true at this stage.

            The problem, of course, is that the opponents of the PSR will claim they fully understand the PSR, but still deny it. Something which is intuitively true is not doubtable if you really understand it (much like the Ontological argument). But, since the PSR is doubted, if the doubters really do understand the PSR, then the PSR is not intuitively true.

        PSR is a presupposition of reason, a basic assumption of rational people

            Even if we all presuppose something, that doesn’t make it true. It is possible the PSR is still false, and hence, possible that we can’t reach the Cosmological conclusion.

    Unfortunately, Rowe was too quick, and left us with what I believe is a false dichotomy. The Cosmologist need not argue that this is a presupposition of reason (or that it is intuitively true).

        Somehow, Rowe failed to really go after the justification of the PSR here.

        It seems possible that the Cosmologist can argue that it the PSR is non-obvious, that it isn’t a presupposition of reason, but that, nevertheless, it is rationally justifiable to believe the PSR is true.

        Rowe showed us only that the PSR might be false with this 4th criticism, but he did nothing to show why we aren’t or can’t be justified in believing it. But, that is exactly what he must do, since he’s agreed the argument chain from PSR to the 1st Cosmological Conclusion is valid.

    Rowe concludes the Cosmological argument is valid, and it may even be sound, but that it might also be unsound (the premises, the PSR namely, may be false).

        He thinks there is no good rational basis for believing the PSR.

            Why should we agree to that though?

The Cosmologist has a lot of tools to defend themselves. Rowe and the Cosmologist may fundamentally disagree on what counts as rationality, rational acceptability, and justification. It does seem like the Cosmologist is in a good position to show how they are rationally justified though, even minimally, and that’s all they need to get past Rowe.

Note that all of this is for the 1st stage of the Cosmological argument. It is another argument to demonstrate why this special, self-existent being, the cause of all things, this unmoved mover, is the theist’s God. That said, the 2nd stage may or may not be a huge leap.

One of the brilliant things about the Cosmological argument is how it takes a serious, perhaps reasonable stance in metaphysics and epistemology which doesn’t seem to have anything to do with God in the first place, a seemingly secular foundation, and argues toward the existence of God.
