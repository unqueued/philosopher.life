Book 12; §7 and §9
Brief Overview:
    • Actuality’s priority to Potentiality
    • Potentiality and perishability;  Separation of 3 kinds of substance
    • The nature and configuration of the Cosmos, Heavens, etc.
    • God
        ◦ Pure actuality; Eternal and unchanging
        ◦ Unmoved mover; causation through inspiring love
        ◦ Self-thinking thought and Eternal contemplation
        ◦ Content of divine thought: He is thinking of thinking

Book 12.7
1072a19-1072a36:
    • Heaven: circular, unceasing motion
    • Heavens, like all other things (besides God), is an intermediate; these require an Unmoved mover to cause motion in them.
    • God is eternal and pure actuality.
    • The nature of God’s causation isn’t billiard balls hitting billiard balls, but rather things are moved by their love for God. 
1072b13-1694:
    • God is the ultimate cause.
    • God remains unmoved, and yet things move because of God.
    • Heaven changes through circular locomotion.
    • Heaven isn’t created, and there is no beginning to the process of its motion, but its motion is still caused by God.
    • The Heaven’s circular motion is an expression of the love for God.
    • God’s existence is a necessary one; he has the highest status as pure actuality.
1072b31-1695:
    • Everything depends on God.
    • God’s activity is thinking.
        ◦ Humans partake in this activity temporarily. In a sense, when we are actually thinking, we participate in God, briefly.
    • God thinks about something truly important. He thinks about thinking.
1073a13-1695:
    • God is an infinite cause
    • God has no body or spatial existence.
    • God has no parts and is indivisible.
Book 12.9
1074b34-1698:
    • God isn’t thinking about nothing.
    • The content of God’s thought is dignified, both what is most divine and precious.
    • God doesn’t change and what He thinks about doesn’t change.
    • God is thinking about His thinking; He is self-thinking thought.
1075a4-1698:
    • Pure thought is about the immaterial and the essence.
    • There is no distinction between divine thought and the object of divine thought.
    • God thinks about Himself in that He is thinking about thinking. 
1075a10-1699:
    • God thinks about something which is indivisible, He is indivisible, and He thinks about Himself
    • God cannot think of anything but Himself thinking because he can’t be moved by anything else.
