title: Virtue is Knowledge

//See: [[Axioms of h0p3]]//

---

From my standpoint: 

//Virtue is Knowledge//

[[<=>]]

//[Virtue] is [Wisdom] is [A Unique, Normative Kind of Practical Knowledge]//

[[<=>]]

//[Virtue (for me)] is [Wisdom (for me)] is [Knowledge (for me is my habiturally trained [[intuitions networks|Intuition Networks]]) in our [[fastmind|Fastmind]]]//

[[<=>]]

//Virtue is Intuition//

Or, perhaps Virtue isn't really knowledge, it's a very special kind of knowledge. Virtue requires developing excellence/mastery embedded in the Intuition networks of our fastmind. This is our moral psychology. 

This is incredibly in line with the literature. The Triune Greek Philosopher Gods were fucking geniuses. They were incredibly in touch with who they were to have deduced what they did with what little evidence they had.

[[RPIN]]: ....or....that is the natural state of memetic evolution. You are just getting in tune with the ancient beast inside you (that set of intuitions we are born with from evolution, embedded in ), the oldschool natural way, but now you know far more about these beasts and should take up a different position that people who lived thousands of years ago.

Virtue is Knowledge is concerned with the relationship between Theory and Practice.
