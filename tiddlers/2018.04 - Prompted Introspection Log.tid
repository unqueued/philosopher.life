!! Audit:

* I doubt anyone else cares, but these make me laugh. I like making myself happy. =)
* Some of these are very short. Have I kind of given up trying to say anything? I don't know.
* I enjoy reducing questions to absurdity.
* You know, I'm okay with these short answers. I'm looking back on them, and they do what I want. I feel like reading the body of my work gives plenty context to interpret these reasonably.
* My homemade acronyms are what I needed.
* I feel like a particularist, contextualist, and virtue theorist answering so many of these questions.
* I've had to discuss friendships, and I have to say, I've shed many over the years.
* Many of these answers would leave a bad taste in the mouths of most people I've met.
* I give the same answers [literacy, philosophy, and socialism] to so many of these questions. What can I say? I'm strongly convinced of it.
* Neato. I was Rabbitholed in one of these. I love that.
* I like it when my children respond, disagree, add to, etc. what I've said.
* I'm highly skeptical. That's fine.
* God damn, I didn't hold back in some of these. I just let it rip.
* I'm cleaning up the numbering. There's no need for it.
* I can't say I'm blown away by my introspections this month. That's okay. You win some, you lose some.
