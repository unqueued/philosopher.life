!! Audit:

* So simple, so elegant, and so fucking obvious. I feel so stupid for not just doing it. 
** Forgive yourself. This isn't about fault, and it's spilled milk. Do your best, and enjoy what you have. Be pragmatic and stoic.
* I feel so productive, and I'm happy with my weekends.
* I stopped using crossthroughs.
* I don't always get everything done, but I get the majority it.
* I think the use of it isn't actually have a list that I look at to see what I need to get done, but rather just taking the time to even think about what I even want to accomplish in my scant freetime. 
* I still don't quite have it figured out. I don't know what does or doesn't belong on the list, why, etc. 
** Give it time and practice, yo!
