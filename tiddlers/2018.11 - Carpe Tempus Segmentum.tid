!! Audit:

* I've been drinking a lot this month.
* My sleep has felt more normal, but that might not be the case.
* I've had less sex this month than usual.
* I've done a good job of trying to expand on aspects of my day. There is real content here.
* It's clear that I've been socializing IRL quite a bit this month.
** Good job!
* Been doing the digital sportsball thing with League and Chess.
* Guitar came and went. 
** Cool. Play it in spells if you want.
* I think I've been overeating this month.
* Caffeine and headaches have been common.
* Somehow, I feel unproductive this month. =/ 
** Is that really a fair assessment?
*** Done a fine job applying for jobs (and found one)
*** Fixed the dryer and apartment
*** Good job [[FTO]]ing, including T-Day week with the in-laws.
* We all enjoyed sending something to [[Sphygmus]]. It wasn't much, but it was fun.
* I've been exploring video and music.
* I've been hyperreading and [[deep reading]] less.
** I'm feeling distraught about this.
