Disappointing. As a Christian who seeks truth that incorporates all that modern science and history support, this book falls short. In the final chapter, "Love the Truth" Vitale berates the various worldviews that hold on to partial truths, stating, "don't assume that in discovering a partial truth you have discovered the whole truth" A wise observation. Unfortunately every chapter in this book violates. Claiming exclusivity for loving others before self even to death as solely a Christian tenet is but one example when books like Modern Buddhism ( Geshe Kelsang Gyatso) and many humanism treatise state otherwise. Social justice is another that is a fundamental tenet of Stoicism and Humanism. Other beliefs are characterized in glib fashion and then dismissed. The most extreme and radical spokesmen are quoted, painting a hostile, hate filled closed minded stereotype when the vast majority of people holding these worldviews are loving, caring, human beings who often serve others. The book needs to start by acknowledging that if it is to help those of us searching for in depth exploration of the tough questions. Questions like, can Christianity accommodate all knowledge that the last century has provided and reconcile the significant evolution of Judeo Christian culture and beliefs from its orthodox roots. Even with my limited knowledge and research I find too many errors and fallacies leading me to myself wonder are the authors that ignorant or just that biased? What is needed is for the book to be expanded to allow non radical advocates from these other philosophies to respond to the claims the authors make. Until that happens this book will sadly simply assuage the ignorant and satisfy Christian bigots who are too fearful to explore unsettling questions. And the mass exodus of loving, educated and curious will continue.

The “-isms” are also Religions?

“Jesus Among Secular Gods” argues that the alternatives to religion, their list includes atheism, scientism, pluralism, humanism, relativism and hedonism, collectively referred to as the “-isms,” are themselves religions. Actually, there are two big differences.

Supernaturalism, of course, is the big distinction. Religious belief posits that there is a spiritual universe that exists along side of the physical universe. Naturalists (which is what we “atheists” should be called) first look for natural explanations of phenomena we don’t understand. We hold that there have been no questions about the physical universe, the mechanics of the solar system, chemistry, biology, neurology, …, so far, that require a supernatural explanation. The key word is ‘require.’ That does not say we know everything. It says that for those questions for which we don’t have solid answers, in particular, those that might have a supernatural explanation, the reasonable likelihood of a natural explanation persists and often strongly so. That’s because we have a very high standard of proof. We don’t easily jump to the supernatural explanation.

I believe, however, that epistemology is the more important difference. Zaharias and Vitale are absolutists. They have absolute belief. They believe Jesus was crucified, died, was buried and rose again on the third day - absolutely. No shadow of a doubt. This is as true as the Moon orbits around the Earth, or even more so. They seem to think, however, that this absolutism of belief also applies to the “-isms” as well. Moreover, they seem to think that the only alternative to this absolutism of belief is relativism, and specifically the relativism they choose to describe. They are wrong.

The word "truth" has to mean something! Zaharias and Vitale seem to think that “truth” is like salt and pepper we sprinkle around to make the dish more palatable. Truth is an important word. When someone makes a truth claim, especially absolute truth, he must justify that claim. Prove it! And if your claim is absolute, your proof must also be.

Let’s compare this absolute belief “world view” with scientific epistemology. Science does not prove anything, certainly not in an absolute sense. Scientific theories are models of reality, each having a limited domain of application. They can be very good. As Feynman showed us, Quantum Mechanics has been verified with an accuracy equivalent to determining the distance from Boston to Pasadena to within the thickness of a human hair. And yet, we know that our modern Quantum Mechanics is not the last word. If only the Bible could be so unambiguous about slavery, or incest.

Zaharias and Vitale argue there is only one kind of this “relativism,” the kind that makes everything an arbitrary personal choice. They claim that by choosing ones own morality, the atheist put himself in God’s shoes. (Seriously folks, is that not an astounding leap.)

We all make relative judgements about likelihood of truth propositions. Seldom, if ever, do we assign 100% absolute certainty. Will the sun rise tomorrow? Very, very likely! However, there is always a chance that our solar system will be blown away by a super-Nova in our galactic neighborhood. So, it is not 100% absolutely likely that the sun will rise. Is that what the authors are calling “relativism”? After all, I am making a relative judgment about the likelihood of events. Relativism? I’d call it realism. Call it what you like, but you can’t call it arbitrary!

Isn’t it ironic that scientific epistemology, the one that is always wide-eyed open to new evidence and insists on logical reasoning, is the one that has shown us the universe. Zaharias and Vitale base their absolute beliefs in inconsistent bronze age texts, many written decades if not a century after Christ died. The one that claims no supernatural insight is the one that has revealed universe to us. The other formerly insisted the world was flat, then the Earth is the center of the universe, … and now they insist that the immortal soul is imbued at the moment that already living sperm and egg cells join to merge their DNA. (Just where is that in the scripture?) Somehow, after repeatedly having been shown to be wrong, religion still claims to have absolute insight into such questions. Exactly just who is arrogant here? Mr. Zaharias, ‘just where do you get off?’

10 to the What are You Talking About?

Vitale covers the “fine-tuning” argument at some length. This is the only reasonable argument they have, although the anthropic principle has not been overturned, so they don’t have an absolute proof. Fine-tuning only gets them (possibly) as far as the Diest creator God of Jefferson and Paine. There is a huge distinction between a creator God who doesn’t interfere with the natural world, and the God of the Bible with all of the minutia that entails.

Vitale cites Sir Roger Penrose calculation of a probability of 1 in 10 to the power of 10 to the power 123, which Vitale calls “the odds of life.” The citation is a YouTube post, which I listened to several times. Penrose calculated the number of possible initial states of the Universe at the big bang. The universe that we know evolved from this initial condition. It was just one out of a super-astronomical number of possibilities. Adjusting that initial condition even slightly would result in a different evolved universe, one that may or may not include us. But that’s not to say this particular initial condition is the ONLY one that generates life. Using the same Schrodinger equation with all its “finely-tuned” constants, all of these initial conditions may eventually generate life. Not us, but some other life.

What Penrose was actually talking about is determinism. This is all the rage among “atheists” scientists and philosophers. Not the “determinism” that Zaharias babels about, but good old-fashion Laplacian style particle-by-particle determinism. Free will is an illusion. How did they miss ranting incessantly on that controversy?

On Evolution

At one point, Vitale refers to “the principle of survival of the fittest.” The principle is NATURAL SELECTION - two words they cannot even bring themselves to write in the book. “Survival of the fittest” is the consequence, not the principle. Fools! Natural selection can be analyzed with mathematics. Evolutionary biologists can make calculations and predictions, and then verify them with real world measurements. That’s because evolutionary biology is science!

In the chapter on Relativism, Zaharias tells us “The fact is that even scientists simply do not make a convincing case for an ‘earthbound’ theory of origins. I do not speak of process. I speak of the starting point. Science has to remain silent on it at this point.” Then citing a paper from the 70’s, he says “as they calculated the odds that the functional proteins necessary for life might form in one place by random events - a staggering 1 chance in 10 to the 40,000th power.”

That is an incredibly small likelihood, and it is also completely irrelevant. I spent a good part of may career working in a branch of probability theory dealing with the calculation of very small probabilities. So, I really cringe when creationists trot out this old trope about the probability of “randomly generated life.”

Abiogenesis, the science of how life was generated from the chemistry and physical environments of the early Earth, is not just a matter of randomly colliding molecules all at one place at one time. You have to consider the all the possible environmental conditions, and all the sequences of all those environments. One environment (say, near deep ocean vents) may be right to create certain classes of molecules, that then drift to other environments (say the ocean surface bathed in ultraviolet light) that can use those building blocks to create even more complex molecules. Of course, I’m just speculating. The point is that in order to do this probability calculation you must consider all possible environments, and all the possible sequences and interactions of those environments. That is a much much harder calculation than simple random collisions of molecules. In fact, it is a calculation that is quite impossible to do.

Nonetheless, laboratory experiments replicating conditions of early Earth had already generated amino acids (building blocks of proteins), in 1952! More recently, scientists have generated two of the four building blocks of RNA - the replicator molecular cousin of DNA. Once you have a replicator molecule, its off to the races with natural selection. Our knowledge of the origin of life is very limited. Still, the Earth is not flat, we are not the center of the universe, and the finger of evidence is pointing towards natural abiogenesis of life on Earth.

"Science has to remain silent”? In areas where you don't know what you are talking about, perhaps you should follow your own advice, Mr. Zachariah.

So here’s the question. Why would these authors even bring up these ridiculous randomness arguments? As with the Penrose probability, they are just throwing out red herrings. They must know that scientists have criticized creationists for decades now about these false characterizations. Yet they still trot out the same old crap. Alas, we are confronted with two possibilities. Either they believe what they wrote, or they are playing to the presumed ignorance of their readers. Zaharias and Vitale are smart people. They must know these things. And if they didn’t know, a quick search on Wikipedia would have rectified that situation in five minutes. Unfortunately, that leaves us with the latter of the two possibilities.

What does this Lead To?

There are numerous reason “Jesus Among Secular Gods” is intellectual rubbish. I've only touched on a few specifics. They argue that the burden of proof is to the atheist to prove there is no God. You make a truth claim, and then, I have to disprove it or we just have to take it as factual truth. Really? What kind of logic is that? They make lists of “possibilities," and then ask the reader which one he or she wants to be true. But we know that what we want to be true has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not it is actually true. The word truth must mean something, at least something beyond our desires.

The authors warn us about where the -isms lead. “… the denial of God is itself foolishness and leads to a degeneration that is celebratory of things commonly considered perverse.” Thank you for that opinion. Are they talking about the homosexuals here? The Bible says that both eating shrimp and homosexuality are abominations before God. Eating shrimp seems to be perfectly acceptable now. How is it that you can pass judgment with such absolute certainty on one abomination, and ignore the other? Is this a relativistic interpretation of the Bible?

Let’s ask - what does absolute religious belief lead to? The answer is an uncanny ability to stare evidence in the face and deny it. It is certainly true that in spite of 150 years of confirmatory evidence, and not one instance of falsification, evangelical Christians still generally reject the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. There are lots of books, written by real scientist, that present the actual evidence for Evolution - not the cartoon apologist's sketch. There is also a strong correlation between evangelicals and climate science denial? Why is that? Climate science is based on straightforward application of physics and chemistry - which has been known since at least 1892! The details are complex, but predictions have been made and validated measurements. Yet - they cry - hoax! A conspiracy!

Ignorance! That’s where absolutist religion leads. Certainly not to truth.

I want to emphasize what I liked about JASG: namely, the ways Zacharias and Vitale represent their own Christian faith with concrete examples and truly touching connections between scripture and modern life. I can write this because I am a Christian who, like Zacharias and Vitale, understands that I live and work among secular-minded people.

But I found it more challenging when the authors took on representatives of atheism, humanism, hedonism, and other schools of thought. To this degree, it didn't seem like an honest debate. The claims of people like Stephen Hawking or Richard Dawkins tended to be cherry picked. I didn't really find the counterclaims persuasive, such as when Zacharias used probability (of life appearing at random) to take on scientific claims about life's origins. I can write this because I grew up in a fundamentalist environment, and I have tried to maintain my faith while escaping the circular reasoning of my own past, radical "isms".

One quote really stood out to me in the conclusion of the book:

    Each (of the anti-Christian 'isms') takes a partial explanation and claims for it explanatory omnipotence.



Isn't this what the Bible itself is? The author of Genesis had never seen a telescope, so he constructed an earth-centered Creation. He knew very little about photosynthesis, so he imagined a world where trees and plants existed for 24 hours or more without the sun, moon and stars. He provides a partial explanation that served readers for hundreds of years. It is only in the past 120 years that any readers--fundamentalist Christians--have tried to twist his words into "explanatory omnipotence."

Vitale and Zacharias refer a number of times to a "personal relationship" with the Christian God, which we all know is a concept that didn't widely exist in Christianity until after the 2nd World War.

Zacharias ends the book with an exhortation for Christians to live lives of love and open sacrifice. I can get behind that counter-cultural claim!

This is a work of Christian apologia that will inspire Christian readers, but I'm not sure if it works outside of a readership that isn't already devout. I just can't imagine skeptics taking these arguments seriously.
