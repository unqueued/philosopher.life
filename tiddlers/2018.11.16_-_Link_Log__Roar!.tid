** https://medium.com/@haroldbarber/moral-pattern-discretionism-e636ba89b018
*** This is fucking gorgeous. It's also empty like virtue theory. All it can do it provide us a description of our moral psychology. This is only metaethics in terms of enabling us to understand the limits of our moral agency.
