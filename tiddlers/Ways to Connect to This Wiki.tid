title: Ways to Connect to This Wiki

!! About:

//In almost all likelihood, if you are here, then I asked you to come here. Whether I'm justified or not, I must trust you a lot. For the rest of you, randos and unexpected guests: [[hello|Finding The Others]], and good luck!//<<ref "1">>

If you are reading this for the first time, you may initially believe this page somewhat useless. It is not useless. The world changes faster and faster. I don't know how the world is going to turn out, and so this section will help you maintain a connection to this wiki even through technical turbulence and political turmoil. 

I'm sorry if you think this website is slow to load for you. I'm not going to pay the prices necessary to speed it up because I don't think it's worth my time. Someone who is going to be willing to spend time actually trying to understand this wiki will have no problem waiting several seconds for the compressed file to download. Perhaps this will be changed later, but I'm fine with it for now.

If speed or whatever kind of availability really matters to you in a particular way, then help me mirror and decentralize it with your preferred tools and systems.

I provide real-time updates, but I also keep several redundancies, deltas, and backups. They serve different purposes. Obviously, this wiki changes. For posterity's sake, transparency, fixing my fuck-ups, finding patterns in my thought, and enabling a broader range of data science practices in generating and thinking about this wiki, I keep a //daily snapshot collection// of this wiki. May it be a gift to anyone who cares for it.<<ref "2">> May it be a proof of proofs, another source: of interpreting who I am, for demonstrating my integrity, and for a variety of useful meta-analysis tools.<<ref "3">>

I recommend you save this entire wiki to your hard drive from your browser: click the checkmark up in the upper-righthand corner to download this document. It is completely self-contained in one html file.<<ref "c">> You can distribute this wiki by hand, sneakernet-style, with profound ease. This hypertext book/wiki is meant to be eminently distributable, platform agnostic, consumable offline, and technically ergonomic in its unified simplicity.

If for whatever reason you ever have a hard time acquiring a newer version, e.g. the site goes down, your saved hardcopy may still have the information necessary to help you find and {[[Verify|Cryptographic Verification]]} other distribution mechanisms.

!! Principles:

* In service to one of my [[axioms|Axioms of h0p3]], [[Find The Others]], I hope to make it so people have a chance to connect with me on whatever level they find most comfortable.
* If these options don't work for you, then {[[Contact|Contact h0p3]]} me. I can send it to you by whatever channels you prefer.

<<footnotes "1" "This wiki serves many purposes. It's primarily directly written by me for me. However, it also serves as a litmus test of the people around me. Those who care about me will care about what I think and feel, i.e. this wiki. Someone completely uninterested in the contents of my wiki, for whatever reason, is not really a friend of mine.">>

<<footnotes "2" "Almost certainly only me, my wife, and perhaps my chilluns.">>

<<footnotes "3" "Hear my plea, O Lord, God of Existence, may this not be a record of my descent into arrogant madness. Amen.">>

<<footnotes "sh" "Unicode URLs are shiiiinnnneeeeyyyy.">>

<<footnotes "r" "Some are more real-timier than others. Dr. Who Knows What It Do!">>

<<footnotes "c" "Okay, almost entirely self-contained. There are a couple files which sit outside, but I'm going to eventually do away with them for the most part. I cannot do that for the signature file though (well, not in a clean way).">>

<<footnotes "4" "This daily snapshot collection is duplicated by the deltas in my git repositories. This is also a fine method for acquiring an official daily snapshot of this wiki. Clone it in a directory with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/m6ram/wiki-nightly`">>

<<footnotes "5" "I'd like to publicly thank the unknowingly generous folks at the WayBackMachine for their donation to my art. Thank you.">>
