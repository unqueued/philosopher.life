title: 2020.04.06 - Prompted Introspection: Taking My Wife Outdoors

!! What is your favorite thing to do outdoors? Why?

[[2018.07.07 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Thing Outdoors]] is correct. My wife does not like having sex outdoors either. Uh, I can use a laptop outside too. Bringing the indoors out with me doesn't help. I'd love a GPD Pocket 2. Yum. Shit ain't happening anytime soon though. Maybe in a decade?

Walking is my low-stress way to explore, think about the people around us, and talk with my wife. She really doesn't like to walk either. I'm lucky she will go outdoors with me.
