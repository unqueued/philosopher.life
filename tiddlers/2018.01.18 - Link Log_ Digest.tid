* Think About It

*** I find that very odd to say...of course there are mathematical formulas to describe it, it's a law of nature. Otherwise, you are positing something quite supernatural. Nature, by definition, is that which can be defined mathematically (at least theoretically, even if we don't actually know the math or have the physical capacity to calculate it, etc.). This isn't the direction they meant, but I still find it odd.

*** Seems pretty obvious that one can be addicted to it (although, I think the range is huge, and I think it is a spectrum...Although, I also think dependency borders on just being an example of hypothetical imperative).

<<footnotes "2019.03.22" "What eventually became a keyword. Interestingly, I would not apply it to this. I can see I'm still developing my notion of what this log is supposed to be. I'm a little bit sick to my stomach in recognizing how much of my wiki is like this. I don't know what else to do. I gotta change things to improve.">>
