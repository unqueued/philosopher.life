title: 2020.03.22 - K: Super Easy

"""
[8:32 PM] h0p3: You having a good weekend?
[8:42 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Taking it super easy. We really needed it lol.
[8:43 PM] Ardent_Assailant: How about you?
[8:43 PM] h0p3: Good. I'm glad you got to chill.
[8:43 PM] h0p3: Most [[Family Time]] today and glue for the week yesterday.
[8:44 PM] h0p3: Everyone is healthy. Have food. 10,000 things to do. Solid.
[8:46 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Lowkey hoping UofL officially closes this week. Student at moving out so there’s no reason to stay open.
[8:47 PM] h0p3: Makes sense.
[8:47 PM] h0p3: Might give you a lot of time to focus too.
[9:36 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I hate the uncertainty of all of this. It’s driving me crazy haha
[9:36 PM] Ardent_Assailant: This being our current pandemic and everything it affects.
[9:37 PM] h0p3: Uncertainty causes me a lot of anxiety (some of which is justified and I should feel it to some extent). My predictions are grim.
[9:37 PM] h0p3: I anticipate 45% real adult unemployment in the US.
[9:39 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Same tbh. That’s super scary.
[9:39 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Just heard about two friends getting laid off this weekend.
[9:39 PM] Ardent_Assailant: No emergency fund. No savings. Just up shit creek
[9:41 PM] h0p3: Most Americans have less $1k in savings, and that's going to be wiped out in the next two months. There are many people who will not be able to pay rent.
[9:41 PM] h0p3: It is super fucking scary.
[9:41 PM] h0p3: I'm terrified (can't stop reading or thinking about it).
[9:43 PM] Ardent_Assailant: You guys will be okay though right?
[9:47 PM] h0p3: Yeah. We are going to be okay.
[9:47 PM] h0p3: I'm grateful for that.
[9:47 PM] h0p3: It's a weird feeling to see that we will likely survive this storm, and recognize how many people are in trouble.
[9:47 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Good. :slight_smile: Us too but only because [[L]] has been shrewd in preparation for a real emergency.
[9:47 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Mood
[9:47 PM] h0p3: In case it matters, you are always welcome to live with us. You are my brother.
[9:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Surprisingly my folks are fine too and they live paycheck to paycheck.
[9:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: You’re super sweet. If we ever have to take you up on that, you’ll be first in line. :slight_smile:
[9:51 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Is this cousin [[AIR]]?
[9:51 PM] h0p3: Yup!
[9:51 PM] Ardent_Assailant: :open_mouth:
[9:51 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yooooooooo!
[9:52 PM] h0p3: Glad to have him back with us.
[9:52 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I hope he’s doing much better these days. :slight_smile: I think about him a lot
[9:53 PM] h0p3: Aye. Hopefully, he'll be able to integrate more with us here.
[9:53 PM] Ardent_Assailant: That sounds wonderful.
