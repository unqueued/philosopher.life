title: 2018.03.06 - Prompted Introspection Log: Doing Very Good

!! How do you feel when you do something that is very good?

Do I know I did very good? 

It seems like whether or not I did very good can be peeled apart from whether I know it (and thus apart from how I feel about it). Let us assume I know. How did I know? Of course, I am forced to accept that knowledge is more about justification than having the truth, so I can know a falsehood in some cases. Thus, even when I "know" I did very good, that doesn't objectively mean I have done very good in all cases. There are epistemic/linguistic closure and incompleteness problems that are incommensurable to our phenomenology. One of the fundamental expressions of [[The Dialectic]] is the epistemologists' internalist/externalist debate in analytic philosophy and the realist/anti-realist debate of the Heideggarian side of continental philosophy. They point to the same thing. This is not the rabbithole you want me to go down with your question, but I want you to see that it gets ugly real fast. 

Another rabbithole is how do I define [[The Good]]. Good for whom, given what standard, etc.? 

Let us egregiously suppose that I am objectively right about [[The Good]] in the right ways and that I know I've done something very good in the right ways, that somehow we can do away with giant ancient post-modern philosophical black holes I've pointed out which suck everything into meaninglessness, how then do I feel about it?

Ordinarily, I would say I feel really good, of course, for doing something very good. Seeing it is good and that I did it, I'm often the beneficiary of pleasure chemical and electrical signals coursing through my nervous system in such cases. My perceptions of the world and myself are lightened often enough. Etc.

Ah, but some of the "very good" things I do are good in virtue of being [[The Right]] thing to do. They aren't universally good for everyone, including myself, but they are good qua my agency, personhood, moral responsibility, etc. I don't often feel happiness or pleasure about these things. Sometimes, I am sacrificing myself. In those moments, my feelings can be downright miserable. Here, of course, is where I despise virtue theorists and moral egoists (and neoliberals [and regular sheets]).

As usual, I cannot answer your question as you thought I could.
