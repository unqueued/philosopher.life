We can never fully compatibilize our reality maps with others, but we have to try as best we can. I think the outliers on the bellcurves will have an exceptionally hard time of it. It's generally rejection across the board. It trains someone to either hate themselves or the world.

I absolutely must thank my daughter for inspiring me to work on my music collection and for her help in engaging in this project. I needed her help badly (and probably still do). It has been of enormous use to me, and being able to just dictate songs that I know push me into the zone is exactly what I needed.

I initially thought it absurd my donors have claimed that my identity is the result of substance use. No, it largely isn't. I have strong evidence on this wiki, including work from before I ever touched my first substance, alcohol. My conflicts are much older than that. It is clear to me that my identity is not largely shaped by substances, although substances have enabled me to shape myself and remain open to solving these conflicts. The fundamental trains of thought are still there though, and might I add, I've grown in my appreciation for the details and complexities which arise from my initial concerns. I will continue to make my moves.
