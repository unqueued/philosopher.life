title: 2018.02.25 - Prompted Introspection Log: Squandering Money

!! Why is it not wise to squander your money?

I find this to be an odd question:

<<<
Why is it not //adjective// to //verb-with-adjective-property-embedded-in-it// foobar?
<<<

This is similar to formally begging the question. Asking why X-activity is X-like is almost useless. Look, if you already assumed some instance of spending one's money was "squandering" then you've already assumed it is unwise by definition. I could just as easily answer: it was unwise because it was unwise. 

I prefer more specific phrases:

* What are the consequences of squandering your money?
* What are some cases in which you squandered money?
* How do you prevent yourself from squandering your money?

Alright, so to your particular question: presumably, wisdom requires efficiently using one's resources to maximize one's hedonic utility and eudaimonic flourishing. You have to do the best you can with what you have. If you spend what you have on all the wrong things, then aren't going to achieve the maximum potential happiness available to you.
