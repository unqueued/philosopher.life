Being against putting babies in cages doesn't mean you aren't evil in other ways. For example: the dude was in the army for 22 years.

And vets and those that serve are bad? WTF

Generally, yes. Would you like to discuss our disagreement?

<<<
Thatâ€™s a hell of a thing to say about folks that have served and allow you to live in a free country that allows you to say those things. You should go tell some vets that to their face if you want to discuss it.

I do. I'm fun at parties too. That doesn't make my argument incorrect. Are you going to discuss it, or are you going to keep throwing rhetoric without substance?

This is not a free country. They didn't secure the freedoms I do have either. I've met vets who agree with my position as well (which is not a supporting argument, but I'm not sure you've explored this possibility well enough). It sounds like you have some skin in the game here too.
