title: 2018.06.14 -- The Matrix: Script

I'm still making steady but slow progress in my script commentary. That thing is a beast, and it isn't lining up with the movie. It reminds me of the last Harry Potter book, where we pirated a copy of a draft of the book months in advance of the final release (hackers after my own heart). The differences between the draft and final made it come alive even more for me (for the record, the draft was far more adult, and I liked it).
