!! list-field

#Searches for every tiddler with a specific field (fieldname)
#Makes a bullet-pointed list of the titles as links
#Displays the contents of the field (fieldname) on the same line, next to its respective tiddler, as links

Originally for use in the Alias tiddler. Input is a filter and the name of the field to display. Usage:

`<<list-field "[tag[asdf]]" "aliased">>`

Example of output:

*[[a]] : [[1]] [[x]]
*[[b]] : [[2]] [[y]]
*[[c]] : [[3]] [[z]]

!! list-related

Lists:

#Everything that is prefixed "x:"
#Everything that is tagged "x", is not prefixed "x:", and is not a log
#Everything that is a log and is titletagged "x"
#Everything that is a log, is tagged "x", is not titletagged "x", and is not a retired x

All as separate bullet-pointed lists, where x is the tiddler this macro is called in. No input. Usage:

`<<list-related>>`

---

!! list-nonlog-related

Lists:

#Everything that is prefixed "x:"
#Everything that is tagged "x", not prefixed "x:", is not a log, and is not an audit

Both as separate bullet-pointed lists, where x is the tiddler this macro is called in. No input. Usage:

`<<list-nonlog-related>>`

!! directory-lists

Lists:

#Everything that is prefixed "x:"
#Everything that is tagged "x", is not prefixed "x:", is not a log, and is not an audit
#This strange thing.. 
##Lists everything that is a log and is titletagged "x"
##Lists everything that is a log, is tagged "x", and is not titletagged "x"
##Combines both of these lists
##Removes retired tiddlers
##Filters them to be prefixed with the current year and month
##Sorts by title

As separate bullet-pointed lists. No input. Usage:

`<<directory-lists>>`
