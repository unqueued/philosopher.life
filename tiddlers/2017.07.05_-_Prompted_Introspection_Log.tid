!! Are you afraid of heights?

Yes.

I do not like the thought of falling at all. I've never liked heights. Fear grips me as I grip the rails. Interestingly, I don't feel bad with a harness on in my experience. I feel far more comfortable in that position, at least as experience goes.

I need to empathize with myself wisely (and turn off my feelings if I can when I must). I'm going to be working at heights very often. I should take steps necessary to do it safely, and I think the use of PPE will make me feel a lot better. I've not felt bad going up on ladders so far, but I've not gone up absurdly high.

I have to remember that I do have a good sense of balance (which is surprising for an autist). I can do it!
