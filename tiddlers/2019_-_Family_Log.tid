!! Audit:

* The [[Family Log]] for 2019 was almost entirely written by the youths in the house. 
** It's been a useful practice. Eye-opening for my offspring.
* My push for my daughter to socialize has born some fruit. 
** I think it's clearer and clearer to her how little practical training she has on this front in some respects.
*** Thankfully, she's equipped to have discussions with adults. Some of the hardest spots are her strengths.
** I'm hoping she'll find groups of interest that she will participate in, travel to, have friends over, build offline relationships too (and figure out how to integrate her online and offline identities wisely).
* Questions/Prompts:
** //How has your health been this week?//
*** Generally short and uninteresting answers. I'm fine with that. I still need them to become aware and be their own advocates here.
*** Checklist, process discipline, diagnostic, hit all the major bases at least briefly. 
*** Provides context for the week. 
** //What happened last week? How and why did it happen? Name at least one happy and one unhappy thing.//
*** We often don't answer this question precisely anymore. The spirit of it still seems fine.
**** We really should try to flesh this one out more though. Like so many of my logs, they start out as too slim, and I don't know where to grow them appropriately. 
*** This is an important storytelling and micro-recording session. It often spawns more serious discussions. Talking points, yeah, but also recognizing how our lives are pieced together.
** //Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with?//
*** They have a hermit dad. Homeschooled. Ends of bellcurves. //**Autism intensifies**//. [[FTO]]. Trusting trust. [[Intimacy]]. 
*** I want them to see the larger webs of our relationships and to have a chance to reason about them with us. 
*** We have this problem: we are profoundly cloistered, bubbled, isolated, and we have to be to grow in many cases. 
** //What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?//
*** Here's how I regularly see how shitty a father I am. A [[good]] father wouldn't even need this. I don't spend enough time complimenting correctly, and I've not effectively enabled my children to see through this lens well enough either. 
**** I regret not having pursued this line much, much earlier. 
*** This place is almost sacred to me, even the small things. I'm never going to live up to it. 
** //What will you do this week? Name at least one fun objective and one unfun objective.//
*** Oh, lawdy, my chirrun will one day recognize so fully how retarded I am. Give 'em the best forensic papertrail I can. 
*** These are tiny {[[Dreams]]} we are attempting to pragmatize out loud with each other. 
*** It is a public alert. 
* I don't know how to improve this log. That is sad. 
* Enforcing [[title.Title]]s in this log has made it easier to carry over for my offspring's wikis. 
** It's become an important meme generator in some respects for us.  I can't put my finger on it well enough, though I have tried.
* I read my [[others]]' wikis daily. My offspring, however, I give a lot of space. It's not like I'm not tempted to track everything, but my gut sends me to giving them time, maybe a kind of room for error, and I like that they have this cleanup step on the weekend, an opportunity to reflect and try and fix what's missing.
* Our shabbat is kind of split in half. The ritual continues to evolve.
** This year, the family has begun to enjoy it even more. It's important to my offspring in a way that I don't think was before. 
* Uh, it's interesting to see that I was glad to have the log take a backseat, and then come back around to use the log to be more useful for what's in the front seat.
* They say homeschoolers are terrible at socializing, but there is a space in which I think my offspring are very well-socialized. Few are practiced in this thing.
* I think my offspring do better when I'm not working outside the home.
* Family discussion is the core. Everything else is building around it.
** I like that we prep for it over the course of the week.
* This feels like a [[CTS]]. Hrm.
* My offspring have developed strong senses of humor.
* Hey, bliss makes for a good month.
* The end of the year was incredibly stressful. 
** So many unknowns. It was a leap. It could have gone much, much worse.
** Everyone started feeling huge pressure.
* I don't think we forgot to do a log. Technical glitch.
* I feel like we are nomads so strongly in this log.
