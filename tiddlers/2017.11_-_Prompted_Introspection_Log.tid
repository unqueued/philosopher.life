Audit:

* I'm not just randomly picking from a list. I don't form my own anymore. This is good and bad. In a way, [[/b/]] is the outlet for the ones I form on my own. I like that. It's a lot less forced.
* I find myself gazing at these introspections throughout the month, even before it is time for the audit. I like that I think about what I've said.
* Have I said I love having titles? =) 
* Some of these are very short and sad.
* Clear, justified philosophical paranoia in these answers.
* You know it's serious when I start using footnotes.
* My donors were on my mind at the beginning of the month. Life is better when I don't have to think about them.
* I've added an interlocutor, Lady Melisandre. Good call.
* Edits.
* I am reminded how much I don't like people when I read this, and I don't think there is something wrong with me in feeling that way.
* Many of these moved me.
* Vortex language is interesting, it shows up in {[[About]]}
* Oh shit, I found it!!! 2017.11.18. Look at it. I'm signaling to myself with a Profound Emphasis mechanic. I was trying to point out the rabbithole. This is why I made the rabbithole mechanic. Awesome! 
* Definitely some count your blessings in here.
* Redpilled, as usual.
* Sometimes I don't even talk about the Sunday School answer version at all. I'm fine with that.
* I've stopped worrying about the fact that I can't answer many of these questions in space/time I have. The fact is that I'm answering them over the course of the wiki itself. I'm glad I can recognize it, give whatever answer I feel I should, and move on.
* Do I sound skeptical? Lol
