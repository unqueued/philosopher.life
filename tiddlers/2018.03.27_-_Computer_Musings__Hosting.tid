Woke middle of night. Got m15 fixed up almost entirely the way I like it. Took several hours. FF with my extensions is very heavy for 2GB RAM. I've enabled zram, which appears to help a bit. I got a bit of work done on m14 as well. Updates for HPTC and m10. 

About 2am, I found the domains weren't renewed (which I anticipated but knew they'd fall into grace period). Renewed mine. They wiped my IP data (so, I had to find the IPs again, lol). I put it the records, but then minutes later, they brought all my records back and undid my work? Lol.

Bed.

Wife was worried about it, so I fixed the subdomains up and edited [[lighttpd.conf for this Wiki's Host]].
