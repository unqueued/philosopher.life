title: Old Gameplan for Homeschooling 1uxb0x

//Deprecated, see: [[2017.04.14 - 1uxb0x: Gameplan for Homeschooling]]//

He currently works on the following academic subjects:

* Morning Routine
** Get dressed
** Eat breakfast
** Brush teeth
** Cosmetics/Hair/Dress and other socially expectations...
** Laundry

* Math
** Life of Fred
*** 3 of 10 elementary school books
** Khan Academy
*** 3 grade completed (his age group)
** Singapore Math 
*** Only up to 1st grade completed

* Problem Solving
** Working through a [[Linux and CLI ebook|https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxcommand/files/latest/download?source=typ_redirect]].
** Configuring and organizing his digital life
** Coursera's Learning How to Learn

* Spanish
** I don't care about fluency attempts for him (that would be gravy). Understanding the structure of languages and becoming someone adept at learning language(s) in general is the goal. 

* Language Arts
** Khan's Grammar (we're taking a break from his excellent JacKris books).

* Reading
** Outside of standard academic work, we're aiming for children's literature which exercises his empathy and imagination muscles.

* Typing
** He's at 22ish WPM at the moment. It's clean, but it isn't really touch typing yet. He's slowly improving each week though. We'll get there. This is a tremendous skill for him to master. Take away the barriers and we can tackle others.

* Writing
** He's been writing songs. I need to him to say anything in words. I need to him express himself. I need him to form sentences, paragraphs, and pages. I need him to learn to convert his thoughts into something other people can understand. It's a true art for an autistic person since we do not have the natural programming and capacities of others in this way. I am ridiculously proud of him. I think he'd write me under the table at that age. It isn't grammatically all there yet, but it is improving leaps and bounds. 

* Humanities
** Khan's History (we're feeling this one out)

* Curation
** Finding two good sources of information or websites worth using, and bookmark them (organized bookmarks)
** Learn to search the web. Learn how to ask the right questions. Learn to find what he wants and needs.

* Videos
** School of Life
** Game of Thrones (art worth watching)

* P.E.
** I'm thankful that he enjoys exercising so much. He stretches and plays a lot. He doesn't quite know how to push himself physically or move quickly, but I hope to help him acquire that physical-IQ.

* Journal
** He keeps track of everything she does, reflects, and writes about it. 

Academic Bootcamps Available:

* Python
* Model
* Budgeting

Lecture

* When necessary, we must talk and think about particular subjects or ideas. 
* Our focus is on computer science, ethics, political philosophy, existentialism, and practical life skills and perspectives
