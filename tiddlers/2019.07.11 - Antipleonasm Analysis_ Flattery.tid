title: 2019.07.11 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Flattery

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
To pray to God is to flatter oneself that with words one can alter nature.
<<<

You mean to say: "supernaturally alter the physical world," right? Otherwise, it's really obvious that anything in your lightcone is possibly affected (or perhaps guaranteed affected, but I don't even need to stick my neck out here). 

I think this is not a charitable understanding of prayer (and I say that as someone who detests most people who practice it). It is possible to pray without [[hoping]] for any other change beyond a personal psychological alteration resulting from having said the words. I've met plenty of people who pray as an introspective, stoic, or even emotive expression unmotivated (or largely unmotivated) by the desire to treat their God(s) as a cosmic vending machine.<<ref "c">> 

I am reminded of //prudential// rather than alethic justifications for praying as well. Even as a placebo effect, it may be useful in some contexts, and I'm not convinced it implies this flattery. 

All this said, I'm radically opposed to someone handing me their faith in providence, prayer, or the hand of God (or capitalism) as evidence for justifying a political belief. That is pure fucking evil right there. I hand every person's ass to them who dares to do so in dialectics with me. Religion which is used as a confabulatory mask for egoism is immoral. Even when I was a Christian, I knew it was wrong.
