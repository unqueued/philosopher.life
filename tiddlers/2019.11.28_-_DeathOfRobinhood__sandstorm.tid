h0p3,

you can reach me at [[REDACTED]]
Evenings are best, not-Tuesdays-or-Wednesdays are best.

It is, as you may have figured, a Canadian number

`/# not public plz.`

I see your wiki is down. Hope you are well.

Hey [[DeathOfRobinhood]],

I'm not sure what's up with the wiki. Looking into it. I am doing well (happy holiday today ;P), and I hope you are doing well too. 

Currently, I live at [[REDACTED]]. Phone #: [[REDACTED]]. I strongly prefer Signal to SMS for a number of reasons, including: I check my phone sparingly.

Will call you soon! 

[[REDACTED]]

A happy holiday to and your fam!

Will look into SIgnal this evening.
