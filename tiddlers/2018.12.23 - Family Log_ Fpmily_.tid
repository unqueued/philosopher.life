!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** Getting better at M:TG
** Enjoyed watching you play well against Dad
** You have a really sweet heart - like when gave Ruscht your extra chocolate. You //want// to share with others, and I love that
** We had a very rough day this week, and you recovered and jumped back into the day; I appreciate your resilience. Your goal, I think, is to continue to be as resilient as you can. I think your thermos idea was really cool.
* j3d1h
** I beat Dad in M:TG once
** You were very kind to your brother twice this week, in working on the kitchen without him so he could go do things he needed to do; it's kind of you to think about the other, and went out of your way for it, and it was really good; you, again, kicked some serious ass in CS with me - we did a lot of weird stuff no one else is doing, and I think you did an excellent job, as usual, in CS. We built stuff; I enjoyed building stuff with you. You've been helping with Sphygmus's button work and trying to wrangle Firmcoding, too. Thank you. You have set up several Bob scripts to make the process better, and you did the Spongebob script - basically, the back-end administrative work. I appreciate that you help me build this thing. I had that terrible Bob crash this week; you crafted the script that would pull the specific info from the tiddlers folder - thank you. Thank you for helping me to kill and restart Bob - it's a new tool for me, and I am grateful for your help in learning and using it. 
** I think you can be a very passionate person - like about Undertale and Delta Rune and music. 
** I can't remember the last time I had to intervene with you about your hair or clothes! 
* k0sh3k
** I've done a good job keeping with Advent this year
** You're a good teacher in Sunday school
** Good job getting the lentil swoop recipe
** I appreciate that you have shopped with and for everyone for Christmas. I think that it's good for them to see your process and understand why you do this as a gifts-oriented love language person. 
* h0p3
** I will continue to say that my....so I'm glad that I taught the kids how to teach themselves music if they really care about it, but I'm more glad that I taught them M:TG it's been a beautiful gateway into a number of serious issues; it's been a wonderful teaching tool, and I'm glad I got to take it seriously with them
** Thank you for make anti- and anti-anti-goblins - it's interesting to see how they interact with each other
** Thank you for telling me about MUD and implying offering making me a deck after I learned to use Goblins
** I like your M:TG logs - I can tell you really enjoy playing with the kiddos; I also like your Antipleonasmic Analysis
