This wiki changes. For posterity's sake, I keep a daily snapshot collection. You can join the Resilio swarm for it with read-only key at: [[BY7DL6VWCYLOEGXQUWEHH7LNT5EK6UCLL|https://link.getsync.com/#f=h0p3.xyz&sz=44E6&s=DBJ2FIZ5WDCRJ24HINZNVFFUDKGH3AU7&i=CNMB6FJQ34QBT5STXDV5WKVWISGVGY3NO&p=CCJG3IT7Z63BKGMTMHF5IH5QARYUCPH4]]<<ref "3">>

As a sidenote, I'm sure it would annoy many computational minimalists that I willingly store virtually the entire site in a single self-editing html file. I'll grant that text files alone have something going for them, but this is a very special tool. This wiki is incredibly portable, functional, and malleable. I consider Tiddlywiki to be a skeuomorphic feat of software engineering. How many virtually complete websites with this degree of functionality and content can you download in a few megabytes?<<ref "4">> Exactly. I think there is profound minimalist beauty to it. Yeah, load times aren't great.<<ref "5">> You can always just sync it instead.
