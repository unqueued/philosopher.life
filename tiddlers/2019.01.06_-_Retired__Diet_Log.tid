Let's be honest: I'm fat.<<ref "1">> I'm going to be a man working hard with his hands, and carrying that weight around makes it harder. Make it easier on yourself by losing the weight and having the nutrition meant for physical labor. Also, people treat you better when you look handsome, fit, and like you have a giant penis. Go ahead and appear like the proverbial "Chad" on the outside. It will be socially useful to you. Lastly, people who eat the right foods really do feel better and more likely to feel mentally healthier. Don't pass up on free pleasure chemicals, bro. Free drugs are free drugs, yo.<<ref "2">>

Because I get to be vain in this section (one of the perks, right?), I'm going for pretty graphics (fancy!). Use the [[Diet Log Template]].<<ref "3">>

<<footnotes "1" "Doctors give me different answers. Some think I'm fine, and others are more realistic (honest) about it. I'm not absurdly obese for an American, but I am obese (I understand BMI particularism applies). I have a stout, barrel-chested, muscular build. I'm still fat though. Cut through it. You remember what you looked like as a teenager. You can be healthier, and you should.">>

<<footnotes "2" "The irony of the fact that food itself is a drug is not lost on me. Drug-happiness seeking behavior, however, can be pursued with more wisdom than mere gluttony.">>

<<footnotes "3" "In time, you may automate some of these processes in Tiddlywiki's code. Remember to ask yourself if it is worth the time investment. Do some napkin math at least.">>
