I am disappointed in the tiddlywiki npm. It's absurdly expensive computationally. On top of that, I'm guessing it is modifying the .tid files which makes Dropbox, that whore, rehash every minute as well. So, I've changed updates to every 15 minutes in crontab. I like the real-time, but I'd rather not completely lock a core (or two) at 100% usage permanently.

I've also got Resilio + my SSHFS script pushing to ATL. We will see if this causes problems. I also handled Resilio archiving too aggressively on the server.
