title: 2019.05.16 - Afterschool Teaching: Pleasant

Whitney is giddy today. She got to play in the inflatables. I'm glad. I would too, but I'm not coming early, lol.

I fed my children, and they seemed to like these apples more. I'm not in charge of purchasing, but Delp knows. 

They had yearbooks, and I was required to sign them. I am not creative here. I'm glad they want me to sign their yearbooks. I wish I could teach them why I find it absurd. 7Jm marked through a bunch of teachers and people he hated. That was at least a creative use of it, but it might get him in trouble (I know the feeling, homie).

Mitchell had an interview at the high school. We talked about it. I suppose the nearly 60-yo man knows what he is doing here. He had a good attitude about it.

We've lost the keys somehow. After they ~~pestered~~ kindly asked me, I helped some girls get to the gym's drink machine with another pair. I made a joke and they laughed in terror. Still got it e'rry onced in a wall.

I took my children to the lab. They all came today. I was shocked to see some of the boys who normally hate my guts were interested in my opinion about how to export game states. I got to teach them how to use a thumbdrive (they've never used one before), a file explorer, e-mail, their browsers, and the game's settings. We talked about how the gamestate is represented in the gibberish. I bored them. I made it up to them by teaching them some basic hotkeys though.

Lots of messes and spills today. I'm glad to be of service to you.

I've had several students stop by my desk to say goodbye before they left today. That is uncommon. 

The kids have learned to hide their youtube vidyas from Matt and Whitney. Facial recognition, cameras, some automated triggers, and they'll be able to safely play until the admin catches them, amiright? Until then kiddos, keep alt-tabbing like a paranoid boss. Fuck the police.

The girls leftover after the others went to play in the gym talked me to me about their puppy love and "lunch dates". I explained that I'm incompetent, and I wished them all the luck in the world. We discussed the value of these relationships over the course of their lives. I am, ofc, a very fun person to speak with.

One of my girls talked about being bi, and she was chastised for saying it outloud. I interjected and we talked about censorship.
