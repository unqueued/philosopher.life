!! You've been late posting to your wiki 3 times in a week. What do you think of that?

I regret it. This wiki matters to me. I cannot afford to fail myself here. It's unacceptable. I need to push myself, no matter how tired I am. This is executive functioning. 

Of course, I need to be kind to myself as well. It is forgivable and understandable, even if it is wrong. 

Perhaps I need to develop a better plan. Maybe I shouldn't eat supper until it's done. Some kind of benchmark to hold me to it would be useful.
