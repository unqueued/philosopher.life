title: 2019.06.08 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Movie

!! What is your favorite movie of all time?

[[The Matrix]], and it's not even close. Like [[Dune]] as a book, this film is the gift that keeps on giving. I have no idea how many times I've watched it. I can't say I've studied every aspect of it, but I have studied it a good deal. I think it should be required watching in school. 

It's hard to describe how much the movie resonated with me. My brother [[JRE]] bought me my first CD, a single track of //Guerrilla Radio// from Rage Against The Machine (my donors took it away because it was evil), and that's very much what that film is about in content and aesthetic. By the time I saw it, I already lived with half the music from that movie. I was fascinated by computer hacking, and the movie turned up the volume on it. Most importantly, my cultic-religious upbringing made that movie an //event// in my life. Like LSD, it opened me up, woke me up, and validated my interests. It's one of the reasons I went into philosophy as a discipline. I think it's pretty obvious that even the wiki is an homage to the film.
