* Woke at 9
** Dreams were insane. My brain hurt. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write
* My offspring were doing their wikis and [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] pomos without me, before I asked.
** Good, especially because I completely failed to do school with my offspring. 
*** FUCK. And, I need to apologize again to them during sabbath. Unacceptable.
* Chats
* My wife's head was killing her. The weather. =/.  
** Tended to her, continued to try to get her to just chill and nap.
* [[Magic]]
** I randomly selected decks, they bid, I picked. 
** Daughter's Tittyburn+1 against my Affinity. She played well, and with double pop would have won the turn before I alphastriked.
*** I don't think she made a single error (including removal). Well-played.
** Son's UR-Delver against my MWC+1. Absolutely trounced. Maze, Pulse, Story Circle, with many blind sheets. 
*** We never talked about what it means for him to defeat pulse with that deck. I played around pop and permission too clearly. 
* Read+Write
* Talked with [[chameleon]]
** Super chill, and I was glad we got to wander around.
** I also got to connect with The Abyssal.
*** Sidenote: I like his accent too. It's crystalline and kind to my ears.
* Chats
* By 9:30ish I laid my head in wife's lap as she watched //Westworld//...fell asleep.
