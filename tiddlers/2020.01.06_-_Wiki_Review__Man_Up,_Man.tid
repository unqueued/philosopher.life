** It's such a weird feeling to see that perhaps my offspring can't or won't attend post-secondary schools, but they might also be able to get a pretty sweet education too. Seems wide open here.
*** I have no idea how much autonomy I'm supposed to give them. I hope to kindle, protect, and cultivate their intrinsic motivation. They simply can't know how important it is without the experience.

** Yeah, those were fine plans. Ton of bricks hit me though. It's fine.
** The offspring actually did do some writing.
*** We are so weirdly isolated at the moment. Everyone in their own room. This has never happened before.
**** I'm concerned they aren't getting enough social interaction. We usually talk all day. But...they seem to be enjoying it.

** I am so ready to have [[m16]] back. This is ridiculous. I fucking hate anything which is not my Das Keyboard.

** Fascinating to see my son ask about this. I suppose I didn't have this done in time or he didn't see it. I'll point him to it.
