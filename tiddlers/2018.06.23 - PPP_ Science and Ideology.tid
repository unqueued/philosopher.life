title: 2018.06.23 - PPP: Science and Ideology

* http://www.iep.utm.edu/sci-ideo/

It's crucial that we do not commit the naturalistic fallacy, dissolving key conceptual barriers between "is" and "ought." Of course, descriptions must inform prescriptions. In fact, I think empiricism is generally only valuable insofar as it promotes [[The Good]] and/or [[The Right]]. Trying to be good humans and persons is exactly why we should be engaging in and using science for in the first place.

I'll be interested to see if Scientism is taken seriously in this article.

What areas are pursued in science, what paradigms are held onto longer than they should be, and which receive the spotlight, of course are political issues. I suggest, however, that non-trivial aspects of science are at least theoretically immune insofar as it is ideally practiced.

Seriously, this is why STEM majors desperately need to study the humanities. The value of science is qua the humanities. Of course, it's going to be ideological. It better be, but [[irwartfrr]]. 

Faith in inescapable, folks. You have axioms you will never and can never justify. The foundation problem cannot be solved any other way. Talk shit about ideology all you want; you'd be a hypocrite to do so. Being anti-ideological is ideological. Talk about connotations all you want; the problem of line-drawing just doesn't go away.

Lysenko and Big Tabacco are interesting cases.

The problem of racism and evolution is an ugly one. I find many intelligent Biologists quick to dispel telic notions, unfortunately, this is not coherent either. The bias is unstoppable.

Yay, Scientism is on the docket for today's reading!

My usual problem with scientism is a lack of epistemic humility. Philosophy will always be the king. Know your place, servant! =) lol.

This was a clean article. It didn't have the technical work I've come to greatly admire in SEP, but it was worth my time!
