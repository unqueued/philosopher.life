!! Respond to the following quote:<<ref "a">>

[[Quotes: Twin Insurgency]]:

{{Quotes: Twin Insurgency}}

It appears one of the twins is radically stronger than the other. Some people really can't feel the difference between trillions and billions; it's all just a bunch of zeroes to them (and I cannot say I'm profoundly skilled myself).

I think the crimes of the elite are far higher. It is odd to see how the elite are not held directly responsible for the corruption of political actors either until the end. I would argue that the elite are in fact responsible for the other insurgency. Excepting that vitally ignored implication, the rest of this is fucking gold. 

Preach, yo.

<<footnotes "a" "Atomizing content is hard. That quote is long as fuck. I'd like to become the person who doesn't have to constantly copy every single little thing. Should I? Extracting particular objects out for transclusion is generally the wrong method. Should I atomize and transclude this into both (one of them retroactively)? Yeah, probably.">>
