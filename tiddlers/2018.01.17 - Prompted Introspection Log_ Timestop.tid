!! What would you do if you could stop time?

Define what it means to timestop. I can't begin to answer the question without knowing that. Let me say, there is a significant body of erotica devoted to this topic. That is definitely one place that my mind goes, rapey as it may be. I have seen several narratives devoted to this mechanic in children's literature, fantasy, bad science fiction, and especially cartoons. It also has serious ties to other time-glitches, like the movie Groundhog Day. Even video games are attempting to implement these kinds of mechanics.

I think this is another wish. It has a lot of hacks built into it. I don't see why this super power question is useful to me though. What does it enable me to see that I don't already? Does it reveal my true identity? Ah, you already know that. I get how the ideal of power enables us to understand ourselves, but I think there are limits to how useful that information is to us in the practical world. Fun question, but not important to me. To the extent it is the [[ROG]], I admire it. Why not just talk about the ring of gyges then?
