Sorry for being quiet. I was really busy. >_<

My weekend was great, until yesterday at 11:30. I'm still in the hospital. Bacterial infection caused me to balloon up.

That’s good... my birth father came into town to visit Thursday. [[L]] was sick Friday. Saturday we went to Churchill downs and gattis for our niece. Sunday was Mother’s Day so we hung out with [[AA]] and them. My parents too. I helped them remodel their upstairs.

Today I’m gonna work, and prep for both a one shot tomorrow and a session for Saturday.

Ever the busy bee. :sunglasses:
