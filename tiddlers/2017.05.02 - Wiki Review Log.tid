title: 2017.05.02 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.05.01 - Link Log]]
** Edited.
* [[2017.04 - Family Log]]
** Completed monthly audit. It's my first time. It was brief. I did re-read everything and try to find patterns.
* [[2017.04 - DCK Meditation]]
**  Completed monthly audit. I have mixed feelings about it. Some of this writing is pointless, if not embarrassing to myself. But, I can see that some of it is quite reasonable at the end of the day. 
* [[2017.04 - Pipefitting Log]]
** Completed monthly audit. There are clearly many social components of my job to think about. I'm glad I'm thinking about them. I need to intellectualize that which is not gutterally natural to me.
* [[2017.04 - Link Log]]
**  Completed monthly audit. Links didn't surprise me. I do want to curate more about pipefitting though. I need to take finding information about my job more seriously than I have. It can't just be an at-work kind of thing. It is should be integrated into my daily online life. I hope I can, at least.
* [[2017.04 - h0p3's Log]]
**  Completed monthly audit. I'm grateful to myself. That sounds weird, but I am!
* [[2017.04 - Diet Log]]
** Completed monthly audit. I'm not committing myself to anything yet. I'm just recording. The patterns are there. 
* [[2017.04 - Wiki Review Log]]
** Minor edit. I like how it gives me a change log to see when I delete wiki pages. It gives a reason for it. Breadcrumbs, exceptions, and explanations are useful. 
* [[2017.05.01 - Wiki Review Log]]
** It's weird, but I don't mind reviewing my reviews. There is something quite meta about it. It allows me to track trends. I've been struggling to figure out how to do {Focus}. It could be weekly or monthly. I could have two section. A weekly section and a monthly one. There should be a final destination for my logs. {Focus} should be it. The reason "weekly" looks good to me is because "Recent" fills up quickly, and I want to make sure that I'm taking into account not only "New" but also those pages which were edited. It is part of knowing where I've really spent my time.
* [[Family Activities]]
** Added more to family activities
* [[2017.05.01 - Pipefitting Log]]
** Made some edits and an addition that I forgot to mention.
* [[2017.05.01 - Diet Log]]
** I love peanut butter. I can afford it. I shouldn't overdo it though.
