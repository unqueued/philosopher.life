title: 2018.08.19 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Sound

!! Describe your favorite sound.

Melisandre, you give me yet another gift. My favorite sound would be the one that makes all creatures perfectly happy for all time insofar as that is logically coherent (surely there's a sound that accompanies such a tremendous thing). 

Favorite in what context, [[gfwiwcgws]]? 

I adore my wife's giggle/laugh during orgasm. I need to hear music hit me just perfectly, overtaking me in the moment, driving me. I love the sound of rain, rushing water, and waves. I love the rapidfire clickety-clack of my DasKeyboard (trusted friend!). I love hearing my children say "good morning" and "I love you." There are several ASMR sounds and aural-stimming patterns which hit the sweetspot. Also, see: [[Music]].
