title: 2018.11.30 - Prompted Introspection: Mind-Reading

!! If you had a mind-reading ability but could only choose 3 people to read their minds, who would they be?

I have answered this before: [[2017.11.07 - Prompted Introspection Log: Mind-Reading 3 People]]. I like this question quite a bit Lady Melisandre. It borders on asking me what I want my own mind to be prescriptively, and it definitely gives me a rich description that an autist could only dream of.

I am convinced that the [[Know Thyself]] axiom clearly requires that I choose myself if I have any reason to think this mind-reading ability would result in significant information not already available to me. Something, something, qualia, self-modeling modeler, right? Depending on how this is defined, I'd either be the first person or the last.

It's a good question of whether or not I have to be able to target the person by name as well. I might, for example, as to mind-read the most knowledgeable, intelligent, and golden-rule following agent in the universe. If there were a god, I'd be able to read such a mind. If there were aliens more advanced than us, I'd be able to read one of their minds. It could just be some person on the planet no one knows about either.

I would choose my wife again. This is a no-brainer. I want to //know// her inside and out. ;P
