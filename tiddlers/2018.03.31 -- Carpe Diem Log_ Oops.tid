title: 2018.03.31 -- Carpe Diem Log: Oops

//From my poor memory.//

* Woke at 9ish?
* Inform the Men, or the day before?
* We fasted. I was hungry.
* Kids don't appear to eat much until dinner. Had to force them to get fruits and vegetables. They are more inclined to eat during schooldays, understandably.
* Cleaned
* Read+Write
* D2
* Walked briefly with wife
* Called JRE, AIR, ALM, and C.
** C called me back. It was a decent talk. It's unfortunate that I can't really express myself to him. I play smalltalk.game with him and do my best to find common ground.
* Hungry, but not actually significantly hangry. This was good practice. We should continue it.
* Chatted briefly with JRE
* Wife had a service 9. I waited as long as I could, but inevitably ate without her at around 9:30?
* I went to bed at 9:45
