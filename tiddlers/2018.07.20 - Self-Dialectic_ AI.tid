title: 2018.07.20 - Self-Dialectic: AI

One interesting part of this corpus is that the entire syntactic and semantic structures arise in an html file. It's got some ideal qualities to it for machine learning, imho. 

We may have a hard time trusting AI, but I have to say, I would trust an AI built from my wiki exclusively. A digital version of myself is something I would desperately hope to cooperate with.

I think this self-dialectic may eventually evolve into me talking to an AI version of myself.
