title: 2019.06.09 - JRE: Talking

We talked and talked today. My brother got moved back after 4 days on the shutdown. Cool. One of his apprentices is openly saying he doesn't like my brother. There may not be much he can do about it. I am reminded of [[The 48 Laws of Power]]. 

He talked about wanting to work OT every once in a while just to keep 8 hour days in perspective. It was a [[stoic|Stoicism-fu]] argument, and I gave him a tiny rundown. 

My brother is being coached by Rebecca not to express some topics during adoption seminars. I know that feeling. My brother pays many prices in his openness and honesty. Most people find it politically expedient not to say the truth. He has the right either way in these cases, and I don't think he's done anything wrong by saying the truth. I don't think he deserves to pay the prices either. I say this as someone who has not and cannot effectively be himself with others either.

Some of his co-workers will openly bully apprentices by claiming they'll be taking them to another room to rape them. He works alongside garbage (most people are).

We talked about my new toy. We talked about incels, loli, and legislation. 

We talked a bit about the wiki, and we ended the conversation with me explaining my confusion with Hegel and transworld identities.
