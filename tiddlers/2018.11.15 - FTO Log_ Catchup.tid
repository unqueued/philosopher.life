I tried pioneer.app again for fun. I was in the top 100 worldwide again for a week, but slipped out again. I believe this is due to the fact that it's a capitalist project, a VC angel sharktank. My project is antithetical.

Twitter unsuspended my throwaway account minutes after requesting it. I have no idea why they did, but I suspect their hair triggers and desire to know my real identity is behind it. Tweeted to https://twitter.com/artautism, since this work definitely counts, and I would like to reach out to more autistic people. I think they might appreciate what I'm doing here, and I think we could engage each other effectively.
