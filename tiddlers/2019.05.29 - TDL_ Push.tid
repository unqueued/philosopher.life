* Old SFF HTPC can be partially repaired. 
* Push your own laundry
* The door is still not sturdy enough. Keep cramming it.
* Slowly grinding through your letters. There is far more to add to [[kicks]]' letter.
* Your children don't seem nearly as excited to do the AHK thing as you. 
* Hold down the fort while your wife is gone.
* I like that you are pushing through video. You don't get enough new content in your diet.
