title: 2018.09.10 -- Deep Reading: LOTR:FOTR

My wife likes to tease me about Bombadil. She knows the story point drives me insane. =) I love her. I feel like there author is being violent here! His whim destroys the realism of the fantasy. It's his story though. I do understand the escapist drive. It's not like I haven't enjoyed the Bombadil sequence before, but over time, it just keeps getting worse and worse. It doesn't re-read well.

Why does Frodo just hand it over without the affective restrain? I need to stop. Lol. No, don't go down this route of questioning. Just enjoy the show, homie.

Too late! Bombadil reminds me of the non-cognitivism of virtue theory that allows The Slip into confabulation...as if moral life is just easy, bro. Rofl. Tolkien really was a piece of shit on this point, especially for how much he trash talked Lewis.
