How’s it going today?
MON 4:15 PM
Hey, it's going well.
MON 5:55 PM
I thought it would be a much lonelier day than it has been
MON 5:56 PM
Ended up having a 4 hour conversation with my neighbors. That was an unexpected and pleasant surprise.
MON 5:56 PM
How about you? How has MLK day been?
MON 5:57 PM
That’s awesome!
MON 6:12 PM
Not bad. Catching up in XIV and doing homework too
MON 6:12 PM
Noice.
MON 6:14 PM
Can you mix them at all?
MON 6:14 PM
Like...there are some kinds of raiding which had enough waiting periods that you could do things in between, especially at the desk.
MON 6:14 PM
Mmhmm but we’re playing around with a new Job today. :)
MON 6:15 PM
What do you mean?
MON 6:15 PM
Like, occupation or job in the game?
MON 6:16 PM
They released Blue Mage last Tuesday. Haha
MON 6:16 PM
You doing this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IKyuuvoyOA ?
MON 6:17 PM
(blue mage exploit)
MON 6:18 PM
I tested it but I felt dirty so I stopped after a few levels lol
MON 6:33 PM
lol
MON 6:34 PM
That is a curious claim.
MON 6:34 PM
I guess I don't understand why you'd feel dirty. I can appreciate wanting to enjoy the narrative/show of leveling by hand or in some other fasion (where efficiency isn't the primary point).
MON 6:35 PM
I also enjoy farming exp
MON 6:36 PM
And being able to skip that part makes it unfun for me.
MON 6:36 PM
I hear ya.
MON 6:36 PM
This is the first new job they’re included that starts at 1 in like 5 years. In our first expansion the new jobs started at 30 and in our most recent expansion they started at 50
MON 6:40 PM
A rarity then.
MON 6:41 PM
Basically.
MON 6:43 PM
I like earning my levels.
MON 6:43 PM
The ol' fashioned way (I'd say you earn them with the exploit too). I have a Diablo II instance that is completely self-found; zero infection from trading, hacks, etc.
MON 6:44 PM
It's enjoyable.
MON 6:44 PM
Have a good day today!
TUE 9:50 AM
Also yeah I understand how important efficiency is to you. :)
