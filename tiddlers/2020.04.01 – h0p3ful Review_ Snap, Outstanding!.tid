** Congratulations, sir. I would like to know more context. Saying anything is better than nothing.
*** You might consider having a single tiddler with datestamps in it to capture short messages like this.
**** I cannot solve this wisely.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 3, Draft 4]]
** Please keep your formatting identical.
** You sound like a different person. It's shocking to your dad; I didn't anticipate those words coming from you (even though I know you have those thoughts often left unarticulated inside). I am rarely a good predictor of you, sir. Please don't stop your excellent progress. It's like you're flying to my eyes.
*** You and your mom are kicking so much ass here. Like a madman, take every ounce of wisdom she can give you. She sees where I am blind, and you would be a fool not to practice [[k0sh3k]]-fu. Though many will speak of her intelligence, there are very few people in the world who know how smart she really is. Even +16 years later, I'm still learning from and with my wife everyday (and you know how fucking arrogant I am).
*[[The Lightning Thief: 2, Draft 4]]
** Snap, that is outstanding.
*** Look! Could you do this last year? 
**** Okay, sure, you could with tons of effort. You are actually choosing to this on your own now though (and that's a big fucking deal). You've been cultivating yourself to make this habit easier. That's all you, homie. You did that.
** Also, I can tell you've been working on your grammar (even if through drafting, as you point out...YOU changed it, and YOU sought help on editing it...I cannot think of a more intelligent thing to do in your shoes).

** I have such a hard time falling asleep too. Let's start evolving your [[Bedtime Routine.tmpl]]. Let's engage in a ghetto science (a gut empiricism) of finding the answer to this problem, including adjusting our behaviors and frames of mind. Your mother takes medication for this, and I have my lullaby shows.
*[[2020.03.31 -- Carpe Diem:*Facepalm*]]
** I'm sorry. I know it's hard. I think you should do what I've been doing. At the end of the night, you should finish your [[CTS]]. Do it //before// you sleep. 
*** Sometimes, I won't be able to hold it, and I need to just rupture what I have straight into wiki as soon as I can. You may find yourself emptying your thoughts throughout the day in [[CTS]] as well, imho. I don't know how to do this wisely enough. I can see that you will benefit from practicing trying to remember your day though. Do you agree?
*[[2020.03.31 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: William.]]
** Sick, breh. You are taking quotes from our research up in your [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]. Now THAT is pod-racing, sir.
** Alright, I'll bite. Why should I agree that the [[faith]] you have in mind consists in //truly// insufficient evidence given every context? Aren't there particular cases in which (and levels at which) that is the best epistemic warrant that can be achieved?
*[[2020.03.31 – Wiki Review: *Shakes own hand*]]
** It can be crucial to make jokes about oneself. I hope you do so while still respecting the whole and the goal.
*[[2020.03.31 – Prompted Introspection: Hey kids, do you like violence?]]
** Ah. I am lucky to see this from two of my friends. 
** Okay, so your argument about violence in general seems sane. I'm not here to argue about that. My problem with it is that you don't explain how your argument here relates to the question.
*** Fine work, btw. 
*** You have a missing cart in the conversation train. You leapfrogged to a principle, but you didn't apply it to the context presented in the question. 
**** This is really hard to deal with as an autist. Insofar as it is reasonably up to you, you must train yourself to write trains of thought that others cleanly understand. There is a train of thought here which is crystal clear. You can do even one better by having fully answered the question.
*[[2020.03.31 – h0p3ful Review: The Mountain]]
** Your titles have been more descriptive. I'm really happy about that. You are spending time figuring out how to name things (or when not to care, or how to care, I don't know). 
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** //Asimov// should be next. Bang through //1984//. Let's have a set of books that are fun, interesting, and useful to our communications. We need paradigms, perspectives, and shared languages from our stories. Please dive into the worlds, sir.
