title: 2019.03.26 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Justified Coercion

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I think it only makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority, hierarchy, and domination in every aspect of life, and to challenge them; unless a justification for them can be given, they are illegitimate, and should be dismantled, to increase the scope of human freedom.

[[Saint Chomsky]] is not a soulless legal positivist engaged in mere conceptual analysis of "valid" governments (wherein even a Nazi government is still a government). He clearly believes coercion must always be justified while remaining open to the moral necessity of legitimate governments obtaining in the first place. He's right, but it turns out to be a quagmire of a problem.

What counts as justification? Living democratic social contractarian methods, e.g. implementing [[The Original Position]], are necessary for decentralized justification of any authority. The [[VOI]], [[ROG]], and [[The Golden Rule]] seem to be at the heart of justified justice. My metaethical perfectionism is likely a huge monkeywrench. It turns out that freedom and what we owe to others with our freedom is an extraordinarily hard problem to safely codify even as rules of thumb. I don't think we have the moral right to be anyone, and my monadic view of normativity leads me to believe that few kinds of moral rights don't ultimately translate to legal rights. Free speech is a shining exception.
