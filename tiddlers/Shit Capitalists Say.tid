!! Why Isn't This Parody?

* A rising tide lifts all boats.
* I'm just doing my job.
* Hate the game, not the player.
* Someone else will do it if I don't.
* It's just business.
* Vote with your wallet.
* It's good for the economy.
* Work or die.
* You must earn your own right to breathe.
* Might makes right.

!! Parody

* I’m not a sheeple who believes feminism. I have a PhD in tensor calculus. I get paid $130k to type “from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier” and the hardest I ever think now is when I read libertarian economy blogs about how my python code might have feelings.
