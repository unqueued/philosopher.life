title: 2017.07.23 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.07.22 - Wiki Review Log]]
** I love the weekends.
* [[2017.07.22 - Carpe Diem Log]]
** I'm surprised that I poop so little on the weekends, even though I eat a ton. Maybe we should eat other things, yeah?
* [[2017.07.22 - Pipefitting Log]]
** Make dat money.
* [[Highdeas Log Template]]
** I think the "edited" section needs to be used judiciously. There's a reason I switched from "New" to "Recent."
* [[2017.07.22 - Highdeas Log]]
** Spinning up some accounts really would be useful. My wife liked the idea as well.
* [[Highdeas Log]]
** Edits.
* [[2017.07.22 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** Seems like an important question. Genetics and memetics clashing.
* [[2017.07.22 - Link Log]]
** Is it a bad thing when I don't have anything, in particular, to say about a link beside "yup" or "interesting"?
* Sync wasn't working last night. I should sync before I leave home just to make sure I don't run into this problem. Again, that blasted router. Worked this morning though.
