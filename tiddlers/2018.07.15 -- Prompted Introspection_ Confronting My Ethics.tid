title: 2018.07.15 -- Prompted Introspection: Confronting My Ethics

!! What situation has caused you to confront your ethics recently?

I believe my autism enables me to see the fabric of our lives with a breathtaking detail that others don't (for various reasons). That isn't to say my model is a good one, but I do think there's something to be said for taking my autistically enriched perceptions into account in meshing with our Top-down modeling in our Bayesian equation.

I'm convinced every moment of my life, down to the last detail, is an ethical moment. I take the Utilitarian Calculus seriously. My understanding of virtue theory extends from the cognitive all the way down into the non-cognitive aspects of our identities, into that realm we cannot directly attend or represent in us. I take Kant to his particularistic limits in my universalist contextualism. The details matter. Everything adds up. It's a big moral equation, and we're heurstically attempting to model and experience it as wisely as we can. That doesn't mean we can solve it all the way down, but that we should know where the telos points.

Everything that matters is ethical, or at least as far as I can tell. [[The Good]] is exactly what lights up the world for us.
