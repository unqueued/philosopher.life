title: 2017.08.31 -- Pipefitting Log

They told me I can't have my computer on the job, but I can have my phone. No headphones either? They, Chester in particular, appear to have a hard-on for me. Literacy scares ignorant and selfish people. They made it a point to call me out in the morning meeting. Lol. =)

Chris-M and I talked about it after break. He rightly pointed out that several labor practices at Yates are against the law. There is nothing we can do about it unless we banded together. But, we won't. Too many ignorant, selfish conservatives and temporarily embarrassed millions with Stockholm Syndrome. It's nice to see Chris-M agree. While we may radically disagree in some ways, he is obviously very intelligent and experienced in several realms.

We filled out our paperwork. We grabbed some clamps (broke on while working) and put on the nuts and bolts of the support of the supply header. The people in charge should have done this before they mounted the vertical pipe on the header. Fools.

It rained very hard. We were soaked and we were having a very difficult time applying the victaulic lubricant to the flanged end of the return header.

Lucas and I took measurements and checked the iso. I clearly was faster at understanding it, despite his near journeyman status. We had a disagreement about how best to pull a measurement to make sure a support wasn't going to hit a victaulic fitting. My way was best, and I solved it in 2 minutes. I measured off the supports, and he wanted to redraw center lines and then calculate from that.  After I did my way, we eventually did it his way (because we had literally nothing to do) to make him feel better. I obviously offended him by ignoring his suggestion and going with my own which was obviously better. I went on to explain why we could trust the supports after, and I gave him a way to save face by just claiming he didn't trust them at first. He saw I was right afterwards, I believe. He treated me with more respect today, far more like a peer.

We were rained out. I talked to Chris-M about the job, and asked him for his advice. He advised instrumental fitter, millwright, or PLC (his brother does it). All reasonable options.

We had a BBQ for "us," but really for Eastman, luring them into our "family" and bullshit. 

They gave me my laptop back and the end of the day. Danka' massa'.
