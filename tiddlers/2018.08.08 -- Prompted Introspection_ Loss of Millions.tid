title: 2018.08.08 -- Prompted Introspection: Loss of Millions

!! How do you think sudden loss of millions would affect your familial relationships and friendships?

Why does the suddenness matter? My donors have an "elite" fundamentalist Christian education, so the notion of the Rapture (and the various other eschatological interpretations) is something we're familiar with.

As far as I'm concerned, millions are suffering and dying right now. This is WW3, or WW2 never really ended. It's a transnational war, not merely international. War has evolved, but MAD dynamics are causing the elite to cloister against us. 

Besides my wife and children, and to some degree my brothers, nobody in my family believes me when I explain what I see. I think most of them are immoral in their approach to politics. I love them, but they disgust me.
