title: Paradise Lost: The Novel

Lucifer, Son of Light

"Self-conceived, self-raised by our own evolving power."

I've read and listened about this Spiritual Dimension for too long. Even if it's poetry, I think it's stupid at best (more likely: manipulatively beautiful imagery). I'm tired of walking through the pointless contradictions here. I agree to mysticism, but only when I have no other choice. Virtue is Knowledge; this purposely chosen ignorance of this book is malice.

This book makes me furious. I fucking hate the vast majority of Christians I know, and this is rhetoric. I've yet to meet one who is going to stand toe-to-toe with me in The Dialectic. I recognize construction is the hard part, but I'm tired of this evil. The Judeo-Christian memeplex is not about [[The Golden Rule]], it only purports to be. Shed everything but those the two greatest commandments and deanthropomorphize God in [[The Good]]. There is no personal God. This is a dangerous myth.

I am extremely interested in my children having a profound understanding of Christianity as a political organization and memeplex evolving in history. I'm going to deconstruct it with them too. This is why I don't trust the emotions of others: they haven't attempted to habituate their emotions with Reason. 

Pandemonium is the right word for this garbage. It's a flood of symbols and reference and no real meaning beneath it.

I'll say it again, most people have been alienated from themselves (via Capitalism), but many choose to live invalid lives to varying [[dok]] as well. This book is yet another demonstration. 

Why is the Christian God not just another idol? Give me the reason. This book is a work of Romanticism. It's mythological bullshit designed to make you feel without thinking. You have to do them both [[irwartfrr]]!

It's a flowery and lengthy depiction of this symbol. It is art? Yes. Is it beautiful? In some respects. Is it Good or Right? No.

This book makes me wish was a hell for its author(s) to burn in. The wasted computation, lives, and suffering from this horseshit is mind-boggling to me.

The Fall of Man will always be a hypothetical Agential God's fault. This book is a reminder of what I really hate. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE LIFE WORSE. LOOK AT THE HUMANS AROUND YOU.
