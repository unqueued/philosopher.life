Chomsky definitely seems to believe in the existence of a capitalist cabal.  It seems almost nice to believe in its existence, since that would mean there is a head we can cut off the capitalist snake

But I am afraid the cabal, in so far as it does exist, is an emergent entity.

Also, his reaction to drug use kind of blows

I found a lot of his statements powerful, but it is also heavy, a place we dare not look.  He has a real kwisatz haderach vibe, like you, and it can honestly feel terrifying to read

Reminds me of that one rap song you sent me.

I will be on the lookout for unjustified cabal claims. Chomsky seems to accept it is emergent as well. I will think more about it.

I don't think he means to imply we can easily the cut the head off the snake. His socialist perspective seems quite decentralized to me.
WED 12:06 PM
He seems to favor some drug usage but not others. He does call the war on drugs for what it is.

What rap song did i recommend?

I forget the title. Opens with fucking. He starts arguing about God. They don't order a pizza. She leaves.

You talking about the rhythm? Didn't listen to the words on the missy elliot
WED 12:10 PM
Rhythm of the music, the style of singing/flow. Aye.
WED 12:12 PM
Yeah, that is kinda the mumble rap derivative that is everywhere now
