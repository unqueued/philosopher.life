title: 2019.07.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Support Is So EZ

* Woke at 10
* Decided not to do [[Fitness Routine]] yet again. =/
* Fireman Time!
* Cleaned the house. 
** Without offspring, it's a cinch.
* Read+Write
** I'm surprised (somehow) by the assholes I've met. I'm grateful to those who aren't (even in profound disagreement).
* We aren't making so much food. Without the offspring, it's just different. 
** My god, it's so much easier without them. ROFL. It's not like my day is wildly different: I still spend a fuckton of time on my computer, but I'm not in constant pressure mode to get my offspring to do anything. It hasn't been a vacation, but I've felt so much more at ease.
* My tea-making method annoys my wife like most of my cooking. I just throw it together. I'm currently not boiling water; our tap is insanely hot to me, and that's what I put straight into a cheap spigoted container with some tea bags. The container is bowing out, warping, but that's fine. I can make large quantities of tea without much work. Even if I had to buy a container every month, it would be worth my time.
* Actually got some reading of books done today, though I have nothing to say. (Wat!)
* The interview went well.
** I can't take that job, but I had fun on the interview. I felt confident though reserved. 
* Read+Write
