title: 2018.06.06 - Wiki Audit Log: JRE

Cleaning up, self-referentially: [[Wiki Audit Log]].

I've noticed that some of my logs are so close to my axioms that they may themselves be theorems. Theorems of what algorithms to implement. 

Some of my long-standing, permanent, themselves axiomatic projects have their own logs embedded in them. Some logs need their own directory though. Those are important in a powerful way to me it seems. 

I'm still trying to figure this out.

I've spent a lot thinking about my brother [[JRE]] and the game theoretic aspects of [[T42T]].
