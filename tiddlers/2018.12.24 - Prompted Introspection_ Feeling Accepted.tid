title: 2018.12.24 - Prompted Introspection: Feeling Accepted

!! Tell about a time when someone made you feel welcomed or accepted. What did they do and how did it make you feel?

Ah, this is a tough one for me. I agree that ingroup/outgroup mentalities and culture wars are conceptually necessary to the dialectic. Indeed, I do not accept a Nazi for who they are; their identity, to some non-trivial [[dok]] is invalid. There are times when I am obligated to feed and clothe them, and I am always obligated to offer knowledge to them (this is part of why they are so very responsible), but there are also clear cases where I'm obligated to kill them. As always, [[IA2DYJ]]. Having [[The Right]] reason to pick the outgroup in your context is something which must take [[Humanity]] as your tribe; and, indeed, the preservation and maximization of [[The Golden Rule]] is what's at stake. It is easy to be wrong about who deserves to be shunned.

I have long been the alien. I know some people think they enjoy the feeling of being different, think being special is the goal, or whatever (I suggest they haven't experienced alienation nearly enough<<ref "a">>). The hipsterian pursuit of the ironically novel aesthetic destroys itself (which, of course, is also part of the shtick); I'm not talking about that (though I strongly value finding new and valuable things). I really don't fit in with others. Even when all parties are trying, it isn't an efficient fit. It's painful for me. It is obvious why depression rates increase with IQ among autistic people (skyrocket high rates too, to the point some confuse it as part of the cluster): they are increasingly aware of the fact that they will not connect with others (and we are hardwired for it, unlike genetic psychopaths). I think it's like the whale that sings at a frequency the other whales can't hear (though more bi-directionally lacking).

I would have had a much sadder and angrier answer to this question earlier this year. The [[FTO]] axiomatic project has changed my mind on the matter.

[[Sphygmus]] is my favorite example.<<<ref "l">> I didn't even reach out to her; she reached out to me. It's one thing to wander onto the playground to ask to join the other kids, and it's another for someone to reach out to befriend you instead. Talk about kindness! Her [[first letter|2018.08.29 - Sphygmus: Find The Others]] to me was so moving: an anonymous stranger who actually cared. Part of me, of course, didn't even trust it (how could that be real?).<<ref "u">> But, it is obvious she pays attention to details, and that is a strong signal. Mind you, this is the desert of words alone. You have to listen to empathize in this case; that is a far higher cost than most people will ever pay.

Now, I definitely have experienced many [[dok]] of kindness in my life (and I'm a lucky sumbitch in many respects), and I've had someone help me with my broken down car before, etc. If I'm hungry, many people would feed me. We are wired to be able empathize with the immediate guttural concerns (which is a good thing), but empathy for one's beliefs and desires (beyond the immediate physical needs) is an entirely different ballgame in my experience.<<ref "c">> It is true: man cannot live on bread alone. This is an existential loneliness.<<ref "t">>

How did I feel being accepted? Shocked. I stared at the screen for an hour thinking about the letter. I wasn't even sure I was accepted, but even the strong possibility of it was shocking. I spent less time/energy reasoning about my $250,000 acceptance letter to my PhD program (a sum of money worth maybe a bit less than my entire lifetime income); looking back, I need to correct what I said in [[my first response|2018.08.30 - Sphygmus: Sphygmoscopic]]: it is, in fact, the kindest letter I've ever received in my life. Also, acceptance here doesn't have to mean agreement (that's missing the point in some respects); it is as simple as being taken seriously, listened to, heard, thought worthy of the computational time of others to reason and feel about even a semblance of another. I am indebted to be shown by an[[other]] what it means to occupy space and time in their minds so generously.

Suffering conceptually enables meaning, and I think it empirically generates a source of commonground. [[Sphygmus]] knows what it's like to be alone; I think her awareness is both a rich internal phenomenology and external explanation of social interactions and principles humans use to engage each other (i.e. virtuous knowledge in theory and practice). I'm going to read [[The Solitude of Prime Numbers]].<<ref "r">> She didn't ask, but I think it's important that I can appreciate this book which is obviously a gateway to understanding her.

<<footnotes "l" "The last time I felt that welcomed was grad school (e,g, [[GB]], though our relationship started out rocky until he figured out I wasn't a complete idiot ;P -- [[MTG]] helped too).">> 

<<footnotes "u" "A doubt I have since sealed off. My faith in her is implicit at this point. She is a [[Root User]], whether she exercises it or not.">>

<<footnotes "c" "It's clear that one of the flaws of globalized capitalism is that the victims are so fundamentally faceless to those of us in power (to varying [[dok]]). Empathy based upon seeing the sadness in your starving eyes will overcome me; but out of sight, out of mind. It is easy to callously disregard the masses when we never see the faces of individuals.">>

<<footnotes "t" "Thailand demonstrated to me so clearly how many people live their lives with literally not a single real friend.">>

<<footnotes "r" "I would like to also say up front: I'm just not very talented at reading stories like others. My best effort isn't going to be as good as those in my life who have obviously more practice and innate talent at it.">>
