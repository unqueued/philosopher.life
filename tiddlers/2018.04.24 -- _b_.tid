Why does it matter if they know you? What do you actually contribute to their existential lives? I don't think you've fundamentally changed, and I don't think you will. I have seen the evidence of who you are, and I don't think you are fit. It's that simple.

You're obviously bad news for the people closest to you. Those of us with significant memories of you know it. 

You are highly manipulative people, and my children don't need the bullshit you are feeding other people and yourselves.

You are free to argue your points in text, and I will post them (and all responses). I will not twist your words. I can and will show why you're being illogical. I can walk you to the bottom. I see the tree of inferences better. Make your case without relying upon your real-time emotional manipulation and rhetoric; you'll find your persuasiveness disappears. That's a giant redflag. 

You really are psychopaths. You are far from the worst, and you do good things in the world, but you can't escape what you've done and who you really are. You aren't attempting to change that about yourself. It is no accident that your sons are estranged. You are dark triads, although you conceal it to most; you're successful sociopaths who have effectively lied enough to themselves that they don't even face the fact that it is an illusion. I'm done with your mask.
