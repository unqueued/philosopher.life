Busy as always but good nevertheless

How about you?
SUN 7:05 PM
The exact same, Lol.

Lucky to have time with family.
SUN 7:05 PM
I think I get to see them more of my family than the average man gets to see theirs.
SUN 7:07 PM
Family time is very precious. I wish I could see mine every day. I envy you there

I also enjoy the distance [[L]] and I have from our immediate family for privacy reasons. It’s a weird problem.
SUN 11:39 PM
That is a complex problem.
SUN 11:40 PM
Also I’m very excited for the Christmas cabin!! :)
SUN 11:40 PM
I don't understand enough about your situation in particular, but I think I impose a difficult calculation on everyone when it comes to privacy. Do you find that particularly difficult for us?
SUN 11:44 PM
I am also excited about the cabin! 
SUN 11:44 PM
Not in the least bit. I wish we were just a little bit closer. Haha. 

I’m convinced [[AA]] would come see us every day if we lived next door. Unannounced lmao.
