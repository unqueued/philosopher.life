title: 2019.09.30 - Prompted Introspection: Feel Sad

!! What is something that makes you feel sad?

When you look back and see you've made little or no progress on your {[[dreams]]}, keep falling in the same traps, and you've not corrected your course but instead feel helplessly doomed to repeat the insanity. Yeah, there's a glimmer of [[hope]] at the top of that mountain which I have less and less time to scale. You know, my wife says that about herself, but that's not who I see in her at all. I see a woman of radical progress and integrity. I'm ridiculously lucky to have my family. Even if they drive me insane, my children are why I'm here (and they are damned [[good]] people), and my wife the most sacrificial person I've ever encountered (she's all purpose, through and through). I know that I feel lonely, but they [[power]]ful forces for feeling connected. They intervene on me. Deep breaths, accept the sweet sadnesses, reflect on the oscillations in life, and carp them diems.
