title: McManus: A Brief Critique of Originalist Constitutional Histories

https://merionwest.com/2018/05/23/a-brief-critique-of-originalist-constitutional-histories/

<<<
The crude theory of democratic legitimacy only follows if the originalist narrative that there was a social contract signed by genuine representatives of the “people” has any credibility.
<<<

Preach. 

I'd add that if intentions matter (and it seems like they have to), if I understand correctly, the constitution was meant to be redrafted very often. I'm not convinced Originalists really mean it at all for that reason as well.

Ironically, if they believe the Origins were meant to maintain centralized power structures in the hands of a few, then they might actually be following through. Justifying conservation of classism, of course, is another matter.

<<<
Those bothered to show concern with this hypocrisy often argued that the rights and interests of these groups were “virtually” represented during the deliberations. 
<<<

This turns out to be a complex problem for me in [[The Original Position]]. For example, it's obvious to me that children deserve a vote (though representing them for a vote is no simple matter). It seems future humans should have a vote, it's not clear how to build such a thing which doesn't devolve into confabulation that rationalizes whatever we want to say on their behalf. Maximizing and de-virtualizing representation is a hard problem, though that does not give us any right not to pursue it obviously.

<<<
The U.S. Constitution was hardly the product of a democratic social contract.
<<<

Preach.

<<<
This suggests Americans should have a more radical, and more inclusive, discussion about just what the Constitution should mean and be for the next 230 years
<<<

There "should" be humans 230 years from now, but I don't predict it. You are correct though.
