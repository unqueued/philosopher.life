title: 2018.09.05 -- Deep Reading: LOTR:FOTR

I love how Trees may in fact communicate. This isn't some OOO point either (but it could be). Parts of LOTR become more real to me.

Tom Bombadil will forever be the most problematic character in the entire fucking series. I have a billion questions, and I know Tolkien has zero fucking answers besides his whim. What was his subconscious malfunction?

Goldberry sounds like a good slut. Ring my bell, girl.

This section is one of my least favorite in the series during reading, but I like to ask the "what if's" and "what does it means about the ontology?"  questions outside (or I did).
