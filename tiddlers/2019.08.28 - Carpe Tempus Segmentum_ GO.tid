title: 2019.08.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: GO

* Woke at 10:30
** Dreams are still intense, but I don't remember them as usual. I've been waking up with my sensory strip on fire.
* Meditation
** Felt like I was phasing in and out.
* Fireman Time!
* Cleaned, laundry, etc.
* Jumped into day with offspring
* Read+Write
** The link dragon just keeps building. Well, I have the RAM to sit on it. 
* Wrestling with my children. 
** Parts of their school work are good, but CS has been garbage too often.
*** This is your fault too, bucko.
* Read+Write
* Momentarily jumped on brother's account to do dailies, but I was struggling. It's different enough that I'd have to rewire a new framework onto his setup (playing another person's character is not easy; mine must look just as insanely specific).
* Work
* So tired, just held my wife for a bit
* Got drunk
* Ribs, onions, wedges, salad
** My wife said she put too much salt on them, but I adored them. We're going to have to make this a thing.
* WoW
* Sleep by 3:30
