How's your week, and what you up to this weekend?
Sat 12:15 PM
 Hey dude. Work was boring as usual. Helicopters, jet fuel, special forces everywhere. Lol.
Sat 12:19 PM
 lol =)

 But having Fridays off now, working 4 10s is da bomb. I've been working on my truck since Thursday night and really getting the engine dialed in and removing all minute hesitations and studders. Which is a challenge! But lots of success. Avoid yard work as much as possible. Here's a video of my excitement. How aboutbyou man, what's been up?

 Had a friend who was the tank instructor at Ft. Knox. Definitely some flashy cool things, but overall, he found his job pretty boring.
Sat 12:22 PM
 I've been up to my usual: https://philosopher.life/ -- Reading and writing! (Hooray)
Sat 12:22 PM
 had fun working with my daughter on a piece of software.

 There are these UTF characters that have "zero-width"...so you can stack a billion characters between two normal characters, and there is no difference in appearance.

 Video is loading... Dude! You should get a welder and start making art!
Sat 12:23 PM
 Totally lost on that, but I'm sure you all had a blast.
Sat 12:25 PM
 I Google uft characters and still don't get it. Lol.

 My daughter's script converts standard writing into zero-width characters; the previous sentence above is found between these the "h" and "i" of: h‍‌‍​‍‌‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‌‍‌‌‌​​‌​‌​‌‍​​​​‌‌‌​​​‌​‌‌‍‌​‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍‍‍​‍​​‍​​‌​​‌‌​​​​‌​‍‍‍​​‌​​​‍‌‍​‍​‍‌‌‌​‌‌‌‍​‍‌‍‌‌‍‌‌‌​‍​‍​‍​​‌‍‍‍​​​‌​‌‌​‍‌‍‍‍‌​​​‍​‍​‍​‌‌​‌​‌‍‍​‌​‌‍​‌‌‍​‍‍‌‌‌​‌‌​​​‍‌​‍​‍‌​‍‌‌‌‍‌‌‍​​‌‍​‍‍‍‍‍​​‍‌‍​‌‍​‌​‌‍‍​​‌‍‌​‌‌‌​​‌‍‍​‍‌‍‍​​​​‌​‌‍​​‍‌‌‌‍‍​‌‌‍‍‍​‌‍​‌​‍‌‌‌‌​‍‍‍​‍‍‍‍‍‍​‍​‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‍‍​‍​‍‌‌‍‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‍‍‍‍‍‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌‍‍​‌‍‍‍‌‍​‍‌‍​​‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​‍‌‌​‍‍‌‌​​‌‌​‍​​​​‍​‌​‍​​‍‍‌​‌‌‍‌​‍‌​‍​​‍‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‍‍‍​‍​‌​​​​‍‌​‌​‌‍‌‌‌​‍‌‍‌‌‍‌‌​‌​‌‍‌‍‍​​‍​‍‌​​‍‌‌‍‍‍‍​‌​‍‍‍‍‌​‍​​‍‍‌‍‌‌‍‍‍​‌​​‌‍‍‌​​‌‍​‍‌‍‌​‌‌‌‍‌​‌​​​‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‍​‌​‍‍‌‌​​‍‍‍​​‌​‌‍​‌‍‍‌​‍​‌​‌​‌​‌‍‌​‍‍​‌‍‍​​​​‍​​‌‍​‌‌​‌‌‍‌‍​‍‌​‍‍‍​‌‍‍‍​​‌‌‌‍​​​‌​‌​​​‌‍‍‍‌‍​‍‌‌​‌​​‍‌​‌‍‌​‌​‍​‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‍​‌​‌‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‌‍​‍‌​‍‍‍‌​‍‍‍‍‍‌‍‌‍‌​​‍‌​‌‌​​​​‍​‍‍‌‌‌‌​‌‌‍‌​​​‍​‌‌​‌‍‍‌‍‍​‌​​‌​​​‌​‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍‌​‍‍‌‍​‍​‌‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​​‌‍‌​‌‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‌‍​​​​‌​‍‌​‍‍​​‍‍‍‍‍‌‌‍​‍​‌‌‍‌‌‍​‌‌​​​‍‌‌​‍‍​​​​​‍‌‌​‍‌​‌​‍‍‌​‌‌‍​‌‌‍‍‌i

 ha, it's good to see your smile =0
Sat 12:26 PM
 I have made art welding. I don't have any pics because I gave them as gifts to people I love.
Sat 12:27 PM
 Indeed. Everyone should smile more! I'm running the roads today and checking flea markets for guns and random stuff.
Sat 12:27 PM
 I suck at welding, bad. I can do oxy acetylene welding better than anything actually.
Sat 12:28 PM
 I wish I had the chance to practice TIG.
Sat 12:30 PM
 welding is an art
Sat 12:30 PM
 I don't want to do it all day though.
Sat 12:30 PM
 Most of the welders I know end up with poor eyesight (even the safe ones)
Sat 12:31 PM
 Yeah. All the guys I work with have hearing loss. It sad and hilarious and hilarious to listen in on a conversation between us. Literally every time someone says something there's someone that says what? LOL
