//Counting my chickens...I still must have a goal and plan for the future.//

We have a budget. We need to stick to it. We should live fairly Spartanly. We can nearly live off k0sh3k's salary already. The first money we make should go towards getting phones for everyone and a work/travel/living vehicle for me. After that, it is savings gravy. We can do it. We must be disciplined. We have a goal: to be happy. That is a goal that takes time to achieve. We have to build towards it.

We're still near the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy in some senses. I don't mean we are starving or anything like that (far from it). But, we could not accept a single serious catastrophe. Our lives are not secured enough to deal with fundamental emergencies. We have depleted our reserves. That's what I'm going to fix first. Emergency savings is the first step. 

Immediate safety savings goals (in this order):

*5k Checking
*10k Savings
*5k Cash
*5k Cryptocurrency
*5k "Crisis" commodities
** Physically portable, highly liquid, and low price-elasticity.
** These are likely the kinds of goods which sky rocket in value during the worst of times.
**//Prima facie//, I think gold is mistakenly thought to dwell here
*** There are times when we take the jewels, and there times when we leave them behind; this is not crisis proof.
*** There are more functional options.

If the political winds continue to even more rapidly become violent, I may need to find even more fundamental shelter. I could easily see us spending the next 5k prepping. Beyond that, I think it is unreasonable. 

One final point about Safety Savings: it must scale with inflation. This is the only smart way to gauge our emergency position, to not be surprised, and to pay the upkeep cost of aging with our wealth.

Basically, after our initial safety margins are met, we can enter into actual savings to build towards our future beyond merely having the resources to handle the emergencies of the present. It's hard to plan far into the future. There are so many variables to consider, so many risks, unknowns, etc. The major problem at the moment is that we don't actually have our own property/house.<<ref "2">> Finding a place of our own would obviously be the next step.

I want to own a house by 2022. I'm going to work my ass off. I want the stability, comfort, privacy, and emergency readiness of a house. I want a base to work from. I want it before I even start saving for retirement (I'm not convinced we will ever retire [so many moral and political problematics], but if we do, it will be through a very unique combinations of tricks). I want this before I even pay off students loans.<<ref "1">> I see it as a matter of practicality that I secure my family's life before everything else. That is the goal.
 
It is very possible that I will bring in between $40-100k a year gross (large range, I realize, but projecting this far fuzzes my accuracy, and I've not adjusted for inflation yet). By 2022, I should make $160-400k gross, and while I can't project tax rates (particularly with Trump), I will conservatively estimate a 40% tax rate (may also see school loan-based garnishment). Thus, I think $64k-240k is a reasonable possibility. This means I range from just spinning my wheels all the way to banking $160k. Clearly, I will need to push very hard and scrimp like I would in a video game.<<ref "3">>

Assuming the stars aligned, I can outright buy a house (especially if the housing bubble bursts again, assuming rent-seeking capitalists don't eat us alive), and if not, at least provide a very reasonable down payment. 

At this point, we might consider the lateral possibility of nomadic living done correctly. Who else is better prepared besides the nomad? There is something gutteral and Maslowian about owning your own house.<<ref "4">> So many scenarios make the most sense when you have your own place and a place in a geographic community. Roots and relationships are useful (although, Crisis defeats that as well). Perhaps the goal is to have a bit of both. The person with the "go bag" and the base is in the best position. Know what you value, actually be prepared, and protect it.

I should add cosmetics, such as braces for the kids, and other social lubricants. There is money to be spent to make my children appear acceptable to the world.<<ref "5">> Class, status, self-advertisement, one's brand, reputation, Face, how we project ourselves, what it is that others gutterally and instinctually value in us, etc. cannot be written off. We must prepare for this lizard demon. We must respond with the right tools in the right ways at the right time. We must be scientific in our empathic endeavors to enable others to bypass their lizard brains and empathize with us for the right sorts of reasons. This is the only practical option. Unfortunately, at least for now, this is not a fixed cost that I can easily project. I don't know enough. That doesn't mean planning isn't worthwhile. We must think!

In any case, I believe Trump's presidency is a danger to us (I'd think the same for Hillary as well, it would just be a different kind of threat). I would not be surprised by WWIII or other kinds of more complex conflicts that we don't have the ontic+epistemic categories to nicely describe. I need to secure my family while I still can. Prepare for the unknown. I don't mean to lash out in fear or curl up into Red Scare isolationism. I need to find the right balance, the golden mean. I would love an injection of actual practical wisdom^^tm^^ right now. I must train continue to train my empathy muscles for the Crisis, since that is exactly when I will need them most.

Okay, so...hope for the best, prepare for the worst. We see the law of diminishing marginal utility. Wield that principle! It does look odd, I must say. So, I do want an apocalyptic-ready house of sorts (not zombies, but instead ready for a nosedive deeper into economic depression and who knows what else, yes). Admittedly, I've got a spot of "prepper" in me. I think anyone paying attention should be very worried in this way though. Eventually, I'll need safe places to save and invest my wealth (oh, Silas Marner).  

I'm completely open to unconventional housing. I don't give a shit what other people find to be a beautiful house. We can go into the Mac-resale value argument for houses, but it is an important question of whether or not we are here for the longhaul. k0sh3k loves her job. That said, if my previous years are any indication, I will be highly nomadic. So, do I aim for walled-garden Utopia house or comfortable mobility?

We should consider very odd kinds of housing which can be more price efficient, even if it is unconventional and less desired by average people. There are many questions to ask, e.g.: how sustainable, independent, off-the-grid, protectable, secluded, internet-accessible (I've got a lot of neat technical tricks up my sleeve, as long as I'm within a couple miles of a connection) will it be? 

Super-Ideally:

* We will live in the woods, preferably at the top of a hill.
* Trees are nice.
* We will live next to a source of fresh (or filterable) water on or adjacent to our property that would survive global warming effects (not sure how to judge that).
* We will have excellent internet access (while it is there; we can also just build our own networks). 
* We will have an all-in-one greenhouse (complex ecosystem with tilapia farm, etc.) to at least produce a significant portion of our food.
* Solar power generation.
** Moving water or wind may also be small sources of electricity in a pinch.
* Very powerful insulation and resource conservation attributes.
* Gated/Fenced
* A workshop
* A parking lot
* A minimal or non-existant lawn (automated caretaking if we do)
* A pool (as convenient as possible if so)
* Barracks for storing my entire extended family.

Dreaming:

*A hobbit home would be sick. 
**Certain aspects of it would be very energy efficient. There are lots of logistical problems. The stars would need to align.
* A true analogue library (printing, binding, cataloging, storing, etc.)
* Hidey holes, mass storage protected beneath the ground.

Realistically:

*We get whatever price-efficient 3-bedroom place we can find nearby.

In any case, I should avoid the rat race when possible, and when required, engage in it cleverly. I might not have what it takes, but I've succeeded in other microcosms. Let us hope I can scale up when the stakes matter. I will find the cracks in the system, the boundaries of the world. Do not use people, but protect your family. That is why you are alive for now.
