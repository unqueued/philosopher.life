!! Audit:

* We saw a lot of family and friends over the past 2 months.
* I will one day learn to just not do cool things on my computer without a VPN.
** I wish I had a kind of QubesOS like ability to just direct entire swathes of my computer through a permanent VPN. I don't want to setup a new user, etc. for this.
* These lists tend to be fairly brief and too generic. I need to work on being more specific.
* Are these lists just too short? I need to ask my wife. Anxiety!
* I've been working on my computers a lot, perhaps too much. I know it is a drug for me.
* I am not getting the right work done, I fear. Although, I am accomplishing tasks that much be accomplished.
