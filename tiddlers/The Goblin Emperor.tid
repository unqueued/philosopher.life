* Maia is an underdog from the sounds of it.
** Let us see if he lives up to my scrutiny.
** I fear such a character because it is usually a bland mirror in which we all see ourselves.
* Strong characterization and court intrigue.
** I'm going to have a tough time keeping track of everyone.
* I will be interested to see the dialectical relationship between Goblins and Elves (I'm making an assumption here).
* Power structures require my attention.
** Disenfranchisement, privacy, advisors, and the centralization through material dialectics.
* I fear this book is way, way out of my league. If it moves too fast, has too many moving parts, boils me alive with specialized language, or drowns me in characters and tiny details that I cannot track all at once, then surely I will be Maia himself, right?
* I'm looking forward to introspection, and I will test it for integrity and unjustified optimism since naivety is a highly philosophical notion to me.
* What is justice, Maia? Tell me, sir. How do you envision the //ought// through the bleak?
* I hope this only fantasy motif with all the real work being done through the relationships themselves.
* I hope I do not have to constantly be engaged in multi-bookmark referencing and lookups.

Setheris is a dick. Why am I supposed to trust him? Regardless, Maia isn't necessarily kind back; still [[T42T]] thus far, it appears.

He knows he does not know, and he seeks a teacher.

I'm already annoyed by all the //Serenity//'s.

He's a bridge-builder.

I'm enjoying the innervoice of this book quite a bit.

I am reminded of [[Disenchantment]].

No privacy. I'm not sure someone in his position deserves privacy though.

I kind of feel like Maia's need to learn to read between the lines, to understand when people are attempting to deceive him, makes him almost autistic in a sense.

I'm already sick of "This is what it is to be emperor."

The coronation/swearing fealty scene is boring. =(

How many real relationships or engagements are there in this book? Vanishingly few it seems. Everything is re-contextualized into the court, and there is almost no intimacy, honesty, or authenticity. It's hyperreal.

Everything feels the same in this book. The plot is vanilla. The socialization is autistic hell, so perhaps that's the problem for me? 

Maia is the only character I care about strongly, but he feels like Keanu Reeves, as though we are fit into him. Unfortunately, I do not think he is a virtuous agent; he is not an exemplar of good virtue-theoretic reasoning about morality. I think this is an extremely unpopular claim about this book, but I think the author is engaged in non-cognitivism and false virtue signaling about what leading a moral life is really like (and that's even in the specialized royal context). Maia does not experience a wide enough range of emotions or demonstrate enough depth in his moral reasoning about the world around him. His disposition is not believable to me. I think his best attribute is compassion, but even that only feels surface deep in him.

Goblins never apologize for anything, and Maia is clearly exceptional. 

Maia is constantly engaged in character judgment and realpolitik speculation.

Who is the theater for? Always a fine question.

I am pleased with his bright-line distinction between [[The Moral Law]] and the juridical.

A much larger leap of faith must be made to believe someone is being honest when everyone appears to be lying.

In the end, I think it's clear that Maia has natural privacy in his mind. We constantly see the difference between what's going on in his head and how he behaves. Integrity is this recursively difficult dialectic between the private and public. I tend to side with the claim that we are not honestly public enough, obviously.

He makes lists of questions and prepares for conversations in advance. This dude is autistic as fuck. Autistism is simply a contextual difference in rTPJ activations that isn't some immediate choice.

That Maia is so deeply concerned with respecting the dead is a huge strike against him. This demonstrates he is likely more interested in social convention than [[The Moral Law]].

Fantasy always has this "old" feel to it, and so it becomes odd to see contemporary points of view (e.g. feminism) injected into these contexts. Again, I feel like Game of Thrones does well in some respects and poorly in others, and the same for this book.

The assassination attempt is interesting. It is interesting to watch how he wanders through the persons and power structures in reasoning about this betrayal.

This book reminds me of [[Dune]] in how it very clearly depicts institutional knowledge and inertia within political structures.

Socrates+Marx is talking...but it turned negative. =/

I gained nothing from the last half of this book.
