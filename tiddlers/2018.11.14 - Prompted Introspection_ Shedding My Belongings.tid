title: 2018.11.14 - Prompted Introspection: Shedding My Belongings

!! If you had to move across the country what belongings would you get rid of?

My wife and I discuss this often. There is a difference between what I would get rid of and what she would. She is the limit. I beg her to let us get rid of things. That said, I think I have one sex toy that she finds disturbing enough that she'd prefer I didn't own it, but I don't think she would get rid of anything else that I value.

I wish I could give some of my objects away or sell them. I have a piece of garbage in my living room, a fridge I use as a desk/stand. I could get by with fairly minimal belongings. I think it's easier to list what I would keep and be unwilling to give up:

* The clothes on my metal shelves<<ref "b">>
* My monsters, desk, and chair
* My toolbox
* Kitchenware
* Toiletries
* My bed
* Everything my wife and kids want to keep (which will be everything, understandably).

I think having stuff is awesomely convenient.

I know how not to get laid tonight: I'd get rid of the cats. BOOM!
