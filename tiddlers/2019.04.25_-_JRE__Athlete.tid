My brother told me a hilarious story about athlete's foot. It sounded so painful! My brother is kind of a daredevil sometimes.

Rebecca has not heard back on the job front. He offered to just take care of the bills and have her stay at home, but she wants no gaps on her resume.

We talked about saving money and financial literacy.

Mentioned [[Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present]].

We talked about our donors. We walked through their view that "nobody wants to work," survivorship bias, the unreflective hypocritical changes in their views over the decades, their malicious ignorance and unwillingness to take responsibility, and their gaslighting, victim-blaming, and psychopathy. I asked him if he thought they really were interested in an actual dialogue in which we resolve disagreement about these kinds of issues. He admits: "no." They have an emotional investment in Pauline hierarchy and the centralization of power; slaves are meant to be slaves on their view. Who needs reason and participating as full citizens in politics when obeying pastors in churches makes way more sense? They aren't going to own up to the brainwashing.
