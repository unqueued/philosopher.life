title: 2018.02.26 - Prompted Introspection Log: One More Chance

!! I wish I had one more chance to?.. Then I would?..

Wishes...greaaaat. Samwise, please stfu.<<ref "2020.02.27">>

This is an important question though. What do I regret? If I could remove all the mistakes in my life, I wouldn't have my identity. How much do I wish I wasn't myself? I feel strongly in both directions, split. I see the merit of both sides of this equation. 

To the looking back at my past, wishing I could change something, it is important to see [[The Good]] and my lacking in partaking of it. However, what can I really do about it now anyway? Furthermore, it becomes a controversy in [[The Right]], in establishing what it is that I'm actually responsible for. I'm tired of having this debate with myself. Sometimes, I just want to let it go. I don't know how to make my life meaningful if I let it go though.

One more chance to do something given the knowledge I have now or back then? In a way, this is such a futile question. All of what I could have been is obvious to me. With the right parenting, support, background, I could have been a force for good in the world. If only I could have become obsessed with working hard and pursuing eudaimonia at the tender age of 3. Instead, my potential has been wasted and misdirected through a series of deceptions and intricate paranoic charities in approval-seeking that has cost me a great deal. Spilled milk is still worthy of analysis. Aristotle has much to say about the nature of flourishing here, and my habits were not formed by me in crucial respects. I wish I were autonomous. 

Choosing "one" thing can easily become this snowballed conjunction. I can point through the trees of causation to more fundamental problems that would more radically alter my timeline and identity to become what I wished I was. Ultimately, I need to worry about what I hope I will be, not what I wish I was.

How do I answer this question without somehow throwing away what I do love about my life? The butterfly is real. Is it not better to just be happy with what I have? And, yet, when I look at this stoic mentality, my analysis demonstrates its deep metaethical and theoretic failures. Will I remain forever split on this issue? Perhaps. Maybe that is my plight. Thus, if I could go back, I wish I could change whatever is necessary to answer this question definitively. Thus, I give you the most meta-answer I could. #rekt. KYS, Samwise.<<ref "1">>

<<footnotes "1" "It is with deep regret that in the pursuit of honesty with my wife that I point out my failure to recognize in the fullest sense that 'Samwise' has the word 'wise' in it. Part of me knew it all along, but somehow it wasn't explicit enough to my consciousness that I remember it and use it. Maybe I did see it before, but it feels like I'm seeing it again for the first time in a new light. That's stupid.">>
