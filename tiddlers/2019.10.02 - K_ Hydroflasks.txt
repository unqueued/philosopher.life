What you up to?

Sitting in Old English. I’m really far ahead in the text so that’s nice.
OCT 2 9:56 AM
What about you?
OCT 2 9:56 AM
Heck yeah. That is wonderful. You get to chill.
OCT 2 9:56 AM
Is translation becoming easier for you?
OCT 2 9:56 AM
I was going to go shopping, but waiting one more day. Cleaning, schoolwork, finish audits, then work. 
OCT 2 9:57 AM
Definitely. It’s still a hefty workload though.
OCT 2 10:56 AM
Is it super hot down there too?
OCT 2 10:56 AM
Not too hot, thankfully. It's warm, no doubt. I think I've been slowly getting used to warmer temperatures too though.
OCT 2 11:02 AM
It’s hitting 98 here today?
OCT 2 11:38 AM
Wut.
OCT 2 1:17 PM
98 degrees haha
OCT 2 1:18 PM
Jesus, dude. That is some stickyball weather. I hope you are staying hydrated.
OCT 2 1:18 PM
I’m trying. It’s been a rough four weeks.

My public children call their water bottles "hydroflasks" these days.
OCT 2 1:18 PM
We’ve had one light rain?
OCT 2 1:18 PM
Hahaha I need to steal that!
OCT 2 1:19 PM
Have a wonderful day!
OCT 3 9:43 AM
You too.
OCT 3 9:54 AM
Should be packed. Had a tiny flood in the apartment, so that has to be fixed.
OCT 3 9:54 AM
Yikes that sucks! Is everything okay?
OCT 3 9:59 AM
Some ruined books, but everything is good.
OCT 3 9:59 AM
I think it was more of a mental toll on my wife than anything.
OCT 3 9:59 AM
Happened while I was out, but the kids handled it well.
OCT 3 10:00 AM
Poor [[k0sh3k]]. :(
