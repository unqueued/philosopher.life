title: 2018.12.27 - Seeking Sphygmus: names part two

Perhaps you've been saying this all along and I haven't heard it or seen it properly but – names are like antipleonismic salience pointers!! I have the hardest time coming up with names/titles for my projects because I am trying to find the right words to encapsulate the salient essence of the project – which is diamondic and antipleonismic, as I understand those terms.

(and I think I tend to lean toward naming with metaphors that somehow point to the most salient aspect of something for me, though they're still very much works in progress.)
