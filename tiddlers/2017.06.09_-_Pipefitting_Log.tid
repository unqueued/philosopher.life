Today was productive. I studied a chapter and passed a test. My teacher is continually surprised that I'm aiming to finish one a day. It's the best option, I think. I didn't get any shop work done, but it was only a half day.

My teacher had me come over and help him in his office. He is getting his program accredited again this year, and he has a new evaluation rubric he has to create. He had keywords, and he wanted help filling them out. Basically, he wanted me to do his job for him. So, I did. I wrote it out. He said it was more in-depth than he needed, but was happy with it. Quid pro quo. I will need his recommendation.

Also, I passed my drug tests yesterday. I'm now on the hunt! I went to see Randy, but he wasn't there today. I also told my teacher I would be seeing Randy since he had asked about it (and seemed disappointed that I hadn't already done it this week given his advice; again, I need his recommendation).
