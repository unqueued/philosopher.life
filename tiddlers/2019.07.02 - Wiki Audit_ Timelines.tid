title: 2019.07.02 - Wiki Audit: Timelines

I've decided I need to start nesting hierarchies more, especially on the sidebar which is dynamically generated. I don't know how to thin the space between the nested tabs.

---

I'm enabling tiddler folding.

---

I wish I could key-combo+click a link to "make new tiddler tagged with this one."

---

$:/plugins/wikilabs/info-tagmap

Tried out, but I just don't see the point. It also becomes quickly absurd in my wiki which has large bodies of tiddlers with the same tag. This is probably a strike against how I tag.

---

$:/plugins/wimmoermans/history

I've thought about it. I thought it was stupid, but sometimes this is the best way to recover or reason about how I got where I was going.

---

TOC still seems undoable.

---

Can make the toolbar blank out for the most part, but unfortunately, it doesn't work for all buttons.

```
/* TIDDLER TOOLBAR */

.tc-tiddler-view-frame .tc-tiddler-controls svg { fill:transparent; }

.tc-tiddler-view-frame .tc-tiddler-controls:hover svg, .tc-tiddler-view-frame .tc-tiddler-controls [aria-label~=close] svg, .tc-tiddler-view-frame .tc-tiddler-controls .tc-popup svg { fill:#cccccc; }
```

---

$:/plugins/tongerner/tristate v0.1.11
$:/plugins/tongerner/layout_adjustment v0.4.3

I was fairly sure it wouldn't work, and it didn't.

---

I'm cleaning up all of the [[FTO Modes]], and Commander is kicking so much ass. I lurv it.

I walked through all folks pages and cleaned up the formatting and tags.

[[FTO]] has finally been [[remodeled]].

---

[[Tagcloud]] doesn't appear absurdly useful except for providing a quick image for newcomers. Perhaps one day, I'll get to a functioning mindmap (but javascript blows).

---

`#66ff66` is my green function color. Buttons which do unique shit get it.
