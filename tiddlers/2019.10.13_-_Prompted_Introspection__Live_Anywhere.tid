title: 2019.10.13 - Prompted Introspection: Live Anywhere

!! If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be?

Rofl: [[2019.06.17 - Prompted Introspection: Don't Care]]. Alright, fine, I'll try to say something meaningful. There is a chance my wife will become a librarian at Yale Divinity. Assuming we can, I would love to live there. It might increase our odds of escaping the precariat position, it could be an amazing opportunity for my offspring, I think we'd like the weather, and my wife would enjoy her job. I don't think I could ask for more in a realistic wish.
