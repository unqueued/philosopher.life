!! What advice would you give a new student?

Student of what? What is the purpose of this advice? Presumably, my goal is to help them succeed in their practice. But, what if I think their practice is immoral? Alasdair MacIntyre shows us the moral non-realism of Virtue theory. My advice, of course, would need to fit the student, the practice, and the context, among other things. Am I being asked to give generalized advice? Am I assuming I want the student to succeed, and am I to assume success simply counts as what everyone generally considers to be virtue of the practice?

I used to teach. Hell, I still do, but I don't get paid for it. I teach the other students in my class. I teach myself. I teach my children. I give advice all the time to students. Here goes:

* Do your best.
* Work smarter not harder, but still work crazy fucking hard (just not at the expense of efficiency, effectiveness, etc.). Give 110% (Bobby Hill).
* Have a good attitude.
* Do not give up. Don't quit. Persist! Be relentless.
* Empathize with your future self; know thyself; know why you are a student.
* Focus.
* Understand the theory, and grind it in practice/application.
* Practice correctly. For the love of God, practice correctly!
* Be creatively programmatic. Design and follow gameplans. Develop habits which make you virtuous at the practice.
* Understand your goals, find the means to them; break large problems into manageable smaller ones, etc.
* Listen to experts.
* Be insatiable in your pursuit of wisdom and knowledge.
* Be meta.
* Understand the meaning and purpose of what you are doing. Understand the value of your practice.
* Be humble, honest, open to change, willing to fall and stand back up, etc.
* Explore the landscape of your practice.
* Find your niche, develop a competitive advantage, but don't simply work on those things which are easy for you.
* Learn the fundamentals like the back of your hand. Master them.
* Appreciate crossover, hybridization, and interdisciplinary aspects of your practice.
* Perform your practice with moral integrity.
* Maximize your utility.
* Be rational; be empathic.
* Do as the virtuous agent would do, feel as they would, think as they do, be as they would aim for the golden mean, etc.

See, this shit just boils down to the kind of advice we have to give ourselves as students of life. I generalize to the point of absurdity; it's like some shitty self-help list. Ultimately, I need more context to answer the question. I have tons of thoughts about how to learn various subjects, how and what to learn at different ages, and which subjects are worth pursuing and why. I can't just write you a one-size-fits-all answer. The world of learning is simply too broad.

I fear you think I'm literally throwing your question away. But, specificity really is key here. 

Ah, but the answer is obviously not as clear I made it sound either. All too often, moral luck and at least a strong disregard for the opinions, feelings, or thoughts of others form another basis of successful students.

* Be born in the right circumstances.
* Be wealthy.
* Be attractive.
* Don't be unattractive and poor.
* Be intelligent, and if you can, be clever.
* Do not respect authority except yourself (that doesn't mean you don't appear to respect authority). 
* Appearances tends to matter more than substance.
* My [[Common Sense]] page is invaluable to you.
* Cheat where applicable. Be sure to abuse summaries and shortcuts. Find the easiest, laziest way to defeat the system in front of you.

Ah, my student, success is an ugly thing all too often. My advice will have many contradictions in it. Unfortunately, success itself has too many contradictory definitions and contexts.

Give me the telos and context, and I'll try to come up with the means to your ends. Such a maxim, of course, hasn't been universalized. It is mere instrumental reasoning on its own. And, yet again, this house of cards of a question is reduced to absurdity.

Of course, [[RPIN]] and [[KIN]] wage their battles over such fundamental questions. I am not unified enough to answer this question, not that any person I've ever met or read could answer it satisfactorily either. I legitimately wish there was a purgatory for me to talk to my philosopher kingods, at least as I've imagined them with my Straussian charity.

This reminds me, I need to take my DCK this weekend. I clearly need it.
