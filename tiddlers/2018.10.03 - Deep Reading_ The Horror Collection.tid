title: 2018.10.03 - Deep Reading: The Horror Collection

This was different in being a collection. Similar notions across the stories. I agree with my wife that the essence, point of view, etc. is definitely there. There is something quite crystallized here. I think Lovecraft would enjoy these.

There is an enormous amount of attention paid to Art itself.

The fear, anxiety, and danger of Xeno is all there. It's a very specific time period. Again, I know my lit-skills are shit, but I suggest his point of view is so strong that he has a message which has to be teased out. I worry that message is actually lost in this crystallization though! I must ask my wife.
