Here I curate a canon of films with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Everyone develops their own lists and libraries. We collectively do as well in different ways. The goal is to be well-rounded, to have a liberal education, to understand The Great Conversation of Humanity, to understand the cultures and contexts that surround us, to empathize with human beings from all walks of life, and to embed ourselves in the right memetic networks. I happen to think everything I list is worth watching by everyone ("oh my, how arrogant, perfectionist, and provincial of me"). Obviously, my list will be deeply incomplete. In part, this is because I've only seen a fraction of what's out there. But, it's also purposely incomplete because I've also tried to maximize saccharine "enjoyment" factor coupled with memetic heritage over metrics like art-house quality and film-critic style ranking (though, these films, and your experiences of them, obviously merit your interpretation and critique). 

Like television shows, music, and books, I'm forced to reduce the unmanageable body of films I've consumed (which we all have) down to what I consider a watchable, manageable canon. These are the movies my children will be required to see. Writing a list will help me reflect as well. I'm leaving a lot out. I'm trying to be picky. Countless films did not make the list. I'm open to hearing your arguments.

I barely watch movies anymore. If a close friend doesn't recommend it highly to me, then I'm exceedingly unlikely to take the time to watch it (I'm lazy as fuck, and perhaps I'm closeminded in your eyes). I sound like a crotchety old man getting pickier as he ages, but I think movies aren't as good these days, especially for me. Yes, it is harder to move, surprise, and entertain me after having seen so much. However, like every generation, I somehow think we're losing something. 

Producers run their movie scripts through AI optimization engines to maximize earnings. This reduces plots, complexity, themes, and messages to fit the lowest common denominator. Business risk aversion controls the narratives we see. Nowadays, if the majority of the audience can't see themselves as the main character, then it doesn't get made. Unique films are uncommon and worthwhile films even rarer. Monocultures can be problematic, and yet having canons of memes we all share in common is so crucial. We must individually and collectively strike the right balance in finding relevance, value, perspective, and ourselves. Movies can be powerful story-telling devices which teach us to empathize. We do not wield the medium in this way very often though. We should study them carefully. They are some the strongest memetic devices in human history (only the written word can be more exacting and profound than quality movies/videos). Pay attention!

Lastly, I like to rank and categorize. I need to bring order to the chaos of finding relevance. Obviously, a relational database would be more accurate, but I'm not sure it would really be more useful. This will be good enough.
