Hey there I’m sorry I got called in to go back into work and didn’t get to reply. But it’s okay I’m glad honestly it was them & not some strangers in which I am also glad; that Esteban realized it was them and didn’t open the door to confront them. We would have been the ones apologizing 😂

Good. You deserve a break (and more than just sickleave). Also, please don't let me keep you awake. Take every ounce of sleep you can get. [[k0sh3k]]'s trying to do the same today. Feeling bad for both of you.
