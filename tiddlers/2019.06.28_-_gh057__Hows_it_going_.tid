title: 2019.06.28 - gh057: Hows it going?

h0p3,

Hey hope you are having a good summer, Im still working on floors at the school. I think we should have another week or better before finished. I have made your wiki a daily read. I have truly enjoyed reading it. I think we will get along well and thanks for all the kind words. I truly miss our conversations in the afternoon albeit how short they were. Hopefully after i get out of here we can meet up for a beer or something. I hope your family are well. And as soon as i can learn more about using your wiki ill start using it...lol im old and hard to teach and harder to learn things lol. thanks for letting me ramble to you. Thanks for being a friend. Your missed and appreciated.

Best,
