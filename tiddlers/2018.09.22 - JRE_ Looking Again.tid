title: 2018.09.22 - JRE: Looking Again

My brother called me. He was taking a nap after working hard on a very cool project: he built a wooden dinosaur for Raylan's class. Looks amazing. 

He was reconstructing the timeline to think about whether or not he has been confabulating about the difficulty that Raylan has posed. The social worker saw a 10% tantrum (almost wrote Trantor?) and said it wasn't normal. He's now evaluating whether or not the abnormality is the source of him changing his mind about being a parent. We discussed the issue of prenatal impact and average kinds of babies he might receive as a foster parent; it will be challenging if decides to go that direction. It does look like Raylan has been a profound hell. I am confused now about Rebecca's perspective. I'm missing something important here.

He's going to write in a wordpad. Cool. I looked for timeline software that didn't ultimately just hide data and force you to rely on software ecosystems (I'm tired of my data being too "stuck" in other people's toolchains). Once that thing starts to get large enough, he's going to start breaking into pieces and structuring it (if he's really using it). The bigger project, the more necessary it will be to move to a tool that is not one giant flatfile. Again, I recommend Tiddlywiki. I usually hear it's a lot of work. I think the sooner you take the plunge, the better. I will continue to point folks to tool I think is best (if I found a better tool than TW, I'd use it).
