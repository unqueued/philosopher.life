I think I should start writing more on my offdays about my work as well. Remember, I'm trying to play life like a video game, and video games are 90% about thinking, planning, and practicing. The actual play is oddly secondary when you are meta enough. 

I only wanted to say that my brother JRE sent me a gift. It was very thoughtful of him. He sent me a digital protractor. It has good magnets, it gives accurate readings, +/- 0.2 degrees.  I will use it as a level, for 45's, bevels, and especially for special rolling offsets. It comes with a belt loop holster. I don't think I'll be loaning this one out, or I hope I won't feel it necessary.
