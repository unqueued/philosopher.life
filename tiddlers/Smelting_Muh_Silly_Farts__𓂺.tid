There's an old saying that goes:

> Those who plant dates don't harvest them.

That is because it takes date palm trees about 80-90 years to bear fruit. They plant trees whose //shadows & fruit// they shall never know.

There was once a young man (from Nantucket) who met an old monk planting dates, and he asked the monk:

> Why are you planting dates when you know you will not harvest them?

The old man replied with a //kind// smile on his face:

> My son, go eat a fat dick, this is my yard, and I plant whatever the fuck I want.

!! If you could get all your life's farts out in one go, would you?

This is a tough one. I was born to fart, and I savor them. They are important features of my life. The loss of pleasure in my [[4DID]] from never farting again would be incalculicable. Eyeballin' it, I'd say I average 15 hedons per fart, and that's right below a drink of icecold water. Of course, felicific calculus belongs to the living fartgods among ethicists.<<ref "d">> I've failed to deliver a meaningful argument unless I can show my math to these superior mathematical analcysts of [[The Good]].

[[h0p3]]'s average fart utility rubric:<<ref "c">>

* Intensity: How strong is the pleasure?
** 3/10. There are spikes in here. Some farts will give me the willies, a tingling sensation, pumping an extra teaspoon of blood into my wiener.
* Duration: How long will the pleasure last?
** Depends on how many people are with me, the context, pre and post fart math is complexified by so many factors. 5 seconds, including the breathing period seems hedged-conservative here.
* Certainty or uncertainty: How likely or unlikely is it that the pleasure will occur?
** I'm 99.999957% confident it will occur, baye.
* Propinquity or remoteness: How soon will the pleasure occur?
** Despite decades of empirically modeling chemical reactions in my meatsack, I'm not confident in my ability to determine when it will occur with any accuracy until I detect its imminent emission.
* Fecundity: The probability that the action will be followed by sensations of the same kind.
** I can often gauge this on a per fart basis. Does it feel like I've got one more round left in the chamber of my assgun?<<ref "pb">> Then, I have the chance to practice farting on command (one of the most noble skills I've ever seen in homo sapiens).
* Purity: The probability that it will not be followed by sensations of the opposite kind.
** This concept is incoherent. I'm dismissing this vector.
* Extent: How many people will be affected?
** To my understanding, all farts affect everything in their lightcones. [[The Dialectic]]al straw-broke-the-camel's-back properties of farts are far reaching indeed. They induce butterfly effects, cause Black Swan Events, reduce entire kingdoms to rubble, rescue fair maidens, and free parasitic worms from their hosts. I'm so sorry: I have no idea how to calculate this one, my dudes.

Alright, so upon closer inspection, I've sniffed out what my eyes missed: clearly, it's 16.532 hedons per fart. This is tremendous.

~~Napkin~~ Toiletpaper math adjusted for my extra fartiness suggests this would be a 15-20 day fart. Obviously, diminishing marginal utility dumps a lifetime of pleasure straight down the gluttonous one-shot toilet. It's going to be difficult to understand if the one-shot fart's utility is going to really be worth more than standard fart distributions. I've some basic logistics and health questions which must be answered too.

I've heard I can sleep through my farts, but I'm extremely worried I wouldn't be able to sleep through a constant blasting fart. People who try to go without sleep that long are fucked up for the rest of their lives. So, you'd need to be able to assure me I could sleep just fine (even if via medication). I don't know how the constant flow of gas through my body would work, but I have a hard time believing it would be safe. Can you guarantee it would be safe?

If my health would suffer from the inability to fart, then probably not (though I can imagine cases in which I ought). From what I understand, holding in your farts will cause those bastards to go in other directions. I do not understand the implications of never farting again enough either. Can you guarantee there's no downside to getting the fart out? 

My farts are often a deliciously violent affair, and there's going to be a bodyload which requires more endurance than any other event in my life. I don't know if I have what it takes. I think this requires serious training. I probably need a month to prep.

This would be the most epic event in human history, of course. I think it would need to be recorded.<<ref "w">> We definitely need to monetize it. It needs a real media campaign, slogans, merch, the werx. We'd need to capture the fart not just as a livestreamed event extravaganza, but lots of [4k, slowmo, and amazing sound capture] for the [documentaries, interviews, porno-parody, and so forth]. More importantly, we need to physically capture the fart. I'd need an assembly line of golden-trimmed transparent Trump-cannisters to store them, tiny monuments.<<ref "l">> Auction that aerosolized shit off. Fart proceeds should generally be donated to Debian.<<ref "g">>

!! Principles:

* Should I wax? Hair is a serious problem, and I don't want to start bleeding. Marathon runners have serious concerns about their nipples. What about my rosebud being torn like tissue paper? 
** If I don't, and the dingleberry accumulation becomes too great, it might form a seal that would cause me to explode. As much as I want it, I'm not ready to die!
* How often must I lubricate my crack during the event?
** Who's going to lubricate it while I'm sleeping?
** Crisco, please.
* As I get older, I find more oily discharge and the risk of sharting increases 10x. What do we do with the splatter?
* I generally take a shit at least once a day, and that must not be impeded. That cannister needs to be airtight sealed on me, and I'd like music to drown out the sloshiness.
* What does the bed/chair design look like for this? 
* Will I need a doctor's note to do this at work?
** This is going to make one-on-one's turbly difficult. I already have difficulty maintaining eye-contact.
* How many hands will I need to shake? How many babies will I need to baptize? How many breasts must I sign? How many toilet-paper rolls must I bless?
* Will this be the sum of all of my farts rolled into one as a back-to-back sequence? Maybe we need a laser show to go with that kaleidoscope. 
* I'm thinking there are people who will want to have sex with me during the event (and there's no fucking way I'm going to last 10 days without an orgasm, literally impossible). Maybe we need a queue. Are you into that, ^^ladies^^?
