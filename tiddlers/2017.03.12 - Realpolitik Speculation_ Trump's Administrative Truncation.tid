title: 2017.03.12 - Realpolitik Speculation: Trump's Administrative Truncation

When Trump won the election, he spent an enormous amount of time and energy vetting and interviewing people for his administration. He clearly cares about who he works with, who works under him and making sure that the executive branch falls in line under him (which, in a sense, is fine). His choices have been atrocious, as expected. What seems surprising to many people is the number of vacant positions that Trump has not filled. There is a standard administrative body we see in the executive branch (which has been expanding in power term after term). Trump is breaking from the tradition, as I pointed out: [[2017.01.31 - Realpolitik Speculation: Open Shadow Government]]

Trump is following Bannon's advice in deconstructing the executive branch's administrative and internal political structures. This means less transparency and a greater degree of centralization of power in the hands of fewer people. But, this is also an absurd application of "minimalist" state Libertarianism where it obviously doesn't belong. Let us be clear, this is not cleaning bureaucratic house. This is artificial truncation, and it allows him to sabotage significant governing requirements he does not favor. Without the political structures in place, no one will do the work. It's actually kind of mad genius. It is a deep freeze on select executive functions of the government. 

Trump is dismantling oversight and functionality he deems unnecessary while centralizing the power he cares about in the hands of capitalists and alt-right advisers. The goal is to destroy the people's state (whatever appearance of it was left, at any rate) while putting his cabal of friends in charge to enslave and exploit the world as much as they possibly can. 

It feels like fascism and fleecing.
