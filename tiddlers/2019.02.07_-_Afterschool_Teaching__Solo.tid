title: 2019.02.07 - Afterschool Teaching: Solo

I was the only person, period. Lol. I had resigned myself to running the office and managing all 4 grades at the same time. I can do that, but it requires keeping everyone contained in the cafeteria. Just as I was about to announce my plans, I saw Mitchell show up. He was in a meeting. Cool.

I took everyone to Baines' room, and some of the 8th graders kept back in the cafeteria with 9Tm staying with them (their preference, obviously). 

Figured out why Baines is so reasonable: she's new. She was the math teacher replacement. Ah, that bright-eyed idealism. I still admire it. That's ultimately at the heart of my skepticism; reality doesn't match up to what I know it could possibly be.

Whitney came in late. Dentist appointment. Sonya also showed up. It's a good thing everything looked tidy and people were doing their work. 

I do not inspire people, and I'm not a fun teacher. I don't hand out the answers or play games, I don't coddle, and I don't value most of what they identify with. Further, I'm just not extroverted in the standard sense, and that is entirely what is rewarded. These poor kids, lol. I think the 5th-grade boys especially hate me, but tough titties. I want you to get your homework done kid! Some of these are on the edge of outright failing. 

I guess part of the problem is that I think an "A" just isn't enough. Who gives a shit about the approval of this institution as it is? I get why people can have a reason to hate school, but these kids hate learning. They are boned. I will continue to calmly present my perspective with the prediction that few will ultimately take me up on it. [[Hope]] is slim.

5NP2, 5BG, and 5LL were little shits today, as usual. 5LL's mom is more openly recognizing that her son lies to everyone including her. Of course, it is our fault. =) 

Lots of people out and sick still.

By playtime, it was a madhouse. We were locked out of the gym, fields outside, and the lab. They were all in use. That relegated us to the library and some kids wanted to paint. I took them to Baines' since I'm not going to fuck the carpet up. It was wonderful to have the kids paint. I like watching my kids make art too. They used the smartboard to make art as well. 8Gf and I had an in-depth conversation about social media. She has the right instincts that one does; she just can't articulate the principles which match them. Clever girl. I'm going to empower her with all the weapons she needs if I can.

I've been prying into their lives about their computer usage. Precious few have a computer, some don't care, but the smart ones wish they had a computer at home. Those who come with me to the computer lab on the regular are the most likely. I must teach my children hao2geek.

It's interesting to see that many of the kids know I'm listening and let particular things fly. I give them a blankly amused or inquisitive look in some contexts. The oldest kids, however, are actively more secretive in general. Makes sense.

I continue to give the "according to what I've been told, these are the school rules" whenever I'm asked for permission to use the internet. Many have realized I don't give a shit, or they don't give a shit if I do, and both are fine with me.

I saw Mitchell play the field today against parents. Aye. I can see how that helped him acquire his position
