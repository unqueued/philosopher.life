I love your vanilla letter in trying to be normal but also a link to your true one because that is who you are :heart:ðŸ¥° donâ€™t stop being you

Thank you. =)

Do you think this maximizes my odds of getting the job? I think the odds are very low no matter what.
MON 12:47 PM
I hope they give you an interview. They would truly be missing out if they didnâ€™t. I think your letters will you show you to be a great candidate

(Also, [[k0sh3k]] said she'd be getting in touch with you; today's her first day back among the living)
MON 1:21 PM
She chatted with me some yesterday which was great! I look forward to talking with her again when she has time :blush:
MON 1:21 PM
So glad she is feeling better â€”undead illness is so not pleasant :female_zombie:

MON 1:23 PM
Discord allows me to edit. Can't have everything I want.
MON 1:23 PM
Hehe no idea either â€”some times those bugs wait until a less convenient time to appear
MON 1:24 PM
That is in the back of my mind. I'm paranoically thinking about blowing my nose: oh, noes, is it coming for me too?
MON 1:24 PM
Clorox everything..
MON 1:25 PM
That is work, and that is too smart. I am opposed to such things.

That is reference I haven't seen in a long time, a long time.
MON 1:34 PM
