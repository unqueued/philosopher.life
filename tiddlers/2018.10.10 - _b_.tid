[[Sphygmus]] has left her brainstorming and drafting in the open for me! It was a pleasure to read, and I'm now thinking. Also, [[kickscondor]] responds to my drafting, and he does so knowing my words are tentative (hence I think he's exceptionally charitable in how he interacts with it), and I'm grateful. I think it's awesome they feel comfortable responding to my drafts.

I feel uncomfortable responding to drafted words (even though I know Sphygmus would trust me and know I'm trying to be charitable; I'd rather be hedged-conservative in how I handle it). I want to give [[Sphygmus]] as much as space as she desires to build what she's building without saying "you committed yourself" to this. She trusts me, and I never want to violate that with her by failing to be charitable to her words.

Alright, that wasn't expected, and it doesn't exactly belong here,<<ref "w">> but I don't know where to put (almost [[/b/]] territory...no, fuck it. This is [[/b/]] territory.) SNIP.
