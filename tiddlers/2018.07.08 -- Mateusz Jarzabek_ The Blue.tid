Hello,

I've been reading through HN comments and I found your website. 
Thank you for creating it. 

I've started reading through it and it feels like somebody else took time to write down many of my own thoughts. 

Thank you for making me feel a bit less lonely in this world. 

Matt

Hi Matt,

It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm glad you found my site and reached out to me. It can be a very lonely world, and I aim to make friends with the other nomads I meet. One of my axioms is to [[Find The Others]], and I hope to build a real relationship with you. Someone who has taken the time to empathize with me deserves my empathy too.

I'm glad we share many of the same thoughts (maybe I'm on the right track!). Would you mind elaborating on what you are thinking and feeling in particular? What struck you enough to take the time to send an e-mail to me? I'd like to better understand. Also, have you considered writing in your own wiki?

Sincerely

[[h0p3]]
