** ML for IPD problem
** My usual paranoia about the centralization of power
** Alphastar
** Dasein, Pure Phenomenology, and what it means to be the kind of agent which recognizes itself as [[4DID]].
*** [[Gradual]] remember a particular IPD between it and one opponent, but it does not remember for any other interactions in a tounament round against the other players, nor does it have an ability to make inferences about emergent agents, and more problematically, it cannot plan who it will be in the next tournament given information about the current (though that might be emulated in some respects, including the seeding).
** Curriculum Design Bidness idea
* Porkchops, sweet potatoes, carmelized onions, tea
