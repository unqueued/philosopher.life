title: 2018.07.17 - Prompted Introspection: Procrasturbation

!! What about a goal makes you most likely to procrastinate?

Fear of failure, uncertainty, self-doubt, goals which require high executive functioning, goals which are somehow not in alignment with my identity all the way down, goals I'm not resoundingly committed to, goals which I don't trust myself to eventually accomplish, marshmellow tests and delayed gratification extended too far for my foolish mind to agree to act upon wisely.
