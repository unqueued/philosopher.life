title: 2018.07.03 - Prompted Introspection: Thankful

!! What are you thankful for?

I'm thankful to have a reason to live. I love my family, and I do care about my life. I hope to never forget it, denigrate it, or lose sight of it. I hope to wield that purpose wisely, meaningfully, without reserve or fear. I hope to turn my gratefulness into something which makes other people happy and grateful as well.
