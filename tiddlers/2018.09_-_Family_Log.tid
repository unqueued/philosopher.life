!! Audit:

* Lots of sleep problems. The adults are a mess on this point. Both children are feeling the heat.
* My writing continues to decline.
* Depression is obvious.
* Still a struggle to get our children to try.
* I think we all felt really beat down this month.
* The largest redflags are mine.
** Gotta say, this does coincide with my lack of cannabliss, but I'm not convinced that's the problem. I know it helps, but I should still not be feeling this shitty.
