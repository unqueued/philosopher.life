title: 2019.06.25 - DeathOfRobinhood:

//May the Good of all that is Right and Beautiful be exalted. We are grateful The Light enables us to perceive the world. May our words and meditations satisfy the conditions of our purpose, and may the blueprints of The Kingdom of Ends motivate and form the pattern of our conversation.//

Dear Ivan,

I feel fortunate to hear from you again and again. It is my honor to engage in the sacrament of conversation with you, nomad. I've been jotting thoughts into this letter, mulling it around, painting and repainting it for months now! You asked me several questions which required my digestion. I assume it must feel a bit like a giant pause in the [[hyperconversation]], and I'm sorry if it's awkward. I have felt the weight of this letter; it is among the heaviest I've written on this wiki.

I appreciate that you aren't worried about it being sophisticated or having me spend too much time in it. [[IA2DYJ]] and be content with my effort, to see moral merit in my interactions, and to maintain justified integrity (which is not to say I am succeeding or will).<<ref "iw">> I'm still figuring out what that consists in. I'm not used to writing letters all that much, but I'm hoping practice will [[ltf]] and make it one of my stronger social habits. So far, this letter has felt like time dilation in Eve Online. On top of living the life I have, communication has slowed down as there has been much to think about. 

<<<
Dear h0p3,

I've been looking forward to this reply and appreciate the thought you put into it. 
<<<

That warms my heart to hear, and I appreciate your reciprocation. Not everyone takes the time to write letters, especially not to random strangers or even a pain in the butt like me; I [[hope]] the practice spreads like wildfire. It is something missing in our virtual world. The cost of committing oneself to such a transforming task is among the highest I've encountered.

I'm grateful you indulge this ⦗👉 ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°⦘👈 feeble clownfool in dialectic.<<ref "cf">> Whatever is left of trust, authenticity (whatever it means), genuineness, and sincerity during the pomo apocalypse in [[The Great Human Conversation]]: you are bringing it. Thank you for keepin' it real and wandering the desert with kindness. I could only [[hope]] to find more [[Humans]] like you. I looked forward to hearing from you too, and I still do. 

<<<
I don't have any formatting preferences.
<<<

Your e-mail is well-formatted, and I don't think I [[do it justice|IA2DYJ]] here. This may need to be something I put more thought into.

I like the plaintext look too (I try to let the words and links do the talking), but I also want to do your voice justice (plus, it's fun). In case you ever change your mind, the offer stands. I will make whatever reasonable accommodations I can.<<ref "ac">>

<<<
> One thing stands out to me: you are an artist. I am still not sure why I tend to connect with artists (usually my personality is considered deplorable among the artists I've known offline), but that is one of the few threads you have in common with the others I have the opportunity to speak with in depth.

That's funny - you're definitely an artist yourself.
<<<

Well, thank you. I hope to be a useful, impactful, and talented artist like yourself.<<ref "n">> Assuming I live long enough, maybe in a few decades, this pile of mine will be worth thinking about more generally. Sometimes I think of my delusional ravings and artful narcissistic avatar as a spiritual trufe bomb or a dialectical ball of lightning I'm throwing at the world. Of course, I'm probably just a retarded prejudiced keyboard-warrior arrogantly trying to take over the world.<<ref "p">> XD. Yeah, I've got a ways to go, lol.

<<<
 Maybe what your installation does is filter out the elements of your personality that some artist-types find abrasive? What kind of people besides your family and friends do you tend to get along with out there? 
<<<

This term "installation" is wonderful. It reminds me of my [[RGM]], our computing practices in the house, the ways in which my family's wikis have transformed us together, and how this horcrux-pensieve has been such a moving artifact in everything I do and all the relationships I have (which is hardly to say I've done it well). It's an installation alright, perhaps an invasive one: sometimes a black dropbox. However, I don't think it does much filtering of my abrasiveness so much as it gives more context to it. When I'm openly engaged (you need to know me pretty well offline) and not holding back, this is what I sound like in person too. It is rare that I get to say what I actually think. Who would want to hear that? Lol.

I do my best to accurately represent myself in this wiki. The artists on the wiki seem to handle my abrasiveness and extreme disagreeableness well enough; it probably requires a high-tolerance to differences in some sense. I have found some people tend to drop off fairly quickly with me, understandably: I have the tact and finesse of an asshole,<<ref "cu">> I seek precision and possibility where others find it absurd or lacking (what they refer to as) grace, and I'm what most people consider overly concerned with moral accountability down to the detailed threads of the fabric of our lives.<<ref "lo">> Out of the gate, I assume people do not find me worth their time and energy (or worse), and you and [[others]] restore my waning faith in [[hope]] for [[Humanity]]. Sometimes I'm just a mean old perfectionist gom jabbar;<<ref "gj">> you continue to demonstrate you are the rare credit to our species. 

I try to radically invest myself in the people who interact with me. How else should I spend my life? Unless I'm [[smalltalk]]ing, joking, informing, or learning (and not usually even then): I tend to be overbearing, insolent, judgmental, and demanding in dialectics. There are arenas in which I give abnormally little space, and I make you walk me through every single step. I'm paranoic in how I aim to detect [[sociopaths|Game Theory Agents]]. I'm like the vigilante sovereign citizen<<ref "sv">> freespeech fascist testing people for [[The Golden Rule]]. Privacy is a difficult right to exercise with me. I'm a challenging person to deal with because I demand everyone tell the truth as best they understand it; I am on a mission. I aim to show what P2P friendship, integrity with enemies, and epistemic humility look like (which, again, is hardly to say I'm successful in these practices). We live in a low-trust society where I predict the majority of my interactions with humans to be failures at some level which require me to be on guard. It's hard to be realistically hopeful without being naive; some [[dok]] of happiness are the result of holding particular delusions in one's context.

Indeed, my respect for identities, including emergent branches of possible versions of my identity(s) at any given timeslice in my [[4DID]], comes in a wide range.<<ref "rn">> There are many places where I do not respect the beliefs, feelings, and desires of others (including other versions of who I have been or could be) which they find unbearable (though I aim to be painstakingly justified). Horrifying to many progressive constitutivist neo-Kantians, I make the distinction between one's constant 'moral worth as a person' and one's variable 'worth as a moral person.' I take people to task for who they are and how they represent themselves. I see accountability where others do not because I see radical freedom in our identities which most aim to ignore (it is why I like you so very much; this is no mere game<<ref "ct">>). I think Hanlon's Razor is the [[psychopathic gaslighting|Memetic Warfare]] variant of my axiom: [[Virtue is Knowledge]]. I'm the asshole who will openly express the [[dok]] to which you are evil to the best of my accountable, transparent knowledge (with my skin in the game from the beginning). I self-righteously hold most adult humans I meet in quiet contempt and eat them alive. I agree that psychological egoism is a fitting description of most humans I meet, but it is never the prescription: we are free to be [[good]] persons.<<ref "gp">> Lifelong friendships of mine require a paranoic openness to being wrong all the way down, and I bend over backward to put my own mutable perspective on the line in [[T42T]].

I'm not convinced the wiki is a significant filtering mechanism on myself exactly (though it gives me a chance to prepare my expression and digest) but rather a distance or space in which we can all reason asynchronously, often embroiled in multiple simultaneous conversations with my premoves and hopefully some memetic scaffolding set in advance for a rapid mindmeld.<<ref "cl">> As usual, there is too much emergence in [[hyperconversation]]s for me to easily give a clean account (though I aim to do so in time); it is easier to show than to tell yourself, especially with two or more hyperobjects of discourse. Of course, it has other properties, for example, I have a chance to transparently wrestle with a number of sociopaths on this wiki which I'd otherwise not be in a position to do offline. Maybe that is the point though, and I will continue to think about how this medium is or shapes the message. I also like that the wiki gives me a chance to communicate my insanity without unfairly putting someone on the spot to some [[dok]]. I can't communicate my point of view in person to most people very easily unless they have traveled similar paths in the desert or have practiced speaking with me significantly. My offspring and my wife decode my compressed idiosyncratic abstractions fluently (a sentence goes a very long way with us); the wiki gives someone a chance to engage in that practice, imho.<<ref "ds">> Letter-drafting, particularly with our radical information asymmetry, likely saves us both time in the end, as iterations give me a chance to unpack my suitcases and connect dots that would normally take longer for me to recognize need connecting in the conversation, and the wiki aids in making it otherwise high-bandwidth and crawlable (if any, I don't know which links or searches are going to be useful for you).

So, to your question: I generally don't get along with people unless I am not openly myself or my interlocutors ever so politely ignore who I am. As you no doubt can tell, I'm a deeply flawed, paranoid, and fucked up person. You'll find most will not speak with me beyond [[smalltalk]] (though I think most people primarily engage in smalltalk). It takes an extensive attention span, focus, and perseverance to build a relationship with a 4eak like me. It is rare that someone doesn't eventually experience bad vibes from me or find me horrifying (and even rarer that people maintain a relationship despite those feelings); this becomes more complex in discourse in which I challenge others, sometimes by forcing others to look in the mirror by drawing up illustrations for them, mimicking semblances of themselves back,<<ref "ti">> or more often by argumentatively flipping the switch at every turn toward a reductio (generally with material leftover to help us build something else). Some change their minds about me later, but most don't. Being justifiably useful to others is my primary goal, and that often conflicts with maintaining what is standardly conceived of as a friendship. Please feel free to exercise [[The Ol' Yeller Clause]] with me if I'm too rabid.

Perhaps jarringly, I am willing to openly burn bridges where others wouldn't, but that's part of what makes crossing them so meaningful. My paranoically charitable hyperreligious perspective and seemingly imperious assertions of what I take to be my moral rights and obligations in my context combined with my unpredicted sticky, rabbitholing, and looping viscosity in both verbal and hypergraphic conversations (some of my conversations take decades) make it appear like I'm a devious ambusher, epic grudge-holder, appalling rhetorician, dogmatic fascist, and sadistic interlocutor. Even as a madman, [[IA2DYJ]]. Pursuits of truth and honest existential wrestling are gorgeous exceptions I encounter with [[others]]. Despite being what most people call insane, clearly, I'm lucky to have some absurd people who speak with me consistently and long-term; they likely hedged-[[love]] me far more than I deserve.

I don't feel like I'm an effective guide, but I try to be useful to people I interact with; I'm trying to meet them where they are at. I make for a reasonable study and sparring partner, especially if you seek a deconstructor to throw protons or more complex functions at the image we grow together to light up our interactivity mediated through it. I can be thorough and rabbithole with a [[Straussian]] mindset, which can make me a useful sounding board. Metagamers and I get along well enough. Some people like to geek out with me. I've been trying and failing to set aside mere games for the only one which matters (a recursive problem complicated by the fact that playing mere games is part of playing the one that matters).<<ref "mg">> In a way, I think openly sharing the wiki allows me to filter people. It reminds me of OkCupid hackers who fight to balance the odds men face in finding partners in sexual mating markets.<<ref "rm">> Giving my self-model away freely accomplishes many goals, including changing the odds of finding meaningful relationships and hopefully being useful to others.

As I get older, I think I'm becoming increasingly intimate and alienating (however paradoxical that may sound). My text and meaning are black-and-whiter (with some links and functions, I guess).<<ref "dv">> Even while I am less confident and certain in many areas, there is less and less middleground with me. I get along with the [[power]]less who are doing their best with what they have (those are the people I'm fighting for) and others engaged in the same activity. With these people, I try to listen in silence or ask leading questions. When I do speak, it is to build a bridge in their reasoning by handing them the best steelmanned expressions of their argument I see while pointing out the gaps (and, usually, I think the gaps are tremendous). My children and these people (almost all of whom I will never meet) are the only reason I have left to live on this planet. I await the day that I can be done with my work.

I know it isn't pleasurable to hear it; maybe you'll think I'm evil, radically wrong, or insane for it: I'm convinced I should like about 3% of the humans I get to know. I do my best to [[love]] everyone and their Reason even when I hate their guts (to varying [[dok]], of course).<<ref "ta">> [[ridtyawtr]]. I see the light of possibility in almost everyone, and it is why I hold us so very accountable for not being who we ought to the best of my knowledge and abilities. 

<<<
What are some other threads you find I have in common with the others, or did you mean to imply I was otherwise very different?
<<<

Sorry if I wasn't clear: I meant to imply you are otherwise fairly different, from what I can see (I'm fairly blind). It appears the Judeo-Christian memeplex is part of many of the people I speak with, but you come with a forceful set of tentpegs. You speak words I have once uttered myself, and I am still bound to them. Hopefully, in time, I will be able to show you my family [[tattoo|Δουλος του Θεου]].<<ref "tat">>

Perhaps one of the other things you have in common is that you like to read, and you have the ludicrous patience to speak with the mentally deranged (and paranoic pricks like me who take themselves far too seriously). 

At least up front, you are by far the most dogmatic interlocutor I've had so far (this is not conceptually a negative trait to me, despite the shades of meaning it may have with most people, and further, I'm not saying you are unjustified in at least some of your dogmatism), and you put your faith on the line. You've got all the direct and subtle marks. Your chosenness [[naked]]ly bleeds out of you. I don't have to question whether you put your money where your mouth is, and I know you would die and spend your life for the truth in some of the books on your shelves. I'm lucky to meet you: a man whose [[faith]] I can respect in some of the most difficult contexts I've encountered. Of my interlocutors, I likely have the most memetic material in common with you. Anyone who can point to [[The Good]], as I've written it and say, "eh, that's not so bad," is already much closer to the thing I'm pointing at with this wiki than most. We both aim to build our lives with Jesus' words (though we may have strong differences of opinion on how to interpret those words). While I have only seen snippets of you, I already see Christ in you. Homie, you are in the trenches (and not just in your kindness to a lunatic like me). I'm honored to meet you.

<<<
> Initially, I meant "DeathOfRobinhood." I want to know why you are connected to it and what it means to you.

I came across some art by NC Wyeth while researching children's book illustrators, and impulsively bought reproductions of two of his works online. One of those works was 'The Passing of Robin Hood'. I couldn't articulate what drew me to that painting initially, but having spent more time with it, I sort of feel it signals both my aspiration and my narcissism. I...could say I wish to be some kind of Robin Hood figure...but his legendary aspect is so beyond me, I might instead have identified with him as a sort of tragic martyr (seemed more accessible at the time, which, in hindsight, is pretty disrespectful to actual martyrs). Since acknowledging how I childishly upholstered a heroic self-image via the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods, I held onto the identification because I think it maybe kinda has in it the kernel of a sincere yearning for the Good, however crassly expressed.
<<<

Your story makes your name meaningful to me as well. This paragraph inspired me to be as forthcoming as I can about why you should not like me in this letter. Reciprocal revelation is necessary to mutual witness. I [[hope]] to have the honesty and sincere self-reflection you have here. It is a special thing to dialectically name ourselves in virtue of our opposites, mistakes, or faults. I see far more sincere humility than mere irony in your self-identified image.

Aesthetics and appearance are not simple topics in philosophy and religion. I imagine images must take on a special meaning for you. You are likely more equipped and attuned for this practice than I could ever hope to be.

//related aside: Two nights ago I had a dream where I was some kind of cartoon superhero, along with my girlfriend, doing battle with evil, fighting upon rooftops, and then among the stars. After the laser show, we realized we had mastered the elements and were summoned before a suit behind a desk. He informed us that we were ready to advance to the next plane where our mastery of the elemental building blocks of reality will form the foundation for a new sort of relationship with Creation. Someone suggested that we'd be under the management of an angel named "*****", but the suit corrected us saying we would see God directly. At this point, the tone of the dream changed entirely. I found myself alone with a huge sense of longing growing in my chest beyond all proportion. Tears stung my eyes as I started thinking "I just want to see God. That's all I really want.". Eventually the crying woke me up, but I continued to lie there dazed crying continuously before fully rousing myself.//
<<<

That is a helluva dream! I cannot remember mine so clearly at all; they dissipate so quickly, and I'm convinced my mind's eye doesn't have nearly as much richness to it as that. 

You are not the first to share their dreams and waking up from them with me. I am lucky to hear these stories. I have no idea what to make of it, especially because I'm not convinced we are ourselves in our dreams (perhaps excepting lucid dreaming, but I can't commit to that either). I do not know what they mean (if anything), but I'm convinced they tell us something about the structure of [[phenomenology]] itself and perhaps one's health. So, please take what I have to say as an interpretation of a fictional story about someone else because I don't know any better.

I am reminded of [[Awe]], and I appreciate the goal-directedness of the character. I sometimes feel like someone peeling away layers of reality, much like Bill in //West World//, seeking the meaning of the maze, hunting in the desert for what matters most, thirsting for purpose. I can never be certain, but leaps of faith assume such certainty in their contexts (hence the tentpegs). It has been extremely painful to see that what I once thought was a spiritual experience was not. I feel the yearning of your character. 

<<<
Also, thank you for sharing something about your own irl name :)

There's something sincerely aspirational about the name 'h0p3', though saved from over-sentimentality by a good measure of leet, that feels like it wouldn't be out of place in some updated, ironic-but-not-really take on //Pilgrim's Progress//.
<<<

This line has sat with me for almost a month as well. That is quite a comparison. You are beyond charitable to me, and I can only hope to live up to anything like that. I appreciate how you peel apart my irreverence from my reverence so cleanly.

You come to the table with a mixture of charity and sincerity. I'm going to listen carefully to what you have to say about the concepts. I suppose it's sometimes one of those "I know it when I see" kinds of problems to some non-trivial [[dok]]. It may play a significant role in our discussion of codificationism. 

<<<
> Your father sounds like a man of honor, presumably doing what he could with what he had. I hope to do the same with my own children.

My father was a wanderer who settled down later in life. He was personally disciplined, though relationally easy-going, and he cultivated my interests. He also showed me how to suffer the indignities of loss and decline with humility and resilience. Whatever your challenges, I think kids retain what you did with your bad as much as your good.
<<<

You appear to have the virtuous disorganization and diffuse mode of artists I've met, but clearly you are disciplined in your faith. I suggest you are relationally easy-going as well. I do not know what you have suffered and lost,<<ref "sl">> but I appreciate that your father prepared you for the hardest parts of life. There is a defensive risk-assessment which I admire about that strategy. If I am lucky, I will succeed in teaching my own children to have that disposition, wherewithal, and skill.

It's possible you have more faith in homo sapiens than I do. At least from what I can recall about the nature of human memory, retention and recall aren't shaped by such an objective and fair pursuit of the truth. I am not convinced most children grow into adults who are actually all that thoughtful about these contexts. You cannot deny it, DeathOfRobinhood, you are a statistical deviant; that may show up in your clearer self-reflection upon your childhood as well. I have wrestled a great deal with it myself. Did you know this wiki started as a [[letter to my donors|2016.10.17 - Letter to Mom and Dad]]?

I'm trying to [[Be A Good Dad]]. It's not easy when you are going insane (history is littered with people who go crazy looking at the thing I'm looking at). To various [[dok]], we are each unreliable narrators. My offspring write wikis as well, http://j3d1h.philosopher.life/ and http://1uxb0x.philosopher.life/. I hope to give them the best tools for remembering, analyzing, and synthesizing the narratives of their childhood with as much respect for their autonomy and [[4DID]] as I can possibly muster. It is my goal to have the tools and methods to construct long-term, high-bandwidth, remote relationships in which we can fairly represent the historiographic evolution of how we tell the stories of our lives together. One attribute of your father's I hope to habituate in my character is the ability and disposition to be easy-going; I'm awful at that except with people ridiculously close to me (as in: am I going to try to hug you the first moment and last moments I'm going to see you in a day?), though I'm still bad at it with them too.

<<<
I was being unfair to suggest the writers I meet hate cartoons. The condescending attitude to the material //some// of them hold as they cynically use the gig as a stepping-stone to more prestigious opportunities certainly seems like hate to someone who loves this stuff as much as I do.
<<<

I will be interested to understand your normative interpretation of the concept of cynicism, including how it departs from skepticism. Are you lucky enough to work with any others who love and take their vocations as seriously as you do? I assume it requires a kind of obsession to be as skilled as you are, and, given the competition (much like pro gamers must overcome such a high hurdle because many people enjoy the practice just for fun), I assume you have to be pretty elite to get anywhere in your industry.

<<<
I'd like to think that, as an animator, I'm fairly competent/principled (I'd like to be a virtuoso by my mid-50s), but as a story crafter...I'm still disappointingly amateur. I got gags and novel ideas, and I think a decent grasp of credible human psychology, but my structure is soft and my pacing undisciplined.
<<<

I'd like to know more about the work you do. I don't really know what it means to be a virtuous animator. Has technological advancement started to slow down enough that you don't have too much turnover in your tooling?

Do you intend to move toward writing the stories and perhaps doing it all (or as much as one could; I assume the business end of things is its own maze)?

<<<
I also don't want to give the impression I'm working in an environment that does not regularly require me to compromise (artistically), but in some ways, this too is good as the dialectic spurs me to growth and to a healthy skepticism about the brilliance of my own ideas.
<<<

What artistic compromises have you made in the end, and do you have any you look back on and wish you did otherwise? Conversely, what are you most proud of in your vocation? I know precious little about your process. I don't think I have what it takes to stand in your shoes.

Epistemic humility is a hard problem, and perhaps the root of all problems which are up to us. It's crucial that we have people we trust to help prune and shape the brilliance or self-perceived brilliance of our ideas. I rely on my [[advisers|Offline Users]] to help me compromise (you can tell I'm beyond awful at it), though perhaps not effectively enough (and that also has its own [[infinigress]]es). 

<<<
Can you unfold your question as to the commodification of my voice a bit? I already choose to not take gigs that sell cereal to kids or whatever, but are you asking how my talent has not been used by anyone to assert their own thesis anytime ever? because I'm not sure that's been the case. 
<<<

I agree it is unlikely that your talent hasn't been used by anyone to assert their own thesis. This must be a hard problem for you. It is for me, and I'll probably never be a tenth of the artist you are.

I adore how you ask me to clarify myself multiple times; that is important to me. Alright, I'll unfold it. I was asking: "Do you know why that commodification is evil?". Like a bridgetroll, I was asking you to transparently pronounce שִׁבֹּלֶת.<<ref "f">> I'm curious about your faithful tongue. Those who know [[The Good]] (and hence [[The Right]]) can generally point out the dialectical edges of what it is not, but I am not worried on this front. You have demonstrated you actually give a shit again and again.

You are correct, btw, there is a profound asymmetry in how we get to know each other. As we all do, I have to blindly guess, tease out, and infer. As you can see, I'm often wrong, but it's also something I'm doing with a non-trivial information asymmetry handicap. I am paranoid, prejudiced, and inaccurate as ever, surely. I hope in time, you will learn to trust and forgive me for what may be significant errors. Of course, everyone can appear humble (it is an image we show ourselves even when we sin), and I regularly see figurative snakes of varying [[dok]] in most humans; unfortunately, my suspicious are often confirmed. Though I do my best, it's difficult to give the benefit of the doubt in a desert where the vast majority do not merit it. Your responses, however, have convinced me you aren't a snake. I take my 3% figure (though there are likely communities which break that rule),<<ref "mc">> for adults, seriously, and you demonstrate integrity I so rarely encounter in the world. One question I ask myself: would the world be better off, more coherent, and significantly closer to the Kingdom if this person in question were billions rather than one? It's my honor to meet you, sir.

Locating this cartoon is sitting in my backlog of low-priority side-quests, but I wouldn't be surprise if its eventual discovery is synchronous with some symbolically significant and cathartic life-epiphany.
<<<

I'm moved by nostalgia, but this is so much more than that. I can't imagine what finding that symbol would be like today. I don't think I have any parallel left in my life. I'm weary of such moves because I think they are opportunities for eisegesis; it gets me in trouble especially with those who build their faiths too vulnerably around standard icons or common coincidence.

<<<
May I ask if you have any good material to recommend on autism and the perceived lack of emotional connection associated with it?
<<<

Of course, you can. I'm not an expert in psychology, including autism. Autism is still being explored and defined significantly. My recommendation must be taken with a huge grain of salt. I am convinced there is a great deal more to discover about the nature of the autism spectrum(s). My philosophical study of autism is like a side-quest. I'm happy to field questions as best I can. Some people find me too high-functioning to merit the label (I work hard to blend and codeswitch),<<ref "pa">> but I don't think it is conceptually a disability in all contexts. From what I can tell, you have non-trivial opinions or hunches about my own psychological status, and I appreciate your willingness to explore it with me.

Moral psychology is an area of interest for me because it has strong implications for metaethics and practical wisdom. It's helped me come to better grips with who I am and who we are.

My earliest memory of a drawing I'd made was some kind of flower-headed box that I called a lion. I loved drawing comics and started at maybe five? A lot of it was derivative, either knock offs of what I saw on TV or in other comics. I started making flipbook animations at nine-ish after I took a book out from the library, 'Chuck Amuck', by Chuck Jones, and would study the little Roadrunner antics at the margins of the pages endlessly. I started off with simple two-frame before and after loops, then started making increasingly sophisticated cartoons in whatever notepads/textbooks/dictionaries I could get my hands on. A couple years later I discovered Jasc Animation Software which lead to my first foray into digital cartoon-making.
<<<

I like how cleanly and far back this narrative goes for you. That is such an existential gift. My memories fade and fragment, but yours stick together into an elegant sequence. I only ever watched animations, and you were actually making them from such a young age. It beautifully screams purpose. Have you been able to keep any of the work you made back when you were so young?<<ref "tl">>

How much of your process is done analog these days? Do you sketch on paper for prototyping before moving to the digital workstation? I would like to understand your workflow and how you reason about your job. 

<<<
How about you? Were there any precursors to this wiki? Primitive ancestors? Or was it created ex nihilo?
<<<

Yes. I'm held hostage by my terrible ideas. There are writings I've had here and there through my life, but one strongly stands out to me: I call it the H-book, a pile of filth even worse than this wiki. I started to write it as I lost my faith while in graduate school. 6 years of graduate school in philosophy was a tall task for PK/MK and ex-missionary, and there were some classes I knew would test me for everything I was worth. I was not wrong about that. One of my problems as an autist is the amount of variance in my ability to identify emergence, and this is especially problematic for self-identifying and empathizing with my [[4DID]] (this is a source of my lack of executive functioning, on top of which my actual sinfulness stands so boldly). I have had to hunt for effective means to self-medicate, and the "H" in H-book stands for "Highdeas." 

Only one section of the book was devoted to writing while sober; sober me would speak with high me as well. Always on the Road to Damascus, the beginnings of [[h0p3]] began in that timeframe as well. This precursor includes pseudonymous correspondence with family and friends, journaling, and a scrapbook in it. As usual, I have little of value to say in it. One cool thing I still appreciate about it: I wrote and edited in a different color each time, and kept a key. It's rainbow inside (I like rainbows and bright colors, they stand out nicely for my colorblindness).

Grafting all my old writing into the wiki is in the ol' [[Wiki: TDL]]. Capturing the draft of the book inside the wiki is going to take some work.

Aside rabbithole: not even nothing was created ex nihilo. Nothingness comes from something. I'm an eternalist and essentialist (annoyingly so). I'm a mortal enemy of [[Meaningness]] (though it is beautifully written). Many of the people who seem to find my wiki interesting are fans of that particular family of sites. I'd like to know your take on it as well.

As far as animation I hold in high regard today, a lot of it is the sort of stuff you'd expect, and there's seriously too much to make an exhaustive list. A lot of the generally highly appraised stuff, I raise my horn to (I like that you appreciate The Last Unicorn :)).
<<<

//The Last Unicorn// is special to my wife and me. Plus, it's not some Disney tale with vegetables. While I love animation, I probably only know the usual mainstream stuff you'd expect. I often have no idea how people make animations. It's like magic and hacks to me. 

Some autists are especially prone to watching and re-watching animations. Despite how many people in my life were convinced animations would rot my brain, I would not be here without animation. I'm repetitive about it, but I'm grateful that they help me suspend my disbelief, engage in theory of mind construction practices, offer dojos for training my analytical world-building and affective gut world comparison, and have excellent footholds for memory built into them. Children, and fanboi idiots like me, are especially lucky to have you in the world. I think more highly of animation than I know how to express off-the-cuff, and I hope to reason more carefully about the morality of animation, rhetoric, storytelling, and communications with you.

<<<
A short list of animated things I've followed the last few years accompanied by cereal (which means I'm really indulging myself) include Gravity Falls, The Amazing World of Gumball, Rick and Morty, and Bojack Horseman. I'm not sure the things I enjoy neccesarily correspond to the things I respect or aspire to, but the eyeballs don't lie.
<<<

Lol: the eyeballs don't lie. I've never heard that succinct phrase before. I have such strong feelings about that claim. Mmmm. Thank you for it; it's delicious. I also want to binge cereal and cartoons all day. I like talking about cartoons with my offspring, my public children. This was one of those things with which I connected with the kids in Thailand on too (rice not cereal though). Indulgence, yes, and there's something beautiful and even pure about it in the right doses (which is not to say I have any self-control here, as you can see).

<<<
I'm a big fan of Japanese stuff from more than a couple of decades ago: Rémi sans famille, Gamba no Bouken, Gutsy Frog (the former two directed by genius and hero Osamu Dezaki) as well as occasional contemporary oddball picks like Ping Pong directed by Masaaki Yuasa. Indie directors like Michael Dudok de Wit and Torril Kove, I like to follow. I am continually enchanted by Suzie Templeton's 'Peter and the Wolf'. You ever watch Cybersix?
<<<

I've never heard or seen any of these until you told me about them. Lol! You will need to assume that I know almost nothing. Thanks for pointing out animations to think about; I am in your debt, unfortunately, I have no idea how to repay your kindness here. Also, I cannot say I see the common threads in these (which is exciting), but I have not studied them. 

For an untrained eye like mine, dat Ping Pong series is the standout toon here. It's screamin' off the screen. It doesn't even need words to tell the story. It reminds me of some weirdcore my daughter likes too. It's interesting to me when what appear to be flaws or mistakes end up being part of the charm. I'm amazed at the art of adapting the unintentional into the intentional. Plus, I adore literal ping pong, it's gorgeous and a simple-looking dialectic. It's one of my favorite games.

<<<
In the world of art at large, I am not a man of great breadth, but if there is anything your daughter would like to discuss, I'd be happy to engage. A Twitter feed she might enjoy is: https://twitter.com/_ibcf_?lang=en (I certainly do!)
<<<

Thank you! I'm a lost father (as usual). We work to get her books, supplies, machines, and talk with her about art (even though I'm trying to be some kind of artist, I have no idea what I'm doing on that front). I'm an intense father, but I desperately do not want this part of her life to be something I shape beyond simple support and interest.<<ref "it">> Given the opportunity costs, [[Music]] was a giant waste of my life, but I don't think her art is a waste of her life. 

I'm an amateur with [[computers|monster]], and I'm a foolish (mostly useless) fanatic with them. One of the reasons I've not too strongly pursued working with computers for a living is that almost all the people I know who work with them for a living end up not wanting to use them outside of work. That is absolute madness to me. I can survive without my computer, but I could not imagine having this techne fade or ripped from my identity. Perhaps hypocritically, I force my children to rapidly learn and construct with this tool.<<ref "tt">> I pick my battles with my offspring. I cannot, however, tigerdad my daughter with [[her art|http://j3d1h.philosopher.life/#Gallery]]. I'm deadset against the possibility of snuffing out this flame and flair for art, and I may not touch it. I can only observe and cherish it with her, but I may not metagame more than is necessary for us to be minimally practical. 

I want her to adore it because she adores it, wherever that goes.

I found //When Helping Hurts// useful, but I have difficulty identifying interesting points of discussion that don't relate to specific applications of its recommended best practices. The best practices advised are certainly very good (avoiding paternalism, identifying the assets a target person or group already has, locating the person/group on the timeline of need), but I'm not sure what a discussion would be like (I've also never been much a of a Bible study guy, heh).
<<<

That makes sense to me. Despite practice, I can't say I'm much of a Bible study guy either, but I've not found many settings where greater than where 2 or 3 are gathered which remained meaningful to me outside of a standard classroom or entertainment. I'm a peer-to-peer kind of guy in the end. Video games are like that for me too. I much prefer meshes of small numbers, as I spend large amounts of emotional energy to deal with large crowds.<<ref "x">>

<<<
I'm about to pick up //Friendship at the Margins// as recommended by Craig Greenfield, a servant whom I admire, and I sense it may have more of the narrative and theoretical accents that make for a more natural point of conversation. I could very much be wrong, and if your research on WHH leads to determine it's a book you'd like to read, I'd certainly be open to having that discussion.
<<<

I am going to wait in part because I've been flooded of late, and I'm not able to commit. I've been failing on the reading front. That is a topic I'm interested in though! I'm also prefer to wait for you to recommend the book first, especially because it is going to be an emotional rollercoaster for me no matter how we slice it. I am rough with [[authors|JASG]] and [[speakers|2018.10.19 - Jop: Continuing]] admired by many of the Christians who are close to me, and that may not be something you want either.

//The Lost World of Genesis One// was good fun. What is your wife reading these days? Right now I'm just about half way through //Decoding Nicea// by Paul Pavao, which I'm finding very engaging.
<<<

http://k0sh3k.philosopher.life/#Books has her current reading list. I can appreciate the appeal of //Decoding Nicea//. It's a vast topic, and I know too little of Jesus becoming God and the evolution of this memeplex.

As usual, where I have failed in reading books this year, she has succeeded. She reads a decent variety and large quantity (particularly during time periods in which we don't watch any shows or movies). Sometimes, she is like a walking encyclopedia, and it's very fun to talk about some of her books with her. She reads differently than I do. She is the charitable constructor of almost all authors, and I am the mean deconstructor: it's a solid combination. She builds images in front of us, and I shoot them down until we have an alternative image that is more secure, coherent, or hilarious. I prize her ability to make leaps with me, to fill in all the dots that I forgot, to fill the world in, especially when she helps me destroy and reconstruct my own thoughts. She is my thoughtpoison and antidote.<<ref "wl">>

I see you're kind of a D&D enthusiast. You ever play Baldur's Gate? I had a narrow gaming selection as a kid, but still, this was a title I replayed way too often in proportion to what other activities were available to me at the time.
<<<

I'm a terrible D&D player; [[I play as myself in every character|https://www.kickscondor.com/normality-rpg]] as though I know I'm playing in a paranoically fictional narrative which objectively matters in the real world. I'm a metagamer more than a gamer. I like thinking, talking about, planning, or watching D&D more than playing it. Baldur's Gate is a classic I've never touched. I have read about the game, and it looks intense. I have played the mindless skinnerbox versions of Baldur's Gate (the Diablo series), but I have never been much of a quester or RPer. Even in Everquest and WoW, I avoided it. I prefer the ludology to the built-in narrative almost every time. It's not that games don't serve as rhetorical devices in which we tell ourselves the stories of ourselves, it just that direct story-telling mechanisms of authors don't tend to click with me. I must be doing something wrong.

That must have been a helluva a game to play as a kid! I had to fight to have the chance to read or play games which had any serious RP elements to them in my household until we were older (like pornography, D&D was the kind of straight-up evil activity that would have gotten you kicked out of the house).

I hope you don't mind if I sort of desync our conversations from here? I'd like to address the more theological/philosophical content in a separate email to keep some level of brevity and to allow our exchanges some thematic breathing room. The conversational streams may, of course, cross or split again in the future.

Thoroughly enjoying this,

Ivan
<<<

Excellent idea, yes, please sync and desync the conversation at will. We have to peel apart and synthesize ourselves again and again. That's the only way this can work, I think. Pick out the [[salient]] threads for us, sir! You are equal in the dialectic, and I must connect myself to the words you pick out for us. It is trust in the shaping and metashaping of our [[hyperconversation]]; it is justice as fairness. I beg you to practice [[The Golden Rule]] with me, and that means holding me accountable.<<ref "tw">>

I save quotes inconsistently, scattered across paper journals, Notepad.txts, cellphone photos, and random pieces of paper I'd thoughtlessly dumped in the recycling bin. I'm terribly disorganized.
<<<

At least you record it. I've done a bad job of it for most of my life. I have too many sections of my life which I can no longer see. My memorabilia is an image I cannot trust. I still feel the same way as you do (you can tell that even if my attempts at organization, I'm still somehow radically disorganized). Eh, I'm still learning.

I bought an i386 for $10 at a garage sale when I was 16 while staying in California for a summer. It was a retro experience (back to when I actually used these machines as a youngster). I fooled around on it, but I also collected quotes on it which were eventually transfered and lost among muh floppies. I've had paper journals. I've tried just a bunch of text files. Nothing has stuck with me until the wiki. I still have junk strewn about everywhere in my digital identities. One day, I must comb through them to integrate into this awful beast. I am not looking forward to it. It's been on my [[Wiki: TDL]] for a while now. My wife is thinking about how to do the same.

<<<
The first entry in my current journal begins with a quote from Jane Austen's //Persuasion//:


>    "...they all went indoors with their new friends, and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think of accommodating so many."

I adore that quote. That is part of the spirit of the law of ancient hospitality. It reminds me of an important book in my childhood: //Always Room for One More//. It is one of the inspirations for my [[Find The Others]] {[[axiom]]}.

By my precious numinous/voluminous claim, I simply meant that God is not better understood through an excessive expenditure of words.
<<<

Oh. `/paranoically peers over the edge of that cliff`. Umm ... Wait, you can't really mean to jump off this thing, right? ლ(ಠ_ಠლ). Hear me out first, dude, just in case I've misunderstood you.

Are you sure? How did you come to understand this again? Do you really know what those words mean? Do you understand the price of these symbols? Surely, I do not. Given the radical ramifications of this provocative thesis, I suggest it merits profound exploration, honing, and resolution; I assume that must be your intention here. I hope I am not putting words into your mouth, but (as you know) you have uttered a redflag with me.<<ref "sq">> I appreciate your simply going out on a limb to state this ''bold'' claim. 

`/bow`

I will agree there are contexts in which uttering more words is not [[salient]], qua lacking fitting [[beauty]] or [[right]]eousness, and I aim to describe and preserve that with you as best I can. I also recognize it is possible you understand far more about God, understandingness, language, the kinds of creatures we really are, and the world than I do. So, please tell me why. If you could be more clear about what you mean by this, I might be able to understand. What makes that true? Why are you justified in holding that belief? What is understanding if it is not through some sort of language? What is that which is rasterized into your [[phenomenology]] which conceptually cannot or ought not be described in a language? What is not a vessel of meaning? What cannot be reduced or translated? Tell me what is signified by //The Word//, sir. It's hard to say, I suppose. 

Yes, proselytizer, I have heard your fideistic words before, some more extensively than others. If excessive is by definition vice on the virtue spectrum, then, of course. Granted! It is not so easy to pick out what counts as excess, and the same for deficiency. It is my experience that homo sapiens tend to viciously favor deficiency to excess here (though you may be an exception) which is why I find myself advising us to overshoot the golden mean toward codification. Generally, I see humans who prefer sentiment to the expensive publically computable cognitive workload I'm pointing at. It's far more energy-efficient and convenient for our predictive modeling to take up this prescriptive quietizing skeptical thesis. DANGER, WILL ROBINSON! 

If what really matters is so basic that you can utter all that need be said about it in a few words, then please, tell me those words. I've been looking for them my entire life. What do you think is so [[salient]] it needs to be understood by everyone yet can be abbreviated, unqualified, and merits no radical intellectual exploration? What is [[good]] universal, basic, [[antipleonasmic]] philosophy which need not be fleshed out in language much further?

We can never completely name [[The Infinite]] with a single finite word.<<ref "s">> In fact, we can never name anything related to [[The Infinite]] (which is everything) all the way down as finite creatures. Picking out what is [[salient]] with the virtuous perception particularized to one's context is a recursive problem into [[infinigress]]. I agree, we only arrive at a probabilistic lossy compressed abstraction, an image, a representation of the thing-in-itself. It is our risky plight to name "The I Am," //The Word//, The Original Self-Namer, as well as the animals in the garden as best we can. I do not deny [[faith]] is at the bottom and top of Wittgenstein's Ladder, but I have high demands on how we pull mystical rabbits, absurdities, and justifications for quietism out of the epistemic hat. 

I am concerned that epistemic sentimentalism devolves into mere subjectivity. We are linguistic creatures, and that includes our faiths and wrestling. Problematically, I'm not sure how else to fairly and kindly resolve fundamental disagreement about our emotions, desires, our trained System 1 fastminds, and qualia beyond this reflective equilibrium based on Reason. I have seen the dangers of showing without telling in many contexts.<<ref "ra">> I target both anticodificationism and circumlocutory rhetoric as far as I can. It is one thing to have personal [[faith]] (everyone does), and it is another to have a publically defensible one.

We have very quickly reached this point of contention I hold with most humans. I aim to make or break mystics in this space.<<ref "ef">> My pluralism is limited, and I will not accept relativized "this is what I feel" from those who are unwilling to go all the way down in expressing and defending it as the ground of all being. Translating the feeling of the ineffable into words is the price we must pay not only with one another, but also with ourselves as [[other]] over time. Even though it is not the fastest way to persuade or come to understand, it is often the only way to respect [[The Other]].

Most resort to quietism with me, but to that extent, these enlightened monks have a restricted right to participate in political discourse or social life with their egoistic, privatized point of view. Unfortunately, I'm convinced we are morally obligated to participate barring some exceptional reason, which, ironically, one would usually need to be able to account for (there is no escaping the fact that we must use our language as wisely as we can to engage in [[The Dialectic]]). Like everyone else, you are going to have to give me reasons and signals to trust what's inside your black functional beetlebox; understanding ourselves, each other, and [[The Good]] will always be an unending empirical and linguistic enterprise.

I'm straight-up mean about all roads to non-cognitivism. I'm hoping you will be able to forgive me in time for my violence. I am forced to use unreason with those who do not respect Reason enough.

I suggest we are both broken babblers in this space (and, it's fair to say, I am far more broken here). I admire your conviction. Yes, I'm trying to speak about the ineffable with you. I'm a wild, discombobulated animal compared to you here; you appear far more stoic and accepting of this problem than I do. It's not easy to balance or express to anyone, including ourselves. I appreciate your absurd generosity with me. There is something right about what you are pointing toward, but it is not simple; more importantly, in public discourse, we must draw those quietist linguistic_thought-terminators carefully. Yes, I trust your gut instincts and black box in places I do not with others, but our windowed language game is a trust-building exercise which generates public evidence. Faith without explicit reason is as dead as faith without works; the intention of reason-defined intentionality (being toward [[The End]]) is essentially one of the uncounterfeitable fruits of the spirit and an indispensable type of dialectical building-block.

<<<
One of the more ridiculous books in my library is this huge tome on the Sermon on the Mount by Martin Lloyd-Jones. What the gospel writers saw fit to condense into a quick maybe 20-minute read, is not //necessarily// better understood (in the way it needs to be understood) by being teased apart with its elements rigorously defined.
<<<

That is a fascinating claim. It almost sounds like bibliomancy to me, and I think it's fair to say this is //The Great Awakening// sort of language. I wish the "do what I mean" and [[The Truth]] particularized to our contexts were so simple. Even the Two Commandments I still hold run deep and wide, seeping into the cracks and details of everything I see. I must iterate over and continually reconstruct that supposed 20-minute read to grow and hermeneutically circle or spiral my understanding.

There are, of course, contexts in which it is not necessarily better to continue reading. I can give some quick, contrived, ad hoc examples to show that it isn't conceptually true in every case in all possible worlds. I agree to that. I'd like to see you unfold when it is necessary and when it isn't. What are the ways in which it need be understood? 

I don't know how much theology or biblical studies you have under your belt. You clearly like to read, and I'm convinced you know it is generally necessary to continue reading. What I see is a sprawling memeplex of progressive revelation since the beginning of the oral tradition (and arguably before). Even the gospel requires a lifetime of study and practice. Maybe that book on your shelf isn't necessary for you, particularly if you've found the same or better outside it, but I think you'd agree it can be fitting for others participating in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. I'm convinced your pursuit of what matters most will always require you to sign and interpret that which is significant again and again in reconstruction. 

Note, of course, how rigorously defining the [[salient]] elements allows one to have a concept of [[The Good]] which is more transferable. It goes more places.

<<<
To the extent I am speaking from an unacknowledged anti-intellectualism, I am impoverished. Maybe you'll prove me wrong. I also don't want our discourse to become a burden to you. 
<<<

I appreciate how you do not want our discourse to be a burden to me. You aren't a burden to me, though it a heavy letter for me, and I'm slow. It is my privilege to engage in discourse with you.

I don't believe you are really anti-intellectual, nor do I think you are impoverished in this regard. You are obviously smart, and your point of view is no accident. We have some crucial disagreements I am highlighting. It is difficult for me to gauge how strongly you stand on some of your claims. It's not my intention to waste your time or pointlessly grandstand. I'm drawing lines as brightly as I can for you.

You may see me the other way around here, like maybe I'm some ridiculous Spock-wanna-be or someone who turns his nose up at his limbic system too easily. It's not going to be easy to convince me to be less intellectual about my [[faith]]; it is exactly what deserves the most scrutiny. We're in trusting trust territory, and I aim to be confident in the depth of my Bob turtle. I seek precision here, even at the cost of concision.

Unfortunately, I must be annoying or worse to you on this topic. Most romantics are horrified by my position, but I think it's fair to say I regularly run into this issue with most people I meet at some point. For example, I'm fine with trying not to be excessive with words, but then you will get a very compressed claim. I look at [[Love]], [[Phenomenology]], [[Power]], [[Awe]], as being fairly technical and [[antipleonasmic]]. Unfortunately, there are moves in there which aren't going to feel justified or explained unless you've studied how those words might map onto something much larger. 

Here is where you may need to go full ad hominem on me (I've got the words around here somewhere to help you). Perhaps you need to tell me "you just don't get it" or worse because my vicious disposition prevents me from seeing (let alone fixing) it. The virtuous agent //just knows// in their heart of hearts, right? The mystic is fine with not explaining at some level (at least temporarily), but where will we draw the line for justified mysticism, especially when we are obligated to provide public reasons? 

A proof is a step-by-step demonstration that one set of propositions is the logical consequence of another. Proofs are contextual; they ought to be particularized to the audience. I'm sure when you speak with an audience of artists of your caliber, you get to tell stories and use some fancy words, abstractions, and idiomatic libraries which compress and pick out what is [[salient]] to those fluent in the language with energy-efficiency and increased computational safety. You get to rely upon your audience's ability to make virtuous inferences which usually can only have been acquired through habit and experience like your own. Similarly, the mathematician's "left as an exercise to the reader," is sometimes a high barrier to entry. 

We're playing a language game right now (though not a //mere// game at all; this isn't some useless performance). We're building proofs in a lossy way. Unfortunately, even under ideal conditions (for the [[fff]]), philosophically, I can never be certain you are following the same rules that I am. Empiricism and continually testing for coherence in our linguistic rule-following is all we have left at that point. This includes our own self-dialectics too; you are telling yourself the stories of who you are, and you need reasons to trust, guide, and justify it.

I think anti-intellectual is a harsh word. I hope to reason about the limits of reason here, and that's ridiculously hard. I think you are too confident in the nature of your evidence. Take a few steps back away from the cliff edges, and I think you are in much better shape.

<<<
Also, I guess we'll get to the question of free will eventually. I sometimes wonder if even the fact of this question was imparted to us by God or the devil. I genuinely expect you'll help me clarify some thoughts on the matter. 
<<<

I will do my best to answer your questions, but I'm not convinced I will have anything satisfying all the way down for you (especially because I'm an incompatibilist). I'm straight-up question-begging our moral responsibility from my [[phenomenology]]; metaphysical autonomy appears to be a categorical assumption for the intentionality I experience (a controversial claim, no doubt). While I find the metaphysics and metaethics of agency fascinating and crucial, I have no satisfactory explanations of the essential ontological mechanics at the core of freewill, selfhood, contingency, change, and non-being. It's part of [[The Dialetheia]] as far as I can tell. I have used reason as far as I can go, but I'm forced to guess which way to go in the desert; these are not small tentpegs to be dropping, especially since they have to be dropped in clusters.

I'd like for a moment, in the spirit of Mark 9:38-41, to pause and worship with you.

> May the Good God of all that is Right and Beautiful be exalted. We give You thanks and praise for the Light You have sent into the world. May our words and meditations be pleasing to You and may the blueprints of the Kingdom form the pattern of our conversation.
<<<

Thank you for your extremely gracious words, Ivan. It's so pointed, it brings tears to my eyes. Your words are exceptionally close to my belief. Homie, you are speaking my language. Preach, yo! I clearly see Mark 9:38-41 in this. Thank you. I see empathy in how you represent my own thoughts to me. Your prayer is more than a recognition of my argument, it points at the heart of everything I [[hope]] to be. While it is difficult to write a creed, especially with a pedantic squabbler like me, I can barely articulate your prayer more effectively to my understanding. I pause and worship with you, and, in the spirit of Mark 9:38-41, I recite your prayer back as best I can.

<<<
You've written (in the Good):

>    The Good, however, generates a subset of itself targeting the finite architectures and contextual particularities of each of our minds. Essentially, there is always a uniquely fitting implementation of The Good for every creature because The Good contextualizes itself. Perfect infinite theoretical wisdom must reduce itself to the fitting finite practical wisdom for mere mortals.

Given that this is true, why reject the contextualized aspect of the Good as it has been given us? I'm referring to your insistent de-personalization of the Deity. If the ideal outworking of the Law is empathy, why do you not empathize with the Spirit whom you grieve by robbing Him of Personhood?
<<<

I think you are the first person outside of my immediate family to have taken the time to engage my writing in [[The Good]]. Thank you. You aim to talk about what matters most with me. I am lucky to have the opportunity to inspect my gibberish with you. [[The Good]], as a tiddler, sits in shambles, and you are exceptionally charitable. Thank you. 

Let's see if you struck true, proselytizer. 

One move available to me, given your interpretation, is that I am //not// rejecting [[The Good]] as it appears to me whatsoever. Instead, on this interpretation, it would be because of my experience and lifelong study of [[The Good]] as it has been presented in my [[phenomenology]] that I'm justified in denying or refusing to take up the personhood of [[The Good]]. Furthermore, given the agglomeration of our contexts into some semblance of intersubjectivity, it appears I'm still justified in holding my claim. It gets worse for this approach when we include the perspectives of a hundred billion homo sapiens who have lived. However, I'm open to the claim most people are simply wrong even in their own context particularized to [[The Objective]], and I'm not talking about simply accepting the bare appearance of the thing-in-itself as it is given, especially because we're doing metaphysics here. 

There is a difference between how it is objectively contextualized and how it is given to each of us in our subjectivity. I'm worried you've conflated them. I also recognize it may present differently to each of us as well (probably conceptually the case). I'm not sure we really agree on what it means to say my claim is true (and, it's my fault for lacking clarity). I'm attempting to reason about how to pragmatize [[fff]] computing about [[The Infinite]] which is infinitely computing itself (e.g. a Hegelian might say: The Absolute must reflexively negate Itself). I see no reason to think that pragmatization is best accomplished by attributing personhood to [[The Good]], let alone is even conceptually necessary (which appears to be the much harder task you must accomplish here). 

Why do you think justified contextualization of [[The Good]] conceptually requires us to commit to a personal God? Why is that an essential attribute of [[The Good]]? Is personhood a better-making property? Occam's Razored, hedged-conservative, epistemic humility in speaking about the noumena is more costly than you imply. You've already granted what is considered inflated metaphysics with me (which is usually the hard part).<<ref "im">> The burden of proof is on you; you have to give me reasons rather appeals to emotion here. This will become more important when we start to hit [[The Dialetheia]].

I think a better argument you should be using against me is the claim that some people are justified in holding beliefs of the personification of [[The Good]] even when it doesn't correspond to the objective truth. In the contextualist "justified true belief" (JTB) tradeoff, I hold justification to be supreme. `/points-to-the-soft-belly` - this is where you need to strike, homie. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this can help you out in particular (since the capacity to provide the explanation likely precludes the disability of meaningfully exploring the opposing point of view), but there are other homo sapiens which it may fit. 



Your best move is to distinguish public and private justificatory reasons.


The tables may turn with this claim. Contextualization here does not imply you've perceived or epistemically acted correctly. There's a trail of deductions to make, one which may hermeneutically spiral. To be clear, I have empathized with your position. I was born into it. I did not take the shift from theism to deism lightly at all; it was world-ending for me. Even still, I am open to the claim we must attempt something like empathy with [[The Good]]. I also argue that [[The Good]] is computing [[Itself]] (perhaps like Saint Aristotle's God), but I am in no position to take up a variation of Saint Hegel's radical claim that the external world (or even just metaphysics or some part of metaphysics) is also a mind. Is it possible? Sure. I am not justified in taking up the belief though.

Standing in my shoes, don't you think it's fair for me to think you've got some balls to speak of behalf of your God? Surely you must say the same of me. How exactly do you know He is grieved again? If you are going to take up contextualization seriously, how do you know you aren't speaking to a prophet in the progressive revelation of your own memetic lineage right now? As you may imply the converse, deanthropomorphization of [[The Good]] may just as well be part of the justified pathing of your epistemology.

<<<
Maybe you do not want to risk building graven images? You've no doubt seen many of those who would be guilty of thinking He was altogether like us!
<<<

Oh, I am radically guilty of this, sir. I'm faced with the impossible task of accurately speaking about The Transcendent. My mind imposes categories on representations of everything in my [[phenomenology]], and I aim to humbly speak about what it means for a thing-in-itself to transcend the categories available to me without denying realism. What I experience is, in part, a construction of my mind, and, of course, that doesn't mean what appears to my consciousness otherwise obtains externally to it in all cases. Humble double is necessary for justified [[faith]] as an [[infinigress]]ive problem. Jacob/Israel wrestled.

<<<
Maybe you distinguish yourself from the simple who believe every word, thus you prudently consider your steps.
<<<

Lol. That is quite a line. Am I supposed to imply the inverse? Let me rehearse that: "Maybe you distinguish yourself from the ivory-tower skeptics who are certain they can reduce God and faith down to a mathematical equation or deny His existence from what they call some amalgam of pure reason or empiricism, thus you prudently leap off your non-cognitive cliff." Fuck that. I don't think either of these "maybe" lines charitably describe us. There's more to both of us than that.

[[Arrogance]] is not a simple problem. I try to be fairly empathic here since I was brainwashed, I've been incredibly gullible, I've been self-deceiving again and again, and I fail all the time (I mean: have you seen this letter?). Part of my belief that most people are evil boils down to the fact I've seen they aren't interested in justification; I would know: I'm profoundly guilty. Scaling our moral responsibility in our epistemology is a hard problem. 

Prudence would not be the word I'd prefer to use. I have a specific notion in mind when thinking about prudence in epistemology. I seek alethic justifications over prudential wherever (oh, yes, the circularity gets ugly:) reasonably possible. You are correct: I'm trying to be careful. I have made so many errors in this space.

<<<
Your doubt is rooted in good.
<<<

That is exceptionally high praise. I hope to always live up to such a thing. Sometimes carving the negative space out of the marble slab leaves me the positive sculpture. Those who doubt have some conception of [[The Good]] by definition, though they may be wrong. There's a way in which the possibility of doubt and belief (as well as their dialectical relationship) are necessarily rooted in [[Good]]. Without a doubt, without doubt, there is no possibility of intentionality in how we reconstruct our epistemologies, make judgments, and interpret our [[phenomenology]]. 

<<<
Your moral receptors are sensitive and functioning, but what to make of your divine prosopagnosia; your inability to cry out "Abba! Father!"?
<<<

ROFL. Right back 'atcha, kiddo. //Good God//, you are here to play ball, proselytizer. Alright, I suppose this letter needs more posturing and [[villainous|Villains]] monologing, so lemme bust out muh sick kar-ah-tay cranekicks for ya.<<ref "wa">> It's on like donkeykong now. Them is fightin' words, homie; are you prepared to eat or die for them? Get your dukes up, Durden. I adore how you know that not all perspectives are equal. I am grateful that you take the time to point out my inabilities. There are many. I warned you upfront, my friend; we don't have to do this. Despite my usual retarded condescension and gratuitous pursuit of violence, I aim to harmoniously resolve our disagreement without having to kick your ass, sir. The difference between us feels so minimal to me; must you press this button? 

If it matters to you: I did cry out. And, I cried out when I saw the futility in crying out. It was my [[faith]] that led me away from my faith. I think you see where I'm at right now far better than where I've been here, nomad.<<ref "tc">> But, it's fair to say I'm still crying out in this wiki.

Moral receptors are divine receptors, and vv.; we're doing moral philosophy right now. That's exactly what [[The Good]] enables: perception of anything at all, intentionality, a being toward a unified [[gfwiwcgws]], and awareness of the sufficient reason all the way down into [[The Dialetheia]]. We hurtle inexorably toward it (which is not the claim we recognize or arrive in any satisfactory manner). But, if you really think you see The Face more clearly than I do, then I've some blindsighted questions which need reasonable answers, master. I beg you decode the mysteries for me.

So, tell me, angel of Ehyeh ašer ehyeh, what is more worthy, good, and divine than [[The Good]]? My debt to you would be unpayable. I believe in the divine beyond compare, but why should I believe it is your God which is The One? Tell me why the Judeo-Christian God, in particular, is the only and necessary answer. What makes The Bible and your strain of that memetic tradition objectively authoritative? Why should we think everyone else is wrong not to believe exactly what you do here? Why should I think you see what comes out of that blinding light any more clearly than I do? Lastly, proselytizer: why does your God allow evil in the world? If you have an ounce of the integrity I had, you'd be scared shitless to answer those questions with publically verifiable reasons. I know you can't answer those questions. I'm not saying you aren't morally justified in your Christian faith, but I am claiming you do not have the moral right to proselytize as you have thus far. Your private evidence does not have the public weight you've implied it does.

As you were worried, having done it myself again and again, I think you've constructed an image of God in your own likeness; I don't think you've really reconciled what it means to say [[It]] is The Transcendent (and you must say the same of me). It's time for you to start putting your skin in the game now. Choose your words, tentpegs, and weapons wisely, sir. Private non-cognitivism and quietism masquerading as fully functioning public justifications must be punished. Failing to justifiably codify your apologetics with publically verifiable reason is evidence of sophistry, hubris, and egoism. If you really think it wise, if this is the price we pay and path we have to go down, then lay it on me. I'll hunt it down in you, if that's what you are really asking for. I'd much prefer to dance rather than brawl.

I suggest it is worth tabling this discussion until you have digested why I think we don't have to fight this one. Aren't you the least bit curious how my wife and I get along on this one? You don't have to lose limbs in this guillotine. I suggest there is still profound compatibility available to us. Disagreement here is an ethical one we can more gently resolve, and given what I understand (perhaps poorly) about you, I don't think you have to pay any major price for it. 

<<<
> If you are interested in telling me, [[W5H]] did you convert?

I was baptized in a Catholic church as a baby and attended a Sunday school at a Presbyterian church until I was ten or eleven. My mom came from a Christian family (her grandfather converted in China) and, growing up in Malaysia, she and her large family were often helped by a local Presbyterian group, leaving her with positive emotions towards the denomination. I think it is important that I don't neglect to share the generally favourable Christian context I grew up in, even if we weren't actively practicing for many years.
<<<

I'm grateful for all context you provide me. It is important to see why we have the emotions we have, especially since part of our disagreement may be concerned with sentimentalism and the role of reason in [[faith]]. I also have no intention of neglecting what was favorable about my Christian context growing up, but my home is very messy and cluttered (it takes some hunting). I don't have a full account for you, but I'll start where you do.

I was baptized at 8 by my male donor in one of his small country Methodist churches on a circuit in KY (my female donor had to travel considerably further into the woods for hers).<<ref "bap">> I lived 500 yards from it in the parsonage. It was completely funded by two families who had their wealth due to growing tobacco and illicit substances (helicopters flew over our houses to burn crops on various property lines), reinvesting in real estate, and constructing competing lumber-based manufacturing facilities which exploited the poor. They were highly influential, it was a good ol' boys club, and one family even got in trouble with the FBI for stuffing ballots. 

Having been a heavily practiced PK my entire life, my exposure would make any honest person fairly cynical of those who claim to be Christian. Looking back, I admire how some people fed children food and visited shut-ins. [[Saint Laura Holmes|2019.02.12 - Prompted Introspection: Lulu]] was a Christian woman I've been so lucky to have met, unlike [[some others|2019.03.02 - Prompted Introspection: Mrs. Cox]]. I cannot unsee the [[beauty]] of what made her [[right]]eous; I could only [[hope]] to live up to her, to pay her back, and to live with that much integrity. I still see Jesus Christ in her. She blinds me.

I wish you could have met her.  You have the biggest shoes to fill I've ever witnessed in my life, sir. If you are so lucky, whose gigantic shoulders do you stand upon?

<<<
In my early teens I started reading Naomi Klein (No Logo and Shock Doctrine) which lead me into anti-corporatism, and then eventually Zeitgeist-ism.
<<<

Zeitgeist may be an important word for us. I find myself in many contexts, each with their own norms and intentional tendency of being toward some set of goals. Do you consider this a "when in Rome" kind of notion? Must it sweep the herds and masses? Do you think there are justified instances of zeitgeist?

<<<
I developed some contempt for Christianity, which I associated with Bush-era American imperialism, and, being a mystic, viewed the Yahweh of the Word as a sort of usurper of the Goddess of the Image's proper place. I didn't actually know any earnest believers to measure my impressions against except for one bible-thumping con-man who I only met infrequently.
<<<

My contempt wasn't so much developed toward Christianity in the beginning. As a PK, I was privy to the lives of so many families in a way the average person does not access. My contempt for Christianity has developed in virtue of contempt for self-described Christians and people in general. As an autist, I have a difficult time generalizing without an excessive number of particulars. It has been a horrifying [[redpill]] for me. I may be a bit older than you, as my wrestling with American imperialism and political questioning began with the Clinton-era, though the Bush-era was a profound confirmation for me. Living in KY during the Bush-era, help me begin crystallizing who the humans around me really were though. Where I lived, you could not participate in public life without at least signaling you were a Christian of some sort. 

Earnest believers are difficult to pick out. Some of the most earnest believers I know do not have the faculties to follow my arguments. However, they are obviously doing the best they can with what they have. 


<<<
When I was 21, I found someone on Youtube making a positive case for Christianity, and because he seemed both thoughtful and sincere, I was intrigued. I was familiar with the basic doctrines already, but the internet opened up an avenue to explore the personal consequences of the faith in a way I had not seen before.
<<<

I agree the internet is fantastic for this. I should warn you that academic Christian work still has not be digitized effectively, and they milk intellectual property. Exploration through the leet work is going to require access to paper material. We can, of course, dismiss the relevance of that work. I am fine with taking Jesus' words extremely seriously.

<<<
I knew enough at the time to realize that 'belief' in something must be grounded in something that was demonstrably plausible, and that it ought to have consequences in the way I ordered my reasoning and practice.
<<<


<<<
I also can't deny the role emotion and fear played in moving me in the direction of belief as I found myself increasingly worried that if anything like the God of the Bible existed, my current lifestyle choices were not aligned with Its principles. I wrestled for months with unease until I gave up one night, face down in my room, and spoke with the God Jesus presents as 'Our Father', asking me to take Him as His own.

What followed were weeks of a sort of disorientated joy. Circles of love for others were being drawn increasingly larger, habits of sin (traditionally defined) were violently rooted out of my life, and then commenced the beginnings of a pattern of prayer and answer.

Obviously the issue of cherry-picking for my bias comes into play here. I've certainly had many unanswered prayers, and there are many ambiguous situations I may well have interpreted in favour of theism.<<footnote "foot" "Early in my faith, I was looking for other believers, since I had no Christian friends at the time. I met some guys my age at a church and was invited to their place. On my way there, in the metro, I was approached by guy named Vito; unremarkable except for hisbrilliant sea-blue eyes, telling me I must be filled with the Holy Spirit (with little preceding context). After a short exchange where he pressed this one idea, my train came, and we split. It was the highlight of my day because hanging out with those Christian guys afterwards was so so disappointing! I don't want to rag on them too much, they were hospitable, but in pious terms, they lacked that bleeding desire for righteousness and justice. I later interpreted that event as God sending me Vito to present me with the case for a 'higher' life else I be disillusioned with my first social interaction with flesh and blood Christians.">>

But actually, as much as I fear my power to select memories in favour of my bias, I've seen direct answers to prayers often enough that, if I have to doubt, I doubt in the direction of reality maybe being constructed along the lines of some kind of The Secret notion. Which would just be awful. Awful!

> Any story you can tell as a theist I can translate as a deist.

Ok, but why? Assuming you can account for truth-telling, reliability of memory, etc...Why would a slew of personal stories of prayer being improbably answered, sometimes hours later, not count in favour of a listening/responsive deity? I know three ex-Muslims, two who are close friends, whose conversions were catalyzed by visions of Christ. Why pull back the goalposts when a visible emanation of the deity manifests? Yes, a fair coin can land heads fifty times in a row, but what reasons might you have to not check to see if the game is rigged? I'm not asking you to //apologize for contemporary Christianity// sharing milkshakes with Mammon at the Hamusement park, but are there other expressions of the ancient faith out there?

I just came back from the States meeting up with friends from a Christian charitable organization I'm involved with. Some of them are missionaries, others are involved in practical expressions of love which include helping guide sustainable farming development, building safe house networks, and many other good things where poverty forces people to rely on God in ways we rich folk rarely have to, and they tell of ways that He moves and reveals patterns that can't simply be chalked up to good luck or good planning. 

> Every ounce of evidence you have requires no personal interaction; it could all have been set into motion by anything. It appears functionally reducible, and I'm worried it is hubris to think one could see that far into the noumena to know. I don't see why you will ever have public or private evidence of a personal relationship with a theistic God, not even for yourself.

Am I claiming to know that much? My models of the world have had countless re-iterations, and I expect to continue updating for as long as I refuse to prize cynicism. As for evidence, I'm not sure we could even have a real conversation about that as you seem to have rejected the notion of epistemic possibly-ness for this entire category of subjects. If there is no evidence you will ever allow, then I'm afraid I'm just a poor sparrow of the field colliding with your spotless, but closed, window.

> More fundamentally, it is not clear to me that examination isn't a form of engagement, but I'd like to know why you think you are engaged any further than I am

Thank you for provoking me to exercise caution here. I don't want to make assumptions, in my arrogance, that devalue what you've learned and experienced.

I'm not sure the allusion to a linear journey as implied by terms like 'further' are always helpful as they suggest that there is a common route we all take where such measurements are meaningful. Instead, I like to think we're all either oriented towards or away from the Good (embodied in Christ) and that part of our duty to one another is simply to strengthen and particularize that orientation, regardless of our starting point (which could be all over the map). 

Anyway, forgive me for my imperfect addressals. Please don't think this is a burden to me, I very much enjoy it, and I'm glad we're both in a position to respect each other's busy-ness and responsibilities.

In sincerity and brotherly love,

Ivan


One of the things I respect most about you is that you actually care about what eternally matters, and you sacrifice for it.

The binding of Isaac. Abrahamic and Samuel. Sacrificing our children.


* You're one of the few people I speak who are open to the possibility of being a "sinner" in any radical sense, and moreover, you actually do something about it. It's shocking to see.

* I take up what is necessary for meaning. The Christian memeplex has more than is necessary, and it surd-elims too much.
* How do you propose we resolve fundamental disagreement? You agree it is necessary, right?
* You wield the word, but I don't know what you mean by it. It's going to be difficult (perhaps impossible) to define cynicism for me without invoking the notion itself.
* Because we are trying to make inferences about the noumena with phenomena. Intersubjectivity is the best hope.
* I have to earn the right to hold a representation of your faith as strongly as you hold yours.

* I am interested to know what you think of the doctrine of Progressive Revelation.

* If experience is what matters, then you're experience is pitted up against mine. Like Bane, I was born into the Christian life. Do you see the intensity of this wiki? That's been my life from day one. I have visited snakehandling churches, seen those slain in the spirit in many settings, witnessed many accounts of spiritual experience, and I've had my own (including artificially induced experiences). The resolution of fundamental disagreement in perception has to occur through reason, through shared intersubjectivity. It's not that I don't give your experience weight, it's that I don't have evidence to think your experience outweighs mine.



I want to point out some landmines for you with me. 

* Claiming god has a preordained plan.
** The denial that we can wipe ourselves off the planet, that complete destruction isn't possible, or that such a thing isn't necessarily evil...
** You desperately do not want to go down the problem of evil path with me. 


I aim to wrestle wisely with my faith, including with myself and [[others]]. Israel wanders and wrestles in the desert. It is what philosophers must do to escape the cave. Only those born and awoken in the wilderness find the promised land.


Thank you for your radical patience.



You do not allow us to distract ourselves from the abyss, but you do so with a cheerfulness I rarely achieve. I embrace the abyss like any decently cold mystic who surrenders to the fact some dialectical aspect of wisdom is inaccessible to cognition (arguably beyond the fact that system 2 can only evolve and emerge from system 1 as a precursor). Seriously, I have what many consider to be a freezing cold faith, like I'm some heartless bastard who doesn't feel the pull of what really matters most.



Thank you for sending me into a deepthink. I'm grateful to you for empathizing, asking penetrating questions, and allowing me to evaluate. 


Is it about the [[dok]] in which we are the same in our beliefs/desires/perceptions, or really about the extent to which we share a language?

Affection is not the word I would choose: it's not enough. Respect is a far more accurate term. But, I am not a terribly affectionate person with most people, though even my affection is rough or disgusting. I tend to be a very serious man, especially in the threads you are picking out with me. It's crucial that I pick out what I find [[salient]] in you for us. I aim to be gentle to compensate for vices.

Carefully making your comments, honesty, and building your argument for the alien will go very far with me. It is very expensive for me to compute, which is why I ask for high-quality input. Bloodshed can be avoided by ceding ground wisely in epistemic wrestling. Thus far, [[Sphygmus]] has been the most careful interlocutor I've had; I feel the formality in her moves. You feel way more self-taught to me. I keep attempting to draw clear lines for you with me here. I will expect you to front material about epistemic justification (which you have not done yet) if you expect me to wrestle with your words so carefully. Demonstrating uncertainty and especially the limits of your public reasons are crucial duties here.

I also want you to consider the differing responsibilities which might arise from our information asymmetry. You are still massively private in a way. Your skin is not in the game in the same way. Lower the privacy, a radical political [[power]], no doubt, and you will receive very different wrestling from me. I aim to punch up, not down.

I don't know if you've ever seen grapplers practice. There are times where you both throw everything you have, but sometimes when you are learning a technique or how to practically reason about a concept, you go very slowly. But, if you turn up the heat on your training part, you have to expect it back. 

Some of my moves look like mere ceremony. I'm glad you are ready to laugh at the punchline of who I am with you. Sometimes I think you are Daniel in a delusionalion's den. 

You are up way high on a pedestal. If I am wrong, if this is the Halo Effect, then you'll have to help me see you more clearly. You say this is who you are, and you have a difficult line to walk with me. I think it would make more sense to de-escalate with me. I'm going to ask you to make sure your next strike is true, proselytizer. Do not strike me without publically defensible merit. 

I'm not telling you your [[faith]] is unjustified in your shoes (though it may be), but you have not provided an argument which respects the autonomy of [[others]]. This is where the rubber meets the road in [[The Golden Rule]].


Shakin' in my boots as you prepare to kick my ass. Penn and Teller 1,2 ; Rick and Morty class dismissed. Please don't pin me and spit in my mouth.

I assume that our friendship will need to be similar to the one I have with my wife. I hope you will be able to look me straight in the eyes with a smile and tell me I'm going straight to hell. Hopefully, you can flip me the bird and hug me at the same time. It aint easy.


I'm going to request that you take at least a month to respond. I find it highly unlikely that you will be able to digest and fire back a fitting reply here. There's some serious wrestling to do in here. Ask yourself how well I can see you without being able to read your wiki. Perhaps I'm just flat wrong (I'm sure I've made many mistakes in modeling you). I hope you see I am empathizing with you the best I can with the asymmetry of information between us. 

When it comes to positive epistemic commitments, I am a deist. Beyond that, into theism, I'm closer to an agnostic. Yes, I think your position is publically indefensible, and it's egoistic hubris to think your emotions should override intersubjective public reason which can be cross-culturally verified from independent memetic vacuums. I agree you have not just a political right but even a moral right to express the non-cognitive and private reasons for your understanding of the world, but your proselytizing may be a violation of justice in dialectics.  


You may be worried that justification merely boils down to whether or not someone can narcissistically convince themselves that they have some moral right to seek their own approval at the expense of others. The question is whether or not someone can be that [[right]] to say their point of view should categorically (or even with high probability) alter dialectics beyond a normal even vote. What is expertise in wisdom?




I appreciate your epic patience with me; I am an expensive man to speak with (perhaps not worth your time).

Our internal mental states represent the external world. Which of those things in the external world are minds or thoughts in themselves? We can never be certain; this is one of the hard problems. Why should we think our representations correspond to any world outside ourselves? This Cartesian problem has been handled in two ways. Berkeley bites the bullet and denies the external world, claiming there is only thought and thinking things. Saint Kant argues our representations are co-produced by our minds and the world, but he appears to think we can only ever directly attend to our [[phenomenology]]. Kant begins the destruction of metaphysics in the history of philosophy like none other.">>
