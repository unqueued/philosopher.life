title: 2020.01.29 - Wiki Audit: Cross Section

* [[Timelines: More]] is just hiding material which I don't use often enough anymore, or would be something that someone would only need if they were digging. I'm going to maximize usability and picking out which [[Timelines]] are really most important to me.
* [[j3d1h]] and I worked on [[Yearly]].
** Captioned to "Yearly xยง" and aliased to [[X-Section]]. 
** Seemed to click this time. This should make for a reasonable approach to [[The Remodeling]] for the [[Audit]], a process I can do.
*** It should also enable me to see new narratives in the cross sections, to have more landmarks and ties in the furniture of the house, and to engage in spaced repetition.
*** This will also enable someone dedicated to reading the wiki to having a chance to pick it up over the course of a year.
** I adore the macro for opening them. 
** It also enables people to recognize the static/dynamic distinction.
*** System tiddlers are there to remind me of what has changed. I forget all the places that have been modified (lawdy).
** There's still work to do on it: e.g. `20XX.YY - Foobar`
* RSS is closer.
* I'm still not merging public and private wikis. One fuck up is game over. =/.
