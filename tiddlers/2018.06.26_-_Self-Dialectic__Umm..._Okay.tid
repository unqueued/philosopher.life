title: 2018.06.26 - Self-Dialectic: Umm... Okay

At least one of the dialectics from which I arise is found between verbal and quantitative non-conscious selves cooperating together to give rise to my Daseinic experience. I must be quantitatively qualifying myself and qualitatively quantifying myself. The quant "is" and qual "ought" give rise to possibility in my computations. 

Somehow, they speak a language to each other, and we have to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth, latency, security, and trust-building exercises amongst these non-conscious processes. 

I am painting my own portrait of me painting my own portrait.
