title: Music: AI Curation

General AI seems to mean being able to pick out what is salient while only have had a tiny sample size. Somehow, with our innate ideas and conditioning, we can take our more generalized knowledge to bear upon and model the learning and interpreting of new sense data structures arising from engaging in some practice.

The other route, imho, is to be go maximally reductive with our samples. Perhaps we take those mp3's and reduce them to the simplest things we can. They'll be tiny bitmap images of more complex paintings, truly lossy compressed. Does it still retain it's meaning or beauty to us? To that degree, the reduction is working.
