You still up?
OCT 18 12:53 AM
Yup. =)
OCT 18 12:53 AM
Back to my wicked ways of staying up late, lol.
OCT 18 12:53 AM
How are you doing?
OCT 18 12:53 AM
How are you old. Man?
OCT 18 12:53 AM
I am well just spent 2 hours with a convo/argument/threat to leave my wife. (ongoing for 15 years) looking for a point of reference.
OCT 18 12:54 AM
Subject is super light. For us males.
OCT 18 12:54 AM
I'm looking older, though not feeling it yet. Went to the dentist in the first time since before my kids were born. My teefs were okay. I've been writing a long and difficult letter to DeathOfRobinhood (4 months in, lol, he's ridiculously patient with me...it's just a hard fucking letter to write).
OCT 18 12:56 AM
That is not a light subject for me, but I will laugh with you at absurdity if you need me to. 
OCT 18 12:57 AM
I'm sorry that the argument was hard. =(
OCT 18 12:58 AM
I hate fighting with my wife. It's one of the worst feelings in the world. It's gotta be a shit night for you dude. (Tell me to shutup and listen)
OCT 18 12:59 AM
It's all good man.
OCT 18 1:04 AM
I married a woman who wanted sex once a week and never masturbated. And had her first orgasm with me. I thought I was doing good.
OCT 18 1:05 AM
Lol.
OCT 18 1:05 AM
15 years later. It's the same old song and dance. About two years ago I told her I'd never ask for sex again.
OCT 18 1:05 AM
I lied. But very little.
OCT 18 1:06 AM
Now I just don't care. Marriege is strong on both ends and kinda si king in the middle. Bad.
OCT 18 1:06 AM
She knows. I "flirted" with an only girlfriend online and threaten to leave her. She read it. A few years back.
OCT 18 1:07 AM
Best two weeks of sex I ever had. Lol
OCT 18 1:07 AM
She forgets how many many just wanna nut and roll over, I have and always will be a giver. I have trouble until she xums first.
OCT 18 1:08 AM
I guess that's a rarity.
OCT 18 1:08 AM
I think it's simple and funny.
OCT 18 1:09 AM
(fuck your husband more and before his bed time) I guess 15 years later us more complicated..... (same story though). Haha
OCT 18 1:09 AM
That sounds like my wife too. She got mad when I bought her a vibrator (though now,  I simply cannot compete, lol). She considers herself closer to being asexual than most. I don't know how. It's not the same urge for her as it is for me. Sex is important, and I compare it to being a special subsection of skinhunger in general.
OCT 18 1:15 AM
You think she would let you off the hook on that promise?
OCT 18 1:15 AM
I feel your pain. There have long stretches of time without a sex, and that is fucking hell. 
OCT 18 1:17 AM
I have be rejected and turn town for like 13 years. I told her 2 years ago if you want it you initiate. Otherwise, I can take care of myself.
OCT 18 1:19 AM
Didn't change anything.
OCT 18 1:19 AM
=(
OCT 18 1:19 AM
Even with the best sextoys you can find, it's not going to replace having sexing with your wife.
OCT 18 1:20 AM
She refuses to allow me to see woman outside out marriage that are undersexed by their husband's. She see it in her hair chair.....
OCT 18 1:20 AM
I have put a a good faith effor as any many should. I have been with her for 15 years.
OCT 18 1:21 AM
I consider it an actual need, btw (not just a luxury). I don't think you should be held to that promise.
OCT 18 1:21 AM
Only cheating you can call is some sexting.
OCT 18 1:21 AM
Been to counceling and all. On my dime and my request.
OCT 18 1:22 AM
What did your conselors say?
OCT 18 1:22 AM
I started early and had very open partners who would take me back in a heart beat.
OCT 18 1:23 AM
Once she saw I was just a few texts away. It scared the shit out of her.
OCT 18 1:23 AM
I left everything open for her to see. Buds from ex and all.
OCT 18 1:24 AM
Nudes.
OCT 18 1:24 AM
I was a cheater, and I  should do more dishes, and she will love me more. And her love makes her wanna have sex with me. More.
OCT 18 1:30 AM
This is after being with her for 12 years, going thu self help books, marriage books, sex stuff... It's sad but not alot different than what alot of guys I talk to deal with.
OCT 18 1:31 AM
Maybe you can grow a different kind of cycle with her. Maybe it will take time to convince her the need for sex is actually a crucial part of the human condition. Southern Christian norms are difficult to break, and sexual mating practices are protected where they ought not be. Yeah, you are not alone in having a dead bedroom at all.
OCT 18 1:32 AM
I ask my wife for sex every day (which even that fucking miracle would still be less than what I want). If she says no, she will have a reason (sometimes as simple as: "I don't feel like it"). I think she has learned that I will respect those reasons (even when I don't find them terribly reasonable up front) when I see she goes out of her way to have sex with me at a later date (she may even say: "but, let's aim for tomorrow"). We've had to learn a give and take, and unfortunately, I'm a persistent asshole in how I often I ask. It used to hurt way more to be constantly turned down when I was convinced my requests were not being taken seriously.
OCT 18 1:35 AM
15 years.  I was 20 years old when we started dating exclusively.
OCT 18 1:35 AM
10 year marriage. And she can't step up her game.
OCT 18 1:36 AM
I'll wait till Samantha turns 18 and bail. I'm not dumb.
OCT 18 1:37 AM
I am not able to tell you what one ought do here, but I agree that your obligations to your child are tremendous. 
OCT 18 1:54 AM
I'm hoping something can change before that time, but I have no idea what it would be.
OCT 18 1:55 AM
Fall I coming. That us nice
