title: 2018.09.12 -- BAGD: Make Things For Fun

I am clearly failing you again and again. I need your fun to be in making things that matter. Pay the price, endure the pain, work hard to actually build beautiful, interesting, and often very functional things. I'm not telling you to monetize your life; I'm telling you to ethicalize your life (which extends beyond mere utility).

Huge discussion about the nature of post-secondary education run like a business, for the sake of business, etc. Well-rounded educations are dying rapidly. Daughter raised excellent points.

Son took us into a deep discussion on philosophical zombies, body language, and the evolution of language. Socratic method reductio.

I hate the fact that I have no answers for my children. Useful fucking dad trying to be useful on the hardest things.
