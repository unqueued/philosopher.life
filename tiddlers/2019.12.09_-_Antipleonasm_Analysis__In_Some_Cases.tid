!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
; Consilio, quod respuitur, nullum subest auxilium.
: He that will not be counseled cannot be helped.
<<<

That is obviously not true. For example, I'm trying to counsel you about exceptions to your rule here, but u ded, and therefore cannot be counseled. However, I think I'm helping you from afar. Perhaps "will not" here is a choice, but even that doesn't help you. One can refuse to take counsel regarding a task but still receive help in accomplishing it. 

Obviously, there are limits to how one can be helped without counsel. Prepend dat "In quibusdam casibus," and we're cool, homie.
