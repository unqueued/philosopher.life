!! Audit: 

* I can see I'm hypothetically interacting in many of these. Some are to others, some to myself. 
* One fascinating thing that came out this month is that I'm starting to use the new journal entry feature
* As usual, plenty of politics
* I can see much of this content was eventually distributed into the wiki in some sense, especially in {[[About]]}. That's pretty normal. This is a powerful feeder and generator, even though there isn't a ton there.
* The poem is playful. I'm glad I write stuff down like that. 
* Sometimes I know that I will have a tiddler come out of it, so I start a new one so that I can name and categorize it later. Sometimes, however, I don't even want to do that. [[/b/]] is the last refuge in a special way. It's still an outlet.
