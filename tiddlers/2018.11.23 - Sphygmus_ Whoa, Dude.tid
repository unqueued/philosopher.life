title: 2018.11.23 - Sphygmus: Whoa, Dude

1) whoa dude, what happened to the wiki? did you have to revert back a day, or did something mess up with the batch tiddler tool thingy? Some daily logs seem to be missing! (I noticed because I was reading the letter draft this morning and then when I checked again in the evening it was missing and the links were all crazy ahaha)

2) I decided to give linux a try and installed/have been messing with manjaro kde for the past couple days. idk why but I can't stand firefox on windows (visually), but on my linux install it's the only browser I like!<<footnote "vc" "vivaldi is too cluttered and chrome just feels...//wrong//, visually.">> anyway, this means I ''just noticed'' YOUR FAVICON IS ANIMATED WHAT THAT'S SO COOL!!!!! forgive my caps. :) It's such an awesome animation too! ''Wonderful.''
