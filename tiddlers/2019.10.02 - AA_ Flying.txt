I am good â€”finals week and then Fall Break
OCT 2 1:38 PM
And the Dentist today ðŸ˜“
OCT 2 1:40 PM
How are you?
OCT 2 1:40 PM
Time is flying!
OCT 2 1:40 PM
I hope you chill on the break and don't have too much you have to get done.
OCT 2 1:40 PM
I am sorry about the dentist.
OCT 2 1:41 PM
I am scheduled for the 15th. It will have been almost 20 years for me, lol.
OCT 2 1:41 PM
They will remove my mouth, and it will be a blessing to all who know me.
OCT 2 1:41 PM
I'm doing well. Feel useful, having fun, worried about a possible move and the state of affairs, hopeful as ever (you know me ;P).
OCT 2 1:42 PM
Hehe I am sure you are fine ðŸ˜Š I hate teeth pain
OCT 2 1:42 PM
Yep it sounds like a great deal
OCT 2 1:43 PM
No doubt. You are exceptionally aware of your sensations too. It must be killer.

How is cost of living by Yale?
OCT 2 1:43 PM
Higher than here, but if she earns $55k/y it would be the same.
OCT 2 1:44 PM
That is our current understanding, but I could be wrong.
OCT 2 1:44 PM
I'm hoping I would have a better chance at finding a job as well up there.
OCT 2 1:45 PM
Counting all my chickens here, ofc.
OCT 2 1:45 PM
We daydream as we walk or lay on the couch of what life might be like. Surely, the grass is greener, lol.
OCT 2 1:45 PM
That would be very great
OCT 2 1:47 PM
Colder weather but we polar bears wouldnâ€™t mind that
OCT 2 1:47 PM
Close to the beach too, so that would be nifty. With global warming, it will be like living in KY a few decades ago. 
OCT 2 1:49 PM
Nice
