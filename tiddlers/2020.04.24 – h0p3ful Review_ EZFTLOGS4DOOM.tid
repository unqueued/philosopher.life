//You are correct. It is difficult for us to anticipate and predict what will arise out of these [[h0p3ful Review]]s, in part, because we are thinking about an increasingly complex past. That novelty can be extremely valuable to us. It's my favorite part of the evening, one-on-one time thinking with you and your sister. It reminds me of how we have tried to engage in [[Family Time]]. I like just sitting there on the couch, holding hands, talking; the wiki seems to make it an exceptional process during our school evenings too. I'm grateful that you are taking time to think about what this time together means, entails, and could become.//

*[[2020.04.23 – Wiki Review]]
** What new style of note-taking?
*** Ah...exegesis. Yes. I'm glad. This process will continue to evolve. It gets easier in some respects (and, in some ways, it doesn't get any easier). I'm glad you are feeling more confident in it too. You should.
** I understand it's a joke. I gotcha. It is your wiki too. I just want you to understand the implications as best I can (which is hardly well). 
*[[2020.04.23 – Prompted Introspection: Short, too short]]
** I am so grateful that you and your sister just "bang out" the dishes. 
*[[2020.04.23 – TDL: FTLOG]]
** What is FTLOG?
*** Lmao. Would be a sweet log, homie.
*[[2020.04.23 – Carpe Diem: Nothing]]
** You don't think you had a single act of kindness yesterday? lmao. C'mon. 
*** I get that nothing sticks out, in some sense, but surely you aren't claiming that...
**** Alright. Well, just pull something standard out of the day. It doesn't have to be fireworks. Enjoy the mundane kindness too, homie. Mundane kindness is crazy important. 
***** This is EZ for me, noob:<<ref "a">>
****** You made dinner for the family, dude. That is kind.
****** You cleaned the kitchen. That is kind.
******* It's not about whether it feels normal to do this. Even normal kindness is kindness.
****** You were instrumental in interpreting the various states and consequences of the rules in Fluxx (an interpretation that needed non-trivial logic).
****** You were kind in allowing me to wander around the house uninterrupted speaking with [[Charlie]]. You went out of your way to enable our conversation on the phone, even if it didn't appear to cost you much, you paid something to help my relationship grow with [[Charlie]].
******* You clearly do the same for your mother when she is in her meetings. You are extra careful.
******** Hell, you also make sure not to wake me up.
****** You argued alongside your sister for more time on [[Economic Justice]]. That was kind.
****** You worked toward contributing toward our dialectures, making sure you signaled that you were paying attention and being thoughtful in the conversation (a hard place for us), and that's generous. It's kind. Most people kindly pay attention to others like you do.
****** You chilled with us, watching Tiktok vidyas and surfing le meems. There is kindness with your friends.
****** You have been getting all of your mother's work done before noon. That is kindness to her, to us, and to yourself (and, I suggest even [[Humanity]] will benefit from your hardwork).
******* Not just getting it done because you have to, but doing the work in good faith. 
****** You take care of the cats each day (and you're looking out for them). That's kind.
****** You talk with your sister on walks, openly building a relationship with her. That's kind.
*[[2020.04.23 – h0p3ful Review: 90s Party Swagger]]
** I also want you to know that I think most social conventions, sensibilities, and notions of taste are not nearly as relevant as most humans impart to them. 
*[[2020.04.23 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Twain the train]]
** I cannot say I have learned this lesson well enough either, son. I appreciate your generalization quite a bit. It reminds me of what it's like to be born with or given talents, but to not spend them wisely. 
** I will fight back some though: you clearly are reading and thinking. Your wiki has been proof of that too.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 7, draft 2]]
** I'm grateful to have the chance to see this thing evolve. You are doing well, sir. I like how you know to trust yourself, to know that your drafting will continue to improve (enough to be worth your time), that you rely upon reconstruction. It's badass, dude.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Aw shit! Lol. [[Stage4Doom]] got me! LMAO.
*** I undid it.
*** That is neat.

<<footnotes "a" "I believe you are kind because I also trust your moral motivations. It's obvious that you often aim to do the right thing because it is the right thing do, even when it's no fun. You have integrity.">>
