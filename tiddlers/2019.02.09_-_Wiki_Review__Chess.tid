* [[2019.02.08 - Wiki Audit: Lag]]
** They aren't ready yet though. We are running into unexpected hurdles, possibly 5.1.20-oriented.<<ref "2020.02.10-1">>
* [[2019.02.08 - JRE: Loving Skepticism]]
** My son and I talked about this. I hope to be my son's brother one day.
* [[embedded-wiki-hash-sign.py]]
** Hax. Neat. =) -- This project is weird.
* [[embedded-sig-verify.py]]
** Lookin' good. We've sat on this forever.
*** I'm looking forward to the day when my son and I can build real things together too.<<ref "2020.02.10-2">>
* [[2019.02.08 - Afterschool Teaching: Chill]]
** I had a blast teaching chess to the kids. I was surprised by the number of kids interested in learning, and I was even more surprised by who was interested in the first place. I am clearly a terrible judge in too many respects.
*** Maybe we should just learn chess for real. We could work together.
**** No. This is just a game. You have to teach something more important if you can. Even if you can teach dialectics, deduction, empirics, virtue-theoretics, sportspersonship, etc.: chess ain't wisdom. Even if you used [[MTG]] to teach your own chillun, that's because you have the time to cover far more ground and depth.
* [[2019.02.08 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Whosoever Believeth]]
** Edited.
** I feel like I've been getting over the Randian hump lately.
* [[2019.02.08 - Prompted Introspection: Water Incident]]
** Not that I was cool. Oh, hell no. I was nobody (still am :P).
* [[2019.02.08 - Wiki Review: EFF Consuming]]
** Edited.
** Yeah, I've gotta find more ways to practice with them. Classes help, experience cannot be substituted.
* [[2019.02.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: TGIF]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.02.08 - TDL: Groceries]]
** No fruit worth freezing, and I forgot the lemon juice! Lol.
*** That's okay
* [[2019.02.08 - Music Exploration: K's Guilty Pleasures|Music: Exploration]]
** Pretty normal!<<ref "2020.02.10-3">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.10" "Upgrades seem to get harder and harder each year. It's not easy to be idiomatic in TW, docs are pretty awful (imho), and it tends to inspire the idiosyncratic. Extensions and updates don't jive nicely on old, customized TWs, at least not from a skiddie's perspective.">>
