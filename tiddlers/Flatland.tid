Huge intro to the book. I hate to say it, but I'm convinced I already know the major moves. Regardless, I'm grateful for the historical context, and I need to see it with fresh eyes.

The social, political, and religious aspects of the book are wonderful. It's a mock-up, a mockery, and somehow quite serious.

Meh. I take it back. It was initially fun to see the social parts, but now it's just embellishment on top of the visual. I'm going to stop reading the book. I've gone far enough.
