//Welp, we're going to set Goblins aside for a bit to play the [[MTG Deck: Legacy - MUC]] mirror. I think it's a mirror everyone must play to appreciate magic.//

Daughter:

Mull to 2 island, spike, leak, capsize, disk. She goes island. Draw(Island), island. Island. Draw(CS), island. Island. Draw(Island), island. Island. Draw(leak), island. Draw(jace), pass (ugh).

We talked about how this matchup goes for a bit. It's a really different kind of magic. My son is not doing his work. MTG has turned into a distraction for him too =/. That kid is going to sit and rot until he learns to try.

Alright. I need to kill this cycle of magic for now. We'll jump into it again one day when they are ready.
