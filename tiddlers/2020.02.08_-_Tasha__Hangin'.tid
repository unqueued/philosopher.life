Your official!! Lol we waited til the last minute to do ours when we movedü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Feb 8 4:03pm
We went and ate at the new restaurant they opened around the corner. Idk if you guys saw that Auntie B‚Äôs restaurant. They shut down and became the Hungry Wolf. It was tasty. No body in your guys unit yet. They have gutted it though and done 3 weeks of work or so on it. Been quite annoying - all the hammering and chainsaw sounds üôÑ
Feb 8 4:05pm
Must have fully renovated it
Feb 8 4:06pm
We ate at Auntie B's right before we first moved in. Glad Hungry Wolf is tasty.
Feb 8 4:21pm
Sorry about the annoyances. They said they were going to completely redo the place since it hadn't been worked on in years.
Feb 8 4:21pm
Btw, they did not give us any of our deposit back, despite the fact that the mess was in virtue of their pipe bursting in our walls.
Feb 8 4:22pm
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that
Feb 8 4:23pm
How are the boys doing?
Feb 8 4:24pm
Good Esteban got his new position for the city - Matthew is getting ready to go back to dinner to do his annual checkup with his doctors for the epilepsy. But his good nothing wrong that we know of. We are blessed cannot complain
Feb 8 4:26pm
Excellent on both fronts.
Feb 8 4:27pm
Definitely

How is [[k0sh3k]] liking her job and the kids liking the new home?
Feb 8 4:28pm
Job seems to fit her like a glove. I'm jelly.
Feb 8 4:28pm
Likes it a lot.
Feb 8 4:28pm
She's kinda fangirlin' out too, since some of the books she prizes are written by some of the people who talk with her at the library.
Feb 8 4:29pm
Kids are liking having their own rooms.
Feb 8 4:29pm
Can‚Äôt be jelly! Have to be happy for her - you‚Äôll find something faster by genuinely being so! That‚Äôs awesome for the kiddos- that‚Äôs right they each have their own room now?!
Feb 8 4:30pm
The house is just way nicer in general, and they can go down to the store to get what they want and what not. It's different.
Feb 8 4:30pm
That sounds awesome!
Feb 8 4:30pm
I‚Äôm sure they are enjoying it!
Feb 8 4:30pm
I am definitely happy for her. It's been a lot of work to get her to this dream job.
