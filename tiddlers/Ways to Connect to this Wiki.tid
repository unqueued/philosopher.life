!! About:

//In almost all likelihood, if you are here, then I asked you to come here. I must trust you a lot. For the randos: hello!//<<ref "1">>

The world changes faster and faster. I don't know how the world is going to turn out, and so this section will help you maintain a connection to this wiki even through technical turbulence and political turmoil. I strongly suggest using Resilio Sync, especially since you can just bookmark the local index.html file in your browser (it will load almost instantly).<<ref "2">>

!! Principles:

* I hope to make it so people have a chance to connect with me on whatever level they find most comfortable.

The following methods can acquire the latest official version of this wiki:<<ref "2">>

Obviously, this wiki changes. For posterity's sake, transparency, fixing my fuck-ups, finding patterns in my thought, and enabling data science practices in generating and thinking about this wiki, I also keep a //daily snapshot collection// of this wiki. May it be a gift to anyone who cares for it.<<ref "3">> May it be a proof of proofs, another source: of interpreting who I am, for demonstrating my integrity, and of a variety of useful meta-analysis tools.<<ref "4">> 

In order of completeness, the following methods can acquire the daily snapshot collection of this wiki:

<<footnotes "1" "This wiki serves many purposes. One second purpose is a litmus test of the people around me. Those who care about me will care about what I think and feel, i.e. this wiki. Someone completely uninterested in the contents of my wiki, for whatever reason, is not really a friend of mine.">>

<<footnotes "5" "This daily snapshot collection is complementarily duplicated by the deltas in my git repositories. This is also a fine method for acquiring an official daily snapshot of this wiki. Three notes: (1) Only the index.html, signature, and checksum are pushed onto my git repositories, (2) They are not real-time, only daily-snapshots, and (3) This is a third-party proof + backup/redundancy. Clone it in a directory with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/m6ram/h0p3s-wiki`">>
