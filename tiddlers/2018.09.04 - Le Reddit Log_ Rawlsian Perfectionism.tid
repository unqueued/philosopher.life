title: 2018.09.04 - Le Reddit Log: Rawlsian Perfectionism

I can't point you anywhere in particular (although Rawls is discussed often here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perfectionism-moral/). I've met  plenty of Neo-Kantians and Rawlsians offended by perfectionism; I think it's an unpopular view. I hold perfectionist commitments, so I think the most charitable interpretation of his theory will ultimately require some version of perfectionism.
