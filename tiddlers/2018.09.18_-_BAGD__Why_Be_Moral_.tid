title: 2018.09.18 - BAGD: Why Be Moral?

They think my title is: "brilliant basketcase"

My son is always asking the zillion dollar questions point blank (my daughter is sometimes more round about, or she knows half of what I'm going to say and jumps elsewhere into it). If he knew the history of that question, Jesus. How can I condense this much work for him so fast? I can barely even say it myself. This is a shitty wiki.

We rabbitholed so fucking hard, and the great part is that I didn't start it. They willingly wanted to know. Watching my children wrestle like graduate students is this wonderful experience; I do not feel like a failure. Oh, few would even know what they said to each other, it was that well-said. Point and counterpoint, and I can see they have been listening. Of course, it got out of hand. I had to silence them several times to make progress. They did take notes, but we moved so fast, it would be hard to take good notes. It is gutteral training and habituation of our disposition. They have fierce fastminds in this realm. I could only be so lucky to have undergraduates who wrestled like this.

We walked through some of the major variations of that question. My son was fixated on the teleological notions of survival. He sees the Rand-Locke memeplex. What a monster! That is such a dangerous redpill. We talked about material dialectic, about how psychopaths are allowed to take the immoral means that other cannot (and thus sufficiently competent evil agents [sociopaths] have the competitive advantage in all markets). Lots of very cool moves here, excellent examples. I have been pleased that they have something to say!

Moved towards survival of species, tribalism, and finally utility. I described why I felt it was a failure. Utilitarian function's flexibility to be logically equivalent (I am so pleased they have symbolic logic under their belts to appreciate what I mean by semantics) to any other computational theory in ethics, yet it fails to give us the content itself of what it means to be moral, the kernel of [[The Right]]. Onto my shitty position. I am always throwing caveats, "I do know," "I cannot answer that," "I am sorry; you have an excellent question," "this is a guess, and you should attack it," etc. It is absolutely crucial that my children learn to define themselves, I can only ever aim to give them to best god damn headstart into this desert ever given to another human.

j3d1h: "The infinite must be finitified" in our modeling. 

1uxb0x: "Taking a sample" 

Empiricism and dialectics.

We walked through Hegel (like miscreants), Gödel's Incompleteness and Ontological (and why I accept one and not the other), the infinite computing itself, the Dialetheia, Kant's epistemological skepticism (spent a great deal of time on Plato's cave, as always), internalism and external world, finitely modeling (with humility) the infinite, the fundamental connection to the Dao, dialectics, etc. It tooks hours, and they wrestled far beyond their ages.

I talked to my children about the gods among men. I quake before Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and Gödel. I am forced to wrestle with men so far out of my league. I hope they will see my failing and understand.

We talked about Brower's claim that children shouldn't be exposed to external world skepticism (he is an ethicist too). I look at his children and know he has failed. I told them I give them something dangerous. The number of people who have ended their lives looking at this thing is ridiculous. I feel like a mad scientist giving them the most dangerous philosophical substances I've ever encountered. I hope to immunize them against this thing which drives everyone insane.

My daughter shocked some mathematician at church last week by discussing Cantor and aleph null (that was what his lesson had been about at church). I'm creating beasts, I tell you what. How many 7 year old girls in history could follow and create quantified FOL logic proofs in an ivy league school? She may be the first.

Once I can get them to actually read and write at this level, my primary obligation will have been mostly accomplished.
