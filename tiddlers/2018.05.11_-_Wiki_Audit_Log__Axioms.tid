title: 2018.05.11 - Wiki Audit Log: Axioms

Yesterday's plan wasn't the best. I should keep the log in the project's page. I shouldn't break them up unless I absolutely must. So I scrapped/Vaulted what I did. It's cool. I'm glad I'm willing to do that. 

Fuck it. I see it now. I've edited the {[[Focus]]} several times today trying to get it right. I can see that I just need to go back to having a Wiki Audit Log as part of my //Core Daily Requirements//. Good job!

Hopefully I'll stop bullet pointing this log. It needs a standard conversation, I believe, at least in appearance.

I'm working on [[Music: Library]]
