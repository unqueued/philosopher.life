[11:47:15] h0p3: Hello!
[13:38:08] h0p3: I come and go on my computer, and sometimes my messaging can be asynchronous. Please, feel free to leave me a message. 
[00:35:01] h0p3: Hey, you are online again. 
[00:35:41] h0p3: =)
[00:38:05] h0p3: You keep dropping on and offline (within short timeframes too). That's interesting.
[01:08:52] h0p3: How'd you get my key, and why do you wish to connect?
[01:22:33] h0p3: Well, I [[hope]] not to scare you off, [[nomad|FTO]]. I'll be practicing the [[Robustness Principle|kickscondor]] with you, and instead remain silent until you wish to speak. I hope you'll //C// I'm worth speaking with. `/hail`. :3

[02:46:36] My Name is "C": Hi. Nice to meet you.
[02:49:17] My Name is "C": Can you not save our chat, not log it?
[02:49:25] My Name is "C": Sorry for me be online and offline.
[02:49:41] My Name is "C": Can you tell me what are you interested in?
[08:30:24] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3
[08:35:10] h0p3: I'm sorry. I log my communications unless I find an exceptional moral reason not to do so, and that usually only results in a [[REDACTION]]. 
[08:38:04] h0p3: I'm interested in lots of things. The wiki is the explanation I can give for that. I would say technology, politics, my relationships, self-reflection, and philosophy are my basic interests.
[08:38:31] h0p3: How about you? What are you interested in?
[09:07:11] My Name is "C": Can you turn off saving our chat, not log it?
[09:08:21] My Name is "C": Can you turn off saving our chat, not log it?
[09:08:21] My Name is "C": I'm interested in computers, maybe psychology or philosophy, maybe some art.
[09:09:29] h0p3: You will need to give me a sufficient reason up front not to log it. It's unlikely you can. If you are in need of protection, you'll have to tell me why. I do protect some people in this way. 
[09:10:12] h0p3: I think our interests align quite a bit. I'm afraid I know very little about art, but I enjoy it.
[09:54:53] My Name is "C": Can you turn off saving our chat, not log it?
[09:58:39] h0p3: "Can" has different modalities. I am free to do so in some respects, and I'm not free to do so in other respects. In this case, I'm not turning off the log. You need to read what I've written and respond to it.
