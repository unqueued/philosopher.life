title: 2007.12.22 -- Form Spectrum

Defining the World.

Relational definitions of objects through Form-Spectrum analysis.

Time to redefine the word &quot;Form&quot;

A form is one side of a spectrum. There is F-ness and Non-Fness. The Non-Fness is everything that Fness isn't, and Fness is everything that non-Fness isn't. While this semantical claim might not seem valuable, I assure you that such logical claims are the basis of all thought concerning particular objects and things. Form-spectrums are revolutionary in their ability to analyze and define a particular thing.

Plato and Aristotle may have said that something &quot;conformed&quot; or did not conform to a &quot;form&quot;. They did not properly discuss the DEGREE to which something conformed to a form. The degree to which a particular thing conforms is ESSENTIAL to defining that particular thing.

Just take the classic example of Beauty or Beauty-ness. We can say the painting is beautiful, and we mean to say that the painting partakes of the form of beauty. However, clearly the painting could be MORE beautiful, and the painting itself does not define the essence of beauty. We can draw several conclusions from this experience. Firstly, we can mathematically calculate HOW beautiful something is compared to other objects of beauty and, specifically, we can theoretically test to see HOW MUCH beauty exists in an object. How much does it partake of beautyness? This is the degree of beauty as found in something. The second important fact to understand is that: insofar as an object is NOT beautiful or fails to partake of beauty that object is partaking of the opposite of beauty. This, of course, presupposes that for one thing to exist, an opposite of some sort must exist. What is the opposite of beauty? Is it ugliness?...maybe. The easiest way to consider it is:

B
~B

B=Beauty-ness or Form of Beauty

All that is Beatyness is B.
All that is not Beautyness is ~B.

To say somethin is 20% beautiful is to say that it replicates, duplicates, mirrors, and exhibits Beauty-ness by a degree of 20%. What is the rest of the 80%? Well...we know for a fact it isn't beautiful. But, that doesn't mean it is 20% beautiful and 80% ugly (although, this form DOES exist in concept). All we know is that it is non-beauty-ness. This is very broad. Perhaps it is 10% wooden-ness, 5% redness, etc.Â  The 80% is a composition of whatever other forms from which this particular something partakes. The important thing to realize is that the end result composition will add up to 100% of some proportion of form-partaking. I call this the form-spectrum of particulars.

A baseball bat may APPEAR to be composed entirely of wood, but we would be stupid to think that a baseball bat and Wooden-ness are the same things though. The baseball bat has a particular structure and function. Perhaps it has engravings. Perhaps the bat has sentimental value beyond any old woodenness. Perhaps the baseball bat isn't eternal and timeless and exists in a temporal state. These particular characteristics are measurements of other forms from which the baseball bat partakes.

Takes cats form-spectrums:

Non-Mammal-------------------------------Perfect Mammal-ness
Non-Cat----------------------------------Cat-ness
Non-Blackness----------------------------Blackness
etc.

Cat is defined by where it exists on the form-spectrums across all possibly cat-relating forms. I can take Yoda and say he has X degree of Blackness, X degree of friendliness, X degree of Catness, X degree of big-ear-edness.

How Mammally are cats? If Mammalness (the form of mammal) is the object at hand, and we measure the mammality of cats, then we can know the degree to mammalness is composed of catness.

Forms ARE particulars. They do all partake of FORMness right? The degree to which other forms/particulars partake of the form of something else is the degree to which that thing is a form.

The only perfect form is form-ness. All others exist upon form-ness. They are dependant. They can be different, but they still must partake of some other forms to exist.

Existing, truth, actual, and real are all synonyms of FORMness. If it is under the umbrella of Form, then it doesn't exist. Form is the only thing that has no REAL opposite. I can't point or consider anything that isn't under Formness. All truths, definitionally, partake of Form.

Formness-&gt;(nearly) Independant Form concepts (no particulars exist)-&gt;Forms of Particulars

Indy forms would include &quot;beauty&quot;. There isn't some particular thing we call beautyness. And, there isn't some heavenly ethereal body we call beautyness. Beautyness is a pure concept, independant of all particulars and nearly all other concepts. You can describe beauty only by itself (and its foundational forms). Beauty exists upon the foundation of few forms, for example: Formness and valueness (which could be the same thing, I need to give it more thought).

This is a heirarchy of foundational truths by which we can deduce the meaning and interrelation complexities of other truths in the form of form-spectrum analysis.

We need to ask what is Godness (which isn't the same as Godliness)? Godness relies upon Formness and Valueness (co-existing?).

This-scissor-ness. That-scissor-ness.

Subforms are dependant upon other forms. This-scissor-ness relies upon many other forms, thus it qualifies as a subform.

A specific purpose or meaning of an object is yet another borrowing or partaking of a form.

Let us dissect this particular scissor we have in mind (pretend it is in your hand). It is a 30 year-old scissor that has red, low quality plastic handles, the sheers are steel, the cutting blade can cut through 2 inches of paper when 50ppsi is applied at the middle of the handles, but not 2.1 inches at the same pressure, it has a blue dolphin sticker on the outside of the left blade, the joint squeeks at 300mhz, and we bought it for 500$ from a celebrity office-supply memorabilia store because Jimmie Hendrix once owned it, etc. This scissor has many properties and characteristics, perhaps an infinite set of them even. This particular scissor has it's own form. For the sake of the argument, we will call it This-Scissor-ness. If I tried to replicate or comprehend it absolutely and fully, then I'll need to refer to the particular form of this particular scissor. Each new object has its own &quot;this-object-ness&quot;. We cannot understand or know all of this particular scissor without referring this This-Scissor-ness.

However, This-Scissor-ness is not independant of other concepts and forms. In fact, This-Scissor-ness is heavily dependant upon other forms, and we cannot under This-Scissor-ness without considering the many, many forms from which it partakes. The forms of &quot;handles&quot;, &quot;cutting&quot;, &quot;blades&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;, etc. and every single detail and every interrelated characteristic of this particular object must be considered when identifying the meaning of This-Scissor-ness in its entirety. Perhaps This-Scissor-Ness is comprised of 15% steelness. Perhaps steelness comprises 5% of metalness. Then, This-Scissor-ness partakes of metalness as well...We move from very, very particular forms to less particular forms. We move towards higher forms which are less dependant upon other forms. This web of definitional relations spreads far and wide.

Scissor-&gt;steel-&gt;metal-&gt;material-&gt;existing (FormNess)

There are probably millions of tiny gaps to consider in between each of these dependancies. Comprehending the the scissor is a much more complicated process than many would have initially thought.
Forms with EXISTING particulars
Forms without Exant particulars

Formness-&gt;(nearly) Independant Form concepts (no particulars exist)-&gt;Forms of Particulars

Some forms are abstract, but are built upon the foundation of other forms. The form itself, however, is a particular thing (even if it isn't concrete). Particular objects that partake of other forms act as their own form. We can't divide abstract and concrete as if only one exists in reality and the other doesn't. Particular objects are

Generally, the ancients looked at the 'forms' as abstract definitions which were used to describe concrete objects in reality. They treated concrete objects as particulars. These particular objects were not forms, they merely partook of other forms to be defined. Unfortunately, concrete matter was never taken into consideration as defining other concrete matter. This system has a lowest common denominator, but it fails to appreciate a world of value. It does not let us perfectly define a thing.

What is Concreteness?

Notice the difference between the two statements.

All matter is concrete.
All matter partakes of Concreteness.

There is more to matter than just being concrete. The concreteness of matter is merely one aspect of matter. Matter can have value, color, speed, etc.

Cat are Mammals.
Mammals aren't necessarily Cats.

Mammal does not describe the fullness of Cat. Cat has more characteristics to define. Cat is specific. Cat has more definition than just.
