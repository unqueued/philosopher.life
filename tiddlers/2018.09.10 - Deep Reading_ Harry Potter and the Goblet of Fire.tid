title: 2018.09.10 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

What isn't cheated? Ugh. I really don't care about this book. =( It has not stood the test of time for me. Judging is also a sham. Lots of excellent looks into the folly of many things we construct in society.

Snape's Redemption is what the entire series is about for me. I love how we are practically gaslit by Rowling the entire time, how Dumbledore appears fucking irrational and unfair in most of the series for trusting Snape, etc. I legit think the pieces for this redemption can be found in several books (though, I don't know how systematically), and I've not found a major continuity error yet.

I have a hard time picking out places where Hermione does anything wrong. Maybe the last book? Maybe I'm not thinking clearly enough.

The anti-tech aspects of magic annoy me. It feels like a forced device (ha).

Rowling feels mechanical in her mystery-construction on a per book basis (although, I cannot say that at large), and it reminds me of Asimov's style. Sometimes, the pieces just fit too nicely? That's weird to say, of course, since I generally really, really want pieces to fit together. I don't mind the mechanical feel too much (and I adore Asimov). It just feels that way to me.

Sirius is a loose canon. I really feel like him often enough.

AH! I'm glad I'm reading these books again. I've reductively talked about this wiki as a horcrux. I totally forgot (ROFL) about the Pensieve (I have no idea how the fuck I forgot that...I've read these books at least 5 times [the earlier ones many more times]). Considering how I often I rewatch Rick and Morty, this mechanic was loud and clear. Kind of a disgrace, bro.

Crouch is fucked up. The evil in this book is at least more visceral to me. It continues to ramp up.

Alright, alright. The last 20% of this book is actually good. The relationship between opposites, issues of mind and identity, some wonderful philosophical magic, and clearly plenty of ethics. Yeah, yeah. Good. =)

Dumbledore's office is always a treat, but Dumbledore is generally a special affair.

I adore the civility of Voldemort. I have little respect for civility in itself. Civility in context, yeah.

Yeah, the duel is excellent.

The "moment"...not true.

---

Fudge, of course, drives me into a rage.

Mad respect to ~~Gandalf's~~ Dumbledore's honesty.

The Reign of Terror, the Voldemort Effect, ugh, I feel that in my world so strongly. It's too fucking real for a magical world.

Alright, so important takeaway: I really wasn't feeling the first 80% of this book...but the last 20% was powerful to me. I should know better.
