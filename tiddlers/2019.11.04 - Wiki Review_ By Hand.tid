title: 2019.11.04 - Wiki Review: By Hand

//By hand, lol. Been a long time. =)//

* [[2019.11.03 - Wiki Review: Cleanup]]
** Definitely drowning in my work, but I enjoy it. Hopefully, I can iterate enough to figure out how to simplify it.  
* [[2019.11.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Wikis All Day]]
** As always, I adore having the chance to take something they've said and start a real conversation with it. There was a lot for us to think about in everyone's wiki. I'm hoping we can continue to push that direction. 
*** There are activities I've seen which have some similarity, but it's hard to draw a parallel. We simply talk way faster than we can write, and it blossoms differently in person. It was chaotic in a good way (despite being methodical).
**** Some presentation shit, yeah. Dialectures foshizzle. Some creative writers get together thing, yeah. Some club aspect, sure. There's a show and tell component, but we hunt for [[gems]] which spawn rabbitholish conversations.
***** You can tell yourselves the stories of who you are mediated through lots of game mechanics, even cardboard rhetoric, but these story-telling tools are simply more robust, flexible, autonomous, high-bandwidth, and something else I feel like I can't quite put my finger on. It's like playing magic, talking about it at the same time (metagaming), talking about stuff outside the game, but the game just is who we are, and it's bouncing between prepared and on-the-fly dialectics.    
*** I'm lucky that we get have such positive Sundays sometimes. We've had so many which have been hell. I cherish those which everyone enjoys. We remember them both, and the work adds up.
*** We regularly reason about what friendship means through our interactions alongside and through this tooling. It will always be difficult for them to find people who understand them (for so many reasons), and this is a hack.
*** I await the day that I don't lead it at all. I'm just the husk of an autist who listens and tries to keep up (more than the usual). 
* [[2019.11.03 - Prompted Introspection: From The Heavens]]
** That question is getting cut. Lol. 
* [[2019.11.03 - TDL: Audits]]
** My favorite part of mathematics is that I don't have to apply much pressure. It's easy to be an autodidact for quite some time in that discipline.
* [[2019.11.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: أحبك حتى لو ضاع في الترجمة]] 
** I adore both quotes. I'm aiming not to deconstruct (not my gut instinct) while still giving simple acknowledgement. I don't know how to honor that honesty any better than that, so that's my goal. 
* [[Poem: Mending Wall]]
** Several [[infinigress]]es here. It's a hard problem. I know. It was striking to happen upon this issue from multiple perspectives. I aim to be useful.
* [[2019.11.03 - Family Log: Yale job]]
** Well, at least someone in the house enjoys Discord.
** I'm fortunate enough to say this sentence more often: "I'd like to live that day forever." Obviously, it's not moral enough to do so, but it is heavenly.
* [[/b/: One-Liners]]
** That is antipleonasmic.
** I don't always need a complete tiddler workspace.
