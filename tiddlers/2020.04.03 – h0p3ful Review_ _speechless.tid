** I don't think this is fair to say. 
** You could go back and fix the network manager software.
** Note, you took steps to correct it. So much of computing is either remember, remembering to remember, or remembering where to find it.

** =). Thank you, sir.

** No. You need to try to fill them out, please. 
*** I fail too. You've seen it plenty. We still have to try.
*[[2020.04.02 – Wiki Review: Guess]]
** I'd like to see you refrain from attempting a private language and set of arbitrary abbreviations to a greater extent. But, I realize [[Wiki Review]] is a place to be more informal, and yeah, even to unwind some. Up to you, I suppose.

** Correct, sir. This is well said. I should add that if we don't question what we took to be out of control (when it actually was), we often won't be able to correct our mistakes. 
** I'm glad that you are concerned with worrying [[irwartfrr]], in the right [[dok]]. This is not a simple problem.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I'm a day late and dollar short. Just working with 04.04's instead.
** [[4th April 2017]] is delightful to me. I'm so glad we've gone after non-tradition subjects. 
*** How about you? What do you think about the evolution of your curriculum?
