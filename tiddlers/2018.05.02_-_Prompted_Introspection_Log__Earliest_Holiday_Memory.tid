title: 2018.05.02 - Prompted Introspection Log: Earliest Holiday Memory

!! What's your earliest holiday memory?

Christmas when I was 4.5 years old. I don't remember much at all about it though, I'm afraid. It is clear to me that as I have aged, my memories have dissipated. My brain has truly been pruned. We tend to remember those things which make us happy and forget those which made us sad (to some degree). It's part of why we are nostalgic. I see it as my duty to fight my urge to confabulate and misrepresent who I was to myself. It's crucial that I say it carefully.

Sadly, I've not really done much at all in my {[[Vault]]}. I worry that in time I will forget so much that I can't possibly retell it. I think that's okay.

I could speak of the Christmas' after, but they are beginning to blur.
