title: 2017.06.15 - Pipefitting Log

Today was productive and frustrating. I immediately started working as soon as I got there before class started. We had our fabrication built right before lunch. It went quickly and smoothly. The measurements were right. I thought we nailed it.

We did not nail it though. We went to mount it, and it was off by 3/4", and there was no clean way to fix it. We dismounted it and moved the flanges hoping that would work. We remounted it, and it made it much better, but it was now too short to hit the valve. So, instead of dismounting this one, we put the valve on it and took the other fabrication down instead (easier to move). We quickly cut off the limb, cut a new pipe and put it on there. We were in a rush, and you could tell. It wasn't pretty, but it worked. We got it together, mounted it, and it fit. It was a tight fit because we failed to do a complete flange takeout for this extended pipe (I just had him take some off). As I said, we just wanted to finish it. 

After it was all said and done, we checked it. The level was within bounds, but it still wasn't visually appealing. The pipe we threw on there is visibly not right. In fact, I can tell several pipes just aren't perfect. It was frustrating. 

Chris and I talked about why it wasn't working. What did we do wrong? The initial measurements seem to be the most plausible answer. And, the problem point was right where I was worried it would be. Goddamnit!

That 184" and 185" difference in the top and bottom continues to give us huge headaches. The isometric drawings get really fucked up by it. As we push and pull to fit, it even warps the pipe directions elsewhere on the other simulator. It's not beautiful. I can tell you that. /shrug; it's not always going to be perfect. I'll keep doing my best to improve.

I did finish the resume. I'm going to make a general one as well and just start applying everywhere. At this point, I just need a job.
