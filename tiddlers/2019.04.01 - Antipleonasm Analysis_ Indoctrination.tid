title: 2019.04.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Indoctrination

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
For those who stubbornly seek freedom around the world, there can be no more urgent task than to come to understand the mechanisms and practices of indoctrination. These are easy to perceive in the totalitarian societies, much less so in the propaganda system to which we are subjected and in which all too often we serve as unwilling or unwitting instruments.

Preach, yo! This quote isn't unjustified indoctrination though folks. This is also my problem in discussions of ideologies, memeplexes, and the cultivation of our minds in dialectics. [[Virtue is Knowledge]], and thus it is a habituated bias [[irwartfrr]]. I'm no relativist even if I'm a contextualist (and I see so many people fail here). My problem, as usual, is about how we justify our memetic transmissions. I favor violence in many cases, and that is a hard pill to swallow for those of who respect freedom so much. It is not an easy line to walk.

Education is often coercive. There's no way around it. Wrestling is sometimes going to be painful. Learning sometimes forces something in our phenomenology and minds, and even the process can punish failure. Sometimes we are wrong, and it requires feeling bad to correct it (that part of why it is so useful to have evolved to have feelings). Epistemology itself is fundamentally concerned with justification; that is all there is. 

Here is one of my problems with [[Saint Chomsky]]: he's not obsessed enough with the nature of justification. He points at it, but he never digs into the essence. This lack of justifying metaphysics and metaethics is one of the flaws I see in most political philosophers, psychologists, and linguists, but it is probably an outgrowth of the popularity of nominalism and ease with which everyone can accept so many of the arguments which are made upon such sparse empirical grounds.
