title: 2018.10.12 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

This book has been instrumental in my understanding of the political necessity of freedom in academia. I cannot say I'm against high-stakes testing, though I think good testing is hard to build. 

I adore that Hermione disagrees with her book. Hermione is an idol I will never live up to.

Umbridge is an amazing villain. 

Some of the teaching reviews I've received I have been grateful to have the chance to think and act upon. Being reviewed by someone incompetent or outright evil is not fun. I don't give a shit what these people have to say, and I do not hide it. McGonagall is also one of my heroes.

The political struggle which cause the "wise" in HP's life to encourage the silence of his rebellion against Umbridge and the Dark Power culture in the book requires more attention. I'm not convinced it is handled all that well, but perhaps it is. I think you need a proper set of reasons to be deceptive in this regard.

It annoys me that HP is forced to appear better than Hermione in DADA. That doesn't make any sense in the story, imho.

The signs of fascism, decrees against gathering together, etc. Love it.

I'm continually pissed off by owl-disruption.

Umbridge does not wish to empower anyone except insofar as it is empowering to her. Sounds like school in the states!

I think the Magic Economy makes no sense, unfortunately. But, we have to suspend our disbelief.

There is an odd element of empathy in how Voldemort and HP are connected. 

Always interesting to see how people hide and don't share in this story. So many problems would be solved if they when it was appropriate to maintain privacy and when it isn't.

The number of orgies in my Room of Requirements would be amazing.

I love to see students teaching themselves. That is what I desperately hope to accomplish with my own children, while handing them huge headstarts, hints, and frameworks. I try to guide and tailor, but they have to put in the work.

Love how there are "markers" for both DE and DA. =)

Tough watching Umbridge in Hagrid's class. =(

HP's ability to see through Nagini as well is fantastic. It's a hell of a mechanic!

I'm still not sure what Sirius counts as. He's a cool as fuck uncle, to say the least.
