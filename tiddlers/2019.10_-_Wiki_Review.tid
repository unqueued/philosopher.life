!! Audit:

* Yeah, it feels like you don't get much done after work. Sometimes, that's the best thing to do, ofc.
* Sometimes this is just useless, and othertimes, it is the best place, a relief valve, a perfect cubby hole, a backup skeleton, an instrument for speaking to others, a bubbling metamap, etc.
** Ofc, knowing that I have nothing to say is also something.
* Captures lots of little things I remember after the fact or that didn't quite fit.
* It's a perfect place to be a dipshit.
** It's a mental laxative for muh braindumps and stupidity.
*** The [[title.Title]]s alone are, just, unforgivable. Lol.
* You are too slow at letter-writing. I am disappoint.
* Neverending lastword or something? Maybe. Reminds me of always replying on leddit.
* Now the tight ones are a delicious treat. =)
* One of the hardest parts of handling this kind of hypergraphic prolix work is just remembering it. [[Wiki Review]] serves as a serious memory tool, adding labels, metative addresses, mnemonics, and repetition necessary for visualizing it. 
** Not that I've not said this before! :P.
* The difference between [[New]] and [[Recent]] is a testament to the necessity of this project.
