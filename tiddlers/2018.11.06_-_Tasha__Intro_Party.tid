title: 2018.11.06 - Tasha: Intro Party

Our neighbors finally took us up on our offer to come over. They texted me last night that they were down for a get together (I gave them carte blanche on scheduling). We had a pizza party, played Cards Against Humanity (my daughter won). It was excellent. We stayed up late into the evening, ~1:30am, talking. 

She is an ex-bank employee who code-switches hard. She currently is one of "The Help" for the daughter of an extremely wealthy family in the area. She is contending with sexual child abuse of the kids she takes care of. 

Esteban is a kid from the hood, down to earth, funny, and we got on excellently. We learned their life stories. 

These folks are clearly sensitive to classism and racism they experience here in TN. I can see it.

Her brother couldn't make it, but we learned more about his epilepsy and autism. Hopefully, Matthew and I can be friends.
