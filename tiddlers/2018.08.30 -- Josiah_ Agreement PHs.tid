title: 2018.08.30 -- Josiah: Agreement PHs

Agreed. I'm always trying to convince the writers I know to give TW a spin, and this is one of those simple mechanics which turn out to be super useful. Whether they are building character bibles, graphing their plots, or mind-mapping their epistemic periphery, placeholders are outstanding "to-do" or even "maybe" flags sitting in your writing. For me, it's an organization tool helping me break bigger problems down into smaller ones, and it helps me explicitly state to myself that I need to expand or connect something in the first place. When I'm in the flowstate, I don't have time write in every direction I'm thinking; I have to triage. Placeholders help me leave the breadcrumbs necessary to come back and iteratively grow some web of thought.

There's another kind of placeholder I use as well. Sometimes, I have something to say, but I don't quite know where to put it or what I should name it. I need to get it out on a page and worry about how to categorize it later. "Create a new tiddler" automatically applies "PH" to my title. Sometimes I'll spin up several placeholder tiddlers until I've figured out how they fit into the bigger picture and why.
