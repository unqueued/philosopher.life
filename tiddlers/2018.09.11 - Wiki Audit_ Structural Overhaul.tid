title: 2018.09.11 - Wiki Audit: Structural Overhaul

[[2018.09.11 - Tagging: Responses]] demonstrates to me that I may have to completely rebuild this wiki in a radical way. I fear I have truly fucked up in my construction. My goal here is to make it so that refactoring again will be almost painless. You know, I thought I was doing a job. Lol. I don't even see what it's supposed to look like, ugh.

Here's where I think I haven't fucked up too badly. I have a fuckton of content in this wiki, and there are some very good structures here. Yeah, it's a mess, and it will always be a little bit messy. 

I really want to know how to make tags and fields awesome. I need to ask [[Sphygmus]]!
