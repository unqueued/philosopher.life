title: 2018.07.10 - Deep Reading: Infinite Jest

AA meeting is sad, as usual. I am reminded of dialethias here.

Okay, I am having a hard time disliking Joelle.

The crocodile thing is fascinating! Oh, why didn't he say more about i!? 

Joelle's grammatical nazism actually has semantic depth! My wife might actually appreciate the PGOAT in this respect too.

The "It" scene has to be one of the most fucked up things I've ever read. It's also, to my horror, got a lot of jest in it. =/ Life sucks.

I could only hear Bill Clinton's voice.

The ONAN political timeline is surreal.

I regret to say that there are literally boring chapters, at least on the first read through. I just don't see the value in them, except instrumentally as signs to a larger metanarrative about why they are so boring.
