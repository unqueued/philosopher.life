title: 2019.02.19 - Afterschool Teaching: Solopen

Whitney is not coming in today. It is conveniently timed. This would be a worthy day to skip, lol. She knows this is a higher pressure day, and she has no interest in performing a song and dance. She avoids judgment, and in this case, I can't blame her. I hope she can be honest about it with me especially after her spiel about refusing to miss work (and being glad we didn't have prez day off) because she needs the money. In any case, good for her!

I did all the prep. I need the kids to eat vegetables. They hate them. I'm going to try anyway. 

I'm prepared to speak about non-newtonian fluids with the kiddos alongside Matt's project. I have a feeling he will create it with them but not explain why or even what. I am prepared to glaze their eyes over. I did eventually talk about it even though Matt never created it. Matt was merely signaling to Delp.

I took the 6th and 7th graders, Mitchell the 5th, and Matt the 8th. 6Jm is annoying as all get out. I have them reading and writing though. We talked about drafting, the notion of leisure, authority in textbooks, the value of Wikipedia, and "the hood."

We hit the lab. Matt did my paperwork, I took the kids. Cool. The more kids I can get on the computers, the better. Dorsey kicked us out when the conferences began. We went to the gym (only place we could go). Matt and Delp did all the gladhanding. I avoided having to signal, and everyone else did it. Noice! 

Matt is clearly tired today. He did come alive for me when I talked with him about his book. Matt was reading a book of short stories from Breece DJ Pancake. He had me read his favorite, and he did some close reading analysis with me. At first, I think he assumed I had no idea what I had read. Of course, I am not a talented reader, but this wasn't too difficult. The story I read had a Poe thing going on. We discussed his opinions about the story, and I gave some counterpoints. We talked about Southern Gothic, Romanticism, Appalachian literature, and the Ship of Theseus. That was the best conversation I've had with Matt. We should talk more about the humanities.<<ref "2020.02.19">>
