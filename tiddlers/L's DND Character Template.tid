PHYSICAL FEATURES:

(Please include things here like eyecolor, hair color/length, scars, height, etc. I like to know these things. If you have no particular interest in adding this much detail,
you are welcome to randomly generate it or I can do so for you.)

BACKSTORY:

(Please see the "Game Premise" file! As your DM, I would very much appreciate it if you stick to my guidelines. It means I can have an easier time creating a game for you as
I tie your backstory in. Also, I reserve my right to say no to certain things. I will do my best to be as accommodating as possible because diversity is fun, but ultimately
I am creating a game for you. Don't be rude. :P )
