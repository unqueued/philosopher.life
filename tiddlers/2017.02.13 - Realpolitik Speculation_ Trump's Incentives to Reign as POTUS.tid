title: 2017.02.13 - Realpolitik Speculation: Trump's Incentives to Reign as POTUS

Dollars to donuts, Trump has a slightly above average IQ (kill me, please /s) and an extremely high dark-triad spectrum rating. He's not bright, but he's smart enough to infect people's minds with garbage. He's learned to say the right garbage, in the right way, at the right time, to the right people, and so on (but, obviously, not for the right reasons). He has a kind of memetic virtue to him (however disturbing the thought) like the virtue of viruses unto themselves. In his extreme way, he desperately seeks to appear (if not be) wealthy and powerful, and he miraculously pulls it off in some twisted self-fulfilling prophecy. This alone is enough for him to want to be POTUS.

That said, I think many worry that Trump's apparent admiration for Putin will emerge as sincerely flatterious mimicry. How is Trump going to fleece us beyond the opportunity cost of having a POTUS who even appears remotely sane?<<ref "1">> He's clearly going to profit from being POTUS. We know why. We don't know how, or at least not all the ways.

Trump's family's housing arrangement and consistent vacations seem almost like a direct transfer of a non-trivial quantity of US government cash to himself. This is beyond wasting taxpayer money. Trump is healing his self-created insolvency with our money. I can only assume he will milk us at every corner he can if he would do it so openly at this almost childish level. We will see what other methods he finds to enrich and empower himself during and after his reign.

Our only hope is that he's too stupid and lacking in empathy for himself to follow the advice of those who could really turn him into an even more terrifyingly competent Putinesque monster (Trumps connections with Russian political and kleptocratic interests is frightening). He did straight up say in his campaigning that he would leave all foreign and domestic leadership calls to his hand-picked staff (uh...). Four years or until his impeachment seems like a long time (literally too long, ofc), and it may only be a matter of time before Trump understands how to effectively wield his new toy, the Office of POTUS.<<ref "2">> 

We have passed the point of presidents who willingly go into debt because they know they will have the political clout and "foundations" (non-profits too often are fronts for making money and discharging or converting social and political capital) to pay it back and still make bank while swinging their big dicks around with the Hyperclass. Sinners with shame are bad enough, but sinners without shame may be even more dangerous.<<ref "3">> Trump marks a new era in government corruption, particularly in his blatant openness about it and our willingness to accept it.

<<footnotes "1" "e.g. Shillary. Not that she is actually sane. Her front is a different kind, and the evils she would bring with her a different breed.">>

<<footnotes "2" "I can hear fools telling me to 'respect the office.' As always, that is some psychopathic bullshit. You'd have to hate yourself and fail to respect your own dignity (and others) to agree to that obvious falsehood.">>

<<footnotes "3" "To a point, of course. We can't always tell the difference between those who cover themselves with the mere appearance of shame and those who actually experience it. The truly most dangerous devils are those who still look like angels as they stab you.">>
