Here I attempt to turn my Husserlian ray of intentionality upon itself. When I am thinking existentially in a recursive manner, I can more decisively align my many orders of Frankfurtian networks of beliefs and desires. Here I directly practice [[metaliving]] by reflecting on where and what I've been focusing on in this wiki. I need to be thinking about the state and nature of the projects I am working on from a more objective perspective, and I must wisely write my narrative. I hope this is an act of mid-term executive functioning. I do it subconsciously and indirectly to some extent, but not explicitly enough. Here I force myself to copy it down and review it at least once a month.<<ref "1">> 

Essentially, I need a constantly updating set of logs, audit trails, and a gameplan for this wiki and my life. I must hold myself accountable and strategize. I need to consider where and how I spend my time and energy and wisely adjust my behaviors accordingly. I hope this page gives me the material and framework with which to strategize about, organize, forecast, and redirect my focus. 

Logs are the bulk of my scheduled practices and foci on this wiki. The structure provides a significant space bound by the right mechanics for me to explore. These logs and audits provide feedback loops, and I slowly improve upon them and myself over time. As usual, even if only speaking to myself in empathy, please pardon my progress.

Major logs have a monthly audit. The wiki as a whole has a yearly audit.

<<footnotes "1" "I feel it necessary to point out the infinigress I approach in this log-based introspection. I'm running into classic postmodern metanarrative and autonomy problematics. As a matter of metamodern pragmatism, I will accept there must be a foundational boundary where I stop constantly investigating and deconstructing. I will leave it to my yearly audit/assessment/review to investigate the state and nature of this page in those respects and to push further into that self-reflective frontier. I feel this strikes an appropriate balance between the definitionally impossible logistics of that infinigress and having the integrity to continue my recursive, multi-ordered executive functioning.">>
