title: 2018.08.14 - BAGD: Participation

Class participation is absolutely necessary.

You must wrestle and engage in the dialectic with us.

Taking good notes, digesting, putting into your fastmind, habitually training yourself, making it virtue-theoretic, non-cognitive, limbic, fastmind oriented requires responding. Make yourself a computational function of the input, and transform it. Become a function which functions on itself, recursively learning how to learn and adapt to the constant flood of inputs.

# If you agree: state the claim more succinctly than your teacher. Crystallize it. Show you have mastered it. Give examples. Try to find the edges and give reasons to limit the discussion even further than the teacher has demonstrated.
# If you disagree or doubt: give a faithful reconstruction of their argument, steelman, and then start poking holes. Start asking the penetrating questions which destroys the argument, the assumptions, the soundness, etc.

You need to either construct or deconstruct. Analyze and synthesize.

You are here to engage in the dialectic of the classroom. This is the 21st century Socratic method.

Be crazy honest with yourselves in the dialectic, [[The Original Position]] as we tell the story together. This is the part of the construction that is correct, in a sense. However, I'm a realist. The whole point it to actually realize a construction closer to the external, objective truth.

I'm teaching you how to learn in class, what class is really about, about how to learn with others profoundly.

Bottlenecks pigeon-hole what [[dok]] of conversations we can even have. We can only compress our semantics so much before they become too lossy to be useful.

Push through the pain. Not all sports are equal; mental wrestling is the most fundamental of them all.
