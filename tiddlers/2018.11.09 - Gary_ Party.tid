title: 2018.11.09 - Gary: Party

I attended a party with my wife's co-workers last night. I am not a social butterfly, but frankly, neither are the librarians. I'm still an extremist even among them though. I will hold the awkward silence for a long time. That said, I did my best to ~~interrogate~~ tailor questions to each of the people there to get to know them further (it is fascinating to see how few reciprocate). Even in my good faith attempt to socialize, I am, unfortunately, the annoying asshole. I want to talk about what's real.

I may have offended our host in my defense of Leftism. The dude clearly has no clue what he's talking about (but he can maymay, so I like that ;P). Actually, many of them are just bad at reasoning about ethics and politics, particularly the Biblical scholars in attendance. Even when the truth is slapping them in the face, they can't open their eyes to see it. Gary is an exception. Mind you, at times, he purposely avoids trying to worry about the truth with Daoism, but it's not like he's not woke to it. He's the oldest person in the room, and among the attendees, he's also the highest ranked at the institution; he has to deal with Rightist admin directly. Gary is a good wrestling partner.

I basically hung with Gary most of the evening; we arrived and left together. We talked about a great deal, though there are some things we couldn't talk about too loudly. I am a man who has the ability to not give a fuck about what others think, but he does not have that luxury. He actively aims to lay low.

As usual, we dove into Daoism, and the primary take away was his insistence on Daoist empiricism. We ended the evening with me trying to introduce Kant.
