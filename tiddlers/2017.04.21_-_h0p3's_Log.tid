!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

It's okay. I'm still feeling depressed, but it wasn't as bad as it was. I will continue to take DCK once a week. I need to. I found a mixer that makes it go down easier. My body obviously does not want it. It requires wrestling.


!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

I'm in my scheduled 2-week cannabis abstinence period. It is going better than I expected. I'm considering just stopping for now. I'd probably only get to use for 2-4 more weeks anyway.



!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technologic, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

Essentially, I want the full 60-days (could technically get away with 20-days, but I absolutely cannot afford to fail) before August to flush it out of my system to pass all possible drug tests. Technically, that means I should stop on June 1st. My gut feeling about stopping early is this: I believe I will run out of course material long before June 1st. I have buttwelds and bookwork left, which I believe I can master in less than a month. 

I will likely be conscripted to teach and try to weld if I have the chance. It seems like the higher utility option is to co-op and continue coming in to pass NCCER tests. I can't co-op without passing drugs tests. Thus, by the time I'm finishing up the pipefitting course in the next month or so, I'd like to be able to walk straight into a co-op. 

We could use the money. I could use the experience, networking, etc (which again, is for the money). 

I'm also worried that I'm filling I'm pushing the pleasure-button in my brain with games. This may or may not be a good coping mechanism. I will need to watch myself. 


!! What are you going to do about what happened?

I'm not sure yet. We'll see how DCK goes. Its half-life is incredibly short compared to cannabutter, going to baseline within 1-2 weeks (it's also not tested for). It seems like the best option. I have to make sure I'm not drinking heavily though. It should be abstained from as much as possible. This ensures that when I need it, I can use it. It sucks that alcohol is the legal drug here; it's obviously the most dangerous one. =( That's okay. I will make do with what I have. Let us not forget there are other options in [[The Ark]], but I need to see about their drug-testing.
