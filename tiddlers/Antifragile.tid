title: Antifragile

Hyped into oblivion. Run into it plenty. Some of this sounds like common sense or truisms. I could easily be wrong. Might as well, eh?

The Triad â€“ Fragile, Robust, Antifragile 

I'm looking for dialectics and sublation here.

Perhaps I should just go for the new book (I've been thinkin' about it).

I'm a fan of harnessing randomness. I see it many of my games. Beauty in handling the unknown. 

Continues from his previous books. I'm interested to see if this says anything I've not seen yet.

Asymmetry. I think this is the control role.

I completely agree to the skin in the game problem. This is talking about the centralization of power and the moves which Ribbonfarm aims to capitalize upon.

Though shall not have anti-fragility at the expense of having fragility in others. I don't mind that claim so much. [[T42T]] has a Robustness Principle going on (even though "Robust" means something else in this book). 

Neomania. Meh. Wonder if he commits the teleological "fallacy" when talking about nature or not. I think nature might be The Dialectic. I kind of want to say "duh" to his conclusion then.

He says we can't predict rare events. I am not so sure how one build anti-fragility without essentially making a prediction. I don't see why or how we can measure anti-fragility if we can't actually measure the risks it supposedly mitigates.

This feels like [[The Gervais Principle]] (or vv). Fragilista is inflammatory. Sissy notions? Lol.

He's a fine communicator, and I love the lists he builds. I am in no position to commit either way on some of these claims. 

He clearly hates academics, lol.

This is philosophical, but so far it's profoundly rhetorical. I admire that he puts his money where his mouth is. Of course, I have seen that used rhetorically as well.

He doesn't think libraries should be the source of an idea? He's moving way too fast here (or he's flat out wrong).

Commerce is the door to tolerance in his view. He is a capitalist through and through.

He lights people up in his past, lol.

I'm still looking for perfect definitions of these terms. Again, this has been hype so far. I don't mind it rambling, but it better be right ;P.

An attack on the nation-state! You have my attention. 

Overall, smooth as fuck read, pleasantly loud. This person is a salesman.

The list of things he claims to connect and solve in a systematic fashion is quite long for a few books, lol.

He claims Socrates is over-rational `/facepalm`

Things come in "trivals?" This feels like a self-help book.

He appears to favor decentralization (which has become just a fucking buzzword for most people), but this appears to be Capitalism apology. If this is realpolitik enough, it's just doing what The Economist is asking the wealthy (and tricking everyone else) into doing. 

Antifragility is Golden Mean oriented. That is a fantastic place to start. The Nietzsche quotes have got to go.

What will I do with all these references and etymological explorations? =)

Hydra is antifagile. I still don't fucking understand what this is different than resilience. I can agree that risk management is a fundamental problem, but only virtue of having [[The End]] in mind. This is just an instrument.

One thing I'm worried about is how this notion will be selectively applied by others to imply agency where there is none and vv.

On the necessity of naming (dude is clearly philosophizing here, but it's so centered on his empirical dialectical model). Don't see why he thinks we don't naturally think about this. That is not a good assumption; he's engaged in pure salesmanship rhetoric here. Does he really think he's going to leverage the sapir-whorfian hypothesis in this one word to rock my world? What makes this wiser than everything else I've seen?

I can see why some people find this book lifechanging. I'm still waiting for actual definitions, explanations, and justifications.

He is mesmerizing in how much ground he covers. He is clearly a polymath with a salesmanship-polish. Odds are good we would not get along but would benefit from speaking with each other (I highly doubt he would think he has anything to gain from me).

He generalizes the human species with some exaggeration (and I'm pretty open on this front, imho).

He loves to brag, lol. I don't mind, but I'm reading this book to understand an argument! Where the fuck is the argument!?

I'm 20% into this book, and I'm tired of the anecdotes, namedropping, loose allusions (it's not like he's made any valuable technical moves; he's only pointed), etc. I love that he has such a strong point of view. I'm not learning anything from it though. I'm not wrestling with it. I hate how much rhetoric is in this book. Alright, I'm setting it aside. Not all good books in general are good for me.
