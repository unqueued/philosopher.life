The blogpost she deleted was interesting. I need to think more about it. She is dealing with the problem of authority. I'm not sure who she is speaking to or why.

The Source Walking Beside the Boat by walkingbesidetheboat

For some reason that defies explanation, many people go looking for wisdom among people. They listen eagerly to gifted speakers and go sniffing after brilliant authors like puppies on the trail of treasure. It boggles the mind. We know who and what we are. We are not blind to our innate brokenness, are we?

You ask we to look to you for the healing and restoration of my soul? I ask you to accept my prescription for peace and understanding? God forbid! We are human, and while the human being is capable of great things, and human community is powerful to change the face of the Earth, we are limited, frequently mind-locked and mortal. What good we do we quickly undo. What harm we do we are often powerless to mend.

I will look to God. So should you. There is real wisdom and understanding there. God is a deep, deep well of pure knowledge, rightly ordered and woven into truth for us. Yes, it is often beyond our understanding, but faith rises under us, and lifts us to obedience.

Why do we seek little gods to sooth our craving for connection when The Holy One is standing there, a hair’s breadth away, open to our presence and offering rich conversation? How sad that we should snub the Almighty to go courting broken creatures with imperfect plans for our lives.

Please look through me, or at least past me, to see the One I serve.

“I made the earth, formed it, and set it in place. My name is Yahweh.” This is what Yahweh says: “Call to me, and I will answer you. I will tell you great and mysterious things that you do not know.” Jeremiah 33:2-3
