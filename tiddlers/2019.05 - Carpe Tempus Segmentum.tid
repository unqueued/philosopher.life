!! Audit:

* My sleep schedule has been out of wack. I have been taking naps though.
* //Breaking Bad// has been an excellent use of our time. The kids ask good questions. I love that we pause the video to talk. 
* I've watched plenty of bullshit this month. I can't say I have much to show for me. I think it's been a waste of my time. Film is practically dead to me. =/
** It is the golden age of TV.
* My days have normalized though. There's a flow. I think time is flying even faster than usual. I don't have nearly as much novelty to handle. 
** I've been feeling fairly unmotivated at large.
* This style is easy to read. The most interesting bits have long tails.
* This log is also some sort of backbone, like [[Wiki Review]]. When I wouldn't know where to put something, especially if it is small and relevant to that particular day, it fits here.
* Major descriptions of people I've met. I like that.
* Alcohol is not a good drug for me, but I want to make sure I can naturally pass a drug test.
** I could go for some zlam.
* I remind you, future [[h0p3]], there are two reminders of remembering to remember in here.
* I am the shitty glubricant of my family.
