We take for granted that the organism does not learn to grow arms or to reach puberty... When we turn to the mind and its products, the situation is not qualitatively different from what we find in the case of the body.

Yikes. You can argue for innate grammars as well as genetic and probabilistic predispositions in our mental constructions without being that hyperbolic. Can you tell me what it means to learn at all? Go ahead and claim you aren't a behaviorist all you want, but this is not qualitatively different. [[Saint Chomsky]], your claim egregiously makes no space for autonomy.
