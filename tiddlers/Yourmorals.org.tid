To Whom It May Concern:

This may be irrelevant to you, but I wanted to give you my opinion. I'm hoping it may change how you write some of your questions. If it is pertinent to you, I have an academic background in moral philosophy and some moral psychology. Take it or leave it. If you found my thought useful, you're welcome; otherwise, I'm sorry if you feel I've wasted your time since that is not my intention.

The cultural mindset questionnaire repeatedly makes the conceptual error of failing to distinguish my perceptions of my beliefs of 'what is' from 'what ought.' I answered several questions in light of the fact that they are literally asking for my opinion of an accurate description of the world rather than what I take to be the fitting prescription (and why). I am strongly convinced such a distinction is crucial to the fitting analysis.

This test fails to capture the right kind of information because it is ambiguous where it should not be. You need to write questions which demonstrate the difference between claiming the world is a particular way from whether or not I think it is a good thing the world is that way. You aren't capturing my cultural mindset correctly otherwise.

Essentially, there is a difference between [how I describe the culture I live in], [what I prescribe; how one ought to act in that context], and [why I hold my prescription; the intentions and principle for my maxim]. Depending on how you phrase the question you're going to see different modes. Peel apart the questions more, please.


Sincerely,
