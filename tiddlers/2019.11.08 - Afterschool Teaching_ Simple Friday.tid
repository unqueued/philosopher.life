title: 2019.11.08 - Afterschool Teaching: Simple Friday

Carson is stressed about a project for Math Instruction. Her teacher sounds neurotic. She made a lot of extra food today. Cool.

Matt asked if it was my last day. That's interesting.

One-on-ones were a flurry today. I had a ton of students who wanted to talk beyond asking for permission or resolving conflict. It continued into the library. I'm lucky to have people who find it worth their time to speak with me. They have been wild today; I've almost used my whistle twice today. Luckily, I had the chance to troll several of my students today with terrible grandpa like jokes. =)

I took the lion's share with me to the lab. 

Lots of cleaning today.

Delp warned the adult females about not speaking to strangers for 10 minutes. They, of course, agreed that it would be best for their protection, especially to stay away from males. We spoke of other things which came out of a meeting he attended. I am glad to be leaving the bullshit but not my children.
