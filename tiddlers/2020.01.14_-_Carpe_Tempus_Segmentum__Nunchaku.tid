title: 2020.01.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Nunchaku

* Woke at 11?
** I slept! OMG. It wasn't like I didn't wake up constantly, but I really slept.
* Clean
* Dishwasher installation
* Worked on offspring's rooms
** We had fun in construction
* Our bed is set correctly now.
* Walked with wife
** She had a stressful day, but noicely her tech took her at her word (which is wonderful, a lot of people doubt my wife's competence).
** $1 numbchux, glow in the dark. Dropped the asswhoopin'. 
*** I'm pretty sure my wife is envious of my ninja skeelz. I appreciate her having fun with me.
* Lasagna and Vegan sliders for my love
* Full Blown Unstoppable Coughing Attack
** Lasted until midnight
** Called up the hospitable we don't have insurance to visit yet. Nurse listened and said I sounded awful, but that given our position, we should just continue what we are doing.
*** `/salute` - I know you aren't supposed to do that according to your bosses.
** Still considering a clinic here. It would be good to know the cause. If it's the apartment, then we have a new obstacle to overcome.
* I just didn't write or get shit done. 
** It's been a while since I was this sick, and I'm not going to feel bad about it. 
* Neither here nor there: feels like people have been extra quiet in my life. 
** Not that I can trust my perceptions here. Blurry AF.
* Tried sleeping at midnight, but no idea when I finally blacked out.
