title: 2018.07.30 - Adam Nemecek: Intro

```
Hello!
I'm contacting you about your recent HN post on linear logic.
Your post made some strong claims about linear logic, and I'm excited by how it may be a formalism of dialectics.
Do you have any papers/books on linear logic which you might recommend?
10:27 AM
adamnemecek
hey
haha that post pissed a lot of people off
thanks for reaching out!
i have way too many papers but like none of them take you from point a to point b
i guess my qustion is what's your background
are you interested in like the math of this or the philosophy or the computer science
h0p3
Philosophy.
I'm interested in how it's related to the borrow checker of Rust too
Reading the SEP article on linear logic
adamnemecek
http://asaj.org/talks/lola16/?full#cover
there's this language that rust references called cyclone
the borrowchecer is from there
h0p3
Thank you
adamnemecek
de nada
like none of this is like...fully explored right now
h0p3
In particular, I am interested to see if linear logic would be useful to exploring this concept: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/
adamnemecek
this is more of a paraconsistent logic
the difference is actually interesting
i believe that linear logic prevents you from forming incorrect questions
i think that one of the reasons why a sentence can be both correct and incorrect is if it's a badly posed question
the classical example i use is
"there are only two genders, a man and a woman"
"a rock is not a woman"
"therefore a rock is a man"
this is classical logic
h0p3
Alright, so I'm in your class, and let's say I've a bit of background in classical logic...I'm your student, and I say: "we didn't state that a rock has a gender, so why should we think classical logic results in that conclusion?"
It is quite possible I've entirely missed your point
adamnemecek
it's a fair point
i guess the main thing to realize
this is true for intuitionistic logic as well
is the lack of excluded middle
i believe that if you have excluded middle
you are basically assuming that any question has a true/false answer
h0p3
I am not an expert, but from my understanding...intuitionist logic is concerned with a kind of epistemic humility about the infinite, where they don't think we have a right to apply the law of excluded middle to some kinds of contexts dealing with infinities
adamnemecek
that sounds right
h0p3
does linear logic help prevent us from forming incorrect questions about the infinite?
adamnemecek
yes
h0p3
this is important
adamnemecek
that's the thing
classical logic has this weird idea about infinity
like T or T = T
this doesn't hold up irl
linear logic treats facts as resources
you have to "spend" facts to create new facts
you cant infinitely regenerate the same fact
h0p3
This really does seem related to Rust too =)
adamnemecek
rust uses a subset called mall
MALL
multiplicative additive linear logic
http://prntscr.com/kctxr9
it's from wikipedia
so pos is you as player 1
add is or
mul is and
exp is an operator that can consume or generate resources
so you have access to infinity if you want
h0p3
I will need to study this. It's entirely new to me. Your bold claims may be correct, and that is exciting.
adamnemecek
haha i like your attitude
i really hate when i make like...informal claims to open up a discussion
and these bottom feeders come out of the woodworks asking for like proofs of every single detail
i get where they are coming from
h0p3
lol
aye
adamnemecek
however like...
i never found proofs to be good explanations of why
h0p3
they do not give me the qualitative story, in the end

exactly
and lik
von neumann has this quote
imma paraphrase
being rigorous about things you dont understand is pointless
where are you from
h0p3
That sentiment makes sense. I appreciate your courage and willingness to state it informally.
adamnemecek
haha thanks
getting it now
adamnemecek
it's like 3 usd on amazon
https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/278.Nikola_Tesla
“The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.” 
h0p3
Speaking of autobiographies of weird people, I keep an extensive wiki here: https://philosopher.life/. You may hate it, and that's fine. I want to give you the opportunity to know who you are dealing with. I will be thinking about you and your words openly. 
adamnemecek
“I am credited with being one of the hardest workers and perhaps I am, if thought is the equivalent of labour, for I have devoted to it almost all of my waking hours. But if work is interpreted to be a definite performance in a specified time according to a rigid rule, then I may be the worst of idlers.”
there arent too many things that make me hate things
lemme check it out
how old are you
it's very personal
h0p3
33 tomorrow
adamnemecek
the blog i mean
h0p3
intensely personal
adamnemecek
you very much talk about things i also think about
h0p3
=)
adamnemecek
it's weird idk where that idk interest in the infinite unknown comes in us
h0p3
/lets-be-friends.jpg
adamnemecek
haha yeah
being friends with other intjs is good sometimes however sometimes it's weird
i met this one guy and like a lot of convos are of the form
"are you familiar with x?"
here iwas like
no matter what either of us brought up
the other knew about it
and like
was kinda bored of talking about it
cause it's all he talks about
how old are you btw?
h0p3
33 tomorrow
you?
adamnemecek
30 2 months ago
actually 30
idk why i said 2 months ago
so i have an even crazier theory, wanna hear it?
h0p3
yes
I love theories
adamnemecek
this one is quite the theory
h0p3
shoot
adamnemecek
ok so are you familiar with homotopy type theory?
h0p3
no
adamnemecek
it's amazing. the guy behind it got a fields medal and was quite the character.
kicked out of hs for disagreeing with teacher
kicked out of undergrad for ...idk soething
however he continued publishing
and god into harvard grad school without ever apploying
lol
* got into harvard 
h0p3
clearly a genius

he actually died in 2016
he was working on something called homotopy type theory
which basically states that type theory == logic == topology
its interesting and in some sense its the foundation of computer verifiable math
which is something really missing
i'll come back to this, i just need to lay some groundwork
are you familiar with quaternions?
h0p3
no, never heard of them
adamnemecek
ok get ready to have your life changed forever
h0p3
lol
adamnemecek
it's such a weird story
so like
you know about complex numbers?
numbers of the form 3 + 4i
h0p3
aye
adamnemecek
complex numbers are 2d,
quaternions are complex numbers in 3d
then there's octonions
and other-ions
however quaternions are good enough
as you care mostly about 3d
ok and here comes the weird part
they are insanely useful in physics
in fact maxwell (of the maxwells equations fame)
came up with the equations using quaternions
and using this formalism it's one formula
it was later translated to the current form
which relies on differential geometry
and is hard as balls to understand
https://slehar.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/clifford-algebra-a-visual-introduction/
51c324527dd251a9b3d98a6520f9e402.png

 
8de61479945cfe0d2e994dd004beb023.png

 
top one is current formulation
bottom one is the quaternion based one
ok so here comes a surprise
quaternions in some sense correspond to logic
this relationship i havent fully explored
ok so this is the current state of things
here comes a kicked
linear logic corresponds to dynamic classical logic
i.e. classical logic developing over time
there's this thing called dual numbers
which has this insane property of automatic differentiation
if you evaluate a function you get the value and the derivativea t that point
they are in some sense "dynamic numbers"
so there's this thing called dual quaternions
which is amazing for animation
http://www.chinedufn.com/dual-quaternion-shader-explained/
check the gifs
you can represent rigid deformatiions with them very easily.
they are insane because they represent rotation + translation however they are interpolable
linear algebra (the name similarity of linear logic and linear algebra pisses me off) is very much based on lines 
so like the guy on the left is getting deformed
due to compounding error
the guy on the right is smooth
dual quaternions are something called
a lie algebra
it's a rich one
there's a foundation of probability based on compact lie algebras
oh if i havent stated this yet
i believe that linear logic corresponds to dual quaternions
one of the reasons
is that they are both dymanic variants of their static counterparts
and because their respective cunterparts correspond
they are likely to be the same
i know that this wouldn't fly in certain cricles
however i look for many weak connections
rather than one strong one
so llong story short
i want to build a new computer with this
better quantum
h0p3
lol!
adamnemecek
currently all quantum computation is retarded
h0p3
yes
well, as I understand it*
adamnemecek
they use probabilistic signals to build bits
they have qubits
which are stil bits
we used to have analog computers
after ww2
with electriity
which is unstable
light is very stable
this idea exists
it's called continuous variable quantum computer
so basically you write your program in linaer logic
h0p3
(I am paying attention by the way; I'm having to google as you talk)
adamnemecek
and the rules are then translated to this photonic interaction
it's ok
ask questions
it's a lot to take in
and it's all very much like
back of the napkin
however those conversations need to be had at some point
so like
i have this obsession with light now
on a tangent
it's hilarious that despite all the differences al the world religions have
the one things they agree on is the importance of light
there's this verse in the bible
"This is the message we heard from Jesus[a] and now declare to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. "
it's from john
in islam
light is like a manifestation of god
the connotations it has are insane
h0p3
aye
it's a powerful symbol
adamnemecek
there's no life without light
like i believe that it's what turns unorganic matter into organic
so heres the thing
idk why the fuck a photon follows the same path as dna
its all a helix
i've been doing those a lot
a quaternion is a helix btw
or it's one of the visualizations
h0p3
ah
adamnemecek
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_angular_momentum_of_light
154459f1645bc092cacbcca5a1322558.png
h0p3
If I'm allowed to say something stupid: it reminds me of dialectics =)
anyways, go on
adamnemecek
it should lol
did you see the shader?
h0p3
what do you mean by shader?
adamnemecek
http://www.chinedufn.com/dual-quaternion-shader-explained/
h0p3
yes
adamnemecek
ok so i mentioned lie groups
they are this weird hybrid between groups and calculus
they are differentiable groups
fundamentally i think about them as like state machines with different behaviors along different paths
idk if this is entirely there
they have this weird property
that a*b=-b*a
note the negation
fundamentall it's because they preserve direction or chirality
h0p3
sounds like time
adamnemecek
that's a good insight actually
h0p3
ah, I hope I did not derail you by revealing I'm too ignorant to appreciate where you were going. I am trying to see it.
Also I must be extremely ignorant because I have assumed [type theory == logic == topology] (topics I barely understand) without asking why. 
adamnemecek
yeah lol
you are right
in some sense i was like
"no duh, of course it does"
it think it's the intjness
like i think we overgeneralize very quikly
but like
sometimes that's good
h0p3
epistemic survival
it's part of what makes us good modelers
adamnemecek
yeah i think so too
so it's intersting
linear logic really lets you reason about things locally vs globally
like reason locally about things with global impact
h0p3
that is exactly what I'm worried about
adamnemecek
lol why
you mean that you worry about local vs global?
h0p3
yes
adamnemecek
it's all realted to ownership too
so here's another idea
cryptocurrencies are a realization of a linear logical idea
like
h0p3
tell me why
adamnemecek
the fact that there's this public ownership ledger is ver ylinear logical
like, the whole ownership history is tallied up and is readily available
h0p3
aye
adamnemecek
you can locally verify transactions with a global view
and here's another kicked
do you know what double accounting is?
h0p3
no
adamnemecek
double entry
on so there used to be this thing called single entry accounting
it's old fashioned
you would keep track of your expenses and incomes
so you'd keep track only of the amount
then came double entry accounting
this was in 1400's florence
h0p3
double entry is the accounting I learned
adamnemecek
exactly
so you also keep track of the party you are interacting with
this created the idea of debt
which some believe was the reason florence flourished
h0p3
reasonable claim
adamnemecek
like rich people could now get stake in smart peoples endeavours
with debt exchagnes
crypto is tripple entry accounting
it allows for these
novel ownership models
that are like readily verifiable
linear logic has been used to model shit like permissions or capabilities in like computer security
h0p3
can you give an example of a novel ownership model that is readily available to all standard blockchains?
to me the blockchain's strength is in majority verification
That I can personally download the full blockchain and verify the ledge the majority agrees to doesn't give impressive permissions/capabilities until we start hitting things like Eth's VM
I'm worried the triple entry accounting claim is still over my head, I apologize
adamnemecek
one ownership model for example is like
i give you money but you can only spend it on xy
xyz
theres thisone crypto called enecuum that seems to use it
so linear logic also has these voting semantics
as a vote is a resource
consumable
and you need verification of like the uniqueness of the vote

fascinating
adamnemecek
linear logic is also the difference between a reference and a value
are you familiar with that difference?
h0p3
yes
shows up again and again in different places for me
adamnemecek
reference is unique
value is like classical logic
like you can make as many as you want
h0p3
I can see linear logic is worth my time! =) 
adamnemecek
i'mnot much of a philosophy person
i know some broadstrokes
in my german class we talked about kant like...infinitely
i think i just like have a bad experience
like you know how you hate things that were forced down your throat?
h0p3
aye
I'm one of those weirdos who thinks Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem tells us about the nature of our access to thinking about whatever isn't physics itself. 
My interest in dialetheias and now linear logic is also related to it.
trying to locally (physically) infer about the global (metaphysics) seems to be a core problem in philosophy
I realize, this may not be fun or interesting to you, but I want you to know why I'm interested in it, where I'm coming from, etc.
This is a search for meaning and purpose to me.
adamnemecek
no im very intrested
you like
touch upon some subject that like
i'm very unfamiliar with however with that amount of googling i do
ive come across some of these things
myself
but like
havent taken a deep plunge
h0p3
I want to form good questions about the infinite. =)
adamnemecek
infinite is interesting however non-infinite is also nice
lately ive been liking enumerable things a lot better than infinite
as infinity is kinda hard
but like
being handy with enumerable things can be very useful as well
h0p3
agreed
in fact, my only interest in the infinite is to help me understand the nature of the finite...the finite is in some sense my immediate goal
adamnemecek
ironically that's just evolution
h0p3
=)
adamnemecek
you evolutionary care more about the immediate
than the infinite
as the infinite
relies on the immediate
the survival of the race in some sense relies on it's immeiate condition
h0p3
My worry is that everything I can know or understand is computable, but the foundation is not computable (or that I can't understand what it means to say it is computable). If there is a "bob" turtle of "turtles all the way down," I'd like to evolve in how I continually learn to pick a better bob. 
I don't mind the "are you familiar with x?" INTJness issue, btw. I'm going to assume you know far more about the world than I do.
I probably won't be as useful to you, I'm afraid.
adamnemecek
a lot of it is based on like...idk 
these weird patterns that keep popping up
i'm generally very though with applying them
but i do miss some major things every now and then
ok here's a thought ive been thinking about all morning
i have another connection
so like you know logic quantifier
like there exists and for all
h0p3
aye
adamnemecek
there exists corresponds to min (or max)
it's like the condition that fits only one thing in something
in a set
ill draw a picture
h0p3
k
adamnemecek
actually i need to refine this a bit
it's anew thought
wanted to try it out
didnt quite fit yet lol
constructive solid geometry is dope
lemme send youa cpi
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry
1f0c2efbcf14c328bfade35d01a18963.png

 
dash is minus
then you have intersection and union
which correspond to min and max
you had a really good insight about chirality being time
do you know how many electrons you move when you execute one instruction
?
h0p3
no idea
adamnemecek
it's the order of 10^29 or so
h0p3
lol
adamnemecek
to add numbers
you move that many electrons
what a fucking waste
h0p3
which is why your quantum computer idea is very intriguing
adamnemecek
http://quaternions.klitzner.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Quaternions-Phoenix-Bird-presentation-v14.pdf
i feel like im in some sort of resistance group
like i feel like
people just idk
dont see...the truth
h0p3
well, I hope you don't think that I see you as someone who is contrarian for being contrarian sake. Finding the weird things and connecting them together is definitely not popular, but I hold the practice in high regard.
gotta say, the quaternion visual modeling reminds me of simulation in general, which I take the physical world to be (I'm not a philosophical idealist)
I assume quaternions are part of our brain's GPU for efficiently rendering a visual model of the world
adamnemecek
no lol
i'm just like idk
i'm also responding to people on hm
hn
and they are all idk
gimme proof
like quite a bit of flak lol
in the past too
whatever
however over time
you kind of get people on your side
h0p3
proof comes in degrees and kinds, and of course, "show me the math" is a high epistemic standard; it will be convincing
adamnemecek
will it tho?
like
h0p3
I'm not too worried about trying to convince them though (at least not yet)
adamnemecek
what are they expecting
i have some fundamental problems with mathematical epistemiology
proof by contradiction is a disease
h0p3
lol
adamnemecek
contructive mathematics for the win
https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07518
h0p3
I can admire than attitude. There is always something very ugly about negation intro, a deep-seated worry about what we are really proving to ourselves. 
adamnemecek
yeah
like
mathematicians in particular
they worship this security
that's like idk
like there's more to life than not questioning "epistemiologically safe" authority
h0p3
when you find the authority, please tell me
adamnemecek
there's none
that's the joke
h0p3
ah!
Surely you cannot mean that
not all the way down
adamnemecek
well here's the thing
you know like different areas can manifest the same idea differently
in some sense all people are the same
however culture has shaped you in soe way
ok here's another idea
h0p3
do you think that epistemic justification is internal to your mind or does it correspond to something external to you?
adamnemecek
people talk about logic too much and not enough about empirism
linear logic adds the emplrism to your logic
have you seen this backwards and forwards motion in like hmm or viterbi or smth

no, looking up
adamnemecek
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16255612
h0p3
I agree that it adds empiricism (to some degree)
adamnemecek
so linear logic corresponds to a tree
sorry no
classical logic corresponds to a tree
lienar logic corresponds to a graph
this is for example due to the value vs ref thing
like if you have a backarrow
it's due to you having a reference
like a tree can be value based
a graph needs to be reference based
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#Engels's_dialectics
like i legit feel ike the first two are right
the third one is wrong
in some sense
marxism is the extremum of classical logic
the one that doesnt account for identity
the one that removes identity as opposed to ...fostering it
you can model for example programming exceptions (like the control flow primitive) with linear logic
also concurrent object
and like
protools
and shit
there's this thing called session types
which is based on this
h0p3
Are you denying the end of evolution?
Are you denying a Final Synthesis?
Are you denying an Aristotelian Telos?
(forgive my ignorance)
adamnemecek
evolution: no, evolution is a byproduct
no need to apologize
as far as final synthesis, i think that like final syntheiss is an asymptotic idea
you will never reach infinity
despite trying to reach it yourwhole life
not enough time sorry
idk what final syntheiss really is sorry
h0p3
I cannot say I understand it either. I'm just trying to understand where you are coming from in denying the "negation of the negation"
I may have the wrong view on it, or at least not your understanding of it.
adamnemecek
imagine the negations are votes
you can have as many as you want
not not not a
means three people voted for not a
h0p3
k
adamnemecek
are you a programmer btw?
we should introduce ourselves lol
h0p3
only a hobbyist, no formal training
adamnemecek
i'm adam, im a czech living in los angeles
what do you do for living
h0p3
I used to teach philosophy at Tulane, but I now homeschool my children (sometimes do pipefitter and electrician work for extra money). 
I spend a lot of time on my wiki too.
was going to say on a sidenote, your Zipline program reminds me of a zsh plugin I use called enhancd
adamnemecek
lol
thx
it's something i've always wanted but there never was a language
i like the idea of rust however the platforms arent quite there
h0p3
yup!
adamnemecek
like i learn in a particular way
and like
i hate a lot of programming books
give
they've gotten better
like
what os are you running?
pick up a book on rust
and lik
idk how much time you have
but if you legit devote a month to it
you'll like...get quite a bit
and like
you'll be surprised
how many terrible programmers there are
you'll be at 40% in no time
and like trying to get to 100% is pointless
if you aim for 70%
you can get there
easily
and like
it's a useful skill
sometimes i feel like idk
you just cut through some data
and like
it's like having your own army in some sense
you know you want to
if you have any like idk hobby time
rust is a good investment
you are above your average c programmer just from the get go
h0p3
I was trying to learn it simply to help my 12 year old daughter learn it: https://philosopher.life/#Rust:Rust
adamnemecek
even an expert c++ programmer will get bogged down on so much shit
its getting traction
msft has a 60k line project
it's used by fb
a lot of the big ones
like the traction is undeniable
h0p3
It's getting more and more traction; I've followed it for a couple years now. 
adamnemecek
gaming studios are switching over
h0p3
The libraries are still not there.
and, it's very hard to find people who are capable of writing it
adamnemecek
that's the perfect time to get involved
like
here's how this workd
h0p3
that is a good argument
adamnemecek
i've contributed to firefox for ios
h0p3
I saw
adamnemecek
i know that if i want to i can get a remote job there
they havent merged a lot of my commits in
like
i have this script
all it does is trim whitespace at the end of lines
my first contribution to any project is i clone it run the script (takes literally 0.5 seconds) and i make a pull request within 15 seconds of cloning. 
if the accept it
i'm going to spend more time figuring out how much they care about this sort of stuff
i do a lot of refactoring
learn rust
contribute to some popular projects
you'll be a programmerin no time
h0p3
I saw in your HN profile
I may
considering getting AWS certs as well, since I enjoy that side of things quite a bit
adamnemecek
i think that github projects are nicer
like
idk i personally like to get my hands dirty
i hate this learning for the sake of learning
h0p3
how do you know what is salient to learn?
why are you learning?
adamnemecek
engagenement
if you have this persistent feeling
that something is worthwhile it generally is
if you are bored
it's probably stupid anyway
it's surprisignly accurate
h0p3
lol
adamnemecek
i'm not kidding btw
like
engagement is the one metric that matters
h0p3
I can't trust myself on that front. I've found that some things which bored me turned out to be very useful.
adamnemecek
do you care about all this shit?
h0p3
but, overall, yes, engagement matters

sure
however you might have come across those at some later time
when they might be engaging
and also
people in the past didnt' know shit
idk
h0p3
well, I'm searching for that which matters most before I figure out how to get there.
adamnemecek
i'm increasingly more distrustful of the past
skills are always good
like trying to be 1337 has been the one most significant thing
h0p3
=)
adamnemecek
part of me can't believe
that something like beling 1337
even matters to me
i ask myself every day
am i 1337?
it's like
idk
am i a poser?
h0p3
I want to be 1337, of course. And, I'm glad to have the skills and knowledge I do have, but to what end? What's the purpose of it? This is the thing I must formulate.
I'm not claiming I can solve it forever, of course, but I do need to come up with a view that is coherent enough for me, and for my children.
That's actually what my wiki is about. Give it time. My vocation is philosopher, but my occupation may eventually be programmer.
adamnemecek
idk for me i guess i want to setup a passive income so that i can devote more time to studies
you might be financially secure idk
h0p3
I am not secure, at all.
but, I am a man profoundly worried about making money ethically
adamnemecek
programming isnt' ethical?
augment the human experience
that's whattechnology is for
h0p3
tools are two edged swords...programming can be used for great good and great evil
adamnemecek
learn it to fight evil
h0p3
the majority of it, imho, is in service of evil
I do fight evil programmatically
adamnemecek
really?
ok good
idk
i think that like
i find some consolation in the craftsmanship aspect of it
i do agree
i use python for like text processing
h0p3
hell yeah
python, npm, and bash give me access to huge libraries...Rust isn't there yet
It's got a good foundation to build libraries though.
adamnemecek
it is there for certain problems
like
some algorithms have been impoementedin rust
that have never been done before
or like
were very academical
they are now implementedin rust
are you aware of piston?
h0p3

When it's actually used to build games, it will have arrived (that's one way to do so at least)
I think Rust needs another decade before it starts replacing ecosystems
adamnemecek
4 years
to a beautiful ecosystem
however
you can still become a general
when the system is ready
it's too late for you
h0p3
aye
adamnemecek
you can like command a small army
h0p3
again, why I am teaching my children now rather than later
adamnemecek
it's not too late for you too
children are the future in some sense
but in some sense
fuck the children
h0p3
my children are my moral duty
adamnemecek
they are
ofc
but like
you can minmax this
i agree with that 100%
h0p3
the philosophical issue is the thing worth minmaxing, computers are only a means, never the end
adamnemecek
correct
use them to amplify yourself
h0p3
I do. My daughter writes software to help me very often.
adamnemecek
it you believe yourself to be morally correct
lol
h0p3
I don't know about that*
adamnemecek
that's very cute actually
i would contribute to rust projects voraciously
idk
idk your life relaly
this is my strategy i guess
idk what i'm getting out o it
however
life seems to be accelerating
like the better my skills are
the more i enjoy my life
like
it is masturbatory in some sense
i'm working on this thins
thing
https://www.ngrid.io/
h0p3
I saw. It's already linked on my wiki.
adamnemecek
it's like...so fucing intellectually stimulating
nice lol
i see why you like your wiki
there's quite a bit there
i need some time to go through it

it's about 16mb of plaintext
adamnemecek
shit
that's a lot
i feel like
i wish i had the discipline
are you aware of amazon affiliate programs btw?
i find them to be a moral way of making money
i'm going to like start a book recommendation site
i read a lot of them
you can actually make quitea bit this way
h0p3
Why do you think it is a moral way of making money?
adamnemecek
i guess because i believe that promoting book consumtpion is moral
this is one of my strongest beliefs
h0p3
Book consumption and Amazon Affiliate programs are different
adamnemecek
world would be better off it you spent your formative years reading books 10 hours a day
are they?
h0p3
no doubt
My wife is a librarian, and I've spent a lot of my time pirating (and enabling piracy) for the past decade.
adamnemecek
i did too
h0p3
Making sure people have access is extremely important to me
adamnemecek
however i read printed books much faster
i do agree
i pirate still a lot
however
there are just so many books i really care about
that i need to buy them
i do agree it's expensive
however i consume printed books so much faster than digital
like
h0p3
my dissertation was against intellectual property, btw*...I have very little sympathy for it.
adamnemecek
it still feels like looking at instagram photos of food vs actually eating something
that's two of us
h0p3
My wife is also much more productive with print codex
It's kind of a mix for me
adamnemecek
i fought and did pretty well in a lawsuit brought forward by a movie studio
against me personally
my lawyer said
he's never seen them fold this fast
h0p3
Deep reading is valuable, I agree. I also require my children to practice what I call Hyperreading...which is searching, curating, finding the salience as fast as possible, etc. (you already know what I mean)
I think you need breadth and depth.
adamnemecek
lol i agree
i do that a lot
h0p3
I can see that
adamnemecek
i like the word hyper as well
h0p3
=)
Tell me about your interest in hyperspheres
Also, in our conversation, I've had to open two FF windows filled with tabs, lol.
This is one thing I love about i3...it gives me very good tab support for my firefox windows, makes a nice little tree
I've tried FF's tab extensions, but they are not nearly performant enough for me
Somethings are just handled better at the OS level
adamnemecek
haha ya
h0p3
to  your previous question, I use Manjaro
adamnemecek
are you aware of libgen
i assume you are
are you aware of books.google.com
i hate google
however i do use this quite a bit unfortunately
h0p3
aye
adamnemecek
i hate the product too really
h0p3
libgen is excellent
adamnemecek
👍
h0p3
library.nu was the Library of Alexandria, but libgen hasn't been burned down due to some federated asset management
adamnemecek
hahaya
h0p3
ebook.farm costs you something, but is worth it
I use myanonamouse quite often, especially for audiobooks
I've several search tools I use if i'm in desparate straights
but...my wife is a librarian, in charge of ILL, so I get all the books I want
it's pretty unfair actually
same for articles*
somethings just aren't on scihub, especially not sameday
I used to have a python script for scraping Google books...but
they put a stop to that
assholes
adamnemecek
yeah
h0p3
I was talking to my children about how you instantly guessed I was INTJ. I realize the lack of scientific evidence for MBTI, but running into INTJ's repeatedly shows me there has to be something to it (where personal empiricism still matters, especially as the foundations of modern academic psych are crumbling around us, yet again). Wondering if you ever have the same "spidey-sense" intuition for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_disintegration
adamnemecek
yeah lol
i dont go off off anything else
most of my lifes pain (there isn't like much you know but there's always some) comes from the fact
that whatever authority figure didn't let me trust my spidey sense
do you ever read up on hitler? ivebeen reading a lot of marxism and try to balance it out with hitler.
i think it's because in czech republic
people are still kinda obsessed about him
like
in a bad way of course
but like
in some sense i didnt' really understand that whole hitler thing until recently
i know this is a touchy subect
but this is just an academic interest lol
i guess he's a powerful symbol
ike instantly recognizable
almost as much as mickey mouse
the haircut and the moustache
the only two things that you need to behitler
kinda like mickey mouse outline
h0p3
I can't say I'm well-read on Hitler. I can't say I understand nearly enough about Marxism to understand how it can be balanced by reading about or from Hitler either.  Please, don't worry about offending my sensibilities though. It's an important subject to me, but I fully understand wanting to be academic about it. Most of what I learned as a boy and young man about Hitler and Marxism were pure propaganda. 
adamnemecek
i guess this might be a czech thing
like i feel like
my situation is in some sense explainable as the center between the two
h0p3
I have a hacker friend in Hungary who has told me a similar worry about Hitler issues with his folks.
adamnemecek
haha
hungary is siilar
all these countries are between russia and germany
and have this weird tension between the two
h0p3
aye
adamnemecek
the one thing i enjoy
is that both marx and hitler explicitely mention that czechs need to be dealth with
h0p3
lol
adamnemecek
so i'm like
lol
h0p3
those god damned czechs
adamnemecek
i guess i know who my enemies are
hitler is like, they are ethnically ok, but like the culture needs to be purged
marx was like
czechs and croats are counterrevolutionaries
it's funny like i've also started understanding idk the hypocrisy of a lot of western countires
like all the while concentration camps were in operation
there was this partially manufactured famine in uk controlled bengal
3 million people dead
kinda like stalins holodomor
i feel ike this is really offensive to some people
like in some sense
hitler was this extremum of this old world attitude
of imperium building
and ironically
that marked the end of that era
ironically and fortunately
and like
hitler explicitely talks about how the american treatment of indians was like a blueprint for his ideology
which isn't entirely off the base in some sense
like fucked up
but like

Do you think a charitable interpretation of Marx might be an apt description of the oscillatory whirlwind of Hitler's age (and perhaps again our own?)?
adamnemecek
yeah it's oscillatory
but oscillation isn't quite enough i think
h0p3
too binary
adamnemecek
it's ok,its smooth
i like sin and cosine
lie groups are all bout exponents
like exponent isnt' what people think it is
it's this weird thing that takes you from disrete to smooth
h0p3
on a graph I can see that
I believe
adamnemecek
yup
or state machine
ew are back to the tree vs graph idea
and reference vs value
h0p3
That's why you know it's important
adamnemecek
yeah lol
h0p3
if it keeps coming up again and again from many angles
adamnemecek
yeah
but idk what "it is"
h0p3
ha!
adamnemecek
like the core idea
adversariality
infinity vs finiteness
min + max
h0p3
sir, you are are pointing at it, and I cannot tell you what it is either.
From my research, I do not think we can
we can only get closer
adamnemecek
i hope i get to the bottom of this
h0p3
ha!@
adamnemecek
or at least die idk
having answered some of this
i really dont wanna die befor ethat
h0p3
we can only ever do our best
One of the fundamental problems I am wrestling with is how to decentralize power effective. Some kinds of processes cannot be decentralized or even federated. I believe we are in a race to solve this problem to preserve the human species though.
adamnemecek
linear logic
h0p3
yes, sir
adamnemecek
global vs local

i do a lot of window shopping on amazon
h0p3
=)
adamnemecek
my wish list is really "things to remmeber to pirate"
and buy if i find it worthwhile
h0p3
You are clearly a genius. If you ever need access and can't find it, please let me know. I will do my best for you.
you like cryptocurrency, so I'd like to tell you about my idea for a mesh network
because I think there is something special about it
on a standard blockchain, trust is the result of majority, hence the sybil attack
sharding has a ton of problems that related to it
my idea is to leverage the Tit-for-Two-Tats strategy to maximize trust among nodes in a network
how do you build a good version of i2p onion routing?
adamnemecek
i wouldnt go as far as to say i like it
it's more like
we are in the pdp-7 phase
i can kinda see anintel maybe
h0p3
fair enough
I mean to say, you see value in it then. It could be very useful.
As to Tit-for-two-tats (T42T), I see it as the game-theoretic description of The Golden Rule
in perfect competition, Tit for Tat is the correct strategy
but when you aren't in perfect competition, accounting for miscommunications and errors, enabling forgiving retaliation, seems to be at the core of maximizing utility
I'd like to see The Golden Rule implemented at a protocol level in mesh networking, where in we trade resources with each, literally building digital-social capital with other nodes
adamnemecek
https://ncase.me/
h0p3
yes
that's a great representation of it
Copykitten/T42T
adamnemecek
the trust one is a good one
it touches on some of this
h0p3
Giving people reasons to not cheat or be a bad actor in a mesh is super important
if most people are playing the T42T game without too much interference/miscommunication/packet-loss/etc., they will dissolve the power of T4T (or worse) strategies
adamnemecek
yeah lol
part of is due to like
loss of identity
your identity isn't preserved between games
so in some sense
you might be playing a repeated game
that doesnt seem repeated from your point of view
h0p3
well, I think of the viability of mesh networks I've used as iterated prisoner's dilemmas, and identities boil down to private keys
adamnemecek
you need an infrastructire to distribute these keys
h0p3
why?
adamnemecek
and this is where the hard part begins
h0p3
that could be an important thing to do, but I don't see the necessity of it
adamnemecek
you need a mapping from real world to digital identity
it is
h0p3
why not spin up my own key pair and start interacting...the nodes I'm connecting to are literally recording the iterated games of interaction with that keypair (and perhaps share that knowledge)
adamnemecek
how do you retrieve someones key
i have someones irl identity
how do i find their digital identity
h0p3
there are no IRL identities thus far
adamnemecek
there are
your life is an identity of sorts
all your decisions a
are you identity
h0p3
I mean to say, linking the keypair to my IRL identity isn't necessary at this stage
adamnemecek
i think that all of this needs to be somehow recorded however most of it needs to be private
i have high hopes of zsnark algorithms
h0p3
yes
adamnemecek
hey i really enjoyed our talk however my fiance is coming over soon and we need to do a bunch of errands
you know adulting
h0p3
have fun! =)
adamnemecek
i gotta clean up and shit
h0p3
will talk again soon
adamnemecek
let stalk again soon ok? thanks for the kind words, it's been very encouraging
a lot of sicentists are intps
and i soetimes cant handle the p's
h0p3
ha
adamnemecek
it's like i legit could't care less about whatever your standards are
i know what i know lol
8:07 PM
h0p3
as you saw, /r/badphilosophy lampooned; ignore the dicks...
10:15 PM

You've had an interesting life, btw. Been looking into you.
