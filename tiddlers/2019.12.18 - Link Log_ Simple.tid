* Think About It
** https://fieldnotes.resistant.tech/federation-is-the-worst-of-all-worlds/
*** Hol' up there Leibniz, blockchain. I agree with the general thesis, and that is what must serve as the foundation to federated representation.

*** For many, it's //because// they are human that we can dehumanize them. 
*** Constant and variable moral value problematic is a hard problem.
**** Without it, however, even this attack on dehumanization does not hold water.

*** Parts and wholes are different.

I think we have to have both.
