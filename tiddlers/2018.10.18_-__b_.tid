So, my daughter posed a question to me. What is my ideally minimalist diet? Basically, minimizing the kinds of foods & dr//a//nks, what would I like to have basically everyday? It becomes tricky when I can combine and deconstruct foods; sushi, pizza, and gyros have lots of components I'd be happy to eat by themselves. I will attempt to speak of atoms.

!! Atoms:

* Watermelon
* Black coffee
* Beer
* 80-90% dark chocolate

!! Molecules:

* Sushi
* Pizza
* Gyros
* Mole (muh favorite gravy)
* Lamb Curry

Now I'm hungry.
