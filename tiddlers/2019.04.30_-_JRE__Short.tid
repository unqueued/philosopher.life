//I'm writing this a day later. I forgot, and I fell asleep. It is much harder to remember now.//

We talked about work. My brother had to chase his apprentice around and explain some chain of command. I told him how my day went with the kids at home and school. 

He woke up groggy this morning, which isn't like him. New meds, probably. 

He's off the calorie counting train for now. I hear that. I'm terrible at this shit.

We'll be meeting halfwayish for the tradeoff. Cool.
