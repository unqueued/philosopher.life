Dear [[R]],

I'm sorry if my previous letter was offensive. I hope this one won't be offensive either. I really appreciate that you kindly offer me your perspective on family, faith, and life. As a side note, I've enjoyed talking with your brother, C, immensely. You both have a raw kindness and intelligence that I so rarely find. It makes so much sense why my wife is as awesome as she is.  

I am glad you are honest with me and at the same time not judgmental. It is something I'm still growing accustomed to and learning to do myself. It's a good pairing (and I take it to be a crucial element of empathy, the golden rule). I also appreciate that you want the best for me (even if we have perhaps different standards and theories of the Good); that's what love is about. It's relieving to have someone hear me. Thank you.

As a sidenote, I like that word: decompressing. It suits me. 

Now, I can't say I wasn't expecting your argument, and I'm sure you will say the same of me (I suspect we have both studied these issues for a long time). Without trying to sound arrogant (I'm going to fail), I want to say up front that I am aware of the family of arguments you've presented (which you probably know). I have taken these issues very seriously. It is what kept me faithful for so long. A significant portion of my training and upbringing has been devoted to understanding and answering the issues, frameworks, questions, and arguments you've presented. Philosophy of religion, epistemology, and ethics are at the center of my wheelhouse. It's what I did around the dinner table; it's what I focused on in church; it's what I ponder in quiet moments; and it's what I studied for 10 years in school. Essentially, I think I am skilled at empathizing with the point of view you've presented because I was born into it. I really have given it a fair shake. I believe C.S. Lewis would have met his match in me (our conversation feels a bit like the Screwtape Letters). I don't mean this as a useless appeal to authority. I think context is valuable.

For example, what I want my parents to understand is this: I really did it their way. I really took them and their view very seriously. I was faithful. It was my vocation and purpose. In an ironic twist, it was my faith that led me away from faith; that's how faithful I've been. I took the leap of faith, and all that happened was that I fell. As I stand back up, I think I see why.

Let me add two crucial caveats (and distance myself from judgment): (1) we all must have the hope that we can be right about what matters, (2) we may have different evidence. It is only rational for those with different evidence to arrive at different conclusions. I believe we are both justified in our positions (this isn't a claim about objective accuracy [which we may never achieve anyways]). Our beliefs are not accidental; we've really thought about them. To the degree we disagree, I take us to be kindly agreeing to disagree. I am convinced you are more skilled than I am at this (it is not naturally a part of my disposition), so please call me out if I'm lacking. That said, I think we clearly agree on an enormous amount. I admire the network of reasons and explanations which emanate from the axioms you take up. 

I also do not want to be dismissive or underhanded. I must be honest. If I'm going to be rational, it means I need to maintain charity and openness. It means I must have the integrity to revisit those ideas again, to accept I could be wrong, and to do my best to find the truth. Let me give it a fair shake again, and you can call me out when I've not. So, here is my good faith response to your extremely thoughtful argument:

<<<
We come at the same truth from different perspectives, so we must stretch to see things from each other’s point of view. I am hearing you, but as I am listening, I am convinced that I am hearing more than you hear when you listen to yourself. You are a deeply spiritually awake and aware person. It is that spiritual awareness that is causing much of your intense pain.
<<<

It is always possible I may not be hearing myself as well as you do. Confabulation, denial, willful ignorance, akrasia, confusion, and compartmentalization are real possibilities. I would not usually characterize myself that way, but I know I have made those mistakes before (as we all do). My goal is to be less wrong each day. Again, I want reason to guide me. It is the Categorical Imperative. 

I think it is important to define what it means to be "spiritually awake and aware." One of the crucial fork-in-the-road assumptions we must take up in order to define spiritual awareness is whether or not spirituality is real or epiphenomenal. What exactly are we "spiritually aware" of? Why should I think a spiritual dimension exists? I don't think I should formally beg the question (including my conclusion in my premises) here; although, maybe we should establish that first. Of course, we have to have a starting place. Bias, to some degree, cannot be escaped; it is part of our epistemic plight.

I have definitely had what are called spiritual experiences in church, in listening to and playing music, in love, in contemplation in the middle of the night, and even drug-induced.  That we can artificially induce spiritual experiences so clearly and effectively should give us serious pause. I have seen too many people speak in tongues and talk about ghosts (and I've seen the kinds of inferences they make, who they are, and why they are prone to these activities) to accept the spiritual dimension with so little evidence. That is far from proof that spiritual realism is false (which ultimately cannot be given), but, for me at least, it does shift the burden of proof onto the spiritual realist.

So, what were these experiences of? With each passing year, it becomes more obvious to me that the best explanation of the phenomenology of spiritual experience comes from a biologically-based Darwinian social theory of human minds and societies. The more I understand it, the more compelling the evidence becomes. I am convinced the actual causal chain which describes spiritual experience is reducible to having evolved to generate a specific configuration of chemical and electrical signals in my brain which I had long mistaken for spiritual experiences of actual spiritual objects/beings/dimensions.

I honestly believe my spiritual experiences were epiphenomenal (I'm still glad to have had them in many ways, but not all). Just because I have those feelings doesn't mean there is a spiritual dimension or any supernatural causes to them. The causes of these spiritual experiences are natural (a loaded word among loaded words). I hate to say it, but I am convinced this is the case for everyone I've met (but I do not see value in trying to convince people of this). 

I think spiritual people tend to be too prone to trust their feelings and intuitions (we all have to, to some degree; I am a pot calling the kettles black). I used to have a problem with this in itself because of how irrational I know we all are as finite homo sapiens. But, I see more value in it now. But, feelings and intuitions must be guided and shaped by reason. We must habituate the right disposition. 

I really did aim for strong moral character. The unexpected result is that my feelings and intuitions on this matter point me in the other direction by and large. Of course, I'm still prone to use religious language and imagery because that is part of the language I know. I don't have better words sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm still religious (well, perhaps it depends on our definition of religion).

Don't get me wrong. I think spiritual experience can be incredibly rational-appearing and many are justified in having them. It is a wonderful (and sometimes terrible) aspect of our brains. We are also extraordinary pattern-finders, but unfortunately, we're so overtuned for it (and naturally terrible at statistics, discrete math, and probability as a consequence [even famous mathematicians demonstrate this flaw]) that we see patterns, ghosts, and shadows where there are, objectively speaking, none (or we fail to see them as they are or as best as we could).

When I first entered into Apology, it was clear to me that the burden of proof (I prefer the concepts of "evidence" and "argument" here) in the dialectic rested on agnostics and atheists. But, over the years, I've found the burden of proof has shifted in the other direction. 

For me, my spiritual awareness is actually existential awareness (which need not be religious). Perhaps it is part of the Kierkegaardian storyline (but even he was wrong). It isn't God who has caused this awareness in me, but rather thinking about the concept of God that has made me so existentialist.

So, I agree with you that my spirital awareness is causing (or at least central to web of reasons for) my pain. However, I do not think we agree upon what counts as spiritual experience and what causes it. 

From my perspective, it is obvious that trying to be a Christian is not going to solve that problem. Rather, extracting the remaining irrational, cognitive-dissonance causing fragments of what used to be my faith (not all parts of what was my old faith were bad) seem like the more likely to succeed option for eliminating this pain. Of course, I may be doomed to have the pain no matter what. I'm literally trying to rewrite myself to erase the emotional pull of the ingrained remains of Christian spirituality (but not of the transcendent) simply because I know the road fails. There is no hope for me on that path. Perhaps it is a variant of the unforgiveable. 

<<<
As I see it, you define all that you recognize as reality by your senses and the extension of those senses through enhanced observation. You prove things to yourself before you believe them. What you cannot prove, you do not want to believe. This urge comes from a brilliant understanding of natural law and the inner workings of the observable world. You can, in effect, see things that others cannot see, so you reason that what you cannot see (figure, understand, define) does not actually exist. I get that.
<<<

I worry it is possible you've accidentally mischaracterized my position (the details matter greatly to me), and you've likely been too generous to me. I think the spirit of your words are accurate in important ways though. I feel compelled to clarify my position.

Let us be clear, I am neither an empiricist nor a rationalist. Kant's Copernican revolution in epistemology was right. I grant that my analysis of sense data tends to provide the bulk of my justified belief. However, we come embedded with innate categories. I also think our relationship to the "thing in itself" is far from clear (and incommensurable), and that we play a role, as subjects, in shaping our perceptions of a thing (and that this is an inescapable problem). 

Further, outside of the sense-perception necessary for consciousness (the passing of time, of self, etc.), I believe even a mind trapped in Cartesian solipsism can still make apodictic deductions (and otherwise!) without sense-perception. 

I would say I do not "prove" things to myself (this is a term of art for me; Proving is the act of providing a step-by-step demonstration that a conclusion deductively follows from a set of premises using pendantic steps which are thought to be certainly or virtually certainly true in a given epistemic context). I cannot hope to achieve certainty in almost all cases. Instead, I would say I aim for knowledge with a lower epistemic standard; I try to justify my beliefs with sufficient (and, of course, I spend a great deal of time defining sufficient for myself) evidence and inferences (or, at least that is my goal). I believe we all do, and I think that is the best we can do.

I think it is rational to require evidence and good arguments for our beliefs, especially for those which are most central to who we are, how we think and act, what we want, etc. What else should guide us besides reason? Why? We cannot escape the necessity of reason (yet another loaded word among loaded words). As a practical and theoretical matter, we must answer crucial questions for ourselves. What should I believe? What standards should I use? What is the groundwork of acceptable, rational, justified belief? Why? If these are the wrong questions, then how and why?

I also grant at the very bottom of our chain of justifying beliefs for our beliefs (illustrated everytime a child unrelentlessly continues to ask "why?") each of us will eventually find foundational beliefs we cannot justify. If there was a justification, we'd only go a layer deeper in asking for justification. It is an ancient problem. I buy that we have prudential (which doesn't make them objectively correct) reasons to accept a foundation (or coherentist foundation) of beliefs. However, we must continually test this foundation. We should inspect it very carefully. To be wrong here causes a tidal wave through our web of beliefs sitting on top. Again, we cannot be certain (by definition, perhaps). We can only unify ourselves here with the evidence we have. Sometimes we keep our axioms, sometimes we remove some, and other times we add some. We can only do our best. Doing my "best" points me in the direction away from Christian faith.

However imperfect it may be, I hope you see the pragmatism in my epistemic stance. Setting the epistemic partially aside, we need to consider the ontic (What exists? What is it that we have knowledge of exactly? What can we have knowledge of? why?).

I also want to make sure you don't see me as simply a physicalist, materialist, or mere naturalist. I don't know the answers to these crucial issues, of course, since this is a very ancient problem (that doesn't mean outmoded or obsolete). To be clear, I am convinced that metaphysical objects exist (a bold statement in contemporary academia). I am not convinced there can be truth-makers and bearers for logic and mathematics outside of something metaphysical. I say this carefully though because I don't know how it works. I don't even know what it ultimately means. I also believe I can't fully understand it because that's the nature of metaphysics. I take the transcendental divide seriously. I can only test the edges of and hope to briefly peer into that gateway, see the shadows on the walls, and hear the music calling through the chaotic mist, but I can never step over the threshold into that world. Of course, this sounds religious (it was standardly religious to me for a time [I'm open to saying I'm still religious about the transcendental]). It was Plato and Aristotle's "religion,"" and over two millenia, these notions were syncretized into the church, expanded upon, and further investigated (hence their resonance with my upbringing).

So, I do believe in things I can't see. I do not merely study the observable world (although, I think we strongly rely upon observation and deduction to reach the transcendental gateway). In fact, as far as I can tell, philosophy is fundamentally engaged in thinking about things which are hard (if not impossible sometimes) to see, observe, and understand. It is the bleeding edge of the foundation of what we do not know. When it isn't that, when what we didn't understand before becomes clearer to us, it breaks off into a new field of inquiry (the sciences, mathematics, economics, etc. [although, they never fully escape philosophical inquiry]). I take myself to be studying reality (poorly, at that), particularly what is relevant about and fundamental to reality.

Now I think I'm in a position to engage your crucial point: 

<<<
"You can, in effect, see things that others cannot see, so you reason that what you cannot see (figure, understand, define) does not actually exist. I get that."
<<<

I worry there are at least two interpretations of this claim to consider. The uncharitable one (which I'm not claiming you mean) I take to be the idea that I'm not open to the existence of things which I've not yet justified for myself. I hope it is obvious that I believe I can be wrong about what exists and doesn't, as well as about what is true and false. I would not have deconverted from Christianity if I weren't open to being wrong about everything.

To get straight to the point, take belief in the Judeo-Christian God as our example. I have said before that from the standard of epistemic certainty (the skeptic's context) I am an agnostic (as I am strongly convinced everyone should be). I do not know either way in that context. It is likely the case that we can't indubitably know either way by definition. From a lower, more practical epistemic standard (since we simply can't be certain about almost everything), I am an atheist (and I know others whom I take to be rationally justified in having faith in God, but their reasons are private and ultimately do not count as reasons for me). I believe I'm strongly justified in my beliefs. That doesn't mean I'm against the very conceptual possibility of God (although, I have studied that in detail as well, and it doesn't look good). So, in effect, I am open to God's existence, but I have very strong beliefs which, in my practical (non-skeptical) mode (the mode or plight in which I think everyone else finds themselves in), justify that the Christian God doesn't exist.

Of course, I'm willing to look at the arguments again. There does come a point though where it's okay that I don't, right? At some point, we should be able to say to ourselves that we've been careful enough to set our tent pegs down. It's prudential. At some point, it has to be rational to accept not believing (just as one might accept that it is rational to accept believing without certainty or maximal justification). I don't think I'm doing anything wrong by moving on from my faith. To ask for more seems to border on gnosticism or even misguided skepticism itself.  

The charitable interpretation of your claim (which is what I think you were saying) seems to be that I don't take up beliefs without justification. But, that's okay, right? There doesn't seem to be a better normative epistemic stance from what I can tell.

<<<
But what do you do with that nagging pull you call residual Christianity?
<<<

I'm extracting it. It prevents my unity. It is the minority of my intuitions and the least justified of them. This is an abductive version of proof by contradiction (so, not a proof, but similar). It is perhaps an application of Occam's razor. 

I believe I know what those keywords "nagging pull" mean. These are very worn battlegrounds in The Great Conversation which humanity has had with itself through history. I have definitely wrestled with it myself, and I still am. I must wrestle constructively though. 

Thus, I'm trying to wisely deconvert. That may sound like a contradiction (I would have said it was before, with the classic arguments and rhetoric to boot). In doing so, I'm trying not to burn my bridges. I see that I could be wrong, and I must leave room for that possibility even when I feel very justified. So, I'm shutting the door to open others, but I'm not locking it behind me.

<<<
Ask yourself why you didn’t rage at Santa Claus when you learned that he didn’t exist. Even if you grew up believing that his was just a sweet children’s story, the question is still valid. You might denounce him, but you are not angry with him because there is no “him” with which to be angry. The same goes for a whole array of fictional characters who were real to you on some level, but whose existence you know to deny. You might learn from them, react to them and even model after them to some extent, but you do not rail at them because they are not there in any real sense of the word.
<<<

You are right that I wasn't angry with Santa Claus. I raged at those who told me lies, half-truths, and knowingly unjustified claims (but I've done so without enough empathy). I will not be treated as mere means, deceived, manipulated, and made to serve the unjustified will of others. It is a form of brainwashing and psychic enslavement. I demand honesty because I'm a person with dignity who merits the basic respect owed to all persons. I have a claim right to resentment when others use me through deception. That said, in empathy, I see that others make mistakes, and so I do my best to forgive. It is not always easy to distinguish ignorance from malice (and I don't see why others are better at it than I am).

<<<
God is different. You can deny the existence of God (or, at least of the God to whom you were introduced) because you can neither define Him nor accept the definition of others for Him, but you can’t seem to shake Him. He doesn’t exist for you, but He relentlessly follows you around.

Put that in your pocket for a minute and ask yourself this: do you fully understand the natural world? I know that you understand it in a deeper and richer way than I do, but does it still hold any mystery for you? How does one grasp the concept of mystery when mystery is a rare commodity? So, look up from the natural world and consider the concept of “concepts.”
<<<

You have not established why God, as a concept, is different from Santa Claus. Further, it is concievable that there are people who are as moved by the idea of Santa Claus as I have been by the idea of God. Being moved by an idea is not the same as being justified in being moved by it.

It is not He who follows me, it is just the idea of Him that follows me (more specifically, has been embedded in my highly fallible mind and belief system over the decades). Yes, the idea of God, my faith, my upbringing, my life has a web of crucial inferences and mistakes in it that have caused me great pain, a pain far beyond Santa Claus. That doesn't mean God exists.

I'm not convinced God is chasing me around. I'm convinced I'm not even chasing God anymore. I'm convinced that in my chasing of the idea of God I've been chasing the transcendent (which is only worth chasing to some extent) or even less in some ways. If there is something like God, or whatever The Good is, I think it is radically different from what Christians have pictured.

Let's be clear: it isn't God that I cannot shake, it is the transcendental that I cannot shake. They easily look the same (I long thought they were). I think the Ancients, Kant, Postmodernism as a project (a revamp of the ancient tradition), and Gödel's Incompleteness Proof provide us the clearest indications of the transcendental. However, agreeing to the transcendental is hardly agreeing to the existence of God. This "thing" I cannot shake in my web of beliefs is not obviously God (particularly the Judeo-Christian stories of a Being) at all. 

Of course, I don't fully understand the natural world (or reality, both physical or metaphysical). The physical world still has its surprises and sources of pleasure too. The transcendental (metaphysics) is the mystery. I have to be stoic about this mystery, of course. I know there is only so much I can know about it (which only continues to cause me to ask and answer questions).

When I see something is difficult or perhaps impossible to understand, I ask how, why, and what about it makes it mysterious. I feel my way around it. I try to find its logical contours, limits, and extension. I try to see its structure and its relation to other things I know better. I ask what is possible and necessary, contingent and universal, mutable and immutable, etc. I attempt to openly and charitably speculate, try out different arrangements of possibilities, and see if I can make the pieces fit. I make the most sense of it that I can, and stoically accept what I can't make sense of. I take the best explanations and justifications available to me. I see no better way to handle or demystify mysteries.  

You are talking my language when you talk about the concept of concepts (you seem to speak of a variant of Plato's Great Meme passed down through Western culture), the being of being, being in itself, contemplation of contemplation, The Good, The Beautiful, the noumenon, the transcendental, metaphysics, etc. I can only speak with my poor understanding of that gateway which even the greatest minds in history can only point us towards. We stand on the shoulders of giants, no doubt. It is in my exploration of these very things that I have been persuaded that a personal Christian God does not exist. Further, even if God existed, I have no reasons to think it would be relevant to my practical life (outside of enjoying the mystery). To the extent that Boethius would be right, it seems like we have nothing to talk about (that's Trascendence with a capital T). In fact, the best explanations and justifications tell me to stop worrying so much about the transcendent (at least to some degree). At some point, demystification is fruitless. We are mere mortals. 

<<<
Do you believe that peace exists? I doubt that you have ever seen a moment of it in your life. I know that I haven’t. And yet we both chase it with all our might.

Do you believe in justice? How often have you seen it in pure form? But you reach for it, don’t you?

Consider for a moment that there is a layer of reality beyond the observable that we do not have senses to detect, but that we are bound to acknowledge because it resonates with something inside us that we can’t define. We are drawn to peace even though we don’t experience it. We reach for justice even though it hovers beyond us. We cannot see, hear, taste, touch or smell them. We do not have adequate equations to quantify them. But we know that they are there and we ache to be where they are. 

What causes that?

We are like air bubbles floating through miles of seawater trying to burst into the expanse of the sky. We are spirit-things surrounded by a constructed reality – we understand the reality around us because we are encased in it and we are equipped to sense and interact with it, still we cannot resist the urge to rise. 
<<<

I agree that we can never fully see, experience, or partake of The Good in itself. We will only see and experience shadows. It's the best we can do. Or, if we do not, then we cannot be unified. The Pure Skeptic is frozen and disunified (the Pure Believer has similarly problematic flaws). They must assume there is something worth getting out of bed for, even if they do it without justification, to actually get out of bed. We are driven by these axioms toward The Good. I beg the question in even seeking to be unified and happy (kinds, subsets, parts, and conditions of The Good). That these are worth pursuing must be axiomatic, since there are no other justifications for it. Note, of course, the Pure Skeptic is still correct to claim that we have established nothing objectively, categorically, or normatively true in our Human Plight (as is the Pure Believer). We're just assuming and deducing/inducing as much justified coherence as we can from those assumption. I'm okay with this step (I have to be, what else would I do?).

I'm okay with having the kind of faith which ultimately boils down to having unjustified beliefs that we just assume are justified. But, I must be extraordinarily careful about what I have faith in. Faith in The Good is not obviously faith in God, not even close. 

That "resonating" inside us is perhaps a kind of sense. Perhaps it is reason itself. If it is only emotion, then we are in a lot of trouble. Emotions are the blink-of-an-eye, guttural, instinctual reactions we experience (the virtuous and brilliant rely heavily upon them); they come from our innate programming and our conditioning over time. They are incredibly useful instruments. It's a central part of the human experience, no doubt. Whatever this mystery may be, to whatever extents our experience of it is rational and emotional, that resonance is our human plight. 

That there is this resonance we agree on. What is this resonance of? I do not see why others are more likely to be correct about the source, the experience, the causal chain, or the sufficient reasons for this resonance than I am. I wish I had an authority to turn to on the matter. I have accepted many authorities on this resonance. Most have fallen (some harder than others), and I with them. It is only rational to continue to increase the requirements for what I take to be authoritative, dogmatic, and axiomatic.

<<<
The sense of desperation in you is conviction. Now, let me redefine that for you, because you probably know the term conviction as a sort of shaming awareness of sin, and that is one of its functions, but that is not what it truly is. Conviction is a deep-seated spiritual awareness of a reality beyond proof. It is faith in its raw form. It is what Scripture calls the “measure of faith” resident in everyone created in God’s image.
<<<

I agree that I'm desperate, but I'm seeking not to be (at least to some extent).

I believe in the transcendental because of my evidence and axioms. I believe it is unwise to take up beliefs or be too blindly driven by our existential awareness (which may be of an illusion) without evidence, especially on matters this important. That which is not justified, I will do my best to eliminate. That which can be destroyed by truth should. I'm cleaning house because it is that very resonance that nearly ended my life. I must manage it more carefully and not be driven so foolishly by it. I admire, respect, and am always curious about the transcendent. I will always continue to think about it, but I will allow my reasonable doubt to shape and temper my pursuit of the transcendent now. 

<<<
[Redacted], you are spirit, and you are reaching for Spirit, but you are both attracted and repelled by your experience of God. You might blame that on your parents’ presentation of God, or on the way God filters through the muck of the world, but what really generates that angst is the way you – yourself – are experiencing God. It is so hard to see the wrath of which God is capable when we have so little experience with an inability to understand. We are used to working things out to a proven resolution, and here we have a problem that won’t resolve. How can a good and loving God permit – even generate to some extent – such obvious evil?  
<<<

I don't think I am repelled by the transcendent. I think I am repelled by how I've pursued the transcendent, about how desperately wrong the entire world is in relation to the transcendent, and about how little I understand of what feels important. I've been repelled by my life and the world around me.

I would not say I experience the transcendent, or at least not directly (since that is definitionally impossible). I think there are gateways, boundaries to our universe, and fundamental problematics in philosophy we can't resolve which point us to the transcendental. We can only see the threshold. We can convince ourselves it is there through reason (and experience it further through the corresponding emotions which result from habituating our fastminds), but nothing more. It is a kind of madness to pursue that which you know, by definition, you cannot have. I have long appreciated that contradiction. We pursue the shadows of The Good; it is our plight. My goal is to remove the contradictions, inconsistencies, and incoherence as best as I can. I think that is all I can do.

Of course, we are all half-blind (or worse) here. We have to make do with the shadows we see. I know I can be deeply wrong. I have seen it. So, yes, I cannot trust myself, at least not fully. I must do my best with that fact in my deliberations. 

<<<
Paul dealt with it in Romans 8:18-25 (NASB): “For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now. And not only this but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body. For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he already sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.”
<<<

We run into the problem of authority again. Why should I take Paul to be correct? Why should I take the Bible seriously (outside of understanding what it gets right in ethics, the historical lens, and it's enormous memetic popularity and influence)? Why should I think the Jews and later the Christians were correct? As far as I can tell, the evidence, the coherence of the world, the understanding of human evolution, the empathy with other cultures, understanding how anthropocentric and small we really are (and paradoxically must be to some extent), and my continual escape from the clutches of dogmatic gnosticism points me in the other direction. 

The resonance I experience may simply be different from yours. I am convinced that my agreeing to the transcendent, to hope, peace, and justice, to pursuing The Good, to being rational, to being happy, to being existentially fulfilled, to appreciating and living with our awareness of these things seems best done outside of Christianity. Christianity was an important starting place for a small percentage of the human species, but I see it is not the destination. Call it arrogant progressive revelation (or uncharitably: relativism [which I would contest]) if necessary. I call it a hermeneutic circle, but this one spirals.

<<<
Why is creation subjected to all this futility? In what way can any of this apparent barbarity be related to hope? God, we simply cannot understand!
<<<

I struggled with Theodicy for a very long time, among many related paradoxes of Christian faith (it has been the driving cause of my pursuit of the concepts of freedom, agency, and responsibility in metaethics). The evidence against God, particularly the Christian God (since that is the one I've studied most), is Legion. I have enough charity to set aside a space for the hope in the logical possibility (which is an incredibly weak claim in epistemology) of defeating those objections, however unlikely that may be. Again, when it comes to certainty, I'm agnostic. But, I cannot ignore the evidence. That would lack integrity, and I think it would be unwise.

Now put that in your pocket with the idea that this God is chasing you around and think about this:

You know the story Jesus told about how hard it is for rich men to break through to the Kingdom of God? Why is it so hard? It is because they have to lay down something they value more than anything else in the world, and they have so stinkin’ much of it to lay down! I don’t have that problem, and neither do you. 

Or do we?

What if the same rule applies to other forms of wealth? A wealth of knowledge, of intuition, of creativity, of intellect… is any one of these easier to lay down than a few billion dollars? I think not. We are very accustomed to leaning into our own strength, and we have seen it topple all the problems we have turned it on. All, that is, but One.

What if your greatest strength is your greatest impediment to knowing the God you cannot stop seeking because He is relentlessly seeking you? What if the fact that you cannot understand Him is compelling you to deny Him when you cannot deny Him without denying yourself? What if I told you that that is the extreme end of every gifted person’s quest for (flight from) God?

I interpret the rich man as being unwilling to sacrifice himself, his happiness, etc. for another or something greater. It's not simply a story of giving up something we value; it's about overvaluing ourselves in particular. I wouldn't say that is precisely my issue here (although, I'm obviously deeply concerned about being happy after my deconversion).

I am willing to sacrifice myself. I am willing to die and suffer for the right reasons. I believe I have the integrity to do that. But, I have seen that I must be wiser in my selection of what I'm willing to sacrifice myself for. We must be wise in what we devote our lives towards.

I agree that intelligence is a kind of wealth, but I think it's a very special kind. Intelligence is directly what allows us to be wise, and wealth less obviously so (indirectly and instrumentally, to some extent, yes; it's hard to be wise when you are starving).

I agree my intelligence is an impediment to Christian faith (although, not an impediment to the belief in the transcendent). But, I don't think this is a bad or wrong thing. I do not think I'm being unwise. In fact, I think I've been unwise to be so faithful for so long. Being unwise means you aren't really being very intelligent in crucial ways. Wisdom is a specialized kind of practical intelligence, knowledge, and effectively trained emotional reactions. There are many things which I'm not intelligent about, and I've made many mistakes in this arena. As you point out: I know what I've seen though (although, I mean to say this in the sense that: I cannot unsee what I've seen. The evidence is overwhelmingly convincing to me).

Why should I think agreeing to and being moved by your claim would be wise of me? Ultimately, we cannot escape Reason being the core of the wise decision procedure. To be clear, this is not the claim you are unreasonable; far from it! You are clearly brilliant and have walked these paths many times. I think our reality maps fundamentally differ though, and so, in being as reasonable as we can, we choose different paths.

I do see myself as being in a rare (but not unique) position. Not everyone has the chance to see what I do, and so I have given serious thought to how others in my position have made progress and how they handled these existential crises. I have spent a non-trivial amount of time researching the search for meaning in the lives of gifted people. Not all journeys are the same of course, but I think they may provide footholds for me to learn from. I still must test it with reason though (not that I'm perfectly rational or the arbiter of what counts as reason for others); it must click with me; it is the only wise decision I see. I do not know how to reason myself away from reason, except insofar as it is necessary for reason or wisdom. I am neither convinced the Christian God is necessary for reason or wisdom, nor am I convinced that the Christian God is the fitting result of my reason and wisdom (however poor it may be).

In the end, you come to the realization that you cannot reconcile God with the natural world any more than you can blend the sea with the sky. You just have to decide whether you will recognize yourself for who you are – an air-bubble transforming into your true self above the reality around you – or a part of the reality encasing you and divorced from the sky. No matter what you decide, you will rise. All you are deciding now is how the air above you will receive you when you are freed from this present reality.

I think it is in my realization of what I am that I have come to terms with and felt a peace about my loss of Christian faith. I have also studied PK's and MK's; there are several consistent tropes and patterns I see in us. It is the best option I can find in my context. That doesn't mean I'm certainly right, of course. It could be temporary and lacking. The pursuit of the transcendent will always be incomplete.

<<<
I believe that you will make peace with the God you are presently denying, because I am convinced that you are too mentally honest to do otherwise. I pray that God protects you and your family – my family – in the process. I would tell you to stop making it so hard on yourself, but that would be like telling you to stop breathing the air. This is your journey. I would not presume to drag you along it even if I could. But can you see my little light shining from where you are? I am a bit further along on a very similar journey. I am listening to you. I am praying for you. And if you need me, I am here.

​Now that that's said, I can get back to my listening, and you can (I hope) get back to your decompressing. (You knew I was a preacher, and that preachers preach, right?) Still, I want you to be heard and to know that your journey matters.

It is clear that you understand much of my cry and conflict. Few see it as well as you do. I feel indebted to you for taking the time to respond to me and to empathize with me. I mean it with the same heartfelt-movement I experienced when I was still Christian when I say: I see Christ shine through you. 

I definitely appreciate the desire to save my soul. I think it shows incredible kindness and empathy. It's an expression of love. 

I know it is not easy to talk to me. Lots of people think I'm an arrogant prick (although, thankfully, not everyone). Of course, convincing me is not easy (I would know). You may feel like you are arguing with a brick wall. I can only point to who I have been and say: I have obviously been convinced by many arguments over time. I have changed a great deal and will continue to do so. I am listening. 

Thank you.


Love,
