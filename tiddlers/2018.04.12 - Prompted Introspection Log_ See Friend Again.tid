title: 2018.04.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: See Friend Again

!! Who is a friend you haven't seen for a long time but would like to see.

[sic]

As usual, we run into my normal friendship definition problematics. Setting those aside, just gut-checking here, I would very much like to meet a girl I knew as Carrie (I don't recall her last name anymore) from NY. On my female donor's first PhD program, we lived for a year on campus with families from around the world who were all getting the same evangelism degree.

It was a difficult but interesting time of life. Carrie was actually cool and sane. I wish I could find out how she's doing. 

Her dad was kind of fucked up (her mom was in the program). But, let's be real, everyone at the seminary was fucked up. I really hope her life turned out well. I think she was legit a good person, and she was smart too! In a weird way, she was a template for my wife.
