Hey I meant to message you yesterday. I hope everything was OK I wasnâ€™t able to stop and see I had to be to work at seven and it was probably about 642. I did see Esteban come out so I hope he was able to help.

Iâ€™m sorry to hear that! Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve made some great memories with it! I am so far I am finally back home havenâ€™t really been here much since last Thursday. Today is my first day off since. Yes I do go back to my normal schedule on Monday. I am planning on just resting for the rest of today and tomorrow I do have a pretty severe cold. But I went last night first thing and stocked up on medicine orange juice and soup
