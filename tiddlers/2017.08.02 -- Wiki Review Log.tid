* [[2017.08.01 -- Carpe Diem Log]]
** I fell asleep around 9:30ish. I think depression is setting in again. I think I should still chance the DCK on Sunday. I really need it. I'll have 7 days for it to clear my system, and I strongly doubt they will test it. None of the standard panels do. This is a worthy risk. Also, my THC test was passed with 8 days.

** I am not offended by bad words. My goal, of course, isn't to offend people. We will always be inventing new ways to do that, of course.
