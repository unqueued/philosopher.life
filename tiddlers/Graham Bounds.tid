Sir Graham Bounds,

It has been a long time since we last talked. I was in crisis at the time (and I've been clawing my way out for years). You seemed to be doing well though, and I hope that trend continued. I don't know anything about who you are now and what you are up to (besides what Google tells me). I would like to know.

Looking back these years later, I want to say thank you for being my friend. Whether or you realized it or not, I learned a lot from you. You never seemed to have a problem with my autism (which I didn't know about myself until embarrassingly late in my life), and you were absurdly charitable (like any good philosopher). You helped teach me epistemic humility (I can't say I was a good student), and I'm very grateful to you. Thank you! 

I've quietly debated whether or not I should contact you about what I'm doing for some time. If I shouldn't have, or I'm wasting your time, I'm sorry. That's not my goal.

I've been drafting a weird piece of philosophical artwork for a couple years now. Perhaps it is absurd art and bad philosophy (which no doubt says something about its creator), but I work hard on it (like I'm obsessively playing a video game). Even though it's just in its infancy, it means a lot to me. I hope it will take me a lifetime to complete. I want you to know that I'm dedicating part of it to you. I think I had the will-power to start creating it because of several conversations we've had over the years. It's been a journey, and I wouldn't be walking this path without your help.

In case you wanted to see it, you can find it here: https://philosopher.life/. It's contained in a single html file (~14mb in size); it's meant to be viewed on a computer with a 1080p screen.

Also, I've been going through Cogburn's new book. I've not contacted him about it, but I'm increasingly sympathetic to his view. You are mentioned in it, and I'd like to know your thoughts on it.

Sincerely,

h0p3
