Have a great day [[h0p3]]!
THU 8:42 AM
You too =)
THU 9:35 AM
How was your mental health day?
THU 9:36 AM
Not bad! Could use another tbh. XD
THU 10:16 AM
How are you?
THU 10:16 AM
Lol. =)
THU 10:20 AM
I'm good. Grinding away as usual. That wiki aint gonna write and right itself.
THU 10:21 AM
My dream log from yesterday was interesting. I have finally engaged in lucid dreaming.
THU 10:22 AM
Or, rather, I have sufficient evidence of it for myself.
THU 10:22 AM
How was it? :o
THU 10:50 AM
I have no control besides what I say to myself (though I'm not sure to what extent I control that either). My inner monologue is clear as day though. I enjoy talking to myself, so it was pleasant.
THU 10:51 AM
It felt like solipsism.
THU 10:52 AM
I’m terrified of lucid dreaming because I used to struggle with sleep paralysis.
THU 11:03 AM
Neat! err...that sound terrifying.
THU 11:04 AM
I'm sorry!
THU 11:04 AM
(it's still fascinating)
THU 11:04 AM
All good. Been a couple years since my last episode. I’m pretty sure it was anxiety induced.
THU 11:04 AM
Having [[L]] next to me fends off the existential dread. :sweat_smile:
THU 11:04 AM
=)
THU 11:05 AM
Idk why but the smiley is cracking me up. :laughing:
THU 12:23 PM
Lol!
THU 12:27 PM
I think it's a sign of empathy that you interpret it strongly!
THU 12:28 PM
Sometimes emoticons seem flat to me. It's awesome when they pack a semantic punch in them.
THU 12:29 PM
Btw, what you up to today?
THU 12:29 PM
Work and school! Gonna raid tonight with our single friends. :joy:

Yeah I try to use emoji in an appropriate way because several people have told me that I’m super bad at conveying tone over text.
THU 12:59 PM
Apparently I come off as mean a lot of the time.
THU 12:59 PM
That is not my experience, at all.
THU 12:59 PM
Raiding sounds awesome.
THU 1:00 PM
For the record, you are highly conscientious to me.
THU 1:00 PM
And, you are kind (which is not the same as merely being nice).
THU 1:01 PM
One of my goals is to learn how to speak fluent emoji.
THU 1:01 PM
That means a lot to me [[h0p3]]. Thank you.
THU 1:03 PM
It’s certainly an art form. Haha
THU 1:04 PM
