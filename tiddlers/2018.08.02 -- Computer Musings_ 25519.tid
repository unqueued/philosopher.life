I'm annoyed with myself for not keeping some of my source files. I've generated pubkeys from private before, but it is surprisingly hard to find resources to do this. Odds are, the thing I want to do is a big nono in cryptography. 

Last time, I did this in Go. Ugh. I wish I kept it.

`./mkp224o -s -d res3 hopewiki -t 4` is about the same as 8...

Forgot I had to install libsodium-dev on Ubuntu.

`/mkp224o -d res3 hopewiki -t #` with "Watch for activity" from Terminator is super useful.
