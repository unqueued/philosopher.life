title: 2019.11.29 - Prompted Introspection: Kind of Pet

!! What kind of pet would you most like to have?monkey, snake, goat?why?

I like my answer in: [[2018.03.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Preferred Pet]]. 

Okay, if money and emotional energy are no object, I'd much prefer monkey to all others. I think the primates are fascinating. I might share a lot of DNA in common with a banana, but I share a fuckton of my essence with a monkey. I'm a caveman, so the monkey and I are already part of many of the same tribes. Monkeys are not the most intelligent, but I'd like to have the freak on the end of the bell-curve (just cook one up in a lab for me, please)

I'm hoping I could teach my monkey how to do a secret handshake with me, I'd like to use psychedelics with it, I'd teach it all the wrong colors (that's "red"), it would take walks with me, and I would get to be its bodyguard. Oh monkey, I'd give you piggyback rides, find you monkey-porn, collect all the dumbest monkeyshit we could find, and we'd eat fruit together (I really like fresh fruit). Most importantly, I would get you the coolest goddamn typewriter of all time (it would be a mechanical keyboard). We would practice writing in our wikis. The Monkeywiki. I'm calling you "Bill," dork. I hope you like to swim and meditate.
