title: 2019.11.10 - TDL: Dump & Jump

* If car wasn't jumped, you need to do that.
* CC & Retirement
* Your daughter has a technical problem to solve, but your son doesn't. Gotta find something practical for him to make or fix, homie.
** She also needs to have her laptop setup before the move. I would prefer there was no gap or problem.
* Need to acquire boxes (have time though). For many reasons, their room should go first. They are going to drive you insane, and you know it.
* Keep dumping and writing.
