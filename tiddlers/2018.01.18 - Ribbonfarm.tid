I re-read this section and talked about it with my wife. I'm having a hard time seeing why this is accurate. I know this man is very intelligent, but I worry we are in metaethical territory that is too deep him (and us all, of course).

runaway sort of self-reinforcing positivism

Gorgeous line. His framework for distilling populations is fairly reasonable. His philosophical framework, however, is not obviously a good one.

<<<
pessimists view optimists as ignoring the darker consequences of change, and optimists view pessimists as purely inertial forces.
<<<

Case in point from above. As I always say: //Reality is darker than you are willing to recognize, but it could be brighter than what you can imagine.// Asking my cousin about it.

<<<
doubletalk is at least better than doublethink.
<<<

Maybe. There is a lot of doubletalk in his argumentation, and he admits it. I wonder why. Should I be more Straussian about it?

He has pessimistic "no free lunch instincts."

<<<
The Dehumanization Loop
<<<

He knows how to entitle. He has a weird problem in trying to be slightly evil. He wants us to keep people fully human but still be evil. I suppose I ride this line as well. Putting on warpaint as a pre-emptive subconscious strike against those who would not treat us with the respect owed to all humans, etc. There is a just-war evil approach that I take up. 

<<<
from A. G. Lafley: “A CEO’s job is to interpret external realities for a company."

...

This is also the reason leadership is often described as a lonely job. Your job is to survive a lack of incoming empathy and generate a positive atmosphere and empathy for others under your “information protection” umbrella. You yourself become the reservoir of harsh reality information that is yours alone to handle.
