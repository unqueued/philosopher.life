!! What are you afraid of? Why?

Maliciously ignorant people. On average, they choose to make the world worse. That's such a trite, [[arrogant]], reductive, completely ridiculous answer; only a philosopher would be delusional enough to dare utter such a thing. [[Virtue is Knowledge]], of course. Evil will still occur even in a world in which everyone is perfectly morally virtuous (a la [[fff]]itude qua "ought implies can"); there is never cosmic justice in that sense. Unfortunately, evil is exponentially worse and tragically harder to reverse, fix, or prevent due to pervasive malicious ignorance. Even when I lower my bar as far it goes: most people make me afraid to various [[dok]], particularly for those who aren't.
