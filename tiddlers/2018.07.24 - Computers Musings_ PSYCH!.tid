title: 2018.07.24 - Computers Musings: PSYCH!

I'm working on a ton of things today. This is my version of [[Wiki Audit]], but instead it's about computing. Yay!

I clearly need to key super as my mod key for i3 since it should overide everything.

Learning [[i3]] clearly is about learning a collection of [[Leet Tools]].

hello [[Terminator]]. I need you in my life.

xorg-xev installed. Fn key can't be used as super.

Started cleaning up [[.i3/config]] and organizing it. I'm going to rice my own config file hard. I want to love being inside it.

Trying to get my chillun to have backups of their dotfiles too incase they bork things.

Setup firefox for more sessions. The fact is that I don't want to be stuck with 3. 15 seems like a safe number.

Terminator is now my default terminal.
