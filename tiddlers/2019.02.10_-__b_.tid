title: 2019.02.10 - /b/

Take my URL domains from me, I'm still going to find a way to be heard. Try to destroy my face and my voice; I am the only person who can show you who I really am. Automatically monitor my communications, and I will attempt to balance my praxis between burying myself in privacy sufficient to monkeywrench a society that punishes us for not being more exploitable while being sufficiently open and honest enough to be myself in [[Finding The Others]]. If at all, ask yourselves how you would answer this letter or wished you answered it 10-years from now.<<ref "2020.02.10-1">>

I meet a whole lot of people who claim to want privacy, but I meet so few who really do anything about it in their lives. I don't think they mean it.

Make no mistake, I think people are genuinely more immoral than moral most of the time. I don't think they even aim to play by the [[Tit For Tat]] strategy in the vast majority of iterated prisoner's dilemmas. 

I think people are profoundly apathetic, indifferent, and to some non-trivial extent, purposely ignorant on the matter.

<<footnotes "2020.02.10-1" "It's a commitment, no doubt. I'm tired of a world which aims to be exploit ephemeral identities; integrity is quite costly. Despite dealing with some unsavory problems, attacks even, I'm incrementally feeling safer that I won't be silenced or persecuted. Yet, I prepare for it. I'm not an easy target to find, thankfully. If Trump is elected again (and perhaps even if he isn't), and if history repeats itself thoroughly, then I may have a serious problem.">>
