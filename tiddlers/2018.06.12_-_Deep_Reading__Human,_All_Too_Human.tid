title: 2018.06.12 - Deep Reading: Human, All Too Human

I see some amazing one-liners from Nietzsche, and there are moves in his existentialism which I find fascinating. He clearly has a profound point of view. Forgive me for being incredibly slow to assent to relativism of any kind though. Philosophers are looking for the object in objectivity, even if they know they can't have it.

This book feels like I'm reading poetry or Hume, which I know most readers adore.

Fair enough. Philosophy in general is also that, right?

He doesn't seem to care for metaphysics. I realize it smuggles in too much; it's the weaseling vessel. But, unfortunately, we must have faith at the very bottom. Logic demonstrates the limits of language to us, to the nature of the computable (and thus the empirical). It's a powerful device that can show its own limits (well, to some limit) and demonstrate it isn't sufficient. Metaphysics appears inescapable to me.

You have to forgive me. Both in religious and academic philosophical circles I've participated in, this author has been frowned upon (anathema to some). I'm doing my best to see why he has something valuable to say beyond what I already agree to in his work. I know there are other circles which worship this man's work.

Perhaps I'm too lazy to care about this book. I'm 50 pages in, and I'm just not seeing what's crazy valuable here. I must be blind or something. I expect to see some real strikes come out of a book on aphorisms, and I'd hope to see an even more systematic point of view emerge from it. I hate to say it, but I've gotta go with my gut. I have a finite amount of time and energy, and I don't see the point. I'm going to say "no" to myself here.

I'm going to chalk this up to my incompetence on multiple fronts.
