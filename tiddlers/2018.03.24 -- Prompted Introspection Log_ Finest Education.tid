title: 2018.03.24 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Finest Education

!! What?s the finest education?

/giggle

For whom, in what context, regarding what, given what standard of the good of "finest education?" 

Seems like getting jacked into //The Matrix// chair to learn Kung-fu among everything else is pretty bad ass. Pushing the limits of physical possibility, I suppose transferring our minds into arbitrarily large/powerful computers would enable us to learn about things that simply couldn't have been learned in any other way and perhaps also learn everything faster, with the right qualities, in the right ways, etc.

I don't know. This question is deeply philosophical. It's at the heart of what it means to be as philosophical as you can be. I'm desperately searching for it (or at least, so I think I am). 

Does it have be enjoyable, satisfying, useful? My initial questions require answers. Without it, I cannot give shape to a plausible answer.
