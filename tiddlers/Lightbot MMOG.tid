title: Lightbot MMOG

Virtual Reality Bot MMORPG

Gameplay:

* Must program to run at first. Must also be necessary in mid/late game grinding.
* Start with Light bot. 
** Great teaching tool
* Have hotkeys/buttons to call particular scripts. Needs a text editor.
* What about a directory/tree structure to hold and call scripts? Make it simple to organize them. 
* Zones can have puzzles maybe. You should be rewarded for passing puzzles.
* Experience gain for levels? 

Technical requirements:

* PGP keys to verify who you are. Would prefer one key to rule everything on your ID. Your bot could still have a name. Would need to be unique, somehow. How?
* I2P network for anonymity 
* Decentralized, consensus and/or individual server oriented? Seems like centralized, on my own servers, is best. Could still figure out innate loadbalancing mechanics. So, centralized cluster of my own servers.
* Persistence over time
* Gamestates output in text, allows you to play the UI you want to play
* Bitcoin, could have an ingame mixer. PGP and Bitcoin addressbook in game. 
* Modding (lots of options here)
* Do I want to make money at this, and how?
* Only someone with master-game-GM PGP key can do certain things in the game, I assume. Clients will just be hacked though. Might need servers to do a lot of work here.
* Bitcoin to play with other players?
* New account keys need to be signed by GM-Key. An account key costs bitcoin to use. Monthly bitcoin cost. Dirt cheap.
** If they stop paying their key/account stops working. 
*** Bot persistence/account freeze. They can pay to bring it back online.
* Client needs to be retarded simple. It only accepts:
** Bot commands
* Bitcoin prizes? PvP, PvE? Percentage of income. 
* Clients might make a huge botnet, Sybil attack on i2p a well. 
** A bad option.
** Would prefer to make it so that other people can just make their own clients
** A “bring your own client” kind of game. 
* EVE Online
** Randian rules, universe inside.
** The anonymity makes it randian too. 
 
Hardware, dev.

* Development would need to be done with at least a VPN.
* Server
** ProxyHam
*** Throughput problem? Need a very small connection footprint per player.
** VPN (bitcoin this one)
** I2P
