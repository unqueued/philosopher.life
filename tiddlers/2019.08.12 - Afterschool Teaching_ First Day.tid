title: 2019.08.12 - Afterschool Teaching: First Day

Whitney was making copies when I arrived. She looks flustered. She's in charge, so I can appreciate the stress she must be feeling. We're playing it by ear, loosey-goosey, and going with the flow, yo. I'm doing my best to alleviate her stress and think alongside her. 

She's coming to grips with taking 6-8 since she has handed 5th to me. Her interest in status quo hierarchical reasoning continues. I am, ofc, a pain in the butt. I've gently asked her to maintain an open mind, and I  think she'll see the reason in it.

Delp has very likely instructed her to stick with the rules to the letter. He has done this many times, and I don't believe his motivation anymore.  

Matt is clearly nervous and holding onto some kind of role here too (I know there was discussion about his tutoring, which would be good). It will likely dissipate, but we will see.

It is amazing to be back. Maybe I'm caught in limerence, but it's wonderful to see my children again. I'm sure most are not happy to see me, but it's good to see them again. 9Cf and 9Gf are back this year to be helpers. I got to prepare our food and serve my children. It is my honor. 

I am not allowed to be wise with our food yet since Whitney wants to stick to the stated plan (which means a lot will rot) even though it means we may not have enough in the end. I will continue to nudge and strike when I can.

Lots of first day orientation stuff. I took the 5th graders afterward (who outnumber everyone else together) and gave them a detailed breakdown. I assumed full control in this case, sniping and shaping. I hope I have enabled them to make reasonable predictions and understand my expectations.

Aside, they were impressed that I knew their names, but I don't think they know how bad my memory is. 

First impressions to overcome:

* 5ABm has a unique pronunciation. Active, hangs with the problem boys, but he's not problematic.
* 5TBm has an attitude. He doesn't want to pay attention, and he knows he is being babysat. I'm having to call him directly.
** He has a damaging approach with others. I must soothe and teach him to be gentle.
* 5DB1m, don't forget the "a". I will not be forgetting his last any time soon, sir. 
** Hates the food we serve, and he seems to like computers. Do the Dew, son.
* 5DB2m faces a problem. Immediately veering, and hangs with a child who refers to himself as Bob jokingly. He hides, and I will need to give him space without allowing him to be corrupted. The threat can probably be neutralized.
* 5SDm is a fast talker, explosive, irreverent, knows he's smart, interrogates incessantly. I adore it. As long as he isn't an annoying readleader. 
** I snap back fast with him. He will learn epistemic humility yet. 
* 5CF2 was a no show. 
* 5CF1 isn't in 5th. Whitney couldn't know.
* 5SKf asks solid questions, plays the conversation train language game well, and was quietly intelligent. Enigmatic for now, but could fit my archetypes. 
** She hangs with my namesake, and she's similarly headstrong. Loves skating, claims to want me to teach her about computers (asked for it before I said anything). 
* 5CMf has a face that lights up and pays attention. She is heavily conditioned, but she is kind. Plays games with others nicely. Depends on how her approval-seeking works.
* 5HMf is 7CMf's sister. You can see it in her face. Her mother is prominent in both. Her accent and commentary were wonderful. She is a street kid, and I will give her everything I can. If she needs an ear, I hope I will be it.
* 5ENm is a firecracker. He is the most difficult of all my students. Punk, short, beautifully hateful and so over it. I hope to be of service to this human being.
* 5ANf is shyish but then arrogantly imposing in others. I must be careful not to critique her ineffectively.
* 5KPf and didn't seem to have enough interactions for me to gauge anything about her. I do not know what this means.
* 5RPf is spunky with manners so far. She paid attention.  That cannot be easy because I am not fun to listen to.
* 5KRf is 6JR's sister. I guessed all the relationships before I asked them, but I was glad to have the chance to verify my hunch and gauge their reactions.
* 5JSm is tiny, "yessirs" me to death, had 3 occasions of hierarchical respect displays, and listens. Front and center sitter. Defensive around others. I complimented him.
* 5ASf was a no show. I will find out, I hope.
* 5AOf is very specific about her name. Deep-set eyes, tiny, part of the library gang, and I must give her much thought.

It was lucky enough to see the Elder Janitor and [[gh057]] today. We lightly shot the shit for a bit, and I thanked them for their work. It is important to me that these faceless men, borderline the untouchables in our society, know they are men of honor. We spoke of our powerlessness for a bit. I am sure I have a great deal to learn, and I am listening more carefully than they know (which is hardly to say I am effective).

I'm giving my usual speech in the computer lab. Some consider me too obvious, and others are like me (they don't get it). How do I construct wise rule-breakers? It is not an easy problem.

7Gf is a reader, as is 5AOf. I am overjoyed to have children who want to read. I must nurture and defend my plants. 7Gf thanked me for taking her to the library? AM I BEING DETAINED IN HEAVEN?
