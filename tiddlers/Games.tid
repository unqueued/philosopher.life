!! About:

//Sometimes my fun has been fulfilling, but most of the time it has been a mere drug.//

<<<
Time is a game played beautifully by children.

As countless others before me have pointed out: life is a game. Indeed, I take this wiki to be a kind of video game, as I say in {[[About]]}. Life is a game filled with many possibilities, playstyles, metagames, storylines, and rhetoric. Games, as I speak about them here, really have helped me understand who I am and the world around me, although I've certainly been quite inefficient in learning those lessons. Eventually, I hope to getting around to fleshing out my introspection about these activities which have consumed vast quantities of my attention. 

My addictive personality, my adoration of research, my raw talent to grind, and numerous other seemingly unrelated abilities are connected to my practice of gaming. I do my best to {[[Focus]]} my attention on the games that ultimately matter, but I wish to celebrate these old practices of mine which have truly turned me into who I am.

Entertainment, when "Itâ€™s super effective!", is about being surprised [[irwartfrr]]. My games screamed "Get over here!" and "Boomshakalakalaka!" to me.<<ref "fh">> Most of it was a silly drug. I found them addictively good, some more than others. I hope you find something pleasant to play in this library.
