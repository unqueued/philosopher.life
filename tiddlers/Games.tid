!! About:

//Sometimes my fun has been fulfilling or useful, but most of the time it has been a mere drug. With regret, I have wasted non-trivial portions of my life on a gaming addiction. Always seek your telos with scrupulous doubt, sir.//

New possibilities appeared, but still no one could say which side had the advantage. Luzhin, preparing an attack for which it was first necessary to explore a maze of variations, where his every step aroused a perilous echo, began a long meditation: he needed, it seemed, to make one last prodigious effort and he would find the secret move leading to victory. Suddenly, something occurred outside his being, a scorching pain—and he let out a loud cry, shaking his hand stung by the flame of a match, which he had lit and forgotten to apply to his cigarette. The pain immediately passed, but in the fiery gap he had seen something unbearably awesome, the full horror of the abysmal depths of chess. He glanced at the chessboard, and his brain wilted from hitherto unprecedented weariness. But the chessmen were pitiless, they held and absorbed him. There was horror in this, but in this also was the sole harmony, for what else exists in the world besides chess? Fog, the unknown, non-being...

As countless others before me have pointed out: life is a game. Indeed, I take this wiki to be a kind of video game, as I say in {[[About]]}. Life is a game filled with many possibilities, playstyles, metagames, storylines, and rhetoric. Games, as I speak about them here, really have helped me understand who I am and the world around me, although I've certainly been quite inefficient in learning those lessons. Eventually, I hope to getting around to fleshing out my introspection about these activities which have consumed vast quantities of my attention. I've got to continually learn to spend my time, the most precious resource of my life, as wisely as I can. 

My addictive personality, my adoration of research, my raw talent for that unctuous grind, and hordes of seemingly unrelated abilities are connected to my practice of gaming. I do my best to {[[Focus]]} my attention on the games that ultimately matter, but I wish to celebrate these old practices of mine which have truly turned me into who I am.

Entertainment, when "It’s super effective!", is about being surprised [[irwartfrr]]. My games screamed "Get over here!" and "Boomshakalakalaka!" to me. Most of it was a silly drug.<<ref "fh">> I found them addictively good, some more than others. I hope you find something pleasant to play in this library of digital toys and toy-lives. Not by my design, I regret, few toys have been tools for teaching me who I really am in this world of experience machines like these games.
