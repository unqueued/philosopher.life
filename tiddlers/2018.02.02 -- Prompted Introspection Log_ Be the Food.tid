title: 2018.02.02 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Be the Food

!! If you were a food, what would you be?

Humans are food, Samwise. Even apex predators aren't immune. I'd like to be human, or any kind of superior genetic+memetic species. That's  a dumb fucking question. I'd prefer to be eaten by the laws of entropy, btw.
