* [[Links: Vidya Queue]]
** And there you stay. GL. `/salute`

** Thank goodness. Jesus Christ, dude. Get it out, please. Your workspace looks like they need to make a TV show about digital hoarder interventionists who will get all up in your bidness and throw your shit away for you. Addict.
*** "[[h0p3]], do you really, really need this? Does it complete you? You get, what, a couple uses out of this thing? It's ruining your life."
**** "but, but...their muh linkz. See, this is one is pretty. That one is sad. I blew my load to this one. Do want to see it? ...Yeah, my load, ofc."

** I take it back, there are short stories I'm qualified to read. It has to be super low brow though, lol. 
** Vidya pr0n is not always going to hit the spot; this is Mr. Backup, and it seems to always work (but, it is rare for me).

** Completed. Late night of writing. I hope to embrace it.

** I'm half tempted to celebrate //Canada Day//. 
*** You know, I should ask my offspring to start searching for things they want to do in the area. I'm perfectly happy to just be at home, but I want it to be part of their routine that they think about what they value out in the world (part of which is experiencing it).

** You did a fine job, homie. `/pat`. 
** Registration was cheaper for the SUV. I don't understand why?
*** Also, since the vehicle is over 20yo, they don't even provide a title. Bill of sale is all that I hand over, rofl. We own really shitty vehicles, always have.
