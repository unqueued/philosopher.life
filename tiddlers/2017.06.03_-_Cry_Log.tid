title: 2017.06.03 - Cry Log

Bach's Suite For Solo Cello No. 1 In G Major. There's a 74.999 (repeating, of course) percent chance that I will cry when I hear this song. I don't go out of my way to hear it (unless I'm high). But, when it pops up in my streaming or random listening, I must stop what I'm doing. It controls the moment. It captures me. This song owns me. I can't help but be moved by it. It's overwhelming. I experience many emotions through it. Sometimes I rejoice, other times I endure. It is sublime, terrifying, and amazing. I hear hope and sorrow. I hear something beyond. I perceive the edges of reality and see the transcendental gateway in this song.

Yet, I know it just pushes my buttons the right way. I know I've been conditioned to love it. I know I've evolved to love it. I am a computer, and if you feed me the right input, you'll get a certain output. 

I will enjoy its unique beauty. 

Thank you, Bach. Few men make me cry as you do.
