title: 2018.06.12 -- Deep Reading: Logicomix

This book is gut-wrenching to me, which is kind of funny, since I'm shitting as I read it. I'm feeling the pain of these people. I feel like I'm living parts of their lives.

I can't say I care for the mythology line. It detracts from the story. In fact, I'm finding the political aspect a bit repugnant. It's not clear to me that Russell was a good man, but I very much respect his work in logic.
