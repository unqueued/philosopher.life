Hey, how's it going?
Wed 11:53 AM
 It’s going. Work is crazy to the point I’m having to take things home to get them done. Not happy about it, but if I don’t do them it’ll be my head on the chopping block. Most of my issue is waiting around for other people to get me their pieces.
Wed 12:33 PM
 That sucks.
Wed 12:34 PM
 It do indeed.
Wed 12:36 PM
 Lol
Wed 12:36 PM
 I think I would want to punch people in the face.
Wed 12:37 PM
 Oh definitely.
Wed 12:37 PM
 I'm sorry you are feeling on the chopping block
Wed 12:38 PM
 That is stressful.
Wed 12:38 PM
 They pull this crap all the time. “Oh it’s not important right now I have competing priories” buh-scuse-you bitch, do you want to get up in front of a hundred people and fly off the cuff for an hour? Don’t think so. Now give me your damn talking points.
Wed 12:38 PM
 especially when it isn't your fault
Wed 12:38 PM
 or you have no power over it, in a way
Wed 12:38 PM
 Rofl
Wed 12:39 PM
 On another frustrating note, Chase has also officially flunked out of all his classes due to attendance policies.
Wed 12:40 PM
 =(
Wed 12:40 PM
 [[K]] told him exactly what to do to get everything in order and even gave him back-up options if that didn’t work out and he still hasn’t made progress
Wed 12:41 PM
 I can feel it from here.
Wed 12:42 PM
 God damn, that sucks.
Wed 12:42 PM
 After talking with him some it’s looking more like he just doesn’t want people telling him what to do or how to live his life
Wed 12:42 PM
 He bears non-trivial (though not complete) responsibility for that.
Wed 12:43 PM
 Aye.
Wed 12:45 PM
 I don’t think he has a realistic understanding of the repercussions of his decisions here but he doesn’t want to hear explanations either.
Wed 12:47 PM
 It's hard to love yourself when you've been raised not to.
Wed 12:48 PM
 Overcoming learned helplessness sounds like his task.
Wed 12:48 PM
 Yeah...
Wed 12:49 PM
 Though, again, I do not aim to claim he bears all the moral responsibility here.
Wed 12:49 PM
 Honestly the older the kids get the more Desiree (Austin’s long-time girlfriend) and I can see the patterns developing.
Wed 12:51 PM
 She’s done nothing but fuck those kids over mentally. They have to jump through her mental gymnastics and deal with their own issues without any help except from each other and those outside the home that can attempt to help them..
Wed 12:54 PM
 That may be worth developing clearly.
Wed 12:54 PM
 They may need an outsider to articulate that point by point.
Wed 12:55 PM
 I know Kim won’t listen.
Wed 12:55 PM
 Kim is the mother, right?
Wed 12:56 PM
 She goes on and on about how only God can judge her and how she’s doing right by them they just don’t appreciate it.
Wed 12:56 PM
 Yes.
Wed 12:56 PM
 Abandon convincing Kim.
Wed 12:56 PM
 Your articulation is to and for the offspring. Even your husband may require you to lay it out cleanly.
Wed 12:57 PM
 [[k0sh3k]] and I have to do with for each other as well.
Wed 12:57 PM
 He has a pretty strong idea already. He said everything changed once realized the source of much of the angst in his life was his mom.
Wed 12:58 PM
 He realized she likes to pin everyone against each other so she can come out the “good guy”
Wed 12:58 PM
 It is one thing to verbalize it, it is another to let it systematically heal yourself and coherentify your identity afterwards. I suggest it is possible he can say it, but doesn't fully believe it all the way down.
Wed 12:59 PM
 Raised by narcissists
Wed 12:59 PM
 Dealing with victimhood is a transformative process.
Wed 1:00 PM
 Right.
Wed 1:14 PM
 I just want to help Chase become a better person but I can’t unless he lets us.
Wed 1:14 PM
 So... patience at this point. And reminding him that we’re here if he should ever need us.
