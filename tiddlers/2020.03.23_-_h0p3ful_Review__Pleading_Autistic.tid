** This may evolve. Don't forget to update it.
** I've called it a .ttp. It includes all the others.
** I'd like to see "More" sections of the other [[TTP]] tabs.

** "Contrary" is more appropriate than "opposite."
*** It's a logical matter.
** Contradict or at least be inconsistent with (that is to say we can derive a contradiction).
*[[2020/03/22 -- Prompted Introspection: Resident Minor]]
** Lol. I like how you "plead autistic."
** I wish you many such friends. I know it's not easy.
** I appreciate how you insist on empathizing and being tactful (unlike your asshole of a father). 
*[[2020/03/22 -- Life Log]]
** This is brief, but it has specifics. I hope you will flesh these logs out further.
** You should pick up belcher. If you enjoy the aggro-combo roles on the triad, that is a classic one you'll interpret other decks with. It's not even built optimally (and it would be an interesting homework problem to figure out how to improve it).

** Had you adjusted your strategy for immediate temp/damage instead of almost pure card advantage to some degree, I'd have lost two turns earlier. Them platings would have ended me immediately (and forced me to play at a loss rather than building toward a lock). Your brother would have been locked out either way, so you could ignore him to one-shot your mom. After that, you had the advantage (and snowball from clamps) to overwhelm what he built. I agree: you should have won.
** Belated: I adore your systematic description of your RPing and socializing. I do not fully understand your terminology, but I know you do. It's calming to watch you think from the outside here.
*[[2020/03/22 -- To-Do List Log]]
** I'd like to see specificity in what you want to accomplish during [[Family Time]]. How do you want it change? What do you want it to be? 
*** [[TDL]]s also give you a chance to process and express your emotions about some project. 
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Maybe the //Foundation// world isn't something you want to explore. I adored it. If you don't have the feeling that it's worth exploring, you should let me know. We can go other directions. You've at least tasted it, which is enough to help us figure out where to go.
** I am grateful that you are so judicious with your resources. I think you are getting even better at picking out what will maximize utility for a particular scope in a given context each year.
** We've stopped using the pomodoro timing technique. Shouldn't we get back to it?
