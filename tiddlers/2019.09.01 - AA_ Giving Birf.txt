How's your weekend going?

Good good —giving birth to a stupid two page paper —I am going to get to a point where this is not so painful....I am going to conquer this! Advice?

How is your weekend
SEP 1 7:16 PM
Giving birth, lol. I hear ya. I'm confident you will get to a point that it won't be painful. I doubt I have any advice you don't know either. I don't know your writing process. Some people outline and write from there. I'm ridiculously messy. I just start puking my guts up and rearranging it until I don't hate it so much. I suspect that if you do it a bunch you won't feel rusty. Expect to draft (even for two pages). Work for 25 minutes, go get something to drink to clear your head for a few minutes, then come back. My cliche advice is: don't give up, I know you'll make it.

It goes. [[j3d1h]] did a poor job on school this week. Transitions to me working again wasn't a smooth as I'd have liked.
SEP 1 7:22 PM
But, it's been a productive and relaxing weekend.
SEP 1 7:22 PM
Family Time is done, so I'm grinding my audit. I'm going far too slowly on my letters. WoW has been a wonderful addiction.
SEP 1 7:23 PM
Project Ascension is amazing.
SEP 1 7:23 PM
(though their site is down right now, and I have no idea what is up...just mashing my f5)
SEP 1 7:23 PM
I can’t imagine that she struggles with school but I can see that it would be a change not having you there. Are you doing after school again?
SEP 1 7:23 PM
Yup. That's what I do. I'm enjoying it more this semester (at least so far ;P).
SEP 1 7:24 PM
Yeah we have been doing FF xiv since there is more of a chance of getting some [[K]] or [[L]] time
SEP 1 7:24 PM
I applied to a jobs over the summer, had some interviews, but landed nothing. Still, I'm grateful for this one.
SEP 1 7:24 PM
I understand —I am sure the kids enjoy having someone different to encourage them
SEP 1 7:25 PM
I downloaded FFXIV, but then WoW with [[JRE]] has sucked me in, lol. I hope to join you all some^^day^^.
SEP 1 7:25 PM
Yup, nothing like having that weird, homeless looking man to wrestle with.
SEP 1 7:25 PM
Wow is pretty fun!
SEP 1 7:25 PM
Haha :joy:
SEP 1 7:25 PM
This WoW server allows you to select abilities and talents from any classes. You can also enchant your gear with many of the talents. It's "classless" in the sense that you build your own. Brings me out of the woodwork to play. I have no idea how my brother finds such beautiful things.
SEP 1 7:27 PM
He is pretty awesome :heart:
SEP 1 7:28 PM
Our monster dog ate half a pizza off the counter. My fault for leaving it out...and she is too lovable to be harsh with...
SEP 1 7:32 PM
She is just too tall
SEP 1 7:32 PM
=)
SEP 1 7:32 PM
Sounds delicious
SEP 1 7:32 PM
How are [[UJ]] and [[AG]] doing?
SEP 1 7:35 PM
Good —[[UJ]] is playing around with his electric guitar and improvising. His week was interesting—they inherited a thug group of 1st graders
SEP 1 7:36 PM
One of the spent 30 minutes spitting at him on Friday
SEP 1 7:37 PM
Them even
SEP 1 7:37 PM
=/
SEP 1 7:38 PM
Most days aren’t that bad —he and the Principal are working on methods to get these kids to behave
SEP 1 7:38 PM
Well, I'm glad he's there for them. They need it.
SEP 1 7:38 PM
[[AG]] is enjoying McDonalds most of the time —it’s just a few hours on Saturday and Sunday
SEP 1 7:39 PM
Noice.
SEP 1 7:40 PM
I miss absolutely fresh fries.
SEP 1 7:40 PM
Appuruhntly, back in the 80's, they used tallow fat or something for the fries, and they were somehow even better.
SEP 1 7:40 PM
My friend Lisa and I are going to redo [[UJ]]’s office in classic starwars
SEP 1 7:40 PM
Outstanding.
SEP 1 7:41 PM
Yeah she loves the fries!
SEP 1 7:41 PM
The Vader Room
SEP 1 7:41 PM
Yes!
SEP 1 7:41 PM
The VP needs a "Welcome to my Lair" effect.
SEP 1 7:41 PM
Hehe exactly
