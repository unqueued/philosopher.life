title: 2018.06.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Ideal Bday Present

!! What would be your ideal birthday present, and why?

Lady Melisandre, you honor me again with your delicious body and kind words. Of course, as an idealist, my ideal is pretty absurdly hard to imagine.

I seek maximum hedonic and eudaimonic happiness for all creatures throughout all time in all possible worlds, to the extent permitted by our ontology. I seek to understand reality and myself, the nature of reality itself, as saliently and best as possible for me, including through cybernetic equipment. I hope to unify ourselves into a giant computer. I want the ideal that I cannot even conceive of at the moment, and if the ideal which is definitionally inconceivable can obtain, I seek that as well.

Also, how's about a threesome with us? =)
