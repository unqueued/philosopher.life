title: McManus: On Marx’s account of the commodity

https://www.counterfire.org/articles/analysis/19318-on-marx-s-account-of-the-commodity

<<<
 a commodity had an objective “exchange” value, and a subjective “use” value
<<<

i.e. cost/benefit

I have a hard time pointing out what //isn't// a commodity (which may just be the point).

<<<
 He urges us to think of why so many people, even those with money and the power to acquire commodities, remain dissatisfied and anxious within the capitalist social form. 
<<<

Desire satisfaction is a different question. I'm willing to call "experiences" (which are different from standards goods/commodities for many folks) commodities; these are what the wealthy pursue. To me, this is an issue of experience machines. Are we willing to ignore others (eschewing [[The Original Position]]) to achieve what we believe is happiness through a mere experience machine that isn't reality? 

<<<
This is because the social function of commodities is not to provide happiness, but to compel further consumption. 
<<<

I'm not sure I can go that far. I agree that in Capitalism the function of commodities is ultimately to centralize power and hedonia into the hands of the few until (assuming it occurs) collapse/revolution.

<<<
We acquire commodities only to realize that they cannot provide the gratification promised.
<<<

I'm in desperate need of an account of what actually gratifies and satisfies for eudaimonia. I only have some vague concept here. I agree materials are necessary but insufficient. 

<<<
But rather than turning to reflect critically on our social system, we instead are driven to consume more and more. 
<<<

Psychological egoism is, to some significant [[dok]], an apt description of human psychology. There's an evolutionary reason for it. However, I deny the egoist's prescription until he hit [[T42T]], where respecting our own human dignity as persons must be weighed against others in effective voting structures and heuristics, i.e. [[The Original Position]]. This is to say: I agree that those in power are driven to ignore how their consumption affects others in the world.

<<<
We must always recognize that it is not enough to simply point out that a commodity is simply an object; the tension is that many will see this as one level, while still fetishizing it a deeper, unconscious one. 
<<<

The relationship between cognition and affect is a profound problem not just in moral psychology but also epistemology at large. This might just be a dialectic between our fastmind and slowminds and the fundamental problem of philosophy equivalent for humans.
