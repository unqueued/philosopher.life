title: 2018.10.22 - Wiki Audit: Cleansed

Deleted $:/plugins/TheDiveO/TwFusejs. It just freezes.

Tags for Voldemort, stripped in search.

Major additions to [[TW: Cheatsheet]]. Thank you, [[j3d1h]]. We're jumping headfirst into automated rendering. I hope we can come back and start digesting into hardcoded elements again.

Meh, decided the create date wasn't giving valuable information. It's often inaccurate, though technically solvable. I don't think it's worth my time. The edit dates should be loud and clear though.

So, I've had to deal with "--" throughout the wiki. I'm convinced Tiddlywiki is not consistent in how it parses and renders this (and I'm not consistent in how I use it either). I made ~22k replacements with 3 different 'to be replaced' options. I fear that I have radically made it harder to parse and do another replacement later in a safe way. 

There are 7 places in the empty tiddler that I've replaced, and I'm changing some of them back just because I don't know what I'm breaking. Skiddie AF. Not even fixing it in full, lol.

Living dangerously today.

Timelines are getting revamped. These are the voyages... =)
