Xenophobia is paradoxically the slur de jour among both cosmopolitans and globalist Libertarians (although, only one side really means it). Hospitality memeplexes are dying or merely narrowed into overly selective use, as they always have. I'm not here to be an accuser of anyone but myself at the moment though. 

Who is The Other that doesn't merit my empathy (and when)? Those who have committed the unforgivable sin, of course. What that is, I don't know. They deserve my contempt though, right? Is it the sin of lots of melanin in their skin? No, of course not. But, I do not rule out genetics. The Xenomorph from the //Alien// series appears to be genetically what it is, and I am conceptually fine with a eugenicist's attitude of a xenomorphic holocaust; they are genetically evil. 

Yes, we do not choose our genetics (not yet, at least), and thus they are morally arbitrary characteristics behind the Veil of Ignorance in the Original Position. But, there are clearly good and bad gene formations for given contexts, including perhaps fairly universalizable contexts (which is where you will have a serious problem with what I'm saying). As we see genetics and memetics continue to show significant relationships, this only becomes a more complex topic.

In any case, it seems pretty obvious that the global poor should revolt against the psychopathic Hyperclass, the gods of men. They truly are Other. Beyond that, I do not have much guidance.

Some of us have been systematically unsure about the right things to the point that we've earned the right to be sure about others.

I want to grow as independent of others so that (1) I don't have to be so disappointed in them when they fail to live up to the moral law, and (2) because I don't want to be the victim of their selfishness. It's better not to rely upon others and be able to maintain the rosy facade that they actually care than to be forced into a position where you must rely upon and test what they are really made of.

The wisdom of the crowds is both a valuable inductive heuristic to consider and a deductive fallacy at the same time.

The virtuous agent can legitimately leverage ad hominem attacks, and the vicious, by definition, are in no position to defend themselves.
