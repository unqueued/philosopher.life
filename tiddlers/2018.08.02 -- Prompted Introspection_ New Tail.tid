title: 2018.08.02 -- Prompted Introspection: New Tail

!! What would you do if you woke up one morning with a tail?

I'd freak out. I'd tell my wife. She'd freak out. We'd tell the kids; they would think that it was odd but neat.

To my understanding, true human tails exist from birth/womb. Tumors, vertebral elongation, and parasitic twin tissue appear as though they are tails too. I don't really know what counts as a tail. To grow a tail in my 30's would be disturbing and almost exclusively a sign of poor health. I don't want to die (not usually :P). I'd go to the doctor (even though we have little money for such ~~necessities~~ luxuries).

Outside of health concerns, I think I'd be annoyed to sit on it, but if that wasn't a problem then I don't think it would matter to me.
