I had to do some cleanup for yesterday. I didn't actually get through my logs. I dove headfirst into a fairly lengthy letter to R. I'm still not 100% sure I'm going to send it. It requires more work, and even then, it might not be the right thing. I will think further on the matter.

Pushed some more commentary into [[The Matrix: Script Commentary]]. It goes, slowly.

Worked on [[JRE]]. I need to work on [[AIR]].

Got some work done on {[[About]]} per usual. I'm glad I'm always hitting hard there.
