I am reminded of Hobbes here. There are many ways to define freedom. To Rand, people are obstacles or means to her ends, but she owes them nothing as ends in themselves. To have a moral obligation to anyone is for them to have a claim right on you (that is the Hohfeldian correspondence). It means you are not morally free to just do or be anyone. 

Kantian freedom is paradoxical, particularly as the Neo-Kantians read him. I'm an incompatibilist, but even I can agree to the claim that we are only morally free to (though we descriptively have the capacity to not) be ourselves insofar as we bind ourselves to the moral law and act from duty. It might be equivalent to saying you only have the right to be yourself insofar as you have the right to be yourself. That is a truism, and unfortunately, it doesn't appear to flesh out the content of the moral law by itself. It is an important grounds to recognize, however.
