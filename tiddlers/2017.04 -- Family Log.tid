!! Audit:

*I can see that [[1uxb0x]] didn't do much of what we wanted to accomplish. It was a good month for him though.
* [[j3d1h]] is able to stay on task better and does accomplish more of her personal goals. 
* Hopefully, in time both will be adept at triaging, prioritizing, focusing, and other executive function skills that enable them to make the most of their time.
* [[k0sh3k]] had stomach problems which we eventually found were due to milk in a sugar candy she had received from work. Her period, allergies, headaches, and sleeping problems have not dissipated. 
* I spent a month not fixing a dryer. Jesus.
