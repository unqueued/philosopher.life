title: 2018.11.13 - Polymath Craftsman: Glue

I've been using glue a lot (Cheryl and Charlie know what it do ;P). Drain-stopper is broken, but the assembly enables me to glue it back together. I've never used this adhesive spray sitting in our utility drawer before. We'll see how it goes.

I called up maintenance. They had to head to Lowes to pick up some stuff to finish the job (I think this is an excuse). It turns out I didn't need to rush order. I should have just assumed it was going to take longer. I should know better, lol.

They came, took two hours to replace the pipe, and then my son and I quickly changed out the fuse. It works!! Huzzah!
