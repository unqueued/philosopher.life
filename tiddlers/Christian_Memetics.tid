title: Christian Memetics

An example redpilled, Darwinian view of the evolution of a Christian meme would be the pressure on girls (but not really boys) to remain virgins until their wedding night. Obviously sexist, but obviously has a utilitarian algorithm in it for modifying behavior that is successful enough that it continues to replicate itself as a meme through the minds of those who call themselves Christians (and otherwise). 

What is the redpilled reason for the addictive nature of these memes? 

In this case, it is obvious that some women have historically agreed to the meme "Why buy the cow when you get can the milk for free?" This redpilled meme has existed (and still does) in various Christian meme networks for millenia now. It is about understanding human nature at its core. It is an acceptance of the fact that we are all, to some degree, on the dark-triadic spectrum (which, to me, just is the psychopathy spectrum). It is a way to be utilitarian even in faith. 

It is interesting to see the Redpilled nature of the Bible. I'd love to see a redpill interpretation of the Bible, actually. I'm certainly not qualified to do that, and I doubt anyone is.

Those things which didn't add up to me growing up, which didn't make sense, there are good explanations for them, generally redpilled explanations. 

-----------------------------

One of the reasons Christianity has been so successful as a memetic network living through the societies over time (evolving only when it faces extinction), is that it had this ultimate trump card in Christian action. When one followed through on Christ's call to turn the other cheek, when one forced the executioner, oppressor, enemy, or sinner to face their victim so thoroughly, one had a non-trivial chance to affect change, to convert others, to force mirror-neurons to fire off in empathy for the victims. Essentially, love and empathy from the victim is so unexpected that it forces the human adversary to see The Other as human for even the briefest of moments (at least in some cases). Empathy begets empathy at least 1% of the time, and it does so in places you wouldn't expect. 

Christianity is a mental virus (I've long thought "Viral Christianity" would be a good book title). It is incredibly potent. It is why it spreads so effectively under oppression. The [[Christian Memetic Network Organism]] thrives as a parasite in the poor. It really is the opiate of the masses. It fits the conditions just right.

The "Body of Christ" is literally the persistent identity of the Christian Memetic Network that has parasitically lived for thousands of years through human societies and individual hosts. As a crucial philosophical belief I take up: I think viruses are living creatures, but that means memes are living creatures. Thus, the Body of Christ is literally a living thing to me. Neat, huh?

Modern victims are silent victims though. Truly silent victims in the face of hardcore psychopathy cannot effectively transmit the meme. When you had to face your oppressors in person, when punishment was handed down in person, when the pain on your face could be seen, when it was obvious and direct, the Christian empathy transmission method had a chance to succeed. As we race toward a Solarian-like  world (Asimov), as "The Stack" complexifies our world until no one understands even the outline of what it is, as we approach whatever Transhumanist singularity there is, as the [[Hyperclass]] continue to insulate themselves out of reach, it becomes less and less likely that anyone will actually really see our suffering. We aren't turning our cheek to anyone IRL anymore. The machinations and middlemen and processes which draw and quarter us are automated, done silently and privately, are too difficult to comprehend by the human mind. The source and causes of human suffering are too far removed for the Christian Meme to actually revolutionize anything.
