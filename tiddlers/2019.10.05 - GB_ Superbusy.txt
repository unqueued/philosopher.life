I've averaged a book's worth of words every 2 months for the past 3 years. Hyperreligious is fair to say; I've always been that. I am sexually atypical; preferring 2 orgasms a day. Circumstantial speech seems right, as many of my conversations last years and I'm prone to rabbithole in conversations. Intensified mental life as well.

Still, I aim to be skeptical here. Just because it all lights up for me doesn't mean it fits, and I shouldn't assume even the experts know what they are talking about.
