!!General Notes

* Monday through Friday will be standard schedules. No bootcamps. No vocational Fridays. Just get the regular pattern down.
* You've not been doing your morning routine so well, and part of the reason for that is because you've not been finishing your dishes on time. You need to make sure that you have your chores done in a timely manner. 
* [[1uxb0x]] needs to get up in the morning and start his day immediately. 
* We had one hiccup day.
