Hey Pit. W,

`/blush`. That praise is way too high. I'm still learning how to use this tool. The generous people of the TW community are constantly showing me how to use and reason about Tiddlywiki.

I didn't respond after Aidan because that is the method I used, and I didn't want to derail the thread. I didn't see a way to contact you directly, so I'm posting here.

I'm just a madman. I'm lucky to have found TW: a tool to contain my insanity. It is always [[my honor to speak with people|Find The Others]]. Feel free to [[contact]] me.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
