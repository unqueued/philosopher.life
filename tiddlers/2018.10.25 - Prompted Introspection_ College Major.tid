title: 2018.10.25 - Prompted Introspection: College Major

!! What was your major in college? How did you choose it?

Answering these questions I've answered before is a cinch (like God makin' snakes by rollin' clay between his hands, right?): [[2017.11.13 - Prompted Introspection Log: College Major]]. I can add to this one.

I started college because my donors had no interest in actually homeschooling their children (instead they sent us to publicly funded daycare prisons meant to construct illiterate slaves), and they came to it quite late. I actually should never have started college so early, though I should have been engaged in that kind of work much, much earlier than I did. My major was the result of me picking whatever struck me the hardest. Philosophy was a method for disentangling and modeling the gaslighting I grew up with.

It's been really fucking hard, and I am so grateful to have had my teachers. I'd be even more lost without them.
