title: Hidden: Habits of a Fireman

I need to stop watching porn so much and let my mind's eye and imagination do the work. I love the realness and contextualizing to my particularities when I do it. There is something right about Erotica. Perhaps I should even just write my own erotic fiction. Those are experience machines I would love.

Also, I like going slow and building up. I like edging and making it so that when I do cum, it's out of my control. It goes full blast. Seriously, I can feel it deeper in my loins that way. I need to spend more time improving my technique, in a sense. I can squeeze more out of it.
