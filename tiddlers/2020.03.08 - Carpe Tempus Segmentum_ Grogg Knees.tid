title: 2020.03.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Grogg Knees

* Woke at Noon
** Garbage sleep. Dazed. Feels like 4-5 hours. Neck is awful.
* [[Morning Routine]]
** Going to try to see if my offspring will join me checking over their tabs in the morning as a knee jerk habit to assess where they are in time.
*** I hurd Hitler say that if one more time-traveler comes to kill him, he'll start a war.
* [[Family Time]]!
** Heavy work on our sidebars today.
*** I think everyone is on the same page. I think.
** I'm grateful that my wife is increasingly talkative, and I'm grateful that she's diving into the projects at the same time with us. 
** Lots of thinking about the direction in school. Still the primary focus.
** We're taking forever on [[Family Log]].
** I'm surprised by how much singing we engage in for the fun of it.
*** Holding the same note is also fun.
** Daughter set up a quick art gallery in discord. 
*** There's new work she hasn't shown me that is a step up from the last set.
** My nickname is Grogg Knees, and I speak Grogginese.
** Dinner was excellent.
*** Son liked the ham a lot. Will need to get more for him.
*** Prep was not complete enough, but it was smooth.
** Walk was a congo line, lol.
** Ran out of time for 1-on-1s. Fek.
** Wikis went by so smoothly. 
** I didn't keep track of everything we talked about. Heavy lifting or fun. 
** We spend a lot of time thinking about the past together, making comparisons, trying to put us in context.
