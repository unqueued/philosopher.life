Alcoholism can be cute enough. I need to work on my slobbering Rickburps. You know, sometimes it is the only thing which gets me over the hump. I don't drink that often (just, like, 5 times a week, doctor), but when I do: I aim to have no fewer than 2 drinks in me within an hour.

Why is this antipleonasmic? It's humorous, it's only half-joking, and it's compressed!
