title: 2017.12.16 - Computer Musings: Switching to Manjaro

I keep running into serious headaches with Ubuntu. For all the stuff that it makes easy, there are too many times where it gets in my way. I'm switching to Manjaro. I want cutting edge vanilla, but not bleeding edge. 

I have so much to setup. It's kind of absurd.

Can't connect to SSHTalk. My client is telling me aes256-cbc is deprecated. This newer version of SSH I'm using won't let me modify Ciphers in sshd_config, but I can -c flag it from the command line. Meh.
