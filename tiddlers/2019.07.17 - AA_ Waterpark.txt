I have your kidlets at the waterpark

WED 11:55 AM
You all having a good time?
WED 11:55 AM
They are in the wave pool â€”yes
WED 11:55 AM
Jumping with the waves
WED 11:55 AM
[[1uxb0x]] isnâ€™t sure who we are but itâ€™s been a while
WED 11:56 AM
:blush:
WED 11:56 AM
Thank you for taking them to the wave pool. I don't think they've ever been to one.
WED 11:56 AM
Awesome â€”they are great kids!
WED 11:56 AM
Itâ€™s cloudy and sprinklingâ€”not a bad day to be wet
WED 11:57 AM
This may be irrelevant, but we had a conversation ~40 days and nights ago about robotics. This machine (https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=Lenovo+ThinkPad+W530+i7-3740QM&_sacat=0&_sop=1) is very well priced (going at around ~200ish a piece). Pop an SSD it in, and that machine would last through college, imho (though I cannot speak to the battery life). You can't game on it, but it's a workhorse.

Awesome! I will take a look at it! Thank you :heart_eyes:
WED 12:25 PM
I keep going to check on our kidlets but they are very busy in the water
WED 12:25 PM
Haha. I bet they are having a blast.
WED 12:26 PM
They've been looking forward to it.
WED 12:26 PM
And I count 5 lifeguards so not worried about that
WED 12:26 PM
Oh good :blush:so has [[AG]]
WED 12:26 PM
I'm not worried either. I send my offspring to go swimming without me most days this summer.
WED 12:28 PM
Oh good â€”they have other things here too but [[AG]] loves the wave pool
WED 12:28 PM
Understandably. Something special about it. Mesmerizing experience.
WED 12:29 PM
They will be tired :blush:
WED 12:29 PM
Yeah. Definitely.
WED 12:32 PM
I like sending them to the pool because I can use the break sometimes. This is the longest I've ever been apart of my offspring.  Feels like I've been walking on the Moon's Gravity instead since they've been gone. Sleep schedule is awful, but my stress level plummeted, lol. Still, I'm so ready to have them back.
WED 12:32 PM
I bet! Just a little while longer
WED 12:32 PM
Itâ€™s harder when they do something like college. At least [[L]] was kind enough to come home on weekends so I could adjust
WED 12:33 PM
Yes. It is difficult to prepare for it. This has been a valuable test. Some things worked, and some didn't.
WED 12:34 PM
They are well grounded kids â€”they will be fine. Us on the other hand it maybe difficult
WED 12:38 PM
Enjoyed having the kids â€” they were great! [[AG]] looks like a lobster ðŸ¦ž poor child so she was grumpy towards the end
WED 7:55 PM
*Never pushed the enter key, lol, just sitting in the application: Thank you so much for taking them. It will be an experience to remember.
WED 10:23 PM
It was fun :blush:
