title: 2019.05.23 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Democratic Schools

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Because they don't teach the truth about the world, schools have to rely on beating students over the head with propaganda about democracy. If schools were, in reality, democratic, there would be no need to bombard students with platitudes about democracy. They would simply act and behave democratically, and we know this does not happen. The more there is a need to talk about the ideals of democracy, the less democratic the system usually is.

Excepting the claim that schools should simply behave democratically, [[Saint Chomsky]] is obviously correct. 

Why should school be democratic though? What are they going to vote on? Students should have a voice, but I don't see why they should shape the institution as a whole so strongly. Even in the classroom (most of my post-secondary classes were extremely small and discussion heavy), my best teachers ranged between tyrants and benevolent dictators. Students should not be deciding course content, pedagogy, etc. They literally don't know better. It's about having learned how to prepare for the class, contributing to the group's dialectic, and coming to habituate epistemic virtues through practice. If you don't have a master/slave dialectic, you aren't being efficient in your wrestling.

Note, while not a democracy, there is a market within most schools (particularly higher learning). If students don't like particular teachers or departments, they can apply pressure to get funding cut. Many students take X+1 classes to drop the hardest one. Insofar as school is a piece of a paper (as it is to most students), they've already misunderstood what the transformative experience learning is supposed to be. Social markets exist in all schools from what I can see; parents and students of parents with money or power outside the school often translate it into power within the school, and I can't say that is a good thing.

Setting aside concern for democracy within school, it's obvious that primary and secondary schools have a strong tendency to inculcate patriotism, the religion endorsed by those in power, and the worship of capitalism. Like police officers, teachers and administrators are selected for having pointless credentials, the ability to follow orders without question (especially since it's a dependable status-based job given their incompetence), lower than average IQs for their degree level, and shockingly poor critical reasoning skills. It's not just a joke: it's evil. These daycare centers exist to pacify the population, to train children to be just knowledgable enough to be exploitable but not sufficiently learned or transformed enough to recognize and fight for their human dignity.
