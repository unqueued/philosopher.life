Today was productive. I started studying immediately in our new book. It was a chapter on rigging. The teacher told us at the end of the day that we might be fortunate enough to have a seminar/practicum on it (someone may be coming in to do one for us). This is something which the shop isn't well equipped to do. 

I studied most of the day for this exam. It was not easy. I ended up making an 80%, as did Chris. I'll take it. We're pushing.

I also talked to my teacher about my gameplan. He said he would do his best to work with me. Co-op'ing may be tricky if I go full time, but there is a possibility I can do it as long as the form is signed. He also said he could spot me hours for "previous experience" which I barely have (except for installing insulation for a bit). He understood exactly where I was coming from. He didn't believe the piece of paper was worth that much, but the experience in the shop and learning from the book was worthy. That said, the piece of paper is a line on my resume and it may matter, for all I know, some time down the line. 

In any case, he also advised me to speak with Randy. He said there is a possibility Randy might be able to find something for me.

At the end of the day, Chris and I spent some time drawing and planning the second fabrication for 3". We didn't finish, but we got a good way into it.
