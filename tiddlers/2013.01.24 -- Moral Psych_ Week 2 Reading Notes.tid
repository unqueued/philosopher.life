Conceptual Rationalism –

Why should I think the psychopath is fully rational?

Why must there be so little space between reason and motivation in the Conceptual Rationalist view? That we should be motivated by reason is grounded in…reason. To not be motivated by reason is to not be reasonable. Further, even if we can’t make sense of it this way, can the Libertarian make sense of this problem?

We might claim the psychopath doesn’t make moral judgements, they simply know what others would would judge as moral.

Why should I care about what normal people think in these experiments? Why is platitudinous thinking so potent? Why should I care about folk conceptions of almost anything, especially about normativity?



Empirical Rationalism

I think part of the suggestion here is that the moral rationalist is positing some sort of large-scale moral agreement. Why must this be posited?

Distinction between Moral and conventional violations.



Affect-based accounts…a virtue theoretic approach might help make sense, and while not traditionally a moral rationalist theory, it seems possible that one could be formed.



Pg 300 is his positive account



Blair, Colledge, Murray, and Mitchell

“A process of classical conditioning results in these representations of moral transgressions becoming triggers for the mechanism. The appropriately developing child thus initially finds the pain of others’ aversive and then, through socialisation, thoughts of acts that cause pain to others aversive. It is thought that a failure in the conditioning process is the fundamental cause of the difficulty of the psychopathic individual to be socialised.” (492)

A test about psychopathic children’s ability to determine six basic emotional expressions (at given stages, with certain accuracies, weighted for IQ, and compared to a control group). Less sensitive to fear (especially) and sadness.
