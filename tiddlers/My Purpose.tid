Hey Kierkegaard: this is a there and back again story. Look at it:

Aesthetic > Ethical > Faith > Ethical > Aesthetic > Ethical

Does this go on? Do I continue on this cycle? Will I always oscillate up and down between these three existential stages of life?

The real question: does Positive Disintegration include this or does this include Positive Disintegration? Which is the more fundamental or primitive process of existential mode/paradigm shifts? I believe Positive Disintegration is the larger, more fundamental phenomenon. I have spent some time studying it, and I think Kierkegaard stumbled on a crucial but oversimplified psychological point of view long before it germinated into Positive Disintegration. 

The good of Kierkegaard is God. The good of Positive Disintegration is Self-Unity. From what I can tell, God is not rational, but Self-Unity is. What is the good if it isn't God? Perhaps Self-Unity. For the sake of argument, say Self-Unity is my purpose. What do I do with my Self-Unity after I'm properly unified? Being myself is what it means to be unified unless I'm improving my unity. Is that all there is to moral life is making sure I'm unified? But, the [[Korsgaardian Slip]] shows that unification need not require being moral. Hence, Self-Unity overrides moral law? Is that Right? What is Right? Why should we think the moral law overrides Self-Unity? This was the way we went. It was a crucial mistake, since it was impractical. Hence my bifurcation.
