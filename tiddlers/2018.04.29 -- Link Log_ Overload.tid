*** Stiglitz has regularly been worth my time. I'm pleased to see this. Unfortunately, he still isn't talking about the means to decentralizing power effectively enough. That's his fucking job. He only takes us to the edge, but he doesn't have the ballsack to go any further.

*** I've recently switched to being open to this. I have long worried about it's inflationary nature, but felt that I was probably brainwashed against it. These people really do care, are knowledgeable, and I trust them. That said, the bulk of their argument is about the trojan horse, not a conceptual argument against the UBI. The Trojan horse, of course, is very real. Further, that FJG is obviously wildly better. 

* Think About It

*** I have a problem with the way in which SDO is tested.
*** It seems to me that many people aren't able to reason effectively about the nature of power, nor do I think economics peels apart so nicely. Status is more complex than is being relayed here.
*** I'm not sure the questions asked give them what they think it does.
** https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-04-11/value-of-education-isn-t-measured-only-by-earnings
*** That was a start, but ultimately a weak argument.
** https://www.nature.com/news/the-myopia-boom-1.17120
*** Makes sense. I'd also like to see a philosophical discussion of myopia concerning abstractions, ideas, etc.
** http://therealnews.com/t2/story:21675:Green-Party%27s-Jill-Stein%3A-Russiagate-Being-Exploited-to-Repress-Leftist-Opposition
*** I'm still not sure about it, but that may be the case.
** https://newrepublic.com/article/148142/republican-party-not-trump-real-threat-american-democracy
*** And, you completed skipped over the culpability of the Democratic party. They both form a duopolistic threat to democracy.

* Fishy

*** I think it's already being done.
** https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/27/bulldoze-the-business-school
*** Many excellent arguments that I wish those psychopaths were more willing to articulate before. Unfortunately, I don't see an apology. I don't see remorse. I don't see a person who thinks he has contributed to the enslavement and end of humanity. It's just "wailing" ideology to him. He doesn't get to wash his hands like this. Anyone who has seen what he has for 20 years, who has contributed to it that profoundly, has a radical debt to pay. He isn't even trying to restore the victim. This is his last minute "I'm not one of them," so he can say "I told you so" and look pretty. This is a lie.

*** Putin has many ties like this. I am not surprised.
** https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21741138-case-it-powerful-oneincluding-poor-countries-universal-health-care-worldwide
*** Will they eventually move to Marxist conceptions? Why are they just now saying this? This is merely about quelling the masses just enough to maintain their enslavement. The argument isn't for anything that wasn't already obvious. This is to help Neo-liberals feel like they actually care. This is a lie.
