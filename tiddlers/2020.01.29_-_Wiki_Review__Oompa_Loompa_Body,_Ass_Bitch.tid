title: 2020.01.29 - Wiki Review: Oompa Loompa Body, Ass Bitch

* [[2020.01.28 - Link Log: Oh Grandma, So That's How You Died]]
** I often find myself saying that sentence out of the blue. Makes me giggle.
* [[2020.01.28 - Wiki Review: Big, Fat, White, Nasty Smellin', Fat Bitch]]
** Conversely, it's rare for a song-based earworm to infect me, but this one does. Maybe it's because it wasn't originally a song.
** This one took quite a while to get through. I'm not used to waiting this long.
*** I like the mile-high view though. Big chunks still tell a story.
** I hope my son will look closely to understand how to model his relationships and to engage in science to overcome our sort of disabilities in this sphere. Thoroughness is expensive. His memory problems can only be overcome effectively with tooling.
** As usual, most of my connections are with people who are ~25. There are exceptions though. 
*** My brother is right. I don't connect with people who lose their idealism and spiral into the egoism of old age. 
**** I wonder if that is something he aims to signal to me without saying it directly. I am expensive to argue with here, even when I'm as generous as I can be. 
** I pull no punches with those who don't read. 
* [[2020.01.28 - TDL: Stay Off The Crack]]
** We're still not in a groove. =/. Everyone in the house is missing it. 
*** Our habits and efficient mindless abuse of fairly accurate models of our day buys us time to explore the unknown outside the everyday. We're still going to need to just be practical for now.  
* [[2020.01.28 - Prompted Introspection: Wish Animals]]
** Edited. Nope, can't silly my way out of that one.
* [[2020.01.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Early]]
** I hesitate a guess: maybe the reason I woke up was that the my brain couldn't confabulate an answer out of his mouth that would also bear the limited scrutiny I was going to give it. It seemed pretty important.
* [[2019.11.21 - chameleon: nihao~]]
** I wish I had a more reliable vehicle. I could have guaranteed being able to see her. =/. 
* [[2019.11.30 - chameleon: Snarf, Tday, & Coffee]]
** Ugh, I should avoid MTG. =(. Fun as fuck, of course. It's not the appropriate use of my time. I know it's a cool device for getting together, but I don't have enough self-control here.
* [[2019.12.02 - chameleon: Iwartfart Brackets]]
** See, I'll just keep talking about it (and, redundantly at that, lol!). I've gotta stop. 
** I used those brackets before.
* [[2019.12.03 - chameleon: Vidya Games]]
** I think this is an important window for us. It may be a matter of fairly different goals (and reasoning about the nature of goals).
* [[2019.12.06 - chameleon: Concept of Gaming]]
** I'd like to think we both bend over backward to see each other's background in a way. Her reaction is fairly kneejerk (and mine as well). #notallX. 
* [[2019.12.07 - chameleon: thiccbois]]
** Trying to find something to connect on which isn't direct disagreement, but MTG isn't so interesting to her. It's a feeling out process. 
* [[2019.12.12 - chameleon: Meatspace]]
** Yeah, we haven't yet, but we will! =)
** It is fascinating to see these two relationships develop so differently. Despite far less information, it felt quicker with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]: but our disagreement is much smaller. I am still honored to hear him speak in a way that assumes {[[Axioms]]} I strongly disagree with.  
*** I'm honored to have the chance to believe in [[chameleon]]'s sincerity (which is not what I'd attribute to such a name usually). 
**** It's fascinating to see her make commitments (in degrees) and work to recognize the consequences of those commitments (including the preconditions to rationally holding them). I'm still convinced she aims to be methodical. 
*** She's limited in how she describes/explains her own narrative, but she gives a window into her personality and does a great job of developing her emotionally driven philosophical beliefs and brawling rhetorical style. 
**** I'm especially fond of her willingness to change her mind that far down. I really don't see many people with the courage.
* [[2019.12.22 - chameleon: Articles]]
** [[gfwiwcgws]]. Yeah, she probably has more in common in [[gwern]] on a number of fronts. Would be cool to see them connect.
** I think my connections with weebs tend to be that I'm an outcast in general. It's not the same level of interest for me. The belief+desire gap is pretty huge in a lot of ways. I try to be extra kind to the aliens among us, and I know I'm already alienating enough.
* [[2019.01.25 - chameleon: XMas]]
** She's right. It is hard to get a group going which sticks. Commitment is rare. Hopefully, we will be a fine exception of sorts, even if it isn't offline and in-person. I fear I would feel more isolated than she does. She makes it work. 
*** I'm glad she lives in/near the city. Rural areas would be much harder for her.
* [[2020.01.01 - chameleon: New Years]]
** I should have just left the home as-is. I knew they weren't going to be honest about the deposit. 
* [[2020.01.05 - chameleon: Reciprocity]]
** Cool to see her. I honored by the extension of trust. 
** This move for us was more complex than the move to Thailand in the sense that there was no one to catch us, finances were more complicated, and the timing of a number of events had to line up. But, it wasn't as hard, thankfully. I'm grateful to have older children at this point.
* [[2020.01.09 - chameleon: Writer's Block]]
** I'm never satisfied by the answers I've seen to that question, including my wife's. I don't have enough literature under my belt is my bet.
** I have reader's block. Lol. I still haven't picked up reading again. It's okay. My wife has stopped as well. Piecing it together.
* [[2020.01.15 - chameleon: The Spirit]]
** It would probably trip on the markup too. I'm still not convinced it is effective enough to be worth our time. That may change one day. 
** It wouldn't work on hers yet, but she could combine it with her other writing. Perhaps in a year, she'd have enough on the wiki alone.
* [[2020.01.16 - chameleon: Wiki History]]
** I think I came across wrong here. I'm doing my best to point in fitting directions for the question she asked. Without systematically traversing the [[Timeline]], she's at a disadvantage in understanding what I'm doing here. Hopefully, this will be something we can revisit in time. I am interested in her wiki-fu. 
* [[2020.01.20 - chameleon: Saga Cards]]
** I am white trash, lol. Born poor AF (though, my female donor has known what real wealth looks like). Hotpockets were //treats// for us growing up. We had to grow our own food, so microwaveable dinners were awesome.
* [[2020.01.24 - chameleon: DOR]]
** It would be valuable for her to read the entire section of [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. 
*** Her strawmen arguments do not help her. 
*** That is, by far, the most important letter on the wiki so far. It would be difficult to understand what I'm doing here, [[FTO]]-wise, without understanding what that letter is doing and saying.
** I think it's awesome that [[DOR]] is the {[[axiom]]} she's picking out. //Obligation// is a word she wrestles with, understandably (me too); I hope to see it spiral for her. Currently, I don't see growth in her perspective (there are places where I model people quickly and accurately; philosophical perspectives being one of them), but I see her fleshing out a firmer stance embedded in her feelings. I'm glad she's making material to work with. It's very expensive, and she's much better at it than the vast, vast majority of people I've met.
*** She's got that [[beautiful]] switching between asskicking rhetoric and humility.  
* [[2020.01.27 - chameleon: C'mon boi]]
** I wonder what she thinks is worth eating up her life. I still don't know the answer to that yet. It will be difficult to wield normative words like "worth" with me.
* [[2019.11.01 - AA: Joys]]
** It must be difficult speaking with a man who thinks her father doesn't deserve to live. I still value her kindness to him though.
** With my Senpais, we struggle to speak directly, but we actually read each others lives. 
* [[2019.11.06 - AA: Thinking About Family]]
** It's a relationship that stays at arms length usually, maybe a FB relationship which seems bonded by something other than being with other significantly.
* [[2019.11.14 - AA: They Make Her Smile]]
** Maybe? They already seem to struggle a lot even without kids. If they do, I [[hope]] they adopt. It's the only morally defensible position these days. 
* [[2019.11.20 - AA: Procrastinating With The Best]]
** Her ability to empathize can be so powerful sometimes. It's not something she so evenly distributes; she plays favorites with who she will rationalize for or defend. Still, it's often good work.
* [[2019.12.01 - AA: Thanksgiving]]
** That should be clarified. She likes making family gatherings. She is talented at it too.
* [[2019.12.08 - AA: Car Repair]]
** I'd like to try a weighted blanket out. Maybe my wife would as well.
* [[2019.12.12 - AA: Aunt Mary]]
** Wow. =(. That has made her life significantly more difficult these past couple months. As I saw on the trip, there was still a lot to think about there.
* [[2019.12.18 - AA: Death Certificates]]
** That's such a weird position to be in. She's grown a thicker skin or a "no skin off my back" approach in some ways. 
* [[2020.01.25 - AA: XMas Cups]]
** Those cups are really nice. Made for fewer dishes on the trip too.
* [[2020.01.02 - AA: Post-Vacay]]
** I adore how quickly my son identified what could be radically improved upon in that activity. 
* [[2020.01.03 - AA: The Move]]
** I am still surprised that they've picked up dogs. That's a change.
* [[2020.01.10 - AA: Gpa]]
** I see my job as trying to listen to her here. I just shoot out the pleasantries. I am interested in her well-being.
* [[2020.01.23 - AA: Getting Healthy]]
** It's so weird to be going for a degree you don't respect. I would know, lol. It's really the piece of paper she wants, and staying busy. The difficulty of raising [[AG]] shows up here.
* [[2019.11.02 - GB: Clarification]]
** That wasn't an argument. Sorry, bud. I can't help you there.
* [[2019.11.08 - GB: ML]]
** It's been fascinating to see us both become tankier over time. When we were 25, it was unbecoming. I was even pacifist! Lawdy. Unfortunately, there are few who are qualified to define it. He's got half of the equation, which is wildly better than most I see.
* [[2019.11.12 - GB: Affection]]
** I think it's good that he's buckling down on academic philosophy instead.
* [[2019.11.16 - GB: Ad Hominem]]
** It's interesting to see the difference between his argumentation on a place like Reddit and what you'll find in a classroom from him. He's extremely careful in a classroom. It's an emotional unload on the web though. He'll walk up to the edges with me and be like, meh, fuck that, so much work. XD.
* [[2019.11.22 - GB: Niceties]]
** Yup, this is where the break begins. I think it will be left to pleasantries for a while, or perhaps he'll vent on a particular political event. It is my honor to listen.
* [[2019.12.14 - GB: UK Election]]
** He doesn't have much poli-phil beyond the Continental side, but he often has good intuitions even without the formal training. It's impressive.
* [[2019.12.25 - GB: Florida]]
** Ah, I fear I am just doing damage. Fuck.
* [[2020.01.07 - GB: Done Traveling]]
** Yup. He's being polite. I'm stuck here. He doesn't have many people who listen to closely about his pain, but I'm living the life he lost. =/. I should let him do all the talking.
* [[2019.11.06 - gh057: Destin]]
** no u. =). Lol.
* [[2019.11.20 - gh057: Love You]]
** Some of the few moments of sanity I experienced at the job were talking with The Janitor. I'm lucky to have had him there for perspective.
* [[2019.12.01 - gh057: Snowdriving]]
** I don't think most people realize that [[Family Time]] has some extremely unpleasant aspects. Although, I don't think most people care. Lol. Yeah, that's cool bruh. XD. It's a commitment.
* [[2019.12.08 - gh057: How About You?]]
** Fuck. I wish I had more people like him in my life. I enjoyed just getting drunk with him. Lol. It's so rare for me.
* [[2019.12.13 - gh057: Party]]
** Well, if I get to see him again, hopefully we'll have a great party.
* [[2019.12.20 - gh057: Packing]]
** It's still not got much depth to it in the end. I don't know how much depth can be achieved though, and I'm okay with that.
* [[2019.12.30 - gh057: Gimme Holler]]
** There aren't many grown men in my life who will say: "I love you." World needs more of it.
* [[2020.01.07 - gh057: Miss You]]
** Yeah, I think he's like a much older brother to me. I appreciate that he doesn't mind that I'm retarded.
* [[2020.01.12 - gh057: New Phone]]
** I'd like to take him out to a restaurant up here. The city has so many ethnic treats.
* [[2020.01.15 - Jop: Checking In]]
** I hope she's able to keep the position. She does nurture.
* [[2019.11.20 - UJ: What Up]]
** Not really much to say. Not worth the emotional energy to him, I assume.
* [[2019.11.07 - JRE: Cryptic Sometimes]]
** I'm glad he found it interesting too. It is rare that he discussed something off my wiki these days.
* [[2019.11.12 - JRE: Baby Illness]]
** It emotionally difficult to have a sick child, and a sick baby moreso. Suffering can turn into attachment too. He pours a lot into the baby. I think that 3-month section is going to stick with him for a long time.
