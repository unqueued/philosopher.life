!! If there was one person who you had the power of giving immortality to, who would it be and why?

Presumably, I can't choose myself. Although, I'm not sure I would want it either, lol. 

Also, considering how I think the world is going to change in the next century, it's not clear that immortality would still be a good thing. I need to understand the nature of this immortality, what it entails, etc. Can you lose a limb and continue your immortality? What parts of you are "immortal" and bound together forever, untouchably? Does this imply other superpowers? Would you be forever drowning if you lived underneath the water? Let's assume you have a profound ability to neutralize pain and other kinds of "I'm dying" threats (or that you learn to not have them over time). Let's say immortal in a good way. My answer then is:

My wife. She could live the solitary life, or at least the cat-woman librarian life for all eternity. Give her the tools, and she could comfortably be hermitic. She would be the great narrative-consumer. She would immerse herself in the possible worlds, and she would find the answer (even if would be too late to tell me). I think she would be quite happy in that contemplative life.
