!! Respond to the following gem:

Reform is a word you always ought to watch out for. Like, when Mao started the Cultural Revolution it wasn't called a reform. Reform is a change that you're supposed to like. So as soon as you hear the word reform you can reach for your wallet and see who's lifting it. [...] Subsidy is another interesting word, kind of like reform. It's a subsidy if public funds are used for public purposes. That's called a subsidy. It's not called a subsidy when it goes to private wealth. That's reform or something.

[[Saint Chomsky]] often channels Orwell. The colors of words and shades of connotative meanings are worth our analysis. I aim to stake down definitions as best I can because language is so ambiguous, mushy, smuggling, begs too many questions, and is so emotional that we are easily hoodwinked. I want to be able to trust myself and others, and part of that requires fine-grained controls over interpretation. Obviously, it's not possible to solve it all the way down, though I'm a fan of [[Ithkuil]]. 

Echo chambers amplify the current meanings of many politically charged words and redirect conversations through particular lenses. Word choice in rhetoric and marketing is an artform and behavioral science. Those in power spend time practicing encoding their language like this a great deal.

I don't know what to do about it besides being incredibly pedantic with everyone.
