title: 2018.10.13 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Stay where you are!

Magic offers a number of avenues for testing agency and the mind that psychologists and philosophers could only dream of.

Oh, fuck, I forgot about the Neville scene. Jesus. =(

I remember studying latin and greek roots while reading these books. It made it more fun.

The Weasleys, Order of the Pheonix, and Dumbledore-anything are my favorite scenes. Also I'd love to pleasure McGonagall. This series becomes increasingly personal. I adore it.
