title: 2017.06.14 - Pipefitting Log

Today was productive. I spent my time in the shop. We finished the first 2" simulator fabrication. The takeouts our teacher told us not to do worked out well. We're going to make it 1/16" this time instead of 1/8", since 2" pipe doesn't appear to have the same gaps for us. This may be because I did the majority of the fitting today. Nash and Luke just did the tacking, and Chris and I did the real pipefitting work. I'm glad to see they actually participated more than usual though. In a satisfying way, mounting was very simple, and the valve went on cleanly. 

Afterward, we moved onto drawing up the second 2" simulator fabrication. Mine, of course, was the best (Chris saw it as well). Nash drew a more convoluted one which initially would not have been mountable as a single piece (but he couldn't see why until I walked through it). After some modifications, I showed him that we could still use roughly his idea, but the margin of error and mounting would still be more difficult (I had to explain how it would be possible to Chris and Nash). But, I said we should use his (why not take the challenge, eh?). I asked him to start doing the measuring. This is literally his first time actually participating in the process. He didn't measure though. He didn't do the math either. I did it. I asked for Nash to check it, but he didn't. Chris encouraged him and waited, but Nash didn't. Chris even sent me an SMS telling me what he was doing, since Nash really does need to practice it. He didn't. So, I did the math again, and Chris and debated about our 185" and 184" problem. We did some interpolation and took a couple other measurements. We didn't go whole-hog on it though, but I think it will be fine. It's not an exact science. ;P

We cut the pipe and started beveling it before cleanup time. We will probably finish it tomorrow.

I also helped Matt today quite a bit. His partner, JR, didn't show up until midday. Matt was frustrated significantly by two things. One being that his screwpipe project was hastily thrown together and not tightened every step of the way. This made getting it level and plumb difficult. He spent the better part of the day fixing it, and Chris and I would help him when we could. The other thing which frustrated him was doing fractions. This meth-head can't do basic math. It's sad. Chris and I have been working with him the best we can.

After JR showed up, he got chewed out. He wants to go to prenatal care doctor visits with his GF. My teacher says that unacceptable (my teacher is an asshole at times), and said JR shouldn't have even joined the class. The teacher then went onto say that they will not be allowed to even complete 2 tests a week since they need more shop time. I find this all odd. The guys do need more shop time, that is true, but they aren't wasting their time. Compared to the groups that came before us, we are rockstars. My teacher is having a hard time justifying the class being 12 months long, I think. As I have said many times, he goes out of his way to slow us down. When he runs out of tasks, he literally has us make up our own. He lacks the planning I expect from a teacher. 

After reflection, I have realized that this class could be done in 4 months. Seriously. Pushing very hard, we could a test each day and shop work, assuming everything was taught in person. My teacher is a bad teacher. I just have to own up to it. The reason I've learned so much is that I'm a good student, not because he is a good teacher. I've learned despite him, not in virtue of him.

I also received travel instructions to visit the well-hidden (and ungoogleable) location of Jacobs.

Also, I found TEC's address at lunch. I called them after class, but they said not to come and instead to just apply online. I will adjust my digital resume some more and apply. I also need to send it to my teacher since he wants to e-mail it on my behalf as well. Let us hope he is more useful at this than he has demonstrated for other students.
