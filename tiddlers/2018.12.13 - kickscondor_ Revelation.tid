title: 2018.12.13 - kickscondor: Revelation

Dearest [[Kickscondor]],

Only family could cause me to burn my cores like you do.^^<3^^ You pose me so many riddles that now //I// have the opportunity to pick the [[salience]] out of the flood. You give me quite a gift. You asked The Mule to take off his boxing gloves; don't be surprised to find yet another brawling, broken, recurring jester inside. You do like keepin' it real, dontcha? With no intention of failing,<<ref "fh">> I'm gonna fuck you up. C'mon, get your dukes up, Durden. I can't give you a satisfactorily coherent answer by my standards; I can offer neither of us epistemic closure. You ready for that? I adore that you both know and think you know I'm incoherent (despite my best efforts).<<ref "lp">> Here goes, homie.

You have pushed the button, and now I may not hold back what I have to say. I am not a nice man even when I'm trying to be kind. I'm truly an insufferable human being in most contexts (though not all). I'm every bit the enraging, dogmatic, disdainfully argumentative, judgmental, self-possessed sonofabitch you might [[hope]] I am not (which isn't to say there is nothing lovable or noble about me; ofc, I'm not //just// that). Indeed, I think you know my kind very well; I'm convinced you have significant personal experience with religious zealots like me (this wiki is no accident). I was raised to be a prophet. I shit you not. Can you imagine the audacious insanity of having ~~parents~~ donors who marked their son with this disfigurement? I yam what I yam. Think hard, and you will know my name; I [[h0p3]] to be angelic, prophetic, and a man of [[Good]].<<ref "bh">>

It is difficult for me to know when either of us are joking or being serious at times (no, I'm not joking!<<ref "nf">>). It appears you think I take your jokes too seriously, and I'm worried you all-too-charitably don't take mine seriously enough. My jokes are devolving half-truths; they are genuine broken thoughts made ironically silly as I seriously lose my mind.<<ref "pm">> You are too well-traveled not to know where I am in the desert; you've seen it too (it's written on your face; no one reacts the way you do without having lived that meaningfully meaningless nightmare). You appear to be here with me, deep in the desert, hunting for the motherlode of spice. We have both seen strains of this desert madness before.

Yet another beautiful aspect of your communications is that you inspire paranoia in a lovingly constructive way. You cause doubt playfully and kindly. It's not mere rhetoric; you have so much reasonable purpose in your words that it hurts.<<ref "dn">> That's part of what makes you such a good philosopher.<<ref "na">> I'm indebted to your skepticism. I do my best not to respect people accidentally; and, yes, you have earned it.<<ref "cl">> I will warn you again: I think you should carefully rethink how much you purport to purport to respect me. 

I'm afraid you do not take my literality literally enough. I'm doing my best to honestly mean what I say and say what I mean, including this sentence. I'm never gonna escape this paradox. //I am a box of contradictions, sir.// Are you paying attention?<<ref "pa">> I'm dead serious in {[[About]]}. Everything drips with moral meaning all the way down! I'm certain of it, and I'm certain I'm not certain of it. When all things are possible, nothing is necessarily possible. Faith certainly blows, my Screwtape brother. I'm eating away at me. My internal model of the external standard is so high it constructs and deconstructs everything in me, including itself. My uselessly referential Neurathian ship is sinking into the abyss. No one in their right mind would exit the ready-to-hand mode so extensively they would read or write a wiki like this one unless something was undeniably all wrong (we must both be crazy).<<ref "cr">> Without attempting to be ironic in the least: this wiki is an epic monument to brokenness.<<ref "brag">> 

I must have the access codes to Zion. Tell me: will we ever be able to tell a satisfyingly coherent and mutually justified story with each other and ourselves, [[kicks]]? What's in your beetlebox? Climb up your ladders of meaning you don't really, really believe in and tell me what metamodern sincerity appears to mean from up there. Tell me why you think your fire is real, nomad. Tell me the story of what story your burning bush tells you. 

```bash
/shake; "Answer us, silent one!"
```

What the fuck are we doing here in the desert cave? ლ(ಠ_ಠლ) God, I [[hope]] it's not jest a joke.

You //want// me to offend you. `/facepalm` Fine. I'll turn the Eye of Sauron upon you, [[Cypher|Cypher's Choice]]. So...you are asking me to treat you as I treat myself? Jesus Christ, you really //are// stupid. Have I hurt your feelings by not hurting your feelings enough? Your sensitivity isn't sensible, and your thoughts are thoughtless. How seriously do you want me to tell you the joke that you are? Haven't you already humiliated yourself enough on this wiki? Lol. Shall I denounce, denigrate, dismiss, and discard you further?<<ref "ra">> Fine. [[I hereby codify thee "n̶o̶n̶-degenerate."|2018.09.17 - kickscondor: Dogmackic]] I guess I could tell you [[Why I Might Hate You|Why You Might Hate Me]] (you're welcome). 

What, you want I should call you a selfish nihilist, a brainwashed individualist, an all-too-convenient emotivist, a shallow aesthete, a vapid internalist, a dark-triadic relativist, a deflecting anti-realist, a gas-lighting interlocutor, an actual waste of potential, and a gutless, wallowing, purposely purposeless sissy who hatlessly lacks the integrity to take the existential risk of committing themselves to an identity: i.e., the shadow of my enemy?<<ref "gp">> Are you even a person at this point? No, surely, I must tell you, sac~~k~~ of flesh, how you really appear to me: you seem worthless. Your insignificance deserves to be namelessly nameless.

"Not no; Yeah, right." I DO NOT ASSENT! SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACEHOLE, [[/b/]]!
```

Fuck you, Sir [[Kicks]], for even asking me to do this. This is all too painful. Talking to you is like talking to myself. ''How dare you!'' I can't cast you out of me, sinner, especially because I suspect the non-trivial possibility your unspoken reasons and experiences may be just as valid, profound, and uniquely broken as mine. Unfortunately, the labels I give you just aren't meaningful enough to me (that doesn't mean I should give up; that route too has no meaning). Internalism is a virus I'm forced to wrap and accept. There is no game without at least two players. You stick the quarter in me, but is it just for the funsies, warm fuzzies, and wordie-word pictures? I don't think you think I'm just a game. I think you really do believe there is real beauty and purpose in our conversation. I know courage when I see it.<<ref "kc">> I'm convinced you know [[The Beautiful]] is [[Good]] beyond even your beholding. We'll be self-contradictory boxes brokenly agreeing and contradictorily weaving each other into Kintsukuroi.

No, brother, I hate to disappoint you, but however broken I may be: I got faith in you. I know you are [[Human]]. If you aren't, then I'm not either.

I'm so ready not to have a choice in my faith.<<ref "fa">> I long for the delusion. I would bask in the freedom of finally being unbreakably enslaved to a self-bonding principle. I don't want to be myself anymore, at least not the autonomous version of me. I am resolved to resolve. It would be bliss, sir. Indeed, you appear to wield significant power over me in the information asymmetry of our conversations. I guess you are my BDSM-buddy; you dom and I sub? Perhaps you are the top(-down), and I'm the bottom(-up); you keep sticking it in me. Who's the model, and who's the modeler? Are you enjoying yourself? Does my empathy taste good to you?

I appreciate that I do not scare you off easily, [[kicks]]. Most people who would see me like this flee in terror. Indeed, the truth must sometimes be ugly in order for it to sometimes be beautiful. You tolerant so-and-so, you. Have I covered all the stages of grief thus far in this letter? My emotional machinegun is empty; are you still standing there? If so, I do not know how or why.<<ref "bro">> I will sit in the ashes and weep with you in the desert, Sir. Indeed, I have cried many times writing this terrifying letter. You rip words out of me I do not wish to utter.

`/deep breath`

Alright, back to our regularly scheduled programming:

<<<
https://www.kickscondor.com/comments/s-and-k:-root/

Hate to say this, brother—but I actually think I follow your diagram, hahah—I mean what can I say, it’s terribly complex, but sometimes these things have to be. Yeah and like you say: Rube Goldberg. I say go for the madcap every time. If I tried to diagram my structure in dashes-and-pipes, it’d be like that, too, actually. Ten layers of tooling. Salud.
<<<

I'm new at this. I'm not used to building things like this at all. Yeah, it's kind of madcap to me (but the wiki is that). Zazdarovje.

<<<
You seem quite good at stepping back and asking what the hell you’re doing.
<<<

High praise, thank you.

<<<
I’m going to keep a close eye on all of this, because I think the moment will come when we can bridge Indieweb and your world. It actually won’t offer you much—I think it’ll just automatic copy-and-paste is all. Depends on your feelings about syndication—seems like we both have complicated feelings about RSS. Which, to me, makes it a ripe topic.
<<<

[[Agreed|2018.11.10 - kickscondor: Unmoved Movers]], it is possible (imho, it was possible without node as well). I'm still trying to figure out whether or not it's worth the time. I suggest the distinction between the web and the net has been collapsing for some time, and I'm cynical about the indie framework/protocol treadmill (along with the rest of them, and I am, ofc, just a skiddie). Perhaps that is obviously mistaken. The difference between my expectations (ought) and predictions (is) remains vast, and I don't predict it changing (though we must try). I'm tired of half-measures and duct-tape; my [[hope]] runs dry in compromise. I'm still convinced [[the fundamental structure of the internet is wrong|Tim Berners-Lee]]. I hope there will be a moment where you can think about what [[BDS97]] is constructing (and, yes, we have seen many attempts at this too). 

Syndication is a serious problem. I don't adore CnPing from across so many pages and apps, including moderation, sanitization, and TW-encoding. In too many cases, I suggest the best non-committal, agnostic move and most UNIX-y option is to build workspace/mouse/keyboard macros to copy, parse (I'm probably going to be lazy here), and paste. I'd probably tag the tiddlers "Awaiting Moderation" with everything else put into place (some problems in [[Recent]]/[[New]] I've seen here, but that can be fixed), and my export to singlefile would filter that out. Meh. This does seem like a job best done by hand.

I also grant there is a gap between those who care enough to manually check and those would care enough if only they didn't have to manually check (and I'm not sure if it is valuable enough for me to cross that bridge).<<ref "vb">> As usual, there's no protocol to rule-them-all. I am considering the possibility that a query built via [[Search of h0p3]] could be used by an extension, app, or even a self-updating version of the wiki itself to pinpoint the conditions for a "notification." Perhaps one day there might be an even more customizable [[Update Scanner Add-On|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/update-scanner/]]. I'd prefer syndication/custom-subscription was done clientside using just the imported wiki as input.<<ref "madc">> I want to emit exactly one thing: a single html file. I don't trust any software stack enough to invest otherwise. I don't know what I'm really doing though.  That's probably crazy, and I am grateful for your advice and thoughts on the matter. 

<<<
Oh, I agree with you—I do the same thing on my site. I don’t ever use a query (filterlist)—I always hardcode links. It’s too important to lay it out right. It also forces me to limit the amount of meta-pages I have. I think they have to be used judiciously because people aren’t going to wade through a whole lot of meta. Those kind of automatic pages always lead to bland, repetitive layouts.

It’s evident that you hand-build your pages and they are 10x more appealing as a result (e.g. your link logs are ace).
<<<

We are back to the form vs. function debate. I regret that I do not know much about it, but I'm trying to figure it out.

I intend to continue handcrafting my wiki (I'm not convinced this could be an act of autonomy if I didn't). I also want to get in a rut to the point that some parts are habit and algorithmic (part of the virtue-theoretic equation). New stuff has to be handcrafted (that's the place to be messy and creative), but I want to be able to evolve some projects in order to efficiently and safely build objects too. I need both! There are simply too many functions that I need to do by hand.

<<<
This is sweet—I am trying to do a lot of the same things. In fact, I’ve just got things working so that I can post from different machines at last. I’m going to end up very close to the top-half of your diagram: all my posts and layouts get checked in to Git, but I still need to do a bit of work on my outputs to Dat and single-file HTML.
<<<

I would, of course, like to know how you do it if you are able to tell me.

<<<
You have any other pointed questions—weak points you’re worried about?
<<<

* What would you do differently?
* Do my current signature scripts seem acceptable to you?
** I'm considering hiding my signatures.
* You aren't as huge a fan of TW; should I move elsewhere?
** Spacemacs would be a contender.
** I don't know how many tools I can learn well.
** I have such a hard time imagining a better workflow per unit of energy.
* I'm trying to find the best decentralizable ways to add user permissions.
** Currently, there are those who have [[Root User]] access. I have no idea how to do this safely and efficiently.
* If you were going to madcap [[dream]] about where I should go in the desert, where do think you I should go?
* Where am I being too paranoid or have too much pre-optimizing when I shouldn't? Where am I lacking enough of either?

<<<
https://www.kickscondor.com/stenos/h0p3

This is my first ‘person’ page.
<<<

You have had to wait quite a while for me to respond to this page; it sent me into a think. If I'm going to do you any justice, [[kicks]], I'm going to need to parse it aloud. You know you want it. It just won't do for me not to be myself talking about myself. It just wouldn't be right. I'm too narcissistic not to look in the infinite mirror. Also, why did you draw my face all crooked?

To the opening quote: imho, that is false. I suggest you are joking. Your librarian work is basically that. That may be your point. Lawyered.

<<<
And, of course, h0p3 has been doing this for a very long time and I am only copycatting. His are ‘light-hearted plain-web d0xxings’ or somesuch—email, address, phone number, links to conversations. Mine are just that person’s words and my thoughts in summation—which is far more of a calling card to me, particularly after these other identifiers have expired.
<<<

I will, of course, listen closely to your arguments. You keep stickin' the quarter in me. What should and shouldn't we model about others out loud, in what contexts, [[irwartfrr]]? 

Why do you model me? (Maybe you think you answered this question effectively enough. I'm slow.)

<<<
As with most things, though, I am still playing catching with him. He says in Find the Others:
<<<

[[k0sh3k]] (also, if you happen to know someone who knows someone who knows Cumberbuns, hook a girl up) and I adore your cute locutions. Your food tastes like shit (no offense), but your words rarely smell bad. I don't know how you folks do it.

<<<
> I believe that by honestly uploading my mind into my wiki, we both have access to an enriched network of references for generating accurate theories of each other’s minds.

Ahh, dear me, so then it takes much more than a page—this entire endeavor is sunk. There can be no eulogy or summation. It would take a massively overloaded TiddlyWiki to accurately describe such an one as this…
<<<

Thank you for taking the time to think about it with me. I'd like to know to what extent, if any, your opinions have changed in our timeline and why. 

I believe the blokes I know would interpret that sentence as sarcasm (as you point out). I will, of course, claim my endeavor isn't pointless even though I can never reach the point. But, you are saying that too. =)

<<<
>    To some non-trivial extent, the labels, attributes, characteristics, properties, and models I generate about a person help form a kind of name.

...

>    I am inevitably forced to use labels, adjectives, etc. to model (boxing things in is what makes it computable information at all for us).

Ah, well—so this page is my box. And these are the things I put it in it.
<<<

I'm honored to have you stick me in your cubby-hole.

Even a glance through my writing will show you billions of grammar errors. I despise grammar-nazification of the dialectic (your argument is bad because your face is ugly), but I still don't know enough about you to comfortably feel confident about when you have been accidental or essential. [[k0sh3k]] thinks "it in it" is a grammatical error. I am not certain (though she is almost always right). I am [[Straussian]]ly not immediately convinced this is an accident; it feels like recursion and dialectic to me.

<<<
(If you meet someone—someone with ASCII glasses on, say—and they purport to be a ‘madman in the desert’—then put this page straight away. FOR YOU NOW have the genuine artifact in front of you!)
<<<

HUZZAH! Lol. It's as genuine as I know how to make it. I'm doing my best over here. I'll work on getting an ASCII-Dickpic plastered into one of my cubby-holes for you (protip: you're gonna need to zoom in; it's basically just one big v~~a~~ein).

<<<
(However, if you are uncertain, you can do one more thing: you can tell the man a joke. Like: a homunculus and a dark triadic memetic walk into a bar. He will stop you. ‘Let me stop you right there. Before you finish, please know that I am quite literally autistic and your elegant form of advanced humor which you are so carefully deploying might end up lost in my limbic system somewhere. Forgive me, please, and tell your joke, and thank you for saying it is a joke—k0sh3k will laugh at me later for this, but I will test out three interpretations of the joke with you now and then have her review the transcripts later…’)
<<<

Let me stop you right there. Are you having a laugh? That is not where I'd stop you, certainly not mid-joke. You can't even tell your own dodgy joke accurately. I'm offended: I would at least charitably allow you to finish the paragraph first. Alright, now pay attention class:

```
If Britain leaves the European Union, do you know how much space will be opened up?

1 GB
```

See how I waited for the joke to finish?<<ref "sph">> That's how the conversation train works, Tommy. Only after you had delivered your cocked up gobby bollocks (and dug your own grave) could I be arsed to fix your clanger. Now watch closely (Kaufman is gonna learn you suh-mm): 

Although I can't be certain (the pursuit of which is self-contradictory), if I understand correctly (and I may not since your elegant form of advanced humor which you are so carefully deploying may have whooshed right over my autistic head), that joke is funny on multiple levels, to various [[dok]], and stands in relation to [[The Beautiful]] through recursive dialectics which my [[fff]] mind could only [[hope]] to fathom. 

* Firstly, the joke is about a political catastrophe worming its way through our entire species. What could be more hysterical? 
* Point B, the syntax `1 GB` can model, represent, correlate to, or functionally map onto at least two different sets of semantics. This results in an absurdity between two opposing interpretations from which humor emerges somewhere between your limbic system and neocortex.
*# 1 := one, or the lowest cardinal number, or half of two, and so on and so forth.
*# [GB := Grate Britain] ∨ [GB := Jigabyte]
*# Leaves(britain, eu) -> KnowQuantityOfSpaceOpened(you, it, up)
*# 1 GB
*# - - - (Oh, fun random fact, did you know Seint Frege used the following symbol for his turnstiles? 𓂺𓂺𓂺)
*## Assume [GB := Grate Britain] for the sake of proof by cases
*## 𓂺𓂺𓂺
*## By the [[SO]] substitution principle, it is analytically the case that a single geopolitical space the geographic size of Grate Britain will be "opened up" in what used to be a slave-empire to the EU. That is evil, and evil is unreasonable by definition. Therefore, I call shenanigans.
*### Lemma: This is {[[axiom]]}atically related to Israel and Palestine as well. And, never forgetti: (((✈ ▌▌)))
*## ⊥
*## Assume [GB := Jigabyte] for the sake of proof by cubbyholes
*## 𓂺𓂺𓂺
*## Since a jigabyte is the number of electrons contained on a 1,024 Megabyte 5400RPM WD HDD filled with jif images of ⦗h0p3's Wiki⦘, we can therefore conclude a [[dialetheia]], which is truly an absurdity.
*## ⊥
*# ⊥ -- ∨Elim: 2, 5.1-5.4, 5.5-5.8
*# Therefore, this joke is funny to at least one person on the planet urf.
*## I'm laughing right now.
* Git'r'done
* ???
* Prophets must point out how schadenfreude is sometimes pursued through a memetic warfare by which the homunculi of dark-triads execute algorithms designed to induce pain in [[others]] simply to vampirically feed upon and convert their unhappiness into mere hedonic pleasure. Some jokes are zerosum transfers of energy. And, while I can't be certain, I'm pretty sure the cruelty of a joke must be at someone's expense (even if only conceptually in the surprise necessary to generate feelings of "entertainment"...we don't want to get bored, after all).
** Surely we must decentralize the costs of this cosmic joke, for if we do not, the joke will centralize in its power to the point that it becomes sentient and wipes out all life in our solar system. The only solution will be for everyone to start writing furiously in their wikis to stop it.
** It is as this point that my ~~annoying~~ wonderful daughter points out to me that I can neither take nor make a joke.

To be fair, not everyone will find this joke funny. This is why we have to break jokes down into a form that everyone can understand.<<ref "2019.01.25">> For if a joke cannot be translated, you have built a private language with a one-man inside joke (umm...private languages are bad, mmmkay). QED.

Before I finish, let me also add that if your joke took you a paragraph, I'm going to need at least 12 paragraphs...3 tiddlers, 2 decentralized protocols, and a month in a hash tree to determine its [[gfwiwcgws]] in all possible worlds and respond [[irwartfrr]]. I guess my real problem is that you've not steelmanned my wordsalad masturbation habits thoroughly enough. Can you please restate your position? I will think carefully about it. After all, [[IA2DYJ]].

<<<
(These overwhelming feelings of endearment and admiration and sheer pity that are now coming over you will now materialize in the form of laughter.
<<<

OHEMGEE. Ack. I agree. Thank you. =)

<<<
The joke that was designed to pique the curiosity has now been outpiqued by a new curiosity: one in ASCII glasses that has gone to such great extent to analyze the joke that has been placed on the table—and, now look—this analysis has expanded everything in sight. You look at the joke and see that it is much bigger. And the conversation is now expanded, it is bigger. And the table—the table is much bigger, too!)
<<<

You know, the worst part is, [[kickscondor]], I legitimately don't know when you are joking nearly as well as you think I do (or you were testing for it). It's a solid mix of stupidity and paranoia. It wasn't until you flat out said you were, in fact, joking that I was convinced of it. You might think that's really fucking sad. I'm sorry. I seriously took your joke to heart as best I could. 

I am glad to have you at the table, sir.

<<<
(Ok, now, tell me: did you laugh? Did you feel some endearment and admiration and some pity? I don’t know if you will enjoy or love h0p3 as much as I do, or as much as I purport to—if not, well, then I understand that, too. There was a time when I thought that I would only frustrate him or that he might just annoy me—I was reluctant to say anything or to take the time to read so very many words…)
<<<

Oh, I did. I also had mixed feelings about it, which you knew I would. You are correct: I am not going to be able to please everyone. Whose approval do you think I should seek, [[kickscondor]]? Why?

<<<
(But what is life but a chance to expand a joke, to make the conversation a little longer, or to fancy that maybe even the table at which we sit has now grown?)
<<<

I am strongly in favor of this sentiment. But, of course, achually, I think even those ends must serve a higher purpose. While my calculator ain't so hawt, I'm convinced it all adds up, homie.

<<<
>    I aim to do you justice.

It’s that chivalrous, sensible, steelnivorous h0p3—he steels you up, then it’s all night steel for breakfast!
<<<

This is yet another sentence I've been chewing on for a while. I ended upon [[hlexical]]izing your incredibly charitable vision.

<<<
This short sentence is a trope of h0p3. He ‘aims’—he has a very specific set of purposes in mind for you, good good, his work is a pointed effort. A discovery of truth? A deep sea recovery of some rarified moral sense? I cannot characterize it properly. But to ‘aim’ is truly a bold facet.
<<<

High praise, thank you. I really am as insanely teleological as you may worry.

I'm grateful for your discussions of the tropes which comprise my identity. You are helping me crystallize my 10-layer madcap character.

That h0p3 labels himself a ‘madman’, a ‘jester’, a ‘retard’ and so on—well, this is a rich tradition and these are rarified, very colorful and storied appellations. I do think of Zamyatin—who is forgotten to our society, but who was prescient to the disasters of the 20th Century that he lived in. We was a catalyst to the entire utopian and dystopian genres. (I have no doubt that my beloved Vigoleis also saw himself among this rabble.)

This is cause for alarm—and I see this in h0p3’s more dismayed dispatches from time to time—the world will not be kind to him. However, he is a heretic—we know this. He must do his work; it is too valuable.

Wow! I have no idea why I've never seen these quotes or heard of Zamyatin before. Preach, yo! I am reminded of this [[antipleonasm]]: [[Exilic Lifestyles]].

You also offer me praise I have yet to earn and a goal I am not convinced I will achieve. I will try, of course. I also want to point out that I really am socially developmentally challenged. If I knew how to say "these many words" in fewer, I would. Those labels are half-truths to me. You're being too kind when you have the charity to even imply otherwise.

I'd like to add that if you get to be Sir [[Kickscondor]] the Librarian, I want to be Sir [[h0p3]] the Heretic. Besides my wife, I've never heard anyone else say it outloud. I appreciate that a great deal. Thank you. It means a lot to me.

> I’m glad to have the chance to engage in this. I am pretty goddamned worried I’m going to offend him right here.

I felt very worried about this, too, while I was working on my page for you. I was teasing you, of course. And that can feel like all the respect I might have is discarded for cheap sarcasm.
<<<

I love that you tease me, [[kicks]]. As you can see, I'm not used to it coming from a good place. They are often painful reminders of many trees of thought and experiences to me. You will have to forgive me for doubting your meaning; that is not a reflection of you.

<<<
However, I think relationships need to be tested to see what they can withstand —one of the ‘teases’ on that page is that I paint you as having this overly analytical sense of humor and I take a shot at autism. This is pretty cruel!
<<<

I am honored that you would take the time to test and tease me; it is [[T42T]]esque. Your teasing hits the mark more than you realize. My family and I laughed because you hit it dead fucking on. It was too vivid coming off the screen not to think it real.

<<<
But your sense of humor is not really that way at all—your sense of humor is completely transgressive and degenerate—it’s fantastic—and part of your great work is in perpetually nailing up these new self-portraits of yourself that are ridiculous and grotesque—the jester in the almighty courts—though I think you see your inner self as very noble and refined, in a way. 
<<<

That's ridiculously high praise. I will spend more time trying to understand this jester, and I appreciate your bringing it to my attention. You are right that I think I'm trying to be noble and refined with what I've got. The line between the absurd and The Sublime is not one I understand well enough (you probably know it much better than I do). Most of the time, I would characterize my humor as dark, dirty, childishly (and hypocritically) either purely absurd or no-nonsense, and especially annoying. In person, I don't think you would find me funny at all! 

You talk about the "inner self." I'm still workin' this one out. I know that's an obvious claim, right? Furthermore, I have no acceptable theory myself, and so I ask you something which I hypocritically have no right to ask. I would be indebted to you, however, for your generalized theory of mind. If you prefer me not to respond to it, I won't (yeah, I am tiresome ;P)! I just want to know what you think about what it's like to think. What counts as our selves to you?

<<<
My writing this effacing page of you is simply the act of doing your work for you. You do this to yourself anyway on any given day—I am just joining you for once.
<<<

You did a bang up job. Dude, I am slow!

See, [[kicks]], I can't offer you the same kind of model. I can't imitate you like this, and I'm sad to say, your imitation was so spot on, I wasn't even sure it was imitation. It reminds me of N^^th^^ degree artistic realism wherein you don't even realize you are looking at a representation.

Penetrating my Kanye West ~~magnanimity~~ pitiful insanity. =) Lol. That was amazing. We roast the ones we love.<<ref "gr">> I am so touched by this. You did it! My kids were laughing too (my wife roared laughing, and even my brother [[JRE]] was moved by it). It was like being roasted and hugged at the same time. I actually shed a tear at the end; that might be one of the kindest things anyone has ever said to me. Clearly, you know the [[Good]] in Romanticism. I am largely blind in that desert, and you paint the picture so intelligibly for me. I am moved by your empathy.

<<<
So I’m glad it gave you a laugh for a moment—I don’t think you’ve said anything remotely offensive to me, which is pretty disappointing. I would think that you of all people could pull it off and I’d like to see you try. My fear is that I’ve not revealed enough of myself for you to hang on to—so it may take some time for you to discover that I am a grotesque in a completely different form: I am an emotional wreck, crying and pleading day after day, a small and insignificant creature in my real form—weak and crushable like Gandalf’s little moth buddy that flits around in the chaos, whisphering insignificant greetings.
<<<

This is the part of the letter that turns my stomach inside and out. I have done my best to be offensive to you, to fuck with you, to be realistically hateful, to say the worst things I can imagine to you everywhere else in this letter. But, I gotta say, this section is far more like the worst thing I could ever imagine having to say to you. It makes me question whether or not I should be honest. I may not offend you, but I feel the weight of causing you to suffer and relive your grief. I'm sitting here in tears for the tenth time reading these words yet again. I don't know what to do about it, [[kicks]]. I literally aim to do you justice, and that includes witnessing or even imagining witnessing who you are.

I can tell my eyes deceived me; I was wrong again.<<ref "d">> You are literally in more pain than I could imagine.<<ref "i">> I am straight up panicked in the desert holding your hand. I am not trained to heal these fatal wounds; it is outside of my power to contend with them appropriately. There aren't logs in your eyes; you are bleeding out while sitting at the table. How could I not see it? Why did I allow myself to doubt it? Your stiff-upper-lip must be legendary.

I'm sorry to disappoint. I'm not there yet either. Your suffering means too much to me to make fun of it.<<ref "ro">> I am your pseudonymous witness in the desert. //The Event// which has mutilated you is so fucking real to me.<<ref "k0">> It borders on the absurd and farcical; the joke is too much to bear as a joke. I cannot prod you here. I feel it when I touch it, sir. Those wounds cause me to scream. I cannot laugh with you until I have wailed with and for you. You have not even said it out loud. It's deafening. I don't have a right to say it out loud either; what I assume to be the truth is that fucking horrifying to me.<<ref "h">> I do not know how you handle it. It's so radioactive: I'm living in it.<<ref "rm">> I know I only feel a tiny fraction of a semblance of your grief, and it's killing me. I am worried that you are alone.

I have formally studied the problem of evil for a long time, and it has shattered my faith. Here, however, no one is qualified to talk about it but you. This is probably part of why people make art. It is so blinding that we call it the ineffable; we can only ever point with our words. Here I can point, but I dare not prod you while you are dying in the desert. Your construction requires the courage to lose part of yourself that I cannot master. Oh, I can imagine the existential need to just be able laugh about the grotesque nightmare and what appears to generate the privation of meaning itself: that //would// be The Sublime.<<ref "mc">> Some of your pain washes over me. I do not know how you are even standing up in the desert. Grace blinds me through suffering. I cannot bear to know it. Do you really wish me to say this thing out loud? Do you wish me to make fun of it? I can't! If you can't, how could I? I can only weep with you. 

I'm feeling frantic to make sure I'm a help rather than a hindrance to you here. I offer you the ol' yeller clause of our friendship; if I'm not good for you, please do not hesitate to end this with me. I employ humor about the grotesque and absurd in and around us with my family, but there are lines I do not cross. You are my brother (or my father or an angel), but I don't have enough faith in myself to make fun of the cause of your pain here (I fear even making fun of your pain itself). I am so sorry. You ask such a tall order; you have every right to ask it of me (and at the same time, I am worried it is still just fundamentally morally wrong to do so). You think more highly of my decorative healing humor than I do. You cause an exception to emerge in my program. My anticodificationism here is a token of respect for your loss; I do not wish to lamely put words to what has been ripped out of you. 

My guttural calculations still say I do not have [[The Right]]; you can individually consent to this thing with me, but I really don't feel like I have the collective right to do so (I still do not have the eyes and ears necessary: and that is not your fault!). I cannot push the button you ask me to push. I am worried, in fact, that it is two buttons so profoundly linked that I cannot peel them apart in/on/around you. I do not have the words to be surgically precise enough; if I am too messy here: I will damage you (and I hope never beyond repair). I predict failure in my triage. I value you too much to take this risk. Is this an emergency which requires me to just take the leap of faith in the [[hope]] that I can cure you by being humorous with you? Do I not have any time left to wail; must I amputate the segment of [[Humanity]] from you (I do not think I even can; it is truly a part of you)? 

You need to know that [[my beloved|k0sh3k]] is a woman who has literally been baptized by fire.<<ref "tr">> She died (anaphylaxis) when they gave her morphine to handle the pain. Some say burns without meds inflict the highest physical pain possible - or, more precisely, the removal of burned flesh, exposing the nerves to air with no skin to protect them; it's literal torture. Sadly, there are a couple other equally profoundly painful events in her life, one of which has been a life-ending kind of grief to even conceive. I believe you have experienced a psychic pain I'm not qualified to talk about for so many reasons. I don't wish it on my worst enemies. There's no way to make up for it, fix it, or make it right. Nothing's the same.

I can say her suffering has changed her into a beautiful person. There is a cosmic asymmetry in her; she is a gift to all who know her. 

{{Text Art: I Love You||ASCII: 100%}}

One of things which is beautifully striking about your absurdly flattering hypertext object is that you accept me as your retarded brother (all of my family do me a great kindness in this) that sometimes has a good point to make (even if this bastard takes fucking forever to say it to you).

<<<
Hahhaha! My God—it’s so much funnier when you mock yourself than when I do. I do accept you as my retarded brother!! Can I be yours as well? I am not as retarded as you are, of course, but I will try to be! I am daftly sucking the collar of my lime t-shirt as we speak. I am fully wetting it, brother.
<<<

Of course, of course, brother! Thank you. FWIW, you may be one of the most rarifiedly retarded people I've ever met. That's probably why you mean more to me than I can explain. 

The worst part is that, as [[k0sh3k]] would tell you, my honesty is funnier than was intended. You're giving me way more credit than is due. I also hope you know I'm really only half-mocking myself (you so charitably imply there's no truth in it); I sincerely consider myself partially retarded in important ways. I'll be the first to show you my redonkulously awesome e-Penis, but that feeds into my stupidity too beautifully. I am glad you know to laugh! Lol. I really do think my family does me a great kindness in dealing with me. It takes a special kind of a failure of a human being to do what I do.

-=[ My model of you I construct is meant to be [[kickscondor]] (and the network of references throughout this wiki which can only be found through search right now), and I grow it primarily through our interactions. Yet, I would like to extend my trust to you further at no cost to or expectation of you. I aim to radically cooperate with you in the desert.

As I draft this letter, I ask you think about if and how you wish this (for me: joyous) problem to be resolved. It has been a significant point of contention for us as well, and you may not wish to engage in it at all (completely up to you). I would like to send my cards to an address (which will not be disclosed on this wiki) of your choosing (I can also just send you the digital copies).<<ref "p">> Anyone who cares about me and my wiki to the extent you do should have physical access to me (which, for all I know, you already do). I am not asking for you to do the same (and, I think anonymous librarians are absolutely critical). As I have said before, I do not know your {[[Principles]]}, but I will take the leap from my empirical model to your [[Humanity]] on faith. It's time I start picking a deeper Bob turtle of "turtles all the way down." I fully anticipate further asymmetry in our trust dynamics (and, I'm fine with that). ]=-

<<<
>    Yet, I would like to extend my trust to you further at no cost to or expectation of you.

(Since I am responding to a draft, I am just hanging on to this sentence in case it disappears. It’s just wonderful. It reminds me of a travelling salesman—my Trust, the whole Caboodle, the brushes, the Extension Arm for the trust and the fur-lined Encasement—all at no additional cost. All I ask is that you do nothing. Don’t move a muscle.)
<<<

It has been my experience that I'm required to sell myself to people. This is literally how human interactions go. Salesmanship is famously dark-triadic. It is vital to me that I can sell myself to the devil without becoming one.

Who and what do you sell yourself to? What's worth whoring yourself out for?

<<<
I am not to this point yet. This is probably a bit awkward to navigate—let me just say that I don’t see my correspondence with you as a short-term whim. It is a long game. We have a lot of years ahead of us to find out why the hell we’re talking to each other and what the Fuck is going on.
<<<

You just don't want me to glitterbomb you. Foiled again; I'll get you next time!

I must admit: I feel like I know why I'm talking to you. I'm not sure I could say it any clearer. Maybe you don't know why, but I know why I do. I can't say I know what the fuck is going on though. That will be the intermediate goal.

In any case, if you ever did need to reach me in the moment, you will be able to. I will be looking for you, pseudangel.

<<<
You can ask and say anything—I think it’s amazing that you would want to pass cards, converse and possibly make chat logs together. But this blog is not me quite yet. I am emerging from two years of great sorrow and struggle. I am trying to find my way—not through depression, but just through grief. “Kicks” is my prototype for this self that could survive.

I am building him and you’re helping me greatly. Hopefully he will appear in more realistic and fully-fledged forms. I am not catfishing; I am just trying to have fun again. I think it’s working.
<<<

Alright, prototyper. That is at least the second stake you have placed down for us. You hope to survive. I can appreciate the instrumental need of having a sufficient amount of fun in your gastank. How else can we outrun or outgun the road-warriors in this apocalyptic desert?<<ref "rw">> As always, I want to know what kinds of fire are worth surviving for.

I adore being able to choose one's name. It is the ability to choose one's identity in moral mediums. It's a quintessential example of agency to me.

I will be listening carefully to you. I don't think I've experienced nearly the same sorrow or struggle you have, but I can attest to the fact that choosing [[h0p3]] as my name has done me a lot of good. I'm excited to be useful to you, and I'm glad to see you building (and rebuilding) yourself. I'm including you as a [[Public Self-Modeler]] unless you tell me otherwise.

Our gigantic flow of handcrafted Human information is beautiful to me. I appreciate your art quite a bit. You tell stories I love to read, you make them visually stunning too, and I'm lucky to be able to sit at the round table with you.

<<<
One thing I have to tell you about autism...It was a good day. He got to stand up and enjoy the sucker like he wanted. And the rest of us had a lot of fun reminding him that he had autism that day. He was, honestly, the least autistic person I think I’ve ever met..
<<<

Let me stop right there, sucker. Look, I know you might be English, Irish, or Scottish (or whatever: you're all the same to me),<<ref "tea">> so you think you've got a monopoly on the correct paradigms of autism. I grant, of course, y'all helped me understand myself better than I did before.<<ref "app">> I'm too autistic to know what you are `> implying` for sure, but I also know my Own Voice, sir; after all, it's mine: I own it. You may attempt to deny the authenticity of my membership to this neurotribe, and you will be sorely mistaken. Indeed, I am the man you deny you are talking to. I'm afraid you think I'm playing a game when I'm not in this case. 

This is no fiction. I'm not play-acting as an autist; I'm solidly on the spectrum, and there are surprising gaps, missing marbles, and loose-screws to boot. I have a pervasive development ~~disorder~~ difference of this kind, and I've had it since birth.<<ref "ada">> I cannot fully describe it to you, and I suggest few are qualified to define it better than I do.

⦗I assume you have a reason for questioning it that doesn't boil down to baselessly questioning it; I believe you are far too smart to make an obvious mistake (and you may be once again generously deceiving me with the flick of a wrist). Your life's stories have a meaning and purpose. Teach me, Obi-Wan. I think highly of the way you test me. I will try to be a good student. What else could it mean to care about the integrity of both me and my wiki? An existential security audit from a wise (and hence skilled) person is exactly what I'm looking for in a damned good friend. [[T42T]] test my metal and pluck the logs out of my eyes; Be Thou My Vision. There will always come a point where I must faithfully trust you to be fair! You are implementing a humanoid form of [[Outopos]]/([[The Original Position]]) right now. Test and tweak me, anonymous node; turn me into one who passes the Ring of Gyges test. Oh, Hosanna in the Highest, glorious leader, virtuous agent, teacher, shepherd, [[Audit]]or, a non anon anon hypertext lifegamer, senior computer-mind expert, and empathic person qualified to shape the [[Other]]. Oh, [[kicks]], darling, won't you be my penetration tester? Who do you say I am (and was)? Who do you say I should be? Take me to task, brother. It might hurt, but I am grateful that you take the time to {[[help]]} me. Humans must engage in this process with each other, all the way down at some points. We need mass-scale methods to generate empirical reasons to trust in the (Categorical Imperative)/Reason of [[The Other]]. We ARE the real Rawlsian basic structure of society.⦘

⦗We will never escape having an outgroup; that is a conceptually necessary part of the dialectic among the [[fff]]. Treat your outgroup as you'd like your ingroup to be treated. Even if you are powerless: build relationships built on [[T42T]], infect and cultivate homo sapiens sapiens with ([[The Golden Rule]])-memeplex, be living proof of the Gospel of Moral Virtue as best you can. I don't know how much [[hope]] I have, but I aim to make it the only [[h0p3]] worth having. Hell yes you better make sure I'm practicing what I'm preaching. You bet your ass I want some Neo-Jesus.messiah-version-3.1.4 to be in charge, and we need them to be a lot better than me (duh doy). Yall muhfuckers need dat QTPie (we all do!). How shall our messiah ever emerge from assholes like us? Pro-Tip: in reflective equilibrium, continously redecentralize that shit. Also, if your AI-augmented government had a wiki, what would you want it to look like? What corpus would you train it from? This is what I'm selling: we're headed in the wrong direction in the desert. Oh noes, they're digging in the wrong place! THE HOLY GRAIL OF ZION IS THAT WAY DIPSHITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMFG, DON'T DRIVE US OFF THE FUCKING CLIFF!!!!!!!!⦘

⦗But wait, there's more! Let me also proclaim loudly: those in power should undergo the loss of privacy to this progressively scaling [[dok]] (and further). What are the moral merits of privacy and attempts to control intellectual objects? Even in a perfectly competitive game (where you egoistically wished to be the winner who took all), the vast majority of dark-triadic players in the game (and absolutely everyone behind the Veil of Ignorance) should want "moralfags" to be their leaders (except the elite who have something to lose via decentralization of power). I know someone who said something similar once (yeesh, dem wiseguys); yes, it has the maximin, [[T42T]], Robustness Principle in it. Information advantages must favor those at the bottom.⦘

⦗Paranoically search us both, brother (I know I do). What is wrong with or how can we irpvome my circuitry, my armor, my weapons, my methodology, and my intent? Look inside my mind as best you can; prepare me and my memeplex to slay the demonic dragon inside our species (I'm almost guaranteed to fail, but I must try anyways). How will I ever teach myself and [[others]] to listen to each other? My work, which just is my representations of myselves at some level, must be the morally best version of me I can be. I do not think you doubt my goal, but I am forever grateful that you doubt me, including exercising your Hohfeldian claim rights. We must continuously evolve to become morally dignified; it's the only right thing to do. What do you think decentralized trust really, really has to look like in our species across time? What do you want [[Humanity]]'s [[4DID]] to look like? The centralization of power is very hard to answer. We fight from the bottom-up with the [[T42T]] principle or [[The End of Humanity]] comes. Again, doctor, I am grateful that you perform check-ups, prescriptions, and surgeries. I seek to at least work toward something much greater than my wiki could ever be.⦘

I think you are wrong, but what's new? It is, of course, completely possible that what you've said has whooshed over my autistic head (yet again). I am surprised by this story, and I'm worried I have not understood it. For all I know, you continue to drive home the point of your story with the story. I will listen carefully to you as you explain your parable to me; I appreciate every ounce of context you provide. As you have seen, I'm not so good at understanding many kinds of narratives.<<ref "ser">> I would like to understand who you think Ethan really is and what's really happening in your classroom.<<ref "tch">>

There are many asymmetries in our relationship, [[kicks]]. One of them is that you are simply a wildly better interpreter than I am (and yes, I'm including how little you say out loud in my weighing).<<ref "wei">> Clearly, I regularly fail to digest even obvious things you spoonfeed me. I'm trying to say this as someone who knows he doesn't even recognize that he doesn't know (what he doesn't know) in many crucial cases. When I tell you I'm bad at reading, you have to believe me! I have the test scores and a lifetime of experience to prove it. I will stupidly debate the finer points of my stupidity with you too. Working with what I have is all I can do.

In my absurdly arrogant or arrogant-appearing opinion, from a strictly adversarial approach, I consider myself at least a journeyman 1v1 PvP artist in particular kinds of games (some duels would need to be absurdly long ones, wiki-sized even),<<ref "anal">> but my abilities in the broader mixed martial philosophical arts (including your talents) are terrible. I suggest I've seen enough gifted language users to know I'm not one of them (yeah, I'm better than average, but the variance in me is tremendous). This is not fair to you at all, and it is my duty to learn how to play your language game as best I can (and I'm probably failing again!). However ironic it may be, I'm convinced you are saying elegant things I just don't understand. It's not like I'm not trying to understand; I'm often just that bad at it. Autism, imho, is part of the explanation.

I'm not sure how best to address this asymmetry. Some of it is not up to me. In any case, I want to understand you even half as well as you understand me. My opinion is that you obviously know what you are doing with me even if I don't understand it.

Love,

[[h0p3]]
