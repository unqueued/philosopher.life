2 times in a row I've only had a single item drop off Baal.../player 1 though...it's going to happen.

Got to 67...dropped to 1 HP off a amp curse + midget stab.

Alright, made it to 70, got a rockstopper for the merc. Put on the bec-de-corbin unique because he doesn't even need leech right now with a heal pot once in a while.
