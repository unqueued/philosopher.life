* [[2018.12.27 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Draper's Asskisser]]
** I've never had a [[hlexical]] term come out of another project (that I remember). This is the perfect tool for it though.
* [[2018.12.27 - Prompted Introspection: Inventing for Convenience]]

* [[2018.12.27 - Computer Musings: Upgrades]]
** Seems to be working now.
* [[2018.12.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Migraine]]
** Completed.
