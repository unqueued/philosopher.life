title: 2019.02.09 - Self-Dialectic: TickTock

I believe that sleep offers our CPUs a ticktock - a day and a night really is a full clock cycle in the life of //homo sapiens//. Indeed, constantly having bad dreams appears to have some correlation with either your mental health or the state of the world. Dreams aren't predictions. But they might be nontrivial subconscious or alternate-conscious dialectical signals or reliable indicators of waking life. 

We think of sleep as a kind of cooldown on our CPU. It is the kinetic downbeat - rather, the potential energy that we've built over the course of the day as a downbeat. We've done the work against gravity to lift our leg, and now it costs very little to push it down. It is like a combustion engine, a piston. It is the day-to-day grind of our daily self-dialectics. 

You go crazy w/out sleep - you cannot be rational w/out sleep - you cannot live w/out sleep. It's fascinating that scientists still can't tell you why we sleep - not really, not all the way down; the best answer we can give is that we need to. What evolutionary computational purpose does it serve? What are the Turing machines that arise during dreams? What kinds of Turing machines are predicated upon the dual nature of wake and sleep? 

From what I understand, sleep is a profoundly guttural activity. It has more to do with our automation than anything else we can point to, sometimes. I don't know what dreams functionally tell us about our functional identities. It can't be woo, but clearly, it can be nothing. The nature of simulation and the automation necessary for simulation gives rise to the SO telic question of [[The End]] of FO computational instruments. 

I'm looking for dialectics in binary computation, which is difficult with the [[SO]] [[infinigress]].
