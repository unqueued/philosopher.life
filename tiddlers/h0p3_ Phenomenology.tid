* You might say I'm 5-pounds of quantitative shit shoveled into a 4-pound qualitative bag. 
* I'm not extremely fluid; my hedged-conservative exploration of reality is open but slower than fuck. That snake creature is gonna take a while to compute.
* In my opinion, on average, I get along with women radically better than men. I have no idea what that means.
* Nobody gave me a book on how to socialize effectively enough.
