!! What does Canada mean to you?

wat

Uh, lol, I don't know why you are asking me this question. I'm grateful that you do, Samwise. I'll figure it out someday, I reckon. 

I've been fortunate enough to visit Canada a couple times. I've had several polite Canadian neighbors. I've met a few Canadian pirates over the years, and several gamers.<<ref "v">> Sure, I've met some Canadian assholes, but they tend to be saner people than the average I've met. Otherwise, there's barely any differences; they could pass for ~~normal~~ ~~American~~ United-Statesian any day. I adore their various accents. I'm not a huge fan of prolonged and extremely cold weather, but I appreciate that many people enjoy it (and I think there may be even evolutionary and sexual-social advantages to societies which have adapted to such climates). Politically, Canada appears to have caught many of the memetic diseases my nation incubates and spews (sorry!).
