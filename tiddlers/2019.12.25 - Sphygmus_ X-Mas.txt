[7:45 PM] h0p3: Merry Christmas :slight_smile:
[7:46 PM] robotic_scarab: the same to you! I hope you've had a good celebration in the middle of your move :)
[7:46 PM] h0p3: Ha, yeah, we've had a good one. Fast-paced today.
[7:55 PM] h0p3: You having a pleasant one yourself?
[7:57 PM] robotic_scarab: yeah! very laid back, doing lots of fiction reading :)
[7:57 PM] robotic_scarab: and playing with my grandad's dog, which is fun!
[7:57 PM] h0p3: on the rotation for ya, I assume some solid knitting too
[7:58 PM] robotic_scarab: yes! trying to get a pair of socks finished for my mom XD
[7:58 PM] h0p3: It's nice to have an animal to keep ya company. Our cats are freaking out over here. I don't know if they know we are moving or not.
[7:58 PM] robotic_scarab: that's going to be a huge transition for them, I expect
[7:59 PM] h0p3: no doubt, uprooted once again
[7:59 PM] robotic_scarab: I don't really remember it but when I was a kid we moved with our cat and had to try and give her kitty tranquilizers to calm her down :S
[7:59 PM] robotic_scarab: she was always a very anxious kitty though
[7:59 PM] robotic_scarab: maybe having each other for company will help your cats?
[8:00 PM] h0p3: We were thinking of a tranquilizer, but we'll try without first. Ranga has generally been a fine traveler, but Meow does not like it at all. No idea if company will matter; they tend not to spend much time together.
[8:02 PM] robotic_scarab: will you be keeping them in the vehicle(s) with you?
