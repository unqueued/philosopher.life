title: 2019.04.08 - Afterschool Teaching: Homework

Whitney showed up early, per her usual Monday schedule. She's feeling bad again. I think it's the amount of stress. I tried joking and making her feel better. She's scheduled to go home early at 5:30, and I hope she wrecks that test.

The celery is going bad. I have a hard time sanely handling our fresh product. I wish we had an order every week instead, but that is work that Delp is unlikely to do.

5NP2 told me he's feeling suicidal. I talked to him and went through the standard channels. He's not actually, imho, but he is feeling serious pressures around him. I can see that.

A teacher explained that 7Jm is lying to us again. Lots of students lie constantly. The amount of dishonesty is hard to fathom. It is like two opposites in me. Part of me is like "duh," and the other just can't believe it.

I'm handpicking students to go with Whitney. I'm going to start breaking up clans. 5NP was decent today, and 5TG a pile. I'm having to teach basic math to half the students. I'm forcing them to do the math themselves too. I'm disturbed by what I'm seeing here.

The girls who aren't cliquish tend to be those who try the hardest. I shower them with praise. We talk about the nature of effort and the purpose of it. I hope those girls make it out of this hellhole: they deserve it.

I did yell twice today.  

8Gf and I talked about the nature of rules in the lab. 

Mitchell was Delp, and he continues to preach the same perspective as I do on the general psychology of the kids. Go for it. 

5Tm's mom told me the story of his adoption. I can see that.

5HS is last to be picked up. She told me her weekend didn't go according to plan. Her mom sounds like a hardworker in a tough place, her dad a deadbeat. =/ Well, I am an ear.
