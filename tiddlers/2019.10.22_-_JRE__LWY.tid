Bro called me back picking up Chinese food. Matthew is eating solids (90th percentile for weight, starting earlier), and that's messing with his sleep schedule. Matthew is learning to stand and practice walking the initial aspects of walking; my brother is good at reasoning about the baby's mind, and I love the way he delights in the [[beauty]]. Rebecca's grandma died. =(. 

The co-worker to lookout for apparently can do sick impressions of various mental states.

I find myself giving people fairly blah responses about my life at this point. I don't find it blah, but I find it hard to explain what is interesting about it to others without going way overboard.

My brother is feeling //Living With Yourself// heavily, and he's considering seeing a therapist. I think it would be valuable for him to continue digesting, making explicit, and reasoning alongside others the difficulties of life. My brother is too hard on himself about his sexuality and sexual behaviors. He lovingly joked that my standards, ''certainly'', aren't too difficult to attain (LOL).
