title: 2019.06.13 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Justified Intervention

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
[Q: when do you think is it right to intervene in the affairs of another nation?] I think there are conditions under which that would be possible. One basic condition is that nonviolent – you mean violent intervention? – that nonviolent means have been exhausted. That's one condition. A second condition is that the people of the country in which you're intervening support the intervention. Under those conditions – and you can think of others – intervention would be justified. However, we don't ever apply those conditions.

Initially, it seems obvious what counts as non-violence, but any decent Hegelian is going to own up to memetic violence. Dialectics are often violent even if they aren't what we standardly conceive of as physical violence. Coercion comes in many [[dok]] and justifications. If I can kill what is evil in someone with words, I will; [[Virtue is Knowledge]]. Further, there are cases where there's no time or feasible possibility for anything besides direct physical violence, and so I would mean something particular by "exhausted" in this case.

The second condition is also fairly complicated. Imagine a nation of people so gaslit through propaganda that they've experienced stockholm syndrome, or have been beaten into full submission or apathy such that they wouldn't voice such support to various [[dok]]. Is that their "true self"? What does it mean to have informed consent? It does not appear you can consent to just anything either. I suggest one must idealize people for their sake, to reason on their behalf given what we also know which they might not (perhaps with some recursion), etc. 

It's important to see there are conditions under which intervention isn't simply permissible but perfectly obligated.

Of course, this is not why our nations go to war. Every military philosopher I've met can give me a basic rundown of Just War Theory, but they can't justify any of our armed conflicts nor recognize where our force belongs. Obviously, I don't think our giant military-industrial-complex should exist.
