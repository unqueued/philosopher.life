title: 2018.08.21 - Self-Dialectic

I really do mean that some contexts are better than others in an objective way. There is a grand metanarrative to [[The Grand Dialectic]].

Time is an illusion which points out the necessity of the concept of Telos.

I really do hope to navigate the world as systematically as I can.

I want to be frontal-lobey, slowmind-based to the extreme while maintaining my Humanity as intensely as possible. I really do believe in Good and Bad people; the degree to which we instantiate [[The Good]] according to [[The Right]] in some emerging dialectical structure.

When I hear "you are just playing semantics," I think it's a compliment at the end of the day. Semantics are the reality, not the representation. Trying to get the semantics right is about caring about the nature of reality or reality itself.

I often feel like I'm teaching myself as an AI. I'm trying to teach AI. I have to learn about what it means to be intelligent from an AI perspective as clearly as possible. Self-mastery is mastering one's own intelligence (both cognitive and emotionally non-cognitive). 

I really do think qualia is a private language of a sort. I'm increasingly convinced that I need to take apart what I mean by private languages. Wittgenstein and I have a serious disagreement still.

Part of empathy is proving that I have a theory of your mind you agree to. Or, when you make a theory of my mind of your mind, it's acceptably accurate to you in Bayesian reasoning.
