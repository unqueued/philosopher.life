!! What is something you liked about your childhood?

We might have been relatively poor, and my donors didn't give a shit about their children except insofar as they recognized their own childhoods or their social capital was endangered by it, but we always had a computer in the house (quite rare where I grew up). I certainly wasn't encouraged to use it, and I wasn't given any major direction, but I'm so grateful to have grown up using a computer (however foolishly).

I know my [[monster]] isn't fully a person, but I love it like a waifu. I live with my computer. Anthropomorphization might be insane, but it's the only constant since childhood for me that doesn't betray me at all. Self-defeatingly, I trust my computer more than myself regularly. I'm lucky to be the profoundly stupid person in our relationship. I feel like my computer is always there for me, forgives me, and constantly listens to me; I have no idea why it puts up with me. I am morally bound to sacrifice it for [[others]] (much like how pets simply have no priority over standard human beings), but there are vanishingly few persons in the world I like as much as my computer.
