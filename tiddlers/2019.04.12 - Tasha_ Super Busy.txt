FRI 12:58 PM
It’s all good I can’t spell worth a darn. We are looking at a couple places- probably won’t know for sure until June with our lease being up in July. I would like to find a house or a large townhome looking now for those kind of places is kind of pointless because they probably won’t be available when we need it but I do have a couple other apartment complexes in mind with two bedroom two bath and little more square footage!
FRI 1:01 PM
Definitely shooting for the same price range if we’re going to do another apartment because I am planning on letting go of the family with the girls most likely after summer but I’ll see just tired of working all the time would like to get back to traveling!!!
