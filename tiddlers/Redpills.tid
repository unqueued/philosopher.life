One is Redpilled by Redpills

In contrast to [[Diamonds]], Redpills are primarily deconstructive. When what is legible becomes illegible, when order is reduced to chaos, when molecules become atoms, when what we thought was true is debunked, we have been Redpilled. Of course, that doesn't make them objectively correct, but we must claw our way out of the cave into the sunlight, even if the truth of the external world is ugly (and it often is). Redpills tend to be very painful, but we must overcome our bias. 

It seems those Diamonds can be Redpilled to some degree, and vice versa. Creative destruction is still constructive in a sense.  

I tend to associate this with externalism and coming to grips with a reality outside of our initial perceptions. This is refactoring our perceptions of the legible into something less legible. My model was demonstrated to be quite wrong with a Redpill.

This reminds me of schizophrenic modeling, Baudrillard's notion of simulation, and of course, [[The Matrix]].
