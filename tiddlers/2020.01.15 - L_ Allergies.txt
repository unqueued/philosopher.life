[12:24 PM] h0p3: How's your day going?
[12:26 PM] Sohalia: It started off chill, then got stressful for a period, and now I am going my best to take it back to chill.
[12:27 PM] h0p3: I hear that.
[12:27 PM] Sohalia: Had a manager accuse me (indirectly) of not doing something in front of every other manager in our department AND our director.
[12:27 PM] h0p3: Ugh.
[12:29 PM] Sohalia: So I emailed everyone back immediately with photo evidence that I had already done that thing. It was one of those “I thought for sure I remember doing this but am doubting everything now” moments. I was so anxious.
[12:30 PM] Sohalia: The dumbest part is, this leader could have scrolled ahead in her calendar to find the things she was looking for but didn’t. So she didn’t talk to me first or even look before she tried to drag me through the mud. What the fuck.
[12:31 PM] Sohalia: Putting this little stress toy to good use these days:
[12:31 PM] Sohalia:

[12:32 PM] Sohalia: Her name is “LaShawnda” after the two bosses that stress me out the most.
[12:32 PM] h0p3: Lol ;P
[12:32 PM] Sohalia: ＿|￣|○
[12:34 PM] Sohalia: BUT, in an effort to not spiral into a pit of anxiety and despair, I am doing my best to just move on (cause complaining about it totally helps right??)

So, how are you?
[12:35 PM] h0p3: I bet complaining about it is important. You need people to listen to you.
[12:35 PM] h0p3: Moving on sounds like a good idea (though, I do not suggest forgetting).
[12:35 PM] h0p3: I'm still sick as a dog.
[12:35 PM] Sohalia: Oh I won’t, don’t worry.
[12:36 PM] Sohalia: Oh man... that sucks. Does it seem more like allergies?
[12:36 PM] h0p3: You got me. No idea.
[12:37 PM] h0p3: I've never had allergies like this that I know of, but that doesn't it isn't allergies. Hives are rarer for flu, but I tend to a much weaker immune system when I'm stressed.
[12:37 PM] h0p3: (not that I'm terribly stressed right now)
[12:44 PM] Sohalia: Well sure, but moving can be stressful in its own way.
[12:45 PM] Sohalia: Yeesh... yeah, hives to me sounds straight up like allergies. Sounds like they did not do the best of jobs cleaning up this place for you all.
[12:50 PM] h0p3: May mean we have to move again. =/
[1:05 PM] Sohalia: Yeah... which sucks, but it is what it is.
[1:05 PM] Sohalia: I just hope you all find a good place
[1:08 PM] h0p3: Need to get to a doctor to determine, but no insurance.
[1:37 PM] Sohalia: Ugh.... I feel this. It is honestly the worst.
[2:14 PM] Sohalia: I hate that insurance decides everything when it comes to receiving healthcare.
[2:15 PM] h0p3: Aye. =/.
