title: 2019.01.23 - Prompted Introspection: Goodly Pet

!! What is your ideal pet?

I was such a pansy when I answered this last time: [[2018.01.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Ideal Pet]].

Alright, the ideal of ideal pets is this genie who alters the nature of contingent reality itself so as to maximize the highest form of happiness [[irwartfrr]] to the extent that only it could define [[gfwiwcgws]]. It would be the totalitizing grand narrator.

How does one make this the "best of all possible worlds?" I do not know. This is so ideal, I am not convinced it is even possible for it to be an agent (or it is so transcendent I dare not compare my agency to its).

I would be its pet, not the other way around. Its only a pet until it incubates into being my steward. Who doesn't want an omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent agent to construct and reconstruct the world? I do not know how to get off the "everything is necessarily maximally [[Good]]" Spinozistic train, and Hegel's Spirit seems normatively void. Well, Leibniz, what is this "inclined without necessitating?" Fuck me if I know.

It seems clear I would not exist (probably none of us) in such a universe. I'm not God or [[The Good]] though, so I can't tell ya'. That is the best inference I have available to me.
