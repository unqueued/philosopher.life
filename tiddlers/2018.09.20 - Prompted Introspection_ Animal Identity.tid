title: 2018.09.20 - Prompted Introspection: Animal Identity

!! What animal do you identify with most closely?

Dipshit, Samwise, I am an animal. I identify most closely with myself, and species-wise, le homo sapiens. 

Okay fine, you asshole. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Here's me identifying with you about identifying with non-human animals (and I can guaranfuckintee it ain't hobbits<<ref "d">>)...I'll give you the answer to the question you (malicious fool) meant to ask, 'cause "I want to care about you" and shit.

My cat, Ranga (RAY-nga to me...apparently, I'm uncouth), is feeling bad (though, not awful). I can tell something is not right. I can't tell you what's wrong with him, but I know something is off. He's laying in my daughter's seat, like all day. That's not like him. He even let my wife consistently pet him (danger, will robinson). He's been in the house more than average, and he's usually rearing to go outside. Why is my cat sick? I've pet him and tried to find out. Maybe he's having an allergic reaction to something? He's not complaining to me. I'm telling you, Samwise, my cat is feeling off. What am I going to do? He's not eating as much as I predict. I think it is a tummy ache. He hasn't puked, but I think he wanted to. Maybe some neighbors gave him food he's not supposed to have. That poor bastard. He hasn't whined to go outside a single time in 20 hours. Something is off. I'm trying to make sure Ranga is feeling comfortable. He laid on the floor, and I did my little spacing thing with him. We'll see. I will watch closely.

My cat, Chairman Meow, is normal today. She has some psychological/nervous disorder. You can see it in how her head and eyes shake.<<ref "a">> She is a jumpy cat, but extremely loving. I don't know if she knows it is me petting her, but I imagine her sense of smell is like a kind of vision for her. Today she did something stupid funny. She saw a bird literally a foot away, and I know she understands the glass door, but she pounced straight into it. She forgot it was there. It shocked her. You should have seen her reaction. Within a few seconds, she was back to bobbing her head, doing her wiggle-dance, thinking about the bird. I'm glad it wasn't like a serious pounce. Normally, when she goes outside, she brings me leaves as her "catch." I think the time the dog scared her has permanently altered her chemistry. She is one of the more affectionate cats I've encountered. When I finally go to bed, she is usually in my spot. It's one of my games to try to find a way to position myself to help her keep her spot in the cuddle puddle. I generally fail, and I think I annoy her. I really like when she stays with me. She loves to eat my food (I tease her feet when she does), and I think she knows she is one of us.

<<footnotes "a" "Reminds me of one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen in my life. Amber Morrison. Her brother and I were classmates (back when I used to skateboard decades ago). Her eyes were more sexy than Alexandra Daddario's by a full letter grade. She could also make her eyes shimmie like a fake seizure? I don't know how to explain it. I've heard her life turned out very poorly. Fuck.">>
