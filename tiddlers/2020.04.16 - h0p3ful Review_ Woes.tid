** I need to know if we need to replace the laptop.

** Btw, [[JRE]] got to see your room today. Gave him a tour of the home.

** This may be a place where you develop some GM expertise. I hope you keep exploring these roads. It's well said.

** Crazy dream. I have no idea how you remember that much. It's interesting that you still try to give us some kind of phenomenology to something you've never experienced with a dream. That is basically what the question is asking for. Good job.
*[[2020/04/15 -- Life Log: Updates Failed]]
** Updates failed, but you didn't. I appreciate that you aimed to do some testing and that you were ready to revert. Next time, it shouldn't hit production until you are more confident than you were.
*** You are going to have to generate a list of things to test (interesting problem here).
** I'm enjoying Dominion with you. I like that we all get to play together, and I like that there's time in between our own turns to eat or do whatever (even when we move at a fast clip with interactions throughout the rounds).
** Solid work in this log. I hope you continue this style (and it might help to continue to flesh out the day as best you can remember at night or the next day).
*[[2020/04/15 -- Wiki Log: All My Friends are Childish]]
** I have the same hope for you. 
** You never got your dual boot working correctly. I'm not going to wait 3 minutes for you to boot something up. I demand a full time linux machine running close to 24/7/365.
*** You can do passthrough if you want. You have the hardware for it.
** I think most people aren't hard on themselves [[irwartfrr]].
** Yeah, I predict the same kind of quasi-Libertarianism.
** I'm sorry they don't read it. That's a shame.
** I appreciate your thoroughness in responding. It's not fun or easy in many cases.

** Might still want to link. It's part of the story. Might not be worth the time in the end.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Fascinating to see NixOS from two years ago showing up in your logs. That was on my brain today. Must be clockwork or something.
