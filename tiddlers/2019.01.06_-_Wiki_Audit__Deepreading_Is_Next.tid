title: 2019.01.06 - Wiki Audit: Deepreading Is Next

I have to say: I'm annoyed by tiddlers that only have one line in them. I feel like I have failed in either my duty to speak or in gauging the fitting atomization scope when it occurs. If that is what it takes to have started the [[Wiki Audit]] project, I'm glad I did it.

Completed [[The Remodeling]] up to 2018.01.11. I am up to a place I dread. I understand there was value in demonstrating the ability to transclude, and I needed to show the kids that they could, in fact, prove how much work they accomplished in a given day in various ways. This experiment was a failure though. I don't have to undo the damage, but I want to. Ugh. I will break my [[Log Audit]]s to do this (though, I can retroactively change those as well). There is a web of work I have to do if I'm going to change it.
