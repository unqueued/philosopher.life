title: Practically Perfect Everydayness

//Why didn't I think of this before?//

* Wake up at 9.
* My wife is easy to wake because she has slept well. Her head doesn't hurt. She has no worries. She's not stressed. I can see it in her face. I know her demeanor, her ticks, her character, the threads in her disposition. I want to see her happy; and, I really know what that looks like.

* We talk until I realize I can't stop thinking about fucking her. Then we fuck.
* We lay there talking until she tells me that she feels gross and needs coffee. I make a joke that she finishes, and we go wash up.

* Shower of the Gods!
** I also mark my territory.

* We get dressed and go see how the kids are doing.
** They are talking while building digital art together.

* We make a quick breakfast:
** Coffee.
** Country ham, biscuits, eggs, bacon, and mango.
** We sit around a room eating and talking as a family.
** We all clean up.

* We do our work
** Some of us are at home, some of us go out. 
** We're talking to each other all day.

* We meet up at right before dinnertime.
** We all cook. It's something we've made many times together.
*** In fact, we've kind of perfected it together, made it our own.
** We eat together and talk. 
** We can't stop talking 
** We clean and jump into:

* We read, think, write, talk, watch, listen, and tell stories together.

* It's late. 
** We get ready for bed, give hugs, head to bed.
** If we're in the mood, we bang. Otherwise, we sleep.
*** All the cats gather, of course.
