title: 2019.10.06 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Dining

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I'm not going to sit at your table and watch you eat, with nothing on my plate, and call myself a diner. Sitting at the table doesn't make you a diner, unless you eat some of what's on that plate.
<<<

The question is: how much do you need to eat before you ought call yourself a diner? Moreover, if it is not simply an amount, then by what process or method for distributing food or generating the dinner can it be justified? The analogy is too weak, but it's a fine start. Obviously, you can't capture everything here, and I don't know how to strengthen it while keeping it so brief. 

Slaves (and everyone else reasoning about slaves) need to own up to the horrible fact that they don't politically own themselves (even if they morally do). People who aren't functioning citizens must say it. If there's an implicit double standard between the rich and poor, then you need to say there's not a meaningful rule of law. Opportunity and political [[power]] inequalities are easy to point out, even my alt-right buddies can do that. Pointing to the historical structure and memetic causes is also necessary, but it's only description. Prescription is nasty hard, but that's what the dining problem is about.
