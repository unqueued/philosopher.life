title: 2019.01.08 - Prompted Introspection: Acting My Life

!! Who would you choose to portray you in a movie about your life?

I have attempted to answer something like this question here: [[2018.05.05 - Prompted Introspection Log: Actor Biography]].

I don't want a movie about my life. I don't think it's remarkable enough to merit a movie. That medium needs something in particular. I would much rather be able to choose someone else to author my wiki. I would say Saint Socrates, but apparently, he didn't write.

Hrm. Who would I want to portray me in a wiki? Um. I would like the honor please. I feel like portraying myself to myself isn't just my job but even part of my autonomy. I want that representation to be up to me. I don't mean this in some narcissistic sense. I think it's my responsibility, and sometimes it's even my joyous privilege.
