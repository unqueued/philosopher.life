title: 2019.10.04 - TDL: Go Forth

* Wiki catchup 
** DUDE!
* Walk and fuck
* Chores
* Probably WoW. You didn't even do all your dailies.
** Bro wanted to do MC again, and I'd rather just be with him. Zero gear for either of us, of course. 
*** Though the ring we thought reasonable enough dropped in dark iron daily for me minutes later.
** They had me offtank for the raid when necessary, though our tank was Naxx capable. Otherwise, I topped DPS charts and pissed off our guildmaster by taking aggro even after FD. The problem is that I frontload too much; my opening 15 seconds are way, way too much damage. DoTs make more sense!
* Should you drop le coffeebliss?
** Been a long time, son!
* Stir fry sounds bitchin.
** Rice sounds good. Let's do something with rice.
* ~~Apple Festival~~
** Lol.
* Keep dumping links. Write some letters. Go forth, sir.
