title: Redpilled Stoicism
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

//See: [[Stoicism-fu]]//

---

Stoics practice artful living, and they take their existential work very seriously. Stoicism is about living philosophy (regrettably, they tended to focus too heavily on practice and not enough on theory). But, we must agree they give us a uniquely pragmatic window into what it means to exercise practical rationality in existential decision procedures. Don't get me wrong, many Stoic writings and people who considered themselves stoics are wrong and sometimes retarded; their inability to see egoism as a fundamental force in the lives all humans, including themselves, forced them to integrate far too much woo into their framework. Fear not, there is a kernel of truth you must pluck out of the sand. Shine that Redpilled Diamond.

<<<
Stoicism is not about suppressing or hiding emotion—rather, it is about acknowledging our emotions, reflecting on what causes them, and redirecting them for our own good.

--Pigliucci
<<<

However, I am stereotypically (however wrong it may be) hermitic in my stoicism. I think it is eminently practical for my particular context. But, I can agree to this maxim without contradicting myself, so pay attention.

<<<
A man cannot live well if he knows not how to die well.

-Seneca, “On Tranquility of Mind,” 11
<<<

Stoicism is the philosophical core of Viktor Frankl’s logotherapy, Albert Ellis’s rational emotive behavior therapy, and Kazimierz Dąbrowski's Theory of [[Positive Disintegration]]. Stoicism empathically solves existential problems. It passes existential [[marshmellow tests]]. 

<<<
Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate. … Anxiety is freedom’s possibility, and only such anxiety is through faith absolutely educative, because it consumes all finite ends and discovers all their deceptiveness. And no Grand Inquisitor has such dreadful torments in readiness as anxiety has, and no secret agent knows as cunningly as anxiety to attack his suspect in his weakest moment or to make alluring the trap in which he will be caught, and no discerning judge understands how to interrogate and examine the accused as does anxiety, which never lets the accused escape, neither through amusement, nor by noise, nor during work, neither by day nor by night.

- Kierkeguaard
<<<

Anxiety is instrumentally useful to us. It must be experienced in moderation, directed, and be a source of motivation for exercising our freedom. That "get off your ass and doing something"ness of anxiety is provoking, evolutionarily useful, and something we must pay attention to. 

Stoicism harnesses anxiety in the right way. They are virtuosos of being anxious about the right things, at the right times, for the right reasons, and so on. Stoicism is Virtue of the Practice of Feeling Anxiety.

An example anxiety-reducer, anxiety-waiver, anxiety-controller, anxiety-redirector, anxiety-dispeller that stoics are so very talented at:

<<<
For we ought to have these two principles in readiness: that except the will nothing is good nor bad; and that we ought not to lead events, but to follow them. "My brother ought not to have behaved thus to me." No; but he will see to that: and, however he may behave, I will conduct myself toward him as I ought. For this is my own business: that belongs to another; no man can prevent this, the other thing can be hindered.

-Epictetus
<<<

Stop worrying about what someone else ought to do, but make sure you worry about they will do insofar as it affects you, especially insofar as you have control of it. Admit what you can't control, and act accordingly. Worry about what is in your control: what you will think and do given your context.

Stoicism is sometimes incredibly redpilled because it's fairly practical about who we are. Sometimes it accepts brutal honesty and deals with it (especially when it suits them). It can be beautifully constructive with terrible truths. However, it is extremely annoying trying to do metaethics with stoicists; they are terrible at it and they don't care. 

The most highly integrated stoics are those with an IQ low enough to be unable to solve philosophical problems (to be present-at-hand about existentialism and even philosophy in general), but with an IQ high enough to realize their inability, and to not worry about what they don't have control over (a classic problem for most Virtue Theorists in my experience, and a cause of their convenient desire to see the moral law as uncodifiable). 

Also, it is obvious they take up they are often conveniently egoistic, even when they virtue signal otherwise (Stoics are just a subset of practically egoistic Virtue Theorists). It's why there is so much bullshit in that memetic ecosystem; you must tease out what is philosophical and what is merely convenient about their "living of the philosophy of living well."

A stoic will be tempted to think: Virtue is the only true good and departures from arete the only evils. Somehow, external events are not features of our character, and so can be neither good nor bad. But, they don't have the balls to ask Virtue of what, Good of what, and continue inspecting it. Welcome to their woo.

They also form a shitty religion in their claim that virtue is fully sufficient for flourishing in this life. What a load of shit. Any halfway decent virtue theorist knows that moral luck is required, and that standard "moral virtue" is only hoped to be a necessary ingredient. Unless we start asking "virtue of what?", and MacIntryre's virtue of the practice is highly relevant, where we can talk about virtues not in our control. But, virtue of the practice of life, while it forms a disposition, are hardly identical to any set of practices of moral virtues you might in mind. With that broad and definitional a notion of virtue, only those kinds of virtue could be sufficient for eudaimonia. 

Of course, there is also 'flourishing' in context. That is, the floors, walls, and ceilings (perhaps even the kinds, degrees, and parts) of potential happiness available to one is based upon the particulars of one's circumstances. But, then "good of what?" is the real question. Good not of a human, good not of a human living in your region and time period, but only good of absolute particularist you, your complete contingent context bundled and processed. 

Regardless, the stoic must just go back to truisms they can count on. This is what they have left: virtuous living for your context maximizes your odds of flourishing in your context. Well, no fucking shit, retard. You're theory, as with most virtue theorists, is terrifyingly awful consequentialism as a theory, even if we admire some of their practices.

Stoicism reminds me very strongly of Daoism.

Back to look at kernels:

The definition of stoic freedom:

<<<
Some things are up to us, a consequence only of our character; everything else is not up to us, and independent of our character. Things which we appear only to influence can and should be separated into factors that are entirely up to us, and entirely independent of us.

The impossible is never compulsory; the unavoidable, never forbidden.
<<<

Ought implies can. Water is wet. I like boobs. 

More importantly, character, disposition, is just algorithmically defined habit. It is the programming of ourselves that makes us who we really are. Combatibilists rejoice.

<<<
Passions are emotions caused or reinforced by a belief that something not up to us is either good or bad; they are symptoms of mistaken beliefs about good and bad.

It is not things that disturb us, but our judgments about those things.
<<<

This is very poorly expressed. Judgments are the result of inferences based upon beliefs, presumably and often about things internal and external to us. And, passion, of course, is connotatively about strong emotions; thus they mean inappropriately strong emotions are inapproriate because we are worried about the normative status of those things which are not up to us.

You fail so dramatically here, stoics. You have purposely closed your imaginations to be blind to what you actually influence in this world. The notion of //The Stack// is something you purposely don't think about because you know that it's not convenient to your exercise of egoism. 

<<<
As social beings (such as humans) mature, their natural impulses expand from helping themselves alone to their families, cities, nations, the community of all rational beings, and the universe itself.

The natural impulse of a rational being (such as a human) is to believe what is true, and avoid believing what is false.
<<<

I think stoics do a really terrible job of justifying these ideas. This is not redpillled nearly enough. It is a hope of who we are. It is where I see them fail theoretically and practically. They do not study memetics and genetics nearly strongly enough, although the Stoic framework is fully capable of evolving to work in this fashion (it's definitional open-endedness is refreshing intellectual integrity). 

---

Stoic practices:

<<<
Refrain from giving automatic assent to mistaken impressions and acting on impulses. Instead, observe them as mere impressions and impulses. When an impression or impulse that something is good or bad is received (before assent is given), consider whether it is under your control or not. If it is both under your control and virtuous, then assent, and otherwise do not.
<<<

This is practically a truism. Insofar as you can, think about what you are feeling, desiring, or believing from an objectively detached point of view, before you act or think upon it. Be virtuous when the matter is under your control. 

No shit, sherlock.

What I love about stoicism, however, is its pragmatic focus on accepting the degrees and kinds of our powerlessness. It is the BDSM of existentialism. 

<<<
Regularly read and re-read brief reminders of central Stoic principles. Regularly reword for yourself these reminds to trigger active engagement and prevent them from becoming "just words." 
<<<

Apply your theoretical principles to your practice! 

No shit, sherlock.

And, yet, this most basic philosophical notion is one we all fail at all the time. Yes, common sense often isn't that common for each of us. This wiki, I hope, will be a beacon of this implementing this notion.

<<<
Mental rehearsal (visualization) of upcoming events, particularly those that might trigger mistaken judgments about good and bad. For example, say to yourself: "I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my fellow human or hate him, without my decision to choose that opinion. The harm is done in my response to their actions, not in their actions."
<<<

I love the sentiment, but this is very poorly stated. Mentally rehearsing can be a valuable way of habituating virtue. That to some large extent, I am not responsible for the beliefs and actions of others, I agree. However, I obviously can be harmed by their ignorance. More importantly, you have made the huge fucking mistake of agreeing to the Socratic axiom [[Virtue is Knowledge]] but fail to apply it; you aren't allowed to simply help yourself to Hanlon's Razor...you know better. You know that ignorance is malice; that vice is not virtue. This contradiction I cannot abide by. The situation is so much more complex than you imply.

Now, if the point is that it is so complex it isn't worth thinking about, you need to justify it. That is only half living by [[Virtue is Knowledge]]. You have no escape, but I think you trick yourself into trying to not be philosophical.

<<<
Mental review of recent events in the light of Stoic principals, possibly followed by mental rehearsal of doing them as if you had followed those principals. The point here is not to feel guilty about the recent events: they are now out of your control, and so it is now a mistake to even look at them as good or bad. The goal rather is to train yourself not to make the same mistake in the future.
<<<

I find this very odd. This cannot be correct. Don't you see?

Yes, I agree that reviewing events is crucial to improving ourselves. Yes, I agree that we should only worry about and learn from the past insofar as it helps us in the present and future. Yes, I agree that we must let go of our guilt at times. But, wouldn't you say that feeling remorse is, at times, absolutely necessary to changing who we are? To some extent, in many cases, you need to feel guilty, to experience the pain, in order to really learn the lesson. 

Touching a hot stove should teach you something. Fretting too much about it, now that would be a mistake. Calling yourself stupid and hating yourself, now that would be a mistake. Feeling too guilty about touching the stove doesn't seem useful, I agree. Remembering the pain momentarily and using that to guide your actions towards virtue seems completely reasonable. I think there are different kinds of guilt, and different notions of the causes of events and pains for which we might feel guilty. Choosing the right things to feel pain about and be motivated by is important.

Crucially, I want to say burning my hand on the stove IS BAD FOR ME. Do you mean right and wrong, instead? Ah, well, I need to admit when I was ignorant, when I was lacking virtue, when I was vicious. I need not beat myself up about it, but I must admit it. You are correct that we are trying not to make the same mistake in the future, but you have to own it as a mistake. 

I think you really want to talk about the phenomenological issue here without being theoretical. It's frankly disappointing. It is what I see in eastern and continental philosophy. That work is extremely important, but it is not sufficient.

That said, in charity, I must admit that stoicism is about practicing "letting go" when it is rational to do so. That is not easy, and again, it is uncommon common sense. I applaud the practice, even if their justification is uncouth. As usual, the virtue theorist cannot explain their non-cognitive content, they can only point to it. 

<<<
Negative visualization - Imagine something that you fear will happen has actually happened (a loved one dies for instance). This will help you be grateful for what you have and also take some of the sting out of bad things because you have prepared yourself for bad things to happen. 

Actual practice experiencing some of the consequences of difficult events, and reacting to them as a Sage would, where doing such is not dangerous or destructive. The idea is to start in a situation that is as easy as possible (it is expected, you know you can stop it, etc.) and get practice so you can handle it if and when you have no choice. One variety of this is self-denial, in which you consciously decide not to enjoy something for a time. Go camping, shower using cold water, don't use the dishwasher, etc. This will help you be grateful for what you have but also keep you from attaching your happiness to having things that are ultimately not entirely in your control.
<<<

Another form of virtue training. This has a "prepare for the worst" mentality that is eminently practical for those who want to be happy in any reasonably possible situation they might find themselves in.

---

Stoicism seems best when its used for lateral thinking, for reframing. It also seems nebulous and capable of giving any response you want depending on how you define for yourself what is in your control (which is not as obvious as many might assume).

If Stoicism is really about "Following Nature" insofar as it enables us to flourish as individual specimens, then we are directly being told to act upon our egoism, to embrace it, to make do with it. If you can train yourself to be happy without empathizing with others, then you should. It's a powerful stance. When you can't do that, then you need to worry about //oikeiosis//, about your community, about finding a way to be a good citizen, etc. 

Stoicism attempts to make us feel that nothing outside of ourselves is free, that it must do as it does. It teaches us to see ourselves as the only free thing, and only partially at that. This is powerfully differentiationist. It says, "you are the only exception" to the rule of determinism, in a sense. It fails to recognize the autonomy of others. Only you are a true person, the others are mere billiard balls hitting billiard balls. Essentially, see everything as The Other, evil, and outside your control. You're just trying not to get hit and leverage them as hard as you can.

I want to point out that Stoicism is about producing an egoistic strain of [[The Good]] and not about [[The Right]]. It is only "right" insofar as it the necessary means to achieving Eudaimonia. Stoics are egoistic non-cognitivist ethical anti-realists. It's incredibly potent at eliminating feelings of responsibility (to the point that you can lie to yourself).

Furthermore, this is a mind-over-matter mentality. The man with the lowest expectations is easiest to please. The goal isn't necessarily to see reality for what it is (although, sometimes Stoics excel at that task where others fail), but to see reality in such a way that makes you happy. The normative epistemic and phenomenological push is about shaping what you see (real or otherwise), limiting it to what is in your control, and arguably has a hint of Heidegger's ontological (I use this word in the analytic sense) anti-realism at times.

In my Straussian interpretation of the Ancient Stoics, I believe they saw what they wanted to see, but not reality. They were masters of convincing themselves that things aren't in their control. Even a cursory glance through their notions of autonomy and ontology will show you that it isn't coherent; I've seen children make better inferences about the nature of agency and the world. In any case, if you're fine with anti-realism, Stoicism works well.

---

"Nothing that happens to you can hurt us unless you choose to be hurt."

Stoics tend to be extremely uncareful with their words in a sense. This is obviously false. You can control your feelings, to only some extent, about something. You will be hurt. They don't even try to say this cleanly.

<<<
Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.

--Marcus Aurelius
<<<

Blind leading the blind. This kind of poor reasoning is why stoicism is only a complement to one's philosophical arsenal. When you stop doing theory, you aren't intellectually honest. I'm regularly unhappy with Aurelius in this regard; it begins to look more like a convenient tool to rationalize any maxim that will make you happy given the standards you've framed for yourself. It's self-serving in the wrong kind of way, and it's what I dislike about non-moral realist egoism cultivated in some strains of virtue theory. It fails to balance theory and practice in the fitting way, and it distorts your perception of reality.

It's crucially ambiguous, and it allows you to choose two contradictory meanings and conflate them. One interpretation is "waste no more time" insofar as "arguing about what a good man should be" is a waste of time in the vacuous sense. The conversational implicature in such a case would be that there are cases where you ought to. If that's what he meant, then surely he would have said that. He is clearly most easily understood in the other direction, the anti-intellectual interpretation. Guess what, that is in line with the rest of his work. Ever the practical; that is pragmatist's dogwhistling doubletalk before you. I know it when I see it.

This is a tool for giving yourself The Slip, a free pass.
