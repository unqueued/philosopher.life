title: 2019.10.26 - Prompted Introspection: Colorblindness

!! If you had to describe yourself as a color, which would you choose?

Lol: [[2017.06.18 - Prompted Introspection Log]]. Yeah, I think the question is awful. I have difficulty distinguishing between some kinds of teal and gray, particularly when the lighting conditions are poor. So, today I'm going with that green-grayish color I experience because there is not only an uncertainty but a lack of confidence in my perceptions I'm comfortable and curious about. Colorblindness is a simple [[redpill]] and reminder for me.
