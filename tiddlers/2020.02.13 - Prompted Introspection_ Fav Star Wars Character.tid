title: 2020.02.13 - Prompted Introspection: Fav Star Wars Character

!! Which is your favourite Star Wars character (or other movie/book/t.v. show, etc.)? Why?

I want to see Leia and Padme fuck. It's simple. Rule 34 is amazing on it. The characters themselves are hollow to me, but they are hawt.

* [[TV: Library]]
* [[Books: Curated Library]]
* [[Music: Library]]
* [[Film: Library]]
* [[Games]]

...hrmm.

I don't have a favorite library for [[Links]] (beyond itself as sprawling bucket). I don't know how to remedy that well enough. My goal tends to be a canon for speaking with others in some generalized fashion (there's give and take here). Obviously, we all have to search for our particulars, but we also have to contribute to picking out the references which everyone experiences and uses (it also means I shouldn't get too fancy). What sites do I think everyone should have some exposure to?<<ref "t">> It is, of course, harder to do this with the lack of persistence of content online. I usually answer this question by thinking about my offspring. It's a radical filter, almost hubris even.
