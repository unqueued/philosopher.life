title: k0sh3k's Wiki Log

My wife doesn't really love writing in her wiki. It's new, difficult, and she doesn't want to do it. I'm slowly coaxing her to do this with us. I think this will be invaluable to her later on. She has to be a good role model for the kids in this way because we desperately need the kids to excel at this. She's getting there. I see her write about an hour everyday in it now, which is wildly better than before. I'm really grateful to her for all her effort.
