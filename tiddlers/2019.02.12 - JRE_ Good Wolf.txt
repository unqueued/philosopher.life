A second attempt, and back to the original gameplan of two different cover letters.
MON 12:34 PM

You said in tdl, "keep bidding, the wolf is close".  Wolf in the woods is a scary safeword to read, but i don't know what you mean by keep bidding.  Scale of 1 to 10, how much hope do you have and what does keep bidding mean.  Gotta get ready for a three hour foster care meeting, so might not be able to respond atm
TUE 3:49 PM
Ah, sorry! That is a miscommunication. I'm bidding on black-wolf, my son's gaming machine.
TUE 3:51 PM
Oh lol
TUE 3:52 PM
I think I'm doing okay.
TUE 3:52 PM
Rofl
TUE 3:52 PM
Whew
TUE 3:52 PM

TUE 3:52 PM
I greatly appreciate you reading and thinking about it with me though. Lol
TUE 3:52 PM
It sounds like you are going to have fun tonight.
TUE 3:53 PM
4 foster care meetings in the next two weeks, 3 hours each, and just found out the "teacher" is this very conservative Christian woman..

 Ugh
TUE 3:54 PM
Sounds like propagandistic hell
TUE 3:54 PM
It sucks.  She was the one that was super shitty about finding a vibrator in a 17 year old foster daughters bag
TUE 3:55 PM
What does Rebecca think about it? She trudging along as well?
TUE 3:56 PM
Everyone agreed it was so good she searched the girls bag and got rid of it.
TUE 3:56 PM
Oh, she is dreading being in this lady's class as much as I am
TUE 3:56 PM
How much more of this do you need to do this year?
TUE 3:58 PM
Need to find ways to live in a simulation to pass the time.
TUE 3:59 PM
I think I would be too morbidly curious to know the stupidity and evil around me.
TUE 4:00 PM
How goes it?
