title: 2019.02.24 - Prompted Introspection: War

!! Have you, or your family, ever been effected by war? Describe how.

What is war? It is obvious to me that the US has been at war with parts of the world for my entire life. The military-industrial-complex is an arm of capitalism. Even our paramilitarized police forces and privately empowered (contracting out the unconstitutional parts) surveillance on and memetic oppression of our own people is a domestic war. In the material dialectic, what is not war? It is only the exercise of [[The Golden Rule]], the [[T42T]] strategy which seeks to play a non-perfectly competitive game that can ever be anything other than war. War is so integrated into our LSC interactions that I have a hard time knowing what society would even look like without it. It is a {[[dream]]}.
