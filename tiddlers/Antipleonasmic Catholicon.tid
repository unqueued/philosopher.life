!! About:

//Whatever it paradoxically means to say it: [[SO]] Saliently select for [[FO]] and [[SO]] salient [[Redpills]] and [[Diamonds]] with both autistic precision and schizophrenic concision. Here be [radical linguistic triage] dragons! I hope for this metative sign to be an iconic iconographic logos lens for this wiki in general. I anoint, mark, separate, categorize, and stamp thee! Saliently seek [[The Salience]].//

Welcome to [[h0p3]]'s Laseric Apophthegmata! May this library of efficient words of wisdom and play merit your charity.

A [[Eudaimonic Lifehacker]] is a virtuous agent of the practice of life. They must be an elite Metamodern pattern-maker and code-breaker, hacking the relationship between ontology and epistemology. They aren't merely experienced; they are experienced [[irwartfrr]]. With their recursively virtuously-trained virtuous perceptions of reality and its related practices, they are [grandmasters in the exacting art of choosing and using the right tools for the job, cybernetic equipment metagaming minmaxers, wisdom-memeplex connoisseurs, quant-analyst key-wordies, and polymathic problem-solvers par excellence].

Here I seek originally unoriginal wisdom sufficiently clarified and wise to the point it has reified and crystallized a unifying conceptual relationship between [[The Right]], [[The Good]], and [[The Beautiful]]. I aim to train, reframe, refactor, and wisely wield my perception in this practice.

As you know, I curate, collect, and digest a variety of [[Diamonds]] and [[Redpills]] on this wiki. Some of them are complex intellectual objects which only emerge from discrete arrangements of conceptual objects.<<ref "1">> Elegance, however, is beauty emerging from simplicity. Therefore, because some particularly beautiful Diamonds and Redpills are [economically pithy solutions to particular problems, astute generalization flashlights, or lateral-thinking catalysts and enforcers]: I'm engaged in [[gopdar-mining]].

Ultimately, effective systematic philosophy must present an efficient face of the mountain to our finite and inductive fastminds. I hope to decrypt and lossy compress the most relevant complex systems of [thought, megatrends, memeplex evolutions, and rabbitholes] into their core [summaries, microhistories, historiographies, meta-analyses, and templatic skeletons]. I hope to reveal their fundamental identities. Here I provide myself the opportunity to [collect, explore, and wrestle with] the application and coherence of [common sense, cuteness, acuteness, wit, profundity, and the cleverness stored in brevity].<<ref "2">>

I take effective [truisms, propheticisms, aphorisms, epigrams, maxims, adages, proverbs, kōans, razors, rules-of-thumb, précis, walkthroughs, FAQs, one-liners, phrasemes, neologisms, ironies, paradoxes, paradigmizers, reifiers, hermeneutics, recipes, playbooks, cheatsheets, tips, shortcuts, and hacks] to be [compact intuitions, experience capsules, grand memeplexe entrances, kernels of truth, epistemic climbing holds, coping tools, heat-seeking missiles, litmus tests, multi-threaded memory safety mechanics, uniquely penetrating logics, paths of least resistance, and prodigiously salient heuristics] we must recursively and habitually [inspect, germinate, unpack, thoughtfully contextualize, and wisely apply].<<ref "3">>

This directory is a specialized memetic toolbox containing [high-precision measuring devices, lenses, filters, veil-piercers, layer-peelers, dot-connectors, exemplary improvisational tools, bootstrappers, isolation chambers, condensers, multi-tools, corner-case-solvers, reusable code snippets, look-up tables, jigs, shims, gizmos, widgets, and gadgets] designed for //cleverly// solving construction+deconstruction problems of all kinds.<<ref "4">> 

This directory is a kind of idiomatic existential toolporn database paradoxically (and often simultaneously) aimed in scale at both generically general and singularly particularistic<<ref "7">> problem types and cases of [[adok]]. Even the notion of this directory (and hopefully this wiki) is skeuomorphically an example of itself; it's fundamentally rooted in the //practical wisdom// of industriously finding and using the beautifully elegant solution qua being virtuously lazy [[irwartfrr]].<<ref "8">>

This directory is a curated collection of [lexing tokenizers and parsers, gnostic silver-bullet meme ammo-boxes, and lense clarifiers] which form [an antidote/poison thought cribnotebook, an ideally-practical and practically-ideal testing gauntlet, a maximum signal-to-noise ratio lifehacker lexicon, and a concentrated applied epistemic normativity compendium]. 

This should be the first place you should look when you begin solving a hard problem, and it should also be the last place you look before you might give up. When it works, it was extremely low-hanging fruit that either acted as the perfectly-fitting missing puzzle piece or enabled you to shrewdly MacGyver it together in the nick of time. Essentially, these distinctive survival tools are meant to have an absurdly efficient cost-benefit ratio.<<ref "5">> The contents of this directory obviously only solve a fraction of our problems, but too often, whether you realize it or not, these are the exact hacks you are looking for.<<ref "6">>
