title: 2017.07.28 - Dream Log

My family and The Farley's, except Aaron, were in a tent outside College Heights UMC. I was a teenager again, and my brothers were their respective ages. My parents were trying to convince Flint and Kathy that there was something insidiously wrong with Aaron. Snakes tongues. I stepped in and defended Aaron against the lies and manipulative statements. I told it like it was, but it didn't work. So, I added rhetoric. I fought fire with fire, and I wasn't happy about it. Rational argumentation as not enough by itself. It was a verbal battle. The Farley's embraced me and went to find Aaron. My parents lost face, and the car ride home was very difficult. It then became kind of nightmare about them judging me.

I woke up with my usual headache. My chest was tight. Clearly, I was anxious in my own dreams!<<ref "1">> My right hand was numb and cold. I didn't have an erection (thank God, amiright?).
