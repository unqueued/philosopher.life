title: 2020.02.11 - Wiki Audit: Yearly Logs

* Eventually, I may want to [[Audit]] not by [[X-Section]], but by tags. 
** Guru Bimlas popped in to say "hi." `/wave`. I need to practice with his new version. His mind is different.
** Tagging hierarchies are this secondary thing, even though most people use them as the primary organization tool. Perhaps that will change. Slowly it creeps into this wiki. It's hard to see clearly enough. I kind of hope that eventually it will be so thoroughly tagged that I can "flip a switch" and transition seemlessly, at least in some sections. The hard work is still in the hierarchy, not the gunk.
* The most expensive aspect of the [[Audit]], at the moment, is in the digestion necessary for [[Retroactive Footnotes]]. 
** My wife is loving them too. I'm doing something right here. 
*** It's also kinda weird. I don't have a lot of examples to point to here of people doing this part. As usual, I have no idea what I'm doing. Huzzah.
* Lol, I'm completely unable to keep up. That's okay. I'll do what I can.
** And, I need to get my Yearly [[Audit]]s done too. Time to switch gears here.
* [[2019 - Antipleonasm Analysis]] completed.
