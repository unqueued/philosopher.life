!! Audit:

* This is the first month that I've not been pouring myself into the Pipefitting Log, and that's because this is the first month that I've not been doing pipefitting except for my reading. That was planned to happen, although it came 20 days earlier than expected.
* I now know that I will always need to carry drug-test kits with me. It's the price I pay. My medicine is worth it.
** I realize many people who are irrationally against drug usage find this behavior to be a problem. We sit at an impasse. Your lack of empathy is not my fault. I am not convinced you have what it takes to walk in my shoes either. So, I must dismiss your opinion. I'm sorry. I'm willing to make a rational argument with you over letter-writing (but I'm a dedicated control player; I know when I've already won; I am the shark the takes you to deep waters and drowns you).
* I can see how valuable it was to be able to type my log. It transforms the experience and my day. I need to guarantee that opportunity, and I must hide it from those in authority. Writing is never a good thing in their eyes; it means I'm thinking.
* I have prepared myself to leave at a moment's notice. My tools are packed. The vehicle is ready. My clothes are ready. In an hour, I could be out the door.
** For the first time, I will have an actual full set of pipefitter tools to bring. 
* We will see how our taxes, mathematics, wiki audit, and expenditures go. I don't know when I will have a new job.
** I can't guarantee I can work with Yates again, from the sounds of the HR bitch. But, there is another above her who hired me originally. I'm hoping it is her thought that counts.
* I didn't apply to Eastman.
* I have been reading my NCCER books.
** It's been wonderful to see how much I've grown since I first read them and completed the exams.
* I am still working on mathematics with the kids. I would like to complete Trigonometry and then move into the pipefitter math.
