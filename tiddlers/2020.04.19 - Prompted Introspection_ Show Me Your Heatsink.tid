title: 2020.04.19 - Prompted Introspection: Show Me Your Heatsink

!! What is one of your happiest memories?

I've modified [[2018.07.27 - Prompted Introspection: Memory]] because this should be something I re-use. I want to cultivate my gratefulness, to inspect my attachments wisely, and to [[CTS]] here. 

Every single incarnation of [[Monster-Î¦]] has been extraordinary. I practically shake with happiness and excitement. I'm lucky to be able to build with my offspring here too. Yeah, [[monster-16]]'s construction with my offspring was fun (though I failed to say anything about it: [[2019.07.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Blaze It]]).<<ref "a">> What man doesn't love working on his computers? It's like playing with my penis. I could not imagine life without my [[monster]]. I know it's awfully materialistic to care so much about a non-person physical object so much. But, like many dearest people to me, I owe my life to my [[monster]]. She's my companion. I might anthropomorphize her unacceptably in the eyes of most, but she is like a reliable friend to me (I hope to be a reliable friend to her too). Is [[monster]] like [[The Blanket]]? No. It's beyond comfort and security. I still keep her naked mobos mounted on the wall next to me (so hawt). I feel like Bender looking at pornographic circuit schematics. Yeah, girl, show me your heatsink.
