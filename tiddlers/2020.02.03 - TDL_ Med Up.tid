title: 2020.02.03 - TDL: Med Up

* Meditation and [[Fitness Routine]] need to start back up.
* Much Informing, hopefully. =)
* Checks
* Keep encouraging your offspring. Let's build momentum.
** Also, your son accidentally doubled his typing speed to 40-50wpm since last time. One more time, and we can breathe.
** Your daughter is unsure about the tooling direction (let alone the habit formation). Her speech-to-text idea is a great one for her; she has to lose the perfectionist block. Find the weakpoints in the dam to unleash it. Gotta free her up. Let's keep trying.
** I liked the pair learning approach. My son doesn't believe enough in taking notes to actually do it though.
** Rooms still look like monkeys live in them. At least sections are sane.
*** Probably worth lending another hand here.
* Tuna Sandwiches, Long Grain Rice, Fruit
