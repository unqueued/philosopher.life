I'll always vote for the most leftist thing on the ballot, but I'm not really out here doing any serious praxis. I just can't right now.

I get that you are limited in what you can do. I think of you as being in a survival mode, biding your time waiting for all the paperwork to eventually go through, still setting up a life with your hubby. You have quite a bit on your plate, no doubt.

I would argue that you do have non-trivial praxis though. For example, I think you visit the digital shut-ins and the weirdos^^tm^^. That's leftist praxis. You have a good ear for many people in the world who are dismissed, persecuted, and profoundly atypical. You thrive with the weird. I think your Discord servers (and other mediums) demonstrate you really do care about a lot of people who don't seem to have many others who care about them. [[That|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2020.02.29%20-%20karen]] is non-trivially serving people.

* I'm starting to get more previously-s in my prompts. I wonder if this is the point where I'll have to rethink having the prompt there.
<<<

I'd be sad to see them go. I am interested in the kinds of initial objects or prompts which pull us onto our screens well enough. It's a place for experimentation. Maybe you need a wider variety of prompts?

* I could start doing an Antipleonasm Analysis-type thing. I would like to have more and different things to talk about.
** My wrestling depends greatly on my opponent. I don't enjoy trying to get into other people's headspaces/systems as much as h0p3 seems to, since it's so hard for me to do. This is the great flaw with e.g. my DeathOfRobinhood page.

I think [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] gives that unique wrestler-dependent feel when you need it (though I often generalize to have no specific speaker). It does open up what one talks about. It picks out things. I think it's a very expensive log to write (even if it doesn't look it).

I often enjoy trying to understand other people, but not always. Sometimes I do it because I think I should, even if it's not enjoyable. I don't think I'm any better at it than you though. I would argue that we all have groups of people that are easier for us to understand than others. Moreover, you obviously have taken the time to think about many perspectives; it's an expensive thing to do. It seems to me that you also spend a significant portion of your time coming to understand people who would not otherwise be well understood. You give "degenerates" the time of day with consistency.

With the wiki review, I'm wondering if I should split up the tiddlers the same as h0p3 and Sphygmus do. I'm writing more and more in these tiddlers, and I might be starting to really get into it.

I have no idea how to atomize and molecularize structures in the wiki well enough. I like being able to search more effectively (in a couple ways), the directness of auditing, and the ability to see which processes are taking up the most computational resources. This can easily be taken too far, and perhaps mine is too atomized. I just don't know. My assumption is that the fitting arrangement is heavily particularized to each person here.
