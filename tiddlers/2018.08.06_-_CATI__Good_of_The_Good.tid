title: 2018.08.06 - CATI: Good of The Good

My daughter is a continuous source of philosophical inspiration, constantly forcing me in the [[WH5]] mode of curisoity and pedanticisms. 

Alright, so what [[The Good]] of the [[The Good]], the essence of essenceness, the "is-ness" of "is-ness," etc. This recursion problem, the exceeding of limits into itself, the infinite nature of the [[infinigress] is a serious fucking problem. 

Her weird claim I went to correct was that I have two notions of [[The Good]] as exemplified by division of [[The Right]] from [[The Good]]. I continue to say [[The Right]] is a subset of the good, a part of it, constitutive of it, etc.

I think it's silly, and yet it resonates. Obviously, it's wrong, but it's still in a ballpark of the dialectic I still can't answer. I wish I could.
