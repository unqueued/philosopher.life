title: 2020.01.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Delivery

* Woke at 9
** Drowsy, feel like shit still, skin is gently peeling off my nostrils, and my throat is sore, but I am here.
* Talked more with podpeople
* Encouraged offspring
* Lay in bed
* Delivery man came
** Gave me the willies. 
*** His wife is a cop too.
** Said I was crazy for moving away from TN. We shot the shit. Beard and Southern accent buy me space with him.
** Worked well together to get the cubes all set in the mini-driveway (much better than originally planned by the office). 
** Claimed I had the heaviest pods he's moved (tipping his forklift several times). 
*** Indeed, they were thoroughly packed.
* Shower + Fireman Time!
* First pod cleared
** Feeling weak. =/. Glad my offspring kicked it out with me. The biggest pieces are moved.
*** I have no idea how we are going to get a sofa into this place. I need another strong adult to do it (and I need my health). 
* Putting stuff away
* Wife arrived.
** Her laptop is sweet. 
** Filled us in on the deets. 
* Birthday meal: Indian Food
** Korma was the best. Curry was delicious but not as good.
** Offspring are looking grown. I've taken them to a lot of Indian restaurants over the years (maybe 9 over their lifetimes?), and it's an increasing pleasure.
* Nap
** Just fucking exhausted.
* Setup [[m16]]. 
** Typing on her now! I feel so much better.
* We have an automated light at the center of the home. It's driving everyone insane. Took it apart and modified it to be far less sensitive and quicker to turn off. 
** I think the original installer did it backward (as there are conflicting directions).
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 3?
** Ugh. =(
