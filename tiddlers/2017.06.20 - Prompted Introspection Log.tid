!! List 20 things that make you smile.

# Schadenfreude
# My wife's enjoyment of her own puns
## I suppose this just fits that broader set of humorous things I enjoy, like delicious irony, self-reference, farce, and so on and so forth.
## Is this a kind of Schadenfreude of my own pain through my wife's eyes? Empathize with her to the point that I enjoy the pain she inflicts on us with her puns. 
# When sexually attractive females kiss
# Dank memes
# Seeing friends or family that I've not seen in a while
# Getting high!<<ref "1">>
## I might argue smiles are always about such things, about being happy (and our happiness just is a set of chemical reactions).
# Often when I'm dancing
## Although, I don't know if it "makes me" smile, I just do.
# When my kids persist through obstacles; when they try again and choose not to give up.
# When I gross loved ones out with a very nasty fart, my disgusting body, or a disturbing meme.
## Schadenfreude.
# When people are stupid in a way that doesn't negatively affect me
## Although, upon reflection, I generally realize their stupidity inevitably, however indirectly, does affect me. So many chaotic butterflies of causality.
# Power dynamics that enslave me into performing physical acts of rhetoric namely forced facial expressions
# Reliving or reminiscing about a particularly good experience
# Any comedic movies, shows, books, audio, cartoons, etc. I've pointed to on this wiki.
## I'd say these are dank memes, but I would also have to point out that memes are the basis of smiling anyways. I'm going to be absurdly redundant, I'm afraid.
# When social conventions are broken that don't negatively affect me.
## Or don't too much, or that I don't recognize immediately, or for some mood I'm in, etc.
# When I'm listening+talking about something I care about tremendously.
## A.k.a. Getting high, again. 
# Whenever I feel //clever//.
## Which I take to be something a slightly different from being intelligent or wise; or it is being these in a particular way or context.
# Coitus, Post-coitus, Pre-coitus, etc. 
## Sex is a drug.
# Fulfilling existential moments
## Drugs!
# Being a smartass!
## Clever drug-user.
# Did I mention drugs?
## Yes.
