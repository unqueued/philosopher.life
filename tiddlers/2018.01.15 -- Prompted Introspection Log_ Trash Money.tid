title: 2018.01.15 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Trash Money

!! What if trash became more valuable than money?

Oh, that's super profound, Samwise, lol. Presumably, you mean trash and money for the same population. What does it mean to say something is more valuable than money? 

Money is just a vehicle and placeholder. Rocks sitting in water beside an island can be money. Trash can become money. Perhaps trash overnight becomes more sought after than money, but trash would at least be a valuable commodity (which I believe can be used like money in trading). You could be claiming that the currency we use today lost so much value that even most trash was worth more. Maybe what we thought was trash transfigured into a diety or the meaning of life, etc. Surely that is worth more than money. 

You need to tell me how something we took be to be trash became more valuable than what we took to be money. Without that context, I offer very little information about my feelings about it. I'm sure I would be surprised. I don't even know if this would be a black swan event, that's how poorly you've filled in the gaps I need.

The thing I take to be more valuable than money or even worth my money are often different than others. 

This is an odd question.
