title: 2017.11.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Worst Vacation

!! Tell about your worst vacation.

I'm not sure how to define vacation. At least as they are usually defined, I can't think of too many bad ones. It's hard for me to define worst as well. I can easily point out significant examples of physical and psychological abuse over the few vacations I had before I was 18, and that definitely sucks. I'm still really glad we went on the vacations we went on though, warts and all.

Oddly enough, my worst vacation (imho) was awesome in almost every respect. My worst one was a weekend trip to Rayong, Thailand. We stayed at a gorgeous hotel right on the beach. The accommodations were some of the nicest I've ever seen in Thailand. The pool was incredible. My wife had the time of her life. I, however, was sick as a dog the entire time. I was puking my guts out for 3 days. I puke from the bottom of my toes, and it really hurts. I can get over the acid burn-taste, smell, and other unpleasantries. The pain really blows (chunks [can't help myself]) though.

I am really glad I went on that vacation though. I learned a lot about my wife. It is part of a sequence of particular trips I've had with her which help me understand her, empathize with her, understand what she needs and wants, and gives me a goal for her life.
