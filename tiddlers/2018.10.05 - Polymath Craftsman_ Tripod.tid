title: 2018.10.05 - Polymath Craftsman: Tripod

My wife's college was throwing away a nice but broken camera tripod (my wife is basically an amateur photographer as a hobby). One of the collapsing legs had a clasp that was completely dismounted. With my son's help, we were able to gently hammer it back into operation.
