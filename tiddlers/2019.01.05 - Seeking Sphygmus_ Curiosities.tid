title: 2019.01.05 - Seeking Sphygmus: Curiosities

When does [[Sphygmus]] fold her tiddlers? I tried it. I really wanted to like it. It has faded away for me (even before Bob).

We lost our shit over New Year's over that yodel joke. Imho, it is a form of moral schadenfreude! I hope she continues to build that place. 

Love the footnote KantCon joke-comment too (it's like a present!). Ofc, I also take it seriously (because I'm a curious mamajama). The actual (Neo)Kant cons appear to be conservative virtue-signal festivals where we gather around a couple academic superstars but never actually engage in serious dialectic. I think it is a popularity contest, but not philosophy. That said, I'm profoundly indebted to my Kant teachers and indirectly the social/professional networks of Kantians.

Why does Sphygmus feel she is out of place in socializing? My brother describes it something like "everyone else seems to have been born with a textbook of knowledge on how to socialize, and I never got mine." I don't think that quite fits, even though she traces that out in a couple ways. Obviously, I've just said "fuck it," so I'm of no use to her on this front. Reminds me of the INTJ thing again. Her physical descriptions of anxiety are painful. It is my [[hope]] that Sphygmus validates herself to herself (which isn't to say she isn't subject to [[The Moral Law]]), but maybe I have the wrong approach. Reason is all we have at the end of the day.<<ref "hm">>

[[New]] doesn't show as many as [[Recent]].

Relatedly, I don't use [[Recent]] on my own wiki much (but [[New]] a ton). However, I use [[Recent]] on other people's wikis (strongly my preference), and only use [[New]] as a comparison point.

I'm curious about [[Sphygmus]]' take on [[Tagging Theory]] for her own wiki. Obviously, I spent 1.5 years on my wiki before really taking up tags at all. She's got so much more structure and understanding of what she is doing than I did that early on. The reference section works well for spidering around on her wiki.

More links. [[Sphygmus]] maps onto the interwebs for me. I'm grateful for the opportunity to see the salience she picks out here.

---

I'm curious to know if and to what [[dok]] [[Sphygmus]] values originality, authenticity, accreditation, etc. (and why). I believe I've seen traces of reasoning from both [[kickscondor]] and [[Sphygmus]] on this topic.

<<footnotes "hm" "The party tonight was an important testing ground. It is a yearly event that I use as a benchmark for everyone I care about, a repeatable experiment (mildly similar at least). I have been thinking about [[Sphygmus]]' words the entire evening. My family sat upstairs with the other children and a handful of adults while most socialized downstairs. We are truly weird people who don't fit in. Alia of the Knife is right. There are clear opportunity costs, risks, and profound difficulties my children face in this arena (and I am the worst teacher). We had a fucking amazing conversation (4.5 hours), but we will rarely be able to find [[others]] who speak our language. Gnostic, chosen, inept, extrema on the bell curves, whatever. I take the people in my life obsessively seriously; it all adds up. Unfortunately, I do not have as rich of a model of [[Sphygmus]] as she has of me (though I am slowly coming to learn). I may be wrong about why [[Sphygmus]] feels the way she does, and it's important to me that she understands that (try as I might) I am very bad at understanding people sometimes. I will need to spend a great deal time more thinking about this about and with her. Her pain is real, and I must make sure I am not worsening it. [[Sphygmus]] is lonely, and I do not wish to be maladaptive for her or increase her pain in any unjust way.">>
