How's your weekend been?
5 HR AGO
Wonderful! What did you guys do this weekend?
5 HR AGO
You been rocking out on KH nonstop?
5 HR AGO
Had a date with my wife. That was dope. Just getting stuff done. Reading and writing like a madman. Applying to a job full force.
5 HR AGO
I wish. Been too busy for it this weekend. Started up a new D&D campaign with a group of friends and it has demanded a lot of attention. >_<
5 HR AGO
Nice! That’s good to hear. Ever busy eh?
5 HR AGO
Cool. That sounds fun.
5 HR AGO
Will it be excluding the assholes this time around?
5 HR AGO
Funny story.
5 HR AGO
I purposefully didn’t invite them, not to be a jerk, but to not hurt feelings.
5 HR AGO
And they found out about the game.
5 HR AGO
So now they’re running a Waterdeep game too and they invited two of my players to join them! :upside_down_face:
5 HR AGO
The approval-seeking circlejerks must begin.
5 HR AGO
I get to be Joey.
5 HR AGO
You be Chandler.
5 HR AGO
Lmao
5 HR AGO
Like... I don’t want to think that this is being done to be petty
5 HR AGO
But dammit these guys must be pissed and are trying to sabotage my game!
5 HR AGO
It certainly seems that way to me.
5 HR AGO
T42T requires retaliation when the other players fails to cooperate in a sufficient number of iterations. I will be interested to know how it influences the group dynamics.
5 HR AGO
It may be necessary to just lay it on the line in open honesty.
5 HR AGO
It's a teachable moment.
5 HR AGO
Even though you had the Come To Jesus talk before.
5 HR AGO
I talked to my players about it already and I told them them I don’t want them to not play in the other game just because it upsets me, because that feels unfair. But I would like them to not let out of game knowledge affect our experience because then that would become a major issue for me.
5 HR AGO
Also I want to beat them into the ground by making sure that my game is more kick ass than theirs.
5 HR AGO
I can appreciate the sentiment.
5 HR AGO
The last thing I want to do is declare war on the powergamers when I know I can make a more compelling experience just by doing what I do best, writing.
5 HR AGO
I’ll let their game crumble on itself and keep steering my boat. :grin:
5 HR AGO
My own boat**
4 HR AGO
Well, I hope you show 'em all how it's done.
4 HR AGO
I can see why it has been so time consuming for you this weekend.
4 HR AGO
It’s been stressful. I found out like 2 days before our session 0.
4 HR AGO
I love that you call it Session 0.
4 HR AGO
Well I had to macguffin a prequel session because a player had to miss due to a death in the family.
4 HR AGO
Yet another word I love!
4 HR AGO
Plus we have a newbie and I wanted to give her a nice opportunity to learn how to use her kit.
4 HR AGO
Same. Haha. XD
4 HR AGO
It perfectly conveys what I’m trying to say!!
4 HR AGO
Also, I have to ask, is your theory class still the best of the lot this semester?
4 HR AGO
It’s the most mentally stimulating. I feel lost a lot of the time but I like the challenge of learning new ways to approach literature.
4 HR AGO
Native American lit is a huge disappointment.
4 HR AGO
Religion***
4 HR AGO
I'm sorry!
4 HR AGO
That class could go a lot of directions.
4 HR AGO
Not your fault. XD I blame the assholes that talk in the back the whole time.
4 HR AGO
For sure. I really like it, but I feel like my professor understand these theories so well that she’s having difficulty “dumbing it down” for us.
4 HR AGO
The theory class. Sorry.
4 HR AGO
I have been there.
4 HR AGO
She may be making a mistake, I do not know.
4 HR AGO
I can tell you I have been wrong more than once in those shoes.
4 HR AGO
I beg you take my advice with a grain of salt. I am never a humble enough student, teacher, or person in general. There is a possibility she's expecting you to work harder outside of class, especially if this is a seminar, capstone, or nearly graduate level class. You may want to turn that 1 hour outside per 1 hour inside up. It may be worth your time.
4 HR AGO
That class sounds very important to me.
4 HR AGO
It may even be one of the pinnacle achievements in college for you.
4 HR AGO
(I am biased AF :P)
4 HR AGO
I think you’re right [[h0p3]], because I’m not really putting much time into it outside of class. I should find more time to work harder on it because it’s something that could shape my writing forever.
4 HR AGO
You’re absolutely right though. XD
4 HR AGO
Most of my classes are heavy reading and I’m having trouble giving each of them the right time that they need.
4 HR AGO
Preach.
4 HR AGO
Four classes of all heavy readying is just wholly unbalanced.
4 HR AGO
That is my life.
4 HR AGO
Reading***
4 HR AGO
Haha
4 HR AGO
I'm fucking drowning over here.
4 HR AGO
Good times.
4 HR AGO
ReAd FaStEr
4 HR AGO
;)
4 HR AGO
No I totally feel it though. I can tell for some of these classes that Sparknotes is more than enough to get by, like for my American lit class
4 HR AGO
I have been sponemocking a lot.
4 HR AGO
Have a script I use to convert for me (I'm so lazy).
4 HR AGO
But there’s also my Native American region class where I get a lot out of the reading but I don’t feel like it’s worth my time because she just does powerpoints that summarize it anyway.
4 HR AGO
Greek mythology is the same way outside of the Iliad and The Odyssey which I need to find more time for since that’s the midterm and final respectively.

It is my opinion that you will be glad you did the reading anyways. I believe the dialectics in classrooms, even for the heavily prepared, allow you to crystallize the [[diamonds]] and [[redpills]]. It's a chance to deconstruct it as your teacher summarizes, to offer criticism, or a chance to construct it with your teacher (and the rest of the class) to build on it, to have more to contribute to the conversation. Your classroom is a chance to tell epistemic stories with each other, and you should be a powerful storyteller (of all kinds of stories).
4 HR AGO
I hope so. Life seems to be calming down a lot more too so we should have extra time to allow for deeper readings like you’re suggesting. :)
4 HR AGO
I'm glad it's calming down. I know last year was really hard on you in some ways. You've been kicking ass despite buffer overflows on your computational plate.
4 HR AGO
For sure. I’m trying really hard to use my time wisely for everyones’ sake, not just my own. :)
4 HR AGO
Even with scheduling conflicts calming down, I still feel busy but I feel more complete too because I know a lot of people are happy that I’m making time for them.
4 HR AGO
Yourself included. :grin:
4 HR AGO
Yup. I appreciate that too. I have definitely noticed. It's awesome. I've known I'm your brother for years now, but I finally feel like your brother. It is my honor. =)
4 HR AGO
:heart: Likewise! I want to put my relationships with others at the forefront of everything I do, because physical things break and pass on, but the relationships with others can last a lifetime/ forever. I want to be remembered as the guy that deeply cared for other people and I also want to leave a positive impact on them in return.
4 HR AGO
Feel like I’m rambling. Sorry. :joy:
3 HR AGO
No!
3 HR AGO
I appreciate that you act from duty, out of respect for the moral, treating others not simply as mere means but as ends, constructing your stories of yourself with the others. It's empathy and the golden rule (taking their reasons, beliefs, and stories into the weighing of who you choose to become, what you intend and what you do).
3 HR AGO
I’m also a guy who deeply cares for family and I consider family more of the bonds that you share and not necessarily blood. I consider even my close friends as family.
3 HR AGO
Yeah part of that motivation might be selfish, as I ultimately want others to perceive myself in a good light, but I genuinely find my own happiness in the happiness of others.
3 HR AGO
Ah, yeah. I hear ya. Approval-seeking is not necessary going to provide us moral action. Being perceived in a good light can be simulated and generated by evil means and evil people. Acting from duty, doing the right the in the right way, for the right reasons, and at the right time ([[irwartfrr]]), i.e. [[The Good]]will, is the issue (not even happiness by itself will sufficient here).
3 HR AGO
Even finding happiness in the happiness of others has to be done in the right way. I once had a boss who was a psychopath (openly with me), and he made the people he cared about quite happy in his life. He wife, daughter, and friends adored him. He was just very skilled at choosing who was worth making happy in such a way that he could be an effective egoist (he was quite skilled at lying to himself).
3 HR AGO
Justice requires having a more generalized scope than simply finding happiness in the happiness of others. We have to select [[others]] wisely.
3 HR AGO
Oof
3 HR AGO
This is one of my contentions with the Neo-Aristotelians who promote non-cognitivist justifications to egoism.
3 HR AGO
It produces a flourishing individual who doesn't practice [[The Golden Rule]] universally, but only selectively.
3 HR AGO
Imho, you aren't that.
3 HR AGO
It's obvious you care about others quite generally.
3 HR AGO
That means a lot to me. Even with the powergamer assholes, I kept my game a secret because I didn’t wanna hurt anyone’s feelings. >_< Maybe I should have just been upfront and honest instead of secretive.
3 HR AGO
Shit, am I the real asshole here?
3 HR AGO
Fuck. Lol
3 HR AGO
I do not think you are the asshole! I think you are trying to build community. I am in position to tell you how to do it correctly in your context.
3 HR AGO
It is possible you make some mistakes (we all do) even when you are doing your best.
3 HR AGO
Let me also say you are an open man in the dialectic. Most people don't have the ballsack and integrity to talk about this sort of thing, imho. You see the inferences I'm making very well, and I appreciate that.
3 HR AGO
You are an existential beast. Your storytelling and story-consumption skills serve you well.
3 HR AGO
I am not* in a position. I want Discord edits in Signal!
3 HR AGO
That would be great, but it is what it is. XD Signal isn’t terrible!
3 HR AGO
I appreciate your words [[h0p3]]. I always feel like our talks are stimulating and I’m always pensive as well about our discussions.
3 HR AGO
Usually when I take time to respond, it’s because I’m trying to give good clear answers with thought behind them.
3 HR AGO
:)
3 HR AGO
Oh, I see that in spades!
3 HR AGO
You are radically wiser than I was at your wage. You make me ashamed, lol.
3 HR AGO
I'm full on blushing over here.
3 HR AGO
S-senpai!
3 HR AGO
:flushed:
3 HR AGO
lol
3 HR AGO
I think I’m an old soul. Lmao.
3 HR AGO
Agreed
3 HR AGO
But thank you. I’m pretty bad at dividing my attention so it’s important to me that I focus on others as fully as I can when I talk to them. ^_^
