title: 2018.08.14 -- Prompted Introspection: Brush With Death

!! What was your closest brush with death.

That I do not know. I am sure there are numerous times in my life that I was very close to dying or getting killed by unexpected events, but I got lucky. Of those that I know, I've contemplated suicide pretty strongly several times. 

Also, I survived a tornado.
