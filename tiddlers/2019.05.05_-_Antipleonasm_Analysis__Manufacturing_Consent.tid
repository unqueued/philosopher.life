title: 2019.05.05 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Manufacturing Consent

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Walter Lippmann … described what he called “the manufacture of consent” as “a revolution” in “the practice of democracy”... And he said this was useful and necessary because “the common interests” - the general concerns of all people - “elude” the public. The public just isn't up to dealing with them. And they have to be the domain of what he called a "specialized class" … [Reinhold Niebuhr]'s view was that rationality belongs to the cool observer. But because of the stupidity of the average man, he follows not reason, but faith. And this naive faith requires necessary illusion, and emotionally potent oversimplifications, which are provided by the myth-maker to keep the ordinary person on course. It's not the case, as the naive might think, that indoctrination is inconsistent with democracy. Rather, as this whole line of thinkers observes, it is the essence of democracy. The point is that in a military state or a feudal state or what we would now call a totalitarian state, it doesn't much matter because you've got a bludgeon over their heads and you can control what they do. But when the state loses the bludgeon, when you can't control people by force, and when the voice of the people can be heard, you have this problem—it may make people so curious and so arrogant that they don't have the humility to submit to a civil rule [Clement Walker, 1661], and therefore you have to control what people think. And the standard way to do this is to resort to what in more honest days used to be called propaganda, manufacture of consent, creation of necessary illusion. Various ways of either marginalizing the public or reducing them to apathy in some fashion.

I hear Nietzsche here. Of course, he has no argument against the Übermensch who succeeds through psychopathy in maintaining his spellcasting powers over the minds of others through rhetoric.

The primary evolution of coercion from physical violence to memetic is here again. Indeed, the will of the people must be subjugated and misdirected, even through Huxleyian pacificism into apathy and believing there is no real meaning at all (Buddhism was also successful in getting the masses to hold anti-realist positions). Yet again, I hear Nietzsche. Unfortunately, [[Saint Chomsky]] can only ever tell us the "how" or the "what," but he never gives us a significant account of the "why." I am grateful, none-the-less, as someone needs to be able to articulate what he's said as cleanly as he has. Clearly, he aims to decentralize power.

I wish [[Saint Chomsky]] were an expert in a broad range of computing too. //The Stack// is hard to even vaguely model, but it's a hyperobject. Yet, it appears necessary to understand coercion in the 21st Century.
