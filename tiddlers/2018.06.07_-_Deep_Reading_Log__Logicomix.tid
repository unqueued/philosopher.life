I am pleased to see how Wittgenstein calls into question everything for Russell. Wittgenstein has been a very problematic figure in my life. I must resist the insanity of that vortex. In a sense, I think I should eventually stop jumping for vortexes and start cultivating. I can't always keep jumping; it's imprudent, and it will drive me insane. 

Or...is it the opposite? If I start farming, will it eventually erode beneath me as I'm sucked into a vortex? I don't know. Lol.

My base is in religion and moral philosophy, and I come to this analytic logical language problematic as an outsider. Perhaps that will save me in the end; I don't know.
