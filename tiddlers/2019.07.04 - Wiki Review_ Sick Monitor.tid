title: 2019.07.04 - Wiki Review: Sick Monitor

* [[.i3/config]]
** I've lost track of how many times this has disappeared. Eventually, we are going to have a massive rsync script for doing this, I believe.
* [[2019.07.03 - Computer Musings: New Monitor]]
** Also, the wiki looks absolutely sick on a real monitor. 
* [[2019.07.03 - Wiki Review: Fiddlefest]]
** It continues to evolve. The tagging structure is going to be transplantable. Many of the UI functions won't.
* [[2019.07.03 - TDL: Wife's Wiki]]
** We did a bang up job on her wiki. It was a nasty false start, but now we have a ball rolling. It's going to be wildly easier for her to finish [[The Remodeling]], and I think she'll have the tooling to keep growing it without it getting as messy as mine.
* [[2019.07.03 - Prompted Introspection: Public Figure]]
** Edited. Short, but the letter does most of the talking.
* [[2019.07.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A Slim Day]]
** Completed. You are doing great on sleep.

** Edited. Arendt was short, but she required wrestling. It's obvious why she is so fitting for this day and age.
* [[Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind]]
** Nifty. It probably won't grow very fast either, but I don't spend much time socializing.
