title: 2017.07.19 - Carpe Diem Log

* I keep waking up before the alarm clock. I doze back. I simply couldn't sleep after 6:20 though, so I got up. I like that I don't have to fight to get awake, but I also don't want to miss out on every drop of sleep that I can get. When I head to bed seems almost irrelevant. I've noticed that being in my own bed at home breaks these rules on the weekends decently enough.
* Pushed My Bricks Out before work.
* I worked my ass off today, and it was emotionally easier. I'm very thankful for that.
** I'm getting a lot of writing and reading work done early in the morning, on break, and somewhat at lunch (although, I watched GoT today instead). 
** I'm learning a ton every day still. I'm pleased with this.
** The handkerchiefs are amazing. Thank you, my love! It has made my life considerably better. I swear a ton all day, and my sweat squirts off my round head onto my glasses. It gets in the way, a lot. These handkerchiefs help me immensely. The small things matter.
* Traffic sucked, but my shower was amazing (yet again).
** I'm still very itchy. That systemic fungal infection may be back. It's showing up in the same places again. Might be stress related. 
* I talked with my wife, and I chatted with my daughter. I hope to get in touch with my son before they head to bed.
* I tried calling my brother, JRE. Will try again.
* I should talk to ALM and see how he's doing.
* I had some authentic Mexican food tonight to celebrate (waiters didn't speak English). 
** Cheap and delicious.
* Surfed, watched some GoT. Going for some Fireman Time and will fall asleep to GoT, I think. I'm so far behind.
