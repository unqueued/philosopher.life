!! Audit:

* This month was focused on leaving.
* I'm glad that I took my time trying to communicate what they meant to me in stages.
* I'm hoping the books and letters will be useful.
* I highly doubt anyone but [[gh057]] will remain in touch with me, but who knows?
* Since I was leaving anyway, instead of turning the blind eye at particular moments, I got to enjoy the bliss of playing vidya games with my students as well. 
* I'm sad that I wasn't able to see MadameM before I left.
** At least I've told her what I think.
* We cried a lot. It's a joyful thing that we would be sad.
