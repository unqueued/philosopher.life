* Check the bank
* Get a frisbee
** Everyone in the family likes it. The offspring need more coordination. Your daughter has been complaining about it too. This might help.
* Bang your wife?
** Maybe wait. She has that interview. Better to find ways to keep her at ease. You can clean and cook instead.
* You still haven't gone swimming. This is absurd. 
* You have so many things to read. I think there needs to be a moratorium on books here.
