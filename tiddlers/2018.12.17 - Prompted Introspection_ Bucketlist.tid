title: 2018.12.17 - Prompted Introspection: Bucketlist

!! Make a list of what you would like to do before you die.

Okay: [[Bucketlist]]

That list is shit. Lacking resources and seeing no solid routes to them, I cannot make solid positive predictions about the future. Most of that shit is outlandishly improbable for me. The future all looks the same or worse to me; that is the perceptual and strategic lens foisted upon me by my circumstances. Of course, the means to my {[[dream]]}like ends exist: but it requires being immoral or unjustifiably enslaved.

My unrealistic bucketlist:

* Decentralize power, end poverty, and have a reason to think humanity is [[Humanity]].
* Be drugged out of my mind in fully automated gay space communism.
* Live inside a computer outside my body.

My realistic bucketlist:

* Get my children strongly into adulthood.
* Write my wiki.
* End my life.

My fair [[hope]] is to be moral and stop the pain.
