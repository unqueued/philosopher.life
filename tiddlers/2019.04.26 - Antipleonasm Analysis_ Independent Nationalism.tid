title: 2019.04.26 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Independent Nationalism

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Independent nationalism is unacceptable to the West, no matter where it is, and it has to be driven back into subordination. In the case of Grenada, you can do it in a weekend; in the case of the Soviet Union it may take 70 years. But these are matters of scale, the logic is essentially the same.

I think I'm obligated to point to a controversial tentpeg in metaethics here.

I agree some individuals and groups, both in memeplex and material, have more of a right to exist than others. No, Hitler does not deserve to exist to the same [[dok]] as MLK Jr. I know Saint Oliver Sensen doesn't want to hear it, but not all humans are equal tout court. I strongly appreciate not wanting to agree to it. This is exactly where we must be extremely careful not to confabulate. I understand it is so crazy easy to commit a Slip here. The risk of authoritarian abuse is tremendous, and in fact, the Rule of Law, as well as the legislation of political rights, must be built from the bottom-up; it is the best option available to us.

I can't say I have a satisfactory answer to this problem. I will admit that all idealized persons, no matter their differences, insofar as they obey [[The Moral Law]] and are constituted by it are equal. There is clearly profound pluralistic room for difference, and there has to be. But, not all differences are acceptable. I cannot solve all voting problems here, but there are parts of ourselves we must sacrifice for everyone else, and there are parts we ought not. 

The nationalism I see is insane and evil though. The US is primarily an instrument of the elite, and they only accept forms of nationalism which are no threat to their power. [[The Right]] to [[power]] can only ever be justified by [[The Right]] itself.
