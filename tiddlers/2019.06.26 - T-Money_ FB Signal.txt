I believe toxic masculinity exist. I believe that many men and boys are held to an unsustainable standard." Boys Don't Cry, don't be a sissy, man up, grow a pair." Many men, young adults, teenagers, and boys are growing up without any substantial support structure. Most often it seems that the easiest and most manliest way to deal with issues is anger and alcohol. This type of self-medication and self-deprecating with masochist tendencies it's a recipe for a downward spiral of disastrous self harm. I speak from knowledge and experience. I would like to stress that I want to be here for each and every one of you. That I'm here to listen, to consult, to lean on as needed. But I must apologize,  sometimes my own toxic masculinity pushes me into the Shadows. I don't discourage introspection and self-reflection. But those two without consultation it's really just you stuck in your own mind. And we all know we're all batshit crazy. Call or text me 606-425-9333

I like that you are saying: "hey, let's talk!"
WED 4:55 PM
Especially to people who otherwise won't.
WED 4:55 PM
I have no idea how to encourage people to wrestle wisely with each other and build support structures with each other.
WED 4:56 PM
There's a lot to say on the topic.
WED 4:56 PM
Over the last week I have discovered how big of a failure my intended support structure is.
WED 4:57 PM
I've reached out to a small handful of old friends and attempts to create new friendships based off of Old stories in old memories
WED 4:57 PM
Guys just don't want to talk. And sadly it's in their best interest to talk it out
WED 4:57 PM
Yup.
WED 4:58 PM
Men are fine with talking when things are good. But clam up indeed space when things are bad.
WED 4:58 PM
Growing up without a father dot-dot-dot I was raised by mostly women. So I was always encouraged to talk. And so I did. It has not always been to my advantage.
WED 4:59 PM
I'm literally watching the decline I'm N I truly care about. Mentally and emotionally then degrade into puddles of their former selves. And there's not a f****** thing I can do about it
WED 5:00 PM
In men*
WED 5:00 PM
All good points.
WED 5:02 PM
Yupp... =)
WED 5:02 PM
Lol
WED 5:03 PM
A couple rapidfire thoughts then:
WED 5:03 PM
Pew pew
WED 5:04 PM
* Isolation and loneliness are epidemics, they aren't the cause of the lives of despair of men in our region. However, talking with oneself and others is going to be necessary to resolving fundamental disagreements, building relationships which matter (understanding our value in terms of how we relate to others), and resolving political crises.
WED 5:05 PM
* Men who lose their wives do not tend to live long, whereas wives who survive husbands tend to live on due to the social support structures they've cultivated.
WED 5:06 PM
All good points
WED 5:07 PM
* Sometimes you just listen, and sometimes you are going to have to wrestle people (hard!). You have to speak on behalf of idealized versions of themselves; you compute empathy with and for them.
WED 5:07 PM
I'm afraid there are a lot of people who just don't want to be saved. I think you may be one of them
WED 5:09 PM
* Dogmatic reciprocal communication stills seems right to me. Even when I hate someone, I will speak with them. I bring my absolute "A" game to what I don't like about people; I want unimpeachable responses (to the point I'm radically transparent about it).
WED 5:09 PM
At times I'm guilty as well. But I try to keep a shovel Sandy to dig myself out
WED 5:09 PM
I am surprised you think I don't want to be saved.
WED 5:10 PM
I suppose it stems from the times you told me that you plan to take your own life
WED 5:10 PM
And that genuinely hurts my heart. But it's not something I can talk to you.
WED 5:11 PM
Talk you out of
WED 5:11 PM
I appreciate that.
WED 5:11 PM
I don't think it's fair to say I'm not trying to be saved. I work quite hard to fight it.
WED 5:12 PM
That wiki is the reason I have lived for 10% of my life.
WED 5:12 PM
If I can find an out besides going Anhero, I will. =)
WED 5:13 PM
Current best case scenario (given my predictions): it is my retirement plan.
WED 5:13 PM
I think the work you are trying to do solves more problems than just suicide though!
WED 5:13 PM
You can't wrestle with someone who just lays down. You can't hard charge it over the telephone hundreds of miles away.
WED 5:13 PM
I honestly feel like a failure and I'm kind of quitting for a little bit right now
WED 5:14 PM
I need my toxic masculinity to kick in so I can ghost out be introspective deal with it within
WED 5:14 PM
That's always worked out well
WED 5:14 PM
Lol
WED 5:14 PM
Lol.
WED 5:15 PM
It's pretty obvious one can wrestle remotely. I wrestle with people have been dead for thousands of years.
WED 5:16 PM
I did write a 5-page unsent letter to my best friend.
WED 5:16 PM
I think solutions require both introspection and building relationships with people like us.
WED 5:17 PM
I don't think I could have fell asleep had I not done that
WED 5:17 PM
That makes good sense to me.
WED 5:18 PM
I was inspired by you
WED 5:18 PM
=)
WED 5:18 PM
May it spread like wildfire.
WED 5:18 PM
Then I would have to kill you.
WED 5:19 PM
lol!
WED 5:19 PM
Hah
WED 5:19 PM
I apologize. I have not asked how are you doing?
WED 5:19 PM
Shit sleep last night, but I got a nap in today. Been working through this paper: http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/20/4/12.html
WED 5:20 PM
Kids and I spent the morning reasoning about how to make the "gradual" player less spiteful, particularly taking into account recent iterations with more weight than older (which I think mimics reasonable trust in the world far more, since people change).
WED 5:21 PM
The correct forgiveness strategy is going to require one to "forget" in a scaling way.
WED 5:22 PM
Been trying out software for running simulations because I've not seen anyone construct this particular strategy before.
WED 5:22 PM
I read part of the abstract. I am driving though so probably best that I wait. LOL
WED 5:23 PM
AFK!
WED 5:24 PM
Wait. I don't get to stand on the ledge to?
WED 5:25 PM
Stand away!
WED 6:04 PM
Oh. I thought you said away from keyboard because you didn't want me texting and driving.
WED 6:04 PM
I assume you have figured out a way to use voice-to-text such that it's almost irrelevant.
WED 6:05 PM
But I'm not texting and driving I'm just speaking and driving
WED 6:07 PM
Right!
WED 6:08 PM
Correct
WED 6:08 PM
I gave my wife instructions for Justin oil change
WED 6:08 PM
The guys at Valvoline found that very funny
WED 6:08 PM
Because all I wanted was just an oil change
WED 6:08 PM
But of course she kept asking for Justin oil change
WED 6:09 PM
Lol
WED 6:09 PM
And surprisingly no did I do not do my own oil changes.
WED 6:11 PM
Those guys working at Valvoline use the money I pay to buy groceries for their family
WED 6:12 PM
It is a waste of my skill set in time to change my own oil.
WED 6:12 PM
Time is money. Competitive advantage. I don't change my own anymore either, though I don't have the tools to make it easier any more.
WED 6:15 PM
It's just not worth my time. I change mine in my old truck. And my lawn mowers and atvs. But not when I get an oil change a month in my car.
WED 6:32 PM
In any event. I say this with sincerity. I love you. I envy you. I admire you. And I am here whenever you need me.
WED 9:15 PM
I love, envy, and admire you too, Trent! =) You are like a brother to me.
WED 9:17 PM
I will know more closer to 20th it seems. And will be more fitting. I have family here on 4th.
WED 9:17 PM
I appreciate your  encouragement. I ran, opened arms, and I think I may have overwhelmed my "best friebd" a word I am unsure of these days.
WED 9:51 PM
With love, acceptance, and unwavering understanding.
WED 9:52 PM
And and an un willingness to be cast aside.
WED 9:52 PM
He kept saying he way good. I did t stop till my preaching was done. I didn't write 5 pages for bullshit.
WED 9:53 PM
Lol.
WED 9:53 PM
I hope he'll be thinking about it.
WED 9:53 PM
He is fine. Lashed out at me in drunken rage he doesn't remember.
WED 10:02 PM
But it cut deep.
WED 10:02 PM
So I cut deeper.
WED 10:02 PM
With kindness and understanding.
WED 10:02 PM
Few men our age have been married and raised children.
WED 10:03 PM
Away from parents.
WED 10:03 PM
Thay alone.... Trumps all
WED 10:03 PM
Lol
WED 10:03 PM
Bind us together with ties that cannot be broken.
WED 10:04 PM
I am also going to let the step dad who needed two weeks off.
WED 10:05 PM
See if he can take his weeks off from me.
WED 10:06 PM
I'll play hardball. His stepson is at his dad's.
WED 10:06 PM
Come August....
WED 10:06 PM
He has to "play dad again"
WED 10:06 PM
And the how you'd handle this comes rolling in.
WED 10:07 PM
I thank you for your encouragement.
WED 10:07 PM
And I have never given up on you. Just encouraging " introspection"  on how you sell it.
WED 10:08 PM
We all have that idea. But who follows thru. I afraid you are real.
WED 10:08 PM
I'm sure he will never forget your generosity.
WED 10:09 PM
Aye.
WED 10:09 PM
But shall you?
WED 10:09 PM
My memory is not what it used to be, but it's still pretty decent.
WED 10:09 PM
Lol
WED 10:10 PM
Good response
WED 10:10 PM

"if whiskey could talk. It would say I'm a great guy. Or at least it ought to, for as much as I buy." lol. Hope your weekend is good.
SAT 12:44 PM
Aye. Solid weekend so far.
SAT 1:06 PM
