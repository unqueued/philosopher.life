title: 2018.12.21 - Wiki Review: Slogging

* [[2018.12.20 - Antipleonasm Analysis: The Petyr Principle]]
** I'm like this log a lot so far. Am I going to burn out?
* [[2018.12.20 - Prompted Introspection: Restaurant Dream]]
** It is clear what my {[[Dreams]]} are.
* [[2018.12.20 - Wiki Review: Bobby]]
** I'm going to keep looking for fuckups with Bob.
* [[2018.12.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Awesome]]
** Completed.
* [[2018.12.20 - TDL: Bliss]]
** Good luck, sir!!
* [[2018.12.20 - Computer Musings: Chromium Wiki]]
** Just the basics.
** RAM usage is wildly better again; now I just need to resolve the Bob problem.
* [[jason.koebler@vice.com]]
** Doubt I'll receive any response.
* [[Sphygmus: Root Changelog]]
** It's there if she wants to. It's really neat to have someone I trust that much.
* [[2018.12.20 - MTG Log: Watching Us Play]]
** People who adore chess love to read out the move sequences. I love these for magic.
* [[Wiki: Tools]]
** May you grow beyond my wildest dreams!
* [[Search Text or Title Tagger]]
** I tried out the title thing, I'm still unsure how to do this part. It may eventually become a manual replacement for Tiddlytools here.
* [[Test-Output]]
** I'm not sure whether or not the button we'll be using post-firmcoding will actually take those tags out of the list like ol' voldy. This, however, would be a departure from the //Principles://[[Wiki Review]].
* [[2018.12.20 - Be A Good Dad: Wikis]]
** We're going to get there, I hope. My son's grammar holds him back so much. I have to open the door.
* [[2018.12.20 - Wiki Audit: Full Screen]]
** That crash was disheartening. I'm lacking the tooling to engage in mass [[remodeling]].
*** Perhaps I should create a backlog, snapshot, and then run through the backlog on Tiddlytool. It will be easy to reset if it fucks up then.
* [[Tao Te Ching]]
** So far, this book has been exhilarating. I'm enjoying the commentary too. I clearly have very strong (which doesn't they are correct) opinions and feelings about it.
* [[2018.12.20 - AIR: Makin' Me Ho'ngry]]
** I think I am of the only people he talks to outside of work.
