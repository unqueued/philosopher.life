Teacher didn't show up today since he was sick. It may have been planned (given the rumor he said the day before). The Flu is very contagious this year. I'm hoping to avoid it. I'm okay with being out of class today. I got a call later today that we aren't going to have class (as rumored) tomorrow either. Welp. Whatcha' gonna' do? I'll enjoy my time off and work hard on other things. Hopefully we can dive back into it next week.
