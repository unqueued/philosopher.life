title: 2019.10.04 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Cultic Capital Crimes

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
turn customers into fanatics<br>
products into obsessions<br>
employees into ambassadors<br>
and brands into religions<br>
<<<

KYS.

I agree to turning people into fanatics insofar as [[The End]] has universal merit and the means are categorically justified. By definition, you ought have something objectively worthy of investing your identity in. A classic Kantian disagreement with utilitarianism is afoot. I agree we are commodifiable by moral realism; there is intrinsic value in the world, but we are often wrong about it. Are the means and end of capitalism moral? Fuck no. Capitalism is a [[cult]] which centralizes [[power]] for the sake of psychopathic will. This is not the pursuit of [[good]]will: [[The Right]].

Your goal is to manipulate those around you to pursue your egoistic interests, which isn't even close to what matters most. Justified coercion requires there to be no difference. [[The Absolute]] is outside us, even if we help attempt to constitute, implement, or manifest [[It]] inside ourselves.<<ref "i">> This isn't to say we aren't going to have some half-assed obsessions with [[The Beautiful]], as this is also necessary for dialectically appreciating [[The Good]]. But, what we are, essentially, is what we choose to be and become. The ultimate, objective judgment isn't up to us, as it occurs regardless of us; but whether or not we choose to bind ourselves to [[The Moral Law]] is up to us.<<ref "t">>

As our lives become increasingly surveilled by those who politically own us, this ambassadorship becomes integrated into who we are, it seeps into the cracks of our identities, and we are alienated from ourselves. Employees are not as innocent in capitalism as some [[pleft]]ists would have you believe either. How you handle your place in the pyramid is partially up to you. Monkeywrenching and subversive undercover work are solid exceptions.

Capitalism is a religion, and it's the kind which syncretizes, injects itself, hollows out, and consumes the others in dialectics. Is that memetic and material virus justified? How many times must I say it? Lol. No. What we owe to others and our relationship to [[The Other]] is part of every religion.<<ref "e">> 

You do not have the moral right to be just whomever you want. Either in part or whole, we must execute you.

<<footnotes "e" "A willingness to be wrong all the way down is necessary for being right all the way down. Some people take the wrong lesson from epistemic humility: that we ought not be dogmatically pursuing anything into extrema (a hypocritical failure). The claim that we cannot know [[The Absolute]] all the way down is no argument against our hurtling toward it nor our responsibilities in doing so wisely.">>
