title: 2018.07.27 -- Wiki Audit: Crawling

I was speaking with L about the best way to crawl the wiki. She was talking about using [[New]], which makes sense. I think there has to be a systematic story to it as well. I'm not sure what that really looks like. 

{[[About]]} has clearly been slowly transformed. It's come a very long way this past year. I'm proud of myself. My revamp of [[Find The Others]] and slow work in {[[Help]]}, alongside the work I've done in the lesser [[Root]] areas recently shows me that my work is worthwhile. It's not been easy, but hey, it never is.

I need to see about generating ghetto hacks onto the wiki through i3 hotkeys. I can program ridiculous stuff with this tool.

I don't want a wiki mode...I'll need to literally just make keys for it.
