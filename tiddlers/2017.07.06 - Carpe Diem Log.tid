title: 2017.07.06 - Carpe Diem Log

* I woke up, still tired, but not as usual.
* I got the kids up and started.
* I went straight to school, took my test, filled out some paper, talked, and said my goodbyes to my teacher. It's been an amazing journey so far.
* I hit the union, and I was disappointed.
* I went home, checked on the kids, grabbed my checklist and cash, and bought tools.
* I spent time organizing my tools and the car.
* I played some league.
* I watched some league.
* Called the landlord about the dishwasher leaking again. He came in again and will come in tomorrow to replace a tube.
* Inform the men!
* We made excellent burgers today with pretzel buns (never had em before). It was a great meal.
* My mobile devices have been encrypted, refreshed, loaded up, and set for being away.
* I talked with my brother JRE. He invited me to come to Louisville to work; his SO was excited about it too.
* My step-father-in-law sent me an e-mail he felt was an expression of his faith, from the heart to me. 
** I have lots of opinions about it. I don't want to be rude to him, and in this case, he probably couldn't afford to hear my side of things. I think he has a difficult enough time holding onto reality as it is, and he is not rational enough to appreciate my position.
**  It is not clear to me that responding is useful in any possible way here. The timing is interesting, no doubt. 
* I'm going to watch Veep. My wife told me not to watch The Mist. Apparently, the ending would fucking crush me into farcical drink myself into oblivion land.
* Today went by so quickly!
