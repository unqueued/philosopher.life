title: 2020.03.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Hella Napage

* Woke at 10
** My wife arrived! Apparently, she stays only for what must be done on site and then comes back home.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Shower by request, lol. 
* Offspring were okayish, but had a lot of cleanup to do.
* Walked and talked with myself
* Chats
** Almost everyone is home. It's odd.
* [[Wiki Audit]]
** Exact match section hiding listcall didn't close out. It does now.
*** Makes for a shitty search tool in some cases. Yikes.
* Spoke with art studio instructor. We're set for Thursday to meet the man.
** I am skeptical of the guy to say the least, but I'm hoping my daughter will dive into something which matters to her.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
** Didn't last long. Hrm. Sundays, right?
* [[Deep Reading: Tutoring]]: Chapter 5.
** This time, we took turns reading (and I cooked).
** Delightful. Also, a wonderful opportunity to make my offspring cringe and beg me to stfu every few sentences when I read it aloud. :P.
** Immediate discussion of the questions for their dumb old man; his memory aint so good.
*** Not that they took the time to write it down. `/sigh`. 
* Reading
* Spoon on couch (I'm getting too fat) and fell asleep holding my wife. 
** My god, the nap of safety while holding her. I want that every day. I need to lose weight. So hard to do when food is delicious.
* [[vidyas]]: Linear Algebra & Evopsych
** Offspring are now pausing Sapolsky to argue. Good. 
* [[Kintsukuroi]] went well. 
** I clearly need to do this in multiple passes, and I need to use something like the hand-grinder to try to clean sections (that's going to be tricky). 
* [[MTG]] with my daughter, and she defeats me in a match (+1 turn handicap in her favor) with her Vintage Affinity vs my Legacy Goblins. 
* Walked and talked with myself.
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* [[Kintsukuroi]] cleaning
* Tried sleeping by 3...but don't think it stuck until 4:30
