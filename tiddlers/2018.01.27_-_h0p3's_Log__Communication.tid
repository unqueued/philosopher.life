title: 2018.01.27 - h0p3's Log: Communication

I notice that few people reach out to communicate with me, and I tend to be the initiator in most cases. This asymmetry is not an accident. It says something about who we are. I don't know if it means I'm the asshole, they are assholes, we all are assholes, or something more complex. Relationships, of course, are two-way streets. 

It makes me sad that we don't communicate much. It must be stressful. That's okay. I'll keep knocking on the door. What else ought I do? I will take solace in communicating with myself!
