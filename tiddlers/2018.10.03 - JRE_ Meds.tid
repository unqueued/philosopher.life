title: 2018.10.03 - JRE: Meds

My brother thinks he missed his meds last night. He was up very late because of it. I am sorry! I know that feel. 

He's restocked the house with food. It cost him $1k to get the fridge and more food.

We talked about Joe Rogan's newest standup. I grabbed a copy just now. Need to make some tiddlers for this shit.

We talked about [[Michael Blouin]].

We talked about [[kickscondor]]'s tool. 

He said he may have found an Other, but thinks maybe not. 

He has not done the timeline, and that project is dropped. He is trying to schedule an appointment with a therapist. He is worried his meds aren't having the same effect on him. I will pay close attention with him as best I can.
