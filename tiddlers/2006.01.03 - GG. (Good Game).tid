title: 2006.01.03 - GG. (Good Game)

We are through the holiday season (finally).

j3d1h had her Birthday. She was sick for it, a cold. You'd be surprised how much snot we bubbled out of her nose. She was choking and coughing horribly all night. We pumped Mucinex, Benedryl and Tylenol into her for 2 days (literally around the clock...her fever subsided quickly, thankfully). Oddly enough, she has some extra spunk in her after being sick (although, she still has the sniffles and stuffy nose). The kid is almost full blown walking everywhere now. It is kinda odd to look across the room and see a kid walking at you...she has been quite active in the past few days. She's getting much better at walking/running....in time, using silverware, consistently dropping a deuce in the toilet (she is scared of water *sigh), and speaking will make her even better.

I do believe the broom is my favorite tool in the house. I'm always amazed at what that child can do to the floor in less than 30 seconds. She manages to throw food she doesn't care for on the floor, and since we are cleaning the floor anyways, we brush&quot;left-overs&quot; in her high-chair onto the floor to make it a 5-minute cleanup, ...broom pwnage. ...which reminds me, I'm getting a late X-mas present, a t-shirt that say &quot;Pwn Star&quot; lol.

The car the acting odd...transmission issue possibly. Time to goto the mechanic.The fluids are checked often enough, and it seems like everything I can do is taken care of. (&lt;---what is this called again?...it is supposed to be a terrible no-no..but I don't really care, we speak like this all the time...not that I am attentive to what I'm actually writingggggggggggggggg...oops, too late, can't erase it now.) I'll have to find someone to bum a ride to drive us back, maybe even borrow a car for a few days.

I'm sitting here at work, doing my usual. Reading and writing, even about the mundane, keep me alive in here. These people are...Tards. Unwise and unintelligent people... (Sound elitist don't I? pfft...) The only reading that goes on that I can see, beyond work related/required is crappy novels, often love stories (bleh). Hey, it isn't likeÂ I readÂ a ton anymore either. My reading, unfortunately, is forced to be online (which isn't very high quality, but with a good eye and a mind for searching out significant information in that ocean, you can find some very interesting things to read)....But, atleast I do something real. Of course, to blue-collar folks, they look at thinking and ideas as something that isn't real because it isn't concrete.

I realize that k0sh3k and I are very different from the rest of the world...we perceive it very differently. When I look at the world, the most real things to me are actually abstract ideas. That doesn't me I don't use concrete things, but I truly look at the concrete as a means to the abstract, that our solid bodies (yeah, I'm &quot;slightly&quot; gnostic in some sense...minus the whole Demiurge bullshit) of mass simply don't compare in purity to those wonderful, ethereal abstract ideas. I can't point a concrete thing out that isn't based upon ideas. Ideas are the cause of things, not the other way around. Most people perceive the world in the concrete...in fact, even people who consider themselves good at dealing in abstract concepts are usually quite concrete. Even people I'd consider generally intelligent eventually will throw away ideas for the concrete, they lose their pursuit of ideas because they are &quot;practical.&quot; Since when did practicality matter? Show me one thing in God's Will that was practical that wasn't first based and made primarily for the sake of an idea. You can't. Practical thinking is the way of the lazy. Period. It is a quick judgement of those who don't have the patience or resources to continue to think in the realm of ideas.k0sh3k and I don't live amongst these people or these things. Sure, we are forced to encounter them...But, we aren't one of them.

Of course, this may just be my bias from where I live, where it is impossible to find anyone like us. But, I am convinced there are few like me in this world. Gives me a good topic to write on...k0sh3k/Jim/Allen/I have had an interesting topic going on for a while. It is primarily me on oneside (as usual)...but I am correct (as usual). It is a discussion of the &quot;supposed&quot; differences between intelligence in wisdom. I'm sure they must get tired of me ;P...better not to broach the subject at all? Why take the time to really examine it? Does it hurt your head? lol.

By the way, had some B&amp;N cards to blow, grabbed the full set of Calvin and Hobbes and a book about Dragonology *cough, guess which one I like the most? =)

anyways, I'll get to work and maybe write on that topic for a while...my mind has already drifted a lot today.
