!! Audit:

* Always short. There is no serious analysis either.
* Of course, this has been a very hard month. I can't expect more. I've done the best I can with what I've had.
* There are plenty of times where I get to follow up. The follow-up-edness is useful.
* I emote quite a bit here.
* Tool addiction has been strong. I'm glad to see it rounding off though.
* Quarterly audits don't seem worth it. I can barely keep my head above water to do the monthly ones right now.
* It's clear that I'm worried about writing so little in my wiki this month. I feel like I can only do it in short bursts on the weekends. I will not fail.
* Not enough DCK in a sense, but it was all I could do.
* This Wiki Log has helped me see the need to restructure the root directory. I've got a lot more work to do to get this place up and running. 
* I've been Dreaming more this month. I'm glad.
* My sexual gratification has been on and off.
* This month flew by. It has been insane.
* The revamp is slow. I feel like I'm planning the rest of my year out.
* My weekends are explosions on the wiki.
* Just keep writing and working. It gets better!
* My wife still hasn't edited.
* The [[Link Log]] pileup is huge.
