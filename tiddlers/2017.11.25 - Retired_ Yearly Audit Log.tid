!! About:

//The 2017 h0p3's Wiki Audit!//<<ref "2018.12.20">>

This is a long-term version of [[Wiki Review Log]]. In [[Wiki Review Log]] I tend to give my visceral reactions to my writing only a day later. This is useful, it extends my short-term memory, it keeps me thinking about the problem, it helps me see my train of thought over a period of time, and it's part of the natural feedback loop mechanisms of the wiki. It can't do everything though. My review only results in minor revisions and edits (imperfectly, to say the least), but it's hard to improve work you just created sometimes. When you walk away from your work and come back to it months later, when you stand back and see what you've created from a more objective point of view, where it isn't so painful to think about it or alter it, you can truly recreate it. That's what this audit is all about.

I'm here to take an existential inventory, to create accountability feedback loops, and to shape myself with proven knowledge of myself. This is existential maintenance.

As I've pointed out in {[[Focus|Current Focus of h0p3's Wiki]]}, I want to audit the wiki every year. I want to see how I need to reshape it, and I want to actually force myself to do it. This is my first year auditing the wiki, and that's because it is my first year actually having a wiki. Obviously, it isn't going to be perfect. But, I should do my best. I'm learning to swim here. I probably need to audit from multiple angles. This is a complex object to interpret, edit, and organize. The correct strategy is not obvious. When in doubt, shotgun approach! I must say, I am wary of this becoming too bureaucratic and quagmiric. This is my first time though, and I so may only get something very simplistic. h0p3, you have to be okay with imperfection. Dive in, please.<<ref "1">>

!! Principles:

I want to actually perform Yearly Audits of Logs themselves in the same way that I do monthly audits. 

I also want to completely re-read, restructure, and reflect upon the wiki as a whole. 

* I'm going to follow my wife's look. She just went systematically through it.
* I think I should edit/revise as I re-read the wiki.
* I should keep that changelog effect going. That changelog goes here.
** Put whatever seems relevant, whatever you can remember, and whatever you can.
* Think of this as the [[Wiki Review Log]] on a grander scale.
* The goal is to come up with content after I've digested the year for [[About]]. I want to do a good job writing it. This is done, in part, in virtue of that. This is an instrument.
* I'll start at the top-level directories/pages, and work 0-links deep, then 1-link deep, then 2-links deep, etc. 
** Conversely, I could just go directory by directory, but this won't have breadth integrity I'm looking for, I think.

!! Dreams:

* I don't spend nearly enough time working on {[[Vault|The Vault of h0p3]]} and {[[Dreams|Dreams of h0p3]]}. 
** That will eventually change, right?
* I think I should add my course structures and my notes to this wiki.
* I'd love to see Tags added to every single page. I don't know the [[WH5]] though.
* Take a [[Retired:]] snapshot of every major directory on 2017.12.31.
** Let's make it an annual thing, assuming there have been significant revisions in the first place.
* Make sure you go through the orphans and hidden parts of the wiki.
* After you have completed the 2017 Yearly Audit. You must read the Audit again and respond to it. This is, in part, what {[[About]]} is really trying to do.
