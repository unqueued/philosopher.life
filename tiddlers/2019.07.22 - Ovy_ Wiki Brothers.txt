[10:47 AM] h0p3: Damn. :frowning:
[10:47 AM] h0p3: Try Firefox
[10:48 AM] h0p3: Might find addons to help you too (plus, you get an adblocker)
[10:56 AM] Valdus: OK
[10:56 AM] h0p3: How goes the construction?
[11:06 AM] Valdus: good news and bad
[11:07 AM] h0p3: Shoot
[11:15 AM] Valdus: no java error messages like on chrome, no pop up screen like in safari- saving to the main wiki but it is not saving locally. Twiddlyfox was destroyed in the new firefox, once again apple stupidities. I hope Jobs rots in his pancreatic grave!
[11:15 AM] Valdus: You should be honored my friend, you have become a tag in my wiki!
[11:16 AM] h0p3: Lol, I am honored. You are a tag in mine as well

[11:21 AM] Valdus: put that in your wiki!
[11:21 AM] h0p3: I don't put images in my wiki, but text, yes.
[11:22 AM] h0p3: I aim to keep my wiki slim and singlefile
[11:23 AM] Valdus: I hear ya, maybe when I go international I will change it but its too much fun now!
[11:24 AM] h0p3: If and when you decide you want to share you wiki with others, I can help you reason about how to do that.
[12:56 PM] Valdus: Iâ€™d want to share anything that is not marked archive
[10:25 PM] h0p3: Bob can do it, if you want to do it manually.
[10:25 PM] h0p3: Can use a filter expression to create a new wiki from an old one.
[10:26 PM] h0p3: Even allows for tiddler name transformations.
[10:26 PM] h0p3: Automating through scripting  is also possible.
[9:20 PM] Valdus: still havent gotten courrier font.
[9:20 PM] h0p3: Have you been able to change to other fonts?
[9:21 PM] Valdus: nothing since I went to neonize, nada.
[9:21 PM] h0p3: Can you change it in an empty tiddler?
[9:21 PM] Valdus: I dont know what a  font family is, Ive used nothing but orphans!
[10:02 PM] h0p3: Have you tried replacing the line with "Courier"?
[10:03 PM] h0p3: It works for me.
