Kennett, ‘Autism, Empathy & Moral Agency’

Kennett considers whether empirical research points toward Humean or Kantian perspectives on moral agency.



345

“basis for morality” or “an explanation of many cases we consider to be moral ones?”

Empathy is important to us as agents, but is it necessary for moral agency? Kennett thinks not.

Lacking empathy doesn’t mean one can’t be a moral agent. Autistic people are “capable of compensating for this deficit and becoming conscientious, though often clumsy, moral agents.”

Kennett focuses upon high-function autistic children, Asperberger’s, for example.



346

Triad of deficits are relevant to the sentimentalist, Humean capacity.



348-349

Autistic and psychopathic individuals have these sorts of deficits in common. Treating people as instruments (rather than ends in themselves). Psychopaths, unlike autistics, can actually predict and read other people, and so the autistic person may even lack empathy even moreso than the psychopath it seems.

Are autism and psychopathy really so parallel in this case?

The social handicap of the autism prevents them from deceiving others, and it shields them from corruption and from taking on mean human dispositions (jealous, lying, cheating, etc.). This moral innocence isn’t moral character or agency though.



350

Lacking emotion may actually help us to attain a kind of moral purity that couldn’t be achieved otherwise. (Virtue ethicists come charging in!!!)



352

Sinclair example. He realizes he should do something! Through rationality, he deduced that the other’s distress is a reason for action. Famous Kant passage on “little sympathy.”



354

The difference between autistics and psychopaths is that the autistic is capable of deep moral concern (although not empathy), while the psychopath is not capable. Moral reasons just aren’t motivating for the psychopath.



355

The psychopath fails to grasp or form any conception of his or other’s ends (pretty Kantian here). That’s why he can be indifferent to others, and that is also why he is an illogical egoist (lulz, if any egoist could really be logical).



357

Hume’s emphasis on emotion and empathy makes practical sense. It doesn’t, however, describe what is required for moral agency, even if it can be instrumental in being or becoming a moral agent.







McGeer, ‘Varieties of Moral Agency: Lessons from Autism’

227

Hume vs. Kant [Reason] (deducing the right thing to do and “channeling our ‘affective forces’”)



228

Why should we think empirical research tells us what comprises moral agency? It may juice our intuitions, but I fear we shouldn’t think empirical research solves the problem by itself. We might be making assumptions we shouldn’t.



229

Disagrees that reason is the core of moral motive, and rather we’ve simply focused too much upon empathy instead of the broader range of emotions which do form the core of moral motive.

Tributaries of affectively laden concern: (1) concern for others, (2) concern with social position and structure, (3) concern with “cosmic” structure and position. These tributaries of concern push the Humean perspective, I assume.



230

Walks us through the noteworthy features of psychopathy we’ve already studied. Nice summation.



231

“this work on psychopaths seems to support the view that the capacity for moral thought and action is strongly dependent on our affec-tive natures and in particular the capacity to respond empathetically to others’ affective states, to experience a vicarious emotional response to how they affectively experience the world, and especially to feel some distress at their distress and suffering”

Why should I agree? Why the “capacity” instead of the “likelihood”? They might still have the capacity (via reason, e.g.), but generally don’t exercise it and aren’t likely to exercise it. We might hold them “less responsible for it,” but that doesn’t necessarily mean they lack the capacity. Although, to be fair, McGreer is agreeing with Kennett that psychopaths aren’t moral agents. That isn’t obvious to me at all though. Kant can actually explain why psychopaths do count as moral agents, and neither author makes a move to explain this away.



238

Broad generalization of Kennett: Anyone who does not revere reason is not a moral agent

Narrow Interpretation of McGreer: reason plays a particular kind of compensating role, filling in the gaps produced by lacking empathy.



239

False-belief tasks. Autistics suck at them.

Highly intelligent autistics “hack” out a way to decode the puzzle of other minds.



240

In many cases, it seems as though Autistics seek order (and sometimes morality) simply out of self-preservation, for the sake of having rules and regulation to make life livable, and not out of moral feelings and for the sake of the moral law.



244

Not convinced that Autistics have a “core moral motive”



246

Affect must play a critical role in agency.



247-248

Human beings are moral beings because of our affective natures.



251

“All forms of human agency are rooted in affect. We are the kind of moral beings we are because we have powerful emotional reactions to certain kinds of events or situations; namely, events or situations that touch upon various disinterested concerns. Furthermore, in all human beings there are three distinct varieties of disinterested concern, rooted, I suggest, in distinct cognitive-affective systems: (1) a concern for the well-being of others, (2) a concern with social structure and social position, and (3) a concern with cosmic structure and cosmic position. Given these concerns, various events or situations will provoke different kinds of emotional responses, priming us to take different kinds of action…these different spheres of concern can lead to emotional responses that pull in different, sometimes even conflicting directions. How we resolve such conflicts may well depend on which kind of concern is most dominant in us.”

“Moderately different varieties of moral agency can emerge as a consequence of how these three spheres of disinterested concern develop and interact in a given person, varying according to individual differences as well as under the sway of different cultural influences”



252

“My proposal is that what makes autistic moral agency distinctively human is that, just as with typically developing individuals, these three spheres of disinterested concern are operative in individuals with autism”



254

Psychopaths are impaired, the three spheres of disinterested concern aren’t operating in them, which flattens their affective world and calls into question their moral agency.



5.1 – Reasons, Reverence, and Value

260

Kennett challenges McGreer, saying McGreeg douts that reason could itself be motivating (in the Kantian sense).

Reverence for reason is not a single motive, but a disposition to seek and respond to normative consideration, parallel to McGreer’s recharacterization of Empathy.



5.2 – The Will to Conform

God, Stanford experiment, no idea.

Social aspect/sphere of morality is necessary for understanding morality?



5.3 – Autism, Morality, and Empathy

274

“Autism raises the following paradox:

(a) Humean view: Empathy is the only source of morality.

(b) People who have no empathy should have no morality.

(c) People with autism show a lack of empathy.

(d) People with autism show a sense of morality.



To solve this paradox, McGeer refutes premise (a) and its consequence (b). She concludes that empathy is not a necessary condition for morality.”

Egocentric/Allocentric distinction. No idea where we are going.
