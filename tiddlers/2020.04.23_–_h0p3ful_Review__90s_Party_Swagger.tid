** If your joke is not demonstrably sarcasm, you shouldn't attempt it on such a problematic issue (at least not without some profound reason). This seems to be in what is called "poor taste," and, in this case, you should reconsider. 
*** I'm not saying you can't be this absurd, but you will pay a price for it. I think you are too young to pay that price. 
*** You remember how many times we've had to curtail your use of swearwords? You gotta cuss right. Same here, homie. 
**** This is so audience dependent. I know it's not easy to understand.

** What do you think "a 90's party" means, was like, was about?
** You bring up some excellent arguments. Thank you.
** You are hopping around too quickly. We need transitions between your ideas and arguments.
*** Look, I can almost literally hear your voice when I read your words (there's a [[1uxb0x]] sound in my head, with similar cadence, intonation, etc.). I know this sounds so natural, in the way you would say it at the dinner table. I get what you are saying just fine, but you shouldn't aim to speak to someone who knows how to hear you. Your goal is to elevate your speech in writing well beyond the blurry disjointed slurs we emit from our Neanderthal mouths. Make it for everyone (to whatever [[dok]] you can). It should sound better when you had the chance to edit the characters on the screen.

** I see that we are trying to work on making sure your excellent sense of humor lands and fits. I see you doing it often, you know, where you stop yourself and decide to continue the conversation. We're going to keep trying to understand which social conventions objectively matter (or might). 
*** You make solid progress here. Look at the difference between what you have found humorous over time. Look at how you place yourself in conversation trains. Your delivery and content are often funny.
**** e.g. consider our vacation. Your "glock" joke was funny; it was also surprising to hear from an 11yo (at the time).

** Lol. Yup. It do be like that sometimes.
** =/. I wish you didn't skip out on the rest of the log though.
** You get to have that swagger when you actually do your work, bud.

** Experience doesn't necessarily make us better (and better at what?). 
** I don't understand the hat metaphor. You should clarify this.

** Keep it up, sir. Make sure to redraft and improve this over time. Maybe a virtuoso can get it right the first time, but all the rest of us have to keep trying to complete these kinds of tasks in stages. Your effort is right. Thank you for trying so hard.
*** By the end of this book, you'll have written quite a bit about it. I'm hoping you will have a paper you write about the entire book too. That would be worth trying to draft several times too.

** Maybe we should make some [[Text Art]] with links embedded. 
*** Maybe not [[Poem: SMITH]], but something like [[Family]] seems like a place to grow. I don't know what we'd do, but think about it, eh?
** Interesting to see philosophy in [[2019.04.23 – Print Reading: 3 things]].
