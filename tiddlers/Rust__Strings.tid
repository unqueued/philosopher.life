title: Rust: Strings

The to_string() method converts from a &str into a String. Strings are automatically converted into &str when you borrow a reference to them.

```cpp
fn main() {
    let s = "Jane Doe".to_string();
    say_hello(&s);
}

fn say_hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello {}!", name);
}
```
