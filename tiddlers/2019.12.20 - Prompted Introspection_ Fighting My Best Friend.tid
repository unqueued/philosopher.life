title: 2019.12.20 - Prompted Introspection: Fighting My Best Friend

!! How do you feel when you have had a fight with your best friend?

What consists in a fight? She asked me out because I was almost constantly arguing with her in our classes.<<ref "a">> You don't mean just any conflict (I live for her to dunk on me). No, no, you mean the ones that destroy me. You mean the ones that turn me inside out, the ones where I'm shaking inside enough that I've a slight vibrato, where my words are measured with lasers because I'm legitimately scared to be angry, where I quietly continue to speak with her over and over until there is resolution, the agony of hearing "I'm fine," the unintentional stabbing pain I see in both of us, where I've made so many fucking mistakes that I just can't bear to make a mistake like that one time I told her to "shut up" and "fuck you" and even though I come back to apologize I can never erase the moment burned into me forever. You mean that fight, right? I would rather die than fight her. Please, anything but that. The shame, oddly enough, is the easy part. No, she might forgive me, but that's all I'm ever going to hear in myself when we fight, that mistake I can't take back.

They don't get easier except for the confidence of having successfully navigated the chaotic waters with integrity before.
