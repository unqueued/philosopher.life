title: 2018.10.01 - Deep Reading: The Shadow Over Innsmouth

~~My wife did some editing for this series, I believe.~~ She thinks it captures the essence of Lovecraft. I'm ignorant here. It's got the twisty, ironic, playful, haunting feel. The poetry was cute, but it felt forced too often. Still, it's really hard to make it fit the standard form for practically the entire book. 

The Other becomes internalized towards the end. It's a fun mix of curiosity and horror. The deep sea has always been the most alien part of our world.

This is short, and it should stay short. 

One thing I'm probably missing is the historic symbolism. It feels too much like allegory for it not to be, right? There are several power dynamics here.

I still don't know.
