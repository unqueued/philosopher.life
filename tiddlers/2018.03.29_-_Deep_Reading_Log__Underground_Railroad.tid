title: 2018.03.29 - Deep Reading Log: Underground Railroad

Ridgeway is filled with contradiction. It requires a kind of insanity, I suppose. He is redpilled, honest, somehow understands the evil of the world around him, kind of.

Escaping is visceral in this book, and often viscerality is held to a minimum to overwhelm us.

Irrelevant: I've got the "tunnel madness."

What the fuck was that swamp death scene?

At least Ridgeway gets #rekt.
