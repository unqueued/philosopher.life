Dude! I got a call today. It was a pre-interview call. Apparently they have like three specific questions they are asking the candidates they've narrowed down before they bring them in for interviews. I did not get asked the questions today. But I did schedule a time to call and answer the questions tomorrow.
JUL 9 5:29 PM
So in short I guess I made it past the first hurdle. LOL!
JUL 9 5:30 PM
Still keeping my hope and expectations low. I have a fear that may try to lowball me on wage. But definitely an exciting new development.
JUL 9 5:31 PM
What is the minimum wage you will accept?
JUL 9 5:32 PM
Congratz on the call.
JUL 9 5:32 PM
Do you know what the questions are?
JUL 9 5:32 PM
I have no idea on the questions they're going to ask. But I speculate they will be 10 questions asked for each applicant
JUL 9 5:35 PM
Canned questions
JUL 9 5:36 PM
I hope you prepare some canned responses.
JUL 9 5:36 PM
You read my cover letter there's not much else I could say I don't think. But I'm long-winded and a very good bullshiter.
JUL 9 5:36 PM
Your call, of course.
JUL 9 5:36 PM
Sounds like a test worth studying for, especially since they are canned.
JUL 9 5:37 PM
Of course I will man. I have all morning to speculate and to be anxious about it. I have also been to a lot of interviews. A lot of very stressful interviews. I am pretty well tested in that regard.
JUL 9 5:38 PM
Cool beans. Well, I wish you luck.
JUL 9 5:38 PM
The director of the aviation maintenance program knows me well. We have mutual friends, we used to smoke cigarettes together, and I had to show him how to change his search bar in Internet Explorer from Bing to Google.
JUL 9 5:39 PM
The other guy who I think has veto power over Donnie I am unsure of his position. My research will be finding out exactly what his position is and Catering to him more so than Donnie
JUL 9 5:39 PM
Growing, recruiting, making massive impact on children in Appalachia and the surrounding regions. I got all them words LOL
JUL 9 5:40 PM
I am glad you are feeling confident about the interview. Good.
JUL 9 5:41 PM
They can always trip you up with situational questions. As in how would you handle this if this happens. Which really is difficult to prepare for you really just got to think on your feet. But yeah haven't been to so many interviews and already having a job helps. I would not accept this position for less than 40,000 a year. That equates to roughly $20 an hour. That's less than the medium wage for aircraft mechanics.
JUL 9 5:44 PM
I hear that.
JUL 9 5:45 PM
I also know what the current teacher makes. What entry level pay is. What they have paid adjunct professors for in the past
JUL 9 5:45 PM
Cool.
JUL 9 5:45 PM
I hope they don't lowball you.
JUL 9 5:46 PM
I'm sure that they will but I can easily counter. And also identify the safety sensitive part of the job that necessitates I get paid a similar wage to those working in the field.
JUL 9 5:47 PM
I don't think it's difficult to provide a reasonable defense of why you deserve to be paid fairly.
JUL 9 5:47 PM
I hope they buy good reason.
JUL 9 5:48 PM
Also if the director chooses me and everyone is on board. I can get more Insider info on wage increases and expectations and stuff like that. I think this is a tenure-track position
JUL 9 5:48 PM
, have to remind myself that having Summers off only working 4 days a week only working like 7 hours a day and having spring break fall break in 2 weeks at Christmas is worth a lot of money.! Lol
JUL 9 5:49 PM
And literally being 5 minutes from my home
JUL 9 5:49 PM
Sounds like a dream, sir.
JUL 9 5:50 PM
I hope you get the job.
JUL 9 5:50 PM
Still operating under part code of Federal Regulation part 147 aviation maintenance School. So cannabis is off the table.
JUL 9 5:52 PM
Dreams are mountains. One step at a time.
JUL 9 5:52 PM
Always full of words of wisdom. Thank you for your encouragement and your help at proofreading and your letter of recommendation.
JUL 9 5:53 PM
I felt very confident attaching that cover letter after having you proofread it
JUL 9 5:53 PM
JUL 9 6:00 PM

The program director I use to smoke ciggs with and look at pics of hot celebs in the tool crib. Lmao
JUL 10 6:18 PM
The safe for work kind. Lol
JUL 10 6:19 PM
Either there is alot of competition. Or the assistant dean just wants me to think that.
JUL 10 6:19 PM
I can see both.
