title: 2019.04.09 - JRE: Mini-Strike

My brother noticed a power pole that keeps leaning further and further, obviously dangerously. He brings it up to the appropriate boss, and then they shit on him. This is what the union is supposed to be (although, the Louisville electrician union has it in their contracts that they can't strike, which is fucking retarded evil). He took the rest of the day off. Good for him.

He's going to possibly work in the shop or play VR. I hope it is relaxing, and I hope he sleeps well.

```
He just called to apologize :sweat_smile:
TUE 2:42 PM
Good.
TUE 4:37 PM
```

His boss called him up to 80% apologize. Good. I hope it won't affect my brothers standing or relationships in a negative way. 

The VR game sounds like barbaric sculpting and a good deal of fun. I think he's right that it appeals to masculine desires.
