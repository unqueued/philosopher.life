Kids everywhere driving me crazy, but that's normal. Reading and writing. I feel like I'm in a tar pit or something, work hard and get no where.
WED 11:58 AM
My muscles are going to be awesome by the end of it though, right?

I'm at the gym right now I finished running and trying to do more with bicycling. My knees sore so I need something that not put weight on my legs.
WED 12:01 PM
You might try swimming. Good aerobic exercise, easy on the body.
WED 12:02 PM
I, however, am not going to exercise besides stretching, yoga, and walking. I have no room to talk, lol.
WED 12:02 PM
I don't like swimming very much knocking my husband and Melissa but I appreciate your thought.
WED 12:04 PM
Not knocking I mean not like
WED 12:04 PM
Gotcha. Yeah, well,  at least you are doing something. Some people prefer the runner's high.

To my understanding, a small percentage experience chemical withdrawls from it. It's a real dependency (but a good one).
WED 12:07 PM
I think I became a running fan.
