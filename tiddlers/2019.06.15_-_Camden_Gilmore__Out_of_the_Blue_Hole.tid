It's [[good]] to {[[hear from you|Contact]]}. It looks like you've already taken a plunge into the wiki, but please let me know if I can {[[help]]} you, [[nomad|Find The Others]]. 

<<<
Just a short note to say thank you for my visit to your mind.
<<<

You are welcome! I don't hear many people who say it that plainly. [[Hope]]fully, it has been useful or fun for you. I'm glad that it affords us the chance to meet. It's my honor to be worth your time.

I think it's a wonderful thing that we can comfortably [[ping|FTO: Ping]] each other out of the blue. 

<<<
Just stumbled onto TiddlyWiki today by way of learning about Ted Nelson, but my usual broad strokes of perusing fell into the black hole of h0p3’s Wiki. Lord; bless you.
<<<

Ha, yeah, I think it is growing into a black hole. I'm curious to know what it's like to fall into it as a stranger.

I'm surprised I haven't scared you away, lol. I'm a madman out here in the desert. I'm not usually anyone's cup of tea. I'm grateful that you would reach out to me. 

Are you getting into Tiddlywiki too? It's quite a tool. I speak with people over my wiki somewhat often,<<ref "s">> and it's been interesting to find other [[Public Self-Modelers]]. I like to think some of us are engaged in [[hyperconversations]], and I bet Ted Nelson would appreciate that claim too. Would you like to join us in thinking about ourselves and each other together? 

<<<
I’ve never seen anything like it. The closest would be reading through “Pascal’s Pensees”.
<<<

That's some high praise. Thank you for the comparison. I'm blazing (ha) through the [[Pensées]] now, and I can see some similarities. I try to understand how other works in [[The Great Human Conversation]] can serve as a useful rolemodel for me since I don't really know what I'm doing in here all too often. I'm lucky to have other people help me reason about this giant mess. Where do you think I should go with the wiki? Also, what are your thoughts on Pascal and his Pensees?<<ref "r">>

<<<
I feel as though I should pay something for such a trip, but at least I can thank you for your work. I look forward to thinking about why your wiki has touched me so.
<<<

That is kind of you. I am not accustomed to being thanked for my work. I am, of course, interested to know why my wiki was touching to you too. What parts stood out to you?

I'm always down to talk, though I must warn you that I am sometimes quite slow. My last letter to [[kickscondor]] took months to write. Please take as long as you'd like to respond. I'd like to think some of my conversations will require decades (though that may be counting my chickens). 

Tell me about yourself.<<ref "a">> I'm fairly blind on this end. I look forward to hearing back from you. 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
