Decided to do a system upgrade last night while I was drunk. Cool story, bro. FFDE crashed, and I couldn't get my sessions back.

SAVED MY ASS! Saved to my hard drive in case that shit disappears. Unfortunately, there are thousands of links in the output, and no footholds to parse it. I am clearly doing something wrong. Add-ons installed. Session Boss and Session Sync. Let's see what I like.

Bigger problem, my system time is fucked on reboot (I suspect our electrical problems in the house is to blame, but that is a mere hunch). Trying i3-Manjaro's bmenu option first for NTP. Otherwise, I'll set it up myself. No need for that manual shit. I suspect this may actually be part of the problem for FFDE, since it wouldn't even sync.
