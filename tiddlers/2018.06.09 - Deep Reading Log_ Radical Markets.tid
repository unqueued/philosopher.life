title: 2018.06.09 - Deep Reading Log: Radical Markets

I am, of course, worried about creating a market for something which may actually just be a human right.

The authors are virtue signaling really hard; I really don't think they empathize with humans. Listen to the arguments carefully. The stories are also quite misleading.

This is disturbing. It is obvious that we are creating indentured servants; this will be abused. I think this will be slavery.

This is clearly meant to help wealthy people.

Why do you think these people won't be exploited? What makes you think they have a choice to fight back against exploitation? This is bullshit.

Neo-Liberal "Cultural" exchange bullshit.

Look, I'm very much interested in helping the global poor, but not through the artificial bottleneck of empowering the wealthy further.

This VIP system is obviously a terrible idea.

This is the wealthy making it easy for all of us to enslave others from the rest of the world...

Let's "legalize" slavery so that the slaves receive at least marginally better treatment.

This is not the best way to end global inequality. This is a false stop gap. Disgusting.

This is NOT the best we can hope for in the short term.

These vignettes are rhetoric.

They are correct about these quiet juggernaut investment firms forming monopolies.

Indexing does a have problem in that it makes us not attempt to understand why the market is the way it is, it causes us to not take responsibility for it, and to enable others to take over with very different motives. Emerging dominance of institutional investors is code for "Crisis of Capitalism" idiots.

Why should I think we will be able to keep institutional investors from colluding and ultimately building more complex models? This 1% oligopoly maximum rule is interesting. Can we shell against this though? I think so. This isn't going to work. NM! They talk about a possible provision. Regardless, I think destroying capitalism requires something different here.

Mirror voting indexing is interesting.

What I like about QV market is that you can't simply buy more VT's with VT's. There's no way to generate more political capital beyond the set inflationary rate.

The issue of law firms being unwilling to take on the big dogs is hilarious.

I love how they say "markets without competition aren't markets at all"....you need to just say it: many free markets destroy themselves.

The digital aspect seems unlikely. I'm listening though.

I favor central planning in this respect. Building decentralized digital tools requires government intervention, and I think IP should be abolished in the first place.

I am open to the possibility that we need to generate enormous datasets, and I think that it would be best that they are anonymized and made absolutely public. IP has to die! The best answer is for us to collectively own the capital which arises from the means of production, and that can only occur if we all own the means of production.

If corporations thought they could make more money by paying their users, they would.

Technofeudalism is correct, and I do stay away from being harvested for many reasons.

I think my method is wildly more effective and moral.

It's so weird to hear economists who are legitimately concerned with destroying monopoly powers with radical moves. Unfortunately, these aren't radical enough.

I am pleased to see them talk about Marx. They are not amazingly charitable, but they pay more than lip service.

They've done a shit job of understanding how politicized money and propaganda has suppressed union support. I'm glad to see they favor collective bargaining.

They are far, far too optimistic about AI. I think this is dangerous. 

Unfortunately, these ideas only solve a sliver of the problems arising from Capitalism.

Monetizing QV is a huge fucking problem. You should go to prison for it. It's obviously only fair if economic equality existed. We have to force equality in voting. I can't trust these evil men, I can see.

You can hear the arguments in favor of entrenching immoral powers here. Ugh.

Sophisticated gamification of QV is a very serious problem. We'd need to radically punish anyone who fucks up in this sphere.

Clearly, they think very highly of markets. Their caveats range from being mere artifice-rhetoric to what appears to be valid epistemic humility. This was an interesting book.
