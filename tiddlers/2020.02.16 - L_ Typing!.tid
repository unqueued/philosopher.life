[5:26 PM]  h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#Fostering%20Intimacy

[2:57 PM]  h0p3: So what are your plans for the weekend?

[2:04 PM]  h0p3: How's your weekend going?
[2:19 PM]  Sohalia: Good actually!
[2:19 PM]  h0p3: Yay :slight_smile:
[2:20 PM]  Sohalia: Had a chill Saturday, got to hang out with [[K]] and I managed to finish the first chapter of this thing I call a manuscript
[2:21 PM]  Sohalia: Work was hell this week so he and I hadn't really gotten to spend much time together (and I haven't really been keeping track of my phone much either, as a result)
[2:23 PM]  h0p3: You are typing up the manuscript yeah? Or doing that by hand?
[2:23 PM]  h0p3: And, congratz on the first chapter.
[2:25 PM]  h0p3: I'm sorry work was hell. :frowning:
[2:26 PM]  h0p3: It sucks not to feel close with your hubby too. Sounds like the weenend has been restoring.
[2:31 PM]  Sohalia: Typing! Hell naw am I writing that by hand lol
[2:32 PM]  Sohalia: It really has been. I'm just waiting for the insanity to die down at this point. We'll see how that goes.
[2:40 PM]  Sohalia: How are you all? Situation improving at all?
[4:06 PM]  h0p3: Health is solid enough. It's not been an easy week with my daughter, in particular. [[k0sh3k]] is still exploring the internal structures and expectations in Yale; still lots of thinking to do. Still sorting our vehicles out, but we make progress. Their wikis have been improving, so I'm glad to get us back into the groove here; you should check out [[k0sh3k]]'s too: http://k0sh3k.philosopher.life/.
