title: 2019.11.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Tiddlying Myself

//Feels something like body language.//

* Woke at 9
** Noice. Head hurts, as usual, but I feel like I slept.
*** MY WIFE SLEPT! Awesome. 
* Talked and held my wife until she fell asleep again.
* Inform the Men!
* My offspring tell me I look like a casual teacher today. Cool.
** My daughter is a bit grumpy today. I wonder if the move is hurting more than it initially seems.
* Read+Write
* Cleaning
* //The Newsroom//
* A good drive with the family.
* Fried Fish with [[Charlie]], Aunt Missy, and Uncle Carl
** I had such a good time with them. We talked and talked.
** Carl wove with us better this go around. I like that [[Charlie]] was more the center of our conversation. 
** He only had to say a few words and a couple nods to demonstrate we were on a similar page on his employer. Neat.
* A good drive back with the family.
** With analysis of the dynamics of our conversations.
* Walked with wife
** She believes she has been more upbeat today, and I can see that. That sleep. Still anxious (understandably), but constructive.
** She gave me an extra lap. =)
** Talked with Levi.
*** We need to get together. 
*** He's searching for a job which won't crush his soul. He's thinking about moving to a city as well.
*** His son likes vidya games with his dad.
* Read+Write
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** Matthew is still rough. They've been working hard to take care of him.
** My brother's shutdown is done, onto 10's next week running 3".
* //The Newsroom//
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 5. 
** Holy fuck. Just can't stop, can you.
