title: 2017.06.08 -- Pipefitting Log

Today was a good day. I studied until the break for the exam. Afterwards we took it. I did well, but Chris did not. We then went straight into working on the fabrication. We double-checked our measurements, and everything checked out. We started fitting and welding. It went by quickly enough. I was thankful for that. 

We eventually hit the point where we needed to make our 45's. We had slim pickin's on fittings to make our own. We did the math, and cut it. The protractor did not show the result we wanted. I'm not sure what we did wrong.

The teacher asked me if I had spoken to Randy. I haven't yet. I will once I pass my test.
