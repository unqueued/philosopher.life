!! Audit:

* I appreciate that I've taken the time to write down my sleeping schedule times. This has been useful to me. 
* My wife is arguably better this month, but still not great. 
* I clearly fall asleep easiest with a show to take my mind off the world. If it ain't broke, why fix it?
* It has been a wonderful month for school and getting life together. I can feel myself gathering the courage to jump back into the world.
* Less Fireman Time this month.
* I've been waking up earlier, and I think that is in part due to being able to consistently fall asleep at a reasonsble hour.
* The wiki has continued to be transformed. I am very pleased, even though I didn't accomplish as much as I'd have liked to. 
* We have been making a lot more Mexican food at home. 
* I'm glad to see that my children have been using their time to work more on their wikis. This is excellent. 
* I wish I did more thinking about what my conversations were about like on the 9th. 
* I really do seem to talk most about the drug-like necessities of my life in this log. Sometimes I talk about outliers.
* I need to walk more with my wife.
* DeeSnow dropped off the map. Tis okay.
* Some of my Carpe Diem Logs felt...brief. That's okay. I think sometimes I capture my work elsewhere.
** Remember, of course, that when I'm on the job, I write about it elsewhere. It's fine.
* I actually attended church. 
** I wasn't shaking in anger the entire time, but I can't say it was a pleasant experience.
* Oh yeah, I made the right call on the cryptocurrency crash. Good job!
* I made and fixed some things with my hands this month. I'm really glad that I'm not scared to do that.
* We spent a ton of money this month. 
** We need to tighten down.
* My weight has stopped climbing so hard.
** I still fit my 36" pants, although my 34" are too tight for comfort.
** It is my goal to eat fruits and vegatables for breakfast and lunch.
* We did plenty of computer work this month. I'm glad. 
** I feel like I'm no longer cultivating learned helplessness in my family.
* I like having catalogued our family get together. I don't think I would remember it well otherwise.
* I need to think more about that //Secret Hitler// game and the accompanying Evolution of Trust demonstration/game. 
* It was truly an action-packed month.
