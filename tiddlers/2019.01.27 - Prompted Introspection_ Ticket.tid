title: 2019.01.27 - Prompted Introspection: Ticket

!! Tell about a story when you got a parking ticket or traffic violation.

I was driving back from my job at McDonald's (was a month away from turning 18 and moving away to college). The usual roads were closed, and I had to take a backway. I had a fun car for country backroads. I performed a California Rolling Stop in front of an officer (didn't even seem him, he was hiding quite well in someone's driveway). I received the lecture any teenager would about how that might be cool in Hollywood. Awesome. There was nothing even remotely unsafe about what I had done. I have done unsafe things in a vehicle, but that certainly wasn't one of them. Still, I was fine with the ticket. It was fine justice.
