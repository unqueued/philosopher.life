* [[2018.08.02 -- Prompted Introspection: New Tail]]
** Edited. This one was funny, btw.
* [[2018.08.02 -- Carpe Diem: Busy]]
** I needed to think, even if I didn't have anything to write.
* [[2018.08.02 -- Reddit: Clearcut]]
** Good job. Clean house!
* [[Cranberry Morphemes]]
** This turned out to be something that has bothered me for a very, very long time.
* [[Sir Prasino Keimeno Arkouda of Ingtown]]
** ROFL
* [[L's DND Game Premise]]
** Can't make it look pretty on TW =/
* [[L's DND Character Template]]
** I will make sure to fill this out.

** These are taking longer to write out, and not just because there are more members of these lists.
* [[2018.08.03 -- Daily TDL: Help My Son]]

* [[CATI]]
** Ditto.

** I'm glad to start adding them
* [[2018.08.02 -- Wiki Audit: Crypto]]
** Good job!
* [[Vanity Keys]]
** Silly, but you never know. Having a hard time coming up with GPU options that seem to work nicely for me. Not worth my time though.
* [[Wiki TDL]]
** Perhaps we are a ways away from it, but that's a good thing to try to accomplish later.
* [[2018.08.02 -- Self-Dialectic: Strauss]]
** But, that isn't a bad thing.
* [[j3d1h: Yearly Plan]]
** More to think about.
* [[Tiddlywiki Howto: Embed Youtube Video]]
** Yet, the video I wanted to play isn't allowed to be embedded. =(
* [[2018.08.02 -- BAGD]]
** I'm glad we are doing this. I think it will add up to something.
* [[Work!]]
** Fuck yeah. I wish I could autostart this.
* [[MAYMAYS]]
** I hope this place grows into something truly awesome.
* [[Master-Sign-Slave.py]]
** Btw, I'm going bottom to top in this review...Ditto!
* [[Master-Verify-Slave.py]]
** I'm hoping this just sits here, completely unused.
* [[Argon2-Password-Ed25519-Keygen.xsh]]
** Lowercase? 
** I'm kind of shocked this tool doesn't exist cleanly out in the wild.
* [[Master Ed25519 Public Key]]
** That fuckup was bad...rofl. Welp, shit happens, and this is exactly why I want this tool.
* [[2018.08.02 -- Computer Musings: 25519]]
** I'm glad to have finally done this thing I've been waiting to do for quite a while.
