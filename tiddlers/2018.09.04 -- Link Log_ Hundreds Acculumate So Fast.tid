*** Reign it in, homie.

*** It's clear to me that MacIntyre's non-cognitivism and ontological reframing of virtue into the [[gfwiwcgws]] is being played out here. Walzer's //Spheres of Justice// has something similar going on. As usual, what is the "function" of a human, what is it's flourishing, and when we go OOO, does it flatten? The circularity and contextualism may give rise to relativism unless you ground it against the external principle, [[The Right]]. There's no escaping this problem, folks.
*** The author has no idea how to particularize nor understand the nature of computation. //Intelligibility// (I'M THE REAL SLIM_SHADY ARISTOTELIAN) is at stake here.
** https://epochemagazine.org/thinking-the-political-with-thomas-hobbes-8e09b95284a3
*** I have a Straussian reading of Hobbes. I think he's realpolitik. He was a redpilled artist. I don't think there is apolitical here.
** https://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/orthodox.htm
*** I adore that Marxism is concerned with Praxis. I do not see why dialectical method demonstrated here is correct. Of course, my verbal reasoning is so poor that I'm probably just misunderstanding this language entirely. There are some excellent points in here, but I fear I've missed the thesis (or its support).
*** I guess one of my problems is that I don't understand Hegel, but I feel like I do. On the most fundamental problems, I think Hegel is pointing to something much larger and crucial than Marxism. See my axioms.

*** Philosophers you love.
*** "For Hegel, itâ€™s the conflict between our true self and our social self that creates the pressure driving that history forward."
**** That might be right (something is right about it?), but I'm not sure authenticity and self play out like this. I actually feel like my own sublator as a result of those two (that just is my true self?), but I also feel society is an emergent thing which sublates my identity, consuming it into [[The Grand Dialectic]].
