title: 2017.01.23 - Realpolitik Speculation: TPP

//I believe this is the first tiddler to have sported a [[title.Title]]. Frankly, my naming conventions were excellent considering I didn't use tags. Handcrafted linkage and lists worked really beautifully with this convention, and they still do. [[Realpolitik Speculation]] was the first [[Leet]]ish log-like project on the wiki. Not many projects get their own [[Poetry]], after all. I poured myself into Straussian object, and it gave birth to a number of mechanics on this wiki. I am also indebted to myself for being willing to take the risk of saying things which so many people would find insane. I can hear my voice in here.//

//For the record, I'm completely against IP rights as they are defined by all standard Western legal, political, ethical, academic, and philosophical systems. Intellectual objects should not be treated as objects we can own and prevent others from using for the sake of economic gain (it's hard to unbrainwash people on this topic - a lot of otherwise intelligent people cannot see the forest for the trees here).//

TPP (in its various incarnations) is the South East Asian (SEAsian [I'll call it Seasia]) equivalent of NAFTA at face value. At first glance, TPP seems reasonably justified by US nationalist and capitalist frameworks (but even they have been fooled beyond their normal foolishness). It's a fact that many tech and service jobs would be hit by TPP as badly as NAFTA hit manufacturing (I'm cosmopolitan enough in my theory of justice that I'm not necessarily against it; I care about humans, not merely Americans). Essentially, the US would export large swathes of our tech and service industries to Seasia in exchange for an expanded IP-based (intellectual property) industries penetration of Seasian countries by syncretically injecting and enforcing US IP laws within Seasia's various legal systems. 

IP-based corporations have been unable to make serious progress in Seasia specifically because IP rights are not actually enforced in the region. Of course, lip service and sacrificial lambs are paid, but not an iota more is enforced (it makes sense too, since there is a vast amount of utility to gain from not subjecting their people to IP regimes). By using the US government's power to generate the legal obligations to enforce the kinds of IP rights that exist in the US in other Seasia, IP-based corporations stand to make a ton of money.

We sacrifice our tech (considered by corporations to be absurdly overpaid, hence H1B visas, etc.) and some of the better paying service industry sectors by outsourcing it to other nations in exchange for making our IP-based corporations extremely wealthy. This is supposed to be the trade the American people are thought to be accepting. Supposedly, our IP-industries will flourish (but not the average American, since those jobs will only continue to be outsourced through TPP). Further supposed, IP-based companies will pay taxes on their growth, but it is obvious that they do not pay taxes in the first place. Go ahead and check. These multi-nationals, especially the IP-based, tend to keep their transactions and their wealth outside of the US and its tax policy quite effectively. 

With the outsourcing of our tech jobs, it is obvious that Americans will only be losing at every turn, and it seems that Seasians face a mixed bag (I see short-term gains, but I think it's also bad for them in the long run). IP-rights-holders are the only clear winners here. They will pay people less, have legal powers to maintain their monopolies and control of information, and continue to avoid paying taxes.

It gets worse though. By hijacking the US legal system, the US is being used to enforce the will of IP-based corporations (Tech Giants like Google, Apple, Microsoft, IBM, etc., but also Pharma, Auto, and many more). Essentially, US corporations would have a treaty-based transnational method to enforce their US-like IP rights in Seasia. Problematically, "third-party" arbiters for these transnational legal disputes generated through TPP are controlled primarily (or entirely) by the IP-based US corporations seeking to enforce the US IP regime in Seasia. When the Plaintiff owns all the Judges, guess who always wins? Exactly. 

The fundamental political problem here is that we all assume that legal power in the US is very often equivalent to a significant degree of international legal power, and unfortunately, we have been tricked into thinking TPP will simply increase US power. This is a half truth. So, Seasia is the key to IP rights enforcement (among others) in Asia. TPP is thought to be the foothold the West needs to politically and economically penetrate the Asian giants like China, India, and probably Russia. The goal of the US and Europe is to inject Western legal systems into Asia; i.e. for Western power to spread in Asia. If we convert Seasia, crucial trading partners to China, we will have the bargaining chips to force China's hand to open their markets and legal systems to us. We are made to be afraid of the big bad Asian Tiger. The problem is that it isn't the Western people who are gaining power (assuming that's even a good thing), but that it is the owners of Western IP-based corporations gaining the power.

Ah, so here now we see the scarier Golem emerge: in bootstrapping transnational legal power through the US legal system, these IP-based corporations generate a partial yet significant kind of transnational legal sovereignty. This is the legal transfer of a non-trivial degree of sovereignty from every TPP-signing nation-state to owners of IP-based multi-national corporations largely based in the US. The owners of these corporations become serious wielders of US political, economic, and perhaps indirectly militaristic might; they do so without paying for it and while suffering few, if any, checks-and-balances on their empowerment. Nation-state legal sovereignty is giving way to a new kind of entity in political philosophy which we have not yet effectively named or understood.

TPP exists to make IP-based owners of US corporations incredibly wealthy while generating a [[SO]] kind of internationally politically sovereign entity through the US legal system. This is the continued emergence of the Hyperclass. Our sacrifice will only enrich the multi-national elite, those who are subjects to no sovereign. They are the new international aristocracy. They are eating us from the inside out using our own tools of statecraft against us. 

So, let's be clear. The U.S. sacrifices significant portions of its better paying jobs with no safety nets or educational mobility, falling wages, which is part of the systematic transfer of our wealth to the Hyperclass. The economic power of the people is being squeezed out of them, and it's happening to even the middle and upper classes (only the 1% of the 1% of the 1% are gaining in a winner-take-all economy). Further, Seasia and eventually China and the rest of Asia will bow down to Western legal systems trojan-horsed through IP-rights enforcement enabled by TPP. It is not obvious we will get cheaper products, but even if we did, it is not obvious that the overall loss of income would be worth it (it very much seems not if the past 30 years have shown us anything). Not to mention, the people of Asia will be enslaved to an IP system (a legal regime with no fitting political and moral theory to justify it, as I have argued against elsewhere). The loss of intellectual freedoms, our wealth, and our mobility is frightening. And, this is all done in the name of US power, when it isn't even an increase in democratic Western power in Asia at all, but rather the empowerment of the owners of IP-based US corporations.

This is Trickle-up Economics and the centralization of political power in the hands of people who aren't themselves subject to the rule of law and taxes of various nations. They aren't citizens of any nation. They are beholden to no one. They are thieves of our political rights and wealth. 

Google is widely known to have had Obama's ear. I doubt they own Trump though. It appears Trump did the right act, but for who knows what reason. I am pleased with TPP being off the table. How does this empower, enrich, or help Trump? That's what I want to understand. Is he owned by someone else, and to what degree? I believe Donald Trump is likely going to make a significant amount of money off this (or perhaps pay off a significant number of debts). 

My current guess as to why Trump killed TPP was because China and Russia incentivized the behavior in Trump, since they definitely don't want their trading partners being injected with Western legal systems while handing authority over to IP-owners. This would be bad news for their economies.

So, TPP appears foiled for now. We will see how the Hyperclass will continue to cultivate, centralize, and consolidate their power through Trump. The proletariat class will only continue to become poorer, less-educated, less-powerful, and essentially more enslaved.
