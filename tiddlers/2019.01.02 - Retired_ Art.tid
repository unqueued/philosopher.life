What is art? I don't know. It's like asking what is //logos//? My best guess is the above definition (be they for real or hypothetical experiencers), but even that may be wrong. There are too many plausible definitions in our conceptual analysis. It's definitely a postmodern problem that even the ancients saw, and it seems connected to almost every field in philosophy. The answer isn't simply a moving target embedded in [[The Great Human Conversation]] itself; it defines the very nature of that conversation and beyond. What is essential to art-ness? 

Art can be communicative, representative, expressive, and demonstrate some minimal degree and kind of skill. Art seems instrumentally valuable and perhaps even intrinsically valuable. Art seems to have functional intent but is also subjectively interpretable. Art may be given status by a reflective equilibrium, but even individual subjectivity seems to impart value to art. Art seems to be extremely broad, and line-drawing definitions don't seem to do me much good. Aesthetic Beauty, Being, The Good, and The Right are all fundamental problematics intertwined in philosophy. All the exceptions to definitions of art cause me to draw relationships between these problematics. Art does seem contextualized like "The Good" and "The Right," wherein we must ask "Good for whom?" or "Right given what standard?," thus "Meaning for whom?" or "Art for whom?" are perfectly valid responses.

This is too broad a definition for most people to swallow, but I go where my line-drawing leads me. Artists, by my definition, include damn near everything: house-builders, geometers, painters, wrestlers, inventors, rule-followers, pattern-makers/finders/interpreters, language-users of any type, construction of any type, knowledge-work of any type, etc. Do non-Daseinic beings make art? It seems like it. Not only non-human animals make art, but nature itself. Evolution, agent or not, expresses art all the time to us. Evolution and Being itself may be art. That's how fucking far I'm willing to go here. I'm a skeptic who is willing to accept absurdly maximalist unification definitions of artists and art. Go for it: Art is life. I can't tell you that you're wrong.

I'm not sure what isn't art. Thus, forgive my errors of category, inconsistency, or presumed misuse and dilution of the term. There are legionic reasons for why I this is the art I've chosen to catalogue. What I have here may not be your cup of tea (although, I tend to think it should be included in your consumption and digestion). To those who are willing and able, please enjoy the magnificently high signal-to-noise ratios of my art library; I know I do.

Ultimately, I'm trying to build collections of art for my children to consume and wrestle with. We need shared cultural objects, common languages and points of reference, and a variety of communication tools in order to effectively empathize with each other. Furthermore, I believe my curation practices will help them distinguish braincandy from brainfood, understand the telos of tuning their signal-to-noise ratios, and gives them a massive head-start in searching for meaning.
