title: 2018.12.08 - Prompted Introspection: Regular Dreams

!! What do you dream about on a regular basis?

Why, trying to build utopia, of course, Pinky.

I have kept a [[Dream Log]], and, of course, I must point you to {[[Dreams]]} itself. Even //Dreams://([[Prompted Introspection]]), like all [[Directories|Directory]], is a thing.

My dreams, when I feel like I can remember them at all, are all over the fucking place. I visit places I've been or mashups of them, relive experiences, connect with semblances of people I've met, and run around like a headless chicken in my dreams (or so I remember...I do not trust myself in this regard).

I want to be a lucid dreamer, but the perceptual detail of my dreams are simply never real enough in the first place (or so I think). Sometimes, when I'm about to wake up, I feel like I have the most control over my dreams. Before I fall asleep, that HPPD effect right before I lose consciousness is also something to which I can attend and shape.
