* Stunning!

*** Fascinating claims here. Love the examples.

*** This person is clearly brilliant. I may not agree, but they are very worried about the problem I'm worried about. This entire blog deserves my time.

*** John Oliver pissed me off. He's owned. It's propaganda. He's a neolib brainwasher. He's shown it time and time again.

** https://quillette.com/2018/06/01/whos-afraid-tribalism/
*** Right is not Wrong, and vv. The dialectic may always appear tribal, but it is the truth: psychopaths do not deserve to live as they do.

*** Can't say I agree with the conclusion though...

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.alternet.org/noam-chomsky-explains-exactly-whats-wrong-libertarianism
*** Maybe I am an anarchist on that particular definition. I actually think we can morally (obviously epistemically) justify some kinds of governments, but my standard for justification is really fucking high, beyond the imaginations of many people I fear (I realize just how fucking arrogant that sounds). To me, seeking a moral way to govern ourselves is among the highest of callings; Plato and Aristotle are truly some of my idols.
*** Also, obviously, Preach, yo!

* Think About It
** http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/the-new-machiavelli/
*** Ummm...that's not an argument against it. You fundamentally cannot escape psychological egoism in philosophy, except by axiomatic faith. Explaining altruism will always be a problem. Being moral, literally being a virtuous agent, is a fucking quagmire. Let me grant much of the argument though. I'm glad to see the push back.
** http://www.psypost.org/2018/06/christian-conversion-linked-changes-psychological-symptoms-personal-values-51398
*** I think it's pretty easy to show how Christianity is still a complete failure as a memeplex in a variety of crucial cases. They are pointing to something I can confirm, but I think it gets much worse than they've been able to see.

*** Holy shit, proof that this guy is wholly owned by MS (and they major "owners" of the foundation, not just huge contributors). EEE, folks!

** https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/05/31/does-chinas-digital-police-state-have-echoes-in-the-west
*** Strauss tells me to think about the previous article on this topic from them. This is interesting, but I don't know what it means.
