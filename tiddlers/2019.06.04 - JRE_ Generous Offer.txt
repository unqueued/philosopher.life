Hey, I'll get about 600 extra from overtime this week, you want it to put towards the hospital bill?
TUE 8:01 PM
I appreciate that. Let me see what I can do to get it lowered. Will put us on a payment plan.
TUE 8:02 PM
K, just say the word.
TUE 8:02 PM
Hmm... at some point is trying to contact [[AIR]] just playing into a narrative that we are controlling or manipulative?  I don't have any evidence, but just have this gut feeling that he was advised not to contact us by his therapist.
TUE 8:03 PM
Maybe it's just a hope that someone else convinced him to drop us instead of it being his idea
TUE 8:04 PM
I don't think you are being controlling or manipulative.
TUE 8:06 PM
Will he interpret it that way? I don't know. He's ghosting though.
TUE 8:06 PM
I've stopped reaching out directly. I'll leave him a note on my wiki.
TUE 8:08 PM
I hope he's doing well. This one is not up to me.
