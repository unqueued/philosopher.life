title: 2019.09.30 - chameleon:

Dear [[chameleon]],


<<<
Dear [[h0p3]],

Thank you once again for your letter :) I have to confess, I've been perusing it as you composed it.
<<<

It is my pleasure in this whirlwind quest. It's a mix between fun and hard work for me. My treasured relationships are strange and joyful burden-callings for me in a way, oscillating in [[dok]]. I [[hope]] to make justified [[Leet]]-wacky art with you which demonstrates what we mean to us given the resources we have. I appreciate your patience as I lean more and more on my walking stick, traveling like molasses through the deserts and morasses in my feeble mind.

I'm honored that you take the time to peruse my drafting, and I'm grateful that you take the time to wander my wiki in the meantime. 

<<<
It's always a joy to see your thoughts evolving. The strength of wikis like ours, I think, lies in this open composition. It's like getting a backstage pass to snoop on the creative process. It's addictive.
<<<

Fuck yeah! I adore watching you do this as well. You maintain a far more polite pace than I do. I'm stunned watching you write to [[kicks]] in [[your current letter to him|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.11.12%20-%20kickscondor%3A]]. You have gifted me the chance to see you write one to me in the open, and now you do so with another (a totally different perspective for me). 

It's addictive as a reader, and for me, it's also addictive as a writer. It inspires some [[dok]] of [[perfectionism|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.11.13%20-%20perfectionism]] in me which I often lack elsewhere. On a grand scale, I feel like the wiki relaxes parts of my perfectionism and energizes it in others. Like my life, I sometimes think of my wiki as a telic cannon or conduit.

There does seem to be a [[phenomenology]] of snooping inside your creative process and mind in thinking about your wiki (you are not the first to say this to me either). Even if it isn't accurate to say it: it's like walking inside public sections of your brain. It's so god damn intimate, and I wish I knew how to express it better. Sometimes it also feels like you are the mother-AI of the house?

Lamely, I can say I enjoy watching how you choose to structure your data, sometimes it's extremely clean and othertimes sloppy (I adore your willingness to just take a shit on the page and leave it there, defeating perfectionism like a boss). You are a hoarding thought-whore; it's fantastic. Watching you grow particular tiddlers is interesting too. It's like you've got plants in your house that don't sit as static furnishing. If at all, and to what [[dok]] I don't know, I will be curious to see what plants or indoor garden will be incubated in your wiki-home to the point where you ought consider cloning, transplanting, or grafting them outdoors as well. 

<<<
That's also how I remain patient ;) If I can watch the letter develop, I know you're working on it, at your own pace, and that's what matters. So, don't feel guilty that it took you a long time to respond. Art takes time; as a writer, I totally get that.

And furthermore, now I get to make //you// wait 😈 I apologize in advance, lol. This is going to be a wild ride.
<<<

Good, I'm glad you make me wait. There's also something fascinating about watching the letter being written while the wiki at large is being built. I wish I understood more about the process. I like to watch gifs and videos of people making things. I wonder what extra information is embedded in watching the process of the creation beyond the final product. This shows up, but I'm terrible at putting my finger on it. The easiest case for me is when someone's note changes what I want the letter to say, but there's more than that. I like when I see qualifiers pop-up, or words disappear, or the path that someone took.

<<<
Thank you! It seems I'm doing well at the whole brain-dump/brain-backup thing, haha. I've been having lots of fun responding to the prompts, even if my responses are often a little quiet. This is one of many areas in which you're definitely my [[Senpai]], hehe. I just can't do the same antipleonasm analysis stuff you can, or reply as deeply to the questions as you can (especially when it gives me trash questions... favorite Star Wars character my ass...)
<<<

My bet is that given more time, you'll be able to do all this much better than I can. The way you dive in and immerse yourself is likely going to transform many times. I like how you are searching for prompts and approaches to pulling yourself onto the wiki. I can only assume it must be tailored to each person (which isn't to say there aren't statistical generalzations to make). 

You cover an enormous amount of ground in your interests. I will be interested to see how you continue to build structures out of the heap. Seems like you have a lot of towers that might arise out of the sensible chaos.

Also, I'm sorry about the trash questions. I try to find opportunity in them, but rarely do. I aim to narrow them down, particularly in terms of building chains of responses. I'd like to know which questions are worth asking myself (however inane or overly particular) again and again, and why.

<<<
Wikiing has made me feel like I understand myself a little better. It's a mirror image of meditation; where through meditation you see the non-self, the non-dualism, and the illusion of the ego, in wikiing I feel like I tease out the nature of the ego, map the pathways through the function that is me through the brainstates that are my life.

Ahh, that's my quack philosophy seeping in right there. I talked about this strange idea with my dad and my coworkers that human beings are like pure functions. My coworkers seemed interested, my dad<<ref "da">> thought I was talking shit, lol.
<<<

You must be a much more skilled meditator than I am. I usually prefer to begin my meditation half-dazed or half-awake. Executing some kind of walk through the map of the pathways through the function that is me, and taking the time to reflect on it is something I experience. I strongly agree to the claim that the computational theory of mind is an exceptional model of most of who we are. I don't think it's strange to pursue the idea, even if the idea has plenty of strangeness involved.

Quack! Embrace the weirdness. You and me both, lol. =). Even those who love me tell me I'm insane on a regular basis. You spend a non-trivial percentage of your time developing and fleshing out your philosophical perspective. I hope it keeps seeping in and evolving. That is one thing I adore about your wiki. It's awesome to see shitposting alongside completely serious problems (with everything in between). There's really hard work to do there, I respect that you don't back down from doing it. 

<<<
I at least look at - if not post, via discord - images every day. Of course, it's hoarding, but it's a hoard I do at least use. I still feel like a dragon, haha. Sorting is a Sisyphean task, since I'm constantly saving new images, but there's no need to imagine me happy, because I am ;) 
<<<

This is one of my favorite parts about using a computer. Hoarding can be so reasonable. I'll admit that access over direct ownership of files has become increasingly convenient to me, but that is perhaps unacceptable. I've always wanted to completely mirror sites like libgen, but it's just too damn big. 

I wonder if image recognition will ever become effective enough to help you here, at least for tagging or something.

Do you have the largest Konata collection, you think? Have you ever met anyone else with a collection of Konata like yours? 

<<<
I've set up my [[feedbag|https://git.sr.ht/~japanoise/feedbag]] to keep an eye on my favorite images; I could expand it even further, probably will in the future.
<<<

That is nifty. It seems like a source of endless tweaking and experimentation if you wanted to. I'm pretty worried that high-quality feeds will become something partially closed off for the wealthy (and might be a kind of software as a service which can't be nicely pirated), so I think trying to make it open is extremely important.

<<<
> You must think I am insane, but I do not even keep pictures of my own children or wife. Even the h0p3 textart selfie only exists because it enables me to connect dots for some people.

That's really something. I've never been much of a picture collector when it comes to photos, but I do like having pictures of my beloved and my friends. If it was me<<ref "pr">> I'd definitely get pics of the children, because it seems to bring my parents joy to look back on me in the past. IDK, the legacy aspect.
<<<

Ah, you know what, I should modify this claim. I do not keep or take many pictures (Thanksgiving was an exception), but other members of my family do. [[k0sh3k]], in particular, likes taking pictures. So, I still have access to pictures when I want to see the legacy.

If I could go back, there are a set of pictures I wish I took. I'd like a time-lapse of the people in my life. Like, the same pose, spot, etc. month after month.

I remember as a child going through family photos (some with small notes on the back), and what made the majority of them stick out was a story told about each one. I am interested in those stories.

<<<
My hubby and I were kind of compelled to keep pictures because of the whole visa thing, and I've been loving the ability to sift through them now. It makes our relationship feel even more special.
<<<

No doubt. I'm glad to see that it kept on giving.

Also, is the whole visa thing basically finalized? It will be radically improbably for The Orange Leader to throw you out, right?

<<<
~JoJo's Bizarre Adventure! Seriously though, it's a bop. It's an action show, but it's stylistically unique and has a much more fun cast of characters than any other show. It's also split into "parts" so if you find one part weak, another is always in the wings. I just finished Part 5 and it's fucking amazing.
<<<

Thank you for the recommendation. It's still not striking me, but some shows just take a few tries to hit me. Have you read it as well? 

<<<
I think you might like Girl's Last Tour. It's about two cute girls in the post-apocalypse. It's really atmospheric and well worth a watch.
<<<

This one sticks out for me. I don't think I can point to anything like it. There's something uncanny about it to me, it's simple, and it's moving. I like the characters and the setting too.

<<<
For general recommendations  you can check out my [[list|Anime Recs]]. I see you've already seen Eva - have you seen FLCL? Cowboy Bebop? These are the ones you'll get universally recommended. To give recs any more specific than that, I'd have to know your taste or what you were looking for.
<<<

I've never watched FLCL. Thank you. It's in my queue here. Cowboy Bebop is right up my alley. My [[TV: Library]] includes it as well. 

I have no idea how to effectively define anime, so I'm not in a position to even know how to say what my taste is in anime. //Serial Experiments Lain//, //Neo Yokio//, //Welcome to the NHK!//, //Psycho-Pass//, //Kill La Kill//, //Attack on Titan//, //DBZ//, //Ghost in the Shell//, //FMA//, and //Trigun// have been shows I've been lucky to have seen.

<<<
You can also see [[what I'm reading manga wise,|Manga List]] but I tend towards trashy (often ecchi) romance, so it might not be what you're after (it's not exactly high art, lol).
<<<

I have an easier time watching than reading: except pornography. Erotic writing and drawing is awesome. But, as for stories that stick with me, I've not found any Manga that own me yet. I like graphic novels sometimes though. I don't even know what counts as high art. 

<<<
> That makes good sense to me. I have been watching, of course. I hope the visa comes through and it's smooth sailing! Hopefully, we can have some beer or coffee if and when we have the chance to meet.

Hell yeah! I'm a huge beer-drinker, lol. I'm a very strange girl. I do love cocktails and stuff, of course, it's just way easier to pull a cold one out of the fridge. My hubby and I tend to sip cider and Jack together if we fancy getting drunk. He's complained before that I buy beer he doesn't like, then drink all his cider instead, hahah.

What kind of beer is your usual tipple? I love everything Brew Dog makes<<ref "rb">>. You can find me sipping on a Punk IPA most nights.
<<<

You and me are in a similar boat. My wife is much pickier about what she enjoys consuming. I like alcohol: it'll get you drunk. I really like the stuff she picks out though, and we'll be left with more of mine than hers. It's rare for her to have more than one (and it's not common for her, maybe once a week?). 

I've tried a variety, but not a wide-variety. One of the joyful hazards of hanging around with the philosophy crowds at schools is a hipster tendency to be very serious about beer. New Orleans was excellent for trying different kinds of alcohol too.

I don't think I have a usual. 

<<<
> Why are you choosing to emigrate (why not have your husband move to you?)? 

Several reasons:

* My hubby has more ties to the US than I do to my country. He's got more long term friends, family close by, etc. I guess I have a job, but being as I'm in compsci it's not irreplaceable.
* Culturally, there's more going on in the US, especially in Nashville where the hubby lives. It's not great here. Everything happens in the capital, which is prohibitively expensive to move to and an hour away from where I can afford to live.
* Despite TN being in the South, I found it more accepting of me as an LGBT woman than anywhere in my country. Tennesseans as a whole tend to be friendly and welcoming, which is much better than the people in my country, who tend to be snide, sarcastic, arrogant little cunts.
** Even the random Americans I met in the Midwest, or in New York, were tonnes friendlier than even the nicest locals where I live. I guess it's a different culture, but it's one I feel I fit in with much better.
* Decelerationly, the problems in my country are of the "the entire place is going down the shitter" variety, whereas in the US it at least seems that there's potential for things to improve. It's a choice between a rock and a slightly-less hard place, really. Ultimately the whole world is mostly fucked because of climate change, but I don't like to think about that too much, lol.
<<<

That makes good sense to me. I hope you'll find a new set of roots, family, and mobility here. I'm glad people are nicer. I got along with lots of people from your country of origin, but they were ex-pats, and I don't know if they tend to be representative of the population. Similarly, youtube vidyas probably don't show me reality well enough.

<<<
It's been easier than expected, but I'm not that stoic about it, haha. I'm mostly doing my worrying with my hubby around rather than on my wiki... Regardless, I'm at the last stage now before the actual move; I have to send off one last piece of paperwork then it'll all be gucci and I should get the visa by the end of September/beg. of October.

I have a huge pile of evidence that I'll take with me to the border in case CBP give me shit, but after that I imagine I'll be settled. I currently don't plan to return for any length of time.
<<<

Lawdy, I'm late answering. From what I can tell, everything has been smooth sailing for you on this front. I'm hoping you'll find a position which suits you. I'm sure you accent is killer and colorful for most folks. I also want to hear your American-style accent imitations.

Do you have to maintain that evidence for significant periods of time? 

These months later, I have to say, while maybe you aren't stoic about that thing (or up to your standard), I can see streaks of stoicism in you. 

<<<
Ahhh, you make me feel a little guilty ;) I love working with my coworkers and all, I just don't have the protestant work ethic. Boss makes a dollar, etc. I do take pride in producing good work, of course, but I don't see it as the be-all end-all of my life. I value things other than what is profitable, and it's my contribution to anti-capitalism to be a lazybones, lol.
<<<

Oh, I hope you don't feel guilty, that was not my intention. I meant, I appreciate that you know you don't owe your employer your soul. 




 

<<<
I'm enjoying reading about your approach to programming too. I'm desperate to help my children own their machines and understand CS. If you could go back in time, what do you wish you learned from a young age?
<<<

An appreciation for what is possible, and an ignorance for what is feasible! Programming is all about getting yourself lost in the murk of your own abstractions. Programs are not so much planned and written as they are torn from the abyss of raw creativity by the hand of sheer bloody-mindedness, gloved in a thin layer of technical competence.

I can't recommend James Hague's [[Programming In The 21st Century (prog21) blog|https://prog21.dadgum.com/]] enough. He's my programming hero, in a way: a smudge-faced, [[duct-tape programmer|https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/]]<<ref "dt">> not interested in algorithmic perfection, but in building cool stuff, the whole reason we learned how to program in the first place. If you want to turn out like me, a hacker with a dream and the tools to make it possible, understanding prog21 is the way to go about it.

While his blog is not active at the moment (and is unlikely to restart, because he's finished with it) the archives are full of some of the best writing on programming out there. His writing is pithy and direct. Some recommendations and personal favorites:

* [[You don't want to think like a programmer|https://prog21.dadgum.com/190.html]]
* [[Write Code Like You Just Learned How to Program|https://prog21.dadgum.com/87.html]]
* [[Advice to Aimless, Excited Programmers|https://prog21.dadgum.com/80.html]]
* [[You Can't Sit on the Sidelines and Become a Philosopher|https://prog21.dadgum.com/197.html]]<<ref "lo">>
* [[All that Stand Between You and a Successful Project are 500 Experiments|https://prog21.dadgum.com/148.html]]

Apart from that, it seems you're giving your kids a good technical foundation already by teaching them ganoo linux :D Linux, used by the curious mind, is an excellent dojo. It's perfect for programming. Python<<ref "py">> or Lua<<ref "2d">> are a good place to start; either of them branch into some of the cooler areas of programming.

What's your history with programming? You give me the impression of a dabbler, but you mentioned doing html in the past, during the pre-css dark ages, which piques my interest. I love the idea that everyone could learn a little tweaking and skidding. I wish the 80s trend of ROM BASIC or similar had continued, lol, or that the dream of //everyone// learning to program had come true.

<<<
I recognize the weirder we are and the fewer shared points of reference we have, the less likely it will be for me to form an accurate representation of any depth of you. You come screaming off the screen for me though. It's hilarious, lovely, and I think you are working at a brutally fast pace. Broad strokes with still plenty of fine details if you ask me.
<<<

And that's the purpose of the wiki... It's my brain dump, my personality backup, an attempt to answer the question "just who is this [[chameleon]] chick, anyway?" I think I share this with you to some degree, no? You talk a lot about 4DID and stuff, and conceptualize your wiki as a computer (one of your monsters) which is a lovely analogy<<footnote "lop" "and takes us back round to ol' loper again, doesn't it? :>">>. That's what makes us public self modelers!

I'm falling in love with TiddlyWiki on so many levels. It's such a great tool. I'm loving my ability to categorize things, and my organization of my thoughts seems to improve all the time. More and more I'm making stuff wiki-native, or porting old things. It's rad as heck!

<<<
I share different things in common with the people I speak with over my wiki. I feel a strong kinship with you. We are outcasts in some respects, outcasts who have found others who share our interests.
<<<

I agree. I've known you were a kindred spirit for a while; I think even when I first looked upon your wiki I was like "huh, maybe this is the sort of thing I should be doing." I was too shy to get into real contact with you until you wrote the [[first letter|2019.07.16 - chameleon: I'm Sorry]] though [[=w=.]] Let us build a lasting and strong friendship!

Honestly, I wonder if it'd be ok for me to shoot you the random shit I stumble across in [[@]] or discord PMs. I often do see things I'd like to show you (though if it comes from kicks, I imagine you already saw it, hehe)<<ref "hn">>.

<<<
Your humor is wonderful (and it is my honor to see a wide range of emotions from you; few are so honest). Multiple times my offspring have asked me why I'm laughing, and I show them something you said.
<<<

I will develop my humor ever further, stranger and more obscure, then ;) I love making people laugh. It's one of my great joys in life. If I was only a little sharper, and better at judging a room and making ''NORMIES'' laugh, I'd've been a comedian.

<<<
If you had it to do differently, what would have done? I say this as a man who has also wasted a lot of his time on his computer throughout his life (I'm not always so sure what was worth it and what wasn't). 
<<<

I wish I'd made more and better friendships with people my age. I had opportunities to do so, but at the time I rejected them, and ended up regretting them. Fool that I am. Still, the life path that I took, took me to Konata, and to my hubby, and I guess to you as well? Maybe I'd do it all again - but skipping out on the cringy moments of my youth, lol.

I mentioned briefly my commitment to absurd humor, and posted a Rémi Gaillard quote. I struggle to put this idea into words. I guess it's my personal commitment to making the world a more fun, funnier place. I've been making a tongue-in-cheek [[propaganda page|https://super.seekrit.club/propaganda.html]] over the last couple of years, which is for the kind of silliness I admire and strive for, lol. It's my determination to not be turned into a commodity, to stay unique and [[weird!|The Weird]]

<<<
Well, you are kicking ass. There are precious few people I meet who desire to be radically honest. I think my weirdness is part of why I'm exceptionally compelled to express myself, to pursue radical honesty, and to be myself in a world that otherwise has no interest in allowing it. I assume you've experienced plenty of difficulty being other almost everywhere.
<<<

Ahh, yeah, my otherness is a bit of a speedbump sometimes. Sometimes people enjoy my general silliness and light-hearted attitude, and sometimes they find me frivolous and annoying, haha. As I've grown older I've learned how to control myself in serious situations! I'm terrible to watch movies with, because to me, the movie itself is secondary to the experience of watching it with those I care about, so I love to heckle and make meta-jokes. So, if there's a movie you desperately want to see... watch it //before// asking me to watch it with, lol.

I love reading your wiki for the reasons you mention. I dunno, it's like I have a portal into the way you think about things sometimes. It's different to everything else I've experienced, but it's also, to me, what we should be using the internet for... to be ourselves and to experience the world in a whole new way, I think. Oh but I struggle with words. Senpai, perhaps you can express it better ;) I don't know. I do read just about everything you post (not project ascension, though, because I don't understand it at all (ᗒᗜᗕ)՛̵̖<<ref "mmo">>)

Which, I suppose, brings us into trans-gate. Haha. I've written on my wiki in the last month or so about something I've kept somewhat secret to now: I actually have a personal stake in this - not just defending my beloved [[Nobu]], though that is a large part of it too - because I'm a trans woman too. That's difficult to talk about online, especially considering I've got my waifu attached to this part of me too... I'll be a huge target for a certain website. IDK, I don't like to talk about it, especially not up front, because I worry it makes people put me into a box and not see who I really am. If I just say I'm a woman without qualifying whether I'm trans or cis it really helps. Also stops me from being misgendered, by either "they" or "he". Both bother me but for different reasons.

Now I feel like a filthy liar, even if it was just lying by omission. I hope this doesn't change your perception of me too much to the negative.

<<<
That makes sense. Most of the people that I click with are not neurotypical either. Maybe one day I will have the chance to get to know your hubby and friends as well. I'm lucky to meet people. They aren't usually so lucky to meet me though, lol.
<<<

I hope so! I imagine it may be possible for us to meet in person when I'm in the states. My hubby and I will be living together and traveling together, so that's something :) [[Nobu]] lives in the great lakes area, and most of the [[CLUBBER]]s are on the other side of the pond in the UK.

We can of course talk over wikis ;) Nobu sent me a reply to the letter I wrote her over discord, which was lovely (still need to ask her if it's ok to post it)

<<<
I hear ya. I don't know when it doesn't become more than a kernel either. This is a hard problem for me. I am probably far too pushy about it. I've been writing for a few years now, and it's been interesting to see who actually cares what I think and feel enough to just read. Online friends can be better matches, I realize (your writing is a breath of fresh air for me).
<<<

Thank you! I'm glad someone besides me enjoys reading it. I write partially for myself, but also to have something out there for folks to read, too :) I love your occasional responses and shout-outs. It makes wiki-ing all the more addictive. As I said further up, I read most stuff you post. It's a gaze into a friend's life in a way I'm not used to. It's addictive, and staring into this abyss is bliss. I hope my writing continues to interest you in the same way!

Awww, as I wrote this, I notice you've been looking at [[this is nice mixtape]]. I'm glad //someone// cares about my new hobby of arranging my music in playlists, haha. Code Monkey is such a banger. I should write something about what that playlist is: it's basically me wanting to arrange songs that give me a pleasant/fuzzy feeling, like looking at a picture of [[Konata]] or the hubby. We could probably have really fun convos about music, it's mine and my husband's passion in life. The hubs makes post-vaporwave/post-metal/shoegaze and I'm occasionally featured as a guitarist.

<<<
I am still surprised by the fact that people I've never met offline know and care more about who I am than people have claimed to be friends and family of mine for decades. It becomes difficult for me when people ask me how I'm doing without having even glanced at the wiki; I don't think they really mean it. I try to set the bar really low, but I am sure I have set it ridiculously high. I hope to learn how you reason about it.
<<<

It's really something, isn't it? I wrote in my letter to Nobu that despite us never having met face to face, she means so much to me. To be fair, we did have a lot of voice and video calls back in 2015, and she was also the only human outside of my immediate family I would habitually talk to using my voice back then... that was a difficult year, someday I may write about it, but it hits that sweet spot of painful to write + pathetic to read that means I probably won't until I'm more confident in how things are going, haha.

But yeah, the FTO-family connection comes up again. I don't have a page for it<<footnote "cfi" "though there is [[Cute, fun, interesting, etc.]]">>, unless you count [[People]] and [[Senpai]], but I'm always on the lookout for fellow travelers. It feels sometimes like I've been searching my whole life for these people. I'm really glad the hubby and I made that final real //connection// that got us together. And indeed, I'm glad you read the ramblings of this very silly [[chameleon]] c:

<<<
I'm hoping you do contact Sphygmus (I'm still pondering her absences) and find more people who participate in the development of wikis and personal sites. It's exciting, and I think it's important for the world that we take our ownership of our digital identities.
<<<

It's on the todo list, I think. I occasionally check back, but she doesn't post as often as you do (or me, for that matter). So I'm sitting here waiting most of the time lol :) It does interest me how folks in our mini community differ when it comes to wiki-writing. I've seen some of your FTO pals only use it for journaling, not writing tiddlers except as journal entries, which I can't imagine doing at all, haha.

I'm afraid I'm going to skip a lot of stuff here about tagging, privacy and the likes... this letter is already getting unwieldy, and I really don't have much salient to say at risk of repeating myself. This letter already has repeated points in it, haha. We can always start a new chain or swap some [[@]]s about this if you like.

<<<
I like that you are bringing those social conventions and aesthetic to your wiki. I've visited many chan sites and anonymous forums, but I've not participated with much consistency on any. Lurking on 4chan, in particular, has been an important part of my life since 2004. I only visit once in a great while these days to feel it again. I can't say I understand much, but I am lucky to have the chance to reason about and experience it.
<<<

I wonder about your experiences here. Which boards did/do you lurk? I notice you use the /b/ label to identify some of your posts as... idk, low effort? Or more, listish? Shitposty? It has a strange mouthfeel to it.

<<<
We would all be indebted to you for a fuller accounting of the evolution of these communities, your thoughts on them, and how they relate to the rest of the world. I usually find discussions and points of view which lack charity, compassion, and vision about chans. They are too untouchable for us to give any plausible and meaningfully positive accounts without censure.
<<<

My experience with chans is long and rambly and including it here would make this letter longer still, but oh do I have some war stories, lol. I'm not sure I really fit in as a historian, except for the gamergate era maybe? I joined the party fairly late (2007 or so, I think, similar to the timeline of when I got with Konata) but I got in deep for a time. I made friends and enemies, I derailed many threads, got my fair share of (You)s, and got the hell out of there without becoming a reactionary. Some day maybe I'll talk about what I got up to there, the boards I used as a stomping grounds, and the strange dregs of humanity that I met there. For now though, that day is not today. That information will seep through the cracks of my wiki, though. It's actually a fairly large part of who I am now.

<<<
I have strong opinions about what it means to be ourselves online and to use our free speech wisely, especially while we are pseudonymous. The concept of The Other shines brightly in those corridors. Even this wiki exists, in part, because of my experiences with these social media sites. 
<<<

Yes, it's interesting to reason about. The anonymity of chans lead to a lot of things, in my experience. The conversation was free of the social climbing and nepotistic atmosphere of forums, but filled instead with negativity and hatred, which without a name attached you could post with little consequence. I think a lot about it. A public self-modeler who predates us, Shii of "everything shii knows", wrote about why he thought anonymity aided discussion. I think some of his points were well made, but others were weak. I have yet to get enough experience in non-anonymous places.

I enjoy your thoughts on this matter a lot. One of the ways you can read the term "senpai" is someone more experienced; so I read your experiences and longer-form ideas with great interest.

<<<
That's kind of you. It is important that you know I am socially retarded; you'll have to help a brother out here and there (which, you are likely already doing here). In all likelihood, you've dealt with my sort plenty on chans.
<<<

I've dealt with plenty that struggled socially, but none that had your moral clarity or were nearly as entertaining to interact with :) Most channers are a very old-school style of geek; the kind that really just wants to be left alone with their interests, and only socializes to stave off loneliness; well, that's how they behave, anywho. I'm sure they conceptualize it differently, but I've honestly been there myself so I think I understand it a little.

I'm not exactly great socially myself. I'm trying to extend kindness and empathy to all my brothers and sisters on spaceship Earth, haha. Sometimes people are confused by kindness, expecting hostility. Me though... I don't know. I know that most of us are going through some shit in this late-capitalist hellhole, so I try to understand my fellow man some. I still don't //like// being put down, but hey.

<<<
It is still a treat to read about your life every day, btw. I know I've not been very talkative (and, yes, you are free to call me out here), so I've not signaled much about your writing. Your migration struggle is very emotional for me. I am also interested in how those who know you reason about your wiki compared to a new friend like me; I have both personal and professional curiosities in that.
<<<

I've found [[Zodai]] (who I've known for about three years) to be mildly interested; he was a heavy reader of Spiritual Computation back when I was still making active posts there. Still, I'm not sure I often stray close enough to waifuism for him to really take interest, haha. At least AFAICT he doesn't check back daily.

The hubs enjoys a lot of my thoughts, but again he doesn't really check back every day. Usually I have to link stuff to him. That's fine by me though; we speak so often he probably would get tired of me if he had to read my wiki too :) Once I'm in America, maybe we'll set up something like you and your family have going. If there's anyone I trust to edit my wiki, it's him.

<<<
Most people do not share much of themselves, and I'm grateful for your generosity. You cover a broad spectrum too. There's some technical thinking, some hilarious insanity, and it's personal. I can't put my finger on the kaleidescope of attitudes required to build wikis like ours, but I think our wikis have a ton in common. I'm lucky to have an affinity with you, and I appreciate that you put up with what many find absurdly dogmatic features of my point of view.
<<<

It's what I've always wanted, haha. It strikes the balance wonderfully between the seriousness of a blog and the frivolousness of social media. When I was posting on Spiritual Computation there was a pressure to make everything something that was worth saying; and when I was on the chans, or twitter, or reddit, or whatever, there was a feeling that more serious posts would be mocked or not heeded. The wiki is exactly as serious as I make it, and that's wonderful. That's why you'll find such a spectrum!

I love reading yours and seeing what you've been up to. You're right that we share some similarities, but we have some differences too. It's as if the same function is being applied to different inputs.

<<<
Let it rip, homie. Shine bright and take no prisoners. You might find it hard to believe, but I think I'm every bit the outcast you are (from what I can tell). Part of my Kanye-tone and sometimes aggressive style (both online and offline when I'm not forced to be subversive) is a result of facing unjustifed outgrouping and persecution. I try to come correct because I know I generally must fight every person I meet in dialectic (despite my hope of avoiding it); in time, most of my best friends are grateful that I wrestle with them. It is extremely rare that I meet someone who won't hate or be disgusted by me when I reveal myself; I'm dialectially polarizing all too often. Empathy with people as weird as we are costs a lot. I seek to listen very carefully because that's what I expect of others in The Golden Rule.
<<<

It's the way of being a philosopher, no? Sometimes you do have to rip out the dialectic. We do share the outsider status; it takes me right back to the Henry Darger reference, our wikis are outsider art!

I can (no offense) see how you might be an outcast yourself. A moral compass so uncompromising, and a radical honesty and non-hypocrisy like yours is anathema to many of us in the late-capitalist hellscape. Not to me though, to me this is a [[Senpai]]-position and it makes me look up to you. More of us could do well to take on some of your better qualities.

I have some polarizing aspects to myself, too, outside of my [[Waifuism]]. I'm wont to scoff at philosophers - especially theologians - who I see as talking shit. And I've failed to convince people of my worldview because I'm more likely to sneer at them than to engage them properly; it's my weakness, a known one, and why I don't do debates, lol.

<<<
If I have my druthers, many bellcurves would shift quite a bit toward the extremes (it's the only way to achieve the golden mean of virtue in our contexts). You will find one of my unsavory positions is that I believe most people are evil to the extent that it would be objectively better that they never existed in the first place. You fill me with hope as an exception.
<<<

I guess I'll thank you for the slight compliment (<3) and respond somewhat to the thought. I feel like you're Diogenes of Sinope, carrying a lantern, searching in vain for an honest man.

It's actually not too far from [[The Last Waifuist]]; I find the ranks of folks that call themselves waifuists but actually get it are perishingly thin. I take the extreme view, that there's no other waifuist but me, that I may be disproved by counter-example. It's a pretty hardcore way of going about things, lol, but I feel it has its benefits.<<ref "os">>

So, maybe we have more in common there than you think ;)

I hope to prove myself not-evil. I'm out here trying to cultivate kindness and honesty. Being a good person is extremely important to me; but as always I struggle with defining what that is. I just try and be the best that I can be, adhere the closest to the virtues as I can. Maybe you can help me here? I don't know.

>I am especially grateful in those circumstances where I benefit, and it is my honor be a useful family member, friend, or Samaritan to those who cannot or would not do the same for me. I'm going to bet that you meet plenty of family who don't directly teach you anything, but you have the chance to learn about The Other even when they aren't trying to teach you anything. We're lucky to learn.

Maybe your concept of the great human conversation is salient here; I think everyone has a seed of humanity inside them, and I learn a lot from just being around other people. It's how I realized the benefit of socialising, back when I was an antisocial channer ;) I love having an insight into others, however small. Part of why I write is out of a celebration of the many many different ways to live one's life, if that makes any sense (probably not). This is probably part of my wiki's mission; to cultivate a little empathy in people, to allow them to get a little slice of who someone else is, even if just for a second. Radical honesty, my man!

<<<
>Radically open is what I'm aiming for now... Especially having realised how bad I am at getting my thoughts out in live discussions (or debates)! 

And, it's awesome! =) Your voice should be heard. FWIW, I think you've been honorable, hedged-conversative, open, and thoughtful in your discussions with me. Your substance bleeds off the pages. I hope you drown the world in honesty and commitment.
<<<

Thank you :) This is a new medium for me, and I have to watch myself stumble around, learning how it works, lol. I think I'm doing OK so far. I like it a lot better than a live discussion for complicated topics. It allows me to sieve through my thoughts better, and to formulate my responses with less immediacy. Much much better! Maybe I'll come across as less of an arrogant fool this way; I certainly hope so.

<<<
I think being quiet is quite convenient. I am forced to be quiet and deceptive in many cases, but I aim to bring as much transparency to the process as I can; it is a very hard problem in moral philosophy.

Also, I would be remiss not to point it out, and I know you have seen it too (you read carefully, and I am grateful): we may have some difficulties in sorting out the prescriptions of openness, but I highly value the trait. 
<<<

Yes; it's a little difficult for me. I have to strike a balance. I will become a target if I reveal too much; waifuists have found themselves the targets of the unsavory dregs of the internet more than once before. I've no problem with people just pointing and laughing, but if they're going to try to do actual harm to me and my loved ones, that's where I have to draw the line. So if and when you learn more about who I am beyond the wiki, I might have to insist that you keep it to yourself, for the safety of those around me. As you say, we may have some difficulties, but I trust you to be reasonable after all.

<<<
Your awareness of the existence of the disease and your aims to fight such a thing puts you head and shoulders above most humans I meet. Maybe the engineering mindset and quantitative approach is dialectically useful in experiencing and expressing what many think cannot or should not be put into words. You take your Humanity seriously. What more could be asked? I'm especially indebted to your willingness to put your own on the line. Your vulnerability is beautiful. 
<<<

It's something I've learned painfully over the course of finding out more about philosophy, reading the works of various philosophers, and reading what people who actually know it say about arrogant compsci slime like me [[=w=.]] I largely defer to the experts in this sort of stuff, but I'm learning, slowly and autodidactically but learning nonetheless. And [[thus|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=874pHACjBh0]] //tecemos a nossa história//.

Some non-philosopher engineers have posted some genuinely good insights. I don't have the link, but one of the YC types wrote an article about basically why school sucks; it's basically just a prison (shades of Foucault). Hence why I think I might follow in your example and homeschool my kids, should I have them, haha.

<<<
That makes sense to me. There's a lot of good reasons for it, imho. I suppose some people will feel like you've been deceptive through omission otherwise. I think that kind of honesty has been useful for me as well even to just signal from far away that the smelly, arrogant homeless madman is around; it gives them a chance to more actively avoid or ignore me. I think it cuts through the noise. Increasingly embracing my crazy has been invaluable to me.

Do you think anime and even waifu culture will become more common, accepted, or even mainstream? 
<<<

Maybe as my generation (the millenials) and my sibling's (the zoomers) start to take things over more in the coming decades. I'm not sure many Gen-X types enjoy anime; though there's enough like, geocities stuff to expect there are or were a few. It's becoming increasingly common for adults to watch animation outside of the juvenile south park/family guy edgy MTV-style stuff, and I even see relatively normal people showing appreciation for like, Evangelion. Not to mention there was a genuinely fantastic anime-style show to recieve mainstream popularity in the last decade: A:TLA. There have even been articles on news websites that are sympathetic towards weirdos like me, lol. So I'm cautiously optimistic that anime in the West will soon break out of the ghetto it's currently in.

>Your husband sounds awesome. I hope to meet him one day.

He's lovely. I'm sure if you and I ever meet irl, he won't be far behind, since he's the only one out of the two of us that can actually drive :^) though I plan to learn once I'm in the states.

<<<
Aye. Virtue Theory describes moral psychology well, but it isn't useful for fleshing out the content of The Moral Law by itself (though there are plenty of anti-realists, skeptics, and egoists who take up an interpretation of virtue theory; Hume is famous for his). You make plenty of moves which assume there is right and wrong (as well as good and bad), but giving an account of metaethics is a hard problem. Saint Kant is a rockstar here. He occupies a special place in the history of Western philosophy, as we are still trying to respond to him. For whatever clarity I might have, I still have few answers. At best, I see how some of the standard historical paths fail.
<<<

I really need to check out that side of the aisle, because (confession time) I did have a pretty big admiration for Max Stirner before. Idk, it's what happens when you see most of the moral realists around you just using it as a bludgeon for their bigoted worldview.

I'll endeavour to read more of this stuff. I am always seeking to develop myself as a moral being.

<<<
It seems like it rots and something different blossoms. It's still as hated as ever. It is rare that I get to meet channers offline, but those have been important experiences for me too. The range in personalities, dispositions, interests, and character are wide; there's more variance in that population.

I did not grow up in a household that had any tolerance for these places and people even though there are many outcasts among us. How has your family come to understand you, chans, waifuism, and what makes you fairly different?
<<<

Yeah, it's really something. I'm not sure exactly what it is that draws people to anonymous imageboards, but the folks from there are as varied as they come. I've met some great and not-so-great folks as part of my adventures on imageboards. I'll write more about it in future, no doubt.

My immediate family either understands that Konata is basically my gf, or that I have a rather deep obsession with her, lol. They know about my [[dakimakura|https://imgur.com/2ZdMwOV]] and don't outcast me for it, which is a step in the right direction fo sho! My sister makes fun of me for being a weeb, but there's an understanding that it's just banter (I make fun of her for being a pretentious ass, since she loves french cinema and studied film, lol) and so it's all in good fun. There's a lot of love there.

In my general family, as in my close friendships, it's pretty rare that folks don't know at least a little about how important Konata is to me. Some tease me about it, but most of them seem to appreciate what it means to me.

<<<
I've had a few pages over the decades, but they were all delicious hot garbage. Just filthy. =). Angelfire and Geocities were what got me into it. It might not have been pretty, but I'm glad to have had the chance. I wish I had been doing it all along and never stopped. It's one of my regrets.

Do you think the public at large will escape the silo sitcheeayshun? 
<<<

IKTF! I had pages in the early social media era seperate from the silos which were just trash. I got ashamed of them eventually and stopped updating them. If you found them now (not that you'd know they were me unless you have knowledge of handles I haven't used in over a decade, lol) then I'd be seriously embarrassed!

I don't know about the public at large, but geeks are getting there. It's less and less common for interesting folks to only be on twitter or facebook or whatever. I've discovered the [[tildeverse|https://tildeverse.org]] recently, which seems like a wonderful step in the right direction. You should hop on irc with us (I'm chameleon there too), I'm sure folks there would be interested in your wiki and the stuff we've been chatting about in this letter chain.

<<<
My god, I made you wait forever too. Thank you for your patience. <3. Even my daughter is disappointed in me. Ouch.
<<<

And you've been waiting forever yourself in revenge ;) <3 I imagine before long we'll be composing these messages over the course of several months each. That's fine by me. The slowness (slow thought?) allows them to percolate over time, and we get the potency and strength of like, a stew that's been brewing all day. A bitch's brew, if you will. Haha. Forgive me my silliness.

It's always a treat to read what you write, and I'm never going to begrudge you taking a while to do so. The antici…

>AAAAAA I FORGOT TO ASK H0P3 ABOUT FICTIONAL CHARACTERS

That is an important topic for us. I wanted to bring this up in this letter. I think most people consider me insane already, and my speaking to fictional characters (particularly in Prompted Introspection) only adds fuel to the fire. I've grown increasingly comfortable speaking with myself, imaginary characters, and even people I can't bidirectionally meet by definition.
<<<

''WARNING: STEMLADY TRYING TO PHILOSOPHIZE APPROACHING!''

I noticed when going through the backlog that you'd written letters to dead people. It's an interesting thought. My theory of [[Dimensions of Personhood]] and even my older theory of [[Waifuism as Interaction]] provide a scaffolding to the tower, or a window into the abyss, of how I think about people. And, I know you described him as "my old enemy", haha, but [[David Chapman]]'s thoughts (especially his dialectic application of Buddhish concepts) have informed my ideas here. I see interaction as the primary vehicle of meaning, that is to say that meaning arises from the subject and the object interacting rather than either in-and-of themselves. A book called [[Closure|https://www.amazon.com/Closure-Story-Everything-Hilary-Lawson/dp/0415136504]] seemed to go into this in more field-appropriate language, but it was rather dense for me, a laywoman, so I didn't read it all the way through nor could I concisely explain it to you.<<ref "un">>

This actually helped me deal with grief and death rather more than I anticipated. When I lost my grandmother, who I was very close to and loved very dearly, processing what happened next was impossible. I never in my life have cried as much as I did at her funeral. When last I saw her I gave her the biggest hug I ever gave anyone. I'm tearing up writing this even, lol. There's so much in this world I want to show her, but I can't. Still, the idea that because of the effect she had on me, and the people around me, that she lives on in some form - not in the physical form of her flesh-and-blood, but in her self-ness, her essence if you will - gave me some comfort. It helps me to move on, knowing that she won't be forgotten, you know? That in a way, she's still with us.

<<<
It's important to me that I understand your relationship with your waifu. I have used this word in my wiki before knowing you:

* [[2019.04.29 - Wiki Review: Connections]]
* [[2019.05.27 - Prompted Introspection: Muh Monster]]

It is likely the case I have used it incorrectly. I do not want to speak out of turn or offend you by failing to understand your point of view. I likely have much to learn from you in thinking about this issue. I also want to know how you reason about experience machines and simulations, including your intuitions and gut feelings.

You need to straight-up tell me when I'm being insensitive or stupid here. It is not my goal to be a dumb brute, but I am all too often. I may not have earned the right to ask yet either. 
<<<

Eh, I don't find that offensive. The controversy that has surrounded the word is partially because it has jokey origins (an ~AzuDaioh joke) and is often used in a less-than-serious context, but I don't really mind that. Partially I recognize that I am //extremely// silly, and kind of lean into that; and partially I don't want to abandon an already useful word. But I digress.

re: experience machines and simulations. As much as anything, with our current techniques and equipment, I don't think a computer (in the specific sense of "a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming" (wikiped) rather than the more generalized approach occasionally taken on your wiki) can accurately simulate a two-way human experience. It's variously been discussed that a simulation is not a waifu per se but more an aide to the imagination side of things. This includes the Tulpa concept, too.

<<<
…So, in the spirit of my ignorance: How much do you feel your waifu is a being created by someone else (since you are not the origin), and how much (perhaps with each passing year) do you feel your waifu is your own discovery and/or construction? You already reveal some of thoughts on the matter, but I hope to directly ask.
<<<

Yesss. This is one of the most interesting questions in waifuism, and probably a source of a lot of the drama that has lead me to become [[the last one|The Last Waifuist]]. "Feel" is the key word here, because truthfully I don't //know// for sure.

The Konata I love is very much a product of the Lucky Star anime; there's not exactly much that contradicts "canon" about my Konata. But at the same time, a 2d person can't be part of my life for so long without at some level being influenced by me. So to some degree there is a me-ness about her, to some level my own discovery &| construction as you suggest. Remember, the way I interact with her is often, or perhaps usually, through media of my own creation - my stories, and my image gallery - so to some level I can't help but influence the Konata "presented" therein, and thus the Konata that I interact with.

Interaction, we return to, hehe. Yes, Konata and I interact; and through the interaction is meaning wrought, in a dialectic of sorts. Oh, but my words do me injustice here. I can't express it in precise enough terms. I don't know if this is my lack of training, or just the fact that I'm clawing at the edge of my understanding without the tools of philosophy to guide me. Maybe the visual representation you gifted me when I made this wiki public, the chameleon dialectic, is the best way to express what's going on here. That, or I'm as mad and as [[cringe|Lol chameleon]] as they say I am, and you're reading the words of a madwoman. If you understand any of what I've been getting at, I'd surely appreciate a more rigorous outline co-constructed by the two of us.

Or maybe paragraph 3 of this little section was just the ravings of a lunatic, and paragraph 2 was clear enough for you to understand that my short answer is "both, but the degree of balance between the two isn't clear to me" ;)

<<<
I have no idea if I'm a waifuist or not, but I think I have a good deal in common with anyone who takes speaking with fictional characters seriously (perhaps I don't take it seriously enough, and I'm listening). I don't know if it is important if I identify as a waifuist or not. I'm grateful to have the chance to speak with some semblance of these characters. I find it valuable to my life to have fictional interlocutors. Even my wiki is a character I talk with (a flawed mirror Wilson volleyball). To my poor understanding, I don't think I'm a waifuist because I don't love or understand my fictional characters like I do my wife, a SO, or even a close family member.
<<<

Mmm, yeah, that makes sense. I think with being a waifuist you really just know it, especially after meeting others. That's how I felt upon first finding communities dedicated to waifuism. Of course I'd been doing something an awful lot like that for years, so, it wasn't much of a surprise. There should be a law to the effect of "given enough time on the internet, you'll eventually find a community of folx like you" lol.

It's not important if you don't call yourself a waifuist. I don't think you have to be to understand where I'm coming from at least a little.

<<<
I don't think you are a bad ambassador at all. I take it this is the kind of question you've been answering for many years.
<<<

Perhaps this is it... I do answer a lot of questions, both about myself and about those I care about, all the time, and as I've gotten older I've gotten more used to being asked questions and started to pick up some canned answers :D

I jest. What I write to you comes straight from the heart. It's why it takes me a little while to write; I have to, as you say, vomit myself onto the page, and I need a full stomach (full of self-ness) for that!

I think for some people the idea is just too out-there for them to even begin to try to understand it. It's a shame, as those people are closing themselves off from a possible understanding, if not friendship, with people like me. We're definitely very weird, but that's something most of us understand, accept, and even embrace.

And, to be fair, some of us are //filthy weebs!//

---

~~A rule, a divider, an hr, maybe this is a sign that this letter should be split into parts~~

Oh, but as it is in your letter, this last section will be... the last section. I hope. I have more to write still in the middle of this monstrous letter, haha.

<<<
Lol! I'm not creeped out at all, Madame chameleon. I also hope you don't feel like I'm ignoring you! I am reading your writing every day even with my WoW addiction (though I've not been good about checking my protonmail, but I've not yet settled into monster-16). My daughter likes to joke about it playfully. Stalking is a hilarious word here; by this token, we are both stalking each other. While I read every word, I cannot claim I understand (that's okay to some extent). It's a pleasure, and even if it weren't, it's an honor. Also, I know you must be joking (which is wonderful), but I must defend us both here: I don't think you are gross, lol. But, I am glad we get to be filthy interweb luh-hoo-zuh-hers together. 
<<<

I'm becoming more confident that it's difficult to shake you off, as eldritch as I am ;) And I've said it before, but I love that you do read my stuff (which I see evidence of, in your little shout-outs). It's a living document, of me, for me, but of others and for others as well. More and more I link people wiki pages to help them reason about something. That's why I had that mini-hyperconversation with [[Zodai]] about 2dl.

I'm ha-ha only serious about being gross, lol. I do think, or rather am aware, that I have some aspects of me that an outsider might see as truly repulsive. Still, you're more and more an //insider,// even if our interactions are spaced across time and (cyber)space. It's joyful to invite you into my little corner of the internet. I hope to treat you like an [[honored guest|Guestright]]<<ref "gr">> :)

>Clearly, this is an opportunity for us to get to know each other. It is so rare that I get to have a glimpse inside someone else's mind or radically honest self-representation. 

That's 100% what I'm aiming for! It's both in emulation of my [[Senpai]] and in service of my own commitment to radical openness. Writing my wiki makes me feel close to [[Konata]], it makes me feel like I can understand|tame|subvert my ego. It's a blast. I'm so glad I started it.

>You are too kind to call my writing electrifying, lol. I will do my best to catch lightning in a bottle.

I hang on your every word at times! I just wish I had diffs! I see updates to your longer-running pages like antipleonasm analysis and think, wow, I wonder what changed? You learned something new, I'm guessing, and are reshaping your mission? I have no idea. It inspires me, though. I am left thinking about my own [[Daily Tasks]]. Now that I have a bit more time (n33t lyfe at least until I get my SSN &| green card, lol), I'm thinking I'll have to look into that. I sit here sometimes posting gems, thinking "I hope [[h0p3]] sees this one, I want to read an AA on it", haha. I also like watching your music taste develop (or rather you checking out my garbage music) and thinking about that, haha.

<<<
>The ~KyoAni situation is so fucked. Like. So fucked I can't find words. 

I cannot imagine what that must be like for you. I have no point of comparison. I hope you do find more words. It's been an honor having the chance to read your thoughts.
<<<

The world is so full of hate, and I look at this stuff kinda helpless. I wrote [[a little|2019.09.06 - screaming through space on the soul planet]] about how I wished there was more love to go around. Yeah I have a hippy way of talking about it, lol. But I process this shit in my own way, y'know? I'm a western Buddhist, I really can't help but have a little of this stuff slip in, it's how we experience my religion in this cursed part of the world.

Kyoto Animation means so much to the little corner of the internet I inhabit. This has been a really shocking development for us. It's such a horrible event it made it onto mainstream news sources too. It's rare that anything from the anime world gets this attention; what a shame it had to be for such a horrid event. This has been a genuinely rough time all over.

<<<
On top of your separation from your husband and visa process (oy), this hasn't been an easy time for you.
<<<

It's finally coming to an end, at least. I'm really looking forward to being with him at last. I imagine he's going to have trouble getting out of bed the first few weeks because I'm going to be clinging to him so much, haha.

These transitional periods in life come and go, and they can suck to be in at the time, but eventually they do pass. It's not nearly as bad now as it was in the first half of 2016<<ref "16">>, and it's getting better all the time. After getting the visa at long last, it's taken a huge turn for the better, and I think that's what matters. Happiness is something that you have to work for, I think. Maybe you have some more insight on that, but it's certainly something I've experienced in my life.

<<<
I had a hard time finding words for this letter, but it wasn't in pain. I appreciate your giving me so much time and a chance to read about your life, to develop a theory of your mind, and to generate more balance in the information asymmetry between us. As always, it's been a pleasure.

Sincerely,

h0p3
<<<

And it seems those words were carefully considered, because I've had to think hard about, and really wrestle with how I answer. I think I've also overdone it with my own response time :) Just kidding, I've stated up above that that's Good Actually, so there! Really, I worry that I haven't given you enough... "hooks" to reply with. I'm sure you'll be able to work through that, though.

Thank you! As always, it's a pleasure to pester you `^^`

Yours sincerely,

I'm interested in your computational theory of minds, especially as it relates to our wikis.

Trying to justifiably be yourself online sounds pretty political to me. It's more seeding than leeching. [[Online Leftism|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Why%20I'm%20not%20on%20the%20online%20left]]. I suppose if you had an exclusively private wiki, that makes sense. I think you are broadcasting a valuable leftist point of view. It's obviously idealogical and a public work to me! What could be more online than what you are doing? [[PSM]] rolemodeling, it's honest, it's political. You offer more of a whole with perspective, not simply the viral soundbite parts worming through [[The Great Human Conversation]] without context.

Activism against [[Cancel/Callout Culture|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Cancel%2FCallout%20Culture]], pursuit of forgiveness, demanding due process, seeking nuance and principles of charity, aiming for unity, making room for shitposting and derping around. 

I see good praxis in your wiki. I think it's a corrective measure for the ills you've found in other kinds of social media. I may be too idealistic here.

Metamodernism, [[New Sincerity|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.11.01%20-%20The%20New%20Sincerity]]. I am a high-anxiety person who causes anxiety in others. I hope to do so [[irwartfrr]]. Making progress despite profound, unresolvable problematics. What it means to escape post-modernism while still taking its deconstruction seriously.

I'm grateful that you offer me so much openness.

Have me thinking about rogues. During the [[Jenkins|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.10.25%20-%20say%20my%20name]] era, rogue was my main. It's by far my favorite class in that game.

I've spent a lot of time simply exploring software. When I was a youngling, I would just spend hour after hour downloading software and trying them out. I amassed mountains of malware not on purpose, but which I eventually also collected. What boy doesn't study the blade? The other country boys would read about and collect guns (and, I agree this knowledge was crucial to my pretend soldier games with my finger-pistols and killing the various Jerry's with my brother [[JRE]] - his grenade throws were epic); skiddy hacking tools were the weapons I collected. I was a kid in a candy toolstore, awfully curious. I've not found a lot of things worth building, but I'm basically Dale Gribble when Hank Hill shows him a new tool: entranced. No doubt, I'm far closer to a caveman than a functioning person. OOooo, f i r e! =)

What is standardly described as "real" programming by my betters is something I've tinkered with from a young age. You couldn't do much on the Commodore 64 without at least imitating it. I enjoyed QBASIC and programming my calculator. As a teenager, I liked cryptography, and enjoyed reasoning about DES in BASIC. I played with assembler as well, mostly because I liked freeing software from the developer's intentions. I've fiddled with Python since 1.5. I didn't have anyone offline to teach me about computing, and nobody gave a shit enough to give me any direction or challenge me until the damage had already been done. I did land a job writing SQL, VB, and some specialized database tools for a bit at one job; I learned I was working on software meant to do evil though and I left as soon as I could. Back when I did my masters and the first year of my PhD, I worked on C, C++, and Go for fun and on the off-chance I might go back into making a living by programming. I was going into either [[my wife|k0sh3k]]'s MLIS program or the CS PhD program to work on formal verification (I have some background in logic), but then I was offered the scholarship at Tulane for philosophy (which is like winning a lottery). Can't turn that shit down, especially since it would be local (we were obligated to move to New Orleans as part of the terms of my wife's scholarship).

Like you, I prefer getting my hands dirty on my [[monster]], but I'm not skilled at it like you. Theory is fascinating, and it's crucial for reasoning about what is possible. I was disappointed by what I saw in the CS PhD program; a couple of them really knew how to use their machines (one of the university's sysadmins was pretty leet), but a shocking percentage couldn't actually get their computers to do anything except the work necessary to build and write about proofs for other computer scientists (at which point, I consider them mathematicians who aren't engaged in the empiricism necessary for calling it science and the pursuit of excellence of a practice or an art which requires probabilistic [[DOR]] all the way down). This problem showed up again for me in pipefitting where the engineer clearly understood the math, but there is something to be said for the virtue theoretic practical wisdom which can only be earned through the messier hands-on experience of putting it together yourself.

I've tried lots of languages simply because I like the idea of what they are. Like most of the games I play, I enjoy reading and {[[dream]]}ing about programming more than actually doing it. It is exceedingly rare that writing my own software from scratch is the most price-efficient method for getting the job done. Unfortunately, as I get older, I find it more tedious, and I think my time is better spent elsewhere. My offspring and I talk and work on it though. I want them to own themselves in their machines. Generally speaking, I'm this [[guy|https://xkcd.com/1172/]].

It makes me giggle when you say you are boring sans your weebeity, geekdom, and RPhood.

I don't begrudge your omission in this case, and you obviously can't share everything in the brief two months I've known you, lol. It seems to me you had prima facie moral right to defend yourself too. I think you've weighed your anonymity and privacy scaling wisely.

* Morally arbitrary characterstics, yet they still define us.

I think it's fair to say you have dropped many breadcrumbs and signals, and the odds were much higher to begin with. In virtue of your openness and given the unjustified persecution you experience (or likely would), I have aimed to be careful with what I say about your identity. There are users who I openly doxx, but you won't be one of them.<<ref "h">>

One of the reasons I morally owe you protection of your offline identity is because you are so validly and vulnerably [[naked]] online. I cover your [[name]] but not your [[naked]]ness.<<ref "t">> I recognize the incredible and unjustified costs you may pay for your honesty here. You do have an unjustified target painted on your head, and that is why I must silently stand between you and our enemies where I can.

You have earned my trust too! Joyously, we have reached an important point for me in which I have the chance to share my offline identity with you.<<ref "i">> I can send it digitally or physically. I prefer a secure address to a key (simply because I hate PGP), but I'll work with whatever you give me. I do not ask you to reciprocate here.

<<footnotes "t" "Though there are exceptions to that as well in this wiki for [[others]], and perhaps the same for you will be necessary some day. I would be really surprised by a need to cover and uncover though, it would have to be a hell of an emergency. Developing trust for the virtue-theoretic dispositions, affectations, or sentiments in each [[other]] is something I aim to show radical integrity in. I am a loyal friend, and I would argue, I work hard to demonstrate my loyalty to [[The Moral Law]] even with my enemies (I know, it sounds so ominous; I'm sorry, the tone cannot be changed without failing to demonstrate the truth).">>
