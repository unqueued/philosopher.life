!! Audit:

* The kids are in good health. My wife is okay, except for headaches. It hasn't been so bad this month though. I've been anxious having to make sure I don't slip into depression.
* My son needs more time to play outside, my daughter needs more free time as well. We need to schedule this better.
* I have felt productive, no doubt. It's all I can think about at times.
* We need to link our compliments and thank you's to character traits and habits more effectively than we have.
* We are very bad about completing our goals. That's okay though. I think it does some us some serious good to think about it together.
* I leave a lot of Easter eggs for myself in these, lol. I love to literally write what people are saying, even when they don't intend for it to be written down.
* It's clear that the primary aspect of our Family Time is note captured in these logs at all. These are still important, and they are a capstone ritual to our weekly Family Time events, but this is not the full picture. That's okay though. I don't mind the organic nature of the rest of it.
