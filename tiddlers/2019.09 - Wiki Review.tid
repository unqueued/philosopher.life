!! Audit:

* Normally, we don't allow anyone to not pay attention. I am surprised they let me even while drunk. I'm grateful for the sleep.
* My predictions have become far more streamlined, and this log shows it. That said, I've also been running behind a ton this month. I've never been this inconsistent before.
** Yet, you still seem lost, and you know it.
* I'm pleased to see so much editing. The two-day pass makes [[Recent]] feel sticky, and that's a good thing. It globs and runs together differently. 
** Sleeping on it matters.
* There are {[[Dreams]]} in here. Hrm. Dark ones.
* You plead, refuse to assent, error-correct, reframe, and seem far more 2nd personal than usual.
* My wife is in pain so often. I've known it for 15 years, and it's still hard to bear.
* I see combat in here.
** Plenty of paranoia too. 
*** What are you hunting for?
* Your WoW play has declined significantly.
** Your 2-hour rule during the week is wise. Should the weekends adhere to this as well?
* Straight up shocked to see Sir [[GB]]. I think we've connected much better here.
* Commentary when I'm behind is egregious.
* I play with a lot of incredibly lonely and discarded people in [[Project Ascension]].
* ROFL. Love the text art, sir.
* Moving to grafting whenever I get to it is fine. It's very moving to see it altogether.
* The fact that my job is probably temporary weighs on me. Being moral is painful.
* Lacking AC sucked. CT continues to look better and better.
* Naw, it's still a clusterfuck with your offspring. It felt better, but it wasn't.
** Some of your public children work much harder (and for much less).
** But, overall, year-on-year, yeah, the differences are enormous.
* My brother's life appears to have normalized.
