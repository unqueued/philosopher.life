!! Audit:

* I still don't know the correct timeslices for chatlogs. I'm super glad I do them though.
** Spaced repetition is important for me here. I just can't remember enough. It's not that I shouldn't forget things, but I have a tendency to forget too much.
** Digestion and direction. Never as mere means. I think my wife is the only person in the world who takes that seriously all the way down with me. Not enough folks experienced in the matter. =/.
* [[/b/]]'s infection is fairly complete, lol.
* Yeah, I've added "yeah" to my blargles.
* I would really like to eventually flesh out some person pages. I've just been overwhelmed. I don't feel like my piece of art would be complete without it. 
* It's interesting when I [[Wiki Review]] something which isn't complete. It's speculative and {[[dream]]}-oriented.
** There's also planning in here too. 
*** I take it that the functions are just going to bleed together. It's about finding something which fires up the process?
* I feel so old reading this, but not. 20 years with the DMV? Roflmao. I don't feel that old.
* Yeah, I feel a chunk is missing without [[Antipleonasm Analysis]].
** I need the breathing space right now. And, [[Wiki Audit]] needs to take over. [[FTO]] has thrown me off, and I've got a lot to catch up on.
* I've been pretty awful about my [[Monthly Audit]]s. =/.
* Interesting to see [[WINTCIS]] coming out of this. It shouldn't be what caused it, so it was the straw?
* [[CTS]] is a place where it where ML couldn't write in isolation, but parts of this log could be. It's at least always partially meta about something in the wiki.
* Jokes and jokes and jokes... =) Adore it. I need to make it rain.
