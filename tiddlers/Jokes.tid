title: Jokes

//As my wife points out, I'm permanently 12 years old.//

It is very clear to me that comedians are philosophers of a sort. They tend to be damaged, intelligent, psychopathic, economical, and intuitive. I think of them as articulate and more well-intentioned magicians. They see the cracks in society and in ourselves. They laugh about what we fear and don't understand. It's a strong fight-or-flight mechanism, an oscillation. Jokes should be preserved. Currently, I keep short and simple ones. Perhaps I will catalog those longer narratives of great importance to me later.

I need to giggle and wheeze. Store up that gold.
