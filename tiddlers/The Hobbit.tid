!! 2018.08.29:

I'm going through my old favorites with the kids. I was eventually able to convince my daughter to read this book before (after much argumentation). I'm glad to do this as an audiobook with them. We made it about 20% on our first session. 

Admittedly, this is not lighting up for me like [[Dune]], but that's okay. This is largely about connecting with my chillun through shared stories. This isn't their only exposure. We've (to my chagrin) see at least the first Hobbit movie. We've talked about it quite a bit. I'm glad to be going through this book. There are a lot of discussions my wife and I have which ultimately require knowledge of Tolkien's work. We need dem references.

We spent some time thinking about the scene where Bilbo pops back into the group. It gives us some clues about the intentions of the author for the other books. I think there are continuity questions that arise here. It may be an ugly kind of problem.

I'm desperate to get my children to start cramming their lives with books, even if they are audiobooks. I really do enjoy how audibooks give me a chance to read+write at the same time. It reminds me of lectures, which is the style of learning that I grew up with (preaching). We talked about the thousands of books they've been forced to read since they were young, and now it's time to help them build their own deepreading practices. I feel like a real failure as a dad here. I don't know how to convey it's value (despite how often we talk about it), and I know I'm nowhere near good enough either.

The elves are such odd creatures. I love how even those with eternal lives are interpreted as having the usual [[fff]] flaws. It's hard for me to fathom how much this book controlled my thinking about elves. I was a hardcore Everquest player for years (the original 12-hour-a-day gaming addiction), and it's fun to see this book give life to my game as well.

I remember watching a cartoon version of this when I was ~5.

There is more whimsy and magic to this story for me than LOTR. It's far less an epic, and that's on purpose I assume. I love the worlds it has given birth to.

This story is linear and fairly single-threaded, unlike LOTR, and that may be part of why I've always had an easier time "being there" in the virtual world created generated by this book. In a way, this book is more enticing, effortless, and escapist than the rest of the world is spawns. Perhaps that's because I'm borderline illiterate.

When the settle into the mountain, I feel like I'm building a pillow fort as a kid.

Smaug is a character I still do not understand these many years later.

I do not understand Tolkien's reactionary position.

Kant's jewel is shining forth, bitches.

The ex machinas have got to stop. I can't believe Tolkien had the balls to talk about Lewis' style.

I think we're supposed to be pleased and then converted to love Thorin. When a president dies, same bullshit.

I do appreciate how queerness is celebrated in this book.

The prophesy aspects always meant a lot to me as a Christian.

Asking all the dumb questions, since this book is celebrating something I do not (though there is some overlap in our views):

Why does Gandalf think Bilbo is a worthy 14th companion? It seems they've gone well out of their way, all of them, to meet him.

I think Gandalf lies all the fucking time. It drives me insane. I don't like when semi-deities lie. 

I don't see why anyone would think Gandalf "knew" the map was meant for Thorin. That story makes no sense. The dude didn't even know his own name. Sure, he was nice giving the map to the owner, but the story should be the truth.

I've decided Gandalf is gaslighting these poor midgets. That "10.45" bumrush where he coerces the confused hobbit to run off without thinking through it, and we're supposed to act like that mischievous deception is totally fine.

Gandalf up and disappears before the trolls. This is forced, or perhaps Gandalf is fucking with them yet again (or, wait, he's really just scouting for them, right?).

Tolkien's snooty aristocrat anti-poor bullshit shows up over and over. e.g. I'm afraid the trolls are really like that: they have poor manners. Talk about shitty memetic breeding. I am sad to see Tolkien continues to plummet for me.

The solution to the troll scene is Gandalf deceiving. So clever! =)

The characters are getting harder to believe. I think my ability to suspend my disbelief in this book is declining.

I feel like I'm having a #theempiredidnothingwrong moment here. I'm fine with eating ponies and donkeys, and Tolkien's classism comes right out. His primary point against the Goblins is that they despise the orderly and prosperous. Obviously, I must be a goblin. It is rare that I find someone who prospers without exploitation, particularly when exploitation is the only method of wealth acquisition for the vast majority.

Ex machinas on wings only get worse with age. No, Bilbo couldn't hold on like that.

The "under their own enchantment" creatures are exceptionally powerful. Reminds me unmoved movers.

Gandalf, of course, is a clever deceiver even with Beorn. It's disturbingly celebrated. 

I still don't understand why the Necromancer doesn't appear more aware of The Ring of Power. We have good reason to believe he would track it down himself, right? He can see who is wearing it, and that happened often. This is a partial disconnect.

I suggest that Gandalf is Tolkien's self-representation, particularly when it comes to clever, deceptive story-telling. He aims to inject his religious views masked with rhetoric.

Tolkien's unjustified belief the elves are "Good People" and the way in which the King's powers and notion of "manners and sense" has a hint of plausibility is ridiculous.

I think it might be a nod to Plato to have the Sun still give a shadow to the ringwearer.

It's fair to say this book is about greed and convincing the poors to know their place. Classic Tolkien.

The reaction to the death of Smaug may or may not be fitting. Having a town close to the dragon was never fitting. This made no sense.

There's more to you than anyone including you even knows. It's the magic, the spirit of tha lawd. Yer a wizard, ~~Harry~~ Bilbo.

The timing of Gandalf and the war is ridiculous. =/

The book celebrates adventure but also "knowing your place" in society without complaint. Tolkien opposes greed until he doesn't. He's particularly soft on the greed of creatures he sees as more ethereal and closer to the supernaturally "good" side (where I hesitate to speak of [[The Good]] here).

I probably shouldn't read this one again for some time.
