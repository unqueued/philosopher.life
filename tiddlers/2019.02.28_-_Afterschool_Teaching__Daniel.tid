title: 2019.02.28 - Afterschool Teaching: Daniel

Daniel was there upon arrival. We continued to awkwardly connect. We might be polar opposites in some respects. Age will cure some of it, lol. I am old for where I'm at.

I brought a book of poetry, and 7Cf appears to be reading some of it in between chatting on her phone. She took pictures of some of the poems. Cool.

I spoke with 8Gf about programming. She seems less interested after speaking about it.

5:24f and I talked about orthodontics, marketing, and biology. Unfortunately, I don't have a book I can hand her that is fitting. I'm going to have to rely upon her resourcefulness. She appears somewhat self-driven though. That might happen.

I ended up taking kids to the lab, doing my paperwork, and that was it.
