I bought me a new case and I have my old case and gpu riser kit and cable if you want to help me switch it out I'll give it to you
JAN 5 12:48 PM
Noice. I wish I could!
JAN 5 12:49 PM
Link me the case you got.
JAN 5 12:49 PM
I'm surprised you got a new one since the other was reliable and pretty.
JAN 5 12:49 PM
Didn't you ask me for a riser cable
JAN 5 12:49 PM
Nope.

Yeah. That's the only way I buy laptops.

Minus C720's which were wildly underpriced on purpose.

No idea.

If it will be bad or not.
