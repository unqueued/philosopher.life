* Stunning!

*** I am a huge fan! Look at this wiki; you know it. We would probably disagree (and have fun doing it!), but I think we would have learned a lot from each other.
*** The Rabbithole took me here:

* KYS

*** This will be extremely common place. Businesses will massively collude in this way, the culture is already built, and this is just an additional tool for it. We are fucked. We've given psychopaths superpowers with automation.
** https://www.marketwatch.com/story/many-older-americans-are-living-a-desperate-nomadic-life-2017-11-06
*** Exploitation of the Alien, the Other, the Weak. Fuck you.
*** Even in my empathy, I pissed off at those nomads who have created a world in which they are reaping what they sow (as are the rest of us).

*** Thank you, Reactionary Babyboomers and Capitalists.

*** Censorship, you dense motherfuckers!

* Preach, yo!
** https://scanberlin.com/2017/11/12/debunking-the-myth-of-lower-class-entitlement/
*** Except the anti-pitchforks claim at the end, I think you had a great point.
** https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35
*** Paradigm shift time. 

* Confirm My Bias
** https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/11/lebanon-saudi-iran-hezbollah/545306/
*** It does appear to be heating up. Is this just classic mideast problems, a mad world issue, or something else?
** https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-chart-shows-that-your-parents-income-determines-your-future-2015-07-24
*** Yes. We know.
** https://www.godot.online/wasm/
*** WASM is coming alive.

*** Not perfect, but some excellent points.
** https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/11/americas-mass-shooting-epidemic-contagious/545078/
*** Memes are mental viruses.
** https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/taibbi-a-year-after-trumps-election-nothing-has-changed-w511229
*** Game-Theoretic Voting, and let the memes do the rest.
** http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1001154/chinese-grads-return-home-with-degrees-and-disillusionment
*** Education inflation, education as a business, education not as a transformative experience but as a means to a job; take your pick.
** https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/11/bernie-sanders-says-denmark-is-socialist-forbes-magazine-says-its-the-most-business-friendly-country-whos-right/?
*** This is why I don't think Bernie Sanders is a socialist; he only gets part of the picture. 
*** Scandinavia is your neutral psychopath, deeply selfish communities that ride the fences well for themselves. Replicable? To some extent, yes, but still fundamentally not the answer. They are dependent upon larger fish.

** http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-35735472
*** Sounds about right to me.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.wired.com/story/hack-the-pentagon-bug-bounty-results/
*** They slowly change, but probably only because they have to. What hacker doesn't use cannabis? They have to privatize because they can't find the human capital and face enormous redtape. That's not necessarily a good thing, but it is worth watching.

* Think About It
** http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/11/08/facebook_wants_victims_of_revenge_porn_to_upload_a_nude_photo_to_prevent.html
*** Umm...How else are you going to do it? Tone-deaf, sure. When the doctor swabs you with a rapekit, that sucks too, but is necessary (right, good for legal, mixed bad and good for the victim).
**** Note, I actually don't think revenge porn is immoral in the vast majority of cases. Did you consent to giving a picture of your body to someone else? Game over, retard.

*** Not a fan of many #childfree folk's attitudes and arguments, but I can agree here. Vasectomy at 21, and so glad I did; that said, I already had two children by then.

* Fishy
** https://news.slashdot.org/story/17/11/11/0539216/h1-b-administrators-are-challenging-an-unusually-large-number-of-applications?
*** Xenophobia, maybe a bit. Immigration is rapidly changing, and I do not have real grasp of how and why. Let me suggest that this source of cheap labor and attempt to suppress wages in the US is not squeezed to anyone's benefit but those in power. Now, how can this work? Perhaps only those H1-B's taking the lowest wages will be accepted? Maybe companies will have to bribe government employees? If we went full conspiracy theory, we'd need to check who is being barred; perhaps particular industries or companies are being targeted.
