How's your grandpa, and how are you?
Wed 11:57 AM
 Hey! It's been a nightmare, not gonna lie, lol. I cant remember the last update I gave yall but hes on hospice. The doctors are pretty sure he has prostate cancer and ots spread to his brain and other places. This is in addition to the alzheimers So his mind is gone, but he still has upper body strength and enough strength to stand. But not enough coordination to walk so hes a fall risk. So someone has to be with him 24/7. It's a small hospital so there's not enough staff for them to watch him so it's been me, mom, and my aunt sharon rotating shifts. 

While all that has been going in, shirley (my grandmother) has had a blood pressure of 200/something and had to go to the ER. While there they realized she might have Parkinson's so were taking her to a neurologist next week. My uncle leslie (moms brother) lives in Memphis and hes a raging diabetic and passed out, fell, and it took him eight hours before he could crawl to the phone to call us. We had to drive two hours one way, clean up his literal shit and vomit, and drive him two hours back home for the weekend where we could take care of him. We didnt get back til 3am. 

It's been an absolute shit show down here, lol.

 Being the lubricant and glue for your family in crisis can be sacrificial. I bet you are going to need to take some serious "me time" when you eventually have the chance.

 It must be really difficult to be away from Adam this long.

 I literally can barely last a day away from [[k0sh3k]], I'm that psychologically and physiologically dependent upon her.
