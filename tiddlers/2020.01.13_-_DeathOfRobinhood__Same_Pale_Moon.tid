How's it going? You have a good holiday?
Jan 7 4:22pm
Hey, it's been really dense, but good! I'd like to tell you about it, maybe tomorrow evening? I'd like to hear about your vacation too
Jan 8 8:11am
Aye. That would be great.
Jan 8 11:39am
My voice is awful today. I need to wait to call*. I thought my cold was getting better, but it's not. Sorry. =(.
Jan 9 5:36pm
Oh, hey, I was just about to call and saw this.
Actually, my voice is on the rocks too. I've had this bad cough for a week now, and it's been difficult to string two sentences together without my voice going on the fritz.
Jan 9 5:44pm
To our mutual getting better!
Jan 9 5:45pm
Lol. I'm sorry dude.
Jan 9 5:45pm
Yes, to our mutual getting better! =) `/pops-a-menthol`

I look up at the night sky and think 
"I wonder if h0p3 is coughing up at the same pale moon as me..."

Thinking of you, friend. Praying too, but not as I ought.
Jan 13 10:42am
Lol! Yeah, still coughing up a storm. Can't get to the doctor because insurance doesn't kick in for two weeks, but found a couch suppressant that might have it under control. So ready to have a night of actual sleep. I'm going to have to make it a ritual from now on to cough (rather than howl) at the moon.
Jan 13 10:47am
You feeling any better?
Jan 13 10:51am
Violent coughs still wake me up at night, but is altogether less miserable than it was last week.
Having an extra couple of hours of sleep on weekends made a big difference.
Jan 13 10:53am
Hey, it's late. I just want to make sure you are feeling safe.
Jan 15 10:27pm
My voice is shit atm, but please free to call me at any hour should the desire arise.
Jan 15 10:29pm
Thank you :)
Yes, I am feeling safe.
