Took zon to 85 on Pindleskin+Eldritch runs. I tried just Pindle, but it wasn't as fun. I also think that the gold income from just selling to vendors is significant. I'm always on the hunt for good jewelry, and gambling is the best way to acquire it. I can't afford to craft everything. I'm saving up runes for it anyways. I think it's the best low-end rune dump, by far. Cubing up doesn't get you very far. The chance to see the best items in the game, however, small, is a better use of those resources. It's about spinning a bunch of gambling plates as efficiently as possible. Hence, not just crafting, but actually gambling. I average about ~3 rares per inventory filled with rings. Let's say I drop 400k gold per rare ring then. There is a kind of determinism here worth grinding. Also, there are cornercase magic jewelry pieces worth having. All Resist+MF is stronger than you'd suspect. 

I'm not finding a lot, I will say that. Meph is a stronger source of items, but he doesn't have the range that Pindleskin has. Right now, range matters more.

Also, decided to start trying Countess runs. My first time I just didn't have it down right (and had a poor set of results the first couple tries). I've collected an absurd number today. I also landed a Ko and a Key! I'm going to at least grind for 3 keys. Also, an Ist! Immediately, this was some very well spent time. That is the highest rune I have ever seen (I had a Gul drop from Hellforge for me many years ago in a different playthrough). I've basically filled out my lower runes all the way up to Hel (single row filled) with the crafting runes set aside. I won't be combining them. I think the roles are more valuable. Pul and 2 Lems. Make that 2 Ko's.

Here's what I've got:

* Keys: out the ass
* 2 Ist
* 2 Pul
* 4 Lem
* 1 Fal
* 3 Ko
* 1 Eth Shaftstop
** Considering Upping, socketing, and putting something amazing in it. Sometimes Treachery is the wrong choice.
