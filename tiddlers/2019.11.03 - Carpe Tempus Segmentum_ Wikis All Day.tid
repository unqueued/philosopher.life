title: 2019.11.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Wikis All Day

* Woke at 5
* IASIP
* Read
* Chilled with muh homies this morning. Some //Daria//. Sleepy AF.
* Nap until...11?
* Coffeebliss
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Pizza!
* Family Wikis
** 8 straight hours of discussion and reading together.
** [[Sphygmus]]' log required a close-reading from the entire family with passes over previous work and unraveling timelines in both our wikis. There are many lines of reasoning and anxiety in it.
*** Surprising accidental indirect crossover content in all of our wikis on this too.
** We skipped one-on-ones and the walk today because thinking about our wikis was so expensive.
*** Though it's good to know my daughter enjoys the one-on-ones quite a bit (unhappy to lose that today). 
* Family Log
* Can tell my wife hasn't taken her vitamin D. She's dizzy.
