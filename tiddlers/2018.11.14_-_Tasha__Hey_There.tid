```
Hey there!
WED 5:47 PM
Hey, how's it going? =)
WED 6:38 PM
It’s going :slightly_smiling_face: cannot complain
WED 6:42 PM
Same here.
WED 6:42 PM
You guys have any plans Friday?
WED 6:42 PM
Nope, we are free on Friday.
WED 6:42 PM
If Matthew is off we were going to see if y’all wanted to hang out
WED 6:43 PM
Yeah, that'd be cool.
WED 6:43 PM
I guess he will know tonight I just didn’t want to hit you up last minute either
WED 6:43 PM
Did you guys get the inspection notice today lol
WED 6:44 PM
I appreciate that. Makes sense. I was thinking today about inviting you guys over to get to know Matthew too. Cool.
WED 6:44 PM
Yeah, lol.
WED 6:44 PM
They spend like 20 seconds in the house then leave.
WED 6:44 PM
I'm not even sure what they are looking for.
WED 6:44 PM
Hmm :woman-shrugging: it is what it is we have nothing they want I don’t think lol
WED 6:45 PM
I will hit you up tomorrow to let you know what Matthews schedule will be
WED 6:47 PM
Sounds good.
WED 6:47 PM

WED 6:48 PM
Definitely I am at work at the moment but I will check them out asap
WED 6:50 PM
Work going okay?
WED 6:50 PM
It’s awkward I couldn’t take it and blew the whistle and got her mom involved. Now I’m the bad one and. I’m quote on quote going through a culture shock?
WED 6:52 PM
Yikes.
WED 6:52 PM
Is that what the mom thinks?
WED 6:52 PM
Nope the mom and family support me and her mom has had the same thoughts as far as him being a dangerous person to be around 2 little girls
WED 6:53 PM
=/
WED 6:54 PM
Definitely
WED 6:56 PM
What’s crazy to me is since then he won’t face me hiding in their room and avoiding me? I’m like oh yea actions of an innocent man??
WED 6:57 PM
He know you blew the whistle?
WED 6:58 PM
Yup she didn’t even protect me or anyone really- immediately told him what was going on?
WED 6:58 PM
No confidentiality at all?
WED 6:59 PM
Definitely not how I thought any of it would go but I don’t care- I know something isn’t right!
WED 7:00 PM
That is unfortunate. I am sorry. She clearly does not want to hear what you have to say. You and him will both be watching each other like hawks now (though, he is in a position of power).
WED 7:02 PM
You think the mother is going to act on it?
WED 7:02 PM
He isn’t though- her mother will be taking action she believes he daughter- my friend/boss needs an intervention. This is apparently is a reoccurring issue and her mother is to a point of taking the babies away and getting involved because she has dismissed everyone’s concerns about him. This is not the first man to drag her through mud and she won’t listen so Grandma is ready. And I agree
WED 7:08 PM
Oops excuse typos have a baby in my hands :see_no_evil:
WED 7:08 PM
I just need to decide what I’m going to do
WED 7:09 PM
Not sure what you can do at this point.
WED 7:09 PM
Well I mean I won’t be a part of her habits nor will I be expected to talk to him so I may needed find another job if I can’t
WED 7:10 PM
aye =(
WED 7:11 PM
:woman-shrugging: it is what it is I will miss the girls and feel horrible about everything but I got her mom involved with them in mind - I just want them safe!
WED 7:13 PM
Yup. It's the right thing, even if it hurts.
WED 7:14 PM
Yes
WED 7:14 PM
Quick question do you guys like chicken enchiladas?
WED 9:16 PM
Yes.
WED 9:16 PM
Also, what can we bring?
WED 9:16 PM
Lol k and [[k0sh3k]] is lactose intolerant?
WED 9:16 PM
Yes, she cannot have anything with milk in the label. Her throat will start to close up.
WED 9:17 PM
Nothing :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: it’s our turn!
WED 9:17 PM
K
WED 9:17 PM
What kinda a beer do you like? I think Esteban will remember but just in case?
WED 9:18 PM
Any beer is great, seriously.
WED 9:19 PM
Okay I’ll let Esteban get them for y’all
WED 9:19 PM
And what other kind of drinks would you guys do? Like for the kiddos or even [[k0sh3k]]?
WED 9:20 PM
We are not picky. Anything is good with us. We usually do coffee, tea, and mostly water. We will gladly have whatever you will be having.
WED 9:22 PM
Word. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
