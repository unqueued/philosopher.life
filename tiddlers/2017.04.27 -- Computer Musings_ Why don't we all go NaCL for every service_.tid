title: 2017.04.27 -- Computer Musings: Why don't we all go NaCL for every service?

I realize the enormity of what I'm asking. Securing the internet systematically is hard for a bunch of incredibly complex reasons. It is clear to me that very large tech companies should have a vested interest in really do this systematically (instead of from working inside). They don't seem to act upon it. Just another reason to doubt authority, wealth, and power. =(

We have to fight for it tooth and nail as a people.
