!! How has being colorblind affected you?

Well, I can't distinguish particular patterns of colors. The world isn't as bright to me as it is to others. I am often confused or have difficulty making inferences others make regarding color too.

Some video games just aren't playable because I'm colorblind. Some are just harder to play because things don't jump out at me as they do for others.

Most people are drawn to a laser pointer. I can barely see it, and only effectively when targeting a mono-color, dark object. In the theatre, I can't even see it. Lol.

I think it has helped me cultivate an awareness of the fact that I perceive the world differently than typical people, for better or worse. Importantly, being colorblind has made it ever so clear to me that things aren't always what they seem. A number of phenomenological and epistemic problems arise for me in colorblindness.
