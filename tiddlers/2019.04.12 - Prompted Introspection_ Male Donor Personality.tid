title: 2019.04.12 - Prompted Introspection: Male Donor Personality

!! Describe your father's personality in a short journal entry.

I have responded to this prompt before: [[2018.01.23 - Prompted Introspection Log: MWF's Personality]]. 

Strong quantitative and exceptional spatial reasoning (prodigious with maps): he should have been a mathematician. He wanted to be Spock. He worked hard to pay to attend private schools in MA. He experienced quite a bit of violence, but he thinks poor people often deserve their poverty (beyond the point of sanity). There's a lot of survivorship bias in him. He reminds me of the Saudaukar, surviving hell through gnostic conservatism which has increasingly warped into dark-triadicism over the years. His ability to see evil is exceptional, but he wields it selectively and quite conveniently in many cases. Fundamental misattribution might be his hobby.

The man has a knee-deep encyclopedic knowledge-base, strong contrarian reasoning when it benefits him, and he's decent at studying video games. He studies neocon economics and political strategy as a nationalist. He appears to be largely a Christian in name only now, though he can talk  the talk into schizophrenic delusion. He designs infrastructures for himself well enough, but he is weighed down by a wife who cannot think logistically or quantitatively to save her life.

He has a talent for handling a broad range of personality types. His communications are brief and controlling, and he wears his emotions on his sleeve when you know where to look. You can see the gears turning in him. Most people are well-deceived.

He chooses to stick to a particular narrative, and his uncharitable dishonesty and general choice not to experience remorse is in no small part the reason his sons don't speak with him. Outside of his wife, he is a loner with an addictive personality.
