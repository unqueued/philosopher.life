I'm sorry. That sucks! Don't worry about the late responses, we get to it when we can. I hope you get to feeling better soon. Is anyone else sick?

Appreciate that! He told me when I got home too he asked if he was supposed to go over - I told him no just whatever.

He’s a simple kid though he can live off his tv and phone as long as he has some food when he looks up he’s all right

Yesterday, I ate a clock.

It was very time consuming.

Especially when I went back for seconds.
