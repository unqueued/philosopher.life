title: 2018.03.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Smoking Limitations

!! Should people be prohibited from smoking in certain places?

Of course. Right in front of my face is a place, and people shouldn't smoke there without my permission because I'm allergic/sensitive to it.<<ref "1">> We need to tax the living fuck out of substances we have a problem with, we should enable harm reduction practices as much as possible, and we must legally require people to use it safely and never endanger others with it. Smoking is just another substance that we should wisely regulate.
