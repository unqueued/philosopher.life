//This time it's personal!...//

It's very hard to keep your spirits up. You've got to keep selling yourself a bill of goods, and some people are better at lying to themselves than others. If you face reality too much, it kills you. 

-Woody Allen

This log is ironic and difficult to label. In a sense, [[h0p3]]'s wiki, this entire .html document, is a log of h0p3. What am I possibly doing here then? Doesn't it seem redundant, if not futile? What the fuck are the other logs if they aren't logs about h0p3? How is {[[About]]} not also a kind of h0p3's log?

Yet, I must stop abusing [[/b/]] for material that obviously belongs here. Of course, [[/b/]] does whatever it does because it is stream-of-consciousness. It's not up to me, in a real sense, what I'm thinking in a moment. You can't help what you feel, but maybe you can do something about it. My autonomy doesn't go that far. All I have are long-term knobs that help me habituate myself into becoming an animal that eventually has different thoughts and feelings. So, obviously, [[/b/]] gets a free pass to do whatever. That's the entire fucking point of it. I need that gutteral data to do science with my life. 

Unfortunately, [[/b/]] is too random. I need structure here. Thus my retransition here.

I resurrected this log because I need to find and remove the emotional splinters in my mind. Here I wrestle, and I am obscenely vulnerable about it. Thus, I warn you: what may seem like mere splinters to you creates a wounded animal in me. Hate wounds the heart, and ignorance wounds the mind. I can only assume malice or ignorance, practical materialism or ideal idealism, except when I can't (sublation). Those are my options.<<ref "1">>  Believe me, I'm trying to take the splinter out of my own eye; it's not easy.
