title: 2018.07.11 - Prompted Introspection: Falling in Love

!! Describe what it was like to fall in love.

It was the exact opposite of eating a bowl full of boogers. But, it was guttural, of course. I've long been trained to seek it as a commitment. Despite what you may think, it was rational for me. I knew within a single date (after knowing her for 3 semesters). I wrote about it that night. I knew I had been looking for her my entire life. I was married two months later. [[Love]] is a type of knowledge in, of, about, regarding, toward [[The Other]]. You better be using both your limbic and neocortex systems to "feel" love, or you don't really have it.
