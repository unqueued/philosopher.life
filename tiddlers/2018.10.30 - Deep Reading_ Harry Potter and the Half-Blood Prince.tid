title: 2018.10.30 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Hagrid wears on me over the course of these books. It's supposed to be that way in the books. HP and Hagrid peel apart somewhat.

Is this the worst use of a luck potion ever? How is that substance not abused into oblivion? Story no make sense: "magic" okay.

So fucking meta to use my wiki to talk about the pensieve to learn about the horcrux. =)

Neat to see HP and Voldemort both weedling information out of the same man.

Slughorn's argument isn't a good one. How does one unify the horcrux? =)

Prophesy reasoning is awful. The contradictions continue to bubble up.

Snape's invasion of privacy is amazing.

Do love the kiss scene.

GOD DAMN! Snape is a sick occlumens. THIS IS PURE FUCKING FAITH. /applause Rowling.

I have absolutely no idea why Dumbledore is doing with this HP and not a bunch of actually talented wizards.

The Malfoy scene does a lot of work. Lovely Mercy claim. 

Annoys me that Dumbledore doesn't fight back. He obviously could. If we are to believe that the killing curse cannot be used unless you "really mean it," then how the fuck does Snape effectively use it here?

Near meaninglessness of death and suffering in many cases.

Dramatic flair, this book could have ended much sooner.
