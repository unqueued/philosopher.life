!! Audit:

* I've been posting less consistently, but I've also not had as much time to surf, I believe. Or, when I do surf, I've not had the energy to go for as much intellectual reading, or so it feels.
* I figured Bloomberg out.
* It's clear that I allow these to build up in my browser. I think this is fine. It allows me to backburner and table content, to digest, and to think about what it is that I'll be putting in these link logs. 
** The downside is that it doesn't actually follow my reading patterns in a synchronized manner, although it is close enough, right?
* Nautil.us is amazing.
