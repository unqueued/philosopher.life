title: 2014.06.25 - Phil of Religion: Intro

What is Western religion?

By Western, we mean ancient Mediterranean, Medieval European, and the modern West (US, Britain, Continental Europe, Australia, etc.). We won’t be handling Eastern religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. We won’t be looking at African religions. We won’t even really be looking at religions.

William James’ “religious hypothesis”:

    There is a higher universe or higher being(s).

    We are better off if we believe this and act accordingly.

    Communion with the higher universe “is a process wherein work is really done” or higher being(s) who produce effects in the visible world.

Deism doesn’t match this though.

What is Western philosophy of religion?

    “Philosophy of X” isn’t necessarily doing “X”

        Thinking about the foundations and assumptions of religious belief.

        Considering core concepts of religious belief, as well justifications for and challenges to religious belief

        Trying to find what (if anything) various religious beliefs have in common.



    Crazy long and large lineage of thought.

        Ancient, e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Judaism, Islam

        Early Christian, e.g. St. Augustine

        Medieval, e.g. St. Aquinas

        Early Modern Continental, e.g. Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz

        Sprawls widely from here



    Some Broad Topics:

        Concepts of God

            Perfect Being, Holiness, Omnipotence, Omniscience, Omnipresence, Goodness, Eternity, Necessity, Incorporeality, Beauty, Divine Action, Creation, Immutability, Providence, Pantheism

        Justificatory Arguments for Religious Belief

            Ontological, Cosmological, Teleological/Design, Moral, Consciousness and Free Will, Miracles, Religious Experience, Pragmatic, Tradition, Fideism

        Challenges to Religious Belief

            Presumption of Atheism, Verificationism, Incoherence, Foreknowledge and Freedom, No Best World, Logical Problem of Evil, Evidential Problem of Evil, Naturalism

            Additionally, there are copious challenges which indirectly arise from other branches of philosophy: epistemology, ethics, metaphysics and ontology, philosophies of language and mind, etc.

        Religion and Science

            Cosmology, Creation, Evolution, Psychology, etc.

        Ethics

            Religious Commitment; Divine Command; Natural Law; Political Philosophy; Tolerance; Sin and Original Sin; Atonement, Justification, and Sanctification; Resurrection, Heaven, and Hell.
