Hey man. I was meaning to text you and ask the same. Yeah mine was good. Visited my mom. Back in New Mexico now

Good, I'm glad.

I'm doing well enough. We get our pods tomorrow, so I'm looking forward to having furniture and stuff. It's been a good move so far. Getting used to being in a city again.

Moving pods?
Jan 7 7:37pm
Aye. A lot more flexible than doing a truck in some ways.
Jan 7 7:37pm
For sure. Glad to hear the move has gone well. Such a stressful thing to do
