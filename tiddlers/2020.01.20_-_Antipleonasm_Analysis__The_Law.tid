!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Whenever you’re going after something that belongs to you, anyone who’s depriving you of the right to have it is a criminal. Understand that. Whenever you are going after something that is yours, you are within your legal rights to lay claim to it. And anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that which is yours, is breaking the law, is a criminal. And this was pointed out by the Supreme Court decision. It outlawed segregation. Which means segregation is against the law. Which means a segregationist is breaking the law. A segregationist is a criminal. You can’t label him as anything other than that. And when you demonstrate against segregation, the law is on your side. The Supreme Court is on your side...Now, who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law? The police department itself. With police dogs and clubs. Whenever you demonstrate against segregation, whether it is segregated education, segregated housing, or anything else, the law is on your side, and anyone who stands in the way is not the law any longer. They are breaking the law; they are not representatives of the law.

"Belongs to you" according to what standard? A mere legal standard has no objective normative force in itself. Further, immorality is often legal, sanctioned even. Why should I care about criminality in itself? You aren't within your legal rights to do illegal things (unless we are after legal contradictions, but I don't think we mean to go down the rabbithole here), but you are within your moral right to do so in many cases. That which is morally yours is not necessarily defined by the law, nor is the justified recourse exclusively defined by the juridical law either. It's so weird to see this legal/moral conflation mistake from you.

Unfortunately, segregation wasn't made as illegal as you've claimed. It turns out there are many ways to segregate and discriminate which not initially obvious, can be insidious (the devil is in the details), and you are too optimistic here. Similarly, what counts as "the law" isn't simply what's on the books, it's also a matter of what is practically enforced and adjudicated. The police department is a living extension of the law (so perhaps you are after a contradiction). 

Your problem is solved by speaking of [[The Moral Law]] instead.
