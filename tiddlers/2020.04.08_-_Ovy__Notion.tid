[9:38 PM] Valdus: Hey brah, I went with Notion, kind of suspicious that they have an address in frakking somalia but here I am. For free, worked this Crown virus into a way in and I got a free educator account.
[9:38 PM] h0p3: Yo, homie!
[9:39 PM] h0p3: Hopefully, it won't be too difficult to transfer your work from the wiki into Notion.
[9:40 PM] h0p3: How's life going?
[9:41 PM] Valdus: Pretty good as good as quarantine is with a four year old in Nawlins.
[9:41 PM] h0p3: I hear that.
[9:41 PM] h0p3: I moved up to CT since we last spoke.
[9:42 PM] h0p3: It's going well here as well. We homeschool, so we're already kind of quarantined in the first place.
[9:42 PM] Valdus: good for you, too bad Bernie dropped eh? we could have been Canada
[9:43 PM] h0p3: I'm beyond livid about this election cycle, yet again.
[9:43 PM] h0p3: Bernie was a compromise I was willing to accept.
[9:43 PM] h0p3: He was at least remotely in the correct direction.
[9:43 PM] Valdus: of course! YOUR'RE INTELLIGENT
[9:44 PM] h0p3: 2020 sucks
[9:46 PM] Valdus: Il be honest, I am 50 years old and have never voted. But I was going to vote for that god damn lovely Ben and Jerry Jew, loved him, loved especially his hand expressions, it felt good. But now, but now, damn, I got to choose between a child molestor and a molestor. Nope not my vote! Im back into the invisible.
[9:46 PM] h0p3: Preach, yo. I hear that.
[9:47 PM] Valdus: love ya brah
[9:47 PM] h0p3: Love you too. You'll have to let me know how Notion is working for ya over time.
[9:48 PM] Valdus: not bad right now. https://www.notion.so/Ovy-Ortega-41c380d0d39b4f59a42365b6507264bb

[9:51 PM] Valdus: what on my home school page?
[9:51 PM] h0p3: Aye.
[9:51 PM] Valdus: yeah, and you know what its mostly not bullshit
[9:52 PM] Valdus: I felt the need when his school closed and I put my big teacher pants on
[9:53 PM] h0p3: He'll obviously benefit a great deal from your expertise and investment in him.
[9:54 PM] h0p3: I can't say I'm a great homeschooler, but if you ever have any questions or need resources, let me know. I'm happy to pirate for you too.
[9:56 PM] Valdus: Jesus F Royal Croit, you homeschool?
[9:56 PM] Valdus: perperually?
[9:56 PM] h0p3: Yup. Been homeschooling them since the beginning.

[9:58 PM] Valdus: I was a high school Catholic boys school in New Orleans for 15 years, taught History and Spanish.
[9:59 PM] Valdus: Not sure if HS is good or bad, but I will say that all yunguns need the socialization in groups. BUT if it works for them, go for it.
[9:59 PM] Valdus: NOW more vodka!

[10:11 PM] h0p3: aww, thank you. If we can make it down there some day, we'll have to meet up.
[10:13 PM] Valdus: by all and every means- do you know how wondrous it is, to have a friend in New Orlenas?
[10:14 PM] h0p3: Aye. :slight_smile: We have a couple friends still in the area. Been a long time since we lived there.
