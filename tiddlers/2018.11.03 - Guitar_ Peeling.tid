title: 2018.11.03 - Guitar: Peeling

Huh, so my calluses are peeling off. I guess I pierced them, and I've been rubbing and sawing them off. It doesn't feel like I'm back to square one though, but it's more like 3-steps forward, 1-step back. I've now got 5 songs that I've been practicing and polishing. Nothing else feels right to play right now beyond those. That is okay. That's what I'll keep working on. 

I'm playing more loudly than usual. This is something I'm not terribly used to doing, but dynamics sound good on a guitar.
