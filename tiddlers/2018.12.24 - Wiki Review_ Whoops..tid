title: 2018.12.24 - Wiki Review: Whoops.

* [[Theories of Meditation]]
** Perhaps this will grow.
* [[2018.12.23 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Meditation]]
** Completed. I'm feeling good about my surface understanding of this realm.
* [[2018.12.23 - Family Log: Fpmily?]]
** [[k0sh3k]] wrote this one out. She noted the flaw in our button.
* [[2018.12.23 - Self-Dialectic: Autocompletion]]
** Dramatic. Lol. I have no answers yet.
* [[2018.12.23 - Wiki Audit: Driver & Backseat]]
** Let's get to 5.1.19! While I'm adding automation, might as well get it all sorted. I'm getting closer and closer to being able to control, read, and write this wiki from the keyboard and multi-window, multi-tabbed doorways.
* [[2018.12.23 - Afterschool Teaching: 24]]
** I don't often use OCR. Perhaps I should.
* [[ltf]]
** I talk about it so often, I might as well crystallize it. I'm worried I don't use these phrases often enough. [[ltf]] and [[S2NR]] should definitely see more use from me though.
*** Interestingly, I could now just expand these! My ability to reliably substitute text may do that. It is hard for me to know which is the correct direction. Take [[agi]] or [[irwrongfrr]]; these are [[hlexical]] words built upon the [[hlexicon]].
* [[Poem: Spongesneer]]
** Unreadable in so many ways.
* [[2018.12.23 - Outopos: Containers]]
** I still have no idea, sadly.
* [[2018.12.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: The Game]]
** I'm enjoying responding to Petyr. My wife is liking it too.
* [[2018.12.22 - Prompted Introspection: A Spoonful]]
** This was weird to me.
* [[2018.12.22 - Wiki Review: You Dirty Skiddie Pleb :P]]
** I'm finding annoying cracks in these tools (some of them I predicted, others I didn't).
