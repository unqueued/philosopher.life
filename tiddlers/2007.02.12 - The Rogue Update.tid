title: 2007.02.12 - The Rogue Update

I’ve been sitting at close to 8.5k hp unbuffed now…1450 AP, 16% crit, and 4% hit, using roughly the same weapons. Any further adjustments to my gear will now require alot more effort, for alot less reward. I am going for a few pieces though. 4-piece assassination set, the Aldor exalted and below gear, and a ring from spirit shards. I want to break, when all is said and done: 9k hp, 1500 AP, 20% crit, 6% hit, with 80 DPS weapons with epic enchants. I’m still not fond of resilience just yet.

My problem has been a lack of good hemo weapons (no slow weapons to speak of). It looks like I’ll be jumping from a 2.9 speed weapon to a 2.6. Even with a 20 DPS gap in the weapons, hemo looks less and less useful. Right now, I hit like a truck. In fact, I’m deceptively powerful wielding old HWL MH. This issue has made me work out the numbers, and I’m considering going sinister strike at this point. Hemo, it appears, will never reach SS damage through the abuse of AP and slow, slow weapons as it once did. Right now, I’m considering 23/5/33. No CS-H-H-KS though, and that sucks. I’ll try it out.

As of right now, I’m botting (need to find a better spot) grinding cash, not for the mount, but to buy aldor rep items. I couldn’t find a suitable place to bot the actual items, so I’m farming motes and selling them to buy the marks/fel arms. I’ll have to look at the market again and evaluate the overpriced and easy to acquire items/motes that will net the greatest cash. I’d prefer in some ways, a distance island of netherstorm where I won’t see anyone, but where it drops mad loot. Hard to find such places as TBC is so crowded. I’m on the edge of Nagrand at the very bottom of the map doing the elementals. Safe and easy.

I am definitely enjoying arena and dueling. I lose very rarely. Druids and paladins are much easier than before. I must say that CB-Prep builds lose some of their appeal as people truly gear up correctly. Most people are still not gearing stamina up enough. When people are catching up to me (which isn’t hard), I’ll find myself having to work for the win a lot more.
