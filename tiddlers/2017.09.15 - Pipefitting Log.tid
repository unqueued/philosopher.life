There is a Tina Yates on this job. I don't know this one though. The one I know is Clay, not Yates.

The morning meeting entailed our capitalist overlord rationalizing and confabulating a narrative for us to swallow. It was a terrible argument about the near more miss and his need to yell at us. Disgusting.

We need to move on the bent pipe in A3 and finish the 42" in A2. Chris-M thought we would still be working on the trunion. We stayed after the meeting for clarification. 

Dave wanted Chris-M to work with the guys on the bent pipe because they were having trouble mounting it, let alone reading the prints. I was told to torque because (and this is them scrounging for positive things to say), I'm experienced and I know what I'm doing with torque. Granted, the latter is partially true. I have jackshit for experience though.

Allen wrenches are necessary for the j-gun. I have to loan my set out often because I'm the only guy with a full set. Brandon borrowed them yesterday. He did not return them. He couldn't find them. I searched and asked around and eventually found them.

I need to rethink my policy and procedure for loaning tools. I need to log in every time. That is a start.

!! Break!

I finished torque, and QC inspected. She talked primarily with me about it.

I stepped in to help the bent pipe crew in A2.

Greg explained that the last arm on the boom lift is your lifeline and to only use it when you must. IMHO, you want to maintain as much directional flexibility as possible. The goal is to midway extend everything, allowing you to maximize going any direction from there. LSO, I interpreted the controls. Each machine is different.

We put up a few pieces with Chris-M's instructions. The last piece was wrong, and he freely admitted his error. 

I helped assemble the supports and sat around waiting on the trunion ironworkers.

!! Lunch!

I continued working on the bent pipe. The fitup is a bitch. Getting it square in the air is hard. I'm hoping this will be finished when I get back on Monday.

Oh yeah, select individuals are working tomorrow. I am not included. I'm...okay with that! I really want a full weekend.

!! Break!

I worked on the bent pipe. It was just Greg and me really doing the work. We didn't make a ton of progress, but we got some stuff done.
