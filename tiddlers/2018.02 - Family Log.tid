!! Audit:

* I have lost my manicness and moved into a depressive state. They aren't strongly pronounced, but they are there.
** I oscillate. Am I bi-polar? Not obviously, but perhaps.<<ref "2019.03.26">>
* I believe my son has felt significant stress this month. I take his ringworm to be no accident. I will pay closer attention to it.
* This month was a grind for us. It was seized, but we aren't going to see all the benefits of it for a while, I believe.
