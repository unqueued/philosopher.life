title: 2018.05.03 -- Deep Reading Log: A History of Western Philosophy

The Cartesian dualism concerning mind and body is somehow more applicable in an odd way than I previously thought given the fact that I now see consciousness as being epiphenomal. Perhaps there is still more insight to be had. 

That said, I'm still convinced that the Dasein which emerges from my non-conscious processes still forms a powerful feedback loop; it is as thought the different parts of my brain are in a dialectical story-telling computation sequence with each other. Perhaps I am composed of little city-states (obviously this is an enormous oversimplification). 

I'm very pleased to have hit the modern era! And, I am glad that we took the detour from scholasticism to the Renaissance into this. While not much direct fruit is born of that era, it provides us the profound context for the philosophical revolutions to come ahead. Russell is deft and adept at telling this story.

I would be interested to hear more about how he might respond to Orientalism.
