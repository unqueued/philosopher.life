!! Audit: 

* This is still my favorite log, hands down. 
* [[Prompted Introspection Log]] is so choreographed, but this one log just goes for broke. It's blind lust for what I'm thinking.
* This is the most emotional log I own. It's absurd. Re-reading is a flashback, often into turmoil.
* It tended to be extremely dark
* I didn't post every single day in this log.
* I actually don't have much to say about the content of this log. I feel like I'm still sitting on it, thinking about it.
