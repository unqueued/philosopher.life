title: 2019.09.18 - TDL: Okay, Do What You Can

* House needs a clean.
* Your laundry has risen to epic heights. The side next to your bed is basically one beautiful pile. Stahp.
* Catchup if you didn't already on your wiki.
** It's fine, you were sick.
* Would be nice to do double dailies, but frankly, you get what you get done. It's the backburner, right?
* See if you can connect with [[gh057]].
* Your wife's redtide is killing her. She said she's going to bang you. I think you should hold up on that unless she's really down. She's just being ridiculously generous to you again. She's tired. 
* You know you've been thinking about [[Link Log]] again. =) Some much juice in dat hoard, ya dragon.
* What about the letter? Umm..you stopped.
** Hey, I'm sick.
