Decided it was time to take my level 88 Sorc to Matriarch. I'm not a believer in Blizzard; Orb is easily the best. Interestingly, with Cold mastery and only one synergy for Orb, you really don't need to invest much to get a cold skill that kills, particularly with +15 skills. One point in cold mastery is enough to make it land for full damage. Most of your points are dumped into the Fire tree. I tried Fireball instead of Meteor to weave between orbs. This was the way to do it. 7k Fireballs and 1k Orbs (with full penetration) clear almost everything.

I tried several builds out. I am still convinced that TS, Enchant, Frozen Armor, and Energy Shield are worth investing for. Static is also worth it. It rounds you out tremendously, and it's worth more than the extra damage you get.

The ability to less painfully handle Fire+Cold Immunes through TS/Static and your Merc is important. Enchant, even for AR alone, is worth it. Since I don't have Infinity, I use Insight. Energy Shield is outstanding with it, and you can teleport permanently too. The jump from Harrogath to Frozen River took maybe 4 minutes. Outstanding! It was almost instant to Ancients, and kiting was fine. Again, almost instantly to Throne, and it was quite doable. 

Interestingly, she still sat at 180% MF, lol. 135% FCR, max resists, but not max block (Spirit shield is a Tower elite...218ish str req =/). 

The sorc is really best at specializing. You find a spot, and you build to that specification. I wonder if I'll ever want to Crescent Moon.
