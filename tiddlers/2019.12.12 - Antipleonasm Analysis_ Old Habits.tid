title: 2019.12.12 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Old Habits

!! Respond to the following gem:

: Old habits die hard.

This has to be a quintessential example of virtue theory compressed down. It's hard to say what about our character isn't concerned with habituation. There's an inertia, an energy-efficiency, a borderline automated mindlessness, a blink-of-an-eye instinct, and even a radical warping of perceptions around or qua our "old habits." For old habits to die hard, part of us must die hard (or be dissociated). Who wants to do that? Lol.
