title: 2020.01.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Unity, Liberty, & Charity

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
; In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas
:    In necessary things unity, in doubtful things liberty, in all things charity.
<<<

Whoa. I take this to be a social rule-of-thumb, but this runs deep AF.

I agree there is a unity to all necessary things. All that is necessary is a consequence of all else that is necessary; they form a giant unified ball (or hypersphere[?], as I've seen one person call it) of necessity. I do not know what it means for the contingent to relate to such a thing, as usual. It appears some kind of dubitability is necessary for liberty too (though I cannot say that is what is implied in this sentence), and a radical openness and pursuit of what is [[good]] in [[The Other]] (even if you were alone on an island) seem to be necessary to crucial to uncovering the world of necessity and contingency.
