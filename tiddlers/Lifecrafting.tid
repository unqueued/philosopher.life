//We are each morally obligated slaves to our future selves and [[others]].//

Build methods and call them to recursively engineering yourselves through both affective and cognitive processes [[irwartfrr]]. It's about being a perfectionist [[irwartfrr]], being perfectly perfect and taking into account our imperfections. It's about accepting the immutable aspects of our [[fff]] [[4DID]] without conveniently abdicating responsibility in peel part the mutable from the immutable. It must be a [[Good]]will to [[The Telos]] rather than merely the Will to Power.
