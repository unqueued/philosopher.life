title: 2019.06.29 - Prompted Introspection: Perfect Weekend

!! What is your perfect weekend?

Thank you, yet again, Lady Melisandre. My perfect weekend is a socialist revolution which eliminates the aristocracy, strips their guardians, rebuilds new representative governments, and gets the ball rolling in the right direction toward the decentralization of power which can maintain itself. Technically, there are an infinite number of such worlds in which that revolution occurs, but it appears so infeasible and not as effective as other options that I shoot for something slower. Still, you are asking for //perfection//, and I'm handing it to you.
