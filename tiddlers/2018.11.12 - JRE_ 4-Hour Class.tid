title: 2018.11.12 - JRE: 4-Hour Class

My brother had a 4-hour class for fostering today. He must attend to get the 20-hour requirement. These things are generally a huge waste of his time, and even moreso now. He does love Rebecca.

He's getting his masters renewed. Good. 

His table saw is broken, and I wish I could just give him mine. He would actually use it, and I never use it. This is ridiculous. Mine has rusted up though, so he might not want it anyways (though, I think it can be cleaned up considerably). 

He's been trying to reach my chillun. He's going to continue calling until they answer. Cool. I hope they build relationships.

I completely forgot to ask about dinner last night. Oops.
