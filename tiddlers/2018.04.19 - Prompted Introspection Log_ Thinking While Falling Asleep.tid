title: 2018.04.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: Thinking While Falling Asleep

!! What do you think about when you can't fall asleep?

Everything. My mind races, loops, grinds, and keeps me up well into the night. I've had this problem now for a long time. Getting sleep has been a war. I've tried all the standard habits and tricks for a long time. People who don't have this affliction clearly do not understand, fail to empathize, and generally resort to the usually disgusting Otherizing commonly targeting the neural-atypicals. And, to you, tit-for-tat-failers, I serve it right back (fuck off).

I try not to think when I'm trying to sleep. I give myself about 15 minutes while being awake, and if I can't sleep, I get up and do something productive until I feel sleepy enough to try again. I try to lose focus into a diffuse mode. I often use cartoons I'm extremely familiar with to suspend my disbelief to the point of losing awareness, dropping into my limbic system's automatic mode. I get to a point where I drift in and out, and my last effort is to turn the screen off, take my glasses off, then finally lose the earbud. 

In short, I'm thinking about not thinking when I can't fall asleep. That is my goal.
