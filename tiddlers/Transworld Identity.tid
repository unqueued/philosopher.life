title: Transworld Identity

Transworld identities snaking across possible worlds are necessary for freewill. If anything is up to us, then what we do and who we are must possibly be otherwise. I cannot speak to the nature of time, let alone the nature of time as it pertains to networking possible worlds, however, it appears that at least some persistent identities across possible worlds are temporal, causally-related, and at least semi-rigidly designatable. 

We are fleshing out [[Saint Aristotle]]'s distinction between potentiality and actuality of particulars necessary for freedom. We also run into the standard metaphysical problematics of identity, including the essentialism of what it means to be some particular. Transworld identities are committed to identifying specially-related objects within various possible worlds (including the actual) with at least a single transworld identity outside those possible worlds. 

I cannot fathom how to talk about necessary and possible transworlds. What is the [[SO]] state-of-affairs of the the various [[FO]] states of affairs? Furthermore, transworld identities appear to also possibly be contingent. Mind-bendingly, for me, transworld identities might also have transworld identities. The [[infinigress]] is perhaps absurd.

At any given timeslice, my [[phenomenology]] is always in the actual possible world (even if I only attend to semblematic representations corresponding to the external world). Freewill requires an identity that holds between objects in distinct worlds. Since I assume freewill, I assume I'm an object which exists in more than one possible world. Objectively, excepting how [[The Good]] determines values of a world, there is nothing ontologically special about the actual world, this is just the indexed world in which I find myself. Subjectively, however, the actual world holds a special [[phenomenological]] status to me because I helped choose it and bring it into being. I see no reason to call possible worlds abstract entities. The realism of possibility seems to prima facie point to some variant of modal realism.

It appears reasonable to speak of the passage of time within a possible world; even deterministic states of affairs can be computed and experience change. So, thus far, I'm convinced we only need to invoke possibility when we mean to talk about how a state of affairs could be otherwise, but I'm fine with arbitrarily growing the number of possible worlds for other problems. 

There is an explosiveness to possibility, and I simply cannot know how far it extends. Ultimately, I just don't understand continuity and infinitesimals. I remain open to the possibility that there uncountably infinitely many possible worlds across which each our of transworld identities are spread.

What does it mean to relate two transworld identities? Are their transworld identities not an emergent identity? It appears so. Still, it appears to be uncountably many possible worlds, but a subset of two overlapping. 

I am not so worried about the [[FO]] possible world objects of transworld identities having not only different but even inconsistent properties. However, I fear there is a descriptivist and essentialist problem at stake here. We can break our essence down into spacetime and modal stages, as though these are modes of our identities. Kripke's concern with the descriptivist cluster may still arise. I simply don't know if every particular has all its intrinsic properties essentially.
