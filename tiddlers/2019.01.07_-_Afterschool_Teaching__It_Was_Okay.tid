title: 2019.01.07 - Afterschool Teaching: It Was Okay

Whitney is gone this week. I was surprised Matt showed up since he has found a way to get paid for not being there for an hour each day (but that has been pushed back to starting next week). I prepped, took the 5th and 6th grades, learned more names, and helped students with their homework. Apparently, I'm the only adult there comfortable doing algebra and geometry. They send them my way now. Cool.

I had a new fella' show up. He's not a good kid, but we'll figure it out.

Eventually, I moved to the computer lab and spoke with Dorsey. He wrote a letter for me to his boss. I am not holding my breath. The dude couldn't type or use a mouse. He compared TW to a Google site designed for schools (hard to explain all the differences to someone who can't or won't be interested).

I spent the evening tutoring. I'm glad. Those kids needed my help. We walked through ambiguities in the questions in one of the textbooks, and I tried to give another look at their mathematics (since they pass by simply memorizing a rule, but they cannot reason about why or what it really means). 

I filled my paperwork out. `/sigh` The amount of lies in this place is preposterous.
