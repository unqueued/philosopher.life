title: Meaningness: Stances trump systems

<<<
Mostly, people think about thinking about meaning in terms of systems. (By “systems,” I mean religions, philosophies, political ideologies, psychological frameworks, and so on.) But I think that is not how we actually think about meaningness.
<<<

A bold claim, and as usual, one you aren't likely to give serious support. Can you please tell me what it means to "think" about something not in terms of a "system?" I would argue, all thought is sequential, systematic, and that you have no idea what you are talking about. You are clearly engaging in philosophy here, bordering more on religious psychology each page, since you clearly do it so poorly. 

You may be claiming we are pointing to systems outside ourselves, and that's the problem. But, what do you call your work? Is it not systematic? Why do you think you are exceptional? You aren't.

<<<
It seems to me that this is a mistake. In practice, when we actually need to make decisions, we do it mainly on the basis of stances, not systems.
<<<

Umm...stances are systematic. 

<<<
Stances are simple, compelling patterns of thinking and feelings concerning meaningness.
<<<

See, a "pattern" just is a system.

<<<
“Really” is a weasel-word. It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims. When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?”
<<<

You hypocritically fail this test. I give you a great deal of latitude because this topic is really hard. Unfortunately, you're making the same kinds of errors. It's very annoying.

<<<
Many professed Christians say that “all is one, really”—the stance of monism—which goes against the central teaching of Christianity...
Monism is the confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth.
<<<

I'm far more familiar with Christian history and thought than you are. I think categorizing it into something monolithic is far more difficult than you imagine here. You're correct in many ways. I just want to point out that it's not a clearcut as you seem to imply.

<<<
Systems are big, complicated things with lots of details you are supposed to believe and do. Systems have salespeople, who argue passionately in their favor.
<<<

Oh, c'mon. You are a saleperson right now, selling a system of thought.

<<<
Confused stances are insidious, because they are unnoticed. Because no one argues for them, no one argues against them. They are memes, mental viruses that people propagate by talking, without awareness of them.
<<<

I very much appreciate memetics. I don't think they are unnoticed. I think people are systematic enough in their reasoning about these systems. They aren't meta, philosophical, curious, and effective. People clearly argue for and against them. You're misrepresenting the issue or quite undereducated. Unfortunately, I don't see how you don't have a "confused stance" either (even on your own definition, fool).

<<<
Systems can help stabilize particular stances. Christianity, for instance, tries to stabilize eternalism—the idea that everything has a definite meaning given by God.
<<<

Very poor strawman. Definite meaning is thought to co-exist with God. God didn't make 2+2=4 (except for a few wackjobs who went that far, but most do not). How can you expect me to give you charity when you can't do it for others?

All that said, stability is not unreasonable here. Trying to a cogent system that makes sense is likely the case. I will be interested to see if you think you escape the "stability" problem of cogency.

<<<
Its detailed ideology provides support for this idea. If you are Christian and wobbling out of eternalism, it provides things to say to yourself to counteract that.
<<<

Agreed. In other words, they are either significant viral memes that keep you addicted, or they may be (charitably speaking) actual justifications (which, btw, you are completely failing to provide for your own systematic account of meaning).
