* Wait to shop. One more day.
* Letters, sir.
* She's a bit calmer, but it will probably go up and down.
** Friday appears like it will be a bigger day to think on.
* Remember to have an emotional connection with your beer tomorrow.
** Maybe a sonnet?
* Hold your superstitious baseball pose as it seems to be working (don't forget to touch the doorknob three times and twerk for 10 minutes before eating lunch). `/fingers-crossed`, I hope they continue to kick butt in school (and making at least some semblance of output progress).
* Walk and talk with yourself.
** Uh, and you need to go walk and talk wiff yo wife <3
