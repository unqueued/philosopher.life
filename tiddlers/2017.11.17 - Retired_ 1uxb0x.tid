!! About:

//My son, brother in autism.//

I will love you forever. I am sorry for your pain. Forgive me and yourself. Do your best. You are a beautiful, wonderful person. You aren't perfect, and neither am I. There is hope, son. Let's work together.

Remember: Everyday is a new day. We program ourselves. Life can get better. We just have to try. Never give up. 

* [[Our Son: The Conqueror of Happiness]]

!! Body:

My son is damaged, and it is largely my fault, both genetically and memetically. My son does not believe in himself, he does not have much hope, and he is a boy in pain. Not every circumstance is in my control, but I can see how I have significantly contributed to his suffering. 

I must help him become happy. I must give him hope. I must protect him. I must cultivate him. I must be a good rolemodel for him. I must empathize with him deeply. I need to make up for my mistakes, and I can. It may never be perfect, in fact, it could be a series of crises, but I must. My son needs me to be a good father or at least the best that I can be.

He is getting happier. I have seen it. Each month averages higher utility for him. He slowly blossoms. I will cultivate my flower, and he will help cultivate himself too. Hope shines brighter.

!! Dreams:

* When my daughter can't come up with practical objects to make or fix, I give her ideas. I need to find ways to do the same for my son.
