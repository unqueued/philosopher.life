title: 2019.07.07 - Prompted Introspection: Laughcry

!! Tell about a time you laughed until you cried.

I answered this before: [[2018.02.28 - Prompted Introspection Log: Laughed Until I Cried]]. It's been a while since I laughed until I cried. I laugh, and I cry; they aren't connected often enough these days. I think I feel more dead, wiped out, despairing, and desperate though. There is always [[hope]].
