hey, you off work today?
Mon 9:58 AM
 I'm going to call in a favor.
Mon 11:40 AM
 I am considering reaching out to my donors. Not sure if I should, and I'm not sure how I should do it. I'd like your digested advice. Give me something to think on. Be prepared for me to wrestle with your claim, please. Take your time in formulating your thoughts, please.

Called me immediately. Good to hear his voice.

He asked why. I gave him my reasons. He was vehemently against it.

We talked about his therapy and job. 

A co-worker of his is having a very time, and he invited her on a date (he's a gay man, so not romantic) to a very fancy restaurant (ridiculously fancy). Super cool.

I'm glad my brother is enjoying a social life. He deserves one! =)
