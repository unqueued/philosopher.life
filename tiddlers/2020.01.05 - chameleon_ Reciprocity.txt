[6:42 PM] chameleon: Feel like I should reciprocate for a little while ago

[6:42 PM] chameleon: Tell me when you get it so I can delete it
[10:55 AM] h0p3: Good to see you! :slight_smile:
[10:56 AM] h0p3: Sorry, I've been ridiculously afk (still don't have our stuff or interwebs yet). Making sure we are set for basics. k0sh3k begins work tomorrow, and I won't have a vehicle.
[5:03 PM] chameleon: Oh jeeze
[5:05 PM] chameleon: I'm not fond of moving haha. We should be settled where I am now for the forseeable future
[5:09 PM] h0p3: Me neither, especially moving internationally. I strongly prefer to be settled, though I don't really have significant roots. Even without roots though, stability is excellent.
[7:19 PM] h0p3: How's your day going?
[7:19 PM] h0p3: Messed around looking at black and green knights for standard on the way up here. You been working on that deck?
[7:21 PM] chameleon: not too bad
[7:21 PM] chameleon: yeah, hubby completed it the other day
[7:21 PM] chameleon: should be playing it this friday
[7:21 PM] h0p3: Noice.
[7:23 PM] h0p3: I'm a fan of: https://www.tcdecks.net/

[7:23 PM] h0p3: Don't know if there are better tools now (wouldn't be surprised), but it's nice for netdeckers and Spikes.
