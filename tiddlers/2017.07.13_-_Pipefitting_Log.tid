title: 2017.07.13 - Pipefitting Log

Today was a more sane pace. I didn't take serious breaks, or rather, I ran errands on them, but I also had times where I could chill for a second. I wasn't pushing absolutely as hard as I could the entire time. I had some breathing room, and I'm grateful for that.

Jaye beat me there today, and we both beat Terry and his sons by almost half an hour. I immediately started working on the screwpipe sections for the second spool, the hot water return. We couldn't do much until Terry unlocked everything for us.

When he arrived, he gave me a speech about making sure my welder was always welding, but also to make sure my welder wasn't welding in position. Jaye, of course, doesn't prefer in-position but thought it was crazy to expect me to not have him weld in position. Terry went on to brag that his son already had 2 pieces to weld this morning for him. I wanted to reply that I also had multiple pieces ready this morning, but I couldn't get Jaye started because everything was locked up. This would not have been useful. Terry is not interested in rational arguments. He seemed to ignore what I had done right and that his own advice was already being followed in many respects. The in-position welds were also the result of his own command on the first day, given how he told me how to construct it. I don't understand why I am held accountable for the mistake built into his own command. He is not rational, or he is malicious, guaranteed lacking charity, and perhaps a mixture of them all. His goal is to put me in my place. I can only continue to be humble. Admittedly, I have tons to learn. 

Terry still doesn't like my work. Nothing will please him, I think. He's grumpy, even with his own sons. That's okay. Even if I get fired, which I'm not anticipating anymore, this has been an amazing learning experience. By the end of next week, it will be a school that has paid for itself. I like getting paid to learn. That's the kind of life I want to lead. At least he is calm in mannerism. I can deal with an asshole. As long as my AB&T tools come through, I'll have a chance to land another job and make an even better run. That said, I believe I'll be able to stay at this one as long as I want. I really do hope to find one closer to home, but this will do just nicely until then.

My morning was slow because I was waiting on Jaye to finish welds I had set up for him the previous day. I actually couldn't make a ton more progress until he was done. I pieced together the second spool on the floor. The column was good to go, but I had to wait on measurements for the nipples that fit the flanges.

During the break, I picked up some antibiotic anti-burn cream for my face. The pus globbed everywhere. I had to clean it at least a dozen times. It was gross, painful, got in the way, and didn't help with social situations. I strictly used my hood during welds. I will continue to do so from now on.

After the first spool was finished today, we jumped into fitting the second. The fit-ups went more smoothly this time. My level is absolutely possessed. It doesn't work well. $2 levels aren't worth it. I need another, desperately. It is very hard to do anything right without one. Thankfully, I had my digital protractor, which made it feasible. I'm working without a ton of tools I really need.

I'm reminded that Travis, the second son, continues to, as my brother calls it, "Bird-dog" me by continually playing spy for his father. He comes by every hour to check on my progress, to try and find dirt, and report to his father. Seriously, every single thing I say or that is seen gets back to his father, even the mundane. I had asked Travis directly if his father was annoyed by my lack of experience. Probably not worth it. I didn't realize I was being bird-dogged until later in the day. 

Travis doesn't do fitting exactly, it's a mix of screwpipe and HVAC for these specialized water systems. He showed me what he does. He doesn't want to learn the general artform, but intends to specialize he told me. Uh huh. Go general first, then specialize.

Travis continued to prod me to see if I'm actually able to fit throughout the day. e.g. I lack a wraparound, and I had to use paper. He saw this and thought he could do better. So, he did the wrap with the paper, and then it didn't come out very nicely. Lol. Ummm, no shit. I'm working with what I have. Terry eventually found out, as I asked him for one at the end of the day. This reflects poorly on me, of course, because any real pipefitter would already have one. Lol.

Travis also rifled through my pipefitter book, which is fairly rude. It's not his stuff. For half a second, he may have respected me. He called it oldschool. I was then able to explain what I had said to him yesterday about fabricating pipe. Of course, they never do it he said, and as I said yesterday since they just purchase all their fittings.

Oh, Travis also came by to talk some shit about my flange being too close to another pipe. Mind you, I'm duplicating what Terry told me to duplicate (well, it can't be identical because our starting positions aren't identical, but they are structurally analogous in a strong way). We talked about it, and I found out that these pipes will be fitted with insulation. I didn't know because nobody told me, although it makes perfect sense. We got his dad to talk about it since even Terry has less than a centimeter of clearance (as I pointed out to Travis). Terry eventually came, and he said it was fine. The insulators could "cheat" on this one he said because it was the hot water pipe. We went to see his own work, and he saw I was doing the same. 

Travis also had the nerve to say (repeating his father, ofc), that I was stovepiping on my first spool. Well, no shit, Sherlock. I was against Terry's method from the beginning. I took the speech from yesterday to mean I had free reign to do it my way. This time, we made the entire spool on the stand. The absolute opposite of stovepiping. If I get anything wrong, nothing works (I checked along the way). Of course, at the end of the day, Terry didn't like that either. I walked up on him and his boys talking shit about our work, but they were kinder once they saw me. Now he has given me a different task (which makes more sense than his previous command). He wants me to put a flange on a pipe, and then make a column, and then tack the pipes to the column, then dismount and do the full weld. This will work nicely, especially since I don't have two-holes (which I've not told him yet either, I'm just cheating with bolts and my worthless demonic level). His argument was that it would be harder for my welder to weld the flanges on the stand (which is obviously not true). I will do it his way, even if I get shit from both sides for it. At the very least, it is practice and a chance to see why or why not I like these various approaches, oh, and I'm getting paid money for it.

For lunch, I ran to the office to set up direct deposit. It won't come through for another week. So, I'll have a paper check to deal with at least once more. I talked to Ben, the boss of Barry I believe. Ben has spiked hair, is a bit older than me (not much, I think), and talks a lot of shit. He called millennials the entitled generation (Ben might himself be a millennial, lol). He says nobody wants to work (again, a fool), that they think everything should be handed to them on a platter. He laments having such a hard time finding pipefitters. What he really means to say is that he can't find pipefitters willing to take what he wants to pay them. If he really needed them, he could train them. His Republican politics were disgusting. He talked the talk, but this man has never labored in his life. He readily admits his privilege but refuses to do what it takes to empathize. Psychopath all over the place. I legitimately hope he dies in a fire (even if I could never do that to him, I would not be sad if it happened to him). 

My teacher called me during lunch too. That dude has been in my corner, I tell you what. I do owe him brownies and ale.

In any case, we almost finished the second spool today. I used the oxy torch to cut holes. One was better than the other. I think I surprised them that I could use the torch at all, and even further that I had the gear for it. They do not use it safely. No outerwear, shades, and they leave the gas on permanently. =/ This is the second time I've seen them do something which doesn't follow OSHA standards, and which I consider too important to not follow. I'm pleased with our work, and so is Jaye.

I've started measuring and planning for the "clown" spools. They made more mistakes than I realized today. Not only is the cold water return (or is it supply?) valve/regulator sections on the top upside down, but it's on the wrong spool! I'm going to have a scissor lift tomorrow and a harness to take them down. 

I am convinced that Terry is highly tribal, and I'm out of his group. Further, I believe he doesn't give objective advice about pipefitting but is instead invested in thinking about how we do pipefitting for his sons, particularly Jacob. That seems to color his perceptions, from what I can tell. Terry and his boys take breaks, but we are discouraged from doing so. The same for showing up early and leaving late. He's a foreman. I am not surprised. 

I think it annoys him that his boys have been doing this for years aren't getting the pay or opportunity that I have, or that it demonstrates that he is holding them back. It doesn't appear they get their own welder and do fitting on their own. Apparently, it runs in their family. Travis was telling me that everyone should be a helper, according to his grandfather, for 10 years before they become a fitter. Travis and Jacob are plainly being used by their father. 

All this said, I'm somehow oddly grateful for the chance to learn with Terry. I have learned quite a bit. Experience is experience. This is stuff I simply couldn't do in the shop. They are leaving early tomorrow, leaving Jaye and I to work alone. I'm thinking about slow rolling the morning a bit so that I finish a lot of work while they are gone. My brother thinks that they will lack the charity to have paid attention enough in the first place. We will see. That might be right. I despise manipulation, but these people are not moral in their approach. As usual, I'm generally disgusted with humanity (or the vast majority of it [so, find the others!])

I am so grateful to have a friend in Jaye. Having a single person I get along with on the job is amazing, and we click more than merely getting along. We're definitely different people, but I don't mind it. I get to be myself around Jaye. I love it. 

I just realized "Jaye" is short for Jihad, lol. Also, his son (a twin) has leukemia. That's why he doubts his faith, I'm betting. I asked if his mom was a black panther. He said yes, from Oakland in the '80s.
