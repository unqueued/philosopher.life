title: 2018.09.27 - KMEC: Double Standard

You know far too much not to see what's epistemically unacceptable about your beliefs and what's immoral about your actions (Oh, I KNOW how smart you are...and that's exactly why I hold you so very responsible). It really has just become the most convenient route for you to herd people and leech off them. You're excellent salesmen, but you aren't peddling anything even close to the truth (you don't value the truth either...you explicitly think it's better not to be reasonable, particularly if it will align someone to your interests). I'm not convinced that is who you always were, particularly in your 20's. What the fuck happened to you? Your 30's showed the classic selfish shift though, and each decade continues to show it stronger and stronger. You really didn't even fight it in yourselves.

For example, it's pretty unfortunate how often you railed against a society that made it quite difficult for those who had children. You often talked about how those who needed the money the most (young people with children) were the least likely to have the resources necessary. You no apply that rule, among many others, in your religion, politics, and family life. I think you've conveniently switched standards. I see who and what you are really committed to these decades. You tell yourselves some powerful fictions.

You really did teach your children to hate themselves to your benefit. 

The funny part is that if you wanted me to relax, you'd have to do the same. You'd have to take my own quasi-religious calling just as seriously as I've taken yours. Of course, that will cost you a great deal. You know I'd shred you too. Easier just to abandon your sons, right? Throw them over the city walls if they are not Samuel. Let them rot. It has been quite painful to realize that you've seen it coming the entire time too; you've even planned for this! To walk back through our many conversations and come to understand your gaslighting has been horrifying.

You are less than garbage. You are lucky I throw you away instead of burning you. [[T42T]] with me will be quite a climb for you. Each passing year is more evidence against you. My advisers have been correct to prevent me from even attempting peacetalks yet again. They are coming to see what I have seen. I will continue to seal you.
