title: 2019.04.26 - TWGGF: URL Input

I'm sorry that I don't even know how to ask this question correctly. Is there a way to create a temporary or arbitrary doorway into TW with "input" from the URL? I have no idea if this is possible, but perhaps it may be something most people already know how to do. I'm clueless.

* I would like to embed a search term or filter expression into a link to my wiki which would show the results.

Links don't seem to work here, but they do work...
