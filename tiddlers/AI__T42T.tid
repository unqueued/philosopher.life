title: AI: T42T

I think if you want to defeat the [[T4T]] nash distributions in AlphaStar, you need to build on the [[T42T]] principle. Nodes/agents have to learn how to cooperate with each other in sharing their strategies. GIA is about efficiency. For example, can I spend X amount of compute power up front to make it so each of you can benefit from my trained model with only Y compute power? What can we do with a single GPU for each person on the planet?
