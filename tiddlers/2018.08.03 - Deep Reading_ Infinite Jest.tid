Tony's running scene makes no sense to me. 

What am I missing? Perhaps I am not trying hard enough, perhaps I am not skilled enough. This book is puzzling, but in fully solvable way. I fear the book isn't supposed to make sense in the end, that this is a waste. This isn't about denoument or non-linearity directly; it's some other post-modern concerns, as usual.

This book is not a fatal pleasure. I am 75% of the way through...

I've decided I want Orin's balls of steel, in a way.
