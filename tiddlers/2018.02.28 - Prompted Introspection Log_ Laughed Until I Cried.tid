title: 2018.02.28 - Prompted Introspection Log: Laughed Until I Cried

!! Tell about a time you laughed until you cried.

The //It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia// Outtakes and Bloopers reels the first 3 times I went through them. When I need to just release and have a pick me up, when the world is absurd and painful to the point that I don't want to exist in it, getting drunk and watching these videos have caused me to laugh until I cried. I hate to say it, but it has probably saved my life multiple times.

I take my media extremely seriously. I'm obsessed with it (common among autists). I have watched most shows in my [[Television Show Collection]] have been an absurd number of times. Dealing with the Redpilled description of the world, wrestling with our humanity, and the farce of our existence is not easy. The exploration of failure is clearly important to me because I feel like a failure. Many of my shows, including IASIP, is about the failure of humankind.

Watching bloopers and outtakes somehow makes a show I've watched a dozen times enter into a new world, the real one, where I see the actors peel apart from their characters. Of course, it is failure that pulls them away from this world and out of character, but ironically that ability to peel apart reality (or the necessity of it) shows they appreciate what they've built. I have even more respect for their work after the bloopers. I admire the failures in and out of the world they create. Somehow, it gives me hope.
