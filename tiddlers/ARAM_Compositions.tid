title: ARAM Compositions

What makes an amazing ARAM composition?

* Wins attrition wars
** Healing and shields
** Poke and invisible sources of damage
* Seiges turrets effectively
** Strong zoning
** Safe turret damage
* Strong CC, catch, and wombo potential

!! Tier 1 Compositions:

* Perfect
** Sona - Heals yeah, but broken shields. Damage and CC. The whole package. Wins unwinnable fights and is obscenely oppressive while ahead.
** Ziggs - Best combination of wave clear and seige tools. Plays amazing while you are ahead and almost as well when you are behind
** Swain - Frontline draintank mage with solid wave clear. Build defensively and consistently bait teams. 
** Sion - The only AD tank worth playing in ARAM, initiation, amazing wave clear for a tank, he has enormous flexibility in his build and playstyle for whatever the context may be, and he can abuse death.
** Kog'Maw - The premier hypercarry, hybrid options to boot, comes online before all the other hypercarries (pure tempo), extreme reach, and he can abuse death. 

* Tank for Days - Imagine facing the all AD or all AP team. In this context, we will have gods. Strong enough they could arguably 4v5. 
** Maokai - Soon to be nerfed, sadly
** Sion - Need dat AD
** Galio - Amazing before his remake, amazing after his remake
** Illaoi - Imho, more annoying than Teemo. Pure cancer.
** Swain - Not traditionally conceived of as a tank, but clearly plays that role when built correctly.
