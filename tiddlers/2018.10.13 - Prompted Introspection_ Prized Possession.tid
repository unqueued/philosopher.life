title: 2018.10.13 - Prompted Introspection: Prized Possession

!! What is your most prized possession?

My wif...wait, I won't get laid if I finish the silent letter. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to prize the most. I'd like to think I am my most prized possession.

I believe we have profound, intricate moral Hohfeldian rights networks to each other. Basically, I deny that we own ourselves all the way down. To whatever extent I own Humanity in the moral sense, to whatever extent I am constitutive and constituted by it, that may be it. I realize that sounds awful to most ears, but I also don't think they understand the implications of what we owe to each other.
