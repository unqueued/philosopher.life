The Four Dog Defense:

# First of all, I don't have a dog.
# And if I had a dog, it doesn't bite.
# And if I had a dog and it did bite, then it didn't bite you.
# And if I had a dog and it did bite, and it bit you, then you provoked the dog.

This reminds me of the Cratylian point from Gorgias: 

# Nothing exists. 
# Even if something did exist, nothing can be known about it
# and even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it cannot be communicated to others. 
# And, finally, even if it can be communicated, it cannot be understood.
