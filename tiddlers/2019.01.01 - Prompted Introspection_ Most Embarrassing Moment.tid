title: 2019.01.01 - Prompted Introspection: Most Embarrassing Moment

!! What is your most embarrassing moment and why?

Ahha, I have written about this before: [[2017.10.08 - Prompted Introspection Log]]. 

I suppose another aspect worth talking about is that: I'm rarely embarrassed (although, I vividly remember many embarrassing times in my life). I'm absurdly honest, willing to defend myself, and generally think most people don't have the right to criticize me. Think about the things on this wiki that I talk about. That's me IRL too. I aim to have that much integrity. [[Kickscondor]] beautifully analogizes me to Kanye West, and there's something right about it. Yeah, I am a braggadocious asshole in many respects (even if it has been a necessary tool in others).

I am most easily embarrassed when I lack fitting humility that eventually has consequences that could and should have been avoided (even though motivation obviously can be failure enough). Even when no one can see it but me, I know that mistake was mine. I have profound disagreements with people to the point that we can barely see eye-to-eye on what merits shame in most cases. Embarrassment is a form to shame to me, and I think it can be private and hypotheticalized too.
