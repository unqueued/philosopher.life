title: 2019.04.10 - Prompted Introspection: Courageous Person

!! Who is one of the most courageous people you have ever met? Why?

I have responded to this before: [[2018.01.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: Courageous]], and there are even post-facto footnotes from [[The Remodeling]]. 

I think my brother [[JRE]] is incredibly courageous. He has been burned badly many times in his life, and he still gets up in the morning and fights the good fight. He is, of course, a skeptical man (and rightfully so), but he also shoots to be constructive and charitable. 

I'm continually impressed by his courage and patience at work. He educates and defends people and moral practice even when it requires sacrificing his social capital, standing, and ability to keep working with a crew. He makes a union an actual union, and they have no idea how lucky they are to have him.

My brother builds his beliefs and identity, and that is in the face of profound loss and tribulation. I've seen him change his mind with integrity too. I am always surprised by how open he is to reasoning. It take a lot of courage to risk spending emotional and cognitive resources to be as existentially aware as my brother. Being a [[good]] man is painful, and he's been courageous in his journey. I admire his willingness to be lost and not freak out. He's a pillar to those around him.
