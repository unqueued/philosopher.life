title: 2019.05.04 - Wiki Review: Dat Bastard

* [[Being A Heathen Nazi There]]
** I have a feeling this one will continue to grow. What a grandmaster (nazi)!
*** Some of those quotes make me want to vomit. How could my teacher say these things? It fucking kills me inside. Muh heroes, zomg.
* [[Philosopher]]
** Duh doy! Rofl. I'm so retarded.
* [[Recurring Patterned Redistributivism]]
** Shiny. Maybe on second pass I can clear it up. At the moment, I just need to have anything.
* [[2019.05.03 - Afterschool Teaching: Chill]]
** This one was brief. I think I prefer when I write it at school, after school, and finish the next day.
* [[2019.05.03 - Wiki Review: 20%]]
** I love how [[T-Money]] also thinks it's hilarious that I get "hives from life." Love the irritation on my penis though; it heightens the experience.
* [[2019.05.03 - TDL: Try To Chill]]
** They did get freetime, but not a huge break. 
** Wife's headache, the rain, the red tide, the stress: dates with me are intense, best avoid them in such cases.
* [[2019.05.03 - Prompted Introspection: Most Interesting Person in My World]]
** I'm pretty sure I mostly cause disgust in her, roflmao.
*** My daughter needs a Goku figure metaphor, btw. I hate Buffy. Need one, preez.
* [[2019.05.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Tasked]]
** Okay, weekly Zlam? That was a bitchin' Friday, yo.
*** It's interesting to see it relived me enough to pump me up in another way. Does a benzo have a paradoxical reaction in me?
* [[2019.05.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Democratic Postulate]]
** Let me say this: I know I wrote that. Gah. It sounds like me. That bastard.
