Hey, how's your weekend going?
10 HR AGO
How was the show?
10 HR AGO
It was a little disappointing honestly-- although I was just in a funk the whole day for some reason, so maybe not a fair appraisal
10 HR AGO
Got my new phone in, trying to do another 4 hour transfer between phones, since the first one failed last night
10 HR AGO
so hopefully will get to call you via phone tonight!
10 HR AGO
Sorry about the funk. =(
10 HR AGO
Did Rebecca enjoy it?
10 HR AGO
I would be super annoyed by 4 hour transfers. I hope it works tonight, that would be neat.

My brother didn't have a blast, but he was feeling grumpy. Perhaps it was because he was going to visit our donors solo. I listened carefully, and my brother knows what I think before he tells me. I will continue to think with him. 

He rehashed the previous letter, and got some stuff off his chest in front of them.

When my brother told them he wasn't a Christian, the first thing my female donor said back to him was "I hope you don't kill my grandbabies." It's rhetoric on top of shitty inferences on top of a complete failure to empathize. When he brought this up, she denied it, then she tried to interpret it differently to say those words meant something else. I am reminded of [[this|Dark Triadicisms]]. I too have called them out on clear memories, and they've made similar denials and then slides (for a simple example, they said if they were Tony, they would have pursued legal custody of [[ALM]] and [[Jop]]'s children if there were any attempts to move away to Thailand). I will trust her words when her actions match.

They continue to lie to him about the abuse of layered communications.  

Sounds like they tag-teamed him. They further claimed to be charitable and denied we have been. Wow. That is a stunning gaslight, and I suggest the possibility it is triangulation. I will continue to be living proof to my brothers that our donors have no intention of seeking accountable resolution, taking responsibility for themselves and the damage they've caused, or legitimately empathizing with our own positions (they certainly cannot repeat mine in any recognizable way back to me). I explained to him that any parent who would brainwash their children down to this level had, at the very least, a duty to listen carefully all the way back down to that level in fundamental disagreement. Their sins have generated quite a debt to their sons.

When they say that just don't feel like they can say the right thing, what's really happening is they can't find a way to not take responsibility. They aim to act like it's our fault that we have strong reactions to their words and decades of cultic brainwashing. They have no intention of giving any credence to what they trigger, and their goal is to deny the validity of our experience without transparent and verifiable reason. It's not like they couldn't fix it; it's that they don't want to. They don't actually give a shit. 

They, of course, reminded my brother that they will need someone to look after them in their old age. 

I have no idea what he aims to accomplish, but if he feels confident in the risk, it's sufficiently valuable to him, and it's morally permissible, I cannot argue against it. I can't say I understand it at all, but maybe that's what he needs. He has ruled out the "have my cake and eat it too," but it sounds like he went in there with his eyes open.

We talked about prudential epistemic justifications and psychological egoism.

My god, my paternal male granddonor is married to an illegal immigrant. His hypocrisy knows no bounds. The vile, racist, classist bullshit he spews is too much.

Other than that, my brother is trying a new game out in VR. What was cool about it was that the physics in the game would ignore the player's movements in some cases for realism's sake. Like, you can flick your hand in some games and it will flick the sword, but this one would ignore such movement as not a legal possibility given the physics.

My brother told me about a schizophrenic who said she fairs better when she doesn't point out what she is hallucinating to others. We both found that fascinating. 

My brother asked me about my work. I'm glad to be able to talk about it with him. I often don't know what I'm doing.
