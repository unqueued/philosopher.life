I'm sorry he wasn't easy to work with and having to work through multiple states. It sounds like there is a lot to work through.

I called Carmen’s sister (his next of kin) and told her he needs care
Dec 18, 2019 3:28pm
He won’t be happy with me at all
Dec 18, 2019 3:28pm
There are limits to your obligations. I think that makes sense. I'm sorry he won't be happy.
Dec 18, 2019 3:29pm
This is a helluva month for your family.
Dec 18, 2019 3:29pm
Me too but I have no way to force care on him —I don’t live there
Dec 18, 2019 3:29pm
Yeah but I have loving and supportive family so it’s better than it could be
