hey, I'm going to call at ~6 today.
THU 11:54 AM
Phone ran out of battery!
THU 8:04 PM
The problem with virtue theorists I've seen is that they take up the postmodern view that nothing can or should be codified at all. They give up on the possibility of computing [[The Moral Law]] entirely. They don't see that even our [[fff]] limitations are taken into account into our obligations for messily, quickly, and finitely making moral computations.
THU 8:05 PM
Kant and many Kantians I know are opposed to particularizing our maxims too far because it requires accepting the fact that we are all in unique contexts, and it doesn't allow us to generate definitive rules that apply in every single persons context nearly as cleanly as we'd have liked.
THU 8:06 PM
By particularizing maxims so far, we might get universal law, but it is a law that only applies to a person in your exact shoes.
THU 8:07 PM
I think that skepticism of generalizability is ridiculous though. Rule-Utility as a heuristic seems like a good example.
THU 8:08 PM
A cop isnt prosecuted for shooting an unarmed black man because he "felt like he was in legitimate danger" but his failure to develop empathy  to shape his quick brain calculations has skewed his perception of the presence of danger, thus he is responsible for murder for not actively retraining his "implicit bias"
THU 8:09 PM
It turns out that [[salient]] information in maxim doesn't have to go all the way down to every particular...there are likely an infinite number of maxims that share a great deal in common that have no functional difference from your particular context.
THU 8:09 PM
Preach, yo!
THU 8:10 PM
I had an energy drink after work.
THU 8:11 PM
Lol. =)
THU 8:11 PM
I feel much more present right now, perhaps if it doesnt interfere with my sleep i might take caffeine after work more often :grinning_face_with_star_eyes:
THU 8:12 PM
This maxim particularization problem is a deep rabbithole, imho. It turns out that we have to ask some tough questions about the extent to which that cop was capable of understanding and modifying his own implicit biases at any given timeslice.
THU 8:12 PM
That is what I meant to say: you feel present.
THU 8:12 PM
Much better ring than "you sound a lot smarter today"  rofl
THU 8:12 PM
His culpability for that murder comes in degrees too, and even our ability to determine his culpability from the outside will come in [[dok]].
THU 8:13 PM
Rofl!
THU 8:13 PM
I shouldnt put that in quotes, since you didnt actually say that
THU 8:13 PM
Lol
THU 8:13 PM
You have a hilarious interpretative style. It's teasing, paranoic, and still helps the other person shape the claim more effectively than before.
THU 8:15 PM
Yeah, it would be hard to legislate that-- suddenly we have to make comparisons between actual statistics about the groups a person might be identified with versus the persons perception of that group.  Imagine how that would suck as stats adjust.  Or imagine the pressure being apart of that group-- we need to lower the crime rate of men, so that if someone attacks us based on our being a man, they can be held responsible for having inaccurate perceptions about the threat our group posed to them
THU 8:19 PM
Anyway
THU 8:19 PM
I gotta go make something to eat, i think ill be doing the basement tomorrow, so if we talk tomorrow, it will be a short call
THU 8:20 PM
Love yah!
THU 8:20 PM
K, good luck, love you!
THU 8:20 PM
Also, I forgot to say it: the show is amazing.
THU 8:56 PM
Thank you!
THU 8:56 PM

We talked for several hours. His shop is taking a lot of work, but I think it is a zen toolporn garden. 

He is feeling far happier with the new social worker and having more information. They are still unsure why they haven't been given a young kid. 

We talked about the implications of open letter writing.

He talked about facial recognition analysis of my ASCII Face Portrait.

My brother walked me through different options for this hole in the wall. I'm going to have to hide it since the maintenance workers know it shouldn't be there. I'm also going to have patch it when we leave. There's no way around it.

We talked about what we'd say to 10yo us. One of them was about cleaning our assholes. I explained that I tell my children to clean every part of themselves like someone they wanted to bang was going to lick it. My brother and I talked about wiping and post-orgasm pissing techniques for about half an hour. That man gets me.

We talked about a lesbian he works with whose father beats people with bats. She hates oysters. My brother was quiet. Tartar and cocktail sauce jokes were obligatory. Since the surgery, my brother's gag reflex has improved significantly. 

We started talking about Kant, but my phone died!

He was lively and active in the conversation today.
