title: 2018.12.12 - Be A Good Dad: Power

Power exists to be moral, otherwise what's the point of it? Power that only begets power is conceptually powerless. Power can never have the power to provide meaning to itself. It must always be in the construction and parasitic slave to [[The Moral Law]]. Physics is computationally powerless; it will never be [[The End]] in [[Itself]].
