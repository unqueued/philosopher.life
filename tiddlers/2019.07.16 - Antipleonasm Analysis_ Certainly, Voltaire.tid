title: 2019.07.16 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Certainly, Voltaire

Certainly anyone who has the power to make you believe absurdities has the power to make you commit injustices.

As usual, Voltaire's sentence is not conceptually true or his argument is not valid when we are being careful. For the sake of argument, imagine I could modify one and only one of your beliefs through brain surgery, manipulation, accidental communication, or even innocent but flawed reasoning, including causing you to believe in an absurdity or inconsistency (depends on how you think about The Lottery Paradox, perhaps). Maybe I make you think that `123.2342304582304823048230948 - 1 = 0`, but it doesn't affect anything else (let us assume that even our probabilistic reasoning mechanisms can have this Wittgensteinian rule-following flaw), then I have not affected any of your other beliefs and desires, including any which could cause you to commit an injustice due to my [[power]], at least in one possible world. 

Charity here is going to extend the kinds of absurdities we can be made to believe. It's about recognizing what [[Memetic Warfare]] can really incur. I adore the spirit and sentiment, but it is not exact enough.
