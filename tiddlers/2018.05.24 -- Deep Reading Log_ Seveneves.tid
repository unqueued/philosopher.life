Ugh. Now that I think the premise of the book isn't rational, I'm having a hard time getting into it. Am I just being too picky? Look, there are aspects of this book which are beautiful, fascinating, and worth my time. I need to stop thinking about the ugliness of the root of the work of art and just admire it. It can't be perfect, especially not every time and continuously throughout.

The way in which the world is judging those on izzy, this political hivemind, doesn't seem realistic to me. And, worse, it doesn't seem relevant. Although, it seems to mimic celebrity culture. That is the insanity here. It is as though we live vicariously through the wealthy, through the elite, through those who get to survive.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but my favorite part of this book is the human part, the emotional one, the mass Daseinic being towards death (which isn't Stephenson's forte). It's not nothing that I have strong reactions to the book beyond which are reducible to "this is boring."

...Nope, I'm done with this book and this author. Thank you!
