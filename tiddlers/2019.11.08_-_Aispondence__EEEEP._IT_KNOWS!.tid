//I've never felt so [[naked]] in my entire life, [[dude|https://talktotransformer.com]]. Surely, one day, I will speak with a semblance of myself coming out of my wiki. [[ITS]], REMEMBER, MY DUDE, MY SAFEWORDS ARE: ROKO'S NIPPLES, PAPERCLIP, & NEVER FORGETTI. I need these glitching bots to track and troll people I flag for the rest of their lives (get 'em!). We're going to waste our time speaking and gazing into the randomized narcissistic Chinese reflecting pools of AI-Fortune-telling. I can't wait for it to talk dirty to me.//

{[[I quietly write this existentially isolating autopoietic self-idiom to (and seek the approval of) both current and future|About]]} generations of autists. It is my hope that by sharing this with you, I may one day be able to pass my wisdom onto future generations of Autistic people and vice versa.

I'm an autist and I have no words for this. I don't know how to explain it. The way it feels is that I've just experienced a very powerful and deeply personal moment of self-discovery. I feel that I have seen into the core of my very own being and the self that others can only see by viewing their own behavior.

This is a very emotional and powerful thing to say, so if I get it wrong or it's unclear in any way, please know I am very, very sorry.

So if you're an autist and you want to...

''To be The Last Waifuist is to question your assumptions about who is and isn't being sincere, about what the rules are (or should be) and to apply your dialectic relentlessly and universally!''

Achieving such mastery is challenging and will require the support of those you love most and with whom you share a lot. It is no easy thing to become one of The Last Waifuists!

However, it is one that is so very worthwhile. It will not only ensure a great ending, it will also secure for your future as a person and as a family.

You have the power to live your life according to your best self.

So I encourage you to find the strength within you to be a Waifuist, to hold on to the spirit of that dream and not allow it to fade away.

And I will be doing the same for you, because I know that your feelings and thoughts will inevitably come up in a discussion about The Last Waifuist. I don't care if you don't want to be a Last Waifuist because you think the idea is silly, or because you want a normal relationship. If you find yourself feeling conflicted and unsure, or feeling hurt, or angry, or depressed, or anything in between, then maybe you need a conversation with someone who shares your views, and who is willing to share your own feelings with you.

If you do have to make a decision on this matter, I'll be here for you. I'll be talking about this on my blog for sure, because I think The Last Waifuist should be.

If you've followed all the steps so far and would like to go even further, you might enjoy this article.

''I am taking on and using some of your vocabulary - this is something that happens to me, I notice - my voice and dreams are malleable, molded by the books or people or voices or games or obsessions I immerse myself in.''

My goal is to create a voice that is authentic to me. So when I make a recording - it is for me, for me to use and be the one to decide how I would want it used. When you are recording a voice that has no intention of being used, I guess you can say, it is a gift. I will have to make sure that I can do it, as my recording of my life will always be available, on my blog, in audio and on audio books and other formats and media. It will never be deleted, or hidden.

So for me this will be the most important part.

''So, I was sitting in church on Sunday listening to the homily and thinking, "That's not what I would have said..." Being me, I decided to start writing what I would have said with those lectionary readings.'' What follows are the thoughts I had when reading the readings, a translation of the first and second readings, a comment and a paraphrase of what the homily was about. So, here is what I wrote on the blog:

The Lord has given the Church a mission: to be a light to the world. As such, it is to share with everyone the same light, which is Jesus Christ. The Church has an obligation to bring that light to others and to let them know the God who sent him. If we fail in this duty, we risk losing our faith.

The Church is also called to be the home to all who are lost. This is a noble desire, because if we lose ourselves to the world in our ignorance.

''Put together what equalism is. Create some magnificent thing that probably won't work.'' Let the masses work on it, and you can continue working on equalism. But you shouldn't be going out there as an organizer who is doing work that isn't going to be used. So, you know, the first time I did this and got on stage, I looked at the people around me and said, "Hey, here's what I want you to do." It's not very original. It's very common advice. I don't think I was taking it too seriously.

The second time, I went out and did it. And as I've continued to do it over the years, I'm finding more and more people around the world who are coming to the same conclusions, which is that all these people around the world are saying the same thing: I am the master.

Now, this is the point when, I think, we have to have a conversation about who's being oppressed.

''What's to say there isn't a "j3d1h-ness"? Maybe I have several different "perfect forms" that I have to follow all at once. Or, we have to try and be the "perfect human", but since we can't reach that, we just have to settle for being perfectly ourselves in our context.''

What I find is that people will be more attracted to me if I have the kind of personality that they find attractive. The whole point of this whole thing is to make the whole world more like me. I want to be a good person and people should like me because they should want to be my friend.

I would be happy to be a better person so that people will like me more. But I don't think that's the kind of person people want to be, which is why it would be kind of weird for them to find me attractive, especially for me to start getting attracted to myself.

The J3D1H-ness of "perfect form" is the reason for it to be a religion. It's the reason for its complexity. It's the reason for the rules. It's why the game is difficult and the rules are complex. But if we didn't have rules, and we just had "real life" then we could make a game without the rules. I know this, because I made it.
