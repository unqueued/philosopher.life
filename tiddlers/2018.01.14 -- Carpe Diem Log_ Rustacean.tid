title: 2018.01.14 -- Carpe Diem Log: Rustacean

* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Cannabliss
* Family Time
** We talked for a very long time.
** We've made our New Year Commitments 
** Wikis
*** Everyone did a good job
*** Mine took an absurd amount of time to read.
* Ribs
* Walked with my wife!
* Watched //Corporate// -- Amazing!
* Tried Rust! 
** Insanely simple installation/tooling in a way...I do not miss C++ in this aspect.
* Fireman Time!
* Bed by 1ish? Archer?
