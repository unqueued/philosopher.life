title: 2020.01.15 - Wiki Review: Buttdial is Bootycall

* [[2020.01.14 - Prompted Introspection: Forget The Time]]
** It's okay. At the very least, others (my offspring especially) will have a semblance of the idea of what life is like. Even if I'm a complete fuck-up, they'll have a chance to pick out what matters in the pile of my puke.
* [[2020.01.14 - TDL: Survive]]
** I'm glad that I'm getting so much rest. I'm spending at least half my time just sit-laying. 
* [[2020.01.14 - Wiki Review: Inequality]]
** Completed. Perhaps I need to write specifically on inequality. There is much to say. Having an [[antipleonasm]] to point to might be useful.
* [[2020.01.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Thank The Man]]
** Completed. Sometimes, [[Prompted Introspection]] and personal narrative material makes it way into this log. Anecdote can be necessary though.
* [[2020.01.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Nunchaku]]
** Should probably set up appointments here soon.
* [[2019 - Antipleonasm Analysis]]
** The Yearly Audit seems so far away right now. Too much chaos. I need to feel better.
