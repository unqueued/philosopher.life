You ever hear back about the position you applied for at the library?

She’s nice I guess? She stole my chair so I stole it back

Ah, I got sidetracked. My boss' boss can't open a 7zip file, which is, of course, my fault.
AUG 29 11:56 AM

I'm glad you got your chair back though, lol

Hey [[h0p3]]! Running a session and a one shot tomorrow and Monday respectively. In between that I plan to read and write. :)
AUG 30 2:23 PM
What about you guys?
AUG 30 2:23 PM
Grinding away. Reading and writing. Slowly finishing letters off. I'm taking way longer than I should. The vidja game addiction is strong.
AUG 30 4:54 PM
The usual grind for us. Clean the house, family time, and whatever fun my offspring choose to have.
