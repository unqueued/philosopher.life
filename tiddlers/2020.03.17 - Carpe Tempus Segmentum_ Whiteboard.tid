title: 2020.03.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Whiteboard

* Woke at 10:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
** Someone helped. =)
* Cleaning
* Dialecture
* Spoke with [[JRE]]
** Everyone's home. It's an interesting experience.
** Rebecca's second asshole coworker is leaving. Sweet.
** Talked about games.
** He's chillin with [[AIR]] today. 
*** I'm happy for them, and I wish I could be there.
* Chats
* Dialecture
** Trying to shape [[The Plan]] or give examples.
** Offspring and I talked about [[k0sh3k]]'s meetings quite a bit.
** Thinking about where to go.
* Whiteboard delivery
** Something was off today. Specialized. Maybe not enough delivery workers?
** I asked the bearded old man helping me if he would take anything to eat or drink, but he wouldn't (or couldn't). 
* We hung the whiteboard
** I fucked up, and one of the pieces was fucked up too. It works, but it's not even decently done (#$#@$).
** Son and I had fun though.
** We all like the whiteboard a lot.
*** My wife intends to keep part of it for meetings (since it's where she sits for them).
** Dad has a writing toolshop on top of the bookshelf. As long as my tools are put back, we are square.
* Helped daughter make dinner.
** We reasoned about priorities and timing.
** Lentils were not overcooked, yay. I think altitude is having an effect here.
* Dinner
** My wife's eyes are mildly bloodshot.
*** She has her mouse, but I think a docking station might be worthy. She likes curling up on the couch to work too much though.
**** She prefers her trackpad sometimes too. People change.
*** She's feeling better, but I think she's still stressed. Comotion in the world.
** STFU Card Used.
*** Graciously accepted; it is my honor.
* [[MTG]] with [[1uxb0x]]. His choices, my bids.
** His MWC vs Affinity, +1 turn his favor. Hilarious game for us. Puke 6 permanents into play T1. We could only laugh. T2 I had drawn 6 cards off of Skullclamps. Games ends with 4 DotVs with a sacout after showboating. Hao 2 C 30 cards and deal 100 damage by T4.
** His MUC vs Tittyburn, +2 turns his favor. We both mull, which favors him. Extremely close. Tiny, difficult to see errors allowed me to squeak through an artificial all-in window at the last second (right before stabilization) after sandbagging, bluffing, and peeling permission for many turns in quasi-topdeck mode.
*** His primary mistakes were valuing Capsize where he shouldn't have, and not 4xStrip-Mining me down to 3 land to choke me out. PoP hit him for too much. One or two differences would have cost me the game.
** I think he's going to be a control-player with practice. Excellent. It's the primary role to understand in magic, imho.
* Soup leftovers into the deep freeze. 
** So amazing to have extra space. 
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Read+Write
* Walked and talked with myself.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 3?
