title: 2019.05.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Ideology

!! Respond to the following gem:

There is a noticeable general difference between the sciences and mathematics on the one hand, and the humanities and social sciences on the other. It's a first approximation, but one that is real. In the former, the factors of integrity tend to dominate more over the factors of ideology. It's not that scientists are more honest people. It's just that nature is a harsh taskmaster. You can lie or distort the story of the French Revolution as long as you like, and nothing will happen. Propose a false theory in chemistry, and it'll be refuted tomorrow.

This is farcical. I agree there are significant differences between STEM and Humanities, but the claim science has integrity which dominates ideology is itself ideological. At the bottom of the sciences will always be philosophy. There is no escaping it. I will agree that externalist empirical modeling (mixed with a hilarious attempt at unbiased, valueless internalism) and deflationary assumptions in ontology have bought you a minimal base upon which to avoid many kinds of mistakes, but those assumptions are themselves often mistaken (even in science).

Note, of course, paradigms in science are ideologies. My dearest [[Saint Chomsky]], never forgetti, your scientific perspectives are still not fully refuted themselves either (even though you have clearly failed in many respects). It's not like it happens overnight, though perhaps one funeral at a time. Indeed, even mathematics faces this problem (see Shinichi Mochizuki).

Considering the replication crisis, massive failures in peer review, paywalling, p-hacking, and profound capitalist corruptions of scientific and academic endeavors, I think ideology is just as profound concern in science as in the humanities.
