"What is Philosophy?" is itself a strikingly philosophical question.

--A. W. Moore
<<<

Sometimes I feel like I need a can-opener to pry myself open. Writing prompts force me to say something about a topic. It can be recreational and useful at the same time. Admittedly, these questions tend to be philosophical. I sprawl all over the place, and I ask more questions than I answer. That's okay though. This is just part of the mind-mapping process.

It is my hypothesis that many of the prompts I've answered thus far remind me strongly of "Sunday School" questions. The teacher might gather us together and ask generic existential questions, and we'd have to formulate intelligent and socially acceptable responses. It was a form of conditioning. We were expected to think as they did. My questions and answers were often received poorly, dismissed, or misunderstood. Par for the course. Thankfully, here I get to say what I think since I'm answering them for myself. I won't always pretend I'm the one asking the questions though. A dialectic, like the Socratic method, tends to bring out the best in me.

I've decided that I will have a more adversarial approach to these prompts. I will respond to them as if that asshole Samwise Gamgee had asked me to answer these questions. I hate Samwise Gamgee; may he burn in hell.<<ref "1">> Hostility is a useful way for me force myself to answer carefully, to pick a part everything, to see the outlines. In many ways, I was good at academic philosophy because I was at mental war.<<ref "2">>

* If you were dictator of the world, country, state, county, city, neighborhood, family, and any other archetypal governmental contexts (feel free to use lateral thinking in naming these contexts), what would you do? How would you lead? 
* Why don't you follow philosophy like someone standardly interested in it? When you are obsessed with something, you usually enjoy reading every little thing about it. You don't do that with philosophy. Why not?
* Can you speak to the relationship between Moral Excellence, Excelllence of Personhood, Homo Sapien Excellence, etc.? For example, it seems completely possible that the pursuit of morality taken to maximum excellence will drive a person crazy. I legitimately think that people who are sane aren't trying hard enough to be moral.
