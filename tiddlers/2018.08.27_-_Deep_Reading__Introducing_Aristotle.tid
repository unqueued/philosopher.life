title: 2018.08.27 - Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

One thing that has changed for me over the years is my impression of the monism of the Eleatics. The issues of immutability and henosis have become more important to me with my partial openness to compatibilism and increasing appreciation for a number of problems in metaphysics. What I used to be able to dismiss as irrational (Aristotle being this foundation I relied upon), I now cannot. Parmenides deserves a closer look. I'm looking forward to walking through this with my children. 

I still haven't given an serious [[CATI]] answers to the problems of time/space and infinity that I'm even reasonably happy with (and probably never will). My sympathy for the Eleatics increases. 

I really wish they spent a lot more time comparing Plato and Aristotle, showing what they had in common especially. This jump was WAY too fucking fast.
