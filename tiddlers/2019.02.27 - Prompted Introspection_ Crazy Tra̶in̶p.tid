title: 2019.02.27 - Prompted Introspection: Crazy Tra̶in̶p

!! What is an exciting or crazy trip you have taken?

I have been wrong so many times about whether or not something merited excitement or the crazy label. I also don't know what counts as a trip. I've been trippin' though. =) There is nothing that compares to the dissociative near-death dystopic world-swallowing compression-into-a-single-pulsing-point phenomenology of the k-hole. I have searched for a famous painting I once saw of a liquid being shot through a tiny hole in a dam...I have been that liquid.

God damnit. I don't want to do it again. I should. I have had TWO [[Root Users]] ask me to think about it. They say, "you're the only one who can make that call." Yeah, yeah. I know what you mean. God damnit. Shall I burn a Sunday on it? DCK-Sabbath. I don't want to take notes on it anymore. I should be ready though. Fuck.
