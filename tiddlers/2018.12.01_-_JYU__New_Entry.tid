I made a new entry with this text, but not sure if it made it. Feel free to add it to your wiki if I didn't do it right:

I will try using this interface, please forgive any faux pas that I may make in your digital brain.

<<<
I hope those connections grow substantially. I don't have a lot of examples to look at to know how to do this well, so I'm winging-it and wandering the desert in the dark.
<<<

Imagine if everyone had a wiki like this and your proliferous nature. A similar notion is if everyone had the time and space to write a novel. The world would be a richer place, indeed. But perhaps it has already happened: a person’s Facebook page is an autobiographical book, one post at a time, although intermediated through a corporation.

<<<
I'm sorry if you might find my work inscrutable or lacking immediate gratification.

The comment about wiki’s wasn’t instigated by yours, but rather, SCP foundation http://www.scp-wiki.net/. It's is a very interesting narrative made through “found” artifacts, but I wasn’t going for this in particular for my list. More on this below.

In any case, ergodicity may include more than the concept of linearity.
<<<

This is an excellent point. Ergodicity and difficulty of reading do not necessarily correlate one-to-one. There are some novels which have topsy turvy timelines that are more difficult to parse than some non-ergodic texts. This is something I need to think more on.

I agree: some works like Asimov and Dune require intensive reading even in ergodic formats. I come from a world where I’ve created products and experience at scale (millions of people), so that is lens which I bring to hyperliterature. What is the next step after novels? I believe it will be something iterative that is easily ingestible, yet allows a new layer of richness. Accessibility is paramount to making any new medium a success. Some may think this “low brow” but new mediums needs the success of low brow content before it can take off.

I have been thinking about and trying to model you for myself. You appear to have a significant background in Music.b Why'd you move away from acoustics?
What did you think of working at FB, and why don't you work there anymore?
<<<

I am a peculiar human in that I reset myself every four years or so. I like to become a novice again, learning a whole different skill. I am multi-hyphenate. 

My journey thus far has been: signal processing and acoustics -> web developer -> designer -> startup founder -> product manager -> fiction writer. 

In this modern age of specialization I am somewhat of an anomaly. It’s not an easy road, but it is what I love to do. 

Why did I leave Facebook? Because I wasn’t learning new things anymore. Pretty simple. 

<<<
Do you think your interest in science fiction has caused you to be interested in philosophy?
<<<

Yes! In short, all authors who writing fiction end up asking the tough philosophical questions.

<<<
I adore your book choices. Do you have any other recommendations?
<<<

Not at the moment. I’m only putting books that are deeply impactful on that list. Of course, it’ll evolve as I read more.
