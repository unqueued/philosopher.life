title: 2020.03.11 - chameleon: Subversiveness

I'm still thinking about it. I'm not terribly hopeful, sadly. I assume we're in similar shoes here. I tend toward the MIT side because it aims to treat IP closer to how it should be considered (though, I treat most source as being something like MIT licensed, even when it legally isn't; I still intend copyleft), but I agree that many people who pursue that license don't do so for good reasons.

I adore the GPL hack too, but I also think evolutions of it (e.g. AGPL) are likely to fail. Going even further into copyleft territory so far that it includes more overt socialist requirements is likely a deadend (and I dearly hope I'm wrong). The GPL has broadly worked because some threshold of capitalists have accepted the trojan horse (or found a way to route around it). To my eyes, the GPL is a practical violation of the principle that no (standardly conceived) legal IP rights should obtain. It has appeared consequentially justified in virtue of the fact that it has delivered results which the more explicitly correct appearing MIT license hasn't in Western capitalist societies. I appreciate that pragmatism, but from a practical standpoint, I'm not convinced copyleft will have repeat performances in most cases (let alone more subversive improvements).

There will probably always be a place for GPL-style subversiveness (which is not to say it's always subversive: someone like Linus can abuse it). It might not be the most practical path or the most essential option though.

Currently, I think the most pragmatic (which is why I think GPL should be considered at all) subversive injections of decentralizing technology will need to be openly licensed like MIT to have a chance of infecting the corporate world effectively enough to prevent unjustified authorities from eliminating its use. China, for example, still can't effectively outlaw VPNs (not that enforcement given obfuscation is easy); it's too crucial to their own capitalist infrastructures. There are some technologies that we've got to embed that deeply. The groundwork for the workers owning the means of production may need to be cultivated inside of corporate environments which are willing to accept MIT in cases where they won't accept GPL (or more extreme). It's probably just a dream that we could use the capitalist's machinations to give birth to its own monkeywrench. However bleak it may appear, I think the MIT license is still a suitable living trojan horse in some crucial cases.
