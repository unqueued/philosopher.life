!! What would you do if you were Mick Jagger for 1 day?

Give my money to [[h0p3]] or charity. I'd probably do two chicks at one time (wait...`/google`, yes, The Stick is still alive for stickin'). I would voice my political opinions from a soapbox. I would probably write in my wiki about how fucking weird the experience was. Would I know it was only for a day? That would dictate so much.
