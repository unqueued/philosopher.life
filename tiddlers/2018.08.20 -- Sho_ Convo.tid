```
I'm on the hunt for music recently (it's one of the things I've been trying to start doing again for myself). If you are down for it, tell me a song or two (or however many; I'll go through any playlist) to listen to.
Sat 9:48 AM

2 hours ago
 sorry for delayed response
2 hours ago
 the answer is yes, i am the best person you could possibly ask
2 hours ago
 because i have both fantastic and eclectic taste in music ;)
2 hours ago
 lol
2 hours ago
 not a problem, I like messaging because it's asychronous
2 hours ago
 i've actually kept a 'music journal' each year since 2004
2 hours ago
 that's awesome
2 hours ago
 I'm super envious
2 hours ago
 :D
2 hours ago
 basically it's just a cd's worth of songs
2 hours ago
 i keep a list during the year
2 hours ago

2 hours ago

2 hours ago

1 hour ago
 aye
1 hour ago
 i'm waiting for ed to finish work for the day
1 hour ago
 it's nearly 8pm here but he's still at it
1 hour ago
 he stripped the crap OSB board off the front of the house todaoy and replaced it
1 hour ago
 and is currently putting up the wetproof membrane thing
1 hour ago
 cause it's meant to rain tomorrow
1 hour ago
 shocker lol
1 hour ago
 i cleaned the caravan this morning and then worked all afternoon and made tea (dinner) which is waiting for him
1 hour ago
 it's midgey as fuck out there too :( poor ed
1 hour ago
 =/
1 hour ago
 Does Ed like working with his hands?
1 hour ago
 aye, he's a silversmith to trade
1 hour ago
 hasn't been able to do it full-time in years because of his soulless cunt bitch whore fucking sister
1 hour ago
 but hopefully soon, maybe even later this year, he can get a shed up as a workshop
1 hour ago
 and work a bit while he works on the house
1 hour ago
 he's starting to yell
1 hour ago
 the midges will be getting to him then :(
1 hour ago
 Fuck, man. I think he's going to be at it at least another hour
1 hour ago
 he told me 'an hour' almost three hours ago lol
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 so i'm just drinking wine and looking for friends to annoy online
1 hour ago
 because i cannae be arsed organising/editing photos
1 hour ago
 That sounds pleasant
1 hour ago
 it's not bad
1 hour ago
 normally i'm fed and stoned by now, tho.
1 hour ago
 boo
1 hour ago
 Just a wee anecdote I've been meaning to share about Lewis... Ed's got a friend whose nickname is Smiler.
Someone sent post to Smiler, addressed literally only to 'Smiler, Isle of Lewis'. It got to him ;)
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 that's awesome
1 hour ago
 aye pretty cool
1 hour ago
 thank you for the list
1 hour ago
 can't open it in Excel 2016 in my Windows VM, but Google Docs to the rescue
1 hour ago
 ok, so hav eyou got it ok?
1 hour ago
 i can copy paste the text into an email or send you screen shots or something else if you like
1 hour ago
 I have it. Going through it now.
1 hour ago
 I like how you do it yearly. That is very cool. As I said, I wish I did the same.
1 hour ago
 started in Berea ;)
1 hour ago
 I suppose these transport you back in time and help you remember the stories of who you are.
1 hour ago
 they do a bit, aye
1 hour ago
 not that there's much i want to remember that i don't already haha
1 hour ago
 but it's cool
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 the songs are rarely new songs
1 hour ago
 well, new that year
1 hour ago
 almost never
1 hour ago
 I see that
1 hour ago
 some are new to me, but mostly it's just things that for whatever reason were prominent in my life that year
1 hour ago
 yes
1 hour ago
 that is what I'm gathering
1 hour ago
 :)
1 hour ago
 My music collection was destroyed even through RAID5 redundancy and another backup. I've only just this year started trying to build my collection again.
1 hour ago
 I wish I had just kept a list like you did.
1 hour ago
 It makes a lot of sense.
1 hour ago
 The catalog is the hard part; acquisition not so much.
1 hour ago
 well i do have a lot of playlists i've made that aren't in that list
1 hour ago
 https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library:%5B%5BMusic%3A%20Library%5D%5D
1 hour ago
 i should fix that
1 hour ago
 We have some similar tastes too.
1 hour ago
 cool
1 hour ago
 you have some interestingly titled lists lol
1 hour ago
 aye, not a timeline like you have, so it doesn't tell me a story. I'm trying to organize a list which I can use machine learning to help me curate new music. Finding new music is somehow hard work. I didn't used to think so when I was younger.
1 hour ago
 sometimes i'm surprised how often new music turns up in my life
1 hour ago
 esp when it's old stuff and you're like, how did I miss this?
1 hour ago
 I mean, did you know the red hot chili peppers used to be pretty fucking cool? lol
1 hour ago
 Ed's a big fan of most of their eralier stuff
1 hour ago
 you'd never ken it by the pish they churn out today
1 hour ago
 I love how music is a drug that is socially acceptable to use.
1 hour ago
 haha
1 hour ago
 I have few of those outlets that I can share with the average person, imho.
1 hour ago
 is it really, though? i mean, most of today's population probably don't nkow what music is, certainly not most of the younger generation
1 hour ago
 i think 'the man' has commandeered the music industry as part of their larger mvoe to prevent as much  human consciousness/decency/joy as possible
1 hour ago
 that happened before you were born though
1 hour ago
 i know
1 hour ago
 i hardly listen to music tha twas made since I was born ;) lol
1 hour ago
 i suppose that's a bit of an exaggeration
1 hour ago
 but you know what I mean
1 hour ago
 the 90s and even the 80s had a few redeeming, original qualities
1 hour ago
 but i don't think there's been much made this century worth a damn
1 hour ago
 that said, the way technology has made it so easy/cheap to record/share music, stuff that is more obscure can stil get out there, so that's good
1 hour ago
 there are people with talent
1 hour ago
 they just aren't on the radio :P
1 hour ago
 those are all whores, regardless of gender :P
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 I love whores though
1 hour ago
 haha
1 hour ago
 except your sister-in-law, [[k0sh3k]] was telling me a bit about her...
1 hour ago
 oh, Jean
1 hour ago
 aye i have nothing nice to say about her
1 hour ago
 quite th eopposite
1 hour ago
 she proves how little of 'hippie Sho' is left in here
1 hour ago
 honestly, it's shocking what she did to ed, how she treated him
1 hour ago
 i hate rich cunts
1 hour ago
 GRRRRRRRRRRRR
1 hour ago
 GET THE GUILLOTINES!!!
1 hour ago
 I realise the French fucked it up, but I dinnae see why we shouldnae try again :P
1 hour ago
 the wealthy are now doing their best to hide it, insulating themselves from the consequences of their own actions
1 hour ago
 Wine does sound good!
1 hour ago
 wine always sounds good
1 hour ago
 unfortunately it's not free and apparently isn't good for me, so :P
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 i had gotten into the habit for years of drinking just about every day
1 hour ago
 but i've cut back a lot these past few months
1 hour ago
 cause ed's been on about it for ages
1 hour ago
 well, not on about it
1 hour ago
 he's quite great about wanting to let me do what i want to do
1 hour ago
 but i know he's been worried
1 hour ago
 it's one of those things where I really didnae care if I were drinking myself to death slowly
1 hour ago
 in fact, was qutie fine iwth it
1 hour ago
 but now I've got Ed, I have to think too about longevity and being here for him and stuff
1 hour ago
 i'm relatively certain that, gods forbid anytinng happens to him, i'll revert to drinking myself to death
1 hour ago
 maybe less slowly, tho
1 hour ago
 :P
1 hour ago
 I'm there with you. I can't get through plenty of days without a substance. I like having a drink every night myself, but it messes with my stomach and sleep. I save getting drunk off my ass for the darkest hours to give me a way to blind and numb myself.
1 hour ago
 I have absolutely no idea how people use ketamine as a party drug.
1 hour ago
 well, it's both a shame and a blessing to have that back up plan
1 hour ago
 fucking a
1 hour ago
 cannae say i've ever heard anything about it that made me even curious about doing it myself
1 hour ago
 nae interest
1 hour ago
 i mean, i'ts the one that is a horse tranquilizer, isn't it?
1 hour ago
 it's a dissociative
1 hour ago
 I've never heard of it being used on horses
1 hour ago
 oh okay
1 hour ago
 Super effective against treatment resistant depression.
1 hour ago
 aha
1 hour ago
 Because it's an old substance, it cannot be patented. Since nobody can make money off it, it is not prescribed, advocated for, advertised, etc.
1 hour ago
 well, i'm glad the 'prozac' helps me
1 hour ago
 yes
1 hour ago
 aye
1 hour ago
 I'm glad something works for you
1 hour ago
 for realz
1 hour ago
 getting the wolf off your back is incredibly hard
1 hour ago
 i tell you what else has helped me immensely these past few years...
1 hour ago
 I keep mine staring at me from the woods
1 hour ago
 not giving a fuck about things so much
1 hour ago
 apathy is AMAZING
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 seriously
1 hour ago
 apathy is really underrated
1 hour ago
 but again, capitalist society. makes sense :P
1 hour ago
 I draw lines that enable me to experience apathy towards specific individuals, tribes, or contexts. I hope to do so morally.
1 hour ago
 i guess I do, too
1 hour ago
 Aye. I can see you legit care about human beings, even if you can't stand many of them.
1 hour ago
 It's the weird part about being a Golde Rule practicing misanthrope, I think.
1 hour ago
 aye, it's a terrible paradox
1 hour ago
 i'd really hate them less if i dindae care so much
1 hour ago
 haha
1 hour ago
 haha
1 hour ago
 for the brief time I was on Twitter I was MisanthropeMit
1 hour ago
 as in, Mit-randir ;)
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 MitHrandir, sorry
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 nah, i'm just disgusted
1 hour ago
 muh Gandalfs
1 hour ago
 and broken-hearted
1 hour ago
 it's terrible, because humans could have been amazing
1 hour ago
 we could have built ourselves an amazing world to be in
1 hour ago
 but no
1 hour ago
 patriarchy and profit and ego
1 hour ago
 thats all there is
1 hour ago
 well, that has any influence on a large scale, anyway
1 hour ago
 when i was young i wanted to save teh world
1 hour ago
 i used to fret because it seemed like a thing that could and should happen
1 hour ago
 with time you learn that the world wil never be ok
1 hour ago
 even as things improve, other things fall to bits
1 hour ago
 this is the nature of life
1 hour ago
 ebb and flow, tides, blah blah blah
1 hour ago
 homo sapiens are doomed
1 hour ago
 and i don't really care, anymore. i just want left the fuck alone
1 hour ago
 but it gets harder all the time
1 hour ago
 as you say, the rich are trying to cover their arses
1 hour ago
 i take consolation in knowing that if things get REALLY really really bad, like wartime bad, it will affect us less than them
1 hour ago
 we already know how mjch we DON'T need to live
1 hour ago
 I cannot give up hope on this front. I do not predict good outcomes, but I still think they are possible. I'm quite serious in how I engage in: https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others:%5B%5BFind%20The%20Others%5D%5D -- It's clear to me that ~3% of the population are legit altruists, and it is to them I owe everything.
1 hour ago
 I am not so hopeful about that, but I have read and pondered that argument before.
1 hour ago
 Parts of it are right.
1 hour ago
 word, i love the good folk :)
1 hour ago
 I think they will continue to more successfully enslave the rest of humanity as power centralizes further and further.
1 hour ago
 which?
1 hour ago
 oh, aye
1 hour ago
 it's one reason i get so pissed off
1 hour ago
 revolution is impossible
1 hour ago
 it honestly is
1 hour ago
 it's not
1 hour ago
 it's just highly, highly improbable
1 hour ago
 they have too much control and censhorship and eyes everywhere
1 hour ago
 ok
1 hour ago
 let's split hairs, here ;)
1 hour ago
 i stand corrected lol
1 hour ago
 It's a crucial distinction to me
1 hour ago
 it defines whether or not I actually try to do anything about it
1 hour ago
 i suppose you're right
1 hour ago
 aha
1 hour ago
 nah, i'm out
1 hour ago
 the only revolution i coul imagine being involved in would be a fight for scotland's freedom
1 hour ago
 but we'll not get that anyway as most of scots are fucking sheep
1 hour ago
 I could totally see  you doing that, btw.
1 hour ago
 see, it isn't only the technology aspects that make revolution ALMOST impossible ;)
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 it's also this... the idea of 'violence', even just calling someone a mean name, has been made SO distasteful
1 hour ago
 to the populace
1 hour ago
 people care more about being inclusive to their enemies
1 hour ago
 than naming and defeating their enemies
1 hour ago
 and i'd love to say we don't have enemies
1 hour ago
 tech is a two-edged sword, it is as much the thing used to oppress as the tool that makes it possible to equalize3
1 hour ago
 i used to see the world that way
1 hour ago
 but i was kdiding myself
1 hour ago
 I feel similarly
1 hour ago
 I was a hardcore pacifist
1 hour ago
 aye, but only if the masses see the need and grow the desire to do so
1 hour ago
 I own a gun now.
1 hour ago
 but most are so HAPPILY distracted by bullshit...
1 hour ago
 haha
1 hour ago
 Ed says if we lived in the states, he'd hav ea gun/guns, too
1 hour ago
 thing is, nothing wrong with a gun
1 hour ago
 IN THE RIGHT FUCKING CONTEXT sigh
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 I think it is necessary for the Left to arm themselves.
1 hour ago
 Marx called this one a long time ago.
1 hour ago
 ed's been a bit of an influence on me, i guess, in terms of militancy
1 hour ago
 and life
1 hour ago
 for realz
1 hour ago
 Ed is a Marxist ;)
1 hour ago
 He's not responded to me either.
1 hour ago
 Did I weird him out?
1 hour ago
 We had whisky by the fire to mourn Fidel when he went
1 hour ago
 oh
1 hour ago
 dude he's busy
1 hour ago
 ah
1 hour ago
 he does plan to respond :)
1 hour ago
 i think he's just not sure what to say
1 hour ago
 np, and I mean to apply zero pressure
1 hour ago
 'cause he said he's never had an email like that before
1 hour ago
 no i ken that :)
1 hour ago
 i told him you're cool and it's all more normal than he  might think, as a Scot
1 hour ago
 communication is not the strong point of this culture lol
1 hour ago
 or mine* to be clear
1 hour ago
 We didn't have whisky for Fidel, but when Scalia died, we threw a party
1 hour ago
 haha, rock on
1 hour ago
 There were parties here when Thatcher died
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 i'd say 'god curse her soul', if i belived in that kind of god :P
1 hour ago
 no doubt
1 hour ago
 i'm not a very nice person nowadays
1 hour ago
 tho that's also not true. i'm really really nice to people genreally
1 hour ago
 really good to those i love
1 hour ago
 i used to want to love and forgive and understand everyone
1 hour ago
 but i gave up
1 hour ago
 like Dylan said, I used to care but things have changed lol
1 hour ago
 Your frontal lobes finished developing at 25. It takes several years for your computer of a brain to transition into the conservatism that it lends to all homo sapiens. (I hope you are not offended by that word)
1 hour ago
 what, conservatism? ;)
1 hour ago
 I think the disillusionment makes sense from a biological and world-politik context
1 hour ago
 it's okay, tainted as it is I know there is a wider application lol
1 hour ago
 thanks
1 hour ago
 i do, too lol
1 hour ago
 taht said, i'll ensure i'm never 'conservative' like most old cunts
1 hour ago
 like, I'm never going to vote Tory
1 hour ago
 that would be the day
1 hour ago
 if I do, may god/goddess/lightning/rain/ANTYHING strike me down, please
1 hour ago
 lol
1 hour ago
 well i think ed is actually almost done with the thing he's doing so i'm gonnae heat up that pasta i made earlier :)
1 hour ago
 speak soon! x
1 hour ago
 =) have a good evening
1 hour ago
 You too
