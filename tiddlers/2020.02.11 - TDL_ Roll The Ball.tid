* Find yo'self a mechanic
* RSS, Arch, Windows VM with Bob for daughter
* Son has physical construction to do, but he's pretty much given up on giving a shit about working on something digital. 
** Ride him. There's no other way. He'll just be miserable with you until he gives in and does it. For the umpteenth time, he will discover it was in his reach the entire time.
* I'd like to see [[X-Section]] examinations.
* Proof of audiobooks. Make them play them for you.
* Fish Stir Fry
* Put the penis in the vagina.
* Couch wiring and mount that tiny lamp for your wife. 
** May she see the light and you not.
