title: McManus: Carl Schmitt, Liberalism, and Post-Modern Conservatism

<<<
Firstly, Schmitt thought that liberalism’s claim to truly respect difference was a sham. 
<<<

A reasonable worry. It depends on what you mean by the concept of Respect. I do not respect psychopathy or psychopaths. Why ought I? Why should they have any say in [[The Original Position]] since is definitionally antithetical to the project itself.

<<<
The practice of politics is always a form of violence, whether literal or figurative, as different groups of friends and enemies attempt to overcome one another and seize control of the state.
<<<

I think that is the line where politics becomes difficult. When do we choose to defect rather than cooperate, to what [[dok]], etc?

<<<
This sovereign is the person or body which “decides the exception.” 
<<<

I suggest the possibility that we are pointing to a very serious mathematics/computer science problem here. There is a change that ultimately there's something to this even if we attempt to radically create [[The Original Position]]. I am quite worried about it!

I think Gödel is worried about it too.

This may be a dialectical matter at the very tip.

Of course, I'm not claiming Schmitt is going the same direction I am.

<<<
To invoke Rawls as a foil, Schmitt would claim that liberals reveal their true respect for difference and the Other when they say that differences in opinion and political theology can be tolerated where they are “reasonable.”
<<<

Of course, defining "Reason" always ends up being the fundamental problem in philosophy. Coherentists are always going to have this problem. Korsgaard has this problem too. What is evil agency? 

I take up a position knowing it is necessarily incomplete. 

<<<
The emergence of post-modern conservatism indicates that the desire to use the state and its power to create a total identity has not gone away.
<<<

You really might not like my opinion at all. You have to take a position on what counts as reason. When you start looking at it hard enough, it appears [[The Golden Rule]] is our only option. That is the total identity I seek, even if we can only heuristically work our way towards it.
