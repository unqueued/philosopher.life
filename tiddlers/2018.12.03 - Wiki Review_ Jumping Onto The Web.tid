title: 2018.12.03 - Wiki Review: Jumping Onto The Web

* [[2018.12.02 - MTG Log: Daughter]]
** Was fun, but my daughter seems far less interested in playing and more interested in just constructing. That's cool. That game is mostly about construction in the end.
*** Games are mostly thing you think about outside of playing them (at least in my experience).
* [[Magic: The Gathering]]
** I think it's interesting that I don't [[Autogen]] here. Some of the subprojects are autogened. 
* [[MTG Deck]]
** Cleaned this up. This is a fine house. Naming conventions in the list will do all the work.
* [[MTG Log]]
** Starting it up. I'm hoping my children are interested enough to dive into the world with me.
* [[2018.12.02 - Wiki Audit: Push]]
** I am slowly pushing through the logs. I think [[The Remodeling]] is working. =)
*** At the very least, my awful grammar is getting cleaned up a good deal, and I have the chance to relive it. =)
** You know, this is not the first time that writing the [[review]] of my previous day's [[audit]] inspired me to stop what I was doing to begin a new entry into [[Wiki Audit]] for the day.
*** I am pleasantly surprised when the [[review]] serves as a jumping off point onto my web.
* [[2018.12.02 - Family Log: Magic]]
** My daughter doesn't write like I do. I am very grateful that she writes it though. =)
* [[2018.12.02 - Prompted Introspection: Finding Treasure]]
** I do live in my own head. I'm trying to help my son bridge the gap into thinking about the real world in more practical ways. This is not the skill of autists.
* [[2018.12.02 - Wiki Review: Oh My...]]
** That is the longest list of [[New]] tiddlers I've seen in quite a while.
* [[2018.12.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Famtime]]
** Completed.
* [[2018.12.03 - TDL: Keep Applying]]
** Edited.
* [[2018.12.02 - JRE: Tooling Around]]
** I should tell him about the upgrade to FireOS.
* [[2018.12.02 - Computer Musings: Jail]]
** Yay. And, now, I can read something more productive than [[Saga]].
* [[2018.12.02 - Link Log: Bit Of Cleanup]]
** I can't help but sometimes surf around on the browser window even when it's not on the window's topic (and essentially not in my curation/hyperreading work).
* [[2018.12.01 - Jop: Painting]]
** That was odd. I'd like to note that people very rarely ask me how I'm doing, but I also think people very rarely care enough to look.
