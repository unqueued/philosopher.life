In the final stage of egolessness there is an 'obscure knowledge' that All is in allâ€”that All is actually each...

As Huxley points out, within sameness there is difference, although that difference is not different from sameness.

Speculative Realism (SR) aims to de-anthropocentrize Kant's Copernican Revolution which reduced philosophical enquiry to a correlation between thought and being, such that one cannot hold justified beliefs about the reality of anything outside of this correlation. Post-Kantianism idealistically dissolves metaphysics by claiming phenomenal objects conform to the mind of the subject and, in turn, become products of human cognition. In short, SR claims to be justified in making claims about the noumena denied to us by the Kantian tradition.


SR rejects both overmining and undermining explanations of objects. 

SR maintains the reality of objects independent of human perception.

Object-oriented ontology maintains that objects exist independently (as Kantian noumena) of human perception and are not ontologically exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects.[3] Thus, for object-oriented ontologists, all relations, including those between nonhumans, distort their related objects in the same basic manner as human consciousness and exist on an equal footing with one another.[4]

We cannot know that. We can only speculate. 

Perhaps it is to inconsistently speak of the totality of possible worlds and the totality of correlates.
