title: 2019.12.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Brotherhood

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I believe in the brotherhood of all men, but I don't believe in wasting brotherhood on anyone who doesn't want to practice it with me. Brotherhood is a two-way street.

I agree that it can be a two-way street, but determining whether or not someone aims to practice it with you is not a simple task. Defection and cooperation can be obvious, but perhaps it must sometimes be understood through a fuzzier or graded logic. Certainty cannot be achieved in the vast, vast majority of cases; confidence can still lead to incoherence, sadly. Part of the problem is that you have to waste brotherhood on people who don't want to practice it with you in order to find those who do.

Brotherhood can also be unidirectional in a way. You seem like my brother [[Saint MX]], and I'd argue you've been a brother to me, but I don't have a street to you.
