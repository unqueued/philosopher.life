How did your week go?

Now that I’m not driving anymore: My week was alright. I had a bit of a rough week emotionally, but I’m gradually getting better. Sometimes it takes a bit for the reality to set in. Also, I have contemplated what movies we could bring to the cabin, and I humbly request “Elf”. And maybe “A Christmas Story” for my dad cause he LOVES that movie.

It’s been hardest to watch mom and how she’s taking it. I am gonna need you to help us love on her a bunch, cause she really could use it.

That is not my forte, but I will, of course, do my best. I am surprised she is able to even make this trip with us.

It must be very costly to her.

I think it would be harder for her if she didn’t come on this trip

She may be an introvert, but spending time doing things and being with people can help distract.
