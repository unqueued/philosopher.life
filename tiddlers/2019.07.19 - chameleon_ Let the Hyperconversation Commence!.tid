(wow it's been a while since I made ascii text)

Thanks again for your letter. It isn't often that I get long-form correspondence outside of my professional life.

Over the last few days (the workweek) I've been taking a deep dive into your wiki, learning a lot and making plans of my own to learn more. I realise now how difficult an undertaking your wiki must've been; mine is just barely taking shape as I write this. I still have to create a [[Philosophy]] page and outline my <<tag Ideology>> in more detail; it's nothing but broad strokes and strongly held positions for now. So I can hardly blame you for being a bit disorganized :)

I'm unsure if I'm autistic myself - a childhood test came up negative, but the pediatrician said I showed the signs - but I am definitely not neurotypical, and have always found autistic people easier to befriend.

>I wish we all had more trusted friends to share the stories of our lives with.

Much agreed!

>One of my goals is to show people what it's like to be themselves online, to be transparent, and to build ourselves in the sunlight. I'm doing a terrible job. Lol.

On a deeper reading, your wiki makes more sense. Perhaps it can be put down to my previous delves being of the "bored-at-work" variety, when my mind is normally in a bit of a haze, so I'm not really in the right headspace to read philosophy. So, on the contrary and after a much deeper delve and WikiWalk, I'd like to say your work is more transparent than I had earlier realised... At least, I feel like your "position" is starting to crystallise in my mind's eye.

The [[Stories]] I was referring to are very private at the moment. If you'll forgive the hardware analogy, my real name, address, etc. are ring0, whereas my stories are ring1... For now, they'll stay private, though I might go into the metadata.

Perhaps if we pursue the penpal route further, I can show them to you, though I will have to get the assurance that you're not going to mirror them or methods to access them on the wiki, due to their private nature.

>It's painful and funny that you call it a Darger-esque doomed project. Yeah, that's probably right. I'm a madman. Sometimes I feel like Noah. I'm pretty sure most people, except my wife and few others, believe I'm throwing my life away by writing it into this wiki.

As much as anything, the Darger reference was for myself :D I really need to make a [[Henry Darger]] <<tag Senpai>> page. Even if I'll likely never read Realms of the Unreal, that sort of dedication to art, art for its own sake, is a distant dream of mine, and a literal, direct inspiration for much of my own art.

Still, I don't think the wiki is a waste. I share your views on art, for the most part, especially the maximization of art, if you'll forgive the oversimplification. So, I propose that your wiki in-itself is art, certainly art to [[me.|chameleon]]

>I owe you an apology for not responding a year ago. I hope to be the kind of person who responds, and I didn't. I'm sorry. IA2DYJ, I'd like to make it up to you!

Have no fear! Apology accepted, and you've already done more than enough to make it up to me, I dare say, with your response! But a response-response-response (a response to this letter) would also be appreciated, of course :)

>I read your wiki when I saw you posting on sneer club like two weeks ago. Gotta admit I haven't the foggiest what your actual position is. I ended up thinking you were nrx or something because of all the Kant. 

I'd like to ask the past me to stop being such a [[Twitter]] addict and not to assume based on a cursory glance, especially not as soon as I see a certain popular philosopher!

//facepalm @ myself// 

I've come to have a greater respect for Kant in the year or so since I made that comment, even if I can't really agree with (what I interpret as) his philosophy (quite yet).

Don't worry about "nrx", it was an ill-conceived comment. And if you do, just read [[El Sandifier's book instead.|https://www.amazon.com/Neoreaction-Basilisk-Essays-Around-Alt-Right-ebook/dp/B0782JDGVQ]] Having read it myself, it seems like the sort of thing you might enjoy - a bizarre, Eldritch-philosophy deep-dive into some of the internet's strangest thinkers.

>You are correct, I'm especially indebted to Saint Kant. He is a difficult man to wrestle with.

Hence my embarrassment at my snap judgement!

I feel like I need to read the man first-hand. At the moment my knowledge is drip-fed, second hand explanations, moral arguments, and Philosophy Tube memes.

>I appreciate your listening so closely enough to my pile of words to know that. It is rare that I meet people who empathize with weird, manic strangers online. Thank you.

You're very welcome. I personally see myself as a weird internet stranger, if I'm honest, so hopefully this can be a peer-to-peer conversation, and hopefully as a team we attract more of [[The Weird]] to our sphere of internetworkery. If you want to know just how "out-there" I get, keep an eye on <<tag Waifuism>>.

>`[tech conversation snip]`

Thank you very much for the "single-file firefox" pointer, and for keeping the browser addon information on your wiki. It's through that that I finally bit the bullet and got this bad boy set up. It's a single page served by my web server - [[How to make a wiki]] roughly describes my wiki-workflow as of the time of writing.

Bob sounds interesting though. Can I convert my singlefile wiki to one others can edit? I'd be interested in doing so, that way [[my husband|The Abyssal]] can add to the wiki too! The other thing I'd like to ask is - how do you add a little bit of space to the left of the pages in your wiki? On mine, when fullscreen on a 1080p monitor, the lines are too long. I'd also love to know how you make those creative footnotes, which seem to work with arbitrary text.

Anyways, that's all I have to say for now. Looking forward to an engaging penpallery :)
