!! Audit:

* I didn't do a facelift or any major changes to the log directories themselves this time. Should I have?
* Tagging, Filters, and Shygmus' Plugin have been the most important mechanical questions and contributions by far. 
* I'm slowly honing what I'm trying to accomplish a complete wiki audit. 
* I'm not created a lot of new things on the wiki. I'm probably pushing a lot of cognitive limits here. 
* I'm not seeing myself depressed in this. Fascinating. What the hell does that even mean?
* I've started moving away from [[Root]] and onto [[Wiki Audit]] to think about the wiki, particularly on cannabliss. Good.
