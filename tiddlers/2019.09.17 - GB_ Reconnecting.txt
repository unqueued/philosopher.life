It's been a month! I wanted to check in with you and see how you are doing. How's it going?
January 10 2019 1:49 PM
I hope you are doing well, sir.
May 27 2019 11:13 PM
I found something very moving, and I thought you might find it at least interesting (even if it were wrong): https://ianwrightsite.wordpress.com/2019/02/09/hegelian-contradiction-and-the-prime-numbers-part-2/

Hey man how are you doing these days?
September 17 2019 5:04 PM
Hey [[GB]]!
September 17 2019 5:04 PM
Sorry I've been AWOL. I've had a really crazy year
September 17 2019 5:05 PM
I'm doing well. It has been a good year so far. Busy, but fruitful.
September 17 2019 5:06 PM
I have no doubt it had been a crazy year for you. Are you doing okay?
September 17 2019 5:07 PM
What are you up to these days? Busy how?
September 17 2019 5:07 PM
Not great lol. I'm hanging in there 
September 17 2019 5:07 PM
I'm sorry to hear it's not great. Depression is a bitch, and considering how well you see the world, it's gotta be hard to hang in there.
September 17 2019 5:08 PM
I've been reading and writing my butt off. Homeschooling, and I've been teaching in an afterschool program. Trying to make myself useful.
September 17 2019 5:09 PM
How about you? What have you been up to? How's school going? What are you doing with your freetime (what little you likely have)?
September 17 2019 5:11 PM
I was worried that the last time I talked I may have upset you and/or you may have been feeling pretty awful (wasn't sure if I should keep knocking on your door). It's great to hear from you.
September 17 2019 5:13 PM
No you didn't upset me at all. Like I said it's just been an insane year. I don't remember when we talked last but Eden and I got back together and got engaged in January. Then we broke up again in March. Then we almost got back together again in June. At her instigation. Then she basically treated me like garbage and discarded me. We don't speak anymore
September 17 2019 5:38 PM
Basically since March I've been in a daze
September 17 2019 5:39 PM
Jesus. That is insane. I have no idea how you are standing.
September 17 2019 5:39 PM
Barely
September 17 2019 5:40 PM
We don't speak anymore because that's what she wants. I still love her and would forgive everything. But she has a new boyfriend and basically retconned the past year to me
September 17 2019 5:41 PM
"New". She knew him in high school and reconnected last December
September 17 2019 5:42 PM
That is gutwrenching. I am so sorry. 
September 17 2019 5:46 PM
Thanks man. I think you're only the second person I've talked about it to who isn't just like "she sucks, your better off without her. Oh well, move on"
September 17 2019 5:47 PM
Like it's easy 
September 17 2019 5:47 PM
You obviously love her all the way down.
September 17 2019 5:47 PM
Yep. All the way down
September 17 2019 5:47 PM
(which might be the only kind of love there is)
September 17 2019 5:47 PM
I would literally give my arm for a time machine to just over a year ago when I broke up with her
September 17 2019 5:48 PM
You got me in tears over here. My students are looking at me funny. Grown men aren't supposed to do that around here.
September 17 2019 5:49 PM
I'm sorry
September 17 2019 5:50 PM
I won't mention the worst part then lol
September 17 2019 5:50 PM
What are you teaching?
September 17 2019 5:50 PM
Whatever is relevant about the truth particularized to their context as best as I can understand it.
September 17 2019 5:51 PM
Whatever I can do to help them think about their lives.
September 17 2019 5:52 PM
Lol is it philosophy?
September 17 2019 5:52 PM
I hope so. Lol.
September 17 2019 5:52 PM
You should tell me the worst part too. It is important not to suffer alone.
September 17 2019 5:53 PM
I try to think about what I'd want someone to teach my children were they here.
September 17 2019 5:55 PM
I keep extensive notes on the wiki. Lookup Afterschool Program.
September 17 2019 5:55 PM
That's a great way to think about reaching I think
September 17 2019 5:56 PM
Oh...the worst part is that she has a child who I've known since before he was 1 (he's almost 6 now) and basically who I was a second dad to. And I was very close to him. So you see why I was stupid and immature and naive to break up with her
September 17 2019 5:57 PM
Fuck, dude. That is crushing. 
September 17 2019 5:59 PM
Yeah. All this has been really great for my depression
September 17 2019 6:00 PM
I can't imagine. Barely standing. 
September 17 2019 6:00 PM
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't considered whether life is worth living anymore. I haven't really told anyone that, except one other person, but I know you'd understand, unlike most
September 17 2019 6:01 PM
No, I get it. You will be the first I have directly said this to. I had a gun to my head last year. 
September 17 2019 6:04 PM
It was only a phone call that stopped me.
September 17 2019 6:04 PM
Jesus really? Please tell me you're doing better
September 17 2019 6:04 PM
Look man. Take it from someone like me who ruined his entire life. You have a wife and kids who love you. I understand what that means now
September 17 2019 6:05 PM
You've got it all. Yes, life is shit but you have the only antidote that exists for it right in front of you
September 17 2019 6:05 PM
You are right.
September 17 2019 6:06 PM
I have been doing better. Ideation has subsided.
September 17 2019 6:07 PM
I had it all. A year ago I had Eden and Sam and I had just finished my first chapter. I still loved philosophy. Now I have none of that. I don't even find joy in philosophy anymore, really. It's better than it has bee this past year but it's not the way it was
September 17 2019 6:07 PM
I'm really glad to hear that. Must have been some phone call
September 17 2019 6:08 PM
It's been an intense year piecing more of my life together.
September 17 2019 6:10 PM
It has sometimes been mighty lonely even with people listening.
September 17 2019 6:11 PM
It may not be useful to you, but you should call me at any hour for any reason. 
September 17 2019 6:12 PM
I know what you mean. But please take it from me, everything you need to figure it out and best it is right there for you
September 17 2019 6:12 PM
https://youtu.be/0dxB-VKAO-I
September 17 2019 6:12 PM
Oh, yes, I have my sense of purpose again. I know I'm going to fail, but I am honored to try.
September 17 2019 6:12 PM
I don't know if you've seen true detective, but that scene kind of captures it all. I wish I had known that a year ago
September 17 2019 6:13 PM
You're not going to fail. You're one of the most capable people I've ever met
September 17 2019 6:13 PM
Oh, this scene is haunting. True Detective is a powerful show.
September 17 2019 6:15 PM
Yeah. So please keep in mind that the solution to your whole life is right there already. It's the same thing everyone told you all along. I think us philosophers think we're too clever to fall for that or something
September 17 2019 6:18 PM
So if you ever get to the point where you were before, remember that and think about how I told you that. And you better believe I know, living on the other side of it
September 17 2019 6:19 PM
That is high praise coming from you. Thank you. I still look up to up you when I'm thinking what it means to do philosophy. You once told me before you entered your PhD program that your strategy was to go all out, no holds barred, something which would either be loved or hated. I've decided there is something very right about that in my purpose now. 
September 17 2019 6:20 PM
Yes, and I will think about your words more than you know.
September 17 2019 6:21 PM
Unfortunately I think it's that exact attitude that blinded me from the rest of life and made me take for granted the other things I had
September 17 2019 6:21 PM
Then I must back up and rethink my strategy too.
September 17 2019 6:22 PM
Part of why I originally broke up with Eden is she didn't want to move because she'd have to share Sam with his dad and she didn't want to do that. So I knew it was her or my career. I chose wrong
September 17 2019 6:22 PM
But, I am convinced I am in the fight of my life for my children's futures.
September 17 2019 6:22 PM
I mean it was a Sophie's choice from the beginning. I thought they were equal parts of me. I didn't realize until after they weren't at all. Self deception is a bitch
September 17 2019 6:23 PM
Preach, yo. I feel like you are reaching over the the wire to shake me awake. Don't go that way!
September 17 2019 6:28 PM
Well if anyone can learn from my mistakes at least some good came from it
September 17 2019 6:31 PM
Sounds like philosophy to me. I think I'm often a madman lost in desert happening upon strange nomads. 
September 17 2019 6:39 PM
You still teaching classes?
September 17 2019 6:39 PM
No I have a fellowship that covers me for the next year
September 17 2019 6:39 PM
I should be writing lol
September 17 2019 6:39 PM
Lol. I know that feeling. 
September 17 2019 6:40 PM
How is the dissertation going? I'd like the chance, if you ever feel up to it, to read your first chapter. 
September 17 2019 6:41 PM
My first chapter is rough and needs to be retooled
September 17 2019 7:23 PM
I'm finishing second now. Third will be quick 
September 17 2019 7:23 PM
 Good. I am glad it's coming along. Perhaps when you are done I will have the chance. I would like to become fluent in your point of view.
September 17 2019 7:40 PM
Of course man. And I'd love to read your latest stuff too
September 17 2019 7:51 PM


Hey [[h0p3]]. I got Signal
SEP 17 9:55 PM
Noice! =)
SEP 17 9:58 PM
Makes it easy for me to use my computer too.
SEP 17 9:58 PM
I'm trying to become a little more security conscious
SEP 17 10:01 PM
Probably going to get a VPN soon
SEP 17 10:02 PM
I'm gonna need to setup a VPN to get around our ISP. They aren't allowing us to portforward, so there's no way to reach the house from the outside. =/
SEP 17 10:19 PM
Also, in case you wanted to play with my brother and me: https://project-ascension.com/
SEP 17 10:22 PM
Fascinating private server
SEP 17 10:22 PM
Like crack though. =)
SEP 17 10:22 PM
Damn dude I would but I know of I start playing I'll get sucked down a rabbit hole and my diss will never get finished rofl
SEP 17 10:23 PM
Aye, lol.
SEP 17 10:24 PM
Seriously. I realize that about myself. I get addicted to games so damn easily
SEP 17 10:27 PM
/wipes-powder-off-nose, yeah, I hear that.
SEP 17 10:29 PM
I think Everquest turned it up to 11 for us.
SEP 17 10:29 PM
I played eqemu for a few years but it really ran its course with me
SEP 17 10:34 PM
Aye. It was the server designed for MQ2 botting that brought me back. Otherwise, I can do without. I think Everquest normalized dropping 12 straight hours into a game for me like nothing else could in my youth. Those neural pathways are well-built.
SEP 17 10:36 PM
Which server? I played on one that you could 6-bot on. I had a great little group
SEP 17 10:37 PM
Lemme see if I can find it.
SEP 17 10:37 PM
http://leetsauceforums.proboards.com
SEP 17 10:52 PM
Custom currency, the only correct way to play the game was to script everything, you'd hop around the map blowing shit up with MQ2, skinnerbox
SEP 17 10:53 PM
https://philosopher.life/#Everquest - You have me reading through my logs now back in 2017...though my brother is telling me it may have been named something else (Rebirth?).
SEP 17 10:56 PM
I loved the servers you could bot on
SEP 17 10:56 PM
Different server, but yeah I scripted for 6 bots. Was a ton of fun
SEP 17 10:56 PM
Were the bots built into the server or did you have to run your own Innerspace or multiboxing?
SEP 17 10:56 PM
What do you mean built in?
SEP 17 10:57 PM
Some of the private servers had bots that you could equip and control from the command line. They were NPCs though.
SEP 17 10:57 PM
Some of them were fine with holding multiple accounts. You could multibox with different ways to handle that.
SEP 17 10:59 PM
There were bots that were essentially autonomous scripts you could run (as you could on live). There's also multiboxing software which allows you to be on one character, but control multiple toons manually (though with some scripting to ease and synchronize).
SEP 17 11:00 PM
Yeah it was full boxing, not botting. And through MQ2 I could write scripts to control all 6 from one
SEP 17 11:01 PM
That is a blast.
SEP 17 11:03 PM
Yeah it was great. I loved it
SEP 17 11:03 PM
Popularion started to dwindle though :/
SEP 17 11:03 PM
