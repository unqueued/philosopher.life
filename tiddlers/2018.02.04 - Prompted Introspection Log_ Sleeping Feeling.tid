title: 2018.02.04 - Prompted Introspection Log: Sleeping Feeling

!! How do you feel when you sleep at someone's house?

I'm not terribly good at remembering my feelings, thoughts, and experiences while I'm sleeping. I'm not sure //what// I'm feeling in that respect. Further, I don't know //how// it works either, although I have some theories.<<ref "1">>

Oh, you mean how I feel "about" it, or when I am trying to do it, don't you?<<ref "2">> I'm often anxious, on the verge of a panic attack. I often sleep very poorly (worse than usual), even after serious preparation (and bringing the tools of sleeping well at my own house). When it is rough, I sleep only half-brained. Part of me stays awake the entire night, ready for fight or flight. I suppose, in those moments, part of me really does remember the feeling; it feels like I'm not even sleeping as I sleep.<<ref "3">> That's the way of it.
