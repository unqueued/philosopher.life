Improvements:

* Move eyes side to side to temporarily increase mental resources available to increase the reliability and memorability of your observation.
* Mentally mark something as important, attaching weight to it, and schedule a training session to recall it in order to reinforce your memory of it.
** The wiki is exceptional at reinforcement memory techniques, remember to remember, and mind palace games.
* Play random music to cause you to space out enough to come back with the answer.
** [[Music: Library]] is amazing for it. That is what I do all day.

Phenomenology:

* The brain experiences time as a function of the energy and resources needed to experience the moment, i.e. pure, immediate phenomenology.
