title: 2020.04.10 - Prompted Introspection: Choosing My Career

!! Explain how you chose your career path.

[[2017.12.24 - Prompted Introspection Log: Career Path]] and [[2018.07.12 - Prompted Introspection: Career Path]] aren't much fun. Wandering has been part of my vocation. I have had the privilege of not giving as much of a shit about what capitalists want from me (though I still have to reason about capitalists quite a bit, especially for those I [[love]]). I've even had the privilege of not giving as much of a shit about what people in general want (though I must still aim for the ideal of [[The Golden Rule]]). It's not that I don't work hard, but it's not what most people consider a career. I'm a dad and a philosopher. How did I choose it?

I've always wanted to be a dad, and I was a philosopher before I knew I was one. I chose these given incorrect assumptions, but I'm still honored to be on the path I find myself.
