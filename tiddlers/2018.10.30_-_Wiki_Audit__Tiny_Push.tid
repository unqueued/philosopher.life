title: 2018.10.30 - Wiki Audit: Tiny Push

It's interesting how systematically walking from top to bottom through this wiki requires touching so many tiddlers. Even a tiny push makes big waves. That's fun. I'm truly moving very slowly. I think, however, that this giant push will make future revisions, edits, and remodeling significantly easier. That said, I'm not actually making ridiculously huge changes to the structure, imho. I don't know if that is a mistake or not.

I am pleased to have the [[Remembrall]] for [[The Remodeling]]. It continues to be useful to me.

I just deleted the [[Vault]] tag across the board. I clearly have no fucking clue what to do with that tag. I think it's ridiculous for me to apply that tag to over half the wiki. I can't do that! ~~I think I want to stick to directories, log audits, and collections for this, e.g. [[2017 - /b/]].~~ [[Log Audit]]  is a more specific function. Specificity just seems better.

I'm cleaning up some of the TW syntax, and I'm also fixing some grammar mistakes.

So, I'm finally through 2017.01. Yeah. This is going to take a long time. I need to make sure that I continue to look at the references (I've forgotten more than once, particularly on logs that I feel confident are already in place).

One thing I'm not sure about yet, and perhaps I need to be, is whether or not I should just be creating tags for the log audits as well. I could do this, but I'm not sure why I should. I wish I understood the performance implications of this. I concede there are possibilities in which the tags allow me to use other kinds of tools with more ease.

The fact is that much content has settled, crystallized, belongs in a narrow thing. The hardcoded linking is already done!

I am worried about the monthly audit in two days. I've converted large portions of the current logs into [[Autogen]]s. 

---

I cannot sing the praises of $:/plugins/inmysocks/TiddlerTool any higher. It's ridiculously valuable for the work I'm doing here.

Is it worth using the "Create new tiddler tagged with this one" as non-journal tiddler? Very possibly. I do not know.
