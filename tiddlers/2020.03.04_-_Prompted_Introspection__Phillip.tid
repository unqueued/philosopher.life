title: 2020.03.04 - Prompted Introspection: Phillip

!! Tell me about an old friend you've lost touch with.

I've said something about Jeff here: [[2018.05.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Old Friend]]. I'll fast-forward to another friendship, Phillip.

Phillip was the oldest child (had a younger sister [[JRE]]'s age) of a burgeoning middleclass family of 4. He was my age, but held back one grade because his parents wanted him to have every physical and mental advantage over his peers (he was fully capable of beginning school on time). This did not work out, imho. He was fairly intelligent, and it seems like he didn't have many friends (though lots of acquaintances). He was a ham, loved drama, wanted to be an actor (even got a masters for it), practiced karate in his front lawn, and lusted after his sister (understandably, she was hot and popular).

His father was a pain-killer addict after an accident, and has never actually recovered from what I can tell. His wife became an extremely well-connected nurse in the town's hospital, and she was paid handsomely for her schmoozing. They lived in a McMansion. The children learned to emulate her Southern charm, no doubt.

Philip was a huge DBZ and Pokemon fan. I quickly joined him. We found them interesting for different reasons. We got along fine, but when I hit high school (and got kicked out) while he was still in middle school, our relationship began to die. They started attending our church, but we began to lose what we had in common. Unfortunately, despite some effort, we still couldn't keep it together. Depth was hard to achieve; he lived on the surface.

Also, as with many of my relationships, I simply hit stages of development earlier than others (which isn't to say this was wise or a good thing). By 19, I had graduated college, got married, was teaching at the high school, and had a baby while he was just beginning his college experience. That's the way it has generally been with most of my friends though. 

He's now a boudoir photographer `/wink` and heavy DnD player. He hit me up right before Trump's election about dealing with Trump-voting relatives. I feel his pain.
