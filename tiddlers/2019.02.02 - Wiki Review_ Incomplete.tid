title: 2019.02.02 - Wiki Review: Incomplete

//Hrmm...It was kind of mistake to make them all up front. I strongly prefer having my [[review]]s of the [[Monthly Audit]]s. I'm going to go incomplete now.//

* [[2019.02.01 - Computer Musings: Phone Failure]]
** I really just want a laptop that fits in my pocket. I've seen several prototypes, but I don't have the money fo' dat.
* [[2019.01 - Wiki Review]]
** Dark Horse Pulse
* [[2019.01 - Wiki Audit]]
** I'm drowning.
* [[2019.01 - TDL]]
** Super painful to read. =(
* [[2019.01 - Prompted Introspection]]
** Good work, but I feel so overwhelmed that I feel like I'm blocking it out at this point.
* [[2019.01 - Link Log]]
** [[kicks]]-oriented linkage in many respects. Extremely high [[S2NR]].
* [[2019.01 - Family Log]]
** Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
* [[2019.01 - Computer Musings]]
** Surprisingly little. Is this a redflag?
* [[2019.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]
** It was a good month, and it pleasant to revisit it through this lens.
* [[2019.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis]]
** This was an explosive log, and I'm grateful. I'm still coming to grips with what this is.
* [[2019.01 - Afterschool Teaching]]
** Emotional, memory-inducing. The story fits.
* [[2019.01 - /b/]]
** Wealthier than usual. I do not know why.
* [[2019.02.01 - Afterschool Teaching: We Are Back]]
** It's good to be back at work.
* [[2019.02.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: No Rules]]
** Edited. Blowing shit up. =)
* [[2019.02.01 - Prompted Introspection: Best Restaurant]]
** Not enough to go back though, lol!
* [[2019.02.01 - Wiki Review: Mouseless]]
** Eh, this will capture whatever I lost well enough for me.
* [[2019.02.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Do It!]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.02.01 - TDL: Saturchill]]
** Deli instead!
* [[2019.02.01 - j3d1h: block ii]]
** Truly all over the place (just like her ol' man). She will have to learn how to mix them. There are no quote extractions/analysis. I realize I moved at a blazing speed though. There are non-trivial moves in here, and I realize she's being humorous. Humor is good. I'll take it.
*** It will have to be drafted again. This can be cleaned up and filled out considerably.
* [[2019.02.01 - 1uxb0x: Scool School]]
** It's empty. Sir!
