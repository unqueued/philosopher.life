* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://interestingengineering.com/could-consciousness-come-down-to-the-way-things-vibrate
*** Even less convinced now. It's a physical description, but it will never have the epistemic definition. A mix of rationalism and predictive coding (dialectically) is the best we've got.

*** Oh, [[TOP]], I'm so out of my league.

*** Assumed only elders and young. That age range surprises me.

* Think About It
** https://www.kickscondor.com/flooding-the-culture
*** Beat me to it. It's sitting there just waiting to be harvested. This one did remind me of [[kicks]], and I see his argument. I've been thinking about his HN post too.
*** What do you think decentralizing power really means? We have to empathically give a shit about each other's stories. As I have said, [[Kicks]] gets that part right; again, I see [[The Golden Rule]] in him (even if he wishes to deny it). My point of contention is not with the preservation of the underground (which I applaud) but a world in which the centralization of power is maintained through automation and dark UX so profound we can't escape it. 
*** I will continue to argue for radical decentralization and worldclass p2p filtering. That is the only out, and the window may be closing. It can't just be done by hand. We go down if the masses do.
*** I still have to spend time leveraging the wisdom of the crowds. I think I use mostly mainstream tools and sites. My link logs are doing something different though. I still popup everyone in a window to see how folks are doing and think about what the stories they tell. It's like my semi-ideal form of FB.
*** I am worried about some perhaps difficult to justify originality+authenticity moves, but the underground is not more real to me conceptually (though it can be more valid or valuable in the dialectic). I only care about "making it your own" insofar as it is justified to the particulars of your context. [[The Beautiful]] is not the overriding reason, but insofar as all other obligations are met, it is the last deciding force. The necessity of preserving freespeech and decentralizing power (including memetic distribution) comes long before [[The Beautiful]] though.
*** The librarian preaches, and I love it.
** https://priceonomics.com/why-did-san-francisco-schools-stop-teaching/
*** My ignunt opinion, dawg, is that you have to introduce algebra concepts as early as possible (2nd grade) and continue to iterate over them. You have to grow the monsters. Don't expect mastery early, but exposure is crucial. My kids were doing [[FO]]L by 7yo. Did they forget TTs and proofs with quantifiers? Sure. The neural pathways are there, and we continue to build them. We've done 2-3 phases now. The next time we do it, we will destroy it.
** https://www.wired.com/2014/03/going-tracked-heres-way-embrace-surveillance/
*** I agree peers and lower classes must hold each other and those above them accountable. We must still fight for privacy against the unjustified variations of the centralization of power.
** https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/25-years-later-interview-linus-torvalds
*** Can't say that's great argumentation about privacy and anonymity. It's not his bailiwick, and it feels parroted. 
** https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/technology/youtube-online-extremism.html
*** I cannot support censorship, but I will support P2P and personally defined filter bubbles.

* Fishy

*** I mean, cmon, I am banned there! ROFL. I'm every bit the tankie fuck too. I part with so many Leftists here.
** https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014
*** Look at the doubletalk and dogwhistling in here. Look at the apology with no actual remorse. Look at the false virtue signal and misdirection. I hope you get eaten first.
