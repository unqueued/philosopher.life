title: 2018.12.26 - h0p3's Log: $600

I have $600 in the bank, $340 cash. I have failed to get one of the computers going (I can sense my brother [[JRE]]'s disappointment up front, and I appreciate that). It's been a loud (literally, everything is loud with the construction) and terrible day. I am applying to jobs. I have a part-time minimum wage job (the first available to me) that won't even keep us above water. There are several things of value I'm trying to sell, and I can't.  I feel like we are going under. I have to cancel the kids' phones. I am not convinced we are going to make it. Call it the end of the line or the end of my rope. It's coming.

My son doesn't try. What's the point if he isn't going to try?
