title: 2018.09.27 - BAGD: Gettier

Very long conversations today.

My son had no idea how long we had lived in our home. His timeblindness and memory problems are serious issues. We spent a great deal of time talking about the nature of epistemic blindness. I walked them through colorblindness examples. I continue to beg him to take notes more effectively. He needs to start seeing himself in the sequences he creates.

Walking through our bookweeding process, we talked about what it means to commit ourselves to our books (or them to us). 

We ran into the Gettier problem. This isn't the first time we've covered it, but I really need them appreciate what anti-luck epistemology is reallya bout.
