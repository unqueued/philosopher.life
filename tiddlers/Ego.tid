Freud, clearly a genius of some sort (whether, how, and why he is right or wrong isn't the point), merits my inspection. He was wrong about a lot of things (I assume, I'm sure, from what I've heard, etc.), but to strike the meme pool so profoundly likely means he struck something important (maybe not gold, but it is possible the toe of a giant). What was his angle? His perspective? What was the crystal he was after? He may have been wrong, but shoulders and giants (different giants).

There is genius inside you. There is madness inside you. We love you. Do not limit the medium. Run with the horses beyond paradigms. Be free and happy my wild genius!

Yeah. We are mortals. We must oscillate. Maybe you are a 21st Century human calling it: bi-polar disorder or multiple personality disorder.<<ref "2">> Those wicked words. We cannot empathize. Judge thee! Condemn! Fight!<<ref "3">> It's hilarious to see how science itself verifies that we lack empathy for abnormal minds (which makes sense; we already know that we fear the unknown, other minds, difference; the unknown is very hard to empathize with). I hope to emerge from my internal battle as a unified, happy creature. That's the goal.

[[R]] thinks I need to decompress. She is right. That doesn't mean I'm right about how I will unwind or what I will become in unwinding (I can't see that far). Problematically, I don't know how to unwind myself. I am tightly bound. 

I accept the Utilitarian equation of my parents. The sacrifice was rational. Move on. It's time to free myself through integration. Admittedly, that sounds like doubletalk. Integration is binding in a coherent, designed fashion. But, this is perhaps just the problem with calling God "good." Adjectives are limits that "box" God in, and even the transcendental cannot escape itself.<<ref "4">>

I'm here to have faith in something (myself) and hopefully other things as well: to take up axioms. I think it is part of being an unmoved mover. The justified unjustified beliefs, objects, and beings (oh yeah, that sounds deep, man). I think Gödel and a mountain of Humanity's geniuses have peered at that deep contradiction. Why should I think I can answer what they couldn't? Maybe I should strive, but it won't be by throwing myself off that cliff.

Okay, let's start over. 

I do have a thread of genius in me. Straight up. Full stop. Period. etc. (do I detect contradiction?). It is a lopsided genius; it does not come out everywhere and for everything. It does not apply to so many aspects of my life. You might think I'm just a weak man with the surprisingly Zeus-like Arm for mental-masturbation. I think there's more to it than that though. I feel the liquid epistemic gold running through my veins. Sometimes, I am virtuous (not morally, but as a practice) by merely breathing and interacting as I normally do. That effortlessness for so many intricate tasks is not an accident. But, before I blow my arrogant-appearing load any further, I also think I'm deeply imbalanced. I have a hard time knowing when I'm being a genius and when I'm being a fool. It is a very wide range. It is our epistemic [[Plight]]. Maybe that is the part of the real bifurcation I've experienced. 

There is a sense in which we must not care about what others think (I don't know if this should count as a lack of empathy though). We should care about who they are, how they feel, how much they partake of The Good, etc. We have to strike the right balance between taking others people's reasons as our own and not. When, why and how: these standards infinitely regress (How do we know the right balance? Who says? Why should we agree and so on, and so forth). 

Now the obviously thing to do is to authenticate with and be guided by authority. It becomes clearer every day that I will not be able to find someone authoritative to wisely correct me on my path. I suppose autonomy is about being your own authority. When you realize all else fails, you can only rely upon yourself.<<ref "5">> Sometimes, and unfortunately on crucial bottlenecks, it can be hard to tell the difference between knowing what I know and feeling like I know. One can be trusted (because he knows) and the other cannot (he only feels like he knows). We all have this. It is the unsolved problematic offered to us by the ancient skeptics. It sucks to be your own counselor and guide; it's hard. 

Yes. This is yet another Gödellian Gateway. Again. =(

Maybe I just need to stop pursuing the Dao of Gödel. Is that hilariously, ironically, farcically, paradoxically: The Way?

What should we hope for? Pursuing the impossible is madness. But, somehow, the possible is merely a shadow of the impossible, and we accept that shadow only because it is has the likeness of the impossible. 

I can say this. I am still convinced there is a profound Transcendental Gödellian Mystery. I cannot comprehend it. It is always there at the edge of my mind's vision; it sits at the doorways I cannot enter; it may even be at the crossroads. I am finally open to the Academic possibility of True Contradictions (IIRC, the illustrious Graham Priest accepts them). Octavia Butler would laugh, cry, and hold me.

The only practical option is to take a deep breath and...confabulate (jk, I think this is reasonable): 

* "Everything is going to be okay." 
* "You should not feel responsible for accomplishing the impossible because it is impossible by definition"
** BUT!!! WAIT!!! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!!!
* "Nobody is perfect."
* "You are on a journey."
* "Do your best and have a good attitude."

Reframing doesn't make it go away. I cannot make that Cataclysmic Binding Spark of Paradox disappear from me.

Oh, I can see the many intelligent spiritual leaders in my life saying this is God. They really do love me. I know it. But, that doesn't make you right. You want to be right (and I want you to be right), but you have not seen far enough. I am still convinced that I have examined this Spark far beyond what you have. This isn't a judgment. I'm okay (and when I'm not, I'm trying to be okay) with your beliefs; they are justified; I do not blame you. I know you fear the relativistic schism (I do too), but it is the only tool we have here.

I'm not Maud'Dib, but maybe I am a lesser, not even a Count Fenring. I am sorry, but I still do not trust your judgment about what that Spark is, what it means, etc. It is clear that your prescription of how to deal with it does not work for me either (although, I grant it works for many people under specific circumstances). I cannot be integrated around it. 

Is it purgatory for me then? I don't know. Let us see what I can make of it.

<<footnotes "0" "It's a fact that people who think about themselves more than others are going to appear narcissistic. It's crucial to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive self-reflection. Adaptive for whom? Who is this 'I'? What counts as adaptive? Why should we agree that is the standard? I don't know. We enter the [[Normativity Portal]] yet again.">>

<<footnotes "2" "Let's be clear. I am not a danger to myself or anyone else. I don't think I would be diagnosed this way (but I think we are sit on spectrums). I also don't think Psychology is even close to unlocking the mysteries of the human mind (it's a joke). We know it is important, but we don't know how much we can trust it. Have you seen the History of Psychology? Have you see how deeply and farcically wrong they are over and over? Why should I think modern scientists are in any better a position? Seriously, when half of the most important contemporary psychology experiments (those experiments which are used as evidence for theories of mind) can't be reproduced, you should guard yourself.">>
