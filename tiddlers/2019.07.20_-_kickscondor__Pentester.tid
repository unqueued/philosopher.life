Dear [[kicks]],

I am sorry. I am not a [[good]] modeler.<<ref "m">> I do not understand your mind nearly as well as you understand mine, kicks. I am lucky to have you tell me when I'm being simply ignorant vs. malicious. Thank you, penetration tester. I am exceptionally grateful to you when you tell me when I'm being an unjustified asshole. Thank you for listening and correcting me. Like a [[T42T]]-filled Federated Guardian Saint Shepherd Enforcer who has chosen not to abdicate in this context, you are my keeper, dialectical P2P accountabilibuddy, and brotherly father-angel to me. Thank you for [[loving|love]] me given what you have and know. 

With great hesitation and hot coals, you pull logs out of [[my eye|Phenomenology]]. You are resiliently hedged and slow to judge me in many respects. Your criticism is rare and thoughtful. You kindly help me see when I am fallen Boromir to your noble Aragorn. Your gracious wrestling with me is a public proof of work I will never forget. Such a transparently secured society, however small or great, it is not immune to attack, but it is resistant.<<ref "r">>

I'd vote for your filthy filters [[kicks]]. I'd want many feeds of broadly humane algorithms which mimic the way you virtuously filter and pick out what is [[salient]]. Please forgive me for not understanding your tool and telos as well as you do.

<<<
Yes, of course—this isn’t clear from the vid, but my prototype requires no server and runs strictly from Beaker Browser. We’re square on that, right?
<<<

I'm sorry. I can see parts of your tooling work from Beaker Browser. I also cannot see the structure of the thing you are exploring and building from afar nearly as well as you can. You are a man who has his hands in more than one pie, so I see multiple signals. I am still squaring away where you have drawn the lines of your position here. I am doing my best to interpret your video, but surely you must say I am not charitable enough.

<<<
I understand if you have your criticisms of that—I do, too! But it’s not federated, it’s peer-to-peer. (In a BitTorrent sense.) So I’m not sure where we have a beef. I don’t want federation. Don’t put me with those people.
<<<

Ack. Noted. This was not clear to me, and that is my fault. I must be missing something. I am sorry for misattributing this to you. 

<<<
This is why I showed the gif of the jacked motorcycle man. It would be pointless bravado. I’m not as lit on the Indieweb as all that.
<<<

Ah, I see. I did not have enough information to know what the jacked motorcycle means. I'm not good at interpreting. I am not sure where you stand on the Indieweb significantly enough.

<<<
I feel like you’re taking point blank headshots here because they make you feel good. I agree with you! Put the gun down already.
<<<

I appreciate your willingness to attribute that to me.
 
`/puts-down-the-gun`

While I know you appreciate the claims, it has not been obvious to me that you agreed on those points. Clearly, I am blind or evil (or both). Thank you for your clarification.

<<<
This prototype is purely to mock up the ‘feel’ of this world that could be. I am only restyling the conduit here—not anything else. To try to look past the ‘newsfeed’ or ‘forum’ view. To me, this is an actual problem—because I see Dat and Secure Scuttlebutt trying to mimic it. It’s paltry, but it’s a piece that still has to be rethought. I guess my thinking is that if I can provide a vision for how a tool like this could work, perhaps that could spark some optimism for ‘progress’ on this front.
<<<

It is very likely the case I do not understand the hammer in your hand or your goals with it here. Even if only a prototype you aren't satisfied with, I do not aim to call it paltry. I think you are meaningfully reinventing the feed; it seems to me you've enabled a more personal construction of what that feed should look like. It appears to somewhat equalize or flatten some signals. 

I must also not be correctly understanding "The Conduit" you have in mind. It looks like more than a restyling to me, but you would know better than I. I see enormous progress in how you scrape and categorize in your feed not for the sake of what is "hot." Rather, to some extent, you are eliminating karma-whoring clickbait and instead enabling each person to have a voice less distorted or tempted by improper incentives.

<<<
This is my same reasoning for using Webmentions or Beaker. It’s here; it’s partway there.
<<<

You have far more experience building software ecosystems for yourself and others. I agree it is partway there, and I'm trying to see how and why your dots connect.

<<<
Tox is cool, LF is cool. I’m just not working on that part of the pipe at the moment.
<<<

Cool. Forgive me for not realizing how your process at large works. Perhaps that part of the pipe will become more pertinent in time. 

<<<
I have some personal urgency—trying to stay on top of my list of ‘others’. Our (your and my) way of messaging works great.
<<<

I have misunderstood what you were saying in the video. You must think I'm not paying attention or not trying to understand you in a proper light. 

I can appreciate your urgency. I see it in your actions. Perhaps I don't understand it, but what I thought I understood of the tool seems exceptionally useful for reading others, especially since it doesn't have to be tied to any particular kind of network.

<<<
 I’m not trying to alter that. I’m just trying to give myself a simple dashboard so I can see what’s going on.
<<<

I'm sorry. I have obviously misunderstood. Sometimes it looks like a simple hammer and sometimes work toward an elaborate one. It looked like you want a dashboard for not only seeing but interacting. I'm failing to do you justice here.

<<<
(By the way, your blog isn’t in my ‘real-time’ feed because Beaker is crashing on the large wiki file size. But I am close to solving that.)
<<<

That makes sense to me. I know you read, and I'm sorry the wiki doesn't quite fit Beaker yet. I have performance and permissions issues I run into with Beaker (I look forward to possible FF integration). It's cool that you are solving it. I hope it fits together smoothly.

<<<
In our past couple messages, you have some salt for the bourgeois types that inhabit all these quarters—some of whom you seem to count as ‘others’ as well—but I am definitely mining this group and very interested in it. 
<<<

Oh, I speak with all kinds, [[kicks]]. Make no mistake: I think most of the people I speak with in [[FTO]] are disturbingly evil, but I will speak with them as best I can. You are a breath of fresh air. I appreciate that you take the time to understand these types, likely far more clearly than I can.

<<<
Perhaps I’m wrong and I’m only granting the word ‘privileged’ some kind of perjorative heft.
<<<

It almost always has that heft for me too. It depends on how privilege is used. It is conceptually possible to be privileged (particularly with respect to moral luck) and perfectly moral with it.

<<<
 The way I see it, the middle class can be a rich source of progression because: they have enough resources to build things and they usually have a strong desire to move out of ‘petit’ status—if this is aligned with a looking backwards to the poor—well, you seem to appreciate LF (made by ZeroTier, Inc.) and Tox (made by TokTok Ltd.)—so you must see some utility in this group, too.
<<<

The middle class has a non-trivial hand in deciding the fate of the poor, though that influence wanes. I do not deny that they, as with all of us, ought to serve our moral purposes in each of our contexts. Insofar as the middleclass does not identify with the poor against the centralization of power, they are not a source of progress. I agree that a fitting alignment is possible and something we are obligated to pursue.

Of course, I have mixed feelings about Zerotier and the communities which shaped Tox (some of whom are not middleclass in my experience). It is possible to coherently deny the validity of their existence while agreeing to the moral value of aspects of their creations. 

<<<
Well, how can you communicate with the public if you are lost in some layers of cryptography and routing deep behind some series of anonymous hashes? Yeah, there can be a network for that—but there’s going to be a public Web that mirrors the sensibilites (or lack thereof) of the mainstream. The ‘surface’—this is where everyone is going to be.
<<<

Including that surface, we have to build the entire internet on such a network. I'm insane, dude, right? Surely this is utterly infeasible, impractical, and missing the gargantuan changes necessary for such a possibility. Most experts will agree with you. 

The Tor network seems to be a solid example (though i2p much closer to the correct answer). It is an over-centralized sledgehammer that clearly enables non-trivial privacy and anonymity while still having a search space, with directories, wikis, and personal sites. No, it doesn't mirror all the sensibilities. 

Even the surface where people use their offline names should be built on such a secure and decentralized network. I'm not talking about bullet-proof anonymity (if such a thing were even possible), but there's major low-hanging anonymity fruit to pick here. I'm seeking P2P mesh empowered by Federation (particularly for human-naming) controlled by the masses, E2EE privacy, with lossy and basic anonymity. One can virtualize the internet (including the web) on top of that. 

<<<
It seems to me that there’s no system that’s uncrackable—so interfacing with the mainstream is just risky. If an utterance can be read even, it can be attacked. (I might be leaking too many details of my life or character, there are chinks in the armor.)
<<<

I agree it is always a risk to be in public, especially under mainstream scrutiny. I agree there is always at least one weakness. We don't have to make it easy, and we can make it much, much harder to break it. We cannot achieve certainty, but we can vastly improve confidence.

I am trying to get to the bottom of it with you. I'm sorry if I'm not being useful to you here. I appreciate your thinking aloud with me, especially when I'm infuriatingly wrong in so many things.

<<<
And I will go to the camps when it’s my time. Daniil Kharms did it. For writing that a carpenter fell out of a window—no one understood it.
<<<

Heaven forbid it. You are a man of honor, sir. I know it, and it is my privilege to know you.

<<<
 Can a technology really save us from this?
<<<

Broadly, yes. This is not the first time you have asked. This is worth your exploration. There is fundamental progress to be made; you are correct about that as well. Techne is a two-edged imaging sword. It can be used to represent us or enslave us to various [[dok]]. I must sound like an insane utopian transhumanist or something. Yes, technologically empowered justified governments are possible, but that does not make them likely. You know my prediction. Yours doesn't look very happy either, understandably.

<<<
Slash hug, dawg.
<<<

`/hug`

<<<
 Always glad you even take the time to listen. When you say we ought to have ‘privacy and power’ for our voice: I don’t even deserve to talk. I do realize that.
<<<

You deserve to be heard, and we need to hear what you have to say. There aren't enough people who can see what you can. I am a shitty listener. Obviously, I'm still not seeing everything you are yet. Thank you for continuing the conversation and clarifying. I will continue to think about what you are saying.

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
