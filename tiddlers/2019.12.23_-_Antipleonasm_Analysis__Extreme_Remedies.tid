title: 2019.12.23 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Extreme Remedies

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
; Extremis malis extrema remedia.
: Extreme remedies for extreme ills.
<<<

Not always*.<<ref "f">> Extreme problems can have simple solutions in some cases. What I like about the spirit (rather than the letter) of this principle is its pointing to a willingness one ought to have to accept the necessary means to our ends (assuming the ends are justified). 

Many people are willing to accept the need for extreme remedies so long as they don't have the pay the price. //Yeah, man, like, someone should do something about that. Viva!!// When someone has their own skin in the game, and especially when it's a sacrifice to even take the risk, people tend to curl up into egoistic conservatism (often politely masked as something else, "civil moderate centrism," "anarchic individualism," and so forth). There's a "wake up" and "own it" in here which I admire, but there are too many exceptions to wield it blindly. We'll just rotate between this and //Aegrescit medendo//.
