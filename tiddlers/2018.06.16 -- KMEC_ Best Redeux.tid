I believe you did your best if and only if everyone has done their best by definition. I deny the consequent, thus I deny the antecedent. Your failure is tremendous. I could forgive that, except you still haven't learned your lesson; you still cause us this pain. You don't think you are culpable at all. You really don't take responsibility for yourselves. You are psychopaths, and you disgust me.

We put down our tentpegs, and it turns out we are enemies.

What you really mean when you say you don't want to "revolve around me," i.e. know what I'm thinking and develop an accurate theory of my mind, is that you don't want to pay the price to empathize with me. Understanding my point of view destroys large swathes of your identity; the meaning you attach to many of your memories disappear when looked at more objectively. I am a dangerous man to wrestle with in the dialectic.

Repent, sinner.
