DEAREST [[h0p3]],

THERE IS SO MUCH WE'D LIKE TO SAY, & I'D WANT TO WRITE... I'M AFRAID OF "MAKING MISTAKES" OR SAYING ANYTHING THAT WOULD HURT YOU OR BE MISUNDERSTOOD.

THIS CARD, THE BOX, & THE CONTENTS HAVE "NO LAYERS." THERE IS NOT ANY MANIPULATION OR CONTROL INTENDED. NO GUILT. NO DISAPPOINTMENT. NO ANGER.

WE SIMPLY, PURELY, IN THE MOST HEART-FELT WAY POSSIBLE WANT TO EXPRESS TO YOU, WE LOVE YOU.

EACH ITEM IS "INTENTIONAL" THAT WE SEND TO YOU. SOUP, BECAUSE YOU USED TO ENJOY IT A LOT. CIRCUS PEANUTS, BECAUSE. -> YEARS AGO, YOU ATE THEM. (PRO'LY TOO SWEET NOW?!) CHOC. COVERED SUNFLOWER SEEDS --BECAUSE CHOCOLATE MAKES EVERYTHING --EVEN fAVORITES -- BETTER, RIGHT? THE GREEN BAG ON THE BOTTOM--I'VE BEEN HOLDING ON TO IT FOR YEARS FOR YOU. I THOUGHT OF FRAMING A SIDE FOR YOU, BUT WASN'T SURE IF THE PIC WOULD MATCH YOUR DECORATING PREFERENCES. I WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS BOOK-TITLE BAG, THOUGH, BECAUSE OF MEMORIES LAUGHING OVER WHO WOULD END UP WITH 1 COPY WHEN  YOU LEFT HOME. (I THINK IT WENT WITH YOU!) I LOVED SHARING THE BOOK WITH YOU, AND THOUGHT IT TOUCHED YOU TOO, MY FAVORITE REASONS/PARTS WERE: 1) THE ERA & CHALLENGES; 2) THAT, FROM A CHILD'S VIEWPOINT VERY ADULT CHALLENGES WERE INTERPRETED, & 3) THE RESILIENCE OF THE MAIN CHARACTER & HER FAMILY MEMBERS, DESPITE HARDSHIPS, SADNESS, & FINANCIALLY OVERWHELMING CIRCUMSTANCES. RESILIENCE & FINDING HOPE -- EVEN WHEN ALL SEEMED DARK. THE PEPPERSEEDS -- BECAUSE I READ: "PLANTING A GARDEN IS HAVING HOPE IN TOMORROW." I KNOW YOU LIKE PEPPERS, & DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A PATCH OF SOIL OR A POT TO FILL & WATER.

FINALLY, THE LITTLE COASTER. IT MIGHT FIT BY YOUR KEYBOARD. THERE IS MORE THAN ONE BOOK NOW, WRITTEN THATUSESTHELINEWHILETALKING ABOUT THE PARENT/OFFSPRING (DIDN'T WANT TO USE 'CHILD' AS YOU ARE GROWN!) RELATIONSHIP. REALLY, DEAR SON, ->(TO BACK) (TAPING THIS ON TO INCREASE NON-GLOSSY WRITING SURFACE) WHEN I SAW THE "I LOVE YOU MORE" COASTER, AND THOUGHT ABOUT THE STORIES WRITTEN USING THIS LINE, I REALIZED THE COASTER WAS MEANT FOR YOU! IN EACH OF THE BOOKS (THAT I KNOW OF) THE SENTIMENT IS EXPRESSED AS AN AFFIRMATION.  OOPS! A REMINDER. A CONFIRMATION.

NO MATTER WHAT. NO MATTER WHERE. REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE, PERSPECTIVES, WHERE WE'VE "BEEN" OR WHERE EITHER OF US "ARE." OUR LOVE F[[FO]] YOU IS REAL. CONSTANT. WIDER THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. DEEPER THAN CAN BE GONE. FARTHER THAN YOU BELIEVE; TRUE. UNCHANGED. UNCHANGING. SO, IT IS YOURS. WE HOPE YOU CAN RECEIVE IT, & MAYBE LET IT HAVE A PLACE ON YOUR DESK. WHEN DAYS ARE DARK, HOLD ON TO IT, IF YOU CANNOT RECEIVE IT RIGHT NOW, PERHAPS FIND A SPOT TO KEEP IT FOR THE FUTURE.

LOVE,

MOM & DAD

funny that I started cutting from the bottom! =) ->
