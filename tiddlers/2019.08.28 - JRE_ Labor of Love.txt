Been showing my knife off to people. I've had more than one person tell me I should keep it safe; they said they wouldn't use it either, lol. Lots of knife collectors around here.

I like reading about your work.  I feel so sluggish and tired often, having the energy to be empathetic with my household is daunting.  Reading about your labor of love to a bunch of strangers'  kids is both encouraging and  humbling.

I wouldn't doubt it if you might be some of these kids first experience with someone loving them enough to do more than mere crowd control

Also, if that kid keeps fucking up your cards, slide one atm style thru your butt cheeks and give it to him as his bookmark
