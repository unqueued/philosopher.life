!! Audit:

* Draper was a disappointment. He wasn't even cleverly evil. Wrestling him was too easy.
* I let it fucking rip in here. I tell these characters who they are, what they mean, and what they deserve. Plenty of merited "fuck you" and KYS.
* I'm trying to find good things to say too. I'm lucky to stumble upon something positive to say. I doubt the motivations of almost everyone here.
* Footnotes do work here. I love having a log that regularly uses footnotes.
** What am I doing wrong everywhere else?
*** You are nesting comments right now in a list!<<ref "i">>
* Hrm. This is a place for unpacking [[/b/]] and other random thoughts. Will I use this for digesting my own personal writings as well?
** I have no idea if that is a good use of my time. I hesitate. I think handling other interlocutors is more important.
*** Your past can act as that though.
**** So can nested comments.
* Hrm, this log audit sent me down a tiny rabbithole. Odd.
* Rand and I tend to be polar opposites. It's doubletalky and dogwhistly to me.
** I really fucking hate her. She made me sick. The "Rand-hole", lol.
* The KKK was a vacation.
** Auditing in order matters here. 
* <3 Diogenes. But, I knew that. 
* !! This month has been dictated by more openly accepting my faith (whatever that is and is in).
* I am pleased to be rabbitholed here. [[Wiki Audit]] seems the more likely place.
** Speak of which, that dropped off the map.
* The are cogent enough. It is clear that I write to myself.
* [[Sphygmus]] nailed it.
* This log is filled with moral philosophy. <3
* Many of these make me angry, but not all. These can be the most intense logs I work on each day. 
** This log makes me feel older. It is draining, but I think it is a worthy sacrifice.
* I feel like I'm practicing my deconstruction more than my construction here. It's [[hlexical]] too. I'm getting practice wielding my blades here too, not just sharpening them.
* [[title.Title]]s have been on point. They are fun for this log.
** In fact, I've been jestery here. Over the top disgusting. =)
* There are some excellent, stunning moves in here, not just gap-filling and dot-connecting.
** There's plenty of meh and probably some shit in there too though.
* Yeah, there is a [[Process Discipline]] here. Few, if any, will read these words. It's a lot of work, but I'm still glad I do it, even if only I read them. This matters to me.
** This is a ridiculous amount of work.
* I'm pleased I look at the words divorced from authorship and context. It has a kind of New Criticism dimension to it too, I think.
* This is the first month I've had the chance to do a real [[audit]]. I finally have a picture of what the log is about, and I'm pleased to have it.
* I'm glad I step on "civility" here. Fuck off.
* Some of these I have read several times. They can be a joy to read. Lots of keepers in here.
* This month has been a stunning pleasure. It's been hard work, but I am forced to commit. I'm living loud and clear in this log.
* This audit took a long time. I cannot zoom through these. I have to fucking read and think. It is rare that I can't smash through my own work.
