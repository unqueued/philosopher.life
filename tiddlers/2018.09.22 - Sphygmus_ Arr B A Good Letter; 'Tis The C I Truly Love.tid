title: 2018.09.22 - Sphygmus: Arr B A Good Letter; 'Tis The C I Truly Love

Ahoy thar, sPhyGmuS!<<ref "pir">>

''__WOW!__'' You are blowing my mind with your gift! Lol, I'm tickled; this is amazing! I've received many gifts in my life, but never one like this. Most people have a very difficult time trying to find a gift that fits me.<<ref "mtg">> This has to be the most tailored gift I've ever received in my life. It's not like you just slapped my name on a sweater (or digital friendship bracelet); you built a sweater that fits me like a glove (and it's forcing me to think about what it means for something to be my sweater, lol). I'm not even sure how I think about it. It may take me a while to process what it means for someone to write a practical tool<<ref "t">> just for me. 

As a pipefitter, there are overly specific tools and hacks we use only for our trade; we have to build them ourselves because you can't buy them. This is like someone walking up to me, analyzing my pipefitting process, understanding why I do it the way I do it, and forging a very particular [[antipleonasmic]] tool specific to the way I do pipefitting. I've been gifted tools before (which are among the best gifts one can give, as it demonstrates that the giver empathizes enough to value the means to the tool-user's ends), but never one so perfectly forged just for me (or forging something for my forge that forges itself; I don't know how to say it). What does one say to such a personal gift? 

''Thank you, Sphygmus. I'm moved.'' 

This is now the second kind of tailored gift for my wiki you've given to me. The cost of this tool has more to do with empathy than most people would realize (though, clearly you know that; I simply must state it out loud!). It is a powerful experience to accept a gift I cannot repay. I feel powerless and vulnerable to it, and it's a good thing. I wish I knew how to put it into words because it means a hell of a lot to me. 

Your wiki is gorgeous, btw. I can immediately feel the work on several devices. I'm thinking about ripping quite a bit of it, lol. The last time I did any serious HTML work was 20 years ago. I'm interested in the default TW mechanics you've chosen too.<<ref "rm">> There are lots of little things which add up here. I may not be a good wiki pilot, but I feel the flight deck you've built.

I've been excited to see your drafting. I like how you break big problems into smaller; there is clean sanity to how you do it. I have the habit (lots of paper writing) of throwing it all into one big container, shuffling, mixing, connecting, etc. until I'm not horrified by it. Unfortunately, I almost never know what I'm trying to create until it reveals itself to me in the process. My mind leaps around, and often I didn't even know I needed to connect some dots until I think about how others will see it (not my strong suite). I have to work the objects on the screen like lego; I can't be productive any other way.<<ref "pr">>

What's exceptionally different for me here is that this is the first time I've ever seen someone's drafting. While it may not look like it (to my chagrin), I have poured enormous effort into [[2018.09.17 - kickscondor: Dogmackic]]. I know Kicks tells us he's online two days a week (regarding the Kicks identity, at least). I wonder if he has peaked and had similar frustrations watching it unfold; it's been interesting to have the letter evolve while watching his site change too. You have mentioned something like it as well. I think this open drafting process provides a transparency like watching glass-blowers make their art. Now I want to reach out and respond to drafts, but I'm not sure how to do it well. I must remember that proofs evolve, and there is often a difference between where I start and where I end, even at the core. It's a hermeneutic circle (or spiral).

<<<
Once again I am going to drop a lot of threads in this letter. I apologize, and hope you will forgive me. You are generous in granting that it might carve out salience - I worry that I am avoiding your lines of questioning. I don't ''want'' to avoid them; I want to pick up all the threads and go down all the rabbitholes because there's so much there to be explored!<<ref "gb">>
<<<

I'm very pleased that we can carve out the salience together. I know that feeling of avoidance (but, you know that...you see how much avoiding I do in this wiki). Let me suggest that it's something you'll sit on, mull around, and digest. As to the rabbitholing, I am having a blast reading through wiki, btw. The threads are explosive! I would like to know how you want me think about your drafting, how I should respond to it, etc. You're giving me the gift of being able to see what it's like for others to interact with my wiki. Thank you! It's important to me that I respect what you commit yourself to and what you've not committed yourself to [[irwartfrr]].

You have a fascinating argumentative style with yourself where you start crossing things out. It's awesome. I need to find a good way to implement that problem solving approach. I'm having to learn the hyperconversation language on the fly here. As you can tell, I ain't so good with the grammar and syntax (though I try), but I am interested in how they work. Strikethroughs seem to be this super useful device where I wouldn't expect it. Seriously, it's like handwritten tests or letters where one doesn't have time to make it look all purty and gussied up. When I don't have to be formal, strikethroughs are a powerful device, leaving evidence and giving another story-building mechanic. I would have thought digital writing would have ended the practice rather than giving me even more reason to rely upon it! I like acknowledging the negation of things this way.

<<<
<<footnotes "gb" "and yes, I definitely go back and reread! Helps keep everything straight, and me from either repeating myself or missing something I'd drafted elsewhere and wanted to include.">>
<<<

As you probably know, I fight the urge to be an information hoarder. With serious effort, I've been able to let go of thousands of books (not like I'm reading them anyways). I've even stopped collecting video since I have consistent access (though, I still maintain a floating, loose library queue). My warez collections are usually irrelevant. There are some things I cannot minimize, dispose of, export to others, or not take responsibility for maintaining. My most important files continue to be the things I've made and participated in. Many of my crafts (excepting my computers) fade in their memory and value, but my words and stories I tell myself continue to be important year after year (especially as my memory is clearly dying). Locke and Hegel seem to be right about how we causally imbue ourselves into objects (including persons, and I do not mean this in an "objectifying" mere means sense) when we mix our labor into them. That makes our conversation something I want to preserve. It matters to me because I do reread them too!

I'm considering having my daughter build a script to download your site nightly and commit to git repos. Our conversation got wonderfully super entangled real fast with the introduction of your wiki (it was already that way on your end, but now I am getting to take it in). I mean this as a compliment: even with the order you bring to the chaos, it's messy and fragmented! I so much want to make sure I preserve the authentic magic of it to whatever reasonable [[dok]] I can, to be able to reproduce the conversation (gonna require that own the data), and to be able to see all the parts fit and flow together.

Let me say that the first couple months of my wiki are lost. I don't have the origins. Oh man, I worked really hard on it too (even though it looked like a complete pile of shit)! I cried many times writing just a couple paragraphs. It was so costly! It was like hell getting myself to speak with myself at all. Looking back, I regret not having those snapshots and the ability to "go back in time." I want to feel and see through my old eyes once again. The Vaults in my wiki serve a different narratival purpose than the snapshots. Both, imho, are super valuable to how I understand myself and my project. 

I just want to make sure I don't make the same mistakes and "lose" large sections of our story. I realize this cannot (and perhaps should not) be perfectly archived in many respects. There are decisions you need to help me make here, please. What do you value and require?

<<<
At the same time, whoo boy. Being out of school for two years, I had gotten used to having few other constraints on my time other than work. I'm slowly getting into the routine of classes in the morning and then working in the afternoon/evening but the first few weeks really took it out of me, both physically and mentally! I still feel horribly guilty and ashamed of my past academic failures<<ref "st">> so I worry that I'll fall back into old patterns. I have to trust myself that, since I both don't ''want'' to procrastinate my schoolwork and withdraw from class and also don't ''want'' to avoid your questions, I will do neither of those things! I hope you can trust me too, and understand that work and school and some of my IRL connections come first for me on the priority list.<<ref "!!">> :)
<<<

I can see you are tending your wounds here. It sounds painful and also like a comeback story of tenacity to stand up again. You know me: I have lots of questions (always with the questions), especially since it is part of getting to know you. However, I take it you are getting to know yourself in this regard, and I want to give you the space and comfort to be able to safely answer those questions for yourself first. Answering the "Who was I?," "Who will I be?," and "Who am I?" questions is an absurdly monumental task (at least to my eyes); of course, there are many philosophers who doubt even the possibility or meaningfulness of answering these questions (e.g. they deny the very notion of personal identity entirely). I take it you are still working your way through it, proving to yourself who you are. I hope your wiki will help you heal yourself!

You aren't alone in this pain. I ended up just dropping out of academia entirely (after investing some ridiculous amount of my life into it). I don't think I wasted my time completely (no, I'm very grateful for the opportunities I've had), but I feel the pain of not achieving my goals and even being so radically wrong about what goals I should have been pursuing (hell, I'm probably still wrong, lol). I don't know how I can be of use to you, but at the very least, I can be your sounding board. I will think about how to compute on your behalf.<<ref "ou">>

Also, I do trust you! I hope that you trust me when I tell you that I trust you when you tell me...Lol. In Trusting Trust, I take it on faith that you are indeed one of [[The Others]] doin' her best. I tend to think To-Do-Lists are an optimistic version of To-Don't-Lists. [[kickscondor]] is correct in this respect (though I may be putting words into his mouth): we should pursue the ability to be informal, more lossy in computing, and trusting in our ability to extend into different kinds of asymmetries with each other.

<<<
<<footnotes "st" "I have been a perfectionist procrastinator for the vast majority of my life, and though I know who I am now is not who I was then, I'm still not confident in the completeness of my change. Part of the reason for my wiki is this: to maintain an awareness of where I'm at so that I can take action if I need to.">>
<<<

OMG, I know that feel!

Like any good journal, the wiki is a strong "accountabilibuddy" tool (that doesn't mean I'm using it well!). I don't think I'd have survived the past two years without it. Sometimes it is like a friend I lean on, and sometimes it is my most fearsome wrestling partner. Only a crazy person wrestles with the distorted image of themselves in the mirror, right?

FWIW, it sounds to me like you are doing your best.

<<<
<<footnotes "!!" "Don't take me the wrong way - these letters are a priority for me too. I initiated the discussion - I have an obligation to either continue it or directly disengage!">>
<<<

I must relieve you of this pressure. Don't worry about it, lol. You've more than held up your end of the [[T42T]]! Go easy on yourself, girl. Treat yo' self. You are holding yourself to too high a standard here (which I very much appreciate). I know you play the [[T42T]] game with me. You've got to balance a giant heuristic equation of life here. I feel that weight! If there are weeks you cannot respond, seasons of life, or whatever, that's the way it is! I will not think less of you (though I may worry if you aren't responding after long enough periods, which is totally normal). 

I want to point out that we are talking more often (which is awesome, btw!). There's a Dunbar Number problem here and we're hitting some major limits to this medium (limits aren't necessarily a bad thing; it's exactly what enables creativity in many contexts). It's an increasing logistical challenge for me to systematically weave everything, and I'm clearly failing to model this accurately enough out loud. That's okay, something must be working well!

Will it be okay if I start dropping or being reductive with threads here and there (I am slow to do so)? Yes, it is more informal and relaxed. I will move towards a less quote oriented style with you (though, my goal is still to weave hard), especially since your wiki is now a much better explanation of your thoughts than I'm going to be able to represent here. Also, even though you described it to me, I clearly didn't see it well enough until you literally showed it to me. You avoid the ugly blockquote-and-response in a visually appealing way, and there is something there! I need to sack up and figure out how to do that too. I'm wondering if the the "create tiddler tagged with this one" would be good for that.

It seems to me that I need to start differentiating //Letters// from quick //Messages// more appropriately too. You've noticed how I stack multiple messages and don't atomize all the content. Yes, I am lost and jumbled here; we'll figure it out. 

I'm excited to learn how to engage in hyperconversations with you. We'll take it as slow and scenically as we need to, eh? 

<<<
And I see connections! This week in my anthropology course we read an article focused on gifting practices in hunter/gatherer societies. We discussed how often on the surface in our American culture, gifts are seen as having "no strings attached"<<ref "cav">> compared to other cultures where they are //all// about those strings, about building and maintaining and making explicit the varieties of relationships and reciprocity between people. You use the vocabulary of the gift in your letters and I think it's very fitting. While not physical objects empathy, consideration, kindness, attention, honesty, etc. are absolutely gifts we exchange to establish bonds and connections, and those gifts are especially clear in the practice of exchanging long form letters.
<<<

Nailed it! Your letter has already pre-emptively addressed much of what I have to say about this current tool you have given me too. 

<<<
<<footnotes "cav" "though we then went on to discuss the various unspoken/implicit counterexamples.">>
<<<

Indeed, I think there are many layers to that NSA gift-giving. I think we can trace the memetic lineage of these social conventions and come up with game theoretic explanations for the evolution of these practices, some of which have [[T42T]] roots and others [[T4T]].

<<<
I know that collections of the long-form letters of writers/philosophers/thinkers exist, and I think we follow in their footsteps here, even if it is online and not through paper. (Though it is is a nontrivial distinction - letters have a built-in time delay because of the post office and the physical distance of their travel.)
<<<

That time delay issue is something I keep butting up against. While I'm drafting, new material keeps cropping up. I have to go back and systematically refactor my work in virtue of the new information, fit the pieces together, etc. I'm not saying anything you don't already see here, as made quite evident in your wiki. I'm just trying to reason out loud about it because it merits further inspection. 

<<<
Wiki code has a much lower mental cost, though. While it wasn't a direct challenge or request, I knew I wanted to set up [[the button|$:/plugins/sphygmus/reviewButton]] as soon as I saw your wishlist. I hope it is useful for you! If not, I would like to hear what changes you'd want to see in it.
<<<

Unrelated first: do you think you'll be trying out different markup code in your wiki? I'm thinkin' about it. I seem to get along just fine with TWcode though.

Alright, so I'm obviously ridiculously biased. I'm gonna continue to reveal my ignorance here. You should start firing shots at me, telling me this tool is some diamond-encrusted ~~crutch~~ Segway, and if I were a real user, I obviously wouldn't want to make use of the tool you've built. It's so damned awesome!!

Using your tool really brings TW to life for me. I'm already addicted to it. It's bliss to just click a button and boom (after 600ish days of doing it by hand). To me, this is a fundamentally improved version of the "create a new tiddler tagged with this one" and "create a new journal tiddler tagged with this one." I'm kind of shocked that your work isn't already created: it's that functional to me. Why is some version of this not a core TW feature?

Why don't people want static lists of links? How much better is it really to dynamically generate this content? I just don't see it. Even without that component, I still don't see why the "create new" tiddlers aren't built that way. Perhaps it's because people have a tendency to build one wiki for one thing (unix, yes, but I think we should break the rule here). Trying to unify a bunch of different journals into one wiki isn't the norm.

This tool you've built seems like a perfectly natural and default obvious way to use this tool (but, something might just be wrong with how I think). At the very least, even if I'm wrong about how to use TW in this usecase, you've built this wonderful transition tool into eventually using it "correctly." I'm still just convinced I should never give up storing at least the basic metadata in the title itself though. How about you? What do you think about using your own tool?

I've decided to have two tags on one of the logs (yay!): Carpe Diem + Carpe Tempus Segmentum. This may be a mistaken way to create hierarchies of tags. What do you think?

Since Titles are the "unique" IDs of TW, why aren't there more tools to automatically generate them based on rules? This seems like a basic file-handling operation. It's especially weird that there's no option to change a Tiddler name and have TW parse through all the tiddlers and change the links too. Am I crazy here? The more I look at your tool, the more I feel like it's the right way. Am I just being obstinate here?

You made this so ridiculously easy to install for me. Thank you. I'm using the all-in-one button! One-click wonder!<<ref "rv">> ~~Is there a way to open all the tiddlers it creates in the story river?~~ I'm going to play around with it to see if I can add more buttons. It seems like I should make use of this plugin for lots of logs.

~~I'm going to practice using this without the PH title.Title (when it matters, I will add by hand). I'm also going to look for a way to click that button and have a popup input bar that would let me enter a title.Title (YYYY.MM.DD - Foobar: title.Title) before it creates the tiddlers and inserts the links. There are logs can get away without it, but some really should have a title.Title to help me reason more effectively (I'm not sure why yet). In cases where a title.Title is necessary, however, it is actually faster for me to CnP and rename, then click it open. One way around this is to...AHHH Wait! I see what you built here. Jesus. I'm slow.~~

~~`** Auto-Wiki-Mator-Button` showed up when I expected `* Auto-Wiki-Mator-Button`~~

If you are interested, [[j3d1h]] was looking at the code in [[$:/plugins/sphygmus/reviewButton/stringify.js]] for her CS today.

```javascript
            var entry = value[t] || "";
            //if(entry.indexOf(" ") !== -1) {
            result.push("\n* [["+entry+"]]\n"+"**");
            //} else {
            //    result.push(entry); //this one
            //}
```

It appears to be working. 

I ran into another cool thing. I'm sometimes getting a partially mangled title.Title:

`Friends and Fpmily` even when [[$:/plugins/sphygmus/reviewButton/settings]] shows it correctly.

I hope the bugs don't bother you, btw. I'm pretty sure I've never actually written a single piece of useful code correctly the first time (you've seen my code too...it's a joke!). I'm having fun here, and this is useful!

<<<
lol! Nope, you didn't misunderstand anything! The settings was meant to be set-and-forget, b/c I've just been going back into the focus tiddlers and manually editing the links every time, after I decide what the title.Title is going to be. (I tag the logs mostly b/c it acts as a quick click back to the focus/root.) You were definitely thinking one step ahead of me in seeing that the settings could be used to change title.Titles on the fly! :) Now that I've realized this, though, I'm going to build a better solution than the settings page, hopefully something that will fit well into your Hub.
<<<

Actually, you don't need to make it fit in my [[Hub]]. I have to work really hard to keep it as clean as possible because it is my central directory for navigating (often, I don't even know where I'm going when I look at the list...as dumb as that sounds). I'm going to keep it in [[Core Daily Requirements]]. I think what you've got is already amazing here, and I'm not sure how to improve on the UI you've already built. I'm playing around with that `:` `;` look (definitions, right?) that you use (yeah, it's pretty snappy).

<<<
> It seems many major wiki users I've seen are spinning up multiple wikis, one for each task. Do you think you will go this direction? What do you think of trying to unify these tasks?

I can see possibilities for having multiple wikis. If I decided a "day job/work" wiki<<ref "eg">> would be useful, I would keep it separate from my personal wiki.

<<footnotes "eg" "Here I mean a wiki with nothing in it but work tool/project documentation, brainstorming, and general reference: probably shared.">>
<<<

That's what I've been trying to convince [[k0sh3k]] to do. She just uses her personal one everywhere though. That's cool. I think it makes for an interesting institutional knowledge repository. Having different wikis for different privacy contexts makes sense to me.

<<<
 I don't see the point of splitting my link collecting out into a separate "bookmarks" wiki though - that's what my browser bookmark toolbar + folders are, and I don't see how single links in multitudes of tiddlers is useful.

On the other hand, I do have single links in tiddlers, tagged "to ingest," but I'm not satisfied with that. I collect //so many// things to look at but don't have a dedicated way of dealing with them, so it ends up just being a pile I never look at. It would be nice to develop a system that feels right and works well for me in that regard.
<<<

I think there are different kinds of bookmarks. I build tools, collections, read-laters, breadcrumbs, hyperreading crashcourses, stream-of-conscious thingamabobs, and bibliographies. Perhaps two different projects will have some tool-links in common. It's a thing I'm still exploring too.

Tiddlywiki is a very weird collector's tool. It's so insanely flexible while being self-contained that I'm not even sure how to talk about it (and given how much time I've spent in this space, I should know better). I understand the "pile I never look at" syndrome. My [[Link Log]] is a pile I don't look at often, but when I'm searching, it comes in quite handy. With automation (especially machine learning), that pile may become something quite useful. Yeah, you are correct; I feel like we still have to keep developing what fits us here. I get that feeling like there's simply too many possibilities, and I have to narrow it down an idiomatic way of reasoning.

<<<
Hm, someone in the google group mentions having a wiki for their worldbuilding - I could potentially see doing that too - it's such a unified theme that maybe it hangs together and works best on its own - I don't have any such project yet that couldn't be built within my personal wiki.
<<<

My cousin [[L]] is using it for DMing in [[Dungeons and Dragons]]. I'm trying to convince her husband (who is trying to become a fiction writer) to use TW for his character bibles, plotting, etc. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm worldbuilding and roleplaying in here. I'm not very experienced in reasoning about this kind of thing though.

How do you think you will be integrating your wiki into your art projects, if at all?

I have the wiki madness; I don't know what shouldn't be wikified. It's like any cool tool; I just want to start using it everywhere and everything. But, damnit, I really do want to see everything re-written in [[Rust]]!

<<<
The thing about topic specific wikis - I could build one within my personal wiki and never have it interact with any of the other parts! I control what links where and is connected to what. While having it all-in-one doesn't make sense in a physical notebook that can get "cluttered," the same doesn't seem true of the digital. (The wiki might take up more storage space or be slower to load, but that's not the same thing as organizational clutter.)
<<<

It does look like sub-wikis are possible. Beyond naming, I think it only becomes unfun when you want to have different system components for different parts of the wiki (though, it appears this can be handled). I have not noticed significant performance differences as my wiki grows either (which is kinda surprising). Certain tiddlers do cause lag.

<<<
Starting up another wiki for public things has been interesting. It was a great chance to refactor a lot of my personal code from the layering of ancient cities into a neat Chicago grid. Switching back and forth between the two wikis is annoying ("have I fixed this bug in both places?") but hopefully once I transition my personal wiki onto the plugins I created that will lessen.
<<<

Lol. That is a great analogy. I think my city looks more like Boston. I take it you will eventually migrate into the plugged gridded version, even for your private wiki.

One thing you have me superexcited about is the ongoing technical relationship between your private wiki and your public one. So, to be clear, I have a private wiki I use to store basic contact information, passwords, keys, etc., but that content never crosses into this wiki, particularly because I don't do my thinking in the private one. Your case is different and more interactive. I'm not sure how to safely and automatically build a good process/channel between your public and private wikis. Perhaps it is something that simply should be done by hand. Maybe I'm talking gibberish here, but I imagine that is a neat problem you are facing.

What kind of tooling is best here? What are the different approaches to thinking about this? I will be interested to know what, if any, toolchain you might use to merge and push tiddlers wikis. 

In fact, I'm really ignorant about the best ways to just make Tiddlywikis "talk" to each other. We're in some variant of [[Zawinski's Law|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski]] here.

<<<
Jumping straight to your concern about representing my authorship in your wiki - you see my solution demonstrated here! I was //enormously// pleased when I realized I could set up css per tag, so your letters are written in, well, your voice! If nothing else, there's one thing tags are good for. :)

I'm guessing such a thing satisfies to some [[dok]] the representing-authorship-question for you? I don't have any code written for a "from sphygmus" tag in your wiki yet, though I have tried drafting it several times. I'm trying to figure out how I visually want it to look...the grey theme of my wiki looks fine with your black tiddlers, but the opposite, grey tiddler on black background, just looks washed out! I have considered a light grey background with black text, but I don't know if that goes too far beyond the color scheme of your wiki.<<ref "font">> What do you think?

<<footnotes "font" "And I can't decide what font to use, either. Somehow the monospaced font I use doesn't feel right on your wiki to me, so I'm leaning towards a plain sans serif, but then which one?? I want it to //feel// right! | My visual sense is largely intuitive - I struggle to explain //why// a certain font works in a certain situation despite having strong opinions on such.">>
<<<

I hadn't even thought about representing your authorship that way until you grinningly showed me it could be done (I didn't know that was a realistic possibility, lol). It's the right touch! I will go back and tag "from sphygmus" (or whatever you prefer) when the time comes. I'm still being lazy in how I tag, though I'm definitely coming around (I love tagging "Draft" now). I'm excited to have your signature here.

My requests are that you don't directly embed fonts or images (I am trying to be conscious of my filesize), and that you keep it at least semi-darkmode friendly aesthetic so that it will be easy on my eyes; grey is fine! I'm colorblind too, so...I'm a really bad judge of what is aesthetically pleasing for you. You've seen my sledgehammer forced font approach (it's a gross hack). I'm worried that might be a problem for you, but I think a stylesheet should be able to work around that (right?). Go hogwild, lol!

<<<
That's all I have time for right now! I'm really itching to get this online and sent to you - I'm so curious if the wiki button will be useful to you at all.

cheers,
sPhyGmuS
<<<

Indeed, it is useful! Thank you very much. 

Last on the docket, which you've clearly seen:

Even though we converse publicly, which is important to me, I'm having a hard time thinking of you as just a public friend. You've stunned me. At this point, you've demonstrated you care more about me as a person than most people who call themselves my friend or family IRL. It's time I let what is left of my guard down and make myself more vulnerable to you. I know it might feel weird for you (and, feel to say, "no, it's cool, I don't need it, I like things the way they are") and perhaps this will never be useful to you (we'll probably still simply spend our time writing letters over the wikis),<<ref "f">> but I want to give you my real name and contact information.<<ref "e">> It will be up to you how you choose to use it. I don't know your {[[Principles]]}, but I'll have to trust your judgment. Should the occasion arise, I'd like to be in arm's reach for you as I am for my family. Let me know if you want my information because it's yours if you do.<<ref "m">>

While I will still tell you what you mean to me, [[Sphygmus]], I don't need to so cautiously inspect and state who I think you present yourself to be outloud for the sake of my safety or modeling accuracy. Your actions do all the talkin'. We've established real trust with each other in the desert! You've also clearly earned the moral right to shape me and my wiki (you already have!). So, unless you want it back up, your direct information will remain removed. Several tiddlers have changed. There are still very obvious breadcrumbs, including these words. Whether or not you maintain your current site, and what information you also currently have on it is, of course, up to you. I'm going to let you decide how much further you want those breadcrumbs cleaned up: tell me what you want excised or modified, please. We can still change quite a bit (though, not everything can be changed<<ref "for">>).

I'm not sure how much you've thought about the etymology of your name, but I think it serendipitously turns out to modify my words in a beautiful way.

Sincerely,

h0p3

<<footnotes "mtg" "For example, back when I played MTG, unless you very thoroughly considered my collection and writing (I've considered grafting my thousands of MTG posts into this wiki), you probably couldn't buy non-staple Magic cards for me. I'm touched by how perfectly your gift fits my project.">>

<<footnotes "t" "//Tool// is a very special philosophical word for me. I am no expert in it, but the word imports a great deal of conceptual content into my working memory space.">>

<<footnotes "rm" "Which reminds me...I need to clear mine up. I usually test things and wiggle my way towards what I really use.">>

<<footnotes "pr" "My wife isn't messy like me though. It stews in her head (she doesn't even have to think about it consciously most of the time...disgusting!), and then she walks up to the keyboard and spits it out 99% as she wants it the first time (her process can only create certain kinds of things, but I'm still envious, lol).">>

<<footnotes "ou" "I take the [[Outopos]] project to have far reaching implications not just for how we should design distributed silicon computing, but also distributed wetware computing communities, like our brains ;P.">>

<<footnotes "f" "This probably doesn't give you faster access to me over messaging, except over the phone.">>

<<footnotes "e" "Yes, I believe if anyone wanted to dig for it, they could find me. But, I believe it is a non-trivial gesture. To be clear, even [[Lion Kimbro]] didn't have access to my information when he phoned me. You'd be the first.">>

<<footnotes "m" "I was thinking about mailing you my card (my daughter helped me make it), but SMS/E-mail is faster.">>

<<footnotes "for" "For what it's worth, anyone digging deep already owns us both on this front.">>

<<footnotes "rv" "Thank you for explaining the widget. That was a thoughtful heads up. It is my guess there is something you have seen which you do not mention out loud (I'm convinced you aren't the only one either). My brother has said that you walk backwards with a blanket into my tent to cover my drunken nakedness. I appreciate your now multiple signals (including the orphans and something of mine you've reproduced in your own wiki) which demonstrates you quietly offer me artificial privacy on the matter. It's a weird human experience. You must be thinking to yourself: 'Does h0p3 have no shame? Jesus Christ!' Lol. I am that over-the-top IRL too; sometimes I feel like a cartoon of myself.">>
