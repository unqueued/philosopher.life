The Transliminal Earth Alliance Metanarrative, or T.E.A.M., is an activism toolkit and holographic mythos.
<<<

This reminds me of [[The Original Position]] quite a bit. Activism I can appreciate, but is this a realpolitik cult? I am interested to see what you mean by holographic mythos. We are stepping outside of traditional philosophical language here. I'm not opposed to doing such a thing, but I will [[Straussian]]ly try to learn your language. Paranoically, I am worried about a kind of subterfuge in this work. We'll see how it goes though.

I see a lot of internalism in your work, it reminds me of [[Meaningness]] too. Let's see if you really are more than coherentist, idealist, constructivist, non-cognitivist, internalists. It is fascinating to see you think you adopt a nondual perspective, as though you've risen about the dialectic. I consider it equivalent to having claimed to solve the fundamental problem of philosophy itself.

The problem with western civilization is the oedipal complex, and the incomplete status of the project of mass enlightenment
<<<

Claiming to the know the core problem of //western// civilization may be hubris. I'm going to put you to the test. I am reminded of Orientialism here too. I think the vocabulary of western civilization is rich enough that you should be able to express a semblance of your thesis in fairly standard terminology. It is a redflag that you do not seem to be able to express your point of view in standard philosophical language yet claim to understand that language. I will run with your redflag in charity.

The [[oedipal complex|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex]] has a storied historiography as a concept in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. I will be interested to see your take on it in this context.

Enlightenment doesn't seem to end for we [[fff]] creatures pursuing [[The Infinite]]. I would argue this is not just a problem with western civilization either. I'm not even sure if it's actually a problem, in a sense. It's not up to us.

<<<
Very briefly, the Oedipal complex shows up in the way people orally fixate to external sources of authority, suckling on their (president's/sports 
team's/teacher's/guru's/celebrity's/corporation's) ego instead of moving the locus of authority within themselves.
<<<

Yeah. That's internalism, and one of the logical consequences of that perspective is epistemic and normative relativism. It's a form of question begging. Kant may (and the Neo-Kantians do) seem to skeptically take up a similar position. I'd argue you make one of Nietzsche's basic postmodern points and then construct your own authority inside your own mind. 

I agree that faith, the taking up of our {[[Axioms]]}, is methodologically internalist. The judgment about the objective accuracy of our subjective perspective is not internal to us though. The fact that 2+2=4 is external to me. I am not the ultimate truthbearer, even if I'm the one responsible for methodically coming to understand that external truth.

Why do you get to justify yourself all the way down? What justifies that? On such grounds, I get to claim my subjective experience is just as valid (or more valid) than yours because I've constructed as such.

Note, of course, that your authorities are all finite agents (humans in this case). The authority I'm pointing to is [[The Good]]. It's metaphysics. I make no claim to its agency. There is a difference between [[The Moral Law]]'s authority over you and whether or not you choose to bind yourself to it. I agree with the internalist that it is up to us to freely choose to be constituted by [[The Moral Law]] as our core algorithm, but I do not agree with internalist who thinks [[The Moral Law]]'s normativity and content is socially constructed. Social construction is a heuristic methodology for coming to understand the external world better, but that construction is just a sign pointing to the externally signified.

<<<
 This practice forms many incomplete people into a transpersonal blob, collapsing individual autonomy into a flow of resources to, energetic investment to (emotional/advertising/replicative), and political assent to being ruled by, and moreover becoming literally a part of, the authority.
