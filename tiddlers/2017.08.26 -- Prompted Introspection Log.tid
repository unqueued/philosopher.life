!! If you could any animal, besides a human being, what would you be?

A dolphin. Sex, food, play, 24/7 awake, and still Dasein. Done.

I know my wife will hate that answer. I don't know what to say. It's the best answer to the question. I also think this shows that I care about myself and being Dasein. I care about being alive, conscious, and happy. If I can't be human, then I want to be as human-like as I can be.
