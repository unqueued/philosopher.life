title: 2019.08.19 - Afterschool Teaching: Blinking

Whitney showed up way early today. She did everything. I was left with nothing to do. I organized our game closet. I found a PS2 and Wii in there, with guitars for le hero. I'm going to be asking if there's a TV we can use. 

Whitney and I actually talked about things which matter. It set me on fire today. I ran around blinking into the world as myself. I was literally there.

8HM and I talked about her project. It's an autobiography with interviews with those who know her and 4 stories that define her. We had an explosive conversation. She's been lost, and apparently, it's due soon. Ugh. Perfectionism. I'm glad I checked. I feel bad that my girl feels like there's nothing interesting about herself; so I took her to task on that comment with every ounce of disdain for the claim I could muster. We did some brainstorming, some philosophy, and by the time she left, she had a gameplan and a rich outline. 

Bacon took 5th with the VP Parker. I took 6th and 8th after some hunting. My whistle kicked complete ass. One blast, and I had silence. Gorgeous. Painfully gorgeous.

We hit the library. I had lots of discussions with students. I was the hardass with my favorite ghetto students, and we discussed what it meant to show respect (not an easy concept, ofc). We're going to learn how to do this right. I let it rip a bit today too. The animal in me flashed for a second. 8Jm even saw that I could possibly be violent if I chose, lol. I saw him see it. I wasn't as tentative and careful; I flashed signs to silence or hold, shot people up and down with instant answers, and we flowed. I was in my state machine element.

Magic, and even 6NP joined us! Is the world ending? I handicapped, but it wasn't enough. I destroyed my children. Maybe we'll cockatrice it up? I need them to play some real decks. 

We hit the lab. I spoke with 7?Lm and his brother 7?Cm with a complete rabbithole through Marxism, Tiddlywiki, education, virtue theory, brain development, welding, motocross, social security and retirement, unions, consciousness, etc. They paid attention. Did I drink a luck potion today? Our discussion lasted for an hour and a half. It was almost a dialecture because they were responding in bits. They are trying to buy thumb drives (Apple users and multiple dirt bikes; these kids have money). I'm going to get some for 8Gf and those who I know don't have money for this. Since I officially don't have permission, it might be easier to get away with it if it doesn't come out of the school's pocket. 7Cm has a plausible deniability account of his phone (showed me it, was beautiful). 8Gf and I talked about securing her wiki, the nature of journals, the fallibility of our memories, etc. I think I'm going to have them all encrypt it from the get go. 

[[gh057]] has confirmed we are on for Saturday. His wife will choose the time for us, and if I'm forced to pick, I'd say we do it at 4pm (but anytime is good for us!).

Smashed through my paperwork. VPParker's was hilarious. He's making it up. He knows what it do. Delp gave short answers today to my [[smalltalk]].
