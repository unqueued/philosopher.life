!! Audit:

* I failed to accomplish a lot of my longer term TDL's. When I did succeed, I feel like it was obvious that I would. The exceptions were towards the end of the month. Once I was on the job march, it aligned more clearly for me.
* My sleep schedule wasn't great, but it wasn't awful.
* I seem to fall asleep more effectively to Venture Bros and Archer than the alternatives.
* My son is rarely ill. I'm glad it turned out to be a small thing.
* Noobliss is a new trend. I'm fine with it. I'm more focused on it.
* The lamb has been absolutely wonderful. I'm glad we got it. It's been a treat for us.
* I feel lucky to be able to walk so much with my wife.
* My circle of friends continues to shrink down further, or my awareness is more accurate?
* I finished off some shows this month. That's cool.
* I'm glad I made the switch on KS.
* Heavy blissfulness, no doubt. As heavy as any month in my life, I believe.
* We ate like white trash royalty.
* I got a lot of reading done =). I'm very pleased about that. I'm glad I'm back in business. I want to continue that trend.
* D2 came and went. I will hopefully go back to it one day.
* I also got drunk several times this month. =/
* I might be sore from working, but I'm very grateful to have my almost minimum wage job. I do not know how others survive.
* Here's what has surprised me: I've not had a huge problem switching my schedule. It's kind of neat.
* My wife has been more bitchy as of late, according to my logs. =/ I hope it's not my fault (and it probably is).
* The kids have been cooking more often. This is excellent. I'm very glad they are picking up these practical skills.
* Talking about D2 somehow helped cure me of it.
* We had less Informing the Men than most months, but I have been quite horny
* I've been jonesing for hashbrowns in the past couple months. This is odd.
* Zlam has been pretty decent on me. Will continue to use every few weeks (tolerance build up is insane, and I also don't want to ever use it often).
* This month has had more about my donors than I would have liked. That has not made it easy on us.
** I think I handled it with grace.
* I've had some half-brained sleep multiple times in the past month. This is normally quite rare, and only something I experience in places where I feel unsafe and highly anxious. I suggest my donors are part of the explanation, but I'm not convinced it is the full explanation. 
* I'm actually proud of my daughter's tiny hack. I hope she continues. 
* Also, Jabba is back. I love warm weather for this.
* I did feel fairly depressed several times this month, and I was aware of it.
* I'm proud of my son's woodworking goals. I hope he dives in. I want this to be his thing so badly! I don't know anything about it, and that's cool. I'll do my best to be as useful as I can to him.
* Somehow, life feels like it has normalized somewhat, even with the changes. 
* My philosophical moves back to Platonism have been a valuable tool for me.
* I will be interested to see what my brother does with the koolaid consideration. It is clearly an important shot from my donors at both of us. I don't know if he will see it.
