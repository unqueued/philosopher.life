Hey! It’s okay. Getting that “gosh I hate work” drag again. Plans with friends are piling up. I’m just so tired, and I feel like [[K]] and I just need a break.

[[K]] sounds exceptionally stretched.

You may need to sacrifice plans with friends to continue the hunt, as unfun as that might be.

I'm sorry about the drag. =/

A break sounds good though.

Especially after he graduates.

Definitely. For me to clear my head and for him to finally take a load off. He’s been getting so stressed lately.
