title: 2019.05.18 - TDL: Family Time! =)

* Family Time!
* Graft 2 weeks of chatlogs, and fix the missing tiddlers too!
* Roast sounds good
* Son's computer needs to be up and running asap. 
** I would like to teach him about AHK too. We've been playing Clicker Heroes together (some fun math and modeling in the game), and I'm hoping we could explore making different kinds of bots for sections of the game.
** Would be nice to have some sort of USB/KVM-esque multi-output switch.
* House is fairly clean, but you should do some laundry.
