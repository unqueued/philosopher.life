So what are your plans for the weekend?
Feb 14 2:57pm
How's your weekend? How are the boys doing?
Feb 16 1:57pm
Hi Iâ€™m sorry I forget to check signal.  Weâ€™re all good. I have some minor drama at work ðŸ™„ but itâ€™s in gods hands so I canâ€™t keep reliving it. The boys are great- Esteban & I are getting ready to start deciding if we move back home or keep on keeping on here.
Feb 17 8:39pm
Oy, that is a big decision to make.
Feb 17 9:51pm
I assume Esteban is largely in favor of it.
Feb 17 9:51pm
No he actually isnâ€™t- but weâ€™ll see we both hve pros and cons
Feb 17 9:53pm
Whoa, neat!
Feb 17 9:53pm
He has changed his mind, I think.
Feb 17 9:53pm
TN growin on him?
Feb 17 9:54pm
Lol by far but there is a lot of opportunity to build our business here. Which he wants me to focus on instead of nannying- heâ€™s right and I know we have not been focused on the right things. So. Thatâ€™s to say the least about the situation.
