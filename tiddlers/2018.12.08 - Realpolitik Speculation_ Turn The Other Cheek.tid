title: 2018.12.08 - Realpolitik Speculation: Turn The Other Cheek

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

Beware those who call upon you to "turn the other cheek." Of course, it is game-theoretically correct to [[T42T]]. Yet, I have seen this phrase used as a weapon.

In yourself, whose cheek are you turning in the [[self-dialectic]]? We are two homunculi wrestling with each other. Sublation of that is also us. That's a fancy problem. Your homunculi must take up the perspective that each of them is really free as in libertarian freewill. The sublator must be [[ehyeh]]. We must prevent [[irwrongfrr]] derealization while using it to change our [[4DID]] [[irwartfrr]].

Yes, you internal compatibilists have lost your fucking minds; you've let one side win to infinigress. You have halted in the [[self-dialectic]].
