!! John Grisham and the New Economy Thriller

I've read a few Grisham novels. I'm actually not convinced by this argument. It seems like one could make the case that he's arguing we shouldn't trust those in power. It's not just government, it's also capitalists. Legal books are going to focus on legal systems. I see the tort sexiness, ofc. David vs. Goliath can be found. The lack of attempting to point to any real methods that aren't miraculous is a problem in his books.

I agree that risk-taking is worshiped when it shouldn't always be. Of course, I also think the world may be ending, and we are going to need to take huge risks and make large sacrifices to succeed.

You too could be a winner in the New Economy! You just have the wrong attitude, right?

!! Dean Koontz and the Problem with Power

Okay, I swear I've read at least one Koontz book, but I can't pick out anything on that list at all. So, clearly I haven't!

Fascinating neoliberal dichotomy: ascetic rejection but aesthetic exercise of power. Oscillate, confuse, false compromise? 

Foucault as bedfellow. Unfortunately, I don't know what that really means.

Author rejecting power is fascinating. It's clearly false.
