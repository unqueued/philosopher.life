* Rice Pilaf, fruits and veggies
* Oh, I like that you've started work on [[The Beautiful]].
** Ummm...GL! =)
* Herd your cats.
* The WoW grind isn't seeming worthy enough. Run with it, eh?
** Why grind if you aren't absolutely sure you want it in this case? It can sit there just fine.
* Supplies are running lower in the house.
* 401k and CC. We should prepare for the possible event. Not clear they will pay for relocation.
* Smooth whatever you can at your workplace. Be sacrificially constructive if you can.
