Lol, not a new joke at all, but hilarious to hear from my 11 yo nephew
JUL 11 11:30 AM
Yeah, I was joking about them eating all the chips instead of having breakfast food, said "y'all motherfuckers eating all my food"  then asked if they had ever been called that before and they said only by each other lol

Would love to be a fly on the wall when they are going at it rofl

They don't do it in front of me much at all. I have an extremely low tolerance for their bickering (which is not argumentation for the sake of debate). Given the hundreds of times I've seen them do it, it can get ugly.

My wife consistently points out how our relationship as siblings is exceptional. She says it is rare to find brothers who care about each other and maintain a relationship so persistently and with depth as ours.

I can only hope that even though they "go at it," that they will have an even better and richer relationship together than we do (which is a tall order).

Lol [[1uxb0x]] just asked if he can live with [[j3d1h]] when they get older, cause "we are besties"
JUL 11 11:36 AM
They have already spent more time together than most people do with any other person in their lives.
