!! Audit:

* I desperately don't want this to be monotonous, useless, or a place I'm ashamed of, but ironically, not desperately enough.
** Admittedly, what is [[salient]] seems to be a constantly moving target and goalpost in my contexts. I don't aim to lack discipline!
* I love that I started writing my [[TDL]]s a day in advance.
** I gave up on the date formatting for now. Perhaps one day that can be fixed.
*** *Ahem* -- [[TDL]] for some future version of me is going to hate this garbage I foist upon him, lol.
* The Monthly and weekly logs were a worthy experiment.
** They make so much sense, but I don't. I am embarrassed.
* I have not found a way to contain the 10,000 things.
* This log is the best evidence for ketamine. Ugh.
** Hilariously, I even say that in its [[Log Audit]]s.
* I've failed to create a running [[TDL]] list that works for me.
** WHY!!?!?!
** I need to get slapped in the face with it.
** I need an answer for my children especially! They need to know how to do this, and I'm terrible fucking rolemodel.
*** The anxiety is overwhelming.
* I am proud that [[TDL]] has taught me to switch gears, triage, and be happy with better-than-nothing effort. Those are non-trivial takeaways.
* OMG, reading this log makes me hate myself. =(
** Alright, cool your jets. 
*** You are hereby forgiven for 2018, sir.
