title: 2018.10.14 - ALM: The Discussion

```
I have been having a hard time deciding why I chose what I chose.  I am sorry for stringing you along like this.  After reading your wiki, and I know I did not get everything, but I got enough to feel confident in the choice I gave you.  I would see the following happening.  You and your donors would have a meeting and the tension would be so thick you could cut it with a knife.  Your children would easily pick up on this and this tension would only ruin the time that they did get to spend together.  Just being near each other would set you all on edge and would be a bad experience for all involved.  I read that you have instructed them to not proselytize.  That is the very thing thing that, being who they are, they cannot refrain from.  It is a clash of very strong wills and the real victims in that case would be your kids.  I am very much loathe to give the opinion that I did because I know that there is a connection between parents and their offspring and their offspring's offspring.  Not having this connection would be a loss.  However, proximity for you all would be like bringing a match in proximity to a powder keg.  Even if you were all silent and did not speak to each other besides simple, meaningless pleasantries just the look that one would give another in various situations would speak volumes.  It just wouldn't work.
1 hour ago
 I also know that I am not a very good friend and I show that by the delay in getting this information back to you.  I have basically had to pry it from myself as I did not want to come back to the subject over and over again.rad
1 hour ago
 Also, I have thought about conversations by phone and they would basically suffer the same way as nothing more than pleasantries that are meaningless could really be shared anyway.  The items in question would certainly be shorter and I would guess a bit more tolerable if conducted in this fashion - but it is not really a possibility to bond over just the telephone or other similar electronic forms of communication.  In being asked this question by you I have also had to think of my own relationship - or really lacker there of, with my own mother.  I really should reach out to her more.  Yet, this talk should be about your question and not my own.  Again, I would say that the reaching out would not be recommended.
1 hour ago
 I appreciate you thinking on my behalf.
1 hour ago
 You raise good points.
1 hour ago
 If I were to engage them, it would be in writing.
1 hour ago
 The situation really makes me think of something a bit comical and silly.  It reminds me of WoW.  The unmovable object and the unstoppable force.  What would happen if they were to collide?  Your donors are of a mindset that by their very nature they cannot abide fully by the rules that you set down.
1 hour ago
 To contact me in writing?
1 hour ago
 I agree they would not do this, but I think their psychopathy becomes quite obvious in writing.
1 hour ago
 in the case of writing, I would say that every syllable would have a different meaning behind it than the one originally portrayed and this would not be fooling wither party.
1 hour ago
 That's exactly why it would have to be in writing. It enables real analysis.
1 hour ago
 From the correspondence that you have shared and analyzed from them what I have read there seems to be a great gulf between you and I do not think that it can be spanned.
1 hour ago
 I agree it will not be spanned. I do think they "can" in fact span it if they wanted.
1 hour ago
 that is why I hold them responsible
1 hour ago
 I would be scared to wrestle me in writing too, of course.
1 hour ago
 I think it requires commitment.
1 hour ago
 Do you think they are morally obligated to attempt to reconcile with me in writing?
1 hour ago
 When I think about it from their perspective - I get the sense that they cannot convince you to make the changes (in thinking and understanding the world) that they would like to see take place, reconciliation I see them calling it.  I don't agree with quite a good bit of material that I have read from you but I know that I am not able to even dare to begin to try to dissect and to criticize in any effective way - so I avoid trying to do so.    I think that your parents would be in a much better position to take up that challenge, but as you say it would take an extreme amount of commitment and also good will that I do not believe is there at this time.
1 hour ago
 What changes do you think they would like to see take place?
1 hour ago
 Do you have a right to disagree with someone that you won't wrestle with?
1 hour ago
 Do parents not have that obligation/commitment to their children?
1 hour ago
 part of the problem may be that you have not stood in the room during personal interactions, so you do not quite see why having it in writing is crucial
1 hour ago
 To answer the second question first, I would say that a person does have the right to disagree with someone that they will not bother to wrestle with.  They get to choose the hill that they are to die on.  They would not be unwilling to do the wrestling but I would think that no matter of wrestling that they would do would enable them to actually be able to claim any sort of victory that they would define.
1 hour ago
 I think people don't wrestle with me because they scared deep down that I'm right.
1 hour ago
 Would you blame them to be scared?  I have felt that same fear.  I know that whatever I say or do I have never been able to change your mind on something once it has been made up.  I always held in the back of my mind the notion that one day I would change your mind and it would be of great consequence - it seems like that dream is not ever to come to pass.  I don't even know if dream is even the right word.  It has only been a thought that I have had in the past.  it would be the way that i would repay you for all the good that you have done me.  where this idea came from I don't quite know.  Why I tell you about it know, I also do not know.
1 hour ago
 I agree it is unlikely that you'll change my mind directly with a counterargument, though you do shape how I think. I appreciate that very much.
1 hour ago
 I do blame them for being scared.
1 hour ago
 For people who held me to such a high standard, I expect the same from them.
1 hour ago
 If I had to listen to them for decades, they should listen to me for at least a couple years.
1 hour ago
 The fear of being wrong is not a moral justification for not wrestling with me.
1 hour ago
 If you aren't willing to be wrong, then you have no right to claim you even have the truth.
1 hour ago
 What would you say that your goal in such encounters would be?
1 hour ago
 Reconciliation.
1 hour ago
 What would that look like?
1 hour ago
 I'm not entirely sure what it would look like.
1 hour ago
 Being able to speak with each other, maintain a consistent communication channel, empathizing with each other
1 hour ago
 It would entail practicing the golden rule, accepting our moral responsibilities, and likely a good deal of epistemic humility
1 hour ago
 Currently, I would wager that both parties cannot even agree what all of those items are.  Am I wrong?
1 hour ago
 I'm not able to guarantee their position. Mine is sitting out in the open though, and I've done my best to continue constructing it so they could get to know me if they wanted.
1 hour ago
 I think they would agree to what I said.
1 hour ago
 We have a disagreement on what counts as the application of those principles, but I'm willing to take them down to the very bottom of it.
1 hour ago
 I really do think they lack integrity.
1 hour ago
 May I be so bold as to ask why?
1 hour ago
 You may.
1 hour ago
 I will preface this by saying that someone reading my wiki should be in a relatively good position to know why I think they lack integrity.
1 hour ago
 Integrity is about being able to state and defend your principles as coherent whole, and to have the resilience, openness, and will to modify what is wrong with your systematic perspective and resulting behavior.
1 hour ago
 It is both an epistemic and moral property of agents.
1 hour ago
 They aren't interested in doing so. In fact, what they do in private is different than what they do in public. I aim to be the same person in both.
1 hour ago
 I would be the first to admit that there is very likely material that I did not read that you have written on this.  What I did read did not lead me to believe that they were not interested.
1 hour ago
 They have known about my wiki for 2 years, [[ALM]].
1 hour ago
 If they wanted to read it, they would. If they wanted to engage it, they would.
1 hour ago
 Do you think that they have written you off?
1 hour ago
 my father, absolute...you should hear about how he speaks of his sons in private, lol.
1 hour ago
 my mother only partially
1 hour ago
 As I said, my wiki is a litmus test. They have failed.
1 hour ago
 It is a bridge that will last though.
1 hour ago
 They could always come back and try to understand.
1 hour ago
 And, I think they are morally obligated to do so.
1 hour ago
 How would you like it if your mother walked around to your friends and family telling them you were a drug dealer? Lol.
1 hour ago
 To be honest, she is more than welcome to do that.  You and I both know it would be wrong.  This is a bit different as those whom my mother would speak to in that way mean nothing to me.  Perhaps that is the more damning of the two.
1 hour ago
 I would argue that the sitaution you are in has many more consequences
1 hour ago
 This is one of the reasons I'm so transparent in my wiki. I want to be able to dispel their lies.
1 hour ago
 I want evidence.
1 hour ago
 I am curious, what do you mean by evidence?
1 hour ago
 Evidence in your defense?
1 hour ago
 As in: I aim to demonstrate that who I am, what I've done, how I've thought, and how hard I've actually tried here.
1 hour ago
 Yes, before The Moral Law.
1 hour ago
 and my family
1 hour ago
 I legitimately think I've been wronged.
1 hour ago
 And, I've tried private reconciliation.
1 hour ago
 Now, I moving public with it incrementally.
1 hour ago
 I'm going to take them to task for it.
1 hour ago
 And demonstrate my innocence
1 hour ago
 By some miracle, if all involved parties in your family read every last keyboard press of your wiki, do you think that they would believe that of the two parties that you would have the more defensible position as to why such an such was done at such time in your life?  Or, would reading all of it convince others but not them?
1 hour ago
 I think others outside my family can see it. I think my family can see it as well. Whether or not ?[[MWF]]? and [[SLT]] will remains to be seen.
1 hour ago
 There's a reason [[JRE]], [[AIR]], and I do not speak to them.
1 hour ago
 I don't think you have to read every last keyboard press.
1 hour ago
 I would be the first to admit that.
1 hour ago
 Though, I am not convinced you really have studied my wiki very much over the 2 years you have known about it either.
1 hour ago
 In any case, there are two questions left:
1 hour ago
 (1) What changes do you think they would like to see take place? (2) Do parents not have that obligation/commitment to their children?
1 hour ago
 I would also not argue with that.  It is a fact.  I have poked around here and there.  What I have seen has scared me.  Thar be dragons yo!
1 hour ago
 Hehe, well, I hope that you will continue to study it. It is evidence that you are my friend.
1 hour ago
 1) I am not for certain what they would like to see take place.  I can imagine a few items but they seem far from the here and now.
44 minutes ago
 2) I need some more explanation on this obligation
44 minutes ago
 I was just scrolling up. The full context is there. I can reiterate though.
43 minutes ago
 Do you think they have an obligation to read and write with me to reconcile?
43 minutes ago
 Would you owe your daughters that?
43 minutes ago
 Surely you can admit, I have bent over backwards to explain my point of view.
42 minutes ago
 You certainly have not fallen short in trying to explain your point of view.  That does not mean that they like or agree with your point of view or methods and reasonings behind it.
41 minutes ago
 It depends on what you mean by methods here.
40 minutes ago
 I'm not claiming they will like it or agree it, of course. I've been abundantly clear in my wiki about that.
40 minutes ago
 I also understand their point of view extremely well, and they haven't taken the time to understand mine.
40 minutes ago
 I'm willing to discuss matters I disagree with quite clearly (I have enormous amounts of evidence in the wiki to this effect as well).
39 minutes ago
 That it's not fun to wrestle with what I have say doesn't mean my friends and family aren't therefore obligated to think about it with me to any degree or kind.
38 minutes ago
 I do think they should read all of it though. Parents have radically stronger obligations to their children than other kinds of relationships.
37 minutes ago
 I want you to make sure you are distinguish Description from Prescription here.
36 minutes ago
 What "is" and what "ought" are different things.
36 minutes ago
 My prediction, of course, is bleak.
36 minutes ago
 That we predict others won't live up to their moral requirements does not eliminate their responsibility for meeting those obligations.
35 minutes ago
 I will say for sure that i never had a good conversation that involved the words is, ought, and obligation.  This talk of obligations comes off to me as an excuse for something.  This could just be another area where I disagree with you.  I don't see where they have an obligation to hear you out when it is all that they have heard before and where you also do not have the obligation to not bring it up since they are your parents.  I am very unwilling to admit to many obligations at all - even between parent and offspring.  You are grown now and they might see you as a failure for them as it comes back to make them look bad in the eyes of their flock.  I think that you believe that you have an obligation to the truth as you reason it.  Their mental calculus for truth is perhaps based on other mathematical systems.  Perhaps similar differences of understand underly the differences between you.
26 minutes ago
 Why doe sit come off as an excuse? (That is an odd implication)
25 minutes ago
 I think some of the most important conversations I've ever had boil down to talking about ethics (literally: "what ought we do?" "who ought we be?" "what do you owe to others?").
25 minutes ago
 Why do you think they have this before?
25 minutes ago
 What obligation do you think I have to my ?[[MWF]]? and [[SLT]], again?
24 minutes ago
 I know I make them look bad to their constituents, but that is no excuse, right?
23 minutes ago
 You sound like a moral relativist in saying there are different pursuits of truth and we aren't required to reconcile them, as if there is no objective answer.
23 minutes ago
 Again, you talk about description but not prescription.
23 minutes ago
 I do not follow what you mean by description but not prescription
22 minutes ago
 You are attempting to avoid the discussion of morality.
22 minutes ago
 I guess that you could say that I am trying to avoid as much of a conversation on that topic as I can.  Perhaps, like ?[[MWF]]? and [[SLT]], I do not know how to win any sort of argument on that ground with you.  You asked me what obligation that you have to them.  I would say that you have the obligation to tell them the truth and no more.  They have no obligation to accept that truth that you give them.
16 minutes ago
 I can see that.
16 minutes ago
 I appreciate your honesty, [[ALM]].
15 minutes ago
 Thank you for thinking about it with me and wrestling. I know you greatly dislike it.
14 minutes ago
 It is meaningful to me that you try anyways.
14 minutes ago
 You are a friend.  But, I am a poor friend for you perhaps.
14 minutes ago
 I am going to say goodnight for now.  I hope that this conversation has been useful in some way for you.  I have done a poor job of what you asked me to do.  Forgive me.
9 minutes ago
 Night, sleep well! ttyl =)
```

[[k0sh3k]] thinks he has an opinion which he doesn't want to state, that he's offered a weasel answer, and that maybe he's not really my friend anymore. That may be correct. [[k0sh3k]] and I walked and talked about it. It's obvious he was just trying to get out of actually thinking about this with me. It appears, as I feared, he tried to offer advice and not actually back up his claim. How can a man offer his friend advice without having studied the context?

I have been told by several people in my life that they have no idea why I maintain a relationship with [[ALM]]. They are convinced he's not actually my friend, and when push comes to shove, even [[ALM]] will admit that. I have bent over backward for that man many times (I went into debt to help him and his family), and he barely even tries for me. I'm okay with the fact that there is asymmetry in our relationship (I consider it my duty). [[ALM]] has been attempting to cop out of trying to understand me (to the best of his ability) for at least the past decade at this point, and that appears in the above discussion, as well. I get that he's scared to own up to the possibility that he has it all wrong (he will switch over to not pursuing the truth as soon as he recognizes that he's unlikely to have it). He doesn't want to be shaped with me, and he fights underhanded to avoid his moral responsibilities. I have seen these moves a thousand times from him. I've long held out hope for him as a person (beyond what is rational), more than he deserves. Is this it? Perhaps [[JRE]] is correct and this is a sunk cost fallacy.

=( It's time to play devil's advocate full force here. Let's flip the charity switch and try the other direction. His motivations may simply be dark-triadic, and maybe I shouldn't hope for anything better.

I asked the question on [[2018.09.17 - ALM&Jop: Advice]]. It was clear that you'd need a lot of time and effort because I'd be wrestling with your advice. To my knowledge, this is the only major request I've ever made of you (and, frankly, a significant friend in your position would already have been doing this all along: I have for you).

Jump to [[2018.09.29 - ALM: Wiki]]:

<<<
I'd have to say that you have quite the decision on your hands. Based on what all I have read on your wiki, things between your donors and you are in much worse condition than I had at first thought.
<<<

You've had two years of opportunity to read my wiki (and years more than that to appreciate my struggle). It's not like I've been nonchalant about it. I've regularly brought it up. You could and should have been speaking with me the whole time about this issue. Looking through my call records, I've been trying to stay in touch with you, not the other way around (you've gone months not responding to me). This relationship has been primarily a 1-way street. That you are ignorant here is your fault. I've been trying to explain it, and you've not been listening. This is a systemic problem in our relationship. I think you just use me, and I'm tired of defending you as someone who is actually my friend for two decades: no one else paying attention thinks you are.

Your ignorance and poor attempt to correct it is a redflag. 

<<<
 The material I have read through seems to be a bit in the past.  I couldn't quite put a finger on when you spoke to them last.
<<<

I think you can do some basic searching on the wiki to piece it together. It's clear you haven't tried. 

<<<
  Also, your motivation behind asking me the question is not clear as well.
<<<

A curious claim. 

I overlooked your motivation for your above claim out of charity, but now I think your goal isn't to evaluate the facts - I think it's something else, instead. What is it that motivates you, [[ALM]]? By this time, you had 12 days since I asked for your help, and you are just now asking for this? I think you're looking for some way out of answering the question by attacking my motivation. Your suspicion is ironic; your move is deceptive.

Even a blind man should know I'm obsessed with [[The Moral Law]]. That is my motivation. Anyone who had been looking would have found the answer to this question, and it doesn't require digging deep. As you flat out admit, your goal is to avoid actually trying to reason about what I've written, who I am, and what I ought to do. You've been trying to weasel out of being my friend for years, and this line is no exception.

<<<
That is what I am afraid of.  I see something linked to but it is of quite a different subject.  You have certainly set quite a task in front of me.
<<<

Again, I shouldn't even have to ask. A good friend would have been talking with me about it for years.

Be honest, you are afraid of the fact that you are going to have to really empathize with me. That is no small task, of course, but someone who has known me for 20 years and clearly owes me a great deal should jump at the chance to repay his friend with empathy (rather than what you merely dream of). You didn't want to do this when I asked, and you should have had the integrity to just tell me you weren't going to try instead of lying to my face.

<<<
 Chat would be preferred for now as there is lots of stuff going on in the house now and my attention is being bounced around at present.
<<<

You know, I've actually set aside my time directly for you on numerous occasions, even on small matters. This was no small matter, and I could not have been clearer about it. I think you point to a distraction as a nudge to having an excuse for being too distracted to really try.

<<<
 Not making the expectations any lighter on me are ya?  But I am being silly when I should not.
<<<

I think that's what you really intended. I think 2 weeks later you realized I was asking for something more than a gloss over. You wanted out right here, but you didn't want to say it. That doesn't mean you don't have an obligation.

On to your advice, [[2018.10.10 - ALM: Advice]]:

<<<
I just wanted to let you know, based on what I have read on your wiki that I would recommend against reaching out to your donors.  I believe that was also the conclusion of others you have asked as well.
<<<

That was all you had to say, despite the fact that my request and explanation of the request was ~20x the length of your answer. Can you imagine answering a 1-page prompt with two sentences and acting like it was legitimately an answer? Clearly, you can. It was a non-answer and an attempt to just dodge the question.

I was explicit multiple times in my request that I wanted to know why. You clearly ignored it or hoped that I wouldn't ask. I think you just told me what you thought I wanted to hear to get it over with. You didn't actually care about fulfilling your obligation here. 

Note how "based on what I have read" (a line you use multiple times) is almost vacuously true. Watch: "Based on what I have read on //Ulysses// by James Joyce (a book I've never read), I would recommend X." It doesn't matter if I've really tried to read it or not. This seems like an answer from someone who legitimately has avoided trying to think with me about my life.

I asked you why, and you just ended the conversation. You had no intention of answering my "why," despite the fact that I said I'd be asking "why" more than once (and you know me: I tend to ask "why"). You didn't even pay enough attention to the request to realize that your answer was insufficient (let alone pay the attention necessary to actually answer it), unless, of course, you were just trying weasel out of responding, knowing full well you were being manipulative (ding, ding, ding).

So, I asked for "why" you give me this truly bland, bare minimalist advice, and you drop communications. Days later, I have to explicitly ask you again, and that also halts the conversation. You didn't want to answer "why" at all. Yeah, this is a redflag.

<<<
I have been having a hard time deciding why I chose what I chose.
<<<

I appreciate the non-cognitive aspects of virtue, but I don't think that's what is happening here (it requires actual habituation). Why should I trust your emotions when you've not put in the time to even train them in the matter? Oh, I think this is a hell of a lie.

If you have to ex post facto "decide" how to "decide" then you didn't have a justification or explanation in hand in the first place (which is what I asked for from the beginning). I asked you for a big favor, you took about a month, you didn't try, and now it's obvious. Clearly, you were avoiding it, and you had no intention of even trying to think about it with me. You were lying and avoiding your obligations to me. You attempt to confabulate your way into a false retroactive justification; you're gaslighting me.

I think your agenda here wasn't to empathize with me in generating your advice but rather to protect yourself from having to empathize with me in the first place.

<<<
 I am sorry for stringing you along like this.
<<<

It's fascinating that you use this phrase. You are correct: you are stringing me along. It's manipulative.

Why should I think you are sorry? Why should I think you aren't still stringing me along? I think you are sorry not towards me but for yourself because you got caught. It appears you were trying to tell me what I wanted to hear in order to quickly close out the question. 

<<<
After reading your wiki, and I know I did not get everything, but I got enough to feel confident in the choice I gave you.  
<<<

So, why do you think you got enough? It's clear that you are still missing chunks of the story, and you aren't in a position to be so confident. You maintain your confidence even while demonstrating you've not done your due diligence. 

Here's another redflag: besides your request for clarification, you didn't even ask any other questions while hyperreading this wiki. That's unbelievable. I think you should have been talking to me every day about this task. You seem confident for someone so ignorant, especially for someone who admits they can't effectively decide why they made that choice.

Here's what you are actually confident in: you didn't want to help your friend and you didn't want to be honest.

<<<
 I would see the following happening.  You and your donors would have a meeting and the tension would be so thick you could cut it with a knife.
<<<

Yikes. I told you this would be in writing. Your "justification" rests upon a false assumption that you would have known was false if you had been paying attention. This is your half-assed retroactive justification you made up in a tight spot after recognizing I wouldn't be dropping the issue of "why" you gave me that advice. You couldn't even spend those days in limbo trying to come up with a plausible lie! You really must think I'm stupid for being so charitable to you these many years.

Let me suggest a Straussian interpretation: you feel the tension in our conversation, and you don't want to be held accountable.

<<<
  Your children would easily pick up on this and this tension would only ruin the time that they did get to spend together.  Just being near each other would set you all on edge and would be a bad experience for all involved.
<<<

This might be the most reasoned aspect of your advice, but I'm not convinced it's actually something you've digested and justified. I think this is a platitude you've dropped.

So, why is this the overriding reason? Why is the "bad experience" the reason for why one ought not attempt to reconcile? Sometimes, you have to pay an uncomfortable price to do the right thing.

It's not like I've not considered meeting with my donors, but again, your answer completely misses what I've talked to you about. Trying to reconcile through open writing is clearly the method I consider fairest. You knew this, and you ignored it. Why should I take this to be good advice from a friend if you didn't even look at my request?

To be clear, I'm radically open with my children about what I think of my donors. If you are paying attention to the wiki or my words over the phone, you would know that. There's tension regardless of whether or not I'm standing in the room. The experience can be worsened, of course.

<<<
I read that you have instructed them to not proselytize.  That is the very thing thing that, being who they are, they cannot refrain from.
<<<

"Can" is a modal word. There many kinds of possibility. Why should I agree they "cannot" refrain from it? Moreover, are you implying they ought not? Besides [[MWF]]'s underhanded remarks to my children, this is actually a line they've done an okayish job not crossing while anyone else is standing in the room with them.

The "they can't help it" justification here is dangerous. Do you deny their moral agency? If not, then what do you mean by "cannot?" Surely I have the moral right to dictate whether or not someone is going to attempt to manipulate my children's minds. I do not teach your children Marxism (even though it is clearly correct) or discuss religion with them because I don't think I have the political or moral right. Do you think your mother has the right to proselytize her religion or lack-thereof to your children? So, why do you not apply similar reasoning in this case?

Again with my Straussian interpretation: you cling to the unspoken claim that you can't refrain from holding your position either. You are rationalizing. 

<<<
It is a clash of very strong wills and the real victims in that case would be your kids.
<<<

I think you've not taken even an hour to consider the possibility that my brothers and I are victims. Of course, that makes my children victims as well. How do you literally have nothing to say about this topic? I'm convinced you imply this is between two equal sides and that nothing is really at stake in the disagreement (or perhaps that I am wrong here, and then you need to pony up and show me). Why do you think this clash would really make my children the victims? If I'm right about who my donors are, then ultimately I do my children a great service to help them understand the truth. If I am able to reconcile with donors, even better!

I think you really don't want to consider the possibility I'm right here, but you don't have the balls to come out and say it, especially if it meant you'd have to defend your position. 

<<<
I am very much loathe to give the opinion that I did because I know that there is a connection between parents and their offspring and their offspring's offspring.  Not having this connection would be a loss.
<<<

I think you are loath to give your opinion because it demonstrates you haven't put much effort into generating it. I think you're avoiding actually thinking about my pain and situation with me, as I have previously demonstrated. Even from a Biblical perspective, you're failing.

Of course, my attempt to reconcile is an attempt to heal that connection. It's not like I'm walking away from this relationship without trying to find an answer. This wiki is an epic monument to how much I care about that relationship. I clearly care more about this connection than you do.

 However, proximity for you all would be like bringing a match in proximity to a powder keg.  Even if you were all silent and did not speak to each other besides simple, meaningless pleasantries just the look that one would give another in various situations would speak volumes.  It just wouldn't work.
<<<

You're right about this hypothetical. And, if you had been paying attention, you would know that is why I'm looking to resolve the problem through writing. Proximity is not the means. I already know that peace talks in person have failed. This is me attempting to defuse the powder keg.

You have many fine words here, but they don't address the matter at hand.

<<<
I also know that I am not a very good friend and I show that by the delay in getting this information back to you.  I have basically had to pry it from myself as I did not want to come back to the subject over and over again.
<<<

I think you show that not just in your "delays" (the nice way to couch it), but even in your attempt. I can tell you did not want to take a close look at it, and you shouldn't even remotely lie to me about having actually tried or about having sufficient evidence for being confident in your advice either. I appreciate your apparent honesty here, but I think you wield it as an excuse.

I expect people to not lie to me or themselves. If they know the truth, even when it is painful to either of us, they should tell me. If they don't know, then they should say that. In your case, not knowing requires more wrestling, studying, and thinking. I understand that you didn't want to pay the price, but that doesn't make it morally permissible.

<<<
Also, I have thought about conversations by phone and they would basically suffer the same way as nothing more than pleasantries that are meaningless could really be shared anyway.
<<<

Again, it's meant to be in writing, and you should know that. If you had been paying attention these many years, you'd know I have tried calling or videochatting with them. You thought about this at a surface level.

<<<
 The items in question would certainly be shorter and I would guess a bit more tolerable if conducted in this fashion - but it is not really a possibility to bond over just the telephone or other similar electronic forms of communication.
<<<

Writing is the only tool I'm going to use. Don't you see how it sometimes reveals the psychopaths I interact with? I directly told you that. 

<<<
 In being asked this question by you I have also had to think of my own relationship - or really lacker there of, with my own mother.  I really should reach out to her more.  Yet, this talk should be about your question and not my own.  Again, I would say that the reaching out would not be recommended.
<<<

I have discussed this with you, of course. I know. That's part of why I thought you'd have a chance of empathizing. Unlike you, I've actually tried, and you aren't paying attention. Still, even broken clocks may be correct twice a day, and your advice may still be accidentally correct even without merit.

<<<
The situation really makes me think of something a bit comical and silly.  It reminds me of WoW.  The unmovable object and the unstoppable force.  What would happen if they were to collide?  Your donors are of a mindset that by their very nature they cannot abide fully by the rules that you set down.
<<<

What rules do I set down? You clearly have no idea what they are.

Tell me something: are you open to the possibility they are radically wrong here? Obviously, you think I can be. Your advice requires you can answer that question and back it up. I don't think you do. I think you think this is some tiff that came out of nowhere. If you understood the pain I've experienced for many years now, you wouldn't even allude to it as comical or silly. 

<<<
in the case of writing, I would say that every syllable would have a different meaning behind it than the one originally portrayed and this would not be fooling wither party.
<<<

Redflag. This is another way of saying that words either don't have legitimate meaning or that we aren't honest. I think you mean to say we're dishonest. [[ALM]], do you think I'm dishonest with my words? How long have you known me? Have you looked at my writing? I aim to be precise, literal, and careful. I'm often told I'm too honest! I radically search for and tell the truth as best as I can. I am offended by your claim.

It's so ballsy to imply dishonesty in my writing. Stand your ground, sir. I think you are lying through your teeth in your writings to me, and it's not diplomacy or charitable interpretation, either. I think you purposely try not to find the meaning in my words.

It's one thing to say you predict writing will fail and another to say I ought not to engage in it. They are, of course, related, and it's your job to show me why. You choose both, and your reason is that writing isn't itself meaningfully honest. I can see that your writing demonstrates your dishonesty, lol. I can see why you think that.

Why do you think it wouldn't be meaningful to see people's lies in writing? Clearly, you don't want to get caught. I think you're straight up scared of what my writing has to say, and you'll do anything in your power to escape considering that I might be right. Yeah, you do have a moral obligation to listen to me, and I say that even while having asked for your advice.

<<<
From the correspondence that you have shared and analyzed from them what I have read there seems to be a great gulf between you and I do not think that it can be spanned.
<<<

I predict it won't be spanned, but that that doesn't mean both parties aren't morally obligated to try.

It clearly can be spanned if they were interested in reading and writing. I think you're attempting to unspokenly insist that no matter how hard I try, they can't be at fault. I think admitting such an asymmetry, however, calls you into question as a person, a son, and a friend. You see a gulf between us, too. I've built the bridge for you, too. It's clear you have no intention of even trying to cross the bridge. You know it will strip away parts of your identity, reveal that you aren't the hero of your own story, and demonstrate your evil to you.

<<<
When I think about it from their perspective - I get the sense that they cannot convince you to make the changes (in thinking and understanding the world) that they would like to see take place, reconciliation I see them calling it.
<<<

I get that sense too! Why do you think that is? There are at least three options:

# I'm wrong, they are right. 
# I'm right, and they are wrong.
# We are both wrong.

There is a truth to the matter here. At least one of us is objectively wrong (and that's including contextualist particularism). I appreciate that you look from both perspectives; it's necessary. I am willing to lay it out on the table. They are not, and clearly you aren't either. Why do you think that is?

I get the feeling you've spent more time thinking about it from their perspective than mine. Your choice of words - "reconciliation I see them calling it" - is a problem here. I see merit in the claim that they aren't going to try to objectively reconcile (which is not the same as one's subjective opinion about it), but I think one of the mistakes in your argument boils down to your failure to consider why they would fail to try to reconcile. What's especially egregious about it is your failure to understand the moral responsibility of listening to each other here. I think you damn yourself pretty clearly here too.

<<<
 I don't agree with quite a good bit of material that I have read from you but I know that I am not able to even dare to begin to try to dissect and to criticize in any effective way - so I avoid trying to do so.    I think that your parents would be in a much better position to take up that challenge, but as you say it would take an extreme amount of commitment and also good will that I do not believe is there at this time.
<<<

Why don't you dare? I think it's because you don't actually care about the truth. The truth is painful to you because you've spent so long avoiding it. This isn't simply about changing each other's minds; it's about doing it with a moral method (and I can see you have no intention of being moral about it here). I think neither of you are convinced you can defeat my argument with a moral method, and you are scared that you would lose in an honest, fair fight. I'm calling you out - indeed, I've earned the right to call you that after two decades of friendship.

Note, there is a difference between the claim that you can't change my mind with your argument and the claim that my mind ought to be changed by your argument. Don't conflate them. I change my mind with the best arguments I can find, even when they are extremely painful to me. Have you been paying attention? I'm certainly willing to be wrong, and that's exactly what gives the integrity, curiosity, and honesty to think I'm right. Can you say the same for yourself or my donors?

Do you really think I'm not open to changing my mind (which you could be implying here)? Of course, I think I'm closer to being right than the rest of you, and I think that while knowing how wrong I've been before (you know, because I've changed my mind). Do you think it's because I've spent a lot of time trying to find the truth, seeking universal justifications, etc.? Or do you think it's because I'm simply so hardheaded, arrogant, and foolish that I can't change my mind? I think you want the latter to be true; in fact, I think you desperately need it to be true. If I'm right, then you are profoundly wrong about damn near everything that matters in life. I don't think you can face me being right yet again (I've seen this before).

Going back to WoW as our shared reference, let me remind you that I was a worldclass duelist on multiple classes. Why not in philosophy (that thing I've studied far longer than WoW)? How many times did I have to correct you on how to play the game from a ludological standpoint? How about Everquest, D2, Tribes 2? I'm a metagamer of not just vidya games, but the game of life. Are you sure you're still right? I really go out of my way not to rub this in your face; I aim not to shame you about the fact that I'm more intelligent (which isn't to say I'm always right, nor that I don't need help). I go out of my way to show you my respect. My asking for your advice here was a signal of how much I respect your opinion when you choose to develop it (which you didn't in this case). So, why is your criticism ineffective? Is it due to a flaw in my character, yours, or both? I think you avoid it because you can't bear the thought that you're wrong.

You are correct in claiming my donors are in a better position than you. While they live and breathe, it seems like they do owe an extreme commitment to their creations. Why would this not be true? I do aim to be a fair judge of my parents, especially since I hope to show my own children what fairness in judging me will look like. 

So, you say you think they lack good will here. That is a very technical word for a Kantian like me. I don't think you mean what I do by it, but that's okay (for now). Are you claiming they have failed their moral obligations? The rest of your argument does not seem to suggest so.

Ultimately, I think people who consistently hold on to falsehoods, confabulate, and selfishly lie to maintain their identities are psychopaths. I expect them to slay the parts of their identities which are evil (to repent). They have no moral right to be evil, and they are obligated to change themselves, to wrestle with those who simply know better. Yes, we are all obligated to wrestle, even to extremity in many of our relationships. I think you treat me like a blackbox and you have no intention of trying to understand me. 

<<<
>Do you have a right to disagree with someone that you won't wrestle with?

To answer the second question first, I would say that a person does have the right to disagree with someone that they will not bother to wrestle with.  They get to choose the hill that they are to die on.  They would not be unwilling to do the wrestling but I would think that no matter of wrestling that they would do would enable them to actually be able to claim any sort of victory that they would define.
<<<

That question is posed for both you and my donors. To be clear, I think I can point to examples where one has the moral right to disagree without wrestling, but it turns out you'll need ample justification, which doesn't appear available to either of you here.

Counterexample time: 

Say Agent P (e.g. Terrence Howard) believes "1x1=2." Agent Q disagrees and is willing to explain to P why that's wrong. Let us say P will not bother to wrestle with Q on the matter. Does agent P have the moral (or even epistemic) right to believe 1x1=2? That's stupid, right? Surely P is not morally justified in almost all contexts. How we reason and wrestle with each other and ourselves is a matter of morality. I suggest that simple math is even less worthy of wrestling than the ethics we're dealing with now. You don't have the moral right to disagree about what matters most if you won't defend it; this is actually an extension of the second greatest commandment.

Your argument seems like "You believe what you believe, and I'll believe what I believe" without any discussion of exceptions, appropriateness, or justification. That is moral relativism in action as well. 

I think you want to say this simply to cover your butt here, to make it so that you can act like you have some right to disagree without any justification or wrestling. Oh, I grant you have the political right to do so, but I'm only interested in the moral right here. 

So I agree they have the ability to do the wrong thing, to choose the wrong hills to die on. The power to do so, however, is not the moral right to exercise it. Furthermore, that they are not willing doesn't mean they aren't obligated to be willing. Their ability to claim victory as they prefer to define it is not conceptually relevant to whether or not they are morally obligated to engage. 

<<<
Would you blame them to be scared?  I have felt that same fear.  I know that whatever I say or do I have never been able to change your mind on something once it has been made up.  I always held in the back of my mind the notion that one day I would change your mind and it would be of great consequence - it seems like that dream is not ever to come to pass.  I don't even know if dream is even the right word.  It has only been a thought that I have had in the past.  it would be the way that i would repay you for all the good that you have done me.  where this idea came from I don't quite know.  Why I tell you about it know, I also do not know.
<<<

Do you have any clue how scared I've been in my search in the desert? Clearly, you have not even begun to empathize with me.

Being scared is no excuse for not doing the right thing, especially about what matters most and regarding our highest obligations. I say this as a failure myself. I don't blame them for being scared, but I blame them for not having the integrity to honestly face me in the open and be ready to be wrong all the way down (I certainly have on their behalf). Again, why do you think they are scared? If they really are so convinced they are correct, then there doesn't seem to be a viable reason to fear explaining why they are correct, and the same with you.

Why do you think you've never changed my mind? I'm not convinced it's true that you've not changed my mind, btw. I think you change it, though rarely intentionally, and it appears not in a satisfying way to you. Do you think I make up my mind for reasons similar to yours? Do you think that I feel always certain rather than degrees of confidence? I do put my tent-pegs down (often with great doubt), and I do stake my identity and reputation on specific claims in the desert. Do you think I do so without enormous justification?

When I look at who you are, [[ALM]], and I know you better than any person alive, including your wife (and she also admits that fact), I think it is you who choose not to change your mind once you've made it up (bordering on the unforgivable sin). It is clear that on some matters, no matter what I say, however rational it may be, you resist with stubborn arrogance. Look at me: have I not changed my mind over the years? I remember having this exact discussion with you sitting on the back porch in Metairie.

I get that you relish proving me wrong. A lot of people take joy in it. I assume that is a token of respect in some weird way. Do you think you need me to be wrong so badly that you blind yourself here?

If you want to repay me, then actually read my wiki and think with me. This was your chance to actually repay me. No, you won't understand me as well as I do, what you intend to change won't always be the thing that actually changes because of your efforts, and I will still think you are radically wrong often. It turns out, you can repay me by coming to understand me as best you can, which you have clearly not tried terribly hard to do.

Here's a fact for you: people don't own themselves all the way down. That's fundamental to what Jesus is telling you the entire time in the NT. To say you are morally obligated to serve others is to say they own you to that [[dok]] (honest Libertarians openly agree). The memetic dialectic is no different. The fear of being wrong is not a moral justification for not wrestling with me. If you aren't willing to be wrong, then you have no moral right to claim you even have the truth or justification, not even for yourself.

<<<
What would you say that your goal in such encounters would be?
<<<

Again, you go to question my motives. How do you like it when I turn the tables? I have way more right to question yours, too. I have answered your question multiple times over the month and in the wiki.

<<<
What would that look like?
<<<

I think you are fishing for an out here. 

<<<
Currently, I would wager that both parties cannot even agree what all of those items are.  Am I wrong?
<<<

I'd wager that those who vehemently disagree cannot [[FO]] agree on their disagreement. Don't you see vacuity of your question? This is a question meant to justify misdirection. [[SO]] agreement on disagreement seems very plausible, like: I want whatever is morally correct to obtain in the world.

I suggest you have mistaken the claim that both parties can't get what they want for objective reconciliation. They are not identical.

<<<
May I be so bold as to ask why?
<<<

Oh, you should easily have known my thoughts from having thought about my wiki. I suggest that you don't think they lack integrity at all, and now you question mine. Come out and say it. 

<<<
I would be the first to admit that there is very likely material that I did not read that you have written on this.  What I did read did not lead me to believe that they were not interested.
<<<

Examples, please?

As I said to you: they have known about my wiki for 2 years, [[ALM]]. They have had ample opportunity.

I think you are being logically inconsistent yet again. You agree they are scared enough not to do so. Do you really think they are interested? Explain.

<<<
Do you think that they have written you off?
<<<

Seems like it. There is a possibility they could do otherwise though. I do think they have the freewill to do the right thing. I don't think they are 100% psychopathic at all, not even towards their enemies!

<<<
To be honest, she is more than welcome to do that.  You and I both know it would be wrong.  This is a bit different as those whom my mother would speak to in that way mean nothing to me.  Perhaps that is the more damning of the two.
<<<

That was slick evasion. Note "to be honest" is a signal that you are trying to lie. So, "would be wrong" in what sense? Do you simply mean it wouldn't be true? I think that's what you mean. I'm talking about whether or not it is morally wrong to lie about someone. You aren't even attempting to consider the implications here. I think you are defending them in order to irrationally defend yourself. 

<<<
I would argue that the sitaution you are in has many more consequences
<<<

Agreed! I wish you spent more time actually writing up an answer about it.

<<<
I am curious, what do you mean by evidence?

Evidence in your defense?
<<<

It's like you didn't even pay attention to our chats, let alone the wiki. I've already said this to you.

<<<
By some miracle, if all involved parties in your family read every last keyboard press of your wiki, do you think that they would believe that of the two parties that you would have the more defensible position as to why such an such was done at such time in your life?  Or, would reading all of it convince others but not them?
<<<

I think you are implying that I expect everyone involved to read every word. Now, I agree a handful of people should, but the vast majority of people who read this have no obligations to do so, including most of my family and friends. This is unfortunate considering how I even told you outright to hyperread me and taught you how to search. I explicitly told you that no such miracle would be required of you, and I didn't hold my breath for it either.

It's clear to me from your inferences, lack of supporting arguments for your conclusions, and mistakes in recognizing things flatly said to you in chat that you haven't even tried. This "every last keyboard press" rhetorical phrase is an attempt to act like it is some insane thing I've asked of you. No, I do expect my friends to try to hyperread me.

Whether or not people believe me is a separate claim from whether or not I should attempt to speak the truth. Again, you do not leave enough space between description and prescription, or at least you imply it.

<<<
I would also not argue with that.  It is a fact.  I have poked around here and there.  What I have seen has scared me.  Thar be dragons yo!
<<<

Yeah, poked around is the phrase. Does that mean you know what it is, what it says, what it means? Do you think "poking around" is enough to justify your advice? Do you think you met your obligation here? Surely not. 

Why did you it scare you? Furthermore, even if you were scared, what gives you the right, as my friend, not to pay attention, to understand it, and to feel it with me? There are some odd things, no doubt. But, you've known me for a very long time. You know I just come out and say it. Oh, do I face the things which make you curl up inside? They are certainly painful to me. I think you are responsible for your lack of trying to be my friend.

<<<
>(1) What changes do you think they would like to see take place?

1) I am not for certain what they would like to see take place.  I can imagine a few items but they seem far from the here and now.
<<<

It's odd that you question me on this (as though it were a major argument against me), but offer no counter thoughts here. I think you should have provided material here. Offering your own opinions about what ideally and practically should take place was your job too! 

<<<
>(2) Do parents not have that obligation/commitment to their children?

2) I need some more explanation on this obligation
<<<

You aren't paying attention at all. You're purposely trying to be obtuse here. You aim to deny they are morally obligated (I think to save your own hide), and you have no defense.

<<<
You certainly have not fallen short in trying to explain your point of view.  That does not mean that they like or agree with your point of view or methods and reasonings behind it.
<<<

Your mistake appears to be very early in our conversation where you continue to imply they aren't obligated to listen or wrestle and be open to the possibility they are wrong. You've got some nerve to not even hear my claim and then act like you have a justified opinion on the matter. And you continue to conflate description and prescription, a sleight of hand that can enable anything. "That's the way it is, so stop trying to do anything about it."

I know they don't agree or like my point of view (known from the beginning, right?); that's going to happen when I accuse them of being evil.

Look, if they wanted to leave our lives forever, that would be one thing (though I still deny their moral right to; but I would let them go). However, they continue to intrude on our lives, and that does make it my business. 

<<<
I will say for sure that i never had a good conversation that involved the words is, ought, and obligation.  This talk of obligations comes off to me as an excuse for something. 
<<<

Particularly not with me, right? I hear you say that I'm playing a game of semantics here, as though these are mere words. Do you want to see subtext that smacks of excuse? //Have you read your own words?// I think your talk of "this talk of obligations" comes off as an excuse for you to rationalize your selfishness.

<<<
 This could just be another area where I disagree with you. I don't see where they have an obligation to hear you out when it is all that they have heard before and where you also do not have the obligation to not bring it up since they are your parents.
<<<

See, they haven't heard it before. And you wouldn't know whether they have or haven't. You don't get to help yourself to that claim, and that means you are making this up. You are writing an excuse here! You don't see the obligation, but that doesn't mean it's not there. It's clear that you desperately want it not to be there, especially since it seems tied to your far lesser obligations. 

From what I tell, you are trying to dismiss my argument as something //you've// heard before. That is laughable; you certainly haven't, as evidenced in our current conversation. I'm not pointlessly dancing or flooding you with nonsense. I'm deconstructing your bullshit, and I've got something constructive to put in its place that you can't answer.

You deny the obligation because you know it's gonna cost you dearly to be a good person.

<<<
  I am very unwilling to admit to many obligations at all - even between parent and offspring.
<<<

Ah, well, it's time for you to put up or shut up. I think you conveniently whip out this claim whenever it suits you. It's a confabulation. Even from a Biblical perspective (and you are no match for me or my wife [who outranks both of us on this topic]), you are obviously wrong. Your unwillingness is not a sign of intellectual or moral integrity; it's quite the opposite. You're a hypocrite (oh, indeed, I have the right to wield ad hominen here).

<<<
 You are grown now and they might see you as a failure for them as it comes back to make them look bad in the eyes of their flock.  
<<<

I agree to that (and you should already know that); I've said it far more clearly than you have too. Of course, this description does not give them the moral prescription to not listen to me. Note how I have kindly not touched their flock. They need not look bad in front of their flock of sheep (though they clearly are on pre-emptive offense here), the social capital they graze upon, because I haven't gone anywhere near it. Reconciliation doesn't require endangering their flocks. I've been explicit about the fact that I aim to leave them alone if they will leave us alone too. You ignore this entirely. You really haven't paid attention to what I've said. 

Your argument is bad.

<<<
 I think that you believe that you have an obligation to the truth as you reason it. Their mental calculus for truth is perhaps based on other mathematical systems.  Perhaps similar differences of understand underly the differences between you.
<<<

Here's the clincher. You have resorted to what appears to be moral relativism. That's the last refuge of the incompetent. That's you willing to say this: "I'd rather claim there's no such thing as a right answer than accept that you might be right." 

Also, you ignore 4 of my questions that follow from your claim here. That is a redflag, and clearly, you just want to exit the conversation.

<<<
I do not follow what you mean by description but not prescription
<<<

Google-able, it's in my wiki, and I've talked about it before with you.

<<<
I guess that you could say that I am trying to avoid as much of a conversation on that topic as I can.
<<<

You see, advice is prescriptive. It's a moral question (even as hypothetical imperatives). You don't get to avoid that conversation when you give it. You either accept that there are moral truths that you can defend, or don't get to help yourself to them. It's pretty clear that you are morally obligated to think about morality as morally as you can; you should listen to an expert (which doesn't mean I know everything or that I can't be wrong).

I can see you don't want to talk about it, and that's probably because you are radically wrong. Getting closer to the truth is going to require climbing a mountain that you don't want to accept is there. You've stuck your head in the sand, and you do so out of selfish convenience. 

<<<
  Perhaps, like [[MWF]] and [[SLT]], I do not know how to win any sort of argument on that ground with you. 
<<<

So, what is winning an argument? If someone shows you that your argument sucks (and you can see it), and they show you an argument you can't defeat, then what right do you have to deny their argument? 

That you can't win the argument doesn't make you right, and doesn't give you a moral right to hold your position. It's like arguing with a sexist or a racist who can clearly be shown their position is immoral in such a way that they can't win (especially if they take the Bible to be the Word of God): the fact that they can't win the argument (even on their own grounds) doesn't give them the right to not listen, or change their minds, or repent, or admit/fix their mistakes.

<<<
You asked me what obligation that you have to them. I would say that you have the obligation to tell them the truth and no more.  They have no obligation to accept that truth that you give them.
<<<

Why do you think these are the obligations?

What does it mean to tell them? Does that mean they have to "hear" what I say for me to have told them? It seems like it. It seems to me you have sidestepped the question of whether or not they should listen to me. That seems incredibly useful to you.

Do you really mean that I've given them the truth? If so, then why would they have no have obligation to accept it?

Let me take your principle to the Nth degree. When I tell a Nazi not to kill some innocent person, and I give the correct argument which explains why murder is wrong (i.e., the truth), why are they not obligated to accept it and act upon it? I don't think you can mean what you've said without being inconsistent.

I think you wish to deny that I have a justified argument or the truth entirely. Now that is going to take a real argument from you. 

<<<
You are a friend.  But, I am a poor friend for you perhaps
<<<

Without a doubt. You aren't just a bad friend, you are a bad person. I have been willing to make an allowance for the latter.

<<<
I am going to say goodnight for now.  I hope that this conversation has been useful in some way for you.  I have done a poor job of what you asked me to do.  Forgive me.
<<<

It has been useful. You know, I asked for the advice you were willing to give, and you gave it. I can see you aren't much of a friend, plain as day in my records. At the very least, it has crushed my hope for our relationship. It needed doing.

I've come to a decision about you. You have failed my [[T42T]] [[Wiki Litmus Test]] for the last time. I told you what I was doing, flat out. I'm sorry to see what it has become. I desperately hoped you would actually try; I know I have. I forgive you enough to leave you room to start the process of rebuilding our friendship when you demonstrate you have the moral integrity to do so, just like my donors. The bridge is there for you, and you're welcome.
