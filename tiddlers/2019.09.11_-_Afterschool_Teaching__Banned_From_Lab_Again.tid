title: 2019.09.11 - Afterschool Teaching: Banned From Lab Again

Food came in. It's not nearly as much as I predicted. Delp was even late a week with it. I know he has the money for it too. No frozen foods either. 

Delp walks in with a shaking voice (a nervous kind of anger and command) to tell us we are banned from the computer lab, and if another child uses the lab incorrectly according to school policy, the program leader will be written up (which, of course, is me, since I'm the only person who wants to take them to the lab). My students later told me that Dorsey has been blaming others for his computer problems; Delp also ended up saying it.

We were told to stick to the food schedule since Sonya was showing up (sounds like he's wrangling his adult children). She didn't. Pretty sure Delp is still just unjustifiably manipulating again. We are tasked with the impossible yet again since the food which came in doesn't meet the requirements of the schedule. He's not even trying.

Delp pulled me aside again to make sure I understood. He can be as angry as he wants about it. I have no intention of censoring and limiting access to information for my children. It does them no good for me to speak truth to power here. I think we are now starting the downward spiral. I may be losing or leaving this job soon. 

One-on-one's were fine. Repeats of the same conversations for the most part, but there were a few interested in speaking with the crazy old man. 6KA and 6BG took turns trying to make a facetious show of daring each other to compliment and hug me. Gotta be weird to have a male in your life asking how you are doing and saying they care about you, I realize.

I have the worst behaving students again. I am grateful, however, that Matt eventually came to take a few for a bit. 

6KM is also fairly psychopathic. I'm surprised she continues to try playing her game with me again and again. She's going to be a dangerous woman.

Today's been a rough day. My head hurts. 

I think the program is used to punish students with bad grades. It's not that they need tutoring to complete that work (though every child here needs tutoring), but motivation is often the issue (my broken children, of course, are somehow still standing). They can very easily not have any homework at all if they choose to complete it in class. If they want don't want to stay after school, then they have to start performing. 

I had lots of dialectics with students. I had a dozen students over the course of the day speak with me about the lab, the evil of the ban, censorship, the power structures of the school, the Tragedy of the Commons, what it means to engage in conversation, and the vaue of reading. 

I had several students tell me they were only given 5 minutes for lunch and were hungry. We went and grabbed some extra food.

8L said everyone was fake. And, we started thinking about what that meant and how not to be part of the problem. Whitney was happy to be there for that. 7G and I were talking about censorship, and that's where it started getting ugly for Whitney (who is profoundly addicted to approval seeking the conservative ingroup here).

Whitney and I briefly started a conversation, and she was very surprised to find that I was disappointed in the school enough to not want to send my offspring here (which is weird, since that should be fairly obvious). She has watched me engage in dialectics with some of the students, and she's glad to see it occur. But, when it is her turn, she flees. I asked her to tell me what "bad content" was and why, and just as importantly, to explain how we can collectively define and regulate it. I think she saw of a flash of the reasoning behind my method and motivation with her as I spoke with 8If about arrogance (which was a hilarious, ironic, and hypocritical discussion). It's clear the triangle continues as my words continue back to Delp.

7G and I talked about her situation. She's from Flint, MI. We talked about making sure she is checked for lead poisoning. She had some gutwrenching stories to tell me. That girl has been through hell and back. I have no idea how she is so optimistic, but I'm amazed. My stomach is turning inside and out listening to her. She is the reason her siblings are alive. She is barely holding it together herself. We talked about astrology, and I am a disappointing man to speak with on the subject. She is very self-aware, and her speech impediment is painful to her. She reads and writes a lot. Her last essay made her mother cry. I can see why. =(

5AN talked about a lot things. She is observant in her conversation. She also knows she is a teacher's pet and has no interest in it. It was nice to know I'm not alone in my assessment of several of her age-peers (though I did not comment).

We had a meeting at the end couched as a group effort, but it was actually a peer pressure session. I handed Delp everything I could without directly lying (though when push comes to shove, I'm morally obligated to do so for my children). He has no intention of attempting to enable my children to use those computers. He puts down zero social capital on it. We're only having this discussion because of Dorsey's anger (which also was a misdirection; the man is hunting for someone to blame). I really hate the deathgrip they have on my children.
