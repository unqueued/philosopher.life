title: 2018.12.20 - Prompted Introspection: Restaurant Dream

!! If I could run out to any restaurant right now with more than enough money where would I go?

Lady Melisandre, you are always far too generous to me. As usual, I take it that I do not have to hand you an individual constant as a name, but instead may offer a function which resolves to an object in our domain (even if I don't actually know the name of it). Clearly, I ask you take me to the restaurant on which path spending that sufficient money supply maximizes the global utility of the world through an application of the maximin principle; i.e. allow me to traverse that path which enables [[The Original Position]] and decentralizes power [[irwartfrr]].
