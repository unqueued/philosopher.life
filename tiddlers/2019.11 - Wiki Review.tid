!! Audit:

* [[Sho]] seems to be coming out more.
* [[FTO]] continues to be exceptionally expensive, and I'm still glad to pay the price.
** Relationships continue to be integral to what I'm doing here.
* Apparently, h4x0r hasn't found it. That is curious.
** Wants to VC. Hrm. 
** Reverse image search is my guess. Dead-ends though. 
*** Good, she's listening.
** I hope she continues to befriend him. They seem to get along well. He doesn't seem to mind the age gap either, which is cool.
* There are a ton of memes from my offspring in here.
* It's been a month of heavy transitions.
** It's going to continue to be that way for a while too.
** Get whatever sleep you can. It's wonderful that your wife and offspring are sleeping decently. 
* Never did hear back from anon.
* I've enjoyed having a section of my time allotted to just using Reddit litruhly for funsies again. 
* Everything not saved will be lost, of course.
* I need to ask [[AA]] if she tracked him down. She still has some connections on the board.
* Lots of thinking about [[Prompted Introspection]] questions. I have quite a while to before I can narrow them down.
* My [[title.Title]]s are coming from everything.
* I like when there are threads that last for days.
** It's weak, but perhaps it can grow into something useful. 
* I'm enjoying that I don't have to lead the current discussion. I'm the annoying husk of a student again. Lol.
** Cool to see it come alive. 
* [[FTO]] continues to take over this log. It's crucial.
** I think I need to do grafting AFTER [[Monthly Audit]]s. 
*** Jesus, the [[Yearly Audit]] is its own beast. I don't have fucking time for it time. There's a two week window for insanity coming up.
