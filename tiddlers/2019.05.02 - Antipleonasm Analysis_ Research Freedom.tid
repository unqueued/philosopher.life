!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Nothing should be done to impede people from teaching and doing their research even if at that very moment it was being used to massacre and destroy. [...] the radical students and I wanted to keep the labs on campus, on the principle that what is going to be going on anyway ought to be open and above board, so that people would know what is happening and act accordingly.

Some people take peer review of academia to be a version of [[TOP]], particularly in its reflective equilibrium dialectics. What counts as being worthy of funding, logistics, and of the limited time of peers and senior academics? There is a market in academia (several colliding markets, actually). I tend to side heavily with freespeech and exploration. It depends on the subject. This is a place where the sciences tend to have an advantage (speaking of yesterday's entry).

Radicality rarely goes unpunished unless your supervisors, peers, and investors find it useful to them. I wouldn't call much of the work I see in academia "above board" though. 

I assume the "nothing should be done" is in terms of political regulation. Obviously, we have moral obligations which are more restrictive, and I'm fine with talking shit about where we should be {[[focus]]}ing. That is political, and it's a kind of regulation. This is a hard problem to solve.

When in doubt, I aim to distribute and decentralize the means of authority, including memetic exploration.
