title: 2019.06.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Gradual

* Woke at 6:30
** Hrm. I think I'm going to be tired later today. 5 hours of half-brained sleep is no bueno.
* Woke up today my [[m10]] redlined and out of memory. I was already creeping up on +28GB last night. I'm not sure what threw it over. 
* Cleaned my phone, setup new voicemail options (foisted upon me ;P)
* The offspring and I spent hours talking about ML and game theory, especially [[Gradual]]. We made slow improvements throughout the day.
** Perhaps will visit some economists.
* Delirious: took nap
** Found my eye-mask/cover
* Read+Write
* We threw the frisbee around for a while. It was a hot and fun. The fatman can sprint for the frisbee.
** The offspring had a great deal of fun. =)
* My wife applied to work at Yale Divinity. Neat.
* Pizza!
* BB
** It's wonderful to see my offspring's reactions. This story has clicked with them. I'm grateful.
* Brainstorming on [[Gradual]]
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Tried falling asleep by 2, probably didn't sleep until 3
