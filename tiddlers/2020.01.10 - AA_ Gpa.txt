I would love all the snow! ⛄️ ❄️
Jan 10 11:08am
Sitting with Gpa in the ER
Jan 10 11:08am
He keeps passing out — nothing life threatening
Jan 10 11:08am
Yikes.
Jan 10 1:35pm
Makes my day interesting anyway
Jan 10 1:35pm
No doubt.
Jan 10 1:35pm
He still passing out?
Jan 10 1:35pm
He can’t stand without being dizzy
Jan 10 1:35pm
They just did a cat scan of his head
Jan 10 1:36pm
Better than passing out, but still not good, I take it.
Jan 10 1:36pm
I will be surprised if they don’t keep him overnight
Jan 10 1:36pm
Aye.
Jan 10 1:36pm
When does your pod arrive?
Jan 10 1:37pm
We got 'em and emptied them. Company isn't so good with following their own schedules. They were supposed to come pick them up today, but will be Monday (which is fine). Currently, we have a garage filled with things to put into place.
Jan 10 1:39pm
Glad you got your stuff!
Jan 10 1:39pm
Heck yeah!
Jan 10 1:39pm
Kids like the new place?
Jan 10 1:39pm
One of [[k0sh3k]]'s coworkers said it took her 3 months to get her stuff (which seemed awful, lol)
Jan 10 1:40pm
Yeah, they each have their own room now, which is cool. First for them.
Jan 10 1:40pm
Oh no —that would be bad
Jan 10 1:40pm
Own room is very nice!
Jan 10 1:40pm
Weird sending them out into city traffic to go to Aldi and Goodwill. Gotta get them used to going out there.
Jan 10 1:41pm
It's a longer commute for [[k0sh3k]] than we anticipated.
Jan 10 1:41pm
Glad to have a home.
Jan 10 1:41pm
I bet!
Jan 10 1:42pm
How are [[AG]] and [[UJ]] doing?
Jan 10 1:44pm
And, have you started up your new grad school class?
Jan 10 1:45pm
They are pretty good —[[AG]] is probably wigging out over Gpa
Jan 10 1:45pm
New classes started Monday and both are threatening group work...
Jan 10 1:46pm
Lawdy.
Jan 10 1:46pm
Who are these people who like groupwork?
Jan 10 1:47pm
Blarg—online group work sounds torcherous
Jan 10 1:47pm
no doubt
Jan 10 1:47pm
No idea —I volunteer to be a group of 1 but I don’t see that happening
Jan 10 1:47pm
Still with Gpa at the hospital... They think that one of his medicines has given him an ulcer. They may scope to confirm/fix it.  The dr will either be in tonight or tomorrow to confirm
Jan 11 5:24pm
=(
Jan 11 10:32pm
They are going to do the scope (down his throat) on Monday —the Dr thinks it may just be a lesion
Jan 11 10:34pm
But regardless they will fix it while scoping
Jan 11 10:34pm
Ah. Sounds painful.
Jan 11 10:35pm
Enough to black out aint good.
Jan 11 10:35pm
Yeah but they stopped the meds that were causing it —think he will be back to health after the cauterize the bleeders
Jan 11 10:36pm
He is already doing better though
Jan 11 10:37pm
He staying at the hospital or heading back home until Monday?
Jan 11 10:38pm
Staying at least through Monday...hopefully he will be home later on Monday or Tuesday
Jan 11 10:39pm
How’s it going?
Jan 18 6:02pm
Still feeling pretty sick, but it was my first day that I felt up to real tasks.
Jan 18 7:25pm
Snowed, so that's cool.
Jan 18 7:25pm
How about you?
Jan 18 7:25pm
Jealous of your snow but not your sickness
