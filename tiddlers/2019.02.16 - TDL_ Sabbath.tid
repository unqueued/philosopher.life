* Okay, so I didn't get taxes done. Maybe tomorrow or Monday.
* I'm hoping that my wife will be interested in just inviting randos and people who could use a meal on Sundays.
* Read+Write
* Family Time!
* Inform the Men!
** We waited too late today. The date was wonderful. The walk was awesome. The food was good. The day was productive.
