I've realized that I don't like people who are not open to the possibility that they are bad persons. Anyone who cannot be honest with themselves in this way definitely cannot be trusted. Someone who can recognize that they are or have been a piece of shit, who can express regret, who see outside their self-interest for half a second, I can accept them. I have no mercy for those who are unwilling to take responsibility for themselves. Much like mercy granted by the Lord your God, you aren't forgivable until you ask for it.
