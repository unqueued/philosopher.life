title: 2019.08.29 - Prompted Introspection: Journey

!! What is your favorite journey?

LSD. I've traveled in many respects, but that is the best journey I've taken. My first ketamine experience was the most important I've ever had though. The night and day [[phenomenological]] shift out of depression within hours taught me what only experience can teach me about not trusting my perceptions. I can't say it was pleasurable, but I'm glad I did it (and I'm glad I've continued when necessary).
