Loved your silly booger picking piece
FRI 11:43 AM
It's great to be a kid.
FRI 11:45 AM
Yep!
FRI 11:46 AM
My students were drawing penises on the whiteboard yesterday. If only they knew that's how I begin every chalktalk lecture with my own offspring. Have to have the right amount of absurdity mixed in with the seriousness.

Oh, one of my kids is taking home the official state test to complete. No proctor, no witness, nothing.
FRI 11:47 AM
Fascinating.
FRI 11:47 AM
Interesting...

And weird

Maybe it's a practice test (though that's not what it says, and the forms all look real to me).
FRI 11:48 AM
They are testing from until the end of the month.

I got a “violation” at John because I let a trustworthy student carry my completed stuff to the office

Lol.
FRI 11:50 AM
It's ridiculous.

Is testing any better in a private school?

Yeah we do the “Iowa” test which is a better test than Kentucky came up with as a state
FRI 11:52 AM
Noice.
FRI 11:53 AM
But...not as good as like an ACT
