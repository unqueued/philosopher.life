*** Herein lies the problem with redpilledness; sometimes it really is just delusion. We are all biased to the point of delusion about the world; it is a post-modern problematic. Assume objective reality exists (not here to argue about it). How do you know the difference between delusions that actually generate more accurate representations of reality than your current ones and those that do not? This is very tricky, even for someone with a background in epistemology.

*** The "sense of familiarity" is an outstanding phrase here. I also want to point out that it is difficult to know what counts as "damage" in a sense. Consider a racist, conditioned strongly to be one. They'd be killing off large sections of how they understood the world to remove that racism. They would be "damaging" their identities to do so. There would probably even be physiological changes that we might point to and call "damage." But, is that a bad thing? Bad for whom? Bad for that identity? Yes. Bad for us? No. Perhaps the hardware and much of the software that make up that homo sapien specimen will ultimately be happier because of it. Ship of Thesus and Parfit are crying out to you. Damage as maladaption for whom? Who are we damaging when we damage the racist? Is this acceptable? It seems like it. What are you going to do, Kant, eh?
*** Gorgeous link between Capgras delusions and prosopagnosia, yes.

*** Stop this madness! We desperately need educated citizens. The problem is a culture (reinforced by those in power) that doesn't value seeking the truth. It's that simple. you say several things that are correct, but you drastically miss the point.
