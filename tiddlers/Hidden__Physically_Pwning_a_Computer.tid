title: Hidden: Physically Pwning a Computer

Generally speaking, having physical access to a computer is thought to trivialize the hacking encounter. I'm not a great hacker though. Some methods are better than others as well. Further, there is a difference between having just a few seconds of access and having weeks of unadulterated physical access. 

I think Hacksaws/Switchblades, High-voltage discharging USBs, etc. are very interesting tools. They may be going the way of the dodo bird, but still are very special tools. I should catalog these. 

Every administrator has toolbox. I should consider developing my toolbox again. You never know when it might come in handy. At the very least, experience is useful. This is an area that could be quite useful to [[j3d1h]] to understand as well.
