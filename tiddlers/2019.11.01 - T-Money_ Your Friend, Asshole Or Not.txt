Halloween go well?
Nov 1, 2019 1:51pm
It did. Until I had a few too many drinks got in an argument with wife and slept in the guest room.
Nov 1, 2019 1:51pm
Haha
Nov 1, 2019 1:51pm
We are fine. Just normal husband wife stuff.
Nov 1, 2019 1:52pm
How was yalls? Trick or treating was very cold.
Nov 1, 2019 1:52pm
Lol, I hear that.
Nov 1, 2019 1:56pm
I sleep on the couch a lot. My snoring is really bad, to the point she can't sleep with it very easily.
Nov 1, 2019 1:57pm
Not a lot of trick or treating in our area. Most people seem to do the Trunk or Treat thing.
Nov 1, 2019 1:57pm
Kids had a good time.
Nov 1, 2019 1:57pm
My wife gives out pencils, activity booklets, and books. Poor things.
Nov 1, 2019 1:58pm
It was a good Halloween.
Nov 1, 2019 1:58pm
What you up this weekend?
Nov 1, 2019 1:58pm
up to*
Nov 1, 2019 1:58pm
Trying to get a referral for a sleep apnea test.
Nov 1, 2019 2:02pm
Yeah, that might help. Some people say life is wildly better with those machines.
Nov 1, 2019 2:10pm
I am hoping for that. I can't keep falling asleep on the way to work.
Nov 1, 2019 2:16pm
It was not always this way. Waking up gasping for air.
Nov 1, 2019 2:17pm
Oh, man, I hate that feeling.
Nov 1, 2019 2:17pm
I have to sleep on my shoulders/side (not great, given my weight) in the recovery position to minimize that gasping effect.
Nov 1, 2019 2:18pm
If you can't make it to the doc.
Nov 1, 2019 2:22pm
Hoping Yale's healthcare will be better.
Nov 1, 2019 2:23pm
I appreciate you thinking about my health too.,
Nov 1, 2019 2:23pm
Your my friend. Asshole or not. Lmao
Nov 1, 2019 2:25pm
Second night of arguments. Willing here!
Nov 2, 2019 2:19am
Painful to love her all the way down. Sucks. =(
Nov 3, 2019 11:55am
I hope your weekend has some positives to help.
Nov 3, 2019 11:57am
It did. Thank you for your concern. Wife is in the beginning stages of menopause. Acoording to doctor. We have already started hormone therapy.
Nov 3, 2019 12:55pm
I expect many more arguments about nonsense.
Nov 3, 2019 12:55pm
I have been asking my wife the same. 
Nov 3, 2019 12:55pm
We both have older wives. It's gonna happen.
Nov 3, 2019 12:55pm
What made your week positive? 
Nov 3, 2019 12:57pm
Btw, this is a dumb question, but do you think I should join Facebook? In a way, I miss out on a number of models of people.
Nov 3, 2019 12:58pm
It is excellent for reconnecting however most of my closer and more intimate friendships are not on Facebook. It is very advertisement consumer driven with I creditable amout of bad information, mis information, and crazy bat shit blow your mind stuff.
Nov 3, 2019 1:02pm
There is no writing. On rare occasions an educated friend will write a few sentences. Mostly pictures and memes. And then there is the complete invasion of privacy.
Nov 3, 2019 1:03pm
My sugesstions, yes you are missing out. But beware, enter at your own risk.
