title: Wiki: Fundamental Epistemic Structure

[[h0p3]]'s wiki's //Fundamental Epistemic Structure// is the following:

* About
* Principles
* Focus
* Vault
* Dreams

This structure came about organically over the course of this year. Let me tell you, I thought what I've done here is just pure fucking genius. It turns out, I'm just doing the obvious. Of course, it turns out, I'm applying age-old principles, I just didn't know how to stick words to it, to realize what it was in all contexts. With my [[H-book]], or at least in that time period (should have seen my chalkboard), I was explicit about pursuing the science of my own happiness. It took me a year to accidentally arrive at the methodology, what I call [[Applied Computational Existentialism]]. Look...

The basic scientific method:

* PROBLEM
* HYPOTHESIS
* EXPERIMENT
* RESULTS
* CONCLUSION

//About// states the problem. It is the bootloader. It is the explanation of my conflict, worry, etc. It is the reason I'm writing it. Although, it seems to also do the other steps from time to time as well. (Not a perfect analogy/relationship, obviously.) I think I also find the hypothesis in this section as well often enough, or at least the qualitative, verbal notion of it.

//Principles// describes the nature of the experiment. It attempts to quantify the experiment, to layout the rules and parameters, etc.

//Focus// is literally the execution of the experiment itself. It is the grounds and laboratory.

//Vault// is where I store my results. No, for real! 

//Dreams// is where I digest the results in a sense, it is a place to plan, a place to figure out how to either restate the problem or offer new hypotheses.

This is far from perfect. There are differences. I need to think about it.
