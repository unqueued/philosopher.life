//Surely heaven is probably empty except Jesus and some previous version of Ol' Yeller. You have to put down the rabid dog sometimes.//

This is a hedged-conservative get-out-of-jail-with-[[h0p3]] free card available to you for the rest of your life. 

You have the legal positivistic political right to ignore me (not as meaningful as one would hope). As to whether or not you have a moral right, well, that's another matter entirely. However, I'm convinced some people have more than earned the right to ghost me, and to exercise a right to be released from dealing with me entirely. [[IA2DYJ]]. As stupid as it sounds, this a contract token I'm obligated to carry out.
