title: 2019.05.12 - Prompted Introspection: Money Growing Up

!! Did you grow up with lots of money or very little? How much money (give numbers it makes things interesting)?

Very little. Due to a Supreme Court case (IIRC), United Methodism's unique governance forced pastors to pay both self-employed and employed taxes. My donors worked in a fairly poor area in KY, and net pay was $13k a year + parsonage (in 91-96). By the time I was a teenager, it was bumped considerably to the point that my donors could pay for a 10 year mortgage. This was where I started to see the largest turn in their attitudes toward the poor. They still serve the poor on the assumption it is all-too-often the fault of the poor mixed with a profound survivor's bias.
