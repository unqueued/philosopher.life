I'm sorry to hear about your grandmother. Is she going to be okay?

It's difficult to stay in touch with people, especially if people will not put in as much effort you are willing to. I'm sorry that so few keep in touch or give you a way to connect with them.

I have a difficult time picking out what counts as original. But, I totally understand despising the majority of at least parts of adult humans to some degree. Swathes of my family are a trainwreck too. =/. 

10-4 on the vandalization, lol. I despise the fact that violence is likely required to bring justice to the world.
