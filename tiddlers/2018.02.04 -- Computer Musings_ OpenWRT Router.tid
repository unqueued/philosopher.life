Well, I have OpenWRT. Now it's time to make use of it.

After getting it actually connected to the interwebs, my first order of business is trying to find a way to shadowsocks it over to ATL. I am unsurprised to see this is largely a Chinese venture. I'm even less surprised to see how much censorship I see on the web. There are people take down their down on this topic.
