!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week given the wikis:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I think [[I|1uxb0x]] did poorly in quite a few respects, but I've also been getting quite a bit done. I think [[I|1uxb0x]] also forgot to get a [[Philosophical Analysis]] [[done|Chance]]. I think I also have thought on [[the absurd|‚ä•&‚ä•&‚ä•]] quite a bit. I have been falling back heavily on [[The Science of Well-Being]]. I am proud about how well I did in [[the fifth chapter of the lightning-thief|The Lightning Thief: 5, draft 2]] but I have failed on the sixth.
** j3d1h
*** You're doing much better with the Lightning Thief drafts. They're not nearly as top-heavy, and you're saying more about what you think of the story. Your Prompted Introspection logs are also changing a bit. I think they're more on topic than they used to be. You're picking them out instead of just answering whatever you get, right?
** k0sh3k
*** I like that you are honestly thinking about the quotes you've collected for Antipleonasm Analysis, although I'm not sure you are really fully understanding what the speaker is saying. Perhaps could add a section on learning close reading to your school plan for next semester? I am disappointed that you didn't fix your Chapter 5 draft, and I don't see Chapter 6, of The Lightning Thief. I wish I saw more on your Science of Well-Being work, too. Did you not get the first two sections done? Overall, though, I am glad to see so much in here!
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] has been wrestling with controlling his time, employing the pomodoro technique, and completing his [[TTP]] tasks. He's been working hard on his language arts skills, including reading difficult philosophical texts, taking notes, summarizing, and presenting his analysis. I think he's demonstrating a Platonist perspective. He's been making a lot of pho to eat, and I think seaweed might be one of his favorite snacks. He's been taking to [[magic]] like a fish to water. With ups and downs, overall, I think he had a [[good]] week.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** [[j3d1h]] seems to be able to make very good jokes(How does she do it?) and a lot of them to herself in her wiki. Also, how do you just let your brain be and just fall asleep? It's practically impossible to not be active in my head when trying to get to sleep. I think [[j3d1h]] has had ups and downs in this week with her work(just like I did.). I think your [[The Lightning Thief // Chapter Five]] was good for being notes.
** j3d1h
*** I feel like I'm just catching up to myself, even though it isn't that hard to do. I'm wondering if there's a different problem that's making it harder (apart from not trying). I was a little meaner to the prompts and quotes this week, for some reason. I'm still missing parts of my day in the life logs. h0p3ful review still went generally well this week, I think?
** k0sh3k
*** I'm surprised you liked Captain Fantastic so much, when I really, really, really disliked it. Perhaps we should look at your night routine and see if there's something we can do to help you sleep? I'm sad to see that you also didn't finish you Chapter 5 paper, and I don't see Chapter 6, either. We will probably eat tofu more often; I think it worked well, and you all liked it well enough.  You're well on your way to becoming a Grammar Nazi, yay!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I like the way you define the key concepts and analyze quotes before responding to them. Where is week 2 work of Science of Well-Being?
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] has been begging herself to accomplish her [[TDL]] tasks. VIXI has been on her mind, and I think she's trying to find a way to connect with Pots (and perhaps other RPers) with this device. It's cool AF. She filled out her paperwork and talked with her doctor on her own; she was in charge of her healthcare (she did a [[good]] job). She's been developing her writing process and voice, and I daresay she's shaping her personality. She's [[beautifully]] sarcastic with her father (so many treasures). She tried to get me to make a PBJ with salsa, like a weirdo. I don't know why she's euphemizing so much. She struggles to get her work done when nobody is watching; the [[ROG]] is painful to wear well.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for keeping our hair routines on your wiki, I must remember to make sure that is on my wiki. Thank you for also keeping things we don't do very well(cat food, etc). I'm sorry that this week hasn't been so good in a lot of ways. Thank you for going over our school plans with us. I also think your RCL was very good this week.
** j3d1h
*** Again, thank you for keeping my hair care routine on your wiki as well! Your prompted introspection logs are definitely getting longer - is that because you have more time for them? Also, yes, thank you a ton for helping me on my school plan. I would have no idea where to go, otherwise. (It was also fun working on it with you!)
** k0sh3k
*** I put a lot of work into getting plans ready for Fall for the kids' school; I'm excited, and I hope they are, too. There's some good learnin' in there! I've also been writing more - and more thoughtfully - in my Prompted Introspections. I had one night of terrible sleep - but it just helped me to realize that I haven't had as many nights of terrible sleep lately. My sleep schedule is completely disrupted lately, though. I don't know that I need to worry about it until I know when I'll be going back to work, though. As long as I can "get to work" by 8:30 and still sleep 8 hours a night, I'm fine, right? Right.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has been hurting this week: she's feeling disconnected from her church-life, her menstruation has been awful, it's been storming (migraines and stomach pains to match), and she's been working her ass off even when others aren't pulling their weight. She's been watching more TV this week, including S01 of //Avenue 5// and S01 and some of S02 of //Westworld// in preparation for S03 (and, it appears she will be eventually just as disappointed in it as GoT post S04). She's been vividly tackling her [[Prompted Introspections]]. She has so many worlds to navigate, so many people to understand and account for in her reasons and feelings: I am shocked by her ability to tie it together. Clearly, she's had //The Science of Well-Being// on the brain, and I'm grateful that she has taken the time to help our offspring go through the course with her (sometimes she is like Superwoman to me). [[k0sh3k]]'s sleep schedule has been adjusting to working from home, and she's obviously been planning how to make use of this very special window of time. She's been developing the Fall semester school plans with our offspring, and I'm so grateful to her radical and sacrificial motherhood (she sets the bar so high, I will never attain it as a father). I adore when she grafts our old media into our wikis (long has she been the thankless keeper of the family record).

** 1uxb0x
*** Your wiki review for the fifth doesn't have anything in it(though, I have little to no room to talk here). Also, please stop being disgusting. I'm glad you collect links that are meaningful(some of the time, [[example of not|https://i.redd.it/y2z981j0ls941.jpg]]), but also funny. I think you are very skilled in making jokes. I think your h0p3ful reviews have helped us alot.
** j3d1h
*** I think you're having a lot more fun with your title.Titles. About a year ago, you tried to very strictly describe the point of a log - now you just have something to link it at all, or a funny joke you found along the way. Your Philosophical Analyses feel sort of all-over-the-place, but organized at the same time. You're great at presenting from these bullet points. Also, I know I said that people are talking to you more because they're stuck in their houses. What if they are because you're just reliable to talk to?
** k0sh3k
*** Aw, you do appreciate the cats! ‚ù§Ô∏è You've met more people in our neighborhood than I have. I like that we've been sneaking time together while I'm "at work" to snuggle or shop, although I could do without the flash-distractions during Zoom meeting. üòõ I wouldn't walk on my own, maybe, but I do like walking with you. I'm glad you picked up the tofu - it turned out to be a pretty good addition, and maybe we should get it more often. I'd still like to do Meatless Mondays.
** h0p3
*** I've been in an ASCII-mood this week. I am grateful to have a family which aims to enable us to be anxious together, safe with each other, and also willing to build together when it is anxiety-incuding. It is the highest honor a shitty father like me can achieve: when each person in my family is not afraid of me, but willing to be directly honest in disagreeing with me. Crocker's Rules become a joy in some odd places; I am grateful for the opportunity to care and trust that far down. I've been gravefully concerned about the global and US economies; Post-CV19 is going to be a different world, and it's difficult to guess because the world is in high-rate of change, and a discontinuous, highly variant flux (with a flood of multi-ordered uncertainty in the factors) too big for anyone to predict and risk-assess well - I'm pessimistic, and I'm not very [[hope]]ful here (descriptively, might tends to make right in material dialectics, especially in crisis). Overall, school has gone well; we push in hard places. I've been lucky to have the conversations I've had with everyone in my life. PBJ was hilarious. I'm treasuring my time with my offspring right before bed; I am a lucky father.
