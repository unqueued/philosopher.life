title: 2020.02.07 - Wiki Review: Never Listen To But Always Imitate My Elders

* [[2020.02.06 - Link Log: My Butt Itches]]
** One thing I like about sitting on my links is that I have the chance to check myself. Unfortunately, there are places where it must be split-second.
* [[2020.02.06 - chameleon: no worries]]
** I'm touched that she has this thoughtful. I think it sets us up to construct so well together. 
*** It reminds me heavily of the [[hyperconversation]]al shaping of long-form drafting. I wish I saw things that fast. Autistic AF over here.

** I have a feeling he won't be interested. Maybe I'm wrong. I hope so.
* [[2020.02.06 - Prompted Introspection: Talking About Problems]]
** Edited. Uh, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to reason about here. 
*** Do I need to go find an epistemic authority to help me?
**** I don't know, do you?
***** Do I need an epistemic authority to help me figure out if I need an epistemic authority?

** She's too tired. I think it's getting worse too. =/.

** With sorrow, I am reminded that sometimes I am too [[hope]]ful: [[2017.01.27 - Realpolitik Speculation: RNC's Impeachment of Trump]]. I thought even his own party would rise against him, lol! I must begin thinking like an evil person more effectively (particularly with historical examples) than I have to make more accurate predictions.
*** When I do, all I want to do is hold my children. 
* [[2020.02.06 - Wiki Audit: Mods]]
** Also, wtf happened to [[Wiki: TDL]]? It got wiped. Zoinks.
** I need my son to start diving into making TW his own. He's going to have to practice with his sister too. I don't think he really understands that he can make it programmatically his own; it's not like Minecraft to him yet in all ways.

** Completed. I'm sore. Meditation is also all over the fucking place. Swirling.
** We'll try to see if our neighbors want to eat dinner then, eh? Even as a hermit, I hate this insulated feeling where neighbors don't know each other at all or beyond the surface. Wake up, mother fuckers!! This is how the end comes.
*** Still no table. No car, no truck, no table, no dinner.
