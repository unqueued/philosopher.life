It's clear that [[Process Discipline]] has something right about it. Is it that obvious? How much should I explore this space?

It's true that I started my life as not virtue-theoretically understanding and applying the belief that people lie effectively enough. I have been so easily deceived so many times in my life. It has been painful to realize how little I can empirically-pragmatically and rationally, in dialectic, come to understand it. I have become deconstructionist over time because that is what helped me succeed in the eyes of others for my credentials, and I have found it necessary to weeding, finding, and throwing off dogmatic yolks. I have become someone who can effectively take the [[redpill]], but I am not nearly virtuous enough in my construction of [[diamond]]s. That's part of why I love this wiki. It gives me, through [[Process Discipline]], the ability to safely and hopefully snowballily construct and model that which I cannot model otherwise. I'm autistic enough that I can access a great number of sense perceptions and hold particular kinds of structures in my head (yes I know how arrogant that sounds, that is my opinion of my arrogant phenomenology) quite well; I am in the eternal quest to model them correctly. I must shoot for the other side of vice.
