title: 2019.05.31 - Prompted Introspection: Oldest Photographs

!! Tell about one of the oldest photographs you have.

I have no idea. My wife maintains all of our photos. Photos are powerful, instantly emotional, but I've never found them to be richly accurate depictions of our narratives. Photos have generally felt mostly fake to me since I was young. I am fine with being reductive, and I appreciate having photos to complement writing.

Perhaps my mind will change. Maybe decades from now I will be far more grateful and capable of appreciating our photos. My favorite part of our photos is having something for my children and wife to appreciate.
