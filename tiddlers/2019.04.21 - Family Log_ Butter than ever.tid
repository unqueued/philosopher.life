* 1uxb0x
** People know me at church
** You're doing a good job tying what you're learning in history with human thought generally
** I'm glad you're a person I can share my memes with; it's hard to introduce someone to a memeplex
** You did a good job working Conky - I know you didn't want to, but you did a good job
** Thank you for helping me on Thursday and Friday
*** You had a good attitude while we worked, and I'm really grateful for your attitude
** I love how you're good at giving compliments that compliment us both; I think it's a  good reflection on our parenting
**Good job on your test!
* j3d1h
** I had to do a lot today at church, and I did it!
** I've been trying to draw more, digitally and traditionally, just in general
** Thank you for helping me on Thursday and Friday
*** You disassembled 10 and reassembled it; you had a good attitude while we worked, and I'm really grateful for your attitude
** Thank you for helping me shop yesterday!
** Thank you for trying to teach me how to wear the rope/belt for the robes at church

** Thank you for getting us tons upon tons of sweet stuff for Easter
** Thank you for letting me know about the cookies
** Thank you for helping me when I was a zombie this week; I appreciate your filling in the gaps and being lubricant. 
* h0p3
** I have had a good attitude about my failures with M16, and did a good job trying to balance my workload and took a break from emotional letter-writing, which was not easy
** Thank you for involving the kiddos in the M16 Project, so they get some experience with this sort of thing; it's the sort of thing most people keep their kids away from so it doesn't get "messed up" - I am grateful that you always involve the kids in real problems and projects
** I think it's great you try to write on K, even if it's really hard to do and you had "cruise-control" on
** You gave me a really good sense of humor
