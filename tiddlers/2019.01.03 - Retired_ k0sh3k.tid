//To you, my wife. My beloved limerencifier, it is my covenant with you and the sublationary [[Moral Law|The Moral Law]] to seek maximal memetic coherence and consistency with you both. To [[adok]] we do align, no matter how close or far apart we grow, I [[hope]] to always show you the [[Straussian]] empathy, kindness, and hospitality owed to alien angels.<<ref "1">> I want you to be happy. I want to wrestle-fuck you gently, evenly matched forever.//

<<<
There is only one happiness in this life, to love and be loved.

-- George Sand
<<<

This is a unique directory. I do not fully understand its status.<<ref "2">> It's like I'm trying to hand you top security read+write clearance to my art, but you've always had [[Root User]] access to my life. 

You could always change this wiki on and off the screen, but here is also an explicit environment set aside for you to write your own thoughts. I don't mean this as a useless gesture. I want you to see that I take us extremely seriously. Own me, love. 

I see marriage as a covenant between two people.<<ref "3">> I literally gave my life to you, and you gave yours to me. Corporations aren't people, but we're trying to be one person spiralling around each other into our gravity well, praying to become a singularity. We own each other, and in love, we cultivate and program each other.<<ref "4">> We are engaged in a lifelong marital accountabilibuddy dialectic designed to maximize cooperation and unify us as much as possible.<<ref "5">> That is our commitment to each other. 

If I could "renew" my vows, it would be in the spirit of the knowledge of what it means to have a complex right and responsibility to shape the other. Essentially, we aren't individually autonomous in marriage, we help each other make decisions about who we are and will be. To a degree, I always knew this, but one can still have paradigm shifts within that field. The meaning of our covenant is only highlighted and deepened for me. I really do love you, and I want you to mold me into a person you want me to be. I trust you, and I'm committed to you.

I hope this is a place where you work on me and where I listen to you. In a sense, this wiki is for both of us. I want to shape myself into something we both love. Help me do that, please. No matter how you choose, I can only say //thank you// for believing in me enough to let me write this wiki. It is such a testament to your habitually radical integrity, commitment, and fundamental love for me. I see the costs it bears upon you, and I am sorry for the pain I cause you with this lifetool. Thank you for loving me through thick and thin. I don't know if I will ever be able to repay you for your gift to me.

I want you to know how much I trust you and seek your happiness. One odd way to say it is this: if you came home with a dead body in the back of the trunk, my instinct, and what I in fact would do, would be to to do whatever it takes to make sure you are safe and don't get in trouble. I am convinced by your Reason. It doesn't matter who you are; I want whatever is best for you.

* What do you want them to be?
* Help shape me so that we can both be happy.<<ref "6">>
* I'll write in bold when weaving my writing with yours.
