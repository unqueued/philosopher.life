Question 1)

Domestic Justice:

John Rawls, in A Theory of Justice, offers a powerful social contractarian heuristic device for determining the principles of justice. The “basic structure” of society, as described by Rawls, is constituted by formal, legal, political and economic institutions. How best to configure the basic structure is a central to justice, in Rawls’ view, because it fixes the distribution of goods, services, opportunities, authorities, and rights. The basic structure is the initial subject of justice. It is here (either for the creation of a basic structure or as an assessment of one) that one can begin to question and formulate the principles of justice which normatively define the various possible configurations of the basic structure. Principles of justice design, specify, assess and justify the blueprints, arrangement and practices of these institutions and the overall basic structure. Rawls is famous for this device which formulates the principles of justice, a device he calls the “original position.”

The original position is a type of thought experiment, an abstraction, a hypothetical instance of drawing up a social contract among members of society, and a method of thinking about justice. The parties within the original position are meant to agree upon whatever counts as the fair and correct principles of justice used to generate the basic structure to which they would find themselves subject outside of the original position. The original position structures intuitions we have about justice and how we formulate them – the original position is designed to provide an impartial justice, and render a stable society. Notably, the concern for impartiality and fairness is what leads us to the most profound and potent fixture in the original position, what Rawls calls the “veil of ignorance.”

Agents in the original position find themselves ‘behind’ a veil of ignorance. While behind this veil, “no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does anyone know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength and the like. I shall even assume that the parties do not know their conceptions of the good or their special psychological propensities.” Agents are deprived of the knowledge of their personal particularities, what societies they come from, and their histories. Some of the attributes which count as morally arbitrary in Rawls’ eyes might be considered controversial (e.g. your religious beliefs), but let us pass it by. The essential point, to which I think we can all intuitively agree, is that differences which are arbitrary from the moral point of view don’t count with regards as to how the principles of justice treat you. Agents behind the veil must be detached from their actual, particular circumstances when formulating the principles of justice. Proper justice requires we answer a hypothetical question: “if you couldn't know who you were, what would you choose?” This makes a lot of sense - it removes bias. Thus, the principles of justice which are produced from within the original position and behind the veil of ignorance are in some sense impartial and unbiased.

What then constitutes these agents, these amorphous creatures which have shed morally arbitrary features? Rawls believes these agents have a sense of justice, being willing to comply with what is required by justice. They are also free and equal agents. Vitally, agents behind the veil are rational, mutually disinterested utility-maximizers. These characteristics provide the motivation and mindset of agents formulating the principles of justice. They have the necessary tools and knowledge to formulate the correct principles of justice, to know what is normatively just and fair about different configurations of basic structures given their rational, mutually disinterested, utility-maximizing characters. While ignorant of particularities, agents are extremely knowledgeable about generalities. They have a commanding knowledge of general facts about human nature, psychology, sociology, political science, biology, and economics. Thus, with this knowledge, from behind the veil of ignorance, agents are able to rationally construct and agree to the principles of justice, even agreeing with principles which might not benefit them as the individuals they are outside of the original position.

Rawls is very thorough, and despite the hypothetical nature of the original position, he is also practical. He invents a nifty regression test procedure used to make sure we actually agreed to the correct principles of justice. He calls this the “reflective equilibrium.” Employing the reflective equilibrium allows agents to go back and forth between the original position and reality. This method allows us to continually justify and revise (if necessary) the principles of justice.

Interestingly, it just so happens that Rawls thinks he knows exactly which principles of justice would be chosen from within the original position. They essentially are:

1. The Principle of Greatest Equal Liberty -- People are to be as free as possible.

2. The Difference Principle -- Social and economic advantages should be distributed in order to maximize the shares of the most disadvantaged, those on the bottom line. Maximize the minimum.

These principles are lexically ordered in priority. The first principle is the most important one, and the second merits consideration after maximally satisfying the first. Intuitively, it seems that there might be many possible basic structures which equally maximize the first principle, and the second principle does the work of assigning further normative value, effectively acting as a tie-breaker to the subset of initially acceptable basic structures generated by the first.

The theory is supposed to describe 'realistic utopia'. It gets at methodological notions about what political theories are supposed to be trying to do. He imports this from Rousseau, the notion of "Taking men as they are and laws as they might be." Any theory of justice which gets off the ground only by imagining people to be saints, angels, or unrealistically altruistic, ends up failing in his eyes. He thinks theories of justice which are not realistic and rooted in real constraints are bad theories. They still need to be ideal, as they are about looking forward. Theories of justice are relative to the peoples that are used to describe them. This isn't a long term or universal view. It is medium term. What that exactly means, we aren't sure.



International Justice:

Rawls lays out a foreign policy of a reasonably just, liberal people (state). He is answering the question: “How should liberal peoples treat other peoples of a variety of different views?” This is a justification offered from a reasonably just liberal people.

We need to distinguish a technical term here, because there is an important difference between ‘people’ and ‘person’. By ‘peoples’ he means ‘national groups’. A ‘person’ is just that, an individual person. Peoples have 3 features:

    They are united by particular kind of government.

    They have common sympathies.

    They have a firm attachment to a political-moral conception of ‘right’ and justice.

Rawls talks about well-ordered peoples, which includes two subsets, both liberal peoples and decent peoples. He also talks about non-‘well-ordered’ peoples, which are essentially outlaw states, burdened societies, and other sorts of political and economic failings.

He believes that order and legitimacy of rest upon tolerating, although not necessarily agreeing with, decent peoples. Decent peoples don’t violate human rights or act aggressively towards other nations (which is part of being well-ordered), but they might have things like state religions or political practices which aren’t deemed ‘liberal’, which must be tolerated in his view.

The structure of theory is that there are multiple 'Original Position' arguments. There is an Original Position for us as a domestic peoples, but also a different, international 'Original Position' for us as 'liberal peoples' towards everyone.

For Rawls, there are global principles of distributive justice like there are for domestic justice. He does offer the notion of "Duty of assistance" (which is somewhat unspecified), which is maybe a type of justice or morality. Essentially, well-ordered societies must assist "burdened" countries (those who can't get their act together, have disorder, etc.) until those countries also become minimally well-ordered. Differences of wealth between the countries are somehow irrelevant. Only if you "know" this assistance will help the country become well-ordered, only then do you need to help them.



Differences and Controversy:

1) Controversially (at least for some philosophers), Rawls abandons any pretense or aspirations towards moral truth. He has given into the pragmatic postmodernists. His political theory only deals with political institutions, but not the "good" or any comprehensive account of morality. It is ironic that this is controversial though. Normativity of Rawls' political theory is limited in scope by design. He articulates principles directed specifically at political institutions and political structures, nothing more. He attempts to avoid controversial elements, and thus is amenable to a whole variety of comprehensive theories. His theory is similar to Anselm's ontological argument because it seems to use mundane and simple premises, and yet it arrives at a seemingly grand conclusion. It was meant not to be controversial, but somehow it is the exact sort of thing which is so very controversial.

2) The metric of political liberalism isn't "it is true" but rather "it is reasonable" -- What is reasonable (as he uses it as a technical term). Being ‘reasonable’ amounts to "being willing to put forth and abide by principles of cooperation" and "recognizes the burdens of judgment." This recognition is realizing that reasonable persons can disagree with each other, just because figuring out certain facts can be really complicated (or next to impossible). Clearly, the term ‘reasonable’, has couched within it some begged questions. Terminology like this can be misleading, but it isn’t a discussion of philosophy of mind, logic, or epistemology, but rather he has a specific meaning which may or may not be actually reasonable, even if he thinks it is reasonable. Effectively, a sea of philosophically controversial questions arises concerning Political Liberalism and 'reasonable' comprehensive theories.

3) One might think it isn’t really a full-blown international justice, unlike his domestic account. Somehow, his conception of international justice doesn’t seem to demand enough from us, at least as some philosophers’ intuitions have it.

4) Given his domestic Theory of Justice, particularly how he takes such great pains to point out how Justice is unconcerned with morally arbitrary characteristics of agents, we would think that he would be in favor of globalizing that theory theory. Vitally, national boundaries seem arbitrary; they are historical accidents. I think most would agree that this is the sort of morally arbitrary characteristic which doesn’t follow you behind the veil. His domestic justice applied on a global scale would amount to collapsing national boundaries as being morally arbitrary, which likely would lead to very robust obligations to the poor. But, Rawls (perplexingly) doesn’t think this.

5)	Interestingly, aid is given to ‘burdened countries’ not out of any distributive aims of equality or maximin, or things like that, but rather simply to build and maintain well-ordered nations. Domestic Justice has much stronger distributive justice aims.

6) Some people might think that Rawls’ theories are controversial on the belief that Rawls has terrible picture of human nature (similar to Kant's). Arguably, in his defense, Rawls doesn't make these assumptions; he is just offering a heuristic device.

7) Rawls thinks the sources of poverty have a national/local origin. This is a very controversial assumption. What if poverty isn't of local origin? Take an agricultural nation which relies upon agriculture to be out of poverty. Another nation might artificially flood agricultural markets with super cheap products, eliminating the ability to agricultural nation to viably pull themselves out of poverty. It fails to understand globalization principles and how interdependent nations are upon other nations. Some vital factors of economic viability of a nation aren't necessarily in the hands of those nation.



Question 3)

Developed Nations’ Substantial Obligations to the Poor:

Pogge is interested in a sort of institutional contractarian theory. Pogge believes we have negative duties not to harm others. That is an institutional kind of duty, in his view, because one can only have this duty as a member of an institutional. Because you are a member of an institution, you are on the hook, so to speak.

Essentially, he thinks that we shouldn't harm people, and if we do, then we owe them redistribution and recompense. He also thinks that we (the developed world) cause world poverty. Because it is, at least in part, our fault that others are poor, he believes we have serious obligations to the world poor.

Pogge argues a sort of moral universalism:

    All people are subject to morality.

    Moral benefits and burdens are then distributed to all.

    Moral benefits and burdens are formulated generally so as not to privilege or disadvantage any person for an arbitrary reason.

He defends a strong thesis: There is extreme poverty that could be fixed with minimal sacrifices by developed countries. So, there are two claims being made:

    Extreme poverty can be fixed.

    Fixing poverty requires minimal sacrifices.

So, you can see, Pogge combines theoretical elements with empirical data to make a robust redistributive justice system. The empirical component of his argument does a lot of work for him. He really needs to it demonstrate both that "The developed world causes the poverty in the developing world" and that “Fixing poverty requires minimal sacrifices.” From this 'fact', he is able to use his theoretical component to make a powerful argument for what we should do. Pogge's theoretical claim not to harm is not controversial, but his empirical claims 'that we are harming other nations' are controversial.

Pogge’s solution is a global resource dividend (GRD), which makes up for, pays back and restores the victims of the harm we cause. It is essentially a tax on the wealthy and naturally rich. Those who make the most use of Earth’s natural resources (the wealthy) must globally compensate those who can’t use those resources (the poor).

This proposal makes a lot of sense, as we must consider the share of natural resources as belonging to all people. In one sense, natural resources seem to be geographically arbitrary, and thus it seems everyone has a claim to it, everyone has a stake in limited resources of the planet. The GRD equalizes the value of natural resources across the world, while helping the poor.



How We Harm the Global Poor:

Pogge says we harm the global poor in several ways:

1)	Resource Privilege -- A government’s right to sell resources on the open market can harm people. It can steal natural resources from people. Illegitimate leaders can sell off natural resources, keeping the money for themselves, or unwisely investing it in Elvis memorabilia, etc. This causes current and future citizens of the nation to be resource-poor.

2) Borrowing Privilege -- Leaders can put country into debt, and they can steal it, and leave the country screwed. Leaders act in the name of their country, but this borrowing may not actually help their nation at all. Perhaps developed nations are also looking to make ‘too much money’ off the poor, abusing their financial status and power, forcing impoverished into unfair and detrimental loans.

3) Unfair Trade – This includes a pretty wide array of practices. An example would be subsidies that eliminate a poor nation’s comparative advantage. Perhaps farm subsidies in our nation make agricultural products artificially cheap, so cheap that countries which could make a profit and would have had comparative advantage in producing those agricultural products no longer can.

It seems that the developed nations of the world are the causes in these cases. Developed nations are the people buying up resources from and lending to illegitimate leaders. Trade policies of the developed world are also the sort which can be very unfair to the world poor. Developed nations need institutional reform to stop harming impoverished nations in these ways.

Ideally, developed nations should also learn how to mitigate the damage caused political corruption (particularly with respect to the first w problems) of impoverished nations – it is within the power of developed to stop it.

Developed nations also need to make up for past harm caused to the impoverished. The GRD will help right the wrongs we have committed against these people, and ensure that the impoverished will continue to be aided.



Cohen’s Objection:

Cohen responds to Pogge. He is worried about the support for Pogge’s “Strong thesis,” that most of the global poverty problem could be eliminated through minor modifications in the global order, entailing at most slight reductions in the incomes of the affluent.

Cohen isn't saying that Pogge is wrong about the Strong thesis, but he is saying that Pogge is wrong about how effective the empirical data can support the strong thesis. The claim is that the empirical evidence is less certain and more controversial than Pogge seems to think. Essentially, this amounts to the strong thesis assuming or demonstrate more certainty about what sorts of claims (particular the 'most poverty' responsibility claims) that can derived from the empirical data than something like (what he calls) the conventional thesis. Conventional Thesis: Some global poverty could be eliminated by changes in global rules that would not themselves result in serious moral injuries.



Pogge’s Reponse to Cohen:

Pogge responds to Cohen, explaining that Cohen fails to look at the statistics which advanced/motivated his (Pogge's) argument. Pogge is claiming that the empirical evidence required to support or deny his argument is, in some sense, sparse. We need more evidence. But, given our current evidence, it is good enough to support his theory.

Furthermore, since Pogge’s thesis is about minor modifications, why shouldn’t we be motivated to at least test it out? Cohen agrees that Pogge isn’t asking for much, just very minor financial sacrifices on the part of wealthy nations, so ironically, it should be an easy and worthwhile thesis to test.
