* [[To-Do-List Log]]
** Edited. Making it classier.
* [[Day Trading]]
** So many fish to fry. This should wait. Let it build.

** Honestly: meh.

** Looks cleaner.
* [[Carpe Diem Log]]
** Ditto.
* [[2017.11.05 -- Yearly Audit Log]]
** Felt productive. Maybe it wasn't?
* [[2017.11.05 -- Link Log]]
** Consuming a lot of that drug.
* [[2017.11.05 -- Prompted Introspection Log]]
** Redpilled and true.
* [[2017.11.05 -- To-Do-List Log]]

*** At some point, am I no longer responsible for their choices?
* [[2017.11.05 -- Wiki Review Log]]

** Edited.
* [[2017.11.05 -- /b/]]
** Yup, it's random.
