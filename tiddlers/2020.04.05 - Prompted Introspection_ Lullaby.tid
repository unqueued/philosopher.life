!! What do you think about as you are falling asleep?

This is a topic that shows up in [[CTS]] often as well as [[Prompted Introspection]]:

I have a terrible relationship with sleep. I've not slept right since I had children, and I'd argue the seeds of terrible sleeping patterns began earlier. In terms of time, I worked and played too hard as a teenager (though not on the right projects), and I should have slept more. I've come to be more [[stoic]] about it over time. I can afford to miss sleep in a way I couldn't before though, so it's easier to be stoic too.

Usually, I'm halfway between my lullaby show and closed-eye visual hallucinations, feeling my soft blanket and pillowed fortress which hugs me. I can't fall asleep while I'm wrestling, but I tend to wrestle in my sleep quite a bit. I spend so much time in my wiki that I'm regularly in a dream-version of it, making new toddlers to throw my shitty dreams (especially about being in the wiki) into, lol. On a good night, I'm thinking: "it's safe to fall asleep, it's good to get some sleep, you need sleep, mmm....that woman has really good boobs...*no abstract thoughts*...*just feeling*. I slip, ooze, and sometimes I'm hurled into my sleep.
