Wow! You made my day, sir. There are few people who cause me to pause in silence.<<ref "s">> My jaw just dropped when I saw your letter in my inbox. I am humbled to hear from you in writing.

Please check out the [[Readme]], make yourself at home, and let me know if I can [[help]] [[you|gh057]].

<<<
h0p3,

Hey hope you are having a good summer, Im still working on floors at the school. I think we should have another week or better before finished. 
<<<

Yeah, my summer is going well enough. It's had its ups and downs, but overall it's been productive. My offspring have made significant progress in school. We've been exercising, reading and writing, working on our computers, and making sure the house doesn't fall apart. I've been job hunting, but nothing has come up yet.

If I recall correctly, you predicted 6 weeks on those floors, and that's on the money (or even a bit faster). I hope it's going well.

<<<
I have made your wiki a daily read. I have truly enjoyed reading it.
<<<

I am shocked and honored. You have me grinning from ear-to-ear. I am sure I have erased all doubt in your mind: I am a fool or a madman.

I've never had a current co-worker read my heaps upon heaps of words before. [[Afterschool Teaching]] might be an interesting log for you. You show up in other places in the wiki too. Search for `The Janitor` in the //Context// tab of $:/AdvancedSearch, and you'll find many of the lines where you show up.

<<<
I think we will get along well and thanks for all the kind words. 
<<<

I call it as I see it. I think we'll get along too; you make it super easy to be kind.<<ref "ih">>

<<<
I truly miss our conversations in the afternoon albeit how short they were. Hopefully after i get out of here we can meet up for a beer or something. I hope your family are well.
<<<

Absolutely! You should visit us!<<ref "o">> We would be honored to have you and your family (if they are up for it) over at our place. You have our address. Let me know if yall have any dietary requirements. Tell me what beer you like so I can stock up. We'll have lunch or dinner (or both!). I have scheduled events on July 4-5 and 19-21,<<ref "m">> but I will make any other dates work. I would be happy to see you anytime: you pick out the [[salient]] dates/times for us. 

Do you like to swim? Does your granddaughter? There is a pool (with no deep end) right down the road we use, and I bet she would have a blast. We could BBQ, swim, throw a frisbee, watch a movie, or chill and talk.

I'd very much like for you to get to know my family (and vice versa). They've heard me speak of you in the wiki and offline often.

<<<
And as soon as i can learn more about using your wiki ill start using it...lol im old and hard to teach and harder to learn things lol.
<<<

Ah, don't worry about it. I'm still learning how to use this monstrosity I've made myself. I am happy to answer any questions you have. I do virtually all of my writing over my wiki. Bookmark this in your browser: https://philosopher.life/#gh057. You'll find my communications to you in that timeline. Maybe when you over for some beer, I'll walk you through this wiki. Each member of my family has one; you might find those interesting as well.

<<<
thanks for letting me ramble to you. Thanks for being a friend. Your missed and appreciated.
<<<

Thank you. Don't worry about rambling; it is my pleasure to read and listen. Even if I didn't, I have no room to talk: I'm sure you'll be hearing me ramble plenty, friend.

<<<
Best,

gh057
<<<

I won't be directly revealing your offline identity unless you tell me to. As I do for my immediate family, I have picked out a [[Leet]] [[name]] for you instead.<<ref "f">> I think it fits you, but I'm often wrong - so if you want a name change, please let me know. If you are interested in having [[others]] who read this wiki be able to reach out to you, then please set up an anonymized e-mail account on https://protonmail.com/.<<ref "i">>

It's awesome to hear from you! I'm elated. Thank you for writing to me.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
