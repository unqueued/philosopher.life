Have a great day [[h0p3]]! ^_^
WED 9:44 AM
You too, [[K]]! =)
WED 9:44 AM
What you up to today?
WED 9:44 AM
Work and....work. Almost said school. :upside_down_face:
WED 9:44 AM
Haha
WED 9:44 AM
Hey, you want any audiobooks for work?
WED 9:47 AM
Sure. That sounds great!
WED 9:48 AM
Any particular books of interest to you?
WED 9:49 AM
Hmmm. I’ll do some digging. Any Steven King would be great. I’ve been meaning to pick up a Brandon Sanderson fantasy novel too but I haven’t looked into it just yet.
WED 9:49 AM
Actually a lot of people have told me to read wheel of time. I just haven’t gotten around to it yet.
WED 10:01 AM
Sidenote: I bought some Junji Ito horror manga. It’s trippy as fuck. If you liked horror, I bet you would really enjoy the disturbing (almost psychedelic in some places) visuals.
WED 10:02 AM
Gonna need a bit of time. Those are large files.
WED 10:02 AM
Oh there’s no rush.
WED 10:02 AM
I’m just kinda rambling.
WED 10:03 AM
I am an illiterate fan of horrorifying visual art, but I can't handle the narratives (reality is already that bad to me).
WED 10:03 AM
Hahaha. I feel you. Some of the stuff in this manga really stuck with me after I read it. :scream:

You are just using our sync on your desktop, right? This will soak up ~50GB of space. Also, I must warn you in advance that I periodically clear out my syncs with others. You should copy (or even move) the data out of the sync to protect it.
WED 10:05 AM
I think so. I’ll check when I get home. If that’s too much at the moment we can wait.
WED 10:06 AM
Thanks for the warning.
WED 10:06 AM
Loading to our sync now (will take about an hour): 55 King audiobooks, Wheel of Time audio, and all of Junji Ito I could find.
WED 11:37 AM
Thank you [[h0p3]]. You are a saint. ^_^
WED 11:42 AM
Lol. Your welcome. I hope it makes work more awesome for you.
WED 11:42 AM
You're* - I'll get there one day.
WED 11:42 AM
It will. I finally bit the bullet and tried Critical Role. I like it a lot more than the first three times I tried to listen to it.
WED 11:57 AM
I must continue to try podcasts as well. I've been trying for a long time (since the word was invented), and nothing has ever stuck. I must be an obstinate fool, but I'm dependent on text first approaches.
WED 12:03 PM
lol it’s fine
