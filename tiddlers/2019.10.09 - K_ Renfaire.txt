OCT 9 9:55 AM
Went to the Ren faire on Sunday. Played dnd on Saturday. Spent Monday and Tuesday (fall break) doing homework the whole time. :â€™)
OCT 9 9:55 AM
So thatâ€™s fun. I have 1.5 papers left!
OCT 9 9:56 AM
How are you doing today and the prior weekend?
OCT 9 9:56 AM
Fun and productive. How was the faire?
OCT 9 9:57 AM
It was amazing. Weâ€™re going again Saturday. Lmao
OCT 9 9:57 AM
School is almost done for you. Must be surreal.
OCT 9 9:57 AM
Itâ€™s scary dude. Almost at the drop date and I have no grades posted.
OCT 9 9:57 AM
You guys dressing up for it?
OCT 9 9:57 AM

How go the papers? What do you think you'll be doing at the renfaire?

Spending a lot of money. ðŸ˜…
OCT 11 11:02 AM
Lol
OCT 11 11:02 AM
What do you have planned today and this weekend?
OCT 11 11:02 AM
Interview prep with my wife. Reading and writing as always. More school catchup with offspring. Eating, sleeping, and fucking.
OCT 11 11:02 AM
Hell yeah. Hahaha
OCT 11 11:04 AM
Today is just dragging on. Do you feel that way too?
OCT 11 1:07 PM
I have been lucky so far.
OCT 11 2:38 PM
I donâ€™t have a lot of work to do so Iâ€™m just kinda hanging around.
OCT 11 3:05 PM
That is so odd. The phenomenology of passing time is thought to slow down in virtue of novelty and requiring energy to interpret a world you weren't predicting.
OCT 11 3:38 PM
Maybe you are doing some heavy lifting subconsciously.
OCT 11 3:39 PM
Probably. Midterms were stressful but not because they were difficult, but because of the sheer magnitude of content I had.
