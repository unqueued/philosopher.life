title: Family Computing

Monster-10 continues to thrive. I've had to replace the memory, and that's it. It's a beautiful incarnation. 

HTPC is solid, but it's potential is not tapped. It sits, waiting, slowly evolving sometimes. It comes and goes.

Unfortunately, many PCs in our family have been killed by their users this year. The deathcount is 3, one by each family member (except me /cross-fingers).

I want everyone in the house to have a phone, laptop, and desktop if they want one. I won't include tablets or other trifles for now. I also want everyone to be able to just use any computer when necessary.

* Household
** Router
** HTPC(/NAS/VM-Server)

* h0p3
** monster-10
** monster-12
** Moto G5+

* k0sh3k
** monster-12
** Moto E4

* 1uxb0x
** Moto E4

* j3d1h
** i3
** Moto E4

Right now, we've got accounts for 1uxb0x on the other machines. But, we need to solve this, and quickly. It is unacceptable for people to not have computers. My wife may just want a good laptop with proper docking.

Personally, I think laptops are best for portable use, but not full-time machines. I prefer them very low-end, terminal oriented. I want nice keyboards/touchpads, SSDs, and decent screens, but they don't need to be stellar. 

Desktops should have oomph, long-term staying power, space, and versatility for the user's general needs. 

Take 1uxb0x's borken laptop and turn it into k0sh3k's desktop.

Try the spare i7-2600k chip we have in the i3 box. Let's soup is up. Swap for a newer video card, and that machine can engage in serious gaming. My son is younger, and he doesn't use his computer like his sister yet. That's still a wildly nicer machine than she had at his age, even compensating for inflation of computational power.

Build my daughter's dream machine. Hypervisor-ready CPU, 2 SSDs, 1 HDD, 2 GPUs, and eventually Oculus Rift.

I need some nice headphones so that I can listen to music and work while my wife watches her braincandy shows.
