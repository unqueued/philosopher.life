!! Audit:

* I completed 4 books. Not great, but not bad.
* All the books I read were worth reading.
* My wife has very vivid worlds she enters into.
** I think she prefers them directly because they have enough realism to pull her into it. She is obviously deeply invested in the human condition, which I love about her and these stories.
* I will eventually do another King book, but not for now.
* I've not included [[The Nix]] here, but that is more of an afterthought.
* I hate to say it, but none of the books absolutely blew me away. That is becoming harder and harder to do. We will see though, as these may still have very long-term consequences that I've not yet experienced. 
* Keep up the good work!
