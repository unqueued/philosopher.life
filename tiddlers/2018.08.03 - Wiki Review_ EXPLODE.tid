** I needed to think, even if I didn't have anything to write.
* [[2018.08.02 - Reddit: Clearcut]]

** These are taking longer to write out, and not just because there are more members of these lists.
* [[2018.08.03 - Daily TDL: Help My Son]]

** Silly, but you never know. Having a hard time coming up with GPU options that seem to work nicely for me. Not worth my time though.
* [[Wiki TDL]]
** Perhaps we are a ways away from it, but that's a good thing to try to accomplish later.
* [[2018.08.02 - Self-Dialectic: Strauss]]
** But, that isn't a bad thing.
* [[j3d1h: Yearly Plan]]
** More to think about.
* [[Tiddlywiki Howto: Embed Youtube Video]]
** Yet, the video I wanted to play isn't allowed to be embedded. =(

** I'm glad we are doing this. I think it will add up to something.
* [[Work!]]
** Fuck yeah. I wish I could autostart this.
* [[MAYMAYS]]
** I hope this place grows into something truly awesome.
* [[Master-Sign-Slave.py]]
** Btw, I'm going bottom to top in this review...Ditto!
* [[Master-Verify-Slave.py]]
** I'm hoping this just sits here, completely unused.
* [[Argon2-Password-Ed25519-Keygen.xsh]]
** Lowercase? 
** I'm kind of shocked this tool doesn't exist cleanly out in the wild.
* [[Master Ed25519 Public Key]]
** That fuckup was bad...rofl. Welp, shit happens, and this is exactly why I want this tool.
* [[2018.08.02 - Computer Musings: 25519]]
** I'm glad to have finally done this thing I've been waiting to do for quite a while.
