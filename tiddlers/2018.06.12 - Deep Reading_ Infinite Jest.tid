title: 2018.06.12 - Deep Reading: Infinite Jest

-=][ Rabbitholed ][=-

I read this book knowing full well my verbal IQ is too low to "get it." I only look like I've read books under particular spotlights and poses. I don't know the difference between a genuine literary scholar and myself, but I know it's a big fucking difference (only the basic conscious understanding of my ignorance). I'd like to think that the author would still get a kick out me trying to understand it, and I suggest he would find my wiki to be interesting as well (which may have a more quantitative approach to it). 

I've seen this book floating around in many corners for a while now. I took one look at it before and thought it wouldn't be worth my time. I'm beginning to think it might be worth my time now, so I will try.

After telling my brother JRE about it, I was told that some of the work I'm doing in this wiki is very relatable to what DFW has done in IJ. I hope to learn a great deal from DFW's masterpiece. Perhaps I will have some guidance in wandering this rabbithole of my own.

I'm going through first without looking up (if I can). That's stupid arrogant of me. If the book is really that amazing, I'll go through it far more carefully the second time.

Sounds like pursuing the approval of ourselves is really fucking hard. Approval, if justificatory, is clearly philosophical.

I am worried that many of the people who adore //Infinite Jest// are proud psychopaths. That is odd for a work of fiction, right? Something like Ayn Rand... Does someone need to be dark-triadic in a lack of empathy somehow to truly love the work? Are they merely signaling? I do not know.

There is something lacking in empathy by not providing the audience their preferred linear story telling arcs. Let's hope the pain is worth it, eh?
