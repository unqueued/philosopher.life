How goes it, [[Jop]]?
TUE 12:56 PM
I'm doing good I just went to the Boxing class. I did ask the trainer and he said it's a Thai Boxing.
TUE 12:57 PM
Ah.
TUE 12:58 PM
It may be a very Americanized version of real Thai boxing. Kind of like how we can't do Thai food correctly in some cases (even if only for a lack of ingredients).
TUE 12:59 PM
It sounds like fun though.
TUE 12:59 PM
Yes it was fun and I really like it.
TUE 1:01 PM
Cool. It is good for you, and I hope you keep it up. I assume it will help with depression and anxiety.
TUE 1:02 PM
You going to practice it at home too?
TUE 1:02 PM
Might enjoy teaching your daughter's what you learn.

I don't think I can practice it at home but I will keep it up and it's help me with my anxiety that's for sure.
