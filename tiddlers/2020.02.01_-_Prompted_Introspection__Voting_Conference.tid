title: 2020.02.01 - Prompted Introspection: Voting Conference

!! I wish I could go to.....

A conference for people who were designing democratic voting systems owned by the people for the 21st Century. That's one of the practical technical problems I'm most interested in. It annoys me that I seem to have more in common with many [[pright]]ists on sections of this topic than [[pleft]]ists, but I think that could change. 

I don't think this wish would make much sense in a broader context. My progress is going to be limited. I'll do what I can with what I have.

Trying to [[Be A Good Dad]], especially from a young age, requires tremendous sacrifice. My son would be illiterate (maybe even mute), thrown in a babysitting room with special ed kids, unable to develop any autonomy. My daughter would have been a casualty of living in poor neighborhoods, and probably well on her way to becoming a postmodern. That doesn't mean we are going to succeed or be terribly happy in many respects, and I really don't know what the future holds well enough.
