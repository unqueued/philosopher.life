title: 2018.02.25 -- Computer Musings: Shreddit

I do want to participate in Reddit conversations at times, but I also want it to be ephemeral. I'm not interested in being farmed, but I do want to help others think about the world. I'm compromising.

I've setup a nightly cronjob which will shred posts 48 hours old (or older). 

I noticed after a post that I could check top, controversial, etc. for my post history and reach past the 1000 post mark to re-write them. Fascinating. Well, I'm saving those and clearing them out as well.

I looked at how this site appears in resolutions higher than 1080p. 4k is pretty awful.

I have to say, several times I wished I was using Arch instead of manjaro. Several package manager related tools exist only for Arch, but not Manjaro. I'm just not convinced I really have a lot to gain from it though.

I want to practice NixOS.
