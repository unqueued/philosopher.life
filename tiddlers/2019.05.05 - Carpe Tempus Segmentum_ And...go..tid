** I've noticed the walk is usually a space in which we each speak to the entire group. It is rare that we pair off. I try to hold back saying anything because once you stick a quarter in me, I can't stop. I spend a lot of time trying to explain things I can barely say on our walks. I reference hard, I point to the future, and I think as big picture with them as I can as we are out in the world.
* 1-on-1's were excellent. I think I'm having a more difficult time  connecting with my son, and that's on me to fix.
* Chops, baked fries, zucchini, squash
** We need to bake the veggies less. I need firmness.
* Wikis
** It's a joy to read my offspring's self-representations.
