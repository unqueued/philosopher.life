title: 2020.01.29 - Prompted Introspection: Wish I Looked

!! I wish I looked like.... because......

Well, a 10/10 to some demographic, of course. 6'3", 11" penis, chiseled facial features, effortless and drug-enhanced metabolism + ripped physique, etc. Don't be ugly; be attractive. Life is easier that way. Philosophically, we only have appearances to go by, but most don't dig much deeper than the surface. I do my best not to care. Even before we get to what we're responsible for, I take what is most essential to being a human specimen to be the nervous system, not the secondary systems of our meatbags which exist to support it. Saint Aristotle is still largely correct in his definition of the function of humans. Obviously, we can ask what I wished my nervous system looked like as well. This cycle continues. What am I wishing for that matters in [[The End]]?
