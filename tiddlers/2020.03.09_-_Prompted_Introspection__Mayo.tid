title: 2020.03.09 - Prompted Introspection: Mayo

!! What did you eat as a child that you can't stand now as an adult?

[[2018.05.14 - Prompted Introspection Log: As Child, Not As Adult]] is on the money. I liked mayo way more as a child. After visualizing competitive food eating competitions which include vats of mayo, I can no longer enjoy it in globs. Don't get me wrong: huge wads of cum are hawt. Mayo makes me want to gag though, except in the thinnest coatings or as a binding agent in a casserole (and, still, lightly). 

For the record, since eggs are clearly a dairy product according to my elementary school, mayo is too.
