* Stunning!
** https://aeon.co/essays/how-virtue-morphs-into-beauty-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder
*** =) After my own heart! Though, to be clear, I think [[Beauty]] is an objective standard as well (even if it require infinite particularization to all contexts), and [[The Good]] is also perceived (by definition for us!). I agree that [[The Right]] and [[The Beautiful]] are fundamentally at odds with each other in some respects, and I can find this in many places in metaethics. 
*** Obviously "perceptible" is a much broader notion to me. 
*** [[Beauty]], as isolated as I can make it, is that which is attractive but not [[Right]] in [[The Good]]. Of course, [[The Right]] is quite [[beautiful]] in so many aspects. But, of course, what [[The Right]] is calculating cannot just be itself, it must be a substance of another kind, and thus it parasitically requires [[The Beautiful]]. There is no moral calculation without it. 
*** Of course, plenty of moral things are ugly in many respects. If being moral were definitionally beautiful, of course, there wouldn't be immorality. The attractiveness of [[The Good]] is both explanatory (from the beginning) and justificatory (toward the end), and this dialectic (perhaps [[The Dialectic]]) appears to be the core of both directions.
*** I applaud attempts to marry moral beauty, to weld them together. This is likely the fundamental problem in philosophy in the simplest form, as it is the meaning of being.

*** Yes, master and slave dialectics can be stabilized, but only on the assumption that the master doesn't get too greedy. This parasiticism is what I see from reactionaries at the end of the day. That doesn't make it the best option.

*** Dialectics.

* Think About It
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/27/the-troubled-history-of-psychiatry
*** A reasonable start. Unfortunately, I find most people cannot effectively hold a telic perspective of the function of homo sapiens while treating them as ends in themselves (except in virtue of [[The Good]] itself).
** https://thepointmag.com/2019/politics/on-left-straussianism
*** It isn't common to find Leftism and [[Straussian]] thought together. The saner [[Straussian]]'s I've met were ultimately Libertarians who studied literature like paranoid freaks. I don't have their skill, but I'd like to think anyone can apply this kind of reasoning from their context. I don't think "protecting the public from the truth" is the only form of [[pleft]] [[Straussian]]ism either. This is absurd. Realpolitik [[Straussian]]ism as direct public action can be peeled apart from textual interpretation to some non-trivial [[dok]]. 
*** I am not safe in how I speak at all, and I still hold out hope for the possibility that our species can be [[good]]. I do not agree to "noble lies" from the top-down, but I do from the bottom-up. There are cases where you are permitted (perhaps obligated) to lie to those in power, but not the other way around. 
*** I agree that we have a duty to clarify ourselves to those who do not understand. You may not speak in tongues without an interpreter. I do infantilize the public to some extent; I don't expect that average person to do things beyond their capacities, but I also have a very high standard of what I think they are capable of achieving with what they've got (most people consider me insane in this respect, denying the possibility that people can be as wise I think they can). I don't know what to say: I'm a true believer in the possibility of a successful democracy, warts and all. I'm as elitist as it gets (look at this wiki, rofl), but I'm opposed to a method in which those who rule aren't fundamentally the result of all of us. [[The Original Position]] is the only heuristic for building the fitting philosopher king.
** https://aeon.co/essays/bring-back-science-and-philosophy-as-natural-philosophy
*** I don't know if philosophy is in decline so much as capitalism harnesses the instrumentality of nominalist scientific practices and defends itself against thinking about [[The End]] beyond its own emergent will to power.
*** This breaking away is wrong-headed to me. Every discipline began in philosophy, and every discipline is still connected to philosophy deep down (even if those practitioners are horrified by the thought). This Critical Fundamentalism doesn't look any different from what I've always understood philosophy to be by and large.
*** "Evidence cannot verify a theory. It cannot even select a theory â€“ since infinitely many disunified rivals will always fit the available evidence equally well, or even better." 
**** A fascinating claim. Let us say it is not sufficient. I agree that scientists have to recognize the faith necessary to solve the problem of induction. This is often my problem with Bayesians, despite it sitting right in front of them.
*** I am, of course, a whore in church as a Platonist. That's why these moves are "duh doy" obvious to me, but I bite the full enchilada bullet of metaphysics.

*** Agreed on many counts, and I wonder if the conclusion isn't essentially Marxist. I deny IP though.
** https://philpapers.org/archive/SMATCE-2.pdf
*** Lots of good moves, but nothing particularly new. I think it is just an extension (though a radical one) in [[The Great Human Conversation]] even if it blurs the lines between the communication of memes and other causal forces.
*** I'd like to know how they might reason about my wiki as this integration.
** https://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/
*** Actually cool story, bro. Of course, without [[The End]], the means don't mean anything either. I don't think you meaningfully escape absolute nihilism.
** https://www.academia.edu/24290513/Marx_with_Kant_on_Exploitation
*** Hohfeld is the only way to explain the complexities and [[dok]] of self-ownership and collective ownership of each other. 
*** I wish someone handed me this article long ago. I don't think Kant just hands a crucial analytical tool here, I think he provides the metaethical foundation which Marx doesn't at all.
** http://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/can-we-revive-empathy-in-our-selfish-world
*** You mean: live your life with poor people and those in need, right? That's what will help your realize your empathy most effectively.  How are you going to get those in power to empathize [[irwartfrr]]. People in gated communities specifically aim not to have to think about it. Out of sight, out of mind. Capitalism and the many logistical layers and bureaucratic middlemen prevent those in power from having to empathize correctly. Note, of course, sociopaths are extremely skilled empathizers, and that's what allows them to spin their egoistic narrative without too many cracks and actually thinking about what is objectively [[right]]. It's not just increasing the amount of empathy, it's about making sure people don't turn it off when it's convenient. This is a choice. Otherwise, it is war.
