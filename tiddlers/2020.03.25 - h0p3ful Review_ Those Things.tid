*[[2020.03.24 - YTDL]]
** Yeah, those things.
*[[2020/03/24 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: Perhaps It Would]]
** There are some deep points in here. I think we can prove sections which we haven't named (how else do we discover them?). There are limits to what can be proven in our languages though. 
** Finiteness?
** You aren't mad, love. It's going to take a while to speak with both rationalists and empiricists.
*[[2020.03.24 - h0p3ful Review: Pomodoro]]
** Second Foundation came up again for us. There's more to story I'd like to be able to talk about with you.
*[[2020/03/24 -- Prompted Introspection: Laughter]]
** I prize the fact that you laugh so much. Sometimes, I feel like I've done an okay job on that front as a dad.
*** laughing at me, ofc.
** Circular breathing techniques would not work, sadly.
*[[2020/03/24 -- Life Log]]
** LOL! =)
** It's easy to miss triggers in [[magic]]. One day, you will get tired of losing and apply the rules to your advantage. Until then, I'm going to giggle as we play while you paranoically give up on trying to find what is causing me to giggle like a caveman. 
*[[2020/03/24 -- Wiki Log]]
** I'm adoring your presentations.
** I agree that planning ahead, even just about the next day, will go a long way for you.
*** I'm a terrifically awful rolemodel.
** It may be worth mulling it around until you know what words to use.
** We will plead the insanities together.
** I would adore having sections of our wiki synced together.
*** We have to agree on naming conventions, and we'd need to build around sharing these objects with each other. 
**** tags: "synced" "j3d1h" "1uxb0x" "h0p3" 
***** Parse for it and bi-directional (with the gotcha) rsync the files over it a synced directory.
****** Jed would have a better way, I am sure. 
***** It might be weak and awful, but it would be a good start
**** There's no way to cleanly sandbox it, from what I've seen.
** Keep notes on the characters at the very least. They don't have to be well-developed. Maybe 1 in 10 will be useful to you. I don't know.
** ityou are, indeed
** I'm glad you are enjoying Fluxx. I'd like to see how you think about it.
** I don't see a problem with a cutesy style. Maybe it's good to be able to do lots of styles.
*[[2020/03/24 -- To-Do List Log]]
** specifics
*** wat papers
*** Yeah, nightly needs to be pushed. Perhaps more.
** I have some other [[TDL]] considerations:
*** Zoom and perhaps two machines for speaking with your teacher. 
**** Take my camera/mic if you want. Perhaps you want to be able to clearly show him your art in a separate way?
**** If you don't set it up, then the meeting won't happen. You can do it. It's up to you.
*** Just do Manjaro (or anything). Get something up and running. 2GB vs 16 GB, HDD vs SSD, resolution, keyboard, and no longer having a hole in your infrastructure the size of Texas.
**** Own your laptop, madame.
*** [[DeathOfRobinhood]] has a list to explore.
**** You might even, *gasp*, reach out to him. =) 
***** He can see inside you better than I can in some crucial respects. I think you would get along well. I don't understand why you wouldn't. Up to you, ofc.
*** Your room needs a tidying up.
*** You have to make a list of art supplies (and you can have them ready to present, if you need)
** If drawing is something you want to do everyday, then put it in your daily template. If you know what you want to draw, put it in your yTDL.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** It's been a while since we've made a chocolate cake.
*** I hope to be your sous chef/helper.
** I remember having undercooked that cornbread, btw. Neato.
