Hey! =)
FRI 6:30 PM
Yeah, it's going well enough.
FRI 6:31 PM
Haven't tried the new internet; not sure if it's up yet.
FRI 6:31 PM
Good to hear
FRI 6:31 PM
How about you guys?
FRI 6:31 PM
Yea we haven’t either
FRI 6:31 PM
Doing good helping Matt look for a new gig I had to pull him from where he was because they wanted him working 7 days a week
FRI 6:32 PM
That is absurd
FRI 6:32 PM
Not worth his health
FRI 6:32 PM
No doubt.
FRI 6:32 PM
Yup
FRI 6:32 PM
He kinda upset with me but
FRI 6:32 PM
I'm glad he has such a good sister in you.
FRI 6:32 PM
:pensive:
FRI 6:32 PM
I really am trying. And I know he likes having his own income and being able to help but I don’t need him having money over seizures. He’s been flat out exhausted
FRI 6:33 PM
I can take care of us until He finds a position that will accommodate him
FRI 6:33 PM
Makes sense  to me.
FRI 6:34 PM
Did you ever find a new gig?
FRI 6:34 PM
I'm still applying to jobs.
FRI 6:34 PM
Where have you been looking if you don’t mind me asking?
FRI 6:35 PM
Lots of calls and an interview, but I've run into a lot of MLM and temp work.
FRI 6:35 PM
Online, I use a bunch of sites. Ziprecruiter quite a bit.
FRI 6:35 PM
Once in a while I'll hear from a friend about a job, and I'll apply that way.
FRI 6:36 PM
Got ya
FRI 6:38 PM
I’m guessing you aren’t a fan of MLM’s
FRI 6:38 PM
Nope. I consider it exploitative, and temp work as well unless it is paying a significant premium for contracting (which isn't what they do).
FRI 6:39 PM
Gotcha
