title: 2017.09.27 -- Prompted Introspection Log

!! Respond to the following:

<<<
All great truths begin as blasphemies.

--George Bernard Shaw
<<<

Classic quote.

"All" is overgeneralizing, but it needs the emphasis.

"great" means something like very different, significant to the context, etc.

"truths" mean propositions

"begin" requires the specific cultural/timeslice context

"blasphemies" just meaning difficult to accept, with a wide range of implications and consequences for those who take these propositions to be true or even defensible

Admittedly, some of the most influential and significant propositions in my life required great sacrifice on my part to acquire, socially as well.

I'm sure many of us feel this way.
