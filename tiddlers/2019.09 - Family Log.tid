* Rofl. I'm honored to be featured sleeping through this, to see they carried on without me. When I am gone, I hope they continue.
* I can't say the new question is worthy, but I am grateful we are trying things out here.
** Should we identify something important about our interactions, what it means for us and our relationship, etc.?
** Our online relationships matter to us. I adore it.
* We are stretched thin in many respects.
* My children lay into me. It's hilarious. =)
* Brownies have just been sitting there. 
* I like thinking about my wife's Sundayschool class with her, but I obviously should not participate. I'm a [[monster]].
* Some of my public children find it odd that I call them my children too.
* I like how this is a loosey-goosey skeleton, it's not too cereal, and it's not the focus of the day.
