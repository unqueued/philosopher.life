title: 2018.04.24 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Examples of Prejudice

!! What are some examples of prejudice?

A standard definition of prejudice:

<<<
preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience.
<<<

So, innate reasons? Do I have control over those? Clearly, this is not meant to be a technical definition.

Prejudice has negative connotations, and it is generally only used when someone has a bias or perspective that we find unjustified, discriminatory in a harmful way, and generally having to do with misconceiving morally arbitrary characteristics or salient features of a context. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I can effectively tease it apart from bad epistemology in general.

Basically, I think this question is a way for me to point out what I consider to be unjustified epistemic positions. Great. I have no idea where to begin because that list is really fucking long.

Because I'm pressed for time, I'll give the classic example as I grew up with: the notion that melanin levels in one's skin makes one inferior.
