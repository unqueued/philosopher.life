!! "Ought Implies Can" + "Is/Ought Fallacy" + The Redpill: Go!

If we are all fundamentally driven by selfishness, can we be anything besides fundamentally selfish? Perhaps there are different dimensions to selfishness, with layers, degrees, and kinds that must be considered. Molecular altruism may be the result of the right kind of atomic egoistic motivational principles, but what emerges is still a good thing, right? Sure, it is tainted, that it isn't true or pure altruism, but that doesn't mean it is somehow just as bad as something like Libertarian moral motivational molecules which emerge from atomic egoism structures. 

As self-programmers, as a newly-formed compatibilist,<<ref "2018.11.30">> I think we shape ourselves. The beginnings are determined, but a kind of molecular autonomy emerges from that atomic determinism.<<ref "1">> It's "magic," I know. It is a kind of faith worth taking up. Perhaps the egoism problem is similar. We could "faith" it out. 

We can't be held accountable for being atomically selfish. We can't be otherwise than what we are. Can we be otherwise at the molecular level? There does seem to be enormous variation in what molecules can emerge and evolve from these atomic egoistic structures. We seem to be able to give shape to these molecules over time. That seems to be the necessary "can" for an "ought," right?

Of course, just because we are selfish doesn't mean we ought to be. I do not understand ought in deterministic worlds very well. I think the answer looks more like: "it is what it is" and "ought" is asking for something outside of that. If this is correct, then just do as you like. I want to feel moral, so I will.
