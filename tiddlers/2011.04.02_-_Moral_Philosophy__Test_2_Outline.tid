title: 2011.04.02 - Moral Philosophy: Test 2 Outline

```
1. In Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle claims that human agents themselves are responsible for the character they have acquired. 

(a) Write a comprehensive essay that details the arguments that Aristotle gives in support of that claim. 
(b) Provide one insightful objection – be sure to substantially justify it – to show that Aristotle’s claim, as a general claim, is not true. 
(c) Then, defend Aristotle, by appealing to specific parts of Aristotle’s theory, against your objection.

(a)

    Fundamental argument (1113b3–21)

        Pakaluk’s Outline (Pakaluk 144-145)

            Any action involving wish, deliberation, and choice is up to us.

            Virtuous actions are like that.

            Thus, virtuous actions are up to us.

            But if virtuous actions are up to us, so is being virtuous.

            Thus, being virtuous (that is, having a virtue) is up to us. (1113b3–14)

            But there is parity between virtue and vice.

            Thus, being vicious is up to us.

            Thus, what character we have is up to us. (1113b6–14)

        We are responsible for whether we are virtuous or not, for virtues (and vices) find their expression in our voluntary actions.

    Confirming argument (1113b21–1114a13)

        Pakaluk’s Outline (Pakaluk 146)

            It is a presupposition of punishment that what gets punished is up to the agent.

            But people in authority punish character traits as well as actions.

            Thus people in authority presuppose that character traits are up to us.

            Hence, character traits are up to us.

        Nature of Man is Political Assumption

    Diagnosis of why people are attracted to the false view (1114a13–31)

        Incorrectly applying criterion for action to character

        ‘Up to us’

        One might object that people should not be held responsible for their voluntary actions because being negligent or evil may be part of their character. But that is no excuse; a person is responsible, Aristotle holds, for his or her character as well as for the particular actions to which the character gives rise. This is because a person's character is the result of his or her voluntary actions.

    Afterthought (1114a31–b25)

        Refutation of side-criticism that we aren’t responsible for our actions because everyone aims at what appears good, but they don’t have control over how it appears. (1114a 31)

        Desert of praise and blame judges between [Character causing the appearance of ends] and [Appeance of ends causing character]

(b) and (c) can have a lot of answers

3. (a) After carefully explaining the necessary background to the heart of the distinction between Selection and Collection in Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, explain in considerable detail two particularly significant problems that Aristotle’s theory faces. Of those two problems one must be what was labeled in the lectures as the Teresa/Hawking Problem. Be sure to justify your answer by appealing to Pakaluk’s Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, and the class lectures. (b) Provide an interpretation of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics that most plausibly responds to those two significant problems.

(a)

    Selection vs. Collection Issue

        Criteria of Human Good

            Complete/Ultimacy (1097a25–34)

                Sought for its own sake, but never for sake of something else; points toward Selection

                Teleion interpretation as ‘complete’ points toward Collection

            Self-sufficiency (1097b6–16)

                “notions of rest and absence of further dependence” (Pakaluk 71)

                Selection seems to strongly show a lack of dependency or need for a combination of things.

                “only the sum total of all goods, as possessed over a lifetime, could constitute a good that was strictly self-sufficient” as an argument for Collection (Pakaluk 72)

            Preferability (1097b16–20)

                “counting alongside other goods” clause and Aristotle’s Philebus criticism favors Selection (Pakaluk 73)

                Collection interpretations collapse Preferability into Self-Sufficiency (Pakaluk 74)

    Two problems

        Teresa/Hawking Problem

            It would appear that Mother Teresa has the proper character-related virtues, but lacks the thinking related virtues. And, Hawking appears to have the latter but not the former. Aristotle applauds what Hawking does in cosmology, but does that mean Aristotle won't applaud Mother Teresa because she isn’t a cosmologist? And, does Hawking's lack of character-related virtue mean demonstrate he isn't a good human either?

        Problem #2

            Selection and Collection have very different answers for the question: “what is best for a human?”

            If it requires a combination of character and highest activity (reason), then it seems like the collection view is what we seek.

            If the ultimate goal is the highest activity (reason), then it seems selection. Virtue isn't an end in itself though, it doesn't seem self-sufficient.

            My worry, then, is that either character or reason aren’t significant enough, either contradicting my own intuitions or contradicting an interpretation of Aristotle’s worldview at large.

(b) Given Aristotle’s other famous works, e.g. Metaphysics, when paired with his essentialist and teleological world views, seems to overwhelmingly favor ‘reason’ and the selection interpretation. I think this is hermeneutically plausible, but it isn’t satisfying.
