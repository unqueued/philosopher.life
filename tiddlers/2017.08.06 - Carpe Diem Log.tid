title: 2017.08.06 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up early.
* Played league, did some reading.
* Double Fireman Time!
* Worked on my phone quite a bit.
* Went shopping for long sleeves and groceries. 
* Organized my tools and got the car set.
* Inform the Men!
* Made ribs and fries for dinner; they were amazing.
* Family time went by very quickly today. 
** We pointed out that even a single day of my writing encompasses as much as everyone else combined for the week. 
** It's become more about reading my wiki. That's fine. I hope they'll eventually see what I'm looking for.
* Watching TSM vs. CLG. 
* Gonna finish getting ready and head to bed. I have to wake up early.
