title: 2020.01.31 - Prompted Introspection: Stahp Coughing

!! I wish I didn't have to.....

Cough anymore, and sit-lay at 45-degree angle or higher. I want to sleep on my belly so badly, with abandon. I'm okay being dazed and chill, and blowing my nose is not a problem. I need to be able to use my voice, have sex, and sleep without it being difficult. Hopefully, with a vehicle and insurance, I'll be able to start the process and hunting for the correct medication. I'm hoping we can find something for my wife as well, since it is clear that her anxiety-sleep meds have been crucial (but they can only be safely used short-term). We need to find a substitute.
