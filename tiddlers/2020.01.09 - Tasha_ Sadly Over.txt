Might be a reaction to something in the apartment. I don't know. But, can't sleep, pulling muscles while coughing, and it's pretty miserable. It's okay though. I'm not under any pressure, so it's okay to be sick, lol.

Oh no I’m sorry to hear that! Is anyone else feeling sick
Jan 12 5:23pm
No, thankfully!
