!! Audit:

* I did not hold back. I was honest, and I was contemptuous where applicable.
* I've got meat on 'dem bones this month.
* I still have plenty of grammar errors. Editing some.
* I am very angry in many of these posts, but I can't say I'm wrong.
* I'm pleased about my gratefulness and pursuit of hope.
* I'm growing to be more accepting, if not quietist, about the fact that I can't explain [[The Good]]. Not ineffable by definition, but impractical and outside my control. This is a wise move.
* I begrudingly admit that I am glad to have some happy posts. I'm generally very negative, so this is a good opportunity for me.
* Lots of thinking about my past. Those are some of the more difficult questions to answer, imho.
* I literally laugh out loud to some of the answers today.
* As usual, I love talking to myself in this log. I'm very grateful that I write it.
* I am tired of trying to answer [[The Good]] question.
** Though, not always. There are some exceptions.
