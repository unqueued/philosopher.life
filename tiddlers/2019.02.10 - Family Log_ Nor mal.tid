<<footnotes "2020.02.10-1" "//Normal// being a running joke at this point. I can never get them to be descriptive enough. It's especially important for my son to develop this awareness. It's easy for an autist to completely fail to develop it.">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.10-2" "My wife and I were thinking about the differences between work at Yale and Milligan. We both happened to be looking at our past posts today, and her flu was something that struck us both. We talked for a while about it, especially since EBR wasn't as exploitative, in a way, as Milligan. She still had to do her job from home while sick at Milligan. That's nuts.">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.11-3" "That's something I miss in his work. I'd like to see that come back.">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.11-4" "Ha, I think this is always true for me these days. =)">>
