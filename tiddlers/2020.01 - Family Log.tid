!! Audit:

* This has been a month of transitions. Lawdy.
* Feels like we woke from a {[[dream]]} on vacation and raced back to reality. 
** The transition could have gone much worse.
*** Doesn't seem my offspring regressed much either, though our habits are caput. 
* I'm grateful that my offspring pulled more of their weight this go around. Being sick made it necessary for them to step up in others.
* I've not been doing much socializing offline.
* My son has been struggling the most during our [[Family Time]]s since the move.
** His ability to focus is worse.
* My wife's irritability is higher than normal, or so it feels. 
** Her feelings about work: it's getting crazier. Although, upon inspection, I don't think it is. Her feeling of it is though, and that merits inspection.
* That's how you know I'm sick: I have turned out sex, walks, dates, food, masturbation, and speaking muh homies. The worst is over, I believe, and thankfully so! =)
* We are getting back into a groove. 
** It's unsettling that we probably have to move again here in 11 months, but at least it won't be as difficult.
*** I don't like that feeling that I'm putting up a tent for such a short time in the desert. That's okay.
