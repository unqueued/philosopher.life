title: Shiggles Prep

//For the minimizing-Bayesian-regret shits and giggles, yet again, of course...//

* Seeds
** Storage, kit, reading
** [[Regrowing Plants]]
* Filtration
* Minimal solar for single laptop.
** Our own repo. Back to the old days.
** Library
*** e-Reader. Pick'em.
* Pure storage pantry; 3-month cut-off
** Have had 3-months of rice and beans a long time.
** Hard to store fruits and veggies...but, that seems the hardest problem.
*** We did this a decade ago, and some of our cans didn't get used. That's okay.
