title: 2018.10.14 - Guitar: Chill

Just going to play when I enjoy (which doesn't mean I won't experience pain here). I'm still here to practice for excellence, but I'm not going to push myself too hard.

I would like to actually memorize the music. I've not done that in a very long time.

Played more with my son. That was fun. We tried Bach's //Minuet in G Major//. My son has a lot of chords to learn, but he can if he wants to.
