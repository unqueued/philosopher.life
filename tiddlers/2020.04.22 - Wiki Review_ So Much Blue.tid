title: 2020.04.22 - Wiki Review: So Much Blue

* [[2020.04.21 - AretEterA: Thanks for the h0p3]]
** I am surprised to hear from a stranger. It's pretty darn uncommon.
* [[AretEterA]]
** Feels like someone is speaking my language in their [[naming]]. 
** They built a new account to speak with me. Neat.
* [[Links: CV19]]
** Should have done with quite a while ago. Better late than never.
* [[2020.04.21 - Wiki Review: Those in power-over the US have dark-triadically defected against Gradualized T42T in failing to openly accept the profound compromise of Sanders. A fundamental turn in the material dialectical game for the sake of The Proletariat may reasonably be now or nigh.]]
** This is becoming a [[/b/]]ish practice. Spillover. Peepholes. Abstracts.
*** It continues to be an experiment, as my daughter notes.
*** I get to continue the conversation here if I want too. =)
** This isn't the first defect, but it's so obvious, that it's yet another clear indicator of the people I meet. 
** I tell ya, if I were an egoistic billionaire, I'd be abusing QE, buybacks, and any loans I could get to invest in classic hyperinflation commodities and real estate; I'd thrive in that chaos...it's pure opportunity. Just like the last housing bubble got swallowed, this too is what I think will occur. 
*** Reminds me of how Joseph used the grains bought from land-owners to then buy the land with their own product during famine, unifying Pharoah's rule. 
**** [[ITS]], we never fucking learn, do we?
* [[2020.04.21 - Prompted Introspection: Shivved]]
** Completed. Usually, I'm right about Samwise. Not this time.
* [[2020.04.21 - TDL: Monopoly, oligarchy, or kleptocracy are the inevitable results of capitalism. Only capitalists and reactionaries would aim to redefine capitalism as the decentralization of power.]]
** Absolute evil coming out of media. "This isn't real capitalism." =D. LMAO. Anyone who thinks they can peel apart economics from politics is purposely trying to fuck you in the ass, rhetorically and otherwise.
* [[2020.04.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Ribcage Prevents Me From Achieving Greatness]]
** Completed. You been groggy a lot lately, homie. And, you have had a constant headache in the same place for 3 days. That's not normal (well, the sleep problem is, but you know what I mean).
* [[2020.04.21 - h0p3ful Review: dokie okie heartbeet dwigt]]
** In a way, she writes it with me. I have no idea how to describe the experience well enough.
** I think my daughter understands many internet cultures so much better than I do. It's delightful.
* [[2020.04.21 â€“ h0p3ful Review: b i m c h]]
** I am pleased that my [[h0p3ful Review]]s tend to be richer and more playful than my own [[Wiki Review]].
