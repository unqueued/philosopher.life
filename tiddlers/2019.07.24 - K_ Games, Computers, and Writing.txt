One of the things I liked about FFXIV was that you could build one character and play all the classes. There's a private WoW server (https://project-ascension.com/) which allows one to literally play as all the classes at once. Roughly, every 2 levels you pick an ability from any class, and skill trees have no prereq's beyond levels (spending a level currency).

It's like playing Magic, but with an MMORPG.

Holy shit. That’s super cool.

You can't "rebuild" some of the classes which have too many abilities, but it's got some neat theorycrafting. Also, there are different kinds of servers. One of them just randomly assigns you abilities and you make the best of it (somewhat like drafting in Magic), and a full-blown EQ-style PvP server where you lose gear when you die to others. Supercool.

Yo this tool looks super cool. Thank you!
THU 9:58 AM
Np. I will keep hunting for more tools for writing. I don't know enough about how to make fiction, but that one seemed really different to me.
THU 9:59 AM
Thank you! I’ll check it out formally after my session. I like the tree layout for chapters and the like
