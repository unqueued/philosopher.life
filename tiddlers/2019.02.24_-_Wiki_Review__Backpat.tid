* //Tentpeg Icons, Archetypes, and Mythology//
** Perhaps I will be able to extract something out of Jung here. I need metaphor, symbols, and pointing. There's no way around it.

** Edited.
** This log does a fuckton of work. I wish I had been doing it all along.

** Wrong name. I don't know what to call it.<<ref "2020.02.26">>

** And a good day to you, Kevin! Thank you for the response. I think you are right.
* [[2019.02.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Saturday]]

** It was a productive day.

** I regret these failures. They shouldn't be happening.
* [[2019.02.23 - TDL: My Family]]
** Oh yeah, we did taxes.
* [[2019.02.22 - TDL: Tax]]
