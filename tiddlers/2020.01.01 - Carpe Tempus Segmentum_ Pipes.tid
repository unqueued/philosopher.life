title: 2020.01.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Pipes

* Woke at 9:30
* Cleaned up the cabin, packed up
** [[m16]] is packed. Poor creature. Gently wrapped and safe, but it feels so weird for her to be asleep. See you soon!
* Word all my stories so badly nobody wants to hear them.
* Hug people, especially until it's awkward. 
** I'm glad I get to be the retarded cousin/nephew/dad/husband bear. Like, you get a really long hug from me (and a kiss on the cheek if I think you can afford my bad breath), and you don't freak out that I'm drooling or babbling because that's just who this clutching fool is.
** I take seriously the possibility it is my last hug more often than most, I would argue.
* Traveled home. 
** My offspring have been so fortunate, as they tell me, that not only did they have no chores, almost no requirements on them, but they somehow avoided lectures...(minus a couple). Lots of reflection on the trip. No time for music.
* Cleaning
** Everything was going well, almost done even, until I attempted to disconnect the water connections to the washer. I did my best to tighten the valves by hand, but water still trickled. Unfortunately, the real problem was that in tighening, the pipe within the walls was broken. Water started raining down, out the outlets, the smoke alarm, the fan, the lights, etc. I couldn't turn off the main, and I didn't have any tools. Luckily, maintenance came fast to help.
*** I'm so glad we had packed the computers because that pipe burst would have destroyed our machines. 
*** Matthew was kind enough to move these out with me.
*** We spent a ton of time cleaning up the water mess, and sadly, we had no water to do anything (including clean).
** My wife has promised to smack me every time I utter the Indiana-Jones-esque words "What's the worst that could happen?" (it's only going to be hawt when she does though).
* Two sets of folks I thought I'd be seeing were sick. =(
** Everyone is being overtaken. None of these people can afford time off from work either (not that their bosses would let them). =/
* Burgers, fries, orange-vanilla coke (I've had so much soda this past week, completely unlike me)
* Found my daughter skipping to music in the middle of the night.
* Downloaded some books
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 1:30?
** Floor sucks.
