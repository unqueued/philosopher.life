title: 2019.05.07 - Afterschool Teaching: Miscarriage

I came in right after Whitney, and when I asked her how her day was going there was about 2 seconds where it went from maybe just a rough day to wipe out break down. Even my phenomenology slowed down in heightened emergency reaction as our awareness oscillated-chained in escalation of sadness and concern in confronting horror. I held her until she stopped crying (trying to hold it together myself as it lept out of her into me), and then she told me she believes her sister had a miscarriage. Mind you, she showed me the vid of her screaming in joy at the news of finding out she'll be an aunt, and so her loss was huge. Her sister hasn't even been able to tell her yet either (unspeakable loss), but she knows from her encounters last night and from calling the mother-in-law this morning. The tests look bad. 

I think I'm like that 30 Rock "there, there" broomstick fucktard. I have no idea how to be of use to her besides hold her, listen, and tell her I'm sorry. 

She wanted to process it more, and my stomach turned inside out as I was required to tell the truth of what I've seen and my predictions. We talked about how it was probably going to get darker. I'm in favor of taking human life in some contexts, and I don't consider all humans persons, but of course, I could not imagine the loss of my own children. I'm already fucking losing it writing this sentence in the computer lab, choking back the tears. 

I am surprised she showed up, but she needs money. She can't handle the kids today, and so I sent her off to the library. I took everyone to the lab.

5CM did get in trouble, grounded until the semester. Poor kid. He was feeling better though. I love hanging with that side of the cafeteria too. 

My namesake constantly needs my attention. I like Olympic gymnastics for about 20 minutes, but I think it's a bit much to hand her my attention for every specialized cartwheel. Alright, alright, good job, etc.

Mitchell says he is done with 5NP. He has said this before, and then he came back to try again. 5NP has had more than his fair share of chances even given his context. I'm okay with this.

Delp was pissed off that I helped two students retrieve items from classrooms. Only he and the janitor are allowed to do that, rofl. He was also unhappy that 2 empty bottles were left in the library. Mitchell might be the only sane one.

I talked with 8Gf about social media, privacy, anonymity, authenticity, virtue signaling, and some social dynamics she was experiencing. I actually think I was bugging her. Ugh.

I spoke with the 5th and 6th graders about Clicker Heroes. At least a few years ago, I had the best bot available for that game. It was stupid how I built it too, but it worked. One of the differences is that I play my clickers in VM. We didn't talk about that, but I talked about the saved game file, the general structure of the game, and AHK (I won't tell them not to install it, but I can't tell them they are allowed to do it). 

Delp stopped by to give me an evaluation sheet which required self-eval. I was wrong. He didn't do it.

State stopped in. The inspection was absurdly brief. Cool. It was interesting to see how the kids all knew they were supposed to be on good behavior and put on a show. They have been trained to pass these inspections. They said they have to do the same in regular school hours too. 

I talked with some kids, and the day ended smoothly.
