I must ensure that I do not create children who hate themselves. How do I do that? How do I at the same create children who are honest about their faults, deeply searching, and yet also calm and accepting, joyful even about what is good?

To my donors:

You think we lack grace and civility. You have the gall to expect us to forgive you for setting us on fire, while we are burning alive. Don't get me wrong, I'm responsible for my mistakes, but so are you, creators (far more than you will ever admit to yourselves). We are STILL paying for your enormous mistakes, of which I finally see the reasons for. You don't seek to restore your victim, you seek to feel better about yourselves. If you aren't going to help or change, the least amount of actual love you could act upon would be leaving us alone. We're in enough pain as it is.

If we ever do to get a point where we might begin talking again, reading this wiki is your price of admission. But, let's be practical here. You aren't the people we need in our lives, and that gap is virtually incommensurable at this point.

I hope I can move on and be happy without you.
