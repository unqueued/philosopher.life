!! Audit:

* I want to point out the giant explosion in this project over the past couple months. I'm finally fucking reading again. I love it. I need it.
* Russell's tome took a long time to read. I am slow as fuck, and I wasn't half-assing it.
* I'm done with Stephenson. I'm only going to read for summaries of his books now. Good concepts and worldbuilding, but that's it.
* I'm still on the fence about reading more in the Singularity series. It's a topic which I have plenty of intuitions about, but I've not developed a full opinion on. I think it would be worth my time. It's a topic I could become an expert on without too much effort because I have mountains of knowledge for it already.
* I'm pleased to see political and economics reading, and I'm even more pleased to see my work in [[The Good]] playing into my deep reading so clearly. Good job!
* I'm glad I spend time researching the book beforehand. I get the gist, and then after spending time actually in the book, I can discover whether or not it is actually worth my deep reading time.
** I have the bad habit of engaging in the sunk cost fallacy, and I need to regularly pull myself out of it. I should celebrate when I defeat it.
* Keep it up, homie!
