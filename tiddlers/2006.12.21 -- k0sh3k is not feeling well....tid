title: 2006.12.21 -- k0sh3k is not feeling well...

uggghh...k0sh3k has been throwing up and it has been pretty bad for a few days already. She didn't want to goto the doctor (and I don't think she'll need to), but she is getting better today. Pray for her. By the way, she also applied for the directorship(?) at the Wesley House at UofL. 60k a year, but I don't know if that includes a &quot;parsonage&quot; or some shit. I have no idea.

As for me...I'm doing well. Christmas has been busy, and we've chosen to use a Nativity set in place of a tree...after all this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;mas. Work has been slow and boring. Who cares? You do what you have to do. I stole dad's WoW account (buy you a new one dad, I can upload the entire WoW directory to my site and let you download it, and I'll grab you a CD-key if you need) because Blizz is retarded and banned me for &quot;3rd party software.&quot; Tough. Took me 3 weeks to bot to level 50, and I'll be hitting 60 this week (before X-mas) I hope. HWL gear is now grindable at a VERY reasonable level (and if I say it is reasonable, then it is broken). Pfft, I'll be encoding more PvP vids for no one in paricular I'm sure. But, hell, it is fun.

We are gonna have A & J Gipso----oh, snap..I mean, &lt;em&gt;L &lt;/em&gt;for dinner on Sunday (after all, it isn't like I'd let my child even walk into their house)...which btw, j3d1h is walking somewhat....

For any family reading this: we got a great present for you (especially for those overseas), and it cost me a pretty penny. I'm a cheapskate, so 100$ makes me cringe like no other. But, I was convinced by a greater power than myself ('teh wifey').

South park is on! GTG (Gotta go)!!
