title: 2012.11.06 -- Epistemology: The Meno Problem

The claim, “knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief,” does appear to be a problem for an oversimplistic and naïve reliabilism.



I thought the most charitable way to consider Zagzebski’s argument (although, she may not have been pursuing this line of reasoning) was to consider this “value problem” as reasonable attack on simplistic and naïve reliabilist theories. If knowledge is merely true belief which was generated by just any arbitrary yet sufficiently reliable method, then it isn’t clear why we should think that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief.

A very simplistic reliabilism might only be concerned with reliably producing true beliefs, and unconcerned with how those beliefs were generated. If that black box which reliably produces true beliefs, thus knowledge on this naïve view, can be just any arbitrary method, it seems as if the output is also somehow arbitrary (in some sense) and lacking the significance we normally want to attach to knowledge. On this intuition, it isn’t clear how naïve reliabilist knowledge is anything more (or more valuable) than mere true belief.

This kind of naïve reliabilism may be said to lack the ability to justify a true belief. It isn’t so clear, however, that reliability isn’t a necessary aspect of the effective method of justifying true belief in the generation of knowledge. Perhaps a more robust and complex theory of reliabilism could handle this “value problem.” Maybe reliability and some other important features of the method (making the method non-arbitrary) could avoid the “value problem.”





and there seem to be many possible instances in which one is reliably generating true beliefs that don’t seem to be the kind of processes we would intuitively think to be capable of generating knowledge,



not against reliabilism as being
