My brother has the integrity to say he wasn't interested in hearing or talking about the wiki (later correcting it to "right now"), and said he didn't want to be introspective. I gave him a gentle but quick run down on the [[Wiki Litmus Test]], essentially. It is part of empathizing with others that we take interest in their projects. I suppose I must be a polarizing figure in that I am fairly exclusively interested in being philosophical, introspective, and comtemplative. Does that make me a poor empathizer? Yes, in a powerful way, I do not take the project of choosing to not be philosophical to be one I can agree to. This may sound narcissistic in a sense. I apologize. I think I'm right, and unfortunately, the only way to really talk about it is to go down that path.
