title: 2017.05.19 -- Realpolitik Speculation: Trump's Hypocritically Prophetic Tweets & Quotes

// The phrases "like shooting fish in a barrel" and "takes one to know one" have never been so painfully apt. His prescient ability to perpetually 4D-Chess checkmate himself is hyperreal.//

!!Tweets from @realDonaldTrump 

<<<
Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence? 

6:23 AM - 4 Jun 2014
<<<

I suppose this one is obvious.

<<<
Fact--Obama does not read his intelligence briefings nor does he get briefed in person by the CIA or DOD. Too busy I guess!

4:15 PM - 30 Sep 2014
<<<

 Trump is famous for not scheduling intelligence briefings (for several overdetermined reasons, it appears) or reading intelligence reports. 

<<<
Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!

7:12 AM - 6 Jul 2016
<<<

Surely Trump would not directly provide classified information to Russians or business interests. Trump's administration haven't been leaking sensitive and damning information from the beginning of his presidency either, right?

<<<
Just as I predicted, @BarackObama has not allowed an independent investigation into the national security leaks from his cabinet.

4:24 PM - 27 Jul 2012
<<<

The stupid, it burns. I'm sure Trump hasn't pushed back against investigations into his connections with Russia, nevermind independent investigations. Of course, the RNC in general are completely hypocritical in this respect as well. Oh, fuck me, the DNC is too regarding their strongarming of Sanders (what a shit show).

<<<
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets. Why can't he release his records? Especially when $5M is going to charity.

5:44 PM - 24 Oct 2012
<<<

There is so much wrong with this, I don't even know where to begin. 

* Trump leaks national security secrets on the reg.
* Trump has never released his own tax records, except for one carefully crafted to import his wife.
* Trump has never donated his own money; he only redistributes money donated from others through his "charity."
* While Obama deserves some serious hate, Trump's criticisms are not justified. He's playing a PR game, and that's all.

He's shameless.

<<<
If I win-I am going to instruct my AG to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation bc there's never been anything like your lies.

9:27 PM - 9 Oct 2016
<<<

Jesus H. Buttfucking Christ. It's like he's talking about himself and what he deserves. It's uncanny.

<<<
The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security "leakers" that have permeated our government for a long time. They can't even......

7:31 AM - 24 Feb 2017
<<<

Let's hope he's wrong. He's right in that they haven't been able to stop him, at least not yet. It's scary to see that he means leaks in his own administration here.

“We build too many walls and not enough bridges.” - Isaac Newton

4:11 PM - 7 Oct 2013
<<<

But, don't we want to keep all the Mexicans out of our country? Maybe he could get them to pay for both a Wall and a Bridge, lol.

<<<
Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?

7:49 PM - 4 Sep 2016
<<<

Fish in a barrel.

<<<
The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American!

8:13 AM - 15 Feb 2017
<<<

He was literally president at the time of writing that quote.

<<<
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!

6:56 AM - 21 May 2016
<<<

Says the President who has taken more vacation time in 100 days than Obama did in 8 years. He spends that vacation time golfing, using taxpayers' money to subsidize extravagant trips to his own resorts where he sells us out to wealthy people playing golf with him.

<<<
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.

5:39 PM - 9 Oct 2012
<<<

Says a president with arguably the lowest approval numbers who went on to attempt to distract the American public with an unprovoked bombing of Syria. This fucker has a finger on the button; you better not hurt his feelings, or else!

<<<
Call it any way you like, but Snowden is a traitor. When our country was great do you know what we did to traitors?

3:41 PM - 27 Jun 2013
<<<

He has several tweets about Snowden being a traitor for giving classified information to Russia. *facepalm* Trump literally gave classified information to Russia (Snowden likely didn't give it to Russia directly, but instead gave it at least respectable parties attempting to serve the global good). 

<<<
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.

11:45 PM - 6 Nov 2012
<<<

Says the man who lost the popular vote.

<<<
China, Russia and Iran are laughing at us. We have weak leaders who are threatening our national security. Dangerous times.

3:19 PM - 12 Sep 2013
<<<

Laughing and crying. Prophesy makes me wail, weep, and gnash my teeth.

<<<
Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection. They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now.

2:11 PM - 8 Nov 2012
<<<

I'm sure Russia has zero influence over Trump. They must have been devastated when their insanity candidate of choice won the POTUS election.

<<<
What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval.

2:14 PM - 29 Aug 2013
<<<

Hrmm. That's a really good question, Trump. That going to war part thing needing congressional approval seems pretty reasonable too. /wrists
