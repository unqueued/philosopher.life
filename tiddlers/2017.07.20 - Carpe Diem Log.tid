title: 2017.07.20 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up 10 minutes before the alarm. Still having a hard time sleeping all the way to my wake-up time. I'm getting 7.5 hours-ish without any serious interruptions. My sleep is good enough though.
* Pushed Bricks. 
** Love the new schedule
** Shot off messages to ALM and my wife while on the throne.
* Worked my butt off.
* I had Tendies (shitty processed nuggets, actually) with $3 of GBP. It complemented my veggies and fruit. I'm going to continue to do the dollar menu trick. Half shitty food, half good food.
** Give me my drugs!
* Came home, showered, packed.
* Talked to my brother, JRE. 
** Had a very awkward moment. We were talking about the racism we've seen at work. He started explaining something that happened and literally said "Nigger" on the speakerphone. Mind you, my landlord and housemates are black. This was more than uncomfortable, let me tell you.
*** It occupied my mind to the point I couldn't converse with him very well.
* Talked to my family.
** The kids seemed to be doing well enough.
** My son didn't want to end the conversation, and he elected to talk more with me. That made me very happy.
** My daughter made a video. Yay! 
** My wife is super exhausted. I feel really bad for her. I know this is very tough. She's doing such a good job.
* I'm writing, maybe eating some fruit, finalizing my packing, perhaps surfing, maybe watch an episode of GoT, and falling asleep.
** Night homie!
* It was a good day. It may have been difficult, but I'm happy with it. I get to go home tomorrow. I can't wait.
