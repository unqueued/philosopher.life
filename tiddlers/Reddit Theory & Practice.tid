title: Reddit Theory & Practice

!! About:

Reddit is a fundamental part of my [[Link Log: The Stack]]. It's probably the most important site I use on a daily basis. It's one of the central components of my internet dependency. I could literally live on Reddit if I had the time.

Subs come and go for me. Periodically, I take a multi-reddit snapshot. Currently, I see some categories emerging for me:

* Antipleonasmic Catholicon
* Technology, FOSS, & Decentrality
* Sociopolitical Science, Ideology, & News
* Curated Deep Narratives, Perception Refactoring, & Well-Roundedness

I test my subreddits in the most naive way at the moment. I go through each sub and think scroll through the posts (the majority of which I never click on), and pay attention to which I've seen, which I've clicked on, and guestimate a gut feeling about the relevance of what I've seen and not seen. One interesting thing I've noted is how some of these subs are most useful just for the title themselves (maybe they should just have their own separate multi-reddit?). My [[Link Log]] helps me recognize some of salience here too. I fear my greatest difficulty is pruning; I wish I could just read them all. I need to narrow it down as hard as I can.

I'm especially interested in eliminate subs when:

* the sub has lots of clicked links/threads and now I regret having spent my time looking through these. There has to be the right kind of ratio of being happy enough to have not just browsed but clicked and consumed. These waste my precious deep-reading time.
* there are no clicks in the sub for hundreds of threads (for highly active subs; the less active), watering down my overall multi-reddit signal-to-noise ratio of the Front Page.

* Improve your Reddit Theory descriptive models.
* Improve your how you engage and use Reddit given the best moral standards you can find.
* Aim for fewer than 30 subreddits, record deltas, and give your reasoning.
