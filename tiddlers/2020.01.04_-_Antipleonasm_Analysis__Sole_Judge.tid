title: 2020.01.04 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Sole Judge

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
; In propria causa nemo debet esse iudex.
: No one should be the judge in his own trial.
<<<

Obviously, insofar as we are concerned with unjustified [[power]] centralization and conflicts of interest, this is correct. However, there is something missing which I have to point out: effective judgment requires finding particularities of justice in context through [[TOP]] methodology, and that means we must, to some some [[dok]], be included in our own judgment (particularly insofar as only we can access or attend to our own subjectivity, qualia, and information revealed only to the self because of feasibility). No one should be the //sole// judge in their own trial.
