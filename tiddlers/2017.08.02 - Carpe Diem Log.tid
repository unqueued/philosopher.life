title: 2017.08.02 - Carpe Diem Log

* Alarm clock got me today. Ouch.
* Small bricks pushed.
* I worked hard.
* I talked to my children several times through the day.
** I feel like my son is completely failing to try, and my daughter seems to lack passion.
* I briefly talked to JRE, but he was still at work.
* I tried to calling AIR, but no dice. Same for Charlie, MB, and L.
* I showered. 
** I can't get that fire-retardant blanket's itchy powder off me. 
* I watched some LCS and read.
* Fireman Time!
* I ate a lot of veggies, fruits, and some crackers. I'm still hungry.
* I had a long conversation with my son. 
** It's his choice at this point. 
* I spoke briefly with my daughter.
* I spoke with my lovely wife. She keeps me sane. 
* I talked with one of my roommates again at length about pipefitting and philosophy. 
** He seemed quite unreflective, but intelligent in some respects.
* Big Bricks Pushed
* Watched Mr. Robot when Interwebs went South and fell asleep.
