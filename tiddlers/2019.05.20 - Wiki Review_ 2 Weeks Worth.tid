title: 2019.05.20 - Wiki Review: 2 Weeks Worth

* [[2019.05.19 - JRE: Laugh =)]]
** I'm surprised I had so little to say afterward. It was a good conversation.
* [[2019.05.19 - Family Log: Librarby]]
** My brother has been reading my daughter's writing as well. I'm pleased! That is a good way to get to know her. 
** Keep hunting for a job too, homie. 
** There's no job where I get to be myself. I am radically unmarketable. It feels like me vs. the world, and it's exhausting.
* [[2019.05.19 - T-Money: Jesus]]
** I doubt he will change his mind. 
* [[2019.05.06 - T-Money: Back to Work]]
** I [[love]] my children. It's hilarious to see him act like he's not questioning me on it either later when it delivers these lines. I think what angers me the most is that it's because of capitalists and reactionaries that prefer to manipulate and use others as mere means that I'm forced to construct my children so defensively for the desert. It's victim blaming.
* [[2019.05.12 - T-Money: Good Weekend]]
** I think he's back in his groove now.
* [[2019.05.17 - T-Money: Our Children]]
** Contradiction. Ugh. I cannot imagine being proud of that. He's literally constructing the enemy of my children.
* [[2019.05.12 - Tasha: Game of Tag]]
** Very minor tag. In the end, most chat ends up being like this for me.
* [[2019.05.14 - Tasha: Our Gloryhole]]
** It's interesting they cut the holes the same on both sides. 
* [[2019.05.09 - dziggetai: Cave]]
** Another day.
* [[2019.05.18 - Sphygmus: Catching Up]]
** How are you doing, btw? I don't get to catchup with you.
* [[2019.04.30 - Sphygmus: Chat Clients]]
** I grafted a bunch of lost material. I still have no idea what caused it. 
* [[2019.05.02 - Sphygmus: Rorschach]]
** I'm still surprised by how small they are with that much detail. I'm reminded of stamping tools, avatars, and icons. 
* [[2019.05.12 - Sho: Wee Man]]
** Sho and I are good animals together even if we don't speak much.
* [[2019.05.06 - K: Pretend]]
** He's not so much a reader for someone who wants to be a writer. DnD must be really different though.
* [[2019.05.07 - K: Endgame]]
** I still have no idea what happens. I must wander different places on the interwebs or not paying enough attention (probably both). 
* [[2019.05.09 - K: Taxes]]
** This would relieve me of so much stress. It makes or breaks us.
* [[2019.05.13 - K: Busy Bee]]
** I hope it's a damn good summer for him too. I assume it will only get busier.
* [[2019.05.14 - K: Trapped]]
** It's been my long-time assumption. Go for it, homie. I'm glad to have the chance to say, "you do you." UDOU.
* [[2019.05.15 - K: Allergy]]
** Hrm. I get to say how I'm feeling and what I'm worried about in the moment to him. 
* [[2019.05.18 - K: Make 'em Cry]]
** Not saying we were on the same wavelength (XD), but maybe. Lol. Admittedly, I also don't "get it." It's just not the lowest friction medium for expressing myself to myself. 
* [[2019.05.07 - JRE: No Bueno]]
** When the PPA says stop, take a hint.
* [[2019.05.09 - JRE: LSD Trip]]
** You know, it was weird because [[AIR]] claimed not to be affected by it. It was a good time, but something was also off.
* [[2019.05.12 - JRE: Mean Peen]]
** I love this exchange. 
** My daughter didn't bring her phone for some reason, so I had her use mine for our wiki work.
* [[2019.05.19 - JRE: Niece]]
** Rebecca and my brother have different perspectives on children, no doubt. I don't think my brother would be happy to have raised a daughter like his niece.
* [[2019.05.15 - Jop: Record]]
** My wife is minorly worried there is a non-trivial chance she won't come back. I'm not worried.
* [[2019.05.17 - Jop: Bored Vampire]]
** Well, it is important that I can be useful to her. Her psychopathic husband barely listens to her.
* [[2019.04.29 - AA: Le New Phone]]
** We have completely different priorities on what our offspring should consume and participate in. 
* [[2019.04.30 - AA: Dentist Torture]]
** I prefer math too. It's interesting to see her shift away from chemistry.
* [[2019.05.01 - AA: Accepted]]
** Interestingly timed on Uncle John. I have unpleasant things to say about the world and who we are. Much easier to shoot the messenger.
* [[2019.05.03 - AA: Kittens]]
** I pet the cats everyday, but I think I would be fine without them. Perhaps that will change with age?
* [[2019.05.05 - AA: Recovery]]
** But, obviously, not everything. I am glad that we can talk about health.
* [[2019.05.06 - AA: Drawing]]
** I think she entirely avoids many topics that matters to me. It's not a fun place to think, I realize.
* [[2019.05.07 - AA: Thoughtless]]
** It's good that she's found a way to transition, and I strongly prefer where she's going to where she was.
* [[2019.05.08 - AA: Exercise]]
** Reminds me of speaking with people at work, except The Janitor.
* [[2019.05.14 - AA: Infection]]
** I wonder if stress causes infections for her too.
* [[2019.05.16 - AA: Scheduled Ablation]]
** I hope this fixes it. Sounds terrifying to me.
* [[2019.05.18 - AA: Discrete Math]]
** I'm surprised she doesn't like to write. She used to read so much. Consumption is easier.
* [[2019.05.06 - L: Yeesh]]
** Yeah, I know that pain. I think my wife knows it better than both of us.
* [[2019.05.16 - L: GTFO]]
** Years from me, before she even started the job.
* [[2019.05.19 - L: Bittersweet]]
** Hey, at least she is responding.
* [[2019.05.05 - Wiki Review: Oops]]
** Grafted back in.
* [[2019.05.19 - Wiki Review: Keep Reading]]
** Seems to be getting worse.
* [[2019.05.19 - TDL: Finish Semester Off]]
** Getting almost none of this done.
* [[2019.05.19 - Prompted Introspection: Mosely]]
** Feeling pretty hopeless.
* [[2019.05.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sabbath]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.05.19 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Will of Humanity]]
** Edited. Feeling pretty hopeless about it too.
