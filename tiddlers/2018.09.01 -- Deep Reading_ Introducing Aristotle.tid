title: 2018.09.01 -- Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

The issue of change really is one of those ancient problems we've never resolved. It is a reasonable possibility in academia today to hold a position that change is an illusion (in a number of disciplines). Time is a fundamental problem to the ego tunnel of our epistemology, and it is beyond my understanding as well in science.

I can say that I greatly admire the "how it came to be" and "what it's used for" as the defining features of an object in change. How something is constituted and what it goes on to constitute really does appear to be a fundamental notion of identity, especially in time. Much rides on this problem.

The causal issue boils down to the difference between explanation and justification for me. It highlights the "is/ought" problem. There is being to the "ought," even if it isn't derived from the normal kinds of "being" discussions. 

I have a very hard time peeling apart of the first 3 causes, I'm afraid. I'm supposed to see the difference, but I don't? Do I just help myself with handwaiving? I think, Straussianly, it's just not that important somehow.
