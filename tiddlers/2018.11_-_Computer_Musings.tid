!! Audit:

* It's fascinating to see a [[Wiki Audit]] and an [[Outopos]] log in here! Tags make it messier, no doubt. I used to solve this with transclusions all the way, but when they literally share all the same content, I don't see why I shouldn't just tag.
* Antergos is my go to Arch installer at this point.
* I need to make progress on Bob. I am slowly. I think I could have the infrastructure running (for the most part) in about a day.
** Though, I am still very concerned about compilation.
** I like that I'm being methodical and keeping my current infrastructure intact. It's important to me that I can shut this down and not be forced to rebuild anything.
* My remote servers continue to change. Dimbob is steady (minus the mishap this week).
** Perhaps I should have a monitoring tool?
* We have made significant improvements to our git infrastructure.
** It ain't perfect, but it is beautiful to me.
** We keep a local copy of all commits, a real-time that is reset nightly, and an actual nightly. We're taxing external resources too hard otherwise, and it allows us to make use of the real-time git properties. Rsync is the only other world class tool I know that handles diff distributions effectively (I forget for a couple tools like LFTP, which might just have rsync under the hood...too lazy to look).
* It was interesting to see something reduced from a project down to a log. That is not usually how things go on my wiki.
* Sad to see [[GB]] just petered out. I was willing to bend over backward too here. =/ Nope.
