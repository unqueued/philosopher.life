*[[h0p3's Wiki Review: Template]]
**  Super useful. Thank you, [[j3d1h]] for making it, and thank you for setting it up, [[1uxb0x]]. 
** Edited. I want the link there. Save me some time. 
*[[Timelines]]
** You are correct that you have other work to do in your sidebar. 
*[[Monthly.tmpl]]
** That is an interesting objective. Make sure you do a full system update. I am convinced that uptime is useful for maintaining workflows that are not easy to automatically repopulate. You still have to update your system. Happy medium here.
*[[weekly.tmpl]]
** This is not filled out. You need to at least talk about the subjects I'm doing with you. I'd like to see you add your own too.
*[[daily.tmpl]]
** You should also add hygiene and perhaps other objectives.
*[[Calender]]
** You should have your doctor's appointment in here.
*[[Maps]]
** I think you should have TDLs as a tab. Let's try to keep some separate. 
*[[.tmpl]]
** [[Monthly.tmpl]] does not match the [[monthly.tmpl]] tab in [[.tmpl]]. Fix that.
*[[h0p3's Wiki Review]]
** Edited. Not sure what will become of it. At least it will be easy to rip out.
* [[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Crazy heavy notes. I remember that dialecture. 
*** I'm glad you have been practicing taking notes and typing as well.
