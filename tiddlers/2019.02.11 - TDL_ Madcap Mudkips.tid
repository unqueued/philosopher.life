* Wreck those letters!
* Read+Write
* That [[Link Log]] is barren, and your web workspace is weeping and wailing for the chance to empty its bowels into the wiki. What are you doing, homie? Don't you love your browser windows enough to clean them up? Prune your trees, sir! Let's harvest.
* Work
* Encourage your children.
** They did much better the past two weeks than usual. What the hell is going right? Is it because they see each other working?
* That pizza has just been sitting there waiting. I'm so ready for it. 
** We've been good. It will finally be Tuesday.
