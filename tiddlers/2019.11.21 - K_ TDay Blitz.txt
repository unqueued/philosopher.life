Reading and writing otherwise.
Nov 21, 2019 5:53pm
Interesting.... why tho?
Nov 21, 2019 5:55pm
I‚Äôve got a reading to attend tonight. Casey Platt (I think that‚Äôs her name) is coming to read some of her novel and take questions.
Nov 21, 2019 6:59pm
For fun or for class?
Nov 21, 2019 7:00pm
For class, but it‚Äôll be fun. I‚Äôm sure. Haha
Nov 21, 2019 7:17pm
How goes it?
Nov 26, 2019 10:06am
I‚Äôm floundering over the finish line. Lol.
Nov 26, 2019 10:12am
How are you today? I got your friend request!
Nov 26, 2019 10:12am
I hear that. 
Nov 26, 2019 12:17pm
What particulars are you worried most about?
Nov 26, 2019 12:18pm
Friend request for what?
Nov 26, 2019 12:18pm
Facebook?
Nov 26, 2019 12:19pm
Hrm.
Nov 26, 2019 12:19pm
I‚Äôve got a whole research paper to reboot, a book review to finish, a final to write, and a project to do.
Nov 26, 2019 12:19pm
That is fascinating. I did not set a FB account up, at least not a direct one.
Nov 26, 2019 12:20pm
Can you send me screenshots?
Nov 26, 2019 12:20pm
Can do
Nov 26, 2019 12:20pm
Gracias. Curious to know how hard I'm about to get fucked here.

Nov 26, 2019 12:22pm
Oh... maybe this is Grandpa? Or maybe your dad?
Nov 26, 2019 12:22pm
Wtf
Nov 26, 2019 12:22pm
That looks much closer. I can find out later.
Nov 26, 2019 12:23pm
I‚Äôll sever ties for the time being. 

Sorry! I figured since we talked about it a few weeks ago that this was you biting the bullet.
Nov 26, 2019 12:23pm
Aye, I know.
Nov 26, 2019 12:23pm
Yeah, I've been asking several folks if I should (I am lucky to have advisors like you). Still thinking about it.
Nov 26, 2019 12:24pm
I only 2 of the 3 on that list, btw.
Nov 26, 2019 12:24pm
know*
Nov 26, 2019 12:24pm
Now that I‚Äôm thinking about it, Grandpa just makes new accounts when he forgets the password for his old one.
Nov 26, 2019 12:25pm
I feel like I saw [[k0sh3k]] there yesterday but not anymore.
Nov 26, 2019 12:26pm
I‚Äôm gonna message [[AA]] and see if I can get more info.
Nov 26, 2019 12:27pm
Ah, it's almost guaranteed Grandpa. 
Nov 26, 2019 12:27pm
I'm not worried.
Nov 26, 2019 12:28pm
(or, that's just what my attacker wants me to think... XD)
Nov 26, 2019 12:28pm
Good to hear. As soon as you asked for screenshots I panicked. üòÇ
Nov 26, 2019 12:28pm
My day doing is going great. We solved a mystery. Boxed and cleaned le offspring's room. Getting some reading and writing done.
Nov 26, 2019 12:30pm
Nice nice! You guys have any cool thanksgiving plans?
Nov 26, 2019 12:30pm
Probably Mexican food.
Nov 26, 2019 12:30pm
That sounds amazing.
Nov 26, 2019 12:31pm
Yeah. Hopefully some tacos and mole.
Nov 26, 2019 12:31pm
I‚Äôm baking a cheesecake for our event.
Nov 26, 2019 12:32pm
Awesome. Best desert is best.
Nov 26, 2019 12:32pm
How big will the event be, you think?
Nov 26, 2019 12:32pm
[[AA]] said ‚Äúexpect 20‚Äù half of that is my family alone hahaha
Nov 26, 2019 12:33pm
I honestly don‚Äôt have time for it. I‚Äôll likely be doing homework the whole time.
Nov 26, 2019 12:33pm
Awesome. I'm glad you guys have this traditional bash now.
Nov 26, 2019 12:33pm
Oh, fuck, dude. Yeah =/
Nov 26, 2019 12:33pm
Hey, I know you feel extra responsible for setting and cleaning, but you should sit this one out.
Nov 26, 2019 12:34pm
Everyone will understand that you are pressed for time and energy.
Nov 26, 2019 12:34pm
It‚Äôs true. My goal is to bust my ass for the next two days so that I won‚Äôt be as busy. If I can finish my book review and final exam before thanksgiving I can tackle my research paper at a much more leisurely rate.
Nov 26, 2019 12:35pm
I‚Äôm just worried that if I totally sit out that I‚Äôll be putting more stress on [[AA]] and [[L]]
Nov 26, 2019 12:35pm
I'm sorry this week is going to be hell.
Nov 26, 2019 12:35pm
Those two can handle it. 
Nov 26, 2019 12:35pm
It‚Äôs all good. Next semester is already looking really good.
Nov 26, 2019 12:35pm
True. They are determined hehe
Nov 26, 2019 12:35pm
I‚Äôm officially going to be a temp from January to the end of June next year. I‚Äôm only getting 20 hours a week and same pay though. But I‚Äôve applied for a writing job online as well. Hoping something will come of it.
Nov 26, 2019 12:36pm
Heck yeah.
Nov 26, 2019 12:36pm
I figure combining the two can keep me decently busy without class and give us some much needed extra coin.
Nov 26, 2019 12:38pm
Aye, and I'd argue you have time to test and explore. Snowballing as early as possible in the right directions is preferred, but if you don't know, this is a rational course of action, imho.
Nov 26, 2019 12:39pm
Definitely. I‚Äôll be setting my sights on grad school for next fall but I‚Äôm going to take a lot of time to figure out all of my potential paths.
Nov 26, 2019 12:40pm
You aint a rich kid who can dive headfirst and fail tremendously and be guaranteed that the pieces get picked up so you can try again.
Nov 26, 2019 12:40pm
Hahaha
Nov 26, 2019 12:40pm
That‚Äôs why my GPA is still fucked because of engineering.
Nov 26, 2019 12:41pm
You do have some margin of error though. 
Nov 26, 2019 12:41pm
So, just heads up on gradschool, a lot of programs would prefer that you were turning the application in next month, completed, everything.
Nov 26, 2019 12:42pm
Some schools do care about the GRE, and that is probably your best bet (alongside stunning letters from your English professors). 
Nov 26, 2019 12:42pm
You should study 250-300 hours for that GRE test. It will likely affect a great deal for you.
Nov 26, 2019 12:43pm
Unless you are doing a professional degree, at which point, I wouldn't be too worried.
Nov 26, 2019 12:43pm
Interesting. The deadline for my teaching program is next April.
Nov 26, 2019 12:44pm
I do need to take the GRE tho.
Nov 26, 2019 12:44pm
A teaching program is a professional degree.
Nov 26, 2019 12:44pm
I wouldn't be too worried about the test in that case.
Nov 26, 2019 12:44pm
OH I see the distinction now.
Nov 26, 2019 12:45pm
One of my big goals for the spring is to put together a kick ass application.
Nov 26, 2019 12:48pm
If you are 100% on teaching, I would suggest working in schools (at any level) next semester instead. You will make connections, have a chance to reason about it and practice (as well-structured and thoughtful as you are, I guarantee that kind of internship work will be valuable).
Nov 26, 2019 12:48pm
It will look good on your application too.
Nov 26, 2019 12:48pm
I‚Äôm definitely going to apply at a bunch of schools. If I can secure a job, the program will start in summer instead of fall.
Nov 26, 2019 12:49pm
It‚Äôs messy haha
Nov 26, 2019 12:50pm
I hear that.
Nov 26, 2019 12:50pm
You should even take aid positions. They'll pay the same as the jobs you have right now, but it will get your feet wet. 
Nov 26, 2019 12:51pm
That‚Äôs a very good point. 

It sounds like if I can‚Äôt secure a teaching job before the program stars in the fall that they will be assigning those aid positions (unpaid) as part of the program. 

So it would be beneficial to get a teaching job ASAP. üòÇ
Nov 26, 2019 12:53pm
We have a myriad of local schools near where we live now. Getting one of those gigs would be a dream come true.
Nov 26, 2019 12:54pm
You may find that some of the aid positions do pay and may even be able to satisfy those requirements. Public schools may have a variety of groups which use the building.
Nov 26, 2019 12:55pm
Yeah, it would be sick.
Nov 26, 2019 12:55pm
I love your dreams. They make sense.
Nov 26, 2019 12:56pm
Time to grind. I need to finish a letter too ;P.
Nov 26, 2019 12:56pm
Whoops. Sorry. Haha. Until later!
Nov 26, 2019 12:57pm
I'll be sending you a link when it's done. It's taken me 5 months to write it.
Nov 26, 2019 12:57pm
That sounds great! I‚Äôll be sure to give you some good feedback. :) I owe it to you after all. Haha
Nov 26, 2019 12:57pm
Happy Thanksgiving to you guys. <3
Nov 28, 2019 11:55am
You too, homie!
Nov 28, 2019 12:14pm
I hope it's relaxing for you.
Nov 28, 2019 12:15pm
I've got one paper rough drafted. I'm on 2/4 now :)
Nov 28, 2019 12:21pm
Noice.
Nov 28, 2019 12:24pm
How'd the cheesecake turnout for ya?

Nov 28, 2019 12:31pm
It has some oddities but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll taste fine!
Nov 28, 2019 12:32pm
[[L]] made a whipped topping and we have chocolate chips and syrup to use too.
Nov 28, 2019 12:32pm
Outstanding.
Nov 28, 2019 12:43pm
Thank you :)
