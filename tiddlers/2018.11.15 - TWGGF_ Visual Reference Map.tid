title: 2018.11.15 - TWGGF: Visual Reference Map

Is there a tool which shows the tree/web/map/table built from the References tab for each tiddler? I want to see a visual of tiddlers linking to each other. One can go to the Reference tab of the information tiddler, open a referencing tiddler, and repeat the process. I'm not looking to snake my way through tiddlers because it doesn't show the connections; I'm trying to find a visualization of the References on a growing map.

I've been looking through visualization tools, but I've not seen one which functions like this. I'm not looking to build the visualization by hand (which some of the mind mapping tools appear to require), but rather view an automated visualization of the connections already built into the wiki. I'm wondering if there is a plugin with a visual map that grows as you click on nodes, adding new referents to the map along with the connections as you go.

If there is not one, perhaps there is a preferred plugin to modify to do this work. Where should I go?
