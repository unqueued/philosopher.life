title: 2019.11.10 - Prompted Introspection: Every Coin

!! What does "There are two sides to every coin" mean to you?

This is clearly [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] territory, except this one isn't up to me. I like the quote because it points to concerns I have. It's reflective about dialectics. I see empiricism, constructed value, sublation, and doubt in that currency. Note, we can construct coins which only have one side (as we might standardly conceive) in some respects; but, closer inspection will always show that the understanding, explanation, justification, and meaning of the coin must be split into binaries all the way down and up, inside and out. It is not The One, and hence it is dependent on The Other for its meaning.
