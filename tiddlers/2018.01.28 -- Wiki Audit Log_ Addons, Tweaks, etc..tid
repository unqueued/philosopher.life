title: 2018.01.28 -- Wiki Audit Log: Addons, Tweaks, etc.

I've had a longstanding problem with being able to use my custom embedded font as the sole font on this wiki. I very much like monospace fonts, but most of them are space inefficient. I get the exact look I want now because someone found a weird hack around my problem:

Shout out to Ton Gerner.

I'm going to keep cleaning it up. Double-click to edit is nice.

* [[$:/plugins/danielo515/2click2edit]]

Interesting, but unused:

* http://grosinger.net/tw5-checklist/
** Nice To-Do-Lists

Fiddled with color settings, font size and spacing, and the margins.
