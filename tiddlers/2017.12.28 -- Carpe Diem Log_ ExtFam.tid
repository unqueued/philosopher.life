title: 2017.12.28 -- Carpe Diem Log: ExtFam

* Woke at 8:15
* Woke kids
* We chilled, talked, watched a movie, Neo Yokio
* Chili, Cornbread, and bratdogs
* My cousin L showed me her findings on the pipe and explained it to me. Awesome!
* Read+Write
* Cannabliss
* Talked with family a lot
* A bit of D2
* We setup Steam and TF2 on all the computers in the house. 
** Unfortunately, we were short 1 mouse (I didn't anticipate this), and so we always had at least one more person not able to play.
** LAN party is cool though. We should do it again. I'm not sure what we should play.
*** We could do it from afar, but I get the feeling they actually would not want to commit to such a thing, particularly since we would be limited in what games are available to us as linux users. Perhaps its just something you do when you are together?
* Fell asleep at 11:30ish to Archer in bed.
