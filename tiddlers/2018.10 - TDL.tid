!! Audit:

* As usual, I repeat myself a great deal in these. My executive functioning is //the best//. /facepalm.
* Plenty of monotony.
* I actually have "suggestions" in here at this point, lol.
* I have to admit, not everything can be done instantly. I did jump on the dryer.
** I need to add that my wife is clearly on edge. She's feeling listless, depressed, a bit trapped, overworked, anxious. This is exactly up to me, but I will continue to try to just be there with her.
* I did focus my writing decently. I'm glad.
* I've noticed that my planned meals aren't always accurate.
* I liked how I planned things out for my brother [[AIR]]. I think I was an okayish host, which is not my strong suit (but, I aim to become better at it).
* Fuck, I never setup piracy for my bro!
* Completely avoided Mr. K's. I don't think it's worth our time.
* I have not accomplished nearly as much as I'd have liked.
* I did a damn good job on [[FTO]] this month. That is consistently the case these past few months.
