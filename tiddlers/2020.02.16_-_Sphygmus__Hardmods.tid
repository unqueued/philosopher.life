"""
[2:04 PM]  h0p3: How's your weekend going?
[2:11 PM]  robotic_scarab: it's going well! pretty chill so far
[2:12 PM]  robotic_scarab: got the jig in the mail I needed to hack my switch, so I'm messing with installing android on it (actually on an SD card) right now
[2:14 PM]  h0p3: Noice. That is exciting. I'm generally nervous about modding, but it's rewarding. I think it's better when you can afford to lose it, brick it, etc. I hate that feeling like of not having room for error.
[2:14 PM]  h0p3: You get to see anyone else with hacked switches?
[2:16 PM]  robotic_scarab: not offline, no, but I only know one other person with a switch
[2:16 PM]  robotic_scarab: of course reddit & gbatemp is where the rest of the hackers hang out
[2:17 PM]  robotic_scarab: so far the switch has been the easiest thing I've ever "hacked"
[2:17 PM]  robotic_scarab: it reminds me of jailbreaking iphone in the early days when tethered jailbreaks were still a thing
[2:17 PM]  robotic_scarab: but it's also the only hack I've ever needed a physical thingy for (shorting two pins to enter a recovery mode)
[2:18 PM]  h0p3: That seems to be rarer and rarer these days.
[2:19 PM]  robotic_scarab: yeah
[2:20 PM]  robotic_scarab: i'm always impressed at the people doing hard mods
[2:20 PM]  robotic_scarab: opening up their hardwear and soldering stuff, hah
[2:21 PM]  h0p3: It's all greek to me. I have no idea how they figure it out or how that information spreads through a grapevine effectively. It's such an odd task. Reminds me of the phone markets in China.
[2:22 PM]  h0p3: (Thailand did not have people nearly as skilled, but there were still people who did nifty hardware work there too. Labor was so cheap that hardware was everything.)
[2:26 PM]  robotic_scarab: yeah, half of figuring out how to jailbreak/"hack" etc is figuring out where the information is and what of it is actually accurate
[2:29 PM]  h0p3: Yeah, the initial seeds of the information for those who develop the tek/method/tooling/scripts, etc. must be pretty darn hard to find. I always wonder if a developer had to leak some information somewhere down the line to find some of this.
[2:32 PM]  robotic_scarab: there are some dedicated people who know the hardware and enough about how low level stuff works to poke around and smash it
[2:33 PM]  robotic_scarab: it's incredible that we can go from a few people writing exploits to full-fledged tooling that's relatively doable for the mainstream person
[2:33 PM]  h0p3: Life is good.
[2:33 PM]  robotic_scarab: indeed
[2:34 PM]  robotic_scarab: i get to feel like a hacker without doing any of the actual work :sweat_smile:
[2:36 PM]  h0p3: Ah, lol. I think it's still hacking. Reminds me of lockpicking and hiking too. The mountain is very high to climb here, lol. I'm always at the bottom looking up at the other mountain climbers.
[2:37 PM]  robotic_scarab: haha, I feel the same!
