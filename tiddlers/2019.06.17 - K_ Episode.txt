Awesome. I checked in periodically on your game. It was neat to see.

I'm doing well today. We are finally getting that tax money in from what I understand. I've been applying to jobs. I didn't get the second interview for the position I was hoping for, I believe. Doing school work with the kiddos.

How about you?

The notes are complete now.

Good to hear on the taxes! Sucks on the job. :(

Sounds good. Hopefully, you'll have a chance to read or watch some of the narratives you told me about a week or so ago.

I can't say the show was my cup of tea, but my wife adored it: Good Omens. 6 episode mini-series, light-hearted, and gorgeous

Thanks! I’ll check it out. :)
