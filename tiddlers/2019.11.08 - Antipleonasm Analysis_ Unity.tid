title: 2019.11.08 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Unity

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
There can be no black-white unity until there is first some black unity. There can be no workers' solidarity until there is first some racial solidarity. We cannot think of uniting with others, until after we have first united among ourselves. We cannot think of being acceptable to others until we have first proven acceptable to ourselves.

It is likely the case that clustering together with those who share out identities or interests most and dialectically negotiating the expansion of our in-groups will be valuable to building a larger unity. I'll even agree class analysis cannot be complete without intersectional discourse. I can't say this is the exclusive, sufficient, or even necessary method or approach though. This is one of my rare disagreements with you, [[Saint MX]]. Everyone is other, even ourselves with ourselves. I'll agree we are building lossy empirical proofs though.
