title: 2018.09.26 â€“- Prompted Introspection: Best Memory Past Year

!! What's the best memory you have from the last year?

Saint Diogenesocrates, I hope you will forgive my //clever// answer's whimsical appearance because I'm not joking. I take your words seriously.

I've worked on similar kinds of questions before.

Exactly what counts as "best," "memory," and "you" turn out to be difficult definitions for me to give. I can only give you this semblance of an answer. You will have my effort, even if it is a poor answer.

My best memory is likely the pregnant-present, what I'm experiencing right now as I type these words (then these words, and so on).

Naively, we will take it to be something in the past. How far in the past though? Is .5 seconds ago the past? Of course it is. But, it also seems like my consciousness attends to everything on a delay. Even waking life's consciousness is a kind of a memory, and memory just has to be of something "in the past" or it couldn't be computed. It is increasingly clear to me that my consciousness is a self-representation of myself passing through time, and it does so probabilistically and with [[fff]] imprecision. 

I will admit that my conscious experience, my ego tunnel, is not the locus of my control. Some of my choices are made 3 seconds in advance of my actually coming to consciously experience the feeling of "making that choice." If I've prepared my mind effectively, e.g. to catch an object I know will fall, I can feel like I've made that "choice" much faster.

If what we mean by "best memory" here is my clearest memory, there is a way in which the only memory I have is what I'm attending to right now as I compute my modeling of myself and the world around me. I do feel like I have my clearest memory right now; much of the past is fuzzy, confabulated, or gone for me (even with a tool like this wiki). My memories themselves are being computed. I don't have access to how I computed them before, but only the Bayesian updates. I can't unversion myself. Unfortunately, I just don't trust my memory, and I aim to be cautious about it.

If what we mean by "best memory" here is my favorite, well then we have a kind of experience machine problem. I'd like to hope "best" is an ethical notion here. Do you think I must only look to this long-term storage? I've experienced The Sublime many times this year. If I could ethically live in permanent awe and ecstasy, I would. The scope of the timeslice has not been given.

Thus, I answer to you at least one of the two:

# The pregnant-present, the here and the now of lived experienced, Daseinic phenomenological conscious experience
# The entire year to the best of my recollection

I do [[hope]] to love [[my|h0p3]] life.
