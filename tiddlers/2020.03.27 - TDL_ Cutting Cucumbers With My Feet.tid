title: 2020.03.27 - TDL: Cutting Cucumbers With My Feet

//Form recovery saved me.//

* I'd like to see the kitchen fully prepped.
** I don't want Monday to be more difficult than it must.
* Several chores have not been completed in a while.
** I think our floors, in particular, need to be scrubbed.
* Walk. Everyone need to GTFO and walk. 
** What about the trail?
* Salad, pierogis. 
* One more office/desk approach. Let's try to make it clean and easy for her.
