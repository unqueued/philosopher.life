!! Audit:

* I've clearly got my "improved" pattern down. I don't spend time browsing Reddit, ycombinator, Digg, Quora, etc. for any longer than I need to. I push through, open tabs, and close it out. I move onto each service, smash'n'grab, and move on. By the end, I have my reading, and I don't feel like I'm stuck in perma-consume mode. I consume at my leisure, sometimes one or even two days later.
* Scientifically Godly, By Seldon, and so forth.
* I don't have time to re-read each article. Each day already takes a lot out of me. Trying to cram a month of my reading in a day is absurd.
* For the children...
* I am amazed at how much I forgot. Jesus. Like, there is the "oh yeah, I remember that" after some re-exposure, but some of this...my mind draws a blank. The limits of human memory. Well, I'm glad it's here. One day, I may curate from myself. I hope to.
* I skipped only a couple days. Almost every day is jam-packed though.
* Do I need to be more specific about the target of KYS? I think it's obvious.
* Redpilled AF
* Shifted from "Neat" to "Interesting," as this captures more. 
* My archetypality has begun to solidify.
* It's interesting to see which archetypal barrels get filled with links throughout the month
* Admittedly, I almost never use these tools.
* Maymays outlet is nice to have, and I hope not to abuse it.
* "For my self" has been excellent, even though I clearly think I'm neuro-atypical, to put it gently.
* My Preachers are so often the same crowd.
* Twice the notion of moving to another nation has come up. I must continue to give it thought.
* My link log feels like a river that washes over me.
* Love the /salute. Should I emote more?
* My titles weren't really so useful here, imho. Although, they did help me identify that feeling of overuse.
* Never trust cryptocoin holders.
* I have really gone out of my way to make sure I have links for each family member. Perhaps I'm not doing the best job ever, but I will keep trying.
* I adore my "Stunning!" finds.
* I had some rabbitholes. How do I signify the web sent me down a rabbithole rather than inside my own wiki? (or both?) hrmm...
** I did mention it at least once.
* I feel like I'm having a thousand flashbacks.
* Dem Maymays are very good. Delicious. Muh braincandy.
* I clearly see the need to curate harder than I have been. Admittedly, this is a skill that enables my [[Link Log]], but is separate from it. I fear I water down my insane signal-to-noise ratio by engaging in it here. I have thought about making another log for, especially since I don't do it that often. I need to ask my wife what she thinks. Librarians may know best here.
* I'm very grateful for a "Think About It" section. Sometimes, I need to wait and not put my tentpegs down.
* I adore my one link post. Go you, homie!
* I continue to see civilization sliding. What can I do to protect my family? How bad will it get? What are the right steps? I don't think I'm being paranoid. Nobody wants to think about bad things happening. It's obvious though. Trust your gut.
