//1.1 x 10^^77^^ key combinations and quantum computing only cuts this in half. Let's pray it isn't naturally weakened by the National Security Adversary.//

I literally wrote and compiled a book, <a href='h-book.7z'>Highdeas</a>, for a year or so. I think parts of it are excellent, and I think parts of it are terrible. I'm still thinking about what I will do with it. It is the direct predecessor to this wiki-journal. A lot of what I loved about writing while high was that I took having conversations with myself seriously. I was forced to empathize with myself. It was good for me, and it helped me find the will to overcome my existential crisis. Drugs aren't for everyone, but I'm convinced they saved my life multiple times.

In it, I've compiled trip-art, recorded conversations with myself, and engaged in some letter writing with family and friends. The goal was to write the book entirely while high. I had unique sections of writing while on different substances. There were two sections devoted to writing while sober, one a place where sober-me could have conversations with high-me, and the other was simply a place for sober-me to have a voice in the book. Much of it is silly, some of it is incredibly serious, and there were some interesting construction ideas used to make it. Ultimately, this wiki fulfills the functions I was trying to build into the construction of the book in a much better fashion. Hence, I've stopped writing the book. I leave it here only for posterity's sake.

You should also check out the [[Psychedelic Video Collection]] I compiled during that time period as well. 

I have plenty of writing from this period that still matters to me, but it is scattered. I will slowly collect it together:

* [[VPN Interview]]
* [[Highdeas Log]]
