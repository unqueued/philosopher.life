title: 2018.09.11 -- Deep Reading: LOTR:FOTR

Been having trouble getting my chillun to do their work. I thought I would stop this, but I really want to do it with them.

I have a hard time figuring out which character I'm most like in this story. Obviously, I have a lot in a common with many of the characters. I usually can't find a character that is like me, which is fine. 

The stealth and secrecy of these stories continue to shine for me.

The "everyone knows everything about everyone" small town thing has disappeared in my life. I lived in that before. It's a curious thing. I realize it has some negative effects, but overall, there was also a sense of community that wouldn't have been there otherwise. The way news spreads is organic, slow, etc. I'm not being romantic about it.

OC is adored. That said, I still don't like the songs. They are flavor that I want to skip. Yeah, yeah, I get it.
