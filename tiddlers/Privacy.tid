//Dedicated to Sir Adam D. Moore and our clusters of discourse on political normativity.//

Civilization^^[tm]^^ is the progress toward a [gnostic] society of privacy [for those in ,,,,[[power]]]. The [justified] savage's whole existence is [radically] public, ruled by the laws of his tribe[, Humanity]. Civilization^^[tm]^^ is the process of [sophistically] setting [Super]man [and his ego] free from [his accountability and moral obligations to other] men. [Of course, the [[Civilized|2019.11.11 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Civility]]^^tm^^ Über[[gentleman|The Gentleman]] seeks to convert information advantages, including those acquired through privacy asymmetries, into private material gain and refactoring political [[power]] for his own sake, conveniently assuming the egoistic concepts of freedom handed down to us through Hobbes, Mill, Berlin, and Nozick are morally justified].

[T]hose who practice justice [tend to] do so involuntarily and because they have not the [political] [[power]] to be unjust [without suffering vindicating consequences]...for wherever anyone thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is [likely tempted to be] unjust...For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, [except on ,,,,[[faith]] both: in,,,, [[The Other]] and in virtue of the fitting application of Golden-ruled evaluations of ,,,,[[others]],,,,, [[irwartfrr]]].

[With respect to ,,,,[[The Moral Law]],] there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known. Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.

Arguing that you don't care about the [political] right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no[t much] different than saying you don't care about [the political right to] free speech because you have nothing to say.

Transparency is for those who carry out public duties and exercise public power. Privacy is for everyone else. [Therefore, as political animals and moral agents, to the extent we each have moral duties to and [[power]]-over [[others]], we do not have a prima facie moral right to privacy against them.]

Agent(s) A (or its parts) has privacy from Agent(s) B (or its parts) regarding [property, object, or process] P, a dialectical extension of A's identity, to at least the [[dok]] B lacks anti-luck contextualist epistemic access to P and its logical consequences.<<ref "a">>

** Privacy is a hypothetical imperative, a means, an instrumental reason, a tool, a property/process/condition
** “A right to privacy is a right to control access to, and uses of, places, bodies, and personal information”...“the ability to control access to our bodies, capacities, and powers, and to sensitive personal information, is an essential part of human flourishing or well-being”
** is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves and thereby reveal themselves selectively. 
** information transmitted from a sender to a receiver is not accessed by others.
** ability to control how data about you propagate, conceals properties of people, not the messages
** the property that ciphertexts reveal information about the encrypted data to an attacker other than whatis inherently revealed by the tokens the attacker possesses





Deception requires justification. Who are you aiming to deceive and why? Almost everyone has a kneejerk reaction in favor of privacy, but hypocritically few care to define it or practice it meaningfully; if it is really so important to you, you have to act on it.

Intentionally generated or maintained privacy is deceptive; it aims to hide information from some set of agents. The principle-agent problems arise in such cases, and we must justify our deception. Wielding the [[ROG]] is not a simple task. No sufficient account of privacy can be given without providing a justification and explanation of the Hohfeldian moral rights structures ... What do we objectively owe to others, when do we have a right to just be ourselves, and what spaces are we obligated to create for private use (including abuse)? We do not have carte blanche moral rights to what most people consider their own bodies and minds, and we owe far more to [[others]] than mere non-interference. Spheres of privacy are no exception to [[The Golden Rule]]. It is easy to pursue The Good Life, but it is much harder to pursue justified eudaimonia. It is not clear that we have the right to feel safe in all contexts.<<ref "hl">>

In various contexts and [[dok]], we must shield ourselves from a world of signaling, judgment, and unjustified intrusion. We must also generate spaces from which surprise can artificially emerge. Like every tool, treating the minds as means by hiding information is a double-edged sword, and it must never be as mere means. Of course, information advantages can beget many kinds of resource advantages. We do not wish to be blackmailed and coerced, yet evil people must be held accountable. One must decide who will be the watchmen, what counts as The Supreme Criterion of Justified Political Authority, the Rule of Law. Understanding the value, meaning, and rights to privacy require an analysis of [[The Moral Law]] extended into justifying basic political structures.


What does it mean to say information is used //against// us? Surely, it can be partially against us, against parts of ourselves, against variations in our future selves, and so forth without actually being unjustifiably against us. A [[good]] friend cuts us slack in virtue of judging us and making judgments for us from the outside, including using our otherwise private information for us toward [[The End]] particularized to our context.<<ref "sa">>


It is true that we need places to play, experiment, unwind, celebrate, learn, vent, mourn, quietly fear or worry, and to be ourselves where fewer or no other agents can access to various [[dok]] or conditions. Privacy generates a haven where we can minimize our exposure and ease our anxieties over the prices which might tempt others to abuse information about us.

* Abusing privacy
** Shielding darkness. Cannot dissolve it entirely without enabling the centralization of [[power]]. 
*** How does one shield the innocent without shielding those who would otherwise abuse the [[ROG]]?

** Limitations on the duty to be scrutinized, tested, inspected
** We don't have a right to just be anyone we want to be.

*** But as does vulnerability. What is the butterzone, sweetspot?
**** Insofar as it is necessary condition for vulnerability necessary for the decentralization of power, yes, but otherwise [[The Golden Rule]] demands we deprivatize ourselves as far as we can. How much safety do you have a right to, and from whom?
** privacy not only has intrinsic and extrinsic value to individuals but also has instrumental value to society, is to recognize that privacy both [heightens respect for individual autonomy in decision-making for self-development and individual integrity and human dignity], and [enhances the value of privacy in various social roles and relationships that contribute to a functioning society]

** Preventing the possibility of collection or intrusion.
** Privacy as a liberty from or to...What liberties are protected by privacy?

** Scopes
*** Time? Place? Category? Agencies, etc.
*** Re-releasing, access to newer tokens of the same type

** Metadata, side-channels, unintuitive leaks
** As related to the concept of Anonymity
** Natural privacy in unidirectional, parasocial, qualia, metaphysics 
** Risk assessment of privacy and accountability tradeoffs is a game-theoretic question too.

* Privation of X

* [Genuinely unique normative category, Unifying distinctive concept, property, or reason in common] vs [Hohfeldian molecular cluster of reductionist, deflationary, decoupled, simplified down to non-privacy problems]

* Hypocrisy

*** The problems of [[naked]]ness
** Overshooting the golden mean, TMI, avoiding mere virtue-signaling
** Prioritizing privacy only conveniently. Resolving conflicting duties.
** People often demand privacy for themselves and accountability for others. Double-standard.

** license-plate readers
** predictive analytics
** leading to identity theft
** predicate privacy, the property that tokens reveal no information about the encoded query predicate
** Natural privacy: people just aren't interested.
** homomorphic encryption 

* Principles of Method
** Access control technology protects the privacy information via making accessing strategies to ensure that only theauthorized subject can access the data resource. 
** Information confusion technology protects the original data with generalization, anonymity, or confusion, which achieves the inability of attackers to obtain the useful information via the modified data. Anonymous technologies, such ask-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness, achieve the privacy preservation via masking the original data into a cloaking spatial. 
** Cryptograph technology protects users’ privacy information via encryption techniques and trapdoor functions.
** Every anonymization method has at least one parameter to adjust the level of privacy protection considering some utility for the collected data.


* Lines
**  the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth
** There is a difference between the needs of humans and the needs of persons.

* Prescription
** Owning the means of privacy production requires owning the means of production more generally.

* Thought Experiments
** Zero Privacy Word: global telepathic panopticon (accounting for computational asymmetries in intelligence, etc, accounting for memory requirements, etc.). The utility equation.

For if we are observed in all matters, we are constantly under threat of correction, judgment, criticism, even plagiarism of our own uniqueness. We become children, fettered under watchful eyes, constantly fearful that — either now or in the uncertain future — patterns we leave behind will be brought back to implicate us, by whatever authority has now become focused upon our once-private and innocent acts. We lose our individuality, because everything we do is observable and recordable.

privacy is not only of value to the individual, but also to society in general…..Privacy is a common value in that all individuals value some degree of privacy and have some common perceptions about privacy. Privacy is also a public value in that it has value not just to the individual as an individual or to all individuals in common but also to the democratic political system. Privacy is rapidly becoming a collective value in that technology and market forces are making it hard for any one person to have privacy without all persons having a similar minimum level of privacy

You can hide who you are, but it turns out that it's not so easy to produce random noise


My work isn't just about politics; it is political itself.


You only have so much control over your privacy, a [[power]]-over access to difficult to reverse-engineer information about who you are (and think you are).

I'm a __radical__ unorthodox, an outlier here, and I think it is extremely rational to question it hardcore (both publically and privately)

People, and arguably women moreso than men, <<footnote "h:mtm" "I argue with my daughter about this often.">> are heavily pressured to reveal themselves offline and online. Many people are taught to believe they are valueless unless they are public. 


Forcing foolish speech out of the public square removes its ability to be inspected in light of reality and opposing logic. Rather it gets driven underground and shared among people in private, removed from cross examination. This is the exact formula for radicalization. Only by allowing foolish ideas into the public square can they be seen for what they really are and dismantled.

another part of freedom of speech is the ability for anyone to choose what they want to hear. 


Forgiveness is not about forgetting, and further, you may look back on the record and find different interpretations. Our memories often cannot be trusted.

Creating spaces for people to change their mind. Slack.

Trust, as defined by organizational scholars, is our willingness to be vulnerable to the actions of others because we believe they have good intentions and will behave well toward us.
