title: 2016.25.12 -- Christmas Letter to Parents

Dear Mom and Dad,

I love you.

Thank you for making Christmas so special for my children. They've been asking for/hinting at tablets/phones (any handheld touchscreen devices) for a while now (it is a yearly cycle in our household [I am trying to ensure that my children care about, plan for, identify with, and empathize with their future selves, in this case, enough so to make sure they do not break their tablets this year]). The child-protective covering will no doubt be useful (may the yearliness cycle end with persistent, cared-for devices that we take up as extensions of ourselves). Thank you. 

[[IMF]] and I are going to use the Minecraft stopmotion kit for homeschooling together. I'm not sure [[IMF]] immediately appreciated it (that's okay) since he was overloaded in the Christmas bonanza-feeling. He's going to enjoy it. I hope it will open up a cool world for him and allow him to cultivate theories of mind and a richer sense of the 4-dimensional stage of life. Imho, it is was a very well selected gift for an autistic child. I wish I had thought of it. 

[[MSN]] loves her Minecraft handbook collection. She has been exploring its metagame and the toolchains which surround its landscape. In a plain and non-ironic sense, it is a decorated embodiment of her project. Thank you for appreciating her project and putting the grandparent seal of approval on it. It's part of who she is. 

You chose your gifts well. It shows you understand my children well, and I appreciate your empathy. You made their day, and in virtue of that, you made mine. Thank you!

Thank you for being good parents and grandparents. You have done well with what you have, where you are, who you are, and your context. 

It's hard to have a conversation when we are both crying. If I could reach out and hold you, I would. These words are the only hug I am able to give you. I'm sorry, and I love you. 

I'm sorry I don't have a gift for you yet (I'm not sure how to describe it; I am trying to make us all happy).

We're very much looking forward to seeing you soon.

Love,

[[h0p3]]
