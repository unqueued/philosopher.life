[12:41 PM] h0p3: How's it going?
[12:44 PM] Sohalia: Some days I think it depends on who you ask. [[K]] and I are chugging along. Everything is relatively stable on my side of the court but everything going on has [[K]] stressing out. Campus is closing soon but no one can tell him whether or not he’ll still have a job. He’s heard whispers that if the library closes he’ll be laid off but his boss hasn’t said anything directly to home. Plus, I’m not sure how to help him other than just let him vent. :frowning:
[12:48 PM] Sohalia: But on my own end I’m honestly doing fine. We’re healthy and safe, as financially stable. I worry for my friends and family that are working necessary jobs, but I am honestly doing alright mentally.
[12:49 PM] Sohalia: I think my mom realizes that [[K]] and I have been going to church less. She and dad sent us a recording of their church stuff so we could “go” without actually going. Sweet of her to think of me, but I’m not interested. :eyes:
[12:51 PM] h0p3: [[K]] is likely especially sensitive to change. I feel like I'm similar there. I can appreciate his stress. Uncertainty blows.
[12:52 PM] Sohalia: I wish I could give him my feelings of hope in times like this.
[12:52 PM] Sohalia: And you too. I wish I could bottle it up and send it you in a little jar.
[12:52 PM] h0p3: I think you all are in good shape, and you have support.
[12:52 PM] Sohalia: We have a lot to be thankful for, that’s for sure.
[12:53 PM] h0p3: I find that humorous, and I appreciate your desire. Thank you.
[12:54 PM] h0p3: I actually think I'm an incredibly hopeful person. The test of hope is to be faced with the perception of a nearly hopeless situation (at least as one perceives) and still believe there's a reason to hope. I think my metal is tested heavily here.
[12:55 PM] h0p3: Is [[K]] considering looking for other kinds of work? I know he's comfortable in the library.
[12:56 PM] Sohalia: I think he is, but he hasn’t actually told me so yet. I think he still needs time to sort through this all mentally, so I’m trying not to breathe down his neck about it.
[12:58 PM] h0p3: I'm glad you are doing alright mentally. I think marriage is often a balancing act. I try to be up when she's down, and vv.
[12:58 PM] Sohalia: Very well said.
[12:58 PM] Sohalia: I’ve always felt like he and I exist on a teeter totter — when I’m down, he tries his best to push me back up and when he’s down I do the same.
[1:01 PM] h0p3: I obviously have incredibly mixed feelings about church. I am glad that you aim to be honest, thoughtful, and existentially wise.
[1:03 PM] Sohalia: I’ve just grown tired of the theatrics. If I’m going to commit my life to something, it’s not going to be done blindly or by turning my back to someone unless I REALLY have a solid, defendable reason.
[1:04 PM] h0p3: I hear that. That makes sense.
[1:05 PM] h0p3: It might be worth systematically searching. Sunday might be a fine day to read (and find others in similar shoes) on these kinds of crucial but difficult (sometimes even nebulous feeling) topics.
[1:11 PM] h0p3: I have friends from many kinds of religious and philosophical backgrounds. I think it's imperative to consistently develop our spiritual and moral compass. It's expensive to come to understand of ourselves and the world, but it's a necessary kind of work. It's part of the core of who you are.
[1:12 PM] h0p3: Also, my friend [[Sphygmus]] is playing Animal Crossing. Would you like another friend to speak with about that game? Sphygmus is an amazing woman (shy, kind, brilliant).
[1:14 PM] Sohalia: Sure! I love having new people to play and talk with :smile:
[1:15 PM] Sohalia: Plus, Animal Crossing is a very social game. It’s easier to get what you need if you share with your friends.
[1:17 PM] h0p3: Cool. Sent her your dicksword#ID.
[1:22 PM] h0p3: Sphygmus is robotic_scarab
