 I appreciate it [[h0p3]]. >_< How are you doing today?
11 hours ago
 Doing well. Unfortunately, making people sad/angry on the internet (which is not my intention).
11 hours ago
 So, thinking about that.

 Reddit? Emoji image of 'joy'

 People on reddit are assholes.
11 hours ago
 lol
11 hours ago
 nope, from my wiki. I've been in correspondence with many folks through it
11 hours ago
 But, yeah, lots of assholes on Reddit

 After the explosion post Digg fiasco, downvote became dislikes. A lot of mature conversational ranking tools disappeared. It became the mediocrity of democratic mob rule.

 It's easier on smaller subs

 Can't find the book. =/

 I often fail to find Norton's books
11 hours ago
 Ugh. That sucks.... thanks for checking for me. I HATE those Norton books. XD

 I’ve just stopped caring if I upset people online tbh. I’m nice to strangers upfront until they give me a reason not to.
11 hours ago
 I attempt to cooperate through at least one failure to cooperate on their part, then I ignore.

 That sounds like how I rile people up when we’re raiding with randos. Emoji image of 'joy'

 Keyboard courage is an awful thing.

 I wish there was a way to circumvent it.

 Building virtual community in which we are not physically reminded of our vulnerability, where we don't have the affective instincts to empathize (relying heavily on the cognitive), is a difficult problem. It's not going away either.
11 hours ago
 I’m trying really hard to thicken my skin when it comes to dealing with volatile people because I’m truthfully a very sensitive person and I tend to overreact to things that aren’t that big a deal.
11 hours ago
 I believe sensitivity is empirically (and conceptually) linked to intelligence. I don't think your sensitivity is a bad thing at all, although I appreciate the need to defend yourself with thick skin in the appropriate contexts. I'm not terribly good at knowing how to be vulnerable to others in the right way.
8 hours ago
 My own personal rule of thumb is to prioritize honesty and tact at the same time. I can’t find a good balance between the two. But I also believe that vulnerability is what made my relationship with [[L]] work. It wasn’t until a few years into our relationship that could even share emotions and problems with her. Bottling things up is an awful thing to do. Emoji image of 'skull_and_crossbones'

 Ha, I hear that.

 Same dude. If I went back in time, the first thing I would do is slap the shit out of myself. Emoji image of 'sweat_smile'

Ooooooh [[h0p3]]... today is a rough day for me. After having that discussion with my friends about finding a new job I find myself having zero motivation in this one.
10 hours ago
 Like absolutely do not want to do anything. It’s bad.
10 hours ago
 I know that feel!
10 hours ago
 I have to fight the feeling of “this is going to be pointless” because I don’t want to screw over everyone I’m leaving behind.
10 hours ago
 I see why so many people have left this job so angry... I think anger is one of the only ways you can actually leave it.
10 hours ago
 It sounds like you are motivated!
10 hours ago
 just not to do give shit about your current occupation
10 hours ago
 personally, I wouldn't sweat it...but, I could be wrong
10 hours ago
 I appreciate that you don't want to screw others over here
10 hours ago
 You might give them transition material that you slowly accumulate/build
10 hours ago
 Personally, I'd be spending non-trivial portions of my job-time finding another job, lol.
10 hours ago
 I don't think you owe Humana a damned thing, but you know my position.
10 hours ago
 Girl, you got me all angry for you, lol.
10 hours ago
 Okay, my goal is to empathize with your position as best as I can. You do not want the pointless feeling. Like the game is already over because  you know it's a deadend. I feel that. Now, I know it is the male/engineer/autist in me that says "how do we fix it?"...but, I've come to learn that is not what everyone needs immediately.
10 hours ago
 I feel your pain of the pointlessness!
10 hours ago
 I'm sorry it's a rough day.
10 hours ago
 It’s alright — your empathy actually means a lot.
10 hours ago
 I think my anger/frustration is good fuel for me. My conversation with [[JRE]] about feeling trapped in a job that is not well described and goal-less really hit home for me. It helped me see and properly define my problem.
10 hours ago
 Which is truthfully half the battle for me.
10 hours ago
 I don’t feel I owe Humana anything, more my coworkers who have become friends. The last thing I want is to spurn them before I leave. I’d rather motivate them to move on themselves.
10 hours ago
 All of them are in my same position I think, as they all exhibit similar signs to varying degrees.
10 hours ago
 Two of us are actually making steps to look for another job, and I’m worried the remaining two will let it all collapse on themselves.
10 hours ago
 Okay, thank you for letting me get all that off my chest so suddenly. I needed someone to vent to.
10 hours ago
 Lol, np.
10 hours ago
 As my immediate family lovingly half-jokes with me (particularly my daughter), I am "the worst:" please consider writing more about it.
10 hours ago
 My favorite part about talking to you is you’re not afraid to get into the nitty-gritty. My desire to dive into the ugly conversations does not deter you, which can’t be said for everyone.
10 hours ago
 I am actually keeping a small log to help me stay motivated. I will consider posting it for you.
10 hours ago
 It’s basically the “here are my ugly emotions through this process hurray I can do it”
10 hours ago
 yay!
10 hours ago
 It is the seed of new habits.
10 hours ago
 Hehe.

 Honestly the biggest transition is just learning to do it on the computer. I used to do it as a kid all the time. There’s a single diary I wrote in throughout most of my youth and re-reading it reminds me of things I definitely would have forgotten otherwise.
10 hours ago
 That transition is hard. Read a weird book about note taking on paper recently: https://philosopher.life/#How%20to%20Make%20a%20Complete%20Map%20of%20Every%20Thought%20you%20Think:%5B%5BHow%20to%20Make%20a%20Complete%20Map%20of%20Every%20Thought%20you%20Think%5D%5D

 SMSed the dude, and he called me back. Hopefully will learn more about his thoughts on it.

 Nice

 Sorry, was taking my frustrations out on cleaning. I did some research on how to get my EIT. Looks like I have lots of studying ahead of me, which makes sense.
7 hours ago
 To respond to your second bit — I frequently have to keep a pen and paper with me to take notes.
7 hours ago
 So this man speaks to me, though I am attempting to make the transition as much as I can.

 When I'm on a jobsite where I'm not allowed to use electronics, I'm forced to write. It's especially nice for drawing. The transition ain't easy.
