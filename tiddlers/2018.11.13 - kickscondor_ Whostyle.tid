title: 2018.11.13 - kickscondor: Whostyle

Hey kicks,

I'm loving https://www.kickscondor.com/whostyles/. I have tried to go for the white background, and I can't. =( I'm sorry.

Your site looks good, but it's simply too difficult on my eyes and brain. This is an issue of usability instead of aesthetics for me.<<ref "i">> I do not use the web without a tool like [[Owl|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/owl/]], including your site.<<ref "w">>  Too much brightness is physically painful for me. It is with regret that I must modify your whostyle's color scheme.

What I have now does feel a lot more like you than what I had, but it's not the one you chose. If you have a secondary mildly-darker background I can use, I will use that. I hate that the solution to my light sensitivity detracts from your intentional style. 

Sincerely,

h0p3
