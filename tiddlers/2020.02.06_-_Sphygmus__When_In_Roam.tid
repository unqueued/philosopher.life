title: 2020.02.06 - Sphygmus: When In Roam

"""
[1:10 AM]  h0p3: Pushing updates a lot faster tonight, it seems. :slight_smile:
[1:11 AM]  h0p3: Also, I do not understand the fuss about Roam. Proprietary, cloud only: game over.
[1:11 AM]  h0p3: Unless I'm mistaken there, or there's plans to move toward self-ownership.
[1:12 AM]  robotic_scarab: given what I've read about the pricing plan, it doesn't sound like it
[1:12 AM]  h0p3: Doesn't make sense to chase that tool du jour to me.
[1:13 AM]  h0p3: At least they let you escape with a json.
[1:14 AM]  robotic_scarab: an escape hatch but only slightly
[1:19 AM]  h0p3: The more I reflect on the wikis of [[Phil|Phil Nunnally]] and [[Jack|jbaty]], the more I'm convinced they don't know why they are using their tools.
[1:22 AM]  robotic_scarab: there have been a lot of tools I've used just for the sake of using them, and that I didn't have a good "why" for -- the wiki is not one of them!
[1:23 AM]  robotic_scarab: (I say confidently, lol. I'm at least 90% sure I have good reasons for why I'm using a wiki, and TiddlyWiki specifically.)
[1:23 AM]  h0p3: Yeah, I can see that. I am someone who has loved just picking up tools to see what they do, what it's like to use them, out of curiosity. That doesn't seem to be the chase they are on.
[1:24 AM]  h0p3: I might be wrong about that though. Hopefully, I'll have the chance to see their wikis evolve.
[1:28 AM]  robotic_scarab: mm, yeah, i see the distinction you're pointing at
[1:30 AM]  robotic_scarab: one of the more interesting things about watching is that they still keep returning to TiddlyWiki -- Jack started up a wordpress blog, then he scrapped that, and so forth -- but still, they keep updating their wikis! I wonder how they think about that, given all the other tools they talk about
[1:36 AM]  h0p3: I wonder how much they talk about Tiddlywiki in their other tooling too, lol.
[1:38 AM]  h0p3: The barrier to entry to getting a wiki really working, which looks decent and has the stuff you want is pretty high, as you point out (I still can barely make the tool what I want it to be). At least in the beginning for me, I also found it it very difficult to understand what kinds of projects I want to create in it (and what it means to build a process and protocol which matters to me in it), coming up for rules for how to use it, and experimenting (and experimenting has slowed down a lot for me, sadly). That friction is a problem for adoption. One other problem, imho, is that Tiddlywiki has a curve on its returns; you kind of have to use it a ton for it to start lighting up. What makes it so different doesn't really show up until you've put a ton of effort into it.
