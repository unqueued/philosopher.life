[[Empathizing with a Psychopath]] needs some real analysis. I've been putting it off too long. If psychopaths are those who have the ability to turn empathy on and off, and at times elect not to (some for much better reasons than others), then we need to think about what that really means. What does it feel like to be psychopathic? What does it feel like to be a nihilist, relativist, or moral non-realist of any type. I think some psychopathic people really desperately want to empathize with themselves and people like them.
