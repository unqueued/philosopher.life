title: 2019.02.10 - TWGGF: Signing Diff

I want to cryptographically sign my wiki. I use nodejs to compile the html file, sign it, embed the signature into the html file, and then serve it over a few networks. Some methods transfer a bit-for-bit copy (git, resilio sync, ftp, etc.), so the signature verification works in those cases. Unfortunately, saving a freshly rendered wiki (https://philosopher.life) through a browser does //not// generate a bit-for-bit copy of the original. Chrome and FF save the same object, but that object is not identical with the output of nodejs. This is a problem; I need to be able to count on nodejs and browsers producing identical objects in order for my signature to be effective across multiple methods of serving the wiki.

Here's the diff:

Any ideas on how best to fix this?
