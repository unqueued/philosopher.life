It is, in fact, far easier to act under conditions of tyranny than it is to think.

It is clear why her words are rising again. It is difficult to get people to reason about more abstract and radically complex forms of centralized [[power]]. The tyranny of the capitalists and reactionary guardians make it much easier to submit than to fight. To be exacting here, those who submit under conditions of tyranny are //thinking//, but it's not about what is [[Right]] most of the time. I hold people responsible for how and why they respond to the centralization of power. A refusal to engage in their obligations to [[Humanity]] means they are part of that tyranny. Lastly, I think acting against tyranny is much more difficult than merely thinking about it.

These quotes are moving attempts to poetically codify a rule-of-thumb. They are not stated carefully enough, but I still admire them.
