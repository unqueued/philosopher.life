title: A Little History of The World

Simple read, very loose though. It's like a poetic teleporter on Wikipedia. It's opinionated (heavily focused on Western history thus far). It's a book you can disagree with, and it turns out to be okay. 

Finding ways to enjoyably teach these timelines to my offspring is a problem. I think this is meant to be magical in a way. I'll take it.

The book asks a lot of questions.
