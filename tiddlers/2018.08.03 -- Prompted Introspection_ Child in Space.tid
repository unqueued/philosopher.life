title: 2018.08.03 -- Prompted Introspection: Child in Space

!! How would you react if you were to find out you would be the first child in space?

Samwise, this is a complex question to consider. I'm trying to understand the future-tensity of becoming a child, let alone fulfilling a dream of going into space.

I need to understand the meaning and mechanism of becoming a child. Being the "first" is irrelevant to me, in a sense. Although, that we could afford to send a child would be odd. I believe only the wealthy can do this...so that would probably be part of the explanation, unless we went fullblown Charlie and Chocolate Factory on this shit.

Weird kind of problem unintended for me.
