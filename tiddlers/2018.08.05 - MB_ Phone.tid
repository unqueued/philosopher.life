We've had trouble connecting, but we got to talk late tonight. I'm glad we did. MB understands me really, really well. She sees the relationship in a profound way. I wish to understand her and how she understands things much better. I learn from her often. 

Also, I'm going to go out of my way to communicate more with her husband, A. She said it would be a great idea too.

She installed resilio sync and signal. I sent her Infinite Jest, Saga, etc.

She wants to setup a wiki too. I volunteered to read it with her. I hope to help her with it.
