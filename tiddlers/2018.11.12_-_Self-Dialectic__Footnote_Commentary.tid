title: 2018.11.12 - Self-Dialectic: Footnote Commentary

It seems like I won't be pushing so hard the next time I [[audit]]; some of this content will stay as it is. I think future changes will be through footnote based additions and commentary. Right now, I'm not working on the semantics and story, I'm working on syntax, metadata, and large-scale structuring. It seems possible that [[Prompted Introspection]] will eventually become hybridized with [[Wiki Audit]] and [[Self-Dialectic]] in providing footnote commentary or even more.

This timeline work is deeply incomplete. H-book continues to just sit there; what a fuckin' prototype! I also have a large number of reddit, thesource, gmail/gchat, and likely other transactions to add. I can comb through to recover at least some of these; I realize that enormous amounts are lost to the sands of time, and clearly, not everything belongs in here either. It's not clear what will be worth my time. I have a large story to tell here. There's a way in which it is easier to do it realtime as I learn how to use this tool; retroactive additions almost oblige a higher standard from me.
