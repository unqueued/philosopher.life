One of my son's friends. Recently moved here from New Hampshire. He speaks fast, he's intelligent, and I like the inferences he was making during our conversation. He likes HP, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc. He's well-mannered. His dad is finding a job, was doing real-estate. Not clear why they really moved, but they said they don't like the weather up there. He only brought up his mother, a nurse (works late), upon asking. Apt. 3. Lived here for a month or two, but intends to move to a house once his father can find a job.

He blurts out what comes to top of his head, which I admire in many respects (I'm no different). It's possible he was held back? I can't tell. He's in 5th grade, but felt like he should have been in 6th (sounds like a weird move). He attends the public elementary school nearby. He complained about having detentions for not bringin a pencil sharpener and copying 2 paragraphs. I'm glad he thinks the punishment is bullshit. There is some sanity in this kid.
