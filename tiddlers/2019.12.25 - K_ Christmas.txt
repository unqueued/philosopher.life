How are you doing this fine evening?
Dec 23, 2019 6:53pm
We're doing well enough. We've been busy packing and cleaning all day today.
Dec 23, 2019 6:54pm
Kinda wrapping it up for the evening, finishing food, will watch Psych/Community, and then write in my wiki for the evening.
Dec 23, 2019 6:55pm
How about you? How are you all doing?
Dec 23, 2019 6:55pm
Good to hear!

We are good. Also cleaning and preparing to be gone for awhile. Our vacuum isnâ€™t working properly. I suspect the belt. But thatâ€™s not pressing so the floor will remain dirty until we get back haha. We caught up on Brooklyn 99, Iâ€™m reading a light novel my brother lent to me and [[L]] is playing video games.

Iâ€™m always antsy leaving the apartment unattended for so long but itâ€™ll be fine.
Dec 23, 2019 7:03pm
Sounds like a pleasant time.
Dec 23, 2019 7:03pm
Why antsy leaving the apt?
Dec 23, 2019 7:03pm
TLDR: I worry too much haha.
Dec 23, 2019 7:03pm
(also, sorry about the vacuum)
Dec 23, 2019 7:03pm
No worries. It was a cheap $80 vacuum that lasted almost as long as our marriage. :D
Dec 23, 2019 7:04pm
Hard to beat.
Dec 23, 2019 7:04pm
Iâ€™d say it was well worth the money haha
Dec 23, 2019 7:04pm
I love those kinds of purchses
Dec 23, 2019 7:04pm
I'm so ready to have hardwood floors
Dec 23, 2019 7:04pm
Iâ€™m going to try replacing the belt. I took the whole thing apart today and everything seems fine.
Dec 23, 2019 7:04pm
Theyâ€™re so much easier to clean!
Dec 23, 2019 7:04pm
Aye. Better with cats too.
Dec 23, 2019 7:05pm
How does your new place look?
Dec 23, 2019 7:06pm
I mean obviously you havenâ€™t gone in person yet (probably). But will you guys have enough space? How does it compare to what you have now?
Dec 23, 2019 7:06pm
It's larger than I want, but it's a very good deal. Everything else at the same price point is much smaller.
Dec 23, 2019 7:08pm
It looks nice.
Dec 23, 2019 7:08pm
If I could drop down to $1200/month, I would.
Dec 23, 2019 7:08pm
Just hearing you drop that price reminds me that weâ€™re getting ripped off in this apartment. ðŸ˜‚
Dec 23, 2019 7:10pm
Thatâ€™s exciting though! I hope we can come see it ourselves sometime next year. ðŸ‘€
Dec 23, 2019 7:10pm
yeah, would be awesome
Dec 23, 2019 7:11pm
more room, so you should definitely just stay with us\
Dec 23, 2019 7:11pm
Itâ€™s a date
Dec 23, 2019 7:13pm

Dec 23, 2019 7:13pm
Merry Christmas [[h0p3]] <3
Dec 25, 2019 3:22pm

Dec 25, 2019 7:30pm

Dec 25, 2019 8:00pm

Dec 25, 2019 8:01pm
It's been a good day.
Dec 25, 2019 8:01pm
