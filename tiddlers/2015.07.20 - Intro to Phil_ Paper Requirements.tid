title: 2015.07.20 - Intro to Phil: Paper Requirements

General Requirements:

    Papers will be 7-10 pages, double-spaced, no added space between paragraphs or text, using size-12 font Times New Romans, with 1” margins, pagination, in .docx or .pdf file-formatting. Both a title page and bibliography are required (these aren’t included in the 7-10 page-count).

    You will submit a digital copy of your paper (used to check for plagiarism and formatting) by 6:00pm on August 10th.

    You’ll obviously need to follow standard analytic writing requirements. An appropriate introduction, body, and conclusion are required. Effective transitions, proper spelling, correct grammar, and fitting syntax are expected, etc.


Step 1 – Explain your target’s argument

    Explain the steps of their argument. Explain the conclusion and the implications of it from the target’s point of view. Show how the premises are meant to support the conclusion through exegesis (a careful examination and interpretation of a text).

    Your exegesis should be a very crisp, well-rehearsed, concise explanation of your target’s views. Use citations, and use quotes when necessary to demonstrate the target’s views. Do not strawman; be charitable. Do not import your own ideas or notions unless you are forced to fill in gaps, and if you do, then explicitly state it and be charitable! If something is unclear to you (which may signal that your target argument has options), you should point it out. Make your target’s view look good, and do it in a compact way.

Step 2 – Show a problem with the target’s argument

    After you’ve made the target argument look good, then you need to demonstrate a problem with the target view. This should be well-crafted, and it must point out a significant flaw. That flaw may cascade into lots of problems. Point out the implications of the flaw.

    There are many possible problems for an argument. Common problems include:

        Faulty or unreasonable assumptions necessary for the premises to be true.

            Sometimes you’ll find definitions or requirements embedded in the premises that we don’t have to or shouldn’t accept as readers.

        Faulty inferences between the premises and intermediate or final conclusions.

            Sometimes this is because of an unexplained gap in reasoning.

            Uncommonly, this is because the author makes an awful inferential move in the first place.

        Intolerable consequences of the conclusion

            Perhaps there are unacceptable consequences of the conclusion which the author didn’t realize. Maybe the consequences are ugly enough that the author would have given up the argument if they had only known of these consequences (probably not, but you never know!).

Step 3 – Show how your target would respond to your criticism

    Provide a charitable interpretation of how your target would respond and argue against your claim. Is there a way out for your target? In attempting to construct a rebuttal to your claim, you will be showing me that you have a mastery of the general perspective your target brings to the table, but also an awareness of the weaknesses in your own claim.
