title: 2019.03.21 - Prompted Introspection: Helping The Environment

!! Do you actively change your habits and behaviors to help the environment? What kinds of things do you do?

To my dismay, some of the points which the rightwingers make are correct here. I favor nuclear energy, containing trash in dumps (with significant safety measures), and recognizing the actual inefficiencies and carbon non-neutrality of recycling. I'm radically in favor of alternative and decentralized energy sourcing and infrastructure, attempting to reverse global warming's climb, and planting as many fucking trees as possible. I am opposed to pollution, and that means we have to pollute wisely.

Most of my environmental work is tangential. I have a philosophical and political crisis I shoot for.
