title: 2019.11.09 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Where He Stands

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands, even if he's wrong, than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil.

Unreserved honesty can be incredibly expensive. Even masks and how we swap them are [[SO]] masks, but they empirically tell us something about the thing-in-itself, even without certainty. Morally justified deception is an incredibly hard problem, the sort which makes me sick to my stomach. I will agree that deception is Reasonable, morally obligated (not just permissible) in some cases, and hence merits respect. Even angels must sometimes wear cloaks. Rather, it is easier to respect someone for their honesty, insofar as we can believe they are being honest, and so forth. In the ultimate analysis, however, honest devils need not be more respected than deceptive angels. I admire when people aim to legitimately take the stand to tell us where they stand in whatever form is necessary (often for reasons I do not understand).
