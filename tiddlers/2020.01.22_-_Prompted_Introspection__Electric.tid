title: 2020.01.22 - Prompted Introspection: Electric

!! I wish there was an electric??

~~A maximally morally virtuous [[TPK]] which brought forth equality in opportunity and (to whatever extent is possibly justified) outcomes for persons on the planet urf.~~ 2EZ. There are too many electronic tools that I know we need (though, getting people to use them is another matter entirely). The question has that magical Steampunk Targeted Individual Clarke's Law anything is paranoically possible in the mysterious art of technology thing going on. Meh. Are you asking me what I hope to mechanize in my life? Half of the electronic bullshit I do is something I wish was simplified for me, lol. I'm almost a luddite in some respects, as I don't want electricity in fucking everything (nor turing machines, nor network connections, nor cameras, and so forth). 

Alright, alright, I'm supposed to nearly invent something here so we can rapidly prototype it in Shenzhen, right? A robot which gave massages that felt like human contact (and I don't mean those lame mechanical masturbators which have never feel as good as your own fucking hand). I don't know. It's the wrong question.
