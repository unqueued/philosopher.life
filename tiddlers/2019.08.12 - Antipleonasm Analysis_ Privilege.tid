title: 2019.08.12 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Privilege

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Privilege is the greatest enemy of right.
<<<

Preach, yo! Centralized [[power]] [[irwrongfrr]] is the greatest enemy of [[The Moral Law]]. [[Power]] tends to centralize into the hands of the privileged few who elect not to exercise [[The Golden Rule]] all the way down. It is here that Saint Marx has failed. His denial of metaphysics and metaethics, a denial of [[faith]] in justification [[itself]], gives way to incoherent foundationlessness. There is no discussion of "ought" to be had; his prescriptions fail the Humean test because he has not bitten the Platonic-Kantian bullet. He has no right to speak of [[The Right]].

Note, again, that [[TOP]] is an exception. Emergent centralized power on top of decentralization [[irwartfrr]] is the only answer. What perspective will we privilege in The Rule of Law? Maximin [[power]] is fundamental to justice. When justice is served, blessed are the poor. May we all see ourselves as the lowest in calculating justice behind the [[VOI]].
