Been almost a week. How are you?

It's difficult to participate in your life from afar, so I keep knocking on the door.

I appreciate your check-ins, it’s always good to know you’re here. I’m doing okay? It was a good weekend definitely, which helps with the mental burden that is work. I know I have stayed too long now because I’m becoming bitter towards my boss. Every little thing she does wrong annoys me.

Oooooohhhhhh, I love this piano cover. It oozes mellow.
OCT 21 11:27 AM
I can appreciate that bitterness. I hope you find an escape soon. 
OCT 21 11:29 AM
I am actively seeking a new job, I just don’t have a ton of time to pour into lookin for them like I want to.
OCT 21 11:29 AM
I am reconsidering looking around inside Humana just to find that escape sooner.
OCT 21 11:29 AM
A mistake.
OCT 21 11:29 AM
I'll reaffirm searching out of that place.

The toughest part so far of applying is the amount of time it requires per application. All the research I’ve done is telling me that each job posting should have a tailored resume/cover letter and that is a tough ask. It’s gotten better though, I just have to get used to the process.

And I want to say before we get too far: thank you for letting me burden you with my weekly woes. I really do appreciate your check-ins. You always push me to think critically and wisely. It feels like a weekly reality check, and that’s something I unfortunately tend to avoid when I’m not in a great place emotionally.

Yeah, you are applying for jobs which have a higher barrier to entry, perhaps in a buyer's market. I'm not sure what kinds of feelers and places to watch/hear for open positions. It is quite time consuming. Will be a second job after your first.

My assumption is that you are in your yearly crunchtime, so the motivation to reason more thoroughly about the nature of your position there is higher (that is what anxiety does, perhaps with bitterness here; feels like you experience a semblance of the 5 stages of grief here). 
OCT 21 11:45 AM
I hope you don't lose that motivation after the crunch.

It might be worth shotgunning more than you have here. Do the detailed high-effort work for the engineer-esque jobs, but grind some more low effort options as well.
