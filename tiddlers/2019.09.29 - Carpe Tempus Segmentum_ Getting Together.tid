title: 2019.09.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Getting Together

* Woke at 8
** My god, man. Surely you cannot maintain this sanity.
*** I've been neglecting WoW in places I otherwise wouldn't. It's wonderful.
**** You've also been neglecting plenty of your duties too though!
* Read+Write
* Cleaning
* Setup dranks. Offspring helped me with le cooler.
** Ring it in.
* Wikis
** Except mine (unless they did while I slept).
* Party with [[Tasha]], Esteban, and Matthew.
** Drunk off my ass. I was shooting for 12 beers, but there's no fucking way. Think maybe 8? 
* Family Walk!
* One-on-one's
* Fell asleep, but then woke up to complete [[Family Log]].
* Sleep by 9?
