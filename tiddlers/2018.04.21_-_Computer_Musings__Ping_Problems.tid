title: 2018.04.21 - Computer Musings: Ping Problems

I can make HTTPS requests and surf just fine. I can ping everything inside my LAN. I can't ping anything outside the LAN. 

Found it.

Router pings fine. m10 pings 8.8.8.8 fine. ipv4 is fine, but ipv6 is not. DNS resolution problem.

This is extremely annoying. I've set it on the router and m10. I can't seem to force 8.8.8.8 and 2001:4860:4860::8888. 

I'm incompetent, and that's okay!

Oh jesus, KeepassXC has NOT been storing my data! That's it. I'm done. I will just store it by hand from now on. It's already insanely manual anyways. I had such high hopes for it. What a waste of my time!

Things are falling apart, and I'm annoyed.
