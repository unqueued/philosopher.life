title: 2018.09.17 - BAGD: Breadcrumbs

Please use the i3 script and the browser extension to quickly push links from the web into your wikis. Find ways to give evidence of your effort! You need to leave the breadcrumbs and trails. Part of the problem is that your web surfing histories are too rich, and you need to cut out the sections which matter to your project. We could compartmentalize from the browser, but I am increasingly convinced the correct answer is to transplant that work into the wiki. You do want this evidence for yourself and your parents.

My daughter decided to move into TW code for her practical projects alongside her JS theory. I feel like a real fucking idiot being unable to guide her here.
