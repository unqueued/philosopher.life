title: Donate to Build A Corpus

Think long term here. If you wanted to build AI, there is something unique about my corpus. There's a powerful representation/model here to look at. My snapshots are not useless to you in the least. The writing of this wiki can be reconstructed fairly well. There are good footholds that you won't find in other writing. It's designed to be computational and telic in a very serious way. I think we'd build a very interesting AI from this kind of corpus.
