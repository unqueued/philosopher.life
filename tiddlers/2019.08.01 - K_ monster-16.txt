Work and grocery shopping. Been spending too much time on XIV so I think I’m gonna take a break today and get some writing in. :) 

What do you all have on deck?

Sounds excellent. I hope your pantry and book are filled.

We are working on monster-16 today as a family.

She’s got this. She’s awesome! ^_^

What’s monster-16 again?

My new machine. We are building the OS basically from scratch and having it take over served duties of other machines in the house.

Monthly audits in the wiki, schoolwork, son's having trouble getting wireless installed on arch, my daughter is migrating our wiki infrastructures to m16, and I have far more to do on m16 as well. May be setting up passthrough now that I have more than one PCI-E slot and foregoing m10 as a machine altogether.
