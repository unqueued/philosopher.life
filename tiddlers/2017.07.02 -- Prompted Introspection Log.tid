!! What did you most enjoy doing this week?

I had an amazing time with my family. It's difficult to choose anything. If I had to, I would say taking my brother to my shop. We've talked about it for 6 months, and he finally got to see what I've been doing. It was great to bring those conversations alive. It's really great to connect on it in this way.
