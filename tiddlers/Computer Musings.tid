There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors.<<ref "1">>

[[Computing]] is one of the oldest projects on this wiki. Even before I understood that I would be logifying many of my projects (or parts of them), before [[Computer Musings]] officially existed, I was writing articles for it. Clearly, I've not written a ton here, but I think this will snowball. It's interesting none-the-less.

Here I sweat the small stuff.

!! Principles:

* Gather your writings on silicon computing here.
* Transclude where appropriate.

!! Dreams:

* Consider finding a way to transclude or merge my musings about computers from other logs into here. Many places have a lot of overlap. I could, of course, just go by tags.
** This really does look more and more like a tag problem.
