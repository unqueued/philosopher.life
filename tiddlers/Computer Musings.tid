[[Computing]] is one of the oldest projects on this wiki. Even before I understood that I would be logifying parts of many of my projects, before [[Computer Musings]] officially existed, I was writing notes for it. Here I record progress, mishaps, administration logs, and random thoughts about computing which I didn't leave in [[/b/]] or elsewhere. There's always work to do on our computer farms. I don't push hard at it, but I still take it seriously.

This is one of my lifelong hobbies. I work on my computers. Lots of dudes tool around the house, but I spend a non-trivial portion of my tinkering time and energy on my family's computing infrastructure. This is a useful game for me, and it's important that my children learn how to do it as well. I hope I never become jaded about computing in such a way that I only see it as a chore to be avoided rather than a joyous practice integrated into my identity.
