title: 2019.11.01 - Computer Musings: FF Safemode

Had to jump into FFDE for a bit as I'm figuring out which addon is breaking FF. At least one does not scale up nicely recently, and I have no idea why. Thank goodness for safemode. Appears one of the session tools is the most likely culprit. It's not burning a lot of resources despite huge freezes and crashes.
