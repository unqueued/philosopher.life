title: 2017.12.06 - Computer Musings: Making W10 Liveable For My Wife

I installed:

* Resilio Sync
* Bitvise SSH/SFTP Client
** Setup basic profile for her
* Sublime Text
* HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool
** Because it's a library, and this is a very unique tool that solves problems others won't be able to.
* No Machine
* 7-zip
* CCleaner
* Everything
* Find and Replace
* Synkron
** Because she should automate file transfers, backups, etc.

I also installed a wireless adapter to connect to the Guest network. The ethernet connection is firewalled, preventing access to the DHT entirely (ridiculous!), but the wireless does not. I tried Forcebinding, but the anti-malware wasn't letting me (tried several routes). I found out that Resilio powerfully has this feature built-in:

I'm having my daughter poke a hole in our router for my wife to SSH into her laptop remotely, the same for NoMachine.

I also tried to turn on dev mode to startup the built-in linux subsystem. The machine took 30 minutes of continual rebooting. It's slow as fuck, and I was claiming it was the HDD (not an SSD, my only hardware complaint). Eventually, I was able to prove it to her when we logged in. I believe this problem should be worked out by tomorrow, but we will see. My wife is unhappy that her computer appears slower at the moment than it was. I think she is freaking out like I've broken something. It's her shiny new toy, and I get that. I also know what I did.
