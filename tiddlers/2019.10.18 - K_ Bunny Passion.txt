You too, homie.
SEP 16 11:03 AM
What do you anticipate for today?
SEP 16 11:03 AM
A good writing class and a boring sci-fi one. Haha
SEP 16 11:05 AM
One for two thus far. :D
SEP 16 3:27 PM
And a boring sci-fi one. Lmao.
SEP 16 5:34 PM
That's a shame. You'd think sci-fi would be the most fun and interesting of the classes.
SEP 16 6:07 PM
Have a great day you all!
SEP 18 10:53 AM
On the off chance everyone can see. :)
SEP 18 10:54 AM
Old English is 100% a bunny class. Iâ€™m shocked.
SEP 18 10:55 AM
Haha =) yeah, notifications pop up for everyone
SEP 18 11:55 AM
I hope you have a great one too.
SEP 18 11:55 AM
It's awesome to have a bunny class.
SEP 18 11:55 AM
He doesnâ€™t even want our homework and isnâ€™t grading attendance. We have the midterm and final.
SEP 18 11:55 AM
Which means if we actually learn the language, weâ€™ll get an A.
SEP 18 11:56 AM
Hahaha
SEP 18 11:56 AM
Sounds like real class.
SEP 18 11:56 AM
He has such a passion for the language. Heâ€™s easily one of my all time favorite professors.
SEP 18 11:56 AM
Weâ€™re FINALLY getting to our books in sci fi today. I think Iâ€™ll know for sure today if this class was worth it or not
SEP 18 11:58 AM
Have a wonderful day today
SEP 19 9:53 AM
So how's the sci-fi book part of the class going?  Worth it?
SEP 19 10:55 AM
The last pantheon is a really cool book so far. Yeah itâ€™s fun.
SEP 19 10:56 AM
Good.
SEP 19 10:59 AM
Easy for books to trump B-rated movies, thankfully.
SEP 19 10:59 AM
Truly. I can work with this.
SEP 19 11:07 AM
Haha
SEP 19 11:07 AM
How are you?
SEP 19 11:07 AM
Reading and writing, mostly.
