title: 2020.03.28 - chameleon: Interpreting

"""
[3:45 PM] chameleon: Your wife, eh? Not sure how you mean by interpreting me :wink:
[3:45 PM] chameleon: also, sorry I didn't reply yesterday. tiredness had me out of spoons
[3:46 PM] h0p3: Naw, no worries. Hopefully, you got a reset!
[3:46 PM] h0p3: I have to do that sometimes too.
[3:46 PM] chameleon: I'd slept two hours in 24 haha. Yeah, I went to bed at 9, woke up at 4, talked tulpas with SaltyFox, then went to sleep again at 5 until 1pm :slight_smile:
[3:47 PM] h0p3: I'm glad you got a solid crash in.
[3:47 PM] chameleon: I'm sure I had a dream, but I don't remember it
[3:47 PM] chameleon: oh, wait, something about south-american druglords. would've made a great movie
[3:48 PM] h0p3: :slight_smile:
[3:48 PM] h0p3: By interpreting, I mean that I didn't understand what you were saying well enough, and I often rely upon other people to help me understand what someone is saying. It's one of the ways that I try to make up for my autistic deficiency.
[3:48 PM] chameleon: also tunnels and trolls, for some reason, lol
[3:48 PM] h0p3: I wish I could remember my dreams.
[3:48 PM] chameleon: ahhh! fair enough
[3:48 PM] chameleon: I've not interected much with your wife yet (almost wrote waifu :sweats: )
[3:50 PM] h0p3: She's quiet. I spend more time online with people than she does (except for her work at the moment).
[3:53 PM] h0p3: She doesn't seem to spend much time with my friends. She is easily drained of her spoons and often does best to recuperate on the couch with her book or computer. But, I hope you all do interact way more.
[3:55 PM] h0p3: You seem fairly extraverted. Is The Abyssal as extraverted as you are?
[3:55 PM] chameleon: I'm more introverted than I seem :wink: I'm just good at interacting online
[3:55 PM] chameleon: socializing IRL is a lot harder for me
[3:56 PM] chameleon: he's the same as me, really. though he seems less likely to interact with people online even, these days. I guess his job eats up his spoons (his gas station regulars often greet him when we're out and about, by name!)
[3:57 PM] h0p3: I can appreciate that. Interacting with people all day is so expensive. Cool that they recognize him.
[4:00 PM] chameleon: he's very tired when he gets home most days. just wants to have a footrub, play some vidya, watch dragonball, and go to bed. haha
[4:01 PM] h0p3: Ha, that is outstanding. Solid way to relax.
[4:01 PM] h0p3: Also, I found a genius to speak with (she's probably going to fucking hate me): http://anti-dialectics.co.uk/
[4:02 PM] h0p3: Fierce, straight-up mean (to the point that it's hilarious), and solid argumentation in many sections.
[4:03 PM] chameleon: looks like timecube but for hegel :wink:
[4:03 PM] chameleon: lovely hehe
[4:03 PM] h0p3: Yes! lol
[4:05 PM] chameleon: anti-stalinism, too
[4:05 PM] chameleon: good
[4:05 PM] h0p3: She pushes for a physicalist interpretation of Marxism with great force.
[4:06 PM] h0p3: Aye, she also aims to defend her view of Marxism against standard attacks on the way too.
[4:10 PM] h0p3: Most of the analytic philosophers I know despise Hegel (although, they also despise Marx). She's a Wittgensteinian physicalist peeling them apart.
[4:10 PM] h0p3: (from what I can tell)
