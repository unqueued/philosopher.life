title: 2019.11.09 - TDL: With Family

* Family Time!
** We missed our family walk, and your offspring are especially keen on one-on-ones. I think we should try to open with one-on-ones then.
* Pizza? Cheap, fast, delicious, treat.
* House is clean enough (though the upstairs isn't great). Maybe we should get boxes and slowly accumulate the rooms. Two boxes a week would go a long way.
* Plenty to write, links to dump. 
** I think that yearly audit may have to wait, and, of course, [[The Remodeling]] has been a joke for so long now, lol.
