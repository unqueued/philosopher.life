title: 2018.01.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: Courageous

!! Who is one of the most courageous people you have ever met? Why?

Courage is a virtue between two vices per context. Virtuously courageous individuals are virtuous in all contexts; they have the right amount of courage, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, and so on and so forth.<<ref "2019.03.22">> Courage is highly particularized in our codification. Furthermore, it is very likely the case that the virtues have a significant unity to them. I think you are asking me about the most virtuous person I know.

Let me pose it to you this way: I don't know what I don't know. It is not an unacceptable ad hominem to say that the vicious agent doesn't understand who or what is virtuous because he is vicious. Thus, when I say I don't know what I don't know, if you are to assume I am not the virtuous agent, then it may be unreasonable to expect me to have an accurate answer. The most courageous person I know might actually be vicious. 

Further, I want to distinguish an instance of courageous behavior from having the disposition to do the courageous act (which does not include the maxim) in an instance, from having a sufficiently courageous disposition in an instance, from having the consistently courageous disposition long-term over many instances, and so on. 

Furthermore, I'm convinced that it is possible the most courageous people I know haven't actually done anything particularly courageous. Maybe they were never put in a circumstance that required a strong expression of it.

That said, the question is not stupid, it just doesn't pack the punch we'd hoped it would. 

I suppose I would say my wife. That woman has been through a lot of pain, and she often doesn't fear pain or death from having so much experience.<<ref "2019.03.22-1">>
