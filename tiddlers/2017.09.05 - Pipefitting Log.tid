title: 2017.09.05 - Pipefitting Log

No laptop today, which sucks. I am truly bottlenecked. I had considered a Bluetooth keyboard, but I don't think my bosses are going to view it rationally. Literacy scares them. No headphones means no music I can hear nicely either. Lunch break is my time. I consider this a violation of basic labor rights.

When I arrived, people were concerned about another rain out. The bosses say we work through rain, to ignore our OSHA rights, but they don't like getting wet and then they finally start rationalizing their way back to their liabilities. Might be thunder today. I will follow my journeyman. It is hard to fault me for doing what he does, although they still might.

I keep arriving with more bags. I brought a few more tools today. Slowly, I accumulate what is required for the job. I am hoping that if I look like a duck, quack like a duck, and work like a duck, they'll call me a duck: a journeyman worth $28/hour. There is definitely a responsibility tradeoff here, but I think the stress is worth it.

They talked about sports ball this morning. I have nothing to say. As usual, I still have no idea how to connect with these people. Admittedly, I am feeling most anxious today. I don't know why.

I organized my tools, and decided to give my harness back to the tool room (still may have my number associated with it anyways). In any case, I have no room for it now, and I want to minimize my chances of going up. Having it always ready is a bad idea.

I found the centerlines on the side of the supply header and the tie-in points. They needed to use a tripod to check elevation, I think. The center finder bit me something hard today (nasty blood blister), but it was very useful, even at 90 degrees. The level and tape measure trick I was told to use on the header gave me 1/2" difference off the weld. 

I rigged the side of the header parked at 290.

I added cribbing to the header next to the railroad tracks.

I rigged the flange for 290.

I used a fulcrum to move pipe off the 290 header. 

I did the tether-rigging work over at 291 since I was asked by Chad.

!! Break!

More rigging on the flange.

I rolled the header nipple with cribbing to 290 and did a bit of fitting up. We then eventually did the full fit up. I was in charge of torque, and I had to stamp my name on it.

I got the reducer in place, rolled and jimmied it as well. 

I got in an argument with Brandon about the two-hole. he wanted to level the header first. I explained why we need not. He ignored me. Everyone else arrived at my conclusion.

!! Lunch!

It started raining. I'm very grateful for having picked up a nylon-based water resistant and breathable rain suit.

Chris-M set me in charge of the flange, but then we worked together. Chris-M loved my protractor, and he says he is getting one.

I helped Chris-M with some layout marks, or at least I tried to.

We finally got rigger on the header. We got it fit up.

Brandon and I continued our disagreement in another fashion, in particular, on the value of the protractor. he continues to trust the level as his sole source of information.

Brandon didn't understand that it was even possible to two-hole without going level. Pardon me for questioning his knowledge here. He kept telling me it was useless. I think he is figuring out that I disagree and don't want what he thinks. I told him I was "just curious" to give him a way out. 

!! Break!

Thunder and lightning. They called the work day off.
