title: 2018.06.17 -- Prompted Introspection: Depressed Best Friend

!! If your best friend came to you depressed and upset like you've never seen before, how would you react?

My best friends have come to me depressed. In fact, I'm often the one who is thinking alongside them, trying to understand it. They do the same for me. I take it to be my goal to empathize with them, feel their feelings, see their point of view, and attempt to find functional responses. I do my best not to be judgmental (which, as you know, is borderline impossible for me). 

If they were more depressed than I've ever seen, they'd probably be on the verge of ending their lives. I'd drop whatever I was doing to be with them. I would plead with them. I would remind them, reason with them, and attempt to give them hope.

Admittedly, I'm probably really bad at this. In fact, from what I can tell, my point of view is often a catalyst or reagent for despair and depression. I'm constantly forcing us to look in the existential mirror. 

This reminds me of my cousin L. In the end, she does not want to face up to the fact that she has spent 5 hard years of her life prepping to be a psychopath. She knowingly works in a machine that kills thousands of people a year, lobbying to maximize their profits and prevent single-payer healthcare, etc. She doesn't try escape it, and she hasn't made serious moves to not be committing evils acts. Obviously, I say it much more indirectly and kindly to her. She has stopped talking to me, which is her choice. In the end, someone has to tell her the truth.
