I believe it.

I don't know why it's out of whack. I'm not just sleeping correctly.

Doesn't matter though. Life is good otherwise.
SAT 11:59 PM

SAT 11:59 PM

Been applying to lots of jobs. No jobs have fallen from the job tree yet. I hope they taste like pears.
SAT 11:59 PM
lol
SAT 11:59 PM
i hope something comes along soon.
38 MIN AGO
I am socializing tomorrow. Neighbors invited us over for a dinner-party (super casual, which is my preference).
38 MIN AGO
nice!
37 MIN AGO
Scroll up and check that E.T. art out.
37 MIN AGO
I think the top image is the most beautiful piece of ASCII art I've ever seen.
37 MIN AGO
i saw it. is fucking cool dude. did you do that or put it through a program?
37 MIN AGO
Program! Still have to prep the image and play with it in the program.
36 MIN AGO
I would not waste my time doing it by hand, lol.
36 MIN AGO
Though, my children would probably enjoy doing that.
36 MIN AGO
i could see that
35 MIN AGO
i like that hes wearing the Alien costume
35 MIN AGO
he's
35 MIN AGO
So, how's life going for you? How's work?
34 MIN AGO
found out i get a second paid vacation if i want
33 MIN AGO
Good.
33 MIN AGO
found out a manager i don't care for has put her two week notice in
32 MIN AGO
Praise jebus
32 MIN AGO
:man-raising-hand:
31 MIN AGO
lol
31 MIN AGO
i broke down and bought my self a new trimmer
31 MIN AGO
iv been holding off on it but i cant take the hair being pulled out instead of being cut anymore lol
30 MIN AGO
i got a nice one this time so hopefully it will last longer
30 MIN AGO
I fucking hate when it pulls my hair.
29 MIN AGO
I hope it lasts too.
29 MIN AGO
The one we've got now has lasted maybe 2 years. That's like...a record or something.
29 MIN AGO
yeah.and it always pulls in the worst spot like right near the edge of the mouth or upper lip
29 MIN AGO
https://www.amazon.com/Wahl-Stainless-Rechargeable-Professionals-9818/dp/B0058SY1XQ
26 MIN AGO
doubles as an anal vibrator
26 MIN AGO
it its the spot just right lol
25 MIN AGO
lol
25 MIN AGO
i i looked up how to  vlc media player on the comp and learnd how to use the sudo thing
24 MIN AGO
that was pretty cool
23 MIN AGO
You are officially system administrator
23 MIN AGO
/high5
23 MIN AGO
(you should still ask for help whenever you want it)
23 MIN AGO
i will. but i figured this would be a simple thing to find info on on the interwebs
22 MIN AGO
indeed
20 MIN AGO
far more satisfying to DIY
20 MIN AGO
that's awesome
20 MIN AGO
Oh, I didn't get OCR set for you yet
20 MIN AGO
I'm sorry.
20 MIN AGO
It's been crazy.
20 MIN AGO
wait, I did send you one thing about it
20 MIN AGO
Muh brain hurts
19 MIN AGO
lol
19 MIN AGO
Gonna be interesting to see the in-laws. Politics, religion, ethics, philosophy...you know, everything of value, is off limits for discussion.
19 MIN AGO
yeah. that sucks
18 MIN AGO
My goal is to be there with [[k0sh3k]] every step of the day to run interference. I want to make sure they treat her fairly in the dialectic. They tend to be silent when I'm in the room (which is only fair if they expect her to do so).
18 MIN AGO
She starts to mentally breakdown when she has to do it alone.
17 MIN AGO
I didn't know it was that bad
17 MIN AGO
why go then?
17 MIN AGO
Well, it's generally pleasant, and we are glad to see them.
16 MIN AGO
We are, in the end, there to see [[R]].
15 MIN AGO
ahh im curious of how they speak to her? do they just put her down or are they now intelligent enough to keep up with her?
15 MIN AGO
not*
15 MIN AGO
or is it more like they don't care to hear what she has to say?
14 MIN AGO
[[R]] avoids the confrontation outright in general. I think she knows she's outgunned, though she has no idea to what extent. [[C]] is generally the problem. He suffers from serious mental disorders (and quite understandably).
13 MIN AGO
interesting
13 MIN AGO
[[C]] does not respect women. He is trapped as an anti-intellectual who thinks he's more intelligent than actual intellectuals (even though, I'd argue, we are fairly down to Earth).
13 MIN AGO
But, he plays by the rules when I'm in the room.
12 MIN AGO
:nauseated_face:
11 MIN AGO
I don't think i could be around him
11 MIN AGO
I think he does fine with me and the kids.
11 MIN AGO
But, yeah, pretty infuriating with [[k0sh3k]].
10 MIN AGO
how does he treat [[R]]
10 MIN AGO
Still, I anticipate it will be a pleasant Thanksgiving.
10 MIN AGO
He treats her like shit.
10 MIN AGO
Straight up abusive.
10 MIN AGO
what the fuck
10 MIN AGO
why stay? i mean im sure it has to do with her faith but i hope thats not the main cause
9 MIN AGO
I will say, however, he does love [[R]] (just not effectively enough).
9 MIN AGO
sure but still he's a prick
8 MIN AGO
We aim to maintain the relationship, to do our best, and because it isn't awful.
8 MIN AGO
I think he suffers from borderline personality disorder.
8 MIN AGO
And, it is clear that he does care about humans in some important respects.
8 MIN AGO
He is a splintered man.
7 MIN AGO
fair enough
7 MIN AGO
I'm bringing him beer as a gift.
7 MIN AGO
lol
7 MIN AGO
MEN gifts
6 MIN AGO
lol
6 MIN AGO
yeah
6 MIN AGO
He is proud of not owning anything, but in reality relies upon [[R]] actually owning everything necessary for subsistence. Makes it hard to shop for him.
6 MIN AGO
But, he likes beer, and he shares his beer with me. I think it's a decent way to reciprocate.
5 MIN AGO
By the way, I was feeling lonely this evening, and you totally made me feel NOT lonely tonight. /hug
4 MIN AGO
sounds like a interesting yet frustrating man
4 MIN AGO
Indeed
4 MIN AGO
I am one of those too, so I feel like I should cut him even extra slack.
4 MIN AGO
i am biased  towards you
2 MIN AGO
so  i don't think you are
2 MIN AGO
Yay, I like bias that favors me! =)
1 MIN AGO
lol
1 MIN AGO
hey im gonna get of here and eat dinner and then head to bed
1 MIN AGO
Night, sleep well. Love you.
1 MIN AGO
2 UNREAD MESSAGES
I love you!
1 MIN AGO

NOW
