title: 2018.03.14 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Socialism

!! What's the first step you can take to making a difference in the world today? Would you try to feed the hungry, improve the environment, promote peace? How would you start?

This topic is extremely important to me. I'm being driven insane trying to answer it. I want to first start out by distinguishing what is possible (what I morally expect) from what is plausible (what I predict). The gap, for me, is gargantuan. I think the world is far more evil than almost anyone I know; I think people are fundamentally evil. I also see who we could be. I think it is logically and even physically possible for us to be radically good. 

I must constantly remind myself that I am not in control. It's not up to me. I am powerless. Bridging the gap is not for me to decide, but rather something which requires the concerted effort of every human on the planet. Given the nature of the prisoner's dilemma, I can guarantee it won't happen. Of course, you then go on to say that I must lower my bar given the facts of my prediction. I have to be more consequentialist and Bayesian in my reasoning. The game is already lost when I use that. Seriously, there's no point to even trying. I know we are going to fail as a species. I can't use that bar anymore. I have to fight the good fight knowing damned well I'm going to lose in our epic tragedy (I'd like to offer a sincere 'fuck you' to the rest of humanity).

The stoic will tell me that I must use the prediction bar if I am to be happy. Well, which is it, am I going to be moral or happy? Do you really think that is a false dichotomy? You aren't paying attention; you are talented at rationalizing into convenient selfishness.

The obvious answer is socialism. Decentralizing power in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, and so on. How do you convince brainwashed people in The Matrix that they are living in an experience machine? How do you motivate people to not be tribalist, selfish, and rational? i.e. How do you convince people not to be themselves? How do you get someone to honestly consider the possibility that they are a terrible person? How do you teach people whose minds have crystallized to the point that they can't unlearn their vicious reality maps? How do you convince people that allowing psychopaths to enslave us is not the only option (if you can even convince them that psychopaths really are in charge at all<<ref "1">>)? How do ensure people cooperate and alleviate the risks of even a small percentage of people choosing not to cooperate? How do you ensure people have engaged in The Great Human Conversation, appreciate the lessons of history, and spend their leisure time in philosophical pursuits? 

I can't do these things. I'm hoping to start with [[Outopos]]. A digital tool built on the right foundation may provide the necessary safe haven we need to survive the ultra-centralized power we're spiralling into more and more. 

I'd like to give a quick shoutout to the Boomers. Please, burn in hell.

<<footnotes "1" "Even my own wife is too horrified by the notion to take seriously its possibility. The evidence is all around her, and at times, she sees The Matrix for what it is. Most of the time, she can't maintain mental stability while recognizing the truth for what it is. I don't blame her, at least not fully. It's horrifying.">>
