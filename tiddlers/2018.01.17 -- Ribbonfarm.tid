As Shaw said, “The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him. The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself. All progress depends on the unreasonable man.”

His 2x2 square stereotypes aren't working for me. I have a lot of questions. That said, I also don't feel like I fit nicely into his model either. I'm pessimistic good for prescription and pessimistic evil for description. But, even that seems an oversimplification. This reminds me greatly of the 2x2 of Political Freedom Squares (and perhaps other poor x,y axis attempts).

Realism is a way of viewing the world, pragmatism is the related way of acting within it.

Realism is descriptive, pragmatism is prescriptive (even if only self-prescribing). What isn't realism on his view? If pragmatism is prescriptive, does he have a vice on either side of it, or does he simply mean wisdom tout court?

I resolve this particular dichotomy by thinking of realism as a desire to see the world realistically, and pragmatism as a desire to be effective. Believing you have achieved either desire is probably a sign that you’re actually trapped within one of the quadrants. It is skepticism and doubt that mark sophisticated realism and pragmatism, and distinguish them from quadrant-locked attitudes and behaviors.

I find this bizarre (and perhaps he has an effective ad hominem against me). I tend to couple realism and pragmatism together. I think to the extent you are one, you are the other. Why should I think they peel apart? 

For me, idealism is what must be compared to the other side. Of course, I don't hold that hard and fast all the way down. This is why you see me talk about the ideally-practical and the practically-ideal through the wiki. There is a kind of oscillating bootstrap all the way down for defining this, and I don't have the language tools to even explain it to myself.
