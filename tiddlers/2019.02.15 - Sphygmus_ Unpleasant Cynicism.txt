It is not pleasant being cynical, for sure. I was thinking about an apocalypse machine the other day - what's the most minimal yet useful computer that could be built to run on a single portable solar panel or something similar? What would be most useful to have installed? (what even are the logistics of survival if the grid and food supply break down -- as a whole, we are so far removed from sustaining ourselves on the land -- yet even if we were skilled at hand sustenance climate change makes the land itself unreliable...)

10k books, 10GB of [[Music: Library]], and some wikis...that's all I'm asking. Please, solar panel, SSDs, and redundant hardware: you've gotta last me for the rest of my miserable life after the apocalypse.

Alright, so what has to be on your machine? The one you care so much about you'll use a hand-crank with one hand to generate power so you can type with the other on it.

I suppose this is a variant of the "what do you take with you to the lonely island?"
