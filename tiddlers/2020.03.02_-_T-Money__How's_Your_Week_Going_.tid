How's your week going?
Jan 29 12:58pm
Life has been a bit crazy. I hope you all are doing well?
Jan 29 7:09pm
Well enough. Still trying to get settled and what not, but the pieces are coming together. Allergies have been kicking my butt, but will see a doc soon.
Jan 29 7:10pm
That is good. How is [[k0sh3k]] liking the job?
Jan 29 7:14pm
Seems to fit her like a glove.
Jan 29 7:15pm
Really nice to be on call 24/7.
Jan 29 7:15pm
to not be*
Jan 29 7:15pm
Fuck yeah. That sounds terrible. I have turned down a few  aviation jobs because of that. 100% on call all the time shit.
Jan 29 7:16pm
Ugh, yeah. Complete bullshit.
Jan 29 7:16pm
But yeah. I've had lots of issues with the Berea apartment. Fleas, mice, roaches, refrigerator GFI socked tripped while I was gone. Lost about $100 worth of food. Haven't had a lot of relaxing time after work except when I drink. Haha
Jan 29 7:20pm
Fuck. That sucks.
Jan 29 7:20pm
I would be pissed off.
Jan 29 7:21pm
Landlord doing something about it?
Jan 29 7:22pm
At least it's only a 3 month lease. And yes. The real estate manager has been on top of it. Quickly and offered to cut the food costs off my next month's rent...
Jan 29 7:22pm
I'm looking to buy a home. I'm past the point of renting.
Jan 29 7:23pm
I can get alot of house for cheap in Berea. But as soon as you start moving north it doubles.
Jan 29 7:23pm
I like the town. Lived here nearly 5 years. Unfortunately the real estate manager is one of the biggest real estate agents in Berea. So, I'm having to be extra polite.
Jan 29 7:25pm
But I have photo evidence if they refuse my deposit. I'll go to small claims court. I've never done that. I'll do it just for the experience.
Jan 29 7:25pm
Lol
Jan 29 7:26pm
Lol
Jan 29 7:26pm
Yeah, sounds kinda shady on their end. =/
Jan 29 7:26pm
She's super nice. I think the bugs is really a result of bad neighbors. Who are recent move ins.
Jan 29 7:26pm
There is a buzzard roost tree in the back yard. Been there since I moved in.  Creepy af.
