title: 2019.12.15 - Prompted Introspection: Feeling of Wrong

!! How do you feel when you do something wrong?

Far too lenient in [[2018.02.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: Doing Something Wrong]]. 

While I am doing something wrong, I may not even care that it is wrong. I can have wildly mixed feelings as well. I may not even feel it was wrong. That can be part of the wrongness of it too. Feeling is not enough, and the sad philanthropist is the best example. The wrongness of lacking the fitting sensibility is not something over which I might have immediate control, but at least some of the time I am responsible for not having habituated the fitting feelings for such a moment. My feelings about what I've done wrong can evolve over time as well.
