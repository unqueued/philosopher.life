title: 2019.04.04 - Afterschool Teaching: Simple

Pretty normal. Matt asked for Whitney to be with him, but 5th continues to grow and the other grades shrink. It is now categorically easier to handle the older kids at this point. I'm fine taking the hard section, but I would like labor to be distributed fairly. Matt had to walk away, but he came back with the right attitude after (offering to put me in charge, which I deferred back to him); he needs better arguments and reasoning here.

I actually yelled today. 5HS needed major help on her math, and they wouldn't give us the chance. Most of the kids are getting destroyed on this packet, and they should pay attention. She's actually trying, and I'm trying to teach it. Yes, some of these kids are turning into garbage (odds are very high). 

I played chess with a bunch of girls. I sat in the gym and talked with folks. 

I listened to 8Hm's mother speak with Delp about the lie and their lives. She is a troubled woman, and he is a troubled boy. I am glad he is here.

Everyone is happy 5HS is here too. Whatever has happened must be a catastrophe. She has almost no one.
