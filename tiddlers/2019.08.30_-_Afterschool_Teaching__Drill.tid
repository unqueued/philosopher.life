title: 2019.08.30 - Afterschool Teaching: Drill

Whitney is sticking it to the man being late. Cool beans. We talked school and testing. I'm trying to encourage her as best I can. I must sound like an arrogant sumbitch, of course.

5AN said she'd hug me but she's too sweaty for it. Lol. I am the last person one would hug (I look and smell homeless, ofc), so she caught me off guard. We have come a long way in a short period of time. That is likely temporary. 

5EN thanked me for speaking with him about his reading. He reads more than I knew. He puts me to shame with my own offspring. Go forth and kick ass, sir.

8L and I talked about her darkness. She's aware of the facades around her without having had to pay the prices my most impoverished students have (at least from what I can tell so far, unless...no). I'd be depressed and pissed off too, kid (oh wait, I am). She aint seen nothin' yet. I have no idea how to prepare her; it is easy to make the wrong choices in her shoes.

In some respects, I sound like a formulaic robot in how I approach my children. I'm hunting down the demons and cultivating the seeds I find. Sometimes we reframe. Some are honest, but the ones I'm worried about will often not speak up. One of my favorite aesthetic features of my conversations with my children is that I have the chance to throw them off balance in our wrestling by being familiar while paradoxically saying "yes, mam" or "sir" or "Mr. foobar," handing them honorifics they are forced to use with the authorities. I answer to whatever name they give me, usually my first (unless you say it the French way). The children around us parrot the novelty. I hope it fucks with their senses of the apparent normativity of social conventions and allows them to know I love them at the same time. I'm going stare you down with every ounce I have (which takes real concentration from an autist) and let you know I give a shit.

Delp signals he's annoyed that I'm not policing the crowd but instead doing my one-on-ones. Tough titties. 

5DB is doing much better. Ups and downs. Hopefully, he's normalizing some. He is hard to predict.

Firedrill turned out to be an expression of authority more than concern for children.

The library went well. My idiots have the unfortunate opportunity to be forced to sit next to me when they repeatedly elect not to behave in a kind manner (you poor bastards). I am a mean one, I tell you what.

Magic was a delight even with a dozen kids pulling my attention every 5 minutes; I'm a conductor of snippets. When I can afford to pay attention more socially in game, and when I know they can interpret it correctly: I get to shittalk and punk 'em out; it's great (ofc, we shake hands). I'm cool with the kids because I can guess the cards in their hands with regularity (despite their mistakes which should send me off track), and it's like a magic trick inside of magic. 6JR is even swearing a bit (cutely) because he knows he's not supposed to leak any information to me at all (which still isn't going to save him in the end). 7G joined us for a game. =) Her perfectionism is much wow. 

My wiki kids had to listen to me preach, the poor things. They are patient; I just can't shutup. We walked through different ways to host and distribute the wiki. We practiced markup. We discussed differences between OSes, discussed encryption, and attempted to reason about VPNs and building our own clouds. They looked at me like I'm crazy when I praised constantly searching the internet and using Wikipedia like a kneejerk curiosity; we have a long way to go. We talk psychology and virtue theory as well. I'm moving at a hundred miles an hour in our rabbitholes. I need more time, god damnit! I cannot cover enough ground with them; they are going to be annoyed by my redundancy too. I'm a broken record on some topics. I'm the only human telling them the truth in this regard though. I can only assume they will eventually give up on me. 

7G was pissed (or said she was) that she wasn't coming to school on Monday. What a beautifully fucked up kid. She wants to want to live in this prison. We talked about her responsibilities; and, she clearly has moral training in her. Good inferences. I shall teach her to rebel wisely yet! =) May I be a subversive memetic infection and a safehouse; may I have earned the right to be told I'm corrupting the youth by my betters (now step out of my [[Platonic sunlight|WWDD]], assholes).

Delp and I talked about the problems I had with my wife's college (his alma mater). He asked me what I thought was the biggest problem. I said they didn't practice what they preached; they really didn't care what Jesus said. I'd have far less of a problem with them if they did. Instead, it's an expensive opportunity-hoarding gated community for an incestuous good-ol' boys club which exists for bourgeois social networking, milking the capital of the alumni, and promoting clearly evil conceptions of Christianity in the name of providing a liberal arts education while providing the opposite. This is a breeding ground for capitalists and their lackeys. I have no fucking clue how, but Delp interpreted me to be saying they weren't conservative enough (ignoring my attempt to correct that huge mistake), and he reminisced about the good ol' days when women who weren't in their dorms by 6pm were subject to censure and had to have their parents come to speak with the administration about the unseemly behavior of their adult daughters. Kill me now, please.
