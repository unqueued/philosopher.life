I am committing to the cause -- I have taken my new laptop out of the house to work on my Wiki

Yay. I'm glad it is portable and working.
SEP 3 7:37 PM
I'm filling out the D&D part of my wiki because, oddly enough, that will be the easiest part for me to fill out. Plus, I adored using it for my other campaign, even temporarily, so I figured it would be excellent here as well.
SEP 3 7:48 PM
Fuck yeah.
SEP 3 7:49 PM
Makes good sense to work on something you enjoy.
SEP 3 7:49 PM
Remember that you can have multiples. We will learn how to peel them apart and put them back together as well.
SEP 3 7:49 PM
Yeah, but... that's what a table of contents is for. And tags.
SEP 3 7:51 PM
I am obviously ridiculously biased in trying to unify mine. I think it's a good idea too. =)
SEP 3 7:53 PM
But, it may eventually become something you want to do. For example, [[k0sh3k]]'s private wiki holds both private and public, but what is published is just that which is tagged "Public"
SEP 3 7:54 PM
Wiki will be sick for D&D
SEP 3 7:57 PM
I'll be interested to know how you to do it.
SEP 3 7:57 PM
That is probably what I will do, actually. I may have to ask [[k0sh3k]]/[[j3d1h]] how they did that.
SEP 3 8:00 PM
But I will get there.
SEP 3 8:00 PM
Aye, take your time.
SEP 3 8:01 PM
If I do it the same way I did my last one, it will be needlessly complicated so I can link EVERYTHING together. Wooooo.
SEP 3 8:03 PM
Did I ever show the previous one for Myriad?
SEP 3 8:04 PM
It's not up anymore so I can't show it to you, but even as small as it was I still loved it.
SEP 3 8:05 PM
Go ovaries out. =)
SEP 3 8:05 PM
No, I didn't see the one for Myriad.
SEP 3 8:05 PM
RIP
SEP 3 8:05 PM
I bet it was cool.
SEP 3 8:05 PM
Well when I get this one in a place not on my hardrive I will encourage you to dig through my D&D portion. 
SEP 3 8:06 PM
