title: 2019.02.06 - KevinKniveK: To h0p3

https://humdrum.life/2019/02/06/to%20%20h0p3

Good day sir. I was pleasantly surprised to see my name show up on your wonderful wiki.

Off-topic: That ''Kevin'' video from //Home Alone// used to be my 404 page. I should set that back up.

There’s a lot from your letter I want to touch on so I’m going to skip the pleasantries for now and get to it.

>    You make me think I’ll need to start more seriously setting up multi-stop shops to interpret others.

I don’t know if having multiple places is the right answer. It’s something I’ve gone back and fourth on for years, TIV is a few years old but HL is less than a month old. But, Kicks has me rethinking my current setup.

If I had to go to multiple places to follow you I’d be a little disappointed. This is part of the reason I do TIV post reviews on HL, so even though they are separate, HL still contains everything.

If you broke things off into other places, I’d hope it would still be fed to your wiki.

>    Thank you for providing a window into your tastes and media diet (a great phrase for it).

I got the phrase media diet from [[Jason Kottke|https://kottke.org/]], but in practice it more resembles Steven Soderbergh’s [[Seen, Read|http://extension765.com/soderblogh/33-seen-read-2018]] lists he releases on an annual basis.

>    I almost drunkenly cried to the Africa cover; it’s like being transported to the re-telling of part of my childhood. I wouldn’t have found this Weezer album without you. You make me feel happily old. Thanks! =)

I’m glad one of us likes it… My Recently page doesn’t necessarily mean I endorse what’s there. It’s literally just what I’ve recently heard/watched/read and I don’t always bat 100. I should probably point this out on the page. It probably gets even more confusing as it’s listed on my top ten albums due to the fact I’ve only listened to ten new albums thus far in 2019. With that being said, I’m glad you got enjoyment from it.

>    Why do you think Jim Jefferies is funny (if you do)?

He’s fine. With the current climate, I think it’s important for comedians to push people’s buttons; he does this fairly well. And I 100% agree with his take on guns.

>    How do you curate the links for your Link Log?

I don’t know I fully understand the question… I consume a lot in RSS and when I have something to say, I’ll write up a link post on TIV. That link tab is pretty much identical to the homepage since TIV is mostly link posts anyways, at least in the last few months.

>    What do you think about your now section?

I touched on this in my first note to Kicks, but it’s mostly an exercise in experimenting with Siri Shortcuts. Others have now pages with five or so bullet points, but that doesn’t seem to truly represent “now”. So I use my recently page for those five bullets.

>    Where would you point a fool to learn how to meditate?

I started with the app //Headspace//, using their guided Take 10 program over and over for free. Eventually, I was comfortable with silent meditations so I used the app Oak. I’m actually back on //Headspace//, paying for more than the Take 10 since they had a deal at $50 for a year.

But I really think //Headspace// is a great way to get started and take what feels useful, discard the rest.

>    You watch Star Trek as a kid? What are you thinking about Discovery?

Bits and pieces, but not as much as I would have liked. My mother is a huge Piccard fan, so I grew up with the original and TNG in the periphery. I’ve planned a rewatch of the original<<ref "1">>, and plan to get through it and every other Trek incarnation, but that feels like a multi-year<<ref "2">> process.

I like //Discovery// so far. It hasn’t stuck with me, which is why I’m still only through ten episodes despite starting episode one the second it was released.

>    Am I mistaken in getting the New Yorker vibe off you?

In what sense? I do currently have a subscription, but I cycle through publications on a regular basis since I can never read more than one at a time. Economist, NY Times, WaPo, Wired, and Rolling Stone are the regular publications I cycle through along with the New Yorker. I’d love to be subscribed to them all at once, but I can’t keep up with all that plus the internet and books, along with a multitude of other hobbies.

>    What are you thinking about the value of making nested lists?

I like them. I’m not exactly sure what this is in reference to if I’m being honest. But I’m a fan of outlines and like thinking in that form. I tried using OmniOutliner to draft posts at one point. I liked the creation aspect, but then getting it to a published form involved more steps than my usual workflow so I abandoned it.<<ref "3">>

>    I won’t press you too hard on robotics processing automation. I have plenty of questions.

It’s basically Siri Shortcuts for enterprise. It’s relatively new for me, as I come from a business/finance background.

//postscript//

I feel like there is more I want to say, but it’s been a long day for me, and I was excited to start a dialogue. When I have some time, I’ll have tons of questions for you because I find your wiki absolutely fascinating. In the meantime, I’d love to hear your thoughts/observations/questions on the above.<<ref "4">>

//postpostscript//

After writing this, I realized I don’t know how to get it to you, so hopefully you will stumble across it.
