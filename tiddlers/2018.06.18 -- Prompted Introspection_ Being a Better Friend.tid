title: 2018.06.18 -- Prompted Introspection: Being a Better Friend

!! In what ways do you sometimes wish to act to be a better friend, but don't? Why do you find yourself unable to do these things?

I'm bad at neurotypical "chilling out" and going with the flow of normal social conventions in some contexts. If I don't see a reason for something, I tend to ask about it very politely. But, I have learned over the decades that many people don't have actual reasons, and at that point, I don't see why I must play along. I respect the rational parts of humans at the end of the day (which is to say, I generally don't hold most humans in high regard, but I want the best for them). 

It would be better for them to not be myself so much with others in some cases. They would have more fun. I actually spend a lot of time thinking about our moral obligations to each other. There are major [[gfwiwcgws]] concerns here, and so "better" is a loaded word.
