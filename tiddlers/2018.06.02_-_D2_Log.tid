Couple quests into A5. Made a 2xFlawless skull helm to replace my 2xChipped. Regen is still highly relevant to me. I plod through territory. Amn rune dropped. This is the first act I usually see it. I want to build Spirit. 4 socket items are very hard to find, unfortunately. I need +skill gear pretty badly, imho. 

...

Cleared A5. Had to town twice for the throneroom waves. Baal was cake, but he took forever. I also didn't have any cold mages. It could have been even cleaner. Hit 30 on skillquest in A1NM. I now have all skills I wanted opened in all trees. At this point, I will pour everything into Jack Skellingtons, then rotate between CR and Mastery. Hopefully, along the way, I'll pickup some FCR and skill items to make Amp-CR rotations go off smoothly. It is weird going down to basic gear in this respect. 

Picked up some vidalia's boots. I think I'll just build shitty MF armor. Right now, I can't afford to do anything crazy. That said, I've not even been remotely endangered in quite a while. The HP is absurd. 

NM HP is very high, btw. I desperately need to gear. A2 NM merc Might will be a huge boost too.
