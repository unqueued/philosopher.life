My brother is dealing with a foreman who strategically takes up social dominance hierarchy prescriptions which aren't based upon respecting others in many cases. He's been telling me stories. I have no idea how he has the patience and fortitude for it. He's getting drunk at a potluck tomorrow with the crew. I hope he has an amazing time.

Returns lady at Home Depot gifted him a charger. Actually cool story, bro. It made me laugh. 

He tried a vape recently. Sweet. I understand the desire to control the timing, and edibles take forever for him.

We talked about EFF. We talked about a doxx he saw in a game and asked some questions about it.

My son called him. He praised my son for being kind and honest. That is profoundly high praise (and he's right).

My brother's face is doing much, much better! It has almost healed. With enough laughing, my brother can still feel it. I'm going that in the next few weeks it will be like it never happened.

We talked for a solid hour! That was awesome.
