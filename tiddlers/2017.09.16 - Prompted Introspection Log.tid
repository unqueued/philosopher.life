It's amazing. It's so simple. Perhaps it is reasonable to call the Earth a living thing. I don't mind it. How does it reproduce? It generates a species which can travel to another planet and make another habitable planet, and so on.

Does that mean we owe anything to Earth? Not obviously beyond anything we owe to all living things and especially to ourselves. Consuming it, however, is not obviously conceptually evil in itself. After all, we might just be expressions of its identity in the first place. 

Essentially, I don't buy the Gaea claim.
