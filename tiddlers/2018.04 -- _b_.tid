!! Audit:

* I've clearly been rethinking many of my relationships as of late.
* This wiki isn't ready for primetime at all.
* Bliss certainly had a hand in my writing. I'm very glad to have worked my way back to meaning.
* Preach, yo!
* I can see how /b/ has given rise to my obsessions and projects (as well as the adjusts) in {[[Focus]]} this month. I'm pleased to see it translate into organization and direction.
* This is a place to get my anger out. I'm glad I can. I need to.
