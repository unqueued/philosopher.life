I'm finally calling it what it is. =)

Today we are working on putting some simple large buttons on a fur black coat. I picked them out myself (the whole thing). They look outstanding. It is better to go with a simple design look when the rest of the coat is baroque. Less is more.

We bought a heavy duty zipper to replace the broken one on my wife's fairly expensive set of boots (cost almost as much as her wedding boots). This is not a simple fix. This is a first for us. At this point, we have everything to gain in fixing them and nothing to lose. We alleviated the pressure on us by picking up an emergency set of cheap boots (since she'll need them this week anyways).
