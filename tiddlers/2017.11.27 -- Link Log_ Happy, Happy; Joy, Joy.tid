*** Weirdly, this disconfirms my bias in some respects and yet confirms my hope that is true.

* Think About It

*** People must be literate. I think it's the only out, here. How else can you decentralize power? How else can you care about it? You must understand it and own it first.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html
*** And, yet, I consider my typed notes in classes to have been invaluable. I was almost always the only graduate student with a laptop open, but I found that I captured not only key transcripts, but also had the ability to formulate/write-down my questions and thoughts for the classroom dialectic. It's part of the reason my professors enjoyed having me in class. My penetrating questions or comments relied upon being able to type them out. However, I am autistic, and I also do not fuck around in class; I'm serious as a heartattack.

*** Something's off, but I can't put my finger on it.

*** Want the OSS, self-hosted version. NAT piercing (increasingly) and to a lesser extent now'n'days Dynamic DNS services are important. We are always trying to make VPNs more reliable; that's really the larger problem.
