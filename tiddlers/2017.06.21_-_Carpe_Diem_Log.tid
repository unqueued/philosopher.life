title: 2017.06.21 - Carpe Diem Log

* I had dreams from another night. It was very intense. I woke up feeling exhausted and emotionally drained. 
* I woke the kids up and we all started our day. 
* My love made lunch for me (she is sweet!), and it was good.
* I worked hard.
* I had to SSH and Tox to get the kids on Pidgin. We squared it though.
* I worked hard.
* I'm getting the feeling that I need to keep a list of contacts in my industry. I started a private wiki for personal information that I consider too private for this wiki. I share it with my family.
* I'm still applying, and I'm not going to be deterred. I have time. We aren't in an emergency. I will succeed!
* When I got home I checked with the kids. They were on task, and they did finish their schoolwork. Yay! They got to go outside and play. That was nice.
* I played a few games of league.
* I surfed. 
* I worked on that wiki. It took some time setting it up.
* I upgraded this wiki to a new version.
* My friend ALM is moving to protect his privacy. I will have someone to talk with about it. Yay!
* I had some fireman time. 
* I made dinner with my wife, and we ate while watching GoT. Everyone is very excited about the new season coming out in a few weeks.
* I've got a lot of things to accomplish tonight on my [[To-do-list]]. 
* Plates renewed.
* AB&T letter is all set. I just need to mail it off now.
* Cover letter created, and I added it to my Thompson application. I'll call tomorrow.
