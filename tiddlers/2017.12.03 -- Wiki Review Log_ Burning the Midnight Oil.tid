title: 2017.12.03 -- Wiki Review Log: Burning the Midnight Oil

* [[Redpills]]
** I am slowly building my way towards a definition. You see it on the pages of this wiki. I'm wielding the word. Give it time!
* [[Diamonds]]
** Ditto.
* [[The Right]]

* [[Stoicism-fu]]
** A damned fine job.

* [[Think Tank Consultant]]
** Kind of silly.
