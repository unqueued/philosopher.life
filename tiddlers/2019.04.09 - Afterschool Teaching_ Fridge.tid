title: 2019.04.09 - Afterschool Teaching: Fridge

I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to banter with and cheer up Whitney. I'm glad she feels comfortable swearing in front of me too, and I like that I get to express my own point of view with her more openly than I can with most people. Granted, I don't get to say it all the way down, but she probably would be bored and horrified (and perhaps incapable in some respects, understandably: my insanity is insane).

We had a new fridge. I thanked Delp for it. He has been spending the money wisely in this case (and, I had a hunch he had been holding back). Tanner and I worked to re-arrange the room, strip the considerable protection off it, and try to place it. Unfortunately, there are large bolts that I need a socketwrench for. The school doesn't have the right tools, so I'll bring mine tomorrow.

Whitney and Matt seem to be more attuned to my opinions and feelings about how we divide up the work today. Whitney has even gone out of her way today. Fascinating. I have no idea what they are thinking. It didn't matter, I took the beasts, and then Whitney and Mitchell joined me. I floated for Matt, and then finished off 5th grade. Mitchell was surprised by how much work they completed. I have discovered he is handing out answers instead of having them wrestle with their homework. Cmon, dude. Don't do this to them! =/

It is my honor to teach, but I will not hinder their learning by just handing them the answers. I have kids who can't consistently add and subtract at 11. This is a fucking emergency. Parents aren't stepping up here. Of course, I have a tough time getting the kids to not freak out when they don't immediately know the answer. I need to cultivate patience and confidence in their ability to eventually find the answer.

We hit the lab; I had a bunch waiting for me. I have a Geek Girl Squad at this point. Noice. I wish they were more interested in computing, but I'm happy for anything. The library and the computer lab are the best rooms in the school. Let's celebrate.

Testing begins tomorrow. It's a big fucking deal to these people.

Delp had more discussions of state requirements. I love how the motivation is that "we could get fired." He employs plenty of manipulative tactics with the kids and adults around him without justification.
