title: 2019.02.14 - Prompted Introspection: Unusual Restaurant Event

!! Describe something unusual that happened while you were eating in a restaurant.

This is a difficult one for me. Surely something unusual has happened to me while eating in a restaurant. That's normal, right? Ugh. I can't remember an instance. Nothing is popping out to me. I have come to realize who some people really are while dining with them, and that has been unusual or shocking to me. But, somehow, that's one of the usual categories for those events to occur. I suppose many things I used to consider unusual before don't feel unusual to me now. There are some kinds of variation that become more usual over time, I assume.
