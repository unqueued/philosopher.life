title: Poem: Ad Hominem Dismissal

```
You're an oversensitive whiner who exaggerates their problems.
Stop acting like your emotions matter. Get over it! Learn to be callous.

You're just looking for any excuse to be negative and pessimistic.
Stop rabblerousing, and shut up because your opinions are unjustified.

You're immature, puerile, and irresponsible.
Stop being edgy, and grow out of your idealistic "phase."

You're afraid of competition and the success of individuals because you know you'll lose.
Stop seeking equality like a gay pussy coward.

You're a greedy, selfish, materialistic, and envious loser dragging us down to your level.
Stop acting like you've been exploited; you are exploiting us when you do. Class warfare against the wealthy is unfair!

You're a malicious extremist, fascist, and totalitarian terrorist.
Stop being an insane menace to society by killing yourself.
