!! Audit:

* I see that I've been working on [[Find The Others]] for an extended period. It is clearly an important project to me.
* I've been struggling with this log. That said, I have a lot of meaning content in here. It's clearly part of my thinking process.
* Some of these are insanely long due to the [[Doctoral Notes]] graft.
* Ditto. Can't stop using it sometimes.
* I can see I'm spinning lots of plates, and I am working. This has been a very explosive month on the wiki.
* I can see that some of my [[Find The Others]] letters are sitting there, on the backburner, some unwritten and some unsent. Why?
* One thing that becomes more evident to me with this log is how I've been transforming myself to be "go with the flow" and become more okay with imperfection. I'm not sweating the small stuff as much I normally might. The anxiety is diminished. I hope that I continue to still be making progress with increasing effectiveness with this attitude.
* I worked on poetry this month. Neat.
* Those business cards were sick!
* Lots of transclusionary work. I'm glad. I love references+values. It allows me to transform so much. 
* I had ten thousand things this month. I definitely felt pulled in many directions.
* I love that my configs/dotfiles/etc. are being stored here. I need to continue that.
* Turns out that my skiddy approach develops novel configs. 
* I did the review twice one day. That was funny.
* I made a lot of mistakes in this log. I keep confusing [[Wiki Review]] and [[Carpe Diem]]. They do seem to have a lot in common, of course. They serve different purposes though.
