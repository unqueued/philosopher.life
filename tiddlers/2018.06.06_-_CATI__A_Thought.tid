Ultimately, this wiki is my magnum opus, the dissertation of my life. 

One thing that has become intuitively clear to me is that I cannot escape having a vortex of faith on this wiki. There are number of powerful qualitative and quantitative arguments which point to it. Many have wrestled with this thing, but few have the strength to speak about what they wrestling with as they wrestle. 

The singularity which I cannot see into or past, only the outlines, is something I must always give creedence to. Creedence itself requires it.
