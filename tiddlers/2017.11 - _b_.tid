!! Audit:

* My wife claims not to find [[/b/]] hard to read. My gut says otherwise still.
* I clearly don't have a convention I love for footnotes. It's weird to have footnotes in [[/b/]], but you do you, homie.
* Edit. 
* I definitely have a lot of dialectic going on in the stream of conscious writing.
* Gary didn't engage in quietism; despite his thought that he's being stoic, he's literally lacking the integrity to engage in a dialectic. It's one-sided and cowardly.
* Reading these still gets my blood pumping. 
* I respond to my donors often.
* I am using the Profound Emphasis mechanic here.
* I continue to see how I fit into the world and who I am. 32, and still have to do it. That's okay though. Do what you have to do.
* I am peeling egoism apart from psychopathy here. I am peeling Morally obligated empathy apart of immoral Altruism (unmerited Empathy, McIntryianly virtuous in one sense and vicious in another).
** Joining the herd can be justice, but that doesn't make it moral.
* I am addicted to negative thoughts. They tend to be incredibly valuable to me. 
** Is this fundamentally wrong? Not necessarily. I need to be constructive, but beyond that...I don't see the problem. Let me be negative about being negative, amiright? =)
* I do use tags for dialectics. I've also been thinking about other uses for tags.
* I'm capturing quotes here. Hrmm... Is that a mistake? It seems like I've failed to have a good home for them in many ways.
* Wrestle! I am the wrastleh.
* I should finish my
* I am literally getting a headache reading these. It's a flood of information and emotions for me. I'm reliving it.
* Thank Seldon for the Giggles.
* This was one of the harder audit's I've ever had to do. I performed legit philosophy up in here, and some of it is quite emotional for me.
