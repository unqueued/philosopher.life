title: 2019.03.04 - Prompted Introspection: Basement Weather

!! What is the worst weather condition you have ever experienced?

I have answered this one before: [[2018.03.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: Worst Weather Condition]]. Interestingly, this is not the scariest weather moment I've ever had. When I was ~10 there were tornados all over our neck of the woods. I saw the tip of the small tree in our front yard touch the ground! I saw the huge oak tree in our backyard have limbs pulled off it, and it destroyed our radio antenna. Sparks, lightning, fire, rain, and wind. We huddled in the basement (we did many times over the years, but that night was scary).

God damn, I miss that basement. It's so weird to miss it, but I do. It's where the kids often went.
