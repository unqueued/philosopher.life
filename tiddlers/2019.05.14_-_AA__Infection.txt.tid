Back home! =)
MON 5:59 PM
So glad your home! Are you feeling better?
TUE 10:15 AM
Yes. Much better.
TUE 10:15 AM
Doesn't sound like they know what was wrong (blood cultures turned up nothing, and they couldn't find any pus to test), but they pumped me full of anti-everything and it worked.
TUE 10:17 AM
How's your weekend been?
TUE 10:17 AM
Was it like MRSA or streph or staph? Thatâ€™s kinda weird
TUE 10:19 AM
I hope it stays away
TUE 10:19 AM
Think it was a fungal infection that enabled a bacterial infection.
TUE 10:26 AM
Ewww no fun
TUE 10:44 AM
I have gotten staph a few times but never in the hospital
TUE 10:44 AM
