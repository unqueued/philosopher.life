title: 2018.10.10 - Sphygmus: nihil titulum

okay //WHOA// that timeline plugin is incredible. I need to think about and play with this a lot more, I can tell!!

...because subject lines feel formal and decided (like titling an essay) and my notes are not that at all!

So I keep returning to your wiki to catch up, right, and I keep thinking things are changing (other than the actual tiddlers) - sometimes {Pin} is the main tab that loads, other times it's {New} or {Recent} or {More...} and I keep thinking...that's not in my head, right? I haven't been //sure// before though.

I loaded your wiki up today, though, and there was a search still in the sidebar! "One-time", I believe. Never had that happen before; I think it's awesome.
