title: 2018.12.21 - MTG Log: Coach and Construct

I coached my chillun. My son mulled to 1? GG. My daughter had the game in the bag, but didn't block a driver. It cost her the game. My turn.

I leader->(whirler, leader, krenko), kinesis her chief, swing for 5, lackey->krenko, pass. She drops vial, matron->leader. I whirler, krenko, lethal.

Son:

He chiefs. I matron->inc, inc->chief, swing, lackey->trash, trash(matron)->vial, pass. He chiefs. I inc chief, pyromancer, swing for ~30.

Son:

3x mountain, lackey, inc, matron, leader. He mulls. T1 lackey, pass. I mirror. He drops vial, no land, pass. I inc lackey, lackey->chief, pass. He MWMs. I whirler, swing with whirler and chief. I leader->(2x whirler, matron), kinesis the board, swing, lackey->leader->(lackey, chief), lackey. He incs chief, vial->SS. I whirler, swing out.

Gonna try to get them to start constructing to the metagame.
