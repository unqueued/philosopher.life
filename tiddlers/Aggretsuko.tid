!! Aggretsuko: S01E01

Metal Kawaii. I love the rage and despair, the disillusionment from idealism. Weeb socialist critique of capitalism like Neo Yokio, but way fucking cuter. It's Bojack Horseman-esque and definitely Metalocalypse!!! Omg, she's singing!

I got 30 seconds into this and immediately messaged [[L]].

THERE'S NO PRESSURE, TAKE YOUR TIME!

Intro is good. Suicide rates are rising among Japanese youth too. Do you like your life?

Teamplayers lose. I love the explanation of power structures.

Sufffferrrrrinng.

I love that we can't talk shit about current/previous employers. That is a redflag to many, and often not for morally meritocratic reasons.

Hahahahahaha, so robotically beautiful. I want to bang her.

Have you lost your mind!

The superpower shiny eyes are outstanding. I love lots of the details in this animation, even though it's meant to be oversimple.

Love to see the dreams of escaping one's bondage shattered, literally.

Fascinating hit on "dancers" (slouches, bums, leeches, etc.).

//''Protein.''//

Way too ~~optimistic~~ protein.

The show ends up being far, far too optimistic, and it lamely attempts to set us up for the same old thing. The storyline is wrong. They get a fuckton right though.
