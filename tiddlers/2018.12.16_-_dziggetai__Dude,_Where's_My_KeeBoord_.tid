Hello h0p3,

TL;DR: I'm asking for advice on working with knowledge with a tiddlywiki and also working on myself with it. This e-mail contains context that might help you understand what I'm asking. (At least I hope it does :D)

Excuse me for the long letter.

I am very much interested in your response, in fact, I've been meaning to contact you about your wiki because it is truly interesting and - in my quest to learn how to use tiddlywiki for my own purposes - I tried to analyze your usage of it many times. Your use of English is a bit convoluted for me as it is my second language. I love philosophy (or shall I say I'm a philosophil? :D) but my understanding of it is in its infancy so it is also a barrier for me when I try to understand what you are doing. I do not mean to insult you in any way, I admire what you've done and even though I don't know you, I assume I'd be an admirer of your persona as well. That being said, my understanding is that you have a sort of autism (I don't know much about the condition) and it makes you smarter than me in many aspects, in other words, you are operating at a different level than I do - this is why you'd write down four sentences while I'd say "the same thing" in four words and why you'd be more specific (that is to say "more correct" as well) than me, but it makes it hard for me to understand you, even if what you write seems more clear to you this way. This is why I hesitated to contact you - not because I wouldn't want to read your response (I'd love to read you specifically answering what I'm having trouble with and I don't mind that its difficult for me at times to understand it), but there is a chance you've already written down answers to my questions in your wiki but I didn't understand it or didn't get to it yet.

But recently I've been interacting with more people and I don't think you'd mind answering some of my questions. I hope you don't.

Now to the body.

Saying that wiki structure is highly context-dependent doesn't really help, I see why you say that I agree with it, but sadly it doesn't help. (Me. It might help others.)

My primary purposes of using tiddlywiki are to learn (everything I can) and to work with information and meaning, perhaps to plan/control my life through it. I have no idea how to do any of this (with or without using a wiki). This is what I'd like to ask some advice for.
I understand that this is a very personal thing and I'm better off figuring it out myself but advice from someone who has been at it for a while is part of that process (for a hairless monkey like me).

Learning through hardknocks is a valid way to learn, and you are ahead of me in them so I have many things to learn from you. Besides, based on what I've read you seem to be highly intelligent - a quality I find to be very important.

Assume to have fully committed to the mechanics of tiddlywiki and that you are both smarter and have more knowledge than the person you're talking to (not to mention that you also have more experience):

I'd like to know if you could devise principles for using tiddlywiki, on working with information and knowledge, on learning in general, and perhaps on behavior change and how to go about that. If you could help me with any of these things I'll be a very happy person. If you can't, you can still make me happy by helping me deal with them: we could formulate some principles for tiddlywiki usage through dialog.

I know that making me happy isn't the highest priority for you so if I can have a response from you in four months I'll be grateful for it regardless the time it took. I probably won't advance much in my quest anytime soon.

I share your wish to have more examples of production wikis to look at but as this is outside of my control, the best I can do is to ask around for thoughts on how to use tw for the purposes I want to use it for. (For what I can tell you used it for similar things so you are my best bet at getting help.)

I don't know why there is no conversation on how to go about using TW in the abstract and not specifically in terms of "what buttons to press" and how it works. I might try to initiate a topic like this in the group, but I doubt I'll get as much out of it as I'd from your responses.

To put in your words:

I hope to develop independent thought in my wiki and I hope to define and achieve my goals with the use of tiddlywiki.

Some of my thoughts based on your wiki might be kind of interesting, for example, I see that you have 5 main parts, (about, principles, focus, vault, and dreams) and that these repeat this pattern within each of them. This makes it self-similar, hence in my analysis of it, I called it - however incorrectly - a fractal-like structure. I am not sure how far this could go, and I think in your wiki it doesn't go further than 2 "repetitions" but I wonder: does meaning (or information/knowledge) itself have this structure? Can we gain some meta-meaning or meta-knowledge if thought/knowledge/information/etc turns out to be fractal-like? Or maybe we can force the structure on knowledge/thought to have a better way to organize it as you did, but perhaps taking it further. I didn't reach any conclusion here, maybe you can.

Think of me as a child who's just learning how to think for himself. (I'm exactly that as far as my mental state goes. According to the internet my frontal lobe just reached its maturity [I'll be 26 next year] but apart from that I'm pretty much a child.)

I am humbled to be mentioned in your wiki and very delighted to have received a response from you. I'd like to continue this conversation further, even if you don't have anything more to add, repeating or rewording something you've already said might turn on a lightbulb in my head.
I'm still in the process of analyzing your wiki and now trying to get everything I can out of your response to what I wrote.

I want to say thank you for that and for sharing your wiki.

I am, like most humans, just a simpleton machine with countless faults, but as for why you might want to engage in conversation with me - I have two good qualities: I do my best to get to the truth and I admire pragmatism.

Best wishes,

dziggetai

P.S. I wasn't sure if the gmail address is something you actually check or its for the google group only so I added your other e-mail address to receive this too. Sorry about that.
