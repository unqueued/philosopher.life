title: 2017.05.17 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.05.16 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** Edited.
** I'm really glad that I'm grinding through these introspection prompts. It is my hypothesis that the recreational and free-wheeling aspect of them allows me to lower my guard and think about things in an honest way. It's a way to force myself to do some existential lifting.

** I fear this could go many places. I'm still unsure what I want to do about my thousands of links.
* [[2017.05.16 - Link Log]]
** Edited.
** Also, I forgot links from yesterday. Lol. Umm, so I'll just put them in today's. Or should I graft them in? This is a problem that I don't know how to easily answer. I need principles for this problem. I don't run into it often, but I need to know how to handle exceptions in wiki procedures.

** I said scarcely little in this log. I take this to be part of the oscillation. I won't strike gold every day.
* [[2017.05.16 - Pipefitting Log]]
** Edited. 
** Also, I was reminded to edit today's log.
* [[2017.05.16 - Diet Log]]
** You are eating more than you should. Look at those calories. Were the biscuits worth it?
** Not having shopped for more fruits and vegetables may be hurting me here. I've held back on them to make sure the kids have enough for the week. I'm trying to save money and squeak a week by without any shopping. You can still just eat less. If you have hunger pains, then feel satisfied by your grind towards happiness.
