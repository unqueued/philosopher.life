To Whom It May Concern,

It is my honor to recommend [[T-Money]] for the SSC AMT Instructor position. I've known [[T-Money]] for 15 years, since we met in college. I've had the pleasure of working with him in academic contexts, and I've long known [[T-Money]] to be skilled with both his hands and his mind. I've been a teacher and a pipefitter for many years, and it's obvious to me that [[T-Money]] is a man concerned with both theory and practice. I know [[T-Money]] is an excellent aviation mechanic and a mentor to his co-workers. He has the right foundation for becoming an elite instructor.

Here's why you should hire him: he's a patient and thorough teacher with significant industry experience. His hands-on knowledge is up-to-date and battle-tested; it cannot be replaced. His ability to teach, demonstrate, and provide insider "been there, done that" knowledge shines in both a classroom and in the field. [[T-Money]] knows what quality, real-world craftsmanship in aviation mechanics actually looks like because he does it every day. The proverbial “it’s hard to teach that” aspect of aviation mechanics is exactly what he has the experience to teach best. Lastly, I appreciate how seriously [[T-Money]] takes his work; he knows lives are on the line in everything he does.

I have no doubt [[T-Money]] will challenge and prepare his students for this high-pressure, technical vocation which has no room for mistakes. He's a passionate, intelligent, and skilled aviation mechanic who has worked in a variety of capacities in the aviation industry. I want my family to be passengers on airplanes which have been serviced by mechanics as skilled and trustworthy as [[T-Money]]. You and I both want your students to be as talented and mindful as he is; they would be lucky to learn from him. Without reservation, I recommend him for the instructor position.


Sincerely,
