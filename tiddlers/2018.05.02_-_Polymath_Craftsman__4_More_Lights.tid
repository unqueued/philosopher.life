title: 2018.05.02 - Polymath Craftsman: 4 More Lights

We looked at our work yesterday. It wasn't up to par (even though he was watching us yesterday). Colton is fixing it. We finalized the area otherwise, and I got to wire up another lamp, and then we moved to the next set of houses. There are 4 connected to one house, so we stuck on that. 

Tons of digging. Not much wiring. All the work is in taking apart the old work and digging the new. The wiring aspect is almost instant. I'm very pleased to ahve the chance to learn how to do this. I feel like I could cleanly do this myself, as long as I had plans of what was running underneath me. I would like to learn residential actually. I think that will be eminently useful to me in the end. 

PLCs and Solar are what I need to really invest myself into if I can. I'd like to eventually, at the end of 5 years not only be a journeyman in the IBEW, but also a master electrician certified by the state, a contractor, and have completed at least some relevant PLC and Solar certs. That could go a very long way for me.

Colton hasn't been so bad. He talked a bit about the union with us as well. I'm glad that he is more interested in trying to use the ditch witch. This is his first day really digging with us, and I think that is changing him mind more about what we have to do. Normally, apparently the foreman aren't supposed to labor with us at all (it's against the rules), but there is no way we could do this without him. I'm glad he breaks the rule. And, it makes sense. He wants to keep his job with his contractor. 

To me, I'd rather run around doing the bidding and business end of things with a union that gives proportionately to its members. I'm still going to have think quite a bit about what the union gets right and what it doesn't. I'm convinced there are significant improvements to make, especially on the contractor end of things.

I am quite sore today. I'm taking it a bit slower. I'm also being a bit smarter with the shovels, I think. By the end of this job, I think I'll feel fairly comfortable doing it. Although, that said, I'm not sure that we are really doing a good job. I know it's not up to code. 

One very nice thing: I'm wearing one ear piece today from my bluetooth headset and listening to [[A History of Western Philosophy]]. It's mesmerizing, and in a way, the grunt work fades somewhat into the background as I focus upon the words of a genius walking me down through his interpretation of the Western Memeplex.

The Ditch witch tractor got stuck in a very bad spot. Colton didn't back down the hill like I thought he should, and we paid the price. This set us back in multiple ways. 

We got most of 2 completed. We ran out of concrete. Colton isn't the best planner just yet. He is clearly loyal to his company.

Colton is also quite finicky about getting everything symmetrical and vertical. He refuses to use the side KOs on the box, even when it makes ergonomic sense. Appearances matter quite a bit to him. What we actually put into the ground less so it seems. I'm sure some of these discrepancies have good reasons behind them.

I spent time talking to Brian more about the union and political climate. After 30 years, he has doubts about the pension making it through the Boomers (may they burn in hell). 

We used hooks on the ends of our fish tape to get it through. We struggled quite a bit. I left at 5:30, which apparently, is our true quitting time.
