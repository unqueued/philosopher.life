title: 2018.10.27 - JRE: Coming Up

My brother is happy with the surgery. Sleep isn't much better, but everything else is improved.

My brother talked about how Rebecca felt there was little hope now after he spoke with her brother-in-law. It feels real to her. She is going to kick him out asap after Raylan goes. I advised he continue to think hard about it (I'm repeating myself in asking him to write about it). He has very little time now. I suggested he look into another residence. 

Raylan is now going every weekend. It's ramping up.

He does not want to invalidate his feelings, inferences, beliefs, and experiences before the meds. Changing your mind might be different than that. I do not know. This is an area for which I don't have a good answer, and I fear I cannot solve it either (Ship of Theseus is here). He mentioned our discussion on [[2018.10.02 - JRE: Aldi]] and discussions of sex before that. He said I previously did'nt press him on his reasoning about the matter, but he can see I thought the meds were doing him good in his ability to make inferences here. He's worried about this. I have absolutely no idea how to answer this.

Part of me thinks I write in my wiki to preserve my feelings (showing some validity) while still maintaining the power to deny, not assent to, or change them. 

We talked about his shop. He's not buying more tools until he finishes a project. That makes good sense. Ofc, I hope he keeps in his list in a wiki.
