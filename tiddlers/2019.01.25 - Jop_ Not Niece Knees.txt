How's it going?
FRI 12:47 PM
It's ok. Today I went to my church they had and exercise group this is my first time to join him it was fun to have people doing the same thing. My niece kind of hurt so I'm trying to be easy on exercising. I'm trying to put ice pack on my knees and if I feel better I think this evening I want to go to the gym again.
