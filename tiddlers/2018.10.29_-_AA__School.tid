How’s your day going?
MON 2:19 PM
=)
MON 2:19 PM
It's going well.
MON 2:19 PM
:blush:
MON 2:20 PM
Need to fix my dryer, run some errands.
MON 2:20 PM
Applying to jobs around town.
MON 2:20 PM
schooling with the kids
MON 2:20 PM
Wonderful! I am almost done with the school day
MON 2:20 PM
How's your day been?
MON 2:20 PM
Went to the viewing of a student’s mom today —she died unexpectedly of a massive heart attack
MON 2:21 PM
The young lady is doing well —her dad is visibly struggling
MON 2:21 PM
I can imagine. Were you all able to leave school to attend?
MON 2:22 PM
Yes —as many as wanted to go. The school even provided transportation for kids that wanted to go
MON 2:23 PM
Rosalyn is a senior (only child, adopted) She has been at this school most of her life
MON 2:23 PM
Not glad about the funeral, but I am glad that the school provides and takes it seriously.
MON 2:24 PM
How many students attend your school?
MON 2:25 PM
I am not sure I have ever expressed my gratitude to you enough. I truly love being a teacher. Thank you for helping get me that opportunity.
MON 2:25 PM
450-475ish
MON 2:25 PM
It's my pleasure. It's clearly your calling. That is always a cool memory. I'm grateful to have been able to tag along with you for my first job besides McDonalds. I barely survived that first year, and I don't think I would have with you. I still miss riding in the car with you to work.
MON 2:29 PM
Also, our scanner is broken (but we might get another one). To my knowledge, public digital copies do not exist. So, I'm just going to bring the books themselves. I'll try to bring pre-alg through calculus.
MON 2:30 PM
without you*
MON 2:30 PM
Public school is rough. Barely survived myself...but even though there are struggles here —it is so much easier just to be a teacher and not deal with the political stuff and paperwork. 

Peter Johnson picks me up and takes me home most days—so I am not late but also it’s good to plan and bounce ideas around.

I miss those rides too!
MON 2:33 PM
That would be great! I would love to look at them. I think they make those printers/scanners have a life span of 6 months or 1 ream of paper, whichever comes first
MON 2:34 PM
Ha, that is cool that you guys still work together these years later.
MON 2:35 PM
Speaking of public school, have an interview for an after-school job at elementary school down the road. I'm hoping to pick up an IT position for the county instead though.
MON 2:36 PM
I keep telling him he can’t retire! At least until [[AG]] is done. :blush: He had gastric sleeve at Christmas and is down about 100 lbs
MON 2:36 PM
100lbs in 11 months? That's insane.
MON 2:37 PM
He is doing so well —he was struggling to get around (knees)
MON 2:38 PM
IT for the schools would be great
MON 2:38 PM
Playing clean 100FPS, but then getting streaming errors. It may not be fixable on Linux these past few months. Will try other machines and VMing. Still a couple tricks in the bag left.
MON 10:00 PM
