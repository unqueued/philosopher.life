title: 2020.03.13 - Prompted Introspection: War

!! Why do you think wars exist in the world?

My angry dismissal does not pick out the truth carefully enough, yet again; [[2018.05.22 - Prompted Introspection Log: Why War Exists]] falls short. 

Some reasons are significantly better than others to go to war, and not all warriors have violated [[The Moral Law]]. Unfortunately, one must wisely defect against the parasites, vampires, slaver-owners, reactionaries, and selfishly malicious defectors. Moreover, in addition to common sense, people are not absolutely evil all the way down in most all (if not all) cases (a Scholastic and Ontological existence as better making property question must always keep such a thing in check). That said, most have evil parts, and I will continue to agree that most should not exist as they do. Unfortunately, even assuming [[The Moral Law]] were completely upheld, there would still be dialectics which were a kind of warfare. Dialectics cannot be escaped, they can only be shaped.
