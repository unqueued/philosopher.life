My wife has elected to be in charge of this as well. Ultimately, this was a necessary step since I will be traveling. However, I still have quite a bit to contribute. 

Currently, we are working on integrating socialization theory and practices into their curriculum. These will be vital skills for my children. We already have several studies devoted to the edges of what I'm looking for, but I'm aiming for more direct work on the topic. I want my children to be adept and well-practiced at making friends, developing relationships, understanding social contexts, making good first impressions, understanding the nature of externalizing and communicating and developing the right instincts and habits for socializing. They need to fearless, free to experiment and fail, risk-takers, and shotgun-approachers. We're finding books, and we've found the time slot for it. We'll need to create spaces and circumstances for practice beyond the church, the neighborhood kids, and the pool.

I will also continue to encourage them and offer daily lectures. 

My wife is unable to help/evaluate my daughter with the computer science subjects, but I can. I will continue to do so.
