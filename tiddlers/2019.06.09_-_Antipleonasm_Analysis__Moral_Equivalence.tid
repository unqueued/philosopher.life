title: 2019.06.09 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Moral Equivalence

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Moral equivalence is a term of propaganda that was invented to try to prevent us from looking at the acts for which we are responsible. ...There is no such notion. There are many different dimensions and criteria. For example, there's no moral equivalence between the bombing of the World Trade Center and the destruction of Nicaragua or of El Salvador, of Guatemala. The latter were far worse, by any criterion. So there's no moral equivalence.
<<<

The common meaning for this phrase is fallacious. It's practically Orwellian in political discourse, and I agree we should be wary of drawing comparisons between unrelated things as a rhetorical tactic. The World Trade center example is obviously correct, but you won't find many Americans who would even know what you are talking about. They wouldn't want to own up to being responsible for such a thing, as [[Saint Chomsky]] rightfully points out.

I fear this is almost off topic, but he has stepped into conceptual analysis. He's not being careful enough with his language, and I have to correct the dangerous hyperbole. I realize I'm a pedantic asshole, but I simply can't agree there is no concept of moral equivalence. That phrase seems to be a useful way to speak about identical values or semantics in moral realism. Utility calculations reveal this cleanly, the various formulations of the Kingdom of Ends are logically and morally equivalent, and even Virtue Theorists remain open to different arrangements of dispositions being morally equivalent in some circumstances. I consider the notion too important to cede ground to [[Saint Chomsky]]'s literal words; I suggest, however, that he is open to this claim in metaethics (and it doesn't detract from his real thesis).
