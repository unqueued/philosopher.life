I'm forever indebted to Plato.

Particulars and Universals

Socrates was clearly failed to distinguish legal law from moral law.

Russell offers an analysis of the ontological issue of existence as a predict in 6-06. I need to think about his interpretation more.

Aristotle is Machiavellian. I like Plato's work more, obviously.
