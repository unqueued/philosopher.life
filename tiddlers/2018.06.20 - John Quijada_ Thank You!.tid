title: 2018.06.20 - John Quijada: Thank You!

If this message is inappropriately "out of the blue" for you, I apologize.

My children and I just learned about the Ithkuil language today. It's absolutely fascinating. Your music showcasing the language held my attention. This is all very different and exciting to me.

I regret to say I know very little about linguistics; my background is in academic philosophy. Forgive my ignorance, please. If I understand your work correctly (and I probably only understand a naive semblance of just a part of it), it's a significant contribution to humanity. I've always held first and second order logic in high regard, but Ithkuil seems like a radically different beast for exacting semantics. I really appreciate your using decades of creative energy to construct a living proof-of-concept example of the limits and possibilities of radically more ideal languages. Thank you for making this language! 

I believe the Golden Rule is conceptually linked to respecting the dignity of rational, autonomous language users. Being moral requires being honest, which, imho, is largely reducible to simply doing your best to "say what you mean" and "mean what you say." Ithkuil represents a moral linguistic ideal to me which is at the heart of who I hope to be, how I want to reason with myself, and how I wish to communicate with others.

I've read that one day you may revise Ithkuil into a more pragmatic language. I look forward to it. I will do my best to learn it. I hope one day to resolve at least some fundamental philosophical problems of vagueness for myself with a language that forces and enables me to infer, model, and communicate with a precision that English may not afford me. Assuming a weak Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, I hope your language one day gives us the ability to optimally refactor our perceptions of the "thing in itself."

If you have the time and inclination, I'd like to know any and all of your thoughts on the computational theory of mind, dialetheism, speculative realism, and what (if anything) you think Wittgenstein/Russell/GÃ¶del are pointing at.
