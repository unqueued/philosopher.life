Speaking of "hedonic treadmill of desire satisfaction," I took the day off to take care of some things, smoked a lot and probably just gave myself irreversible tennis elbow.  Pot and vr boobs are pretty amazing
THU 12:15 PM
Fuck yeah! lol
THU 12:15 PM
I think sex and weed go together so amazingly.
THU 12:15 PM
Are you becoming an expert toker? Do you know how to inhale and hold it in? I just can't do it. I'm still fascinated by it though.
THU 12:16 PM
Anyone that thinks weed should be illegal has never done what i just did for the last 3 hours
THU 12:16 PM
roflmao
THU 12:16 PM
Its a ton easier with the vapr
THU 12:16 PM
Vape
THU 12:17 PM
Barely hurts the jaw
THU 12:17 PM
or...people who think it should be illegal don't care about your happiness except insofar as it is exploitable
THU 12:17 PM
I dont enjoy the crazy coughing fits, even though they tend to accelerate and strengthen the weed
THU 12:18 PM
I am glad that your jaw doesn't hurt. I wonder why edibles and smoke tend to cause it more.
THU 12:18 PM
How long does it last for you?
THU 12:18 PM
So i have learned how to take a huge deep breath, but release it over several shallow breaths
THU 12:18 PM
Jaw pain doesnt happen at all from edibles
THU 12:18 PM
Only smoke
THU 12:19 PM
oh, I thought brownies did
THU 12:19 PM
my memory aint so gud
THU 12:19 PM
Nah, but the smell makes me vomit lol
THU 12:19 PM
The vape doesnt smell at all
THU 12:19 PM
And i can dial it in very nicely
THU 12:19 PM
yes
THU 12:19 PM
Starts up within 10 min, has been tapering off for 3 hours
THU 12:20 PM
Prolly at 20% str atm
THU 12:20 PM
Not nearly as overwhelming as the edibles imo
THU 12:20 PM
good!
THU 12:21 PM
It sounds like the right amount of control.
THU 12:21 PM
I think if i could dial the edible in, i would prefer it if the smell didnt bother me
THU 12:21 PM

It was a simple conversation.

My brother jerked off for 4 hours today. Lol. Impressive.

He's having to do additional paperwork to maintain his masters license.

We talked about food.
