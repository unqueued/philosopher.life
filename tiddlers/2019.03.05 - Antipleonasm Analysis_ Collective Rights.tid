I have long been willing to deny collective agency insofar as it can be reduced to individual agency. I am, however, attempting to be open  other forms of emergent agency. I still do not understand it, and I probably never will.

What kinds of objects can be rightsbearers? Most assume only agents. I cannot answer the question well enough. I agree to Hohfeldian correspondence though. Therefore, I often reverse engineer rights in virtue of having determined obligations. It turns out that I am morally obligated to serve many sets of objects, and I often treat the collective as a unified whole. 

I cannot speak to the emergence cleanly enough just yet, but I can tell you that it is reasonable to talk about the logical deontic equivalence between collective and individual rights. Collective rights grant us crucial generalization shortcuts instead of enumerating each right. In fact, it turns out breaking down even the individual's Hohfeldian rights molecule would require enumerating an arbitrarily large quantity of atomic rights.

It's obvious to me that there are collective obligations and rights even in while pushing again collective agency! Crucially, therefore, "collective rights" is not a contradiction in terms (well, not beyond [[The Dialetheia]] for having [[right]]s at all). 

Her rhetoric is quite convenient to her.
