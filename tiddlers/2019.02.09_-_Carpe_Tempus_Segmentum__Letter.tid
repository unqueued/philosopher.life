<<footnotes "2020.02.10-2" "So far, this is one of my favorite parts about our move. They've had to go out into the world to do it on their own. When I was a kid, I went down to the store myself with my pocket change to get a coke way more than my own offspring ever had the chance. I'm so grateful to be in a city. I'm afraid I don't push hard enough here still.">>

<<footnotes "2020.02.10-3" "I'm beginning to miss this. Perhaps soon enough that will change. I've not been using anything for a while. Don't want to push anything while I'm sick. I'm fine, but I think my best work is still while I'm high.">>
