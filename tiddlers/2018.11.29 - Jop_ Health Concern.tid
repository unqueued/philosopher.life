How's your week going, [[Jop]]?
THU 7:57 PM
It is going good. I just went to talk to my psychiatrist on Tuesday and I am no longer use the medication. Today I had a boxing class at the gym. It was fun. I will have it again next week. My work is ok. I'm enjoying working with After Care but I just don't get pay much. I did apply for CNA job again because I want to make more but I haven't heard back from them yet.
THU 8:39 PM
I hope the lack of medication continues to go well. I'm glad to hear about the boxing. What kind of boxing? I'm sorry about not getting paid much (I hear that, lol). I hope you get the CNA job, and I'm sorry you haven't heard back from them yet.
THU 8:40 PM
I hope so too. That's why I need to try to be healthy. I'm not sure what kind I after boxing's that they call but it just a simple boxing that we use in a gym. About my pay check it is because I work about 2 hours a day and substitute teacher sometimes.
