title: 2018.04.03 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Afraid

!! What are you afraid of? Why?

I'm afraid of imperfection in the wrong way, for the wrong reasons, and so on. I'm afraid of maximum disutility given the fitting scopes and constraints, philosophical existential failures, meaninglessness, evil, and unnecessary pain. "Why?" is almost a dumb question given my answer. These are the fundamental "Why's."
