This quote is delusional. Unfortunately, it is our plight to beg the question of what counts as reason at some level. There is a faith we must take up. I will point out that Rand denies [[T42T]] to be the fundamental concept of Reason itself; she denies that treating [[Humanity]] as an end in itself (or one step removed from [[The Telos]] in [[Itself]]) should be the centerpiece and beginning material (an {[[axiom]]}) of Reason. 

I am not the kind of skeptic (like Bruce Brower) who will favor tolerance too far in this direction. I can appreciate the reasoning of those who deny [[The Golden Rule]] without accepting it is Reason, but I will engage in outgrouping psychopathy quite thoroughly. Fundamental disagreement sometimes results in justified violence. That is a harsh truth in [[The Dialectic]] for many.

Obviously, if you beg the question of Capitalism and mere egoism into reason, then you'll get the convenient conclusions and narratives you are looking to confabulate. I see the contradiction in almost everyone I meet; few are serious about Reason. Jesus know what it do.
