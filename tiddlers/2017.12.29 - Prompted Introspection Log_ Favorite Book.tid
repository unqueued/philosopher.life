title: 2017.12.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Book

!! What is your favorite book and what do you like most about it?

That is a tough one. Long-term, over the course of my life, or currently? It's kind of contextual too. I'd probably have to say //Dune// by Frank Herbert. That book is all sorts of amazing. I re-read it often enough. Like Spice, it's never the same twice. It is a lens through which I see myself and the world throughout my life. The pieces come together. Having been a substance user, I can also appreciate other aspects of the book. 

I love how the book discusses philosophy, politics, religions, technology, drug-use, intercultural exchanges, memes, etc. It's insightful, well-written, and encourages studying. It is really its own little world, with its own vocabulary. It's microcosmic, and that's hard to pull off elegantly without losing something usually. I can't think of too many flaws in the book.
