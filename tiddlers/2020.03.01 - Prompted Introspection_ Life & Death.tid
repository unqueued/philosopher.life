title: 2020.03.01 - Prompted Introspection: Life & Death

!! What does death teach us about life?

I don't disagree with my answer in here: [[2018.04.26 - Prompted Introspection Log: Life and Death]]. This is something my son and I talked about today. Having strongly desired to die alters how we perceive life after such a desire. Life can feel less precious, and yet also like gravy. 

I wish people were more thoughtful about how they thought about death. People fear death so strongly, they choose to live incorrectly. It's not a pleasant topic, but it's a necessary one.
