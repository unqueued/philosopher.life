title: 2019.04.01 - Prompted Introspection: First Dance

!! Describe the first time you ever danced with someone.

I don't remember. I'm sure I danced with folks as a toddler. I was taught very basic dancing in elementary school. We had some school dances I attended. I danced with all the girls in my class, but I don't remember who was first. Amanda stands out the most to me. She was a quiet alabaster girl with a sharp tongue. She talked to me as we danced; it was highly personal. It opened up a different world for me, and I saw her differently after our dance. Her dad was an honest mechanic, her brother a fool. They lived in the classic-style run-down Appalachian white house. I do not know what became of her. I wish her well.
