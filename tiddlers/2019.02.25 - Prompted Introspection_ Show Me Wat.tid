title: 2019.02.25 - Prompted Introspection: Show Me Wat

!! What is an incident you have had at a movie theater?

I don't have any significant stories that stand out to me. I generally avoid going to the movie theater. Even if it were free, I would avoid it. Few movies in theaters are worth my time, and I don't feel like spending my spoons with people in the unmitigated offline, realtime public for this. 

At this point, whenever I go to the theater with my brother [[JRE]], I utter the words: "show me what you've got." It made my brother laugh before, and now I can't help myself. It's the silly nothingness maymaying that turns out to be so meaningful to me.

The world is such a serious place for me. There is so much unnecessary suffering that I am responsible for attempting to prevent to some significant [[dok]] (even if it is merely a drop in the bucket of what would be sufficient for solving the problems of the world) that I try not to waste my time beyond that which is necessary for recuperating. I am a man on a mission.

It is interesting to see how even the absurdity of silliness serves a purpose, and obviously, it should. I have found that most people end up rejecting the responsibilities of purpose.
