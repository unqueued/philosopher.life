title: 2017.11.30 - Outopos: The B-Word

I remember when Bitcoin came out. I lived in Thailand. It was a toy I played around with on my Q6600 machine. I thought it was very interesting, especially as someone who had played in game currencies. I was not afraid of digital currencies, but I wasn't convinced this would work outside of illegal contexts (note, I don't give a shit about what is illegal, only what is immoral). Blockchains are special beasts. The hype only continues to grow. 

Will Outopos have its own blockchain? Will it feature integration with other blockchains? How neutral will it be? I don't know. 

It would be nice to force proof of contribution to the network. That's pretty much the only thing that matters to me. Perhaps a blockchain isn't the best option here, but something like it has to occur. Digital trust in the face of even partial Sybil attacks is frankly very complicated. 

Retroshare really does have one of the most interesting models I've ever seen. It has taken PGP's social trust notion and ran with it (poorly). Maybe a user-based filtering of who they trust is the best option. We want to disincentive psychopathic behavior, harness selfishness in the right ways, defeat tragedies of the commons and prisoner's dilemmas. We are running out of time, I fear. 

Perhaps we first build the network, build tools to capture information, and then build filtering/trust networks on top of that. This may be a kind of premature optimization avoidance issue.
