title: 2018.11.26 - Computer Musings: CNAME

We believe it is the lack of the CNAME file (doh) that is causing the reset on github pages. That should be fixed.

You know what, FUCK this bullshit:

root's crontab on Dallas:

```
*/5 * * * * mkdir -p /var/run/sshd && systemctl start sshd >/dev/null 2>&1
@reboot mkdir -p /var/run/sshd && systemctl start sshd >/dev/null 2>&1
```

Yeah. Screw it. Just taking the ghetto hack. This is shoestring and gum.

```bash
echo "hypercored --cwd /mnt/storage/syncs/dats" > /mnt/storage/syncs/dats/services
sudo su #ugh =/
add-to-systemd dat-lil-pids $(which lil-pids) /mnt/storage/syncs/dats/services /mnt/storage/syncs/dats/pids
systemctl start dat-lil-pids
exit
```

Nope. Killing it. Not pleased with root.

`gyp WARN EACCES user "root" does not have permission to access the dev dir "/root/.node-gyp/11.2.0"`

Outstanding, soldier.

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
npm install -g hypercored dat add-to-systemd lil-pids
mkdir ~/dats
cd ~/dats
echo 'dat://6ca5bfb34c0bbfa8751b6d85f591b7a007b89df7207dc0aa9885bf00be610c8f' >> feeds #kickscondor
echo "hypercored --cwd ~/dats" > ~/dats/services
```

Nope. Even getting hypercored running doesn't actually sync. It just sits there.

```bash
sudo su
npm install -g hypercored dat add-to-systemd lil-pids
exit
add-to-systemd dat-lil-pids $(which lil-pids) ~/dats/services ~/dats/pids
```

Nope.

Fuck it. I can get it working on m10, though it's not using systemd to run hypercored as h0p3!
