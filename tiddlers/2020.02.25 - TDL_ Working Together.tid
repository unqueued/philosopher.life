title: 2020.02.25 - TDL: Working Together

* Chicken, stir fry, curry, rice, fruit
* Let's push for First Drafts
* You have paperwork to get done.
* Living Room is livable, but I want to see the laptop wiring become completely unproblematic. 
** The goal is that if we switch off VC to work together, it costs them very little time to do so. It needs to be easy and fast.
* [[Mathing]] has been fun. I hope we have more time for it. 
** The videos take much longer because we have to pause so much. Good. 
** Let's keep it fun. I'm not fun when we are going to practice. We have to wait for now. one thing at a time, and fun is better than nothing. Also, still an experiment.
