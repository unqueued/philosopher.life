title: 2018.12.20 - jason.koebler@vice.com: Agreed

Hey Jason,

I agree strongly with the conclusion in https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbanny/we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites. I don't think this replaces FB for most people who clearly use it as an aggregator for passively curating content through FB's algorithms. It's pretty difficult to defeat the centralization of power enabled by the sheer inertia of the network effect, especially not when FB can monopolistically buy up so many competitors.

It is clear to me that personal websites are necessary for a number of reasons. I'd be happy to explain my view in depth if you are interested. I've recently had [[a conversation with an ex-FB employee|2018.12.05 - JYU: Thank You For The Gift]] which might be a decent window into the problem.

Also, I'm a huge fan of [[Tiddlywiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]]. I think it solves a number of problems for noobs and skiddies like me. You should check it out.

I'm living what you are preaching. I am extremely doubtful we will succeed, but I have [[hope]] in its possibility. Hit me up if you are interested in speaking out loud further with me; I'm here to have a [[hyperconversation]] with you.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
