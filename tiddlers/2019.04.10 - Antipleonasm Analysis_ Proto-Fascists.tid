title: 2019.04.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Proto-Fascists

A lot of the people who call themselves Left I would regard as proto-fascists.

I agree. Of course, I think anarcho-syndicalism fails to address the fundamental contradictions in capitalism and would likely still generate markets which mimic a form of fascism as well. Fascism is a difficult word to pin down. I'm still convinced my vision of the practical implementation of Rawls' conception of [[TOP]] is a necessary component of the solution. 

I am, of course, extremely interested in decentralizing [[power]], but it turns out we're conceptually required to maintain the Rule of Law, itself a centralization of power. How do we decentralize the construction and maintenance of this structure [[irwartfrr]]? Again, [[TOP]] is the best starting place I can find. I begin with the egregiously politically incorrect top-down model, whereas the popular Scanlonian perspective is bottom-up. I agree that the practical heuristic must be computed bottom-up, but we aim for an ideal goal outside of ourselves which is top-down. This is our plight.

How do we ensure the Rule of Law does not become fascist? Radically effective representation is the only possibility. I find most people lack imagination, but their goal isn't to maximize our implementation of the ideal (from selfish reasons, I've found). 

The notion that maintaining the Rule of Law requires centralized planning in everything is wrong-headed. And, I am glad to see [[Saint Chomsky]] recognizes how Leftism can be distinguished from maximal centralized-planning. 

I'd like to point out how many Leftists ultimately support notions like IP and censorship. That is a form of fascism. Here, I must side with many Libertarians. I agree we have a right to educate others, but I am opposed to preventing the possibility of freespeech (and, it's why I'm extremely interested in well-made anonymous zones) or preventing people from using non-rivalrous intellectual objects without profound evidence (and incentivization can be accomplished in other ways). All this said, I think [[Saint Chomsky]] and I tend to agree more than we disagree (which is uncommon for me).
