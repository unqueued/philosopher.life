Remember. Copy, steal, and imitate shamelessly!

With a buttload of names like this, it's easy to plug 'em all in in quick succession and skim their work, but     look     this is beauty. You gotta take your time with beauty.

The one's that are alive are probably on Instagram or other convenient social imaging networks. The ones that aren't might take a bit of digging to get to the good stuff.

This list is not comprehensive, and it isn't tiered in any particular order.

I'll probably wake up sweating furiously in the night as I remember an artist I've left off. Oh well. 

This is just a jumping off point. 

Have fun exploring!
