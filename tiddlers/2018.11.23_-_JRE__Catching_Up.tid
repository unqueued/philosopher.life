I've been out of touch with my brother for the past couple of days. It was excellent to have a conversation with him. We talked about our Thanksgivings. He helped me process it.

My brother gave me excellent advice about a redflagged social consideration, and he is clearly worried about me with good reason. He gently warned me about my openness and transparency here as well.<<ref "r">> I am not as worried as he is, but he made damned good points; I am now on higher alert for it. He continued to inspect this problem with me from many angles with solid examples and parallels. He is a reliable indicator in a variety of social considerations that I am not. Even if he feels like he is a one-eyed man leading the blind, I am extremely grateful to him for looking out for me and giving me advice; I clearly need it. He has given me much to think about.

My brother is sleeping A LOT! He is in depression sleep territory right now. He's thinking about other meds. He's having a hard time feeling motivated, though he still has control over himself to get stuff done.

He went to a new therapist. She was quirky, opinionated, clearly open to surprising things, and my brother is going to see her again.

He is enjoying his time with Rebecca. He is less anxious about a baby, but the last meeting they attended made it clearer to Rebecca that in utero and genetic predispositions will likely make even baby adoption problematic in the long-term. I will also suggest that her own genetics may be a problem. I think there are problems in both our families.
