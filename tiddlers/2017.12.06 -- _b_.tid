I am a man who tends to remember his disagreements with others for a long time, much like showerthoughts and anxieties we relive. The last time I saw my brother's SO, I had been explaining that I thought my son was born about a month late. Normally, even when she disagrees with me, she doesn't treat me like I'm stupid. This time, she laughed at me in a very superior tone, like I was an idiot. She claimed it was impossible (note, this woman has never been pregnant or gone through the process, although she is fairly intelligent and knowledgeable). That irked me. 

To be clear, I think I had excellent evidence. I know the signs of my wife being pregnant from our previous pregnancy (although, they differ). When the doctor told us (i.e. estimated) the date of conception, and I disagreed then as well (you may accuse me of bias right here). I thought it was earlier given my wife's symptoms. I'm not a doctor, but I know my wife better than the doctor does by far. A month before my son was born, my wife went into labor.<<ref "1">> He was the right weight and size to be born, but they artificially prevented the birth because of what the doctor said. We waited a month, and then we had the birth. My son was born 9 pounds; he was a huge, in the 90th percentile for weight. However, except for the first month or so, my son has always remained in bottom 25th percentile of weight.

The fact is, some women do give birth to their children 3-4 weeks beyond the average gestation period. I'm strongly convinced that occurred in our case. Hence, I was annoyed by being laughed at.

Part of the problem is her inability to understand the epistemic limits and the role of science. She's not philosophical about it, in fact, that's often the larger problem I encounter with her.

I have no control over her ignorance. I am often correct when other people do not believe. I should not feel bad about it, and I shouldn't let it get to me. I could be wrong, but that doesn't make me unjustified in my belief either. It's okay. I need to let it go. I need to focus on what matters, on what I do have control over.

My brother also doesn't want to be philosophical with me to some large extent. It's a sacrifice in his happiness he doesn't want to make. I'm not sure what he really wants; although, I think he doesn't even understand what he really wants, and he's too scared and hurt to look. He needs a big existential hug. He needs to cry and wrestle. It's not in my power either. I can only be kind. 

I will be philosophical with or without him. Indeed, whether or not someone engages with me via my wiki is a key litmus test. It is weird to say that, outside of my wife, my best friend doesn't care that much what I write here. It is painful and difficult, I realize. Kant and Aristotle in gimpsuits? I don't know. He is right; he's broken. Unfortunately, I can't fix him. I can only be there for him and hope he chooses to fix himself.
