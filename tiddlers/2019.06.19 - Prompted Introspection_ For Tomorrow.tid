title: 2019.06.19 - Prompted Introspection: For Tomorrow

!! As a whole, do you live for tomorrow or today? Explain.

Tomorrow. Despite the success of [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] and my gratefulness for what I have, I have little global [[hope]]. I think empathizing with my future self and the lives of others requires a commitment beyond immediate gratification. I think I do so in an idealistic way which most pragmatists would confuse with living for today though. My style is much riskier, less certain, far more painful, and perhaps even unlikely to succeed. While I make some big leaps and clearly lack discipline, I would not characterize myself as impulsive or hedonically focused. I'm thinking about my [[4DID]], as I see that as my overall responsibility.
