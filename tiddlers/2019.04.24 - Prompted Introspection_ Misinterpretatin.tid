title: 2019.04.24 - Prompted Introspection: Misinterpretatin

!! Tell about one of your mother-daughter/son activities.

Clearly, I dun misinterpretated this line of questioning in [[2019.04.22 - Prompted Introspection: Family Time]]. I'm meant to be the latter, not the former. Alright, so this is {[[Vault]]} material.

I miss speaking with my female donor about what matters most. There was a time where she would attempt to understand what I had to say, or so it appeared. I miss the appearance, the illusion of having donors that gave a shit. It sucks to see how much of it was a lie, that is was Truman Show simulation-esque. It has radically altered in meaning for me. It was Alice in Wonderland, depersonalizing, derealizing, and a joke. I don't really miss the delusion, but I wish it never happened.
