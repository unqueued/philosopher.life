!! Why do you think people are stupid?

Because I'm an arrogant son of a bitch? Lol.

No. I don't think I'm better than I am most of the time. That's part of my applied intelligence: knowing the boundaries of what I know, knowing what it means to know, etc.

Intelligences come on bell curves (or some kinds of distributions, normalized, bi-modal, or otherwise). On some of these curves, I'm very high. That sounds insufferable. To you, I say, [[Know Thyself]]. Of course, I'm bound to see the slopes that others often cannot. Stupid given what standard? 

To be clear, I'm still not sure if it is malice or ignorance in many cases. 

Yo, Samwise, fuck you.
