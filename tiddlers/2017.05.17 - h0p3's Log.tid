!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

I'm doing well. I've had some rough dreams (not exactly nightmares), but I did get sleep. I've not felt as much anxiety since diving back into my work.


---
!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

My wife is gone for the next three days away at a professional Librarian conference for the major universities and colleges in the Appalachian region. It's exciting. I'm hoping it goes well with the kids while she's gone. 


---
!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

Today, the kids have been laxer about school. The fact is that their mother is in charge of keeping them on task because when I do it, I'm a brutal taskmaster. It isn't like the work is different, it is simply a fact that I suck at motivating people to do the right thing. I'm fine giving rational arguments, but beyond that, we encounter different kinds of problems. 


---
!! What are you going to do about what happened?

I'm going to try and chillax with my children. We're going to play magic tonight. I will require them to write in their wikis, but I'm leaving the rest of their schoolwork to their mom.

Oh, I looked up my dryer. It can use a 3-cord. The amperage is fine. I picked one up from Amazon. I won't receive it until Monday. I'll fix it then.
