Do you believe in karma?

Do I believe in karma?
5 MIN AGO
Nope.
5 MIN AGO
I don't think justice obtains in reality.
4 MIN AGO
Most of the time, evil reigns.
4 MIN AGO
I think there is an objective fact to the matter of the degrees and kinds to which we are intrinsically and contingently good or right given universalized standards.
2 MIN AGO
That is the only judge that matters to me.
2 MIN AGO
I think there is no reward for being a good person (far from it) beyond being objectively a good person.
1 MIN AGO
I think being evil effectively enough allows egoists to lie to themselves in just the right ways to climb ladders of power, still maintain relationships which matter, and maintain a semblance of integrity in their identity. I'm not interested in mere pleasure, and I'm not interested in eudaimonia tout court. I'm interested in justified eudaimonia.
NOW
How about you?
NOW
I don’t know. The Bible gives us rules to follow and how treat others, saying we’ll be rewarded in the afterlife. As far this life is concerned there is a certain amount of hardships we face with no reward other than an “atta boy”
NOW
Brb
NOW
The concept of heaven evolves over the time frames the Bible is written. It's evident in the transitions from the OT and NT as well.
2 MIN AGO
I think good Biblical interpretation will point out that you should not worry about heaven at all. There is only trying to build heaven on Earth that matters.
NOW
I mean I don’t worry about heaven. Just like I don’t worry about what the Revelations say about the end of time. It’s inconsequential to how we should act on earth.
2 MIN AGO
But, I do think there is a level of Karma or divine cause and effect.
1 MIN AGO
That sounds like a pleasant belief to hold.
1 MIN AGO
Don’t patronize me [[h0p3]]. Lol
17 MIN AGO
Lol
17 MIN AGO
I just see too much of what I’ve done coming back around. It’s like there’s no way someone could have this much bad “luck” unless there was another reason.
15 MIN AGO
I am radically opposed to Prosperity Gospels, but I am willing to reason carefully (to whatever extent I can) about consequences in physics (which is hardly to say I'm a physicalist). I cannot speak to whether or not you deserve your luck. In fact, I usually think of luck as that which is outside your control, even though I appreciate what it means to build yourself to take risks and capture opportunities as well as anti-fragile construction.
13 MIN AGO
I think the vast majority of people do not get what they deserve at all.
12 MIN AGO
But, of course, it's highly probable that some people in some contexts do get what they deserve.
12 MIN AGO
I've seen too much starvation and dark-triadicism in my life to accept the world has any sort of cosmic justice in physics, and I have no evidence for such a thing in the noumena. I would argue that it is precisely because I only have one life that it is meaningful in the way that it is.
10 MIN AGO
So are people inherently good or no?
8 MIN AGO
3% of the population are altruists. The rest of us do not deserve to live.
8 MIN AGO
That's the short oversimplification.
8 MIN AGO
People can be inherently evil while still having the freedom to become and do otherwise.
7 MIN AGO
I see psychological egoism as a fair description of the vast majority of homo sapiens, but I do not think it is prescriptive by any stretch of the imagination.
7 MIN AGO
It is why I hold everyone so very accountable for who they are.
7 MIN AGO
Do you hold yourself to that same standard? And are you of the 3?
3 MIN AGO
I do hold myself to that standard, and it is why I work so very hard. I suggest I am not functionally constituted by [[The Golden Rule]] effectively enough.
2 MIN AGO
I am doing my best to bind myself to [[The Moral Law]] all the way down.
2 MIN AGO
To whom much is given, much is required.
1 MIN AGO
(btw, this is perfectly in line with Biblical teaching as well)
NOW
I have a pretty decent knowledge of biblical principles, you needn’t remind me of the golden rule and the story of talents. :wink:
20 MIN AGO
You will have to forgive me. I am often unaware of how knowledgeable others are. I was actually referencing notions like The Remnant and The Wages of Sin.
18 MIN AGO
I bring up [[The Golden Rule]] only to directly answer your question of why I think I'm not one of that 3%.
18 MIN AGO
How do those pertain to what you were talking about?
15 MIN AGO
I’m failing to see the link.
15 MIN AGO
Well, I have a harsh view of who we are as a species. It doesn't fit contemporary sensibilities and conventions. Most people work to validate identities and diversity in relativistic manners. In casuistry, my belief about the 3% doesn't fit most intuitions or the conditioning most people don't seem to question. I don't claim that is you, btw. The Remnant is about the faithful few, even among the many who claim otherwise, especially in times of crisis and catastrophe.
12 MIN AGO
The notion that most people don't deserve to live is also one of those very harsh judgments. Who among us lead lives that merit living again and again into eternity? Not many.
