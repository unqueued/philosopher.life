title: 2018.09.11 - Deep Reading: Fear: Trump in the White House

So, I told my wife I wasn't going to read this after [[Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House]]. I can't help myself. This author is a different beast. He knows the rules, been around the block, and might have different motivations for defending/attacking "The Man." This one will take me more than a few hours to get through, but I hope the price is worth it.

It's interesting to see the discussion of underling actions here. We've seen the murmurs. I don't know what's true.

I don't know what to say, but when Trump says "it's rigged," I'm forced to agree. He's obviously part of the problem, but I don't think he's wrong on that point.

This is a non-trivial look into the background of Trump's candidacy.

Glad to see Mercers in here.

Picture feels real. 

NYT paper of record, but lambasts it. I hate to say it, but I feel a version of that myself.

The magic of the campaign. I'm going to throw up.

"Do not consider myself your peer." Lol. Jesus H.B.F. Christ. This thing is so emotional, I feel like I'm in a 2-minute hate.

Why the fuck do we hear absolutely nothing on Pence so far? Does it not sell enough books?

If we can have a science to subvert democracy, surely we can have a science to fucking build [[Outopos]].

I have no fucking clue how Trump survived the debates. Actually, this book makes me question why I was so convinced that Trump was going to win since before the primaries. Why did I think that? Look, Clinton is profoundly evil neoliberal garbage, may she burn in hell with the rest of the Democrats, but Trump's story makes no fucking sense (on top of his evil).

The Russian interference is an odd subject. It was where I decided that Wikileaks was being used for something evil. Something went very wrong.

I can't tell how much Bannon is a genius and how much he's just a liar. It's a solid mix.

I have to admit, they do play the media game well.
