Step aside from the universalized qualia problematics of postmodernism. Set aside the de se/de re issue. Set aside the private language considerations. Set aside the language games, beetle boxes, and the fundamental skepticism of other minds. I suppose we can't fully, but I'm trying to.

What I have left is still this ridiculous gap. I can only bridge it so far. Here's something I need to stoically accept:

* I'm an autistic savant with odd variances in my intelligences. If you generalize it, it's pretty high. When you particularize it, you'll see it stretches across some odd spectrums. The stories I tell are going to look weird to others.
* I can't expect the average person to viably interpret what I'm writing. In a sense, Josiah is right. I need to get back to that fact. 
* If I'm having trouble seeing it, how could I expect someone without my intelligence to see it? I need to be more merciful in how I interact with others in the dialectic. I'm not being fair enough!
