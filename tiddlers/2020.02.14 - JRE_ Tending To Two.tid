So what are your plans for the weekend?
Feb 14 2:57pm
Nada at the moment
Feb 14 2:59pm
Just smoked a lil today, playing a game called risk of rain 2
Feb 14 2:59pm
Interesting rogue like
Feb 14 2:59pm
Same char, over several stages with random drops that stack and the monsters just better harder and more numerous as you play
Feb 14 3:01pm
Oh
Feb 14 3:01pm
That does sound like it would be up your alley too
Feb 14 3:01pm
Fun lil game, especially when you find a way to specialize your char by trading out items to make multiple copies of key onew
Feb 14 3:02pm
Aye
Feb 14 3:02pm
I am glad you are doing nada. Good. Some breathin' space.
Feb 14 3:02pm
I'm joining you on the trip-train. First time I've used bliss since the the trip.
Feb 14 3:04pm
I love bliss
Feb 14 3:05pm
=D
Feb 14 3:05pm
You will need to let me know when you run low. I don't know what kind of cartridges to get either.
Feb 14 3:06pm
Where do you get yours from?  Dont want ones from outside legal production areas I think
Feb 14 3:07pm
You remember that Captain Planet show? The episode about "bliss"? Lol. I'm like a stoner: "fuck yeah, dude, I want dat"
Feb 14 3:07pm
I've never had one.
Feb 14 3:07pm
I'm thinking about trying the dial-in thing. I'd prefer to be able to just be high for an hour sometimes.
Feb 14 3:07pm
But, I can travel to MA to get them.
Feb 14 3:07pm
!
Feb 14 3:08pm
Still using my same old batch atm
Feb 14 3:08pm
Niiice
Feb 14 3:08pm
Got my knife, very nice.  It is my official desk knife, thanks!
Feb 14 7:31pm
np, it's not as useful as the one you gave me, lol, but still pretty
Feb 14 7:31pm
You happen to take any pictures or videos of the process?
Feb 14 7:32pm
I don't know. Will ask [[k0sh3k]].
Feb 14 7:32pm
I thought we did.
Feb 14 7:32pm
She says we do, has to find em
Feb 14 7:33pm
Btw, the bike came in. It's super nice.
Feb 14 7:34pm
[[1uxb0x]]'s piecing stuff together. I'm glad.
Feb 14 7:34pm
Did you prompt him to write a thank you email, or did he think of it on his own?
Feb 14 7:35pm
I told him to say thank you. I did not know he was going to write you a letter, lol. Thought he was going to call you up or message you.
Feb 14 7:36pm
Going through my logs of 2019. I just wanted to reiterate that being able to play with you was extremely special to me. It was a highlight of my year, and I'm always going to remember it very fondly.
Feb 14 11:45pm
It was great to play so cooperatively. I enjoyed having something to metagame about with you. I'm having a hard time picking out anything I enjoyed more last year than that in terms of total hours and pleasure. Thank you! =)
Feb 14 11:47pm
Hey, how's your weekend going?
Feb 16 1:58pm
Rebecca was super sick all yesterday and still not great today.  Says it was the most pain she has ever felt due to major crampage and throwing up so much.  So just me and the boy this weekend
Feb 16 6:49pm
=(
Feb 16 6:49pm
Wow. Food poisoning?
Feb 16 6:49pm
It's probably been emotionally exhausting for you.
Feb 16 6:50pm
Tending to two is expensive.
Feb 16 6:50pm
