My teacher didn't show up. I waited for over and hour, and he didn't come. I studied the chapter more. I actually don't mind. I really need to continue studying this chapter. It has so much information in it, I don't feel confident enough on it.

On the way back home, I stopped by the union center, but Randy wasn't there, as usual. Bad sign, I take it.

I also called Johanna at AB&T. She picked up this time (easier to reach her in the morning). She thanked me for the list, and she said she already submitted for the money. She was instantly denied. Apparently, the massive organizational restructuring also means none of her clients (participants, she calls them) can receive any funds, even though these funds were previously allocated. Johanna sounded desperate and extremely unhappy. She told me she is considering leaving her job. I asked her if she thought it was unlikely I would get my tools. She didn't say anything directly to it, but she said she would know more definitively next week. She appealed the denial, and she hopes to win it. This isn't the first time she has appealed on my behalf. I hope she wins, but I'm pretty convinced she won't at this point.

My teacher called later in the day. He apologized. He said I could take it tomorrow, so I will. He also asked about the tool situation. I explained it. He told me I absolutely must bring some tools to the job, so I will. They might be shitty tools, and I might not have enough or the right ones, but I'll do what I can. What else am I going to do?

I found a $400 room close to my workplace. I called the fellow up. I'm socially awkward, and the phone call went pretty meh. He's calling me back later. I think there is a reasonable chance I'll have it ready for Sunday. My wife's friend's neighbor may be calling me today as well about a room.

I continued studying.
