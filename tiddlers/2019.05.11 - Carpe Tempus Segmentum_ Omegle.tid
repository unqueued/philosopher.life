title: 2019.05.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Omegle

* Woke at 6
** Ugh. No bueno.
* Binged Tosh.0, Corporate
* Chilled with wife
* Shower
* Fireman Time!
** Solid ordering, as usual.
* Kids were arguing philosophy with people on Omegle. 
** Go for it. Chill and/or sharpen your blades.
* Fitness Routine
* Chores/cleaning
* Coffeebliss
* Read+Write
* Dialecture
* Talked with [[Gary]] in person today.
** He had no spoons left after the graduation brouhaha. We still talked about schools, we thought about the wiki, he called me a subversive, he gave us a dumpster-doven gift, and he said we would schedule a time to talk again. 
* Date
** Pizza! =)
* Blessed nap
* Superstore and pie.
* Kids have been chatting a lot on Omegle.
** I think this is valuable interactive practice, low risk (when you play by the rules), and an opportunity to explore others and themselves. I must continue to help them see people for who they are.
** We talked about identity containment problems they are facing. This one is up to them.
*** I'm going to need to speak again and again with them about it.
** My son is having a difficult time staying connected, but I think he will develop better timing. I'm considering spending some of my CS time on this. Raw familiarity in messaging contexts is a 21st century skill, even for proles.
*** We take 1 hour of Humanities time writing the [[Core Daily Requirement]]s, why not spill over extra time (and incentivize speed) into Omegle?
**** I prefer 1-on-1 for them since I can be far more useful to them in this space. Crafting communications for larger audiences is another kind of work. 
** My daughter is combative and wants me to help her destroy arguments and define terms. I need her to take her own reigns here. Her ability to context switch and hold multiple conversations is impressive.
