Dialectic

0.
Focus now, my Sweet,
This is a hard one -

1.
All things spiral on the spectrum:
Mind and Matter;
God and Man;
I and Thou, my Love;
Love and Love at opposite swings of the Pendulum -
For what is Hate but the refusal to reach for the Center?

2.
Gentle Artemisia knew nothing but The Good
In her vengeance:
Her hand drawing Judith's down with the blade,
Slipping delicately
(But oh
So forcefully
And all unwanted)
Through Holofernes' throat -
What better way to immortalize
The silenced plight of women
Than bright color on men's flesh?
A twist, perhaps -
Digging for a little more depth
To finish the work.

3.
Precise concision calls for
The correct cut -
The Right must be painted in stark outlines
And Red.

4.
Phocas 
The Gardener practiced The Right
And a difference of Justice:
Plowing his plot by moonlight for another type of seed,
Preparation for the last Harvest.
While soldiers slept glad in his hospitality,
He worked his garden -
There would be rest enough in the morning.
Sinope was fed again,
And who does not weep while eating his Brother?
Still, hunger is never satisfied for long;
The soil needs turning each Spring.

5.
Concise precision is messy -
The Good bleeds into and over and beyond the
Outlines.
Accountability and Righteousness do not play nicely
Necessarily.

6.
We need a bridge
If we wish to touch.

7.
Swinging wide,
Striving for the center,
Spiraling around and down and towards the Center Star
We are
In the gravity well of the accouchement
The Good and The Right giving birth to
In blood and tears and Love
The Beautiful.
