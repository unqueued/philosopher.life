*** Bullshit. I'm sorry, I'm not going to ignore causality here. It's obvious that an entire generation completely fleeced the poor and future generations. They really do deserve to die. Yet, I must protect the 3% of legit altruists whom I can't peel out nicely (especially after false/mere virtue signaling).

*** I'm disappointed by double standard I see in those offering us this bridge. I really want Eastern philosophy to be more useful to me.
** http://nautil.us/blog/forget-everything-you-think-you-know-about-time
*** You know, I've read about these kinds of things since I was a youngin'. There's the huge empirical monkeywrenches, and then the conceptual/logical issues beyond it. I can't understand either one.

*** Incompetence for now. =)

* Think About It
** https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2018/08/29/near-term-effective-altruism-discord/comment-page-1/
*** Perhaps this is different. In my experience, effective altruists are doing whatever it takes to confabulate their way to selfishness while virtue-signaling just enough to appear like they aren't terrible persons.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/opinion/race-politics-whiteness.html
*** As long as you aren't denying that classism and capitalism aren't problems, I can agree these are non-trivial motivations.
** https://zettelkasten.de/posts/three-layers-structure-zettelkasten/
*** That was a shit argument against wikis.
** https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02621-x
*** That's actually one of the reasons I'm so transparent. It creates a space for 3rd parties to make judgments about me.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/books/review/splintering-william-egginton-coddling-greg-lukianoff-jonathan-haidt.html
*** I can't say I'm particularly fond of tone-policers, rhetoricians, or those who can't argue when they are offended. I generally think most humans don't deserve to breathe given their current choices (and the possibilities of who they could be, imho...I do hold them accountable). Humans are offensive to me most of the time. I still try to interact with them as best I can.

*** Good? The overlords drive me insane.
** https://www.wired.com/story/why-californias-privacy-law-wont-hurt-facebook-or-google/
*** So...we aren't going far enough.
** https://www.ibtimes.com/why-do-american-muslims-fare-better-their-french-counterparts-2189449
*** Okay, I can see this. I've had lots of worries about several Euro countries doing the same. I'm not convinced that the US is radically better, especially not where I live. You have no fucking clue how much the muslims I know have had to hide that fact.
** https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/postmodernism-didnt-cause-trump-it-explains-him/2018/08/30/0939f7c4-9b12-11e8-843b-36e177f3081c_story.html?
*** Seems like McManus should be able to agree to much of this.
** https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-collapse-of-the-middle-class-and-the-rise-of-a-new-precariat-audio/
*** Perhaps it is worth my time. I agree to the precariat. I think the middle class has almost always been a myth though. Please don't confuse income with wealth.
** https://nolanlawson.com/2018/08/31/mastodon-and-the-challenges-of-abuse-in-a-federated-system/
*** I think it really has to be decentralized. We all have to contribute, participate, and filter. We have to work together to build [[Outopos]].
** https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/31/reddit-moderators-speak-out/
*** The official Reddit response is some hilarious bullshit. Look, you either decentralize hard or you are centralized service attempting to crowdsource (i.e. passively exploit "volunteers")
** https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2015/0619/Opinion-Paper-the-least-terrible-password-management-tool
*** Encrypted TW, imho. I appreciate the willingness here. I disagree with two-factor, since I think you trade things like privacy for it all too often (depending on the implementation).
** https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/03/what-would-a-socialist-america-look-like-219626
*** I appreciate these responses. I can't say I fully agree with any of them, but they are wildly closer. I fear the neoliberals in sheeps clothing or the slip into such a thing. Not enough discussion about the means of production or decentralization in these notions. Part of the problem is that work in this domain is so heavily discouraged and underfunded that we don't see nearly enough theoretical and empirical work on the matter.
** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05994-9
*** I consistently see the trope/theme/notion in psych that the speed with which we must perceive or judge reveals the truest nature of who we are on average.
