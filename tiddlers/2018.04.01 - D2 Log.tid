I hit 91 today. It's slow going, and the grind is not fun. I've not had a single piece of high end anything drop with +350% MF the entire time. Grinding Hell Mephisto is much slower XP, but it actually drops something once in a while that matters to me. I suppose I'll keep grinding Baal, since there are some items will only drop from him while also being one of the fastest ways to get 92 (if not the fastest). I'm glad I didn't make HOTO or drop any ISTs into Alibaba. 

Also, I tried D Clone without the CB revives. I got crushed. I'm so truly merc dependent, and I'm used to using him as my point man. I have to go full blown defense for him in this case, I believe.
