** You are forgiving, which is something I am not.
** Played well in Magic, and doing better in school work.
*** Did better than his sister thought he would.
* j3d1h
** You chose to sacrifice for your brother. You did the right thing, even when you knew it meant you would have to do more work because of it. I think that shows integrity.

* k0sh3k
** You are the rock of the family. You hold us together while we change, even under enormous pressures.
