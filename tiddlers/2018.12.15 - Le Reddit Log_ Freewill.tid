It is my opinion that you are asking about the problem of autonomy and freewill (even if only reduced to habituation of our dispositions, but I think it can be extended much further). Only some parts of your identity are mutable. I attempt to engage in that systematic process here: https://philosopher.life/. Feel free to hit me up, homie. =)
