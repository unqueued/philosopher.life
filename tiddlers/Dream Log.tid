title: Dream Log

I am very wary of dream logs, mostly because I'm convinced we are so prone to confabulate our dream narratives. That said, if I've slept more than I needed, and I am in an almost semi-conscious state while still dreaming, I am more prone to remember my dream, at least the outlines. My goal here is to write the outlines that I'm convinced happened in the dream, but not to write details for fear of embellishing. 

I usually sleep with a computer next to me anyways. So, being able to wake up and immediately write it down is logistically possible. I'm going to give it a try.
