[4:34 AM] h0p3: That is a bopping banger. I am surprised it got stuck in your head. We only heard it once! Lol. I usually have to hear something a couple times before it sticks like that.
[4:35 AM] h0p3: I have no idea why that link isn't working. =(...Works on my devices. I'll be on the lookout for a fix here.
[12:38 PM] Sohalia: Ugh. I’ve only been at work for one morning and I already feel the dark “I hate this, why am I here, this is hopeless” feelings trying to crush me.
[12:38 PM] h0p3: :frowning:
[12:39 PM] Sohalia: But, I lost a whole year to those feelings. I refuse to lose 2020 to them as well.
[12:43 PM] h0p3: IIRC, Tuesday has the highest rate of job applications. Coming back from time off (the weekend) is a strong reminder, maybe an energizer.
[12:44 PM] h0p3: I'm sorry you are feeling hopeless. That is a terrible feeling.
[12:46 PM] Sohalia: It’s just the worst.
[12:46 PM] Sohalia: I think I need to strategically plan time off ahead of time to give myself space to apply, think about where to go next, and keep myself mentally healthy.
[12:47 PM] h0p3: It may be hopeless there in that spot, but I bet it isn't hopeless more generally or in other spots. Yeah, strategy makes sense. Like incrementally climbing ladders of quests or something.
[12:48 PM] Sohalia: I certainly have the PTO time for it.
[12:48 PM] h0p3: You probably need to hate where you work to be motivated to leave it in some cases.
[12:48 PM] h0p3: Maybe schedule once a week off for it?
[12:48 PM] Sohalia: Oh for sure.
[12:49 PM] h0p3: Don't know if they would even allow for it.
[12:49 PM] Sohalia: Idk if I can get that, but if I strategically place two days every now and then I bet I can get it.
[12:50 PM] h0p3: Save hard for FU money; even the knowledge of being able to walk away safely for some number of months might make it bearable.
[12:50 PM] Sohalia: ...that’s a good point.
[12:51 PM] h0p3: My favorite will always be working on finding another job while I'm at my current job. An hour day where you take a giant shit on their time. Delicious.
[12:51 PM] h0p3: Hard to do though when it's so emotionally draining though.
[12:54 PM] Sohalia: Truth
