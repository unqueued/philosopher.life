!! Tell about the happiest day of your life.

I don't know. What kind of happiness? I think my first non-alcoholic drug experience, LSD, was mind-blowing. I was euphoric and shocked by what I saw. It permanently altered me and paved the way for me to think outside the box. I'm glad to have what openness I have, and psychedelics helped me. 

It was a shattering experience of [[awe]] in the sublime. I've experienced things more intense and [[beautiful]], but from a utilitarian perspective, the duration and fecundity of pleasurable events during the trip were unmatched. It was 12 full hours of [[redpill]]ed [[Diamond]]. I was deconstructed, and the world appeared reconstructed.
