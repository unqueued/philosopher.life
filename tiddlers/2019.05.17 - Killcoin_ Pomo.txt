Propaganda
12 MIN AGO
My wife loves it, and I love my wife.
12 MIN AGO
I'm watching Easy.  It's a stupid show as well.
12 MIN AGO
Sooooo, ergo, you like it?  Or like it enough to endure it?
12 MIN AGO
I have deeply mixed feelings about the show. Sometimes I crack up. We have to pause the show to talk about it. Othertimes, I am furious with the show. It is a wide range. Usually, however, it is chill and it doesn't matter whether I pay attention or not.
11 MIN AGO
That's kind of how this show is.  I can discord, I can take pics, all while watching and not miss much.
10 MIN AGO
It is our background narrative.
10 MIN AGO
How you been?

Been fighting an infection, been fairly stressed, but life has been good.

Veep, you like that show?
13 MIN AGO
Also watching the tailend of Venture Bros again. I've watched the first 5 many times, but I've not paid enough attention to the last couple.
13 MIN AGO
Sure. It's an interesting show.
12 MIN AGO
Hmmm, maybe I'll give it a peak.
10 MIN AGO
Currently going through this list roughly top to bottom with the kiddos: https://philosopher.life/#TV%3A%20Library
10 MIN AGO
I've been wanting to rewatch Sex and the City too.
9 MIN AGO
My goal is to have a strong memebase with them. We need stories, metaphors, and myths to think about.
9 MIN AGO
I've not seen the show.
9 MIN AGO
Discord is something I still just can't seem to get into. I use it for technical help, connecting with some individuals who prefer it as a medium, and group chat sometimes. How do you use it?
24 MIN AGO
Umm, I'm a member of a few groups and a mod of one.
12 MIN AGO
Most are collecting groups
12 MIN AGO
You have a very interesting pick of shows.
11 MIN AGO
Definitely post-modern there.
11 MIN AGO
Lol.
10 MIN AGO
Why do you think that?
10 MIN AGO
Where's the Green Acres?

One of these days, Alice.... To the MOON!

Well, I didn't grow up with those shows. I also am trying to keep the list as short as possible.

I mean dude, you're basically a Reddit Brah
7 MIN AGO
It's true.
6 MIN AGO
Been using Reddit for a long time.
6 MIN AGO
It's bleeding through to your wiki.
6 MIN AGO
Though most of these shows were not from Reddit
6 MIN AGO
Glubadubglubglub!
5 MIN AGO
Ah, that's not where it really bleeds through.
5 MIN AGO
They sit there and jerk off to R and M
5 MIN AGO
I'm a huge a fan.
5 MIN AGO
Blow their load over some Seuchan sauce.
5 MIN AGO
Noooo!
5 MIN AGO
Not everyone can appreciate the depth of the show, ofc.
4 MIN AGO
Sorry, I have a love hate relationship with Reddit.
4 MIN AGO
Mainly hate.
4 MIN AGO
It's hard to speak of it monolithically
4 MIN AGO
And it's gotten worse since they've banned all the good subs.
4 MIN AGO
No, it's really not.
4 MIN AGO
I was not a fan of their censorship.
4 MIN AGO
It's one huge SJW circle-jerk.  Mainly progressive/liberal minding ideology that they're trying to force upon the rest of the site.
3 MIN AGO
I agree that plays a significant role.
3 MIN AGO
How dare you not vaccinate your newborn child or how dare you circumcise them.
3 MIN AGO
Don't you spank that kid!!!
3 MIN AGO
Fuck off.
3 MIN AGO
My usage of it has decreased dramatically in the past year.
3 MIN AGO
How have you have systematically explored it?
2 MIN AGO
Dude, I have been from one end of it to the other.
2 MIN AGO
Yeah, lol. Me too. EZ.
2 MIN AGO
It's just that one end keeps getting closer to the middle because they are banning more and more of it.
2 MIN AGO
I'm afraid you do not pay enough attention.
1 MIN AGO
It's okay /pat
1 MIN AGO
Explain?
1 MIN AGO
It's being largely squeezed toward the left of the Overton Window, but I see significant censorship of those to both extreme left and right.
1 MIN AGO
BAHAHAHAHAHA
1 MIN AGO
That's the dumbest shit I've ever hear [[h0p3]].
NOW
I hear ya
NOW
They might clip some posts from some far lefties like "all slave owners deserve to die" but they're cutting out whole subs from the other end.
