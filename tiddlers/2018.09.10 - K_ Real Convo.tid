 I appreciate it [[h0p3]]. >_< How are you doing today?
11 hours ago
 Doing well. Unfortunately, making people sad/angry on the internet (which is not my intention).

 So, thinking about that.

 After the explosion post Digg fiasco, downvote became dislikes. A lot of mature conversational ranking tools disappeared. It became the mediocrity of democratic mob rule.

 I’ve just stopped caring if I upset people online tbh. I’m nice to strangers upfront until they give me a reason not to.

 I attempt to cooperate through at least one failure to cooperate on their part, then I ignore.

 That sounds like how I rile people up when we’re raiding with randos. Emoji image of 'joy'

 Keyboard courage is an awful thing.

 I wish there was a way to circumvent it.

 Building virtual community in which we are not physically reminded of our vulnerability, where we don't have the affective instincts to empathize (relying heavily on the cognitive), is a difficult problem. It's not going away either.

 I’m trying really hard to thicken my skin when it comes to dealing with volatile people because I’m truthfully a very sensitive person and I tend to overreact to things that aren’t that big a deal.

 I believe sensitivity is empirically (and conceptually) linked to intelligence. I don't think your sensitivity is a bad thing at all, although I appreciate the need to defend yourself with thick skin in the appropriate contexts. I'm not terribly good at knowing how to be vulnerable to others in the right way.

 My own personal rule of thumb is to prioritize honesty and tact at the same time. I can’t find a good balance between the two. But I also believe that vulnerability is what made my relationship with [[L]] work. It wasn’t until a few years into our relationship that could even share emotions and problems with her. Bottling things up is an awful thing to do. Emoji image of 'skull_and_crossbones'

 Same dude. If I went back in time, the first thing I would do is slap the shit out of myself. Emoji image of 'sweat_smile'
