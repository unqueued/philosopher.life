title: The Attention Merchants

I don't know how much I'm really learning from this book. Yes, it is fascinating. I've been so immersed in the topic for so long that I'm not shocked. That's okay. I'm glad to see this telling of it.

I very much wonder what the author would think of the work I'm doing on this wiki. This is consciousness in action, and yet, I often divide my attention among a host of evil drugs he talks about. That said, I probably have a lot more practice in ad blocking, piracy, and technical tools for managing my attention. That's very much what good computing looks like. Perhaps I am wrong though. I will need think about whether or not I have succeeded and how I can improve.
