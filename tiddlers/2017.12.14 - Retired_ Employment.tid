I'm getting into the Union, I hope. I need to have notes about the books they gave me. I also need to start getting together my resume, etc. Practicing for the interview. I want to walk in as a 3rd year if I can. I need as much experience and knowledge as I can get, preparation as well.

Employers I'm pursuing until the Unions (Local Pipefitter and Boilermaker):

* Jacobs
* TEC
* Allied
* Powell
* Performance
* FLSmith (Powell related)
* Quartering tool
* Thompson
