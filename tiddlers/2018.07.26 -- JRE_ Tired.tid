title: 2018.07.26 -- JRE: Tired

My brother and I had a difficult time getting our phones to connect. I don't know what's up. He called me back after putting Raylan to bed. JRE was really exhausted. 

He sounds stressed about work, and not just because he's worried about being stuck with Carl (who is a complete asshole). He's tired of getting in trouble or feeling like it's all messed up. It makes me sad and angry (not with him, obv) that he feels pressure even though he isn't doing anything wrong. His explanations show he's being rational. I'd be lucky to even make those "mistakes," lol. He was going to sleep early tonight, and I probably kept him up later than I should have. He told me he was calling from his bed.

Oh, he said he'd be interested in doing the online DND game with L and the rest of us. I think that's awesome! I really don't play games with him often, so I'm excited by it. I am surprised my brother has not mentioned anything about L and I connecting again. 

I talked about the kids and I working on i3 (it's been a lot of work). We had a discussion about what it was used for, and I did a pretty shit job of explaining it. I think my brother would find it really cool if I could say it better. I could tell he was trying to throw me a bone, but I wasn't communicating it well enough. We talked about chat programs. I think it's odd that we spend more time talking about the software than it takes to just install it. He's resistant to even trying tools on this front, but I don't think he's being rational about it. There's an emotional issue I'm not understanding here.

We talked about my wife's presentation, and then we talked about a speech he gave as a best man at his friend's wedding. He argued that speech-giving was harder than teaching/presenting because the latter is based on expertise (I would argue the best man clearly should be an "expert" in the newly weds). He told me about an embarrassing part of choking on his wine before the speech, and he felt rebuffed by another friend who said my brother's initial draft targeted my brother instead of the the couple. He recently spent a weekend with them. He got "roped into" doing free electrical work for another friend's mom. I am glad he finds meaning in these relationships.

We discussed [[kickscondor]] a bit. I tried to point him where to look (there were several links to reason about), but I don't think he quite got what I found interesting. 

I think his emotional energy is consumed with life right now, understandably. /hug. Sometimes I worry that our relationship is just draining to him, that he doesn't actually enjoy talking that much. That's entirely possible; I don't know. I do know: something is off. His affect continues to get flatter, which is a sign of several possibilities. I don't trust (or want to trust, which is a specific version of not trusting) my modeling in this sphere enough, so I will think more about it. It seems pretty clear that of the possibilities, talking to himself is something he desperately needs to do. My current guess is that life is very difficult for my brother right now, and I'm not helping (but, I'm also only able to support him here; he literally has to spend time reasoning about it with himself). My brother's depression is already here, but the full force hasn't hit yet. 

I hope he sleeps well and tomorrow goes off without a hitch.
