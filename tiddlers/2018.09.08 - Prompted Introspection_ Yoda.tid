title: 2018.09.08 - Prompted Introspection: Yoda

!! What is your fondest memory of an animal or pet you once had?

Yoda the cat. He jumped into my bath water to swim every time. Gorgeous black, long-haired, chillest creature I've ever met. My brothers, wife, and I still talk about Yoda. I'm gonna pour one out for my homie tonight.
