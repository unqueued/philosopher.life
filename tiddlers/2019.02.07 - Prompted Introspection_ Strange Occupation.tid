title: 2019.02.07 - Prompted Introspection: Strange Occupation

!! Do any of your friends or relatives have strange occupations?

I've responded to this question before: [[2018.01.07 - Prompted Introspection Log: Relative Occupation Strangeness]]. I guess strangeness to me is more about a moral strangeness regarding an artificial normativity generated upon mere social conventions. Strangeness to whom, with respect to what standard, and why does that standard matter?

I had a friend who did video editing and encoding for pornography. He was a homeschooled kid, could barely keep any schedule, was wicked fucking smart, terrible at Everquest (famous on that scene actually, but never got past 51?! with 4 times the amount of time I played), a Guitar hero god, and a lost soul. I hate that I don't even remember the dude's name. I remember the strangeness fondly.
