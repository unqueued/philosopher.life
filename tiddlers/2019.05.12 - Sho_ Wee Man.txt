Dude! What happened!? Are you ok?

To my understanding so far, I had a systemic fungal infection which has been clearing up. Unfortunately, it dried my penis enough that cracks + friction made small cuts which led to a bacterial infection. It swole up this morning, and I went to the hospital. IV drips for antibiotics and antifungal. Thankfully, I don't need a cath yet.
