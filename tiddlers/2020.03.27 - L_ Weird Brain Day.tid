title: 2020.03.27 - L: Weird Brain Day

"""
[12:44 PM] h0p3: How's the day going?
[2:49 PM] Sohalia: It’s been a weird brain day for sure
[2:50 PM] Sohalia: I had an intense episode of “don’t touch me and please stop making noises” earlier, it was very weird.
[2:50 PM] h0p3: Aye. Weird brain days during the pandemic. I know that feeling!
[2:50 PM] h0p3: Overwhelming
[2:50 PM] Sohalia: Probably didn’t help that I had to go shopping when that was happening and there were waaaaaay more people out than there should have been.
[2:50 PM] Sohalia: Apparently social distancing means nothing to these fools lol
[2:51 PM] h0p3: Still feels fairly busy outside (though not as busy here). I am not sure what to make of it.
[2:52 PM] h0p3: rate of infections for CT is about second in the nation right now, if I understand correctly. Seems like people might take this part more seriously.
[2:52 PM] h0p3: (I realize not everyone can)
[2:52 PM] Sohalia: Oh my gosh....
[2:53 PM] Sohalia: Our rate of infection is lower, thank God, partially because precautionary measures were taken so early. KY’s numbers are so much lower than even IN. It’s crazy.
[2:53 PM] h0p3: You feeling better?
[6:14 PM] Sohalia: I am now yeah :slight_smile:
[6:14 PM] Sohalia: I basically went and sat in our dark closet (with the door open) so I could get some quiet. It helped immensely.

[5:22 PM] h0p3: How's the weekend treatin' ya?

[11:41 AM] h0p3: How goes it?
