title: Hidden: Paranoia

If I had a zillion dollars, I'd secure myself (like a little child dreaming in his room) with at least as follows (with preference given to things actually possibly applicable to my current life):

A faraday cage, locked, hidden room, where we could all hide if there was trouble. A true end-of-the-world shelter. A safe room. A safe room in a safe house in a secluded, highly indendent, residence.
