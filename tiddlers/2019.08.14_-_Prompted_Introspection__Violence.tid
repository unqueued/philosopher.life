title: 2019.08.14 - Prompted Introspection: Violence

!! What is your opinion about the amount of violence on T.V.?

I have answered this before: [[2017.12.15 - Prompted Introspection Log: T.V. Violence]]. I find most people are irrational about the topic, and I consider it a red-herring for faux outgrouping and misdirecting our attention away from what matters most. I have stronger opinions about those who think this question matters than the subject itself. This question is violent sophistry. Fuck off.
