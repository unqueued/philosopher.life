//I dedicate this page to the rational, responsible drug-takers I've met and learned from.//

I'm starting to take cannabliss again. It's officially time to not be ashamed and instead embrace my morally responsible use of illicit and semi-illicit substances openly. I'm going to root that bad feeling out of myself through reason (and I think it is reasonable to do so). In case you somehow feel entitled to an explanation for it, take the time to inspect my defense. Are you a fair judge? Let's put it to the test. 

I realize there are people who would disagree with this move.<<ref "1">> I think my reasons are more rational than yours. Please, with your charity, allow me to show you.

I also think cannabinoids have helped me achieve this major transition over the past year. It was certainly instrumental to the changes I've been undergoing over the past 4 years now, but I am going to show you that this fairly long-term positive disintegration was ultimately a good thing. I'm going to be happier because of it.

Cannabis has been a driving force to my pursuit of happiness. During many of my darkest hours, my only remaining will to live stemmed from the desire to feel at least decent (if not happy, then at least being willing to deal with my anxiety and depression) through using cannabinoids in a controlled and safe manner.<<ref "2">> But, even beyond my darkest hours, in the better days of my depression and anxious everydayness, cannabinoids improved my life, and it has made my family happier with great consistency when I use it. 

Cannabis alongside DCK has been a strong driving force in my believing that I could possibly be happy, that it was worth pursuing our happiness, and acting upon it. That meme runs deep through the heart of this wiki, my narrative. Don't you see it? It is part of why it exists, a significant causal force (even if not sufficient in itself) and explanatory reason for its state of affairs. 

On cannabis, I want to be happy. Call it a sin, but I disagree. I don't believe I'm doing something conceptually wrong in the way I take cannabis. So, what argument will you pose?

You will fail to deliver any valid, conceptual analysis on the unconditional immorality of temporarily lowering our IQs or experience machines. Furthermore, you will fail to offer reasonable risk analyses which disfavor it, arguments from selfishness, gateway drug claims, or any other moral argument against my use of cannabis thus far. I challenge you. Show me what your argument is made of. I'm taking the time to say mine carefully. It's your turn.

Perhaps you are tempted to call it an addiction, a physical or psychological dependence which has negative utility (psychopathy, frontal lobe reasons) given some justified scope or a conceptual contradiction resulting in immorality via the CI (empathy, rTPJ/supramarginal gyrus + other ideally, fundamentally, or constitutively virtue theoretic brain structures). This wiki is my shield against that claim.

Being high has made my life better and the lives of my family better. This wiki was the primary force behind and record of that, and my cannabis use has been the primary force behind the wiki.

You do realize the beginning of this wiki, its predecessor, its cultivation into something I would do while not high, its major works and movements have been grafted, written, or structured while high, right? The overarching strategizer for this wiki was high at the time of writing it. 

While I'm high, I can see the world through a positive lens, or at least have the willpower of h0p3 to see that life can and will get better, that it's worth living. Sometimes cannabis is the only tool that has been able to help me see the world that way, to act on hope, and to do my existential best. All too often, being high on cannabis was the necessary key to empathizing with myself, which I so desperately needed to do. 

On cannabis, I not only have the hope that I can be both ethical and happy at the same time, but also the will to do so.  That's what I'm aiming for. That's what I mean by [[eudaimonic lifehacker]]. Cannabis helps me in the rational, scientific, philosophical, and practical pursuit of being a eudaimonic lifehacker. 

Again, this wiki is a profound example of the executive functioning it enables in me, and it enables me to find the means to my happiness. Essentially, cannabis has been instrumentally necessary to being a eudaimonic lifehacker at the moment (as it has been for a while). In time, I hope even that that condition will pass. Again, the goal is to be unconditionally happy, which means without relying upon medicines, drugs, etc.

This wiki is a golden standard level evidential justification for my use of cannabis. This wiki is proof of positive dependence upon cannabis, not addiction. Look at the [[{Home}]] page. That page was made while I was high (it evolved while I was high), and the links it contains were all made while I was high. Look at them: 

* {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]}
* {[[Principles|Principles of Programming Myself]]}
* {[[Focus|Current Focus of h0p3's Wiki]]}
* {[[Projects|Projects on this Wiki]]}

* {[[Help|Help: On this Wiki]]}
* {[[Connect|Ways to Connect to this Wiki]]}
* {[[Verify|Cryptographic Verification]]}
* {[[Contact]]}
* {[[Legal|Legal Notice]]}

The overall architecture, reasoning behind, and functional design choices were made while high. I am open to guiding myself, programming myself, planning, and doing important existential thinking while high. It doesn't hurt as much, and I have the will to pursue truth and wisdom on cannabis. This wiki, so far, is one of the best pieces of evidence that being high has been good for my family and me.  I have fought to become happy on this wiki, and my will to do so was fueled by cannabis. The argument seems clearly in my favor, and the burden of proof seems to be on you.

But, wait, there's more! 

I will continue to show you that cannabinoids have been part of the right medicine for me. Below you will find a list of thoughts, as well as wiki page edits and creations. Here is the [[Highdeas Log Template]]. Please, look at what I built or modified today on Cannabis:

Ask yourself: was that rational enough? Can you accept the moves I've made while high on cannabis? Do you think I was thinking clearly? Was I being wise? Did I maintain intellectual and personal integrity while high? Does this make myself and my family happier? Be honest with yourself: is my self-medication really failing?

So, besides an attempt to claim "addiction," what argument do you have?

It is my opinion that for most people, their belief that cannabis is evil or wrong is due to a lack of drug education (which, on average, is about as terrible as the lack of sexual education people receive in my region) and a set of social (often religious) conventions and habits that have not or cannot be justified. I believe these people are ignorant and often lacking empathy for drug use (several sciences back that claim up). In other words, they don't have a rational argument against my cannabis use.

I'm open to your suggestions, comments, and criticisms. Do you think you have a better argument? Go for it. The gauntlet is thrown down.

Until then, my current concern is maintaining my employability. I believe I can safely do it once a week. I'll be testing myself to find out the breakpoints for my particular body on THC tests. I can isolate how many days it takes to pass a urine test (some are more sensitive that others, and we'll work our way to it). I have the time to figure this out before my next hire, and I should take that opportunity.<<ref "3">> In my moral weighing, the risk adjusted cost/benefit ratio makes cannabis worth using in this manner and context.

<<footnotes "1" "Allow my paranoia and the most mentally ill part of myself speak if you will. My parents likely think I am mentally ill because of drugs. I think this is a confabulation on their part. They must see me as being mentally ill, addicted, etc. to drugs in order to explain my behavior and massive shift in beliefs. The thought that I am right about God is literally that horrifying to them. The bias, trained intuitions, and the sacrifices in time, energy, relationships, and other investments are quite strong. To be wrong here is to cost them everything that they take themselves to be. It would depersonalize them for me to be right. They care more about their own sanity than mine. They literally do not empathize with me because it is a matter of memetic survival for them. If you have the right to use your opiate of the masses as a dependence (if not an addiction), then why can't I do the same with cannabis? What possible justification could you have? I am glad to have escaped, and endured the mental difficulties in escaping from, the insanity of their perspective.">>

<<footnotes "2" "I am highly methodical. Consider, for example, the list of drugs I chose to use. The major drug experiences I've had are Alcohol, LSD, Psilocybin Mushrooms, Cannabis, and Ketamine. With the exception of Alcohol (which is in itself debateable), my drugs have been selected for being possible direct solutions to Depression and Anxiety. I spent a lot of time researching what I put into my body. Pay attention: I have tried to use drugs responsibly. It really can be done. Alcohol is by far the most dangerous thing I've consumed, and I stray away from it considerably.">>

<<footnotes "3" "I'm also at a workplace that I trust strongly to help me in medical emergencies, even though the majority of staff are cannabis users. Also, I have insurance.">>
