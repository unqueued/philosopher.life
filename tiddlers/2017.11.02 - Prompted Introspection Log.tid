Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either - but right through every human heart - and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains ... an unuprooted small corner of evil. 

Since then I have come to understand the truth of all the religions of the world: They struggle with the evil inside a human being (inside every human being). It is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety, but it is possible to constrict it within each person.

There is, of course, a faith here. It goes beyond hedged-conservative description into speculative territory. 

I'd love to have met the man. I honestly wonder what he'd think of my opinion. I doubt he'd care for it at first. Once he understood it, I think he'd appreciate it.
