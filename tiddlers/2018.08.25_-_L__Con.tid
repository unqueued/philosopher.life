 There’s this obscure thing that happens when you go to a can where your brain just kinda shuts off and you mistreat your body because the hype is too strong.

 I don’t know if they’ve met canonically

 there must be many unspoken social rules at these cons
2 hours ago
 what did you do?
2 hours ago
 Yes! Lots of people here are big introverts so it can get really overwhelming.
2 hours ago
 What do you mean?
2 hours ago
 err...I mean, what activities did you engage in throughout the day?
2 hours ago
 did you walk around and talk to others, did you listen to any speakers, did you see a show?
2 hours ago
 I'm sure the cons are all different in this regard
2 hours ago
 It sounds like you went with a group of people you know (from the video).
2 hours ago
 Lots of walking around, taking pictures, meeting with people we know, buying nerdy thing
2 hours ago
 We sometimes go to panels of voice actors we know of or that sound fun
2 hours ago
 And also sometimes stand in line for signatures of voice actors we know
2 hours ago
 But the last two are more rare. Standing in line isn’t very fun.
2 hours ago
