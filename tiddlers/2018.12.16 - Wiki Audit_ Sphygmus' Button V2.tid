title: 2018.12.16 - Wiki Audit: Sphygmus' Button V2

[[Sphygmus]] has developed the second iteration of her button workstation plugin. Wow! She anticipated and exposed quite a bit. The wikification and data dictionary may enable us to construct arbitrarily complex buttons. [[j3d1h]] cry-laughed when she saw $:/plugins/sphygmus/sbuttonsV2/buttonHardcodedList and complained that it wasn't fair that [[Sphygmus]] made it look so easy (since we struggled to even get halfway near just one aspect of what this plugin has accomplished).<<ref "r">> Indeed, [[Sphygmus]] has intuitively understood where I was hoping to eventually go and ran far ahead!

Yet again, she builds another tool of which some version should be in the default blank TW or one of the built-in installable plugins. 

Like any decent Linux distribution, there should be a bare minimum install and a batteries-loaded distro. The hardcoded button should likely be demonstrated even in the minimal distribution. I hope to break that button in half in how hard I use it. A full workstation for developing and managing buttons appears to be rising here, and that is batteries-loaded.

Sphygmus and I discussed this over Signal. I believe we are going to be engaged in what I will refer to as "firmcoding" instead of strict hardcoding because we are dynamically generating the hardcoding on the fly when an update is triggered. Perhaps there is a better term for this.

TiddlerTool required tinkering to get working in singlefile mode, but once I had it working it just worked. Bob requires me to tinker to get it to work every time. I have to head into the plugin and set the batch actions first...otherwise I get a red alert.

I got to 2017.10.14 in [[The Remodeling]].
