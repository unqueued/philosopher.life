title: 2018.02.17 - Prompted Introspection Log: Life Quality

!! Which quality best describes your life?exciting, organised, dull?and why?

I don't know. It depends on what part of my life you are looking at. Dull, of course, happens, but I'd say we accomplish an enormous amount. It's kind of breakneck speed. So, exciting makes sense, although that may imply I'm enjoying it the entire time (which is not true). There are parts of my life which are organized and others which are not. This wiki is a fine testament to that. 

I guess none of them describe it best. It's a mixture. I suppose that can be a good thing.
