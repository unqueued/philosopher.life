!! Audit:

* I've only uploaded a TB for charity in a month. =/ I used to do PBs, not TBs.
* LUKS has not been nice to us recently. I'm very annoyed.
* My daughter has been the admin this month (with help). This is valuable to us both.
* Software still crashing on me. FF just isn't Chromium. =/ They needed Rust to even have a chance at building something as sound as Chromium.
* The split has been valuable. Glad to surf with bleeding edge and just use normal FF for the wiki.
* Admining can still be fun. I love that my hobby is still interesting to me. I don't want to get burned out on it.
* Was halfway paranoid about the Chinese call. That did not make sense to me. I never speak first on my phone when I pickup to an unknown. I have to rule out the bots.
* Keybase is pretty. It's not perfectly stable; it's a good idea. I wish it were more decentralized.
