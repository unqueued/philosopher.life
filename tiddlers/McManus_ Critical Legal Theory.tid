<<<
It is to overturn these power relations using any means necessary
<<<

For me, the questions boils down to objective justification. It's clear to me those in power already use anything and everyone as mere means. I owe them very, very little in [[T42T]]. Slavemasters probably don't deserve to live. 

It's very difficult to defeat those who don't fight with Golden Rule Gloves on. Taking evil means gives you innate competitive advantages, especially in perfect competition where [[T4T]] defeats [[T42T]] reasoning until a sufficient number of players (with sufficient units of privilege) are playing [[T42T]. Ultimately, I'm okay with taking very extreme means to defeat Hitler, Peter Thiel, Bezos, and any number of psychopathic players.

Decentralizing power ain't easy. I grant that. Performing [[The Original Position]] algorithm is hard! I think once I have a prescription for what it's supposed to be with effective Kantian reasoning, the means to my ends become justified.

<<<
He has also been sharply critical of postmodernism’s skepticism towards truth. 
<<<

I'm despise anti-realism. Insofar as postmodernism attempt to deconstruct without constructing, it is flawed. There is, of course, a difference between denying the ontic possibility of truth and questioning the political structures which enable us to heuristically improve our justifications and pursuit of truth.

<<<
 the central philosophical claim of critical legal theorists: that the neutral pursuit of truth is not just impossible due to biases established by power relationships, but because the terms in legal language are themselves often indeterminate. 
<<<

Let me grant the conceptual limits: do we therefore just give up? The inability to achieve certainty of The Foundation will always be there; we can only improve our Bayesian odds and take some things on faith. Hopefully, we bootstrap our way into more effective epistemic foundations. 

I actually don't know the future of legal language either. Much of it may become automatically coded. I have seen enormous failures in Eth's VM, but that may one day be resolved. Insofar as we have humans negotiating the meanings of the law, of course, we will continue to have another layer of biases. I suggest the determinacy is something that can be adjusted to some [[dok]].

<<<
“the life of the law is not logic: it is experience.” 
<<<

Aye. And, I get how you take us into the limits of language. Gödel has something extremely important to say here too (since English really does include Arithmetic). We're not going to escape our Kantian representations, and we can never attain the certainty we crave, but continually trying to express the ineffable just is what we're doing in philosophy.

<<<
In these cases, the linguistic terms making up legal rules are not easily interpreted.
<<<

Speaking of Gödel and the constitution, I think he saw several such problems, including The Criterion of The Law. 

If we agree with Wittgenstein, it will only ever be an assumption that we play by the same language rules. Should we just stop talking? It's a matter of faith.

<<<
The problems posed by legal indeterminancy in hard cases have proven so intractable that even legal positivists, once the high priests of the neutrality in the law, have largely accepted them
<<<

Legal positivists have no right to talk about //morally justified// governments. They only buy us a conceptual analysis of what even counts as a government. They are hardly in a position to discuss neutrality.

I get that postmodernism points to the fundamental flaws of conceptual analysis (both in continental and analytic traditions). That something is intrinsically vague, of course, doesn't mean we should stop pursuing clarification. Postmodernism is a critique that destroys itself; it causes the philosophical program to segfault. If there is prescription at all, then postmodernism must be wrong. Exactly how or why, I think, is a matter of faith. Handling the pomo critique doesn't mean we can just dismiss it out of hand, ofc. It's got a role to play in how we bootstrap in this grander dialectic (as it always as, since these skeptical critiques are as old philosophy itself)

<<<
Many critical legal theorists argue that, since many of the terms making up legal rules cannot be neutrally interpreted, Judges tend to interpret legal rules to protect the interests of privileged groups in society.
<<<

Preach, yo!

<<<
How does one make judgements in important hard cases where legal terms are indeterminate and do not readily permit a neutral interpretation? Unless one can answer this, critical legal scholars will always be tempted to look at the often privileged background of Judges for insight about what they will decide.
<<<

Make them write wikis like mine; they should be radically transparent. Force them to give up rights to privacy and all holdings. FMRI examinations of dark-triadic traits should be analyzed. They should be able to strongly articulate the critical theorists point of view and explain what they are trying to do solve it; they have to be demonstrating an evolving theory and practice.

More importantly: build decentralized power structures. This is the only way out. The Golden Rule demands we weigh each others' Reason as fairly as possible. Technology is a double-edge sword, and if we're going to solve our crisis, we have to start pouring public funds into an electronic voting infrastructure that is radically different and more expressive of the will of Humanity.

<<<
 Dworkin famously argued that law is a deeply moral enterprise aimed at “integrity.”
<<<

There is something right about it, though it doesn't appear to be the whole story.

<<<
Kelman concludes his article with a call for “conservatives and classical liberals”
<<<

Ad hominem time: the goal is prevent The Left from decentralizing power. This call is psychopathic.

<<<
The goal of a just legal system aimed at getting the right answer to legal questions is to establish a more fair and equitable distribution of goods across society.
<<<

DING DING DING! Of course, fleshing out these basic structures is a very hard problem in gametheory+computer_science. Once you accept the Kantian grounds and convert it to [[T42T]], you have the basic rule to optimize in your infrastructure. [[The Golden Rule]] must be at the heart of justice.
