title: 2020.02.25 - Prompted Introspection: Cellphones in School

!! Should cellphones be allowed in school?

In the building? Generally, yes. Within arms reach? Generally, yes. After that, you need to figure out the fitting rules for the particular environment. I've been in school settings where everyone having their phones out and in use was necessary. Most of the time, it detracts from the dialectic of the classroom. It's not a simple problem. 

It reminds me of when Sarkar said I was "really married to that machine." It's true. I'm glad about that too. It's why he got the kinds of real-time arguments and papers he did from me. School without my computer is hardly a functioning classroom for me. I don't think cellphones will be like that though. I've not had a student who I felt could efficiently accomplish their tasks with just a phone either. 

I know it's fashionable for people to think that computers aren't great for classrooms. The wealthy can afford for their offspring to be illiterate in many respects, crippled even. I grant that it's easy to misuse our devices in the class, and outside of it too. Given how much there is to learn in the process of becoming adept with our devices, I do not see a way around integrating them from the beginning fairly strongly into our lives, including our schools. Beginning with easily re-usable input is too valuable to lose. It's not a native process for anyone, but it's a necessity for a functioning democracy.

Of course, even my own offspring are required to put their phones away during sections of school. It's easy to lose ourselves in our screens. I'm hoping wise cell phone use (even if I hate the machine) will be integrated into their lives strongly.

In the [[Afterschool Teaching]] program, I regularly had to fight to make sure my students could access the internet (and not simply 20 designated sites) through their phones. The answer to the question is: it depends.
