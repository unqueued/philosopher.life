title: 2018.07.01 - Prompted Introspection: Life's Story Entitled

!! If you had to write your life story, what would the title be? Why?

Currently, my title is: //h0p3's Wiki//. I suppose there are many different kinds of titles embedded in this story though. The URL, philosopher.life is also a kind of title. I'm not very inventive, but I wouldn't want to narrow it down to anything that it wasn't, and I hope to be as precise and accurate as I can be (knowing full well there already many errors that I didn't intend). That's important to me. My title doesn't do the work for me, the content does.
