!! How has your health been this week?
* 1uxb0x
** Great, other than allergies.
** He has felt less clumsy this week. 
* j3d1h
** Good.
* k0sh3k
** Felt like her guts were getting spooned out by a dull spoon. 
** headaches
* h0p3
** My finger is doing slightly better.
** I've been feeling very charged at times but also drained in a chillax sort of way at different points in the day each day this week.

!! What happened last week? Have you been happy this past week? Why or why not?

* 1uxb0x
** Unhappy. He didn't choose well. That is, he didn't do his schoolwork, except for Friday.
* j3d1h
** Terrible. Schoolwork didn't get done, and that had a domino effect in her life.
** She is sad that her internet access is bottlenecked to a tiny subset for school only; she misses The Youtubes.
* k0sh3k
** She got a lot done on the student worker manual, and that made her feel productive. 
** Finished a couple books. 
* h0p3
** Worked hard. I missed EQ. 
** I felt frustrated in my job search. I want to make sure that I keep appropriate expectations, and maximize my persistence.
** I felt drained each after work when my kids didn't do their schoolwork.
** Lots of fireman time.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** You've been curious. You ask questions about the world around you.
** Thank you for taking the time to walk through the Socratic method, to make yourself understood, to clarify your meaning, and to communicate to me. I get to understand who you are when you do that. You are showing patience, love, and a desire to connect with me when you go through frustrating conflict resolution and debate for the sake of our relationship.
** You think about how events or situations affect other people. e.g. you went and found someone to do something about the problem in the hallway so nobody would get hurt. You were looking out for other people.
* j3d1h
** You have a willing attitude to help people with their computers. You use your gifts to help the family, not just yourself.
** You've turned the lemons of your punishment (not being able to access most of the internet) into lemonade. You've been resourceful.
** You've pitched in on work around the house without grumbling. You've been mature. e.g. Helping with the cats, your brother's part of the room, etc. 
* k0sh3k
** You've given away a lot of your freetime helping with the family this week. e.g. The extra-duties for our schoolwork this week.
** You've been a good therapist to me. You are a skilled counselor. e.g. Whenever I'm super sad, I know exactly who to goto.
** I've noticed that you have been more open to working on our wikis. In particular, you were happy to try something new, recording ILLs. I think this shows a commitment to us and an openness to growth.
* h0p3
** I did a good job putting up with my family's bullshit [sic]. I kept my composure this week.
** I helped my children with their computer problems, particularly their wikis.
** I showed great smartness in marrying my wife.
** My carpe diem logs have been really cool. 
*** It was embarrassing.
