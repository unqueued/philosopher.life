Well enough. [[K]] and I have been sick with some coughing-throat-thing but we’re better today. Kinda forced us to take a break which was honestly really nice.

Pretty sure I got sick first and then gave it to him via smooching. Whoops...
Nov 17, 2019 5:45pm
I'm glad you have a break. I'm sorry about being sick.

Worth!

I never turn down a kiss no matter how sick my wife is. 
Nov 17, 2019 5:45pm
Hehehe

I hope it doesn't grow worse. [[K]] sounds so freaking busy to me. No time to be sick.

I am a snuggle-bug. I need the lovins to survive.

He is... the sickness hasn’t set him back though because he’s always so ahead.

I wish I could have even a teaspoon of his ability, lol.

Beyond jelly.

Saaaaaaame

Well, I hope you guys get some good soup, snuggles, and sleep. Hopefully, something good to watch. Sent some first episodes of shows over sync (a range of shows in there).

It’s funny how my body always seems to say “it’s time to take a break, damn it” by making me minorly sick. Just enough to be slightly miserable but not enough that I can’t take care of myself.
Nov 17, 2019 5:53pm
Aye, I can appreciate that. Definitely part of why I'm worried for [[K]], since even if he needs a break, he can't take one (or perhaps not much of one). The body is a heckuva signaler to us.
