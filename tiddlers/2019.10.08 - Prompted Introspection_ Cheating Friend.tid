title: 2019.10.08 - Prompted Introspection: Cheating Friend

!! What would you do if you saw a friend cheating?report it, confront the friend, nothing?and why?

Cheating on what, given what context? There are rules which must be broken. I need more information to pick out what is [[salient]] here. I am, of course, opposed to breaking [[The Moral Law]], but there are many cases where I still remain silent even when I see rules (including morally obligated ones) being broken (and I'm considered fairly outspoken among the other humans who know me). Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to generalize this one without being too broad. There are a ton of moving parts to this problem.
