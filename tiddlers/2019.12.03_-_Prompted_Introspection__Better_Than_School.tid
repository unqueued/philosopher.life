title: 2019.12.03 - Prompted Introspection: Better Than School

!! What things are better than going to school? Why?

For whom, in what contexts, and in what respects? I assume you mean formal schooling here, and I assume you mean in substitution. It's likely the case that [[The Matrix]]-style downloading would accomplish much of the same work. There's something to be said for having been in school, but even on this premise, you should technically be able to imbue yourself with the virtues of such knowledge. All else being equal, having been born with everything you might learn in school, including what would be learned by having learned it in school (don't know how you make the qualia leap here), would be superior. 

I've always wished I could just download wikipedia straight into my brain. It's unfortunate that I have to work so hard to have conscious access to things I've learned, and it's not clear how [[The Matrix]] brainhack would do that either.
