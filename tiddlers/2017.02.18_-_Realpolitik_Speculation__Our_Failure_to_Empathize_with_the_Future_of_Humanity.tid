title: 2017.02.18 - Realpolitik Speculation: Our Failure to Empathize with the Future of Humanity

We live in a society where no one believes in anything (in a sense). When everyone lies, we have no one and nothing to believe. The world is so distorted we cannot trust ourselves or anyone else. We can only mumble: "it is what it is." 

We are splintered into factions. We are fragmented. We are beyond disunity. We sit in memetic gridlock as the poison sets in. The collective consciousness of Humanity ruptures, entropizes, and fades. We do not empathize with ourselves. Who are we even empathizing with? Why would we? How would we?

The fakeness of the world hovers between dark surrealism and normality. Understanding reality is such a negative experience that we may even be fooled into believing it is actually derealization. The truth is that the darkness is here though. It isn't merely coming for us. It is already upon us. 

Our dreams are dead. We are disillusioned. We do not have a vision of the future. We do not have hope for humanity. Why would we plan for the future when there is none? We have been well-trained to ignore the possibilities. We are slaves wearing blinders. This is the brutal fact of corporate power. We will not escape.
