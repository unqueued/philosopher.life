title: 2019.07.18 - Prompted Introspection: Proudest Moment

!! What is the proudest moment of your life?

I have no idea. Don't get me wrong, pride is something I'm vicious about. I think I'm the bees-knees in many domains, and I'll generally toe-to-toe with anyone in open dialectic. I like plenty of things about choices I've made, things I've done, and aspects of how I've habituated and constituted my identity and disposition. Oh, don't get wrong, there's plenty to be ashamed about in my life too. I don't consider myself a great person given what I have either; when we scale my moral responsibility, I believe I've not even come close to achieving what I ought. 

My pride isn't nicely captured in a single moment. It's a range or configuration of timeslices, sequences of narratives I tell myself, and it's not a small object. I am proud of this wiki. I'm proud of my offspring. I think my son's progress is a testament to not only his hard work, but mine as well. It's been a radical climb.
