title: Poem: Realpolitik Speculation

```
Here I am human.

Here I righteously cast the first stone the builder refused at you,
arrogantly judge the world as though I'm perfect,
hypercynically assume the worst about people,
and sanctimoniously virtue signal.

Here I act the misanthropic fool and insufferable know-it-all hate-machine,
virulently attack and demonize everyone and everything,
psychopathically gaslight and gleefully disregard human dignity,
desperately confabulate to justify my narcissism and immoral behavior,
delusionally nurture illusions of Machiavellian grandeur,
and inhumanely dehumanize humanity.

Here I otherise and contextomize those who disagree with me,
uncharitably strawman and ad hominem my opponents,
maliciously engage in self-serving idealogical framing,
McCarthyistically hunt for the witches among us,
raid, brigade, circlejerk, censor, shun, persecute, discriminate, 
and manufacture hate-culture.

Here I Drink-the-Kool-Aid,
willfully ignore reality and rational argumentation,
paranoically join my tribes' echo chambers,
enslave myself to my filter-bubbles,
and cover my ears while repeatedly screaming "I can't hear you!"

Here I gnostically Cassandralize,
eisogetically inject and interpolate my adhocish heretical theories into your more "objective" narrative,
double-talk and dog-whistle in the language of doublespeak,
incoherently contradict myself with open hostility,
and whisper the wall-of-text shibboleths of conspiratorial disciples.

Here I cyberbalkanize the splinternet,
viciously disinform myself and humanity,
vitriolically pontificate and trollspam,
fabricate hyperbolic hot takes and propagandistic clickbait,
spew copypasta and freshly forced maymay's,
and irresponsibly speculate while dropping post-truth-bombs.

Here I smugly ramble and shitpost by decorating spurious wordlists,
all for "make benefit of Kazakhstan," 
for the lulz, kappas, and triggers, 
and because I love the smell of my own farts.

Call me crazy if you must; 
I will wear it like armor. 
Go ahead and get your hissy-fit of disapproval out of the way: 
cuck this, kek that, tut-tut, and tsk tsk.
 
Belittle and dismiss me; 
that's all I'm serving to you as well. 
Feel free to claim I both am unhelpfully critical and fail to offer any constructive advice; 
I'm sure it justifies your blindness, lack of idealism, and rationalizations. 

Everyone thinks they are right or justified, 
but you aren't, bucko. 
In theory, people can change, 
but in practice, you won't. 
You are the problem. 

You hypocrite! Liar! Sociopath! 
I've learned not to trust your motives. 
I know what you really mean by your words and actions. 
You are no authority, visionary, savior, or saint;
you don't even have a leg of decency to stand on. 
I'm certain of it. 

I see you for what you really are. 
You are pure fucking evil incarnate; 
you are the paragon of scum; 
you're a monster; 
you are my mortal enemy. 
I dream of slaying you. 

Essentially, I literally hate your guts, 
so please do me a favor and empathize with me by killing yourself, slowly. 
I hope you suffer eternally because you deserve it, sinner.
In case you don't understand what I'm saying, fucktard: 
we aren't friends.
