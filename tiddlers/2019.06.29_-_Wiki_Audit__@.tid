Consolidating [[@]] might be correct. Bouncing between tiddlers doesn't make enough sense to me.

It's better to show the order of the conversation between two or more parties together than apart. Timestamps are perhaps the correct approach, but I don't have a clean way to make them (or it's more work than I'm convinced is worth).

I'm glad to have [[@]], but I'm still not sure how I want to structure it. Obviously, I'm missing fundamentally decentralized chat options which everyone uses, and I'm forced to emulate it.
