title: 2019.03.25 - Afterschool Teaching: Sick

I'm feeling pretty awful today. I'm coughing all over the place, and I'm beginning to think this isn't allergies.

Whitney was there. She seemed off, but I don't know why. We did our paperwork. Matt showed up.

6AB showed me a book on civil engineering. We talked a bit about it until Matt purposely interrupted to grab his attention with cheese videos. Okay. Poor kids. =(

I have a new student: 8Hm. Seems like a decent kid thus far. He stayed on top of his homework too. I appreciate that.

Mitchell took Whitney and the 5th. Matt took 4 kids, and I took the rest. I helped 7Mf with her math. She's struggling to even try.

The 8th grade girls made the case that hairbraiding was an art. I am glad they took the time to make an argument. I granted it. Their braids were cool.

I took everyone to the lab. I gave the usual disclaimers. I'm not convinced it will last. 3 other teachers, but none wanted to take anyone to the gym or anywhere else. I believe they were prepping for the possibility of Sonya's arrival.

I feel like a walking zombie, but my usual flat affect masks it just fine. I'm not looking forward to sleeping horizontally tonight. 

The 5th-grade boys wanted to make a webpage after discovering source code. I had to first teach them how to use some basics in Windows first, but we got there. 5JR said he's always excited to talk with me about computers. Cool.

8Tm and I talked about his suspension. His primary reason was that other people had their phones out, or that was the reason he gave after thinking about it.

Toward the end, they quarantined me and then eventually sent me home early. Yeah, I probably should not have been there.
