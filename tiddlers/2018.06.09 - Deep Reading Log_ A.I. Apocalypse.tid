Sounds like just a fun read.

I adore how gaming is about botting now. That's correct. This isn't sci-fi though. I've been at this for 2 decades now. I did not make money off it though.

Meshbox is exactly what I'd want to do with [[Outopos]] and [[The Original Position]]. =)

Fan of NN in fiction. Of course, the blackboxedness should be discussed upfront moreso.

This is fantasy. It doesn't actually make sense.

The evolutionary free market virus worm explosion is hilarious.

This is pulp fiction, and it's not saying anything new. It's not boring though! =)

Speaking language, iterated prisoner dilemma trust building exercises, tribes, etc. Seems like we are facing a functionalist problem with the hard problem of consciousness (basically, the skeptic's openness to dualism, the mystical qualia that we can never be absolutely certain about).

Swathes of the plot feel forced. It's like the author picked out a bunch of interesting issues/ideas (some of them merely nostalgic) and threw them against the wall of the plot to see what could stick. I feel like it's just namedropping/signaling to me without actually developing the meaning of the story itself.

I am pleased with several of the philosophical moves here. We can nitpick, but whatever. Throw shit at the wall, and some of it is going to stick.

I keep running into that phrase "root node" today.
