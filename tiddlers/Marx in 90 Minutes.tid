title: Marx in 90 Minutes

Strathern was hilarious in [[Hegel in 90 Minutes]], and I hoping for an essay which did much of the same work. The best parts of this biography are the standard biographical components. Cool. Unfortunately, the author wasn't terribly charitable to Marx or Marxism, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been. The rehearsal was much weaker than it should have been; I expect more crystallization. 

I feel like I'm reading two different authors when switching between the Hegel and Marx book. I think that point would be lost on neither of them if they were alive today (and gave a shit).
