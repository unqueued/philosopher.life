title: 2018.12.06 - MTG Log: Epic Conversation

We dissected [[MTG Deck: Legacy - Goblins]]. We briefly considered constructing: [[MTG Deck: Legacy - MUDfinity]]. It was a 5-hour discussion of Goblins, and all the major concepts that one needed to know about it (as best we could in the vacuum). My son eventually tired, but my daughter did not. I think future discussions will be a lot easier and faster. My children learned a new vocabulary and saw many flashes of insight into the combinatoric and empirical elephantine hyperobjects here. Magic is chess and poker on turing complete steroids.

I can't get them to read and research fast enough, and nobody is going to hand it to them [[irwartfrr]]. This was some powerful tutoring. I'm hoping to grind the mirror match with them until they have at least a 40% win rate against me. This is quite doable. I think they can practice with each other here too. I used to measure this, but I'm not sure that is really worth our time. I'm fine with just a feeling. I want to get us to a point where they can speak fluent Goblins.

I have decided that Piledriver is a reasonable SB card. If I want to race decks, I need to have it. Whenever Incinerator is worthless, Piledriver is radically valuable to me. The tutorable 1-of will always need to be there. Too many games are decided on it. 

I'm still testing Chainwhirler out. It may not make the cut in the end. We shall see. I think Sharpshooter is often just the better card.

Krenko may merit 2, it's that absurdly good. Kiki-jiki has been fine. SGC is still bomby as fuck. I have loved having him every game so far. MWM was glue enough. I'm still not sure about it though (but I never am). There is more wiggle room than usual. Noice!
