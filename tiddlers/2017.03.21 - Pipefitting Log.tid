He passed the saddle early this morning, said it was great (we didn't change it from yesterday though). We started working on a larger saddle. We smashed that. We then started 45-degree laterals (he had a meeting to go to, so he left us to it). We did a good job, or so we thought (but again, the same yesterday). We even moved onto a 4-on-4 (which is apparently much harder), and he said it was great. He wanted us to continue to tweak it. We did. I also had time to get some welding done. That was nice.
