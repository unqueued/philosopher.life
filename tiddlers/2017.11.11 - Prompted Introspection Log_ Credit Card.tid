title: 2017.11.11 - Prompted Introspection Log: Credit Card

!! How have credit cards affected your life?

Directly? Not much. I've never actually had one. A few years ago, I felt the safety net, ability to chargeback, generating a credit score, abusing the rewards programs, and literally using them for very short-term credit would be worth it, so I signed up for one. But, before I received it, I went through the process of canceling it. It was an odd conversation; the retention officers did not understand (this was beyond the usual salesmanship). 

Not having a credit card has probably been the right move for us. We've not had to worry about revolving debt. We just fall on our faces in other ways, eh? =( 

Indirectly, credit cards, among a wide variety of usury industries, are tied to a significant capitalist threat to the world. We are preyed upon. We do not empathize with our future selves. I marginally understand the value of liquidity and credit in preventing markets from freezing up, but this has gone well beyond that. Unfortunately, there is too much systematic information to understand to try to answer this well. I'm not an expert.
