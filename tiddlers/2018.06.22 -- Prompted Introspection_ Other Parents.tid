title: 2018.06.22 -- Prompted Introspection: Other Parents

!! Consider some of the parents others had growing up. What type of person would you be if you had those situations?

My donors are intelligent people. If I didn't have intelligent parents, life could have been considerably worse. I assume I would live even more in my own head than I already do, a frightening thought. My guess is NEET status without my immediate family. However, there is also a possibility that I would not have learned to care for the moral law, and instead, would have become a terrifyingly effective psychopath who treated the blackbox functional minds of the creatures around me as a game. I'd be an excellent criminal in some cases and very poor in others. That is one thing I did receive from my donors: a profound desire to be as morally perfect as I practically can. I assume that is not where I'd be. Thus, I suggest I'd probably have higher hedonic happiness. The eudaimonic problem I cannot solve just yet.
