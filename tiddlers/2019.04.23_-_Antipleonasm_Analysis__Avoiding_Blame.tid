title: 2019.04.23 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Avoiding Blame

!! Respond to the following gem:

Reactions to our adversity are not entirely uniform. At the dovish extreme, we find Senator John Kerry, who warns that we should never again fight a war "without committing enough resources to win"; no other flaw is mentioned. And there is President Carter, the noted moral teacher and human rights apostle, who assured us that we owe Vietnam no debt and have no responsibility to render it any assistance because "the destruction was mutual," an observation so uncontroversial as to pass with no reaction. [...] Properly statesmanlike, President Bush announces that "It was a bitter conflict, but Hanoi knows today that we seek only answers without the threat of retribution for the past." Their crimes against us can never be forgotten, but "we can begin writing the last chapter of the Vietnam war" if they dedicate themselves with sufficient zeal to the MIAs. We might even "begin helping the Vietnamese find and identify their own combatants missing in action," [New York Times Asia correspondent] Crossette reports. The adjacent front-page story reports Japan's failure, once again, to "unambiguously" accept the blame "for its wartime aggression."

The US is imperial, and we have not restored our victims. Note how justice is only really completed when it is restorative. The retributive cost should be used to alleviate the suffering of the victim. I am not against warfare, but I cannot point to a just war the US has participated in. [[Saint Chomsky]] points out how the Overton window is narrowed between doves and hawks, both of which are at the extreme Right (i.e. serving the elite), in which opposition only appear to disagree, but never on the fundamentals. Failing to take responsibility is dark-triadic; it's about avoiding the costs of integrity over one's [[4DID]]. 

Note, discussing this with the people who live around me is next to impossible. Few think it is a problem worth solving, and most don't even think it's actually a problem. I am a heretic where I live. I am willing to reason with people, but since they will not reason, I'm increasingly forced to use unreason. I hate it.
