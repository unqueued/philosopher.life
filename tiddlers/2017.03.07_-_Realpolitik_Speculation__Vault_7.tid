title: 2017.03.07 - Realpolitik Speculation: Vault 7

According to Wikileaks' Year Zero disclosure today, the CIA has lost control of a very large treasure trove of remote control malware systems, denial of service attacks (even against the internet infrastructure at large), privilege escalation, hoarded zero-day exploits, documentation, and source code to a wide variety of major software ecosystems and standard electronic devices (including smart TVs,<<ref "1">> lulz). Some of these tools are extremely sophisticated (e.g. this is the first time I've seen weaponized air-gap jumping malware in production). It is thought to be the entire hacking capacity of the CIA, which was not previously publicly known to be this extensive. This systematic cyberwar chest now appears to be in the hands of multiple parties. This is incredibly dangerous. From what I can tell, no major computing system has escaped unscathed from this war chest.

The lack of digital fingerprints on these tools is meant to prevent implicating CIA agents. The real humdinger, however, is that these tools were declassified to protect agents from legal action. Essentially, they are unaccountable for black-ops because "anyone" could have used these tools. Now that multiple-parties control it, it is possible we will see these tools wielded openly and strongly in the coming months (before they get patched [assuming they ever do get patched]). It is very worrying.

Beyond the problem that they had these in the first place (no disclosures or attempts to plug these holes), cyberweapon proliferation is wildly different from standard physical weapons (copy and paste, motherfuckas). Also, this is why you don't accept mandated backdoors. When they've got more code than Facebook does and lose it, why should we think they would keep keys to mandatory backdoors safe and unleaked?

Their cyberweapons holdings are in violation of executive orders from the Obama administration (although, I'm far from convinced that Obama was actually in favor of limiting CIA powers). We see the intelligence community is either beholden to no one, not even their direct leaders, over and over again in history, or have been directly empowered to violate basic human digital rights again and again.

It is interesting to see the CIA duplicating the efforts of the NSA. It is difficult to understand exactly how and why it has played out as it has an even harder to understand what it means. While there is cooperation between intelligence agencies, this level of competition says something important about the political climate and relationships between our intelligence agencies, and more importantly, about the lack of oversight from our elected government officials. I don't think this is a good thing, and I don't mean that from a fiscal sense (double-spending, etc.). The CIA lacks accountability and is not controlled even indirectly by the people, and this is a serious problem. They are a threat to democracy and world stability. This is just another player in the deep state (which we've known for a while, but this only highlights how dangerously powerful they really are).

 
Engage your tinfoil hats people. It's not the matter of //if// you will be compromised, but the matter of //when//. I don't give a shit about real or perceived vulnerabilities in technology companies as it relates to their loss of marketshare. I do care that a race towards a technological oligaculture enables the world-scale systematic infiltration, permanent infestation, and loss of control and privacy (and anonymity) of users around the world. 

The only positive to this is that Apple products got hit really hard (I hate people, especially Apple fanbois). What do you expect when the wealthy and cool use the same ecosystem? I hope those fucking sheeptards will see the light (they won't). Linux, BSD, and perhaps the lesser-known OSes appear to be the most resistant (although, even these were hit to some extent).

Lastly, I'd like to call into question Wikileaks' release by calling into question Assange and Wikileaks themselves.

As I have worried for many months, Julian Assange didn't demonstrate control of the Wikileaks private key during his last Reddit AMA. Since the scare last year, he has yet to cryptographically prove himself to be alive (and the cryptographic indicators we do have do not look good). Of course, having the private key doesn't show that Julian Assange is alive or not compromised, but it would at least do something. Given that Assange and Wikileaks have broken their standard crypto and communications protocols (starting about half a year ago), I am still not 100% convinced that Julian Assange and Wikileaks are not compromised. Something is still fishy here. 

Of course, you can point to numerous interviews over the past months and even second-hand accounts of having seen him. I see no reason to trust these second-hand accounts, and the interviews are not necessarily real.

Let's be clear. Assange posed a ridiculous threat to the Hyperclass and the Deep State. Even if he is a psychopath, he is a hero. I'm sure enormous resources have been invested in trying to take Assange and Wikileaks down. Forging interviews is a real possibility.

Text-to-Voice, even for the common man, using any person's imprinted voice, is now so clean that you can't tell the difference between the real thing and the artificial without very serious analysis. However, take state-of-the-art state-level actors intelligence community technology, people who are world class at this, and I believe Text-to-Voice is likely indistinguishable from the real thing at this point. 

Fake facial video can also be created using opensource tools from academia right now. Again, state-of-the-art tools may make it so that we can no longer distinguish real from artificial video footage. Photoshop has long been there. It was only a matter of time before video footage was going to get hit by the same trust problem.

Here's the kicker: even civilian impersonation tools can be computed and displayed in real time. Watching a live interview over video doesn't mean anything at this level. State-level actors could impersonate Assange if they ever captured him. It can't be trusted completely anymore (not that it ever could, but now it is too simple and easy forge human likeness and speech). 

So, here is where I go full-blown conspiracy theory tinfoil hat on you: 

Since there is a non-trivial chance that Julian Assange is compromised, how can we interpret this Wikileaks disclosure of CIA tools? Many parties seem to benefit from it. Why is the CIA being undermined or publicly humiliated? If Wikileaks is a puppet, it is desperately unclear who is in charge and why they've done it. Since we have no proof of these exploits and only a "release" talking about it without any third-party vetting (from what I can tell), there may be another game being played.

At this point, I have no idea. Assange and Wikileaks may not be compromised. I don't think we have the resources to know right now. In either case, it's a terrible thing. If our truth-telling whistleblowers are compromised puppets, we're boned. If they aren't, then the CIA has made legions of costly mistakes which we may all be paying for soon enough.

My maximally irresponsible, speculative conjecture today is that the Russians have armed Wikileaks with this information (I say this as a cosmopolitan who despises nationalism of any variety). Russians likely already have the tools. If so, and perhaps they are the puppetmasters, then Trump's administration will be fighting against a politically weakened CIA. The CIA is thought not to trust the Trump administration. Let us pay attention to if and how Trump responds and benefits from this loss of confidence in the CIA. Trump as a fascist and lazy individual seems likely to hand them significant powers though. My vision is foggy.

I do believe we are at sociopolitical war with Russia. I don't mean that we are fighting Communism (although, there are plenty of fucktards who would buy that). We are fighting the memetic hypernormalization and deep psychopathic corruption of a trillion-dollar kleptocratic Putin cabal who not only owns Russia but now takes aim at destabilizing the world all over (on top of the Western hyperclass variants). Republicans, conservatives, and capitalists are taking a page out of Putin's playbook.

People, it is no accident that the forever neutral Sweden brought back its draft. There are always wars going on, but the war on a much larger scale is coming on all fronts. Jesus Christ. I'm holding my breath. I hope I can protect my family on time.

Lastly, I take it to be no accident that the NSA got hit and then the CIA. The FBI and a handful of other agencies may be next.
