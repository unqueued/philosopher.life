//For the pedantic, picture-perfectionistic, literalist weasels...lawdy, that codification is expensive. I needs me an [[abstraction]], even a half-baked messy one....an abstraction [[for]] what and why? Tell me this now, do I needs me an [[infinigress]]ing [[abstraction]] for that? Are you [[certain]]?//

# Be wise. Use your gut instincts, intuitions, wits, sensibilities, and affective wisdom to guide your cognitive reason [[irwartfrr]] ([[ITS]] in your application), and vv., please.

# Squeeze some alcohol gel next to the sink into your hands. It rubs the gel onto every surface of both hands until the gel has evaporated.

# Gather together the following tools and ingredients side-by-side (with at least 1-inch space between objects) in a safe and orderly fashion on a clean countertop surface at least 2-feet by 3-feet in area:
#* [[Peanut butter|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter]] jar with peanut butter inside the container
#* Fruit-based jelly/marmalade/preserves jar with said substance inside the container
#* Sliced loaf of [[bread|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread]] in a bag
#* A clean plate with a diameter greater than 4 inches, top of the plate facing up.
#* 2 [[butter knives|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_knife]]

# Open the bread bag using your toes, tearing the plastic enough to pull bread slices out without changing their shape (but without any bread falling out during the process), take two slices out with your hands (make sure to squish the two slices thoroughly), and place them side-by-side (with the largest surface areas on top and bottom) on the plate. Keep the approximate midpoints of both slices equidistant from the center of the plate. 
#* Throw bread bag into the microwave.

# Twist the top off the peanut butter jar and set the jar and lid in a safe and orderly fashion on the countertop surface (with at least 1-inch space between objects), with the jar's opening facing up.
#* If there's a seal on the peanut butter jar, remove the seal and throw the seal into the trash.
#* Take the first knife by the handle with your hand (with the blade being closer to your thumb and index finger than your pinky), keep the blade facing away from you, put two inches of the blade into the peanut butter contained in the jar...

# Complete the rest of it on your own. It's left as an exercise to the reader to determine the rest of the demonstation.
