[[FTO: Modes]] requires some tagging. 

I'm doing some of [[The Remodeling]] work on the way. I have so much work to do in my wiki, it's insane. I miss not doing [[The Remodeling]]. I really want Commander though. After the move to Bob (TiddlyTool is ded, unlike, thankfully, Jed) and how busy I've been, it's been put on the backburner.

I wonder if there will come a point where I'm not constantly spinning up new things all over the place. Perhaps it will always remain a giant heap, but I hope to make it cleaner and tighter over time. I still feel like this is meteoric. I hope to have something sane by the time I'm 40.

[[j3d1h]] found that link autocompletion's vnd file was the problem for being able to tab into a tiddler's body via TW5-Navigator. I don't use autocompletion that much (it's often an abject failure) because my browser's addons do have the work for me, but I will miss it. Still, TW5Nav represents something that I cannot replace.

I still don't have the ability to walk through the search results via keyboard. I need to be able to do the same through the sidebar. It's weird to see how TW5Nav just doesn't work out of the box for me.
