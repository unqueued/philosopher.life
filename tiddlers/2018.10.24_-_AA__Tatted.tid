I am truly happy to hear from you both. Words are a hard medium for me sometimes they are almost painful.  I struggle to express myself well and am never happy with the outcome. I am writing this in small amounts throughout my day. (now days) Please if I have written something that may seem offensive that I truly mean no offense.

I really wanted to let you know that I am thinking about you (all of you) and since words are tricky, I chose gifts because I do better with those.  I hope the kidlets enjoyed the toys.  The shirt was not my first choice but Pokémon cards or Mario Party wouldn’t do either.  I hope it wasn’t offensive.  I was really looking for computer humor but failed to find what I wanted.  The book on the other hand was from a study that I was doing earlier this year.  The study started with another workbook and several videos that we went through together as a group.   The book was after I got to know the author through the videos so I didn’t catch some of the things that you did.  But as I read it, I thought often of the two of you because it is your wheel house and I am interested in your thoughts.   I will need to go back and read chapter one after reading your thoughts so I will get back to you on that.  I can share the videos if you are interested and have a Gmail. 

You have known me all of your life.  You have seen me at my worst and hopefully as I have grown through the struggle.  I understand depression because I have been more in than out of that pit since 14ish.  No one however has told me about your autism.  Please tell me about where you are on the spectrum because each person is different and I want to understand as best as I can.

I am reading through your wiki and it will take me a while because each section will take me more than one reading.  So please excuse my slowness.  I am not a quick or complex thinker so it takes me time to process, digest and conclude.

Grandma Lois told me from her death bed that I was born to be “in the middle”.  I don’t want to be the middle man for any of you.  I want to have my own relationship with each person based on my own interactions with that person.  What that means to me is that we share fun, laughter, memories, games, sorrow, grief, ideas, thoughts and respect.  I am willing to listen to what you have to say without any preconceived ideas from others if you are willing to do the same.

I loved you as a little baby boy traveling from Chicago to Boston because you were my brother’s son and I loved my brother more than anything. (He was my protector.)  I loved you as a toddler because you loved me back and I was a kid too.  I loved you as a young teenager and sought to learn about the things that interested you so that we could spend time together even though it got me in trouble often with your mom.  You and [[JRE]] were always great big brothers to [[L]] and we both love you for that. ([[AIR]] was always a playmate and their relationship was different but loved as well.) Somewhere after that, your interests outgrew me and I couldn’t keep up with you. (My mind does not think the deep thoughts that yours does so easily.  Also, I have two methods of dealing with depression besides meds.  One is to stay so busy that I can’t give it space and the other is to sleep. Neither is good for keeping up with family and friends.) We both have had growing families too and distance between us.  Regardless, I really just want to have a relationship with you and your family.  I know that there will be differences in beliefs and I can accept that and even discuss it without being angry or feeling threatened. 

It is much later now… ( so late) but I have read and re-read my letter and though I am not happy about the words, I cannot have you wait any longer for an answer.  Know that I love you all and you are welcome to our home (messy as it is) anytime.  We are again planning a huge Thanksgiving with [[K]]’s family and you are always welcome to join us.  Unfortunately it is still being held at College Heights because that is the only free space that can hold all of us and I know that there are memories there that you would rather not visit.  But… we get together, graze all day, play games, enjoy each other’s company and laugh and have fun.  If not, we should plan another time. =)

Love always

[[AA]]
