title: 2019.07.16 - TDL: Enjoy

* No school for the offspring. Enjoy!
* We are waiting on shopping, which is cool. I don't know what we are eating. We have some curry left, plenty of fruit.
* Omg, I didn't get anything I thought I'd be getting done actually done.
* Will decide when I see my son's laptop. KVM has to be the correct answer here. Both need it.
* At least you are enjoying LOTR. Smashing through it. Keep going.
