title: 2019.04.16 - Prompted Introspection: Childhood Friend

!! Tell about the kind of kids you hung out with as a kid.

I generally hung out with the kids that were in walking distance of my house. I have always been a weird dude, and so you'd have to be open to dealing with my weirdness. I tend to fit in with people who care about truth, morality, beauty, computers, or whatever I have an interest in. I'm terrible at connecting with people who do not share my interests (standard autist reporting in). I can't say I had much depth in most of my relationships, and so I am surprised to see stragglers over the years reach out to me (even through other family members).

I think the move to Red House began a profound disconnect. It was always easier with younger children. I'm not a fan of the social interactions I see around me. It's been a terrible spiral out of society (and growing awareness of it). I suppose I will always be a bit of a [[4eak]].
