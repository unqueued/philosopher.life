title: 2019.09.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: No Mercy

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I have no mercy or compassion in me for a society that will crush people, and then penalize them for not being able to stand up under the weight.
<<<

Oh, preach, yo! I might aim to take this maxim much further than you would prefer. [[Saint MX]], you are looking for basic decency; you're noble in your pragmatism, asking very little of us. You must think me a perfectionistic brute.

I think almost everyone I meet is more evil than good, more wrong than right given what they have (I am so grateful to meet exceptions and angels). I don't think most adult identities in the first world should exist, and it's obvious to me most sufficiently fit that description to varying [[dok]]. I just don't have an accurate button to push, and I can't. Surely I am the evil one for thinking such a thing, right? Lol. I know it's ridiculously unpopular. Oh yesh, it fails to meet everyone's truly educated intuitions on the matter.<<ref "t">> It's just //so mean//. Who could be so hateful? Surely these cynical creatures have no right to call themselves humanists, ethical, or correct; they are the real demons among us.

No. I [[love]] [[Humanity]], but it has a profound dialectical price. Cover your ears and say "lalalalala" all you want: it's the terrible truth. Of course, I want to shake hands.<<ref "r">> What say you, [[Saint MX]]? `/extends-hand`

<<footnotes "t" "[[The Golden Rule]] is not a result of //mere// democratic processes in [[TPK]]. Oh no, it requires everyone is actually trying to stand behind the [[VOI]] while they democratically participate. It's radically less likely. [[Hope]] in the ideal is so painful when confronted with the reality before us. [[ridtyawtr]].">>
