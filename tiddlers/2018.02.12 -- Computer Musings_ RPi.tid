Having trouble with btsync on rasbian. I'm going to simplify and upgrade to stretch.

I've finally figured out how to use upnpc more effectively. Also, I can sshuttle into the remote router GUI! That is amazing!

I'm running into trouble though. So, I'm not going to actually push it through. It will wait.

Took a while to remove the several installations of btsync and resilio sync from the system. Had to delete a group as well. I must admit, Resilio Sync has made significant improvements to the performance of their software over the years. I can feel the difference.

Fucking Deluge. I don't understand it. I've turn off all autoremove features. That seems to do something, and I'm hoping that's it. I really don't want to manually have to do this though, although, I can.
