title: 2019.05.14 - Afterschool Teaching: Clicker

I did all the prep, and the rest showed up late. It's a solid pattern.

I'm glad nobody was too interested in an explanation of why I was in the hospital. Professionalism: that's me, dude.

Matt apparently has been cooking the books for another program. He was telling us about the encounter where he had to lie, and he was proud of what he came up with on the spot.

I fed my children, and I talked with my stragglers. There's no homework, probably for the rest year. Even my readers are done reading. I can't convince anyone to be productive with this time, but we are having a blast in the lab.

The Janitor stopped by to thank me. I told him if he wanted any shows, movies, or anything else to let me know. He deserves access. 

I finally got to talk about Clicker Heroes beyond the earliest of the early game with my boys. Some of the girls are playing Cookie Clicker. I wish I could install the software to show them how to build macros and clickers. I am not holding my breath for the opportunity, but I would love to discuss skinnerboxes with them. 

Some of my 5th grade boys wanted to get their butts kicked in chess. I'm glad to see them fired up about it. I adore that they play games which have some serious deductive or inductive reasoning. I can't get them to give a shit about other arts, but that's okay.

Matt and his fiance are bossing Whitney around, having her execute their crowd control preferences/promises. 

Matt pulled aside 8TA aside and pulled his stunt. He sniffed him, and acted like the kid smelled like weed. I'm not a fan of demonizing drug use and drug users (obviously), but I am glad that Matt appears to care for the kid.

Oh, Jesus. This was a trap. Matt, who had heard the rumor and planned this, is now heading to Delp with this new information because he "doesn't know what to do with it." He told me not to let 8TA out of the room. I'm worried the police officer is now going to shake him down. Fuck that shit. I counterattacked and went to 8TA, I asked him if he had any substance on him right now because I was worried he would be getting searched after Matt went to the office. There's no reason for this kid to get in trouble for this. Is the centralization of power destroying his life, and does he need help? Yes. This isn't helping him.

Also, I had the chance to compliment 5NP2 for helping another student. that's unlike him, and that is the right direction.

My wife called me up. She wasn't expecting me to be at work. She said I was crazy. That's true.

8TA looks like he's getting hit by a bus. =( I think he's going to be okay though.

I talked with a bunch of kids who hated sports.
