title: 2019.03.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Fool Us

!! Respond to the following gem:

It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.

As long as you are telling people what they want to hear, you will be able to exploit their bias of believing their perceptions of reality aren't mistaken. Admitting we're wrong, especially admitting that others have enslaved our minds through deceptive manipulation, is painful. It requires admitting that our identities aren't as meaningful in the way we thought they were. Who wants to believe their identity has been invalidated to any [[dok]]?

Perhaps ironically, that foolish asymmetry is the result of foolishly fooling ourselves in many cases. I am, of course, guilty of being a fool all too often.

In times of deception, we must collectively spend ourselves quadratically to root out snakes and secure trust.
