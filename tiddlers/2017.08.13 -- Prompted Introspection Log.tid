I have a significant collection of images like these. Those lines are all horizontal. Seriously, check it in your image editor. 

Talk about a Redpilled image. What would Descartes have thought? It's such a beautiful, in-your-face example. You cannot trust your perceptions. Your eyes don't lie to you, but your brain's interpretation of those signals ultimately do not convey what you take to be, upon inquiry, more objective reality.

Distortions of perceptions are not merely visual. The way in which we understand the world, the way we perceives its various structures, emergent properties, objects, etc. are distorted. To what extent? I do not know. It is a kind of memetic war.

This is not solipsism, denial of an external world, or any "unreasonable" form of skepticism. It's just a fact of our fallibility, our epistemic flaws, etc.
