** I had fun. Did you?
*[[The Science of Well-Being]]
** Let's see some notes in here, bud.
*[[School plan fall 2020]]
** I like that you are starting low end in JacKris and working your way back up the mountain. Work on those fundamentals.
** You realize that you can shape these, right? You can find other sources you prefer if you want. 
*** I would try to do that were I in your shoes.

** Why did you think it was terrible?
** I'd like to see you collect links and books worth saving (even if you are messy about it).
** I'm glad you've been using your writing tools. It shows.
*[[2020.04.09 – Prompted Introspection: I wish I was]]
** I'm flattered, and I also agree that going for a perfect version of yourself (given that we are [[fff]] and in our own unique contexts) is the way to go. I also hope that you will be able to find many, many others heroes, rolemodels, and at least parts of [[others]] to emulate to some [[dok]].

** Is that the only reasonable interpretation of his words? That's not what I see in them.
*** It seems obvious to me that one can interpret it such that: one can even be an atheist and still provide at least prudential epistemic justifications for the function of prayer.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Been a while since we actually followed a standard curriculum for math. I'd like to see FOL mastered. I'd like to see Life of Fred completed. Math would be a great place for you, but you'd need to work for it.
