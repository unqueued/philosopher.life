title: MB&A

I really miss them. I feel like I failed to connect with A as much as I'd like, but you can't always get what you want. MB and I connected very well. She helped me understand what friendship is really about. She helped me realize I'm autistic as well. Her brother is autistic, and she speaks the autistic-language was fluently, in addition to her other incredible social talents, that I immediately clicked with her.
