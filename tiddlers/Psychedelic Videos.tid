title: Psychedelic Videos

This is my psychedelic trip-art video collection. To me, trippin' is a set, ritualistic kind of trance and journey for me. I have to get in the right headspace, mode, frame of mind, point of view, perspective, etc. I need to line up inside in a certain way for me to see the world from the trippin' perspective. Don't get me wrong, trippin', virtually by definition, requires taking sufficient quantities of drugs and practice. But, just because you are high doesn't mean you are trippin'.   

It is a fact that some of the most celebrated hallucinogens and dissociatives permanently alter your brain. You really do think about and see the world differently after taking them. I believe I'm highly susceptible to being malleable, plastic, and changeable while using particular drugs. I don't think all the mental changes I experience are permanent, but some are. 

Psychedelics helped me empathize with myself again. It's why I started writing again. I'm programming myself by carefully using psychotropic substances and having a conversation with myself; it's definitely a dangerous path. But, we have to care about shaping who we are, and I required serious tools to be able to fix myself.

I enjoy watching my videos in a particular order. Perhaps I continue to relive the experience and see it from different angles or slowly add to it. In any case, I have a lot of fun. It isn't that important to me anymore, but once in a great while I like to look through it. I believe I've milked the majority of utility I'll get out of this. That said, others may find it useful and interesting.
