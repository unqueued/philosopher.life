** I love the command line work you've done. It's really good for a beginner.
** I want to say you are doing a good job working on your writing. I'm glad you are willing to revise and rework it. That's what good practice looks like. This is a very difficult skill for some autistic people, and I'm so proud of your persistence.
** I was happy with the thought you put into the Father's card. 
* j3d1h
** I know that your Sunday School class is not the best or most exciting for you, but you are being gracious about it. 
** Thank you for working on your wiki. I know you hate writing it, especially given my requirements. I'm sorry. I appreciate your willingness to "just do it." I hope that in time you will see was worth every single ounce of your effort.
** Thank you for helping me with roleplaying and for showing me how to do it.
* k0sh3k
** Thanks for helping my dad apply for the job at Milligan.
** Thank you for taking walks with me during this cold weather. I know you hate it, and I really appreciate it. It's what a good wife does.
