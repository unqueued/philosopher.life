You make the call.

thinking about it! there's some significant changes that need to happen before it would be available for public use -- mostly, I need to add variables in (the same way vanilla lets you input the breakpoint options) so that it's not hardcoded, and I need to figure out how to zero out the vanilla variables without including shadow tiddler overrides

there is so little documentation for theme creation....
MON 1:37 AM
I'm curious -- why do you not like the atomization of deep reading into daily logs that are then transcluded?
MON 1:38 AM
I definitely want that thread to grow. I would love to see a bunch of good examples to think about it. Nobody has responded to him yet, lol.
MON 1:39 AM
I don't like the atomization because it created too many tiddlers for no reason. I think it will slow down computation of the wiki.
MON 1:40 AM
It was valuable to be able to measure and experiment, but now I simply don't engage in it for [[Deep Reading]].
MON 1:41 AM
oohhhh ahah I didn't realize it was a reply to someone else! yeah, post it :)
MON 1:41 AM
ah, gotcha! yeah, I liked it because it was easy to see what you'd added each day when checking the wiki :P but I can also understand the tiddler explosion problem
MON 1:42 AM
we might be the only two wikis with a vast & decent amount of written content respectively...most of the public wikis I've seen are mostly either plugin/testing wikis, or really barebones note-taking. David Gifford I think has the most complete one I think & I can't read it cause of the language barrier.
MON 1:43 AM
Aye.
MON 1:44 AM
Why do you think TW doesn't see more use?
MON 1:45 AM
I think it takes WAY more effort and research to set up than other note-taking programs, and can seem unintuitive at first. It's not quite the same as MediaWiki, and it's very different from something like Evernote or OneNote. But really I think the set-up is the biggest barrier to entry, especially when you consider that most people probably want the cloud flexibility that both OneNote and Evernote provide out of the box.
MON 1:50 AM
Aye. 2 click FB/Google account signup straight into a polished driver's seat from any device.
MON 1:51 AM
exactly!
MON 1:52 AM
MediaWiki was 1-clicky from cpanel too for "self-hosted" on a VPS.
MON 1:52 AM
yeah, I definitely considered going that route at one point.
