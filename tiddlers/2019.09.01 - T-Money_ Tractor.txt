How's your weekend going?
SEP 1 2:03 PM
Not bad. Did you get yours started yet? I I know yall had to school it again.
SEP 1 5:02 PM
I've been working outside all day. Not alot of fun, but stuff that needed done. I hadn't mowed the yard in several weeks. Had to mow everything two and three times. And the last part I just used the finish mower on the tractor.
SEP 1 5:04 PM
Still need to bush hog bug maybe later this month.
SEP 1 5:04 PM
The best part about having the tractor is the ability to procrastinate and have the machine do deal with it later.
SEP 1 5:05 PM
Lots of other upside. But that is a big one.
SEP 1 5:05 PM
I csn let pastures and hillsides get high grass and just bush hog it 2-4 times a year. Looks good after I'm done either way, and by being tall it discourages others from trespassing.
SEP 1 5:07 PM
No surprisingly.. But if kept well. Manicured I have more people with golf carts and four wheelers trespassing.
SEP 1 5:08 PM
If I just let it grow up won't come down. But for instance. I moved the path fro. Garage to to and barn to bottom of hill, and up to yard and the area around the caddie shack. But left the rest overgrown. Lol

Of course if time was unlimited and I could manicure the pastures and hillsides better I would. But it's hours of just mowing or bushogging.
SEP 1 5:10 PM
Literally about 6-8hrs. To just bush hog
SEP 1 5:10 PM
Split it up, do it a few times a year, do it good in late fall. So it looks good alll winter. It's not a yard. It's just a field. If left up to. Me I'd let it grow up in trees.
SEP 1 5:11 PM
Lol
 What r yall up to om
SEP 1 5:13 PM
Up too?
SEP 1 5:13 PM
Ah, yeah, my weekend has started. I'm having a good time.
SEP 1 5:32 PM
That tractor sounds worthy.
SEP 1 5:32 PM
Mowing is my hell. The Hank Hill effect does not apply with me.
SEP 1 5:33 PM
I'd like trees myself.
SEP 1 5:33 PM
We're doing well. Grinding away. Family Time, atm. Just finished one-on-ones, and onto our walk.
SEP 1 5:33 PM
I agree with mowing. I do not enjoy it. Tractor is fun though.
SEP 1 5:34 PM
