*** Bayes on meta-Bayes here. I can appreciate many of the moves, but the game is up on [7]. That's the kind of move which demonstrates you really aren't interested in epistemology to me. What is it that you are really then? If I look into the distance, it think this sounds like someone doesn't want to even consider the possibility of metaphysics.

*** Now remember, only the center can be rational or correct. Lol. This is a misdirective call for censorship to an artificially narrowed Overton Window.

*** Capitalism at work. Loneliness is an epidemic. The sexual mating game among species clearly demonstrates that sexual needs are going to go unmet in the dog-eat-dog world. You are free to say nobody should be forced to have sex, but you may not say sex and relationships aren't a need which society has no duty to find a way to satisfy. This is victim-blaming a broad subculture, not all of whom are evil in my view.
*** Overton Liberals (DNC territory) need a bogeyman in for their idpol. It's a misdirection from the centralization of power in capitalism. Look at the lives of the young in general.

*** Why now? This has been obvious for quite a while.

*** I can't verify this yet, but it is right on topic. I see curious, open, in-person, out-in-the-wild, turning-over-rocks, going down the dark passages exploration as a means to growing curation, aggregation, and recommendation tooling, to bring in new blood and fresh air, to experience different perspectives. Multiple models can be generated from well-organized links, and learning to shape those may become a skill. Ultimately, I want to own the process as much as possible.

* For [[T-Money]]:
** https://theconversation.com/what-makes-a-good-friend-99727
*** Since we are on the topic. This is a fine starting place (which is not to say I agree with the article here). It turns out that the  reflective equilibrium of [[TOP]] will be necessary to negotiate the emergent semblance of our conception of [[The Good]] together.

*** Solid rhetoric, extremely charitable mile-high emotional look at OOO. I'm fine with saying there are crucial realms in which we ought not be anthropocentric. You can argue against capitalism, exploitation, and pollution without taking up this flattening sledgehammer. I see no reason not to think consciousness isn't special. You are going to beg the question either way. Unfortunately, OOO also can't define utopia either; you may not privilege anything and it does relativize. It's bad philosophy.

*** No rhetoric here.
