title: 2012.12.05 -- Straussian Plato Statesman Notes

Sept. 5


Each of the 35 writings are a complete whole. Strauss!!!! Every part of the hole is necessary and important and crucial for interpreting. None of these works are a treatise (traditionally). Plays, actions, speech, and arguments are rolled into it – settings and conversations and characters exchanging thoughts make for a complex and rich work. I take it that interpretation must be done carefully. Drama + Dialogue.


In tremendous control of his material (a master author). Why is everything where it is and saying what it is? Explicit errors are there for a reason.


Jesus Straussian Christ!


This doesn't use the normal Socratic method we see in the Platonic dialogues, but rather a 'method of division'. What is he up to?


Philosophers appear in two shapes, sophist and statesman. We are trying to get to the philosopher through the statesman.


Theaetetus represents moderation, and Young Socrates Courage (manliness)


Kinship with Socrates, through the look (Theaetetus) and the name (Young Socrates).


Politikos (Statesman)


Somehow, like how mathematics is privileged in epistemology and the discussion of knowledge, the Statesman seems to be privileged in the discussion of the philosopher.


At the center of this dialogue, we are concerned about the relationship and meaning of the mathematical “measure” and the “measure of the mean” (just right for my purposes?).


For homework: Where are divisions arbitrary? Are humans like herds of animals? Humans vs. Beasts ↔ Statesman vs. Everything else. The divisions seem largely comical – what is the purpose? Explain cloven-hooves? Jewishness.



Political philosophy- the core of socratic philosophy


Part (meros) vs. Kind (eidos –> form, species, look, idea)


Greek vs. Barbarians (not a good division, Barbarian is a bad lumping together)

10,000 vs. everything else, bad – Odds vs. Evens, good.


Classifying reality and finding forms are difficult, we are attached to our own, and our own is privileged when it, objectively speaking, is not.


Plato brings up the Part/Kind ontological problem at the beginning, but does not resolve it. This must be a sign as to why political philosophy is so important to philosophy as a whole.


Obviously Young Socrates got it right by dividing man vs. beast. It is the only rational move in these divisions. Why is he corrected and this is treated as an error? The most accessible reason is that, while of course he right, he is dividing them as two-parts of herd-nuturer. His real mistake, the real thing that has to be corrected, is to the herd-nuturer assumption. The stranger pulls YSocrates down, clouds the issue. Pride and humiliation is an important aspect of understanding what is the human being. The statesman is, in part, asking “what is the kind: human?” You can’t define politics as herd-nurture or feeding.


Political life is part the human condition. Human life is being part of the human community. But, then, why do they use the word Herd? This error was meant to provoke us into thinking what community should be.


King vs. Statesman. They play fast and loose. They have to be close enough that we can substitute one fo the other, but somehow there is a differentiation.


The difference between the city and the herd is that individuals in the city bring there own expertises to support the city. There is a division of labor. And, the ruler seems to be merely one other laborer with his own division. We want to separate him out.



Aristotle-


People who think that politikon (statesman?), basilikon (king?), oikonomikon (household manager), and despotikon (slavemaster) are the same thing…(are wrong)


Politikon and Basilikon must be divided from oikonomikon and despotikon. The city is different in kind from a household, and not just in number. Citizens are related as free and equal, the household is not. Household is not governed by law in the same way the city is. That makes these communities different in kind. Once the city and household are conflated, the leader of a city becomes like the master of a household, not preserving law and freedom and equality.


Both Plato and Aristotle are worried that managing* (oikonomik…root) a city, you aren’t really governing a city.


In the city, everyone thinks they know something, and they wonder “why should that guy govern men?” So, Aristole suggests to be ruled, and to rule in turn. To take turns in ruling.


The mistake of thinking the city and the household are the same kind of community is found both in Aristotle and in the Statesman.



Angler to Sophist (hunter) Paradigm in Sophist

Weaving to Statesman Paradigm in Statesman


Weaving is interesting as a model.


Shepherd *might be a paradigm early on.



258C


Stamp it with one idea. When you stamp it with a seal (of Politike?), it acquires a meaning, and everything else is lumped together as some other eidos of knowledge. This seems to be there very mistakes he has a problem with that YSocrates (supposedly) makes. Why is this hypocritical mistake made?


It isn’t clear that singling out our own, in this process of divisions, is wrong. Perhaps it isn’t. Perhaps some things are just so privileged that it should be divided unbalanced, and not “in the middle.”



258D


There are million examples of ‘practical,’ but why choose carpentry, which is a very bad example? Politics might not make something?


259B


If you have the knowledge/capacity of something, then youa re at that thing. If you have theknowledge of a doctor, then you are a doctor, even if in name or not.


If there is a science of rule, and even if you aren’t a king in name, you are somehow a king on this argument.


It doesn’t matter if you’re a great house or a small city, you are a ruler. This is the mistake.


Statesman and the King, and their respective arts, are intellectual (gnostic).


259E


Number reasoned vs. Architect/Master-builder. Number-reasoning is discriminative and Judging, while Master-builder is injunctive, and commanding.



261?


The ruler does rule living things, but for the sake of what? What is the end of the city? What is the statesman’s end? The architect is a bizarre model in this case.



261D


Statesman is not a private or single nurturer. Maybe this is part of the divide between the philosopher and the statesman, as perhaps the philosopher is a private nurturer? while the statesman is not.


Why call it herd-nurturer? YSocrates doesn’t care about the name, and yet this name and the classification (more importantly) is so deeply wrong.


262A


YSocrates offers the proper division.


Who’s the statesman? The one not in the herd? The herd has a shepherd that is a different species. If “man” is the herd, then another species, maybe God, is the shepherd.



263D


Crane, wtf?

When you divide a part, you are expressing dignity? You are as arbitrary, YSocrates, in doing that with human beings as a crane that did it with its own species.


By going so fast, you slow us down. Two measures. One is mathematical measure vs. failing to understand the measure of the mean. The measure of the mean is “how much we understand” – which is the crucial thing.



Second sailing, when the winds don’t blow, you have to get the oars out. It is second best and more laborious than you initially expected. It is a disillusionment, where you don’t get the ideal (wind), but you have to take another way.

Philosophy seems to begin in error. We may start with too idealist a starting point, and learn that it isn’t so easy and simple. Thinking is about seeing where the ideal takes you to a mistake, and correcting it.



Divine Shepherd, the king and the god, is a familiar image.


The Myth is about God ruling the universe, and withdrawing, and then coming back again? Why, when, and how?


What is the grazing metaphor? How is it applied to the legislator and the law? The herd is under law.



Why did they begin with science? Why would we ask if Statesman has scientific knowledge?



The herd: homogenous, leveling, under a herder of a different species. Is political life like that? Does the idea of a king match this?



Andreios – Manliness, courage. Root is “man.” Plato is up to an elaborate linguistic play. YSocrates assumption, that anthropos should be set apart from beast (the obvious truth that this conversation should be going towards), only came out because of manliness. The separation of man and beast takes a manly character.


A Statesman may be the ruler of a human herd. We are trying to figure out the eidos of human being. What is the human being by understanding the statesman and through rule? What is the final end? Is it the eidos of human or Statesman? It isn’t clear which is most important.


We get a glimpse of the human eidos through the psychology of YSocrates.



264A


The moment we take for granted humans are tame, we are then hunting (hunt’s root word is beast).



Horns is an image for weapons, aggressiveness. The emphasis on “by nature” we are hornless, you have some kind of insight into your politics and weapons. Rationality gives us weapons like no other kind of animal has. We have horns unlike other animals, but they aren’t by nature?




Split hooves. Split is arbitrary. We divide amongst ourselves politically in a way that is not natural.


Horses + Asses = Mules

Gods + Humans = Diamonion (Socrates is half divine)


Eros, wanting to be the perfection of itself. Asses wants to be a Horse. It is the erotic impulse of the platonic eidos. What the stranger has done is eliminate that from his divisions.



Political Science = The grazing science of non-mixing becoming.



King is a specific kind of herdsman. Other herdsman are a jack of all trades. This is similar to the city, which has a division of arts/labor. The king has a specific king of labor or art. Humans in the city seem reduced to a specialization. Primitive humans outside of cities have to be a jack-of-all trades, as they can’t turn to specialists for each kind of need.


Also, once you have division of labor, everyone knows something (specific). The problem is that once you know something, you may be tempted to think you know more than you actually do, knowing more than just your specific area, but also about everything else.


If everyone is contributing something in particular, and everyone has knowledge of some thing, then why should the king rule? What makes his knowledge so special? Expertise and knowledge lead to a kind of manliness and courage in this sense.


Politike and Philosophy seem to sit above and understand the nature of all the other domains and the limits of those domains. Politike and Philosophy don’t know anything in particular, but they have a meta-level knowledge that puts things in their place. They have an architectonic role.


We don’t have a cowherd that does everything for the herd. The herd themselves are trained to do the various specific tasks necessary for the herd.



265c


How do we separate the king/statesman from the rest of those who might claim to take care of the herd?


Politike (acc. to Aristotle) is knowing when to use which art in which circumstance. The problem with that is that the political ruler has an end in mind for the city, even if he is just and noble, etc. The question it raises, are you distorting the ends of the arts for the good of the city? Everything is used as a means to an end. Me: What’s the problem with this? I don’t understand.


What is wrong with the architectonic science?



There is the ‘argument’ and the ‘action of the argument’ (the deeds of the interlocutors). In this case, it seems like they are trying to figure something out, contemplating, performing the deed of philosophy. It is ironic or interesting because that is the point of the argument, the content of it, which is about how the politician/statesman is an apparition of the philosopher.


Happiness is strongly linked to doing philosophy. In the myth, we are concerned with when humans are the happiest (in which cycle and in what cases, etc.). Why does it only show up only here in the Statesman, and what does it say for the importance of the myth?


How does politics look to a mathematician?


Why is that the concept of the voluntary/compulsory (freedom) come up so late in this dialogue? Why did the stranger keep it out so late? It is obviously such an important concept in politics that it is almost absurd.



A genetic account of the cosmos and who we are as humans requires a beginning. Which cycle is the beginning, the divine or the human rule? If it doesn’t have a beginning, then it isn’t really a genetic account in some ways.


Nature has an entropic harshness about it. The ancient nature may be a starting point, perhaps. If that is the case, then the divine account seems to be the secondary cycle.


My opinion: it seems as though humans, in terms of techne and political life, degenerate in the age of Chronos, but in the age of Zeus (harsh, ancient nature), humans, by necessity (in order to survive), seem to generate in some sense, they must take on techne and political life.


My opinion: It seems as though coming to understand political science is a good and necessary thing in the harsh age of our ancient nature. Acquiring the political techne isn’t easy. It seems like this is mirrored in the long-winded and chaotic method in which the interlocutor attempts to flesh out the nature of the statesman.



Part of the ‘political’ path to eventually philosophy is the separation of man from beast. In teasing out the form of the human being, and understanding the nature of man, we are better able to define the statesman and why the statesman is an apparition of the philosopher.



There are many co-nurturers (bankers, artists, etc.), and so the interlocutors change the name from “herd-nurterer” to “ .” The statesman has a lot of competition for the title of nurturer, as there are so many who would claim to be such.


The Atreus and Thyestes myth is about a competition for who should be king. Hermes bestows a golden fleece on one of the sheep to show that the gods had deemed one man to be the king. This analogy seems perfect for the herd-nurturer and the competition problem. However, the interlocutor throws that out, and he is most interested in how Zeus’ reverses the course of the son to point out Atreus as the legitimate king. Why does the interlocutor drop the seemingly perfect analogy, and instead aims for the cosmos reversal analogy.



Art vs. Nature – YSocrates is manly in nature, but lacks the art of real Socrates.



The universe is an animal with prudence. The universe, somehow, lacks phronesis in the story though, as it is so mechanistic and it reverses and entropies* by necessity.


Is the myth telling us about the ultimate nature or ground of things? Is there divine providence, chaos, etc.?



Why imagine life growing backwards?



Age of Chronos – the Paradise


No work. Lots of grazing (same root of ‘law’ interestingly – nomos). No techne. The animals are herded into their own flocks. Animals are tame, not wild. No animal is food for one another. Vegetarianism, and biblical Eden thought in here. There is no war or faction. No birth. No sexual reproduction. Maybe no “eros.” No regimes, families, or political structures. There is just the whole of the herd under God. No homes, privacy, or clothing. No cold, not weather problems, no protection needed. There is no shame either.


Human life. God raised the humans. God is the divine shepherd. The shepherd has a nature which is different what the nature of that which he herds. Humans to sheep vs. God to humans. How do you rule like a shepherd? You have to have a more divine nature.


My opinion: you need to be superior. Do you need to have a different nature though?


Humans seem to be not special. They are just like other herds.



Zeus seems like a fiction. How can Zeus be ruling if this is an age with no gods ruling?



Are the people in the paradise of Chronos happier? Are they doing philosophy? They have the time and leisure to pursue philosophy, but do they actually do philosophy? What would that kind of philosophy be? (Idle curiosity? Surely that seems to arbitrary)


Did Adam and Eve do philosophy? They probably didn’t see the need it.


Associating with beasts to acquire the various parts of phronesis seems odd.


What does it mean for a beast to have phronesis? Is the gathering of phronesis part of doing philosophy or leading up to doing philosophy?


My opinion: in the era of Chronos, humans are special and different enough from beasts, and they have no real need to do philosophy since they are so ‘satisfied’ like Adam and Eve. It seems like they don’t do philosophy, and if that is the case, they aren’t really satisfied, right? I then wonder if the other era isn’t really the most era as that is the era of real humans doing the real work of humans – techne and philosophy especially.


My opinion: is political science a necessary aspect of doing philosophy? If it is, then it seems as though, by definition, the a-political humans of Chronos are not doing philosophy.


Without Eros, can you do philosophy? If you can’t have being-into-death, can you do philosophy? If you don’t have art, can you really be doing philosophy (which reflects upon the nature and limits of art and knowledge)? If you don’t have a political life, can you really be doing philosophy?


My opinion: if you already have eudaimonia, why do philosophy? Philosophy is a means to eudaimonia as an end, or is philosophy an end in itself? The arts seem to be a means to an end, to surviving and to eudaimonia.


Is philosophy available? Is it necessary to do? It seems as if they have eudaimonia without doing philosophy. Is that just the point of it: it is a staged and impractical kind of eudaimonia, where we cease to be humans and political animals.


Are the chronos-humans actually happy? Do they merely have everything else necessary for happiness except doing philosophy (assuming they aren’t doing philosophy)? Perhaps we can say they aren’t really happy, and they aren’t really human.


In some way, I want to say that in chronos era, humans have the kind of happiness of pigs (and beasts in general), they don’t have the happiness of humans. Human happiness is separate, it is dignified and distinct from the mere happiness of beasts. The humans in chronos aren’t really human, and they don’t have real happiness, the happiness which is separate and belonging to the form of human.


Why does Plato call his a myth?



Much is blamed on the ancient nature of the “body” - the primordial condition is disorderly, entropic, and yet, it is that which spurs us to be distinctly human and to become philosophers. Injustice comes from the ancient nature (273).


Now we get to the ‘telos’ of the myth (he says) – in human life as we know, no gods care for us, we don’t have daimons or divine shepherds, nature is harsh and wild, we are insecure, scarcity, labor, hunger, divisions of labor, contentiousness about who should be in control. That is our world. The statesman belongs to that world. The statesman lacks a role in paradise. Are the divine herdsman employing political science or not?



Are the gods in chronos era employing the art of the statesman? No. This is the transition from the mistakes of diaeresis to the myth. The Statesman is not merely a herd nurturer.



The myth is the first step to realizing you were unconsciously working in this paradigm.


But, the other point of the myth is to show that this is the wrong paradigm.


Weaving paradigm is supposed to replace the wrong paradigm.


If that is the case, then what does the ‘divine shepherd’ illuminate for us? It may be wrong, but what about it was right enough that it merited discussion?



Nature is harsh, it doesn’t provide for us, it is dangerous and wild. We don’t live in the Garden of Eden. Human beings are very weak animals in most respects. The divisions are also accurate (though how relevant?) characteristics of humans.


Humans need the arts for these reasons. We must harness nature. Need necessitates the discovery of the arts. We have to take care of ourselves. There is no natural impulse to work together, we only come together by need. Cities are formed by the desire to survive, as cities are best at enabling our survival.



The fitting length is whatever makes us more dialectical (maybe we might loosely call it philosophy).



Why is there so much written? The last section of the myth seemed to be all that was necessary. Why did Plato make us go through all that work to get to the real meat of the problem or claim.


In order to get from king or statesman to philosopher, we may have to go through the bulk of the myth (acc. to Ronna).



YSocrates was praised for being indifferent to a name. That indifference seemed to show a lack of reflection. Oddly, the stranger praised YSocrates to do it, and only after living with it and thinking about it could it be corrected. Finally, we see “grooming” as being the correct term (for now). We don’t seem to figure out what happens with this grooming.


When we get to the weaving paradigm, we see the producing something and the taking care of something. It seems understandable that the statesman is taking care of something (such as the city), but it isn’t clear what he is making.



The introduction of reading is trying to do things:


    Get at the statesman

    Get at how we ever learn anything



You know you are ignorant when you wake up.


Stoicheoin – element or letter


You don’t have any understanding of ‘a’ until you can see its applications in various different words. Just evaluating ‘cat’ does not tell you enough about ‘a’ – you need to see ‘a’ used in multiple words to realize what it is doing.


If you have to start somewhere with a correct opinion (not knowledge) (how ‘a’ works in ‘cat’ to start working to ‘category’ etc.).


Oddly, we seem to start with a bad opinion in the overall scheme of this story, and try to work it towards the correct opinion.



We need a paradigm that gets us into the city of arts. Weaving gets us there. Weaving turns to be a nice whole, where a lot of arts have to be used to get usthere. This is different from the divine shepherd, who is too self-sufficient and does it all himself.



Make a cloak and caring for the cloak is difficult.


What does the statesman make? He seems to make a city (to me).


Statesman crafts or acquires something to ward off suffering.


“Bound together themselves by themselves”



A trick to esoteric writing – when things are repeated with slight variations, it isn’t really the same thing being repeated, but rather the variations are clues to what is really important.



280A


Weaving : Cloak-making :: Kingship : Statesmanship :: Royal-Art : Political Art


In what way is weaving the largest part of cloak-making? A cloak is not the only thing you can weave. Weaving, in some sense, seems larger than cloak-making. Cloaks are just one of many products of weaving.


The applications of letters to make words is a kind of weaving. Weaving is a ‘step’ (maybe not a part) of grammar and reading then, it seems.


Weaving is an activity – it can be applied to the making of other products

Cloaks are a product, and cloak-making has a very particular end product. Weaving in the strict sense seems to be just about two threads coming together in a certain way. But, weaving broadly seems to include various practices and arts in order to actually accomplish the larger, broader goal of weaving.


Care seems to include cleaning the cloak, and repairing it when it unravels.



Cloaks are one product of weaving.


To me, writing (like weaving) is a part of many activities (just as weaving is a part of making cloaks).


From my perspective: the only difference between Kingship and Statesmanship is that the King is simply a kind of Statesman, a statesman that is recognized as a statesman and treated as such. It is the public recognition that makes him a certain kind of Statesman. This makes sense of what the Stranger has about Statesmanship being a science, and that one who has the knowledge, even if he isn’t actually performing, is a statesman.



At 280A, it seems like we go backwards. Why does he start with 6 here? Why is that the endpoint?



The paradigm of weaving (see the handout)


(2) Divine – this seems to be against the gods, another atheist point. We can’t rely upon the gods (and they aren’t even there) – that kind of thinking.


(3) Political life seems like war, but why are weapons eliminated?


(4) Screens seem to be about shame. It seems to separate the private and public spheres. That seems highly political. Protection against storms seems to be a kind of protection against nature itself and chaos that causes suffering.



Caring for cloaks vs. Making cloaks.



Same and Other … vs … whole and part


Me: (Paradigm)…vs…(Diaeresis)


Only do you know that for the sake of which you do an activity can you have the conceptual “whole and part” framework. Weaving needs an end (for the sake of which).


Is something fitting? Well, you need to know what it is for. Only by knowing for the sake of which can we know if it is fitting.


We need to locate weaving in a whole of parts. We have weaving, different from its congeners. Weaving is a kind of web.


Plato never does anything accidentally. (lulz)


Weaving could not do its thing without a whole lot of co-workers (which would dispute with weaving). There are some things which are necessary for weaving. We can’t call the ‘carder’ a weaver, but is a necessary part of weaving. Weaving wouldn’t occur with a carder doing his part of the process, being a part of that division of labor.


The divine shepherd can do everything for his flock; however, there is disputation in the city, and the statesman/king cannot do everything for the city. The consistuents or parts of the city are necessary for the whole of the city. This isn’t true for the flock, it seems. In the flock, every sheep is roughly the same, but in the city, people are different and makeup important parts of the city, necessary for the city. Those people who are necessary to the city may be performing a lowly job, so they aren’t to be called a statesman (this is my thought) just as the carder is not to be called weaver.



Remember the correction of the myth. It isn’t the feeding of the herd, we need something closer to ‘care’ of the herd. But, on that view, politike seems to be foreshadowed as a kind of care. But, when we get to paradigm of the cloak, it seems as the “cleaning” and “care” for the cloak should parallel to politike. There is a kind of unraveling of the cloak, and wouldn’t that parallel the unraveling of a city in some ways; and so shouldn’t we see the statesman as needing to not only make a cloak, but also care for the City/Cloak. Why doesn’t he let him answer this question?


Weaving is like kingship, it is the most important part of cloak making, but it isn’t all there is. Weaving is part of the making.



There is a strict (precise) sense of the term Weaving, and the loose/broad (comprehensive) sense of Weaving. There is weaving in the precise sense, a part of an elaborate whole. The precise sense of weaving is just the interplating of warf and woof? There is also a comprehensive sense of weaving, however. In some sense, if a part (like weaving) is the most important part of a larger process, that part may get to name the larger process, hence weaving as the most important part comes to name the whole process weaving.



Weaving is the kingly art. Weaving is just an activity, you could do anything with weaving.


The cloak-maker, statesman, is dictating everything else that has to be done, including the weaving.


Cloak = Polis

Cloak-maker = Statesman

Cloak-caretaker = Statesman

Weaving = A part of cloak-making

Weaver = King


Where the fuck is the philosopher? How does this point us toward the philosopher?


Aristotle, Book 2, Ch 2.

Summary: We are looking for the good, the end of human beings, politike appears to be the all-encompassing art. It appears to be the all-encompassing end because it uses everything else. It is the end in itself, not a means to an end, and so on.


There is a hierarchy of a parts of a whole. Is horseback-riding really a subordinate to generalship? I can ride horses to plow a field, for example. Horseback-riding doesn’t seem to belong under generalship.


Look, Politike is about making the other arts (and the artists) subordinate to the whole, forcing those arts to see themselves and serve as parts to the whole (the city).


In the cloak making process, weaving is treated as if it were a subordinate part of making a cloak. In the polis, the kingly art is treated as though it is just a subordinate part of making the polis. We might think that the kingly art isn’t obviously subordinate, it could be used for other ends. But, the statesman is about making kingly art subordinate to the city.


The Kingly Art is Philosophy (acc. to Ronna). The art of weaving is philosophy. Weaving, like philosophy, can be put to use towards other ends. In this case, it seems that statesman uses weaving/kinglyart/philosophy towards the end of making/caring for the polis/cloak.


This seems to be strongly linked to Aristotle’s problem of the whole/part, unified good and parts good, and all ofthose problems.



Cosmos = beautiful, ordered whole


Beautifying seems to conceal, that is why it is associated with the Sophist. It covers over the ugly things.



The separating and combining that goes on in this process, not just in weaving, but in everything we think or do…is diacritics and syncritics.



Courage and moderation seem to conflict with each other. People have a nature (not blank slates) that inclines towards one virtue or the other. The stranger draws out lots of political, moral, and psychological problems out of that. How does one weave together the virtues of courage and moderation?



Twisting is the warp. The Courageous warp. The stranger has to tell YSocrates that woof also needs to be twisted. The stranger is telling YSocrates that he is too partial.


283A – This has the major claim for what is the Weaving Art.


We are looking at the synchtraical art. How is kinglyness synonymous with politike?



The stranger has been trying to “moderate” the “courageous” YSocrates. It the stranger weaving us a story here, or is he weaving something for YSocrates, or what do you think?



Sometimes people talk too long (don’t bring up too short either).


Aristotle Chapter 6, book 2 – virtue as a mean.


There is a measure of the mean, what is fitting for a purpose.



There are two kinds of measures: (1) the literal measure, and (2) the measure of the mean


    The Table is 5 feet long

    The table is too short; it doesn’t measure up to the mean.


If you don’t have a measure of the mean, then youwon’t have any arts (acc. to the stranger). Is that true or not?



Measure of the mean? = The fitting, the opportune, the appropriate. These are standards of the good for a thing (and perhaps beautiful). It may be both good and beautiful. There is kind of an aesthetic as well as utilitarian angle to the measure of the mean.


There is numbers and the good. ?wtf? The are two features or categories of knowledge. There is a claim to know something based on numbers, and another way in terms of the good.


Mathematics is precise, but Plato’s aim is to show that there is a notion of the precise that goes beyond the mathematical, and has something to do with the good, and the measure of the mean is the standard for that.


The beautiful when it shows up in the moral is the noble. What is the relationship between the beautiful and the good?


About a perfect work of art, there is nothing extra and nothing missing. Every part is perfect for the whole.


Mathematics is a means to the end (good, and maybe the beautiful).


The measure of the mean is related to becoming?


The techne of mathematics seems demoted among the arts of measurement.


The mathematical measurement is subordinate to the measure of the mean.



What does the statesman do with the measure of the mean?


Is there anything that escapes the measure of the mean?


If the good presides over all beings and knowledge, that means there would be nowhere where you’d have the mathematical mean divorced from the measure of the mean.


Surface: you’ve got two kinds of measurement….there is a category of measurement, but seems as if there is a kind of measures of the category of measurement.


Dividing by forms or kinds (eidetic analysis), when you do this kind of dividing, it looks like there are different kinds, and that you are dividing beings into discreet classes or kinds. “Being” falls into kinds of beings.


Why are there different kinds of virtues for Aristotle? There are all these different emotions, and each one of these emotions falls on a continuum. You can have too much or too little, and in each situation you are trying to show just the right amount. There is a precise itself, but it is relative to each context.



“Weaving is the intertwining of warf and woof.” It takes forever for Plato to get us to there. The warp and woof are courage and moderation. There is the courageous type of character/state, and there is the moderate character/states.


What is the relation between these moral virtues (these kinds of virtue – Plato simplified them to just two) and prudence (practical wisdom, which figures out the mean)?


There is a relation between eidetic measurement (dividing by kinds) and the measurement of the mean. And, this is somehow supposed to be applied to the relationship between morality and prudence.


Weaving : Cloaking-making/caring :: Kingly-art : Political Art


Weaving tells the cards to get rid of this much gunk and oil from the wool. Make the warp like this, etc. There is a lot of mathematical measures. The weaver can’t seem to do that unless he knows what he is making though, that he is making a woolen-cloak. Only in knowing that he is making a cloak can the weaver give the subordinate arts the mathematical measurements necessary to do their arts properly.


You need a hierarchal goal. The weaver seems to be the greatest and most important part. He tells the carder and all the other parts what to do. And they will say, “oh yeah, your cloak wouldn’t happen without us.” Weaving becomes a part of a whole when it becomes subordinate to something else.


The statesman is using the kingly art for his own purposes. He has subordinated the kingly art, just as weaving is subordinating and exploited and used for cloak-making/caring. That might not be the natural role of weaving or the kingly art, the cloakmaker and the statesman just use it for their respective purpose.


The statesman uses the kingly art which has to do with making and caring for the city. The statesman is looking to the city as an end. He practices his art for the sake of the city as a whole. He is using the kingly art for his purpose, and he applies the kingly art in a specific way, a way in which the kingly art doesn’t in and by itself normally serve.


Does weaving have a measure of the mean? Maybe not until it has a product or an end. That the statesman has an end, it gives the kingly art a measure of the mean. But, what is the kingly art in and of itself? Is there something such as weaving in and of itself?



A philosopher doesn’t fit nicely into the division of arts? In one way, the politikos doesn’t fit nicely into the division of arts either because he seems to organize and is above the other arts. He is the architectonic art, as he knows the good for the sake of which the other arts are performed. He is like the cloak-maker that tells everyone else what to do. The philosopher seems ot have some kind of role like that, but he doesn’t fit into the arts of the city either. The philosopher doesn’t really, obviously contribute to the city. The philosopher does have a kind of self-sufficiency that no other art has.


You can’t do philosophy without a city, you won’t have the time. You need a city to provide leasure to do philosophy. Political philosophy is aware of the philosopher’s relation to the city and the philosopher’s dependence on the city. The difference between Socrates and the stranger is interesting here; Socrates is so very dependent on the city, but the stranger doesn’t seem to rely upon the city itself (although he wanders from city to city – he transcends his city). Socrates dies because of his tie to Athens. Which is the natural model for the philosopher? We might be inclined toward the stranger, because the philosopher seems to be a stranger to every city, and yet that doesn’t work for the real Socrates.


If you take the stranger as the model, are you giving up on political philosophy? Socrates is a political philosopher in an obvious way – he gives his life for the city.

My question: Should we all be philosophers? It looks like we can’t be and possibly shouldn’t be, assuming ought implies can, and not can implies not ought.



Politicians are the sophists of sophists. 303C, refers to the end of 291.



Philosopher is the true being of two apparitions, at least at first it appears that way. But, we may be finding out that this isn’t right.


Instead, it seems as tif the Philosophers if the true being of sophist, but then it isn’t clear what the statesman is and how it relates. We can agree that the sophist is the false apparition of the sophist.



287b – What isn’t instrumental? It seems only the ultimate good is not instrumental. IS the whole city instrumental for producing and maintaining philosophers, or are philosophers instrumental for making and caring for the city?


Why is plaything not eliminated?


Aristotle links leisure and playfulness. Philosophy may be playful, and it is certainly what one should do with leisure.



The word eidos comes from the word appearance or looks. It is, in this light, difficult to separate body from soul, as the body is about appearance.



The philosopher in being (the real philosopher) cannot be appear as what he is, but he has two guises: the sophist and the statesman.

Prudence, practical wisdom, is a knowledge, but not a science. It is particularistic. The stranger seems to think in 191-192ish that he didn’t really get the sophist’s definition right in The Sophist.


Philosopher----------sophist

Prudent King---------pretend statesman---greatest sophists


Who is the real statesman?


How is philosopher related to the prudent king?


Sophists aren’t really dangerous. The really dangerous thing is the city. The city can kill the philosopher. The city is a great power.



Arbitrarily, he used the speech about weaving to introduce the digression into the art of measure. He then gets into division of kinds arbitrarily.


Science---------- praktitke

---------- gnostike -------- kntike

-------- epitaktike


Science is replaced by the art of measurement.


The art of measure---------mathematical measure

----------measure of the mean


The measure of the mean, you can never have a knower about action. You can never have a knower of praxis.


The measure eof the mean and the mathematical measure have to cooperate. You can’t build a desk without the measure of the mean, but you can’t implement the measure of the mean without the mathematical measure in the art of constructing tables.


The supposed dichotomy in science has broken down. The dichotomy of theory and practice (praktike and gnostike) have been broken down, somehow.


Episteme has mathematics as the paradigm. Definable. Mathematical, deductive. Universal. This is not supposed to fit phronesis.


Philosophy is not an episteme.


Is there a political science? It would be an episteme, yes? What are the limits of political principles?



The stranger is moving from the metaphysical problem of non-being…


Now that the being of becoming and the problem of non-being are solved, Plato is in a position to really describe the Sophist.



The political art or the kingly art has to do something with making playthings or using playthings or being like playthings. Playthings are the only possessions in the city which Plato doesn’t deny.



The production of all the artifacts of the city are like the production of all the artifacts for weaving – they are merely instrumental.


Such things of the city must be interwoven. They cannot be a mere heap.


The sophist appears in the very large mob (291A). They all claim to be statesmen because they wield some kind of political power. Whom or what is sacrificing whom or what to whom or what? Does it have anything to do with Socrates, who will be ‘sacrificed’ for the city of Athens? For the sake of what?


The stranger is making city into a sacrificial animal??


Some kind of competition that goes deep in the history of civilization, between the sacred (priests and prophets) and the city of arts. The statesman belongs to the city of arts. The king, I don’t know.


For the Egyptians (regarded as ancients by the greeks) merged the sacred and the king.



What or who are the greatest servants?



The priests according to the law or conventional have knowledge. Plato doesn’t really think the priests have that kind of knowledge at all. The lawful give priests a certain status, however.



If all you had was mathematical knowledge, you couldn’t distinguish tyrant and king. The measure of the mean is necessary to break down the Regimes that we see in 291c.



Political philosophy can arise in any regime. A prudent king can happen to come about in any regime??



In what ways is politics not a techne?



Tracking the concept of imitation would be a good topic for the paper. Sophists, laws, etc.



If your one standard is the perfect regime, then voluntary/involuntary people doesn’t matter, whether or not the rich are in charge, or by law or lawless simply don’t matter. The real focus, however, seems to be about law or without law.


What is lawless rule? How is it different from involuntary rule?



Who is the prudent king? (292E??)


Is the doctor a good model for the prudent king?


Making someone better is more than just saving someone. “preserve” (293E)…or should the politician actually improve (not merely preserve)?


Medicine must be precise and individualized. The city is one big body?


The measure of the mean has to be translated into the mathematical measure.


Is the phronemos king just the philosopher?



What is the relationship between political ruler and legislator? It seems as though the perfect politician is both, maybe.



There are two kinds of philosophers: the stranger and Socrates (not a stranger, he belongs to Athens).



“Should we go into Afghanistan?” “Should we tax people at a flat rate?”


Is there one true knower? It seems like this is the virtuous agent’s problem. The phronesis of the virtuous agent doesn’t allow for the episteme, to some extent.



Legislative art belongs to the kingly.



1st critique of the law – 294B


Comprehensive understanding (encircle) vs. Precise understanding (the most perfect case example).


The best law may need to be comprehensive. E.g., people can drive at 16, but it can’t point out particular 12 year olds fit for driving and 25 year olds not fit for driving.


The law can precisely order the most just.


You can’t have the phronemos king, the virtuous agent, always being next to every single person in the city, telling those people how to live their lives. It isn’t practically available, even if that is theoretically what we might want.


Even though it can’t fit the particular, why is law necessary?


Gymnast trainer:


294D, can’t give the fitting, but you can have rough “beginner,” “intermediate,” and “advanced” – the “for the most part” method which profits the bodies in general



295B


Uncodifiability of the Virtuous Agent’s knowledge or perception of morality – Uncodifability of the Phronemos King’s knowledge or perception of Political art


How does divine law work?


It seems as if the statesman is forced to generalize and codify that which is very difficult to generalize and codify.


Why have medical rules become healthy? Why is anything against them sick and artless? Why is virtue to be the same as knowledge?


The law must herd. It just legislate the good, bad, ugly, and beautiful for the herds. Is there anyone with knowledge of this?


There is not techne of the just, beautiful, and the good. There is phronesis of it though.


Can’t rule by force, you violate their freedom. You must persuade. Is force acceptable or not? Consent, freedom, individuality seem to be part of the good, and part of being a citizen, and part of ‘political life’ of eudaimonic existence.




294D-


Defense of Law:

What the place of knowledge in rule? What is the relationship between knowledge and rule? To what extent does having knowledge entitle one to be a ruler? What ist he science of ruling? If there is no science of ruling, then why should think there is an entitlement to rule?


The Noble or the Beautiful can be ideal, but the Good must be real.


Tripod: The beautiful, the just, the good ???


Beauty is aesthetic, and we contemplate it at a distance. “Big is beautiful”

Good with respect to weight would be health. There is a range of the “good weight” the healthy weight, and that is relative to your nature and requirements, but it is objective and real. It is not just a matter of opinion.


There is no noble or beautiful imitation of the application fothe Statesman’s knowledge. An artful imitation is being a statesman.


Why is there an all-knowing vs. imposter polarity. Why isn’t there a spectrum, where there is merely ‘pretty good’?


3 answers:

    If you’ve got something better for the city, then submit it to the city, convince people of it.

    The danger of an individual going against the law is much worse a danger than letting the laws dominate.



Ruled by One, few, or many. “Law” bisects them all. (Lawful or Lawless)


The city is the sophist of all sophist??. It isn’t driven by truth or knowledge, and the rulers have a pretense or claim to knowledge, and when they do, they are the sophists of all sophists.


The statesman action is an appeal to the advantageous. The Just and advantageous might not peel apart completely though.



Coefficients and congeners (kindred spirits) are arts or activities that are somehow doing the same thing or claiming to do the same thing as what your are trying to pin down. You have to separate the kindred spirits to isolate the thing you are looking for.


Weaving is an activity has other activities that are kindred spirits, such as felting, glueing, sewing. We have separate them off from weaving to get at what weaving really is about.


Politike is using the activity of weaving for the sake of the city.


You don’t’ have workers or coefficients unless you are taking your ???


Weaving vs. Weaving the Woolen Cloak?


Making a woolen cloak, now weaving can say, I want wool, get me a shepherd; carder, clean that wool to such and such a degree of refinement; woof maker, make me a solid vertical thread; warf maker, make me a fine thread; uhoh-the cloak tearing, repairman, repairmanmanmanmanmana.


Rhetoric (media), military, and law must be separated (as kindred arts) from the statesman. These are arts, yeah?


The statesman has to use these things to do his job. Why are they kindred?



Aristotle Chapter 2.



The tyrant goes against the law, driven by the law and ignorance (knowledge of ignorance).


The judge needs moral virtue. No matter how much knowledge you have of the law, you are vulnerable to be waylaid by bridges, fear, pity.


Judge has knowledge of justice, but he also needs virtue to apply that knowledge appropriately.

-


Kingly is manly.


What is the relation of part to species?


The mean is the result or recognition of phronesis. Opportune or timely (the mean) for what? For the Noble, right?


Disease (Stasis)



Hostile ideas of courage and moderation themselves, in which each one sees the other as the blameworthy thing.


We have a community which is divided into these categories, as they are bound to one extreme or the other.




The cloak is the virtuous ruling class that covers the city. It isn’t clear where the weaving comes into play, acc. to Ronna.



What is the relationship between Statesman and King? Neither one seems to be wrapped up in this web or cloak.


Is this really all political? The cloak, the one encompassed by it, the moderate and manly woven together, and the prudence?? This is perhaps not the right model for the political sphere at all.
