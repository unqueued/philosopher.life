* You probably need paint. That door is looking good.
* Bug the hospital and IRS.
* Keep applying. Hey, you got an interview for a job you actually want. Maybe you'll get lucky again?
* Make sure you are listening carefully to your brother.
* Linguine or breakfast sound good. You need to go shopping for veggies soon. 
** Perhaps hold out for Saturday so your lovely wife's senses can pick out the magic watermelons.
