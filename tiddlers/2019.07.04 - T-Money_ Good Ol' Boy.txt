How's it going? You guys cookin' out and doing fireworks tonight?
THU 7:23 PM
We are! It is going well. My first cousin and her family are in from out of town. We have a house full of kiddos! She has 3! Did some fireworks last night. Will do a few tonight and tomorrow night.
THU 7:37 PM
Noice.  I hope the kiddos are having a blast.
THU 7:37 PM
I'm gonna bet your swings have been getting some good use today.
THU 7:37 PM
I like bottle rockets and the cheap stuff. Not a big spender on fireworks. How are you guys?

Yeah, we don't really do fireworks, but we can see them from the house decently enough.
THU 7:38 PM
Kathy dyed their hair for church camp. Samantha is going to GA to go to the same church camp I went to as a kiddo.
THU 7:38 PM
That is neat.
THU 7:38 PM
Probably the only kids their age who get to have their hair dyed.
THU 7:39 PM
Awesome to have a mom who is a professional.
THU 7:39 PM
Yeah. They are full of attitude and confidence. Lol
THU 7:39 PM
Dye only lasts about 3 Weekes.
THU 7:39 PM
Hair dye
THU 7:39 PM
We're doing well enough. Been working on our wikis and the house for the most part. Watching the end of Breaking Bad and eating fries+burgers.
THU 7:40 PM
3 weeks makes sense to me.
THU 7:40 PM
I assume you wouldn't want to go permanent unless you were really sure.
THU 7:40 PM
Takes so long to grow hair out.
THU 7:40 PM
and touching it up is a pain
THU 7:40 PM
Nah. It's not permanent. I made that very clear when Samantha and Kathy asked. I don't want my daughter to have dyed hair. Not permant stuff.
THU 7:41 PM
Kathy let's all her grey grow out. We are very earthy and just real folks round here.
THU 7:42 PM
We are greying too. So "distinguished," lol.
THU 7:43 PM
I loved breaking bad. Very good show. I was the only one that watched it.
THU 7:43 PM
And we did tacos. Pizza last night. And chicken wings tonight.
THU 7:43 PM
Sounds like a party.

Happy Traitor's Day

His father was in the air forced for 10 years too as a pilot. The murderous bastard. =)
THU 7:49 PM
I like the kid.,
THU 7:52 PM
The pilot is immoral. You are correct.
THU 7:52 PM
=). I love the whole family. They are my family. And I get along better with my first cousins than I do my siblings.
THU 7:56 PM
This was their first trip to KY! I was so excited! Abby, my cousin with 3 kids. Is one of the few othe people. Who know what a ring swing is!
THU 7:57 PM
They girls haven't swung much. The golf cart has been the main attraction.

THU 7:59 PM
