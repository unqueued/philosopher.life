title: 2018.12.14 - Afterschool Teaching: On My Own

I showed up early. I filled out paperwork and made snacks for the kids. I talked with Matt about my opposition to censoring books, especially for profanity, mature content, etc. I circled and listened to the kids until the adults figured out what they wanted to do. I spent a lot of time listening (I'm not sure what else to do yet). I have seen the lives of these children before, and I must see it again.

These kids all come from broken homes. I had one student who asked me if I would be her stepdad.

I took the kids who wanted to go to the computer lab. Matt initially chose what everyone would do by vote.

Clearly, some kids want to view pictures of celebrities. I encouraged them to be productive. The school appears quite strict about it, which I predict.

It's sad to see that we are expected to be g-rated and not even openly consider the mature parts of reality with them. The kids themselves live in this bifurcated world. They talk about absurdly adult issues with each other, so much pain! Why must I act like this isn't happening to them? Why am I supposed to silence them?

One of the girls was telling me about her mom's meth OD. But, a book or website with a swear word is a no-no. FUCK THAT SHIT!

They joke about sexual Daddy's and discuss non-trivial political and religious topics. As long as they are kind to each other, I think it's a good thing they talk.

They live in the real world, and I am opposed to not openly recognizing that fact. I'm supposed to force them into these insane slots (and I'm all about that usually).

Middle school is weird, ofc.

I had to call the office to have them get Matt to call me. I need to get their numbers.

Breitbart and Foxnews are the recommended news sources in the computer lab (written on the wall).

None of these kids have a computer at home. This is literally the only chance they have to hyperread and play.

To think how many hours I had to spend (however inefficiently) to use my monsters as I can now, how are they ever going to have a chance at becoming fully functioning citizens?

They all have a phone, though some use theirs as a tablet.

I actually want to enforce using the computer in the computer lab while they have the chance.

The boys all went to play board games. The older girls prefer talking in the lab. The quiet kids like it here too.

One girl is practicing typing and reading a book; rock on.

Snapchat and games.

Again, glorified babysitter.

Also, I need some math activities, and I need to come up with what I'm teaching for social studies and science. I think we'll stick to economics, computer science, and philosophy. I'd like to speak about kernels of ideas since I have so little time.
