title: 2019.07.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Go, Go, Go!

* Woke at 10
** Not too groggy. Dreams were strong feelings.
* Offspring were already working. 
** Uh, is hell freezing over? Lol.
** So far, I think I'm liking the switch to half'n'half on //Life of Fred// and Khan again, though only my son completed it.
* Read+Write
* My daughter asked questions, and as usual, we spiral into rabbitholes and dialectures.
** <3
* Read+Write
* More dialectures
** Discussed Arch (fun to see my daughter search her wiki to realize this is not our first attempt with her), hashing uses, salts, Shor's algo, and more.
* Daughter and I tangoed. She is hiding not trying, yet again for the billionth time (I was worse at her age). 
* Both children built things today, and they drew good lines for knowing when to ask me questions.
** I'm excited to build m16 with them. I like that we have failed in many things and continue trying. I hope they pick up on the value of that perseverance.
* Read+Write
* Walked with my wife.
** She has an interview with Yale on my birthday! =) She deserves it. 
*** Also, plans for Informing have been made. I love plans and execution.
* Roast took longer than expected, but it was amazing. 
** Offspring did a great job with me.
* We finished //BB//! 
* Reading
* Nap, I was exhausted.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 3
