** It's been fun.
*[[Notage Ti.5]]
** I appreciate how consistently you aim to take notes. Thank you.

** I hope one of the gifts you will have is a strong understanding of what's wrong with your parents too. It's mighty high praise to say we are gift. You don't and won't always feel that way. I hope your parents are the weakest of the gifts you receive.
** I prize your imagination too. It's a real skill and a place to protect to some extent.
*[[2020.03.04 – h0p3ful Review: Lots To Think About]]
** These are a good source of dialectures for us.
*[[2020.03.04 – Wiki Review: Quick, write!]]
** I think your responses are too short and lack content. This feels like you mailed it in. Some days are going to be like that, but your goal is to be more thoughtful. It's a start. 
*** "Past" from your [[X-Section]] yesterday is the wrong direction. 
**** Note that I use "Ditto"

** What is "original religion?"
** What is "it"?
** You've got a line of reasoning here, but it's hard to follow. We don't know what you are pointing at.
** You've got a pile right here which needs to be clarified. Thank you for making the pile. That is the first step.
*** I think your [[Review]] of this should cause you to clarify and flesh out your argument further, but this is a topic which can't be discussed in a single day well enough.
*** When you come back to this in your [[X-Section]], I hope you will pause and attempt to say it more clearly. With distance, it can be easier to revise.

** I'm excited for you to try diving back into programming some day. I think it's going to be beautiful for you.
