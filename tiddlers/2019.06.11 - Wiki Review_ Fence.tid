title: 2019.06.11 - Wiki Review: Fence

* [[2019.06.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Simple]]
** Completed. It was a simple day, but it was a good one. I'm glad when I get to speak with so many people I care about.

** We tried making chili, but it didn't smell or taste right (we know our recipe). One of the products was off by a mile, and we felt it better to be safe than sorry.
** You know, that letter still has more work than I anticipated. 
*** It's okay that it's taking you months to write a 50-page letter.

** I wish I could see everyone's version of this log. It immediately tells me so much. Committing here ain't easy.

** Oh, this turned out to be hilarious. I regret that I have not saved so many maymays over the years. I realize many people would cringe to save such things, but a good folder of content is necessary. Some store reaction gifs, but I'll just keep the text.

** I think I was useful to my brother. And, I'm super glad it was more of a blip for him (and quite understandably!).

** Edited. Maybe I can tell a difference. It feels crisper to me. Maybe I'm imagining that. I'll take it!
