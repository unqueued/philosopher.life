!! Audit:

* I want to reiterate (again) how my wife was correct about the formatting. I hope she will have more good ideas.
* This was my first complete month of keeping Link Logs. It was a worthy adventure.
* I learned to hold onto tabs in my browser and sit on them for a while. There was less pressure, and I kept what I really wanted to keep.
* I'm glad I try to have something to say, however small and useless, about each link. I often know what I've read or seen is valuable, but can't express why, how, or in what ways.
* I love the links I chose. Lol.
* I started out nicer and got nastier (justifiably, I'd argue). 
* I suppose my [[Link Log]] is a place to store memories. A place to think about what I've been reading about. Let us hope it will be useful.
