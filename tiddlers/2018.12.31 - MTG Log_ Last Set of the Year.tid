Daughter:

Kept mountain, 2 port, waste, lackey, kiki, trash. I'm all in on t1 lackey on the play, lol. Fuck it. She drops vial! I connect->trash (no explodezors). Port on upkeep, she drops mountain and vial. I swing, lackey->kiki, kiki->trash, sac clone to take highest vial down. Upkeep port, pass. I kiki->trash, swing, lackey->krenko, sac trash to trash against her remaining vial. Upkeep double port, gg.

Watched my daughter and [[JRE]] play several games. I jumped up and down watching. It was excellent.

Son:

On the play, so I keep: mountain, waste, crater, chief, chieftain, trash, crafter. I cannot say I am the best at mulliganing. This has a t1 lackey answer which is not resistant to inc. He mirrors. I drop vial, waste. He MWMs. I waste his waste, crater. No echo, obv, caverns, lackey. I chief. He chiefs (we all chiefs). I vial chieftain, crafter out crater, shoot his chief, pass (eh, inc). He leader->(Chieftain, inc, matron). I drop trash, waste his caverns, swing with all but crafter unblocked. He incs my crafter, I shoot lackey (maybe to his face?). I swing with all, he blocks to kill chieftain and loses his board in defense. GG.
