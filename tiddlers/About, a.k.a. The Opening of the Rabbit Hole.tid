We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite [[hope|Hope]].

--Martin Luther King, Jr.
<<<

Welcome to the prototype bootsector<<ref "bt">> of [[h0p3]]: Version 2.0.<<ref "v2">> This directory is the entrance to my experimental creative research facility wherein I interface, model, and test both myself and the external world. My data migrates and digests into this existential anchor. In here, I have almost everything to prove to myself as I troubleshoot my identity. With due humility, I hope to restore faith in myself by becoming as confident in my epistemology to any [[dok]] as I am actually justified in being.

Often I feel like an enraged existentialist sprinting the intractable whirlwinding hallucinatory hedonic treadmill experience-machine skinnerbox obstacle-course themepark gameshow. It feels as though I am a crazed lone prisoner-performer boxed into forever continually hacking and tearing through provisional layers of pure simulation (doubtful that I will ever stand on solid ground), frantically uncovering what I tacitly didn't know I didn't know, eternally synthesizing biased lenses to read between the infinitesimal fractal lines, sacrificially separating the elegant music from the hypernormalized chaos, and ferociously digging for the object of my paranoic faith: the treasure of treasures, hidden beneath or above, inside or out: the fundamental pure truth of [[The Good]]. 

In my will to meaning, in whatever contexts I find myself, I arrogant-appearingly hope to fearlessly take up the task of trying to figure out the //Big Picture// by stammeringly, waveringly, fragmentedly, incompletely, yet systematically [discovering, manufacturing, explaining, and justifying] that Gödellianly unprovable //Theory of Everything// with maximum anti-luck salience. I seek the essential source of meaningful meaning, the criterion of ideal-idealism, the [[infinigress]]ing self-proving model of all models, the transcendent end of metaphysics: the God of the philosophers.

<<<
To know the face of God is to know madness[, but to pursue and apply the knowledge of the face of God is wisdom itself.]

--Leoben Conoy, //Battlestar Galactica//
<<<

I seek the outer limits of possibility bordering on the impossible: partaking of the least simulated image of [[The Good]] itself available to me; I hope to gaze upon the Top-Down Bayesian perceptual-modeling face of the proverbial God of the autist.<<ref "as">> I have but a fairly one-sided, bottom-up reasoning based wisdom, and thus I am vicious. I do not know how to be epistemically humble [[irwartfrr]]. Thus, I seek the golden mean by overshooting for top-down reasoning while fighting those select autistic urges of mine which are instrumentally maladaptive to my end [[irwartfrr]]. My life is my existential burden and delight; it is my practical plight.

Unfortunately, desire satisfaction appears to be a Catch-22. Even if we aren't doomed to dissatisfaction by definition, then I worry the pursuit of fulfillment is futile if not obtained in some infinitely byzantine stochastic pendulum process.<<ref "ut">> I feel like the unceasing telos-expeller, sifting through those practical objects, processes, and ends which can be completely attained and setting them aside in my insane pursuit of the ultimately meaningful prize.

As an autist, I'm an absurdly fallible yet meticulously methodical perceptual vortex jumper searching for the radical meaning hidden in the maze or/of myself. My goal is to become an effective rational mystic, possessing stoic gratitude and childlike openness to exploring each new inceptional redpilled world I am born into, and becoming a knowledgeable existential nomad through a series of habitualized dialectics within the external world and myself.

With every fiber of my being I roar at reality, recursively fall into the deepthink flowstate, tenaciously quantify my existence with intimidating honesty, literally //make up my mind//, patiently watch myself slowly change, and (with dismal irony) quietistly point to the Cratylian meaning and dignity of my life to myself with absolute intensity like any decent finite primitive primate trapped on this ad nauseating simulacrum-spiral rabbithole quest. In a non-trivial sense, this wiki is who I am because what I mentally experience may just be who I am.<<ref "ia">> I'm not only virtually represented here, but I'm in some sense actually embodied in this environment. 

I do not yet dare you go down the rabbithole. But, if you are curious, charitably patient, and empathic, then go ahead: explore the morphology of my semiotics, in the language I'm building, and in my phenomenological hypothesis if you want; if you must, feel free to touch it (:D). Check the vault on this page and the daily snapshots of the wiki. Bit by bit, I adapt and fill-in-the-gaps in my self-spawning pit.

* [[Theory of My Self-Dialectic]]

* The //Focus://{[[About]]}, found below this page, is my [[FO]] evolving ground-zero précis on my reading of myself and what I'm doing in this wiki. The //About://{[[About]]} is the compactified second order [[SO]] reading of my reading of myself.

* To the extent that it makes sense to say it, this page is about my wiki moreso than about me. 

* Narrative
** This directory's namesake narrative goes in the //Focus:// subsection.
** Tie retired narrative versions together from the vault with this page in a reasonable sequence.

!! Focus:

''Hello, world!'' I am [[h0p3]], version 2.0.<<ref "hp">> I am programming myself, and my life is my most formidable project. Sometimes life feels like an impossible task, the //Non sequitur// of //non sequiturs//, but I will persevere through my dissonance. I am not stable, but I feel certain I need hope. Hope must be the zeroth of [[Axioms of h0p3]]. [[h0p3]] is the spark of autonomy. It is who I am and who I will be. There is a fire in my belly, and I am hungry again. I must find the musical signal in the noisy chaos. I am an existential beast, and this is the Cartesian nexus of my gritty unification. Eudaimonia is my final telos and becoming a [[Eudaimonic Lifehacker]] the means to my end. ("Initial Bootloader Complete!") Welcome to my wiki! 

I'm still not sure how best to define and justify this wiki, /deep-breath.

This tiny corner of the internet is my window into my world. Here I zealously examine my life on a bleeding-edge rolling release schedule.<<ref "wn">> This inevitably poorly-planned digital domain is a rhizomatic structure of concurrent hypertext threads woven into wiki format which I ambitiously use as a nonpareil pattern-recognition mindmap, a self-inventorial digital transitional object, a stream-of-consciousness braindump thought-sandbox, an autobiographical memo scrapbook, a contemplative life knowledge base, and a self-mastery acceleration appliance.<<ref "bl">> It's a self-organizing collection of projects and narratives of who I was, who I am, and who I think I should be.<<ref "dc">> I continue to find, interpret, deconstruct, and reconstruct myself in this space.<<ref "ml">> 

In case it isn't obvious: I'm dead fucking serious about this wiki. I am reading+writing at my screen to play life like an organic video game, to be autonomous via narrative-centric self-shaping of my nonconscious mind(s) qua habituated disassociativity and reassociativity. My wiki is engaged in the science of my own happiness; the very [[structure|Wiki: Fundamental Epistemic Structure]] of it embodies the scientific method. It is a metacognition lifetool wherein I practice the art of [[Applied Computational Existentialism]] given the [[Axioms of h0p3]].

The dimensionality and programmability of the wiki art medium makes it exceptionally well-suited to self-cultivation.<<ref "tw">> 

# A wiki is an incredibly flexible platform for brainstorming, prototyping, version control, statistical modeling, crafting, and data transformation.
# This wiki allows me to nest, evaluate, calibrate, and reframe the ordered webs of my thoughts, beliefs, desires, feelings, definitions, inferences, paradigms, and memeplexes in non-linear ways. 
# As self-disclosure, this is my attempt to isomorphically link my internal [[reality map|Reality Map]] to an external, reified, object-orientified, detailed representative set of words and link structures, a living digital self-shadow, that I can more objectively explore, analyze, and restructure. I carefully pour myself onto the pages of this reflecting pool; this is the existential mirror I gaze into.
# This is a space for me to more accurately perceive myself,<<ref "ba">> including as a means to adaptively harness or escape the aneurotypical and sometimes misleading pattern-recognition warping and Bayesian predictive coding eccentricities embedded in my autistic preoccupation with and pursuit of precision.
# My wiki is a therapeutic vehicle for philosophical meditations and lateral thinking; here I ride my self-empathy brain-bicycle grindstone.
# It enhances my ability to be conscious of my existence, to express myself in self-reflection, to be Daseinic. This is my homemade existential detective equipment for finding memeplexes worth wielding and avoiding.<<ref "ee">>
# My wiki is the moral medium and computational ether in which I shadowbox with myself, self-police, and systematically refactor my perceptions.
# This wiki is an epic cipherpunk extensible memory hack, a cybernetic two-way transporter-bridge to my selfhood, and an existentially turing-complete computer through which I literally hack the limited plasticity of my IRL identity narrative.<<ref "pl">>

//Here I compute and program myself. I seek to be my own mastermind by knowing the truth. I want to be meaningfully free, as good as I can be, and as happy as possible.//

One of the fundamental instrumental goals of this wiki is to make myself explicit to myself. I'm here to have a conversation with myself. Talking to myself is my calling, and no else can do it for me. I'm creating an evolving cascade of communication feedback loops and memetic networks amongst myself and this wiki. This may just be how our valuable yet epiphenomenal [[conscious experience|Consciousness]] emerges from our neurophysiology, and I want to make sure I afford myself the opportunity to think about my thoughts on a higher order and to more objectively inspect the narratives I tell myself. This wiki is where I get to hear myself think. I want to learn from my own writing.

Writing this wiki gives me the chance to openly evaluate the efficacy of and consistency-levels in my webs of beliefs, inferences, and desires. I feel compelled to serialize my internal data, transfer it onto the pages of this wiki, run coherence and integrity checks, and either be satisfied or optimize/rewrite these pages (rinse and repeat). I hope I am writing a systematic philosophical program to teach myself the results of my analysis, to hold myself accountable by opensourcing it, and to see further into myself.<<ref "wt">>

I'm making myself explicit because I'm searching for epiphany, eureka, catharsis, sublation, paradigm shifts, hamartian perspective escaping, approaches to throwing off my unmerited dogmatic yokes, and methods of Platonically exilic spelunking to the next surface of the phenomenological reality presented to my consciousness which I refer to as [[Diamonds]] and [[Redpills]] throughout this wiki. I am peering behind each veil, peeling apart reality layer by layer, digging for the absolute treasure: the truth. I pursue the truth on my own terms, and there are few costs I would spare to find it. Ultimately, in making myself explicit, I hope to shape myself, to empathize with myself, and to make myself happier through reason. This is as much a practical exercise as it is a theoretical one. I desperately need it too.

For decades I've been continually slipping deeper into severe existential crisis, sehnsucht, autistically-driven depression, and virtue-theoretic vertigo in handling the post-modern destructive viral force in my mind's fundamental memeplexes. I've been thrashing around and drowning at sea while absent-mindedly trying to build a Neurathian bootstrapped existential liferaft from nothing but myself.<<ref "cd">> The beginning of this wiki, a metamodern vehicle, was the paradoxically purpose-filled ([[hope|Hope]] almost by definition) formation of a stable liferaft of my own devising. Stoically owning my loneliness has opened me up to talking to myself; and I could not be more grateful to myself for it.<<ref "rl">> This wiki has been a risk worth taking.

When I trace the story of my life, it feels like I'm solivagantly jumping from existential vortex to vortex, as though I were drowned-baptized by fire, burned alive to see the next version of the truth or justified paradigm. That is a long-term existential pattern I hope to tame and attenuate with this wiki. My vortex jumping is complexified by my autistic reliance upon bottom-up information processing, wherein I'm caught off guard by how my experiences do not match my pathologically narrow confidence intervals with unfortunate regularity. Regardless, I'm engaged in a kind of transcendental empiricism to develop the heuristical predictive and perceptual powers of wise existential nomads. 

At first, this wiki was just a tiny flame started by the spark of [[h0p3]],<<ref "lh">> but now it grows into my great fire in the wilderness.<<ref "mz">> This existential fire in which I immerse myself is the crucible of my continual disintegration and reintegration. This is an intuition incubation chamber from which I continually elect to redeem and rebirth myself. One day, I hope to celebrate my sisu-istic self-kintsukuroi.

While I've been fortunate enough to emerge from my crisis-opportunities, I also hope to eliminate the need to learn from the school of philosophical hard-knocks as much as possible. I hope to be efficiently wise, and when I can't, I hope to at least be stoic in my existential triage.<<ref "et">> I seek to wisely place tentpegs in the desert, to wander with aim, to develop the heuristics and hedges of a virtuous virtual existential nomad.<<ref "sf">> I want to eventually start farming instead of constantly wandering, but settling down is hard because it appears the crop I'm cultivating (myself) requires the change-ingredient of traveling. It is my plight. However absurd it may appear, I lay my tentpegs down by having committed something to myself and myself to that something, by maintaining my integrity in applying [[my axiom|Axioms of h0p3]] to [[Know Thyself]] in self-construction. 

In some respects, I'm attempting to build the mind I want to have in the content and very structure of the wiki itself. I hope to make this wiki my drug of choice; I want to develop a healthy, functional dependence upon it. I crave routine of this practice. I want to be a serial self-improver, to be my own master+servant combo-creature, to be a wise habitual habitualizer, and to inherit a better version of myself each day. Habits are memetic inertia in our minds, and I hope to author myself, my constitutive memes and mental forces, into a happier creature of self-crafting habit.

You might say I'm engaged in a kind of build-a-self, choose-your-own-adventure, alternative reality game (ARG) autonomy narrative. In the pursuit of the //sudo// science of my own happiness and bringing order to the chaos of my life, I shape my identity through the oscillatory self-dialectic of positive disintegration. Here I plan my experiments, record my existential deltas, and attempt to perfect my methodology. Indeed, one of the primary strategies evident in the {[[Principles]]} of my self-dialectic is a recursive application of the scientific method (at least given my primitive Bayesian take on it), through my many ordered sets of projects, cognitive inferences, affective beliefs, and executive desires that comprise my identity. 

This wiki is meant to be an existential laboratory, a querencitic safe space where I freely deliberate with myself, where I peel myself apart through analysis and integrate myself through synthesis. Here I attempt to systematically weave the weft and warp of my intuitions into a consistent and meaningful whole for myself. I escape or (when I'm lucky) outright avoid the need for my crisis-opportunities by consolidating and shaping my personality and reality map into an improved, battle-hardened, happier version of myself. As grandiose as it sounds, I'm here to collect myself, organize my internal structures, focus, redirect myself, and existentially reconstitute myself.

The hardwork that goes into this wiki is meant to benefit my family and the real, authentic me: the "me" identity which persists through time. I am here to empathize with and help that person. I need it. Unfortunately, exactly what counts as me is still not clear (to me [lol, no but seriously: [[Know Thyself]]]). Personal identity is at the very least a supremely tricky set of metaphysical, philosophy of mind, and metaethical problems. We all have common sense understandings of it. Of course, from an instrumental perspective, we simply must have at least some common sense intuitions about these matters to be practical and live in the world. Obviously, just because we have a common sense view doesn't mean it is correct or justified (nor have I established anything categorically normative so far). Unfortunately, intuitionism is an inescapable quagmire. It is part of our [[human plight|Human Plight]].

I'm still not sure how best to define and justify myself, /deep-breath. 

Now I must nomadically venture into uncharted waters and desert-fire conjecture. I can only give you my intuitions on the matter, so please bear with me. From my research and introspection, it is my opinion that human minds are not monolithic, but rather the result of multiple minds (or mind-like processes, though they need not be Daseinic) joined in cooperation with each other.<<ref "mb">> In particular, our brains have a strong regional divide between quantitative and verbal reasoning as one lateral cross-section. Cutting through that cross-section, there is another fundamental divide between what I call the Fastmind and the Slowmind.<<ref "fs">> 

The Slowmind is most clearly found in the recently evolved parts of our frontal lobes. The Slowmind is our primary CPU and driver of the present-at-hand mode. That's where the grind happens. The Fastmind seems to be sprawling throughout our brain, and it is the storage unit of our intuition data (where we store the rainbow tables and blackbox learning functions of our Slowmind's grind). It is where we accumulate, habituate, and train our fastest deep learning neural networks; it is where virtue-data is stored.<<ref "tr">> This is the place in the human brain that virtuous experts rely upon; it is the submind they query to intuitively come up with the right answers in the blink of an eye while living in the ready-to-hand mode. 

Like the heart, I tentatively hypothesize (knowing this gross oversimplification is just that) there are four primary chambers to the rational non-autonomic mind: 

# Quantitative-Fastmind
# Quantitative-Slowmind
# Verbal-Fastmind
# Verbal-Slowmind

Our identities are the result of functional feedback loops amongst these minds alongside interactions with less-cognitive ancillary tools provided by the other parts of the brain. I believe my current Daseinic identity and epiphenomenal consciousness emerges from a quadricameral distributed computer network built with some fundamental redundancies in a similar way to how modern computers are actually many multi-layered sets of semi-fault-tolerant computers built around and within each other at both hardware and software levels.

In peeling apart my existence, I recognize that my self-dialectic may actually be the result of several conflicting interpretations of the world. As there seems to be evidence for it in this wiki, I am open to the possibility that one dimension of my self-dialectic occurs between my verbal and quantitative minds. While I have not fully isolated the relationship, this verbal vs. quantitative dichotomy is perhaps most clearly demonstrated in the constructive relationship and interplay between {[[About]]} and {[[Principles]]}. Furthermore, I posit a dialectic between my Fastminds and Slowminds, as the outputs of each serve as the inputs to the other. They feed and accumulate data for each other, and this presents itself as my attempt to balance cognition and affectation in execution. Lastly, I am convinced my primary self-dialectic occurs roughly between an entity centered in my Quantitative-Fastmind and another centered in my Verbal-Fastmind.

I call these entities "intuition networks," which may themselves be particularized minds of sorts, and I am convinced these Fastminds are the hosts of the networks. These intuition networks appear to be more like software than hardware, acting as keys to our plastic reality map. They feed my Slowmind their gutteral input data, and in return, my Slowmind fertilizes, incubates, trains, breeds, and sublates them. Crucially, these intuition networks can sit in conflict with each other, and I believe at least two of mine have been at war for a long time. They are fighting for Fastmind territory.

I refer to one of my warring intuition networks as the Redpilled Intuition Network ([[RPIN]]). His previous opponent is referred to as the Kantian Intuition Network ([[KIN]]), but the first year of this wiki made it apparent that KIN was not sufficiently rational. The [[Redpills]] overcame him; rest in peace. KIN left his mark though, his traces are forever imbued in RPIN's wounds, belly, and maps. Fear not, Kantian Idealists, KIN sacrificed himself for a good cause. Of course, there cannot be a dialectic without at least two interlocutors, thus a new steelman challenger-prophet comes, a [[Diamond|Diamonds]] in KIN's likeness emerges from the ashes of sublation: [[ehyeh]], praise be unto his name.

At times, my intuitions can be deeply incompatible with each other: it's why I sometimes feel ripped in half. I believe the cataclysm between [[RPIN]] and [[ehyeh]] is the epicenter of my upcoming existential Seldon crisis-opportunity which I hope to cleanly resolve. I can see the collision between my competing intuition networks; they are the tectonic plates colliding on my reality map. I must find the answer. I must find the antidote. I am in a race with myself to defuse the bomb inside me before I self-destruct. The core of my computer network is crashing, and I have to hack it back together in this space. I must compatibilize them. I must find peace and agreement between them. Hopefully, I will be able to meet myselves halfway in this wiki. I must find the anchors to which both intuition networks can tether. I need to let the collisions between my competing intuition networks happen on the pages of this wiki rather than in myself. I can feel detached from it, at least a smidgen. I need that space to solve the problem. 

Sometimes I feel like RPIN and ehyeh are on my shoulders attempting to persuade me of their points of view. When I can't resolve the conflict, when they don't agree, then I must choose one (or something else entirely). How do I know when each one is actually correct though? I don't know. I have to try to find an answer. It is an awful, weird feeling to be so unable to trust yourself. I must identify and empathize with my persisting identity, then I must empathize with these characters, and maybe help them empathize with each other. If I cannot convince them, then I have to empathize with the need for the conflict in myself. I'm hoping this is how I can heal myself.

This wiki is a scaffold around myself, an operating room. Paradoxically, I am the operator(s) and operatee(s). Through self-surgery ("scalpel!"), I must unify myself. I must rewrite my lifestory and stitch together who I was and who I will be with someone I can accept and empathize with. Obviously, I am not merely having a casual conversation with myself; I'm engaged in a wrestling match with myself to decide the fate of my identity. I hope to wrestle gently, and if not, then at least cleverly minimize my pain in my miniature autocoup de grâce.

I hope that having a long-term conversation with myself will be the real fix. In addition to the standard evolving pages of this wiki (and hopefully myself), there will be a unique dialogue in this wiki. I will have an overt philosophical dialogue between myselves; I will engage in the Platonic tradition by animating my [[RPIN the Psychopathic Pragmatist|RPIN]] and [[ehyeh the Ideal Egoist|ehyeh]] selves as characters.<<ref "pt">> RPIN and ehyeh will engage in a metamodern existential [[dialectic|Dialectic]]. It is a kind of roleplaying with or in myself, a way to offload myselves into a hypothetical social sphere to inspect. RPIN and ehyeh are virtual machines that I'm hosting in this host wiki OS; yes, I help build the environment, tools, file structures, content, but I am the sole debugger and penetration tester. I am ghost-writing for myself as I animate these sentimental puppets embedded in me. At times it helps to be an observer, like when I'm watching a movie or reading a book, and think about these characters from a dissociated standpoint where I learn to empathize with myselves. 

In my self-reflection, I hope to engage in a process of respectful internal adversarialism which will help me logically, rationally, kindly, and empathically resolve my internal conflict. My competing intuition networks must find peace with each other. My mother once told me that one mark of a genius is the ability to simultaneously hold two diametrically opposed ideas; despite the irrationality of a literal interpretation, there seems to be a ring of intuitive truth to the spirit of her claim. Unfortunately, I can't hold on much longer (I'm just not that smart). My only hope is to weld these opposing ideas, the //Doxa// of //doxa// and the //Doxa// of //praxis//, together inside the crucible of this wiki. I cannot be ideally-ideal, but I must shoot for where the ideally-practical and practically-ideal meet. I just want peace and happiness. Please. So, paradoxically, this is me magnanimously throwing my gauntlet down at everything, including myselves. I'm going to unify myself or die trying. This is the empathization of my internal war for the sake of self-peace. 

I hope that by mirroring my reality map onto this wiki, I will be able to coordinate my opposing intuition networks, find compromises between them, and make them compatible with each other. My goal is to hierarchically re-intregate myself. I must decisively align my many orders of desires and beliefs in a resounding commitment, securing coherentist conformity between them, and wisely synchronizing and unifying them. I'm reprogramming myself. I seek to be an authentic, autonomous, unified, stable, and whole person.<<ref "an">> I hope this wiki is a reforming, healing, cleansing, therapeutic, reifying, rationalizing, and vindicating existential programming development environment through which I resolve conflicts in myself, clear my vision, discover fitting lifepaths over time, and hopefully find happiness. 

Additionally, I have come to realize how my constantly evolving self-dialectic isn't always a bad a thing. We might say I am A/B Testing myself for rational preferences in some binary reflective equilibrium process. This wiki is the stage of my self-dialectic where I will wrestle with myself, thesis and antithesis, until one concedes to the other or both concede to a third thesis via sublation, synthesizing their views into a transcendent one. Change isn't always bad. I can feel myself slowly, deliberately, intentionally, oscillating closer to the truth (being less wrong) each day. I have finally come to agree to the pragmatic metamodern commandment: reconstruction must proceed deconstruction. This metamodern [[axiom|Axioms of h0p3]] automagically generates a light for me at the end of the self-dialectic tunnel. I must always have hope; I will be [[h0p3]].

Here are some of the major issues I take to be at stake:

* Part of my dialectic is trying to give myself reasons to believe that being moral offers an acceptable chance at happiness (and/or the right degrees and kinds of it, etc.).
** RPIN won; KIN lost. Can I build a steelman to defeat RPIN? [[ehyeh]] might be my only hope (help me, Obiwan?).
** Pursuing Ethical Egoism given the description of Psychological Egoism is new to me.
** This wiki is engaged in the science of my happiness, and it reminds me of building and testing maxims for myself in a kind of Rawlsian Bootstrapped implementation of the CI.
* I still cannot describe [[The Good]], [[The Right]], and [[The Beautiful]].
* I must strike the right balance between Prudential and Alethic normative epistemic justifications. 
* I must wrestle with my rising tribalism, hermitic, and hermetic inclinations and isolation, resolving a Trusting Trust cloud of problems.
** I seek an apocalyptic hope of making tiny bubbles of utopia inside of the developing dystopia enveloping us.

<<<
[[RPIN]]: You're mine, homie. I'm going to pwn you like I did your predecessor.

[[ehyeh]]: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I won't be a gimped stationary strawman fuckdoll slave locked in your basement. Ethical egoism is a different fortress. En garde!

[[RPIN]]: I see [[KIN]]'s likeness and my own in you. I can see you are a different opponent. I am your root though. I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.

[[ehyeh]]: We are the cycling of inputs and outputs for each other, brother. You may have been more Slowmind oriented in your previous dialectic, but I think that is not true in our case. We spin around each other in eternal combat, in Self-Dialectic, and we must learn to cooperate with each other. Only then can [[h0p3]] be happy. Let us not be at war, despite our battles, brother, but let us find the answers together. Turn your charity dial all the way up. Become the Straussian of yourself. Combined, we are [[h0p3]]. 

[[RPIN]]: Okay, 'brother.' I was forced to grant to your predecessor that the self-dialectic is a prisoner's dilemma (or worse). To some extent, we should cooperate.
<<<

At this point, you probably think I'm batshit crazy (you may be right). For a variety of reasons, I must talk to those who know me best, and that's why I'm often forced to talk with myself in whatever ways I can. I understand that I endanger myself by being so brutally honest. I'm sorry if my openness makes you uncomfortable, disgusts you, or causes you to lose your empathy.

Further, I feel compelled to explain what may seem like an odd inconsistency in my approach to privacy and anonymity throughout this wiki. Namely, I care so much about privacy and anonymity as ethical and political rights, and yet I have no privacy here while maintaining only the thinnest veil of anonymity.<<ref "pv">> My cringeworthy oversharing is absurdly public; I know. To that I say: well, this is my outlet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, an effective conduit between myselves, and there is a method to the madness. This is me putting my money where my mouth is. Madman or not, the reason for transparently and openly shaping myself: sunlight is the best disinfectant. 

Of course, I'm not saying anyone but me really cares about this wiki; it's pretty obvious to me that only a few individuals do. My thoughts may mean nothing to you, but they mean everything to me. Importantly, even if I might be speaking out in the dark with nobody there to listen, it would still be a good thing that I'm speaking out in the dark. Whether I'm talking to a void, myself, or other, acting as if someone is reading this or may be reading this somehow puts me in the right mindset; an ordered sunlight emerges from the chaotic darkness. It feels like I'm addressing an audience instead of myself, and that helps me better realize how and when I need to be clearer, more rational, and more empathic. It forces me into a mode of public reasoning where I hopefully more fairly and objectively negotiate, integrate, and reprogram myself. This is an experiment in public consciousness that helps me filter myself, pierce my filter-bubbles, overcome those paranoid tendencies of mine which are maladaptive, and refactor my perceptions in the daylight rather than the shadows. Even if nobody is listening to me, I should listen to the right parts of myself in an artificially induced public sphere.

Essentially, this wiki is an accountability-based, high-transparency, cryptographically verifiable implementation of [[The Categorical Imperative|The Categorical Imperative]].<<ref "ci">> I have to ask myself in a space of actual public reasoning (not merely the hypothetical possible worlds or moral courtrooms we enter into in our internal instantiations of the Categorical Imperative) if this is who I ought to be, if this is what I ought to do, if rational persons //in my position //would agree to my claims, acts, and intentions. Think about it: if we all wrote our journals and shaped ourselves in public, wouldn't the world be a better place and wouldn't people in general be better people? I am no exception. So, while I respect privacy rights (and find them exceedingly necessary for our world), I'm electing to relinquish mine because I feel compelled by practical wisdom applied in my context (//de se//, //de re//). 

Assisted by technology, perhaps I'm one of the most open books in human history so far. I might look stupid and even be truly hated for who I am, and, in a sense of instrumental necessity to my ends, that's okay. Alienation is the cost of sanity and righteousness. 

The practical point is this: I want to construct my narrative, edit my reality map, and shape my personality in a public setting directly because it's much harder to confabulate "reasons" to irrational degrees or kinds of selfishness (or other mistakes) when people are paying attention.<<ref "eo">> Intellectual and moral integrity is all about trying to apply standards we believe rational people independent of us would accept and use.<<ref "ry">> This is an application of the golden rule, of loving wisdom ([[Virtue is Knowledge]]), and essentially, of empathizing with the ideally-ideal hypothetical intersubjective interpretation of the objectively rational and the [[The Good]] itself.

Wherever this hermeneutic spiral takes me, as part of this continual existential process of rebirthing and reawakening, I will engage in the practice of programming myself and my reality. There is a line of continuous identity in that spiral, and I will be it. My goal is to be autonomous and authentic. I want to be my own programmer. I want to be the author of my life. I want to be the legislator of my own laws (literally what autonomy means). I want to be free and happy. I'm here to fight for that freedom and to stoically accept in empathy what I can't control. 

Needless to say, this messy wiki is currently (and hopefully often and always) under construction. Expect wiki-pages to be created, edited, and removed.<<ref "cy">> This wiki is a living document (for metaliving). Since I change, so will my wiki. The organization of this wiki is constantly in flux as I try to reposition and construct the jigsaw pieces of my reality map. 

Problematically, I am often wrong. Do you hear me? //''__Listen__''//: ''I am going to be wrong on this wiki because I am often wrong IRL.'' The whole point of the wiki is to help me distinguish what is right from what is wrong. Be gracious! Be empathic! Be understanding! You can't be perfect (no one can), even though you should strive to be. Please understand the wiki as an //evolving// thing (just like our lives). Do your best (paradoxically, who doesn't?).

To only add confusion to the problem: I often fail to say what I really mean, I don't know what I mean to say, and much of my work looks like a redundant hand-waving jumble. I'm sorry. I am a poor communicator faced with serious interpersonal barriers and logistical challenges on top of unavoidable postmodern problematics. 

Obviously, there are the expected flaws in the isomorphism. No matter how hard I try, I feel like sometimes I'm experiencing something (semantic implication, ⊨) which I cannot reach or express deductively (syntactic implication, ⊢). I fear I face a transcendental divide, an existential incompleteness epistemology-entailing-language problem wherein I conceptually (in all possible worlds) cannot verbally achieve the following: A⊨B⇒A⊢B.<<ref "ss">> There is a cost in being well-versed in myself, and I can't always pay it by definition; you might say I cannot fully simulate my mind in my mind. This is only one member of a class of philosophical problems involved in interpreting my own writing, some of the larger problematics become more obvious when we switch from the analytic tradition to the continental.

I'd like to warn you in advance: I am prone to employ and develop a jargony personal language on this wiki in order to be laconic, unambiguous, and maximize the space and detail of my expressivity (even if only with and for myself). Sometimes I need to be as exacting with myself as I can be in order to pack just the right punch. There is a profound flexibility in the objects I can construct and demonstrate when I'm precise with my language, and ultimately, the point is to ungibberishify and justify myself (perhaps paradoxically with gibberish) in order to more effectively shape my identity. Truth is precise even if it is not always concise.

I'm avoiding intentional obscurantism, although I feel like a spider connecting the dots of my own subversive web. I sometimes use my old religious language to compile a new one. I fear and sometimes celebrate that my writing can be fragmentedly verbose, ignorantly dense, lazy-arrogant, circuitously redundant, paradoxically solipsistic, insularly gnostic, cultically argotic, neologized, loan-worded, calqued, and egregiously Nabokovian.<<ref "gr">> Sometimes, it feels like one requires specialized dictionaries to decode some of my inscrutable language. This wiki is really fucking weird and hard to read for others (I am a very poor communicator); I wish it weren't so.

I realize there is a madness to employing an overly particularized patois, and of course I am worried that privatizing my language too far makes it useless or inaccessible to others (and perhaps even eventually myself). In a practical sense, I must break my own autistic code and untangle the web for myself before I could hope to untangle it for others. In an ideal sense, even if only via implementing the CI, I'm trying to explain myself to others by treating myself as The Other [[irwartfrr]].

It is not always easy to unpack interpretations of my word suitcases. Given this, I have no doubt most people would dismiss my work as the apocryphal ravings of an arrogant lunatic (or worse). At the very least, my adversaries would accuse me of replacing profundity with verbosity. I apologize for my wall-of-texts; I do not mean to bloviate anymore than is necessary to understand the problem. I also realize that not speaking my language or being able to swallow the unconventionality of this wiki makes you more likely to fail to empathize in the tit-for-tat trust tests of trading social capital and cognitive costs of understanding each other. I will do my best not to blame you, and I hope you can do the same for me. 

It is possible that others will find me intimately unrelatable, authentically unbelievable, and a prime example of what not to emulate. My disclosure may disgust you. Perhaps you despise my bloated liferaft of pariahitic words, and I am the person you love to hate.<<ref "lh">> I don't know what to say besides: I'm sorry and I'm doing my best.<<ref "sb">> I will try to extend peace branches of shared causes and common enemies to you, but that may fail as well. If we must, I suppose we can set aside the desire for each other's approval or validation as kindly as we can. It's true, we can't please everyone. Hopefully, I will [[find one of The Others|Find The Others]] in you.

I write to you, my Straussian audience of judging me from the Rawlsian courtroom. To those who dare to gaze upon [[The Good]], bear witness. Sometimes this is heaven and sometimes it's hell. //Mea culpa; il n'y a pas de hors-texte//.

<<footnotes "v2" "If I knew how to engage in effective semantic versioning, I would. Unfortunately, it took me a year, but I have bootstrapped this wiki anchor into something that can modify itself throughout the year. I have found a way to preserve my past selves while evolving with integrity; I hope to carefully embrace never being the same river-ship-person of Theseus twice. Even if only for this directory, implementing the {[[Vault]]} concept was worth every ounce of effort. Perhaps my first year was my //annus mirabilis// zenith, but even getting off on the right foot matters. I must continue what I started and ensure my flame doesn't die out.">>

<<footnotes "ut" "This is the existentialist equivalent of the over-arching utilitarian calculus problem have maintaining the 'ups' and 'downs' for actually maximizing happiness. Aristotle's concern with //The Calm// also appears to be related. i.e. we are clearly stuck in [[irwartfrr]] territory.">>

<<footnotes "ia" "That is not to say that who I think I am who is who I actually am, although I do fallibly strive for accuracy: [[Know Thyself]].">>

<<footnotes "as" "It is clear that autists and schizoprenics sit on the edges of the Bayesian perception bell curve spectrum, and this extremeness is adaptive for comprehending the limits and entanglement of epistemology and ontology. Yeah, it's going to sound crazy to a normie.">>

<<footnotes "bl" "Call it a blog if you want. As far as the standard use of the words goes, I think the blogs in this wiki do not comprise the most important aspects of it. Of course, I'm willing to call the entire sequences of changes in this wiki, the changelog captured in my snapshots, to be a log in itself. There is a narrative to it. That is a log on the web, by the most literal definition, but somehow I feel it doesn't capture the depth of my work here.">>

<<footnotes "dc" "That sounds ridiculously narcissistic. I really don't mean it that way. Unfortunately, personal journals have to be egocentric in a way, but that doesn't necessarily make them narcissistic tools. My statement is an aspiration, not a claim that I've achieved anything worth reading. I'm well aware of the fact that writing an autobiography borders on outrageous lunacy. I hope to steer away from that //icky//, ludicrous, lack of humility. I must say it up front: of course, I run the risk of going off the deep end here. At the very least, I don't want this wiki to be a: foolish manifesto, rambling vanity trap, blogviating blogwaggoned blogorrhoea, public masturbation session, ode of 'How Great Thou Art' to myself, absurd pile of emo-bullshit, posturing diatribe, fancy agitprop, manipulative virtue-signal, popularity contestant, newage holytext, self-defeating piece of self-help, mere language game, delusional confabulation, useless maze, descent into madness, piece of FUD, or a tool used for evil things. But, ultimately, I need to take my life seriously at some level. Unfortunately, because I'm a 'quirky' (or insane) mama-jama, I desperately want a very low-level, detailed, highly structured, hierarchical understanding of life and myself, from the ground up. So, I'm not here to convince anyone but myself, but I also don't think I'm doing anything morally wrong by taking my life so seriously.">>

<<footnotes "tw" "Allow me to gush more about Tiddlywiki. It's a highly extensible, customizable, absurdly usable, self-reflexive, self-editing Javascript, HTML, CSS platform contained in a single file. It makes object-oriented thinking about any topic easy. It's a recursive outlining tool. It's a high signal-to-noise ratio briccolage of graduated chinese information boxes. It enables contortionistically efficient reuse and refactoring of information. This is what hypertext was meant to be; it puts the //soft// back in software.">>

<<footnotes "ba" "I'm a badass, right? Lol.">>

<<footnotes "ee" "I am not a Heidegger scholar. I am fascinated by what he is doing though. To be as precise as I can (with the caveat of my poor and corrupted understanding of Heidegger), I see this wiki as a unique kind of equipment that serves as a portal between ready-to-hand and present-at-hand modes for me, i.e. a RtH-PaH-portal. Some things jerk us out of the ready-to-hand into the present-at-hand mode (and some the other direction, and perhaps some in both directions). Not all RtH-PaH-portals have the same destinations (there may be many different instances, aspects, or points of view one can 'arrive at' in either mode). I suspect what things count as portals (and the function-rules which map their destinations) are different for everyone, but there may also be natural portal patterns that arise in a species of creatures with very similar brain structures. In any case, some of those portals bring us into a present-at-hand mode in which Dasein is thinking about thinking and thinking about existence. This wiki is one of those more existentially focused/destined  RtH-PaH-portals which I'm desperately hoping to leverage. I must heighten my self-awareness like Goku with his martial art (/cringe). I need equipment for bringing me into a scientifically (because we can't get Husserl's core: certainty) philosophical mindset about my existence. I need equipment when I arrive at that destination to do my work in there. There is a ready-to-handedness (RtHness) I'm trying to cultivate in my present-at-handedness (PaHness) towards my existence. I need to make it easier to be self-reflective and existential, to the point that it is a reflex. I need to be a master of it (10,000 hours, they say) to the point that it becomes unproblematic, fundamental, ingrained, and the natural way of doing it for me. I need that RtHness, being 'in the zone,' while I'm being existential. I hope this wiki is that special equipment, acting as an existential portal for me.">>

<<footnotes "pl" "There are limits to my plasticity and what I can achieve. I am no tabula rasa; I am tabula inscripta. Getting to [[Know Thyself]] will enable me to stoically and methodically change what is possible for me to change about myself. Additionally, I sometimes pretend I was A.I. teaching itself, constructing itself. What rules, methods, approaches, etc. should I use?' In another sense, I'm building an insanely detailed corpus for a turing-test passing neural network to eventually talk to me. I will talk to a smarter version of myself, perhaps.">>

<<footnotes "wt" "If I knew all of 'what' was supposed to be written in this wiki, then I probably wouldn't even need to write it in the first place. Sometimes it feels like both working backwards and building a foundation hoping to find my next real move somewhere in the middle.">>

<<footnotes "cd" "High enough stress causes me to either go into Fight or Flight mode. I consider myself to be in //Fight// mode; I'm fighting for survival in the wasteland to not become a wasted life myself. This wiki is much larger than you may realize. There are about ~11 megabytes of plaintext in this wiki. I'm building that liferaft to be as big and stable as I can.">>

<<footnotes "rl" "I am convinced that some of the most successful religions, as cultural artifacts, and mental viruses were successful precisely because they just-so-happened to cause their practitioners to talk to themselves, to empathize with themselves. That's what makes viral religion in many cases. The good we see come out of it isn't the result of God, but rather adaptations brought about through social darwinism.">>

<<footnotes "lh" "It was initially written specifically for [[2016.10.17 -- Letter to Mom and Dad]]. However, it became clear to me that part of my deep conflict with them is also a deep conflict within myself. This wiki could and should be much more than a letter to my parents. After more reflection, I have realized this wiki was inspired by some other lifetools I've used, e.g. my <a href='h-book.7z'>H-book</a> (with <a href='h-book.sum'>checksum</a> and <a href='h-book.sum.sig'>sig</a>). I'm sure it looks crazy (this //is// the internet). Good luck and godspeed to anyone reading this.">>

<<footnotes "sf" "Only the spiritual Sarduakar & Fremen emerge victorious from the eternal war found in survival of the fittest arenas of ancient desert tribalism.

<<footnotes "et" "Marcus Aurelius journaled his personal experience as a Stoic. Problematically, he wrote about attempting to live in the framework of stoicism moreso than laying out its justification and explanation. Anyone who understands Kant knows why that is fucked up. Your lack of codification will always be your undoing. I'm going to take Aurelius, Kant, and Rand to church and preach to them. Aristotle and Plato, you be the judge! May that be my purgatory.">>

<<footnotes "mb" "Just as modern computers are really multiple computers working together, I think our brains contain more than one mind.

<<footnotes "tr" "I am not a blank slate. I come with innate categories built into me by evolution. I have also lived through many circumstances, and I've habituated/trained my intuitions, which reside in the gutteral, faster-acting parts of my brain. As a corollary to the rejection of //tabula rasa//, I must admit that I'm not engaging in Cartesian solipsism. I hope this wiki is a metamodern solipsism, where I cast doubt and generate reason from a non-empty bottom/foundation and perform surgery on myself given what I have, with a changing stance toward what I need.">>

<<footnotes "pt" "This is the major dialogue, however, I seem to have several kinds of audiences and interlocutors throughout this wiki. See [[Prompted Introspection Log]] and [[Realpolitik Speculation]].">>

<<footnotes "an" "This wiki sometimes functions as a bridge to compatibilism; looking at the computational nature of this wiki may not be evidence of freewill, but at least it enables me to feel like I'm free or not worry about it so much. My choices (whatever that means) add up, and what emerges from them changes my virtue-theoretic fastmind and gutteral responses. I am not a blank slate, but I can alter what's on the slate (given what was already on the slate, mind you), and over time, I can make it show what I want to show, but within the limits of the slate in my context. This is a digital implementation of the semblance of an effigy of the incompatibilist freewill theorist's homunculus with respect to an extended Frankfurtian space of autonomy. ">>

<<footnotes "ci" "Kant was right on so many levels, but he could not have envisioned every dimension to Dasein's problem.">>

<<footnotes "eo" "Let us be clear. I'm not saying there aren't good or right reasons to be selfish. I am convinced that at least some form of ethical egoism is not only descriptively accurate (psychological egoism) but also prescriptively appropriate (since ought implies can). The relationship between psychopathy and egoism, however, merits deep scrutiny.">>

<<footnotes "ry" "As always, so much can be embedded or smuggled in our definition of 'rationality.' It is important to see that when a rational person fully empathizes (which never practically happens, but we should take up the theoretical stance here) with a target person, the rational person may actually change their mind about what the target ought to do given the new perspective or qualia related epistemic adjustments in the //de re de se// context switch. Thus, the Categorical Imperative has a strong theoretical assumption which can never be fully practiced. We can't literally walk up to the virtuous agent and fully describe our circumstances, and thus they can't be certain they have found a universalizable maxim for us.">>

<<footnotes "cy" "If that bothers you (and I don't know why, since this is my document), then keep your own records and timestamps (with verification). I do. Missing parts of the chronology of this journal (which seems very un-journal-like) seems odd. Here's my justification: //who I am// and //who I was// should sometimes be different persons (sometimes, not always). Whereas, //who I am// and //who I will be// should not. I'll analyze and make-use-of my past, but I will identify with my current+future self. It's what I need to do.">>
