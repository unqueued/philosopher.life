title: Tobfub the Pacifist

* Abilities
** Vicarity -- At-Will Type
*** I grant an ally the chance to use one of their abilities of my choosing (I also choose the targets). The character's player must agree to accept my divine gift, else my ability fizzles.
** Harm Inversion -- At-Will Type
*** My target's next spellcast or attack has a chance to heal and cleanse their target instead of damaging or debuffing their target.
** Break Fourth<<ref "1">> into Love and Merriment -- Daily Type
*** Target player (not character) must get me a drink of my choosing and gleefully sing me a song (of their choice). Furthermore, that player's character falls in love with my character for the rest of the game.<<ref "2">>
** Bestow -- Conditional Type
*** Any time I move into a position adjacent to any ally, we both have a chance to be healed.
** Divine Aura -- Innate
*** I and all allies adjacent to me roll twice for any saving throw.

* Weaknesses
** Hardcore Pacifism -- I cannot directly harm any PC or NPC.
** Pornographic Habits -- I rarely save against traps, and they are super effective against me.
** No Rest for the Wicked -- Anytime my character is damaged or I, the player, roll dubs, I must do one sit-up, push-up, or jumping-jack IRL.
