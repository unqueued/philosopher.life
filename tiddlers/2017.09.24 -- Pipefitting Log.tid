title: 2017.09.24 -- Pipefitting Log

I bought some missing tools and a bluetooth keyboard. I need to be able to write at work at full speed. The tools were clamps and magnets. A fitter needs all the things that fit stuff together.

I've decided I'm going to go with a smaller box for Pipefitting. And, I'll have a separate general tool box.

I want a piece of steel with pressed or cut "[My Name]'s Pipefitter Toolbox" stamped. I tape it, spray paint, and grind. Black letters on shiny metal. Finally, I can put a finish gloss coat on it. Then, I can weld it onto the box.
