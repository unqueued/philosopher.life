I've decided to play clickers differently. Previously out of an aversion to ads, I've run adblockers. I still do on my devices. Any device I have to use consistently, I will ad block. I like to play Clickers in VM though. That's what I do. Now I'm play the AdNauseam game. I'm clicking on the ads. I love that my browser does it, and I going to play games that way too. Benefits:

* Rewards the creator (at least in the short term)
** Insofar as they are't rewarded, I can only say that I'm gaming a system they've designed to game me. Turnabout is fair play.
* I fuck over those who pay for advertising by wasting their dollars.
* I fuck over advertisement, analytics, and anti-privacy firms and business models.
* Oh, I also get the benefits of Ads in my games. These are just another source of revenue inside the games I play. Lol.
