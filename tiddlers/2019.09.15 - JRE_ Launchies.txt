5 HR AGO
Not sure. Assume squeezing every ounce out.

nothing makes me feel more like my fathers son than getting fucking furious when a simple repair around the house goes wrong
5 HR AGO
I'm sorry. I know that feeling.
4 HR AGO
I think you tend it handle it very constructively and reflectively.
4 HR AGO
not so much this time lol
4 HR AGO
while your kids were here, two tiles fell off the corner of the bathroom
4 HR AGO
i have been putting off the repair since then, either cause i didn't have the mats to fix, or laziness
4 HR AGO
cleaned up the tiles and the wall, put mortar on them, started sliding them back in place, and another tile came off.
4 HR AGO
no big deal, clean that one up, test nearby tiles, should be fine
4 HR AGO
Lol. Like a Mr. Bean moment or something.
4 HR AGO
put more mortar on, start putting them back in place
4 HR AGO
last one doesn't fit
4 HR AGO
look at adjacent tiles, no grout room was provided, so its tile against tile...
4 HR AGO
clean off edges, try again.  no luck
4 HR AGO
take sandpaper and wear a chamfer into one tile, so i can push it in.... sandpaper doesn't seem to do shit to the glaze on the front besides chip it out a bit, but the back of it i wear away
4 HR AGO
keep at it, sand, try again, sand try again.  
4 HR AGO
finally get it in partially, and have the bright idea of tapping it in with my hand.  snap
4 HR AGO
i just took my hammer to the other one out of frustration
4 HR AGO
lol!
4 HR AGO
aye \
4 HR AGO
I'm sorry.
4 HR AGO
THAT was the moment where i was like, should have walked away after the first one broke
4 HR AGO
I have been there many times. Ugh.
4 HR AGO
when is [[k0sh3k]]'s interview again?
4 HR AGO
October 15-16th, no idea how they are cramming it all in
4 HR AGO
Tried building a more melee oriented turtle.
4 HR AGO
I think it's a mistake in this game
4 HR AGO
a turtle or a melee turtle?
4 HR AGO
like is there a caster turtle??
4 HR AGO
well, everyone is going to have some casting to do
4 HR AGO
I don't know how to draw the line here.
4 HR AGO
It's a meant to preserve the execute and heroic strike-based DPS
4 HR AGO
gonna have you wail on me and see how long I can live
4 HR AGO
probably not long
4 HR AGO
but, I now have another slot open
4 HR AGO
I just don't see the point in melee atm
4 HR AGO
but, would love to play one in PvP
