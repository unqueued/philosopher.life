Hi h0p3,

So great to hear from you, please forgive my slow reply.

Welcome to New Haven so soon! Exciting... I suppose if there's anything I recommend, it'd be the Yale Beinecke Library, which you should visit on a sunny day so you can see the sun shining through the marble from inside...

I actually live in New York (riding the Metro North one day a week up to New Haven) and only teach in the fall semester. But I showed your ever inspiring philosopher.life in my class this semester. We tried our own tiddlywiki to archive our writing exercises... http://suddenly.rocks/living-the-puzzle.html, if you're curious... it was our first time trying Tiddly...

p.s. Meant to ask... how do you like ProtonMail?
