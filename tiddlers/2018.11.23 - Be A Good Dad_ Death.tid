title: 2018.11.23 - Be A Good Dad: Death

My son started asking questions about the possibility there is nothingness after death at the Thanksgiving dinner table. The grandparents were, of course, worried about this. I gave the best answers I could to these classic questions. 

My son was broken up today about it still. This particular loss of innocence continues to hit him. It's not like we haven't discussed death since before he could even talk. It really hit him harder recently. I held him as he cried and we talked. He is existentially sensitive. I am proud of him.
