title: 2019.10.16 - JRE: Nicknamer

My brother had a 10 today. He was exhausted. He told me about a nicknamer and a joke with a missing fitting. My brother has another interesting coworker to reason about. 

We talked about my wife's feelings about the interview process. I walked through my reasoning about it. It's been a surreal process.

We talked about //The Boys//. I need to watch the last episode, clearly. 

He's been reading again! Fuck yeah. He also got a game, //Forager//, which my offspring might like.

Matthew is easy in the morning, difficult at night. 

My brother has been thoroughly cutting through characters, people, and the act of cheating on one's [[SO]].
