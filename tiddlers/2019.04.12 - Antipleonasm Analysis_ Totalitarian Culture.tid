title: 2019.04.12 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Totalitarian Culture

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The sign of a truly totalitarian culture is that important truths simply lack cognitive meaning and are interpretable only at the level of "Fuck You", so they can then elicit a perfectly predictable torrent of abuse in response. We've long ago reached that level.

I'm not sure if this is exclusive to totalitarian cultures. That fact is that not all identities are valid, and you will trigger amygdalas when you question their narratives, especially publicly. You are saying "fuck you" to invalidity in significant truthtelling. Some people think you can peel your beliefs apart from your selfhood, but that is nonsense. My problem with the Nazi boils down to a set of beliefs they hold and act upon, and this is compounded by the fact that they have no interest in considering the possibility the "fuck you" is merited, that they deserve to have parts of their belief systems destroys, amputated, or replaced. 

I'm not opposed to [[The Golden Rule]] as a totalitarian memeplex which punishes dark-triadicism (though I'm not convinced totalitarianism has the right connotations), albeit I think it would quite tolerant in many respects (as would be conceptually necessitated). There are, of course, kind ways to say "fuck you," and I value escalation.
