I should continue to draw analogies between RL and gaming. Abuse the neural network I already have in place.

e.g. In gaming, I'm always asking myself, where should I grind? What is the best use of my time? I need to do that again, and for my real life.

Furthermore, I need goals. Being rich and powerful was my goal in gaming. Then it was a competition and being th best. But, ultimately, I was not satisfied by any of my games. Best at what then? I need to see what I should pursue in life (well, duh!). 

Unlike gaming, I can't just up and change my life radically. I can't reroll or be fluidly mobile. There are serious costs to worry about.

Since I have accepted The Redpill, it is perhaps time to separate fact from fiction in Economics as best as I can. Micro and pscyh interest me the most.

If I don't get to be myself in a social interaction, then I am either enslaved to their approval or I am engaged in a business interaction. 

I considered moral obligation as another route. I don't think I can be accused of a false dichotomy here. It doesn't fit.

There seems to be a difference between prima facie empathy, feeling and thinking as theybdo, and empathy for who they couldnorbshpuld be, with their future selves, their persistent identities, and more objective constructions of their perspectives and who they are. Once you close that ignorance gap for them, empathy directs you elsewhere sometimes. It has that "if only I knew now what I knew then" thing going on.
