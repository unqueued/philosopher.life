title: 2020.03.29 - Prompted Introspection: Rural Village

!! Think of how your life could have been harder or easier in some particular way. How do you think you'd be different?

I modified the question from [[2018.06.23 - Prompted Introspection: Fucking Samwise]]. What would life be like if I had grown up as a poor kid in some rural Indian village? It would be so much harder, the odds of surviving (let alone thriving) would be significantly worse. I've only met expats, read about India, or talked with people who have visited. I don't have enough knowledge to say what would tend to be great about it. There's a Romantic [[beauty]] to it, and there is still the seemingly timeless human condition regardless of the circumstances. 

I don't think I'd have survived, or if I did, I think I would be a far more evil human. I don't have the affective skills that most people have, and I think I'd end up seeing the world as webs of blackboxes (though, I do not think I would be able to articulate that). I think I would do fine making predictions in a much smaller [[phenomenological]] world though. Man, this question is hard. I don't know.
