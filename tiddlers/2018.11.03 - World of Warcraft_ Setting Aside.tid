title: 2018.11.03 - World of Warcraft: Setting Aside

The game has clearly inflated over the past decade. It was always a large world, but it's even larger now. Sifting through the impossibly large for what is salient is what that game is about now. What's really salient about it? If I want to maintain relationships, I should do it by just talking to people. I do not need this timesink in my life. It feels like a waste. Why should I take this drug? I just don't see it. The hedonic factor can never be absurdly high enough anymore. It's just something to do. I want to have better things to do with my time.
