I am sending this reply with a musky pork pie smell. See the attached WIFF file.

>    Yet again to my ignorance[...]the joyless buzzkill rhetoric-hawk.

Ha-ha! Well, you are becoming very endeared to me, hawk. And you are right to keep us all in check. The buzz that you do kill—and it’s certainly not a buzzard-sized buzz—is not any buzz that was killed just 'cause.

>    I’m especially interested in[...]the delicious bonus.

Oh, I see this in you and I applaud it—loudly, standing—an ovation which goes in a great arc, knocking over the drinks of everyone else standing around me. (Part of this ovation is a simple appreciation of your last epic missive, which is due.)

I only side more toward art because I get so much out of it. I can’t think of a reasoned argument that has transfixed me as much as “Starry, Starry Night” has. And I don’t reach for a reasoned argument when life has fallen apart, but for Neil Young. (I am not arguing with you here—I know you have these things, too, and that you love cartoons and songs and shows and all that. And, come on—you are nuts for ASCII art, amirite? Alas, I also do fall into the trap you’re talking about of form over function.)

Alright, so with all those caveats in mind, we may end up doing this all by hand and passing tiddlers around—I’m also going to play with some styled RSS tonight and see what happens. And we’ll toss some ideas around.

One thing I know for sure: I don’t want to go too crazy on fonts, because I don’t want readers to have to load ten Web Fonts to make this work. That would be EXACTLY fonts over functions. But the basic colors and stuff—worth a try, yeah?

(One time you asked if you should read Vigoleis—no, don’t. He’s mine. And it’s like Infinite Jest, it will take you way too long to read and you’ll never want to read it again. Infinite Jest also wasn’t for me.)

??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????<<ref "n">>

Oh, also, from the footnote:

>   In a blind, stripped-down test, I’d prefer[...]that asshole h0p3, lol.’

I feel this way about the words, too, for sure—but also the appearance. It’s like remembering The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch for both the chitinous foreheads inside and the orange-red cover of the bug-eyed man with the robotic hands. It all comes flooding back like that.

<<footnotes "q" "I know my [[words|2018.09.25 - kickscondor: Style]]. I'm just having a laugh at them in this reduction. I am deliberately misquoting kicks' correct quotation!">>

<<footnotes "n" "Ninja-edits: A Good Thing! I'm the worst about this, lol. I'm considering adding tiddler versioning to TW just to allow people to diff. I've not looked into how much space it cost to do this. Perhaps it should be a feature I turn on when I think a tiddler needs it. This tiddler, for example. My snapshots largely save my butt on this transparency issue, but I think direct communications maybe require even more effort. This is a debate I've been having with myself for a very long time on this wiki. I'm not sure how to do it correctly...It's like the note/letter just keeps growing! It's not really a static note/letter, it's something else, and I dearly hope to avoid any accusation of being underhanded in how I've caused it to change. I'm going to figure out a clean way to 'go with the flow.'">>
