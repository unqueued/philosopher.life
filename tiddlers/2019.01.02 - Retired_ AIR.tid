//I see my son in my brother.//

AIR is my youngest brother. He is a beacon in my life. I have come to understand my brokenness through him as a mirror to another life. He is a reminder to me that self-hatred must be carefully checked, always limited to the service of loving [[The Others|Find The Others]]. Even though his life largely isn't his fault in my eyes, he's the man who is forced to fix it.<<ref "h">> He gives me [[hope]] for myself too.

I'm actually not sure how long I've been experiencing depression, but I can guarantee the birth of my daughter and beginning of the realization of our lives in capitalism was a strong season of it. My most profound depression (thus far) occurred during my PhD program when my brother lived with us and after he left. Despite my failures, it was there my brother helped me empathize more deeply with mental illness and with us. 

AIR is a gay man raised by libertarian-evangelical-fundamentalist dark-triads; he's had to find his own way through a sea of enemies. My youngest brother's differences, especially his age, made him a blacksheep of our family. He is also a crucial lens through which I have come to understand who our donors [[MWF]] and [[SLT]] really are. I felt like Darth Vader choosing between the Emperor and Luke; I now defend my brother with zeal. Too long did I fail to realize we have been victims, and worse, too long did I fail to do anything about it. Looking back, I can see he was a significant catalyst to beginning this wiki.<<ref "l">> The hardships of schizoid alcoholism and homelessness in a world that continually denied him a right to his personhood has disfigured him, and yet his beauty emerges. In the pursuit of vindication and restorative justice, I aim to defragment and unify our story. 

Even for an anxious person converted to a misanthrope through the abuses of the world, he's still easy going, and I do my best to express who I am to him. Sometimes he knows exactly what I'm saying in a way that nobody else seems to, and I really appreciate his patience with me. It's important to me that I do not attack, otherize, or belittle my brother. I try not to wrestle with him because I think I will damage him in the process. My goal is to be encouraging, offer what I'd do in his shoes, and listen. I've got to help my brother find himself as he sees best.

My brother is a good man who oscillates into becoming someone who loves himself.

* Search through the wiki and start grafting my thoughts back into this. I want to be able to think wisely and clearly about who we are.
