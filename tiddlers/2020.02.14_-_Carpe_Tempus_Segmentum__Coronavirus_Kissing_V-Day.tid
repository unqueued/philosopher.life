title: 2020.02.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Coronavirus Kissing V-Day

* Woke at 11.
** Delicious.
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Dialectures
** My daughter is driving me insane.
** My son is honest.
* Bliss
* Chats
** VC is working well enough with my offspring. [[ltf]] a ton. I can more rapidly annoy my offspring. 
*** Today, we even had my wife join us while she was just on her laptop. Still lots of written chat, but voice fills in gaps nicely.
** I'm spending more time just maymaying than usual.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Called [[Charlie]]
** Sadly, I've not seen him online at all. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I wasted my gift, lol. I'd have used it too. But, who knows, he may change his mind.
* Called [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
** Wasn't quite thinking: it's V-Day! Lol. Ummm...yeah, go be with ur lady, fam.
* Wife and I picked up dat liquid teotwawki prep goodness. 
** Talked about her work.
** I think my wife is increasingly nervous as a driver. She still gets shit done, ofc, but I feel the anxiety more.
*** Could be the lack of meds, but I don't think that is enough an explanation. I feel us aging here. Our minds just aren't as good, and we're also more aware that they never were good in many cases.
** The last time, it lasted for 4 years! Noice. 
* Fireman Time!
* //Battlestar Galactica// + Dialectures
** Can't help myself on the bliss. There's a fuckton to talk about.
* Ribs, wedges, asparagus, brownies.
** They are so much more wealthy and healthy at Yale than we are: except for my wife's boss's boss (though, she has so many bosses, it's absurd) in this case who demolished the brownies?

* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 2:30?
