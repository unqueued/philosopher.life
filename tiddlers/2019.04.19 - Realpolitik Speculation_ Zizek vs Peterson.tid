title: 2019.04.19 - Realpolitik Speculation: Žižek vs Peterson

At least the mod didn't hug Peterson's nuts too hard. =)

I don't trust either of them to define //Happiness// effectively enough.

!! Peterson:

Peterson outright ignores Zizek. Straight for the weakest version of the Communist Manifesto rather than a steelman of Marx. He's willing to be [[Straussian]]ly charitable to many authors (Jung, perhaps), but not Marx. He thinks critical thinking is pure attack. That's insane. 

* History is to be viewed primarily as an economic class struggle

There are other motivations. That's fine. It's really about power, imho. He agrees to hierarchy and centralization of power to some extent. Thinks this is more about animalistic hierarchies rather than just human constructions, and thus "can't be attributed to capitalism." He thinks the winner-take-all dog-eat-dog world predates capitalism, and thus we should peel them apart. 

Peterson redirects to the claims that individuals struggle within themselves, and we are at odds with "nature." He says Marx ignores this entirely. He claims human hierarchies are not based upon power! Wat. He claims it's not about exploiting people. 

Not easy to make a firm division who is exploiter and exploitee, according to Peterson. 

Russian bogeyman. 

Binary class division, thinks this is identity politics, and doesn't want to think all the evil comes from one (duh doy! Even Marxists will make that claim...it's important to see that one side is radically more culpable and capable of doing something about it though!). 

"crazy idea" jump. Did he not prep enough?

Weird claim about wages not actually being driven down. 

The hypothesis of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" and violent revolution. Believes sudden access to power corrupts the centralized powers embedded in the uprising proles. He doesn't believe decentralization is possible! Look at this insanity. 

He claims capitalism isn't centralized. Wat. 

Claims that Marxists can't explain the value-add of management, that they can't understand how businesses work. This is claiming there is no moral business or they are just ignorant of what is possible for business. Falsely narrowing possibility.

Claims Marx is against profit. Not exactly, homie. He says capitalism is necessary for eliminating wasted labor. 

Says Marx believes the "small percentage of the proletariat who run the society" in socialism will make citizens "hyperproductive." Then everyone will all the material they need, and utopia will be magically ushered in. 

Thinks we shouldn't be handed everything otherwise we should make trouble and destroy things just to have an adventure.

Flat screen line is retarded. His jazzfingers make it better though.

Wait, I don't see 10 reasons here.

Think he has destroyed Marx, rofl. Calls himself a scientist too. Jung. My god.

Ignores inequality, claims capitalism produces wealth and nothing else does. Free market stats. Claims capitalism is eradicating poverty faster than any other option. Glides over the absolute poverty line. Pinkerism is up. The poor are getting richer under capitalism, therefore capitalism. Why is the free market economy the best way? 


!! Zizek

Yeah, he #rekts id-pol. That should not be ignored.

China, Totalitarian and capitalist. Harmonious Confucian emphasis.  

Attacks happiness! Yay. Schopenhauer's point. Meaningful cause beyond pleasure is necessary. Qualified. 

"We are not mere instruments of some higher cause." Well...not exactly, kid. This is a hard problem. 

Trump is a pomo prez. Sanders old-fashioned moralist. That's about right. 

Anti-religion claim is interesting. I'm fairly opposed to all the standard religions, but I'm not so convinced. He's going to have to put tentpegs down even here, unfortunately. 

Pain is not itself authenticity. Attack on self-denigration of neolibs. Sustaining our identities (jealous husband and nazi examples). Agreed on the problem of storytelling as rhetoric. 

Telling ourselves stories of our lives is not enough!? "An enemy is a story you have not heard" -- The truth lies outside what we do in telling ourselves stories! This sounds like a realist perspective (though I think how we tell those stories is still fundamentally necessary and not a "lie" all the way down as he says).

Destroys liberals who chose to be blind to how they brought about the conditions for Trump. 

How does capitalism 'equalize' us too much? In what respect? "I can't have it so he can't"? Meh. Piketty reference, inequality is targeted. I hate to say it, but Zizek is not providing a good enough explanation of equality (I expect far more of him than Peterson). 

"Transfunctionalized"

Zizek's concept of freedom is not well-formed.

Excellent point about refugees and our complicity. 

Neoliberalism is a fake term? Market is limited, but not in the right way. 

The light at the end of the tunnel is a train coming towards us. 

Fascinating that Zizek stuck to the topic of the debate more clearly, and Peterson zagged laterally.

!! Peterson:

Criticism of capitalism, but claims there was no defense of Marxism. Capitalism is the worst form of economic arrangement except for every other one we've tried. Denies that capitalism is the answer to the problems which confront us. Fascinating. 

Think decent working class is the limit on diminishing marginal utility. *sigh

Thinks our ecology is better than the dismal doomsayers claim. Interesting sleight of hand.

Claims capitalism isn't responsible for the crises we face. Lol! 

GDP as measurement =/.

Red herring on materials here. He thinks capitalism will give rise to the answers here though.

Strawman to think Marxism conceptually gives rise to identity politics of every kind. 

Why would I think we are each the locus of the ultimate value/good? I agree to our individual responsibility. He argues for strict egoism and cooperation only in virtue of egoism.


!! Zizek

Happiness only as a byproduct. But, that can't be Peterson's point of view.

Thank you, it's not hierarchiless. 

---

Super disappoint. I feel like neither of them are pushing for decentralization effectively enough. Peterson because he is [[Randian]], no reason for it. [[Zizek]] because he only has a qualitative story attempt.

---

Fascinating claim. Plays Zizekianism up to deny Marxism. Mystery, but rhetoric. Strawman attempt.

---

Who is the pomo-neo-marxist? Why is that Marxist? Impotent moralizations of the SJWs. HE's ATTACKING A FUCKING STRAWMAN!!! BOOM. Peterson is dead in the argument.

I'm radically opposed to postmodernism, but I am a Marxist. Of course, I'm happy to fire at the those who think marginalization is fundamentally the moral high ground; I think psychopaths should be marginalized. 

I'm shocked that Zizek doesn't push him harder on this point. What is happening here?

---

Yet, Peterson believes happiness is a byproduct too, so he says.

Developing a vision of [[The Good]] is necessary, but you can't relativize it, and you can't be an internalist about it. 

Acting in accordance with duty is what matters. But, the expansion might just be in accordance with duty. READ SOME GOD DAMN KANT! 

This is gnosticism, likely some noble savage fallacy is at play. That our unconscious, untainted, is our perfection. Bullshit. You don't get to say dog-eat-dog, and then praise our unconsciousness.

---

Zizek cannot define [[Love]]. 

<<<
You are free when you discover that the distance that separates you from God is inscribed into God Himself.

...

Separation from God is part of divinity itself...
<<<

This is transcendence. 

The house is in order, the overindividuation is absurd...

---

[[The Golden Rule]] is the only rule. You missed it.

It's weird that he says the macro and micro are solved at the same time, and then he comes around to saying we have to solve our personal lives first before we have earned the right to solve the sociological problem at large. That's fucking insane.

---

Zizek's take on Hegel and the fall boils down to a constructivist interpretation of [[The Good]]. That somehow The Fall retroactively induces the concept of [[The Good]] is absurd. [[The Good]] is discovered, it predates us. The rationalists were wildly closer. I'm so disappointed.

---

Peterson's amalgams of everything they seen and heard (and experienced), and finding the truth that constitutes that integration...this is [[Self-Dialectic]]. Peterson has made a fine move here. 

He claims not to be making the Randian move. He thinks it's about responsibility. But, really, he's just expressed a slightly more effective version of Randianism, borrowing from the virtue-theoretic point of view. It's still a lost cause! 

He has no right to talk about iterative prisoner's dilemmas unless he's going to point to [[T42T]]. 

The [[phenomenology]] of meaning, however, IS NOT MEANING ITSELF! 

Omg, I'm fucking surrounded by anti-realists. Yall are driving me insane.

I grant the responsibility point, but I'm convinced it is simply used to silence people and make people think that decentralizing power isn't the most effective route. I think it's still sleight of hand.

---

Fascinating. I think Peterson looks like a generalized winner here because Zizek didn't fucking say anything. There was no real defense. There was no steelman offered. Peterson left 10k holes, and Zizek made only a handful of good counters. Where was the construction?
