title: 2018.09.05 - putanumonit@gmail.com: Recur This

Dear Jacob,

You're blowin' my god damned mind, son. I literally roared laughing while reading your poem: https://putanumonit.com/2018/08/28/very-model/. I personally (https://philosopher.life/) feel pwned from across the interwebs. Holy fuck does the shoe fit. Thank you for posting that savage bitchslap; it deeply burns.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
