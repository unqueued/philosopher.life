title: 2018.05.11 - Retired: Music: Library

I need to rebuild my library, however, I want to be extremely picky. My last collection was 500GB, but it was lost in 2009ish (complete RAID5 failure). It was large because there really weren't services that could replace my own ability to build playlists from files I owned. Now, I just want perfect playlists of "I need to hear that song right now."
