title: 2017.08.20 -- Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.08.19 -- To-Do-List Log]]
** Edited. Added some stuff.
* [[2017.08.19 -- Unschool Log]]
** Mmm. My daughter saw how serious I was and wanted to give more thought to it. I appreciate her honesty and thoughtfulness.
* [[2017.08.19 -- Pipefitting Log]]
** I should just take an inventory next time of what he has. I love going through other pipefitter's toolboxes.
* [[2017.08.19 -- Carpe Diem Log]]
** It was a damned good Saturday. We meant to go swimming, but it just didn't work out.
* [[2017.08.19 -- Prompted Introspection Log]]
** It's a great question. Obviously, I've been trying to answer it for a long time. I shouldn't feel bad that I can't (no one else seems to have either).
* [[2017.08.19 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** I'm thinking I should refrain from cannabliss during the weekdays as much as possible. The sleep is too valuable, and having Friday and Saturday for Cannabliss use is fine with me. Of course, if I need it, then I need it. I've shown for large portions of this year that I can function (even if below average) without it.
* [[Tools for My Children]]
** I am very excited about tooling my children literally.
* [[Marriage: Shows My Wife and I Both Like]]
** We had a good discussion. I want to find more that we can enjoy together. I consider a sign of a healthy relationship that we appreciate each other's values, perspectives, and consume at least some things together.
* [[Atlanta]]
** Reminds me of my time in Charlotte.
* [[2017.08.19 -- Link Log]]
** Not a productive week, I have to tell you. =(
* [[Construction Humor]]
** Should collect more.
