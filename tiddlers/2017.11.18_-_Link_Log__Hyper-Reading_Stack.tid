*** I'm not interested in censoring and prevention of children from having access. I do think it's immoral to prey upon children. This is an interesting move.

* Fishy

*** Sounds like they want to be a shitty middleman. I do not trust the Brave platform at all. However, I think the idea is very interesting. Perhaps there is a way to make it work.

*** KYS company, but also...this isn't representative. I think it will be used as Right-fodder.

*** .93 Liberal Alignment score?
*** Halfway on harm and fairness; ingroup, purity, and authority were pointless to me. I, of course, have a billion questions and problems with their questions.
