title: 2019.04.25 - DeathOfRobinhood: Thanks for reaching out

Hi h0p3,

I'm the guy on Reddit who linked to the Christian Thinktank.

Your wiki was disorienting at first, but became more agreeable once I just picked a spot and continued to read in the direction my inclinations lay, without worrying about the threads I didn't follow.

Still pretty early in my exploring. You lay out your being in such a naked fashion it seems almost rude to examine and comment upon your content directly (though it certainly doesn't help that I'm not familiar with a muchof the literary and philosophical references you make!) Much easier to consider form (and I find your form super intriguing) atm.


In the interest of transparency, as I stated in the SSC Reddit, I'm pretty inseparable from my underlying proselytic motivations, although I consider exchanging ideas honestly with someone a rewarding end in itself (is this an untrue clich√©? I take it you'd conceive of this 'exchange of ideas' as a means to an infinitely higher end, that is, the Good, at least as far as that can be exemplified in human personalities, which, I suppose, would make you a more earnest proselytizer than me!)

You write about some reaching out to you with an aim to co-operate, or else, to seek help. Do you get many people reaching out with the aim of 'helping' you?

Speaking of which, I found a dead link. Hypertext for the 'The Golden Rule' in the entry for 'The Right' leads to an error.

Thanks for this experimental space you've created. May your labour be fruitful.

Peace,
and
Eagerly awaiting a response,

Ivan
