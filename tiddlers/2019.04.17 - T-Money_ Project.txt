How are you feeling, homie?
TUE 9:47 PM
You are heading back to work in a few weeks. What's going to change, if anything?
TUE 9:47 PM
Hey. Man. Sorry I missed your texts. All is good. Looks like I go back 5/6. Just turned in my paperwor yesturday for my return to work to be complete. I am learning to live life with pain and discomfort. It is definitely a change. I am not sure the true extent of the change.
WED 8:19 AM
I have been slowly increasing my activity level to match that if a 10hr shift. But that doesn't include my 3hr commute.
WED 8:19 AM
Not showing alot of self dislipline in dieting, but still actually losing weight. Lol.
WED 8:20 AM
Noice. =)
WED 8:22 AM
I have no idea if I will. Be able to do my job fully. But I'm not afraid of failure. I have alot to fall back on and I'm not afraid to completely change my career... It's all good, just life.
WED 8:22 AM
To be honest I am more concerned with my ability to work on my projects. But even then, it is all just material things. I only have one project that is truely sentimental. And I can work on it for the next 20 years and enjoy doing it (my grandad truck) every other project is just shit
WED 8:24 AM
How are you doing?
WED 8:24 AM
Was talking with my daughter yesterday about how our persistent identities are narratives of our projects.
WED 8:25 AM
Well, I hope it will ease up for you. I'm still unclear on how this all happened. You seemed fine and then boom, it got bad real fast.
WED 8:26 AM
I'm fine. Schooling kids and myself. That is my life.

Basically I had a digenerative disk. That was damaged over time. And while. Playing tennis with my daughter I twisted the wrong way and the disk herniated and began pressing on nerves.
WED 8:29 AM
It's a time bomb before the disk ruptures and I have to have sugery. So my lifestyle. Is forever changed.
WED 8:30 AM
I can no longer treat my back and my body like a machine.
WED 8:30 AM
I have had alot of time to come to terms with the injury.
WED 8:31 AM
I'm sitting in a computer chair. If I slouch it causes bak pain.
WED 8:31 AM
Really just sitting here causes pain. Lol.
WED 8:32 AM
=/
WED 8:32 AM
But manageable. Like a dull toothache.
WED 8:32 AM
Sounds like you have to plan for the surgery.
WED 8:32 AM
I'm going to attempt to avoid the sugery at all costs.
WED 8:33 AM
Up too and including job changes.
WED 8:33 AM
Moving, selling property, projects, blah.
WED 8:33 AM
Generally guys and my wife who have had the sugery suffer no difference in pain.  The sharp pains are eliminated, which through PT mine mostly have as well. But they live with pain.
WED 8:35 AM
Such is life. "I cannot imagine why you wouldn't welcome. Any change my friend"
WED 8:36 AM
I am reminded by kilcoyn. He had my same symptoms. He ignored the problem and pushed. His same disk ruptured. He had emergency sugery and was paralyzed for nearly a year.
WED 8:40 AM
It could always be worse. If I make steps and changes now. I might be able to make do with my current state.

Influential enough that I've reviewed the prince within the last couple of years.
WED 8:01 PM
Lol
WED 8:01 PM
And a Max Lucado book too.
WED 8:02 PM
This is not my "library" just some. Books that I had stashed in the living room for light reading when they watch TV I don't like.
WED 8:47 PM
I have another stash in the bedroom. And then a full bookcase in the basement. Doubtful to the extent of your reading.... Not even close. But I made an effort. I am excited for my kiddo to reach her next reading level and maturity level. Alot of good books for her age that I remeber reading. And I get to read them again with her.
WED 8:49 PM
I keep trying to give away our books, but my wife's poverty makes her a tiny-hoarder. She collects everything.
THU 9:17 AM
It is wonderful when kids start hitting their stride in reading. I hope it snowballs out of control for you.
