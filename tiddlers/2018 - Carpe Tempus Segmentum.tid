!! Audit:

* Fascinating to see nesting comments.
** I wish I had more of them! =)
* The name change has been a result of [[Autogen]] behavior. This is actually something I hope to correct. These are just [[Carpe Diem]] logs, and I want to be able to scale differently if and when the time would come. We'll see how the button work goes.
* I've done a decent job of thanking and forgiving myself; I appreciate when I'm grateful too.
* This is where I talk about my drugs and hedonic treadmills.
* I had weekly logs, lol!
** That is too much work right now (and probably requires very different tooling to make it viable for me).
** I'm pleased with my experimentation.
* I think I did a much better job in my [[audit]]ing in the earlier parts of the year. That said, I wasn't stretched across this wiki nearly as much.
* I can feel the heat between this log and [[TDL]]. Ouch!
* I feel like I've been triaging life quite a bit in this log.
* Well, a year later, and I'm finally on the nodejs version of TW! =)
** Good job, mate!
** Thank you, [[j3d1h]]!
* Bliss, caffeine, Inform the Men!, (A)Fireman Time!, and socializing have been the best drugs this year.
* I can still plainly see my political, ethical, and philosophical views bleeding out on these simple pages too. My story for myself really is embedded in here.
* 2018 was not the year I thought it would be, but I'm grateful for it.
** I'm lucky to have survived it. I came very close twice this year. It is meaningful that I did not.
