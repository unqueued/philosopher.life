I found a group last night.

Nine-play healer or aoe?
FRI 12:25 PM
I don't know what you mean by Nine-play. I was just AoE DPS.
FRI 12:40 PM
We pulled huge amounts. AoE is perfect for it.

Nice*
FRI 12:40 PM
Dungeon?

Error handling incoming message

Any deaths, or was aggro not a problem?

FRI 12:51 PM
I did pull aggro a couple times. No need to FD. Lesser Healing Wave as instant is outstanding.

Looks like dailies are worth doing.
