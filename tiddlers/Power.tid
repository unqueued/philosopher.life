title: Power

//Levels Over9k.<<ref "p">>//

<<<
Each thing, insofar as it is in itself [by its own power], strives to persevere in being. The striving by which each thing strives to persevere in its being is nothing other than the actual essence of the thing.

-- Saint Baruch Spinoza, //Ethics//, 3P6-7 
<<<

<<<
To whom much is given, much is required.

-- Luke 12:48
<<<

<<<
[Agent] A has power-over [object] B to the extent that [they] can get B to do something that B would not otherwise do.

-- Robert Dahl, //The Concept of Power//
<<<

<<<
The measure of [an agent] is what [they do] with power.

-- Pittacus
<<<

<<<
Justice and power must be brought together, so that whatever is just may be powerful, and whatever is powerful may be just.

-- Blaise Pascal
<<<

<<<
We cannot avoid using power, cannot escape the compulsion to afflict the world, so let us, cautious in diction and mighty in contradiction, [[love]] powerfully.

-- Martin Buber, //Power and Love// 
<<<

<<<
I am not interested in power for power's sake, but I'm interested in power that is moral, that is [[right]] and that is [[good]].

-- Saint Martin Luther King Jr. 
<<<

<<<
[Agential] [p]ower [materially implies] a debt to [[others]].

-- Letitia Elizabeth Landon, //Ethel Churchill//
<<<

<<<
Power confronts the individual as the [bindable [[fff]] implementor of the] universal, as [an unmoved moving causal] reason which informs reality [in a particular context].

-- Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, //Dialectic of Enlightenment//
<<<

//Power// is an upward/downward or inner/outer subordinating relationship of objects positioned in hierarchies or spirals of meaning or being. Power is the [[dok]] to which an object is potentially or actually expressed in, constituted by, or constitutive of [[The Dialectic]] into [[infinigress]]: the binary and emergent computation of reality, including and into transcendent ideality. For the finite, expressing power to overcome resistance has a price, and insofar as power is temporal, it is both property and process.<<ref "i">>

The totality of non-agential power is logically equivalent to all possible causal and conceptual relationships of objects which could not choose to do otherwise, including constraints on autonomous agents.<<ref "bb">> Non-agential power forms the sufficient explanatory reasons of ontology and epistemology outside of, preconditions to, and medium for agency, and hence it is never directly subject to [[The Right]] except insofar as it conceptually comprises [[The Right]].

All things considered excepting the freedom of transworld identities obligated by [[The Right]],<<ref "w">> the stack of causal or metaphysical sublation of concepts or material objects in dialectics is the power of the being of becoming, meaning of being, or being of beingness (essentially, [[The Infinite]] eternally being [[Itself]]). This is the truth-bearing //explanatory power// of "isness," the positivist description, including an explanation of the being of "oughtness." Prima facie, it appears conceivable that it could immutably obtain with no agents at all.<<ref "sg">> With respect to the freedom of transworld identities, however, power bifurcates into power-to actualize potential with no other causes and power-over themselves, the moral mediums of non-agential structures of reality, and thus [[others]] as well. 

//Agential power//, freedom, arises from environmental explanatory power; it is unique in that is requires more than explanation, but also justification in practice.<<ref "tt">> Denying the perspectival flatness of OOO, moral agents are privileged, mutable, free variables or objects in The Dialectic because their perspectives matter with respect to [[The Right]] in application. Our power-to bind and unbind ourselves to or with [[The Moral Law]] is the source of the power of our dignity.

At least for [[Dasein|Phenomenology]], explanatory power is the bottom-up beginning; the justification of agential power is the top-down end. Being in time, we agents probabilistically exercise our power in the computed middle. Agents are those with the actual power-to at least potentially choose to possess some actual power-tos in the future, including the power-to have power-over at least some power-to's. Agents can be atomic individuals or perhaps molecular collectives emerging from a set of agents. Hence, agential power is a power-over relationship between an agent distributed over some object(s) in a domain.<<ref "x">>

Thrown into the world, it is Dasein's [[fff]] plight to find and execute the "ought" given its models of what "is."<<ref "gf">> Autonomy is the ability to intend or actualize potential hypothetical imperatives, as well as the ability to explore, question, and judge whether or not hypothetical imperatives are categorical. Agential power is a power-over oneself as an instrument for the sake of some ends, and agential power is a power-to be moral, thus agential power ought to be used to be moral. Autonomy entails moral responsibility. Who will we be, what we will do, and why? 

//Political power// is reducible to the extended material identities of moral agents in relation to each other, i.e. political power is the power-over [[others]].<<ref "/b/">>
