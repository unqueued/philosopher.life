!! How Symmetrical is Kantian Respect for Humanity/Reason/Autonomy?

Do you mean my interpretation of historical Kant? Do you mean the scholastic consensus? Traditionalist or Neo-Kantian? What degree of Straussian interpretation do you accept or require?

To the extent an object or agent is "Rationally Autonomous," it deserves our respect. All other appearances of respect derive from respecting our own humanity/autonomy/etc.

Of course, "the extent," form the magic words and the reflective self-respect (as we give to dogs, etc.) can fill all symmetry gaps in practice (but not in maxim). I legitimately can't answer the question in any satisfactory way. I've yet to meet anyone who can.
