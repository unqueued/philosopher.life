!! Chapter 2

God damn, Carolyn is hot. Is her flirtation part of her superpower? What's her body language like? (I bet she's an incredible fuck). How many languages doesn't she speak? She isn't a master, so the author gets away with no having her speak language I known exist (and I'm including the GÃ¶dellian problems as well). To be the language God may ultimately require being the narrative God, which just is to say, she can transport herself into all Daseinic states/minds. She is everyone. Ah, I doubt the author can do this. This doesn't seem like the move most people would make.

I want a Makita drill.

Super powers are always a form of the Ring of Gyges, I remind you. With great power comes great responsibility.

Why does Carolyn not essentially have all the superpowers? 

I would love to know more about the noble guests. The ontology of this world is not easy for me to understand.

I still don't understand who Nobununga is.

!! Chapter 3

Ah, Carolyn doesn't understand Lisa's language. Author, explain yourself. No bullshit, please. Either she is a master or she isn't. 

The David-McGillicutty scene is outstanding. I laughed. I rarely laugh at anything now. What a strong scene.

I'm not sure I'm following this "force field" gate thing. 

Banished wanderers. Go into the desert. Zion is no longer your home. Your God has abandoned you.

Why can't they send regular humans into this place, past the force field?

I'm not sure I'm following these interludes.

Original Sin concept, ruh-roh, yogi.

OMG, OMG! Philosophical Zombies too!
