title: Ithkuil: Primer

Ithkuil means "hypothetical representation of a language." It began as an attempt to “consolidate” the most efficient morpho-phonological features and morpholological categories of various natural human languages into one single language.

Ithkuil is an idealized language whose aim is the highest possible degree of logic, efficiency, detail, and accuracy in cognitive expression via spoken human language, while minimizing the ambiguity, vagueness, illogic, redundancy, polysemy (multiple meanings) and overall arbitrariness that is seemingly ubiquitous in natural human language.

A sentence like “On the contrary, I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point” becomes simply “Tram-mļöi hhâsmařpţuktôx.”

Words in Ithkuil are assembled from individual atoms of meaning.

Ithkuil was designed to explore the limits of the number of cognitive categories a language can keep its speakers aware of at once.

* Lexicon
** The lexicon potentially consists of about 3,600 word roots (of which only about a thousand are implemented so far), each consisting of 2 or 3 consonants
** Any root may be changed by extremely complex rules of grammar that make it possible to create a large number of derivatives.

* Phonology
** Ithkuil uses a complicated phonological system (65 consonants and 17 vowels) based on sounds from a variety of languages such as Chechen or Abkhaz.
** It may be very difficult for a speaker of a typical western Indo-European language to pronounce some of the sounds.

* Morphophonology
** Ithkuil is primarily synthetic and secondarily agglutinative. 
** Ithkuil morphophonology utilizes both consonantal and vocalic mutation, shifts in syllabic stress and tone, and many different kinds of affixes, including prefixes, suffixes, infixes and interfixes.
