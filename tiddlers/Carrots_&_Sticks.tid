title: Carrots & Sticks

Condition->Carrot:

* Those who have finished schoolwork by 5pm will be guaranteed 1 hour of television watching.
* Those who have completed their schoolwork by 5pm each weekday for a week straight and possess zero school debt will have the right to control their work schedule for the following week, including breaks. This privilege is lost whenever you have failed to complete a single day's schoolwork and chores without external motivation.
* Those who have zero school time debt by 9:45 on Friday, you may stay up until midnight doing whatever you want.
* Those who have zero school time debt by Friday, may spend deep reading as free reading on Fridays (you still have to log your reading).
* You ask, and we feel like you deserve it: enjoy a snack besides a fruit or vegetable.
* You may have berries (as a dessert) after you've had any major piece of fruit.
* Those who have done their chores on time for a week straight earn their allowance for that week.


Condition->Stick:

* No breaks after 5pm. If you aren't done with your work by then, you've already spent all your breaks and then some.
* School work not completed will rollover as debt into Saturday, and if necessary, into the following week. Debt stays with you until you pay it off. You will keep a log of your "School Debt" (entitled as such).
* If they become distractions, your toys, objects, or art supplies are put into temporary storage until an appointed threshold has been met.
* If you become distracted by abstract things which cannot be taken from you, you owe us a 250-word or more (our discretion) log talking about them (in addition to your schoolwork).
* If you go back to sleep after your alarm clock or being woken, then you must go to goto sleep 1 hour earlier.
* If your chores are not finished by the end of the night, you will wake up one-hour earlier to complete them.
* If you are caught arguing or raising your voice for an unacceptable reason, you lose the right to make noise (outside of what is necessary for your work) for 15 minutes.
* If you physically strike or threaten it against any other designated animal in the house, you are required to apologize and silently stand in a non-interesting corner with zero visibility while shutting your eyes (meditate) for 15 minutes.
* Failure to answer your phone at any time results in being restricted to the parking lot in front of our door during the next outing.
* If you endanger yourself or others with some object or activity, even accidentally, you may lose the right to use or engage in it.
* If you leave trash out, then you must scrub the trash can, bathtub, or kitty litter box.
* Unless excused, if you are awake and not trying to sleep after 10pm, you will sleep on the floor instead of your bed.
