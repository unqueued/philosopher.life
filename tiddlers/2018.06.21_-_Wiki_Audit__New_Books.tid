I've been loving graphic novels. They are deeply antipleonasmic at times. They are never perfect, but sometimes they are a strong enough semblance that I can quickly race my way to a stronger semblance. It's what a good summary/intro should do.

I want to have a position on post-modernism. I need to be able to define it super clearly. 

Worked a bit on [[The Matrix]].

I've been reading a lot.

I think I've got the final draft (or close to it) of my Letter to R. My wife and I talked about it for quite a while, and she inspired me to continue. I will have her read and edit it. I do want to send it!
