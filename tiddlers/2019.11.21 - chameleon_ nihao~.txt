[3:47 PM] h0p3: It's been far too long since I interrupted your life with a message about nothing.
[3:48 PM] chameleon: nihao~
[3:48 PM] h0p3: I hope your day is going well and the hassles of life disappear into marital bliss.
[3:48 PM] chameleon: here I am, reading manga, watching a lindsay ellis video, haha
[3:48 PM] chameleon: hubby just went to work, but it was nice to wake up with him ^^
[3:49 PM] h0p3: Is his job going okay?
[3:49 PM] h0p3: And is your vehicle sitcheation looking better?
[3:51 PM] chameleon: he got the car back... only for the brakes to start being sketchy a few weeks later. so he's getting a ride to the garage now to pick it up
[3:51 PM] chameleon: his job is way better than the old one, he seems to be enjoying it at least
[3:52 PM] h0p3: Good.
[3:53 PM] chameleon: my parents said they'd pay for my lessons, so I'm probably gonna get a car too :smile:
[3:53 PM] h0p3: I can only assume it will take a year or so for everything to settle into place.
[3:53 PM] chameleon: how about you? besides stuff on the wiki. I noticed you left your job teaching?
[3:53 PM] h0p3: Noice. I'm sure you'll pick it up instantly.
[3:54 PM] chameleon: I hope the test is easier here, back home I failed... 5 times?
[3:54 PM] h0p3: Unfortunately, it is a necessary feature of autonomy in the US, I would argue.
[3:54 PM] h0p3: It's been 20 years for me. I doubt it has changed too much. Practice your parallel parking, and bring a very small car.
[3:55 PM] h0p3: If you have to borrow one, try to do that.
[3:55 PM] h0p3: I don't know the requirements for TN here (my daughter would begin driving with an adult in a year or so...which freaks me the fuck out a wee bit).
[3:56 PM] h0p3: I'm doing well enough. We're getting all prepped for moving and what not.
[3:56 PM] h0p3: I am going to miss my children. :frowning:
[3:56 PM] chameleon: oooh, exciting to move. that bit sucks tho :/
[3:56 PM] h0p3: It's weird to be happy to have the pain.
[3:57 PM] chameleon: that sounds kinda emo to me :wink:
[3:58 PM] h0p3: Haha. That might be right.
[3:58 PM] h0p3: I can say I hung with the emo kids to some degree growing up, as did my wife.
[3:59 PM] h0p3: I'm too autistic to do it appropriately, I assume.
[4:00 PM] h0p3: A lot of the emo-neity(?) seems to be shed by those I've known. It might just be a phase for some, I don't know. Some keep it though, it's more integrated into them.
[4:00 PM] chameleon: I had the straightened hair and old punk stuff, but I hung with weebs mostly. such was the way of my youth. lol
[4:01 PM] chameleon: I just kinda got back into it myself. i was a metalhead before that
[4:01 PM] chameleon: and a jazzer, lol
[4:01 PM] h0p3: Seems like one can be them all.
[4:02 PM] h0p3: Also, I'm lucky to have the chance to experience the music you point to. Thank you.
[4:02 PM] h0p3: I like how much variety you have.
[4:02 PM] chameleon: no problem! I like sharing. I'm sure we could talk for ages about music
[4:05 PM] h0p3: I am probably disappointing in the matter, lol. This is about where I am with music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2qezAF7edI

[4:07 PM] h0p3: Also, these Tennessee folx treating you right?
[4:08 PM] chameleon: yeah, I'm having a great time so far. they love the accent, haha
[4:09 PM] chameleon: I get treated much better back here than I did back home tbh
[4:09 PM] h0p3: Good.
[4:10 PM] h0p3: (err, in a sense)
[4:11 PM] chameleon: London is a very cold city in more ways than one
[4:12 PM] h0p3: Ha. I can imagine. Ridiculously expensive too, if I understand correctly.
[4:13 PM] h0p3: My rent is going to double in New Haven, but it should work out.
[4:13 PM] chameleon: yeah, hence living with my parents for so long :sweat_smile:
[4:14 PM] h0p3: I hope my offspring will live with me until they can't stand it (or hopefully that never occurs). Living the dream, I think it would be cool as hell for us to share a place, be on our computers together. Would feel so empty without them.
[4:15 PM] chameleon: I think my mother would definitely relate to that, she was apparently on facebook the other day talking about how quiet the house was, haha
[4:15 PM] chameleon: though, my siblings are already moved out
[4:15 PM] chameleon: well, at university
[4:22 PM] h0p3: So, I'm moving away in about a month. Still thinking about it, I was hoping to have the chance to see you in person, if you are up for it. It's a long a trek. Maybe we could meet halfway or whatever is convenient for you. It might be possible, and that's okay too.
[4:22 PM] chameleon: leaving TN?
[4:22 PM] chameleon: It depends, how easy is it for you to get to Nashville?
[4:23 PM] h0p3: It's 3 hours away, but my vehicle aint so hot either (202k miles on it).
