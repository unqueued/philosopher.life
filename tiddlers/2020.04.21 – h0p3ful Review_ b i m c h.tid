*[[Notage Ti.16]]
** Why have many Notages? Do you really want to burn an entire tiddler for a single sentence? 
*** Sometimes you should, but I don't see why this is one of those exceptional cases.
*[[Philosophuckery]]
** Amazing. Thank you for this.
** I am grateful that you recognize how there's a time and a place for this form of argumentation and inquiry. We have talked about it many times. You have a name for this kind of pedantry. Of course, it is not necessarily always a //mere// game, but you know that.
*[[Notage Ti.15]]
** What's a bimch?
*[[The Lightning Thief: 6, Draft 3]]
** Make sure to walk through this carefully with your mother. You are doing a good job of getting content down. We need to continue to work on your rhetoric and grammar. 
*** We can all tell you are pushing here, sir. Thank you. Your autistic linguistic muscles are going to be swole/ ripped.
*[[2020.04.20 – Wiki Review: Still laughing]]
** You often aren't commenting or even motioning to something thoughtful, it seems.
** Do you think it should be put into the Daily? 
*** What are your thoughts on how we construct our [[TTP]]s generally, and [[.tmpls]] more specifically? I thought I made a fine case for trying to atomize here.
*[[2020.04.20 – TDL: Philosophuckery]]
** No. This is unacceptable. Your goal is to try, even at trying to try. You know you aren't trying here, and it's not funny or reasonable.

** [[gfwiwcgws]]. It is not simply that it is neither, it seems to me. Surely, it can be good, and it can be bad in various circumstances (and given whatever ends you have in mind, including The Categorical, universal, unconditional, absolute, etc.). It depends on the context.
** Quite a bit rides on how we distinguish //addiction// from dependency. One might make the case that "controlled alcoholics" are functional to whatever average standard of flourishing we might require (and then it might be a matter of autonomy, though perfectionistic and utilitarian moral modelers can continue to push back).
** I'm glad you got your joke in there. If I were you, I'd change it to the [[title.Title]], homie. It would fit like a glove. 
*[[2020.04.20 – h0p3ful Review: Due Dates]]
** I'm grateful to see you jumping back into the [[CDR]]s here. Thank you.
*[[2020.04.20 – Carpe Diem: Crackers]]
** This is longer. Good. Keep it up, sir.
** Try integrating your mother's list into the [[CTS]] list itself. 
*** Give it a place in time if you can (and, if you need, give it a marker to help pick out the requirements you've met for your mother). 
** I'm enjoying the meems with you, homie. They are delicious.
** I like how you have a note for you mom in here too. Excellent.
*[[2020.04.20 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Oops, now I'm a skeptic]]
** I don't know what to call what this sort of rhetorical device is. You do it a lot. It does not belong everywhere. It's too cocky in a lot of contexts. It will tend to be wiser to hold back and walk through the matter point by point.
*** I adore your analysis. There are better ways to convey what you are arguing.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I am grateful that you never developed [[The Butter Zone]].
** One day, you may walk through the [[X-Section]] to clean up and reorganize, including tiddlers like [[2nd draft of Home]]. 
*** For now, I think the goal is to try to make new content relatively cleanly while still being completely willing to make messes. My opinion is that there are so few examples of what we are doing (in terms of depth and breadth) that we can't afford to be as rigid as we'd normally be in other kinds of better understood practices.
** I adore the smacktalk in [[2018.04.21 -- Wiki Log]].
