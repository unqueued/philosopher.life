[[k0sh3k]] is reading [[A History of Western Philosophy]]. She has disagreements about some of the ancient sections. We got into a significant debate, and the kids joined us. This took us down many paths. It was a rich discussion covering a broad number of disciplines; we continue to connect the dots of the historiographies, memetics, economics, genetics, and evolution of the species and [[The Great Human Conversation]]. I will show them the dialectic with passion and reason.

We discussed [[MTG]] and philosophy with major depth. [[The Dialectic]] was front and center. I'm very pleased to show the various incarnations of this notion to them. It will change how they understand everything.
