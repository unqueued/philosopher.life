title: 2017.05.18 - Pipefitting Log

People showed up late, as usual on Thursdays. Those who had computer testing went. Chris and I stayed to work on our project. We scrapped yesterday's work and started from the beginning with measurements. We quickly found out that we fucked up badly. The sides aren't plumb! The bottom distance is 184" and the top 185". I believe something went wrong in the mounting since the 3-4-5 came out very well on the jackstands. This is bad. We had to Pythagorean theorem to find our offsets, which were different on both sides! The flanges were close enough, within a 1/4" or less for each. At least the simulators are parallel to each other. We were kind of freaking out a bit. The teacher said not to worry about it multiple times. 

Eventually, I got copies of the isometric I drew up of just the simulators (since I don't want to have to measure again). We decided to slightly simplify our drawing to give us less to worry about. It's still complex enough for the teacher's requirements, I believe (although, it isn't what we sold him on). We went to him with our simulator's measurements isometric drawing, and he was completely unphased. He thought we were freaking out about nothing (he didn't really give us a chance to explain why we thought it was bad or what was really wrong though). So, that's that, I guess. We'll just push through. We did the math. We each found an error in the other's math today. I'm glad we double-check each other's work. 

We cut, beveled, and started fitting. Throughout the day, I kept going to see Dale, the welding teacher. I was meant to weld with him today. It wasn't until the day was over that I got to see him (I'll get to that later though). Anyways, we worked on this fabrication. It was tricky. First off, it's a very heavy 3" pipe. The vice bends with it. We have to compensate in the same direction with our levels throughout the fabrication for that. The Hi-Lo's were decent enough. It's clear that Chris strongly prefers me to tack, but I have to assert myself in getting the chance to do fitting as well. After all, I want to practice what I will likely spend the bulk of my time doing. The pipe was very rusty, and we didn't clean it (normally not necessary). We had many tacks break today (both of ours). Eventually, I started putting very large tacks with higher heat to guarantee penetration. 

My teacher and I talked about Keith. Keith is a serious shit-talker. I asked him about why we used Sockolets since Keith claims he wouldn't. Sockolets just made it easier. We didn't have to cut the pipe that way. Keith claims he could do the job in 6 hours. My teacher said Keith couldn't do it in 6 hours, especially without sockolets. My teacher said he could barely get it done in 6 hours himself. It took us much longer. Clearly, I have much to learn on these buttwelds. With time and practice, I hope to be able to fabricate as well as my teacher. 

My teacher talked about Nash falling behind. He was confused as to how Nash's scores didn't seem to have much consistency. I explained Nash's testing procedures, and that Nash takes snapshots of the test (which I think is bullshit). Without that, Nash doesn't do nearly as well. We also talked about the third book. We went to the office to see how much it costs them to pick up the 3rd and 4th book. They'll get back to us with the number. I hope to use the AB&T money on these books. Ultimately, I would like to pass the NCCER Journeyman test in addition to the Union tests. I want 'dem certs. 

At the end of the day, after cleaning up, I went to talk to Dale (as I said before). He was finally there and free enough. He had someone in his office, but he made sure to bring me in. I got to hear him talk to the other student. I assume this student was new because his work looked fucking terrible. His stringers looked terrible (although they were very shiny). He obviously was not consistent. But, to be fair, if I understand correctly, these were overhead. I'm sure this guy would run circles around me on my kind of work. I feel like I understood at least some of what he did wrong though. 

Another student came in after me, and I told him to speak with his student before me. He said we were both his students today, so I had priority (although, eventually he switched to hear the other student since it was clear that I would be there for a while). I explained that I didn't know what I was doing, and I wanted to make sure I was practicing correctly. Apparently, he knows a lot about me (my background, etc.). He decided to give me a quick tutorial. 

The reason my roots have been failing: I'm using wet (you are supposed to dry them) powder flux 7018 rods. I should be using 6010 rods, which are designed to cool off faster, lowering the chance of burning through. Basically, I've been using the wrong rods the entire time. This makes sense to me, since my filler passes are generally quite acceptable. My root is what sucks. I'm hoping this will make a huge difference. We walked through what the numbers meant, how to read schematics and other generalities. He said he'll find a used book for me to keep. I've read about welding, but now I'll probably have a much better understanding of it. 

I asked many questions (I can't help it; I'm psychologically dependent upon asking questions). He said it was fine to grind welds if I felt it was necessary. 

He told me to stop by tomorrow to do a weld with him. I will do that (assuming I can; I'll have to ask my teacher). I also told him that my teacher was canceling class, and I asked if I could join him during that time off. He said that while all the booths already have a student, he generally has at least one student per day who is absent. Thus, he believes he will have room for me. I thank him and told him I would be grateful for the opportunity. I really hope to make the most of this time. There is a 2-year waiting list to get into his class (and he produces the best welders in the state). It's a real opportunity to be able to walk in a learn from him.

It would be amazing to learn to TIG weld as well. In time, I would like to be able to pass the welder cert tests. A certified pipefitter + welder has options.
