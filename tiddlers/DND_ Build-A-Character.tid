title: DND: Build-A-Character

!! Build-A-Character:

Use your imagination to make your own class.

* Choose 5 abilities of any combination from the following //Ability Types//:
** //At-Will Type// -- standard activated, casted, spammable, auto-attack, and bread'n'butter
** //Daily Type// -- absurdly long CD, save the day, turn-the-tide of the battle, and game-changing
** //Conditional Type// -- triggered upon some event or requires a sacrifice/reagent
** //Innate Type// -- always-on, aura, passive, background, and synergy

* Choose your appearance
** Size matters.<<ref "1">>
** What kind of impression do you make?

* Choose 5 non-magical items and 1 magical item you are bringing with you.
** Assume you already have a satchel/travelbag, a container for water, and some food. Choose 5 more non-magical and 1 magical.
** No cheaty-faced "toolboxes" or "all-in-one" kits. Avoid stacks of items. Be narrow and specific.

* Choose 3 significant weaknesses for your character
** Don't make a character invincible. That's boring. Give yourself a challenge!
** This is a wonderful place to provide flavor and narrative to your character. Make it memorable.
** It is better to broadly and absurdly handicap yourself than make yourself overpowered.

The group and the DM have to agree to your character.<<ref "1">> If you are worried, have other characters or options available. Be flexible.
