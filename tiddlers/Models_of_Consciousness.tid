** I think the fastmind is always the first and last step, in both inputs and outputs. It gives shapes before we can be aware of it and after. The experiencer, Dasein, seems to be an emergence of the fastmind and slowmind. Many inputs are something Dasein attends to, but most aren't. These are filtered by the fastmind, shaped, etc. Dasein very well may be a continuum of sensual perceptions all the way the up to model(ic?) perceptions. Dasein seems largely based on the fastmind. I think the model of this author is meant to make him feel more real than he is.
