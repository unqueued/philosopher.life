title: 2017.12.07 - Prompted Introspection Log: Injured Animal

!! What would you do if you found an injured animal in the street?

Depends on the context. Is the universe going to implode if I stop to help, or is my child dying and I'm running them to the hospital? Fuck that animal, human or otherwise. I have my priorities. Is that what you are looking for Samwise? Good. I will empathize or otherwise, whatever is necessary.

I suppose it depends on the animal in question, how injured, what's available to me, how much it costs me to stop, what I think I ought to do in the situation, etc. A tiny salamander that lost its tail? What about a white elephant being tortured? Don't you see how broad and greyifying this question is? The morally salient features of a context have to be picked out. 

I'm not saying these aren't definable rules. Codification is by definition theoretically possible. I can say, however, that I can't give a great generalization to you in this space.
