title: Interview Stories

Have examples at the ready. You are selling yourself through stories: situation, reasoning for behavior, outcome.

* A story about how you handled a problem at work
** //One my last job at Eastman, I was bouncing between two projects that day. One was an intricate 100ft structure about 30 feet off the ground that kind of reminded me of a messy spiderweb. We were using 4" pipe that was fabbed and shipped to us. Lots of 90's and 45's, but we had more unique angles. The ISOs for these spools were fairly difficult to read. Something didn't feel right about it, so I went back to the drawings, and I found the flaw. It took me 3 tries to kindly convince the journeyman in charge of that job that we these spools were not assembled correctly. I jumped in, disassembled and reassembled it with them, and torqued it to specification just in time for QA.//
* A story about what you did when something went terribly wrong
** 
* A story about a time you demonstrated leadership or initiative
** //My last jobsite in Eastman was around 500-by-500 yards of industrial buildings. We were installing a fairly complex set of pipes ranging up to 42" in size. The contractor that got this job had very little time to put together a decent set of drawings and coordinates. We had 39 tie-in points across these buildings, ranging from underground to 6 stories up. We were all having a hard time navigating the jobsite, so I sat down and drew map that matched our ISOs. It made it easy to print and give to everyone and helped onboard newcomers.// 
* A story about a time you helped someone succeed
** //One of my co-workers was tasked with installing an improvised piping system. It turned out that it wouldn't be safe to hang the pipe as he was initially told to do. He talked to me about it, and I made fabricated saddles and supports from steel plate and extra pipe we had.//
* A story about a time you failed
** 
* A story about a time you set a goal for yourself
** //I set a goal to start recording what I do, what I see, and what I'm thinking about. This gives me a chance to reflect and solve problems. Sometimes, just talking about the problem with myself on paper helps me solve it. I've dutifully kept my notebook and typed up the notes every day.//
* A story about a time you dealt with a difficult co-worker
** //I once worked with this fella' named "Bear." He was an iron-worker who hated pipefitters and especially newer fitters; I think he was upset by not having been made foreman for so long. He did everything he could to make life hard on us. I ended up baking brownies with my daughter to give to the crew, but especially to Bear. I wanted him to know I wasn't his enemy. His wife, who worked firewatch, saw this as well. I think must have talked to him about it because after that, Bear was a lot nicer to us.//
