title: 2018.11.09 - Self-Dialectic: Dated vs Undated

Dated vs Undated (in title) material is a big divide in this wiki. Some projects are meant to last, and some only valuable in virtue of what they contribute to that which lasts. I think this is dialectical. This is what Parfit's talking about. 

This reminds me very much of [[/b/]] vs {[[About]]} as well. Yes, perhaps there is a calculus answer to worry about here, but it's probably more difficult than that.

I must weigh the local present against global lifetime. Of course, who is the "I" in such a thing? I cannot resolve that problem well enough. Does it matter that I can't resolve it? In some respects, yes. The task does feel impossible.

I'd like to point out that [[Self-Dialectic]] transclusions are result of doing [[Audit]] work initially. When I realize I'm doing long-term theoretical work or something that isn't praxis exactly, that's where I put it. [[Self-Dialectic]] is the theory to [[Wiki Audit]] as practice? Maybe. I think I do it messily though.
