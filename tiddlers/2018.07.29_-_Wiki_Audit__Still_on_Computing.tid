title: 2018.07.29 - Wiki Audit: Still on Computing

I got [[Computing]] only partially revamped. I need to continue shaping it. //About:// is looking good, but the organization of //Focus:// needs far more work and forethought.

Part of the running issue with [[Computing]] is just how fucking sprawling and integrated into everything it can be. So many things really do belong there.
