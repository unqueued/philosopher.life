TUE 7:09 PM
Evening mowing session, then dishes
TUE 8:01 PM
May your weedeating be smooth.
TUE 8:02 PM
How was your day?
WED 9:20 PM
Pretty terrible tennis elbow at work today
WED 9:49 PM
=(
WED 9:49 PM
I'm sorry.
WED 9:49 PM
But it rained, so they probably got 4 hours of work out of us
WED 9:49 PM
Noice.
WED 9:49 PM
Then did rehab again, which was gud
WED 9:49 PM
Love saying I'm in rehab
WED 9:50 PM
I'm glad that it is working so well for you too.
WED 9:50 PM
Then went to see Tom Segura
WED 9:50 PM
Laughed a lot, was a good show
WED 9:50 PM
Neat.
WED 9:51 PM
Did Rebecca go too?
WED 9:51 PM
Yep
WED 9:51 PM
We see tom segura for me, see Hamilton for her.
WED 9:51 PM
So
WED 9:52 PM
July 5th is a friday
WED 9:52 PM
Thinking I will pick up the killers on the 6th
WED 9:53 PM
Kidlets
WED 9:53 PM
Lol!
WED 9:53 PM
Lol
WED 9:53 PM
They are excited. It will be a good memory for them.
WED 9:54 PM
Kidlets isn't a word
WED 9:54 PM
So 6th is pick up, then I'll take off the 8th-12th, if they wanna stay another week we can figure it out then
WED 9:55 PM
I'll start hiding my porn now
WED 9:55 PM
Sounds excellent.
WED 9:55 PM
Lol.
WED 9:55 PM
Does that work lol?
WED 9:57 PM
It does not, but I will do it for you, lol.
WED 9:57 PM
Lol, thx
WED 9:57 PM
I started hitting venture brothers again
WED 9:58 PM
Yay!
WED 9:58 PM
I'm working my way through it again too.
WED 9:58 PM
Damn, took almost to the end of the first season to remember why I liked it
WED 9:58 PM
That is some persistence. I think the first season isn't the best though, so it should get better. Tons of character development.
WED 9:59 PM
I think the trial of the monarch and his time in prison, especially the pretty fucked up rape jokes, really got me back on board
WED 9:59 PM
lol
WED 9:59 PM
Yeah, they stop just introducing more and more characters and actually flesh out the ones they already had
WED 10:00 PM
Aye! Also, that Circe book has way more rape in it that I anticipated, and it's since there's no danger to her person; it's only pain and power.
WED 10:01 PM
Interesting book.
WED 10:01 PM
Lol
WED 10:01 PM
More fancy than I'm used to reading, I think.
WED 10:01 PM
Not a great time to laugh sorry
WED 10:01 PM
lol
WED 10:01 PM
Aunty [[AA]] was telling me that you resemble Halpert in The Office.
WED 10:01 PM
Or, they have been debating it.
WED 10:02 PM
I said you looking nothing like him, but there are similarities in your personalities, imho.
WED 10:02 PM
But I just took a long time trying to remember what book your talking about, cause you pronounced it like GoT over the phone
WED 10:02 PM
Oh, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it correctly.
WED 10:02 PM
Looks like both ways works
WED 10:03 PM
I think it has to be sir-see like you said
WED 10:03 PM
Rolls off the tongue better that way.
WED 10:03 PM
Although, the actress from ladybird has a totally fucked up first name pronunciation/spelling
WED 10:04 PM
Saoirse Ronan, pronounced Sertia, like inertia.
WED 10:06 PM
I will never understand the human beings around me.
WED 10:06 PM
Also, if you are in for a weird movie (like that Mario Brothers movie, or The Fifth Element, or any of those wack neon 90's dystopia films): The Zero Theorem (2013).
WED 10:06 PM
I can't say if it is good or bad. It's weird though.
WED 10:07 PM
Yeah, I remember downloading that a long while ago, giving it a browse and not really trying it
WED 10:08 PM
Got a real eraserhead vibe
WED 10:08 PM
Yeah, it has some corny insanity to it.
WED 10:08 PM
It kinda works though.
WED 10:08 PM
Like dark city but more dumb
WED 10:08 PM
Ha
WED 10:09 PM
I want [[k0sh3k]] to read that
WED 10:09 PM
Yeah, definitely in the experience machine territory.
WED 10:09 PM
She will.
WED 10:09 PM
Yeah, if that movie had come out 2 years earlier, more people would remember it
WED 10:10 PM
yup
WED 10:10 PM
Matrix was so much more visually impressive, kinda drowned it out
WED 10:10 PM
It's hard to defeat the best movie of all time.
WED 10:10 PM
Hah
WED 10:10 PM
Gorgeous inside and out.
WED 10:11 PM
Someone at work once said, "ooooof course [[JRE]] would think the matrix  is the best movie ever..."
WED 10:11 PM
I do not understand people who don't like the movie.
WED 10:11 PM
Lol
WED 10:11 PM
The same lady, today, said that she resents how much my comments make her think during our lunch breaks
WED 10:12 PM
It was only partially a joke
WED 10:13 PM
You are costing her brain power. Like a vampire, she despises that you intrude on your time, energy, and Hegelian identity. What gives you the right?
WED 10:13 PM
You fiend, you.
WED 10:13 PM
Lol
WED 10:13 PM
She said today that sometimes when everyone is throwing ideas around about how to accomplish something, she just shuts down.  I told her that she is going to be a journeyman in a few weeks, that when she has a good idea, she needs to speak up.
WED 10:14 PM
Yes. I'm glad you did.
WED 10:15 PM
She probably doesn't receive much encouragement.
WED 10:15 PM
She was like, "whoa, are you just fucking with me, or did you actually just say I have good ideas"
WED 10:15 PM
And I couldn't help myself
WED 10:15 PM
You troll.
WED 10:16 PM
And said, "no, I'm saying IF you have a good idea, you need to actually voice them.  Not that you generally do have good ideas"
WED 10:16 PM
lol
WED 10:16 PM
Then I told her I was just fucking with her and that of course she has good ideas, and not to let people steamroll her
WED 10:17 PM
And then I pointed out how hurtful it was of her to act so surprised that i could say something nice
WED 10:17 PM
Lol!
WED 10:17 PM
Cry myself to sleep
WED 10:17 PM
That is outstanding.
WED 10:17 PM
Wish I could be your apprentice and watch it unfold.
WED 10:18 PM
Gotta hit that hay
WED 10:19 PM
Sleep well!
WED 10:19 PM
Love you. =)
WED 10:19 PM
You too, love yah
WED 10:20 PM
