title: 2019.03.06 - Prompted Introspection: Unusual Ride

!! Recall an unusual bus, train, or plane ride.

I think the plane ride to Thailand was the most unusual I've ever had. My son was 3 months old, my daughter 2, and my wife barely functioning. We had packed everything into ten suitcases and took our first international trip. Oh, and I had a vasectomy, but the night before we left required me to go to the hospital. Vicodin didn't even touch the pain.

It was the most arduous trip of my life: many hours of flying and layovers, sleep deprived, depressed, caring for a newborn and toddler, icepack to my ballsack, drugged, all the money we owned in our pockets, few possessions, on the way to a powerful experience in our lives. It was fucking insane. I have no idea how we did it. I don't have the energy for it anymore. 

Tangentially, //The Poisonwood Bible// was a powerful experience for me as well.

P.S. [[2017.11.17 - Prompted Introspection Log: Unusual Ride]] includes it. Oh, I can feel my memory slipping here too.
