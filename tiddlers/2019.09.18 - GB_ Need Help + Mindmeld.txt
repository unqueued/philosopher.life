I need your help man
SEP 18 5:06 PM
hey, what's up!
SEP 18 7:15 PM
Sorry, I've been sick today. Just saw this message.
SEP 18 7:15 PM
No worries ma
SEP 18 7:17 PM
Man
SEP 18 7:17 PM
Cold?
SEP 18 7:18 PM
No idea. Stomach and head have been garbage. Didn't sleep well last night.
SEP 18 7:18 PM
What you been up to today?
SEP 18 7:19 PM
That sucks man. Maybe food poisoning?
SEP 18 7:23 PM
No, lol. Thank goodness. Food poisoning is a very special time for me. TMI eyebleach warning, ignore at will. The last two times I had it, I've been in so much pain I started blacking out. The best answer I've found is to lay belly down naked on the bathroom floor waiting for the end, eventually shitting myself in painful relief. None of that today.
SEP 18 7:28 PM
Damn dude that is dark lol
SEP 18 7:31 PM
I've never had food poisoning nearly that bad
SEP 18 7:31 PM
How do you feel about the security of this app?
SEP 18 7:41 PM
This is a well-understood and tested application written designed by an actual hacker. In terms of privacy, this is the best application out of the box I've found which works with almost zero knowledge of the topic (and I am not an expert).
SEP 18 7:44 PM
You're way more of an expert than me lol
SEP 18 7:46 PM
I do not like the centralized infrastructure, and I think they purposely do not make it easy to functionally interact with this software when they should. There is some silo-age I don't like about it as well. They also treat your phone number as your identity.
SEP 18 7:46 PM
But content is pretty secure even if maybe there's some slippage with metadata?
SEP 18 7:48 PM
This is a pragmatic tool, and the most convenient compromise I've found for everyday people. I can ask people who know much, much less than either of us to download this app, and we immediate gain significant security without too much hassle or sacrifice.
SEP 18 7:48 PM
Yes, I trust my life to this software.
SEP 18 7:48 PM
Ok well I trust your judgment. You know I know shit about internet security. I know what end-to-end decryption means but that's about the extent. Anything technical is beyond me
SEP 18 7:49 PM
So I have a project that I'd like to ask you to help me with because I'm way, way out of my element with it. But I would understand completely if you're not comfortable with it (and I expect you won't be because you're a good person, unlike me lol)
SEP 18 8:22 PM
rofl. I doubt that I'm better than you, but I'm happy to help.
SEP 18 8:23 PM
I'm going to sound like a child saying words they don't understand, but I'd like to [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:28 PM
Presumably, you'll want to [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:30 PM
Can you [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:30 PM
Yes. I know what I want to be able to do and it's very straightforward
SEP 18 8:31 PM
No
SEP 18 8:31 PM
The lowest hanging fruit method is getting [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:32 PM
It's possible you might be able to avoid even needing to [[REDACTED]], depending on the goal.
SEP 18 8:33 PM
It's much easier to deal with [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:35 PM
It's a [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:36 PM
I have no idea how any if this works so I'm not sure [[REDACTED]]. If possible, I'd prefer not to [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:37 PM
If [[REDACTED]], then you will have difficulty with [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 8:38 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:38 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:42 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:43 PM
They almost certainly do, but I highly doubt [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:44 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:44 PM
I do not. I have not in decades.
SEP 18 8:46 PM
But, I work on the assumption I'm [[REDACTED]] to some degree*
SEP 18 8:46 PM
Yeah but you have other methods [[REDACTED]], I'm sure. I mean [[REDACTED]] like me
SEP 18 8:47 PM
I don't think I have any ways of [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:47 PM
The best I got in terms of [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:47 PM
How does [[REDACTED]] work?
SEP 18 8:48 PM
Are you going [[REDACTED]]?
SEP 18 8:48 PM
Btw I plan [[REDACTED]] as humanly possible. I'm going to [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:48 PM
+1 to [[REDACTED]] for, but you should not [[REDACTED]] with this at all.
SEP 18 8:49 PM
Neither really. I'll put it this way. I'm not really interested in [[REDACTED]]. I'm interested in [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:49 PM
Oh. Hmm. Well then I'll need yo find other ways to be [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:50 PM
Alright, so there is no way [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:50 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:51 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:51 PM
I'll need to read up on [[REDACTED]]. I'm familiar of course but [[REDACTED]] knowledge is nil
SEP 18 8:51 PM
That is the [[REDACTED]] I suggest.
SEP 18 8:51 PM
Ok
SEP 18 8:52 PM
It makes it reasonably [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:52 PM
Ok cool
SEP 18 8:52 PM
See this is why I needed yo ask you. I assumed [[REDACTED]] would be good
SEP 18 8:53 PM
So before I ask you anything else: especially given my lack [[REDACTED]], is this a stupid idea?
SEP 18 8:54 PM
Hm. I don't know? Do I think you are capable of [[REDACTED]]? Of course.
SEP 18 8:54 PM
I have no doubt you have a moral reason for [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:55 PM
I will say that you should go slowly.
SEP 18 8:55 PM
I think learning about [[REDACTED]] is invaluable in [[REDACTED]]. It's something we all have to learn and relearn. [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:56 PM
Do I think you should learn [[REDACTED]]? Yes.
SEP 18 8:57 PM
It might take you months to get where you want to be going.
SEP 18 8:58 PM
I won't say what I aim to do is [[REDACTED]]. In fact I'd like to make that completely clear for your sake right up front, in case you think you should take that under advisement in whether you want to help me
SEP 18 8:58 PM
I don't consider it unearned as far as [[REDACTED]]  goes. I'm just nor sure [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 8:59 PM
I also have to balance learning to do this with writing my dissertation lol
SEP 18 8:59 PM
I trust your judgment in the matter.
SEP 18 8:59 PM
Yeah, well, this might also take up a lot of time.
SEP 18 9:00 PM
No, it will take up a lot of time if you do [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:00 PM
Lol I figured. I guess I want to get a handle on what all this will require, in order to determine whether I want to move forward
SEP 18 9:00 PM
It is important to think about whether or not [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:02 PM
I don't think so. They would think (correctly) I'm not [[REDACTED]]. And without going into too much detail [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:03 PM
But I'm talking from [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:04 PM
Counting our chickens here, but I don't know if you want [[REDACTED]] (I would attempt to [[REDACTED]] as soon as possible). Depending on the result, if you think [[REDACTED]], you will also want [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:05 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:05 PM
No chances
SEP 18 9:06 PM
And it will be [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:07 PM
Hell I may even [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:08 PM
Up to you. I don't think you will need [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:09 PM
Depends how I feel lol. I want [[REDACTED]] with respect to [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:10 PM
I can appreciate that. I will offer a minor word of caution (since I have spiraled many times here). Imho, that is [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:12 PM
I hear you
SEP 18 9:13 PM
I tend to be [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:14 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:15 PM
I would like to [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:16 PM
You'll want to [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:17 PM
I'd have [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:17 PM
When [[REDACTED]], you can [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:18 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:19 PM
Well, [[REDACTED]]. Even if [[REDACTED]]. You'll need [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:20 PM
The exact [[REDACTED]]? I strongly [[REDACTED]] but I'm not positive
SEP 18 9:21 PM
Can you tell me [[REDACTED]] here, to [[REDACTED]], and what [[REDACTED]]? Just so I know what homework to start on
SEP 18 9:25 PM
I also think I'd want to [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:27 PM
I would [[REDACTED]] first. After you have [[REDACTED]]. There's a lot of different [[REDACTED]]. We'd probably [[REDACTED]], and hopefully you [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:27 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:28 PM
That observation [[REDACTED]]. You will [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:28 PM
Right. I mean before [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:28 PM
You want to [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:29 PM
Right. Don't mind me, I'm just an idiot lol
SEP 18 9:30 PM
So, if you don't want [[REDACTED]], you might [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:31 PM
Not my preferred option.
SEP 18 9:31 PM
We might also be able to [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:33 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:34 PM
Also, not my preferred option.
SEP 18 9:34 PM
There's also [[REDACTED]], but god damn, you must have an insanely good reason to do that.
SEP 18 9:37 PM
[[REDACTED]] is the best option given [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:38 PM
Lol if [[REDACTED]]. And no [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:38 PM
Why is [[REDACTED]] not the preferred option? I do know [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:39 PM
You have far more [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:40 PM
Even with [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:40 PM
And, you'll actually have to [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:40 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:41 PM
And, if you do go that way, [[REDACTED]] must.
SEP 18 9:41 PM
Well, you'd be [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:42 PM
[[REDACTED]] in every sense.
SEP 18 9:42 PM
Oh I thought you meant [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:43 PM
well, you could [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:43 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:44 PM
There's no way to [[REDACTED]]?
SEP 18 9:44 PM
What would you [[REDACTED]]? Lol
SEP 18 9:45 PM
That depends. I don't know enough [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:45 PM
[[REDACTED]] is a risk.
SEP 18 9:46 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:47 PM
And, it would enable [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:47 PM
So it sounds like [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:47 PM
Provided there are no [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:48 PM
I believe I could [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:48 PM
You'll [[REDACTED]]. Hopefully, [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:50 PM
I think this is [[REDACTED]] lmao
SEP 18 9:51 PM
If you couldn't [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:51 PM
Well, it would require a lot of dedication, and it might not be worthwhile.
SEP 18 9:52 PM
[[REDACTED]]? Imo this sounds [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:54 PM
[[REDACTED]] is simpler.
SEP 18 9:55 PM
Eventually, most people [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:55 PM
But it would involve 1) [[REDACTED]], and 2) [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:56 PM
[[REDACTED]]. That is doable though.
SEP 18 9:57 PM
[[REDACTED]] is less conditional too. [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 9:59 PM
What I like about [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 9:59 PM
Yes I like that too
SEP 18 10:01 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:01 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:06 PM
I suggest finding [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 10:07 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:07 PM
Ok
SEP 18 10:08 PM
Thanks for your help and advice man
SEP 18 10:09 PM
np, let me know if I can be of any use
SEP 18 10:09 PM
I don't know my ass from a hole in the ground
SEP 18 10:11 PM
Lol
SEP 18 10:11 PM
Rofl. I'm there with you. Life has been an insane whirlwind.
SEP 18 10:11 PM
I don't know. I should think about all this. It's [[REDACTED]], and I already have a lot on my plate lol
SEP 18 10:13 PM
I will say [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:14 PM
Well, I'm dying to know, lol.
SEP 18 10:15 PM
When you feel comfortable, one day, you'll have to let me know about this beautiful dream.
SEP 18 10:15 PM
I'm comfortable telling you, if you want to know. And if you don't approve then you can [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:18 PM
I mean I trust you man
SEP 18 10:18 PM
Well, I love [[REDACTED]]. I don't think [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 10:25 PM
I have no idea how you are feeling, but I think it's good to get it out, to reflect, to find something novel, and to connect. That seems to help give me hope.
SEP 18 10:28 PM
One random stranger I met online a year ago, kickscondor (https://philosopher.life/#kickscondor), has suffered loss beyond compare. I'd wager we've written 250 pages of letters with just him in the past year. He says he is after //fire//. I have my opinions about what this means, but I aim to be especially open to his point of view (even when I think he is radically wrong, I keep my ears peeled).
SEP 18 10:33 PM
There is [[REDACTED]]. The [[REDACTED]]. Essentially [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:36 PM
The nature of [[REDACTED]], honestly. It would [[REDACTED]]. Consideration [[REDACTED]], but [[REDACTED]] would have. Because [[REDACTED]], the [[REDACTED]]. It would [[REDACTED]], not least [[REDACTED]]. Nor [[REDACTED]], nor [[REDACTED]]. Beyond [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]]. That seems [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:41 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:42 PM
Lol.
SEP 18 10:42 PM
Because no [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:42 PM
Lol
SEP 18 10:42 PM
So you see [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:43 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:45 PM
From my standpoint, I'm just unable to [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 10:46 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:48 PM
Well considering [[REDACTED]], at significant [[REDACTED]], and then [[REDACTED]], and then [[REDACTED]], and considering [[REDACTED]], yeah [[REDACTED]] lol
SEP 18 10:50 PM
[[REDACTED]]. But [[REDACTED]], thus [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:52 PM
So I have to also say: [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:52 PM
The more I type the more [[REDACTED]] lol
SEP 18 10:52 PM
But [[REDACTED]], and [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:54 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:54 PM
I know, [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:56 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:56 PM
Naw, I don't think [[REDACTED]]. I think you are in unimaginable pain.
SEP 18 10:57 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:57 PM
Why would [[REDACTED]]?
SEP 18 10:58 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:58 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:59 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 10:59 PM
[[REDACTED]]. That shit sucks.
SEP 18 10:59 PM
But not in a way that would help over many months
SEP 18 11:00 PM
Were you? You never told me that
SEP 18 11:00 PM
Ah, yeah. That has been part of my systemic breakdown. Coming to terms with it.
SEP 18 11:01 PM
You know my wiki started out as a letter to my donors?
SEP 18 11:02 PM
Since then, it has grown to the size of 60 100k-word books in length. It's been an important tool for revealing who they are to everyone in my family. [[REDACTED]]
SEP 18 11:03 PM
Your donors?
SEP 18 11:03 PM
It didn't start out as one, but the transparency has given me a chance for vindication, and I hope restoration for the parties who merit it, to whatever extent I can.
SEP 18 11:04 PM
My biological donors. My mother and father.
SEP 18 11:04 PM
Here's the last letter I wrote: https://philosopher.life/#2019.04.13%20-%20SLT%3A%20TOU2
I didn't know you were adopted man
SEP 18 11:06 PM
Oh, I wasn't.
SEP 18 11:06 PM
Just a term I use to frame what they really are.
SEP 18 11:06 PM
So the narcissists are your donors?  Not your parents?
SEP 18 11:07 PM
Oh I see
SEP 18 11:07 PM
Was it that bad? You never really told me about your parents, other than that they were religious
SEP 18 11:08 PM
I think they are more psychopathic and narcissistic on the dark-triad spectrum.
SEP 18 11:08 PM
Jesus
SEP 18 11:08 PM
You know, when you are at the zoo for long enough, you can't smell the shit anymore.
SEP 18 11:08 PM
Mine NPD isn't dark triad. And she's done immeasurable damage to me in 5 years. I can't imagine what a dark triad over the course of many more years, childhood years no less, could do
SEP 18 11:09 PM
True. Especially if you were born in the zoo
SEP 18 11:09 PM
Is this where your depression stems from?
SEP 18 11:12 PM
I can't imagine that at all. All things considered I've lived a pretty charmed fucking privileged life
SEP 18 11:12 PM
I've suffered from depression since I was young. Do I think their dark-triadicism is the source of my depression? I think my depression is overdetermined. Even with better circumstances, I would likely suffer from depression, even if only depressive realism.
SEP 18 11:14 PM
It didn't happen all once, but the straw that broke the camel's back was having my brother leave my house.
SEP 18 11:15 PM
My youngest brother, AIR, is gay (heavily persecuted for it in our family), schizophrenic, alcoholic, and homeless.
SEP 18 11:16 PM
Thinking about his life (they didn't teach him to read until he was 13), how they've manipulated the people around them, recognizing that much of my life has been a lie, seeing his suffering, it just pushed me over the edge into a spiral.
SEP 18 11:17 PM
Realizing that my pursuit of academic philosophy was to find answers to the brainwashing I received was painful. My story doesn't have a place there, and it felt like such a tremendous loss of purpose and time. My perfectionism is dangerous to my survival.
SEP 18 11:18 PM
I lost belief in objective meaning, purposely aimed to have no purpose, to deny it all. Paul Tillich is right about faith. It's that thing you can be tortured to death and still you can't unsee it.
SEP 18 11:20 PM
It's been a painstaking climb back up (with lots of falls down so far).
SEP 18 11:21 PM
Coming to grips with being a high-functioning autistic person was part of it too. One of my professors at Tulane talked with me about it. I didn't even know until we started looking at it. It's helped me become a better dad to my son as well.
SEP 18 11:22 PM
That's part of what the wiki has done for me. It's help me pickup the pieces and weave together a story of who I am that I don't hate so much.
SEP 18 11:23 PM
Anyway, I'm rambling, lol!
SEP 18 11:24 PM
A few thoughts on what you said, I think you use what privilege you've had to pursue what matter most in a sufficiently reasonable fashion. To my knowledge, I think you are a gem compared to most people who have a background like yours. I admire what you've done with what you've had.
SEP 18 11:26 PM
Sorry I was taking a shower. Give me one minute. You're not rambling, god knows I've been
SEP 18 11:27 PM
Also, [[REDACTED]], but 3 months from now, I don't know. You know your reasoning and feelings far more than I ever could. Part of my doubt is that I don't think you are certain enough about [[REDACTED]] in the picture. As much as [[REDACTED]], this one [[REDACTED]].
SEP 18 11:28 PM
Jesus that's heavy. Is your brother still homeless? I think most people's depression is over determines. Mine is mostly a puzzle to me since I had a really good and stable childhood, so far as I remember. Though I do have vague suspicions something may have happened that no one knows about. But in general I have to chalk it up to what Hume called the disease of the learned. The whole kinda sucks. And even worse it kind of always has. It's never been great. It's just a giant meat grinder. It's pretty hard to come face to face with that, and it's taken me stages. I was pretty naive for a long time
SEP 18 11:32 PM
I suspected you were high functioning autistic, tbh. But very high functioning. You're one of the smartest people I've ever met
SEP 18 11:33 PM
The whole world* kind of sucks
SEP 18 11:33 PM
I think the wiki is a brilliant thing for you. I'm not a huge fan of Dennett but he's definitely right that we rely on narratives about ourselves (though I tend to be less skeptical of those narratives than he is). I think what's helped me a lot through this is adjusting my narrative to make this fit in it. I still haven't fully accomplished that so I have a unified outlook on it. But I think its critical to try to integrate it into the story you tell yourself about yourself, and find meaning and purpose in that. So I think the fact that you're doing this wiki is exactly what you should be doing
SEP 18 11:35 PM
But I think most important of all is what I said to you last night. If it ever gets too dark, and this may sound corny and kind of traditional and obvious, but it's your family man. The solution to your whole life is right there.
SEP 18 11:36 PM
My brother does not speak with any of us (or any people from his first couple decades). He came to live with us twice, but it didn't work for him. It's been heartbreaking to see him try to make it on his own. The world is an unkind place for him. I don't blame him at all. To my knowledge, he lost his job as a chef (he's talented), and he's at risk of being homeless again. He doesn't return any of messages or calls, so I wait to hear back from him.
SEP 18 11:40 PM
Disease of the learned is on the money!
SEP 18 11:40 PM
And yes [[REDACTED]], though it's not the only reason I hesitate. I wasn't a great [[REDACTED]]. I didn't want [[REDACTED]] until I realized I did, and it was too late. I still don't, really. I just want to be [[REDACTED]] and to redeem myself for not being [[REDACTED]] as I should have been. I feel really guilty about it. And I don't know whether [[REDACTED]]. It makes me sick to [[REDACTED]]. But at the same time obviously I don't want that
SEP 18 11:41 PM
Why doesn't he get along with you?
SEP 18 11:42 PM
I don't know why. We were doing great, I thought. But, he vanished from everyone's lives. I can't intrude too far. He may have a good reason I just can't understand.
SEP 18 11:44 PM
Or he may just have trouble coping and self-sabotages
SEP 18 11:48 PM
Have you seen Annihilation?
SEP 18 11:48 PM
Yes, he does sabotage himself.
SEP 18 11:48 PM
It's so painful.
SEP 18 11:48 PM
I don't know your dynamic, so take this with a giant mountain of salt l. And I also think this is very presumptive to say, but he may just need someone to not stop reaching out
SEP 18 11:49 PM
That may be right. Maybe it is time to start trying again.
SEP 18 11:50 PM
I bring up Annihilation  because it's a good movie and I watched it at a time when I was prone to really digesting its message, about how powerful self-destruction can be. The death drive is real
SEP 18 11:50 PM
When my daily calls and messages go unanswered for months, when I call from another line and he hears my voice and drops the call immediately, at least part of him definitely doesn't want to connect. But, I am his brother, and he needs to know I've not given up on him.
SEP 18 11:51 PM
I think Anaximander was right. Yes, maybe there is a will to life or a will to power but at our core I think we all know our very existence is an injustice and maybe it was better when there was nothing
SEP 18 11:51 PM
God damn, lol!
SEP 18 11:52 PM
Yes, I think it's possible (again without knowing him) he may need to know that
SEP 18 11:52 PM
Yeah I have a nihilistic side. I try not to let it out too much. Or feed it too much. It's not my predominant disposition
SEP 18 11:52 PM
Yeah, we've talked about that. I also want to make sure my darkness is useful to him.
SEP 18 11:52 PM
How so?
SEP 18 11:53 PM
Well, some people feel less alone when they speak with me, and others are horrified by my view of the world. Taking me seriously causes them to lose hope.
SEP 18 11:54 PM
I can't say I'm rational enough where my brother is concerned.
SEP 18 11:56 PM
I have seen the movie, and I've read that book. It's way outside my bailiwick, lol. I don't have the verbal skill that you have. My wife ended up writing to VanderMeer, and he said the meaning we drew out of it was interesting, but he didn't mean anything by it. That death drive does seem to be a powerful force.
SEP 18 11:58 PM
I hear ya on the giant meat grinder. I've been coming to understand it in stages as well.
SEP 19 12:00 AM
I am not a fan of Dennett either. He forces me to look at the skeptic's position.
SEP 19 12:02 AM
I try not to talk to non-philosophers about my view of the world
SEP 19 12:02 AM
They don't understand. They're programmed by ideology not to. That sounds like crazy shit but my God its true. We live in not the only but indeed the most totalizing, and dangerous, ideology in history
SEP 19 12:03 AM
The funny thing is my philosophical project is all about optimisn
SEP 19 12:04 AM
Optimism
SEP 19 12:04 AM
I don't think that's crazy at all.
SEP 19 12:04 AM
It's like the one part of me flailing to put myself back on track of thinking this is all worthwhile
SEP 19 12:05 AM
rofl
SEP 19 12:05 AM
(sometimes I laugh because it's absurd, I'm taking you very seriously, obviously)
SEP 19 12:06 AM
What was the interpretation you wrote to him about? I haven't read the book but the movie seems pretty clearly to me about trying to reconcile oneself to a certain kind of beauty in nihilism. On most days I'm not in sync with that sort of thing and push against it
SEP 19 12:06 AM
What's absurd? Lol
SEP 19 12:06 AM
The flailing image.
SEP 19 12:06 AM
It's been many years, but the last book has a scene toward the end which reminds us of the story of Paul. I don't remember it well enough to walk it down. I'd have to read again. The books were haunting, weird, and a puzzle. It's way above my paygrade though, lol.
SEP 19 12:08 AM
I've come to realize more and more my work is about affirming a kind of optimism, and in many ways using Hegel and Heidegger and Marx to do it. I think the revolutionary sentiment may be the last possible hope for trying to imagine a better world. Something our ancestors were able to do but we are increasingly incapable of doing (I'm being very Heideggerian right now...and also very Marxist lol...they're so fucking close and yet no one has ever fulfilled Marcuse's dream of a Heideggerian Marxism. That's what I'm going to do)
SEP 19 12:08 AM
Fuck yeah.
SEP 19 12:08 AM
Even it were corny, it's correct. That's part of why I'm going all out on this wiki project. I'm shooting for something almost insane because I believe the pursuit of revolution is the only chance my offspring have for living a good life.
SEP 19 12:17 AM
No lol my dissertation is about semantics and ontology. Through a Hegelian reading of Heidegger (it's far more analytic than it sounds). But it's in service of a realist outlook about meaning, one that also identifies a place for human being in the advent of that meaning and so let's us rethinking our place in and relation to the world. Through that I see myself as developing developing the framework for a Heideggerian Marxism, and charting a kind of theoretical course for Marxism as revolutionary, somewhat humanistic, ecologically sound, and hopeful
SEP 19 12:20 AM
A lot of that won't be explicit lol. I won't ever say I'm trying to build a philosophy of optimism for example. I just hope it comes across. I think it will
SEP 19 12:21 AM
Revelation through the inspection of the self is what it's all about isn't it?
SEP 19 12:22 AM
That is how it works. =)
SEP 19 12:22 AM
It sounds really fucking ambitious I know. It is. But I think I am pulling it off, at least at the macro level
SEP 19 12:23 AM
My actual writing I'm not so sure about
SEP 19 12:23 AM
Well, maybe the dissertation is doorway for the framework.
SEP 19 12:23 AM
It definitely is
SEP 19 12:23 AM
In my conclusion I put all my cards on the table and link what I've said to Marxism
SEP 19 12:24 AM
I'm straight up going to take on the Marcusian mantle and declare that that's what I'm going to do, chart the way to a Heideggeriqn Marxism. And honestly I do genuinely believe that's our only hope
SEP 19 12:24 AM
(It's a very Hegelian Heideggerin Marxism btw. But I see Hegel as closer to Marx than a lot of Marxists)
SEP 19 12:25 AM
Sorry I'm going on now. I've had a couple now so I ramble
SEP 19 12:26 AM
Oh, no, I want to understand.
SEP 19 12:26 AM
So, you know I don't understand Heidegger, Hegel, and Marx nearly as as well as you do (though I try). You have my attention with the concept of Heideggerian Marxism.
SEP 19 12:27 AM
You are going to have forgive my ignorance and my arrogance again and again.
SEP 19 12:28 AM
I don't know what is meant by Heideggerian Marxism. To my eyes, they are two totally different topics (though obviously connected by a ton of branches), and there's no reason to think they aren't compatible. But, I'm probably not one who aims to maintain historical accounts of these philosophers, but charitably reconstruct an understanding of their ideas.
SEP 19 12:30 AM
"The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary." -- I feel that way in philosophy too.
SEP 19 12:32 AM
I'm a Platonist, so when I try to charitably read Marx, I feel like he's kicking ass in describing something which occurs in physics, and the question of metaphysics is left open for me. I agree that Hegel and Marx are much closer than some of the Marxists I've met; if I understand correctly, Hegel has been general enough to talk about the beginning and end in a way that just isn't as practical or interesting to Marx.
SEP 19 12:37 AM
This reminds me of "What Do Philosophers Believe?" https://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP
SEP 19 12:43 AM
So, I'm coming at it probably from the wrong direction.
SEP 19 12:47 AM
But, I'm in agreement that a marriage between Heideggerian thought and Marxism is necessary to an effective revolution. I'll be interested to see how you take up the Marcusian mantle.
SEP 19 12:49 AM
It reminds me of trying to put theory into practice.
SEP 19 12:51 AM
Well the question is precisely how they're related. In my diss I basically extract from the theory of meaning I get from Heidegger that he has an account of "ontological labor" that for various reasons is only intelligible in terms of actual material labor (a kind of pragamatsim). So the two are dialdxtically intertwined for Heidegger
SEP 19 12:33 AM
Dialectically
SEP 19 12:34 AM
Do your professors sympathize with a realist interpretation of Heidegger?
SEP 19 12:54 AM
Sorry for getting on a tangent about my diss. Not sure how that even started
SEP 19 12:38 AM
It's a pleasant tangent for me. We're at the heart of a serious issue, lol. I will continue trying to understand it so that I can be a useful wrestling partner and for my own work.
SEP 19 12:59 AM
I agree how your work is toward optimism. It is an ambitious account, and it should be.
SEP 19 1:00 AM
I'm all for continuously reimagining a better meat grinder. Lol.
SEP 19 1:03 AM
Sorry, fell asleep last night
SEP 19 1:43 PM
I'm a Platonist too, but a pretty heterodox one. The closest interpreter I've found who I agree with is Iain Hamilton Grant, in "Idealism: History of a Philosophy." The introduction lays it out well. He's a Schellingian, but I see his view as ultimately Hegelian. I'm not a metaphysical materialist, and I don't think Marxism requires that. As far as I see, "materialism" for Marxists need only mean historical materialism, that is, an understanding of human history and sociality as shaped by a base of material conditions and productive forces. Humans are laboring beings. It's just an expansion on Enlightenment thought like that of Smith and Locke
SEP 19 1:46 PM
The extent of my materialism would be a kind of transcendental materialism, which is just to say that matter is antecedent to spirit temporally though not logically. Spirit is not an efficient cause of matter, only a final cause (and that is the true sense in which the Good is the first mover). In terms of efficient causation matter is in every way antecedent to spirit
SEP 19 1:49 PM
Some of our conversations gabe been the most fruitful and enlightening ones I've ever had! I think I you probably influenced my thought in subtle ways
SEP 19 1:50 PM
I see that!
SEP 19 1:50 PM
Err, I mean I see your materialism that way.
SEP 19 1:50 PM
I have often thought we were one two different sides working toward each other on that. Something dialectically fruitful about it for both us.
SEP 19 1:51 PM
The Good literally isn't. It doesn't exist, and this us what it means to say the Good or the One is beyond being, as Plato does. But the sense in which it isn't is the sense in which it is the Ideal, the aspiration to which all matter futily attempts to be. Everything is hurtling towards the Good, blindly and failingly. So the Good is both that which above all else isn't, and that which in it's very absence is most present and pervasive
SEP 19 1:53 PM
Possibly. At the time I was in the MA program my philosophical views were very different. Pretty unformed, actually.
SEP 19 1:53 PM
Spirit is matter in the mode of it's being where it is Spiritual (in the Hegelian, not overtly religious sense). My diss puts forward the thesis that the Hegelian-Heideggerian claim is that Fregean Sinn is a mode of being of Bedeutungen which (as they both get from their appropriations of Aristotle) is nothing but actualization of Bedeutungen's potentialities for being sense
SEP 19 1:56 PM
So our modes of rendering the world intelligible are not mere conventions or creations, nor are they simply discovered as already present. In our material practices and engagements with things, in implicating them into a human form of life, we bring them into their own as being intelligible, and actualize their potential modes of being as Sinnen.
SEP 19 1:58 PM
So both realism and idealism are true, and understood in this way are not even in conflict.
SEP 19 1:59 PM
This is what I mean by ontological labor. We transform things in their being. But this transformation is itself dependent upon ontic or material labor (implicating things in our material practices). Likewise, they can only be so implicated through ontological labor which renders them intelligible such that they show up in such a way as to be appropriated in material practices. Thus the dialectical relationship between ontological and ontic labor. A Heideggerian lens through which to see Marxism
SEP 19 2:01 PM
And it's right there clear as day in Heidegger. His appropriation of Aristotle in his 1920s and 1931 lecture courses spells this out almost entirely explicitly. Just like Hegel, he gets this notion of our role in developing things and bringing Natur to the level of Geist, from his reading of Aristotle. And its relationship to ontic labor (all his talk about hammers and the wood in the workshop) is tied in perfectly to this so that this dialectical relationship is just right there in the text. And no one has seen it before. All the tools for a Heideggerian Marxism as contributing something original and fruitful to Marxism were right there in Heidegger all along
SEP 19 2:04 PM
So I'm solving the mind-world problem, bringing Heidegger closer to Hegel (via triangulating them through Aristotle), and instituting the broad framework for Heideggerian Marxism all in one blow
SEP 19 2:06 PM
I may have lost my mind rofl
SEP 19 2:06 PM
I think courage is required here. There is no other option.
SEP 19 2:06 PM
One of my problems with my PhD program is that this topic was off limits. No one discussed it.
SEP 19 2:07 PM
What topic?
SEP 19 2:07 PM
That's a shame. At my program no topic is off limits. It's the most o pi on environment
SEP 19 2:07 PM
Open*
SEP 19 2:07 PM
Quality work is demanded. But we're all eclectic weirdos.
SEP 19 2:08 PM
Where else could I write this monstrosity? The entire first chapter is really technical analytic stuff on McDowell and Evans and theories of reference
SEP 19 2:08 PM
Well, it's not that you couldn't talk about it, but I think the incentives were not to do this general philosophy. The only group at Tulane that worked on systematic philosopher were the Straussians.
SEP 19 2:09 PM
Then I transition to Heidegger and his reading of Aristotle. The 4th chapter is about later Heidegger and Hegel and Davidson and Heidegger's reading of the Allegory of the Cave. Its fucking out there
SEP 19 2:09 PM
I saw a lot of deconstruction, and I didn't see a lot of people putting their money where their mouths were, sticking their necks out to talk about a theory of everything.
SEP 19 2:10 PM
So what was the norm there? You should have gone to UNM dude. You would have found a great emvirobmemg for your thinking
SEP 19 2:10 PM
Environment
SEP 19 2:10 PM
I hope I'm not constructing a theory of everything lol
SEP 19 2:11 PM
UNM sounds wonderful. I wish I could have gone.
SEP 19 2:12 PM
It's not too late
SEP 19 2:14 PM

It's expansive, sure. I feel like an asshole talking about it lol. But even for my level of unearned grandiosity, theory of everything is a bit much
SEP 19 2:15 PM
You would be so disappointed by what we did at Tulane.
SEP 19 2:15 PM
UNM only admits PhD students with a stipend. It's not much, but it includes tuition waiver
SEP 19 2:15 PM
Tell me more about it. I'm fascinated by other programs because I'm so used to openness (even LSU was rather open)
SEP 19 2:16 PM
I can't say what the program was like before I got there or what it has become after. While I was there, there were two primary camps, the Straussian St. John's crowd (brilliant, narrativists, paranoic poets) and the loosely assembled crowd which were rooted in the Murphy Institute.
SEP 19 2:19 PM
That institute exists, imho, to promote neoliberalism.
SEP 19 2:19 PM
The only person who even mentioned the name Marx was our Libertarian expert, and only because he had to familiarize himself with his opponents to some extent.
SEP 19 2:20 PM
The Straussians dabbled in continental, but otherwise we worshipped analytic.
SEP 19 2:21 PM
If there was a third camp, it was a phil of mind crowd.
SEP 19 2:22 PM
It blows my mind that Heidegger and Hegel weren't mentioned a single time in any of my classes.
SEP 19 2:23 PM
My undergrad had the same problem.
SEP 19 2:23 PM
Gotta jet. Work.
SEP 19 2:26 PM
That's such a bizarre pairing
SEP 19 2:48 PM
Doesn't Sirridge's husband teach at Tulane? I think he's one of these libertarians assholes
SEP 19 2:48 PM
Almost every institute serves neoliberalism. I think my department is exciting because real revolutionary work is being done. My diss adviser is imo really on the front lines of thought about what it means to think of another world. If I had to put his work in a nutshell, his work is about providing a technical background framework for Agamben's political philosophy
SEP 19 2:55 PM
And another of my committee is a protege of Zizek's who is grounding Marxism in a Hegelian metaphysics
SEP 19 2:56 PM
And another reads Heidegger's postmodernism as heralding something new (not Lyotardian postmodernism). So they're all thinkers of revolution
SEP 19 2:57 PM
I can't imagine having gone anywhere else. With regard to philosophy, I wound up exactly where I needed to
SEP 19 2:58 PM
Personal life is a different story lol. But such are the incommensurabilities in our ambitions that dog human being
SEP 19 2:59 PM
Yes, Eric Mack is her husband, and he's the expert. He's quite a beast. Took money from the Koch brothers as well for grant.
SEP 19 10:38 PM
Super jelly about your instutition on that front.
SEP 19 10:39 PM
A beast how? I remember meeting him once and he was a total asshole
SEP 20 12:35 AM
Oh, yeah, no doubt.
SEP 20 12:35 AM
He was skilled at being evil.
SEP 20 12:35 AM
Well of you're smart enough to be an academic who advocates what he does, you'd have to be
SEP 20 12:37 AM
What would he do?
SEP 20 12:37 AM
Nothing special beyond vigorously defending his position at all costs. I've seen him yell a lot in seminars, having to be silenced even, lol.
SEP 20 12:41 AM
A surprising number of students I attended classes with were Libertarians.
SEP 20 12:42 AM
Why does Tulane attract them? He would yell at students?
SEP 20 12:44 AM
No, but at other professors, yes. I saw that. Even guest speakers.
SEP 20 12:44 AM
Wow
SEP 20 12:52 AM
That's unbelievable
SEP 20 12:53 AM
In all seriousness, I've never once read anything by a libertarian on political philosophy that I wasn't virtually immediately unimpressed by
SEP 20 12:55 AM
I say "on political philosophy" because some of Robert Nozick's work in epistemology is worthwhile
SEP 20 12:56 AM
I'm a fan of their willingness to convert all moral rights into property rights and engage in Hohfeldian analysis. What counts as The Moral Law, however, generates very different duties and rights than what they hope for. I deny we own our ourselves to nearly the same degree.
SEP 20 12:58 AM
The Rand-Locke memeplex is perhaps the most dangerous I've ever seen. The infection in our species is absurd.
SEP 20 1:00 AM
I don't like the conversion. I think that propensity seems to me almost exactly what's at issue. The conflation of human being with homosexuality economicus
SEP 20 1:01 AM
What's Hohfeldian analysis?
SEP 20 1:01 AM
Homo economicus lol
SEP 20 1:01 AM
Autocorrect
SEP 20 1:01 AM
Lol, I gotcha
SEP 20 1:01 AM
Normally, I think of homo economicus as being concerned with defining rationality in terms of psychological egoism within staged game theoretic vacuums that allow capitalists to act like they have a mathematical model to justify the centralization of power.
SEP 20 1:03 AM
I don't think that conversion is conceptually linked to thinking of us in terms of homo economicus.
SEP 20 1:03 AM
In fact, I'm convinced Marx should take that step.
SEP 20 1:04 AM
I am interested in the question of to what degree Marx's point about exploitation of labor relies on a Lockeqn picture of labor as the foundation of property rights
SEP 20 1:04 AM
Oh I meant homo economicus somewhat more broadly
SEP 20 1:04 AM
Though as continuous with that
SEP 20 1:05 AM
Hohfeldian analysis takes the concept of duties and having a correspondence with rights. It enables us to build molecular rights clusters from atomic ones.
SEP 20 1:05 AM
I'm not sure Marx's point hinges on the idea that labor is exploited by capitalists because labor is entitled to it's own fruits
SEP 20 1:05 AM
I think the point is more that labor is entitled to it's own labor power, and is not compensated for its labor power. That's where surplus value enters. And since profit is only possible from expropriating surplus value, the idea of ownership of private means of production falls apart
SEP 20 1:06 AM
Marx appears more concerned with discussing a historical description of human behavior than a discussion of the moral justification for what is owed to people and why.
SEP 20 1:07 AM
Political philosophy isn't my bag so sorry if I'm dense
SEP 20 1:07 AM
Sort of. I don't fully buy the typical line that Marx doesn't make a moral appeal in his philosophy
SEP 20 1:07 AM
Well sure, but does everyone interested in such things have to delve fully into metaethics?
SEP 20 1:09 AM
=)
SEP 20 1:09 AM
Lol
SEP 20 1:09 AM
I knew you'd say yes
SEP 20 1:09 AM
I love metaethics. In some ways I see my entire philosophical project as revolving around doing a kind of metaethics. But I'm not sure he needs to do anything more than appeal to some basic moral truths
SEP 20 1:10 AM
Now notice I saying MARX, himself. I don't mean to imply Marxism as a school doesn't need to do so
SEP 20 1:10 AM
I think it very clearly does, as does any school of political thought, and would he all the better for it
SEP 20 1:11 AM
I can appreciate that. I think his message can spread far and wide, and you can see that slavery and exploitation are wrong without having to provide some grand underlying theory of justification.
SEP 20 1:11 AM
Be*
SEP 20 1:11 AM
But, when I am facing the Libertarian as a Marxist, I must start pointing to the groundwork.
SEP 20 1:11 AM
Right. I think all he jeede to do is justify the claim under his own analysis about why capitalism necessarily constitutes a form of exploitation. He doesn't need to argue exploitation is wrong
SEP 20 1:12 AM
Yes I agree with that. Marxism must be prepared with an answer to that. Though any libertarian who attacks the moral premise that exploitation is wrong, and not the analytical claim that capitalism is exploitative, seems to be to be a bizarre ass libertarian
SEP 20 1:13 AM
By it's own lights libertarianism is ostensibly against exploitation. Now in practice the entire philosophy centers around being an apologia for exploitation, but in theory it's not supposed to be
SEP 20 1:13 AM
Aye. I have to give an account of exploitation in metaethics. What counts as treating others as mere means?
SEP 20 1:14 AM
I'm not sure exploitation needs to be analyzed in that kind of Kantian way does it?
SEP 20 1:14 AM
Oh, it is the only unconditional answer. =)
SEP 20 1:15 AM
Lol
SEP 20 1:15 AM
Are you a Kantian?
SEP 20 1:15 AM
I'm going to take a quick shower. Feel free to keep going and I'll catch up
SEP 20 1:15 AM
I aim to be radically charitable to Saint Kant. Paranoic in my interpretation. Only Saint Plato outranks him with me.
SEP 20 1:16 AM
I can't say I agree with everything Kant has to say, nor do I fit in with the Neo-Kantians. I'm not an internalist (which is practically missing the point of what Kant has to say in many people's eyes).
SEP 20 1:17 AM
My completely undeveloped crackpot theory is that The Good sublates The Right and The Beautiful. Kant defines The Right like none other. I am Rawlsian even though I think Rawls went insane/evil. That is what I'm building underneath Saint Marx.
SEP 20 1:21 AM
I aim to build a cryptographically sound, uncensorable, low-hanging fruit anonymity, high-performance electronic voting infrastructure built on algorithmic implementations of The Golden Rule. I consider it a form of the workers own the means of production. I think a philosopher king must eventually be the openly machine learned nash of our identities.
SEP 20 1:27 AM
I've been working with a Hungarian on the network protocol for a few years now.
SEP 20 1:27 AM
I'm crazy. I know.
SEP 20 1:29 AM
Whoa that's interesting. Tell me more
SEP 20 1:47 AM
What do you mean by internalist (I understand that position within epistemology and Phil of mind but not metaethics)
SEP 20 1:48 AM
I mean it in the epistemic sense, and I am convinced The Moral Law is external to us. I take it that most Kantians these days do not believe the CI is a Platonic form but rather exclusively an emergent construction of persons.
SEP 20 1:50 AM
The original truthbearer of The Moral Law is not found in physics.
SEP 20 1:51 AM
I think we are engaged in a reflective equilibrium (a highly dialectical process) to construct the closest corresponding representation of the CI that we can.
SEP 20 1:53 AM
I've been studying how to mathematically define The Golden Rule in game theory, something which economists seem uninterested in doing.
SEP 20 1:55 AM
There is something special about bittorrent, for example, which incentivizes sharing our resources in such a way that decentralized power defeats centralization. Decentralization is a set of hard problems in computer science. The internet is federated and continues to become an oligarghy. It does not aim to be P2P. That problem can be solved, first as a virtual network which sits on top of it, and then eventually as a hardware implementation.
SEP 20 1:58 AM
Automating the sharing of computing resources, and punishing psychopathic behavior on the network (which is required by The Moral Law), can enable the people literally own the internet together. There are many attempts at fixing various aspects of this problem I'm lucky enough to have the chance to learn from.
SEP 20 1:59 AM
One of my goals is to defeat transnationals, including elites and corporations who are beholden to no country's laws. They cannot be taxed or held accountable. The only political sovereignty which could sublate them would have to be an international institution. It's a logistical nightmare even if everyone wanted to cooperate. I'm taking a shot at that logistical nightmare.
SEP 20 2:05 AM
It gets crazier, of course.
SEP 20 2:06 AM
I think we have to begin with ranged quadratic voting, for example, since these ballots store more "bits" of data that represent our preferences (cool kind of compression problem here). We also have to build arbitrarily complex proxies which enable me to leverage trust in people I know. My friend over here is an expert (and he knows a real expert whom he trusts) in this area, and I want him to vote on my behalf in this case, and so forth.
SEP 20 2:08 AM
Expanding how effectively we can be represented is an important problem. Eventually, I want a machine learned representation of me to be my voice, to vote on my behalf, and to select the proxy chains of representation. I am convinced that the technology for openly building powerful models of ourselves is possible (capitalism is already in hot pursuit of it, but they aim to commodify us).
SEP 20 2:12 AM
Eventually, there may come a day where machine learning from my wiki will represent me. GPT2 is hardly AI, but it's a leap which I long thought infeasible, a joke. I'm happy to make fun of transhumanists, but I cannot deny the force of the results I've seen. Functional models of my identity which I've constructed from my own corpus using open tooling on hardware we all own should be used to generate my political representative, the closest version of me we can construct each passing year. Rapid voting and mathematically provable democratic models can arise.
SEP 20 2:16 AM
I think the philosopher king must arise from P2P networks built on trust that defeats iterated prisoner's dilemmas through applications of The Golden Rule (which just is at the very heart of the content of The Moral Law). The Rule of Law is required, and we must own it together.
SEP 20 2:21 AM
This is completely over my head lol
SEP 20 10:52 AM
I will say I disagree the Golden Rule is equivalent to or at the heart of the CI
SEP 20 1:37 PM
As Kant himself said, the GR depend upon judgment from a subjective position, one's own personal, subjective sentiments
SEP 20 1:40 PM
I agree with that.
SEP 20 1:42 PM
I think it's fair to call me a contextualist and a particularist as well.
SEP 20 1:43 PM
I think the ideal computation of the CI includes maximal information maxims, probably down to qualia.
SEP 20 1:44 PM
The CI appears to be a function for weighing, prioritizing, and fairly distributing goods given all possible perspectives in all possible contexts.
SEP 20 1:44 PM
What I like about the ideal of The Golden Rule is that it is especially concerned with not making an exception of oneself one iota more than one is justified.
SEP 20 1:45 PM
That exceptionlessness and fairness in computing The Other appears to be the core of the CI. It's about not privileging our positon more than we conceptually ought. I grant, of course, that pragmatizing such a thing has several infinite regress problems.
SEP 20 1:47 PM
I agree with he point about maxims. As we both know from our Korsgaard seminar, the question of how much information maxims must contain is important and difficult, even ignoring ideal cases.
SEP 20 1:51 PM
Yeah I think any invocation of I is going to give you regress problems lol
SEP 20 1:51 PM
I'm still swayed by counterexamples to CI though
SEP 20 1:52 PM
I'm beginning to bite regress bullets. It's the only way to acquire realism from the ideal.
SEP 20 1:52 PM
I think there's another possibility
SEP 20 1:53 PM
There is at least one true contradiction
SEP 20 1:53 PM
Yes, absolutely!
SEP 20 1:53 PM
I cannot deny my faith in The Dialetheia
SEP 20 1:53 PM
(I personally think they qll reduce to one central dialetheia, but that is beside the point)
SEP 20 1:54 PM
Preach, yo.
SEP 20 1:54 PM
If you embrace dialetheias, you should be able to use that to avoid regresses in any formal system
SEP 20 1:54 PM
That is The Good beyond.
SEP 20 1:54 PM
or at least the doorway
SEP 20 1:55 PM
Yes, though on not sure yet how the Good as such is a true contradiction. But with respect to it being the One it's clear to me. The basic dialetheia seems to have to do with identity and difference
SEP 20 1:55 PM
I have a Hegel book planned where I provide a reading of the Phenomenology as demonstrating not only the existence of the dialetheia but rendering it intelligible
SEP 20 1:56 PM
Balls out, love it.
SEP 20 1:57 PM
Vx((x = x) <--> ~(x = x))
SEP 20 1:57 PM
10 years ago, could you have imagined yourself taking up this position?
SEP 20 1:58 PM
Though its demonstrated directly by Hegel in the form of (I = I) <--> ~(I = I)
SEP 20 1:58 PM
As for myself, no fucking way.
SEP 20 1:58 PM
I can't believe I'm turning into a mystic.
SEP 20 1:58 PM
The generalization is supposed to be justified by reference to the I simply being the most apparent site of the contradiction
SEP 20 1:59 PM
Nope I couldn't lol. Not even 7 years ago. My diss chair convinced me.
SEP 20 2:00 PM
The point of my Hegel book is to avoid mysticism. The dialetheia can be grasped and understood
SEP 20 2:01 PM
Oh, well, I will agree that we can continue to make progress in choosing our turtle in the turtles all the way down. There are special kinds of logic which might offer some insight here, providing a humble safety harness for talking about The Infinite and The Dialetheia.
SEP 20 2:02 PM
I guess I fucked up above. The dialetheia is implied by the above universality quantified statement in conjunction with the claim Vx(x = x). Those two together entail a dialetheia
SEP 20 2:03 PM
Have you read Paul Livingston's work (my chair)?
SEP 20 2:03 PM
I will agree it is our fundamental job as philosophers to make what can me intelligible as clear as possible, and what is left is the mystical ground of all being for us. I aim to make a very narrow window into it.
SEP 20 2:03 PM
I'm sorry. I've never heard of him. You know me, I'm radically underread, lol. I should know all these people.
SEP 20 2:03 PM
He goes through why the decision thrust upon all formalisms is either 1) contradictory totalities (what he calls the "paradoxico-critical" orientation) or 2) incomplete consistencies (the "generic" orientation)
SEP 20 2:05 PM
Yes.
SEP 20 2:06 PM
I agree to that.
SEP 20 2:06 PM
I have too much Paul in me. On his view of the orientations there is no need for mysticism if you subscribe to paradoxico-criticism. Mysticism belongs to the other two orientations, ontotheology and transcendentalism
SEP 20 2:06 PM
They both ultimately appeal to a consistent totality which requires something which cannot be rationally unaccounted for (for ontorheology, God, and for transcendentalism the transcendental subject)
SEP 20 2:07 PM
Cannot rationally be accounted for by a finite mind.*
SEP 20 2:07 PM
The appeal bottoms out in something which cannot be described further. Think the Given. Substance
SEP 20 2:07 PM
Atoma
SEP 20 2:07 PM
That's the same thing
SEP 20 2:08 PM
I do not know.
SEP 20 2:08 PM
I think I must be silent on that one.
SEP 20 2:08 PM
The point is that it cannot be accounted for under any analysis. There is a level where analysis needs be ceases
SEP 20 2:08 PM
It would be as true for an "infinite" mind as for a finite one (I'm not sure how to understand the metaphor anymore)
SEP 20 2:09 PM
I suggest The Infinite computes itself, but I won't attribute a mind to It. I simply do not know.
SEP 20 2:12 PM
Image attached to message
SEP 20 2:13 PM
I think the Infinite computes itself too (insofar as I know what you mean by that), but that sort of redlexivity is going to require contradiction
SEP 20 2:16 PM
To "compute itself", the Absolute must reflexively negate itself
SEP 20 2:17 PM
I'm not sure which camp is more fitting for me, btw.
SEP 20 2:17 PM
And there, I put that in proper Hegelian terms haha
SEP 20 2:17 PM
I also agree with that. =)
SEP 20 2:17 PM
If you are a dialetheist, then you're a paradoxico-critic
SEP 20 2:18 PM
I'm not positive the inverse is true. I'd have to ask Paul
SEP 20 2:18 PM
That's probably the case since incompleteness appears to only be the case for finite languages.
SEP 20 2:18 PM
Saint Godel is screaming to me about The Dialetheia.
SEP 20 2:19 PM
Lol
SEP 20 2:20 PM
The modal collapse is one I still cannot answer.
SEP 20 2:20 PM
Well as you can see, Paul puts Godel in the generic camp
SEP 20 2:20 PM
Seema right but I'm not familiar enough with Godel's positive views. But from what I know he seemed to take the lesson of the incompleteness theory to be  just what it looks like: incomplete consistencies
SEP 20 2:21 PM
Do you think everything is necessary?
SEP 20 2:22 PM
What do you mean?
SEP 20 2:24 PM
A necessary truth is one that is true in all possible worlds. Do you believe contingency obtains?
SEP 20 2:25 PM
Yes
SEP 20 2:26 PM
Another way to ask that is just to say is there more than one possible world
SEP 20 2:26 PM
?*
SEP 20 2:26 PM
Yes, that's correct.
SEP 20 2:28 PM
Or, at least I think it is.
SEP 20 2:28 PM
I think there also The/A Dialetheia right there as well.
SEP 20 2:29 PM
Godel's Ontological Proof is an enormous threat.
SEP 20 2:30 PM
late for work, ttyl! =)
SEP 20 2:30 PM
An enormous threat to the idea of contingency?
SEP 20 2:46 PM
I realized [[REDACTED]], unless [[REDACTED]]
SEP 20 3:38 PM
I don't remember [[REDACTED]] and I can [[REDACTED]]
SEP 20 3:39 PM
If I can I just need [[REDACTED]] and that'll [[REDACTED]] obviously
SEP 20 3:39 PM
I find myself more and ore drifting towards a certain kind of sentimentalism in moral epistemology

SEP 22 4:00 PM
I think in general moa knowledge is like aesthetic knowledge. Having the right moral attitudes is like having the right aesthetic attitudes. It's a matter of having cultivated the right sensitivities, not rational understanding
SEP 22 4:01 PM
Sorry, AFKed hard this weekend.
SEP 22 11:10 PM
Yeah, I think his proof demonstrates a serious threat to contingency.
SEP 22 11:11 PM
Having [[REDACTED]]. You'd still need [[REDACTED]]. It may take [[REDACTED]]. You could also [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:15 PM
I grant that rationality is a second order process which exists only in virtue of emotional first order processes in our minds. There is no reason for us without sentiment.
SEP 22 11:18 PM
Cognition seems to be a necessary ingredient to be morally culpable, but I have no idea how to draw the lines effectively enough.
SEP 22 11:18 PM
Even toddlers can distinguish between social conventions and moral norms by something like 17-months. But, I don't take their agency to be complete by any stretch without the reflectivity provided by our slower system 2, ability to develop theories of mind necessary for cognitive empathy and applying abstractions over our perceptions.
SEP 22 11:21 PM
Habituating the sensitivities to pick out what is salient is a crucial process, no doubt. It is our reason which enables us to slowly build the very fast blink-of-an-eye automated algorithms in our limbic system. Rationality is part of the process which constructs our virtuous perception in a meaningful way.
SEP 22 11:23 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:27 PM
Remember I know none of [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:27 PM
Non-cognitivism, anti-codificationism, lacking articulacy and direct awareness of justifications for morality are significant problems. I think virtue theory does a good job of explaining an important part of moral psychology.
SEP 22 11:27 PM
Sorry, my fault.
SEP 22 11:27 PM
If you aren't going [[REDACTED]], then you'll need [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:28 PM
So, you'll need [[REDACTED]]. You'll [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:29 PM
You'll be [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:29 PM
I cannot speak to aesthetics well enough. I'm willing to say it does not require rationality.
SEP 22 11:30 PM
Right, I know I'd still need to [[REDACTED]], but [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:30 PM
Oh yes, [[REDACTED]] a step for you.
SEP 22 11:30 PM
Especially because [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:30 PM
Odds are reasonable you'd have tried [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:31 PM
I haven't checked yet, something I would [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:31 PM
I don't think I could [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:32 PM
I have no clue [[REDACTED]] lol
SEP 22 11:33 PM
Depends on [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:35 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:35 PM
What is [[REDACTED]]? I doubt [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:36 PM
Oh, sorry.
SEP 22 11:36 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:36 PM
Oh ok
SEP 22 11:37 PM
So, if you [[REDACTED]], you can [[REDACTED]], and then you [[REDACTED]]. You become [[REDACTED]]. If [[REDACTED]], then you can [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:38 PM
If [[REDACTED]], then you will have [[REDACTED]], and with that you [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]], and [[REDACTED]]...BUT, [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:40 PM
[[REDACTED]], you shouldn't do this.
SEP 22 11:40 PM
And then [[REDACTED]], just in case [[REDACTED]]?
SEP 22 11:40 PM
Right, though [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:41 PM
Well, there are [[REDACTED]], but [[REDACTED]] (though, you could [[REDACTED]], and in fact, [[REDACTED]]...depending on [[REDACTED]]).
SEP 22 11:41 PM
I think [[REDACTED]] lol
SEP 22 11:42 PM
You might just [[REDACTED]], especially if you know [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:42 PM
Oh, it is certainly [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:42 PM
I don't think it's easy though.
SEP 22 11:42 PM
Well and less complex
SEP 22 11:42 PM
No. It's much harder.
SEP 22 11:43 PM
You are taking the hardest route.
SEP 22 11:43 PM
Hmm
SEP 22 11:43 PM
I know [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:43 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:43 PM
And, there's a good chance [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:44 PM
Well hopefully I won't [[REDACTED]]. Still needs [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:44 PM
[[REDACTED]] might take months?
SEP 22 11:45 PM
Aye.
SEP 22 11:45 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:45 PM
Oh yeah that's not going to be possible. There's no [[REDACTED]]. Not even close
SEP 22 11:45 PM
[[REDACTED]] is it.
SEP 22 11:46 PM
Lol
SEP 22 11:46 PM
Unless you [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:46 PM
Uhh pretty clear [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:46 PM
Like, [[REDACTED]], and [[REDACTED]].
SEP 22 11:46 PM
There's going to be luck no matter how you would do this.
SEP 22 11:47 PM
Maybe I should think about [[REDACTED]] lol
SEP 22 11:48 PM
The main reason I chose this is because [[REDACTED]], and there's no other good explanation [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:49 PM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:49 PM
I hear ya. I'm still not convinced [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]]. This is dreaming to me, and I think that's totally fine.
SEP 22 11:52 PM
If I had [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:54 PM
The primary obstacle is [[REDACTED]]. I'm not saying I'm not [[REDACTED]], but [[REDACTED]]
SEP 22 11:55 PM
I have so many [[REDACTED]] I wish for.
SEP 22 11:58 PM
You probably have, but I think you should write about it. As crazy fucking painful as it is, it's worth your inspection.
SEP 22 11:59 PM
I've done some stuff like that
SEP 23 12:00 AM
[[REDACTED]]
SEP 23 12:14 AM
What do you think about [[REDACTED]]?
SEP 23 2:18 AM
I think they are a profound danger to democracy.
SEP 23 2:20 AM
Well yeah. Aren't [[REDACTED]]?
SEP 23 2:20 AM
Some more than others. This one stands out.
SEP 23 2:21 AM
I gotcha. I don't think it's a good way to go for a few reasons. I don't have any interest in [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]]
SEP 23 2:24 AM
