title: 2018.02.26 - Carpe Diem Log: Shining Happy People

* Woke at 3, but went back to sleep until 6 when my wife woke.
** My head hurt again in the exact same spot. I researched this spot; it is the sensory strip of my parietal lobe. I can guarantee I push this during the day, but I find it odd that I don't seem to get headaches until I've fallen asleep, especially when I've been dreaming for significant periods of time. It is as though the sensory content I'm generating while I sleep is the cause of my headache. 
* We spent our morning together, which was nice.
** I fear, however, that I'm interrupting her morning routine and her "me time." I should rethink how I do this. It might be a mistake.
* Woke the kids, hugs, and onto work.
* Read+Write
* [[Master Curriculum Vitae]]
* Finished [[The Shining]]
* Played basketball with the kids
* Walked with wife
* Indian food
* Found out the kids didn't complete their work (/weep), so we fixed that.
* Got drunk

* Couch by 1:30
