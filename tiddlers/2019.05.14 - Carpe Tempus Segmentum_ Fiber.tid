* Read+Write
* Work

** So good. My wife nails the spices. I like cooking with her.
* Minocycline is causing me to break out in hives, and I'm staying out of the sun. I watching my breathing and mental state, and I'll use antihistamines at night. I see the doctor next week, and I don't think I should stop taking them if I can help it.
** Also, new conjecture: I think it was an internal infection, and I think I popped something when I took a shit such that it caused that instant balloon. My blood vessels in the skin feel it right now even.
* GoT
** I laughed my ass off. This show is fucking terrible. It is the greatest fall I have ever seen in a show. Of course, I think S1 is arguably the best season of any show ever produced. Hard to compete with that when you don't have a playbook.
** I'm hoping that will spur GRRM to finish. I mean, the bar is set so low for him now. He could shit out a better story with little effort. No need for perfectionism, homie.
* My wife and I explored new shows. 
* Sleep by 11:30ish
