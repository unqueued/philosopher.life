"""
[12:06 PM]  h0p3: Long time, no see.
[12:06 PM]  h0p3: You doing alright?

[5:56 AM]  Shp: hello h0p3!
sorry I didn't have time to respond yesterday 
I'm okay, battling my demons, procrastination is a difficult enemy to beat, its like my ultimate boss fight :D
it is also the main reason why I haven't wrote to you - its on my mind somewhat frequently to write but I don't end up doing it. 

I think last time I thought about writing to you was when I read a  fresh interpretation of Pascal's wager (it was fresh to me because it was the opposite of the original conclusion and yet it made complete sense to me) it's pretty simple, saying "use our time to get to know the universe and make the best of it for if we don't we lose everything and if there is life after death we didn't lose anything" it kinda disregards hell as a possibility (though for the most part as far as I understand people should be safe from hell) 
but then I thought: have we discussed religion? also, this is weird, like, i want to bring up a subject (religion in this case) but then I wonder if we've talked about it or not and whether or not I should check (do a search on your wiki or in here) to determine. but even if we did talk about it, we might do it differently this time, or one of- perhaps both our opinions have changed since then so maybe it's worth talking about it again. religion is an interesting subject on many levels because I often wonder whether or not I'd ever think about god or religion if I wasn't surrounded by it, and the logical contradictions in god makes it seem like a paradox but if there is something that can stand being a paradox it should be god (regardless of that, for me it seems unlikely that there is one or more gods, but I'm agnostic as far as a deity is not being used to chicken out from explaining and understanding natural phenomena - this means that as much as I admire and love the guy, Newton failed in my opinion because he used god when he couldn't fully explain gravity .. also, if its being used as reason to war its even worse, obviously.)
[1:43 PM]  h0p3: No worries. I'm glad to hear from you, and happy to talk asynchronously. It's a necessity in life, imho; I couldn't live without it.
[1:44 PM]  h0p3: I'm battling the same boss. You will have to let me know how you defeat the bastard, lol. I think he's hacked even my computer so that I can't find the guides which will defeat him.
[1:47 PM]  h0p3: Also, please don't worry about how long it takes to write me. I take forever to write letters. Also, I've not been directly reaching out either. I think it's a two-way street here. Glad to walk and talk when we can.
[1:49 PM]  h0p3: That is an interesting interpretation of The Wager. There may be ways to think about The Wager outside of an afterlife too.
[1:50 PM]  h0p3: (I don't believe in an after, or most charitably, I'm agnostic to it. I won't assent to the claim, but I ultimately can't provide proof.)
[1:50 PM]  h0p3: I think we have discussed religion in some respects. It's a huge topic. Worth our time, no doubt.
[1:52 PM]  h0p3: I don't mind being redundant in our discussions. I think it's necessary, especially if it's been a while. I think it's how we can continue to rabbithole and patch our story together over time. There has to be overlap to increase the margins of error too.
[1:54 PM]  h0p3: You should check out my correspondence with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. I think it might help provide us some common ground on this issue. I believe there's something outside the physical universe, a sufficient reason^^tm^^.
[1:55 PM]  h0p3: Newton failed for many reasons, and he succeeded in others. He thought he was doing theology, and I don't consider him skilled in that regard.
[1:56 PM]  h0p3: But, physicists, by definition, cannot test metaphysics. The edges of theoretical physics, however, point to their discipline's reliance upon philosophical assumptions, often metaphysics.
[1:57 PM]  h0p3: I do believe in one true contradiction, btw. It's an absurd claim to accept among many philosophers. I think it's one of the reasons I might be called a mystic.
