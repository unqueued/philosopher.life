title: 2018.09.08 -- Charlie: He's Alive

I feel relieved! We were about to ask for someone to check in on him, but he picked up!

We talked for 3.5 hours. As usual, computers, electrical engineering, physics, philosophy, politics, and religion. We went everything. That dude has so much patience (and I would like to think I'm patient with him as well). It's uncommon for people to have the will power to rabbithole with me for even an hour. I really love having the opportunity to talk with him.

It's important that I have at least one insane conservative in my life that I dearly love talking to.
