title: 2020.02.05 - Wiki Review: Making Due

* [[2020.02.04 - Prompted Introspection: Giving]]
** Edited. I'm making due with shitty questions. =)

** I await the official numbers and retellings. It will be statistically demonstrable that someone was lying. Perhaps the DNC by at least 5%, not including a half a dozen different kinds of shady dealings in Iowa alone.
*** I'm taking the time to have my family look closely at this. The last time, I was so deep in depression, and no one believed me when I said Trump had already won roughly this time four years ago.
**** My offspring, in particular, need to dig here. To practice recognizing the horrible truth. 
*** Still, I am more [[hope]]ful now than I've been in quite a while on this front.

** You did a fine job. 
*** To the point my wife is envious, since we've just not been able to complete her side of the room in such a nice fashion. I'm glad she liked it too.
** I'm hoping that these pushes will help them get the ball rolling. I'm desperate for them to take over in their unschooling, to take the bull by the horns, to steer the ship. Justified autonomy is ridiculously hard to teach, and the windows are closing for both of them.

** I am disappointed in them, but that's okay. I hope it will stick this time. It's a lesson that wealthier households can afford to teach their offspring from such a young age. 
*** It's such a good opportunity to teach the teleology of the self in materialist dialectics. That monster only grows, and I need examples that come alive.

** I remembered I forgot this in a dream, lol. What the fuck? I don't understand, but thank you subconscious.
