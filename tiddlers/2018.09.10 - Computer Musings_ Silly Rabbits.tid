Wife wants to go back to Manjaro; pacman and aur is just easy mode. I gave her Ubuntu to help her practice in an environment for learning ILS for tech aspects of being a librarian. She's not going that route, at all. It's hard to convince her to make space for professional development.

Manjaro is definitely the way to go. Gonna try to get her hooked on i3 with the rest of us. I know she hates the touchpad, and this is a good way to control her machine radically. Plus, she would be joining the rest of us in using this tool.

Emergency teleconference for my wife, had to install some random set of things for her. It's for her class through May. She wants to stick with Ubuntu until then?
