title: 2019.01.26 - Computer Musings: Git

Hrm. I rarely check https://philosopher.life/. I've missed a day. We have a git problem with a lock leftover. We have no idea what happened, and I don't know how to diagnose it. At least for now, I'm not sure it's worth digging for either. We'll see if it happens again, eh? Part of the problem is that I so rarely touch git that I'm not going to remember the machinations enough to troubleshoot effectively. The whole point is to set it and forget it (which is such an entitled attitude to have as a lazy person like me).

I am grateful to my daughter once again for thinking and working with me.
