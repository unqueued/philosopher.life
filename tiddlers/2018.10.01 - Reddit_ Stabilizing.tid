title: 2018.10.01 - Reddit: Stabilizing

Down to 18 subs. I culled about 4 from, some of them which were never on the previous list (picked up in between). After culling, I'm left with almost the same list as last time (and it's been almost two months).

One good thing to note: I don't spend a ton of time on Reddit anymore. I use it as a powerful tool every day, but I feel like I've cut the addictive quality out of it quite a bit.

Not all of these subs are equal. The Titlesubs are non-trivial candy, but still useful. Unfortunately, when I scroll down enough, they are often all that Reddit's everchanging algo tends to show me (though not always reproducible). 

I've clearly found a solid filterbubble, at least for a while, right? I'm glad to keep in minimalist here too. I may eventually move to Titlesubs, Visualsubs, and Conversationsubs
