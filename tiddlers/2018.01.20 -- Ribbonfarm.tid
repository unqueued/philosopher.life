The Idealist-Tragedian dualism/spectrum is very interesting. I feel like he's talking my language.

<<<
believers in “progress” (of both Republican and Democratic varieties in America) often help maintain the status quo by occupying stable marginal positions. The revolution never comes.
<<<

Yup. 

<<<
As Shaw noted, “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.”
<<<

I think that Stoicism is obviously the idealist "reasonable man" position. He adapts himself by reframing his perception of the world. I worry, of course, that this very line is what "refactoring perception" might easily be. How is this any different?

seeking the philosopher’s stone to transform base metals into gold ends up transforming you.

He knows how to pick'em. It's obvious.

<<<
idealists often elaborate the idea of perfectability into a doctrine of continuously evolving perfection, which declares that you are perfect as you are, at every point on your path. You can only become more perfect (it is revealing that the words “more perfect” occur in the American constitution). This has the effect of making it impossible for you to backtrack from a given path or admit that something was a “deep” mistake capable of causing real regret, damage or death.

He has such a strange notion of idealism. I agree there are a class of people engaged in the mindframe and behavior he has described here. I don't think I want to call it idealism, but I'm not sure what I want to call it. The "perfect-as-you-are," "no r//a//grets" crowd is closer. People who relativize too strongly or for the wrong reasons to preserve their identity. We all avoid change, but these people are profoundly effective at it.

# Idealists revere non-zero-sum “win win” thinking over zero-sum “win-lose” thinking. Tragedians are neutral and objective about both, and pick the framing the suits the situation.
# Idealists revere long-term thinking over short-term. Tragedians focus on the appropriate time horizon for a given situation.
# Idealists seek “sustainability” or worse, “sustainable growth.” Tragedians believe both concepts to be fundamentally vacuous.
# Idealists often seek to be kind and end up being unwittingly cruel. Tragedians are often low-empathy sociopaths, but paradoxically end up doing good without meaning to.

Wtf is this list? Here's your problem for (1). I do reverse non-zero-sum thinking because I revere the golden rule, the CI. I think that moral meaning requires it, even if we must particularize it profoundly. Of course, I'm not silly enough to conflate is/ought, prescription and description. What does it even mean to be neutral and objective about both, or "suits" in this case? Are you going to be able to explain this, let alone justify it?

(2) and (3) have strong conceptual relationships, and I think he's going to fail to follow the golden rule for future identities, applying the Reflective Equilibrium as a decentralized project at large. Ah, I am an idealist, clearly. I'm an idealist struggling with what will not be, but that does not mean I give up trying to find out what could be. Rao approaches the ideal through the practical lens, and I the other direction.

(4) Good being consequentialist in nature. I can appreciate that. I have some pointers, but I'll leave them alone.
