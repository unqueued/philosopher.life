title: ARAM: Swain

I adore Swain because I love draintanks in general. Swain is particularly well-suited to ARAM. He's an excellent teamfighter with amazing sustain. Early game you are short-range mage (so be careful), but post-6, you can very effectively heal yourself. Played correctly, you are a nearly unkillable tank with far too much damage. At some point, people stop even trying to kill you. I tend to build tankier than many. 

* Summoners
** Clarity - Because Swain is a fucking mana whore. You'll be glad you have it in the middle of team fights. It enables you to sustain your ult for absurd durations.
** Flash - Was there any doubt?
* Build
** Items
*** Start
**** Catalyst of Aeons
**** Refillable Potion
*** General Build
**** Rod of Ages - Just fucking Godly on him
**** Boots - Whichever mitigation stat matters most. Make your heals count for more real survivability.
**** Spirit Visage - Premier Draintank item. It's so strong, I'd still buy it even if there were only facing one AP champ.
**** Zhonya's Hourglass - Pop with ult on, and heal while you are invulnerable. Mitigation stats are godly
**** Banshee's Veil - CDR, AP, MR, and a defensive passive. Yes, please. Let me draintank. Obviously, if are facing a heavy AD comp, you go Thornmail.
**** Liandry's Torment or Thornmail - If you need damage, go for torment, and if you need to tank AD more, then Thornmail.
