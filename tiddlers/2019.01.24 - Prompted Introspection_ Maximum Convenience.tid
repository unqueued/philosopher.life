title: 2019.01.24 - Prompted Introspection: Maximum Convenience

!! What is a convenience you wouldn't want to do without?

I'm afraid I'm unable to give a valid conceptual analysis of convenience (beyond the usual problematics). I often think of convenience as that which is unnecessary but desirable. What is the modality of this necessity? Obviously, it cannot be Possible Worlds/Logical Necessity (which the question demonstrates). Some people might think it necessity to survive, but what is surviving? At some point, I think many people would agree eudaimonic flourishing is the real line. That's a problem: I'm a radical moral perfectionist who also takes my moral agency to be far more fundamental to my eudaimonia than even Saint Aristotle (imho). In the Hohfeldian analysis, I think an enormous amount is owed to each of us (to a point where I find a large set of legal obligations to be nullified). Even my understanding of the moral property distribution is radical enough that necessity is stretched. I live fairly spartanly in some respects, and I don't aim to have convenience that I can't morally justify (though I am surely a failure).

Alright, given that enormous caveat, I think there are morally unnecessary though permitted conveniences in my life. I think the food I eat is incredibly convenient and I eat like past-royalty. I know I almost never get to go out to eat, but I have amazing meals all the time. I think that convenience borders on being over-the-top and even impermissible. Our family averages $150 a week on food, but we could cut that down (we have before). This isn't the most expensive convenience (my cats are easily that, costing about $600 a month after rent and care costs are adjusted...but it may be sanity-medicine for my wife if we are less stoic about it), but our delicious food is the drug I would not want to do without.
