I wonder if the Neo-Rationalist community's attempt to reduce everything down to "culture war" as though there is no reality to good and evil, explaining such things as mere "in group" good "out group" bad, is partially a result of this series of books, which they have appeared to cartoonify to their own goals.

Boggart is doing its thing. Device is loud as fuck.

Luna is such a different character. Maybe I'm most like Luna! I do feel like an alien with her. Sometimes I think people assume I read shitrags too, lol.

Why is Sirius not allowed to be with Harry at all times? Seems like a reasonable accommodation.

The Sorting Hat's chorus role is lovely.

As always, I'm a huge fan of freedom in academia.

I think unity is far more complex than is presented here. I appreciate the goodwill though.
