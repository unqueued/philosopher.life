title: 2018.11.08 - Guitar: Solo

I played with each of the kids some. My son's guitar pick just sounds awful, so we're sticking to playing without. I sent him up to practice strumming patterns. My daughter and I played. Our intro sounds as good as //Deliverance//. It's clear that she has a ton of work in front of her though. The guitar piece is laughably easy compared to what she has; she is the star of the show. We've both noticed an odd vibration coming out of the drum on her banjo; I'm leaving it up to her to research and fix it (or propose what needs to be fixed).
