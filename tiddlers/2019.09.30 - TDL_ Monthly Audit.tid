title: 2019.09.30 - TDL: Monthly Audit

* Wife decides if I'm going shopping.
** She might want to go with me. We can also wait another day just fine, I think.
* You have letters to write, sir.
* Monthly Audit.
* Your kids are still fucking up. Ridiculous.
* Make sure rent is paid. Figure out if there is an insurance issue we must handle.
