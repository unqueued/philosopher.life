!! Audit: 

* I am lucky to have the brother and wife I do. It's hard to find people who consistently go out of their way to empathize with you. I hope I can pay them back in empathy too.
* So many Fireman Times!
* Phones and vehicle purchases planned. Will compete it two days from now. Definitely on track.
* I've not applied to the Louisville area. I'm hoping I won't have to right now, but in the future I would like to live near my brothers. I'm really waiting for financial stability. Eventually, my wife will be ready for a director position, I assume.
* I basically never play league anymore during the weekdays. That's fine though. I'm super busy. Good reason!
* My step-father-in-law might not have the right words, but he sometimes has the right actions.
* I've received $500 Gifts from two family members now. I am going to pay them back. I am really grateful.
* I'm reminded that I actually did do some philosophy this month. It wasn't as much as I'd have liked, but I've had very little time in some respects.
* I've decided against the van, unless it's cheap.
* I need more drugs in my life.
* I've been really lucky to be able to stay in touch with my family while away. I'm glad I get to talk to them so much.
* It was a very stressful month.
* I've stopped doing my link log consistently. 
* My schedule has crystallized somewhat. I like that.
* I live for the weekends. 
* It's been difficult with so few resources and tools.
* My wife should initiate more often.
* Infomacracy turned out to be terrible.
* Armstrong is retarded.
** But, I'd let him give my wife some brown sugar if she wanted it.
* Phrases:
** Bricks Pushed
** Inform the Men
** Fireman Time
** ...I need more...
* Keep eating them fruits and vegetables.
* I feel like I don't get to talk with ALM much, and never with AIR. =(
* This was a month to talk about racism, no doubt.
* My wife's shrimp, egg, and cheesy grits are amazeballs. Me want.
* I'm taking pictures. I never take pictures. It's interesting.
* I'm back to the blankets for Fireman Time. Hard to beat. ;P
* Tim has been a real mentor.
* It's been an itchy, sore, stressful month.
** My wife has been a goddess angel with a pretty mouth.
* Never found a good place for those notes. That's okay. Wing it. 
* Several times I fell asleep early from exhaustion.
* I still haven't rectified my wife's need for a computer. We will get there.
* I have resided in a truly terrible neighborhood. Lol.
