Made a leather strop
THU 8:47 PM
That is the gayest thing I've heard today.
THU 8:47 PM
Also, that looks way cool.
THU 8:48 PM
(I'm drunk)
THU 8:48 PM
How'd you do the grip?
THU 8:48 PM
Also, are you going to use it?
THU 8:49 PM
If not, maybe you should sell it.
THU 8:49 PM
(though you shouldn't feel forced to commodify your art)
THU 8:49 PM
Apprentice complained about his knife being dull
THU 8:50 PM
Offered to sharpen
THU 8:50 PM
Then I saw it really probably only needed to be stropped
THU 8:50 PM
He didn't know what that meant
THU 8:50 PM
I had bought some leather a month ago to make one
THU 8:51 PM
I mean, look at the word. There are less than 10 million people alive who have said the word "stropped."
THU 8:51 PM
That is cool that you had done all the prep for it too.
THU 8:51 PM
And figured now was a good time to make one and I'll probably let him have this one and I'll try to make another with the rest of my leather
THU 8:51 PM
That is awesome.
THU 8:52 PM
You should sign it.
THU 8:52 PM
Don't know of a way to do it well.
THU 8:52 PM
Should have a mark though.
THU 8:52 PM
I want my mark to look like a turd emerging from a sloppy butthole
THU 8:53 PM
Rofl
THU 8:53 PM
Do it.
THU 8:53 PM
never forgetti, :airplane: ▌▌
THU 8:54 PM
You design the new asci from scratch?
THU 8:54 PM
Lol
THU 8:54 PM
Omg
THU 8:54 PM
Never seen that before
THU 8:54 PM
Not mine. No idea where it is from, like all the good memes. But, your turds shall be remembered forever!
