title: 2018.08.20 - Prompted Introspection: Happiest This Year

!! When were you the happiest this year?

That's a crazy hard question to answer, especially since I have a hard time trusting memory. 

I also need to understand the time frame. This is [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] territory. I can't answer the question without knowing the scope of the timeslice. If we are talking about a couple seconds, there have been sublime and orgasmic moments which were a cut above the rest this year. Somehow, the structures which are distributed over the course of the year need not even be fully linear. 

When I answer the question as a network of times, I would have to say I'm been most happy with the improvements in the lives of my children. They are growing so god damned fast. I feel like they are becoming their own persons more and more. The autonomy bleeds through. That isn't to say it's been pleasurable, but happiness, in this case is more eudaimonic than merely hedonic.
