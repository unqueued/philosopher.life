title: 2017.07.04 - Carpe Diem Log

* I woke up crazy late. I need to start using my alarm clock again. This past week has thrown my schedule off. I need to get back in the groove, especially before work.
* Fireman time!
* I got the kids started on schoolwork.
* I worked hard today, but I also had plenty of time to read and surf.
* I sent a letter to AB&T, and I felt some anxiety about it. 
* I studied, and I'm still going to study some more.
* We had pancake-berry tacos/wraps. They are delicious.
* I modified a script to make another useful one today. I'm wondering how far I should take this automation. I wonder if I should go just flat texts files. I've read a lot of hackers who ultimately swear by it. I can see why. 
* I've played some league, and I did some fun writing in my wiki.
* Inform the men!
* We watched John Oliver and a GoT episode today.
* My browser somehow just filled up again. It does that. =)
* The audit went by quickly. 
* I've been feeling nervous, excited, and worried about next week.
** I think I should do a meal prep.
** I will find a place in the next two days.
** I need to map out/write down locations of important places for my GPS.
* Our first purchase will be phones for the family.
** It is crucial that I can contact my children at will, and vice versa.
* Our second purchase will be a vehicle.
* I'm considering applying the Louisville area as well, since I could live with my brother, assuming his SO would be okay with it.
