This is a hell of a dogwhistle. It's slick as fuck; many people obviously want it to be true. It appears to claim that thinking of a [[good]] beyond yourself is irrational. It is clearly false that I think little of myself and my life even while agreeing that there are [[good]]s higher than my own life and happiness. Note how I can at the same time will universalizable maxims particularized to my context while also revering [[The Good]] as a totalitizing object. Rand and I obviously disagree on what even counts as utopia. Indeed, objective meaning is external to me. I am not the center of reality; I do not construct [[The Moral Law]] (though I have a hand in constructing my representations/models of it);<<ref "2020.02.08">> I am not that which matters most, and the same applies to everyone and everything which isn't [[The Good]].
