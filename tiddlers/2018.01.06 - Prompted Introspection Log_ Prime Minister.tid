title: 2018.01.06 - Prompted Introspection Log: Prime Minister

!! Why would a Prime Minister have a sign on his desk which read, "The buck stops here"?

Samwise, did they let you out of the loony bin again? What the fuck is this question? There aren't many reasons I can think of. It could just be a joke, and if it's not a joke, then it's a weird penis enhancement device. 

To me, that phrase is more than just about responsibility but is also tied to the power which deserves that responsibility. I suppose one might interpret it as solely about where to place blame. That I could respect. Taking responsibility is something I would appreciate. Of course, I don't see people in power who do such a thing. That's just not the world we live in.
