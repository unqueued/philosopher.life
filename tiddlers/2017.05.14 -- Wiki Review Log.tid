title: 2017.05.14 -- Wiki Review Log

I skipped 3 days because I didn't use the wiki or even the internet much at all over the weekend. I was visiting my family. I'll review my last full day, the 11th. Note, I did keep notes for my diet and few other things over the weekend. I'm grafting them in today.

** Glad we took it easy that day because the weekend was wild. I did not eat healthily at my brother's.

** I noticed that I continued to tweak [[2017.05.10 -- Trump's Nixonian Firing of Comey]]. Sometimes the wording just wasn't what I wanted. I like that I nitpick.
