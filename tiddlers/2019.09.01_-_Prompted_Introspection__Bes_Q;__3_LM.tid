title: 2019.09.01 - Prompted Introspection: Bes Q; <3 LM

!! Which living person do you most despise?

Zomg, are we in [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] right now? Lady Melisandre, u da bes. XD. It is rare that [[The Right]] is so god damn [[Beautiful]]. Who would dare codify such a thing? Lol. I get to play while not playing in here. Stick a quarter in me fo dat [[arrogant]] Kanyautist monologuing. 

When I'm finally allowed to cleanup [[Generic Prompts]], I'm keeping this one. I covet it! Rofl. I didn't let it rip in [[2017.05.25 - Prompted Introspection Log]], but it's a fine answer. [[David Koch|Poem: SMITH]] would have been high up on the list, but I got to celebrate cosmic tango down recently (noice!). I have a couple of enemies in my life, but my greatest enemies are far beyond my social spheres.

You know, it's easy to like someone for talking about who they like or [[love]]. We can all appreciate a Buddha, a Jesus, an innocent baby, or even a basic life of a decent person.<<ref "n">> Usually, we all claim to like or [[love]] something or someone which most people will agree (at least publicly, when forced to signal) has positive attributes. Few are going to be philosophical in their analysis here (and it's uncouth to be negative here, right?); it's easy to be sociable and pass over disagreement (though I do not claim this is wise). Oh, but hatred is more obviously recursively disagreeable. You see, when I tell you who I despise, you might feel like I'm calling you out for cancellation too. Words of hatred are cursed, irrevocable, trust-destroying, earth-salting, and a mark of who we really are.<<ref "e">> This is like a [[Wiki Litmus Test]]; hatred reveals our true colors because it dialectically picks out the object of our [[love]]. //Are you ready?// `/grin`

I find it difficult to deny that wealth isn't highly liquid in its exchangeability for almost any other kind of [[power]] when capitalism has globally commodified everything and everyone so profoundly. Indeed, almost everyone has a price in any context; most adults are evil. Wealthy people are well-positioned to translate their selfish motivation into real-world consequences like they're wearing an increasingly impervious [[ROG]] + Ring of Power rolled into one. I ~~have~~ get to choose someone to be a target of my abundant hatred; I adore it. Let me channel it all (mwhahaha). Here I get to openly claim we should slit this person's throat, and it would have been better they had never lived; it's so delicious. I'm bloodthirsty! I'm shaking and quaking, cummin' rainbows at the mere thought. Eros be my guide. It's not mere retribution; it's restorative justice which prevents the continued centralization of [[power]].

I'm a kid in a candy store here. It's like offering me one of [[these buttons|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7rzIwrEqpw]] for the wealthiest people on the planet. Since this is hypothetical and I'm allowed some laziness, I'm not going to take the time to calculate the cost of living or walk through all the exceptions. I'm giving some round rules-of-thumb here for a first-pass on cutting the chaff. If you make your money as a capitalist, you keep an income above $125k/y (ridiculously high, I'm being hedged conservative here), or you even have a net worth above $3 million (which is where dim marginal utility returns on interest ends, but if you allow me to not be hedged-conservative, I'm probably going to say a //measly// $100k<<ref "b">> even though global equality would be closer to $35k), you don't deserve to live.<<ref "p">> You are killing people, and you are responsible for the suffering of current and future generations. I [[hope]] the global poor beat and eat you alive. I'm happy to press the button for [[Humanity]].<<ref "h">> No problem. Alright, now that the controversial part is out, I get to point to the tippy top of that pyramid. Hello, Pharoah.

It is unclear who the most [[power]]ful person on the planet really is, and it's also difficult to judge who has the least moral merit of the bunch (some evil motivations are worse than others). Is it Jerome Powell? Meh. Sure, Our Orange Clown is incredibly [[power]]ful insofar as he serves the interests of the elite, but he's a delusional loose-cannon sacrificial fodder pawn shell puppet pet (awww...it's retarded!) of the elite (not much of a leash, but they could put him down; they just don't given the options available to them), much like Glossu Rabban Harkonnen to the Baron. I've hated Mitch McConnell for decades; he's like [[Ayn Rand]] to me. Still, he's not the worst I can find. Jinping presides over the largest centrally-planned corporation engaged in brutal capitalism on the planet, but I still cannot firmly gauge what is up to him.

As is my usual custom, when I offer what appears to be an Orientalist Red Scare critique, I will remind you that if we are following the common invisible lines and standard political divisions, The United States is the most dangerous and evil nation to have ever existed.<<ref "t">> I have no intention of otherizing on nationalist grounds. Thus, with that said, I am convinced that Vladimir Putin is the wealthiest and most powerful living person on the planet. He's famously psychopathic, kleptocratic, tyrannical, [[cultic|Cults]], and absurdly dangerous. Most of his wealth is dark. $200 billion is low-balling it. He practically owns Russia, but I do not know how much of that two trillion dollars of wealth he can translate and mobilize into various kinds of muscle in the will to power. Of course, that does not mean we should hand power to some other tyrants to defeat him; there are other ways for us to [[collectively win|TPK]] in the material dialectic.
