title: 2020.01.13 - Prompted Introspection: Found A Relic In A Wish

!! I wish there were a law that said?.. This would be a good law because?.

Fuck. That is a good answer in: [[2017.12.05 - Prompted Introspection Log: Law Wish]]. I hate that I have so little to add two years later. Is this a precursor?

Holy fuck! I was insanely busy on my wiki back then. The pace I kept was absurd. It's amazing to see what I consider cornerstone tiddlers being created that week. That post, in particular, did something special too; there's a tentpeg in it! [[Relic]]ifying it, adding comments.

I take back at least some of the trashtalk I have about wish questions in [[Prompted Introspection]]. That one did something. It set the course of my wiki, even if I didn't know it at the time. Damn right I didn't have space for it in that post! Lol, and I'm glad I tried. I //still// only have the bare framework being pinned down.

The good news is that I have a much clearer picture of what voting should look like, and Lessig's Campaign Finance Reform is leagues behind what I'm shooting for now. =)

[[TOP]], my dudes, built on [[Outopos]]. It is [[right]], which is as [[good]] as I can [[hope]] for at the moment. However, it is also [[beautiful]]ly [[right]] in how it aims for a fairly evolving democratic concept of justice as fairness in weighing our fundamental disagreements about [[The Good]] (including the public good).
