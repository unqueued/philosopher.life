title: 2019.02.22 - Trove Yapok: The wiki/project

 Hey, I'm just a 23-year-old college dropout who randomly stumbled across your wiki thing. Um, I wanted to know why you put so much effort into things. This is a really weird email to write, but I'm gonna go through with it anyways. Maybe your answer could help me put effort into things too. Anyways, I really admire everything that you've done on the wiki, but I'm afraid that I can't understand it. It seems really neat and I wish I could understand it, but what if even after I try, I still can't? That kinda thought makes me umm.. sad I guess. I should send this before I get too rambly. Really sorry for weirding you out and probably wasting your time.

Thanks, I guess, in advance,

      - Zach
