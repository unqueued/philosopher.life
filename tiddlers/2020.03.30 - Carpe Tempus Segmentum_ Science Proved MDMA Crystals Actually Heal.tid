title: 2020.03.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Science Proved MDMA Crystals Actually Heal

* Woke at 10:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Fireman Time!
** [[JRE]] called during Fireman Time!
*** I decided not to pick up since that would have been awkward, right?
* Called [[JRE]] back.
** [[AIR]] missed their date to put together a firepit. There were concerns about the car which reminds us of times where our brother hasn't told the truth.
** [[JRE]] asked me to help him calibrate.
*** I dejavu him in humanizing, he says.
*** Said he felt like he might be milking me. Lol. I like to think I'm a sounding board and useful in providing another perspective.
** The Dialectical Method of Interpreting People
*** Every person I know I split into at least two competing interpretations. I seek to know the most [[Straussian]]ly competent interpretation of them as an evil person, and I seek to paranoicly inspect them as a good angel of a person. I try to tell the story of them to myself with both lenses. It's risk-assessed in both directions.
** [[JRE]] and I considered the differences in messiness of the people in our lives. We are, admittedly, quite messy.
* [[vidyas]]: Completely Graham Priest
** We laughed plenty. =)
* [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]: [[Belief]]
* Dialectures
* Walked with wife
** Offspring made dinner
** We hit the trail, and we've got our 30minute marker at the creek!
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Veggies + Shells'n'Cheese
** [[Magic]] with my son. He bid, DnT probably had it. Concede. He plays his equipment well!
