Call it schizophrenic if you must. I accept the co-morbidity issue means I've not necessarily aligned/connected both sides of the Bayesian hourglass spiral  

On my arrogant view of incompatibilism, Schopenhauer's "A man can do as he wills, but not will as he wills:"

* is correct about Frankfurtian autonomy insofar as the initial source of the resounding commitment of [[SO]] volition is not circularly or internally contained in that [[SO]] volition.
** What is [[The Foundation]]? It will always be an [[infinigress]]ing faith. [[The Dialetheia]], the True Contradiction of faith in freewill is blindingly there.
*** I do not fully justify myself. Only the objective True Contradiction can give rise to self-justification. I am not [[The Infinite]]. It might be constitutive of me and I constitute it to some mystical [[dok]]. 
** Each free act appears to be its own source for that timeslice. If I cannot explain or define the initial object in the noumena, then I will neither be able to explain or define each of those objects (discrete or continuous), nor persistent identity, nor how it both is and isn't the same metaphysical river twice either. There is a physical [[4DID]], but I do not even know how to talk about time for anything outside metaphysics.
*** The past plays into the outcome, but it cannot dictate it at any given choice (for any given timeslice).
** Whatever circularity there is to the justification and //Complete// explanation of my will, it cannot be inside me.

* There is a point at which it could have been otherwise and it was up to us, and there comes a point in willing in which the choice has been made it cannot be otherwise and it is no longer up to us in a sense

* "reject determinism without accepting the view that the behavior of human beings falls outside the scope of natural laws. "

* I posit the mystic believes they access the real thing-in-itself to some [[dok]].

I have a terribly unpopular opinion on freewill: I'm a libertarian freewill theorist. I still hold out [[hope]] for [[h0p3]]. I have explored enough of compatibilism to tell you, my opponents, that you are going to fail on that path. I can see the contradiction I have is just as much your problem too. Freewill is faith. I believe in the self as two-selves combined in dialectic. Both sides, the [[fastmind]] of [[R2H]] ready-to-hand and [[PAH]] present-at-hand have their own perspectives. If you are too internalist, you will not see the necessity of [[The Other]] phenomenologically enough. You will not see [[The Telos]] is a result of both perspectives. It is yinyang of our identities.
