title: 2018.03.13 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Restaurant

!! What is your favorite place to eat?

Throwing me a softball today. I'll take it! 

I'd say my favorite thing to eat is generally contextual. What I'm in the mood for has to do with a bunch of factors, several of which I don't seem to have conscious access to. 

Similarly, my favorite place to eat likely varies in a given context. However, perhaps we can talk about, "on average" what is my favorite restaurant. That seems meaningful enough. 

Oddly enough, what separates this question from my favorite food prepared by someone else is its geographic nature. My favorite food could easily be set aside for being somewhere else. Food is often easier to acquire than location.

Sometimes, I crave Brooklyn Pizza from New Orleans, othertimes the No Name seafood restaurant in Boston, othertimes the Country Ham and Biscuits from Mannsville, othertimes the seafood hut in Chonburi. I think I am reliving my past when I do so. Nostalgia is a strong sensation and perception distorter.

Here's what I crave most: to want to be exactly where I am. I want to desire to have certain desires (you hear me, Frankfurt?).
