title: 2018.10.06 - Prompted Introspection: Reincarnation

!! If you don't believe in reincarnation, forget about that for a minute. What would you like to be reincarnated as? What do you think you WOULD be reincarnated as, if karma had its way with you?

Forgotten for exactly one minute. The timer is on. I would like to be reincarnated as an object living in a universe in which we are all in permanent maximum hedonia and eudaimonia. Barring that, I would like to be born as a computer floating through space (again?). 

The minute is up.

This is dumb. 

Karma is ridiculous. Justice as a prescription is real. Evaluative judgment is real. Justice doesn't actually obtain. I have no idea what I deserve. In a silly, vacuous way, I can agree to meritocracy insofar as we get what we deserve. This is as contentless as saying the virtuous agent is virtuous though.
