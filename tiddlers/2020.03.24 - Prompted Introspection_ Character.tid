title: 2020.03.24 - Prompted Introspection: Character

!! Given the chance to give your child only one quality as a person, which would you choose? How about if that choice were unavailable, what would be your second and maybe third choices? Why are these so important to you?

I almost did away with this question because my answer in [[2018.06.14 - Prompted Introspection: Child Characteristic]] is thorough and correct. Instead, I will attempt to see this question in terms of what parts of moral virtue are particular hurdles or needs in my offspring. What pieces are missing? Where are the places which must become anti-fragile for them? There are some things which aren't up to us either, and feasibility is another practical matter to consider. Further, it is most often the case that my offspring succeed even when I fail to be the father they deserve; there is an unfairness in the principal-agent problem and an [[arrogance]] to how I pick these qualities out. 

[[1uxb0x]] will likely always need an irrational-appearing overshooting of the golden mean toward an optimism bias, especially insofar as particular negatives tend to color the rest of his perceptions too strongly. I agree that some parts are more important than other parts to the whole, but he, like me, is often blinded by preoccupation with the negative. I wish him [[hope]].

[[j3d1h]] will likely always need to overcome her fear of failure with a fear of regret. Her perfectionism, shyness, and shitty father often do not serve her well enough. I hope she will find justified and powerful motivations to take risks wisely.
