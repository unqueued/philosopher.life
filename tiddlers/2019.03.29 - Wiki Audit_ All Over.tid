Changed up the buttons - `firmcode-all` is now a page button (removed from [[Transclusion: Focus]]), and uses ðŸž– instead of the journal button. `firmcode` now uses ðŸž‹.

Upgraded Bob (although I'm not quite sure it upgraded), loaded in the tiddlers.

So far so good with our buttons. We've not had the loop condition occur again either. `/fingerscrossed`

Bye:

* $:/plugins/BurningTreeC/navigator
* $:/plugins/hoelzro/progress-bar
* $:/plugins/BurningTreeC/escapecss
* $:/plugins/hoelzro/full-text-search
* $:/plugins/snowgoon88/edit-comptext

I'll need to ask [[j3d1h]] if we need $:/plugins/matabele/action-maketid

5.1.19 brought me very little so far except that sexy splash (I'll take tits). Bob has been sick, however much a pain in the ass it has been.

Surfing for plugins. I've yet to try Bimlas' brilliant tooling out. I don't want to blow a tab on it though. I do want it to automatically operate in the search bar though. 

I'm trying out elmiger's modified edit button plugin. I've thought about it for a long time. I'm wondering if we can hotkey that shit. It would be worthwhile for mobile alone. I'm fairly paranoid on the phone because I've had dozens (of us) problems.

Danielo's snippets might enable special hotkeys, but I can also say it doesn't seem to enable me to have substitutions.

My daughter needs to look at https://tid.li/tw5/hacks.html#%24%3A%2F_telmiger%2Fextract. We keep talking about this problem. There are certain things which shouldn't be atomized into tiddlers.
