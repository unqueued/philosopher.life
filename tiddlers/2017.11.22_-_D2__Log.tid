Another anni charm, another day. It sucked, but it will be another in my huge collection. =)

I've been doing Pindleldritch runs on my javazon. ~450% MF, shit for survivability, strong clear speed. She's up to 85 now. She can get to 90 doing this fairly easily. Interestingly, not much has dropped of value, except essentially gold for gambling. I need to keep gaining tons of gold for gambling. I'm going to have a gambling and crafting extravaganza at 93. I think the Javazon is more likely to hit 93 because she's actually taking mobs with serious levels on them. I also get to continually shop. I like that.
