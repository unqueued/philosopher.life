!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I would feel no hesitation in saying that it is the responsibility of a decent human being to give assistance to a child who is being attacked by a rabid dog, but I would not intend this to imply that in all imaginable circumstances one must, necessarily, act in accordance with this general responsibility. One can easily concoct imaginary situations in which it would be inadvisable, even immoral to do so [...] [I will not defend] the assumption that it is reprehensible for a powerful nation to invade a weak and tiny neighbor in order to impose on it an "acceptable" government [...] just as I would not take the trouble to justify my belief that one should assist a child being attacked by a rabid dog.

This is remarkably close to my drowning girl example. I adore the contextualized particularism here. I agree there exist some possible worlds and cases in which the moral maxim is to not save her. Obviously, these examples are fairly contrived. To further demonstrate this kind of contrivance, it is also possible to conceive of circumstances or even entire worlds in which you are morally obligated to buy red cars instead of blue, or eat sausage pizza instead of pepperoni. That flies in the face of the moral intuitions of even most moral philosophers I know. It's a convenient mistake to make; it is trying to avoid facing the theoretical details necessary to defining the moral fabric of our lives. Noam is so careful in this respect.

Unfortunately, he is incorrect not to be troubled to justify his belief about the normativity of assisting the child. Excepting, of course, the exceptions, it is obviously correct to anyone with moral virtue. I agree that it requires a guttural moral intuition, an all else being equal kind of casuistry that demonstrates what [[The Golden Rule]] conceptually implies about the moral realist properties of the universe. Sadly, he doesn't seem terribly interested in metaethics and metaphysics; I wager he's a pragmatic linguist and political philosopher. He arrives at most of the correct answer, but the justification and explanation is crucial. Without that [[foundation]], he stands on weak dialectical ground against his opponent, though he clearly has the right to ad hominem to some [[dok]].

I deny the non-cognitivist, strong anticodificationist thesis of Virtue Theorists. You can't just have the intuition and feeling. Being inarticulate, failing to provide a cognitive account, or not even valuing such a thing cannot be virtue. A full intuition will spur cognitive justification and explanation as well. If you aren't interested in both theory and practice, you've already failed to understand the very nature of a virtue itself; you cannot know it as completely nor as autonomously. Let me say that I have doubts that Chomsky isn't interested in theory at all; this may be a rhetorical point.

I am, of course, radically opposed to unjustified imperialism, though I obviously favor philosophical dialectical conversion. Chomsky is careful in his anti-imperalism as well. He takes the time to handle exceptions in his language. It takes some backbone to develop delightfully counterintuitive hedged-conservative safety (anti-fragility even) in one's moral positions.
