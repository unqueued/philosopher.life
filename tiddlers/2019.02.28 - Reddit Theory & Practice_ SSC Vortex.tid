* I've been heading back, rotating, tweaking, swapping...I'm getting horny just talking about it. Ironically, I've been listless, bored, and unsatisfied recently.
** Hey, depression. How's it going?
* I've been drawn back into the SSC dialectics. I really don't like these people, but they are intelligent and influential reactionaries. I simply cannot afford to not pay attention.
* Taoism, Jung, ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM gave me all the taste I needed. I'm done for now.
** Clearly, I go through phases.
* I'm disappointed in AskHistorians [[S2NR]].
** It became a title-sub because there are so few comments/answers. That's better than you'd think, since it allows you to try and think about it yourself, but it's not good enough.
* Protip title-subs are gone. They haven't been doing any work for me recently.
** `/salute`
* [[Link Log]] and sorting by Top allows me to consume many kinds of conversations and get the gists without having to pollute my primary channel.
** I could try having multiple doorways again. This failed. I don't want to live on Reddit. I need the aggregation but not the distraction.
* So, I realize that I'm missing content, but the cost of sifting is so high that I think continuing to jealously guard the size of my multisub is the only option.
* I am so surprised by the number of people I meet who are intelligent and reasonable powerusers of the web who don't use Reddit. How the fuck do they do it? 
** Is it okay for me to just come out and say they are wrong in how they curate?
** Nobody appears to give me better answers or options. Still, perhaps I'm confabulating.
*** The issue may be that you have such a strong point of view about what is [[salient]] in the world that you hunt for [[diamonds]] and [[redpills]] differently.
* I wish I had 1 or 2 more aggregators to round out my stack. There are plenty of interesting sites, but network effect rules.
** I'm seeing that I really do need to see conversation. The best threads require me to open a link and have some initial "wisdom of the crowds" average baseline to argue against. 
*** Admittedly, my lurker-leeching may initially appear to be a failure to participate in the collective dialectic, but I think I'm radically pulling my weight in the wiki (and being a reasonable role-model: you bet your ass I wish I had 100 other trustworthy [[Link Log]] to sift through).
** Fuck me. This belongs somewhere else. Where? [[Link Log]] is taken, dipshit.
