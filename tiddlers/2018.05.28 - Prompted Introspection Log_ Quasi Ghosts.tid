title: 2018.05.28 - Prompted Introspection Log: Quasi Ghosts

!! What do you think about quasi ghosts?

I think that we all sit on various autism and schizophrenic spectrums in our unique Bayesian epistemic encodings that help us attempt to make accurate predictions between our perceptions and the external world (which actually includes the non-cognitive aspects of ourselves). Ghosts, on this view, are the delusional results of schizophrenic imposition of one's models upon the world, at least as I understand it. 

I take "Quasi" here to be a waffling term to make the author feel like they've gently asked the question to opposing views. Fuck that.
