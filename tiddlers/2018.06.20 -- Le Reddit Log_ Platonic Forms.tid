Deflationary metaphysics and reductive materialist positions are de facto positions in popular discourse as philosophy has bowed before science in domains it should not have.

I think metaphysics is the sufficient reason for all that has meaning in physics. I think Russel, Wittgenstein, GÃ¶del, Boethius, Hegel, Spinoza, Kant, Plato, and Aristotle are all roughly (and differently) trying to point to the same blinding thingiest thing in itself. We cannot model the self-modeling model of all models for both conceptual and empirical reasons. I've become a mystic dialetheist who agrees to some objective, external metaphysics which is beyond what any computational theory of mind can interpret (except perhaps itself, but I don't even know what that means).

I take it on faith. A man's gotta have a code, axioms for his reasoning, which ultimately can never be fully justified to himself. We will never have access to a complete foundation (or the foundation for the external standard of coherence). If I understand correctly, incompleteness is a fundamental problematic of all machines/persons interpreting languages which include arithmetic.

I'm a contumacious quietist who hypocritically refuses to be quiet about the ineffable (fuck Cratylus). I have certain doubts about certainties and uncertainties, but whereof one definitionally cannot coherently speak: I will not pass over in silence. I'm not quietly going into that good night or anywhere else; I'm never going to shutup, god damnit! I cannot escape fallibly collaborating with and corroborating to The Good, even if it means I'm relegated to babel-babbling without epistemic closure.
