* My brother called me back! 
** It's damned good to hear his voice. I've been worried about him, but all is clear.
** Matthew's parents skipped visitation, and they are trying to do an end run around the legal system. Prediction is February for when Matthew heads back. 
*** He is very mindful of coming correct before all the parties involved. I appreciate how my brother and Rebecca are profound guardians of this child they know will be raised by someone else.
** His union has let him stay. It's cool to see how much planning, prep, and good work is done well ahead of the shutdowns.
** We talked about the state of the world. It keeps us up at night.
** We talked about how my offspring are doing. I'm grateful that he is thinking about what's going through their minds and how they are feeling.
** My brother has already seen all the shows I recommended (I should not be surprised; I will never be as well-watched as he is).
