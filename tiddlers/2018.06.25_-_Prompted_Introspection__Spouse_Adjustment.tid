title: 2018.06.25 - Prompted Introspection: Spouse Adjustment

!! If I could change one thing about my spouse/lover, what would I change?

Just //one// thing? Damn. That's rough. Please take all of my answers as an agglomerated conjunction. This has to be the healthiest question to answer in front of everyone, including my wife, I've ever seen.<<ref "1">>

How ideal do I get to go here? I'd change her into an all-powerful, all-knowing genie who made the world exactly as she saw fit. I'll get right on that. If I could make her perfectly healthy and happy, that would be totally cool too, yo.

Okay, the practical side of things? This is going to be long list, folks:

# She would constantly be hounding me for sex. I would like to be the one that says "no, I don't feel like it."
#* Let's be clear, my wife has made significant improvements on this issue over the years, and I have definitely said "no" many times. This question is ridiculously open ended though.

# She would take her wiki far more seriously.
#* In particular, I wish my wife engaged in more systematic (i.e. written) planning, dreaming, and working to understand how she wants to spend the last half of her life. I do my best to encourage her, to help her with it, etc., but I cannot think for her.
#* She would start building projects, using it for work, using it for everything.
#* Let's get real though: she's a busy, hard-working woman with a lot of stress in her life. This may not be her thing. I don't know what that means.
