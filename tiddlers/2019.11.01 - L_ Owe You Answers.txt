Hiya!

I owe you answers in this order: My weekend was so fast I hardly saw it, this week has been a chain of working after hours, and my Halloween was filled with me hibernating because I had a sinus headache so bad I could hardly keep my eyes open. Itâ€™s been one hell of a week.

But near the end of it things are starting to look up. [[K]] is taking me on a date tonight so we get some time together.

Yeah, sounds like it's been crazy. Sorry. =(

Glad that you get a date though! That is awesome.
