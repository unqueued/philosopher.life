title: 2019.06.26 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Speak The Truth

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
We humanise what is going on in the world and in ourselves only by speaking of it, and in the course of speaking of it we learn to be human
<<<

I'm strongly convinced that what it's like to be an essential human requires telic language use (beyond mere transmission of information which we can find in various cases in physics). Pre-humans may have had a ready-to-hand mode of some kind, but I don't think Dasein is Daseinic without at least periodically exercising the present-at-hand mode capacity. Our various kinds of languages toward ourselves and the various beings in the world is the exercise of our agential [[power]]. We learn to be moral agents, to find our place and role in and toward [[The Good]] via [[The Right]], [[hope]]fully in [[The Beautiful]] way.

Empathy is an affective and cognitive transcendence of self; it is an interaction with [[The Other]] which requires representation. The result is learning to be who we are, and hopefully, who we're meant to be.
