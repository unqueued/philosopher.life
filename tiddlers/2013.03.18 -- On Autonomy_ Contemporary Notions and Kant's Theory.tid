title: 2013.03.18 -- On Autonomy: Contemporary Notions and Kant's Theory

I’m going to examine contemporary notions of autonomy, present Kant’s theory of autonomy, investigate the moral significance of this autonomy, compare his notion with contemporary notions, and consider a possible problem for Kant’s theory. Contemporary views of autonomy generally hinge upon three fundamental concepts of self-governing: sovereignty, authenticity, and accountability.<<ref "1">> Contemporary theories of autonomy try to offer an account of at least one (if not all three) of these concepts, while Kant offers an account of authenticity and accountability.

By sovereignty, we speak of physical, political, and social self-rule.<<ref "2">> Autonomy based on sovereignty is concerned with coercion, socio-economic status and opportunity, self-ownership, etc. For example, when someone puts a gun to your head and tells you to jump, you seem to have a choice about whether or not you will jump in a significant sense, and yet you seem forced to jump (lacking a choice) in another substantial sense. This latter sense, essentially coercion, is a violation of the sovereignty. 

Sovereignty is a capacity to govern oneself in the most obvious and literal sense: self-governing as political self-governing. Further, sovereignty seems to be a set of sociopolitical goals and rights we seek. For example, children eventually want to make life decisions for themselves; people don’t want a government suppressing their free speech; and, no one wants a gun pointed at his head. 

The second fundamental concept, authenticity, pervades contemporary analyses of autonomy. The central problem of authenticity is figuring out how to differentiate our authentic desires and beliefs from inauthentic ones. When a person isn’t being authentic, he is thought to lack autonomy.<<ref "3">> For example, a person profoundly manipulated by hypnosis may be furnished with inauthentic desires which aren’t a genuine part of the authentic self of that agent, and acting upon those desires would demonstrate a lack of autonomy. Further, depression, drug-use, systematic conditioning, etc. are often considered autonomy-defeaters in authenticity-based models of autonomy.  We must ask: who is the ‘real you’? There are many routes to answer this question.4   Authenticity-based autonomy may or may not be a capacity, depending on which model is considered. Authenticity, however, is certainly a goal. We want to be ourselves, and we want to be governed primarily by our authentic selves. It is unclear how authenticity plays a role in our rights other than pointing out “who” we assign rights or duties to.

Accountability is the last branch of contemporary notions of autonomy. Autonomy, in this light, is an explanation of whatever it is about us that makes us morally responsible agents. Generally, the requirements of accountability include rationality, consciousness, self-reflection, etc. In addition to these requirements, some concept of “choice” is the vital accountability-making ingredient to our autonomy. For the libertarian, choice originates in an agent’s free will. For the compatibilist, choice is just doing what you want to do. In both cases, autonomy requires an agent to be free from external forces (insofar as that is possible) and to be bound only by one’s self in making choices. In contrast to sovereignty, this concept is wrapped up in the metaphysics of self-governing, describing choice at a more fundamental level. Taking the gun example, whether or not you will jump is ultimately still ‘up to you’. You may get shot for choosing not to jump, but that is your accountability-making choice. Models of autonomy which focus upon accountability are primarily concerned with the capacity to choose between right and wrong. Further, being a moral agent, being accountable for one’s choices, and making choices that matter, is a goal. Life is meaningful because we are accountable – nothing really matters without this capacity.  Again, it is ordinarily thought that our moral obligations and rights exist in virtue of accountability-making autonomy. 

Kant’s autonomy deals in freedoms, in both the negative and positive senses. Independence from external forces is freedom in the negative sense, while giving oneself law is freedom in the positive sense.<<ref "5">> Kant’s autonomy is concerned with self-legislating, giving oneself law as an unmoved mover, rather than mere self-governing.<<ref "6">> The significance of the Categorical Imperative (CI), the law which is legislated, is highlighted in Kant’s theory of autonomy. The CI is a law which constitutes our reason, not an empirical law from which we can unbind ourselves. We don’t explicitly and consciously choose the CI. Rather, our reason stipulates this law implicitly, immediately, and unreservedly. Just as the basic laws of logic are embedded in the very fabric of our reason, the CI is constitutive of our reason. Indeed, our reason commands the CI as universal and necessary from even very young ages.<<ref "7">> As self-legislators with reason, we are the authors of the bindingness of this law.<<ref "8">>
 
Since I have very limited space and time, I will only explicate what I consider the central key premise of Kant’s autonomy, which is this: 

<<<
The practical rule is therefore unconditional and so is represented a priori as a categorical practical proposition by which the will is objectively determined absolutely and immediately…For, pure reason, practical of itself, is here immediately lawgiving. The will is thought as independent of empirical conditions and hence, as a pure will, as determined by the mere form of law, and this determining ground is regarded as the supreme condition of all maxims…Pure reason is practical of itself alone and gives (to the human being) a universal law which we call the moral law.<<ref "9">>
<<<

Reason provides the necessary and universal moral law. This moral law is constitutive of our reason. Our reason commands, legislates, binds us to, and has embedded within it the CI. Interestingly, there seem to be both active (the legislating) and passive (the constitution or definition of reason) components of Kant’s autonomy. This premise does an enormous amount of work for Kant, and it is the key ingredient to both Kant’s autonomy and to moral obligation in general. This crucial premise of Kantian autonomy demonstrates not only the bindingness of the moral law, but it is also, on Kant’s view, part of why only this kind of autonomy can ground human dignity and generate moral obligation.<<ref "10">>

Kant’s obsession with necessity and universality motivates this grand claim. Indeed, we must investigate the moral law and its foundation, both of which must be absolutely necessary and universal, else we’ve failed to capture genuine morality entirely.<<ref "11">> Moral reasons by definition are overriding and motiving reasons, and the grounds to moral reasons must be unshakeable, else they may generate overridable or unmotivating reasons. Empirical principles, anything which is contingent or relative, cannot ground morality.<<ref "12">> Desires and inclinations, for example, can neither generate nor provide a foundation to moral obligation because they change (contingency) and they vary from person to person (relativity which lacks universality). Likewise, any possible external values or commands out in the world are not necessarily motivating; these external, relativistic, and contingent laws may rely too heavily upon our desires or inclinations (which are themselves contingent) to seek or obey them. External values or commands cannot ground or generate moral obligation since they lack necessity and universality. Kant’s autonomy, apparently, doesn’t have this problem, since those persons with reason, by definition, are commanded by their reason to author, legislate, and permanently bind themselves to the CI. Since no other theory can generate necessary or universal moral obligations, as they are empirical, contingent, and relative, surely we must realize that Kant’s autonomy is the essential condition of the possibility of morality.<<ref "13">> 	

That is Kant’s autonomy in a nutshell. How does it measure up to contemporary notions of autonomy? Clearly, Kant’s autonomy is not a political concept at all and has little or nothing to do with the modern concept of sovereignty.<<ref "14">> Kant is concerned with the authentic self, although not in the way we normally envision. Kant has a coherentist model of autonomy, where the coherence standard is reason.<<ref "15">> ‘Who you really are’ just is your reason. Very distinct from modern notions: on Kant’s theory, an empirical identity is ruled out, as such an identity could unbind the self from the moral law. The self is pure practical reason, and it is not empirical or a kind of introspection (where we ask: “Should I do A or B?”). If it isn’t empirical, then maybe it is noumenal, but it can’t be anything like the freewill libertarian’s view.<<ref "16">> The categorical self, law giving of its own kind, is not dependent on desire, society, or nature, but instead must be unconditional.<<ref "17">> Built into the notion of Kant’s authenticity model of the self is the third modern hinge, accountability. The sort of accountability-making “freedom” (a.k.a. autonomy), being an unmoved mover, confusingly makes sense and yet remains somewhat odd.<<ref "18">> Kant spends a good deal of time trying to establish that only his version of authenticity which results in our accountability and moral obligation, and it makes sense how these contemporary topics of autonomy have developed as a response (at least in part) to Kant’s theory of autonomy.

Kant’s autonomy needs to be a capacity, a capacity of the will, a capacity to legislate. Admittedly, it is somewhat unclear exactly how the active/passive issue I mentioned earlier is ultimately worked out, but it is clear that such an explanation provides much needed context for this capacity. Kant’s autonomy is a goal which emphasizes the CI, duty, and treating people as ends and not merely as means. Clearly, if Kant is correct in thinking his theory of autonomy is the condition of the possibility of morality, then he’s providing the foundation to any discussion of duties and consequently rights at all (which is a far bolder claim than most theories of autonomy). 

I have a number of concerns, but I will only bring up one. Kant’s conceives of the authentic self as non-empirical, and the result is that desires and inclinations are morally arbitrary and are not a part of one’s authentic identity. This goes against my intuitions.<<ref "19">> I can agree that sometimes my desires and inclinations aren’t really mine, they aren’t part of who I really am, and I can agree that those are morally arbitrary to my authentic self.  I am not convinced, however, that in all cases and at all times my desires and inclinations are morally arbitrary, incidental, inessential, and failing to be part of that which comprises my authentic self. I have desires which I endorse and see as being essential to who I really am as a moral agent. Kant has a very radical view (mostly a good thing), but it may be so radical that it fails to capture, validate, or explain my intuition here.<<ref "20">>
 
What are the effects of disagreeing with Kant here? Can I just re-write this section on autonomy to fit my intuitions? The answers are ‘likely disastrous’ and ‘no, or at least probably not.’ Kant seems to be right in his obsessive pursuit of necessity and universality, and he’s quite systematic about it. That’s what I want my moral theory and agency to rest upon, too! If I take this necessity and universality intuition plus my empirical self intuition, the result seems to be that I am not actually or at least not fully a moral agent. This, of course, goes against my third intuition, which is that I am a moral agent. 

Kant may reply that my intuition for being a moral agent is stronger than my intuition that empirical matters form vital aspects of my authentic self. That might be true. Further, if I really am a moral agent, and if his theory of moral agency is correct, and hence my identity must rest upon what is necessary, absolute, and universal, then perhaps my intuitions are contrary, and I should release the weaker one, namely that my empirical self is (to some extent) essential to my authentic self. This would save my stronger intuition while demonstrating that my weaker intuition was wrong. But that still does not seem to resolve my problem. Kant’s arguments for what counts as moral agency demonstrate the contrariness of my moral agency and empirical self intuitions. Why should I give these up? Why not just jettison Kant’s argument in this case? His argument is not obviously correct, at least not immediately, and maybe it is the weakest of three intuitions I have.

Lastly, Kant might just concede that he isn’t really interested in the authentic self that I’m worried about at all. He could simply attack the notion of the authentic self, as contemporary folks conceive of it, as being largely irrelevant to moral agency and generating moral obligations. If that is the route he would take, then contemporary thinkers must explain why their conception of the authentic self is really so significant or relevant to moral agency.
