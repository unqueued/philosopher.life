!! What extinct animal would you bring back, if you could?

This sent me on a quick search. I don't really have a strong opinion on what creature to bring back, at least not in any normal sense of this question.

I am, of course, kind of redpilled about it. Extinction is just another expression of evolution. Does evolution have a telos? Not obviously. I don't have the same problem other Leftists do with the extinction of creatures. I think it's sad. I think if we can avoid it, all else being equal, we should. Diversity is neat. 

I have philosophical worries about what counts as extinction and species divisions in the first place. I think this is far from obvious. But, I think viruses are alive. I draw lines oddly.

I also don't and can't know enough about what animals went extinct. Imagine a 1 in a billion evolution of some brilliant creature that simply didn't have a mate to reproduce with. Imagine some panacea or huge problem-solving creature that accidentally came into being and blipped out of existence for some reason. Things like this (to some extent or kind) probably happened, and I can't use them as my answer here. 

I suppose my answer is the most anthropocentric answer I could possibly give you:

I want to revive the first archaic human species which engaged in a rich enough proto-language that we would call it speech; presumably, they would be Daseinic. I'd train our brethren to see what they were capable of. This would provide insight into who we are as modern humans.

I have realized that I want my children to study evolution deeply. This is part of knowing who we really are. I must admit, I am very ignorant in this area. Welp, I need to suck it up and find a way to educate us both.
