Hey! No trick or treaters. A lot of wind though. Did you guys have a good Halloween?

I’m revising my short story for class right now. It’s going well.

I got free jolly ranchers out of the deal, so that's sweet.

Yeah, powersteering in our vehicle isn't so great after the chill.

I think I saw their costumes on Instagram. :D and hell yeah. Jolly ranchers are the shit.
