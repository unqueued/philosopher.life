title: 2020.04.22 - Prompted Introspection: Cyborg Sun Explorer

!! Where would you like to watch the sun come up? Why?

Perhaps this question will not stay on the next round, as even my answer in [[2018.08.06 - Prompted Introspection: Sunrise]] is exceptionally brief. It's an optimistic question, but it's not a wish that makes me want to answer "from the vantage point of a utopian world, and so forth." That seems to be rare for wish questions, at least for me. 

I'd like to watch the sun, safely (and I have no idea how, I highly doubt it is physically possible) mind you, from inside the sun. I totally want to see what's inside the sun. Lol. I adore the approximations and tools we have for rendering something. Maybe what I need to do is become a cyborg much further in this case?
