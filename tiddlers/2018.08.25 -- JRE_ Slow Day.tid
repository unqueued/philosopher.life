Chats, not voice. =(

No call from doctor, so that's good. He's still dealing with scheduling. 

Wants to use signal for now (he just wants to use one thing; I think he has no interest in continually trying new things and improving on this front [I don't think he has a rational reason not to spend 5 minutes to try new things and change in this department]) ...I think he likes the pictures sending abilities of it compared to XMPP. He dislikes my potato camera on my phone (I don't use my phone like he uses his, I take it). 

Dinkin Flicka wisdom given to Raylan. Sounds wonderful.

TMI'd my bro.

Bro's spine is killing him. He can't even use a trampoline. 

He sent me pics of an older box that he wired. It looked good.

Talked about caffeine use this month.
