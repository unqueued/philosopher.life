title: 2020.03.23 - Prompted Introspection: Clear Lagoon

!! What book setting would you like to visit, if you could?

Alright, alright, [[2018.06.13 - Prompted Introspection: Book Setting]] is a fine answer, but it doesn't explore. I'm tryna answer that shit, right? Obviously, I would love to get my dick wet in so many book settings (hard to narrow it down ;P). //The Cay// was an awesome book. I want to visit a clear lagoon, to try to live on an island, to enjoy that degree of isolation and beach-paradise. Of course, I need my fucking computer. Unfortunately, the characters weren't hawt, so I need other island-dwellers. Lady Melisandre, would you be my island-cave dwelling slut? Mmmm. I'd love to spelunk.
