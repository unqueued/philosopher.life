*** Alright, maybe I'll have to start VPNing this again. I actually have no idea how many times it has saved my butt.

* Think About It
** https://blog.oup.com/2017/07/hope-predict-philosophy/
*** Well, my bet is on supervenient Platonic magic of [[The Dialetheia]]. Perceiving is a special act.

*** They won't have to become adept, but they will always have to wield screens. My children (and people in our shoes) have no //moral// choice in the matter.

*** I think he'd find me an extremist, and he'd probably call my zealotry evil. The claim that cognition must dialectically regulate emotion to complete moral virtue is absolutely correct. I'm a zealot on that point too. =)

*** I guess I'll never be a writer, or at least never one that matters to almost anyone else. Okay. Imma heretic tho.

*** Building decentralized trust into Rule of Law is the only answer.
** https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/03/blog-brandes-social-media.html
*** Federation is not decentralized enough. We literally have to own the means of production ourselves.

*** I hate how stupid I am. I (probably) know this is amazing, but I can't understand it.

*** There are some legit moves in here, but several which are historically false and mere rhetoric. Unfortunately, he doesn't target the centralization of power. He's anti-statist in this oldie, and that's not where his supporting argument points.

**** Except, who cares that it can't be falsifiable. He ignores the possibility of Platonism! Folks is skeered of metaphysics; it's unpopular.
***** I'm fine with the physical universe as simulation; there is still an objective truth to it, even if it is in causally determined by subjective observation. Shit philosophy here, but I'm not a naturalist.
