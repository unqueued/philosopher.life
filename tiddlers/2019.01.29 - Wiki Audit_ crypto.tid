title: 2019.01.29 - Wiki Audit: crypto

Forward Secrecy. Key rotation for the wiki. How far down the crypto rabbithole do I need to go here?

I am extremely grateful to those who convinced me tagging with worth it. I am, of course, a slow learner.

Thank you!

I have a lot of hardcoded links in my wiki, and in many respects, it scales quite nicely. In other ways, it does not. I am not someone who understands the breakpoints and bottlenecks because I'm too ignorant about TW.<<ref "l">>

Does anyone have benchmarks on how tags and mechanics built around tags computationally scale? I do not understand the limits of the tools in this wiki tool. I can tell you that I am worried about how it will scale for me. I don't think I'm a smart user of my wiki in so many ways, but I use it a ton (and I want to make sure I can continue using a ton). I want to wisely build it over its (and perhaps my) lifetime, and performance matters. I need to know if I should use tags sparingly or not.

What are the most important computational bottlenecks facing Tiddlywiki? I don't want to blindly stumble upon gotchas; I'd need advice on what kinds of Tiddlywiki functions and architectures scale the best.
