title: 2020.03.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Bottom Lip

* Woke at 11:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Vaped with my wife
** Unfortunately, there was a call right before we were going to do the dirty. Fek.
* Uncle [[Charlie]] called me!
** That almost never happens. Dude, sweet.
** He was feeling depressed about not being able to use his computer as well as Apple machines. 
** 3 hours? We needed 10. 
** Found out why he doesn't call often: he's developing his talking points. 
** Hoping we can chat more too.
** Long way to go in learning to use his computer.
*** His 70's Unix-fu will serve him well when we get there, I think.
*** Lots of good technical questions mixed in the bunch too. 
** Begged him to write his thoughts down. I need to read. 
*** He might be the smartest human I've ever met.
** Not too many men in the world I get say "I love you" to repeatedly. I love him, and I like him. 
* Shower of the Gods!
* Inform the Men!
** Sucked my bottom lip until I could not handle it.
** Order was different today. Neat.
* [[Family Time]]!
* Chats
* Quick [[MTG]] games
** Daughter's Dredge vs Belcher. T2 Belch after mull, lol.
** Son's MWC vs UR Delver. PtE, PtE, Story Circle (Daze), Humility (SPierce), Pulse (right out of redline), Wrath, Scoop. Came really close, but Guide hands him 3 lands + 2 Ponders and a Brainstorm did not present what I needed (ended game with 5 lands, lol). He crushed my dreams.
* Wife taught her class remotely.
** I made her blush twice and laugh once with my worm and strip tease. Historiographical analysis of The Bible makes me horny too.
*** It's the onesy that delivers. She is hawt for it. Needs my Santa dadbod.
* Chats
* Ham, zucchini, potatoes with gravy
* [[Family Time]]
* [[AIR]] spent time with me
** Finding a job.
** Played around with discord
** Maymayed
* Sleep by Midnight
