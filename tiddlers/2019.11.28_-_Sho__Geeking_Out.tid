Hey [[Sho]],

<<<
I've been having a fucking fit because, fucking facebook. ARGHHH DAMN YOU TO ALL THE HELLS, ZUCKERBERG!!!

I'm hardly the first person to say that!
<<<

I'm sure many people have said roughly that. I'm being pedantic, but I think it's interesting: I bet you are the first person to ever say it exactly like that. I'll be the second: ARGHHH DAMN YOU TO ALL THE HELLS, ZUCKERBERG!!! 

I wish there was a better ways to escape from that monster's monstrosity.

<<<
We've discussed my issues with fb in the past. And I stand by that, and have been proud to not have it. But Ed is really into a lot of stuff, and it's shitty I cannae see all that. And the few actual good friends I have in the world are all in other countries/continents and I want to see their stuff, their kids growing up, all that pish.
<<<

Surely, we will talk about it many times, lol.

I feel your pain. I've recently been asking some folks if they would want me to join FB (hold on, I'm trying not to puke as type that). I shouldersurf with my wife on her (relatively) new account. I wish I could see way more into their lives. Sometimes it's the only method by which someone will stay connected with us though; I realize I'm not terribly flexible in many respects either, and I'm not convinced most people would consider me worth their time anyway. I like that you use a personal site, and I wish more people did. 

You tell many of the stories of your life photos and even your music, but you also have this rapidfire instant messenger and e-mail approach which I adore (also, I'm sorry that I do not respond as quickly as might be preferred). There's something [[right]] and [[beautiful]] about it.

<<<
So I've tried to set up a new account, a few times! but it won't let me. I've used VPN (different/relevant locations) and special-made gmail emails with matching photo/details. It won't let me verify anything with my mobile number, because that number has been used with another count previously. Duh.
<<<

Cutting down on bots is a hard problem. Still, I'm profoundly opposed to being forced to tie my identity to a phone number (or a domain name). Who controls those names? Not us! There's too many security problems with it too. 

You might try a burner or a service online.

It's fascinating to see how various social networks aim to be more selective in who can join, and why. I suspect somewhat* more privacy-respecting tooling will generally belong to the wealthy and to the networks which select for the wealthy (like dating apps for rich people that require verification).

<<<
But I deleted that. But still, no way to choose another number or method, nor to contact anyone to say hey, i don't have a phone (for instance), what now? It also asked me a couple of times to literally send them a copy of my ID. Are you fucking SHITTING me??!!?!?!??
<<<

That is terrifying. I'm not saying there's not a time and a place for social media networks which are verified in this way, but all the reasonable sorts I can concieve of ought to be run by a //legitimate// government, not a corporation. Your Official Social Credit Score^^tm^^ just isn't good enough.

<<<
If they were HALF that fucking concerned about who they allowed to advertise on there, Hillary would be President and we'd have skipped this Brexit nightmare! ARGHHHHHH
<<<

That may be true; I just don't know. Systematic [[Memetic Warfare]] occurred, and is still occurring, all over the place. I was convinced Trump had won before the primaries, but that may have just been a lucky guess. Obviously, I'm opposed to capitalist advertisement (there are better ways to pay for the services necessary for democracy). 

<<<
Anyway, so I thought fucking hell. If I could just get someone else to set one up, but let me use it. I thought, my step-dad is not on facebook and is not going to be (he was. It didnae go well. If you think people find ME offensive.... hahahaha) so I said hey, can I use your gmail/details to make a thing? And he's like sure. 
<<<

Lol. You must trust him a good deal. I couldn't imagine handing that to anyone except extremely close family members. 

What makes your step-dad so offensive to other people?

<<<
So, I put the VPN on for the States, set up a facebook account. Verified it via his gmail. All that. Was all good. Uploaded a profile photo that he is in. Real name/birthdate. etc. Was going through security settings and it says oh, wait, we need to verify (again?). So it send a code to my parent's mobile number, in the states, and I got my mum to tell me, and put it in. Verified. Then another page later it says, sorry, suspicious activity. We need to review. Upload a photo of yourself and only yourself for us to check. So I uploaded a photo of Dave from when they were here in August.
<<<

That is hilariously convoluted. They probably have a world-class team of experts + an army of cheap human labor trying to prevent what you are doing.

<<<
Still waiting to hear, I guess. From the last two times it did this to me, I ken it's usually a day before you get an answer - which so far I've gotten by going to log-in and being told the account was deactivated.

And then I get REALLY pissed off because I FUCKING HATE YOU YOU FACEBOOK CUNTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yet they're still getting the better of me! Even though I'm one of the few people on earth who actually has ditched them! Like... I ken, a bit contradictory, but ken what I'm saying?

ARGHHH!
<<<

It's so weird to be rejected trying to enter a club you don't really want to be a part of all the way down in the first place. 

<<<
Hey, how are you?
<<<

I'm doing well. It's been pretty busy. We're moving soon, homeschooling takes up a lot of time, and I finally finished (after 5 months) a long letter to a friend: [[2019.06.25 - DeathOfRobinhood: The Chickenscratch Confession Booktour]].

How about you? How are you?

<<<
So, just wanted to say hello after all the software saga. 
Thank you, again, for your help!!
<<<

It's not a problem. I'm sorry I couldn't be more useful. I know this is important for you guys.

<<<
Ultimately, that laptop just doesnae have the juice to run Ableton. Ed was having an over-the-phone sort of tutorial with his producer mate in London, and the thing is just not coping. I dinnae ken what the processor/RAM is like in that thing, but it won't be good. That's one of the reasons I upgraded to this thing last year. (Albeit the Core i7 was nowhere near as fast as I thought it would be. Still, fucking lightspeed compared to the older one! haha)
<<<

While I'm not familiar enough with the software, I am surprised by this. I'm sorry to hear that. 

<<<
Ed's decided that, while he'll probably have to invest time and money in purchasing/learning real computer/software/DAW stuff in the longer-run, he's only got a few months right now, and he doesnae want all of the creative impetus and energy sucked away and drained by constantly fighting with drivers and lag and compatibility issues and things, so he's getting some kind of external/portable mixing/sampling/sequencing thing that he's got more experience with and is more intuitive to use etc, and is going to do this project with that. 
His professional pal seems a bit disappointed as he is ALL about the computers but, anyway. He understands.
<<<

It sounds like he is pressed for time. It makes sense to just get something created first and then go back to using the DAW.

<<<
Most likely Ed will need to get himself a Mac, whenever all that stuff really goes forward, and I'm not getting involved in that. I ken Macs are far superior for media, basically, but still. I'm a word processor, for the most part, and Windows does me fine ðŸ˜‚
<<<

Aye, many people in that industry use a Mac. It may be more stable and you'll have fewer concerns about latency because the official Mac hardware space is very narrow. You may have to hunt for particular hardware as a Windows user. I suspect many professionals pick superior and cheaper hardware that can't be found on a Mac, but it's not fun getting that all figured out.

<<<
Anywhoo, my attempts to establish facebook access have failed, again. It was all legit/correct details (my step-dad's); every time I did something with that I connected from a USA-server; not really sure how they've figured it out.
Could it be something in the hardware/device itself that they've identified?
<<<

I'm not sure why it isn't working for you. I can guarantee that FB tracks major VPN provider IPs, and that is a red-flag. It is also possible that you weren't using a VPN the entire time, and it would be made clear your account is being used from two geographic regions (they'd know you didn't fly over the ocean that fast). I'd use a fresh copy of Firefox too, but I have no doubt they fingerprint your browser too. 

<<<
The annoying thing is I literally cannot open a 'legit' account, in my own name, because 1 - there are debt collectors in the states who would LOVE to track me down!! and 
2 - everything I said about how it won't let me verify with my real phone number, but there are no alternatives, so. Also, they want MY ID, and they ain't fucking getting that! How fucking creepy!!!!!

If you think of any way I might be able to get around that, let me know... I wondered, if I had someone else, like not me, not this device, set up something... maybe in their own name etc., but let me have the log-in details? But fuck, man. What a lot of hassle, just so I can see photos of people's brats.
What's that worth, right? ðŸ˜‰
<<<

Yeah, that shit sucks, yo, fosho. Nuff of this, fuck it. It seems like you have a working account, but, just in csae, I've made an FB account for you, and a protonmail account to match (it is not currently attached to any other backup e-mail). I'll be sending you the details. You must change the passwords, please. I hope you like Terry Pratchett and hate Margaret Thatcher. I have no idea if you'll get flagged or lose the FB account though. Hopefully, it won't be necessary.

If this fails, we'll keep trying.

<<<
(Reassure me, here. Your 'brats' are amongst those I care about ðŸ˜‚)
<<<

XD. 

<<<
Anyways, I'll awa the noo.
Hope you're taking care of yourself, and each other.

GOOD LUCK WITH FINDING A PLACE TO LIVE, by the way!
And with finding some non-fuddy-new-england-cunts to hang out with when you get there!! hehehe
<<<

Thank you. We need it. Still hunting and applying. So far, we've not had any luck.

Rofl, yeah, I probably won't fit in terribly well (though I have a better chance up there). I have high hopes that [[k0sh3k]] will find people to hang out with.

<<<
just to say, it let me create one on my phone... with same name/number i used to have, so maybe that's why?
i tried on the laptop but maybe it's got something against this thing...
Hope it lets me sign into this shite on here! haha

Anyways ...
later!
 :) 

---

So... it let me create a thing... add friends... I was FINALLY just about to start looking at Ed's profile... and it goes oh, wait, suspicious activity. Upload a photo of yourself, only yourself.
So, I did... I reckon in 24 hours they'll tell me it's disabled.

At which point I really will give up.
Just... WTF.

Ridiculous.

Anyway, happy Wodan's-day evening!
<<<

Well, if it doesn't work, try the one I made for ya. Don't give up, or do...because it's FB. Lol. Whichever. =)

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
