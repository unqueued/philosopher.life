title: 2019.06.30 - TDL: Another Screen?

* You should setup the second screen, clean off the adjacent desk area.
** Needs a power cord. A $12 gamble on a sleek 22" screen.
** i3 mods. Might as well have a place for vidya or whatever. It will be a learning experience.
* So much paperwork to do. Keep slogging through it.
* I need cover letters for those teaching positions.
* Please do some daily work in your philosophy books. You've been slacking.
* We'll need to go shopping soon
* We have a great number of things to do in our wikis. The private+public change for my wife will be huge.
* Oh, you have a [[Monthly Audit]] tomorrow!
