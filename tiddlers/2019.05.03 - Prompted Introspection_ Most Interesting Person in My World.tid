title: 2019.05.03 - Prompted Introspection: Most Interesting Person in My World

!! Who is one of the most interesting people you have ever met?

What counts as met? Interesting to whom and the usual [[gfwiwcgws]]? Presumably, I cannot know enough about all the people in my life to know the answer to this. 

My wife is the most interesting person I've met. She is a beautiful contradiction, a person of [[good]]will, and she has a listening depth I've found in no one else. I think I carry out a lot of the idealist work for her now, and she is more pragmatic for me. I assume it will occur with me as well with age. It is rare that people cause [[awe]] in me, but she causes it again and again over the years.
