!! The top 5 things to do in the city you live.

For whom? Me? 

# Using the Internet at home.
# Taking a walk.
# Eating Indian and Mediterranean cuisine.
# Shopping at Aldi
# Swimming

Honestly, there isn't much I care for here besides the beautiful mountains. I love the fresh air when I can get it (and can will myself to do so). I also can't really afford some of the other options.

Kayaking is a big deal around here. Camping to some extent. Not really much else that I think I would adore. I suppose if I were more social that would change. There is magic to play, and perhaps dances and other events to attend. I live within 5-10 miles of at least 2 universities. There's always stuff to do there. 

Maybe I need to open up. I know I've serious depressive tendencies. I will think on it.
