title: Meaningness: Stances are unstable

<<<
Because the confused stances fail to match reality, they are all unstable. 
<<<

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down there, partner. You have this beautifully insidious umbrella term. You have not pointed out the fundamental, essential notions for them all (you think you have though), and you certainly haven't shown us why they fail to match reality. I think you need to discuss the concept of unstability carefully, and I will judge whether or not you escape this criticism as well.

<<<
As mind-states, they come and go. We flip-flop between them.
<<<

Agreed. It is a very hard problem. 

<<<
Because we aren’t aware of stances at all, we don’t notice this happening. We don’t see how dramatically we contradict ourselves.
<<<

Not in my case. I am quite aware of it. In fact, I can put more meat to the content of these stances than you seem to. That you identify this classic existential problem so plainly (in some respects), however, is why I'm paying attention. I want to see why you are a failing and succeeding.

<<<
 Stances allied to nihilism come with defiant negativity, and those allied to eternalism make you sound like a Hallmark greeting card.
<<<

That does not seem conceptually necessary. Perhaps it is your empirical, anecdotal evidence. I suggest that your "having your cake and eating it too" complete stance is actually nihilism with the veneer of eternalism. You aren't flip-flopping because you hold a contradiction. I will be interested to see if it is stable outside of a delusion. When I inspect it, does it actually hold merit. I fear you will suffer the same fate of [[Ribbonfarm]] which is about learning to lie to yourself in just the right way to achieve happiness.

<<<
For example, in the stance of respectability, it makes sense to have an ordinary job and fit in. But this involves cutting off your creativity, which is unacceptable. Recognizing this, you may move to the stance of victim-think, if you feel coerced into conformity. That makes you angry, and you think of forcibly changing conditions, in an unrealistic way: the stance of romantic rebellion.
<<<

See, you do understand the common phenomenological moves and themes at times. I respect that. However, I'm on guard now (since you have done a terrible fucking job) that you are simply someone who understands enough human psychology to swindle them without actually solving any of the philosophical problems at hand.

<<<
The antidotes to this whole process are the complete stances. Unfortunately, they too are unstable. They are unstable not because they fail to fit reality, but because they don’t offer the emotional pay-offs the confused stances do.
<<<

I very much appreciate this line. Poison-thoughts are crucial to breaking out of our thought-loops. I like that you recognize the instability. I like that you are willing to say that the truth doesn't make you happy the way you want (at least not in any short term sense). You still haven't been able to tell me why the other stances don't match reality, nor how yours magically does. This is a huge missing piece. 

<<<
Once one has decided that the confused stances are unworkable, and that the complete stances are accurate, one can work toward stabilizing the complete ones.
<<<

Sounds like sublation to me. I can admire this aspect. I may just being doing the same with yours though.

<<<
Also, one can work on further destabilizing the confused stances, so they do not persist. Simply recognizing them, and seeing the logic of how they flop from one to the next, is one way to do that.
<<<

Ah, and here is a problem for you: why should we think the the constant flip-flop rotation isn't stable? There is a kind of stability to that process, even if it isn't The Calm. More problematically, why should we think that stability is possible or the practically correct thing to do? You must motivate your theory beyond calling the others names.
