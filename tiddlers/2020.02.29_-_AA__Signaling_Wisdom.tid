Yo, how has your week been?
Fri 1:10pm
Behind but doing ok
Fri 1:11pm
How are you? Wanna grade some papers?
Fri 1:11pm
Please, no.
Fri 1:12pm
Lol
Fri 1:12pm
I'm sorry. That sucks
Fri 1:12pm
It's so draining to do.
Fri 1:12pm
I'm glad you are still doing okay even in the whirlwind.
Fri 1:12pm
It is now time to employ the last minute grading procedures
Fri 1:12pm
Yes. Unfortunately, mine are always last minute, lol. I'm not sure I know how to do it otherwise.
Fri 1:13pm
Grading tests and quizzes and then random assignments until I reach the 3 tests/ 6 quizzes and 9 homework they require or at least one or two from each section
Fri 1:14pm
Sometimes that means their homework grade reflects their homework average....canâ€™t let it jump too much at the last minute for homework
Fri 1:16pm
Makes sense. Useful triage.
Fri 1:19pm
Yep and parents donâ€™t complain like they do when grades plummet at the last minute
Fri 1:51pm
Yeah, that is useful and makes it great that they might have a reliable indicator to build upon. I think that likely encourages engagement all around.
