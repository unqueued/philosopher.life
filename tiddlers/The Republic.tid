title: The Republic

As usual, //Socrates// is demolishing everyone. The ability to deconstruct someone else's argument can never be fully done on someone else's terms, you must take something up yourself. Plato points to this explicitly, and I have a hard time denying it. That said, most of the work is still deconstructive.

Also, what //is// the art that thinks about [[The Good]] of itself? I suggest Aristotle's God points to this thing! Philosophy is the art which thinks about wisdom of itself, the wisdom of becoming wise.

Plato would have us gaslight our soldiers, tell them it was a dream, give them false motivations for their violent work.

He clearly doesn't believe in the Gods. There are many misdirections to untangle in this web.

As usual, I have made no progress answering this saint.
I do not understand what it means to master myself or to what dok I can.

He is such a grandmaster. Even staged, it's brilliant.
Justice is everyone performing his own task... That is a fucking truism.

Unless this is an argument for fascism

I hear The Statesman calling.

I am especially pleased to hear the argument of the possibility of an ideal that many people deny is possible

I consider "that's not possible" to often be a cop out and an artificial attempt to narrow the Over tonight window.

The claim, "that's not likely," is more reasonable. But, then it becomes an empirical matter that almost borders on a Pascalian wager.

Overton window

The Good is The End.

It cannot be a mere appearance. Preach.

Plato distinguishes The Good from The Beautiful, but also sometimes collapses The Beautiful into The Good. This sounds like The Dialectic to me.

I think he is missing something obvious though.

The Right

The Right is The Good in the context of agency which requires alternative possibilities.

I need to pull a Spinoza and write The Proof.

When will I be ready for such a thing?

As usual, the section on tyranny and democracy are confusing to say the least. It's not clear that that is what would occur in real life or what Plato's agenda really is. Democracy appears to be the tyranny of the mean or the median average. Again, [[The Original Position]] is essentially a reflective equilibrium attempting to create the philosopher-king: to evolve the beneficent tyrant.

In my [[Realpolitik Speculation]] of Plato, I think that he is an aristocrat that is still interested in centralizing power. I understand that philosophers ought to be those in power. In many cases, he's correct about the philosopher-king. I think we should have some hesitation or doubt about Plato's complete motivation.

It's difficult to know what the difference between a king and a tyrant other than just wisdom itself. But, that might have some question begging to it. This is one of the problems with unification and the centralization of power (built on the decentralization of democracy) even for the sake of the rule of law.

Pleasure as shadow picture, as simulation...preach, yo.

The argument about the tyrant ve Kings pleasures is so forced that I can't believe Plato means it.

Is Plato saying, those who agree with me deserve to be in power? I think so.
