* Sex
* P2P RSS toolchain 
** watch for changes -> mtime order -> strip given internal tiddler modify time, scrape title and tags -> translate to URL -> populate list -> translate to atom -> push over Ratox
*** We could also build a public one, but I'm still far from convinced it will be useful unless they are paying a huge price as a reader: programmatically sifting for [[salience]] after having done it by hand long enough to know [[W5H]] they are looking for. 
* I like the idea that you build your living room in the classroom. 
* Your wife is extremely anxious. =(. 
** Your mission, should you choose to take it: calm, cool, collected. Listen. Giggle and even jester where necessary as thoughtpoison, continue to build confidence (she isn't insane like you), hold her, breathe, think with her about the various interactions (she feels like she has disappointed her friends and coworkers unacceptably, and Mary did not take it well [as predicted, though not reasonably]), illustrate from our other moves, mourn with her, but she needs you to bridge reason and emotion in weaving at minimal cost to her.
*** You run point on logistics, especially since we want to find a way to be with [[AA]]. [[JRE]] seems interested in having my children for a time, but it can't be during the move (since this is a crucial event for them to experience), but it can happen before. 
**** Though you would need to pack way, way in advance, and that is a lot of upheaval to experience all at once.
***** Eh, they probably need the practice.
* I think you should wait a day for shopping. Burn the remainder of fresh.
** Weird to think you might only go shopping a few more times at that Aldis, ofc.
