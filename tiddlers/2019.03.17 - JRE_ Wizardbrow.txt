Making it your own. It's beautiful.

Going to put up the lights first, hook it up to existing power, and figure out how i can swap the panels out without calling lg&e
SUN 5:46 PM
I wasn't certain i needed to take the ceiling down, but now that its down im glad i did.  Lots if electrical boxes covered up
SUN 5:48 PM
Aye.
SUN 5:49 PM
How's Rebecca feeling about the basement?
SUN 5:49 PM
And they pieces of 2x2 boards all over the place to secure the drywall to, so there were like 50 nails into the 2x2 for each drywall, but only like 2 nails through each 2x2 into the joists
SUN 5:49 PM
I could pull the 2x2 out by hand
SUN 5:50 PM
Rebecca doesnt care about it really
SUN 5:50 PM
Just wants me to have a place to be happy
