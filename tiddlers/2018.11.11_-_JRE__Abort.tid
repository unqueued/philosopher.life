My brother tried calling my daughter, but it didn't work. I think it's awesome that he called her. He called me on the way to see my granddonor (actually, to see [[AA]], [[L]], and [[K]]).

He's feeling as sexy as ever. Now that Raylan is gone, Rebecca is paying more attention to him. There are different ways to interpret that; I lean toward a positive interpretation of it. My brother knows best; he has all the information. Whether he gets to be with her for 10 weeks, 10 months, or 10 years, I hope he makes the most of it.

We talked about teachers and foster parents being treated like shit by a section of society. We were tracing out the origins and thought process behind it. I'm disgusted by that evil.

We talked about abortion, how we've switched. I favor taking human lives in many cases. I am no longer a pacifist, and I don't believe in the sanctity of human life. Personhoood, in its degrees, is the measure. [[The Moral Law]] begins to exist in our inferential reasoning at around 16months. Our problem, of course, is that anyone would ever be put in a position that they feel it necessary to abort. The solution, as usual, is decentralizing power appropriately.

My brother joked about handing the phone off to the granddonor and me hanging up. He neared the restaurant and I decided to pull a [[JRE]] and loudly proclaimed that I loved him and that I had to go. He laughed, and I giggled. My brother is very much inside my head.
