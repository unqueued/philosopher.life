title: 2018.06.12 -- Deep Reading: The Last Firewall

I can't believe I'm going for another book, but it may be useful.

It's interesting to see neural implants, meaningless existences, purposelessness, etc.

I see several of my interests in [[The Original Position]] are found in this book.

[[The Matrix]] titledrop! You gotta. Glad to see it. It is serendipitous given my work from yesterday.

Unemployment would be wildly higher than 50%...

Super Gattaca-esque.

I'd like to point out that the crowds would not be dissenting. I think AI would have computed this problem effectively enough (even if they can't fully model it, obviously).

I think this book is also wildly optimistic. Against the extremely rational, the highest utility is clearly one that revolves around enslavement (even if we are just creatures in a zoo). Seriously...the AI doesn't really need us.

Replay attack. =)

Privacy is radically different in this world. It's clear there are elements. I think that is not likely the case in a coherent version of this story. AI might not be able to break encryption, but they have a world of metadata available for them to heuristically reverse engineer the information.

I think AI in this story just isn't nearly omnipotent and omniscient enough.
