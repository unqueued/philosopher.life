title: 2017.08.25 - Highdeas Log

I've decided that this wiki does fulfill another function. For a while, I hoped it didn't do this, but now I'm not convinced it is something to worry about as much. My wiki is a way to not feel lonely. It seems to work. I get to care about myself here in a way that is practical, interesting, and worthwhile. It's clearer to me that I didn't directly communicate clearly enough to myself my loneliness in the {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]} page.<<ref "1">> The signs are all there, but I didn't connect the dots.

<<footnotes "1" "It always annoyed me that my father put down my loneliness and loved to make fun of being emotive, lacking certainty about specific issues, and being certain of a view that opposes his. I am glad to be rid of that feeling.">>
