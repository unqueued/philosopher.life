title: 2017.03.15 -- Pornography and Prostitution

There are fairly high rates of pornography use among all genders. This makes sense, since virtually all of us like to have sex, think about sex, watch sex, etc. to varying degrees. The differences between consumers of prostitution and consumers of pornography tell us something important though. 

As a preface, of course, I'm not here to blame the victim. Many prostitutes don't have a choice in the matter. Many are literally forced into it. Others are enslaved more indirectly. And, of course, some see it as the best means to happiness. It's a broad spectrum. Further, there are deep problems of psychopathy, abuse, use, and treating as mere means in most directions in the world of prostitution.

It seems perfectly obvious to me that moral prostitution is at least conceptually possible. Utilitarianism knows this. Moral prostitution is not just a theoretical possibility. In fact, I think it happens all the time. Without a doubt, there are cases of prostitution which we all accept as if it is perfectly normal, we simply call these practices by other names (we don't even think of them as prostitution). Again, this isn't advocating prostitution; description but not prescription.

What is prostitution? The selling or trade of sex.

Here's a fact:

* Men are overwhelmingly more willing to pay for sex in more contexts, instances, and cases than women. 
* Male-to-female transgenders are by far more common than female-to-male.

Being wanted for sex matters. It's much easier to accomplish as a female. There is clearly a sexual marketplace, and men tend to be the buyers. There is a deep selfishness embedded in the sexual game. We see it in every species.
