title: 2017.06.16 - Pipefitting Log

Today was a short one. I had already studied for the exam. I studied more anyways. Motor vehicles seem like something you need hands-on experience with. There is only so much you can read about. 

I talked to Johnny today. It's always important to pick others' brains in the industry. I wanted his perspective. He thought our simulator was quite cool. He does top helper work and not so much pipefitting itself. I found out that I should just find or make a bevel-checking tool. Johnny has done it so much he doesn't even check it anymore. It just "looks" right to him, and he has a "feel" for it. Virtue theoretic, I tell yahwhat.

On our break time, I went to the shop and finished cutting the blocks for my alignment dogs. Everyone has asked about them. We're worried they won't be tall enough. I have to work with what I have though. I need to make a few cuts, but we'll get there. I chose some very thick metal. I'm not sure how much it costs, but I bet it aint cheap.

Afterward, I took the exam. I aced it. I think it wears on the guys around me when I get 100's and everyone else is struggling to pass or still missing a few. It is what it is. 

I cleaned the shop up, then I went home.
