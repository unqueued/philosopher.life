title: 2020.01.17 - Prompted Introspection: Learn the Esoteric

!! I wish I could learn..... because.....

I wish I could learn [[Ithkuil]]. I'd be the first to speak it, and I think I'd learn something about the nature of language that can't be learned otherwise. Some of the basic philosophy of mind and language questions may be easier to answer, at least anecdotally, by having pushed the limits of language use with [[Ithkuil]]. I'd like to be a translator. Perhaps nothing would unfold or be unlocked by it, and it would be completely esoteric. I would be disappointed by that, but I would still find it [[beautiful]].
