*** For example, the lightning thief
** Congrats on passing your 90 day prohibition.

I am grateful you are thinking on their behalf constantly. Thank you for having our children have a socially acceptable form of education.
* h0p3
** I am grateful that I continue to attempt to hedge ourselves against what I think is terrifying predictions of the world in a way that is robustly conservative without being wasteful

* 1uxb0x
** I'd like Philosophical Analysis to go into the more template.
** You don't have anything in monthly or yearly.
** Thank you for having a plan.
** It's still made of scraps, but it's patchwork I guess.
** Suprised with how verbose some of these are.
** We also need to work on  your semester stuff
* j3d1h
** You still have no plan (fixed)
** I would like to hear next week a plan for the semester from you
** Make sure you are prepared for high school and college
** It feels like (Other than your standing TDL) I have more work than you, yet I think you do just the same.
* k0sh3k
** I would like you to find a way to divse TDLs with me
** Thank you for putting my hair routine down
** I find it a bit hard to find stuff.
** It's still a work in progress.
* h0p3
** I'd like to see something on your plans that is for you and not your kids.
** I'm happy that you have stuff for us to do in your wiki.
** I think you are leaving outdated stuff in too often.
** I've not been checking my yearly template as much as I should and I should do more of that.
