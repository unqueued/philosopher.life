title: 2019.12.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Jam-Packed

* Woke at 11:30
** 6.5 hours is not good enough. Your head is hurting again. Inflammation. Shaves years off ya.
*** Only need to make it until 40, 47 for his frontal lobes.
* Read+Write
* My wife ran some errands, and the offspring read most of the letter to [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. 
** Fascinating to hear their comments.
*** I'm lucky that they know how crazy it is that I'm asking anyone to understand it, and they know it's crazy that they understand it too, lol.
**** There's some crazy fancy footwork in that letter. `/giggle`.
* My wife slept like a goddess, and I could tell. She's back! Filled with energy, chipper, giggling, dunking on me. Thank the maker. 
** I regret that we didn't pursue that anti-anxiety medication earlier. This is my fault. 
*** How the fuck do you have this much evidence and you don't move on it? Asshole.
**** You have plenty of evidence that meds have failed her again and again. Money is tight too. The doctor wasn't listening either (they rarely do).
* Chats
** [[K]] has been in the hospitable, but he is recovering.
*** [[L]] is feeling the heat, and that feeds in too.
* Inform the Men!
** Wow. Those are amazing meds. Lol.
* Shower of the Gods!
* Per advice, my wife and I agreed to unschool and let them wander (still having chores) at least until after the move, and my wife thought until Summer would be fine (I was surprised). We will see. We are trying yet again.
** Grow wings, children. Fly. Find your character.
* Pizza and Burgers
* One-on-one's
** Broke le news of unschooling
** My voice is too loud.
* Family Walk 
** Cold, and also daughter still wanted to walk despite sprain. Neat.
* Family Log
* Reading Wikis
** Technical problems for my wife's work sync plaguing us, possibly.*
* My daughter told me today after reading this week's [[New]] during [[Family Time]] that she thinks I'm far more unified than I used to be. She doesn't think [[RPIN]] makes any sense. Her praise is too high. 
** It was interesting to see her speak of her own [[Self-Dialectic]] in this regard as well. I have 49 months left with her. There's never enough time.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 3?
