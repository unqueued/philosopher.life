I think I was so busy in my teens and 20s that now I just value not having to do anything

The joy of just being there.

True story, bro

I was just thinking about Dr. Hoag recently. You remember when he would smile in class?

That's when you knew you were in real trouble.
MON 4:14 PM
Like you had dug your own grave, lol.

I considered applying for a philosophy teaching position at Berea.

Not going to happen.
MON 4:15 PM
That's not the one Jarrod's got, is it?
MON 4:15 PM
He's the only person I ken working there
MON 4:16 PM
I do not know which position is open.
MON 4:16 PM
You're better off out of there
MON 4:16 PM

MON 4:16 PM
Oh this is recently. Thought you meant long ago. Think Jarrod is there about 3 years, maybe. Or 2
MON 4:16 PM
But I'm certain he'll not stay
MON 4:17 PM
Why's that?
MON 4:17 PM
I really loved Berea.
