title: Outopos: Physical Mesh

We can use Atropos as a physical mesh network protocol. It can enable ISP's not to worry about building the last mile and instead just relying upon the neighborhood to use wireless mesh. This is a huge infrastructure improvement, and it would enable new ISP's really compete.
