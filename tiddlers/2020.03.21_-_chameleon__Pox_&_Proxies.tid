title: 2020.03.21 - chameleon: Pox & Proxies

"""
[6:22 PM] h0p3: With nail polish remover, you can take the ink off magic cards (basic lands usually). Tape the edges. You then can scratch up the surface (steel wool or something similar) so that you can print on it. Makes some very real feeling proxies. Photograph quality paper always looks good in sleeves. I like the hand drawn. Sometimes, i just write on the back on magic cards, lol.
[6:23 PM] chameleon: I've been making them with sharpies, I think I showed you some :slight_smile:
[6:24 PM] chameleon: but I wanted a really cool counterspell
[6:24 PM] chameleon: I found a good one, but either the aspect ratio was wrong or gimp fucked up
[11:58 PM] chameleon: keep it secret, keep it safe
[11:58 PM] h0p3: gracias
[11:58 PM] h0p3: will do
[11:58 PM] h0p3: storing privately; can be deleted from chat now

[11:34 PM] chameleon: I showed pox to The Abyssal
[11:34 PM] chameleon: he says "slow, grindy, tortuous magic is my favourite kind" :wink:
[11:34 PM] chameleon: he really liked it haha

[11:36 AM] h0p3: It's a hilarious deck. Pure troll. I'm glad he liked it too.
[11:36 AM] h0p3: If he ever wants to connect, I'd be honored.
[11:37 AM] h0p3: I bet we'd have plenty of magic to talk about too.
