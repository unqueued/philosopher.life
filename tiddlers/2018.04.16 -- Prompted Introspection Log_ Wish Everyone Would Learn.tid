title: 2018.04.16 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Wish Everyone Would Learn

!! I wish everyone would learn to ..... Then everyone would.....

Oh, Lady Melisandre, you honor me with your presence once again.

I wish everyone would build their lives around being philosophical, seeking wisdom, as best as they could. 

Also, because it's a running joke at this point: socialism (which is just one consequence of my actual wish).
