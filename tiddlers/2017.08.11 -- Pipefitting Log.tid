title: 2017.08.11 -- Pipefitting Log

We were explicitly told we didn't have much to do. We were able to get a hot work permit, and I cut and did some coping out with the grinding disc on a piece of angle iron we'll be using to support some pipes. I actually made something. It wasn't perfect, but the last piece looked quite good.

We also received the paperwork training for lifts. We'll practice with the rigging team soon. 

We got rained out and left early at 3. We literally did almost nothing all day. 

The team thinks this job is very odd because they've been sitting there for weeks (longer than usual). Every member that has worked with Yates before said Yates is slow to begin a job. Disorganized, but safe.

I talked extensively with Colleen, David's mom. She is very surprised that Chris and I were able to join; she considers us lucky, but is happy we are there. 

I have an idea for David Mull. We might not even need to wait for the major pipe line to reach the tie-in point. If we were willing to waste a few inches of pipe, we could build the saddles in advance. Give 10 extra inches, build out the saddle, and wait for the fit-up to get the right measurement. Then cut, and weld a flange on. 

David Mull still hasn't enabled us to bring our tools. He also doesn't seem to push paperwork through very well in several cases. I wonder what this means. I'm still trying to figure it all out.
