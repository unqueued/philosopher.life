* His grandma died, and she's the only one who gives a shit. Kid has had a shit year, no doubt. This week exceptionally awful. Ideation. Emergency! He's coming for dinner, and we are making his favorite meal instead.
** Family sifted recipes to find the golden mean. Need all the parts put together (you won't be able to cook while at work, but need to make it easy on those who will). Pull your pyrex out of your chemcook equipment, shop, have a good time with him.
* You have a lot of writing to do. Jackshit on your letters, btw. Fail.
* House is clean enough, surprisingly. Once over. 
** I hate your shelf. ;P
* Offspring still aren't doing it right. Keep trying.
