I think video games and game theory itself have enormous overlap. MMO's provide State of Nature microcosms, experimental and philosophical experience machines, which allows us to see game theory play out, to investigate who we really are as individuals and emergent communities.

Tit-for-Tat and Tit-for-Two-Tats cooperation strategies are very likely to arise in these semi-anonymized environments. Imho, Tit-for-Two-Tats (the correct strategy in non-perfectly competitive games) is the fundamental game theoretic microeconomic force which enables the macroeconomic cooperation necessary to institute socialism (fully decentralizing the means of production) to be a legitimate possibility (and, in fact, our moral obligation to each other).
