We're doing well enough. Action packed week. I am not feeling better. It's getting worse, so that sucks. Still, glad to have feet on the ground.

I hope too..im sure you all have been at it trying to get situated and back to normal. That's tough too when your ill. I hope your wife is doing well at the nrw job. Are the kids excited about the new place?

Yeah, I hear that. I was hoping to have more done that I did, but the home functions.

Yeah, I think she's doing well at her new job. She's all nervous and doubting herself (as usual), but I have no doubts about her. Glad she is sleeping and not getting sick.

They treat her right there too, and I like that.
Jan 12 2:46pm
Hey that's what matters. Comfort will come when you are all done. Lol . Im glad shes doing ok and they treat her well. Not near enough of that around.

Kids are relatively excited. They've been walking through the city on their own. They've been busy putting the house together with me and making it function. Couldn't do it without 'em. They've not had a ton of freetime, but I suspect once their rooms are all set, they will enjoy it even more. I know they are liking having their own rooms for the first time.

The I bet that is exciting for them. Its good they are branching out.
