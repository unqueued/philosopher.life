title: 2019.02.22 - Wiki Audit: TW5Nav Woes

For the second time, I've lost control of my direction keys and enter in the wiki. TW5Nav's shortcuts (for popups) are being changed without my direct intervention, and I have no idea how to reproduce it. I don't use popups, I've not directly touched the settings. Something else is overwriting it. I can say TW5Nav did not work out of the box for me. Something is wrong. I have asked BTC for help before, but I think he has no interest in taking a look (which is up to him, obviously). This is infuriating behavior in the wiki.
