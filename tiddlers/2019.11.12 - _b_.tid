Hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi, geeeyejihadihada[[hope]].

Even when S.Skeptical Humean Sentamentalism thinks its at the wheel of its sinking ship, the recursive and emerging projects which are reconstructed from our self-narratives are toward something, and possibly in many ways we choose, and that is as a whole narrative-project as well. Even as strange loops being in time, including our rays of intentionality, we are telic cannons. I call for the sulfur<<ref "f">> and charcoal, Salt Peter. Baptize, Mark, and Anoint us Saint KNO,,3,,wledge. Never forgetti [[The End]] as the beginning as you spiralically spirically justify means as morally virtuous (to extrema) moderation of the middle functions. Sublate only what ye may. There are intended ethics and unintended morals to every story which we must strive to make paradoxically commensurable, complete, coherent, and equivalent. It is an intentionally-driven descriptive desert Dasein must prescriptively know. Even as an end-point node, I will never wisely funnel the networked world into itself well enough. It folds and unfolds.
