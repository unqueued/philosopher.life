Pipefitting is worth mastering.<<ref "1">> They say you need a mythical 10,000 hours to become a master of something. I'm impatient, and I crave effectiveness and efficiency. I'm also extraordinary at learning when I apply myself (when I'm motivated in the right way). Let's see if my training, natural talent, discipline, and this log allow me to beat the curve. This pipefitting log is meant to be a mastery acceleration tool and planning device. Keeping a journal or log allows us to be reflective, to plan, to find patterns, to adjust our trajectories, and to see how far we've come.

!! Principles:

* Write it down as if nobody but you is reading it. 
** Don't even think about sharing it with co-workers.
** Perhaps my brother JRE is the exception. I need his wisdom often in this arena.
* Learn from your mistakes.
* Appreciate your progress.
* Write about what's hard, interesting, sad, boring, or even funny. Anything that evokes strong emotions is worth writing about.
* Do some planning, and be pragmatic! 
* Grind like a BAMF. 
** Work on the weekends.
