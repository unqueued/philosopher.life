2019.07.11 - @jbaty: [[Congratz!|https://rudimentarylathe.org/#2019.07.11%20-%20Journal]] =)

2019.06.28 - @jbaty: You could always have [[two wikis|https://rudimentarylathe.org/#2019.06.26%20-%20Journal]], one public and the other public+private. You could automate the export of the public tiddlers by tag. The [[gfwiwcgws]] problem you are facing is even more important; you have to know [[your purpose|https://rudimentarylathe.org/#2019.06.27%20-%20Journal]] to identify the "for the sake of which" you use your wiki (or any tool for that matter).

2019.06.19 - @jbaty: I'm a straight hater of most implementations of [[Federation|https://rudimentarylathe.org/#2019.06.18%20-%20Journal]], but, of course, even if what we have doesn't work (at least turnkey and network effected), we have to find some P2P/Federation infrastructure which does (which isn't to say you imply otherwise). Your 7:17 argument is terrible. Owning your data entails keeping what you make locally as your primary, and if it's permissible to distribute it via other channels you don't own, eg. via Twitter, then do so. You generally can have both (they aren't conceptually mutually exclusive), but only one of them is morally obligatory (it's not non-sense).

2019.06.12 - @jbaty: Hey, I forgot all about [[Ram Jam - Black Betty|https://rudimentarylathe.org/#Favorite%20Songs]]. That definitely goes in [[Music: Library]]. Gracias! =)

2019.05.14 - @jbaty: I have no idea what I'd switch to [[either|https://rudimentarylathe.org/#2019.05.11%20-%20Journal]]. I'd have to cut some limbs off, and I'd have to grow another system. Reading is reasonable enough, but the writing not so much. Part of the problem is that I'm quite accustomed to TW as its own IDE. I want to think while I'm in the TW, not while I'm outside it.
