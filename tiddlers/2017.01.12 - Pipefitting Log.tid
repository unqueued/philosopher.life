I hate to say it, but the school appears disorganized and staff incompetent in many ways (at least in my experience with schools). I have now found out the truth. I have only finished the testing requirements for the school. I actually have to pay to take "fake" certification tests (I do not respect the content of these tests) necessary to join the union or a few other companies. I'm going to take them immediately, since they may easily open local doors for me which I desperately need. The elective tests might actually be disappearing (the test makers are doing away with it). I'm not sure if they will be worth my time/money. I think I may anyways, just in case.

Be voracious and humble. Your genetic + memetic background is functionally (not morally) superior, and your competence will shine. Do it amiably and kindly. As IASIP's Dennis is unfortunately correct about, in his redpilled assessment, I must demonstrate my value to these people (only, I'm going to be empathic in the way I do it).
