title: 2017.07.31 -- Pipefitting Log

I arrived early. Bull showed up at 7:02, and Jaye after that. 

We brought Room #2's pipe into the room. We then went to take measurements. We had to use a lift to get through a weird opening in the roof. It was scary, and I'm glad I had my harness. It's the first time that I felt I deeply needed it. Jaye doesn't have a harness (I offered mine for the crossing), but he feels emasculated by it. For a couple things he says he will use it though. This is his first job (minus an iron worker job way back in the day) where he has been working up way high in the air. He told me to get a fab shop job, immediately.

We took final measurements, and came back down. We cut the pipe and tacked it up. 

After break, we went back up to take measurements for the second pipe, the return. This was trickier, as it was offset without much space. None of the usual tricks would work (had to butt up 45's to make it). Thank goodness for the plumb bob. No wonder I had so much trouble with the measurements by myself! I really needed Jaye's help, and I'm glad I had it this time.

The math didn't work out. I eventually asked for Bull's help. He showed me his method. It worked (and I know because I verified with the actual fucking fittings being measured in my hand). I figured out what I did wrong. I've never butted up 2 45's against each other like this, and I failed to reason my way into using the Pythagorean in a fitting way. Duh. This bit me in the ass again when I got the long part of the the twisted "L" spool wrong. Thankfully, it was too long, and I could just cut it.

I gotta say, I feel really embarrassed and stupid for making this mistake. I'm not sure if I should tell Bull about how I figured it out or not. He has his way, and I doubt he cares about mine. He uses the x, x/2, x/4, x/8, add the 2nd and 4th together method instead of multiplying by 5/8. He also does the division by 1.414 constant instead of proving it to himself. 

At lunch, my teacher called me. That Yates job at Eastman is going to start next Monday. 50 hours per week @ 23.50 per hour for 4 months. Depending on how OT works, that is at least $16k. Sweet, sweet green next to my house (and not in a shitty neighborhood?), sign me up!

I kept Jaye busy welding most of the day. I did well there.

At the end of the day, I decided to check Room #2's pipe again, just because I felt like I needed to. I did, and it turned out that I had made the return pipe far longer than it needed. I got the ladder and checked the supply, just incase, but it worked fine. I then cut all the pipe I needed and set us up for success tomorrow.

I made a bunch of mistakes, but they didn't cost us much. I want to continue making mistakes, if I have to make them at all, in such a way that they cost me as little as possible. I'm glad I caught them relatively early.
