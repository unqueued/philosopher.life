title: McManus: A Year and a Half After Mark Fisher’s Death, His Thinking Rings True

Quick hyperread of k-punk. It's interesting.

<<<
The first is the sense in which we have become increasingly unable to even conceive of a thorough alternative to capitalism, thus engendering the belief that it is the only viable political and economic system.
<<<

The descriptive powers of psychological egoism and the hyperobject it has built on our planet is hard to cognitively and affectively escape. It requires serious willpower to become woke enough to have the hope of building an alternative. I barely have hope, and it's my fucking name. Prescription, like anything construction (though I am NOT a constructivist) is really hard. The Left fails here, but I appreciate why and how they do. I don't think it's necessarily or even mostly malicious (though, I think I can point to Leftists brethren who in fact are evil humans).

<<<
Those who claim it is possible, or at least should be possible, to conceive of such alternatives are quickly dismissed for being unrealistic and utopian. 
<<<

With wide variations in motivations for those dismissals. 

<<<
These arguments and countless others engender a deep sense that, despite surface appeals to democratic legitimacy and discourse, most of us have very little control over the political and economic system which governs us.
<<<

It reminds me of the is/ought problem a little bit. [[ridtyawtr]]. People mistake the low probabilities of us effectively addressing capitalism as being equivalent to the certain impossibility of doing so. Moreover, I think they egoistically elect not to be willing to sacrifice themselves for a war they feel they will almost certainly lose. It becomes this Bayesian trapdoor in which probabilistic "is" defines the conceptual "ought" into the pragmatic box that only contains assent to capitalism. They tell themselves this story enough that this is all they can see. It's a lie.

I'm still not sold on "realism" as the appropriate term at all here. It could easily be the case that I'm just ignorant or autistically obtuse here. What I see is a constructed illusion. Obviously, the argument is a valuable one though!

<<<
Instead, capitalist realism is only concerned with “objective” monetary values. 
<<<

Here's a shitty steelman of their shitty position: they think market prices are a pseudo-democratic (I hate using this word like this) way to decide how we collectively value objects and each other. Obviously, it's gamed into oblivion, and it makes it hard to see how the world doesn't have to be a zero sum game of perfect competition. It replaces [[The Golden Rule]] moral realism (e.g. Shafer-Landau, value properties) with this heuristical physical monetary device which becomes an abused confabulation designed used to enslave of us by handing all the competitive advantages over to those who aren't going to bind themselves to [[The Moral Law]].

<<<
Fisher is observing how capitalist realism flattens the world by stripping it of symbolic meaning and turning it into a set of commercial artifacts, each with a given price.
<<<

I actually have little regard for culture in itself. Capitalism, of course, is a culture. I'm worried we are going to have some profound metaethical disagreements here.

<<<
It considers all “cultural objects,” from a Holy Cross to Internet pornography, valuable in so far as they can be monetized.
<<<

That's the gist. I'm open to capitalism being about a kind of power struggle that exceeds monetization as well. I think we need to define "culture" at this point. I consider myself fairly redpilled in a way that is abhorrent to many Leftists; though, I think my position is far more defensible.

<<<
 So we consume these pop culture narratives as a poor substitute for the genuine meaning and change we wish to see.
<<<

They are experience machines, drugs.
