!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

It's good. I'm probably not getting enough sleep. But, I've been keeping a schedule well enough. I've noticed I've been sleeping in on Saturdays moreso than usual. I will continue to monitor it.

I've been more eating quite a bit. I'm not holding myself accountable to it yet, since I have plenty of fish to fry. I should consider it though. I've been keeping that log for a while.

!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

My good friends ALM and JOP (married) and their two children are coming to visit. I'm excited. I hope it goes well. We've not seen each other since they left our house in New Orleans.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

They were struggling, and made significant sacrifices for them to live with us. It was an interesting time, and I was glad they came. I was sad to see them leave, especially since it wasn't under the best circumstances. We've kept in touch. They've rebuilt their lives in seems, and I'm very happy for them.

I'm feeling anxious and odd about it because I don't want it to be weird for us. That's all. I think my friend maybe doesn't want to see me (or he was worried that I didn't want to see him). I'm glad they are coming though.

!! What are you going to do about what happened?

Hopefully have a good time with my friends. =)
