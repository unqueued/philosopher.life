title: 2020.03.13 - Tjandamurra: 8km

"""
[00:56:08] Tjandamurra: G'day. Luckily the closest fire to me was 8km away, with a dry riverbed between us, in a state forest so was well contained. Since then we have had some rain, tanks all full, and dam about 3/4 full, so no water carting for about 18months now. Been busy working on my skidsteer loading - putting in repaired injector fuel pump, and clearing fire breaks by hand until it is fixed - waiting for a special spanner to come, as my arm won't bend enough to get last bolt in.
[00:58:36] Tjandamurra: The house dam - still filling when I took this photo.
[22:18:51] h0p3: 8km, lawd. That is so close (even though it was secure). I'm glad to hear about the water situation for you. I hope the spanner comes soon for ya.
[22:18:51] h0p3: It sounds like you have been super busy.
[22:22:35] Tjandamurra: Dam is now full and has been running over. Enough for a couple of years
[pending] h0p3: Outstanding. Also, that is beautiful.
[20:34:39] Tjandamurra: Yep, we are now in Katherine for B's work! Self isolation, another 7 days to go, she is working from our caravan site. Couldn't have allocated unit as no pets allowed.
