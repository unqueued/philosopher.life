h0p3, it's me, you. Pay attention, self.<<ref "1">> You are an exceedingly complex biological computer system having a carefully crafted conversation with yourself.<<ref "2">> You are an evolving self-programmer. Program this rabbithole and yourself wisely! 

In the long-term, this is the second most important section on this wiki. Here you attempt to formalize how you want to program yourself. Perhaps you aren't entirely sure how exactly it fits in the wiki's stack, but it's clearly vital. This platform you are building is for your own knowledge base and systematically shaping yourself. Be creative, and run with it! 

Second order of business: you should write second-personally or first-person-plurally (implying second-personal empathy) in this section as much as you can. Finding the right voice in which to talk to yourself isn't easy, but it's crucial at this level. Pretend an absurdly empathic friend (yourself, obviously) is telling you what you need to know and do.<<ref "2">>

So, where do you move from the {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]} page? That is quite a narrative. Now you must be quantitative about your qualitative narrative. You must put theory into practice. But, to put it into practice as best as you can, you must develop even more theories. The goal is to be friendly-formal, clarifying, terse, pragmatic, heuristical, empirically data-driven, goal-oriented, coherent, and axiomatically insightful in this section.

This wiki, including this section, is organizationally bootstrapped and constructed piecemeal. It's cobbled together. It's not perfect, and it never will be. But, it can and will improve; you just need to push. You should aim to do the best you can. It takes time to engineer and implement a well-oiled existential machine. What is the ideal, and how do you achieve it as best you can? Do it!

The {[[Projects|Projects on this Wiki]]} page is deeply interested in computing the contents of your life. Most of the work happens there. But, you need principles for prioritizing, weighing, and even for fundamental decision procedures. You need principles for those principles too, and so on. One must push hard in this direction, however painful and difficult it may be. Here you are writing a guiding light cheatsheet for your life's journey on this wiki. 

Obviously, the {[[Projects|Projects on this Wiki]]} page must ultimately affect, as a kind of feedback loop, your guiding principles in this section as well as your {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]} page, your existential anchor. However, you need to be strongly and consistently convinced and motivated by the work in your {[[Projects|Projects on this Wiki]]} section of this wiki before you use that lower-ordered content to feedback into, modify, or inform your foundational higher-ordered functions (particularly this section and {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]}).<<ref "3">>  Essentially, be careful in how you grant privileges to lower-ordered processes, escalating them from mere users to higher-ordered root processes.<<ref "4">> However paradoxical it may seem, it's up to you to strike the right balance between guarding yourself and being vulnerable to yourself.

In this section, you must lay down the constitution, the criterion, and source of authority of your internal law: the rules, strategies, methodologies, and principles of programming yourself and using this wiki. Autonomy literally means self-legislating. That's exactly what you intend to do. Here you hope to hone and maximize your executive functioning. Essentially, you need direction in life, and you're helping yourself find and implement the best way you know how (what else can you do, eh?). 

There are many collections of principles worth looking at. You must isolate, categorize, organize, analyze, revise, and synthesize them. Cleanliness, order, and conventions matter. If this wiki is an isomorphically mapped feedback loop, and changes are bi-directional (you change the wiki, and the wiki changes you), then you should take the time to organize and structure it with the right principles. You must unscatter your thoughts. You must be an existential computer scientist in your pursuit of homo sapien happiness; it's the only philosophically practical thing to do. 

You must be meta about being meta, etc., but in a sense, you should aim to do minimal theoretical work in this section.<<ref "5">> You need to be as practical as you can be here, despite how existential and theoretical it really is. If the {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]} page is your existential anchor narrative, a very qualitative and subjective (yet obviously valuable) theory, then this section is meant to be its pragmatic brother. In the same way that [[KIN]] was the leading (though not sole) author of {[[About|About, a.k.a. The Opening of the Rabbit Hole]]}, [[RPIN]] is the leading author of this brother page.

Here are the branches:

* [[Wiki: Existential Axioms and Fundamental Principles]]
* [[Wiki: Broad Computational Structure]]
* [[Wiki: Construction Principles]]
* [[Wiki: Scheduled Practices]]
* [[Wiki: Be the Kind of Author that...]]
* [[Wiki: Assume this Audience]]
* [[Wiki: Loosey-Goosey Principles]]
* [[Wiki: Other Frameworks and Paradigms to Consider]]
* [[Wiki: Projects]]

Remember that you are in the driver's seat. So, pilot the wiki wisely, ace! Build for yourself a proof of your sanity, growth, intelligence, wisdom, and willpower. Play life and this wiki like a video game that you adore. Be obsessively strategic in your planning and savor the meta-living experience.<<ref "6">> If you aren't making maximally meta-paradigm shifts and syntheses, you're doing it wrong! Pour yourself into this medium. Shotgun approach, organize, and prune in order to find the way to happiness. Listen to yourself.

<<footnotes "1" "God, I'm annoying, =).">>

<<footnotes "2" "One day my son had been dealing with incompatibilist intuitions and wrestling with himself to see that our autonomy just is programming ourselves, and he told me a joke. This joke was a response to his punishment of losing his rights to use computers that day (horror of horrors, let me tell you) because he didn't do his chores on time. He said, 'Dad, if I can't use computers, then I can't be myself.' He explained his reasoning. He saw the appearance of the contradiction. It was a beautiful moment.">>

<<footnotes "3" "Sounds like the blind leading the blind to me, lol.">>

<<footnotes "4" "I'm sure it sounds weird to call the second-order mental states the foundational ones. Frankfurt was right though. Essentially, we must align our many ordered desires, beliefs, and mental states. We must create conformity between them. Ultimately, the higher-ordered must do the modifying and alignment. Thus, that is the seed and perhaps foundation of autonomy, if not the very heart of it.">>

<<footnotes "5" "I am aware of the [[infinigress|Infinigress]] here. As always, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. I have no response. It's axiomatic faith for me. I'm sorry I can't provide you with a better explanation at this time. (I'm sure it really bakes your noodle that I'm using 1st personal language here. Lulz.)">>

<<footnotes "6" "Theory is everywhere. I love theory. I also can't afford to not set my existential tentpegs down. Consider this a pragmatic nomadic approach through the desert.">>

<<footnotes "7" "Obsessions may often become addictions. However, appropriate obsession here is literally being wise by definition. That which maximizes utility (for whom, I realize) cannot be an addiction by definition.">>
