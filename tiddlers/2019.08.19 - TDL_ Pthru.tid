* Time to get it working, or get closer. Not enjoying QEMU/KVM.
* Letters ;P
* See if you can have another day like yesterday. It was outstanding. You did good work.
* You've got the cover, so apply.
* Clean up
* Breakfast for dinner sounds good, or Red beans and rice. We should probably go shopping. Low of veggies.
* Offspring struggled today. I don't understand why. March.
