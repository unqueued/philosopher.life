Hope you have a great day today [[h0p3]]. :)
TUE 8:10 AM
You too =)
TUE 11:00 AM
What you up to today?>
TUE 11:20 AM
Got work, theory, and game night. And yourself?
TUE 11:25 AM
I too am working on game theory tonight.
TUE 11:26 AM
Finishing letters to folks.
TUE 11:26 AM
Writing letters takes it out of me.
TUE 11:26 AM
I feel SO rusty in writing them.
TUE 11:26 AM
I wish I practiced it more growing up.
TUE 11:26 AM
I’m so used to writing emails now it feels second nature to me.
TUE 11:27 AM
How’s your cover letter coming?
TUE 11:28 AM
It's done.
TUE 11:28 AM
Turned it in yesterday.
TUE 11:28 AM
Nice! :D
TUE 11:28 AM
Thank you for the help.
TUE 11:28 AM
You should write letters with me!
TUE 11:28 AM
There are somethings which can't be effectively communicated in instant messaging, imho.
TUE 11:29 AM
What you got planned for gamenight?
TUE 11:32 AM
Also, I finished your music list. Right up my alley!
TUE 11:55 AM
Who knows? I'm bringing stuff to read, haha
TUE 11:56 AM
Hope you also found some guilty pleasures on there!
TUE 11:57 AM
Lol. I don't feel guilty at all, but pleasure certainly.
TUE 11:57 AM
I'm not sure many of these will appear on my eventual list of the best music ever, but it's surely helping me define my criteria!
TUE 12:30 PM
I'm not sure what really counts as my criteria. In fact, I feel like I'm building my list to eventually build my criteria (assbackwards, I realize that folds in on itself).
TUE 12:31 PM
Currently, the best metric would be: could I listen to this everyday?
TUE 12:31 PM
Same kind of problem with food.
TUE 12:32 PM
Aesthetic drugs have lots of problems like that.
TUE 12:32 PM
Sometimes, White Castle hits the fucking spot. Liver (of different kinds) as well.
TUE 12:32 PM
Most of the time, I'm not jonesing for it.
TUE 12:32 PM
What is the correct hedonic tooling?
TUE 12:33 PM
If I got to take 10GB of music with me to an island, X books, etc. what would they be?
TUE 12:33 PM
Maybe that is it.
TUE 12:33 PM
I am, of course, extremely interested to see you think about it.
TUE 12:33 PM
I think anything and everything should be the criteria because music exhibits subjective taste.
TUE 12:34 PM
My goal is to make a list not for [[K]] but for lovers of the art of music.
TUE 12:35 PM
Is it //mere// subjective taste?
TUE 12:36 PM
Are there no objective standards of [[The Good]] of music in general or even specific to homo sapiens?
TUE 12:37 PM
What makes one song of a specific genre leagues better than another? The answer to that question has me completely stumped.
TUE 12:36 PM
Well, I see an inconsistency between "lovers of art of music" and "subjective taste."
TUE 12:37 PM
I can't say I have a satisfactory answer at all. I'm stumped too!
TUE 12:38 PM
I can map it to consequentialist reasons given deontic constraints. I can talk about what entertainment and surprise are in virtue theoretic terms.
TUE 12:38 PM
I am still quite unable to put my tentpegs down on what counts as [[The Beautiful]] as it relates to [[The Good]] and [[The Right]].
TUE 12:39 PM
I suggest this will be an important analogy and adjacent art to reasoning about what you really value most about reading and writing too.
TUE 12:39 PM
Why do stories really matter? What makes one story better than another?
TUE 12:40 PM
This is right at the heart of the fundamental problem of philosophy, imho.
TUE 12:40 PM
If I had to set objective criteria? I would say that the medium of art (let’s say music) takes full advantage of itself.
TUE 12:42 PM
So music must have top notch lyrics, showcase mastery of its various instruments, and elicit an emotional response in the listener.
TUE 12:43 PM
But not just the listener.
TUE 12:43 PM
Any listener that appreciates music for the medium.
TUE 12:43 PM
Not a specific genre or convention.
TUE 12:43 PM
We will disagree on the lyrics.
TUE 12:44 PM
RIGHT. some music is perfect without words.
TUE 12:44 PM
So maybe lyrics don’t matter at all.
TUE 12:44 PM
Emotional response seems to be the most on target to me, but that scales/maps to particular audiences (hence the subjectivity). Indeed, it looks like a hedonic treadmill. The question is: how should you climb that treadmill/mountain?
TUE 12:45 PM
It is why I hope it is more than hedonism.
