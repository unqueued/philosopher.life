title: 2019.09.09 - Prompted Introspection: Planning

!! If you could change one thing about your family, what would it be?

Oh, Lady Melisandre, you gift me the entrance to presumably radically better worlds yet again. You are my genie.<<ref "c">> Alright, genie, I'm rubbin' my lamp, and I wish for whatever [[The Moral Law]] would universalize given omnisciently crafted maxims. Welp. I did it. Voila. Magic. It was cinch. Cool story and thanks, breh. `/dusts-hands-off-from-a-job-well-done`.

I could continue constructing idealized answers here. My son clearly needs an example of more specific reasoning, practical reasoning given what is actually available to us though (lawd help us). I do not claim this is the best answer, but rather only a non-trivially reasonable one. I wish my family (obviously, very much including me), became more reliable planners of our lives. We're not good at it; excepting in my extremely particularized interested, I'm wildly the worst at it compared to everyone else in general spheres. My [[TDL]] is a fucking trainwreck to the point that I am just suggesting, priming, nudging, massaging, joking, and virtually praying I'll have the integrity to do (and I won't most of the time). Executive functioning is one of my most profound weaknesses (and, to some crucial [[dok]], up to me).
