title: 2018.08.04 -- FTO: Dougherty

Somehow the [[Stephen Darren Dougherty]] tiddler got orphaned! Well, good thing I've been thinking about it (I'll need to dig anyways to build this up...I assume the //Vault://[[FTO]] is going to be huge).

I've been thinking about reaching out to Stephen for a while. I wrote the letter almost a month ago. I really wanted {[[Help]]} to be in better shape, as as well some of the audience-oriented [[Root]] directories. [[FTO]] has been pretty explosive in how it's forced me to deal with the structure and {[[Focus]]} of this wiki.

Well, I finally have some drafts that I find acceptable enough. I promised myself and my brother to send it as soon as I did it. So, I did. 

I'm pretty nervous. Stephen may truly despise this (which would suck, because I really hope he doesn't...I know how smart he is). This is the first professor of mine I've reached out to about this. Let's see how it goes.

I clearly have many more letters to write now.
