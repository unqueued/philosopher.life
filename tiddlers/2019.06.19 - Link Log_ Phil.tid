*** My only complaint is that you don't go for the throat. [[Redpilled Stoicism]] is fundamentally egoistic, sociopathic, cold and calculating in reframing anything not in virtue of [[The Moral Law]] but whatever comforts us (even with inversive framing techniques), and clearly the point of view the aristocracy benefits from taking up. If you just proclaim it's not up to you, then boom: you don't have to do anything about it. What a magic fucking wand to have! Stoicism is anti-realist. So, for realsies, call it what it is.

*** There is someone possibly justifiably more pessimistic, nihilistic, and darker than me. You poor soul. I wish I could hug them and have a beer with them.

*** Yikes. That's hardly a moral algorithm. Keep going down the path, and you'll see from a pragmatic perspective, only Marxism can respond. You can't defeat capitalism with itself.

*** My assumption is that they will get pressed very hard this time. Chromium delivers the control with at least some semblance of non-monopoly.
*** I guess I might as well trust Mozilla since I already do...right? RIGHT?

*** At the bottom, only you can protect your data. Education and personal responsibility are necessary even if obviously insufficient. I think we hit Moore's Paradox here, and I'm not convinced they actually do! I don't see many innocent parties here.

*** Aye. Contacting your congressman isn't going to matter though. That door has already closed. Non-violent protest cannot succeed either. My primary concern is that people won't even know how to (let alone be capable of) geographically reach the aristocracy.

*** Materialism is not necessary for the hard problem, imho. I don't see why you get to assert this.
*** I have no answer. That gap is what philosophy aims to solve, ofc.
*** I don't know enough to resoundingly claim "reception is, by its very nature, always silent," especially when handling the hard problem.
*** Love the ladder move in his quote about his own book.
*** I am surprised to see the physicalist approach, the bottom-up physiological emergent structure, and then calling this "noise" repression and distortions. That seems to miss the conceptual point!
*** Of course, OOO. I grant that consciousness is layered, emergent, and distributed. There are lots of selves at work in our self. I don't have evidence to think most things which have a quantum perspective are Daseinic (and indeed, I don't think quantum observation demonstrates that either, but I could be wrong). We are, of course, back to the hard problem.
*** Let me suggest the black box [[infinigress]] literally requires [[The Infinite]]. I will argue [[Saint Kant]] is making basically the same move, and [[Saint Plato]] is telling us it is necessary for the possibility of perception. 
*** I don't see why the maze helps here. I'm picking the book up (sorry, dear :P) just in case.

*** The majority of my subs don't show up in the list, but they should cluster strongly. It says I'm an average generalist, and I'm surprised (but, again, it doesn't most of my subs in there). I think I'm a specialist who keeps branching out, and it only looks like I'm a generalist. That said, fitness in this was all sorts of wrong.
