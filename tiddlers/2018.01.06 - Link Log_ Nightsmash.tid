* Think About It

*** I think they have the emotional intelligence not to say it. You bet your ass they know their smart though, and they must say it to themselves. Their are fundamental obstacles that require you know you are smart in order to overcome them. The article alludes to this, but fails to understand the "talking to whom" problem. Also, there are ways to virtue signal more subtly and powerfully that are largely overlooked here. This is a crack at Trump.
