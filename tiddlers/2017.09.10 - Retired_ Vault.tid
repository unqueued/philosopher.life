I wrote them down in my diary so that I wouldn't //have// to remember them.

This is my story. Here are the records of my practice of the [[Art of Living]], and I hope it will be my masterpiece. I hope it will be my life's magnum opus; one's life should be one's life's work. Here I archive significant bodies of my work which make me proud, nostalgic, or pensive. This vault is a sequence of memoirs, projects, and shifts in my perspectives, values, and goals. It gives me a chance to reflect upon seasons, eras, arcs, and chapters of my life. I suppose, to some extent, this is a trophy vault and a place for me to celebrate myself.<<ref "1">> I have achieved much, and I've come a long way. I hope to be motivated by this catalog to wisely amortize my self-reflection. Lastly, I hope to provide myself perspective on //who I was// for the sake of both knowing //who I am// and planning //who I will be//. Thus, I hope to have a prolific and unabridged life of happiness.

Obviously, my narratival divisions are poorly justified subjective human constructs. Life is chaotically complex, hard to reduce, difficult to categorize and systematize, and that's all because it is difficult to draw clean lines. That's okay. It is our plight to play games of semantics with ourselves; it is the foundation of human communication and our fallible analysis+synthesis. I'm bootstrapping; I'm building it brick by brick, and I'm filling it droplet by droplet. I have to start somewhere, and I shouldn't expect perfection.<<ref "2">>

If the rest of the wiki itself is not the next addition to this vault, assuming I will continue having conversations with myself/myselves for a long time in this medium (let's [[h0p3]] so!), then my future goal is to prune similarly-scaled and completed (or sufficiently achieved) chapters of life from [[Projects on this Wiki]] and store them in this memetic vault.

Perhaps I will need to actually sit down and write memoirs to help give shape to this in a sense. I can provide writings from a time period and writings about that time period.

<<footnotes "1" "These works tend to be as well-formulated and articulate as I could be in my given contexts, although the formatting is not always perfect (especially for work grafted into this wiki). I'm autistic and not naturally gifted with language. Further, my oversharing and honesty comes off as stupid, arrogant, and cringeworthy to most people. That's okay though: I probably think and feel the similarly about your life too. It's time to be courageous when we look at ourselves in the mirror of time. I'm not going to be ashamed of it, and I'm not going to hate myself. That isn't useful to me.">>

<<footnotes "2" "So kindly fuck-off, haters.">>

<<footnotes "3" "I assume some parts of me are going to win out as I continue to grind my way through cognitive dissonance and unify myself. What will be the outcome of my [[Frankfurtian Feedback Alignment|2017.03.15 - Frankfurtian Feedback Alignment]]?">>

<<footnotes "4" "I think this is the most fitting place on the wiki (although it might fit in many places) for an odd writing assignment I've taken up for myself: how should I think about my death? What do I want from it? Stoicism is the mindset, but the analysis should emerge. Be practical about death.">>
