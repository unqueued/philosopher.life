!! Audit:

* As usual, this is extremely emotional.
** It appears fairly practical too.
* Poems that never deserve to see the light of day.
** Let's put on a blockchain forever!
* Some letters are not worth writing.
** TWO! [[JHBFC]]. I've met my [[T42T]] and then some. I need the slack, and [[L]] obviously has no interest in me or what I think when we get down to it.
* [[/b/]] captures the tidbits too. It's such a weird project.
* I suppose most of the relief came from being able to empty stuff not just from my mind into it, but even from the rest of the wiki.
* The trashcan that isn't exactly a trashcan, eh?
