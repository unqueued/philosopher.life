Stephenson's world-building falls flat/apart. This is pretty awful. It was rousing (and arousing) at times though. I suppose I'm halfway glad I went through it. It could have been a lot worse.

It's clear to me that I need to have policies in place for myself to jettison books for explicit, conscious reasons.
