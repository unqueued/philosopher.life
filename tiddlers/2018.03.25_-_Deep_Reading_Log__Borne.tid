title: 2018.03.25 - Deep Reading Log: Borne

So far, this is a masterpiece. It's effortless to read and straight up addictive. It's Action RPG Scifi while being intensely humanities-oriented, emotional, empathic, and philosophical. Let me say, I highly doubt I will have the pleasure of reading another fiction book as good as this one for quite a while. I'm not at the end, but even if it suffers Stephenson's fate of failing to close out/resolve, I'm okay with that. I love the feeling of being able to trust the author.

Life and Death, Borne and Morde

The attempt to conflate Dasein/Person and Human, but then also peel it apart in other cases, can be annoying. Clearly the narrator is unsure, cannot be trusted, does not have the tools to think about it.

We were all weapons of some kind.

I still don't understand how to interpret the magician.

4th fucking wall break is hardcore.

<<<
You believed you deserved punishment for being powerless.

Serious definition/questions of happiness, memory, and identity.

Clear and distinct
