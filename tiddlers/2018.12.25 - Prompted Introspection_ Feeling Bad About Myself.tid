title: 2018.12.25 - Prompted Introspection: Feeling Bad About Myself

!! Tell about a time when someone made you feel bad about yourself. What did they do and how did you react?

Sometimes people (including characters and even myself) are justified in making me feel bad about myself, and sometimes they aren't. I receive the signaling and punishment from enough people that I have to cognitively dissect whether or not they are correct. I aim to apologize and fix my errors, but I also aim to defend and respect myself when it is clearly necessary as well.
