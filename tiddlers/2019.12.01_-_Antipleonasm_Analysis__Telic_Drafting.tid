title: 2019.12.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Telic Drafting

!! Respond to the following [[gem|https://www.kickscondor.com/stenos/hypertext-2020:-metachat]]:<<ref "l">>

>    I’m excited to learn how to write in this format. I’d prefer to think inside this tiddler, but it takes a while for a message to settle sometimes, so please wait until I have a timestamp and ‘draft’ lock is dropped before quoting me.

Just to set you at ease, nothing will be finalized until the chat is over. So I won’t begin wrapping it up until everyone has pulled their stuff out of ‘draft’. Yes, this gives you a chance to edit yourself and mess with old chats - I’m not sure what you all think about the ethic of that - but I’m great with that, we can accomplish more if we trust each other.

As for quoting you while you’re drafting - since we’re all drafting, too, it seems fair game, right? As long as we source YOUR final quotes from YOUR finalized wiki, right? And if certain quotes don’t add up, we’ll footnote it and maybe it’ll add to the fun of the sprawl.

Sprawling as usual; I don't want to dump directly into [[@: hypertext 2020]].<<ref "s">> I'm not convinced I ought.

Perhaps this is an example of the broader principle in action. I signaled a preference about drafting while drafting, and it was overridden quite reasonably, with an explanation and justification to boot.  

[[You|kickscondor]] have my trust, [[Root User]]. The people outside of [[@: hypertext 2020]] (for example, the people who may read this a decade from now) do not, or at least not nearly to the same [[dok]]. Being public, and being who I am, I have my work cut out for me to justifiably withstand the possibility of intense scrutiny.<<ref "w">>

One of the reasons I feel I have some license to draft and why I'm partially comfortable with you quoting my drafts is that I do my best to keep snapshots. There's something to hold onto there for rigorous interpretation. This is also part of why I offer a real-time sync and minutely diff. While I'm pretty awful at providing context, there's still a curve in there to think about. I anticipate that someone can ask, "Hey, you changed your mind; why would you do that?". I don't always have control over my guts (I often have to puke them up and think about them), but I do have some control over how I'm going to reason about my feelings and what I'm going to do about them. You have the chance to reason about whether or not I'm trying to do the best I can with my pile of puke.

I realize I may be quoting a draft quoting a draft here. XD. They aren't easy lines to draw, no doubt. [[As I said|@: hypertext 2020]], I'm still feeling out the fitting conventions here. I'm hesitant to directly quote drafts, but I agree it is necessary sometimes. I suppose it can be useful to cite a draft as such where appropriate (your guess is as good as mine). I also think linking to the source can sometimes iron out these wrinkles.

I'm okay that it isn't finalized in some sense. Syntax and some metadata considerations aren't big deals to me. I [[hope]] we'll come back and re-interpret the sequence yet again (still seems like a continuation of the original sequence). I do try to leave content untouched eventually. My [[CDR]] logs tend to be relaxed. After a weekly audit (during [[Family Time]]), and even moreso after a [[Monthly Audit]], I'd like to think that part of the clay has somewhat hardened. Sometimes I add Retroactive [[Footnotes]], and other times I simply link to it and keep building. 

Commitment is a process, hardly one I've understood and mastered well enough.

!! Bonus Round:

<<<
I have a hunch that there could be some remaining value in weeding through a hypertext conversation and polishing it, as a service to readers. I don’t see myself removing any of it - I think the job could be to simply highlight parts of it into a running conversation, moving the rest out of view, but still accessible. I don’t think all readers will appreciate this - some will want (and deserve) the raw text. But I think having an initially truncated version to read can help the reader get into it a bit easier and help them decide if they want the full dump.

You are picking out what is [[salient]], right? You are instrumentally reducing and abstracting for the sake of something. You are modeling what you perceive with some purpose in mind. Like my mind, to some [[dok]], my wiki allows me to re-use my data to understand what is [[salient]] in the world (including myself). Unlike my mind, to some [[dok]], my public wiki allows almost anyone to re-use my data to understand what is [[salient]] in the world (including myself).<<ref "h">> I'm not handing you simply some polished product; I'm handing you the chain of [evidence, custody, and contexts], as soup to nuts as I can (the residue buried timelapsed-art is also a product). I think it's also deeply concerned with method, finding ways to cooperate in this radically hard problem, and learning how to autonomously construct our own processes, including fairly calculating a model of [[The End]].

What is the [[gfwiwcgws]] of thinking, experiencing, modeling, including [[PSM]] as just an aspect? Why do I want to know the truth about myself and the world? What is understanding [[good]] for? Well, that's exactly what I'm trying to find and explain (which is hardly to say I'm good at it). [[Hope]]fully, it is part of the most meaningful search for meaning available to at least me.

Instead of the [[PSM]] question, I think the better starting question is: why do you have wikis like yours on the web, what are they for? Well, what is anything for? To pick out what is [[salient]]. That's what I'm practicing in this wiki (like an [[arrogant]] fool, surely). Awful as it is: [[Root]] is still the best representation of what I'm doing in this wiki. Even in shambles: {[[About]]}, {[[Principles]]}, [[Lifetime Projects]], and [[Readme]] point to what I'm doing in this wiki and why as well as I know how (though it's barely readable, I realize). I have to iterate and grow them, and even my chronological linking to them tells a story ([[ITS]]). Of course, I think we each have a different path to take here to some [[dok]], and mine merits profound ridicule, lol.

One of the reasons I'm a real piece of work to have in Sunday School with ya (in a way, you are asking me to engage in [[Prompted Introspection]]) is that at least 50% of the time the answer is Jesus (DUUHHHNNNN! Can't top that shit), and that's analogously what I answer like a jackass. Imagine having a math test where you know the answer to every problem is 42 (that's the kind of math test I would give if I taught math, lol...that's basically what I do when I give tests in symbolic logic), but the whole point of the test was showing your work (by doing the work, something is earned, habituated, and written into me; it is a profound exercise of autonomy). I keep almost mindlessly answering: 42 or 42ness, which is almost vacuously true, but I'm still not showing my work well enough to you. I'm trying, lol. You have every right to ask me to continue to pragmatize my answer in my philosophical dojo (and vv).

Once again, thank you for listening to a madman ramble. `/hands-you-a-bucket-of-rotten-tomatoes`. Do what needs to be done, homie. XD.

<<footnotes "l" "I'm grateful for the gorgeous meta-analysis thus far. You knew I would though. You're a wizard interpreter (I'm beyond jelly). I swear, I could leave 3 tiny random appearing scratches plus a footnote, and you'd realize at least half of what it was meant to say or even the [implicit reasons or tacit agreements] for why it was said to some non-trivial [[dok]]. Of course, I don't even have to say this to you, quasi-telepath, but I need my son to be able to understand this.
