title: 2019.05.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Doctrinal System

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Sectors of the doctrinal system serve to divert the unwashed masses and reinforce the basic social values: passivity, submissiveness to authority, the overriding virtue of greed and personal gain, lack of concern for others, fear of real or imagined enemies, etc. The goal is to keep the bewildered herd bewildered. It's unnecessary for them to trouble themselves with what's happening in the world. In fact, it's undesirable â€“ if they see too much of reality they may set themselves to change it.

[[Saint Chomsky]] continues to say it like it is. I'm being redundant and far less articulate in dissecting this [[gem]].<<ref "t">> 

Passivity reminds me of Daoism; it's energy efficient. Sure, I'll see plenty of virtue signaling, but I don't see people grinding for answers, especially since it will most likely fail. Passivity is the result of the Tragedy of the Commons in almost any context. Now, I'm not saying there aren't times and cases in which we should passive, but I don't think outrage which results in moral action to be a wrong thing either. Most people I know are attempting to drug themselves into passively ignoring reality because it's so fucking painful and despair-inducing to recognize the state of affairs and admit our responsibilities. You don't have an alienable right to be happy when people are suffering worldwide.

Submission to unjustified authority is also Daoist and conservative to me. It's so convenient to be in-grouped than to stick out like a sore thumb. Why fight it? Going with the flow is far more profitable, and it's delightful to convince yourself you couldn't do anything about it anyway, as though it were an absolute, indubitable waste of your resources to spend them fighting immoral power. Of course, not all authority is unjustified, and it's every person's job to take the time to understand that as best they can. 

The overriding virtue of greed and personal gain as well as a lack of concern for others is what I see 97-99% of the population to varying [[dok]]. They don't aim to be morally consistent, they don't fight it; they celebrate it. They confabulate stories to dismiss and counter reasons we must serve each other so profoundly. This is what makes someone garbage to me. It is simply far more egoistically viable to immorally enslave others than serve our moral enslavement to others. I think The Janitor is the last decent adult I've met in person (and, that is without much scrutiny).

Uncritically allowing oneself to hold unmitigated fear of real or imagined enemies is a potent error in our judgment. It's easy to be led astray, it's difficult to identify genuine enemies, and it's difficult to have the courage to respond appropriately when our lives are at stake. Measured responses to fear require habituating justice into our identities.

There's no escaping being conditioned. We all have poisoned memetic origins too. Yet, we have the freewill necessary to uncover the practical and theoretic moral aspects of ourselves and the world enough to at least debewilder ourselves and others to some extent. Of course, those who control unjustified indoctrination are the most culpable, but so are the reactionaries. If you have access to the internet and books, you are responsible for remaining ignorant too; even the proletariat has no right to remain absolutely bewildered.

People think philosophy is useless or cool. It's the hardest and most costly work I've ever done in my life. If you aren't being transformed and attempting to transform the world around you through reason, you dun fucked up.
