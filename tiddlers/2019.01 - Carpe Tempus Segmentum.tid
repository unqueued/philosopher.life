!! Audit:

* Sometimes I have nowhere else besides [[/b/]] to talk about an encounter. Sometimes it feels [[review]] like. I'm not sure what to call it. I'm glad I do it, even if it's simple. It's a sketch.
* I love when I have positive things to say. I may not be optimistic, but I am grateful for the chances to be grateful.
* Meditation merged into just a habit very rapidly.
* We have eaten so well.
** I still haven't gotten sick of lentil soup.
* Less sexual activity than usual, including fireman time.
** No idea why? What is wrong with me?
* MTG has been a treat.
* This month felt fairly balanced and there has been clear progress.
** Still...I've been driven crazy.
* I took forever on the car.
* I've gone on dates with my wife. It's been a long time.
* I'm glad I'm laying off the kids wikis. I look when I'm instructed to look by my wife, and that is wonderful. She holds them accountable and allows me to chime in on particular things.
* Alcohol is bad for sleep, duh doy.
* Cannabliss has been good.
** I should get more!
* [[title.Title]]s still doing gawdz werk.
