 Alright, I'm calling in a favor (I cannot recall the last time I did).
Mon 11:35 AM
 I am considering reaching out to my donors. Not sure if I should, and I'm not sure how I should do it. I'd like your digested advice. Give me something to think on. Be prepared for me to wrestle with your claim, please. Take your time in formulating your thoughts, please.

 I will work on that for you.  Send me your thoughts on the subject now and a little most recent info on your interactions with them and your thoughts on why you might or might not reach out now.  I am not up to speed.

 Missed the link sorry, mobile.  Will read it and then reply with my thoughts for you.

 Do you have a deadline on this request?  I want to know how long I have to formulate a response.

 It will take you a while to read it. You will perhaps need to hyperread my wiki to appreciate the issue. https://philosopher.life/#Help%3A%20On%20This%20Wiki:%5B%5BHelp%3A%20On%20This%20Wiki%5D%5D would also be a key thing to read.

 I think you should take as long as you need. I think it is unlikely that you could give an informed answer in a couple days because there is a lot to read and think about it. I know your work schedule is significant too.
Mon 12:31 PM
 I ask you give me the best possible answer you can in month?

 if you can give an answer sooner, I would appreciate it

 It will probably take some doing to formulate something that I can wrestle with. I leave it up to you.
Mon 12:33 PM
 I appreciate your willingness to work hard on my behalf and well-being here. It is not a fun task.
Mon 12:34 PM
 Thanks for the pointing in the right direction.  I will get started on it.
