!! Audit:

* My [[AA]] is clearly rooting for me. That's fucking awesome. I'm grateful to her, and I'm lucky to have her in my life.
** I don't even know how I can thank her. I want her to know that her emotional and professional support means a lot to me. She's like an older sister to me (she is my wife's age).
* I clearly do not like my co-workers (surprise!).
* I'm listening, a lot.
* Most of this month was still just getting into the groove. I'm glad I started out at the end.
* I'm hoping I can be of use to these kids.
* This doesn't appear to be a foot in any door, sadly. 
** Though I thought it was at first. I am, as usual, easily deceived.
* I will eventually have to find a position that pays much better wages.
* Training was generally retarded. The drug-test was retarded.
** I'm so glad to be able use cannabliss again.
