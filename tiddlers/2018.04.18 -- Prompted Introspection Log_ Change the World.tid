title: 2018.04.18 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Change the World

!! How would you change the world to make it better?

I swear I answer this question every week. I'm not sure how best to answer it. There are a great number of changes to make. Ultimately, I don't know how to distribute, decentralize power of all kinds, including wealth, information, infrastructure, etc. The best path is not clear to me, and I cannot perceive the entire hyperobject of The World itself. I only have rules of thumb. I am convinced that mass computer literacy, philosophy as the world religion, and socialism (or even communism) as the fundamental political goal are strong moves in the correct direction. You aren't surprised though, right? =)
