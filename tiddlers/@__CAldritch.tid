The experts and gurus I trust believe [[the future of TW|https://boffosocko.com/2020/03/22/23-2019-06-25-twggf-the-future-of-large-tiddlywikis-h0p3/]] is bright; they have not appeared nearly as concerned as I have been. I take it my pessimistic worry is likely unworthy because I am not sufficiently competent with this tool. Poorly, I'm trying to commit myself further to idiomatic TW usage. I suspect you could acquire mastery of it and see why they are likely correct (even if I don't see why).
