title: 2019.07.24 - Prompted Introspection: Courage 2BKind

!! What is the most courageous thing you have ever done?

I have no idea. I don't consider myself particularly courageous beyond my honesty, and I'm pretty sure most consider it reckless, bodacious, flat-out [[arrogant]], and delusional. I know that I will be hated for what I have to say. I'm mean as fuck to most people. It is not my preference, as I could easily just lose myself in my digital drugs with zero regard for anyone else. Unfortunately, giving a shit means having the courage to tell people what I think, particularly when they don't want to hear it. I do my best to be kind, but it isn't usually all that nice.
