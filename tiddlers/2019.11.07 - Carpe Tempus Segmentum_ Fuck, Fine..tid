title: 2019.11.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Fuck, Fine.

* Woke at 7
** Fuck. Fine.
* Drowsy, extended meditation. 
** I have no control over the dream beyond ending it and moving to another.
*** Surprisingly, I don't want an erection. I just want to sleep. The lead in my pencil, what is happening?
* Fireman Time!
** Well, guess so. MLed handfree vibrators which edge and become more intense as I get closer.

* Dialectures

* [[JRE]] calls me! 
** Story of Matthew at the funeral home. Virtue theoretic joy in being needed. My brother is hilarious and accurate. 
** He's got a new job, closeby. He didn't get much of a break, sadly. I think he could use one (though I don't think he wants one, and I'm sure he understands it better than I do). 
** His belly is just not right. He went for Indian food, lol. I don't blame him. That shit is delicious.
** He and Rebecca are bracing for losing their baby. It's killing me thinking about it. They try not to be too attached, but that's practically impossible. Takes a village, and god damn, they stepped up to the plate. That boy has a chance he never had.
** We discussed donors and donors' donors. My brother's memory is not so great, and I give zero space here. Not fun to talk about, and he moved to another topic.
*** I surprised him by the fact that I still watch people on FB through my wife's account. Was part of our dialectures today too. 
* Inform the Men!
** Before I became pure retarded beast, my wife was concerned about the fact she found today that we would pay $400 to be pre-released on our lease. I was fine with that, and she laughs while I hold her. But, then I found out she was having a mild panic attack last night, and she didn't wake me up (deflated erection immediately). This is the same as 12yo ago with her pregnancy. She doesn't even want to let me know she's puking. I have the easy part: I'm there to hold her hair, clean up, and hold her. I need to be there. Instead, she wants to do it all by herself, and then we head to the hospital as she is hallucinating from dehydration (!!!). I get it: she wanted to let me sleep (which I appreciate), but it's insane that I'm not tagged in to be with her during her pain. That is not for her to do alone. I am doing something wrong that she doesn't come get me even on a whim; she's too conservative in how she spends me (or there is something exceptionally wrong in my ability to be useful, which is even more concerning). 
** Of course, we fucked. Been an eternity (59 hours). I aint that stupid. 
* Shower of the Gods!
* Black beans and rice, pineapple, vodka
