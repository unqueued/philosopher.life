title: 2019.02.09 - TDL: Family Time!

* Lemon juice, for the love of god!
* Read+Write
* Family Time!
** I'm excited by the week we've had. I think my kids will have something to show.
* Contact folks...
** I've not been doing the best job. That said, I'm not convinced others have gone out of their way to directly contact me that much either. [[K]] has been a shining exception.
* I'd like to make progress on {[[Verify]]}, but I'm pretty sure we are boned from the nodejs side.
** I don't want any ugly hacks.
