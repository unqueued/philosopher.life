My weekend was good — got to play more D&D which is always fun

Work put me in such a bad mood today because my boss doesn’t understand the concept of “please inform me when important things are due so we don’t get in trouble”. So I retaliated by applying to other jobs.

D&D and Jobbos sound good
AUG 12 9:36 PM
sorry about the boss

I finally applied to that engineering intro program I told you about

It took me way too long because their job application site is garbage... or my computer is. Likely both.
