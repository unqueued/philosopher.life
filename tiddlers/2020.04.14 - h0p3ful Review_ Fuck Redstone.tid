** It is surprising what is converted to, reduced to, or understood in terms of time.

** Part of picking out [[salience]] is the empirical reduction. It's not the whole truth, it's the parts that fit the particulars of the context that matter the most, in a sense.
** I appreciate that you take your wiki that seriously. You should. There aren't many narrative-tools like this, and you are going to be well-practiced (in some respects).

** Since it's fucking up again, try a firmware upgrade and run the diagnostics you can find. It would be expensive to replace it. We may need to do so though (and that makes me sad).
*** Perhaps there's something we can do to fix it though. I'm not counting on it being something we could price-efficiently find or fix at this point. I'm sorry. Increasingly, on average, there is less that we can repair on each generation of computers (for some [[good]] reasons and for some bad).
** We need to nip this in the bud. You need to get this done asap (could be done tomorrow). We will make decisions from there (the longer you wait, the longer you will be without a fancy machine).

**** Yeah, the class is too hedonically-oriented (and they are not experts in defining justified happiness [nor do they desire to do so...recall that the institution pumps out capitalists and reactionaries at a high rate]).
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** You could go back and do Redstone, but I think legit (and in some cases state of the art) circuit-design software, formal verification, heterogeneous computing, FPGAs, and homomorphic encryption are all way more interesting (and somewhat related) places to spend your time.
