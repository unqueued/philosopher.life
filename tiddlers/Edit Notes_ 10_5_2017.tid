title: Edit Notes: 10/5/2017

//It's fascinating to see this [[Relic]] which was a short-lived practice. I think this was another turning point where it became clearer to both [[k0sh3k]] and me how serious I was (and still am) about this wiki. Further, this helped me see the need for outside perspective (more than I had). It turns out that I need the input from [[others]] to make progress and reason more effectively. I'm grateful to myself for taking advice and commentary seriously. This was a precursor to [[FTO]], and you can see I'm experimenting here.//

I thought I'd start with the smaller font sections.

You're keeping an eye on this to keep it up to date, yes?

''Good point! It isn't up to date. I've been considering moving this into another section. I'll update it for now. Thank you.''

Does the list of principles belong here?

''I don't know. It seems like to does. Perhaps it doesn't. It shifts targets from an audience to myself. It's the Principles section though. Edited.''

What is a sneaker socialnet? I mean, I can see what it is, but I don't know the term, so I don't know if it's correct or needs to be edited, that's all.

''I don't know the term for it. I've never heard of one. But, I think that's the right way to talk about it.''

Crickets under Dreams? 

''You've made a good point. I really should have the "next step" planned out. I don't know what it is. Let me try and write something about it now.''
