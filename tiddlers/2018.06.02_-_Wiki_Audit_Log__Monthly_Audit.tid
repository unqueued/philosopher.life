I made serious headway yesterday, but I didn't finish the job. I need to do that.

I have to remember to finish off my [[Doctoral Notes]].

I'm actually moving one of the original chunks of {[[About]]} into [[h0p3's Lexicon]]. I'm still growing //About://{[[About]]}, but I appear to have stopped a large amount of my work in //Focus://{[[About]]}. My focus is changing. I'm eating away at the //Focus://{[[About]]}, modifying it, trying to figure out where it belongs, what to do with it, how to change it, what to keep, etc. 

I realize I'm trying to become an artist-philosopher. Problematically, I must ask myself: //Am I doing this wrong because I care about the aesthetic nature/mode of it?//. This reminds me of a quasi-Nietzschean Style of Living problematic. I have a hard time seeing the Ethical Kierkegaardian stance in it, although I can see the Faith stance can mesh with it. Somehow, the ethical has to be the standard of beauty I'm using, with faith at the bottom. What arises from the axioms must be ethically beautiful.

I've noticed that [[Why You Might Hate Me]] is also chipping away at the bottom section(s) of //Focus://{[[About]]}. Fascinating. I'm deconstructing //Focus://{[[About]]}!

I am very pleased to see that this normal [[/b/]] content is being categorized and considered in [[Wiki Audit Log]]. That's exactly where it belongs.
