title: 2018.04.23 - Computer Musings: DNS Hijacking

I'm very confused. It took me a bit to find how to actually set custom DNS on my interfaces in OpenWRT. I did. I checked /tmp/resolv.conf.auto and /tmp/etc/dnsmasq.conf. Both are showing 2001:4860:4860::8888 and 8.8.8.8 as my DNS servers. The fucking system log in OpenWRT is showing requests sent to these. I'm trying multiple devices on my network. 

VPN works for ipv4, it routes differently. ipv6 does not. I'm clearly messing something up.

The phone seems to work though (although, it bypasses ipv6 for the test that I tried; I didn't do much of a test). There must be something wrong in my OS then? 

I think this is something on my OS. 

Something is hijacking my DNS, whether by my own hand or other.

Another reason to think it's my OS, my network manager is not allowing me to force manual DNS.

Alright, it looks like Charter/Spectrum isn't ipv6 capable. God damnit!
