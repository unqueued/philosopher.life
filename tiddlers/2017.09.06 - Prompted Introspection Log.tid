!! What is the psychological impact of having money again?

I feel safer. I feel like there is hope. I feel like I can build toward something.

I finally am able to take my kids to go do things on the weekends. We get to eat out, which has been quite rare for us. It's really nice to have that cushion again.

I know what I want to do with the money now, and I don't feel bad making it. It's great to have a means to my ends.
