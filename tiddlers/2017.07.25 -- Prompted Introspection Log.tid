title: 2017.07.25 -- Prompted Introspection Log

!! Isn't there something inherently wrong with The Redpill, the claim that all people are selfish? Many people seem to think so.

No. It's a description, not the prescription people confuse it with. It seems accurate. The truth hurts. Many people are often wrong, especially about the nature of reality and those things which are most important. 

Perhaps you have some romanticized notion of humanity. I grant, it is difficult to love and hate humanity at the same time (but perhaps not in the same respect). It seems contradictory, and maybe it is. The romantic in you, of course, could learn to be okay with that.

I think most people are appalled by the notion. They could not truly envision themselves as evil humans. They can't accept that they aren't the heroes of their own stories. They are unable to fathom that they don't deserve the life they have, that they don't have a moral right to happiness, etc. It derealizes them. They defensively confabulate and rationalize. The truth is dangerous to them. 

It's easy for people to feel like they are "taking the high road" when they dismiss The Redpill. They will even have memories and anecdotes, but refuse to consider how even these have strong Redpill interpretations. They may consider The Redpill ad hoc. I know I once did. 

I grant, it is not easy to make sense of life when you're "woke" instead of "sheeple," lol. You will experience vertigo. Keep your intellectual integrity, and keep working for an answer.
