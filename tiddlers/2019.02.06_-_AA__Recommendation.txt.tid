How's your day going?
WED 11:55 AM
Pretty good and productive! Of my 5 classes, I am caught up on grading 3 woot woot
WED 2:18 PM
Flu is bad here too ...:mask:
WED 2:18 PM
I gots my flu shot soooo I am hoping to remain well (I don‚Äôt do well with nausea)
WED 2:19 PM
I would like to pick a study where we are in the Bible more than we are reading someone‚Äôs opinion of the Bible. I also don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúhow does this make u feel‚Äù studies ...We chose last night to do a study on 1 Peter by Jen Wilkins (I like her studies)
WED 2:22 PM
If/When the store closes, I can open the church for our Tuesday night study or we could meet at Panera or something like that
WED 2:23 PM
How is your day?
WED 2:24 PM
Congratz on getting 3 done. That is so relieving, imho.
WED 2:24 PM
Flu is bad everwhere. I didn't get my flu shot...maybe I should have. Everyone else did.
WED 2:24 PM
I can ask [[k0sh3k]] for a recommendation (or you can), if you are interested. She may know. I know your criticism well.
WED 2:25 PM
I enjoyed the Disciple Bible Study quite a  bit.
WED 2:25 PM
Restaurant sounds awesome, if everyone can afford.
WED 2:26 PM
My day has been good.
WED 2:26 PM
Reading and writing a storm.
WED 2:26 PM
The check up was for a partial plate to replace a few back teeth. My mouth isn‚Äôt completely healed so it is a little painful
WED 2:26 PM
But it looks nice
WED 2:29 PM
I would love recommendations from [[k0sh3k]]...she may want to look up Jen Wilkin also... Jen has a bunch of free ones on her web site
WED 2:30 PM
And she is one that uses scripture instead of commentaries
WED 2:32 PM
I'm sorry. I can imagine that your sensitive awareness makes the pain come to life for you extra strongly.
WED 3:47 PM
I've asked [[k0sh3k]]. She probably won't be able to answer today because she's under the weather.
WED 3:52 PM
Awww no rush. I hope she feels better soon :heart:ü•∞
WED 4:35 PM
