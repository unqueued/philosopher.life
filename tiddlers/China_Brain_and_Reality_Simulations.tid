title: China Brain and Reality Simulations

I'm strongly convinced that any kind of computer which duplicated the human brain will experience the things I'm experiencing. It is obvious that it will have a mind like ours, a consciousness like ours, etc. Androids built perfectly are fundamentally no different. Sci-fi Redpilledness knows this. See the experience machines, especially [[The Matrix]] and [[Westworld]]. I believe the China Brain obviously shows us that we consciousness is having the right kind of neural network; the right kind of computer and programming. That's it. Daniel Dennett is correct. 

Beyond that, we should see that reality simulations, like The Matrix, are completely plausible explanations of our existence. For now, we have to be agnostic about them. It may be possible to test The Matrix though. If it is just a computer program, and we're living in it, we are each just data representations and numbers being crunched by the Theory of Everything Laws of Physics algorithms which comprise the simulation, then we must at least be open to the possibility that the program is not well made. 

If the program is not well-made, if it not perfectly designed, it could be insecure. The universe, as a program, may actually have the ability to be hacked. Maybe there are physical buffoverruns, maybe there are various memory hacks or ways to fuzz ourselves into escaping the virtual machine. Perhaps we can hack our universe and machine running it. Maybe there is a "transcendental" to be hacked. If we live inside a giant VM simulation, maybe we can escape that sandbox.

Having a programmed world, of course, does not mean there is a programmer. Thank you philosophy of religion.

Of course, only physicists could get there (except the fuzzing part, which, in a way, anyone with sufficient power might bruteforce [but that would be a very weird religion]). Who else would have the means to hack the universe? You'd need to fundamentally understand it at that level.
