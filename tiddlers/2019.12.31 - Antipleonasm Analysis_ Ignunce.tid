!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
; Ignorantia legis non excusat
: Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
<<<

Even if I'm ignorant of this very law, it still almost pins me. Excuse for what and from what precisely (and why can't we speak of this in [[dok]]?)? [[Virtue is Knowledge]], but not all forms of ignorance are malicious because natural ignorance isn't always up to us (and, in fact, we will always be ignorant to some extent). It turns out that even [[The Moral Law]] requires guesswork and empiricism in far too many cases too, especially since we often cannot capture all the exceptions (which become handled by increasingly idealized conceptions of any moral law).

From a legal positivist's perspective, it depends on how the law is written. There are many which reason about premeditation, intention, and other forms of knowledge of what is legal to determine the degree of excusability or inexcusability of the offense.

Agency likely scales with timeslices, and insofar as it was not possible to know, then it is an excuse (since ought implies can). Of course, insofar as we are looking at larger timeslices in which one could possibly not be ignorant to some [[dok]], then the justificatory excuse may (though may not, depending) be no excuse.

I'll agree that immoral ignorance of [[The Moral Law]] is no excuse (as an obvious logical truth), but that is a far cry from the general claim above.
