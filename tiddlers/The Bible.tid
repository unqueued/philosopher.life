//What a sad place.//

<<<
I never said that.

!! קֹהֶלֶת:<<ref "1">>

I hear your cry, gatherer. From a cosmic vantage-point, it does seem as though all is meaningless vanity. Like all wise stoics, you are skilled at lying to yourself. At times, you appear to contradict yourself beautifully, and I suspect you know it. You do not resolve the problem with your sleight of hand.

Let us assume your farce of an argument is no accident. What is the best explanation for your unjustified prescription? Forgive my Redpilled Straussian interpretation, but I think you ask us to not curse the king, even in our thoughts, because it politically benefits you. You are truly wise for an egoist, son of David, since even your words chase yourself in the wind.

Who wails this scarlet widow dirge? Your lamentations are splintered weeping.

You disobeyed your master, you worthless whore: you deserved your rape. Your Father humiliates you, Zion, because you were a slut who failed to respect her owner. Obey or suffer! God is your enemy and your savior; He is your psychopathic creator. You can't hate God once you believe you understand Him. You've brought this on yourself; you don't hate yourself nearly enough. You will say:

<<<
Master, I deserved your rejection before. Please, take me back. I'll be a good girl. I beg you not to abandon me!
<<<

You have Stockholm syndrome. Submit to God's power; you know His merciless destruction is itself mercy. Delude yourself with doubletalk. He manipulates you into begging for your own enslavement. This is your rationalization, a coping method. You eat your children because God is eating you.

Render yourself unto us, Ghost of Shlomo. Let us once again behold the wisest of all men. Preach humble wisdom, shrewdness, and righteous insight. Help us uncover what is salient about reality. We need it.

Slowly, I see more clearly. You have dangerously mixed truths into your propagandistic poison, but I will not blindly accept their conflation. I have painstakingly developed an immunity to your bullshit. Wisdom for the unwise, unfortunately, is hard won. Now I will peel you apart.

You teach prosperity doubletalk, thus I denounce your disintegrity. The truly wise knows the sacrificial costs of justice and admits time-tested socioeconomic imbalances favor evil in the material dialectic. It is obvious, King of Transformed Wrestlers, you know this. Ironically, you hide it from us, and I finally see why. Your cleverly packaged //wisdom// is politically self-serving; it is good //for you//. You are an authority of men because you are wealthy in self-serving wisdom, but not wisdom itself. You have convinced yourself and others that you are wise and deserve to be king, but I know better.

How dare you sully our vision of the priceless jewel of wisdom with your selfish political steeple! God created neither the laws of mathematics nor the moral law. Moreover, it is not an agent's authority which imbues wisdom with its normativity. Lastly, only we are the source of wisdom's bindingness. Thus, why should we listen to a Ghost? I know why you say these words: you seek power veiled as wisdom through religious memetic injections.

Setting aside your motivations, I admire the proposed act embedded in your maxim: pursue wisdom. But, I also see your rhetorical slip. So listen, arrogant fool: the fear of God is neither intrinsically wise nor a necessary condition for the beginning of wisdom. Your twisted hermeneutical path is a school of philosophical hardknocks. I would know. I have truly wasted my life on that path, even in these words.

Yet, when I strip away the many religious and political layers of your poetic treatise, it is a matter of intellectual integrity that I say: even if for the wrong reasons, you're often right. Much of what you say is true in context. Indeed, regardless of your reasons, you collect collections of common sense and practical wisdom. I admire it. I build my own as well: [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]]. Of course, I see you hand out [[Diamonds]], but hoard your [[Redpills]]. How quietly and dishonestly selective of you! I am grateful at least something good came from your evil lips.
