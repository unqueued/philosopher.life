SEP 8 12:45 PM
Good lazy -sorry I work tonight so I have been soaking it up
SEP 8 6:09 PM
I'm glad you got to soak it up. How's this position been going for you?
MON 12:18 PM
And, how are the guys doing?
MON 12:18 PM
I’m confused? Still working for my friend and doing school pick ups for another lady. We are all doing well Esteban is working for the city now part time and Matthew is still fighting the good fight in finding something suitable for him to do
MON 1:44 PM
Hbu?
MON 1:44 PM
Good. I'm glad it's working out nicely.
MON 1:45 PM
What's Esteban doing for the city?
MON 1:45 PM
Opening and closing parks - basically
MON 1:46 PM
I hope he finds something which suits him. I think it's hard to do as an autistic man. My uncle (on my wife's side) is a genius, but he faces some difficult barriers.
MON 1:46 PM
Cool. That sounds pleasant.
MON 1:46 PM
I'm doing okay. Grinding along. Teaching my offpspring and my public children at the middle school.
MON 1:47 PM
Yea that’s the challenge is getting him in the door but once he gets the opportunity he proves to work hard
MON 1:47 PM
Oh are you still at the middle school
MON 1:47 PM
How is your job hunt going?
MON 1:48 PM
Stopped for now. My job pays poorly, but I respect the work. Also, we're waiting to hear back from a dreamjob [[k0sh3k]] might get (would require us to move).
MON 1:49 PM
Oh wow congratulations :slightly_smiling_face:
MON 2:07 PM
I am hoping for the best you guys deserve it:pray:
MON 2:08 PM
It would be so cool if she got it. Trying not to get our hopes up. She definitely deserves it, but she's got some stiff competition.
MON 2:08 PM
What is it for?
MON 2:08 PM
Librarian position at Yale Divinity.
MON 2:09 PM
