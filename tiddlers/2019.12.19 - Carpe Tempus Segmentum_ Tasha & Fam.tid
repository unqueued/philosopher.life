title: 2019.12.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Tasha & Fam

* Woke at 9
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* Shower
* The Living Room was pwned. 
** We are on track.
* Clean for the party
* Dialectures
* Spoke with [[Charlie]]
** Finances seem okay for him. I think he's depressed. =/
** Talking about computers cheered him up. The man is a living relic; he has to walk me through these ancient mazes (and I walk him through contemporary ones to some extent).
* Literally Inform...FUCK. Not enough time.
** I can't believe I turned it down. I'm stupid. Problem with being fat, I just take way too long, including a shower.
* Talked with muh wife
* Grabbed food
* Tasha and Matthew came over
** Esteban was called into work.
** Pizza, alcohol, cookies, heck yeah.
** We talked for hours, and eventually Esteban joined us. 
*** The evening didn't end until about 11.
**** Everyone was clearly tired. I'm glad we ended on a good note.
*** I'm so grateful for the perspective they grant my offspring. So many things they say illuminate and verify.
** They invited us on the night before we move for dinner. They said we'd have nothing in the house (they are correct), so I'm grateful.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 4
** God, you are such a fool. Wat r u doing@!?!
