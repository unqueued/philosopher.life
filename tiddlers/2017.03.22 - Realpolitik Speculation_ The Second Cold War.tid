title: 2017.03.22 - Realpolitik Speculation: The Second Cold War

In 2013, Rex Tillerson at Exxon Mobile brokered a deal with Russia to extract oil from large swathes of Russian land. This oil was pumped through Ukraine. Ukraine taxed this oil and was seeking to join NATO (not quite Russian-friendly). Putin's attack on Ukraine in 2014 was to seize control of the port, eliminate taxation, and enrich himself (virtuous-of-the-practice kleptocrat that he is). Russia had been sanctioned. These handcuffs bottlenecked Putin's profits (I believe Putin has long been a dark money trillionaire). 

Fast-forward, and Rex Tillerson, recipient of the Russian Order of Friendship medal, is now our Secretary of State. Clearly, at least part of Trump's blackmail payment is installing Rex. Russian interference with our political processes and subversion of our pseudo-democratic election cycle has truly paid off for Putin. 

Assuming Trump even survives the political turmoil accumulation (and he might, he's straight fucking crazy and backed by many powerful interests; plus, he's made it this far), there is a reasonable chance that the sanctions made in the Obama era will be lifted. Putin stands to gain untold wealth; he continues to snowball hard. To be clear, the House approved a resolution killing SEC requirement for oil, gas, mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments. Further, the US Treasury Dept announced it’s easing sanctions to allow companies to do transactions with Russia’s FSB. Lastly, Steele, the infamous Dossier's compiler, predicted this as well. The string of high-profile deaths in Russia are no accident.<<ref "2">>

As I've noted [[before|2017.03.12 - Trump's Administrative Truncation]], the executive branch is being deconstructed. In its place, a handful of very successful psychopaths are taking even deeper control of it. The State Department has been purged, and Rex is going to own it from top to bottom. As Trump told us on the campaign trail, he would not be in charge of foreign or domestic affairs. He was telling the truth (as much as he could). Trump is the figurehead, the disposable scapegoat, the pawn and puppet. Rex, the capitalist of capitalists, is in bed with Putin. 

The American government has always been bought by the elite. Putin is an incredibly evil and dangerous man, and he's only joining the throng-pit of struggling gladiator-kings in our deep state. Who can solve these problems? Only we can.<<ref "1">> No, but for real, Russophobia may lead many Americans to give away their freedom even further (like the Patriot Act). I will not accept this false compromise.

In any case, we are clearly in a Second Cold War, fought not only on the world's stage, but also by proxy, in darkness, guerrilla-style, on the internet, and through backchannels and subterfuge.

<<footnotes "2" "For posterity's sake, I'd like to point out that in this edit that former Russian parliamentarian Denis Voronenkov, Putin critic of the annexation of Crimea, died a day after I wrote this post. This pattern is not an accident, and I can tell you, it's not God causing it (just human gods).">>
