title: 2020.01.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Much-Ballyhooed Rest

* Fuck me, I don't know. I was awake-ish for a couple hours after noon?
* Set offspring on tasks
* Without thinking, had them hit the store to make chili.
** I can't eat chili. Idiot. Lol.
* Fireman Time! 
** Sadly, barely. Good for you, homie.
* Shower
** My face is puffing up more.
*** Wife is having me use hemp oil on my face. 
* Curled up to die again
** I'm a fucking pansy
* Woke after wife came home
* Finished off [[m10]]-HTPC
* Sat as lump with my wife watching //Psych//.
* Grapes are delicious
* Wife said there was no way we were walking. 
** Fek. She's right.
** Got cookies instead.
* My son set up a humidifier for me. 
** Thank you, my dude.
* Read+Write
* Don't remember when I went to bed. Archer lightly in the background, sitting up.
** Still not able to sleep flat.
