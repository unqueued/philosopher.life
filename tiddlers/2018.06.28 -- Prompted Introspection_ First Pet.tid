title: 2018.06.28 -- Prompted Introspection: First Pet

!! What was your first pet? Why did you choose this pet?

First pet that I can remember our family having was a (street?) cat in Louisville. We had it for a s hort time. I do not know what became of it. I did not choose it. The cat was not particularly kind. I may have gone when my youngest brother was born (which would have made sense).
