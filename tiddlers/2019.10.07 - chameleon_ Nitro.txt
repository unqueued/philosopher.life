[9:55 PM] h0p3: Did you have nitro for that discord tag number? It's so leet. :slight_smile:
[6:40 AM] chameleon: Yup! Gotta have my emoji :kona:
[6:40 AM] chameleon: It was 1337, or 0420 or 6969 =w=.
[9:59 AM] h0p3: I am so tempted now, lol.
[10:00 AM] chameleon: it's worth it to use emoji everywhere I think. stuff like :thonk: is so indispensable to me, I struggle with off the cuff communication without it =w=.
oh, j3dih contacted me, I'm tying up a reply now!
[10:01 AM] h0p3: awesome ;P
[10:01 AM] h0p3: yeah, I hope to learn to incorporate emoji more effectively into my communication. I'm old, but I need to learn it.
[10:02 AM] chameleon: up to you really. I have a joke-kernel in my head about the stages of emoji grief. how do we deal with our precious unicode being taken up by silly faces
[10:03 AM] chameleon: I totally went through the whole denial-anger-bargaining-acceptance stuff, lol
[10:03 AM] h0p3: lol
[10:04 AM] chameleon: I notice you read that erotic poetry article that got posted I think to hn? It's a fun point. I do kinda do that, though I'm no poet. I write smut. lol
[11:36 AM] h0p3: Smut, ftw. It's my preference. I'm out of my league reading poetry.
