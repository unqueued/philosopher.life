title: 2020.03.27 - Prompted Introspection: Mostly Evil

!! "If someone gains, someone else loses." How much does this reflect life, and how much does it come up short. Reflecting upon this, how could your attitudes have been different during events in your past?

[[2018.06.20 - Prompted Introspection: Zero Sum]] gets at the core problem. Sure, obviously cooperation obtains even in capitalism, and our various economies can rarely be described as pure zero-sum games. At some point, the game does become zero-sum (or worse) though. There are physical limits in material dialectics to consider. 

Exploitation is still at the heart of how we've constructed our societies. I wish I took this more seriously from the beginning. It would have been easier to reverse-engineer the world if I took most people to be mostly evil.
