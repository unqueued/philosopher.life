title: 2019.05.14 - Prompted Introspection: Sunday Simulations

!! What did your family do on Sundays as a child?

I've answered this before: [[2018.03.30 - Prompted Introspection Log: Sunday Childhood]]. Sundays were generally quite busy. It was a day of simulation for us. We'd walk into these institutions surrounded by these people who acted like they gave a shit, and vanishingly few did. It was a place for people to virtue signal and selfishly social network. Otherwise, people got their emotional rocks off. It was a sham, and good questions were heavily punished. Afterward, we'd have a debriefing over a meal to make sure we understand the simulation was real all along.

Outside of the gaslighting, we did have some real conversation during mealtime. I like eating and talking.
