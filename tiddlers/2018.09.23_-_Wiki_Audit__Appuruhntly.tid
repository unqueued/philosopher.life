So, apparently, because I'm halfwit, I didn't fully understand that I'm supposed to use [[$:/plugins/sphygmus/reviewButton/settings]] each day! It's not just a set and forget! That's why it was built, so I can change the title.Titles on the fly. This is still difficult for Prompted Introspection. But, I have the core a button, and each function can do something different. This is a fantastic starting place! It's such satisfying Win Button.
