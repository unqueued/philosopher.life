title: 2010.08.31 -- Inferentialism’s Normative Nature

Brandom explains that judgments express the inferential commitments for which we are responsible.1 His inclusion (and reliance upon) the words ‘judgment’ and ‘responsible’ are very interesting here; they imply sapience and morality. Perhaps the process of inference is so meaningful directly because it entails normative (moral) responsibility – that would certainly make the ability to ‘infer’ something quite special (a point Brandom wants to make). This makes sense if we are to assume that Brandom’s inferentialism is based upon distinguishing the sapient from the non-sapient, those who are generating and expressing inferences from those who are not, the morally responsible agents from the amoral agents.

The normative/ethical nature of judgments within the inferential process coincides nicely with Brandom’s conception of rational intentionality and expressivism when he explains that it is the (possibility of?) rational justification of our judgments that allows us to be entitled to our commitments.2 Certainly, we would like to think that the pursuit of wisdom associated with sapience must be justified through reason. Additionally, while offering good reasons for normative claims might justify one’s entitlement to make those claims, it is clear that more is required than just mere logic and good reason to generate (as perhaps different from justifying) meaningful inferential commitments. Essentially, this notion of ‘entitlement’ assumes we have moral responsibility for whatever claims to which we commit ourselves.

It seems to me that every inferential-agent’s action or expression which is differentiated (as opposed to assimilationism)3 from (and thus ‘greater’ than) a parrot’s rests upon some notion of (or perhaps is equivalent to) making normative judgments/claims in Brandom’s world. Expressions are making normative claims in that they make explicit a person’s endorsement of a set of inferences. Perhaps these normative expressions are saying, ‘Anyone “in my shoes” should think like this, ought to express something like this, and is morally obligated to act like this’. Essentially, acknowledging an inferential commitment is the same as expressing a normative claim. In this, would we not say that the practice of making inferences is also the practice (of the study) of ethics? Should we say that what it means to be truly ‘rational’ is the same thing as ‘morally responsible’?

Also, I suggest that the traditional nature of ‘responsibility’, as posed by judgments found in the process of inference, leads us to the assumption that (free-will) agency is a distinct and necessary aspect of inferential-agents (eschewing compatibilism). Insofar as moral responsibility is a requirement of inferential-agency, it doesn’t seem possible for deterministic beings to be inferential-agents. Computers are like parrots, and may never be anything more. I don’t think Brandom can accept a purely naturalistic (assuming the laws of physics are deterministic) account of the universe very easily.

Brandom goes on to say, “We are rational creatures exactly insofar as our acknowledgment of discursive commitments (both doxastic and practical) makes a difference to what we go on to do.”4 If perhaps ‘rational’ is equitable to ‘moral’ in this quote, then it has even more profound implications. Not only is it the case that only thoughts that lead to expression or action can be moral ones (a ton of implications in ethical theory), but it must be a certain sort of expression or action which can possibly (or if we read more explicitly, in fact ‘actually’) differ directly because we are responsible for them via free-will agency. So, insofar as free-will agency adjusts our expression or action, as compared to what we might ‘normally’ do without that agency, we are morally responsible and rational creatures generating meaningful inferences which are differentiated from something like a parrot or a computer.
