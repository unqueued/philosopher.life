title: 2018.12.15 - RGM Notes: Absolute Unit

* The purpose of recording information to is to reuse it.
** It turns out that I don't know what I don't know, which means I don't know what information I'm going to reuse, therefore I don't know which [[dok]] of information is worth recording in any context.
** Thus, I machine-shotgun information into this wiki to have material to work with. (You shitty modeler :P)
*** It is much easier (or even just possible) to prune than to remember what to add to the wiki retroactively. Sometimes, you are in the zone and you only have that brief flowstate window to GET IT OUT!
*** Given the nature of this wiki, in modeling myself and world, it turns out that I have a lot more breathing room to make mistakes and have fluff. It's Human! In a sense, making mistakes (and showing myself evolve to fix them) just is part of the information I aim to record here. 
** It turns out I want to add information directly from [[others]] into my wiki (with safety and organization!).
*** I didn't anticipate this originally. I had no fucking clue what I might be building (and I still don't).
*** This complicates the [[RGM]] significantly (which has already grown complex on the front/top end to serve output in a way I deem acceptable).
**** It turns out that multi-device, multi-user, multi-windowed simultaneous editing is what I want (and, ofc, it's a dangerous path). All the locks!
** I can't always reuse information as it is (sometimes, a human must reuse it directly). The work in this tiddler is structured in a particular way, and I will likely have to completely redraft. Knowing when to reuse information for drafting (and retiring work) vs. actually reusing it programmatically is my real task.
*** Therefore, information reuse is either through reiterating from scratch by extracting the [[diamonds]] and [[redpills]] from old work to create new work, or it is reused through linking and building larger emergent structures on top of it (or, why not both!?).
**** Hello, Dialectic! Sublation or Sublatee

* To optimize reuse we must chunk content into the smallest meaningful atoms.
** Oh, mercy. Preach to me. Tell me how it's done, son. I will never solve this problem correctly all the way down. Yet again, this is a philosophical problem beyond the reach of a wiki to solve. I cannot know the answer by definition, but I can make progress along that [[infinigress]].
** I clearly don't even know what //optimize// means here. Optimal for the sake of what? It seems like I can contrive examples that will be the exception to any rule I can give (classic problem). This, of course, gives rise to the [[gfwiwcgws]] consideration. I cannot answer that rabbithole.
** A daily CPU's clock-cycle is 11.57ÂµHz
** [[Deep Reading]] demonstrated this failure cleanly.
*** Though it turned out to be useful to explain to my children how they can prove they did their work.
** Currently, I have logs, directories, and other permacontent. I chunk log content into days and further chunking occurs from the syntactic structuring. Other than that, I try to keep it unified. The structures I build sometimes give rise to my next evolution (hopefully with some notion of how I can automate part of the process.
** This is a gunky mereological process.
** Chunking is costly in terms of the number of .tids generated and iteration over all tids.

* Assign sufficient metadata to fragments in order to weave new structures
** This is what I'm doing in [[The Remodeling]].
** It's clear that I will have to continuously update metadata (and, unfortunately, that means I will also have to be able to very clearly reason about how this will affect the structures of this wiki).
** I've noticed I'm tagging a lot of fucking intersection. I just don't know where things belong, and so I've started putting them somewhere and saying, "oh yeah, and they also belong here and there too."
** I still cannot even begin to see far enough into how this might possibly affect the [[RGM]].
*** I am very worried about relying upon externalizing any automated process. The core structures need to be internal, not external. That said, a lot of the magic I'm looking for requires taking in externalities [[irwartfrr]]. I feel like I'm building a mind here (straight out of my epistemology courses).

* ??? WHAT AM I MISSING ???
