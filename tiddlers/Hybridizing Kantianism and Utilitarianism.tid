title: Hybridizing Kantianism and Utilitarianism

It is an obvious fact that Virtue Theory offers no obvious content-giving to decision procedures (they are even proud of the fact they don't have a rational ([[Frontal lobe rationality]]). Virtue Theory is the moral theory of the Fastmind. It pieces enough confabulations together that its Teleology can appear justified. Who is in control fundamentally? The Fastmind or the Slowmind? The Fastmind is clearly capable of being a warzone of rising intuitions and splinters in us. 

Kant's Groundwork is a masterpiece of masterpieces. Kant, imho, was the smartest person to have ever lived. His type: a scholar's scholar's scholar. He was the Archimedes, the Shakespeare, the most praiseworthy of all philosophers. I am proud to have even understood what I understand of his work. Kant was deeply virtuous man, and a man I could only aspire to be like. Kant was my hero. And, yet, even masterpieces of masterpieces can have mistakes in them. 

Kantians have never given fundamentally good explanations of how to implement Utilitarian thought (which is obviously true, to some degree, in any plausible moral system I've found). Kant seems to deny it outright, but it is obviously not effective at explaining key ways in which we employ the CI today. But, even if we weren't to deny it, Kantians still can't explain how Utility fits into the CI to a reasonable enough extent. It is a critical flaw, as far as I'm concerned. The problem is that utilitarian equations only seem to matter too far towards the end of the decision procedure found in the [[CI]]. Utility is clearly very deeply embedded in the CI decision procedure; integrated beyond what many people want to realize. Kantian's are very emotional people (fucking brilliantly intelligent and literal in so many ways too).
