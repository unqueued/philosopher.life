!! About:

//The identity problem of naming is a fundamental philosophical problem in logic and almost all subjects and subjectivities (which may just be almost everything we can [[SO]] phenomenologically access in our ability to linguistically represent it to ourselves). Go forth, sir. Mystically put down your [[Straussian]] tentpegs of faith in [[Reality]] down in the desert. Blindly behold [[The True Contradiction]]. Humbly conceive of the inconceivable; wisely speak of the unspeakable. [[Good]] luck in becoming virtuous in the practice of naming (especially naming the essence of essence), homie; it may be philosophy itself.//

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with [[The Good]], and the Word was [[Good]]. The name that can be named is not [[The Eternal]] name. [[The Nameless]] is the beginning [and end] of heaven and earth. [The [[I Am]]iest of [[I Am]]'s is] the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. [Indeed, [[The Unmoved Telos]] is necessarily [[The Unlimited]] asserted by all possible limits.] [[The Unnameable]] is [[The Eternal]]ly [[Real]]. Naming is the origin of all particular things. [Thus, as [[The Foundation]], only [[The Infinite]] can completely, unifyingly, and [[Salient|The Salience]]ly name [[Itself]] [[The Universal]] particular [[irwartfrr]] into [[infinigress]].]

Names and attributes must be accommodated to the essence of things, and not the essence to the names, since things come first and names afterwards.

I confused things with their names: that is belief.

The adjective “indescribable” is, by definition, never correct.

I despise circularly contradicting myself, but there is a place where I have no other choice. What's a philosopher to do? We subjectively lay our roses down at the correlationist grave of [[The Object]]ivity; for us it is the never-ending moving representative goalpost continously adjusted to the limit of our [[fff]] capacities. We will never be [[Perfect]], but we must pursue [[It]] as [[Perfect]]ly as we can. [[Reality]] is real enough to name it [[Real]], even if we can never really know what that really means all the way down into [[infinigress]]. Like all symbols, aliases are always incomplete distortions and semblances of that which they represent. [[The Thing]]iest thing-in-itself is noumenally outside us by trascendental definition, and yet I remain convinced we [[right]]fully access and name it with naked realism.

This [[hlexical]] page exists because I'm forced to speak of [[The Good]] using names.  I must dialectically speak of [[The Dialetheia]] [[irwartfrr]], and I must have a fitting name for each context as best I can. How can [[this|h0p3]] conditional [[fff]] self-modeler [[hope]] to model [[The Absolute]] self-modeling model? How can I more humbly make sure I have carefully constructed a finite model of [[The Infinite]] from my own models without unacceptably anthropomorphizing [[It]]? I don't know what I don't know, and I can't know the unknowable any more than to whatever [[dok]] I can paradoxically know it. I can only attempt to escape my context so far, and I cannot sublate [[The Sublator]]. I cannot name it effectively enough with any collection of names (and I never will), but some names are more worthy and pointed than others.<<ref "h">> 

In the end, what is the collection and ordering of the namiest names of [[The Good]]? I better start collecting muh [[hlexical]] [[aliases]]. I must describe and verbally justify the ineffable and self-explaining unexplainable-to-all-else. [[It]]'s unlimited, unconditional, absolute, unified, universal self-perspectival qualia is [[The One]] and only unified one that is intrinsically valuable. [[It]] is [[The Unmoved Telos]], and all contexts depend upon it.

An alias is an individual constant which picks out some particular object in our assumed universal computable memory domain. An alias is not a function which we conceptually recursively resolve. An alias is a finite [[FO]]L naming term used by the signifier (a language using agent) to directly map a sign (syntactic symbols) to the signified (the represented semantic object). Aliases are simple pointers. I hope to demonstrate to myself what matters most, in part, by collecting and expanding my naming conventions for particularly valuable hyperobjects I seek with this wiki. I seek the signal of all signals as significantly as I can. I'm still unsure of how to effectively reason about an object having many names or an object which gives many objects one name. 

Lastly, this [[plugin|$:/plugins/mklauber/aliases]]-based project is overdetermined because I need it not only to reason about the names of [[The Good]], but also to [[antipleonasmic]]ally limit the friction of self-expression in this wiki at large. I [[hope]] to make speaking in links incredibly convenient.

<<footnotes "h" "It is not 'He who should not be named', but rather that which we are all obligated to try name even though we can't as well as we'd like. It is our plight to reach in faith for the impossible; we must seek to make the impractical as practical as we can dialectically generate it. There is no ought without putting doing our best name(s) to it.">>
