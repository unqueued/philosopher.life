title: Pipevan

Space is at a premium, so spend it wisely. I don't need walking space. I think that's a waste. I'm fine with being on my hands and knees, as long as I have a bed and a desk somewhere in the van. Every surface is a place for stuff. I want to be comfortable on my computer. I want food and drink. I don't want to be too hot or cold. It needs to be sustainable, safe, and cheap.

Bathrooms, Showers, etc.:

* Outside
* 24-hour businesses
* Fitness centers with month-by-month memberships

What am I storing?

* Clothes, shoes
* Basic toiletries
* Water
* Food
* Equipment, tools
* Computer equipment

Bedding, sitting:

* Consider a bed/couch combo. This requires real thought.
* Ideally, I'd have a couch during the day to play, read, write, think, etc.
* Ideally, I'd have as much space on as comfortable a mattress as possible to sleep on.

** Both sides of the van should have shelves. I don't care if the side opens. The back and front are all I need.
