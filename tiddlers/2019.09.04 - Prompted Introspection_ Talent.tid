title: 2019.09.04 - Prompted Introspection: Talent

!! Which talent would you most like to have?

What talent enables me to do the most [[good]] [[irwartfrr]] in the world? That one. I have no idea what that is, but my best guess is to build open trust, engage in philosophical wrestling with integrity, show people what it means to sacrificially [[love]], and race for answers to the crises faced by billions of people currently living and those yet to come. Talents tend to be emergent practices, and so I've technically answered the question. I'd like to give more particular answers.

I think my wiki has the best chance of doing anything. It scales. It shows the basics, the ugly, the hard work, it's realpolitik, and it has many of the technical properties I find necessary. My competitive advantages are not in computing, but that is an area of interest (I won't say competence) that is fairly rare among my academic brethren who specialize in moral philosophy and the surrounding branches. I'm not looking for something academic here since that ladder is a waste of my time, but I aim to apply the theory I understand. I don't predict my success at having any significant impact either. Unfortunately, I have to risk big and almost surely fail. 

I need the [[talent|https://www.kickscondor.com/ferocious-irony/]]<<ref "r">> of having [[hope]] [[irwartfrr]]. I want to be him. I //must// be the most [[arrogant]] sumbitch who ever lived, :P.
