title: 2019.12.20 - Antipleonasm Analysis: The Closet

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Whether we are Christians or Muslims or nationalists or agnostics or atheists, we must first learn to forget our differences. If we have differences, let us differ in the closet; when we come out in front, let us not have anything to argue about until we get finished arguing with the man.
<<<

One of those things is not like the others, but I'll try to forget the difference here, sir. I can appreciate attempting to set aside our insignificant differences in compromise to have the collective power to defeat significant differences with the structures and agents of profound injustice. What I admire about this claim is that there are some things which we must all universally share in common, and I'm quite interested in that (though, the nationalist will have to make fundamental concessions, except in some ad hoc sense where we might talk about how what is best for their nation on average behind the [[VOI]] would result or be in favor of cosmopolitan justice).

You will still need to argue outside the closet, but that can (and should) be minimized in various respects.
