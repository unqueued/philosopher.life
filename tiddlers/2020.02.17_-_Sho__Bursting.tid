Feb 13 5:25pm
So what are your plans for the weekend?
Feb 14 2:57pm
hey, dude. just ha da wee read of your post, there. 
you think too much. it makes my head hurt, reading your thinking lol
that said, i did recognise a lot of stuff that Ed and I have always done naturally, so that's cool. Not that I didnae ken we are 'special' lol
Feb 15 6:41am
nae plans, per se. 
our train (from Fife) to Jorvik is Weds; we were planning on getting the ferry to mainland on Monday. However, last Monday I looked at forecast and went, uh, we need to get off this island on Thursday or we may not get off at all.
Which, at this point, has proven correct
Feb 15 6:46am
so, in the meantime, we've got several days here in Fife at Ed's auld auntie's. Which is HARD, cause she is seriously courting dementia at this point :(
Feb 15 6:47am
it's not been too bad so far; the first night we went roond and hung out with some friends, and last night we just so happened to wander by an old friend of ed's who is only here a few months a year; she's the widow of a good musician friend of his from the area who died years ago. Really, really sad. Fell doon a hole which is now the spiral staircase in the ruin they did up.
Feb 15 6:51am
but anyway, we got the old lady stoned and we all blethered on about all kinds of interesting things for about six hours lol
Feb 15 6:51am
but otherwise, nae plans. weather is shite. currently just sitting in the living room with the old lady; ed's on his phone, i'm gonnae do some surveys... we had to turn the telly over to Simpsons because everything else was PISSING US OFF too much. Fucking BBC, imperialist lying manipulative CUNT BASTARDS AHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Feb 15 6:52am
but it's not JUST BBC, sadly. Just generally, there's so much brainwashing propaganda bullshit. And does it work? Of course it does. fucking sheeple muppet stupid distracted 5G/AR-loving dumb fucks.
Feb 15 6:53am
pretty obvious why we dinnae have/watch telly, eh?
Feb 15 6:53am
I hear you're getting a lie-in today. ENJOY!! :)
Feb 15 6:53am
Aye. I thought intimacy was worth thinking about. It's something I'm still trying to pick out in my remote relationships, which isn't so easy. But, sadly, most of my family and friends are remote to me; I don't get to see them in person offline much (or at all).
Feb 16 12:13am
Your situation sounds frustrating.
Feb 16 12:15am
I'm glad you had a chance to talk with the old lady for hours. Sounds like a great use of your time.
Feb 16 12:15am
My own perception of BBC has changed over the years. I grew up thinking it was an exemplary media organization (one which American media companies failed to live up to). It has been sad to see that I've been so very wrong (and misled).
Feb 16 12:16am
I've not seen a Simpsons episode in forever. It's not exactly braincandy either, since I think they can be realpolitik and talk about currents in a way that so many other shows simply can't.
Feb 16 12:18am
Yeah, we got a break today too. It was outstanding.
Feb 16 12:18am
We're actually getting pretty scared, here, being stuck in 'the UK'. For all we were already aware of, in terms of propaganda and so on, the few days we've been here at Ena's and seeing the telly... oh my GODS, it is seriously terrifying! EVERYTHING on the telly (apart from all the lying, abstracting, dumbing-down, distracting advertising) is propaganda. BBC Scotland have a show now about Scotland's History - we dare not watch it. BBC! We ken what their agenda is.
It isn't even hidden. It was announced weeks ago that the tories are in the process of creating a FIVE MILLION POUND (of taxpayer money!!!!!) propaganda campaign to COMBAT the independence movement. They are literally releasing articles, adverts, films etc - things to be shown in Scottish cinemas - all to tell people independence would be horrible and to push the concept of a 'united UK'. 
There was a show about 'our coasts' the other day - made the very obvious point of coasts shown being in England, Wales, Scotland and N Ireland. There is SO much on about the fucking royals, it's DISGUSTING. Just things licking their arseholes and telling people the monarchy is relevant and wonderful... there are lots of adverts for the Army, the Navy, targeting poor people in deprived areas. Not new, I realise, but increased, I think, and in tandem with everything else...!? I cannae mind the details now but there was another show on BBC I saw that was blatant propaganda. 
Then there's an advert for 'the next big film' coming out - Military Wives!
I'm not even joking.
This place is becoming more 1984 by the day, literally. Ed has not yet ruled out that we might have to find somewhere in europe to go and stay and try to get jobs (!?!?!?) before the end of this year. UK citizens have until the end of this year before the EU shuts the door on us being able to live/work there. 

But we dinnae want to move! Not to mention, how coudl we, really? we have almost nae money, not even enough to finish the hoose in the first place, and the hoose is meant to be our asset, really. (Can let out over summer to tourists for big money and live in a van or boat. Which is only our idea since we see how terrible the tourism is getting and how miserable we're likely to be staying on the island through the tourist season. Plus, loads more PIGS! I fucking hate the polis! Predatory cunts!)...
Feb 17 10:30am
The other idea is to ride this out best we can and, if/when necessary/possible, fuck off to some remote island in Shetland - the kind of place it takes 3 boats to get to and has a population so tiny they don't bother policing. That kind of thing.

Kind of like the wild west, except on a rock in the far north atlantic lol 
I dinnae ken. Obviously that cannae happen until the hoose is finished, either - though if the place does go to hell and we cannae bear to live there because it's become simply a summer resort for rich southerners, the only silver lining is that our property should be worth more. So, if we sell, we can hopefully find something small but not-too-shitty for cheap, and that can be our 'retirement'.

Oh, that's another thing! Adverts pushing people to get a pension. What a silly thing to do, at this point. Yes, please, keep some of my money now and give it to me later? Ha! I fucking think not. I'll keep what few pennies I have, now. And just pray to fuck there is SOME kind of healthcare available when I am older and need it (more than I do now; chronic mental illness means I already depend on it literally every day)...

It's hard not to despair. It's hard not to hate people. It's just so scary, because it's obvious that 'the plebs' are even dumber sheep than they've been in the past 100 years, and it gets worse all the time, with media, with social media, with tech (fucking 5G and Augmented Reality coming out in a big way, here, in April)... 

Sorry. I dinnae guess my bitching about it does any good but, honestly. I am (we are) scared.
Feb 17 10:30am
And the worse things get in the States, the worse they get here, too. The example of Trump, and of a person/party/rich interests being able to LITERALLY RIDE ROUGHSHOD over (what little, so-called) democracy there was... they get more and more emboldened.
I think it was last week, the tory government chucked thousands (? not sure the numbers) of folk of jamaican descent out of the country. Folk who were BORN HERE, or brought here young by their parents... it was ruled in court to be a violation of human rights, but they did it, anyway. What repercussions will there be for them? None. They can do what they want. More so all the time.
I cannae mind at the moment what the other thing I read recently was. Something about Boris just doing what he wants, even though there are laws meant to prevent it.

Oh! Another thing on the telly! I mean, this isn't even BBC, it's just everywhere, all the mainstream media... It was a show called Inside Extinction Rebellion: Martyrs or Maniacs?
Of course we didnae watch that, either, for sake of our fucking blood pressure etc., but even the adverts for it that we saw, full of phrases like 'questionable methods'... 
That's right. I saw a petition last week saying that various environmental and human rights protest groups (no doubt including Extinction Rebellion) have just been listed in the Police's ANTI-TERROR DOCUMENT. They are setting things up to make it even easier for them to persecute/prosecute protesters. This past weekend, some fucking reality star killed herself, so now there's all this outcry about how the media and public harassed her and weren't kind - they're now calling for clamping doon on what people can say online about celebrities and people in the public eye.
I mean, it's so obvious what's going on... as soon as we saw the thing yesterday about this lassie who killed herself, and the reactions, ed's like, I wonder if this is all just set up to clamp down on free speech.
Of course it is.
I'm very afraid. :(
Feb 17 10:30am
I am swine when it comes to the history of Scotland (despite having blood relatives from there). Mixed feelings about the topic for me. Nationalism is a problem for me.
Feb 18 1:58am
How the fuck is taxpayer money used for that? I know the US is even worse here; it's still mind-blowing to me.
Feb 18 1:59am
You know what, sometimes your explanation of the world makes me want to slit throats, lol.
Feb 18 1:59am
Would it be hard to get back to the UK after being in the EU?
Feb 18 2:00am
If it wouldn't be hard, that seems like a good move to make.
Feb 18 2:01am
I know you don't want to move from the place you love. =(.
Feb 18 2:01am
I can't imagine being in your shoes (I'm not a skilled empath).
Feb 18 2:01am

You
You know what, sometimes your explanation of the world makes me want to slit throats, lol.
Is it my explanation thereof? Or is it just The World? 
I reckon the truth is somewhere in between.
Still, if more people feel like I/we feel, maybe some positive change would happen?
After violence, of course, because 'the elite' speak no other language.

Want to share a few things with you....
Feb 18 4:07am
first, this article - which is from 2014 so obv some details are outdated, but it's a fair simple summary of why 'nationalism' in Scotland is NOT the nationalism that does (and should) make people fear for the safety of minorities etc... https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/16/scottish-nationalism-british-westminster-class
Feb 18 4:08am
Next some lyrics/a poem:

What am I supposed to do
If I want to talk about peace and understanding
But you only understand the language of the sword
What if I want to make you understand that the path you chose leads to downfall
But you only understand the language of the sword
What if I want to tell you to leave me and my beloved ones in peace
But you only understand the language of the sword
 
I let the blade do the talking...
So my tongue shall become iron
And my words the mighty roar of war
Revealing my divine anger´s arrow shall strike
 
All action for the good of all
I see my reflection in your eyes
But my new age has just begun
 
The sword is soft
In the fire of the furnace
It hungers to be hit
And wants to have a hundred sisters
In the coldest state of their existence
They may dance the maddest
In the morass of the red rain
 
Beloved brother enemy
I sing my sword song for you
The lullaby of obliteration
So I can wake up with a smile
And bliss in my heart
And bliss in my heart
And bliss in my heart
 
Coexistence, Conflict, combat
Devastation, regeneration, transformation
That is the best I can do for you
 
I see a grey gloom on the horizon
That promises a powerful sun to rise
To melt away all moons
It will make the old fires of purification
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers

That's actually the first thing that 'caught' me about Heilung - this poem, the sentiment/concept behind it. Simple, pragmatic. Shows how love and violence can - and sometimes must - coexist.... I dinnae ken. See what you make of it, anyway. I find it pretty powerful ;)
Feb 18 4:11am
Ed's grasp of Scottish history is fantastic (and mine not bad, either ;) so if you ever have any questions, just let me/us know. 
He can also provide some 'do' and 'definitely dinnae!' resources, too.
Feb 18 4:12am
as you can imagine, this recent BBC Scotland production is only the most recent of MANY years/centuries of dis-/misinformation and propaganda.
Feb 18 4:14am
I sent all that I wrote there yesterday to a few friends... an elderly close friend who is in AZ these days (volunteers a LOT with charities helping immigrants at the border etc) said she's genuinely afraid of civil war. 
She said Trump is sending the military into sanctuary cities looking for immigrants.
That is some straight-up Nazi Germany (or WWII USA!) shit right there. Terrifying. Sad.

She also said she tries not to think 'like this' because it only causes anxiety, which is fair enough. We need to tune out. Again. We had tuned out, but being here 'in the world', exposed to telly and advertising etc... ah!!!!!
Get me back to my remote rock!

Bit worried about the trip doon into england, actually. just in the sense that we will be in proximity to even more people who are fucking WRONG than usual. Exposed to more advertising and propaganda. Will have to try my best to avoid fighting with anyone (if they start it. I'll try to avoid the subject(s) entirely!) Anyway. I'm sure we'll have lots of fun too, of course, in the fucking floods... lol
Feb 18 4:17am
The world is getting almost biblical, man. But not in the good sense (if there is/was one! hahaha ;)
Feb 18 4:17am
Ah, it's the world that makes me that way. I appreciate how honest you can be, particularly about what is so painful.
Feb 19 2:02pm
I agree that 'the elite' speak no other language. Evolution selects for psychopaths in free markets, and they continue to centralize power through many kinds of violence against humanity.
Feb 19 2:03pm
I'm a cosmopolitan. I'm opposed to building a world that is divided by nations. Nationalism, in the US, for example, results in behaviors toward the world which fail to help the poor. I don't think we really morally own ourselves.
Feb 19 2:05pm
I can appreciate the desire for self-determination, but what is that self-determination good for? And, it turns out, building a self-determined tribe which protects in the ingroup is extremely difficult to do in a justifiable manner (and leads essentially a corporation).
Feb 19 2:06pm
I agree that Scotland is not fairly represented, that your rights are infringed upon, and that British imperialism has generally been immoral in history.
Feb 19 2:07pm
I also agree that [[love]] is violent in some cases. Some people conflate niceness and kindness, but this is a conceptual error.
Feb 19 2:22pm
I do not know the extent to which immigrants are being rounded up. It is occurring though. We have concentration camps.
Feb 19 2:23pm
It is terrifying.
Feb 19 2:23pm
I can appreciate that sometimes we need to take a break from the world. Reasoning about the limits of our powerlessness is a difficult kind of emotional labor.
Feb 19 2:24pm
Dialectical division is stronger than ever. I already consider us to be at war, and I don't think we ever left it. WWII never actually ended, to my eyes.
