Some other cool ones. Lots and lots of small little guys out here with their hot rods. Lots of fun. Gotta get more pics tomorrow.

I like the pool noodles. Makes good sense.
SEP 28 8:23 PM
I'm glad it's been a good time for you too.
SEP 28 8:24 PM
We had a mini meltdown when we were at the car show. And Tuesday night. Lol. But we work it out as a family. You understand. Have to come an agreement to not argue, annoy, or show bad attitude.
SEP 28 8:25 PM
It has been a good weekend. Indeed. Not alot of kids. All old people. But we like meeting new friends.
SEP 28 8:26 PM
I hear that. It's hard work, no doubt.
SEP 28 8:27 PM
I bet it's very relaxing out there. 
SEP 28 8:27 PM
Enough a substances get me there. Yes indeed.
SEP 28 8:29 PM
Lol
SEP 28 8:29 PM
Haha, noice.
SEP 28 8:29 PM
PBR tonight. Been a while. Hipster pee is still delicious.
SEP 28 8:29 PM
Haven't seen sober Trent in awhile except at work. He is kinda a square.
SEP 28 8:29 PM
Only a square uses that word.
SEP 28 8:30 PM
(not true, actually, I like it when I can get it perfectly square)
SEP 28 8:30 PM

Cheladas. The usual for me. And some airplane bottle is southern comfort. Some kratom, Valium... I'm trying to find my happy spot. Likely be bedtime.
SEP 28 8:30 PM
Good. That is the perfect place to get smashed.
SEP 28 8:31 PM
I'll have to try cheladas again in your honor.
SEP 28 8:31 PM
Shit, I drink them for breakfast on the weekends.
SEP 28 8:32 PM
Lol. Have to take plenty if acid reflux meds though.
SEP 28 8:33 PM
Sadly that combo isn't smashed for me... Just  relaxed... You know how it is...
SEP 28 8:33 PM
That is a good idea.
SEP 28 8:34 PM
Will take some now.
SEP 28 8:34 PM
Pizza and beer tonight for us.
SEP 28 8:35 PM
Yeah. Always gotta take some one pizza night.
