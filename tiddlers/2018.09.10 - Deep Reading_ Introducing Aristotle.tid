title: 2018.09.10 - Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

Let me grant that Aristotle lacks an explicit systematic philosophy of mind. I think if we're Straussian, you can see his intentionality, perception, and epistemic pointing. His teleology and metaphysics have something strong to say. It's obvious to me that for human cognition he is a dualist. Whatever resides in our mind, some part of mind, is just not a physical thing. Aristotle's God may serve as a very important guide as well. 

It's super important that you realize his moral psychology is STILL extremely powerful thousands of years later. He was pointing to it and screaming the entire fucking time! How do you not see it?! Are you blind? The ready-to-hand, [[fastmind]] vs. [[slowmind]] dialectic is there. The issue of non-cognitivism in virtue theory is beating you over the head with that fundamental aspect of our psychology. Are you really not going to point out his genius here? 

I'm a fanboi disciple. Of course this is all I can see. 

I need to relax. I should not get worked up about an intro cartoon book. This is a strong introduction to a broad set of materials. No, it is not as charitable as it could be. Yes, it gives the most common interpretations. This is a good book!
