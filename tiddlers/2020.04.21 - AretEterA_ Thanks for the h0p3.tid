title: 2020.04.21 - AretEterA: Thanks for the h0p3

There's so much to unpack from your Tiddlywiki I don't even know where to begin.. Just want to give you a genuine thanks for the insights I'm sure to gain from diving in to this. Straight up grateful for this gift and I plan/wish to reciprocate some value when my circumstances align, but for now I want you to know that your comment yesterday will (has already) project my life towards a more positive outcome.

For context, I'm in the process of reconstructing myself. So this here if fucking gold! Again, I really appreciate this!

Thank you so much!
