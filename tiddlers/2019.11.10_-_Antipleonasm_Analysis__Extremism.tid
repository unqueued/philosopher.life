title: 2019.11.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Extremism

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I don't believe in any form of unjustified extremism! But when a man is exercising extremism — a human being is exercising extremism — in defense of liberty for human beings, it's no vice, and when one is moderate in the pursuit of justice for human beings, I say he is a sinner.

PREACH, YO! 

The only qualifier that matters is at the heart of your argument. You know it. Of course, unjustified X is unjustified. I appreciate that you make a window and explain that there are limits to it. Of course, I can't say the defense of liberty for human beings is an unimpregnable fortress, but I suggest you would be willing to wrestle with me on the principles of justice. You call out the reactionaries, passive pacificists, the viciousness of moderation as a convenient Slip. You recognize that how we spend our lives as a whole (all the way to the extrema) matters. I can see why people hated you (and still do). I'm grateful for your transmissions, Saint.
