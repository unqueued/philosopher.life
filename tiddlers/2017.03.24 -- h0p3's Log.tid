Had a flat tired last week. Something about the car has been off since it was replaced. It has been vibrating and getting worse. I took it into the Wal-Mart tire center here. They said they would look at it for free (since it was a Wal-Mart that fixed it a week ago). I got an oil change as well, since...might as well, right? Turns out the other front tire was about to go. They also recommended I get a new rim and control arm. I'm gonna check around to see if I can find a cheap one. I'm not sure if I can change it myself, but I probably should. I changed the front end on our old black Toyota before. I can probably figure this one out too (that said, if I get it wrong, it would be incredibly costly, possibly).
