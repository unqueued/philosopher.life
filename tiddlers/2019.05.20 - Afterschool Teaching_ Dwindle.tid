Today is Matt's last day. It has been anticlimactic for him. Not many kids are staying, most are already basically on summer vacation. Everyone shows movies and cleans. It's really a kind of upkeep and babysitting set of days for everyone. They do what we do, basically. Lol.

We had fruit smoothies. Matt wanted to watch movies, but I had a bunch of kids ask to go to the lab. Awesome. I'd rather you interact with each other over your computers than being drained by the boobtube. They are very concerned with information advantages in their games, and the girls are more likely to explore communications platforms. Cool.

Several students built remote control robots. Several needed help setting up email accounts to get Pandora accounts. 6CM was clever with her alt-tabbing. 

I had to intervene for 5HS today. She's allergic to strawberries, and I'm glad I caught it. I cleaned up the equipment before they made hers. 

I asked every child what they'll be doing this summer, except 5CM because we've talked about it extensively. 7Gf is going to be volunteering at the public library with her mom (neat). 7SR is reading a book this summer, and I am shocked. She was excited to tell me about it (even though she is normally proud of hating books). 6JK is mowing lawns and saving for theme parks. Everyone else intends to do nothing. 

Matt is forcing the students to prove they are on approved websites. I have no power over that.

The Janitor was worried he wouldn't see me again. I gave him my offline card. He said he would share it with no one. ''If you ever read this, sir: `/wave` =)
''
Matt called me to the office. It was time to go. I told him not to take it the wrong way, but I hoped to never see him again except in public. I wish the man luck. May he become a philosopher and counselor the children need. We laughed, I departed.
