* Letters. You have 3.
* Cover letters and apps for the sysadmin job and perhaps webdev.
* Continue to get your offspring to do their best even when no one is looking.
* Do your interview. I don't expect much will occur. 
* Work
* Burn the produce and fruit left in the house. You are shopping on Saturday.
