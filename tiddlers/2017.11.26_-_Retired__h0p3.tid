//It turned out that [[h0p3]] was an important page to me. This page represented a lot to me. There is a way in which I still felt ashamed or icky about taking myself seriously. I am grateful to myself for having taken the time have made this [[Relic]] in the first place. Who knows where I'd be without it. I have to say: this page reads like a suicide note to me.//

---

//I dedicate this page to the following homo sapien philosophers, existentialists, and teachers of humanity: My Parents, Jesus Christ, St. Paul, Kant, Kierkegaard, Frankl, Plato, Aristotle, Hursthouse, Korsgaard, Frankfurt, Marx, Heidegger, Nietzsche, Dabrowski, and Laozi.<<ref "0">> I'd like to think I'm here because of them.//

//I think my mother would agree that I still keep coming back to play with my legos.//

Who was I?

Previously, [[gdoghomes]] and [[4eak]]. In this wiki, I am entering a new chapter of my life. Hence, my name change.

Who do I think I am and will be?<<ref "1">>

h0p3 is:

* the spouse of [[k0sh3k]], father of [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]]
* a pipefitter apprentice
* an analytic philosopher with an increasing appreciation for Continental and Eastern philosophy<<ref "2">>
* a grey hat computer zealot, freedom fighter, monkeywrencher, and guerilla librarian
* autistic, depressed, anxious, emotionally scarred, lonely, entangled in a volatile fight-or-flight response cycle toward the world
* a poor, broken man, and a box of contradictions, with few options and a bleak outlook
* a reality junkie, cynical skeptic, idealist, contemplative psychonaut, and introspectionist with a very sensitive moral compass
* lost in the desert, voraciously hungry for mythemal fruits from the Trees of Life and Knowledge, wrestling with himself and the transcendental<<ref "3">>
* seeking to be as excellent as practically possible, integrated, well-constituted, unified, empathic, authentic, knowledgeable, enlightened, justified, useful and productive, acceptable if not worthy, and happy
* finding himself; finding h0p3

At the very least, most of this is impolite to say about oneself. It comes off as arrogant, lacking in humility, deceptive virtue signaling, dark-triadic, or cryptically self-important. But, guess what? My life is important to me. I want it to mean something, even if it only means something to me. I might not be doing a good job of it, but I'm at least trying. I wandering, throwing off my dogmatic yokes, and doing my best to find the truth in the desert.

I believe most people would despise what I'm trying to do, what I aspire to be, what I think I'm engaging in, precisely because they are scared of it. I must move past their judgment. It's okay.

I want to know myself and my purpose. I will not take it lightly. I may never succeed, but I will not give up.

My goal is to become a [[eudaimonic lifehacker|Eudaimonic lifehacker]].

Okay. Enough with the serious part. This page needs to be over the top about me, me, me, right? I'm going to bask in the Authentic Millennial<<ref "4">> Hipsterian Virtue Signaling Cringelight for a moment as I walk down nostalgia lane in defining myself. Let's see if I can spew this social media timeline thing right. Shibboleet:

* a/s/l = 30ish/m/MAGAkek
* Apparently, I shared an imaginary pseudo-friend named Jerry with my brother [[JRE]]; I forgot his name. Also, Heather was an evil bitch, but remember Jabba. Hope you are doing well Jeff and Caren.
* Charmander (because you aren't stupid)->Caterpie->Metapod->Butterfree->Abra->Kadabra->~AllakaWin-the-game-with-a-single-Pokemon. Afterwards, my hand-raised full defense max-PP lvl100 Chansey vs your lottery-winning Army of Six ~MissingNo.-glitched and hacked lvl250-255 Mewtwos.
* Favorites of each D2 class: Hammerdin (with a hint of smite hybrid; dat CB), Enigma WW Kicker/Trapsin Hybrid, Javazon, Fishymancer (with a hint of PB hybrid, /yawn-till-you-win), Static-Orb Sorc somehow, my Classic duped (except the +2 Dual leech ammy we found in a Chaos run!) max STR (nobody saw it coming: IM was instant death) Lance-barb, and as usual: fuck druids
* Since this is a chronology of joy: I learned to touch my penis. What a day, what a day.
* I learned to cherish my Monsters (my computers), my first loves, my second wives, an autist's old friends. l0phtcrack, neworder, astalavista, angelfire, and altavista were just wonderful places for me. Napster, Scour Exchange, Gnutella, and Bittorrent, you opened the world for me. The Matrix is still my favorite movie, and RATM and Rachmaninoff started me on a musical journey.
* Evercrack - Uberr Gooberr: Fungi, ~CoF, TS, etc. until I saw the sheer virtue in Psykotic the Iksar Necromancer of the Tribunal Server: Pre-nerf ~CoS, Z-heart, etc. I miss Vannja Mahn to this day. TRAAAAIIIINNNNN TO ZONE (or Druid)!
* ~WoW, and Glider, my friend. Wall-of-Text's summarized Vanilla suggestion against Shadowpriests: 1.) Sap/CS into 5 points; 2.) Sap/EA/restealth/Open; 3.) Premed-CS-CB-Eviscerate; 4.) Prevent kiting/healing and respond to fears quickly. /salute, Psykotic the Gladiator and my 19 UD Priest Twink, the best flagrunner I've ever played in any game (OP turtling trollsalt of hopelessness, "QQ moar"). I miss you Zombienoir; I hope you are still alive.
* I remember Roguespot, Hypercynic, and The Source (I'll miss you Nyles) fondly. They were interesting lifetools. I lost myself in those portals and emerged as someone different. Of course, [[> oldfag|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ]] until years later Reddit became worthy. I'm lucky to live in such a fascinating world.
* Som Tam is amazing,  /salute to the origins of Tor, i2p, BTC, RSS, the Chrome Botnet, etc., Graduate School was transformative (I'll miss you [[GB]]), and LSD is a helluva drug.<<ref "2018.12.20">>
* If I were a character on Game of Thrones, i.e. if I were to identify with or as a character on ~GoT, I think I would be a mix between Tyrion "The Imp" Lannister, Samwell Tarly, Sandor "The Hound" Clegane, Lord Varys, and Maester Aemon Targaryen. Also MFK: Ygritte or Brienne of Tarth, Lady Melisandre (the only physical 10/10 human specimen I have ever seen in my entire life, and it is only during her character on ~GoT so, that says something!), and just one isn't enough, so: Septa Unella, Joffrey, and Little Finger crafted into a Humancentipede in that order.
* Don't miss my [[Television Show Collection]]. I need to write a book collection.
* I'm...like...Korean Wood V in League, and Riven is very sexy cancer (+Morgana for rule34 rito please).

Countless things, events, people, and memories in between. I look back, and part of me is happy with it. I feel so lucky to have had these opportunities.
