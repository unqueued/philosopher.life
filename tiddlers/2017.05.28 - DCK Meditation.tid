We need to write our compliments in advance. We should be training ourselves in the right way. We should have meaningful things to say to each other.

I love my wife. I'm sitting here, thinking about the 12 years we've been married together. It has been wonderful. Through thick and thin, girl. You've been there every step of the way. You held me when I needed you, and I held you when you needed me. It almost sounds dumb how obvious and simple it is, but I love that I get to trust you all the way down to the atomic level. You want the best for us. Despite the vortex around us, we lock together like brushed-steel beams crafted down to the micrometer. And, you know what, even when we disagree, I can see in your eyes that you just want us to be happy. No matter the conflict, you are committed. I won the lottery in being able to build a relationship brick by brick with you.

We need to be well-rounded. There is a giant hole in our abilities and lives. We aren't social enough. We must study human socialization, not just in our humanities, but in our sciences.  Human psychology and economics are invaluable tools to learn.<<ref "1">> But, just as importantly we need to practice it. This lacking holds us back. We shouldn't let it hold us back.

I've long had it in my head that the reason I didn't want to be wealthy was that I didn't trust wealthy people. I thought that I would be corrupted by money. I believe I have the moral tools to virtuously walk down that path as good as anyone. I can't be perfect, but I should do my best. Ultimately, I know I will fail in critical ways, but that doesn't mean I should give up. It's time to build something for ourselves.

I have long worried about socializing in similar respects. I don't want to use people in making money, but I also don't want to use people in how I socialize with them (often going hand in hand). But, I must take the risk of corruption, else I will be frozen into inaction.

I honestly believe that being able to speak well is important. Being able to write is difficult, but being able to speak on the spot very well, that is the skill that matters. I want my children to start training in public speaking, in the art of conversation, and people skills. I want it to become natural to them. I want them to be social natives. 

The fact is, we need to practice being social. We need to improve that skill. This is a muscle that we need to build up. There are different kinds of intelligence. Social intelligence must be studied and habituated. These are the skills that live on beyond technology. 

This is one of the major elements missing from their education and likely the key to unlocking their futures. They need to understand people and to be able to communicate with them. We must study humanity. We must study humans and human communications. I want that to be one of their courses, for real.

In a sense, we already do this through reading the great Human Conversation. We do this through teaching them the technical aspects of computing. Are you a good communicator? Do you understand humans well? Do you actually use it? That is the heart of their success.

In no particular order:

For my daughter, you need to study the tomes, the paradigms, the points of view. You must be voracious. You are a computer. See an ocean of data before you to compute. You can't do it all, so you need to do it wisely and cleverly. If you don't compute now, you will pay for it later. It's important to compute wisely, for each object, at each stage, in each degree, on all levels and dimensions.  

For my son, you must be fearless. This is hard for an autistic person. You and me buddy, we aren't built for this. We aren't the best social creatures in the world. There is a profound kindness in you. Direct that kindness toward yourself. Think of yourself as a profoundly complex lego or Minecraft world that you are structuring. You build it up day by day. It won't happen overnight, but over time, you will build up something great. Life just is a marshmallow test.

DO NOT FORGET

* Apology for our Family Meeting

I said I hate Christians this week. I'm sorry. My loving wife corrected me, and I didn't take the correction. She was kind, and I was not. I was wrong. I don't hate all Christians. I hate most of them, yes. There really are good Christians, just like there are good Muslims, and good Buddhists, etc. I lashed out in my claim. I am very sorry. People have different beliefs, and there are good people. Find the others.

I see us in the future. I want us to work together. I want your goals and projects to be my goals and projects, and vice versa. I want us to click. I'm not good at designing or engineering guttural social climates and interactions, but I think I can envision the rational structures between us.

I need to mentally let go of my parents to concentrate on the matters at hand. I can't resolve our incompatibilities. The injustices aren't going to be fixed. There's no way to bridge the gap. I need to accept it. We'll be like they were with their parents, in a way. I will say this though: my parents were wildly better to me than their parents were to them. That doesn't mean they've done it well or right though. I have to move past them. This is spilled milk. My initial letter last November, where I paused, it was correct. There simply wasn't an answer. I kept searching and searching, and there wasn't one. I have be okay with the fact that I'm a mortal, that I've done my best, and move on. It is time to stop being Straussian towards my parents in this respect. 

We each feel we've been as charitable as we can or are willing to given the structures around us, and that's that. I will be kind and empathic. I will give them the respect owed to strangers who happen to be so previously wildly integrated into my life. 

If you are reading this, MFW and SLT, you are free to visit us as friends. If you are in serious need, I am part of your tribe, and I will do what I can to help you. You have earned that multiple times over. Thus, my handcrafted spiral cane transforms. The intention is ultimately the same, but the hermeneutic spiral takes us to a different place than we initially intended. It is not what we set out for. It is what is it is. Let us make the best of it.

Whenever I want to stop thinking about what I'm thinking about, I try to look at something else. This might be a good behavior, and it might not be. It depends on the context. I feel like I have to train the right habit in myself here.

Again and again, I find that I use Reddit as a drug in different ways. I find it to be a way to distract myself. When I don't want to think about something, I can turn to Reddit and immediately immerse myself in something else. I can drown out what was bothering me in a sea of distractions. Baptize me! Dunk me in that bath of pleasure chemicals, baby! Sometimes it really does break the thought loops for me. I worry, however, that I exit one thought loop only to enter another set of thought loops.

I need to more wisely control this. This is what executive functioning is like. 

How many times do I distract myself with a quick ctl+t into "redd.." and push the Enter key as my omnibar that astutely guesses what drug I'm looking to take a hit on? 

I don't think I could accept a macro that ctl+w's for me on the spot. This is the real addiction test. Can I choose to leave it? I need me 'dem tubes. 

It is awkward, to say the least, giving something so addictive to my children. I feel caught between a rock and a hard place, the lesser of two evils. We can't live without these drugs; we are dependent upon them for our flourishing. But I know I'm doing something with possibly grave consequences here. It is not clear to me that one can be eudaimonic in today's society without passing through these addictive fires. I think an important skill is being able to manage our addictions, to give shape to them, to control them, to making our dependencies work for us instead of the other way around.<<ref "2">> The fact is that we can't avoid using these addictive tools. We have to! It is our pragmatic plight, in a sense. How do we make sure that we remain autonomous about them? How can we be responsible users of tools and objects which quickly make us dependent upon them? The Truth is a drug too. We must wisely sculpt our experience. We have to pull out of the world for a breath of fresh air. That is the goal of meditation. Try to be objective.

I realize I write this on DCK. I'm literally taking a drug that allows me to at least marginally dissociate enough that I feel more objective. One might easily point and say I'm being hypocritical here. I think there is more to examine here than some addiction-justification though. This is the problem with pursuing the truth and life. Finding the golden mean is never easy, especially through so many dimensions. That is to say, you aren't just finding the golden mean on a single spectrum, you are trying to find golden means on multiple spectrums. Further, you need them to be compatible with each other. You need to find the golden mean of the golden means. Oh, but then you find incompatibilities, contradictions, and impossibilities. You see the postmodern problematics. Practically-speaking, what must emerge is a metamodern mindset. We oscillate between the [[Fastmind]] and the [[Slowmind]]. We must

I must remember that, like in my videos games, life has lots of easter eggs and opportunities that I need to look out for. When the door is open, walk through it. Admittedly, I have a hard time naming missed opportunities, and that is because I delude myself in such a way that they fall through the cracks of my mind. I don't see them. I don't develop the virtuous perception for picking out the salient features of the world.

I think my son should keep a journal for the cats. I want him to watch the cats. I want him to think about what they are thinking. I want him to develop theories of their minds. I want him to train that muscle. I want him to be able to feel as they do. I want him to be able to take on, see the world through their eyes, and mirror their perspectives. I need him to practice making inferences about the cats minds. I want him to see how long-term executive reasoning and planning shapes them, impacts their lives, programs them, and results in different networks of outcomes.

The cat is an abstraction, a microcosm, a case example, an experiment, and a friend for him to bond with, understand, empathize with, and appreciate. It is a way to train our autistic minds, I believe. Have pets helps us become the best us we can be.

Today, I feel like I understand burials more. I appreciate why we do them more than I did before. I mean, I don't care about what happens with my corpse, but I want people to be able to constructively mourn and move on with their lives. I want it to be meaningful. Our deaths are like a chain of beacons through the ages. Each cluster or family remembers its forefathers, etc., and that's what makes us feel resolution. I'm not saying anything new here, but I feel I'm stumbling upon the dusty old thought in a slightly better light.

I think it is very odd that my parents never had pets of their own. We had them briefly, but only because the kids wanted them. They never actually wanted pets. Perhaps they thought it dirty. Perhaps they found it inconvenient. They didn't adore animals (not that I think it's a good thing to be excessive in this respect). Psychopathy and pets, I tell ya'h'what.

Story Time! I don't remember their names. I'll call them the Reds. They were an absurdly wealthy family. The father was a lawyer, and the mother I don't know what. They were quite powerful. They had influence in the DNC. 

---

I think my son has less of the appearance of someone who is depressed and more of someone who is ADHD. We should read about it.
