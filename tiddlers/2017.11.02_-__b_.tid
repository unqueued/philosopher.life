I think I am poison to those around me often enough. Excuse the gibberish:

I believe this wiki is hard for my wife to read. It's boring, tedious, angering, and depressing. There's nothing that makes her happy here. She is watching me wrestle-transform into someone she does not respect as much as the man she married.

I'm not sure what she thinks of my reasoning at this point. She does not engage it in some significant ways.

My thinking is such that people do not want to think about what I'm thinking. They do not want to empathize with me, and that is either because I am an asshole (and for a variety of possible reasons it isn't worth the time/energy/effort), it is very painful to realize/understand/temporarily-agree-to/empathize with my perspective (for some other set of reasons), or they are incapable of that time-slice for some other reason (for example, lacking the knowledge/inferential powers to achieve it). 

i.e.

When I don't feel they empathize, I either see people as (disliking me to the point that they don't empathize), (loving themselves [fearing pain] too much to empathize), or (not mentally capable of empathy) in a given context. 

Am I thinking about something too tedious and boring? Clearly, it's painful to be bored.

Do they want other things more important to do? They value themselves more than me.

Like is a strong word here, and love too. It must be understood carefully. I can carefully distinguish kinds of Respect here.

* [[2014.02.17 - Bare Metal Recognition and Appraisal Respect]]<<ref "1">>

We are in Like and Love territory. They are simply two kinds of respect. 

I imagine the same standard applies to me as well. When I'm not empathizing, it's because I don't think it's worth it (I don't like them as much as I like myself [includes that I don't like them]; this is a cost/benefit analysis[it gets even uglier when we think of it like this]) or because I'm not even capable. 

They say ought implies can. Whenever you think I ought to empathize, then I must be capable. Are you sure?

What is left sucks. 

Thus, do I impart the same charity? Is it better to just see that one can't make the leap? Is that how I ought to treat humanity?<<ref "2">>

It does feel like we are stuck between malice and ignorance.<<ref "3">>

Autistic people are trying to unify themselves like schizoids and MPD/DID in that they all experience a kind of dissociative experience (which isn't necessarily a disorder) in which there are two realities presented, and they must pick one. I think of the Redpill as doing exactly that in a sense. It is a kind of fundamental disagreement with yourself about what is real. You are stuck between two worlds. Sometimes you are phenomenologically immersed in one world to the loss of the other, etc. Sometimes it is a true incapacity. Maybe it means there is only a range of possible worlds that you can even conceive of (or conceive of given the fastmind or slowmind).

<<footnotes "1" "Fallacy time: I really loved this paper. And you know what? So did others in my class (they asked to see it). I made jaws drop more than once at that school, and this was one of them. My teacher loved it too, and we rarely agreed on a large amount of Kantian-space. Here's how good this paper is: my teacher is going to teach his class differently because he read this paper. He said it was literally the best class he had ever taught in his life; and I think a tiny part of the reason is my paper. He even told me it was the best paper in the class. This is part of my metaethics.">>
