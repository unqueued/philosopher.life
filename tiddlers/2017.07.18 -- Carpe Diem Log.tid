title: 2017.07.18 -- Carpe Diem Log

* I woke up earlier than the alarm, again. I really tried to sleep, but I couldn't. I used the extra time wisely though:
** Bricks pushed!
* I worked my ass off. 
** I'm perturbed by how I'm treated (to say it lightly).
** My sunburns are getting worse.
* I came home, showered extensively.
* I talked to my family over vidchat.
** It is wonderful to hear from them.
** I had a serious talk with my daughter. She is fucking up so hard, and she's lying. I'm at my wits end with her.
* I'm eating my fruits. I don't want to waste them. I need to make sure I fill myself up with them. I'm glad I like them.
** I could really go for some carbs. I didn't pack any besides PB crackers. Um. Oops?
* New roommates, they seem chill enough. Armstrong is somewhat picky, I can see.
* The interwebs is working decently enough.
* Will likely watch some GoT, surf, finish installing League, watch Mr. Robot, and if I'm lucky, some Fireman Time!
