title: Insect Farming

 Insects are unserused resources around the world. We think them beneath us to the point that we are only interested in what we can learn about and from them for ourselves, but we don't actually use them as a resource as much as we could. Insect farming is an interesting ethical job possibility.

* It's a business I/we could own. 
* It doesn't require huge amounts of startup capital. 
* It would require enormous amounts of research, and you would want to be scientific through and through on it.
** Competitive advantages are required.
** My wife could be a bee scientist if she put a few years into it. Seriously. And, I think she could do it for any insect or activity. She can master any body of literature. She could research this like the absurdly literate librarian she is and generate our competitive advantage.
*** And, I am smart enough to learn that research as well, but I need her direction. Give me something very specific to learn, and I can learn it. Which specific thing should I learn? She can tell me. I can connect any set of dots, except the long-range ones. 
* Oddly enough, future-proofed against and even evolutionarily fit in the business cycle of the decline of society, and perhaps eventually, our next and final dark ages, i.e. apocolypse (whether quickly or slowly brought about)
* It's a job we would all enjoy:
** 1uxb0x: survival skills, farming, and build things - fits this perfectly
** j3d1h: scientific, strong creative design, webdesign, admin, capable of learning it all, likes insects (sees them as interesting creatures), could do the culinary aspect.
** k0sh3k: Beekeeper, Bees, encyclopedic knowledge and research talent, Spiders, and would love to either not have to work or work on something interesting, philanthropy, working together
** h0p3: be my own boss (or being family with the bosses), working with my family, make it super interesting and challenging, not have it destroy my body, have it be moral, and I can make a good living at it? Fuck me. Sign me up.

It has an several natural innate competitive advantage to alternative ideas:

* Green As Fuck
* Low-Hanging Fruit (or Insect) Novel Possibilities
* Seems Cheap
* Porta-Potty Cleaner + Morbid Funeral Home thing going on, a premium

Competitive Advantage Ideas:

* Entomophagy
** The eating of insects, is an interesting ethical consideration. It may continue to trend up.
* Food for Pets
* Clean insects for science
* Industrial Applications
** Spider Silk
* Luxury
** Spider Silk
* Robots in Insect Farming
