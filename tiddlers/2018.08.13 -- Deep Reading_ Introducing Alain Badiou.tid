title: 2018.08.13 -- Deep Reading: Introducing Alain Badiou

Earth, Fire, Wind, Water! These are the four elements from which real truth emits...See, there appears to be that kind of "bullshitting" in framework. It's kind of fails the sniff test. Look, there is something here worth our time, but I think I have to contend with the fact that I'm sifting shit for [[Diamonds]] and [[Redpills]]. This is par for the course in reading real philosophy though. I just shouldn't get my hopes up too fast.

I do appreciate the commentary of safety-first love. I wonder want Badiou would think of this wiki. All of the audience-oriented [[Root]]ed directories are building safety. But, otherwise, the transparency and bridge-building, imho, is pretty novel.
