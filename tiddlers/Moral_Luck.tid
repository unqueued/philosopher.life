title: Moral Luck

//I deny paradoxical instances of the standard Williamsian/Nagelian concept of moral luck obtain. Since I'm not a skeptic, I wield a heterodox definition of this term. Traditionally, this concept is wielded by the skeptic, though we need not throw the baby out with the bathwater to answer it (as they would have us believe). A [[Straussian]] interpretation of [[Saint Kant]] must be willing to wrestle at the edges to defend autonomy, culpability, and moral evaluation. The world governs us to some degree (that's what I think moral luck really points toward), and we govern ourselves and the world to some degree.//

Moral agency is directly immune to luck,<<ref "im">> even if the lives of moral agents are not to various [[dok]]. From an agent's perspective(s), luck is the world and components of one's identity which are not in their autonomous control to some [[dok]] in a given timeslice. Whatever isn't the essence of one's metaphysical freedom is a matter of luck for that person, including deterministic and random aspects of the world (and self). Moral luck highlights the difficulties in evaluating the limits and conditions of autonomy and hence the moral responsibility of an agent in vague, probabilistic, or complex contexts.<<ref "t">> To the extent luck occurs, objects can be morally assessed for [[good]]ness qua [[beauty]] but not [[right]]ness.

Insofar as the standard interpretation of moral luck would be wielded as an oxymoron by language users,<<ref "n">> in which an evaluator claims an agent should (supposedly be) justifiably be held responsible for what isn't up to the agent, moral luck refers to epistemic errors of both the language user and the evaluator. The standard conception of moral luck is incoherent, even if it points to areas which require our attention. Furthermore, everyday intuitions, practices, and judgments which violate the //ought implies can// logical truth are wrong.<<ref "h">> Sound moral judgment requires teasing apart what is up to an agent, including the inertial forces and barriers to autonomy. 

* An instance of freewill is not a fully determined product of antecedent circumstances.
* Voluntariness appears to come in degrees at some level, and we have to [[stoic]]ally hunt for what is within our [[power]]. 
* Insofar as an agent has the ability to override (including a choice of whether or not to habituate) their desire or character, they are morally responsible.
* The odds and costs to overcome one's conditioning or circumstances (including our ability to predict the outcomes of our acts) must be weighed into the evaluation. Likewise, we aren't responsible for our natural virtues.
* Insofar as one cannot formulate or compute maxims, one cannot be responsible. 
* Moral merit and fault are independent of consequence.
* Moral records are incomplete. A complete assessment of an agent's character requires evaluating the possibilities (and probabilities) of an agent's disposition in all circumstances.<<ref "ff">>

Moral luck actually demonstrates that some [[dok]] of ought implies some [[dok]] of can. We must acknowledge the large role played by luck in our lives, including the edges picked out by cases that are deemed to be standard moral luck. Crucially, moral luck must remind us of what it means to enter behind the [[VOI]] with humility, to pursue justice as blindly as possible.

<<footnotes "im" "Which isn't to say the conditions for moral agency, the conditions in which an agent finds themselves, or the consequences of choice can't be a matter of luck. What is not absolutely up to us is not absolute agency.">>

<<footnotes "t" "Everyday intuitions are often wrong, failing to be rational about //The Control Principle//. Moral luck, on my account, is a field of mistaken moral judgments and practices. Insofar as an agent is relegated to being an observer rather than an active participant shaping some part of themselves or the world, they aren't morally culpable, even if many homo sapiens may treat or evaluate them otherwise.">>

<<footnotes "n" "Just because 'an agent can be //correctly// treated as an object of moral judgment' doesn't mean they should be treated unqualified or completely as one, as one might treat an agent all else being equal. Note that insofar as luck can be shaped, partially predicted, or controlled for to any degree, it isn't actually luck.">>

<<footnotes "h" "Therefore, a great number of moral philosophers are gravely mistaken.">>
