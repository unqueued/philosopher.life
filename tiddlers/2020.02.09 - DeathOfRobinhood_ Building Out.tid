title: 2020.02.09 - DeathOfRobinhood: Building Out

Hey [[DeathOfRobinhood]],

<<<
The only way I'll ever get around to responding to anything in the [[CCB|2019.06.25 - DeathOfRobinhood: The Chickenscratch Confession Booktour]] is to accept that I can't top it, that I won't be able to address everything in it worth addressing, and to remember you're a safe person to look stupid and cringey before.
<<<

I'd like to think we are building it together. We bring different pieces of the puzzle to the table. Where we can't build up, we'll build out. I am hoping that over time we will at least accidentally or indirectly address everything worth addressing in it. I'm grateful that you pick out what is most [[salient]] about it with me. 

I aim to be a safe person. I argue you already do the same for me too, btw. There's plenty of my stupidity and cringe in this wiki and that letter. My brother, [[JRE]], has said of [[Sphygmus]] that she sometimes covers my [[naked]]ness. Maybe that is what you do for me too.

<<<
''DOR: God is not better understood through an excessive expenditure of words.''

h0p3: A ballsy claim you haven't even tried to justify. Anything and everything can be true to the person who won't think through their claims, and it is wrong, morally, for you to flatten the living landscape the best of us have been mining for years down to a convenient black-and-white polaroid you can keep in your pocket. 

DOR: Heartless philosopher! You who would bar children from the beach til they've counted every grain of sand! What proof could I give that would satisfy you?!
<<<

Oh, I appreciate this style of reduction. It too is a Polaroid (which is often the best or only method available to us), and it reminds me of [[Saint Plato]]. You definitely see what I'm doing here.

<<<
...is more or less where I end up when I try to defend my earlier claim. 

How did I justify writing that, at least emotionally?
<<<

The tricky part for me is that casuistry, intuition, sentiment, [[phenomenology]], and sensibility must play a justificatory role, a fundamental one at that, but balancing it with cognition and public reason is a hard problem in epistemology (which is a subset of moral philosophy when you look closely). Part of what consists in knowledge and justification (material for, but not the locus of) is trapped in emotion (given minds like ours).

Plenty of my argument is emotional too. I do not have a satisfactory account here.

<<<
Lot's of words have been said, and written, by people whose lives don't bear out the tenor of love that ought to characterize someone who knows, or is known, by God.
<<<

To make matters worse, even when the author isn't a [[good]] person, or even when they didn't intend for the words to be interpreted in a particular manner, the meaning can still be right in some cases. 

Heidegger was literally a Nazi. It blows my mind.

I should add that while [[Virtue is Knowledge]], it is possible to know parts of what is [[salient]] while still remaining largely morally unvirtuous. I think it's one of the reasons why it's still so valuable to listen to one's opposition, even in a vacuum.

<<<
I reasoned, badly, that having a lot of words (that is, thoughts, even if they're bad thoughts) about Thing is either causative, or indicative of, not knowing salient aspects of Thing, then reasoning, again badly, that the salient aspects of Thing can't be thought of or examined coherently (with words).
<<<

I turned it up to 11 on that part of the argument; I purposely pushed it over edge into a strawman. Part of my task now will be to argue that non-cognitivism has several key strengths (hinted in the letter, but not explicated), even if it is incomplete and dependent upon codification to some degree. I do not know how to do this well. 

Justified inarticulacy is a deep concern of mine, and it is a place of profound paranoia for me. I do not aim to destroy The Nameless by naming it or talking about it; I often see cognition and affectation as two separate agents that must express their alien selves to each [[other]] wisely. Sometimes, it will be best that I listen in silence to you; I need to build both sides of the virtue-theoretic golden spectrum bridge with you.

This is an anecdote, not a full argument, and it's missing something. I think you can appreciate it though. We've talked some about my son, Selah's<<ref "s">> brother, and The Blessed your beloved sacrificially serves. One of the most important parts about raising my son, particularly in his early life, is seeing that he understands even when he has no words to talk about it, no signs to hand me to demonstrate he understands it (beyond acting upon that knowledge directly), and no metacognition of the process. 

<<<
Maybe I should have said something like "A person can be said to understand God, in some measure that is valuable, without having exercised themselves to reasoning extensively about God; but if God can indeed be knowable to us via our reason and our senses, then there's no reason why we might not be able to substantiate this knowledge, technically, and precisely, to another person."

Is that workable starting point? I get there's a lot there assumed/left undefined...
<<<

That is a very precise expression. I think it is largely correct, and it's a fine starting point. 

I will push back in your favor. There is a place, aspect, or property in or of our consciousness, qualia, that cannot be codified by definition by the [[fff]]. There is a subjective perspective that can only ever be known via immediate lived experience (I suggest even our own memory of our [[phenomenology]] fails here). 

In philosophy of religion, it is thought that even an omnipotent and omniscient God cannot know what it is to be like you all the way down; I do not know. If qualia can be computed by [[The Infinite]], then your argument above is correct (adding that we have infinite computation resources available to us). My goal was to push at the codification limit, to juice your intuitions in the other direction. 

<<<
btw, I really enjoyed that last call.
<<<

Me too! And, you should feel free to call me up. You give me a lot of space, and you don't have to.

<<<
I feel like towards the end I was gaslighting you kind of when the conversation started becoming about you having too high expectations of others. I actually think you're highly aware of people, their needs, and their limits, and I'm sorry I made you doubt your ability to perceive others. 
<<<

Gaslighting, XD. That's a hilarious claim. Don't feel that way, please. Thank you for the reassurance. I think it's a good thing to doubt and [[Question Everything]], especially when we're with people that we're safe with. That's part of doing philosophy. I consider it an excellent use of our leisure time.

I must temper your compliment though. I've been told I'm smart often enough, and when I turn out to be retarded in many cases (and, I am!), it can be so unpredicted that it is frustrating for people (it is frustrating for me too, lol). There is a significant variance in my ability to understand. In time, I think you'll be surprised by how I might be able to make inferences of a certain difficulty level over here but fail so spectacularly to even see what children can see over there. I think you'll be able to laugh it off with me just fine.

<<<
btow, did you get a chance to watch Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs? :)
<<<

Yes, [[I did|Film: Exploration]]. I have seen it with my offspring before. I forgot all about it. I have no idea how I'd forget given a title like that, lol.
