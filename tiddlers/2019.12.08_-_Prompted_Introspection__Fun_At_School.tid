title: 2019.12.08 - Prompted Introspection: Fun At School

!! What has been the most fun activity at school so far?

By far dialectures that sprawl and rabbithole. I'm glad when I didn't start it, and rather when they've got questions or something to wrestle with. High jokes per minute, everyone racing for that YT vidya which pertains to something way too specific, when they happily remind me where we were in the conversation (backing up the train), where we're striving for stories that make progress, in which we oscillate between dire existential problems and the most silly mundane nothings, when we want nothing more than to spend another hour just doing exactly what we are doing. Most aren't perfectly fun, but they are often great.
