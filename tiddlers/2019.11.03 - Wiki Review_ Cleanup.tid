title: 2019.11.03 - Wiki Review: Cleanup

* [[2019.11.02 - JRE: Hushmoney]]
** It's been a disappointing [[redpill]] for both of us.
* [[2019.11.02 - Wiki Review: Todotoday]]
** Completed. Not smart to do this with an audit in some respects. New Year is going to be killer.
* [[2019.11.02 - TDL: Family Time!]]
** Yeah, I know. I'm still doing it. =/
* [[2019.11.02 - Prompted Introspection: Clothes Make The Person]]
** XD. I want moar of this.
* [[2019.11.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Catchup]]
** I don't remember, so I'm leaving it. Fuck.
* [[2019.11.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Fascism]]
** Well, not in the classic sense of the term.
* [[2019.09.30 - Sphygmus: Hardlinking]]
** I think we will always have this discussion, lol. It's an important problem.
* [[2019.10.18 - Sphygmus: Forming Function]]
** Also, Chinese Room.
* [[2019.10.25 - Sphygmus: Progressness]]
** My own substitution method still fails, sadly.
* [[2019.10.27 - Sphygmus: RSS Feed]]
** Yeah, the home page isn't so useful for a regular.
* [[2019.10.28 - Sphygmus: Rooting For Us]]
** She may have been the only person who read it off the wiki and said something about it too.
* [[2019.10.30 - Sphygmus: Thinking About Wikis]]
** It's been interesting seeing her walk through other wikis. Like uses [[gems]] to look through and think about other gems.
* [[2019.10.31 - Sphygmus: Timeline]]
** Hard to replicate that beautifully in TW itself too.
* [[Encrypted: GB]]
** Completely unrelated, but I've seen lots of programmatic, mathematical, and crypto games which this kind of tiddler could fit.
* [[2019.09.30 - chameleon: I Like Talking With You]]
** I found this one surprising. It may be a matter of politeness, which I can appreciate.
* [[2019.10.07 - chameleon: Nitro]]
** I wish I weren't out of my league. I'm slow AF.
* [[2019.10.08 - chameleon: Self-Mastery]]
** Quite a bit to think about in that quote for us. 
* [[2019.10.21 - chameleon: Wedding!]]
** Brings me back to my first year of marriage. 
* [[2019.10.31 - chameleon: Diogenes Greentext]]
** Perfect. My daughter decided to turn it green. Looks good.
* [[2019.09.18 - GB: Need Help + Mindmeld]]
** [[REDACTED]] substitutions required some thought. I tried to maintain an explanation of the depth without saying much.
** I've always seen him as a Humean sentimentalist though.
** Hegel's a beast. It has been no small shift for him, a hardcore Nietzschean, to take up moral realism, robust metaphysics, and a semblance of [[The End]]. He did listen there. Will he eventually see the other half? He may. Give it another decade. He's a man of profound reason.
*** He doesn't like that I call it [[faith]]. I appreciate that so much. I will not be a fun man to argue with on that book.
* [[2019.09.17 - GB: Reconnecting]]
** Glad to see him reconnect. I hope to be of use to the man.
