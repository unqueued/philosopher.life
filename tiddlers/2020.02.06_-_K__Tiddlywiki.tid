[9:45 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Hope today is good for you [[h0p3]]. `^^`
[11:38 AM]  h0p3: Well, thank you. :slight_smile:
[11:38 AM]  h0p3: I hope the same for you.
[11:38 AM]  h0p3: How's it going so far? And, what will you be up to tonight?
[11:39 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Not bad. I’ve been in a bad brain funk for a few days now but I think i’m coming out of it.
[11:39 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Usually we raid but we’re taking a night for ourselves instead. :slight_smile:
[11:39 AM]  h0p3: Awesome.
[11:39 AM]  h0p3: Love it. I hope it will be a night to remember.
[11:43 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: What are you up to today?
[11:44 AM]  h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#2020.02.05%20-%20TDL%3A%20Brownies
[11:46 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: That comment about people not really living in their homes reminds me of our talk at the cabin about work culture keeping people tired and disjointed from forming real relationships.
[11:46 AM]  h0p3: Yes.
[11:46 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: It’s super sweet that you guys wanna connect with brownies.
[11:46 AM]  h0p3: I think that is at the heart of the matter.
[11:47 AM]  h0p3: Yeah, if I get to make one real neighbor out of it, I'd be pleased.
[11:47 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Also communicating via voice in the same house is amusing to me. Like it makes sense, but is still strange. I think we share apprehension there.
[11:48 AM]  h0p3: Yeah. That is such a weird feeling to me. Why not just be in the same room? (and, I adore being in the same room, all else being equal)
[11:49 AM]  h0p3: Still, I have to raise adults who can connect fully even remotely with others, including, hopefully, their family, lol.
[11:49 AM]  h0p3: In the end, I'd prefer to "do my work" at my desk were I in their shoes too.
[11:50 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: There is certainly a compromise somewhere here. Being able to flip from desktop to laptop if needed is essential to make it work properly.
[11:50 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Random albeit somewhat related:
[11:51 AM]  h0p3: They already do their work on the laptop. Desktops for play (one day, I hope they'll switch it up like me, lol).
[11:51 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: [[L]] said something about setting her desktop up as a server so we can both use TW and have a place to always access them. It’s one of our resolutions for this year I think. I like the idea of it so I can still connect from school
[11:52 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I wanna use my PC for more gaming outside of FFXIV
[11:52 AM]  h0p3: I hear that. PCmasterrace ftw.
[11:53 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m playing a VN on my desktop right now. It’s interesting.
[11:55 AM]  h0p3: And, yes, the desktop can act as a server. Making sure it works from your iPhone may be trickier.
[11:55 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’ve given up on ny sheep phone interacting with things haha
[11:55 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: But my laptop— definitely easy
[11:57 AM]  h0p3: There are a couple ways to do serving.
[11:57 AM]  h0p3: One way is to have two (or more) servers, and just sync the tiddler between them. That's what I prefer to do after quite a bit of practice.
[11:58 AM]  h0p3: I still have it set up to be a server from [[monster-16]] though. This makes it so anyone in the house can modify my wiki (useful during [[Family Time]] and tech support from my daughter).
[11:59 AM]  h0p3: For now, I would just get a wiki up and running on your laptop though.
[12:00 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: That’s super cool. I’m hoping [[L]] and I can get a full unbooked weekend soon to experiment with it all.
[12:00 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Ye, that’s a good place to begin
[12:00 PM]  h0p3: You can have it running in a couple minutes. The method I used for more than a year was the single-file method. No server.
[12:00 PM]  h0p3: You should start with that.
[12:01 PM]  h0p3: Firefox + https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/file-backups/ + an empty wiki from https://tiddlywiki.com/
[12:02 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I can’t escape Firefox can I? :joy::joy:
[12:02 PM]  h0p3: Plenty of people use Chrome/Chromium for this. In fact, I use a custom Chromium just for my wiki.
[12:02 PM]  h0p3: I'm trying to hand you the absolutely easiest way to begin.
[12:02 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I should just give it an honest shot haha
[12:06 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Big brain: I’ll use Internet Explorer
[12:07 PM]  h0p3: IE can be used. The issue is how you are going to automatically "save" the wiki. You'll find it is tedious to modify, manually save, and manually reload.
[12:08 PM]  h0p3: https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyDesktop/releases
GitHub
Jermolene/TiddlyDesktop
A custom desktop browser for TiddlyWiki 5 and TiddlyWiki Classic, based on nw.js - Jermolene/TiddlyDesktop

[12:08 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Oh I was just joking.
[12:08 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’ll go the FF route
[12:09 PM]  h0p3: That TiddlyDesktop tool is a custom browser from TW's creator. It's also another route instead of fiddling. The nice part is that if you don't like one method, you can try another. It's very hackable.
[12:10 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: That’s awesome! Thanks for the help
[12:11 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: That also reminds me, i need to make that digital cookbook too... i should write that down
[12:11 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I guess I just did. :joy:
