title: 2018.06.10 - Deep Reading Log: A.I. Apocalypse

I always enjoy a good AI personhood question. =)

It's fun to see them geek out.

I'm enjoying hearing the new AI's perspective on cooperating with humans. It's too anthropomorphized, but that's okay. Cool enough.

It's weird to see two computational gods in the world.

Obviously, I would not want to be fighting against these AI's for numerous reasons.

I'm always reminded of "lightspeed" wars in space. This is very much like that.

Ultimately, we can never have an accurate theory of AI's mind. We can't do it for small shit; this magnitude is obvious. I think we're pretty helpless. 

Feels super Eureka-esque. I must say it: Asimov saw very far.

The Windows sec through obsc is retarded for a billion reason, esp since it really isn't that obscure. More importantly, both AIs can clearly attack literally anything except each other.

AI vs AI fights are cool as fuck. I don't care if it's realistic or not. It's at least mildly believable. I think there may be more obvious attack vectors against each other.

I really don't understand what the sisters aren't fighting back against their own kind.

... What kind of fucked up ex machina human intervention is this? This is retarded. ELOPe would obviously have backups beyond backups.

Author can't end a book to save his life. Neil Stephenson syndrome.
