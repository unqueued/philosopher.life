title: The Remodeling

//Snapshots morally allow you to streamline a tightknit object. Do so!//

A checklist (?):

# What [[Tags]] should this have?
# What should link to this? What threads does it belong to?
# Is this grammatically correct? Does it convey the intention?
# How does this relate to [[Root]]?
# Is this still in use? If not, is it worth vaulting or is it just noise?

Some technical {[[dreams]]}:

* Metadata has to actually DO things; if you don't know the structure you are building, then what the fuck is your algorithm?
* Automatically attach metadata. 
* Automatically generate output from this automatically generated input.
* Bob-based Infrastructure

This wiki is my epic character bible. It's time to starting laying my tentpegs more effectively.

* [[Wiki Mechanic]]
* {[[Principles]]}
* [[The Story of h0p3]]

The gist:

* Chunk content into the smallest meaningful atoms.
* Assign sufficient metadata to fragments in order to weave new structures.
* Hedged-conservatively automate new structures without losing your Human construction.
