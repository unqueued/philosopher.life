!! Audit:

* My writing is incredibly aggressive at times. I'm angry very often when I write these.
* My non-answers, at this point, are my standard approach. If I don't like the question, then I just pick it apart. It started day 1, like that.
* I clearly am still struggling with more complex variants of all the same problems. I've solved damn near nothing. I just know more of what counts as the problem.
* I don't take my own prescriptions. Ugh. That sucks.
* I have truly skilled arguments in my writing. Few could pump them out like this.
* God damn, I have some excellent arguments. I can look back at what I said half a year ago and there aren't many darlings of mine to kill off. In fact, I forgot some of these answers and am agreeing with someone else as I read.
* I am pleased with my ability to wield positive nihilism.
* I feel like I'm preaching to myself, and I'm glad I can hear it. I need it.
* I anticipate a great deal in my work.
* I think this would be most unsatisfying to others. =/ Not much I can do there.
* I constantly struggle with the ideal and practical. I'm wrestling here.
* I tackle psychopathy a lot.
* I am a razor. Holy fuck. I'm slashing through everything.
* Getting weird with it too, lol. Love the honesty!
* I enjoy making myself laugh.
* I should start favoring taxing behavior I think is immoral more directly. I do for the obvious things, but perhaps that can be expanded beyond the usual.
* I like having pictures, but I prefer to keep this textual.
* I quickly started giving briefer answers. That's fine.
* I often feel alienated.
* I'm often unable to give a satisfactory answer. I try to satisfactorily explain why I can't give one, and even that is often not good enough in my eyes. Sometimes I feel like a real failure as I write these.
* I have not changed my mind on many of these, but I also feel like I've made little progress. Perhaps my dispositions is fairly crystallized.
* I have drugs on the brain.
* Lots of smack talk in here.
* I'm glad I put a name to my adversary, my nemesis: Samwise Gamgee.
* I must practice forgiveness and listen to myself more than I have.
* I love my post, and I don't like my initial audits. They are far too brief.
* My writing has deteriorated.
* Why did I stop giving quotes? I adore when I give a fitting quote for the question. It's usually spot on or funny.
* When I'm barely keeping my head above water from work, it is clear this log suffers.
* I am disappointed in much of my later work.
* My work is emotional and less rational August through October
* Ah, I see a giant shift: when I started using ready-made prompts, my writing significantly improved. 
* Ha, I now have answered two sets of questions twice.
* The move to title.Titles gives them a mark. It was a good move.
* My introspection is bleak. I am trying to have hope despite obviously lacking it in many areas.
* I need to find better ways to answer "wish" questions.
* I'd like to ratchet my negativity down a notch. I need more light in my writing.
* I'm pleased to have footnotes. They make me giggle.
* I prefer when I give philosophical answers while still pouring myself onto the pages of this existential mirror.
* Overall, I did some important lifting here. There's a lot of content to think about. It may come in handy one day.
