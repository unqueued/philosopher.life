title: 2019.05.08 - Afterschool Teaching: Chilled

Whitney is in all black today. She has cried so much she can't cry anymore. She's leaving early to have prepare a basket for her sister.

I did all the prep for her. Trying to make it easy on her however I can.

I finished my eval and turned it in. I think self-evals are dumb, but I can't say that on the form. Delp says he'll be in next week to watch me. Cool story.

Mitchell took a handful of 5th graders who had homework. I took most everyone to the lab. I'm having to call many individuals down to discuss behavior. I like that they are a bit rowdy, but they get so into it that they are losing their tempers. 

Whitney asked me to hunt down 8Hf and 8RR who lied about what they were doing to screw around. We talked, they revealed they had homework, and I sent them to it. Everyone lies. Mitchell says he has given up on multiple boys for this now. There's nothing I can do about it.

6CM and 7Jm are required to be separated by Delp and Mitchell. She complained enough to me and asked to make her case before them. I told her how to come correct to them and to come straight back to me regardless of the outcome. That's not what I'm supposed to do according to the hierarchy, but I think she has the right to make her case here. It didn't go in her favor, of course, since this is now a matter of authority and status to them. I have mixed feelings on the separation, as it could be good for them both (when they have homework, I do keep them separate). 6CM and I wrestled quite a bit.

I preached to my geeks the gospel of reading, studying for college entrance exams, and learning how to use their computers. They did not want to hear it. Sorry kiddos. We talked about the differences between what they get and what wealthy kids get, and I tried to explain (without using the word) what their prison was like, how it could be different, and what they should do to combat it (especially in how to construct themselves in their freetime in and out of school).

This is one of the aspects of my children I'm lucky to have: they listen (though I can't say they follow, lol). In fact, we can talk about what others find mundane, too difficult to understand, or even insane for hours at a time. If I can get them to read like the wind (to tackle books like they do lectures), we'll be in good shape. If I can get them to write, we'll be in great shape.

Whitney left early (good!).

Delp thanked me for being dependable after I failed to continue to build [[smalltalk]] with him as I did my paperwork. I'm trying to connect more with the parents, but I do so quite poorly.

I sat with my students. 9Tm and I talked about his grades (B's), welding classes, his neighbor, school, certifications, etc. He can make a bead. Perhaps he wanted the conversation to end, but he trucked through it like a trooper.

Computing and information systems are the only trade (and I'm merely an amateur, I know) I can teach them with what I've got. Making resources with your mind, however, is hard to beat. AI specialty may continue to be the way to go here. I can actually get them into formal verification though, while I know almost nothing about the math for AI. I don't know. I'm simply not qualified or experienced enough to be wise here.
