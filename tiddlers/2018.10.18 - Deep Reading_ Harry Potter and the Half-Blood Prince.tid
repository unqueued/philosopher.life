title: 2018.10.18 - Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The explanation of the relationship with and epistemology of the muggles makes no fucking sense. I think magic would be used for far more than is presented here. I think it would create an instant elite class, and wizards would be far more likely to confabulate to their "right" to enslave others than is presented in the book. But, of course, Rowling and I disagree on her depiction of the human species in general.

Snape's Redemption! I am so ready. 

Okay, I really want to criticize this double-agent bullshit. But, I'm not in a position to deny the possibility of this plan for a long time. Perhaps I am just incompetent here.

The oath that Snape takes up seems completely forced. I do not like that.

Magical ownership is magical.
