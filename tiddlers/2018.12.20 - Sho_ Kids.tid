I don't have the chance to teach them like I do my children, but I hope to triage for them.
THU 3:41 PM
Explain last phrase, please?
THU 6:32 PM
Ah, I mean I think these children are caught in the crisis of capitalism (and anti-intellectualism); I can't solve the problem in full for them because I'm only one man. I have to pick and choose my battles to get the most bang for my buck. I don't exactly know the best way to help them, but I'm listening and looking for the answers I can.
THU 6:33 PM
Wow, lucky kids :) good luck!
THU 6:36 PM
