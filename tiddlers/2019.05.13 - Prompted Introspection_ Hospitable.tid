title: 2019.05.13 - Prompted Introspection: Hospitable

!! Has anyone ever influenced your manners for the better? Who?

It is good to see you again, [[Saint Diogenesocrates]]. It has been too long. Please, come in, come in. Your feet are dirty from your travels; please allow me to wash them. Here is some water, unless you would prefer wine; I'm afraid to say it is all we have. Are you hungry? We shall feast on the fatted calf tonight in your honor. Oh, where are my manners? Please, sit down, I'm sure you must be tired.

As always, your question is obviously a crucial one. I could only [[hope]] to give it a reasonable response.

All else being equal, hospitality, particularly to those who can never return the favor, is kindness. Insofar as those manners come at the expense of opportunity costs of higher moral worth (which is why I'm never impressed by the manners of a wealthy person; if they had real hospitality, they wouldn't be wealthy), however, I cannot say it is a complete kindness (toward whom?). As a guest, gratefulness and attempting the "when in Rome" dance is crucial. Peers should aim for [[T42T]] trading. Manners of all parties [[irwartfrr]] generate a sublationary sphere of justice between two or more contexts which bend over backward to recognize the value of fundamental difference and the limits imposed by our conceptually and empirically necessary ignorance.

As an autist, I often run into social conventions which I find pointless or even morally repugnant. I tend to find a large number of manners are shibboleths designed to weed out those who lack the conditioning of a given social rank. [[The Gentleman]] has manners, but that doesn't make him kind. Politicians are rhetoricians with the social graces necessary for climbing ladders of power, but that doesn't make them moral. Manners as a mere affect-greasing tool is manipulative. Social convention concerned with respecting unjustified authority or social status ("respect the office") are disgusting to me (though you bet your ass I play by the rules when speaking with a pig). But, of course, there are many kinds of behaviors which are conventional which I find extremely justified.

Appearances are often deceiving, but the motivation to come correct [[irwartfrr]] is something I value. I am, ofc, reminded of The Robustness Principle. 

Presumably, the question is about someone I've known. I think the most moving influences in my life are a result of people walking the extra mile for me when I didn't even know it at the time (even though I should have). Recognizing my lack of fitting humility and gratefulness is horrifying. I am guilty. Even to the extent I'm not, I'm often a fucking animal even when I'm trying to be a proper human. The recognition of unrecognized hospitality given to me is a humbling experience. Further, there are people who have exacted just the right amount of flesh from me in dialectics to help me see the hole, Slip, or infection without destroying me. Hospitality comes in many flavors.
