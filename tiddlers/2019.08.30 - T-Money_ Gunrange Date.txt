You are correct. Lots more opportunity to move up and learn a skill that is more deseriable among the manufacturing world. And maybe eventually get out of aviation.

Two managers out of ppc (production planning and control) interviewed me. I applied for all open planning positions. However apparently there are two sides to ppc. I interviewed for a second shift position. But i think the other manager (who was helping with the interview) is calling me  in for a day shift on her side. More computer based.
AUG 30 7:57 PM
I have experience with a software that they moving to use. And it is a deseriable skill.
AUG 30 7:58 PM

Wife and I went to Kroger about 4pm today. Wow.
AUG 30 9:05 PM
Random guy walks up and asks us "do you know where the bread is?" ( I know he is a tourist and we are at the entrance and very foot traffic busy Co gested area) so I pointed to the back of Kroger and said "over there' ( basically saying move along but also giving wrong directions.)
AUG 30 9:07 PM
Wife popped in and had to tell him where the bread was.
AUG 30 9:07 PM
I was pissed.
AUG 30 9:07 PM
Lmbo
AUG 30 9:07 PM

AUG 30 9:11 PM
I'm glad she did.
AUG 30 9:11 PM
There are people. Who work there and lots of other locations to have asked that question with hundreds of people in the store. Don't ask at the most congested part of the store. He was 10 feet from the customer service counter.
AUG 30 9:12 PM

AUG 30 9:13 PM
