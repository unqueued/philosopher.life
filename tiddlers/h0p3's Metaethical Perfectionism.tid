!! About:

//If I am to be magnanimous, then I must show why I'm justified, especially to myself.//

I'm not a 'path of least resistance' kind of guy.

Sometimes I feel like a one-manned cult leader unto myself. Some people think I'm "drinking the koolaid," others think I'm "close-minded," and others think I'm just literally insane or immoral. Yet, I find there are certain aspects of my beliefs about the world that I maintain a "coherently-justified" (leveraging the relative strength of my axioms against each other, but also using their coherence with the rest of my beliefs to predict their value) faith (faith lacks foundational justification, but it doesn't have to lack coherentist foundation, which ultimately is always in reflective-equilibriumist pursuit of increasingly rational standards of ourselves on externalist accounts. What makes something internally rationally, ultimately rests upon an external standard foundation, [[The Good]] of Epistemology.).

This is one of the fundamental sources of disagreement, conflict, and hatred in my life. I believe I have a right to be more confident (and sometimes even certain) in the virtue-theoretic [[agi]] concerns of the essence of personhood (and thus, to some [[dok]] humanity) than most people, even many incredibly intelligent people I've met. I legitimately think I'm less wrong on the matter. Yes, I sound arrogant. 

My problem with unidealistic pragmatism is how effectively it is used to confabulate and rationalize our way to selfishness, psychopathology, short-sightedness, and truly unideal outcomes given our actual resources. Immoral pragmatic epistemologies must be ruled out. We have to seek them out in ourselves and destroy them, teaching ourselves to use wisely pragmatic epistemologies, which necessary include being moral as a condition.

Of course, I grant that I have serious modeling and macroscopic labeling problems. But, over and over again, I find the cards are in my favor in some crucial respects. You see: I have access to the particulars when you do not. As an autist, I am innately skilled at being able to see with detailed-depth in a breadth of domains that you probably cannot. I can more easily see the dots that I'm connecting because I have that perceptual microscope which others do not in some cases. I have to climb the modeling staircase by connecting the metatheory dots for myself and practicing them. I have to become excellent and verbally reasoning about models to solve my Bayesian crisis as an autist. Don't get me wrong, the model is a second-ordered source of meaning we apply to our first-order perceptions (thus the model is king if epistemology is primitive to ontology). I sit closer to the representation to you in some respects and contexts because it is immediate to me; I assume there are analogous modeling strengths (and my weaknesses) on the other side of the Bayesian equation.

I'm going to have strong views being on this extreme end of the Bayesian-perceptual spectrum, and now I must cull my views by working to become a decent modeler. I get to say it in incredible detail to myself, and that's exactly how I build staircases for myself. I build a lot of tiny-little steps in walls-of-text that enable me to work my way up. I have tiny modeling feet, and I just can't make certain kinds of modeling leaps and development that you can.
