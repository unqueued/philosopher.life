[3:15 PM]  h0p3: How's the weekend going for ya?

[9:53 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Hey. It went well... sorry I missed this somehow
[9:53 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Ran a session, got some relaxing in. It was a bad weekend for breathing though haha. How was your weekend?
[11:36 AM]  h0p3: Noice. What happened in the session? Who are you playing in the session these days?
[11:37 AM]  h0p3: I totally get the bad breathing. Hopefully, will schedule an appointment soon. I'm excited.
[11:37 AM]  h0p3: I worked a lot in my wiki this weekend.
[11:37 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: It’s an off game I started when the main group can’t meet. :slight_smile:
[11:37 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Nice
[11:38 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’ll poke through some during my lunch. :slight_smile:
[11:38 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Started my grad school application too
[11:38 AM]  h0p3: Doing a [[Yearly Cross-section]] for [[Wiki Audit]] to completely re-read, edit, and re-organize the wiki too.
[11:38 AM]  h0p3: Fuck yeah, dude!
[11:39 AM]  h0p3: I wonder how much DMing will be useful as a teacher (I think it easily could do some serious work, even if indirectly).
[11:39 AM]  h0p3: So you have a side-group? Is it more randomly PUG?
[11:44 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: It’s the same group minus the OH gang hahaha

[1:46 PM]  h0p3: But, we'll get there.
[1:46 PM]  h0p3: How about you?
[1:46 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Hang in there haha
[1:46 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: It's a rainy day here
[1:46 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: But I like that so I'm good. Other than that I'm just working on shiz.
[1:47 PM]  h0p3: I like rain sounds and piano music together
[1:47 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: That's a KILLER combo :smile:
