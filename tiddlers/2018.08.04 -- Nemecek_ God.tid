title: 2018.08.04 -- Nemecek: God

We talk about religion quite a bit today. 

I'm working on parsing on the JSON (soon enough):

`echo '{"method": "read", "params": {"options": {"channel": {"name": "adamnemecek,h0p3"}}}}' | keybase chat api >> adam.txt`

I really do want to setup NPM on this fucking wiki. I want to automate these processes.

Phaeton is a nice computer name.
