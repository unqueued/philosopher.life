* Think About It

*** To some degree this is true. The claim of symmetry, unfortunately, is wildly inaccurate. This is not the horseshoe/fish-hook you think it is. It's almost fishy what they aim for her. I agree that when it comes to freedom of speech that Leftists are often woefully wrong on the topic. Insofar as Leftism is the support decentralizing power (and I do!), however, I do not take it to be overtly authoritarian. I will admit that enforcing the rule of law on the wealthy is hard for many to fathom.
