Look, I do think that personhood is basically miraculous. Obviously, she's insanely evil, and she doesn't mean "miracle" in any sense that I do here. I see no reason to think she owns herself without qualification. She really does worship herself as a god.

She doesn't have an argument for why she doesn't have powerful obligations to the poor, materially or in spirit. She has the fascinating beattitudinal-appearance here too. I suggest this is a false virtue-signal.

She might be a piece of shit, but she's mostly honest about being a piece of shit. I have a weird admiration for it.
