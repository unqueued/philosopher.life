!! When and why do you have tension with your brother in conversations?

Because we are talking about something extremely important to us that we might disagree on. We don't want to be hurt, but we also want to express ourselves to each other. When we disagree on something important, we know one of us may be wrong. We desperately don't want to be wrong about important things. We get defensive. I need to be maximally charitable and kind.
