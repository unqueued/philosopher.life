title: 2017.01.31 - Realpolitik Speculation: Open Shadow Government

Governments aren't monolithic. Shadows come in degrees, and this administration is undoubtedly shady. Yes, there is an odd interplay between open and shadow. I'm not quite sure what to think of it.

It is clear, however, that policy design and the process of generating, clarifying, and disseminating information inside the executive branch is moving away from standard conventions and constructs. We've elected an administration which is eschewing record keeping and stakeholder-based policy sculpting in favor of empowering an unaccountable restricted cabal of Trump's //trusted// advisors. This is a terrible precedent for historical reasons, but it is also a bad thing in an immediate and practical way. Internal transparency is increasingly opaque. The paper trail is disappearing and perhaps no longer even being generated. There are internal witch hunts and an alarming paranoia permeates. Power is brazenly being centralized behind closed doors. Fewer and fewer men control our lives. 

I'm increasingly convinced that Trump is at least quarter-puppet. Beyond Trump's engagement in a dangerous prosperity cult (outside of a handful of unique Christians I've met, ultimately all Christians buy into some prosperity teaching), Fox News and Breitbart (also prosperity cults in a way) are enormously influential in his life. They have his ear, and I think they are integrated into this new shadow government.
