I do want to be myself for a living. He seemed to think his writing and himself were unified in a profound way. Self-reflection is the essence of my life, but I also want to be careful to make room for the claim that [[The Telos]] of my life is something outside me. Self-reflection is some kind of relationship between the internal and external, and the external seems to be have more reality. Always be ruminatin' and browsin'.

I sometimes feel a bit like Montaigne's father regarding Latin in the household. I give my children every tool and language I know. I try to be a model to emulate, and I try to give them a radical [[SO]]ed headstart in the existential game of life.

And even if nobody reads me, have I wasted my time in entertaining myself so many idle hours with such useful and agreeable thoughts? In modeling this figure upon myself, I have been so often obliged to shape and compose myself in order to bring myself out that the model has thereby become firm and has to some extent formed itself. Painting myself for others, I have painted my inner self in clearer colors than were my first ones. I have no more made my book than my book has made me: a book consubstantial with its author, concerned only with me, a vital part of my life; not having an outside and alien concern and objective like all other books. Have I wasted my time by taking account of myself so continually, so carefully? For they who survey themselves only in their minds, and occasionally aloud, do not examine themselves so fundamentally nor penetrate so deeply as does he who makes it his study, his work, and his trade, who with all his faith, with all his strength, binds himself to make a lasting account.

Preach, yo!

I want to be seen here in my simple, natural, ordinary fashion, without straining or artifice; for it is myself that I portray...I am myself the matter of my book.

The thing I fear most is fear.

Said in many famous contexts. This is an older meme, sir, but it checks out.

<<<
Every other knowledge is harmful to him who does not have knowledge of goodness.
<<<

I would deny knowledge is knowledge outside of [[The Good]].

<<<
I do not speak the minds of others except to speak my own mind better.

Man after my own heart.

My trade and my art is living.

I can see we don't agree on everything, of course. He's also more aphoristic than I am.
