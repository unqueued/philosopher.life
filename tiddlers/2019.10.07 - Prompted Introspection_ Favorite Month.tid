title: 2019.10.07 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Month

!! What is your favorite month? Why?

Over the course of my entire life, I would argue May or June have tended to be the months in which I've experienced the most pleasure, but that says nothing about my future and pleasure isn't a [[good]] enough measurement. 

December and January are surreal for me because I'm slapped in the face with passage of time, recognizing how quickly my offspring have grown, and I tend to see at least some extended family during those months.

I don't know the answer to these questions.
