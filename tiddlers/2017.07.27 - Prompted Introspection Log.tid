!! What do you think of mental illness?

Is mental illness "bad" by definition? The name seems to imply it. That's how it is used. Of course, people can be wrong. They can frame words so narrowly that they aren't able to understand the real concept they are pursuing.

Deviance isn't necessarily a bad thing, at least not unconditionally. That entitled truism "be yourself" seems quite reasonable in many cases of neuroatypicalism.

What if your deviance tends to be a bad thing for you in the society in which you live. Does that count as an illness? If it's maladaptive, why not? Maladaptive for whom?

Let's push it with a crazy example. Being a woman in history was meant you may have had lower average utility than being a man for most of human history. Does that mean being a woman is having "an illness?" Why not? 

What about being transgender? The lack of acceptance, the Redpill problems you will face, are tremendous. That cascades into many other kinds of problems, including isolation, depression, suicidal tendencies, homelessness, etc. Being an outcast sucks.

You can see that drawing the lines for "illness" is ridiculously hard to do. Further, it is not obvious what counts as "mental" either. 

One thing seems important: neurotribes are at war with each other, whether they realize it or not. Memetic survival played out in genetics is a real thing.

Ultimately, I don't know where to even begin to answer this question. It seems so obvious at first glance, but I don't have the tools or definitions that allow me to offer any kind of satisfactory answer beyond the "you know it when you see it" intuitionist casuistry which doesn't lend itself to discourse beyond "do you see what I see?"
