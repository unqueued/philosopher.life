Yup. This one has been buggin' me. The Chan Philosophy School is always throwing me insidious gutterballs. I can hear Diogenes and Nietzsche jerking themselves off in the corner next to me. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Let's go. 

I cannot speak to this work. Even if it's reproducible (psychology is, like, the worst), I'm not convinced it buys us the argument the author thinks it does. It's still worth thinking about though. There does appear to be something there.

If you put me on an introspective bellcurve, I suggest I'm all the way at the annoying end of it. It's disturbing. Let me show myself how it's done, navel-gazer!

The innervoice can be a very strong effect in me. I actually don't hear an innervoice in every moment of the day, though I can sometimes hear and see it even in my dreams (seriously, I can see myself navigating my own wiki sometimes, writing down the thing I'm wrestling with outloud in my dream). It's exceptionally strong when I'm reading and writing (holy fuck, so loud! Y U SO LOWD 2 URSLF, h0p3?). Stream-of-consciousness is either instinctual emotional reaction for me or, and more usually, a string of words (which isn't so instinctual). I kind of don't even notice it sometimes though because it's just there like a piece of furniture that always somehow there. Sometimes it is fuzzy for me, and I'm not always aware of it. The awareness of my awareness comes and goes. This is, in fact, one of the reasons I force myself to read and write so much. I literally need to talk to myself, and I need to experience myself talking to myself (and talk to myself about it, and experience myself talking to myself about experiencing myself talking to myself, and so on). Introspection without a telos, of course, is a failure. Everything serves a means to an end (including that [[End|The Good]] which necessarily serves Itself).

Alright, so I'm pretty sure this is just part of the human experience. Doesn't everyone do this to some [[dok]]?

I'm at a difficult impasse as an ethicist. One of the primary theories of autonomy boils down to the internalist's coherentist constructivist pursuit of self-unity, integrity, etc. I think there is such a thing as unified evil agency though. Well-integrated psychopaths just are sociopaths who value themselves above all others with astounding efficacy. You really can constitute yourself with a principle other than [[The Golden Rule]], including things like [[T4T]] or "Always Defect." 

I try to always be careful in my distinction between //humans// and //persons//. Evolutionarily, it seems feasible (though I understand there are very good objections) to pin down what counts as a human. Exactly what counts as personhood, however, is a quagmire. I think non-human animals exhibit [[dok]] of personhood. The "dehumanization" worry needs to be a "depersonalization" one instead; it's a terrible mistranslation in our own language. That is the real magic property I need to understand. I have known that for over half my life, and it continues to slip through my fingers.

Is the psychopath responsible for turning off their empathy at opportune moments? Yes. They are a person, an evil one. They really could do otherwise (whatever that means). If personhood is equivalent to responsibility, then I'm not just looking for persons: I'm looking for good persons. This, of course, poses the classic ingroup/outgroup "dehumanization" problem wherein it is so easy to confabulate our way into otherising someone enough to purposely fail to empathize with them [[irwartfrr]]. It's why I seek objectivity so strongly! Humans are damned amazing confabulation/rationalization engines; we are literally telling ourselves stories...that's what the Daseinic emergence just is. Of course, I'm not an anti-realist, though I consider us enormously [[fff]]. We must fight that urge to conveniently tell ourselves the stories of each other in uncharitable or distinctly unfair ways. If you know you're vicious towards one side of the spectrum (selfishness sounds like the evolutionary default!), you must purposely shoot for the other extreme vice ([[irwartfrr]], yes I know, I know, I know), to have a chance to landing on the golden mean.

Neorationalists, HBDers, Alt-Rightist, Channers, etc. do have a serious problem, even though they regularly force me to swallow a redpill that has something correct about it. Their goal, imho, is not to wield their arguments for the sake of [[The Right]], though I would say that about almost all humans I've met. I listen, but I do not trust them. I have to peel apart what they say.

The fact is: I do have outgroups, inescapably. And, I should. I'm radically opposed to simply dismissing others as "NPCs" willynilly. I better have really good reasons to say: you're out! [[T42T]] DOES create outgroups; it requires you, in respecting yourself and others, to stop sacrificially cooperating with those who aren't trying to cooperate.

Heterodoxy does have some element of the NPC thing going on. There is a way in which you aren't considered autonomous when you are evil, and that contradicts what I just said! It's you, but the you isn't a meaningful enough thing. This is the Neo-Platonist point, that somehow the [[dok]] of realness of a thing scales with its Goodness (or Rightness for the Neo-Kantian). There is a very deep problem here! I cannot unsee either direction.

I tend to think nobody is 100% NPC, and insofar as they were, I think they truly lack autonomy necessary to be a moral agent. NPC's aren't persons, but psychopaths (until the 100% mark) really are. Insofar as there is contingency in our agency, there is at least hope. Insofar as we are responsible for that contingency (and, ofc, I have absolutely no idea how to talk about: house of cards), we're not NPCs. The innerlife which allows us to modify the outerlife which stages the innerlife, etc., whatever the feedback loop, just is major computation of our freedom (contingency, of course, is an even larger quagmire).

Perhaps I just need to bite the bullet. I'm worried about desert (what is deserved) here. Set aside the Neo-Platonic view. There is a difference between saying "that's an NPC in this context" and "that person doesn't deserve to be treated like anything other than an NPC in this context." Given the necessity of forgiveness in [[T42T]] per context: to less than the [[dok]] you treat others as mere means you deserve to be treated as mere means. QED, right?
