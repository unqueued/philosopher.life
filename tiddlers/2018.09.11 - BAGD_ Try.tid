title: 2018.09.11 - BAGD: Try

Had to go through my son's schedule with him again. He had no idea what he was doing in deep reading for CS. In fact, he conflated his time to spent testing out one new CLI tool a day with deep reading? His mother and I have been incredibly specific. He tooks notes. We talked. We even handed him the schedule written out for him. How does he not get it?

It's 6. My children still aren't done! This is insane. It is time for unreason.
