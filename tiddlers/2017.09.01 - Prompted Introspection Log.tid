!! Your brother AIR talked to you today. What do you think about it?

I'm really glad we got to talk, even if only for a short time. I'm really happy he called me back. It has been a long time.

I wish we talked more. I wish we had a better relationship. I wish we could be happy. I think we are both crazy busy. I know it's really hard on him. I don't think there's much more I can do. I hope that in time is blossoms and that we have time to see and be with each other more. 

It's sad and happy at the same time. I have mixed emotions. It's overwhelming a bit. I'm sensitive to it. I just want it to work. Co-dependency, yo!
