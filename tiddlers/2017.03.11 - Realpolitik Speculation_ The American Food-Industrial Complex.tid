title: 2017.03.11 - Realpolitik Speculation: The American Food-Industrial Complex

Preface: I suck at controlling my eating habits, and that is at least partially my fault. I am not as disciplined as I should be. I'm working on it though. It's hard to do when you are depressed. I often lack the emotional, temporal, and financial resources to do it right. I use food as a drug, without a doubt. My whole family does, and we know it. My poor health is at least partially my fault. But, it isn't all my fault. There is plenty of blame to go around. My goal here is not only to highlight my hypocrisy but to point out how we are seriously fucking up on feeding ourselves in crucial ways.

We don't produce food and feed ourselves as we should. Capitalism does not incentivize people to be moral, regulate themselves, or make choices which benefit us in general or in the long-term. The American Food-Industrial Complex does not exist to ethically feed humanity; it exists to line the pockets of psychopaths, regardless of the costs.

* The food industry, including a variety of service industries, severely limits or makes it impossible for workers to call in sick. Beyond enslavement, this is a significant public health problem.
* We produce more than enough food to feed everyone in our country and then some. Businesses would rather let food go to waste than miss a sale. They really don't care about feeding the poor, needy, and hungry. Blemished (but perfectly edible) food that lacks marketplace appeal is discarded rather than used to feed the masses.
* Through agricultural subsidies and predatory food manufacturer strategies, it is cheaper, both financially and by time-investment, for the poor to buy highly-addictive ("craveable") food with low or poor nutritional value than healthy options. Our laws are designed to help capitalists target and enslave the poor to these foods.
* Dietary guidelines, studies, and laws are paid for, defined by, and manufactured by food industries and lobbyists who have a vested interest in promoting terrible cultivation methods, distribution strategies, and eating habits for the general population.
* Antibiotic usage in meat industries is a leading cause of the acceleration of antibiotic resistance. The problem may be out of control. Perhaps it is only a matter of time before we see a new and unstoppable Bubonic "Black" Plague.
* The subsidization of corn has artificially distorted several markets, including energy, sugar, livestock feed, etc. It isn't sustainable, and it doesn't create the correct incentives we desperately need in these markets.
* Our foodstuffs breeding programs have eliminated the nutritional value of many of our foods. It gets worse and worse each passing year, primarily because we're overly interested in the price efficiency of volume, as well as surviving pests and harsh weather.
* GMOs are safe, but we are not nearly cautious enough in how we modify our ecosystems. The process and protective measures we take matter. We regulate the industry to some extent. It is an expanding industry, and it seems obvious we need as much regulation as we can muster. The history of genetic modification and breeding have produced serious weapons, and the possibilities of problems arising from genetic modification should not be taken lightly. It should be regulated heavily (although, we obviously must favor and fund research in this area). I agree we are forced to "play god," but we need to be as wise as we can be in our GMO pursuits.
* GMO oligopolies and IP-rights have led to very problematic business practices. We are tying ourselves to capitalist distortions on seed supply.
* Bees are going extinct, and it is likely from agricultural causes. Their pollination is crucial to our existence. Unlike plenty of animals (except for balancing food web-chains in a broad sense), we desperately and almost directly need bees.
* The ecological effects of overfishing are not well-enough understood to justify it. We need to farm fish.
* Farm mammals are significant causes of global warming.
* We treat many farm animals very poorly. I'm not against eating meat. I'm against torturing beings that feel pain without excellent justification on a reasonable utilitarian calculus. Pain should be minimized. We're obviously not maximizing utility.
* The Food-industrial complex is not held to any reasonable standards in advertisement. 
* The Food-industrial complex seeks to privatize land, natural resources (including fresh water), and the ability to produce food. The goal is to enslave us.
* Hungry people lead to unnecessary wars. Hunger exists because we have a fundamental worldwide power struggle with capitalists. We the people are losing, and even more violence is coming for us all.
* The legal fight and conservative movement against the poor and homeless prevents us from even giving them food in many cases. This is no accident.
* Hunger is on the rise.

We have a serious and complex crisis escalating, and capitalism is at the heart of it. This is yet another form of power that continues to centralize in the hands of fewer and fewer people who do not have our best interests at heart.
