title: 2019.08.16 - Prompted Introspection: Rules

!! What is your opinion of having set rules for people to follow?

Autonomy means self-legislating. What it means to be free is to be free to choose the rules or laws we are going to follow (and shut your beautiful face Wittgenstein). What rules ought we follow? Is it the one which says: "don't follow any rules"? Lol. Absolute anarchists, moral anti-realists, and psychopaths are my enemies. The relationship between [[The Moral Law]] and juridical can only be justifiably and recursively re-envisioned through [[TOP]].
