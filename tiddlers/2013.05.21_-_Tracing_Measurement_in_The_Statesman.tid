title: 2013.05.21 - Tracing Measurement in The Statesman

''1 - Introduction''

In this paper, I will trace measurement, and in particular the measure of the mean, as found in the Statesman. I will try to show how and why measurement is a central theme in the Statesman. I hope we can find ourselves in a better position to interpret passages which are less clear or obliquely employ the concept of measurement. 

From what I have gathered, the words “measure,” “measured,” and “measurement” show up a sum total of only fourteen times in the Statesman.<<ref "1">> As for direct synonyms and highly related words to the measure of the mean: the words “fit,” “fits,” “fitted,” “befits,” and “fitting” show up eighteen times in total.<<ref "2">> The word “appropriate” is used three times.<<ref "3">> The words “opportune,” “inopportune,” “opportunely,” and “opportunity” can be found six times.<<ref "4">> The language of the measure of the mean includes so many others words as well, including: need, purpose, extreme, excess, deficiency, etc. The Statesman is littered (or woven) with the language of measurement. 

I can’t hope to provide thorough exegesis for all the passages which explicitly employ the language of measurement. Instead, I’m going to focus closely on the passage directly concerning the art of measurement (283-287). Here we will find the majority of the direct use of “measure” found in the Statesman, and it seems like a fine starting place for explicating measurement in the dialogue. 

My objectives in examining measurement are to provide analysis of fundamental concepts, demonstrate the relationship between measurement and various other topics in this dialogue, consider oddities in the text regarding measurement, and point out how measurement is a key to unlocking the Statesman. 

''2 – Overview of Measurement''

The primary measurement passage, 283-287, follows the long section on weaving. We are left to wonder why weaving wasn’t defined more quickly and simply, as it primarily is just the intertwining of warp and woof. The measurement passage is timely, finally bringing an end to the weaving passage.<<ref "5">> On the face of it, the discussion of measurement is introduced to provide a principle one uses to cure what may be a dialectical “illness.”<<ref "6">>  Beyond addressing the length of the weaving passage, perhaps the discussion of measurement is introduced in order to elucidate or help us interpret the complexities of weaving, but since measurement applies to so much of the dialogue, it is doubtful that the discussion of measurement has such a narrow purpose.  

Measurement is divided into two kinds. This is one of the few divisions that make sense in the dialogue. The Stranger begins the major passage on measurement by claiming we must look “at the entirety of excess and defect.”<<ref "7">> We need a standard which enables us to judge whether something is lacking in some way, either through an excess or deficiency in some quality or characteristic. He says, “About length and brevity and every excess and defect, for surely the art of measurement deals with all these things,” and that we should “divide it into two parts.”<<ref "8">> The Stranger explains the division of measurement in this way: “one is to be characterized in terms of the mutually relative sharing in bigness and smallness, and one in terms of the necessary (indispensable) being of becoming.”<<ref "9">>

This first kind of measurement is mathematical measurement. This kind of measurement is the set of “all the arts that measure number, lengths, depths, widths, and speeds relative to their contraries.”<<ref "10">> Mathematical measurement is quantitative, computable, and the very straightforward and scientific evaluation of things. The Stranger refers to the mathematical measure as the “mutually relative measure.”<<ref "11">> On the Stranger’s view, mathematical measurements are relative to each other.<<ref "12">> We might also think of the mathematical measure as relationship between things and things. To say this object is longer than that one is just to compare objects and point out a spatial difference. To say that this object is cold may just be a relationship of that object’s temperature compared to other objects’ temperatures. Mathematical measurement seems to relate things to things.  

Many kinds of practices and knowledge belong to this art of mathematical measure: knowledge of common units, perhaps an understanding of rudimentary physics, tools to gauge the quantifiable properties of things, and definitely calculation. At first glance, it seems as though procedures involved in mathematical measuring relate an object to some abstract mathematical standard (e.g. the exact length of a meter), and so we might be tempted to claim that the mathematical measure doesn’t relate things to things, but rather things to that abstract mathematical standard. This isn’t so clear though. What is the convention for determining the exact length of a meter? It can’t be done a priori. In fact, the meter “was to be constructed so that it would equal one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator along the meridian running near Dunkirk in France and Barcelona in Spain.”<<ref "13">> A meter as a measurement is a distance between two things we experience, and hence, claiming an object is a meter long is demonstrating a spatial relationship between that object and the distance between North Pole to the Equator in a specific setting. All units of mathematical measurement seem to be like this. Hence, we might argue mathematical measurement ultimately relates things to things.

The other kind of measurement, the more important one, is the non-mathematical measure, what we will call the “measure of the mean.” This is the art of due measure. In contrast to mathematical measurement, things are relative to the measure of the mean. To say a table is merely tall, in the mathematical sense, is just to say that compared to some other things, it is on average taller. The mathematical measure, however, can never say the table is “too tall” or “too short,” but this is exactly what the measure of the mean enables us to do. This is part of what the Stranger is talking about when he characterizes the measure of the mean “in terms of the necessary (indispensable) being of becoming.”<<ref "14">> Objects or activities must meet certain conditions in order to achieve or bring about certain ends.

The measure of the mean is a teleological concept, whereby things are measured as being good for a purpose, and where lacking derives from an excess or deficiency of certain characteristics necessary for fulfilling that purpose. The measure of the mean is a standard deeply intertwined with the good.<<ref "15">> This standard may not only be entangled with the good, but also the beautiful. The Stranger asks, “And it's in exactly this way, by preserving the mean, that they produce everything good and beautiful?”<<ref "16">> There is kind of an aesthetic as well as utilitarian angle to the measure of the mean. The aesthetic angle may be less clear. Consider what it means to say that there is “too much” of a color in a painting. The “for the sake of which” in that phrase is aesthetic.<<ref "17">> 

The Stranger later extends or elaborates on the measure of the mean as “all the arts that measure relative to the mean, the fitting, the opportune, and the needful, and every-thing settled toward the middle and away from the extremes.”<<ref "18">> These are different ways in which the measure of the mean is revealed or applied. “The mean” itself sits on a spectrum between deficiency and excess for the sake of some end. If something measures precisely to the mean on that spectrum, it has the characteristics which best fulfill the purpose of that thing. It doesn’t have too little or too much of a quality. The mean is a surprisingly quantitative picture of the good of a thing. “The fitting” and “the needful” aim at how things belong together in a certain way, pointing to those conditions necessary for the perfect production or acquisition of an end. “The opportune” refers to the temporal conditions of reaching an end. This might be as mundane as a baseball player who swings too early at a pitch, but it may be more subtle, such as having the social awareness to know when it is acceptable to interrupt a conversation and when it isn’t. There are various manners in which one might measure a thing to the mean. 

The Statesman points out how we are able to know a thing based on numbers (mathematical measurement), and another way of knowing a thing in terms of the good (measure of the mean). Consider the humble chair as a concrete example. We can mathematically measure various aspects of the chair. We can measure dimensions, electrical resistance, temperature, weight, density, etc. The mathematical measure quantifies, but it does not qualify. In contrast, the measure of the mean qualifies. The measurement of the mean tells us that a chair is too short or too tall for a purpose, or too heavy or light for being the kind of a chair we need for a given situation, or dismisses the significance of the mathematical measurement of electrical resistance of chairs in almost all circumstances (I suppose we could come up with a few exceptional examples, but the criteria for exceptions is still the measure of the mean). The measurement of the mean assesses whether or not something lives up to a normative standard. The mathematical measure cannot do this; in fact, just on its own, the mathematical measure seems to lack significance altogether. 

The measurement of the mean is what gives mathematical measure significance. The mathematical measure is subservient to, subordinate to, and parasitic upon the measure of the mean. The distinction between the two kinds of measurement is important, but we cannot fully pull apart mathematical measurement from the measure of the mean. To peel them apart completely would destroy the technical arts according to the Stranger.<<ref "19">> The arts require both kinds of measurement. If the technical arts were to be destroyed, as the Stranger claims, then statesmanship and weaving would also be destroyed. Clearly, even when employing mathematical measurement, the measure of the mean is vital to the existence and nature of statesmanship and weaving.

Continuing with the chair example, perhaps I can figure out my chair is too tall for my purposes (measure of the mean), but I might not know exactly how much shorter it needs to be (mathematical measure). When I say to the chair-building/modifying carpenter that my chair is too tall, he being an expert of sorts on the nature of heights of chairs may be able to assess my chair and then tell me that my chair is precisely two inches too tall. He could only make such a claim by already understanding exactly why I needed the chair to be two inches shorter – maybe, in this case, the carpenter has the necessary experience to realize that taking two inches off the chair is the exact height I would need, given my own height, to sit comfortably. In this example, I was always able to immediately understand the mathematical measurement of two inches, but I could only partially uncover the measure of the mean for the chair. I knew it wasn’t quite right for my purposes (being comfortable), but not more than that. The carpenter, however, having far more experience in this matter, knew the measure of the mean between my chair and purpose with far more precision.

This example hopefully highlights one of the more fascinating aspects of the measure of the mean: it can be difficult to uncover its precision. Mastering the measure of the mean requires a kind of virtue of the practice. Perhaps only through repetition and training can one develop the crucial perceptive awareness necessary to uncover its precision. The measure of the mean is highly contextual, bordering on particularism. This kind of measurement can lack definitiveness in general; the correct measurement varies with the circumstances. Perhaps the mean isn’t always an exact point, perhaps it is a range.  Further, the measure of the mean is used to evaluate not only those things which are computable, but also those which might not be computable. Courage, for example, might not be mathematically quantifiable (perhaps psychologists may eventually be able to explain otherwise), but it certainly falls within the qualitative domain of the measure of the mean. The measure of the mean defines excess and deficiency even beyond what may be the limits of mathematics. 

Mathematics is precise, but ultimately, I believe Plato’s aim is to show that there is a notion of the precise that goes beyond the mathematical, and has something to do with the good (and the beautiful possibly), and the measure of the mean is the criterion and application for that. 

Weaving and statesmanship seem closely bound to the measure of the mean, exactly how, I’m not sure. Weaving seems to be the easier example to employ for appreciating the division in the arts of measurement, since weaving on one hand does seem to rely heavily upon the mathematical, and yet it requires the measure of the mean for significance and for guiding us toward achieving the ends of weaving. It is quite unclear to me how statesmanship relates to the mathematical measure as concretely or as easily as weaving, although given the abstract nature of statesmanship, the measure of the mean appears far more central to statesmanship than it does weaving. 

I do not think it is a coincidence that the Statesman is so cryptic in the way in which it employs measurement. Surely successfully interpreting the Statesman as a dialogue and trying to uncover the eidos of the statesman require skilled applications of the measure of the mean.

''3 – Tensions and Irony''

The tension between these two kinds of measurement is apparent throughout the dialogue. The lengths of certain sections of the Statesman seem to be too long or too short. Some arguments move too quickly and others too slowly. Blatant (perhaps even humorous) measurement-based mistakes are made and corrected repeatedly. It is too ironic to be accidental. 

The discussion of myth and weaving seem too long (even by the Stranger’s standards), while the discussion of more interesting and crucial topics in metaphysics, such as parts, kinds, wholes, and paradigms are far too brief (despite the amusing claim that they are “stray[ing] further afield” in 263a). The Stranger is oddly aware of (yet sometimes failing to be correct in) these measurements in the discussion, and it is unclear what we are to make of this. His focus on excessive length over deficiencies found in other parts of the discussion is interesting. It reminds me of a way of talking about vice and virtue, and I wonder if we are to view the Stranger as lacking or having excellence because of his possibly skewed perceptions in this regard. The Stranger and measurements of his discussion are odd, and I do not know why Plato has written the Stranger like this.

Perhaps it is meaningful (perhaps it is coincidental) that the primary passage on measurement is literally near the middle of the dialogue. Our attention is drawn to measurement in even following the outline of the Statesman. Why is Plato doing this? I have no idea. I suspect that a satisfying systematic interpretation of the Statesman must make sense of these concerns, and the measure of the mean is likely central to such an account. 

This tension can even be seen from the beginning with the discussion between Socrates and Theodoras. Theodoras is a mathematician, and the status of mathematics is called into question in this dialogue. For instance, Theodoras’ error(s) points toward the limits of mathematics, alluding both to the notion that some things cannot be mathematized and perhaps to a sort of impotence of mathematics in the dialectic. Further, while the mathematician and the mathematical measure can be seen as privileged in science and paradigm cases of knowledge in epistemology, the statesman (and perhaps the virtuous agent) and the measure of the mean seem to be privileged in the discussion of the philosopher and paradigm cases of practical reason. At any rate, it does seem as though Plato wishes to take mathematics down a peg or two in this dialogue.  Here the mathematical measurement seems less and less directly relevant to the dialectic, and the measure of the mean shines. Mathematics looks to be incapable of helping us investigate the nature of the philosopher and its apparitions, the sophist and the statesman. The measure of the mean, in contrast, looks to be a large and necessary component of the investigation in the Statesman.

''4 - Diaeresis''

The method of diaeresis employed by the Stranger is intriguing, and it is certainly related to the issue of measurement. Diaeresis is the continual division of larger groups into relatively equal and smaller groups – a process which is meant to be repeated until the definition being sought after has been found. I must confess, I don’t understand why it is used or what is meant by it. Without a doubt, the method and various divisions made in the Statesman are generally odd.

In the Statesman, the Stranger employs diaeresis to find and define the statesman. In the context of biology or other scientific taxonomies, diaeresis looks to be a reasonable sort of tool for the job. However, it is not so clear why Plato has the Stranger use the method to investigate and define the statesman, a context where diaeresis seems far less effective. The Stranger explains how the method relates to the finding and understanding the statesman:

Then where will one discover the direct statesman-path? For we must discover it and, after separating it off from the rest, stamp it with one look, and then, after marking the other, side-paths as a single form, make our soul think of all the sciences as being two forms.<<ref "20">>

That sounds like a plan. It isn’t clear, however, by what standard these divisions should be made. This look, idea, or form of the statesman does seem to be what we are seeking. Separating it from everything else does seem to be necessary. It remains unclear, however, why diaeresis, a tool whose criterion pivots around a mathematical equality between the subdivisions, is the best tool for accomplishing these tasks. 

Diaeresis seems to be caught between the two kinds of measurement. The method’s failure is especially evident in the scolding of Young Socrates, who manfully divides man and beast. <<ref "21">> Does not Young Socrates’ division seem like the sort of “stamping” we seek in 258c? Surely the Stranger must be wrong, and this must be the correct division; it is perhaps the division made by one who could employ diaeresis with the measure of the mean in mind. The Stranger explains that it is “safer to go cutting through the middle,” something akin to the mathematical middle.<<ref "22">> But, from our vantage point, the Stranger’s mathematically-based method of diaeresis, much like a binary search tree, turns out be an inefficient method of inquiry at best, and at worst, it seems to steer us in the wrong direction, failing to uncover what is salient. It is not clear why the Stranger makes these apparent errors. 

Again we are reminded of the two kinds of measure at the end of the scolding, where the Stranger amusingly claimed that by going too fast, they were slowed down.<<ref "23">> The measure of the mean here is concerned with “how much we understand,” while the mathematical measure is concerned with the time taken in the dialectic. 

''5 – Wholes, parts, and kinds''

The distinction between parts, wholes, and kinds seems to be another branch of the concept of measurement. These issues highlight the real goals of diaeresis and sit at the heart of effective division making and weaving together. These subjects are a fine example of ancient ontological and metaphysical problems which we’ve made little headway on in modern philosophy (despite quite a bit of effort). The answers to the questions raised in these matters are unclear. What does seem clear, however, is that solutions to these puzzles of part-whole and part-kind (philosophic puzzles crucial to effectively identifying, classifying, and defining) are preconditions to a complete explanation of true and effective eidetic division and analysis. These puzzles seem to be more related to the measure of the mean than they are to mathematical measure.

Plato brings up these problems, but does not seem to satisfyingly resolve them.<<ref "24">> This foundational problem is highlighted in one of the major explicit aims of the text, namely to reveal and understand how the person with political expertise should be distinguished from the other kinds of rival experts in the city.<<ref "25">> Whatever precisely it is about diaeresis (or other methods of dividing, classifying, and revealing) that we find distasteful or unsatisfying in trying to accomplish this explicit goal of the dialogue may only ultimately be uncovered by first attending to the metaphysical measurement problems of parts, wholes, and kinds. 

Further, these unsolved puzzles of parts, wholes, and kinds are surely central to one of the other central goals of the text, namely explaining why and how political science and the statesman are so important to philosophy and the philosopher.  The relationship between these agents and practices remain a mystery, partly due to lacking a full understanding of the metaphysics of relationships and identity.

Measurement seems to be embedded in the metaphysical problems of parts, wholes, and kinds; to what extent the measurement is mathematical and to what extent it is the measure of the mean is not clear. Perhaps these form a different kind of measurement altogether. 

The Statesman serves to highlight the differences between and status of mereology, set theory, and eidetic analysis.<<ref "26">> Interestingly, mathematics has made some headway in the first two, but not the last; philosophy, however, may not have gotten much further than Plato. The fundamental and true natures of these problems remain unsolved or unexplained. At the very least, Plato reveals some of the unobvious, underpinning problems and questions of our larger investigation. Philosophy tends to show even more problems lurking under the surface of original problems, and philosophy also sometimes points toward how ostensibly separate matters can turn out to be intertwined. 

''6 – The Statesman, the Virtuous Agent, and the Philosopher''

This section on measurement is fertile ground for discussions of not just politics (and its relationship to philosophy), but also ethics. Who knows and uses the measure of the mean the most? Who best aims at the mean? What does it take to uncover the mean? The statesman, the ethically virtuous agent, and the philosopher are somehow bound together by a common thread in the Statesman. I think that bond has something to do with the measure of the mean. Granted, many activities employ the measure of the mean, but some use the measure of the mean more than others. Statesmanship, virtue, and philosophy seem to require the use of this measure more than anything else, and the teleological stakes are very high for all three agents.
 
The measure of the mean is found and employed through phronesis. Phronesis is practical wisdom; it is particularistic and prudential. Phronesis seems to be at the heart of picking out which particular actions are needed for particular contexts, and the measure of the mean is the standard used by one with phronesis. Phronesis and the measure of the mean can be surprisingly concrete, being a kind of instrumental reason, as they deal with fundamental ends-to-means relationships, but they are also abstract and theoretical, since practical action must be evaluated by and linked to the Good by an agent. 

The statesman and the virtuous agent seem to be more closely linked than the statesman and philosopher (or virtuous agent and philosopher) at first glance. Indeed, the connection between the statesman and the virtuous agent seems quite apparent in this dialogue, and that makes a lot of sense. Everyone knows that criticizing the moral compasses of politicians is a long-standing (and valuable) tradition. It isn’t a tradition for no reason. Moral compasses are obviously an important part of being a good statesman. 

The measure of the mean foreshadows Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean. While we have been talking about the mean as being related to the good, it seems as though one might also employ the very same method to the right. The statesman is concerned with the right means to the good ends of the city, quite similar to the virtuous agent. Aristotle’s famous phrase “to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right way” sits right at home in Plato’s explanation of the measure of the mean.<<ref "27">>
The Being of the Beautiful: Plato's Theaetetus, Sophist, and Statesman
The dialogue points to the relationship between the statesman and the virtuous agent when the Stranger attacks the standard rule of law, and in its place, he emphasizes the “correctness of rulers without laws” where “the best thing is not for the laws but for a man-the king with intelligence-to have strength.”<<ref "28">> This kind of intelligence is phronesis. On this view, laws are too general, and they fail to appreciate what is morally or legally salient about particular contexts. Laws may turn out to be practical guidelines we end up needing, but they are crude approximations, and they can never compete with an excellent statesman employing phronesis in a particular situation. Laws lack precision, while the excellent statesman knows the precise action to take in a circumstance (for the sake of the city, not the individual, as the Stranger points out in 295a) because he has the necessary phronesis to uncover and use the measure of the mean in that context. But this discussion of the law is precisely like one of the key aspects ethical virtue theory. 

The denial of practical codifiability and computable decision procedures is one of the crucial differences between virtue theory and its competitors. The criticism of political law in the Statesman is the same kind of criticism of ethical law in standard virtue theories. The one who knows what the city ought to do is remarkably parallel to that one who knows what one ought to do.

The phronesis shared between the excellent statesman and the virtuous agent seems to be reliant upon a kind of moral judgment, intuition, and the right sort of perception. Having the right reason and the right emotions are necessary for reaching the right action for the virtuous agent, but it isn’t clear if emotions play as significant a role in statesmanship. It might. Another difference between the virtuous agent and the excellent statesman would be the will. It is already a significant matter of debate how we define and understand the will for individuals, such as for the virtuous agent; it is a much more complex and difficult matter to isolate the meaning and nature of a will for a city and the role of the statesman in shaping that will. The status and nature of the unification of virtues also seems different among the statesman and the virtuous agent. The Stranger argues in 305E-308B that the virtues conflict, which sits in contrast to the harmony we normally see in virtue theory. Despite these differences, I wonder if the truly excellent statesman is not also a virtuous agent with additional technical knowledge regarding politics and the practices of weaving the city together. Perhaps the excellent statesman helps the city achieve eudaimonia in some sense. 

Plato seems to give us reasons to think the virtuous agent and excellent statesman are bound together by phronesis and the measure of the mean. It is far less clear how the philosopher is bound to the other two. It is not clear how and when the philosopher employs phronesis. We might be tempted to believe phronesis is too practical to be necessary to the philosopher in the same way that it is necessary to the virtuous agent or the statesman. The philosopher seems to have her head stuck in the clouds in many ways. Her work is theoretically minded and often not obviously practical (although it clearly has significant ramifications to the practical). Phronesis seems different from sophia. The philosopher seems to have wisdom of the theoretical rather than the practical, and if that is correct, it seems as though sophia is more important than phronesis. 

The supposed point of the Statesman was to define and understand the statesman as an apparition of the philosopher. What connects the statesman and the philosopher? The measure of the mean is likely a key component to the complete answer. The statesman appears to require the mathematical measure for his purposes moreso than the philosopher for hers, a significant difference, and yet both the statesman and philosopher rely heavily upon the measure of the mean to achieve their invaluable ends. The statesman employs the measure of the mean for the sake of the city (and perhaps the city is for sake of having philosophers), and the philosopher for the sake of sophia. As we saw in the Statesman, both engagement in the dialectic and division as a method of eidetic analysis rely upon the measure of the mean, and these are essential tools and practices of philosophers. Maybe phronesis guides the philosopher in obtaining sophia in this manner, and the measure of the mean is more crucial to the roles of the statesman and philosopher than to other activities. I tentatively conclude the Statesman binds the philosopher and statesman together through their deep need and significant use of the measure of the mean.
