title: 2018.05.25 - Prompted Introspection Log: Dead As A Doornail

!! Explain why we say, "Dead as a door nail".

Door nails are hammered through and clenched, rendering them too useless for any other purpose.

Bent nails are also considered "dead" in their uselessness. 

I suppose the usefulness of a thing dictates its deadness or lack thereof. 

Why we say it probably depends on a number of contexts, triggers, motivations, etc. I do not feel it necessary to enumerate or explore these.
