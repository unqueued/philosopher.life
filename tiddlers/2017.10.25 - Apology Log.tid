I am sorry that I've done such a poor job helping you through your math. While I don't know how to juggle the needs of both of you at the same time in a fair manner, nor do I know how to kindly motivate you, it is my job to figure out how to do so (and to have it figured out sooner rather than later). I am sorry for not being kind and for being unfair.
