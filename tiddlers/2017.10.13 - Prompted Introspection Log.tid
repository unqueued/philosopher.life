!! Three things you’d do if you weren’t so afraid.

# I'd be more prescriptively Redpilled...
#* ...but I fear being morally wrong. I'm hedging my bets as hard as I can. I save it as the last resort.
# I'd create decentralized platforms that I believe are crucial to the world...
#* ...but I fear failure, and I'm worried I can't afford to take up activities which aren't low risk and obviously useful to my family.
# Start my own business now...
#* ...but I doubt myself and fear I don't have a good enough gameplan yet.
