title: 2019.08.19 - Prompted Introspection: Budybodies

!! What is the best way to treat busybodies?

What are their intentions? I tend to be forthcoming when presented the opportunity. I don't give myself much privacy. Maybe they aren't being a busybody with me in this case though. As usual, I simply don't have enough context to give an answer, and I'm far too lazy to enumerate some conditional rubric. Those who aim to unjustifiably centralize power (even if they do not appreciate the claim) do not receive much in the way from me beyond the chance to hear a different perspective; busybodies that are big brothers are enemies. P2P budybodies have significant moral rights, however, and those I'm obligated to treat as equals to some [[dok]].
