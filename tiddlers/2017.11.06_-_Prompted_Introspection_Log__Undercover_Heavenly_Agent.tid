title: 2017.11.06 - Prompted Introspection Log: Undercover Heavenly Agent

!! What would you do if you were an undercover agent in heaven?

This sounds a bit like //The Good Place//.

I'd be shocked that there is a heaven, an afterlife, at all. I'd have to contemplate that for quite a while. I'd be extremely curious, sensitive, and investigatory.

How would I know I was an undercover agent? Why was I an agent, for whom, etc.? Do I have reason to think it's a sham? Do I have reason to think I would be caught? What are the risks and rewards? What are the mechanics of the afterlife? 

There are so many unknowns. I have to say, the "undercover agent" is just an additional layer to what would already be an overwhelming set of considerations. I think I would be in complete disbelief.
