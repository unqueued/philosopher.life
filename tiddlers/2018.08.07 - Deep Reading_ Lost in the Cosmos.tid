title: 2018.08.07 - Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos

I have slowed down so much in my reading! This is bathroom reading, of course.

I'm finally near the end, the part where we encounter aliens. This is an important moment for me because I am deeply interested in the nature of personhood, Reason, autonomy, and [[Finding The Others]] as act of hospitality towards the "alien." This is a key aspect.

The C1, C2, C3 is poorly done. The usual sexual and religious bullshit is here. He clearly thinks we need "help" from an anthropomorphized God of some kind (even though he uses the "alien" language). It's a forced narrative.
