title: 2017.05.10 -- Realpolitik Speculation: Astroturfing, Imageshaping, and Mass Manipulation

Recently John Oliver put up a site, http://gofccyourself.com, which redirects you automagically through the now labyrinthine public FCC feedback site, https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/proceedings?q=name:((17-108)). A few things happened. Our now gutted FCC organization claims they were the target of a DDOS when Oliver called on the masses during his show to write to the FCC about the need to protect net neutrality, which Trump is, of course, targeting along with Republicans, media companies, and data carriers. 

ISPs/carriers, in particular, have been in full imageshaping mode. The lies are disturbing. Sometimes I find it hard to believe that anyone could be that selfish. Given their past direct attacks on net neutrality, indirect attacks through shaping public opinion and even the appearance of that opinion to the public are clearly in their playbook as well.

Of course, the DDOS may or may not be true. We've not seen logs, and I'm still skeptical that they are competent enough to handle that many requests a second (even though they should). Even more skeptically, if I don't see it as ignorant incompetence, it may even be a form of malice that purposes attempts to silence the dissenters from participating. Another part of me thinks that it easily could be true. Those who don't want net neutrality, the wealthy and powerful, could also pay for such a thing.

I will say this, it is clear that the FCC and several public forums have been astroturfed in recent days over the issue of net neutrality. The 130k posts from bot spamming are almost too obvious, but also appear to use false and/or stolen identities. Gross. Captchas would be nice.

I am not convinced this is standard online alt-right at all. Although, I've seen there astroturfing and brigading a'plenty. The tongue-in-cheek attempt to spam "appropriating my culture" alt-right backlash is almost funny. /r/The_Donald, Voat, and 4chan are still actively trolling. This FCC "DDOS" and spamming, however, doesn't feel like them at all.

Someone had a large database of personal information to spam the FCC. There are serious players, like ISPs, at work here.

I can only assume this botspam will be used as "evidence" that the American public ultimately is anti-net neutrality, even when it isn't (yet). It will be used to delegitimize pro-net-neutrality opinions. Republicans are more than willing to lie to our faces (not that Democrats are much better), but giving them half-truths arms them with tangible mind-weapons.

Ultimately, the luddites and retards in our country will take up the anti-net-neutrality sheeple stance. You've seen how much of an indicator education is as a predictor of where people stand on political, social, and ethical issues (and even who they'll vote for POTUS). I desperately seek for everyone to be fully functioning citizens. If they are voting alongside me, they need to understand the world as best as possible. But, no, computers are scary, I don't understand them, they've taken our jobs, and thus they must be evil. 

I detest ignorance and malice.
