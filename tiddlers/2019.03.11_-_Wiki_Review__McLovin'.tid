title: 2019.03.11 - Wiki Review: McLovin'

* [[2019.03.10 - Music Exploration: Moar]]
** Loving it.
* [[2019.03.10 - Link Log: Ride]]
** It almost feels a bit like the [[APFVD]] structure when you squint. The //Focus// is in the middle, the body.
*** Hmm.. Not exactly.  //About// does a ton of work.
* [[2019.03.10 - Family Log: A log]]
** Crystal jokes cannot help themselves.
* [[2019.03.04 - JRE: Furries]]
** Barely connected last week.
* [[2019.03.10 - JRE: high af]]
** Like me on the phone, lol. I don't type anything long on it without an actual keyboard. Voice does work though.
* [[2019.03.04 - K: Crazy Players]]
** What is happening here?
* [[2019.03.05 - K: Ardent]]
** That was odd. 
* [[2019.03.06 - K: Crawl]]
** He's feeling especially down, I think.
* [[2019.03.07 - K: Raid Canceled]]
** Probably doesn't want to talk, right?
* [[2019.03.08 - K: Bdays]]
** I appreciate that he's interested in the right words.
* [[2019.03.10 - K: Wonderful.]]
** Signal. Pay attention.
* [[2019.03.04 - AG: School]]
** It must be weird talking to what is functionally a random person.
* [[2019.03.07 - AG: Food]]
** Wet Noodle, noobie, it's hard to practice this. Gotta start somewhere.
* [[2019.03.08 - AG: Good]]
** I am likely 10 times more awkward. She's doing a great job.
* [[2019.03.04 - AA: Personal Blessing]]
** Yeah, that's not evidence. =/
* [[2019.03.06 - AA: Esketamine]]
** I'm surprised she caught that while browsing. I had to search for it. Quite surprised, unless she's talking about the initial letter mention, but that isn't the same.
* [[2019.03.07 - AA: Jets & Bread]]
** She's spending a lot more time talking about her daughter [[AG]] with me. Cool.
* [[2019.03.08 - AA: Bread]]
** She hasn't been sleeping well for multiple days. =(
* [[2019.03.09 - AA: Sleep Trouble]]
** She blushes a lot. As with many languages, I am a terrible interpreter of emoji.
* [[2019.03.07 - T-Money: Drugs and Taxes]]
** His opening claim doesn't strike me right.
* [[2019.03.09 - T-Money: Rap]]
** My kids at the school do so as well. It's neat.
* [[2019.03.10 - T-Money: Power Outage]]
** It's interesting to see the people around me capture their lives primarily in pictures and videos. I just don't see it. Maybe when I'm older?
* [[2019.03.09 - Tasha: Exploring]]
** Forgot the field.
* [[2019.03.08 - Jop: The Trip]]
** Fascinating to see her evolution with social media.
* [[2019.03.04 - Sho: Bheatha]]
** I love googling with her.
* [[2019.03.10 - BDS97: Gibberish & Pavlov]]
** I adore having a single person in my life that has remotely as much paranoia as I do at that scale. I feel bad for those who have even more of it when it's maladaptive for them.
* [[2019.03.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Anarchism as Socialism]]
** Edited. Speculation now.
* [[2019.03.10 - Prompted Introspection: Dream Car]]
** I clearly don't understand enough about it. Imagination is another one of them tricky words.
* [[2019.03.10 - Wiki Review: WR]]
** MLWOLLTFNO := my language will only look like this from now on
* [[2019.03.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Food in da House]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.03.10 - TDL: Work Already]]
** No, the math comes before the simulation. You just suck at it. That's it, dude. Still, you might have to try anyway.
