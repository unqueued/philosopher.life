title: 2018.02.01 - h0p3's Log: My Daughter

I'm losing my mind with my daughter. She refuses to do her work, to focus, etc. I have no carrots, only sticks. I show her what I have to become, it is my last resort; I am incompetent. How can I teach her just to do it? How do you teach executive functioning and wisdom? I barely have a grasp of it myself.
