SMS isn't something I check much, so sorry I'm late to seeing this.
January 15 2020 12:21 PM
I'm doing okay. Been sick lately, but everything else is going well. Move has been slow and comfortable enough.
January 15 2020 12:22 PM
How are you?
January 15 2020 12:22 PM
That's ok, you are not late. I don't expect you to answer right away. I'm sorry that you don't feel good. We are doing ok. I'm working full time now ,so not much free time like in the past. [[ALM]] is working hard. The girls are doing good.üòÅ

I am glad the girls are doing good. How are their lives, and what are they interested in?
January 15 2020 6:49 PM
Their lives are good spoils( from grandparents as can be), Melissa loves reading for fun but doesn't like math very much. Sarah loves math but not a fan of reading for fun.

I'm glad to hear they enjoy learning so much. It's a gift to have offspring who do.
January 15 2020 7:09 PM
How are you enjoying your full time position?
January 15 2020 7:10 PM
I never heard much about your trip to Thailand. How was it?
January 15 2020 7:12 PM
My job....
January 15 2020 7:20 PM
I applied for a teacher assistant for VPK but 
January 15 2020 7:21 PM
Two teachers got fired from the class so now I am a teacher of the class.
January 15 2020 7:22 PM
So I'm doing my best.
January 15 2020 7:23 PM
That must keep you very busy. Are they paying you the full-time teacher's salary?
January 15 2020 7:24 PM
Not yet until I get my paperwork done, soon.
January 15 2020 7:26 PM
For the trip was tiring and fun in the same time. 
January 15 2020 7:29 PM
I bet. It must have been quite a time for you and your children.
January 15 2020 7:31 PM
Food and family were the best!
January 15 2020 7:34 PM
I'm glad for you. That is excellent.
January 15 2020 7:34 PM
Thank you. I will tell you more later my baterry is about to die.
January 15 2020 7:40 PM
To continue üòÅ I got to try real Korean food at the airport. It was good! The girls made some Thai friends. They did like some food. I'm glad they tried. How about your new place? Any snow? Anything you like about the place?
January 16 2020 12:24 PM
Sounds like it was good eating.
January 16 2020 2:12 PM
New place is nice. I may be allergic to something in it. We're figuring that out.
January 16 2020 2:12 PM
Light dusting of snow once, but it is unseasonably warm.
January 16 2020 2:12 PM
I like being close to the grocery store.
January 16 2020 2:12 PM
It's nice to be close to grocery store. I'm sorry that you allergic to something. Hopefully you can fine out soon.
