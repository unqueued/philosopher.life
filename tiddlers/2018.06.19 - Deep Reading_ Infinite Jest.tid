Maranthe and Steeply have such a weird conversation. This is absurd.

DFW is just fucking funny sometimes. His one-liners and descriptions are harsh!

Obviously, I do not empathize with many of these characters. Hal is very difficult to empathize with. I assume, however, that I am viewed in a similar manner by others.

The Lemon Pledge thing is something I'm too lazy to look up. There are a thousand little details like this in the book. Am I a bad reader because I don't think it's worth my time to go down all of these rabbitholes on my first read through?

I went to community college during these highschool years, but it's clear these young men have wildly more opportunity and education than I had.

I've decided Maranthe and Steeply are engaged in a serious philosophical worry. I hear Tillich's argument here.

I've heard the word "cartridge" too many times.

Hal has a strong understanding of social engineering; the's clearly redpilled about social structures and power dynamics.

The tennis player's brainwashing is messed up. It's literally a game. It is an individual sport. 1v1, zero sum, etc. He's talking about social darwinism, capitalism, etc. Yeah, lacking cooperation is lonely. The common enemy argument is correct! This is well-made.

I really do hate Bourgeoisie. 

DFW's computational theory of mind is compelling. I'm glad to see it.

Mario is a foil. It's heartbreaking.

I don't understand the introduction of the Guru character, but I don't understand this chaotic miasma of a story anyways.

Again, yrstruly is some crazy character. I have no idea what's going on.
