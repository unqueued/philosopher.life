Hey [[h0p3]] — you’ve been on my mind lately so I wanted to say good morning and I love you.
4 HR AGO
Morning.
4 HR AGO
I love you too.
4 HR AGO
What brings me to your mind?
4 HR AGO
Honestly just random things. I think about conversations we’ve had a lot, and I realized I hadn’t poked you in a bit so I should.
4 HR AGO
How's life going for you?
4 HR AGO
I hear your voice in my head a lot when people mention anything about morality, as weird as that may sound. xD
4 HR AGO
Well it's a good (ha) thing to think about.
4 HR AGO
It is going. My work-induced depression is making it difficult to pick up and move on from the very work that drags me down, but I am taking baby steps. I’m updating my resume right now so I can poke around.
4 HR AGO
Well, if you need a second look at your resume, I'm happy to do it (though I doubt I'll be useful to you there). I'm sorry about depression.
4 HR AGO
It sucks. =/
4 HR AGO
Honestly I’m having this weird “grown up” moment where I‘m starting to realize that motivation is not required to do what needs to be done. Which seems like a pretty “duh” moment, but I’m slow. Being an optimist usually means I’m brimming with motivation.
4 HR AGO
I would truthfully love for you to look at my resume. I want to know what it says to you.
4 HR AGO
I’ll send it your way once I add my Humana sterf
4 HR AGO
It's difficult to escape the tarpit.
4 HR AGO
Motivation is not a concept I will ever understand well enough. It's a very hard problem.
4 HR AGO
Once I think I get a handle on it I lose it the next day.
4 HR AGO
I can say that motivation is not necessary a brimming and optimistic desire though. Motivation in  the tarpit has a different phenomenology, feeling, or mode.
4 HR AGO
Preach.
4 HR AGO
Lol
4 HR AGO
I'm sorry.
4 HR AGO
It's hard to defeat the inertia, habits, and disposition in us.
4 HR AGO
So. Hard.
4 HR AGO
You weren’t kidding when you said things “crystallize” as we get older. Yeesh.
4 HR AGO
If you can imagine: it only gets harder as your predictive coding becomes more crystallized, less surprised by the world (and often less interested in novelty).
4 HR AGO
No doubt.
4 HR AGO
Lol
4 HR AGO
Ha! I promise I’m not reading your mind xD
4 HR AGO
It's okay, I'm wearing my tinfoil. I'm safe.
4 HR AGO
It’s crazy to me how much less I am “blown away” by things as I get older. It’s like newness isn’t so new?
4 HR AGO
lolol
4 HR AGO
Super meta conversation time
4 HR AGO
I think you should explore Kierkegaard. He's like, the OG Christian Existentialist.
4 HR AGO
Go meta!
4 HR AGO
Writing that down first, hold on
4 HR AGO
The "blown away" reminds me of the aesthetic anxiety, next you graduate to the ethical anxiety! You are in for a treat.
4 HR AGO
...weeeeeeee...
4 HR AGO
This is probably not meta quite in the right way, but oh well. I realized lately that my sister and I have a pattern of behavior. She struggles communicating with me for reasons I don’t think I’ve fully defined yet, but there is definitely some degree of separation there. All I want is for her to be honest and open with me, which she is, but she doesn’t seem to know how to reach out.
4 HR AGO
I feel like I have the same problem with you sometimes.
4 HR AGO
And honestly, I am realizing I also experience the same feeling with you and [[JRE]] — you’re my older brothers that I look up to so much that I seriously overthink how to approach you both.
4 HR AGO
YES.
4 HR AGO
So much mind-reading.
4 HR AGO
And in recognizing that I realize I get anxious when I go to talk to you or [[JRE]] even though there’s NO reason to. URG.
4 HR AGO
It makes no logical sense. Neither of you have done or said things that have led me to think this way, I think I just want so badly for you both to be like “oh wow I’m so proud of you” that I unnecessarily pressure myself.
4 HR AGO
And now I feel like I owe my sister a conversation about this very thing to let her know it’s cool and to just be herself.
4 HR AGO
I can understand being anxious with me (seriously). I'm one judgmental sumbitch. I am surprised by your anxiety with [[JRE]]. Even at his grumpiest (which is quite rare), he's easy going to me.
4 HR AGO
It’s not at all a “I feel like they’re judging me” and more an “I want their approval”
4 HR AGO
Which was ultra-aggravated when [[JRE]] came over the other day to just chill and I was doing everything BUT being chill. I felt like a dingus. XD
3 HR AGO
Well, approval seeking must be done wisely. I can tell you that you must jealously guard your approval-seeking motivations. However, [[The Golden Rule]] requires we seek the approval other [[irwartfrr]].
3 HR AGO
Overthink E V E R Y T H I N G
3 HR AGO
I am accused of that often.
3 HR AGO
Boi, you are a bundle of overthink.
3 HR AGO
I am not convinced that is the case. I have found diving deeper continues to be the only option.
3 HR AGO
What do you mean?
3 HR AGO
I mean, listening to my cognition, being motivated, acting on it, researching, planning, doing the hard mental lifting is the only reason I'm alive.
3 HR AGO
Many times over.
3 HR AGO
I probably seek a high degree of epistemic confidence bordering on a manic perfectionism most find absurd.
3 HR AGO
Fair, fair
3 HR AGO
However, I also get a very detailed and rich map of myself and the world for it. There places I can wander only because I've practiced that much; it induces vertigo in others.
3 HR AGO
I can't solve the approval problem for you.
3 HR AGO
Very true. Sometimes you show me how deep the rabbit hole goes and I have to step back for a second.
3 HR AGO
The question is "why should seek anyone's approval?"
3 HR AGO
Once you have an answer to that, you can start talking about the means to those ends.
3 HR AGO
I tend to seek it as a compass for whether or not I’m heading in a good direction... which has it’s flaws.
3 HR AGO
It's true. I am lucky to have my advisers, to have people who force me to think about it again, to look in the mirror, to tell me my goggles are tinted the wrong color, and that's why I can't see what they are pointing to.
3 HR AGO
It's often painful to remove the goggles, to go back and wrestle.
3 HR AGO
We need the guidance of others. Approval-seeking for the sake of wisdom seems like a wise use of it.
3 HR AGO
Of course, we can be wrong about who should be our compasses. If our origins and circumstances are poisoned enough, it is possible our compasses never guide us to better compasses.
3 HR AGO
I am only a useful compass in some respects. You'll have to develop your own compass in navigating how use the compasses around you. Cognition should be the beginning of it, but eventually you'll train your emotional reasoning to not even require you to slowly and so methodically think about it.
3 HR AGO
[[K]] has been employing a fascinating tactic. It's a "Just Do It" habit where he contacts lots of people each day.
3 HR AGO
It works.
3 HR AGO
His motivation to do so is honestly inspiring. He is a wonderful compass
3 HR AGO
I wish I could carry a cup of it around with me to drink when I need it.
3 HR AGO
This is the second time you have used a metaphor like that. Lol. Yeah, me too.
3 HR AGO
Well, you could try building his habit. Start small like he does.
3 HR AGO
His persistence is the reason I've had many significant conversations with him this year. I've rapidly grown closer with him for it.
3 HR AGO
I will make the recommendation I do to everyone as well: use a wiki, or if that is too much work, use a productivity tool like Evernote. Your is complex, and if you want to mold yourself, you're going to have to put giant tentpegs down designed for placing even more. It's a painful habit to build, and I wish I started as a child doing it (I have already made the mistake with my own by not having started younger).
3 HR AGO
Your life* is complex.
3 HR AGO
My grammar as usual is terrible. I oops words all over the place.
3 HR AGO
I don't know your sister well enough to say much. I'm sorry.
3 HR AGO
I have been trying to reach out to her, and I think she we slowly forming a relationship (which is great).
3 HR AGO
You’re fine dude. And you’re right, I just gotta do it.
3 HR AGO
She probably doesn't have as much as practice as others do in chatting. She seems shy and learning how to speak for herself.
3 HR AGO
I honestly envy the relationship he is building with you through these conversations and use THAT as motivation. Is that weird?
3 HR AGO
She is VERY shy, yes. Which is funny to me because she clearly has so much to say.
3 HR AGO
Sounds like a good kind of envy, not the sort that wishes to detract from what the other has, but rather the sort which causes desire in us to. Take whatever motivation you can to be constructive (and deconstructive insofar as it conceptually necessary to being constructive).
3 HR AGO
You should spam her once or twice a day.
3 HR AGO
You get to do the heavier lifting as the older sister here (congrats!).
3 HR AGO
I honestly have no idea what the best way to contact her is.
3 HR AGO
Which I realize is exactly the problem you had with me.
3 HR AGO
Well, I have her on Signal.
3 HR AGO
She doesn't always have her phone available, and I'm not sure if she uses a computer often. As I said, I don't know her well enough to say anything (which is my fault!).
3 HR AGO
I assume that with repeated positive use of her phone with you, she'll come to value it more, like a feedback loop, you have to start planting and cultivating the seeds of the remote relationship for quite a while before you might see fruit.
3 HR AGO
Very true, very true.
2 HR AGO
I think part of the reason she doesn’t use her phone much is that she loses it often. I don’t think she uses a computer much at all either.
