title: 2018.06.30 - Prompted Introspection: All Growed Up

!! What did you want to be when you grew up?

I think my first "I want to be when I grow up" was a scientist. That's funny to me now because the thought of being a scientist to me sounds pretty awful in many respects, excepting a computer scientist. I had very little guidance. I had a really shitty education in a very poor region of Kentucky though. I did well despite the setbacks.
