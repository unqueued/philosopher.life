title: 2020.02.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Date

* Woke at 11
** Excellent sleep. Blissful even. =)
* Meditation
* Bliss
* Offspring check
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Long discussion with my wife about vocation and continuing to analyze Yale's structures.
* I finally have a circular walking path in the house! 
** Changed the coffee table out for a small island. It should work for my wife, and it gives us the breathing room we need. 
* Dialectures
** Rabbithole. 
** Heavy look at postmodernism, ambition/passion, bayesian regret, lots of deconstruction of excuses, planning, and reasoning about the state of affairs.
* Called [[Charlie]].
* Date
** My wife was unhappy with how I dressed. 
*** Figured out why it struck her so strongly today.
** Fast Korean food.
*** Looks like Saturday mornings and afternoons will be something she devotes to our offspring. There are thing to do, places to go, and they would very much enjoy it.
**** I think this is an important equalizer too. I get so much time with our offspring by comparison. This is a great use of our resources.
** Took a long drive.
** Milkshakes.
* Offspring check
** Also, the mic continues to be useful here. I like not having to knock on their door in some cases. 
* Worked on machines, watched //Watchmen//. 
** I've finally converted to Windows 10. Pretty clean. It's better than when I first tried it out. 
** VM and [[m12]].
*** Now that I have the RAM again, I can afford to run the Window only parts of the network.
** Android VM as well. It's time again.
** I'd like to finish up cleaning my phone up too.
* Cleaning, maintenance
