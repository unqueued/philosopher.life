title: 2019.08.02 - Prompted Introspection: Living Room

!! Tell about your home. Do you have a favorite room? Why?

2-story townhouse, 750ish square feet, carpet, cramped, and we are like some Asians I've met in how we pack everything (plus, autists enjoy it). Our living room is where we spend 10 hours a day, at least. We have walking paths, my offspring and I sit within a 5 foot diameter. There are screens and computers everywhere, plus cats. We live at our desks. I have always adored wherever my [[monster]] lives. =)
