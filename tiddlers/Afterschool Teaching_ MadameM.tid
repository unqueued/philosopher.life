title: Afterschool Teaching: MadameM

Dear Madame 19HM,

This note probably sounds silly, lofty, or even puzzling. I'm sorry, but it's my duty to affirm your work. 

Of all the people I've had the chance to work with at the school, I admire your character most of all. Uncompromisingly, you serve these children. You select the neediest even when no one is looking. It is so rare that I encounter someone so young who understands what matters most as clearly as you do.

Enclosed, you will find a trivial bookmark-card and a book that causes me to weep every time I read it: //Nectar In A Sieve//. It reminds me of you. It is my profound honor to have worked with you. I am sure I will never understand what your gifts to those around you mean in the ultimate analysis. I believe you are a transforming light in the darkness. It screams out of you, and it's blinding to me. I see [[hope]] for [[Humanity]] in you. I doubt we will ever have the chance of meeting again, but thank you for granting me the radical privilege of watching you work with these children. May you be an eternal well in the desert. 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
