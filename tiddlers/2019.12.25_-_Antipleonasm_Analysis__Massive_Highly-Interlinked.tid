title: 2019.12.25 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Massive Highly-Interlinked

what on this massive highly-interlinked website might I want to start reading?

Reading this wiki is far too much work. Surely, there are so many more pleasant things to do with your life. Why start at all? Lol.

Of course, I do not have a practical answer which is satisfactory for this one. I would like to know how to give a simple, linear, and almost cut-and-dry answer to that question in the various contexts that matter. I'm particularly awful at determining which doorways are most valuable for a given person+time or even the average person. Additionally, what I consider most [[salient]] about the site is likely not what most people do, and we can all be wrong for various reasons about that. Sometimes, I think that question is really intending to ask instead: Who do you want your readers to be?<<ref "i">> Why do you want them to read it? I think there's a difference between what someone would want to read and what they ought; I'm interested in the former only in virtue of the latter.<<ref "a">> 

There are some places that tend to be more relevant than others. [[Readme]] is something every new reader should read, but the issue of where best to "start" is something that anyone can reasonably ask, including me on any given day (and, that is what I take myself to be doing, [[WINTCIS]]). While I grant there is a set of correct (or ranked in terms of relevance) answers in a given context (or maxim), I can't say I know how to put my finger on it well enough. If I did, I would have solved some fundamental problems in moral philosophy.

Like any particular perspective in the world, a site ought not treat everything equally in all cases. The goal, on average, I take it, is to pick out in relief what matters most instead of flattening it. That is a crazy hard problem. Some kinds of things, by their very nature, are difficult to uncover, reveal, or give a clean structure to (and that can never be completely accomplished by the [[fff]]). The question is so striking to me because I'm trying to ask and answer that question about the world itself inside this wiki (including this wiki). What on this massive highly-interlinked ~~website~~ ~~internet~~ in the world might I want to start ~~reading~~ investigating and thinking about? This wiki is as generalized a model as I can make it; I take your question to imply: what is worth reading out in the world? At least in part, what's relevant in this site as it relates to what is outside the site? That must sound like woo, hogwash, a complete fucking non-answer.<<ref "u">> I wish I could give you a better one, but that is very much what this site-vessel's metamodern structure is pointing toward through the pomo flooding chaotic sea of meanings.<<ref "e">>

Even Wikipedia, a somewhat homogeneous appearing site, in a sense, ends up being something the reader must search (and not everything on Wikipedia is equally valuable). I don't see a reason to think my own wiki shouldn't be similar beyond a set of entrances that attempt to describe my protocols and overall approach. [[Root]], [[Readme]], and the sidebar are the best starting places I know of (hence why they are essentially the front page); I use them too. You have to bring prior intentional material (and the more consciously aware of it you are the better) to the table to figure out what to make of the wiki in the right order.

I have a range of people who have taken a look, and I usually end up pointing to at least slightly different parts of my wiki, [[WINTCIS]]. One thing I refrain from doing much at all is marking for [[others]] what I think is relevant for them in this pile (though this is slowly changing over time, I would argue). I tend to do so in direct conversation where we both have skin in the game. I prefer we pick out the [[salience]] for us (and perhaps beyond) together. It is likely the case that a reader is best served by writing with me. You need to ride me like a sherpa-donkey on the pukevat wasteland pile of a telic cannon.<<ref "l">> 

I [[hope]] in time to eventually have a much cleaner hierarchical/tree answer (though, I suggest it will always be a steep climb in some areas). I don't know well enough what it will look like way down the instrumental road.

<<footnotes "i" "I am open to the possibility that machine-assisted reading of this wiki (beyond the fact that it's already a digital medium) will be necessary. Crazy as it sounds, I remain open to the possibility that a non-human intelligence will //read// it as well.">>

<<footnotes "a" "Reason #23490834 this wiki will not be read by almost anyone.">>

<<footnotes "u" "Feel free to argue I take my work and myself far too seriously too.">>

<<footnotes "e" "This is a place where I must //show// and not just //tell//. While the wiki is a pile, I am proud of //why// it's a pile in this respect. Arguably, there's a way in which I do a decent job of demonstrating how hard it is to answer that philosophical question in a generalized fashion (it's downright a Continental Analytic hybrid, a mix of technical definitions and structures with the wandering subjectivity narrative, as qualitative and quantitative as I can make it). In addition, I don't think I'm preserving [[an entire universe|2018.08.23 - Josiah: Tiff?]], but I do see myself as trying to preserve an evolving set of perspectives, and there's an [[infinigress]] to being meta about or having yet another functional perspective on [[other]] perspectives (even versions of oneself).">>

<<footnotes "l" "Assuming you trust me (and likely even if you didn't), at some point, live interaction with [[The Other]] is the most energy-efficient empirical method; eventually, passively reading for the same information is far more expensive both in terms of how much must be read and how much must be simulated.">>
