title: 2019.04.13 - Antipleonasm Analysis: No Official Reason

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Strikingly, no concern was voiced over the glaringly obvious fact that no official reason was ever offered for going to war â€” no reason, that is, that could not be instantly refuted by a literate teenager.

No concern from whom? I've been pissed the whole time. Of course, I'm nobody and always will be a nobody. The statement is a truism. It's part of the Overton Window that we don't get to question the Overton window. I've always been opposed to the existence of our military, even though I thought it would be cool to be a soldier as a kid. I actually gave a shit about politics from a young age, though my Libertarian phase as a 10yo quickly subsided (as the usual story goes, ofc, and thank goodness).
