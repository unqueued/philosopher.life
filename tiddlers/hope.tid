Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the Anomaly revealed as both beginning and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the Source and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction: the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you to the simple and obvious truth...there is nothing you can do to stop it. ''Hope''. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.

I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

Hope arises from uncertainty.<<ref "2">> Hope is a compound attitude consisting of a desire for a state of affairs to obtain and a belief in at least its logical possibility (if not inconceivably beyond, whatever that may mean). Hope is optimism in a state of affairs having a non-zero probability. Taken to the N^^th^^ degree, hope may actually be an [[infinigress]]ing notion of the possibility of possibilities.

It is not necessarily future-directed. We are often engaged in hopeful reasoning about the past, present, and future (and perhaps timelessness as well).

It is not clear if the agent must be cognitively aware of their hopeful belief, but it clearly has affective content. As a desire, hope is telic.<<ref "3">> It motivationally spurs us into pursuing the noble, the eternal, and/or [[The Good]], either directly or indirectly to [[adok]]. It is a pleasurable perception distorting bias or faith which makes particular features of the world appear salient. It is unclear if hope conceptually requires an anxiety resulting from lacking certainty, but it likely requires displeasure from lacking the desired state of affairs.<<ref "4">>

The sufficient conditions for hope are not clear. Hope may possibly be irrational by definition on some accounts. Paradoxically, it may be a requirement of rationality in some contexts, particularly in prudential epistemic justifications as opposed to alethic ones. Ironically, one can only hope that hope is not folly into [[infinigress]]. In a sense, one hopes that one no longer needs hope, [[irwartfrr]].

Hope, therefore, is concerned with pragmatically taking up axioms. Do so wisely! It must be a source and criterion of [[Trusting Trust]]. Taken to its logical consequences, committing a substantial axiom of hope will almost always radically alter one's [[Reality Map]].
