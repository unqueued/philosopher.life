!! Audit:

* Wisdom
* Sex
* Money
* Politics and power
* Keeping my enemies closer
* Plenty of waffling, but honest attempts to empathize with my future identity
* Tons of grammatical errors.
* This log forces me to contend with my ignorance very often.
* I enjoy my cheeky responses. I'm also pleased when I footnote my answers.
* This log appears to be becoming more like the rest of the wiki in general. But, it doesn't appear to have significant direct overlap with the other logs. The other core daily requirements are slowly merging into the same monster, but not this one. Why?
* Lots of Melisandre wishes, and you can tell I keep pushing towards grand views in purpose.
* Shortened title preferred, as usual.
* Have I mentioned how much I hate Sam-un-wise Gamgee?
* I'm clearly pissed off about my 3rd world education growing up.
* I enjoyed reading these as usual, but I have almost no comments to make. Ugh. I need to find a way to reason more effectively about these.
