Couple MF runs on the Necro, completely resorted all character stashes and shared stash. I also made a Druid and got him to NM A3. I tried melee route at first and was quite disappointed. I went elemental and came in my pants. His ability to take bosses is awful. He clears well though. Decrepify merc seems really strong here.
