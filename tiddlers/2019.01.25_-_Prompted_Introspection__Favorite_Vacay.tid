title: 2019.01.25 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Vacay

!! Tell about your favorite vacation experience.

I believe I've answered questions like this one before.<<ref "i">> I have a difficult time pinning one down. I can't say we had a ton of vacations. I appreciate several trips we took. One of my favorite aspects of vacations has been recognizing what matters in the world. I have traveled enough to stop caring so much about travel. I'd rather explore stories and digital worlds.

I think my favorite vacations have been with my wife. We took a trip to Jekyll Island and to Florida. What did I love about them? We fucked and ate like royalty. The beaches were pleasant. Hedonic pleasure and experience machines make the rest of life bearable. Of course, I know there are people who essentially live like slaves so that they can gamble for a week a year. They live most of their lives qua that 2%, and the justification looks poor.

Walking, talking, music, reading, writing, surfing, watching, arguing, fucking, listening, and telling ourselves the stories of our lives that matter most is what matters most (duh doy). I suppose the Libertarian isolationist hermitic dream is the vacay I want; I need a vacay from the species and my moral obligations (which ain't happening). The burnout is strong.
