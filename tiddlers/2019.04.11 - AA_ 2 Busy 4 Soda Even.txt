I read someone’s theory on boogers —maybe they are the super drug for our body put conveniently just above our mouths and green too. But we refuse to find out because they are considered icky!
THU 2:22 PM
Lol.
THU 2:22 PM
It's unfortunate that eating your boogers can actually be good for you.
THU 2:23 PM
I am not sure I believe that theory but it is an interesting pov...:thinking_face:

Aye. I have no idea if it's true.
THU 2:24 PM
