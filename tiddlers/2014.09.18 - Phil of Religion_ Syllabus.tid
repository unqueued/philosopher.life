Book: Philosophy of Religion: An Anthology. 6th ed. by Louis P. Pojman and Michael Rea


Course Description: Philosophy of Religion is a rigorous study of foundational topics and ideas of God, religion, and theology. It is crucial to study philosophy of religion because religious belief and spiritual experience are significant and widespread phenomena in human societies. This class will focus on traditional Western religious concepts and perspectives. We will carefully analyze and explicate significant and influential philosophical arguments focusing on the concepts, attributes, and existence of God.


Program & Learning Outcomes:

    Students become acquainted with a range of thinkers, topics, and approaches to philosophy.

    In both classroom discussion and written work, students should demonstrate the ability to analyze ideas and present them clearly, providing arguments and evidence for their claims.


Specific Course Outcomes:

    To become aware of and develop an appreciation for concepts in Western philosophy of religion.

    To discuss and think about the philosophical issues in the development of Western religious thought.


Course Requirements & Grading:

In-Class Participation (10%)

    Philosophy is not a passive endeavor. Students must attend and actively participate in class discussions. Students must offer pertinent comments and ask/answer relevant questions.

    Always bring a copy (either digital or print) of the day’s reading assignment(s) with you to class.


Discussion Board (20%)

    For every assigned reading, each student is required to write their own 150+ word post in the appropriate forum. You can either create a new thread (with a unique topic) or reply to one.

    Each post needs to do some sort of philosophical work. You could explain a problem with the argument. You could wrestle with different ways to interpret the argument. You could consider the implications of the argument. In any case, you need to clearly demonstrate that you’ve actually read and thought about the assignment. Please write formal, grammatically correct sentences.

    You can miss one discussion board post with no consequences. Stuff happens, so you get 1 freebie.


Midterm Exam/Paper (35%)

    Writing prompts will be posted two weeks in advance of the due date (to be announced later).

    You must submit both a print copy and a digital copy (used to check for plagiarism).

    Papers will be 5-6 pages, double-spaced, no added space between paragraphs, using size-12 font Times New Romans, with 1” margins, pagination, in .docx formatting. Both a Title page and Bibliography are required (these aren’t included in the 5-6 page count).


Final Exam/Paper (35%)

    Again, writing prompts will be posted two weeks in advance of the due date.

    You will only submit a digital copy, and it must be submitted by 5:00pm on December 15th.

    Same formatting requirements as the midterm exam/paper.

Lateness Policy: Unexcused late work will not be accepted. Unless excused, you will receive a failing grade on any forum posts or exams/papers which aren’t submitted on time.


Cheating & Plagiarism Policy: Plagiarism and cheating are obviously unacceptable. If I have evidence of either occurring, I will refer the case to the Honor Board. See: http://tulane.edu/college/code.cfm.


Office Hours & Contact: I encourage you to come to me with any questions you have related to the course material or your studies more generally. Please feel free to stop by or to schedule an appointment with me.
