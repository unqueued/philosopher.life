!! “Unwritten” Rules of Cosplay and Conventions

# Cosplay does not equal consent — don’t touch other people in any way (grab, huh, poke, whatever) without their permission first. It doesn’t matter if you follow them on social media or they’re dressed as your favorite character.
# Don’t bother people for pictures while they’re eating. They need breaks too.
# Listen to con staff and security. When you act like you’re above the rules, stuff gets shut down and you get kicked out.
# Don’t harass or mess with other people, even if you’re acting in-character. If you attempt to interact with someone for fun and they don’t respond, move on. They don’t have to play along if they don’t want to.
# Don’t block main walkways while talking or taking pictures. People will likely walk through you to get where they need to go anyways, so it’s best to avoid it altogether.
# ALWAYS get on the elevator if there is room, no matter the direction it’s heading, and prepare to cram together. We all gotta be somewhere and no one wants to stand around and wait for you.
# Know the rules of your convention center. Don’t bring a cosplay that’s against the rules and get mad when you’re escorted off the premises.
# On that note, know the rules of your hotel. If the hotel has quiet hours, respect them. More often than not, you are not the only guests at the hotel. If you want to be excessively loud, go hang out at the convention and not in your room.
# For the love of all humanity, SHOWER AND USE DEODORANT. We are all sweating, so if we can smell you then it’s extra bad.
