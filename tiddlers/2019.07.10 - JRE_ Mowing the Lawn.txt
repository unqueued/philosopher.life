Used up a bunch of fun uncle points to get the kids to mow the lawn.  Was funny how mad [[j3d1h]] got at me lol
JUL 10 1:03 PM
Rofl!
JUL 10 1:03 PM
That is awesome.
JUL 10 1:03 PM
Thank you for having them mow. They've never done it before.
JUL 10 1:03 PM
How was her reaction?
JUL 10 1:04 PM
Yep, that's why I did it, definitely wasn't faster or easier than doing it myself, since I walked with each of them and discussed how to fix little issues as they went along
JUL 10 1:04 PM
I bet [[1uxb0x]] enjoyed it more.
JUL 10 1:05 PM
We get along well for those kinds of things without much friction usually.
JUL 10 1:05 PM
Does your lawn look okay?
JUL 10 1:06 PM
[[1uxb0x]] was honestly too small to really do it, so he got very frustrated
JUL 10 1:07 PM
Ah. Yeah, that makes sense.
JUL 10 1:07 PM
And he wasn't overlapping, so when I would point out the slits of grass left over he felt cheated I think
JUL 10 1:08 PM
Kept saying "I don't see what I did wrong"
JUL 10 1:08 PM
Kept explaining, but he wasn't incorporating it
JUL 10 1:08 PM
But it felt like a good lesson in leverage and weight distribution
JUL 10 1:09 PM
And modeling
JUL 10 1:09 PM
So I just cleaned up after him
JUL 10 1:09 PM
[[j3d1h]] did better, but was much more rebellious about not wanting to do it.  She tried just turning it off and staring at me lol
JUL 10 1:10 PM
Rofl.
JUL 10 1:10 PM
I have seen that look before.
JUL 10 1:10 PM
Once she understood how to turn it, she stopped whining so much, she just didn't like sucking at it
JUL 10 1:10 PM
yup
JUL 10 1:11 PM
They keep voting on computer use, and thinking I should only get one vote.  It's kinda hilarious
JUL 10 1:11 PM
I keep asking if they try voting with you and how that normally works out haha
JUL 10 1:12 PM
Lol. My god. My children. I'm sorry.
JUL 10 1:12 PM
Nah, so far so good
JUL 10 1:12 PM
I am reminded of aunty [[AA]] trying to switch between being fun and being an authority figure and how jarring that felt
JUL 10 1:13 PM
Probably pretty annoying for them
JUL 10 1:13 PM
Also, its official, they said I look less fat than you :hugging_face::hugging_face:
JUL 10 1:14 PM
Hahaha
JUL 10 1:14 PM
Lol.
JUL 10 1:14 PM
I am round.
JUL 10 1:14 PM
[[AA]] said she might contact you all to head to a waterpark or something. I have no idea if they have swimming gear though.
JUL 10 1:16 PM
[[j3d1h]] only has dresses l ol
JUL 10 1:16 PM
She doesn't wear a lot of pants unless they are pajamas.
JUL 10 1:16 PM
Took them to a trampoline park so she had to wear some of [[1uxb0x]] shorts under her skirt
JUL 10 1:17 PM
Lol.
JUL 10 1:17 PM
Totally up to you guys.
JUL 10 1:18 PM
Had to wear Rebecca's shoes to mow
JUL 10 1:18 PM
She left her shoes in our vehicle.
