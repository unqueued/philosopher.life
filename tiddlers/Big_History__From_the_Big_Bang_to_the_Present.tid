title: Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present

My son and I are reading this book together. It's the best treatment I've ever seen. It's lucid, [[antipleonasmic]], simply written, beautifully linear, accurate (to my piss poor understanding), and absurd in its ambition. Maybe we need to hunt for a bunch of these books. A few big picture looks might go a very long way! 

So far, I wish the book was three times the size, but given the space she has, it's ridiculously packed. I'm only up to the evolution of animals so far, but it's delicious.

Reminds me of National Geopgraphic, BBC, and Discovery channel. It also has the IMAX and Carl Sagan thing going on. There is breathtaking [[awe]] up in here.

It doesn't push as hard as it should at the end, but it at least attempts to talk about capitalism (the tone is weird to me, but I'm a man who lacks tact and grace).

It's a simple book, but is has to be. It's oversimplifying everything. I'm not happy with the philosophers she chose, but I enjoy the science fiction she chose. It's almost irrelevant though.

The idea of what she has presented is what I expect every person to have encountered. It has taken me far too long to learn the contents of this book. I'm ridiculously excited for my children to read this.

The book is more optimistic than I am.
