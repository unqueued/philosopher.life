title: Sigmund Freud

What he was right about:

# There are unconscious processes (which include cognitive, emotional, and motivational processes) - we don't always know why we do what we do, and don't have conscious access to all the processing that goes on in the brain.
# There are competing processes in the brain - there is conflict between different motivations and thoughts and beliefs, and we have to navigate between what different parts of us want
# A lot of our personality and our ways of dealing with other people is shaped by childhood
# Our relationships with other people are shaped by our mental representations of those other people (which may not always be accurate, of course)
# That there is a succession of different developmental stages influenced by internal psychological conflicts (e.g., Freud's oral and anal stages).
