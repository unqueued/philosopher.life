"""
[12:35 PM] h0p3: /salute, hope your day is going well, sir. You planning for DnD tomorrow?
[12:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Howdy! Unfortunately I cancelled all DND indefinitely so I will not be. :’)
[12:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It mondo sucks but what can you do?
[12:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: How are you?
[2:04 PM] h0p3: :frowning:
[2:04 PM] h0p3: Fuck dude. I'm sorry. Playing by the social distancing rules hurts.
[2:04 PM] h0p3: You could set up an online session with folks (might not be the same for yall).
[2:05 PM] h0p3: I'm doing fine. Busy. Never enough hours in my day.
[2:05 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I know but I’m very intimidated by playing it online haha
[2:06 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It’s all good tbh. The break is nice but I’d never tell them that. :slight_smile:
[2:06 PM] Ardent_Assailant: [[L]] got Animal Crossing today so I’m certain our relationship is over forever. :joy:
[2:07 PM] h0p3: Lol
[2:08 PM] h0p3: Well, I hope the break from everyone will be a time for introspection and finding other moves to make.
[2:09 PM] h0p3: I'm hoping that your school scheduling in the fall will not be affected.
[2:10 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’m....concerned
[2:10 PM] Ardent_Assailant: But no news is good news. I’m going to proceed as planned
[2:10 PM] h0p3: That makes sense to me.
[2:11 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’m finishing the application Sunday. The only part that really concerns me atm is the testing. If everything is shut down how am I supposed to take the Praxis?
[2:11 PM] h0p3: Uugh
[2:11 PM] h0p3: Yeah
[2:12 PM] h0p3: I don't know. :frowning:
[2:12 PM] Ardent_Assailant: The completed application is due at the beginning of June so I’m going to try to schedule the test for late April-early May
[2:12 PM] h0p3: You have time still.
[2:12 PM] Ardent_Assailant: That’s a lot of time for the pandemic to improve.
[2:12 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yeah. :slight_smile:
[2:12 PM] Ardent_Assailant: There’s some wiggling as long as I keep an eye on things.
[2:13 PM] h0p3: And, if it comes down to it, you attempt to persuade them that you couldn't have done it, that they should give you a pass here.
[2:13 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Also- it’s possible they might just waive the test until things get better.
[2:13 PM] h0p3: yes
[2:13 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yeah that exactly!
[2:14 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Even though I’m worried, I still feel somewhat optimistic about it. It’s strange, but we’ll keep moving forward and take it all as it comes.
[2:14 PM] Ardent_Assailant: What are your plans for this weekend?
[2:16 PM] h0p3: We're trying to volunteer or aid folks. Pickup groceries, get them books, help parents homeschool who have little practice.
[2:17 PM] h0p3: [[Recent Obsessions]] is overflowing, and I have hundreds of tabs I need to attempt to categorize in [[Link Log]].
[2:17 PM] Ardent_Assailant: That’s incredibly kind of you all. :slight_smile:
[2:17 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Oooooo
[2:17 PM] h0p3: [[Family Time]] has been (and may continue to be) devoted to practicing reasoning about our time, scheduling, planning: https://philosopher.life/#TTP
[2:18 PM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#Maps has been a growing primary tab in my sidebar (and my family's). Nobody ever taught me how to do this, so I'm figuring it out with them as best I can.
[2:18 PM] h0p3: (growing up with my kids too)
[2:19 PM] h0p3: That's been a great deal of heavy lifting with my offspring, especially since they aren't used to standard scheduling that most children are used to inside of school systems.
[2:22 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Somehow I ended up fixated on your fitness routine lol. [[L]] and I bought ring fit for the Switch so we can exercise at home. It’s been a godsend for us.
[2:22 PM] Ardent_Assailant: With the pandemic and all
[2:23 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It’s always amazing to me to see the sheer magnitude of content added to your wiki every day. It’s incredible.
[2:42 PM] h0p3: I'm glad Ring fit has been doing good work for you. Exercise games are important.
[2:42 PM] h0p3: Hacks even.
[2:43 PM] h0p3: I play my wiki (and life in general) like a [[vidya]] [[game]]. I like grinding.
