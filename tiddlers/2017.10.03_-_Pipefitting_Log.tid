title: 2017.10.03 - Pipefitting Log

I bought a $60 Husky box similar to my other one. I took every tool and cleaned it, oiled it if necessary, organized it, and packed it away. I have a box with pipefitting + grinding tools plus some clamps and ratchet straps. It's an interesting box because some of the tools are just blocks of metal, and others are by far the most expensive tools in my possession. The other box now holds all my generalized tools, including several I couldn't bring with me on my last job. It's interesting to see how my tools continue to grow each job.
