title: 2019.07.13 - TDL: Talk With Them

* Family Time!
** They may not have done what we asked, but I'm happy to hear from them. I'm sure they've enjoyed their time away from us, lol.
** We'll try to keep it brief.
* Some kind of pasta sounds good.
* Letters would be.
* Sex would be outstanding.
** We need to walk no matter what though.
* Reading seems to be dropping off for now. I think I'm just going with the flow on this one for now. I've tried to fight it.
