title: 2018.07.27 - Wiki Review: It's Crystallizing

* [[Walkthrough: i3-layout-script]]
** Giant waste of time. I'm glad I moved onto doing it manually.
* [[2018.07.26 - JRE: Tired]]
** Edited.
* [[2018.07.26 - Carpe Diem: FTO]]
** Completed.
* [[2018.07.27 - Daily TDL: Push]]
** Edited. I have much to do.
* [[redpill]]
** Don't know why this didn't already exist.
* [[diamond]]
** Ditto.
* [[The Moral Law]]
** Ditto!!
* [[2018.07.26 - FTO: The Ride]]
** Edited. It's brief, but I need to have a place where I think about it. Perhaps that really should just be audits.
* [[FTO: Communication Templates]]
** This was a ghetto method to clean.
* [[2018.07.26 - Computers Musings: IRC]]
** I fear I didn't get much done.

** Not sure if this was necessary.
* [[Autistic Car Syndrome]]
** Ditto.
* [[Conceptual One-Way Friendships]]
** Dreams you go.
* [[Root Users]]
** They merit their own page.
* [[2018.07.26 - Link Log: Week Eternity]]
** I've done a poor job thus far, but understandably.
* [[2018.07.25 - Wiki Audit: Clean]]
** This is the maxim I acted on largely yesterday.
* [[Find The Others]]
** Damned fine work, sir.
* [[2018.07.26 - /b/]]
** Something to it.
* [[2018.07.25 - kickscondor: My Conversation with h0p3]]
** Will respond soon enough, I hope.
