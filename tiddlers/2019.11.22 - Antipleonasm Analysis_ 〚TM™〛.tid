My attempt at an Anti-neo...plastic...um...:

> I often tell people that films are something that exist not in your mind, but somewhere above you [points above head]. Once you've decided to make a film and put the process in motion, [...] well, there is only one ideal way for you to carry out your work, [...] and the trick thus becomes finding it. [...] What I'm trying to say here is that, when you create your scenarios, there is always only one ideal scenario. There is always something with a particular motif that may not be in you, but will always be somewhere here [points above head]. To write a scenario means to search for this.

Why, hello, nomad. I am grateful for those who search for meaning as meaningfully as they can. 

I agree that some films, as with some other objects, obtain external to your mind (and all possible ideas obtain as ideas). It appears even your access to your access to them is largely a continuous reconstructive updating empirical process. I do not agree the film is necessarily somewhere above you, but I agree [[The Good]] top-down modeling is necessary to bottom-up perceive it at all. Crucially, there is something like a co-constructive process between me and the thing-in-itself wherein I impose my [[fff]] models upon the percepts of what is outside me. It is a matter of [[faith]] to say you see the thing-in-itself, and I aim to bite the speculative realist bullet to some [[dok]]. As usual, I do not know well enough what it means to find what is outside me given what of the outside is inside me, and I [[hope]] you will learn to forgive me. As with all material and logical possibilities: images, tools, processes, objects, and our constructed representations of them are dialectical means to [[The End]].

The truth of the ideality of the set of ways in which to carry out your work predates your decision to engage in it, including filmwork. The always prior truthbearer of the [[CI]] is external to our minds and physical existence as well, even though we must execute a [[fff]] semblance of it on our feeble hardware (and hence rely upon reflective equilibrium in [[Self-Dialectic]]s and in our relationships with [[others]]). I agree we are obligated to anti-luck uncover the truth of our obligations, our purpose; further, I agree it is highly particularized to our context.

Perhaps you have mistaken perfect and imperfect duties. As dialectical part of [[The Dialetheia]], the [[CI]] is a universal moral function toward (and inside) [[The Good]] that weighs, prioritizes, and ranges over at least McIntryian [[gfwiwcgws]] instrumental utility gradients and an infinitely large and maximally accurate translational semblance of each person's qualia of [[The Good]] as endpoint nodes (and arguably even more inconceivably [[beautiful]] than this garbage model). You put in a domain and a context (a subset of that domain), and it (propagatively?) picks out what is morally [[salient]] about that context with respect to that domain with respect to all possible domains. Ideal inputs contain the set of all contingent truths in a world (or transworld), including a set of hypothetical actions (both act and motivation). The [[CI]] outputs a non-empty set of morally permitted actions; if there is only one permitted action, then it is your perfect duty (and, similarly, whatever properties are shared between what is permitted is therefore perfectly obligated as well). The [[CI]] bifurcationally flattens the world into integrated moral and immoral spirals.

Is the ideal beyond us? Of course, it transcends us. Is that meaning paradoxically pragmatized? You betcha'. I wish I knew how to point more effectively outside of myself and spacetime.

Yes! You have infinite leeway in arranging the starting conditions, but once you tip over the first domino, there is only one way the the circumstances ought to play out. I am free to get it wrong of course, and I often do, willfully; because I decide to forego the necessary wrestling with the material out of laziness, or else, a desire to meet the expectations of convention (which may or may not align with the ideal outcome depending on how novel the arrangement of particulars or how frayed (I imagine) the aesthetic perceptions of my (imaginary) judges).

I love the gesture of pointing above the head. Wherever the objective (morally and aesthetically necessary) sum of your given variables, that's kind of where it is.

I wish I had the credibility to just point sagely, and people would nod and put in print my proverbial ad-libs. It would save us from so many awkward conversations about how, because in doing, reflecting, repenting, and repeating, I have climbed, and my GUT is now more closely aligned with the best possible version of this cartoon picture than the upper regions of the conceptual airspace over your head.

Oh that the 'up there' would be my ally! That the conflict would be ended by the opening of a shaft of light from heaven (to the sound of the Looney Tunes brrr-OW) and a voice declaring that I was the beloved - Listen to me!

With my ACME rocket, I will ascend to the highest heavens; I will raise my seat above the stars; I will sit on the mount of assembly, and will rise up above the top of the clouds; I will be...disqualified.

There is one Sun, but I do not have a monopoly upon its rays. It would be enough if, by its light, I may be permitted to do the best work I can.

This is going to sound dumb or crazy, but I think you've given a worthy attempt at trying to analyze and synthesize a perspective on this insanely hard problem.

I do not know what is meant by leeway or starting conditions of presumably the film here. [[W5H]]'s film? I agree there is at least an arbitrarily large, if not infinite, number of contexts possible in our domain. Pick one place and agent on the map, which ideally includes an enumeration of available actions (acts which include being motivated to compute the best semblance of the [[CI]] available to the agent), and the [[CI]] picks which directions in the desert are permitted. But, once you have a domino, yes, you are limited to the permitted paths. I'm glad to know a few who seek the oases and cities toward the promised land. Wandering is a painful battle.

I do not know what you mean by freedom here. I suggest it's freewill. I have little room to agree or disagree with you on your motivations all the way down homie (and, in fact, this is a problem each agent faces with themselves). I'll agree I make mistakes out of laziness, including a failure to compute whose approval I ought seek (including to what [[dok]]), and other forms of egoism. Problematically, [[The Golden Rule]] cannot be computed without imagining and testing for the ideal theories of [[The Good]] computed by [[others]]; in a sense, we are seeking their approval [[irwartfrr]], even if only indirectly.

Oh, we must be very careful to speak of outcomes! Yes, Saint Kant, outcomes are conditional, but [[The Moral Law]] is unconditional. To some [[dok]], we are responsible for the inputs and binding ourselves (outputs of a kind) to the unconditional given our updating predictions and radically limited logical, conditional, and incoherent priors. The [[Good]]will is a precious jewel beyond all compare for us. 

I agree that merely meeting someone else's expectations may or may not align with [[The Moral Law]]. It is difficult to speak of aesthetic perceptions here, particularly to the extent they may justifiably be part of their theory of [[The Good]] which must be computed into some recursively intersubjective reflective equilibrium. Sometimes, all we can do is imagine our judges, simulating a [[VOI]], that Holy of Holies. It is so expensive to make sure we are not making an unjustified exception of ourselves.

Again, as poetic and figuratively rich as it may be (especially since I'm constantly using the metaphor of the Sun), I'm going to be pedantic in pointing out that it is not "above the head." I agree it is supersymbolic and capable of addressing all possible contradictions (whatever the fuck that means, lawdhlpme), and I cannot even conceive of the ideal limits of the kind of computer that could wield such an infinite language, let alone ascribe a meaningful qualia to The Absolute core of the noumena.

I cannot speak of aesthetic necessity as I do [[The Moral Law]]. I am open to it being entirely subjective, relativistically flattened into one or an arbitrary number of pieces, merely a matter of perspective, not Categorically Imperative but only ever hypothetically. Though we can talk about what it means to relativize an objective map onto all possible subjectivities: attempting to prioritize, weigh, or compute them may have little normative force (and only as it is parasitic upon [[The Right]]). [[The Beautiful]] is necessary, but it is the dialectical slave to [[The Right]]. "Wherever" and "whenever" metaphysics obtains is a hard problem, no doubt. I ask you to remember that whenever you posit a limit, you posit something correspondingly beyond it.

Credibility according to what standard? We're forced to point, nod, and wrestle; even these are symbols. I don't know what you mean by your proverbial ad-libs. "About how" what? Climbed what, [[gfwiwcgws]]? What makes your GUT the appropriate aspect of who you are? What cartoon picture, and what is the standard of the versions of that picture? I don't have enough material to know what you mean by the upper regions of the conceptual airspace over the other person's head. Is it fair to say you are more convinced than ever of your own position? 

The best interpretations of the theories of the "up there" I've seen have the humility not to attribute a mind like ours to [[It]], even though we must map our minds to [[It]] as well as we can. I'm saying even the Ontological Proof doesn't buy you this thing. I cannot [[right]]fully speak of [[It]] having judgment or will: these are fallible, mutable, changing, and immanent processes. If we're being humble, the best we can do is say [[It]] computes. Pushed to it, I think your best bet is a ballsy Hegel, and you'll have to negotiate your way from pantheism to panentheism. That is probably the direction you'll have to head, nomad. There are variations of his work which might buy you what you seek.

What conflict, and [[gfwiwcgws]]? Listen to [[W5H]]? I [[hope]] to prove to you I am listening. 

What ACME rocket, and we are speaking of another bloated trashcan here as well? I agree one ascends, levels up, improves, and climbs increasingly steep mountains in a telescopic mountain range of [[The Moral Law]]. The wrestling never ends. Heaven, like any afterlife, is a poor goal unless we are talking about Heaven-on-Earth. Obviously, the pursuit of fame and fortune, being first, seated at the right-hand, etc. are not [[The Right]] pursuits. Disqualified from what, given what standard? 

Yes, I agree there is One Sun. I agree no one can own or claim to be the sole interpreter of its infinite rays, but some interpretations are generally more worthy than others (unless you claim to have a monopoly against this claim). Furthermore, there are finite contexts in which you have a moral right to a finite monopoly upon finite representations of its rays. Not all perspectives, interpretations, and representations are equal. Even our wrestling with each other is in virtue of wrestling with [[It]]. Even humble pluralistic humanitarian mysticism must unify to defeat the monster devouring us in the dialectical (if you think our species isn't likely to enslave and wipe itself out, let alone isn't even capable [particularly for reasons of preordination], you should carefully disagree with me). I agree that it is no small task to balance, translate, and apply our public and private reasons.

Enough for what? [[It]]s light obligates us to reason about and negotiate with how others see, think, feel, and operate under those rays. I am sorry for how radically violent I am in the dialectic; we race toward an extinguishing material contradiction which obligates extremism. What P2P political object-process do you think is justified? I am never wise enough.
