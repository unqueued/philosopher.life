*** I've seen it first hand a number of times. 4chan knows what it do. Clearly, this can be weaponized. We are in for some terrifying virtual wars. 
**** Botnets only become more and more valuable over time. Looking authentic is so hard to pull off.

*** Anything done in the name of "protecting our children" must be scrutinized. These are weasel words and powerplays that prey upon your amygdala in far too many contexts. Don't you see what this really is?

*** Okay. I hate the DNC, but I would rim out Warren for days. We might not agree, but she deserves some hardcore rimjobs, chocolates, and even my respect.

*** Sadly, Colbert name drops but doesn't even begin to explain what socialism is...he talks about wealth inequality (good!), but nebulously (insidiously) explains little else.

*** Safe for now?

*** Of course, I still can not define it well. I can resort to Hohfeldian analysis, but nobody wants to go there with me (only Libertarians and Socialists seems to get it), not even my wife apparently.
** http://trackrecord.net/chris-browns-name-has-apparently-been-edited-out-of-a-3-1819711002
*** This is becoming more and more common. TBS might speed up there shit, and there are advertisement replacements, but this is literally re-writing. I feel dejavu surrealism into 1984 territory here.

** http://thehill.com/policy/technology/358025-thousands-attended-protest-organized-by-russians-on-facebook
*** Power grabs everywhere here. Watch our governments use this to lock their own people down...for the children, etc.
** https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16592338/eric-schmidt-google-ai-competition-us-china
*** I'm extremely hard-pressed to find examples of Chinese software that I value. 
**** The innovations tend to be small or focused around a level of centralized control that I'm unwilling to accept. They are definitely incredibly talented, but I still see a copycat nation. I may be wrong.
