*** However, they attempt to let UX designers off the hook, not placing the blame on them as much as possible. This is ridiculous. You do have a choice, designers. Yes, you will have a harder time making a living when you do it morally. Yes, others will do what is immoral even when you don't. No, that doesn't mean you aren't morally culpable for what you build. This is some serious bullshit. I suspect the sponsor of the content is pulling a sleight of hand here.

*** I've seen opposing evidence. Not everything is wrong here though.
** https://web.archive.org/web/20110926042256/http://raikoth.net/consequentialism.html
*** 0.3: Why?
**** Wowsers. That is some outstanding ignorance. Moral intuitionism actually takes you away from utility quite often when you look at how our brain lights up in fMRI machines.
*** 0.4: And who cares?
**** Also a terrible argument. That we feel the urge, desire, or anything doesn't mean we actually care about being moral. This is confabulation. You need a more potent argument to demonstrate that people are moral or good.
*** 0.5: Is this FAQ exhaustive?
**** You should hedge more than you have.
*** 1.1: What does it mean to search for moral rules?
**** You provide no justification for the claim that: "Searching for moral rules means searching for principles that correctly describe and justify enough of our existing moral intuition that we feel confident applying them to decide edge cases."
***** This is a key problem in metaethics, and you don't get to just help yourself to it at this level.
**** "For example, even if we don't have a formal theory of morality we know that killing an innocent person for no reason is morally wrong."
***** You've falsely assumed that experts on the matter truly agree to this, and it's not "nearly everyone" when you start reaching towards the people who understand the problem the best.
**** "To search for moral rules means to come up with a more formalized method of translating moral intutions into moral rules and applying those rules to edge cases, one which is clearly correct and which cannot be countered by an equal and opposite method of applying moral rules to edge cases."
***** Intuitionism is a plight and a quagmire. You need to think about Kant more than you have.
***  1.2: Why care about moral intuitions?
**** That's not a sufficient argument, although I appreciate it. I'd like to know what you think doesn't count as an intuition.
*** 1.3: Can we just accept all of our moral intuitions as given?
**** Ah, reflective equilbrium, and nothing beneath it? You're going the Neo-Kantian route.
*** 1.4: Why bother to reflect on our moral intuitions and achieve equibrium?
**** Lol. Yeah. So, if it isn't mine, then what argument do you have again?
*** 2.1: What does it mean to say that morality lives in the world?
**** I'm afraid you don't know what that means. You're ignorantly generalizing here. More problematically, you are in no position to posit consequentialist reasoning as defeating other approaches with an argument like this.
*** 2.2: Why?
**** I'm sorry, this does not fit my very seasoned intuitions on the topic. I actually think you've relativized morality into meaninglessness. More problematically, I deny the logical possibility of the Heartstone. It is definitionally irrational. This is not a counterexample because it begs absurdity in its premises. Alright. I've had enough of your shitty argument. If this really is based on Less Wrong, I'm going to be quite disappointed.

** https://www.wikitribune.com/story/2018/03/28/united_states/ending-gerrymandering-could-mean-greater-corporate-influence-in-elections/55678/
*** Umm...gerrymandering is the result of corporate influence monopolizing the process so effectively that it no longer requires investment. 
** https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-28/study-of-politics-and-analytical-thinking-puts-libertarians-on-top
*** Ah, ah, ah...You are a fool for believing Intelligence == Wisdom. Wisdom is a particular kind of intelligence, and I suggest that self-interest will often cause intelligent people to be economically conservative (libertarian, i.e. not giving a shit about the rest of humanity). A libertarian society favours smart people, thus without the desire to be moral and just, this causes smart people to lean libertarian. I also think analytic reasoning is often associated with quantitative reasoning, which is not the full scope of being analytical in my eyes.
** https://washingtonmonthly.com/2018/03/22/bernies-russia-problem/
*** No sir, I was watching the whole time. I knew. Much of the "news" are things I had seen the whispers and behaviors of realtime. I suggest this is an attempt to empower neoliberals and the establishment.
