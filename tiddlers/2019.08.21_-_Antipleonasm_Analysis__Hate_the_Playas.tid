The idea of saviors has been built into the entire culture, beyond politics. We have learned to look to stars, leaders, experts in every field, thus surrending our own strength, demeaning our own ability obliterating our own selves. But from the time to time Americans reject that idea and rebel.

These rebellions, so far, have been contained. The American system is the most ingenious system of control in world history. With a country so rich in natural resources, talent, and labor power the system can afford to distribute just enough wealth to just enough people to limit discontent to a troublesome minority. It is a country so powerful, so big, so pleasing to so many of its citizens that it can afford to give a freedom of dissent to the small number who are not pleased.

There is no system of control with more openings, apertures, let leeways, flexibilities, rewards for the chosen, winning tickets in lotteries. There is none that disperses its control, more from complexly through the voting system, the work situation, the church, the family, the school, the mass media - none more successful mollifying opposition with reforms, isolating people for one another, creating patriotic loyalty.

1% of the nation owns a third of the wealth. The rest of the wealth is distributed in such a way as to turn those in the 99% against one another: small property owners against the propertyless, black against white, native-born against the foreign-born, intellectuals and professionals against the uneducated and unskilled. These groups have resented one another and warred against one another such vehemence and violence as yo obscure their common position as sharers of the leftovers in a very wealthy country.

Authority is a hard problem. It is often my obligation to cede to someone who has justified signals of epistemic authority in particular domains and contexts. But, we must all account for each other. Price-efficiently constructing and leveraging verified and stable trust in our relationships is an explosive technical and game-theoretic problem; few escape just talking about different variations of psychological egoism on different interpretations of what counts as rational self-interest (it's what I see studied 99% of the time). [[TOP]] is the only out I see; I cannot deny a reconception of Plato's vision.

I know Libertarians who take the second paragraph to be a form of blackmail, a cost of doing business in controlling others, the self-hating poor political conservatives who must virtue signal to maintain some sense of self must convince themselves to be outraged that such a thing must occur (why can't more unjustified slaves be like them?). [[Saint Chomsky]] is famous for this analysis too. Dissent and rebellion appear much easier to quell in a digital world so profoundly centralized that pushing a few buttons and automated analysis might shape [[The Great Human Conversation]], steering it away from enabling collective consciousness. It is possible for each of us to choose to increasingly own our share of the process, but my [[hope]] is thin. It's tragic.

I resent the [[power]]ful and their reactionaries in almost all cases. I'm a masturbatory hater.
