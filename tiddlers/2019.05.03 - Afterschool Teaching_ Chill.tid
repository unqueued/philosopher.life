title: 2019.05.03 - Afterschool Teaching: Chill

No homework for anyone. I wandered and CCed, then I took almost everyone to the lab. 

A few ended up playing clicker games, and we talked about automating them.

Today was fairly relaxed. We listened to music, and some folks sang along. There was no gym. It was library or lab today (noice).

My namesake and I had a significant discussion about rule-following, literality, and various kinds of competing normative systems. A high schooler translated some things I'm not going to say out loud for her. She wants to surf google, and I'm not going to stop her. 

I also had significant discussions with people using their phones and using their earbuds. I'm encouraging them to hide it well.

Mitchell and I had a long conversation. We walked through politics and economics of sports in schools (having coached around the region, he knew quite a bit). I complimented him on being an exception to the Peter Principle and interrogated him on his choices to be an admin. Family life is the deal. He said I should hunt around for schools that would take my transcripts and maybe a test to just hand me certification, though it may be unlikely.
