title: Nietzsche

You can't begin to know how much I despise the fact that I think that Hume, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, and a host of skeptics and cynics happened to be right on so many important things. 

Nietzsche was right about the world losing its God, as a successful, believed meme virus in the human race. He made an astute sociological observation about what many humans would do when they lost their religion. This is similar to sociological observations abut what happened when people gained religion. This is because religion is a subset of morality; in addition to an assumptive set of facts about metaphysics, it's a specific set of moral questions about how we should think, who we should be, and what would do.
