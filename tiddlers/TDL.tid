!! About:

//Habits of Highly Effective Ejaculators. Planning your life is one of the unique joys of autonomy. Don't let life merely happen to you. Turn failure into success. Minmax your character, h0p3.//

Here I budget my time and plan for the future, even if only one timeslice at a time. These are planned opportunities to plan the grind of the computational game of my life. These are practical {[[Dreams]]}. Just get started.

I cannot help but feel embarrassed by this directory. I know it shows my flaws so clearly. I am autistic, and my executive functioning is dysfunctional in ways that are not easy to debug and tease apart. I do not wield my excuse as an autonomy-defeater; I'm  pointing out how difficult it is for me to be well-integrated. 

I must tame myself with this log and overcome the dread of empathizing with my persistent identity. I have to earn it! Thus, here I climb Mount Habit. This is a way to make sure I just //get it done//.

Clearly, I engage in basic legislative practices in this log. Writing it down enables me to hold myself self-accountable. Essentially, this is a thin internal power dynamics tool which provides checks and balances on the executive branch ruling over my elastic city-state identity.

!! Principles:

* TDL<<ref "dr">> := ''T''o-''D''o-''L''ist
* Rule/Step Zero on To-Do-List: Write your TDL Log
* Write simple, quantifiable, tangible lists.
* Be honest, make sure you don't expect too much or too little of yourself.
* Try to write your To-Do-List for the next day before you go to sleep.<<ref "s">>
* Work on least fun to most fun when possible. Do the hardest lifting first, and as your emotional muscles weaken, your tasks get easier and easier. 
* Don't expect yourself to complete everything. You aren't perfect. Prioritize and triage.
** Eventually, you'll acquire the skill of knowing what you can expect of yourself and improve from there.
** Don't forget to post-mortem via your [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum Logs]] and [[Wiki Review Log]]
* Maintain To-Do-List logs for different time-slices.
** Daily
** Weekly
** Monthly
*** This log's monthly audit can be used for the audit. I don't think I need to [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum Logs]] this one.
** Keep a [[Standing TDL]] in [[Pin]]

!! Dreams:

* Make this more thoroughly integrated into {[[Dreams]]}.
* Find a way to formally engage in long-term kinds of To-Do-List planning.
* Find an intelligent way to form To-Do-Lists for multiple contexts.
* Find a way to create "To-Stop-Lists." In a sense, part of what narrowing down what to do is through selecting what you will not do. Understand your opportunity costs.
