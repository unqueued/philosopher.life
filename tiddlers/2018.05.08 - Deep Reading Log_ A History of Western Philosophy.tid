Trashtalks Nietzsche hard, reasonably so. I think this is the line I've been given. I hate to admit, but even the charitable interpretation can't escape this issue. Russell is correct.

The Romantics get wrecked, except Hegel. Russell clearly has a profound respect (even with disagreement) for Hegel, as he should.

I may be an idealist like Hegel. It's hard to tell.
