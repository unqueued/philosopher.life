title: 2017.11.02 - Retired: Wiki: Existential Axioms and Fundamental Principles

//Holy shit! This is the most obvious direct seed of my {[[Axioms]]}. This is a [[Relic]] I hold in very high regard. How many projects evolve to become a [[Root]]ed directory? This might be the only one. This wiki is so messy, but this has been a profound [[Diamond]] that I sifted for and eventually sublated the old {[[Principles]]} with. Noicely done, mate!//

** Don't let your flame die out. Protect it. 

* [[Be Happy!]]
** Engage in the science of becoming happy.
*** Be utilitarian. Be rational.
** Train yourself to be a [[eudaimonic lifehacker]]. 
** Be the correct, worthy, rational, and self-accepting version of Jesus' Kantian Man. Tame Kant's whimsy, habituate him, teach him utilitarian virtue. Discipline yourself and be stoic. See the world for what it is, and understand your place in it. Accept your station, reasons to live, and do your best in life. 
** When it comes to life: lick the spoon, suck out the marrow, and squeeze out every drop of happiness you can. 
*** Be cozy, appreciate small blessings, etc. 
*** Seize the day
*** Attend to the right objects with your ray of intentionality in a patterned way.
** Take calculated risks. them
*** Success requires failing in the right ways for the right reasons, etc.
*** Perfectionists tend not to take enough risks. Thus, you should take more risks. Fail more often. Just do it. You'll get hurt sometimes, but it's worth it in the end. Succeed at the Marshmallow Test of Life: promote effective executive functioning.

** Use the [[Slowmind]] and [[Fastmind]] in the right ways, at the right time, and so on. i.e. Be excellent. Be virtuous at a practice. What practice? The practice of making myself happy, of becoming eudaimonic. Be moral in the right way, be the right kind of renaissance man, be a eudaimonic lifehacker, etc..

* [[Have a Good Attitude]]
** Be happy while being moral (good luck!).
** Balance yourself through reason.
