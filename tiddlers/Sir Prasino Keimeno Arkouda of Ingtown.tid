!! About:

//Πράσινο κείμενο Αρκούδα. I honestly don't know if "ington" is cranberry-morphemological.//

<<<
Humankind cannot ''bear'' very much reality.

-- T.S. Eliot, //The Four Quartets//
<<<

<<<
Art renders the sight of life ''bear''able by laying over it the gauze of impure thinking. 

-- Friedrich Nietzsche, //Human, All Too Human//
<<<

<<<
''Bears'' are made of the same dust as we, and breathe the same winds and drink of the same waters. A ''bear'''s days are warmed by the same sun, his dwellings are overdomed by the same blue sky, and his life turns and ebbs with heart-pulsings like ours, and was poured from the same First Fountain. And whether he at last goes to our stingy heaven or no, he has terrestrial immortality. His life not long, not short, knows no beginning, no ending. 

-- John Muir

This tryhard character is un''bear''able. Like a cranberry morpheme, his life's meaning is opaque to the present speakers of the language. He puns and maymays like his life depends on the ''bare'' irony; he's deeply worried that life is meaninglessly inauthentic if it's not cleverly or painfully recycled. He is profoundly flawed character desperately aiming to pass into that good night as a good knight. He can't ''bear'' the thought of the suffering of others. He's also a hirsute, shenaniganical, charismatic, ''berry''-loving "anthrope."<<ref "c">>

!! Principles:

* Build-a-bear in a human world
* Get weird with it. Make a story!
* Over-the-top Deadpool the everliving shit out of this game.
* The very notions of "bear" in [[The Great Human Conversation]] should play an overt role in how he is defined and played.

!! Focus:

* Sources of Meaning, Narrative, & Playstyle
** https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/2179ea/sir_bearington/
** https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext+gametales
** [[Sir Bearington Concepts]]
** [[Hilarious DND Junkpile]]

* Hear my plea, o' DM:
** He's invisible when nobody is looking at him.
** Breaks the 4th wall exclusively when he crits and fumbles. During these divine interventions, he speaks in character to the actual players of the game. According to DM fiat, he can hear them in the game.
*** Probably needs to tell the players a bear joke or pun.
*** Maybe his wife will make him a sammich too?

* Meeting DM Requirements
** Joined the hunting guild, The Defiance
*** I hunt when it is morally required. I refuse to hunt when it isn't morally acceptable. I have a profound moral compass.
*** A bear's gotta eat, and hunting is not conceptually immoral. There are cases where it is wrong though.

** How the Fuck is this Bear so Human?
*** Bear Druid
**** If humans can do it, why not bears? That shit is racist, yo. I've learned to speak human as a beardruid just like humandruids learn to speak bear.
***** Since animals do have their own languages even amongst the same species, and human druids seem to be able to magically speak all dialects and languages for that species, I think it is possible I might have the same abilities with humans.
*** The elder Anthropomorphized //Took// Bear was special, profoundly awoken by middlearth evolution and druids. I am in his lineage. My Grandpappy, Sir Bearington from 1.5editions ago, taught me the way of bearidic tri-force. I'm part of his genetic lineage and memetic heritage.
**** Relatives: [[Famous Bears]]
**** If I have a pet, it is named "Los Tiburon"
*** If anyone questions my bearness, I tell them I'm a human druid stuck in bear form.
*** On of my fundamental goals is to become a good enough druid to actually take on humanform.

* Behavioral Sketch
** Speech
*** [[Cranberry Morphemes]]
*** [[Groaning Growly Bear Puns]]
*** [[Bear Jokes to Drive Me Wild]]
*** [[Bear With My Idioms]]
*** [[Family Memes]]
*** Assuming he recognizes it, hearing someone else speak a /ber/ phoneme automatically causes him to emote a quiet "coughgrowl"
**** Constantly unbinding and corrupting cranberry-like morphemes, otherwise inserting them whole into conversation. 
***** Tourette's syndrome oddly causes him to attach "ington" suffixes to any person's name. 
***** He's embarassingly self-aware of that verbal tick.
*** Adores ~~pig~~ human latin
*** Talks about losing //The Game//, from time to time.
*** Constantly hum-growling that catchy tune.
**** His password is: dQw4w9WgXcQ
*** Catchphrases:
**** "You do you, Yogi."
**** "That's fur-sure"
**** "Runna Runna" (waka waka)
**** Shitty-Russian-Accent: "Some day you get bear; some day bear get you."

** Physical
*** Gives people lots of "human" hugs.
*** Sleeps much better with his "Eddy Human,"<<ref "e">> who is extra warm and fuzzy.
*** Yearns for a fizzy brew made from Grylled Cola plant
*** Aspires to fangerpaint in order to capture those Kodiak moments which matter to him.
*** Loves "Human Music" (doop boop)<<ref "d">>

* Motivational Sketch
** Moral-Lawful Good Alignment
** Dinkin Flickas Hyperreality Going Mach 5
** Terryology, the systematic belief that 1x1=2.
** Believes his midichlorian count is Over9k.
** Misses his friends Little Bear and Franklin the Turtle
** Supports the right to human legs.
** Aims to degrumpify himself.
** Scared of traps
