title: 2018.07.25 -- Wiki Review: Dot Config

* [[.config/terminator/plugins/cluster_connect_config/config.json]]
** Seems easy enough.
* [[.config/terminator/plugins/cluster_connect.py]]
** I'm not using this yet, but I want to have this set since I think this is one of the profound strengths of Terminator.
* [[.config/terminator/plugins/LayoutManager.py]]
** So, you can save them within Terminator itself (which is probably worth it), but I really do prefer the ability to click.
** This is weird, since I'm ricing my mouse instead of just my keyboard. I think that's a good thing though.
* [[.config/terminator/plugins/open_any_file_plugin.py]]
** I think zsh is going to do this for me too. I'm interested to see what this does on the terminal emulator end of things.
* [[.config/terminator/config]]
** I ended up just customizing my own.
* [[2018.07.24 -- Wiki Audit: m10 rework]]
** Jesus. Yeah, it desperately needs a new gameplan.
* [[2018.07.24 -- Prompted Introspection: Scary Dream]]
** Life is short.
* [[about:config]]
** I need to collect more of this. I do this all the time.
* [[Firefox]]
** This will need a revamp. Tons of content goes in here.
* [[/etc/environment]]
** Not so useful, from what I can tell.
* [[2018.07.24 -- Computers Musings: PSYCH!]]
** Renamed, Cataloged.
* [[Terminator]]
** There are far more hotkeys. I'll leave it alone for now.
* [[Leet Tools]]
** Hope to flesh this out today.
* [[i3]]
** Love my pep talk.
* [[2018.07.24 -- Self-Dialectic: Fu]]
** Jazz
* [[2018.07.24 -- Wiki Review: i3]]
** Well, I made a big dent, not just a scratch, yesterday. I hope to do the same today.
* [[2018.07.24 -- Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos]]
** After we hit his theory, I'm beginning to be disappointed again.
* [[2018.07.24 -- Carpe Diem: i3 Grind]]
** Completed
* [[2018.07.25 -- Daily TDL: It's Working]]
** I'm carrying over the old stuff....bad habit?
