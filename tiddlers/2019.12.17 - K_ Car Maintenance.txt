Pretty good. Got an oil change. Gonna get new tires on Friday. :)

How are you?
Dec 17, 2019 3:59pm
Oh I baked cookies too
Dec 17, 2019 3:59pm
Waiting on the tires until we get up, but the same. Fluids changed.
Dec 17, 2019 3:59pm
Cookies sound good.

I'm doing well. We're packing up and what not. Lots of workers came into the house to change stuff out (right when we are about to leave, lol).

Our guy was weird about the tires. He said they didnâ€™t have them and needed a few more days lol.
Dec 17, 2019 4:00pm
Sounds about right. ðŸ˜‚

At least they wonâ€™t come down on you guys for things that are broken.
Dec 17, 2019 4:00pm
They probably will. Speaking with the office, the pricing for fixing stuff from the deposit is way off. They aim to nickel and dime. Nationally owned (3rd set of owners since we've been here).

It might be up to the maintenance crew though (hopefully, they won't be so harsh...we usually get along well enough).
Dec 18, 2019 2:57pm
How's your day going, btw?
Dec 18, 2019 2:58pm
Assholes. I hate that for you guys. It sucks. Yeah maintenance is usually really cool. From what Iâ€™ve seen theyâ€™ll usually just quietly fix things or go about it in a way that you guys can avoid a lot of those issues.

We are good. Taking it easy today. I have a session I need to prep for but Iâ€™m playing Persona instead haha
Dec 18, 2019 3:01pm
Noice. Glad you have some chill time.
Dec 18, 2019 3:02pm
Me too. Itâ€™s been needed for so long... lol
