title: Cults

//Hush child, pyramid-scheme cultures, including Capitalism and Star Trek cons, just are dem blindly evil cults yo' momma warned ya'bout. Openly and ironically own your crazy.<<ref "o">> All hail [[The Good]]! I'm, like, a lvl eleventy wiz LFG, right? My homeless beard is an unmistakable sign of my piety, and my circumcised stamper is a mark of my chosenness.<<ref "t">> Furthermore, if you aren't with me or useful to me, then surely you must be evil and deserve shunning + exploitation. Cult is such a vivid word to wield. Abusive New Age Religions, The Occultic Con, Theosophic Crypto-bridgesellers, Sneering Gnostic Monocultures, Immoral Consensus Reinforcement Sects, etc., I can't tell you the difference between religions and cults,<<ref "x">> but I've discovered some iPads and Android tablets upon which were  scribbled teh lawd's commandment that all your cargo are belong to us. Most charitably, cults are outcast microcultures or followings ignored or smeared by mainstream dialectical bodies. Unadulterated empathy is extremely expensive. Please tell me, does the shoe fittingly pass your unbiased purity smell test?//

* The leaders, prophets, and apostles have the sole unreplicable vision of the transcendental dimension. By divine right, these unelected spiritual conduits deceptively claim to have the only credible knowledge of the unknown, viciously interpret or name that which cannot be named by definition, and construct organizations or followings in which they are the ultimate, infallible, unquestionable authorities, beneficiaries, or sublators.
;
* Increased loyalty, volunteered dependence upon, and submission to centralized power is incestuously rewarded with validation, further inclusion, additional responsibilities, and status within the group.
;
* The group is intolerant of democratic dialogue, critical inquiry, autonomous logical reasoning, and openly wrestling with cognitive dissonance. They suppress skepticism while brainwashing and indoctrinating victims with immoral dogma through intimidation, heart-felt sophistry, and isolation.
;
* The group enslaves the vulnerable, expels those who do not submit to abuse, forbids association with those deemed untouchable, unjustifiably delegitimizes former members, and vilifies all possible critics.
;
* The group is irrationally paranoid about the outside world, impending apocalypses, and conspiracy theories. They hold delusional persecution complexes or grudges, and maintain unjustified elitist outgrouping.<<ref "b">>
;
* Memetic, material, or social disclosure, transparency, independent audits, and accountability are minimized, prevented, or dismissed.
;
* The group engages in hollow programmatic social performances, exploit overactive imaginations and flawed pattern-recognition through counterfeits and placebos, require special appearance or garb given one's assigned role, bestow meaningless blessings upon approval-seekers or exploitees, deceptively recruit, read and comment upon dishonorable scriptures,<<ref "h">> chant evil liturgy, orgiastically dance into madness, conduct unholy salvific rites, spellcast curses, honor the dead at the expense of the living, divine and gamble the future, sacrifice unblemished lambs and drink the blood of children in the pursuit of transhumanist immortality, transubstantiate with illicit substances, unconscionably dissolve the boundaries between roleplaying and reality, transfigure into demons, and dark-triadically virtue signal.
