title: 2018.09.05 -- Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Imho, this is where the series actually takes off. The political structures which give rise to the power of dark-triads is revealed more thoroughly. The Dementors are powerful figures.

I do not understand how more wasn't done to protect HP's rights to learn magic. I don't understand how he isn't just flat out saved or emancipated. It's a device.

I wonder which books of mine would be most likely to bite me. There are several poetry books in our house that probably want to destroy my mind. Good thing I'm too illiterate to touch that shit. =)

Rowling knows how to depict cartoonish people that I truly fucking hate with all my heart. Bless you, grill.

I feel stranded in the dark muggle world too...lol.

The distinction between social conventions (including juridical law) and moral law is wonderfully evident in this series. I'm forever grateful to that clarity being there from a young age. 

You know, these books really did make me feel less alone, more alive, etc.

I love how Black, a man we are supposed to initially hate and fear, turns out to be a victim that we empathize with. He's a different character, no doubt. Of course, black has the usual symbolic connotations. 

"Might makes right" in the magic world in a hardcore way. It's almost meritocratic in many cases.

Huge fan of Specters of all kinds in my games. I am a classic Necromancer or Monk though. =) Also, fuck druids.

Schools become literal prisons.

Trelawney drives me nuts, of course.

I love Hagrid's empathic affinity for animals, even though I don't care to be around most animals.

I love how drinking is normalized in this series.

Lupin reminds me of James Wilson in House, kind of.
