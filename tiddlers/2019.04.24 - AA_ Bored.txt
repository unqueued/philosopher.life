I've been recommended a book, if you want to read it with me: "How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy"

I'm doing well. Reading and Writing, working with the kiddos.

Nice! We have testing this week...a room full of 9th grade boy silliness
WED 10:29 AM
I hope testing goes easier for you. I usually enjoy proctoring. I get to read a book, lol.
WED 10:36 AM
Not that you've had any freetime, but what have you been doing for fun lately?
WED 10:43 AM
Also, how was the formal? Did [[AG]] have a good time?
WED 10:43 AM
It’s actually kind of boring but you are right —I should get a good book!
WED 11:17 AM
Today I did next week’s lesson plans and yesterday I caught up on grading
WED 11:18 AM
Not much fun —working but also not as busy as last week so more rested
WED 11:18 AM
I can send you one right now (reading over the phone isn't ideal, I realize). If you want, what would you like (if you brought earbuds, I can get you an audio book instead).
WED 11:18 AM
Hoping to work on [[AG]]’s room this week
WED 11:19 AM
I'm glad you aren't as busy. A cooldown sounds like a good idea.
WED 11:19 AM
She's going to adore it.
WED 11:19 AM
I read often on my phone so it’s no big deal
WED 11:19 AM
I need to get wireless earbuds or find my dongle
WED 11:20 AM
[[AG]] had a great time :blush:
