title: 2019.08.09 - Prompted Introspection: Courage

!! What do you think courage means?

In each particularized context, courage is a golden mean sitting on a spectrum between two vices, an excess being recklessness (or take your pick of synonyms) and a deficiency being cowardice. Since the virtues are unified, courage logically implies every virtue, though there are some cases in which its expression is more obvious and direct than others. I consider it to be one of the most straightforward aspects of this [[gem]] simply because it's about taking risks [[irwartfrr]]. What choice is not a risk? This is just about wisdom itself, about being practical with the theoretical.
