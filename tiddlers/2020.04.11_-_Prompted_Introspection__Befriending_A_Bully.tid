title: 2020.04.11 - Prompted Introspection: Befriending A Bully

!! When have you realized you were really wrong in your judgment about someone?

[[2018.07.13 - Prompted Introspection: Wrong Judgment]] is right. Fuck it. I'd like to have a happy one. I remember my first bully in kindergarten. He loved Hulk Hogan, and wasn't nice on the playground. Somehow, his grandma took us both to McDonald's (quite rare for me), and we became friends. I'm sad that I cannot recall the boy's name. He had blond hair and he was large for his age. It's cool to have a bully become a friend.
