title: 2018.04.22 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Area Preference

//Yesterday was a complex day, and I forgot to write this portion of my Daily Core Requirements. I'm okay with that fact, especially since I'm making up for it.//

!! Where would you prefer to be right now–mountains, desert, beach–and why?

How far does this preference go? If everything in life was perfect, I'd say beach. My wife likes warm/hot weather. I like the water like an autist. 

Right now, I prefer mountains (I live on one) because I have work to get done.
