title: 2017.11.21 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Smoke & Sauce

!! Why do you think some people smoke/drink?

Why do people do anything? We are reducible to a very complex wetware computing system. We act first because we are genetically embedded with categories, responses to stimuli, and predispositions. With time and conditioning, we also act because it is habituated, because we are that kind of person, because we have fastmind unconscious belief and desire networks, because the rewards center of our brains have been trained to behave in particular ways. That is what we are, and that is fundamentally why we do what we do.

The question is oddly phrased. I suppose you don't want me to make blanket statements, stereotypical claims, sweeping generalizations, and pigeon-hole without justification. But, I have, and I think I'm right. Hmm...Let us say you foresaw this, Lady Melisandre. What then is my Straussian interpretation of your question?

Perhaps it is a question designed to engender empathy, to see causal structures to those wetware configurations which allow me to see how people are less directly responsible for their actions (and more indirectly so?), to not be so judgmental, and to see the hope of reconditioning ourselves out of our bad habits.

We must poison the thoughts of our bad habits. We must redpill ourselves, reframe, and provide new causal structures to ourselves for reforming our habits, and hence ourselves, into happier people. Your question points to the heart of programming ourselves. 

But, mi'lady, don't you see?: //ab initio//, what is the source of our autonomy necessary for adjusting ourselves except who we were? It is clear, there is no fundamental freedom. The incompatibilists certainly make mistakes, but they are correct that we need something quite transcendental in metaphysics to provide us that fundamental agency. We are reducible to principles doing principled things, and we aren't the source of our own principles. 

I am not as worried about my lack of freedom as I used to be. The illusion is what I have, and I'm okay with that. Consciousness just is an experience machine, and my goal is to build an experience machine that I would want to relive eternally given the chance. Relegated to observer, I will still enjoy life. Feeling free is just as good as being free, in this case, or so I tell myself. It's not like I have choice in the matter anyways. =)
