title: 2018.08.09 -- Deep Reading: Introducing Alain Badiou

This is not how I think of metaphysics. I'm trying to appreciate it. Ontology to me is everything, including metaphysics. The problem for me is that metaphysics may itself just be reality too. There's an [[infinigress]] kind of problem where the thing swallows itself. 

The notion of truth here is nothing like I use as an analytic. But, I appreciate some of the moves being made here. The political notion, the way in which memeplexes come alive, now that's interesting. There is a constructivism here, imho. 

I'm probably somehow missing the point still. Why should I buy this metanarrative? The faithful, reactionary, obscure trichotomy isn't boring. I like to see dialectic. 

The Mathemes, no offense, seem dumb.
