[19:54:28] Why, Hello!: Merry Christmas, dude.
[14:05:51] b3nsn0w: hi
[14:05:57] b3nsn0w: merry christmas to you too
[11:13:24] h0p3: How's life going for ya?
[11:37:29] b3nsn0w: hi
[11:37:35] b3nsn0w: it's a tad chaotic, but quite good
[11:37:50] h0p3: Good. 
[11:38:17] h0p3: We just moved to New Haven, so also a tad chaotic but quite good.
[11:38:27] b3nsn0w: oh, wow
[11:38:29] b3nsn0w: that's awesome
[11:38:32] h0p3: I like being close to the grocery store.
[11:39:20] b3nsn0w: yeah, as a European, that's a thing that I don't really think about
[11:39:54] b3nsn0w: but every time I looked at a decent sized US city with suburbs it was weird for me
[11:40:07] b3nsn0w: like... do you normally use cars for everything?
[11:40:13] h0p3: Yes.
[11:40:24] h0p3: For many places I've lived, you cannot survive without a vehicle.
[11:40:48] b3nsn0w: that's so weird in a way
[11:40:57] b3nsn0w: I'm 22 and still procrastinating on getting a license
[11:41:02] h0p3: Things have changed some since was can Amazon so much though.
[11:42:11] h0p3: Even public transport can't really be trusted. We thought we were going to be able to trust the buses here, but their timing is so poor, it would add at least another hour to her commute and she would be late several days a week. 
[11:42:41] b3nsn0w: okay
[11:42:51] b3nsn0w: now I officially don't understand how people in the US survive
[11:43:10] b3nsn0w: like, we criticize public transport here, but it's more for delays of 5-10 minutes
[11:43:52] b3nsn0w: a delay like that at the wrong place could actually add 20 minutes to my commute while I worked an office job, but that was the worst case scenario
[11:44:43] b3nsn0w: otherwise, it was always very reliable (like, within 1-2 minutes on every line), and very extensive
[11:45:13] b3nsn0w: if you got a daily or monthly pass you can pretty much hop around Budapest without any meaningful limitations
[11:45:32] h0p3: I'm jelly. =D.
[11:47:51] h0p3: Connecticut is one of the highest income per capita states in the US. It's in New England, high population density, been around forever, lots of incentives for public transportation. Yet, this is as good as it gets, lol.
[11:48:20] h0p3: Still, I'm grateful that we have it. In TN, we lived on that mountain. 
[11:49:10] h0p3: So whatcha been up to? Anything catching your eye or moving your heart these days?
[11:50:15] b3nsn0w: well, at the start of December I decided to give Witcher 3 a go
[11:50:26] b3nsn0w: thought I would finish it in a few days, a week tops, and get back to my life
[11:50:29] b3nsn0w: famous last words
[11:50:58] h0p3: lol
[11:51:04] b3nsn0w: that thing captured me for a month and a half, only got done with it this Wednesday
[11:51:19] b3nsn0w: but it has been friggin amazing
[11:51:31] b3nsn0w: didn't know a game could do that...
[11:51:36] b3nsn0w: and I've played a few before
[11:51:39] h0p3: What made it amazing?
[11:51:48] b3nsn0w: the story, the characters
[11:51:51] b3nsn0w: the world it has built
[11:51:54] b3nsn0w: mostly the characters
[11:52:10] h0p3: They know how to tell a story.
[11:52:24] b3nsn0w: yeah, pretty much
[11:52:32] b3nsn0w: and they went all out
[11:52:48] b3nsn0w: like, those memes that the netflix witcher series will get 15 more seasons because of side quests
[11:52:55] b3nsn0w: there is legitimately enough material for those in the games
[11:53:12] b3nsn0w: and it's all awesome
[11:53:37] b3nsn0w: seriously, it's a book-quality story, told as a videogame, with no corners cut
[11:54:16] b3nsn0w: meaning you get the full visual and sound design, a world you can walk around in, and still get the same quantity and quality as a book
[11:54:25] h0p3: That's crazy.
[11:54:37] h0p3: I don't think I can name a video game which did that for me.
[11:55:02] b3nsn0w: yeah, me neither except for this one
[11:56:05] h0p3: I must ask my offspring if they would play it too. Sounds like an opportunity to have their minds blown.
[11:56:58] h0p3: It's a big deal too. We are out of the loop on Witcher, and I need them to know the Shakespeares of this decade.
[11:57:24] h0p3: Hand them crack
[11:57:34] b3nsn0w: yeah, as far as games go, there's just nothing like it
[11:57:43] b3nsn0w: now I'm fully on the Cyberpunk 2077 hype train
[11:57:45] b3nsn0w: same developers
[11:58:12] b3nsn0w: and the sad thing about the gaming industry is I can't name a single developer who got anywhere close to CD Projekt Red
[11:58:49] b3nsn0w: I think the closest to it I've seen before may be Assassin's Creed 2
[11:58:54] b3nsn0w: but just to show the difference
[11:59:07] b3nsn0w: the second DLC to Witcher 3, Blood and Wine
[11:59:11] b3nsn0w: it could be a game on its own
[11:59:17] b3nsn0w: and it rivals AC2 on its own
[11:59:19] b3nsn0w: and it's just a DLC
[11:59:50] b3nsn0w: anyway, so basically that's what captured me for the past month and a half
[12:00:05] b3nsn0w: and in the two months before, I got a writing addiction, been doing that
[12:00:14] b3nsn0w: sorry for not being available on tox, both of those kept me on windows
[12:03:06] h0p3: CD PROJEKT RED is cool. So many problems I have with the industry, but I like a lot of their moves.
[12:03:36] h0p3: At least, from my poor understanding.
[12:03:47] b3nsn0w: the only problem I have with them is they're not making more games
[12:03:50] h0p3: Lol
[12:03:59] b3nsn0w: can't change the industry with one game every 4-5 years
[12:05:32] h0p3: What have you been writing about? 
[12:06:00] h0p3: (no worries on availability, we see each other when we can!)
[12:06:17] b3nsn0w: it's been a weird practice book that I can't decide if it's sci-fi or fantasy
[12:06:21] b3nsn0w: started out as a writing prompt
[12:06:27] b3nsn0w: never intended to continue it
[12:06:33] b3nsn0w: well, that lasted maybe 30 minutes
[12:06:46] b3nsn0w: still not sure where it's going
[12:07:53] b3nsn0w: currently, I've completed draft 2, wanna take a break from this specific story so gonna work on draft 3 after getting some more practice with something else
[12:08:14] b3nsn0w: I can send you that draft if you're interested
[12:08:39] b3nsn0w: basically, the premise is our world is a simulation, and a game at that
[12:08:43] b3nsn0w: and they're shutting down the servers
[12:08:46] b3nsn0w: that was the writing prompt
[12:09:13] b3nsn0w: in the book, they try to figure out why they shut it down, while they're also playing the DLCs, which have not been shut down
[12:09:39] b3nsn0w: honestly, even I don't know what the main point of the story is, hence the next drafts
[12:10:14] b3nsn0w: draft 2 got a bit too conservative for my liking, just wanted to write the same story as draft 1 not as bad as draft 1 was
[12:10:47] b3nsn0w: but there's still a lot it's lacking, probably gonna make some major changes in the next one
[12:10:52] b3nsn0w: just don't know what yet
[12:11:50] h0p3: I would have no idea where to go with a book. Reasoning about the premise is fascinating. Building a world, characters, plot that explore it...good gracious. 
[12:12:27] h0p3: I always appreciate how you are obsessive and fearless to dive into a variety of practices, many of which seem to be adjacent. 
[12:14:07] h0p3: Witcher and writing.
[12:14:16] h0p3: If you had to change something about Witcher, what would it have been?
[12:14:46] b3nsn0w: the fundamental structure of the story/dialogue graph
[12:15:03] b3nsn0w: they did an incredible job using the current model
[12:15:15] b3nsn0w: but it's just too limited in certain ways
[12:15:46] b3nsn0w: actually, even started working on a new way to build dynamic stories
[12:15:53] b3nsn0w: but it's just an early prototype yet
[12:16:13] b3nsn0w: the main problem I have with it is that the dialogue tree sometimes feels more like a menu than a game
[12:17:41] b3nsn0w: you can define a videogame as an interactive program with the goal of entertainment
[12:17:48] b3nsn0w: but the thing is, even netflix matches that description
[12:17:53] h0p3: =)
[12:18:05] h0p3: I am unable to draw lines I find satisfactory here.
[12:18:23] b3nsn0w: where it becomes a game is where the entertainment comes from the interaction itself
[12:19:20] h0p3: Which is on a per person basis. Something will then have a tendancy to be a game, a probability of becoming a game for a group of people.
[12:20:11] h0p3: It loses that subjective feeling of being a game for you when it feels too much like a menu.
[12:20:18] b3nsn0w: yeah
[12:20:27] b3nsn0w: actually, yes, it's subjective, and that's half of the problem
[12:20:37] b3nsn0w: because it doesn't just vary on a per person basis
[12:20:47] b3nsn0w: but it's also dependent of your knowledge of it
[12:21:13] b3nsn0w: had to backtrack in the game because I realized I did a past decision the wrong way
[12:21:31] b3nsn0w: (actually, that's one thing I'd change, let's get back to it later)
[12:21:34] h0p3: How did you backtrack?
[12:21:40] h0p3: Did you have to go back to saved states?
[12:21:40] b3nsn0w: loaded a previous savegame
[12:21:44] b3nsn0w: had a bunch of them
[12:22:01] b3nsn0w: created them even more frequently after I backtracked
[12:22:07] h0p3: Are there games which are built upon reverting saved game states as a core mechanic of the game itself?
[12:22:15] b3nsn0w: Stanley Parable, maybe
[12:22:16] b3nsn0w: dunno
[12:22:21] b3nsn0w: haven't seen many of them
[12:22:34] h0p3: Why not? Seems like an interesting way to explore.
[12:22:44] b3nsn0w: yeah, it is
[12:23:11] b3nsn0w: it's also a bit like time travel, hard to put limitations on it, which is necessary both for challenge and for a good story
[12:23:24] b3nsn0w: and also very exotic, very unexplored for now
[12:23:38] b3nsn0w: and most of the game industry doesn't really like to deviate from a known formula
[12:23:44] h0p3: Pussies
[12:23:50] b3nsn0w: exactly
[12:23:59] b3nsn0w: that's actually one of their many problems
[12:24:20] b3nsn0w: and one of the reasons why you're much more likely to find gems among indie games if you're going for the story
[12:24:42] h0p3: Oh, I played what may be called an indie game recently (just for a bit), and I almost never game.
[12:24:57] h0p3: Two actually, come to think of it. 
[12:25:04] b3nsn0w: which games?
[12:26:08] h0p3: A party game called "Jackbox." I'm not a fan of types of games play there, but I'm autistic. Apples to Apples and Secret Hitler are not fun for me.
[12:26:46] h0p3: Last time I played Secret Hitler, I made them show me with cards face up on the table first, and the second time, I played by rolling dice. I'm no fun on that front. Anyway, I did like how the game was very inclusive and lots of people could play it.
[12:27:02] h0p3: But, the game I really liked is called "Baba is You"
[12:27:16] h0p3: Worth a spin if you haven't tried it out.
[12:28:22] h0p3: It's something like second-order logic puzzle where the objects in the game to manipulated are the symbols/words themselves. Manipulating those words manipulated the world (and the win conditions, and so forth).
[12:28:39] b3nsn0w: just watched its trailer on steam
[12:28:45] b3nsn0w: looks really fun
[12:29:19] b3nsn0w: thanks, gonna give it a go at some point
[12:30:08] h0p3: What are examples of indie ideas which made it mainstream? Why did those in particular succeed?
[12:30:50] b3nsn0w: heard a lot of great things about Life Is Strange, for example
[12:30:58] b3nsn0w: also a story-based game
[12:31:23] b3nsn0w: actually, got the first season of it on the steam sale, planning to play it whenever I get the chance
[12:31:33] b3nsn0w: there are also some that aren't really story-based, just great games in general
[12:31:36] b3nsn0w: factorio, for example
[12:31:56] b3nsn0w: and of course there's minecraft
[12:32:20] b3nsn0w: an indie game, made by 10 or so people, that made it to the top of all times over the course of a decade
[12:33:00] b3nsn0w: there are also probably dozens of other examples
[12:33:29] b3nsn0w: but what I find the common point among all these is they all have a strong vision, and they turn that vision into a great game
[12:34:05] b3nsn0w: actually, when they start to fail, that's part of this too
[12:34:10] b3nsn0w: that's when they fail to realize this vision
[12:34:16] b3nsn0w: Space Engineers, for example
[12:34:27] b3nsn0w: the dream was awesome, but the game didn't exactly live up to it
[12:36:27] h0p3: They are such huge projects.
[12:37:00] b3nsn0w: true
[12:37:19] b3nsn0w: even small games cover so many different fields
[12:37:39] b3nsn0w: like, you can write a book alone
[12:37:50] b3nsn0w: you can make a comic book yourself, or with a duo of a writer and an artist
[12:38:34] b3nsn0w: but you can't even make animated movies by yourself in any appreciable quantity
[12:38:46] b3nsn0w: South Park is probably the bare minimum there
[12:39:02] b3nsn0w: they can actually make 20 minute episodes in a matter of days
[12:39:16] b3nsn0w: but even that takes a team of dunno, around 20?
[12:39:37] b3nsn0w: which, if you multiply it, means about 6-8 months of work total, for 20 minutes of storytelling
[12:40:12] b3nsn0w: a better benchmark is that one animator will take about one month on one minute of average quality animation
[12:40:41] b3nsn0w: the amount of work for a given story just blows up the moment visual things need to move
[12:40:54] b3nsn0w: and the thing is, games rarely go below that
[12:41:36] b3nsn0w: puzzle games, like Baba is You, are somewhat easier to make, because once you have an engine and you made the tiles it gets a lot simpler
[12:41:59] b3nsn0w: there are also some weirder games that don't require that much effort
[12:42:05] b3nsn0w: for example, there's one called Orwell
[12:42:17] b3nsn0w: I remember finishing it in a matter of hours, it's not exactly a long game
[12:42:36] b3nsn0w: but it's an interesting story, and something you could reasonably do by yourself in, idk, a year maybe
[12:43:45] b3nsn0w: wait wth it has a sequel
[12:44:24] h0p3: (Orwell is beautifully fucked up)
[12:44:33] b3nsn0w: have you played it?
[12:44:41] h0p3: Nope. Just reading and watching.
[12:45:04] b3nsn0w: yeah, I think it's one of those games where watching it can be just as entertaining
[12:45:21] b3nsn0w: although, it's also a game where you make choices, and I prefer making my own choices
[12:45:31] h0p3: There's a game I played long ago (not much), "Papers, Please"...kinda reminds me of it.
[12:45:59] b3nsn0w: oh, yeah, I see the parallel
[12:46:15] b3nsn0w: never played that one, but I heard about it
[12:47:48] b3nsn0w: as for Witcher 3, I think it actually had the budget of a hollywood movie
[12:47:54] b3nsn0w: although
[12:48:00] b3nsn0w: a movie is 2-3 hours
[12:48:26] b3nsn0w: and that game has something like 200 hours of storytelling in it if you play the side quests and DLCs too
[12:48:37] b3nsn0w: (and you should, that's what makes it awesome)
[12:51:08] h0p3: I feel like an old man or something. It is much harder to find narratives which hold my attention. 
[12:52:41] h0p3: I stopped watching all the major movies which came out in the 90's. Now, I pick them up sparingly. Only a recommendation from a trusted friend will get me to spend the time. It's like I've become bored, disillusioned, and neophobic (get off my lawn!). 
[12:53:31] h0p3: Could just be depression, of course, lol. Not finding things as interesting as I used to. Perhaps part of the hedonic treadmill no longer suits me. 
[12:53:54] b3nsn0w: there's also something about not wanting to commit to a new story
[12:53:56] b3nsn0w: it's kinda weird
[12:53:59] h0p3: Yes
[12:54:06] h0p3: It's expensive
[12:54:11] b3nsn0w: every once in a while I'm bored and fire up popcorn time
[12:54:30] b3nsn0w: and I feel myself drawn to rewatching movies I know rather than trying something new
[12:56:35] h0p3: Oh, yeah, nostalgia, the reliving of the pleasurable circuits in my brain, not having to worry about uncertainty, going with the unrisky clicks that I know are guaranteed to give me 50% without being let down, as though the narrative it is just a way to pass the time as a background noise on the periphery (or even just to drown out the parts of the world I don't want to see)
[12:57:13] h0p3: there are, of course, those stories which I need to live again and again to see how I change over time, to see from a new angle each time 
[12:57:27] h0p3: I feel quite crystallized as a person.
[12:57:50] h0p3: I wonder if that means I'm likely to live in the past in that regard.
[12:59:10] h0p3: Need saved game state timewarping mechanics for life to pwn that Eternal Recurrence problem like a perfectionist.
[12:59:32] b3nsn0w: lol, yeah, that would be nice
[13:00:08] b3nsn0w: anyway, gotta go afk, I have a meeting in like one minute and still have to reboot to windows
[13:00:34] b3nsn0w: (because we use zoom and it's crap on linux)
[13:00:36] b3nsn0w: gonna take a few hours, but I'll come back after it
[13:00:51] b3nsn0w: dropping this here in the meantime
[13:01:06] b3nsn0w: it's basically what I've been up to in November (nanowrimo ftw)
[13:01:21] b3nsn0w: just in case you're interested in it
[13:01:36] b3nsn0w: it has like a million issues but I still had people like it, so idk
[13:01:57] b3nsn0w: anyway, bye, gonna be back in like 3 hours at most
[13:02:16] h0p3: peace homie!
[16:29:54] b3nsn0w: hi
[16:30:05] h0p3: Yo
[16:30:17] b3nsn0w: just got back, didn't expect this meeting to actually take 3 hours
[16:30:24] b3nsn0w: sometimes it does
[16:30:53] h0p3: Work meeting?
[16:30:56] b3nsn0w: yep
[16:32:42] h0p3: I have never done well in meetings, except on a construction site.
[16:33:07] h0p3: Usually, only the impromptu kind. Well, sheeit, I guess we need to do this instead then..., etc.
[16:33:46] b3nsn0w: never been to a construction site
[16:34:17] b3nsn0w: must be interesting, sounds like some actual problem solving there
[16:35:40] h0p3: It was a worthy experience, but I think I am meant to read and write at a computer.
[16:36:21] b3nsn0w: based on your website I can confirm that
[16:36:48] b3nsn0w: but yeah, in desk jobs, you can have great meetings and terrible ones too
[16:36:52] b3nsn0w: depends on the team I'd say
[16:37:32] b3nsn0w: at one point I was in this startup when the lead guy had a horrible idea about what we should be doing
[16:38:17] b3nsn0w: most meetings went like 1. the team figures out what's the best solution, 2. this guy decides something stupid, 3. we argue 4. we make no decision
[16:38:29] b3nsn0w: and then repeat this every week or so
[16:38:40] b3nsn0w: at least that's what I remember about it
[16:39:07] b3nsn0w: it was around the time we started talking, so maybe I've told you about it before, but I honestly don't remember much about that startup
[16:40:07] h0p3: Spinning wheels, repeating the same pointless task, getting nowhere closer in any way toward the goal, ugh, fuck that. =/
[16:41:53] h0p3: Was talking to my brother about Witcher 3. He says there was a card game inside it that was fun to play.
[16:42:06] b3nsn0w: yeah, Gwent
[16:42:14] h0p3: (I'm a Magic: The Gathering geek, so I like deckbuilding games)
[16:42:35] b3nsn0w: then you would probably refer to Witcher 3 as that open world filler between the Gwent matches
[16:42:44] h0p3: lol!
[16:42:51] b3nsn0w: I heard it's great
[16:42:56] b3nsn0w: dunno, haven't bothered to learn it myself
[16:43:17] h0p3: Learned a lot, but I regret how much time I spent in the game.
[16:43:53] b3nsn0w: when I was beginning HS, there was a similar game that was popular in the school
[16:43:58] b3nsn0w: but I arrived a bit late
[16:44:12] b3nsn0w: in a year or two it almost completely disappeared
[16:44:27] b3nsn0w: and most of my classmates who did play it knew about it from earlier
[16:44:35] b3nsn0w: that's like all my experience with these kind of games
[16:44:37] b3nsn0w: they seem fun
[16:45:02] b3nsn0w: but it's the kind of fun I'd only like to do with real people I know, not really interested in Heartstone or Magic online
[16:45:33] h0p3: Aye. Many people want to sling real cardboard in front of people. There's something visceral about it that can't be nicely replaced by being online.
[16:45:52] h0p3: It's not like PvP in a vidya game which can only virtualized.
[16:46:17] b3nsn0w: yeah, the social interaction is like half of what makes it fun
[16:46:35] h0p3: I use tabletop games now as either teaching devices for my offspring or as icebreaker/social-lubricants for us to reveal who we are in person.
[16:47:10] h0p3: As though the game lowers our guard to being ourselves in a more quantified and narrowed context.
[16:47:28] b3nsn0w: yeah, that's called being an introvert
[16:47:31] h0p3: Lol
[16:47:34] h0p3: Aye.
[16:47:49] b3nsn0w: it's actually an awesome idea for an icebreaker
[16:48:07] b3nsn0w: but yeah, it's just not that fun if it's some stranger behind a computerized lottery
[16:48:20] b3nsn0w: in witcher, more specifically, it's a singleplayer game
[16:48:28] b3nsn0w: you play against NPCs
[16:48:41] h0p3: Yes. The story you tell yourself in the world is all there is, in a sense.
[16:49:06] b3nsn0w: and I'd say it's fine, it's a different kind of game where you're trying to always beat a computer than when you want to play with a friend and winning is not that important
[16:49:22] b3nsn0w: it was just a bit overwhelming to me
[16:49:40] b3nsn0w: gwent is by far not the only thing you need to learn in the beginning of that story
[16:50:00] b3nsn0w: so I just kinda skipped it, and stayed away from it
[16:52:12] h0p3: Your book is very dialogue heavy. 
[16:52:36] h0p3: It may be one of your talents. 
[16:52:47] h0p3: I know nothing about writing books*
[16:52:59] b3nsn0w: well, you're reading my first attempt
[16:53:05] b3nsn0w: or, well, second attempt at my first attempt
[16:53:19] b3nsn0w: all I know about writing books comes from that practice and Sanderson's classes
[16:53:49] b3nsn0w: just saying feedback is definitely welcome, and you're in no way unqualified
[16:54:00] b3nsn0w: thanks btw, didn't realize I used that much dialogue
[16:57:01] h0p3: I know a lot of people who want to be a writer. It seems like you dove in and "just did it" in a disciplined fashion. Reminds me of this: https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B000FC0SIM
[16:57:14] h0p3: Seems like you have the right ethic for it to me.
[16:57:41] h0p3: Why are you writing? What's the purpose of it? 
[16:58:10] b3nsn0w: ultimately, because I like stories
[16:58:35] b3nsn0w: my excuse for it in the beginning was that I'll need it for comic books, and I'll need that for games, and I wanna make games
[16:59:01] b3nsn0w: but I kinda started enjoying writing a lot, and I want to get good at it
[16:59:24] b3nsn0w: the trick is, I don't actually want to be a writer, not a full time one at least
[17:00:44] b3nsn0w: don't really know about writing as a career, from Sanderson's explanations it seems kinda great to me, but you do need lots of skill and persistence to it
[17:00:58] b3nsn0w: like, if you haven't made it with book #1, no worries, just submit book #2, and so on
[17:01:25] b3nsn0w: but I got programming already to keep me alive
[17:01:37] b3nsn0w: I'm doing it mostly as a hobby, and for the skill
[17:02:09] b3nsn0w: I want to be able to create stories at a level of quality that they are sufficiently good by themselves
[17:02:41] b3nsn0w: which is what I call a "book-quality" story, because while even a comic book can save a bad story with great art, in a book, all you got is the story
[17:03:59] b3nsn0w: so it kinda became something like my end goal of making games
[17:04:13] b3nsn0w: I wanna make games because I think it would be great if the kind of games existed that I want to make
[17:04:26] b3nsn0w: and same with writing, even if it's not taken as a component of making games
[17:04:57] h0p3: The story makes sense to me.
[17:06:05] h0p3: You seem to enjoy both the ludology and the narratives of games. Is the narrative the masters and the ludology just a kind of filler or way to flesh out the enjoyment of the narrative for you?
[17:07:33] b3nsn0w: I'd say it depends on the game
[17:07:38] h0p3: What kinds of games need to exist that you want to make, btw? An epic fantasy narrative seems to be a direction.
[17:08:19] b3nsn0w: there are so many different ideas and plans for it
[17:08:43] b3nsn0w: the one I started working on now is a way of storytelling that would be that fundamental change I talked about regarding witcher
[17:09:10] b3nsn0w: a story that's not just a graph
[17:09:58] b3nsn0w: maybe the most important idea for it is that NPCs would have dialogue options too, and they'd also choose between them, some of them as many times as the player
[17:10:21] b3nsn0w: based on character attributes and memories that would change during the course of the story
[17:10:34] h0p3: Like factioning?
[17:11:10] b3nsn0w: maybe
[17:11:19] b3nsn0w: maybe other things
[17:12:07] b3nsn0w: how is their skill level, how much they trust you, how much they like each other, what's their long-term desire, etc.
[17:12:11] b3nsn0w: always different on each character
[17:12:21] b3nsn0w: there would be static things about them, because, well, they're characters after all
[17:12:35] b3nsn0w: but there would be things that can change in the background
[17:12:49] b3nsn0w: based on both some randomness and on the events that happen during the story
[17:12:57] b3nsn0w: events you can influence with your own decisions
[17:13:18] b3nsn0w: and you would be able to get to know these characters through their decisions, through how they handle their own dialogue and actions
[17:13:19] h0p3: reminds me of the randomness in procedurally generated games, where you never step in the same river twice
[17:13:36] b3nsn0w: there may be something to it
[17:13:43] b3nsn0w: I kinda think of it more like a card game
[17:13:53] b3nsn0w: where you "never draw the same hand twice"
[17:14:07] b3nsn0w: it's always the same cards, but you do have to play them
[17:14:36] b3nsn0w: it hooks back to interaction and entertainment
[17:15:16] b3nsn0w: even in current games, on your first playthrough, interaction does create entertainment by itself, when you don't know what you're choosing between
[17:15:23] b3nsn0w: but as soon as you do, it becomes a menu
[17:15:48] b3nsn0w: do you want the story where Geralt ends up with Yen, or the one where he goes with Triss?
[17:15:51] h0p3: Maybe that's where you should go over the top. Character dialogues extreme enough that you can tease them apart into dialogues. 
[17:15:52] b3nsn0w: make your decision and click here
[17:16:11] h0p3: can't*
[17:17:02] h0p3: I have no idea how to do that well, but I could imagine that you might build ridiculously enriched characters. 
[17:18:00] h0p3: GPT-2 might do some work there, I have no idea.
[17:18:15] b3nsn0w: I think the trick is not about writing fifteen different endings for a character, it's more like writing four of them and making the player work for it if they want a specific one
[17:18:44] b3nsn0w: nice, but I don't know where AI could be applied here
[17:19:00] b3nsn0w: anyway, still experimenting with this thing
[17:19:14] b3nsn0w: and it's just one of those things that would be great in gaming
[17:19:52] b3nsn0w: there is just so much that would be possible with gaming, but most of those who have the resources to do it well just choose to be boring
[17:20:01] b3nsn0w: because boring still makes money
[17:20:13] b3nsn0w: another thing I think would be awesome is local multiplayer phone games
[17:20:34] b3nsn0w: like, real games, not those microtransaction ridden addiction machines that make EA look good
[17:20:57] b3nsn0w: and you could play them together with your friends by just meeting up somewhere
[17:21:03] b3nsn0w: you have your phone on you anyway
[17:22:14] h0p3: jackbox was like that
[17:22:33] h0p3: And, there's tons of space to improve there, I think.
[17:23:12] b3nsn0w: googled jackbox, but it sounds like a million games in one, no idea which one you're talking about
[17:23:24] b3nsn0w: is it like a bunch of traditional board games turned into a videogame?
[17:24:01] h0p3: It is a million games in one, yeah...social party kinds of games digitized. Devices connect to a site, and you have very simple inputs to get the game moving. 
[17:24:32] h0p3: Hard to make them more complex and still work on all platforms. Web interfaces are hard to beat.
[17:25:08] b3nsn0w: yeah, the browser is kind of like our universal hypervisor
[17:25:39] b3nsn0w: it's ironic how javascript is not at all java, yet it ended up being _the_ solution for "write it once, run it anywhere"
[17:26:26] b3nsn0w: but I think the modern web would be versatile enough to run most games
[17:26:36] h0p3: WASM will go places
[17:27:02] b3nsn0w: yep, whenever it's required
[17:27:18] b3nsn0w: it's mostly Vulkan support for the web that's lacking for a proper AAA game
[17:27:31] b3nsn0w: but let's face it, that's not the kind of stuff you wanna do on mobile
[17:28:13] b3nsn0w: that screen is tiny, we need games that are properly visible on it
[17:28:24] b3nsn0w: although, I think the greatest challenge is still the controls
[17:29:44] h0p3: Yup. Bandwidth from the player to the device is too low.
[17:30:11] h0p3: Without a keyboard and a mouse, you are boned, or you slurp through a straw.
[17:32:13] h0p3: That's a fundamental limit that can't be fixed. Lowest common denominator for input is going to rule the market there. 
[17:32:33] h0p3: I still don't understand the preference for using game controllers on a PC though, so I must be missing something.
[17:33:19] b3nsn0w: they're great for when analog input is useful
[17:33:25] b3nsn0w: for example, I always use them in racing games
[17:33:39] b3nsn0w: (a wheel would be even better though, but I don't have one)
[17:33:49] b3nsn0w: but for aiming, nothing beats a mouse
[17:34:18] b3nsn0w: and the keyboard's million input channels is also something that controllers just can't do
[17:34:32] b3nsn0w: still, for most games, as long as you don't need aiming, a controller is honestly fine
[17:35:04] b3nsn0w: and it's much easier to port a controller's input scheme to a keyboard and mouse than vice versa
[17:35:32] b3nsn0w: simply because the keyboard and mouse together are more capable unless analog input is present
[17:35:34] b3nsn0w: and even then
[17:35:41] b3nsn0w: there are special devices
[17:35:51] b3nsn0w: like the keyboard I'm typing on right now, which has analog inputs on all keys
[17:36:27] b3nsn0w: or the mouse Asus recently announced that has a joystick on it
[17:36:52] b3nsn0w: (probably my next mouse unless it's pointlessly expensive)
[17:39:45] h0p3: I get the analog input. That makes sense. 
[17:42:32] b3nsn0w: wow wth
[17:42:36] b3nsn0w: just checked the book you linked
[17:42:46] b3nsn0w: the mass market paperback is more expensive than the regular paperback?
[17:42:50] b3nsn0w: that's weird
[17:43:34] b3nsn0w: unless "mass market paperback" is more like a designation of a format, like "trade paperback" than an actual indication that it's designed to be a more attaianble version of the same book
[17:45:40] b3nsn0w: okay, the answer is it's complicated and a bit stupid, as usual
[17:46:09] b3nsn0w: the actual answer is mass market is the 4x7" size
[17:46:46] b3nsn0w: but it's called that because it was distributed to magazine distributors and that's where it got the size
[17:47:10] b3nsn0w: although, even if you don't sell it to them, if you make it 4"x7", it's a mass market paperback
[17:47:50] b3nsn0w: so it's a physical size but aCkChYuAlLy...
[17:53:40] h0p3: Neat.
[17:54:07] h0p3: I didn't know there was a difference.
[17:54:28] b3nsn0w: found it out when I got Mistborn
[17:54:42] b3nsn0w: here in Hungary English books are a bit hard to find
[17:55:01] b3nsn0w: the 4x7" size was the only one available
[17:55:04] b3nsn0w: but I kinda like it
[17:55:18] b3nsn0w: then I saw it online, and I was like "no, the paperback cover doesn't look like that"
[17:55:29] b3nsn0w: so I googled it, and it turns out there are two different paperbacks
[17:55:50] b3nsn0w: I actually kinda like the mass market paperback size
[17:56:14] b3nsn0w: 5x8" is okay, but anything larger just feels needlessly bulky
[17:57:01] b3nsn0w: actually, just got one of the Percy Jackson books, and it's a trade paperback
[17:57:03] b3nsn0w: meaning it's huge
[17:57:28] b3nsn0w: it looks kinda stupid on the shelf, next to its normal-sized brothers
[17:57:54] b3nsn0w: it turns out the local bookstores don't even list the size
[17:58:03] b3nsn0w: had to look it up on amazon, then match ISBNs
[17:58:21] b3nsn0w: even better, local bookstores only use the outdated 10-digit ISBN
[17:58:29] b3nsn0w: because why not
