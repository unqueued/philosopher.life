* Stunning!

*** Thank you. Yes. I have a reason to be depressed, and it's not merely some random assortment of chemicals (unless you are willing to take the same argument about human life in general, at which point I will reduce your identity to absurdity as well)
*** I would not say that I didn't want to be a burden to others, but rather to myself. I stayed alive because it would be a burden to those I love if I died. 
*** I'm not sure if I was bargaining with anyone besides myself. I'd describe my wife as being very supportive and my brothers to some extent as well. I don't think I've been bargaining with them though. I think the thought of depression as a bargaining tool for generating sympathy to be really interesting, and it's obvious that my donors took it to be just that. I don't think I was convinced they would do anything about it, especially after seeing how they treated my brother AIR.
*** Anti-depressants didn't help in the end. Facing the problem has helped far more.
*** Depression does seem far less functional when the social fabric is radically altered, when we aren't tightly knit communities invested in each other, etc.

**** I can say my sleep schedule is clearly fundamental to handling my depression.

*** I'm not saying I agree to their ultimate agenda, but they are at least admitting it more openly. 
*** This reminds me of instant wars in light-speed travel in sci-fi, at least a bit. 
*** Don't you see why we everyone must receive the classic liberal education, why FOSS is so fucking important, why default privacy+anonymity is crucial, why decentralizing power is the only chance we have?

*** The porn industry will always be bleeding edge, at least for the public. I have no doubt there are agencies who have long been such equipped. We cannot trust our eyes anymore.

*** To think anyone supports the DNC blows my mind. It becomes more overt each passing day how they have been hollowed out.

*** Sounds xenophobic. How about we actually implement socialism and solve all the problems, yo. Oh, that's not what you want. Hrmm. I see what you are.

*** I've seen many attempts at this over the years. I like that people continue to try. I hope that [[Atropos]]/[[Outopos]] succeeds where they have not.
