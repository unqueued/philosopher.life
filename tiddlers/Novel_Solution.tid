title: Novel Solution

I have very strong opinions about what is wrong with the world. I see the nightmare vision that others do not. I have a deep understanding of the stack in some respects. I have had the gutteral training in it for a very long time. Perhaps I should write a book on it. Dystopian novels do something important for us, and I can see far. All I have to do is scaffold out the world, the contingent truths, and follow them. The plot must find itself in that world, a way to display all the things I find horrifying.

I want to provide a solution too. I want to talk about a [[Outopos]] in there too. I want to define what I think the world should look like for people. I want that dichotomy to be as clear as day.

I want to show the darkest things I think may come true (and perhaps even dark fantasy on top because it is interesting), but I want to show the way out as well.
