//I see we don't talk about what matters to me directly so much. That's okay. I value his project.//

so.... I've got a prototype of hashmap running
in a VERY early alpha phase
https://prototype.hashmap.sh/2DrjgbEmDS9co7MT4ZGFqUxAAApFtbqgywWmpXhGLQJfzfX8bG
this is the first successfully submitted payload
and with the hashmap cli tool, you can easily analyze a payload as well

That message is a test message for handshake chat app, but you can put anything you want in there up to 512 bytes of data

lovely
I like how you are trying to kind of trying to solve Zooko's triangle and Zawinski's Law at the same time.
Tox is a failure because users don't store information for other users. I like how you intend to build that automated cooperation into the protocol itself.
at least to my understanding what you are building*
Will you continue to containerize it?
rjrbt
yeah - I think we are trying to keep primitives to just that.
I also think that handshake might end up becoming a protocol 
I'd love to loop back and use hashmap + handshake as configuration options for killcord
I haven't abandoned killcord, I just really needed to get these other ideas out there and plan to loop back :)
h0p3
that's how the design process works
