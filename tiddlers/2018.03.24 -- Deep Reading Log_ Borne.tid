Extremely rich world.

Nothing ever came out of borne.

Okay, VanderMeerkat is significantly better at painting pictures and worlds than Atwood. It's striking. His post-apocolyptic vision is fascinating, "weird" (overused, but I don't have a better word), and somehow believable.

I adore the socialist critique of "The Company." The "City" is clearly scary. This is romantic.

<<<
It's just me.
<<<

E.T. Moment. 

Classic questions of the nature of Dasein and Humanity. Smacks you in the face all day.

<<<
Every person has a purpose...Am I a person?
<<<

Personhood and Purpose, of course.

Lots of philosophy of language showing up on the stage here. It's not a technical discussion, but it is a narrative that displays it.

Science Magic, Clarke, as usual.

I knew there was something odd about their memories of their discussions. I could have sworn it was off. Lovely.

<<<
By these words, we knew we were real...even if I didn't feel real.
