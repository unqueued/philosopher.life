How goes it?
MON 4:34 PM
How's it going?
4 HR AGO
Oh gosh, I missed you message yesterday
4 HR AGO
ha, no worries
4 HR AGO
Never have I been more ready to reach through my computer and strangle people
4 HR AGO
rofl
4 HR AGO
Seriously.
4 HR AGO
People at work are infuriating me.
4 HR AGO
I will work on a command line tool for you. sudo strangle.exe targetname
4 HR AGO
^^^^^^^
4 HR AGO
have they still not given you what you need?
4 HR AGO
Nope.
4 HR AGO
you just aren't their priority
4 HR AGO
Strauss time
4 HR AGO
Do they want you to fail?
4 HR AGO
What do they owe you again?
4 HR AGO
And some are going as far as wasting time with pointless meetings where they aren’t getting any further on the subject at hand.
4 HR AGO
I doubt it because if I fail they ALL look bad.
4 HR AGO
An outline of what they’re going to say in their slice of this presentation.
4 HR AGO
What will you be using the outline for?
4 HR AGO
Slice is maybe a bad word — these presentations are nearly an hour each
4 HR AGO
When are the presentations?
4 HR AGO
The outline is so I can make a slide deck for their presentation
4 HR AGO
November 12-13
4 HR AGO
AND
4 HR AGO
We have 6 high-priority projects going on at the same time.
4 HR AGO
But they’ve known about mine for months now.
4 HR AGO
Presumably, they've not lifted a finger, and they are only going to have something thrown together last minute, and that's why they don't have any outline to hand to you, right?
4 HR AGO
Basically yeah.
4 HR AGO
Which is what happens EVERY year, despite my best efforts to change it otherwise.
4 HR AGO
It’s infuriating.
4 HR AGO
Forgive me for playing devil's advocate, trying to step into the shoes of people I assume are evil here.
4 HR AGO
No worries.
4 HR AGO
I would think this is your problem, not mine. I can deliver my presentation with or without slides. If there aren't slides, I'll be able to say: well, I gave it to her (even if it's night before), and that's on her.
4 HR AGO
To which I will pull up my email and say “that’s crap, please eat your words”
4 HR AGO
...I need to find a different job.
4 HR AGO
It sucks being responsible for something outside your control.
4 HR AGO
being held* responsible
4 HR AGO
Very true
4 HR AGO
Anyways, thank you again for letting me complain. How is life on your end?
4 HR AGO
My brother [[AIR]] is coming to visit; he arrives tonight. I'm very excited.
4 HR AGO
Wooooooo
4 HR AGO
I forgot it was today :D
4 HR AGO
Been remodeling the wiki. Gonna take several months to do it. I've finally broken down and started automated parts of it. I've been trying to avoid dynamic content, since I strongly prefer static, hardcoded work for a bunch of reasons.
4 HR AGO
Have some tools for automated tagging with rules/search, so that will help.
4 HR AGO
Hopefully I'll be at Version 3.0 soon enough =)
4 HR AGO
Still working on a letter to kickscondor; it will have taken me a month to write...longer than it should.
4 HR AGO
Kids and I have been playing music together, so that's been cool.
4 HR AGO
Sounds like you’ve got some good things going
2 HR AGO
As far as writing, I’m not sure you give yourself enough credit. You always put lots of thought and time into crafting your responses, so I think it’s reasonable that some of them would take over a month.
2 HR AGO
Also, what do you mean by playing music? Musical instruments?
2 HR AGO
Well, I hope you check it out. One of my goals is to make my wiki palatable, more usable, and more welcoming to others, especially my family. I would very much appreciate your input.
1 HR AGO
Absolutely!
1 HR AGO
You are right. It is okay that I'm taking a month; I just feel bad about it (like I'm letting kicks down).
1 HR AGO
We are playing instruments. Son and I guitar, daughter banjo.
1 HR AGO
I tried to peek in every now and then. Admittedly I have been bad about it lately because I’m having trouble keeping up with my own life as it is.
1 HR AGO
Please start a bluegrass band. XD
