!! Respond to the following:

Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some, are given a chance to climb. They refuse, they cling to the realm, or the gods, or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.

This is a quote of my nightmares. I'm going off on a tangent first, bear with me, please.

The real problem with //The Silence of the Lambs// is that the antagonist is so rational, emulatable, and somehow sane-appearing. We can see who we really are through Hannibal Lecter in some cases. He's clearly aware; he's brilliant. He can only ever play a simulated game though. The ability to describe a phenomenon to some [[dok]] is not necessarily the ability to prescribe what we ought to do, think, or be with respect to that phenomenon. Indeed, there is an "is" to the "ought," and thus I believe a complete description of a state of affairs can only be theoretically accomplished by [[The Good]] itself. Moving to we [[fff]], it is clear that Hannibal Lecter has astounding descriptive powers, but it will always be incomplete because he lacks ultimate prescriptive power. He does offer advice and commands, but only instrumentally. Seeking the intrinsic, unified [[Good]] is a completely different game. 

Petyr's got the same brilliance going on, and he's arguably far more articulate. I imagine Petyr is arguing full force against me. Listen carefully to the psychopath. The pursuit of power is the only pursuit which has intrinsic value. Thus, I ask you Petyr: what is power good for? If it is conceptually possible for that question to be meaningful, then you have not found [[The Telos]]. Power is only an instrument by definition.

Petry is talking about the material dialectic. It's a gorgeous description. Unfortunately, Petyr forces me to ask a question I cannot sufficiently answer myself. What is the metaethical foundation and [[Telos]] of the material dialectic? I am no compatibilist, and I don't think just any unified creature is good by definition (I believe in evil agency, folks). What Gaeaic Unity ought we achieve? It appears only [[The Original Position]] has a chance of helping us understand and implement [[The Good]] [[Right]]fully. Process theology, yes. It is odd when the method becomes the closest thing to [[The End]] we can pragmatically muster.

Yet another tangent: this is what the internalist conceptually can never answer, and you will fall to the paradox of tolerance in the dialectic. I agree that there is a valid path from every point of you (everything behind you is immutable), but that does not give you the objective right to hold your opinion, be who you are, or maintain your identities. I really do think most identities are invalid. That engaging in honest introspection can make you feel bad doesn't mean you shouldn't feel bad! Medicine fails to be sufficiently existential in its pursuit of health.
