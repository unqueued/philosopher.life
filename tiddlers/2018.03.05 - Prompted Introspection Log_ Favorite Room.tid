title: 2018.03.05 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Room

!! What is your favourite room in your home and why?

Lobbing me 'dem softballs. Yum. Why, the living room, of course! It's where we all hang out. Family life happens in the living room. It's where we eat, talk, work, play, etc. It's where my mistress lives (I obey my master, servicing her every chance I get). I like living, and the living room is where I live my hikikomori life.
