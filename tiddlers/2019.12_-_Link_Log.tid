!! Audit:

* I am surprised I did anything here. I'm happy that something made it into my [[Link Log]]s. It's been a busy month.
** I don't anticipate doing much this month either. We're still trying to move in.
* From compressed to just cryptic now, I suppose. Annotations for what audience? Me. Categories for ML or even just weak tagging.
** It's not boring for [[others]], but I know it isn't satisfactory. 
* One of my favorite parts about my [[Link Log]] is that you can get a reasonable picture of who I am just in these. It's a non-trivial mapping.
* I could attempt to tag and organize these far more, but the explosions of tiddlers doesn't seem worth it to me. I'm going to stick to the minimalism until I can no longer; there's too much work to do.
* I think I accept linkrot and archival problems way more than the other people who engage in this task. 
** Maybe I shouldn't. 
** One of the standout aspects of my wiki is that you can read it offline and still make sense of huge swathes of it without connecting outside. External links are low-hanging fruit semantic footholds, but they aren't fundamental.
*** Hell, academic citation is something I've just thrown out the window. I don't have time to dig up some obscure authority which has said some thing I've said. 
**** There's something wrong-headed about requiring expertise to peel it apart, to charitably guess on my behalf even in reference. But, the breadcrumbs are there. I still take myself to be racing for something which I don't trust others (or see anyone else) to race for, and my [[hope]] is that I can bridge the pieces I need, search and narrow, and trace or comb my breadcrumbs where necessary. I know others don't find it sensible, but we have different goals.
