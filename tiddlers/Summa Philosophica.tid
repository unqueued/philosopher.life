title: Summa Philosophica

//I hope to show a few highlights of my academic journey in philosophy. //

I went into professional philosophy to rationally justify my faith and my upbringing. I felt I was doing God's work and being maximally charitable to my parent's beliefs and actions. We all surely needed defense in the face of some exceedingly effective  opposing arguments, evidence, and intuitions I encountered. I arrogantly believed I would succeed in my apologetic task. If I'm being kind to myself, I would say I just wanted the world to make sense, and I still do. Since losing my faith, I have slowly come to see my vocation as becoming happy through pragmatizing my systematic philosophy.

Obviously, we memetically evolve. It's the nature of our software that we can more easily modify and shape it than our hardware. I agree and disagree with my previous arguments to various degrees (and not for the same reasons always), as is only natural. These were special, influential, and hard-won thoughts for me though, so I am preserving them.

Unfortunately, file and text format conversions stripped and modified (almost entirely in terms of formatting) some of this work. Figures were lost as well. It is the nature of digital decay and migration. Much of the preservation work is done by hand. There will be errors, but this should be in good overall shape. I'm afraid you get to put up with all the natural errors, both syntactic and semantic, as well. Good luck! =)
