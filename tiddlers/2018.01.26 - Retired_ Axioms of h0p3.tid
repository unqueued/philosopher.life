//See: [[Theorems of h0p3]]//

I am religious/spiritual/en-faithed in the least religious sense. I mean it as a man hoping to be a virtuous epistemic agent, I must take up some axioms in faith. I continue to test my axioms, as I always have done. May I have the integrity to continue until I die

I hope to be a particularistic man of principle. I will contextualize my axioms as best as I can.

I am committed myself to these axioms. I identify with them; they are central to who I am. These cross-culturally universal virtue-theoretic cliché-truisms are the most fundamental principles of mine for the construction of myself and this wiki. I hope to coherently weave myself around these self-legislated commandments.

* Axioms
** Zeroth: Have hope.
** [[Reconstruction Proceeds Deconstruction]]
** [[Be Happy]]
** [[Know Thyself]]
** [[Virtue is Knowledge]]

I develop theorems from axioms.

Essentially, in my analysis of my first existential axioms, those truisms: [[Know Thyself]] and [[Virtue is Knowledge]], I hope I have taken up two other axioms, namely: [[Empathize with Yourself]] and [[Program Yourself]]. [[Empathize with Yourself]] is the means to employing the [[Categorical Imperative]], a necessary decision procedure engine we rely upon to know what is virtuous. Further, [[Program Yourself]] is the means to long-term happiness. Both my starting axioms are clearly deeply related to these two new ones.
