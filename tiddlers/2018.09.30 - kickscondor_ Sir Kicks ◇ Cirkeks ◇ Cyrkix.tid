//Sir Kickscondor kindly engages in philosophy.<<ref "tl">>//

Dear Kicks Condor,

I'm taking forever to reply again, lol. You have not been forgotten! I've been digesting. I appreciate your watching and replying in the meantime. I bet you don't think it's necessary, but I want to say it anyways: thank you for your patience. =)

[[2018.09.29 - kickscondor: The Narrows]] reaches out to me. I take you seriously, even when I'm trying to be less [[cereal|https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Super%20Cereal]] with you.<<ref "w">> I suggest you are generously sharing your {[[Principles]]} with me, and I aim to pay you every bit of [[Straussian]] justice I can. Sometimes informal questions obligate more formal answers. I try not to be too informal about what matters most. I must attempt to be (and hopefully succeed in being) explicitly humble (totally my delusional strong suit, right?) before your questions. You talk to me about things which are so deep a problem for me, I hold them in such high regard, that I feel morally obligated to not talk about them too casually with you or myself. I apologize for violating your preferences in our conversation.

> Very cool! My Recent pushes edited tiddlers to the top; I am not yet convinced your tool has the same behavior.

If it doesn’t, it’s a bug. I use the `mtime` of the post’s file to arrange these, so I cannot sneak around it. If you can give me an example of the difference, I would really like to know!
<<<

I have no example. In fact, I'm not sure I can give an example without snapshots. You definitely would know better than I would here;  [[Ignore me!|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds6-o4gomRc]] 

Thank you for providing https://kickscondor.com/all. I appreciate the timeline and openness of it. That's how I view your site, though I still use RSS to ping me about new frontpage content. RSSes from you are like a little present; I immediately click out of instinct now. I like how you have distinguished the frontpage from all.

I should add that you're continuing to evolve your style. I still don't have a stylesheet for you yet. What are your preferences? What will be your whostyle/voicestyle on my wiki? I can choose on your behalf if you prefer.

> Thank you for the Robustness principle. It’s beautiful.

I’m glad you see it! I find it very profound—however, it is also somewhat cliché you could say, because it is only another sighting of ‘yin’ and ‘yang’ in the system. (I say ‘cliché’ not to belittle it, but to underscore how commonplace this strain of epiphany seems to be in the ‘eastern’ ways of thinking. I often think of the expression ‘if you meet the Buddha, kill him’—how do you both attempt to follow an archetype and to avoid archetyping that ideal too closely? But it does seem wise.)
<<<

I think I understand very little about Eastern philosophy (I hope not, but perhaps philosophy in general).<<ref "e">> I give you my naive point of view. I consider the Robustness principle to have an ethical //asymmetry// at the heart of it. I think it is hedged-conservative. This principle might even be an application of [[T42T]] in that it aims to be more cooperatively open and forgiving than [[T4T]]. Psychological and procedural openness (which is not agreeableness) is something I value. I agree it is dialectical like yin and yang (to my poor understanding of these concepts), but I think the greatest emergence is only a result of a sufficient percentage<<ref "wh">> of parties engaging in the asymmetrical principle to overcome misunderstandings, accidents, and overcoming our [[fff]] circumstances at large. 

I want to argue against the idea that the Robustness principle is another sighting of yin and yang because it is too asymmetric (even applied to itself). I think Robustness appears more like a master/slave dialectic in which one clearly serves the other (at least in principle). I have a  hard time pinning down the sublation of the appearance of symmetry between yin and yang. 

The "Kill the Buddha" shock-koan is difficult to wrestle with because its brevity lends too much ambiguity. However, it reminds me of Aristotle's Golden Mean in Virtue Theory. It reminds me of trying to "take everything in moderation" (except that principle?). I never know how to be immoderately moderate [[irwartfrr]], but I shoot for the precise measurement of the mean as best I can.

<<<
I wonder if you can also help me find some philosophical discussion about dichotomies and tradeoffs.
<<<

Hegel is the philosopher all about that issue, especially if you are interested in yin and yang. That ~~bastard~~ Saint is prolix and ridiculously hard to read. I strongly prefer reading about him instead of reading him (that goes for a number of philosophers). I think it will help to study about Kant, Plato, Aristotle, and Spinoza as well. To the quantitative angle: Gödel, linear logic, intuitionist logic, and dialetheism seem to be on the money. This is an area of exploration for me.

<<<
For example, I find both socialism and capitalism very appealing—I truly can’t say which I prefer. I like that the library exists; and I like shopping for boots. I know there is a lot of negativity around this dualism (“this isn’t free-market capitalism”/“socialism hasn’t really been tried”) except that there seems to be respect for Denmark which has both free markets and high taxes, which certainly looks dualist (pluralist?—not sure the proper term) to me.
<<<

I can appreciate that you can't say which you prefer.<<ref "ps">> I applaud your willingness to reason out loud about it. It is a task I hold in high regard.

I think markets are fascinating, especially in video games. There is something quite beautiful about the dog-eat-dog evolutionary State of Nature, and I find aesthetic beauty in the ruthless pursuit of competitive advantage in Capitalism at any cost (including moral ones). The process of the centralization of power is breathtaking. I am, however, fairly convinced by one side (at least in our context). It is no accident that Marx is the student of Hegel (even in their disagreement). I think we are quickly running out of time to come up with a viable solution to the Crisis of Capitalism in the 21st century. 

I suggest that libraries can exist in capitalism and shopping for boots can exist in socialism; I fear those examples miss the point, but you are brief (so you likely know this). Socialism is a dialectical response to and description of capitalism; prescriptively, it is roughly the claim that the workers should own the means of production. I like to think this is equivalent to the claim that power must be decentrally structured to maintain (and improve upon) its decentralization (of course, easier said than done, and there are a number of serious conceptual and practical considerations). I readily admit I do not know the answer, but I do know we are morally obligated to find the best one we can.

Plenty of demsocs (and others) have admired Scandinavia. I've looked into living there several times. They are clearly capitalists with good nationalist safety nets (though, even that may be changing). That is a minimal attempt to decentralize power within their national boundaries (while still exploiting the rest of the world). I'm not convinced we can implement this worldwide either; Scandinavia occupies a special geopolitical position in the material dialectic. For example, I think it will take a revolution to force the transnational elite to actually pay their taxes in the US; show me how to tax the rich, and I'll show you a political system which has already decentralized power enough to apply the Rule of Law effectively (we live in an oligarchy, sir). I am not sure if pluralism is the right word for it either, but I am interested in what you have to say about it. Insofar as pluralism just is decentralized power, we may be in agreement.

I am most interested in the extremes and understanding what is so motivating about their principles. I think centrists are almost always reactionaries (with varying motivations and points of view, of course). I agree to a J-Curvish Horseshoe theory of dialectical oscillation between the Left and Right (with the improvement being on the Leftist swing upward). I'm a Rawlsian Marxist, and here are two compelling books from my frenemies<<ref "en">> which I highly recommend:

* [[Anarchy, State, and Utopia|http://download1.libgen.io/ads.php?md5=4DF3C4D89CDC5F537B70F6F7FB2F8DED]]
* [[Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society|http://download1.libgen.io/ads.php?md5=05F67EDFEDD34E30187BFBBA91C73EB0]]

I think the dichotomies you point to in this example are non-trivially concerned with the [[dok]] to which we politically and morally own ourselves. It's a local (individual) vs. global (collective) relationship to the [[The Good]] which we must dialectically weigh and wrestle many times over. I am virulently opposed to undefended centrism on this topic. It is clear that consistent altruism is punished/rejected by almost everyone (arguably raising the bar higher than most wish to pay),<<ref "al">> and therefore we must always demand a good defense of hedonic, individualist, egoistic behavior and motivations since that's exactly where each of us tends to experience the greatest evolutionary pressures to confabulate. 

Here's another way to say it: the virtuous golden mean in a given context sits between two vices, one of excess and the other of deficiency. To dialectically overcome vice requires one to overshoot where one perceives the golden mean in order to increase the chance of actually landing on the mean (and, this is a continual process). I posit that contemporary cultures have been so profoundly infected by the Rand-Locke memeplex (a psychopathic strain of The Enlightenment) that we tend to be radically selfish and individualistic; I suggest, in fact, that human specimens  are most effectively described through psychological egoism (which is not the claim that we should prescribe such a thing!). Thus, on average, if we are to overcome our selfish vice, then we're going to have to overshoot for selflessness (our selfish disposition will pull us back).

<<<
So I wonder where in literature I might look for more about living/thinking pluralistically. My friends seem to see it as being hedonist, non-committal, ‘lukewarm’ and impossible. Well, yes—but it’s much more than that. It’s pluralism after all.
<<<

I hear several things in your words. Perhaps you may be after a utopian concept in which people freely associate in whatever kinds of communities they prefer (a world filled with a wide variety of all possible kinds of competing and intermingled political beliefs, behaviors, and structures). Some pluralism is clearly necessary for we [[fff]]. Maybe you have another kind of coexistence approach here. Of course, I wish we could all just get along, but I know dark-triadicism is winning in [[The Great Human Conversation]]; I legitimately believe our species is allowing itself to wipe itself out. I am at war with evil; [[Virtue is Knowledge]]. 

Perhaps your friends are correct. I do not have enough information to make a judgment. It sounds like you want to have your cake and eat it too.<<ref "a">> My gut reaction is to say you've severely misunderstood capitalism if you think it can co-exist with anything else (not even itself). It centralizes power in the hands of those who seek it at all moral costs until it collapses. I remain open to the possibility that the adversarial relationship between selfishness and selflessness is conceptually necessary; I do not know how to solve this problem all the way down. I am convinced that building [[The Original Position]] (even Rawls believed agents behind the Veil of Ignorance were mutually disinterested personal-utility-maximizing egoists; though I am not so convinced they must be in the end) begins with building effective democratic structures in order to fairly structure everything else.

I want to point out what I believe will be one of our primary tensions: metaethical perfectionism leads me to deny the majority of accounts of pluralism. This is extremely unpopular among those who consider themselves liberal (whatever that word means). Fundamental disagreement is a problem I do not take lightly either. I aim to respect those who disagree with me as best I can. I aim to make room for coexisting with those who are fabulously wrong as best I can too (in fact, I'm regularly indebted to those with whom I profoundly disagree). Unfortunately, I have to draw the lines of moral permissibility somewhere. As usual, moral philosophers can never stop violating Godwin's law for easy N^^th^^ degree examples: I simply cannot say or do nothing when Nazis exercise their power to destroy or torture humans for morally arbitrary characteristics (surely nothing like that is happening in our the United States right now, right?). When you sit down to systematically and fairly start your line-drawing (and justifying it), I believe you're going to see that pluralism is much weaker than you would have hoped it would be. There absolutely must be room for difference, but I think tolerance cannot always be tolerated both conceptually and practically. I'm especially opposed to those select variants of pluralism which are selfish reactionary positions of being unwilling to commit to morality, ultimately wielded to conveniently justify whatever hedonic perspectives and behaviors we think should be protected under the guise of relativistic tolerance. But, of course, I think some kind of plurality can and should be preserved. I do not have the answer, but I know the answer is real.

<<<
>    I want to apologize for my constant ninja-edits. I have a thousand evolving things to say to you, and my drafts are just never done (as you have probably noticed).

Change anything you want! You have my full trust. We are in a process of mental and lingual refinement. The tradeoff here is that I won’t be responding too closely to your words. I am going to not pick them apart—unless I want to tease out more understand or to encourage further ninja-edits.
<<<

Thank you for your trust! I think we are largely in agreement here. I appreciate that you enable us to determine which threads are salient. I ask you to read the first non-draft in detail. I would rather you respond closely to my words than for me to have the opportunity to ninja-edit. If this is a tradeoff that I have a choice in, I'd prefer to refrain from all semantic edits. I agree you shouldn't respond to most of my words, but I ask you to take them into account to some degree in your teasing (I do not know how to draw that line). I aim to choose my words with precision (despite the many errors), and sometimes I pack a lot into them.

> Had to look that song and lyrics up. I keep an almost full size oil canvas reproduction of The Starry Night about four feet to the left of my desk.

Yeah I guess now that I think about it, my thoughts were more on the painting than the song. But both are very intertwined for me. I had an uncle die of AIDS in his twenties. I was in third grade at the time. He was the rare uncle who is a friend—and he was a sensitive and stylish person. He was a painter and this was his favorite painting. My first experience crying emotively was when this painting and the song came on to the screen during a school assembly in fifth grade.

I felt that he was ‘trapped’ in the painting—I looked into it and saw him. And also did not see him—just the dark, brilliant world without him. So he was also ‘free’ in the painting. I knew of Van Gogh’s troubled end and this added to the swirling spectre. It was as if the appearance on the screen of this image was an appearance of them—an impressive outward display of their presence in my soul. (Of course this was just a random slide that was thrown in there—I knew that even at the time, but it was as striking as if their photographs had been displayed.)
<<<

[[kickscondor]], the page, has been updated in light of this. I'm glad we are both moved by this painting. I am sorry if it is a painful reminder. I [[hope]] it will be a joyous thing we hold in common. I would like to appreciate [[Beauty]] with you. I worry about pressing you on such an emotional topic, since I'm not standing in your shoes and can't feel it like you can; it's really hard to put words to it, and I aim to respect that as best I can (which is not the claim that I do a good job). It is possible your take on the [[ridtyawtr]] concept may be at work here. It is moving to hear your vision of this painting. 

The swirl/spiral is a powerful symbol to me. It is dialectical. Impressionist paintings enable me to trigger HPPD symptoms, [[replicating|https://www.reddit.com/r/replications/top/]] hallucinogen effects while sober. //The Starry Night// appears to move under the right conditions for me (I suggest Van Gogh not only would approve given his own hallucinations but may have even intended it). I know what I perceive is not reality, but I admire the [[Beauty]] in the appearance to which I'm attending. 

<<<
> I am not asking the same from you, since I consider it unreasonable to ask it of you (but not of myself here). I hope to ‘go with the flow’ of your conversational style.

This, along with the coincidence of the painting by your desk, is immense common ground for us! The principle of “my rules don’t apply to you, but you are free to look through them” (is this accurate?) seems woven throughout your wiki and I try to adhere to this perspective, too.
<<<

You strike me as kindly passive (watching and contemplating), perhaps not meaning to start any fights and seeking not to be divisive. You do appear to be a peacekeeper. I am convinced you are a profound listener, which is exactly what makes what you say so meaningful to me. It feels like the Robustness Principle in action to me.

I fear you will find me arrogant and abrasive (surprise!). Again, in the dogmatic vein, I am profoundly concerned with [[Fideism]], realism, and metaethical perfectionism. I am not a moral relativist (though, I have wrestled with nihilism), and I radically attack that position. I aim to defeat postmodernism as best I can. I'm extremely intolerant and disagreeable in many contexts, but I am open to reasoning about a great deal (that's part of what justifies my intolerance). I really do think everyone is morally obligated to be moral; [[The Categorical Imperative]] is exceptionless by definition (all exceptions are handled by definition). I am slow to claim that I understand much about what is exceptionless, but if I am to understand and act upon it, I must put my tentpegs down in the desert (I am grateful to have the opportunity to move my tent when the necessity arises).

I do agree that [[The Right]] thing to do is particular to each context, but I also think there are heuristic rules of thumb which have vanishingly few exceptions (and, in fact, I believe [[The Golden Rule]] is totalizingly universal: it is [[The Categorical Imperative]] in a nutshell). I'm in pursuit of those rules which to apply to any person in my context, and I'm especially interested in those rules which apply to all contexts. I believe some of the things I'm talking about apply to every conceivable contingent person.<<ref "c">>

> I’m considering adding compression internal to TW, but it violates my goal of keeping the source maximally readable. Unless I go for some alternative non-TW oriented loader, I’m like 99% sure I’m just going to stick to gzip and make people patiently wait (probably good for bouncing impatient trolls as well).

So you don’t want to separate the wiki into separate pages? Or can’t? I thought there was a way of splitting tiddlers up. Or exporting or something.

The monolithic file is the central issue I’d think—it contains an opaque filesystem. This is convenient for a lot of reasons: editing, transporting, searching.

I have started a prototype for an idea I have—I will report back to you next week with some results. If I can somehow get access to some snapshots (say the last month’s worth)—that would be very useful.
<<<

My letter is clearly late! =)

For the most part, I've constructed my TW in such a way that it could be statically served as individual pages linked to each other.<<ref "th">> I think it's cool that a wiki my size can be served statically and lose so little of its functionality, but my static goal is to maintain performance and the ability to parse the html file with ease. I've worked hard not to trap myself in Tiddlywiki, though further commitment to this tool may eventually force me to drop those properties (I'm fighting against it right now). I am increasingly convinced the moves toward dynamic content will lock me in.

I can decompile this wiki and serve small static files at lightning speed with CDNs, no TLS negotiation, and compression. But, I really don't want to do that; I'm bending over backward not to do that. I'm aiming to serve a unified document as much as possible. I want the html file to be identical across every network I serve it, and I don't want individual pages decontextualized from the whole. In many senses, I want to sign one thing.

Everyone else I've seen goes nodejs (a redflag on my part; I may very well be wrong). I may be forced to do so as well. Serving directly from nodejs is also strong (though it makes things more complicated with signatures). I have not yet tried https://github.com/OokTech/TW5-Bob, but the two-way syncing solves a very serious problem for me. Trying to move away from the realtime serving of this wiki may also be worthwhile.

<<<
I mentioned in my last comment wanting a month's worth of snapshots - but it's now clear to me where I can get them. ;) Disregard.
- kicks
<<<

Your [[tool|https://www.kickscondor.com/taming-outlandish-tiddlywikis]] is amazing! Thank you for making it! Also, I adore the ASCII animation! 

I think you are the first person to have really cared about my snapshot collection at all. Versioning individual tiddlers appears more important to TW users than wholehog TW versioning (and, I don't see why). I'm still coming to grips with what your creations means. It's fascinating. You clearly appreciate my goal to keep the wiki unified as a single document. The caching and versioning of your tool is very cool. I'm still thinking about where I'm going with it.

<<<
And I’m not eager for him to abandon this wiki to another system—and I’m not sure he can.
<<<

I'm not eager to either. I agree that I can't maintain every property of the system I want in any available alternative. Once we start peeling apart my creative workspace from the end-product into two different environments, it becomes more possible (though, still painful). Until recently, this wiki has been "just a bunch of links" in a way; but, I'm growing convinced I must invest more in the TW mechanics. I think there is something special about both the writer and the audience sitting in the same pilot's seat. I hope in time I will learn how to shape how I'm thinking about my wiki in a way that other's would prefer since that is an application of [[The Golden Rule]]. This is likely a very long-term project.

<<<
Ok, yes, so it does have one other feature: it works with the browser cache.
<<<

That makes sense. Ironically, I've actually had to fight the browser cache before. Real-time updates to my wiki have mattered many, many times. 

<<<
This means that if you load snapshot #623 and then load #624, it will not reload the entire wiki all over again—just the changes.
<<<

This is a huge problem for me, and it's only going to get worse as my wiki grows. I am grateful to your thoughtful consideration of this problem. It may force me to give up a few things (I can't have everything I want). The load times are a non-trivial problem. ~~A couple thoughts which may demonstrate my complete ignorance:~~

* ~~I care about {[[Verify]]}. That doesn't mean I've built it well or correctly. But it's important to me that I can sign my wiki. This wiki is epicly portable, and I think signing makes good sense. Your tool makes signatures a bit more complicated, and I ask for your advice.~~
** ~~I've considered having a script which just strips out the signature and then verifies. ~~
** ~~Some of these problems are more easily solved with nightly releases than real-time signed releases.~~
* ~~I like that when you save a copy of my wiki and you get an exact copy of what I have on my end.~~

I appreciate how your tool is designed with decentralization in mind. In the perfect world, I walk up to my browser, edit, autosave with versioning, it gets signed, and its diff + signature is disseminated across the swarm. You can open it in an app, from the CLI, or in your browser. You effortlessly choose how many resources you devote to sharing the content (if it runs as a background process or when you actively using it, etc.). Beaker-Browser is a very cool step in the right direction; I'm worried it is dead in the water until Google would agree it integrate it beyond an extension (and, I'm not so convinced they will). Implementing dead simple cross-platform mutable torrents is a hard problem (especially with the amount of immoral NATing and ISP resistance to rollout ipv6 [which I can only hope will change]). Decentralizing tools disempower those with the resources to thoroughly build them in the first place. I know there are proprietary tools designed for decentralizing HUGE amounts of data in corporate datacenters that do this well, but there aren't tools designed for everyday people to collectively own their data together, to share resources with each other, etc. (though they are in the works). Until then, we have to continue to DIY. Thank you! 

<<<
I realize you’re writing a draft 😉 but I’m going to say make a few squeaks and then go back to work.
<<<

I appreciate your responding to my draft. It is difficult to write to someone who is not committed to their words just yet, and I appreciate your boldness and willingness to be charitable in thinking about my bubbling thoughts. I think it's neat, and it shapes how I'm going to respond further. Cool. =)

<<<
So, {Verify} should actually be pretty trivial to add. Since the diffs are generated by [[this script|https://github.com/kickscondor/TiddlyWiki-loader/blob/master/kicksnap]], there would just need to be a step added to generate the .sig file (or add the hash to the .json file—the hash could be used by the loader to do the check there.) I will work on adding that soon—because my curiosity is peaked enough.
<<<

It might be better to go for an internal signature for snapshots. I'm increasingly convinced the signature shouldn't be external to the wiki, at least not for nightly. In a way, your tool is a second set of books. They are different files. Keeping the signature internal might just be the best way. I'm still thinking about it.

<<<
>    I fear I fail to T42T both you and kickscondor by failing to reciprocally build a useful tool for you. I’m trying to think of how I can contribute to your lives and art as much as you have for me. I apologize for not knowing how to do that. I feel inept like someone who doesn’t know how to buy a good Christmas present for their friend (and that makes me a bad friend). I don’t know you well enough to figure out how to create a gift that you’ll love and use. I’m sorry! I’m thinking about it.

So I think this is one of the possible misprojections of T42T—it leaves someone in ‘debt’. It is a very rational approach to relationships, because it reduces the interaction to numerical totals. But those numbers are very hard to derive—how much is the script I wrote worth? 2T? 3T? 16T? And how much are the thorough, immensely thoughtful replies that you write? Is that 2T? 53T?
<<<

I believe I understand much of your argument (and you imply that). I am grateful for your articulation. I hold your thinking in high regard; you take [[The Moral Law]] seriously. I have been thinking about your words here for a while.

You are right; it may be a misprojection. I am hypersensitive and paranoic about it. Insofar as there is asymmetry that you are generously offering me, I am especially grateful. I know I cannot always pay it back, and I'm exceptionally moved by gifts given to the helpless in the desert. It is the brightest, most ideal implementation of [[The Golden Rule]] in the [[T42T]] algorithm. Escaping mere reciprocal altruism is the goal. I think you point that out nicely.

To address your excellent argument: of course, I am not convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am in your debt. A fear, like mine, is not always warranted. I agree my replies have some value. It may be that we are trading skills; it's clear, for example, you strongly have a competitive advantage in computing. I also aim to be hedged-conservative here, shooting for the center of the will of [[The Moral Law]] rather than the minimal edges. It can also appear reasonable to argue that you've offered these gifts without an explicit or implied agreement that I would be transacting with you in gift-giving beyond recognizing your generosity. Also, on a different note, I'd like to add that you give pseudonymously, and I think highly of pseudonymous and anonymous giving. Perhaps on these grounds, there's no cooperation to concern myself with at all beyond a "thank you." I am open to the possibility there I'm not obligated to offer any major "tat" for your stunning "tit." 

It's impolite for us to say we are trading our resources out loud with each other in gift-giving since it appears to denigrate the act and motivation in many contexts. The moment you call it reciprocation, you've already turned it into a quantified economic game; the faithful romantic qualitative narrative appears tarnished when we ludologize it. I do not wish to reduce us to mere numbers (and insofar as [[The Good]] is real, I suggest that isn't conceptually possible either), though I think we must empirically model. I aim to be explicit about how we weigh each other's ends together in our heuristical distributed computing implementation of [[The Golden Rule]]. I know quantification of the ineffable has its limits, but I must pragmatically try anyways.

[[T42T]] can only be quantified so far; we're [[fff]]. There is a correct way in each context to quantify or learn to quantify. There are reasons to work on quantifying this. I understand many of the virtue-theoretic difficulties in codificationism; it is an inescapable problem. Though you do not deny it, I want to point out that denying the codification, the computability, is to deny cognitivism and even the possibility of rationally attempting to handle the problem. I know we are in an inductive territory even for implementing it.

<<<
Oh and: does 2T literally mean double? Or is it just a bit step beyond single T?
<<<

Obviously, I need to rewrite [[T42T]]. That said, I think I have made ample room for the ambiguity and problem you're concerned with. I do not know the answer here. It is an ancient question.

You talk about it as doubling. That is a fascinating way to do it. I think traditional [[T42T]] is about forgiving someone for failing to cooperate. I take it that [[T4T]] is about cooperation upon some implicitly understood standard. If I give you 1mbit, then on both [[T4T]] and [[T42T]], I'm expecting for you to give me 1mbit (rather than 2mbit). 

On [[T42T]], if I give you 1mbit and you fail to give me 1mbit back, then on the next iteration of the game, I still commit to cooperating with you, giving you 1mbit, in the hopes that your previous failure to cooperate was an accidental mistake, a miscommunication, or just a temporary problem. The second attempt at cooperation past the initial failure is what makes it the 2T. Even if you never pay me back that previous 1mbit, we can continue to cooperate. It's forgiving.

Growing how much we trade in our iterations might be another issue. I do not know. Maybe I don't have more than 1mbit to trade, and in that case, I am not failing to cooperate by failing to scale up to 2mbit with you (assuming the reason I don't have more than 1mbit to trade is morally permissible). Ought implies can. Of course, I think many people can, they just don't. I think what we owe to each other extends beyond what we explicitly consent to, so scaling up may, in fact, be part of my obligation in exercising [[The Golden Rule]].

<<<
And–what is T? Does T represent “your last set of actions” in our relationship? So, if you just pulled off a 2T (doubled my T)—T is now 2T, expanding 2T into 4T from now on.
<<<

I do not know the answer to your excellent question, though I have tried to make room for my ignorance. I'm trying to communicate a qualitative selfless [[Golden Rule]] (do not make an exception of yourself) in a selfish language. How do you describe blue to someone who perceives primarily green?

Typically, the T is concerned with the last iteration, but I think the rule may be far more complex, as you imply. The doubling/scaling up issue adds yet another layer of complexity here. I suggest doubling probably doesn't occur until trust is built on 1T. The Bittorrent algorithm and implementations may be instructive to us; some clients are paranoic in trying to seed as hard as they can. Sharing computing resources, both silicon and wetware, is at the heart of what I want us to do, so I'd be very interested to learn more about your thoughts on this topic.

<<<
My take is that T is simply a ‘neutral’ action. It is a token of cooperation—it is not measured. I realize that 2T and perhaps even plain T imply a measurement, but I think that (might be wrong) measurement requires too much maintenance and is too difficult to sync (how do we keep our measurement identical?) so I see T as ‘neutral’ and 2T as simply ‘positive’—it will be hard enough for us (humans) to agree on the polarity of a T. So maybe let’s start there.
<<<

Again, you offer an excellent argument. I have no effective answer. I think I can only extend your reasoning here in agreement.

I can appreciate the desire for neutrality, though I'm not convinced we can escape measurement. If we spend all our time trying to quantify cooperation, we'll never actually enjoy just cooperating with each other. This is part of the risk/cost-analysis that has to be quantified. Quantification of qualitative intangibles becomes infeasible. At some point, taking the unquantified token as your quantification is a necessary trusting shortcut. It is faith in [[The Other]], and in the end, even [[The Golden Rule]] requires faith; we must formally beg the question at the bottom.

As you point out, we are still going to need a standard for when we define something as cooperating. If I respond to your letters with one word answers, I'm offering a token. You cannot escape measuring reality to some very large extent. I think this is part of our plight. Yet, the goal is to not be overly quantitative (where, unfortunately, "overly" is quantitative).

I agree we must accept inexactness, give and take, and room for asymmetry. That is part of the forgiveness of [[T42T]] on display to me. It is better to be hedged-conservative in applying the neutral label in many cases, but not all.

<<<
This way a simple ‘thank you’ for a massive gift can still be T42T. (If I were to remove the numerals: I might look at T4T as //neutral-for-neutral// and T42T as //neutral-or-positive-for-positive//. The question then becomes how to derive a polarity for an action—which brings us back to ‘the moral imperative’ and ‘the golden rule’ and the rest of THAT discussion that you are having.)
<<<

You build and negotiate our perception of [[The Right]] with me, Sir Kickscondor. I do not normally touch people, but I'd put my hand on your shoulder to say it to you: ''thank you''.

<<<
I’ve also read [[Grim Trigger|T42T: Grim Trigger]], but I’m not talking about a recovery strategy in case T42T becomes malignant—this about how to do it in a realistic but generous way. To live it sustainably in a relationship like ours (it’s a tentative, nascent arrangement; but I think we both just want to make it work long-term.)
<<<

Indeed, long-term friendship is the goal.

It's interesting to talk about [[T42T]] as malignant. To my eyes, it's about the justification for drawing the moderating lines of forgiveness [[irwartfrr]].  It can be excessively forgiving (e.g. not respecting your own dignity; paradoxically, selflessness requires understanding a collective value of yourself, and this means you have to value yourself to some selfish degree as a consequence). It can be deficiently forgiving too (e.g. people can change). I look through my life and feel like my model of forgiveness has been wrong (in both directions in various contexts); I am radically not virtuous here. This is part of why I have decided to more objectively model my relationships out loud. It is something I am actively exploring.

<<<
At any rate, I hope that riffing on your thoughts counts as a plus; your thankyous are sufficient and your generous replies are 2T always!
<<<

Indeed, it is a plus. I am extremely grateful to you for taking my thoughts so seriously.

Much has transpired since I started writing this letter. I'd like to address many things going back through your content. I'm going to cherry-pick stuff from your site. This is rapidfire, in no particular order, and completely disjointed.

https://www.kickscondor.com/sphygmus/

But a TiddlyWiki like this is attempting to solve personal interaction by—well, it’s not trying to solve personal interaction.
<<<

I think that's largely true. There's a way in which TW usually forces the audience to see through the author's eyes, sitting in the pilot's seat (though, this can be changed). That said, TW is fairly flexible and can be tailored (if you wanted to put in the work) to look like almost anything. I think even your site could be emulated in TW. Also, TW federation and Comments have been in development for a while. I think TW is not always agnostic though; you have to build bridges from its system to others (but, I think that is getting easier).

<<<
 I confess that I’ve also started a personal TiddlyWiki to store all these same kinds of materials.
<<<

I'm obviously curious to know what you are doing with it, where you think it's going, and your gut instincts about its internals.

The more interesting question is: how long will the web platform live on for? How long will HTML and JavaScript stay on? 
<<<

I would like to know where you think WASM is going to take the web. What will this mean for the indieweb? I cannot see far enough here (my worry is that it be used to centralize power, yet another step towards mainframe computing and dummy terminals). It appears there may be careful holepunching through the VM to the underlying OS too.

<<<
Furthermore, since static HTML is so perfectly amenable to the decentralized Web—isn’t it possible that those absolute links could become UNBREAKABLE out there??
<<<

Technically, yes. I've been torrenting for a long time now, and I think that finding effective systems for motivating seeding ain't easy. You may have large, central repositories like archive.org doing work (even with torrents), but that isn't really decentralizing well enough. I think this is possible, but I think it requires developing a system where everyone participates and automatically seeds. I consider such a mechanism to actually be necessary for building effective e-voting systems for democracy as well (we must own the means of production).

<<<
Static within; dynamic without. Yin and yang. (But I call Yin!)

Unfortunately, I am strongly feeling the pull of yang this round. I have resisted, but it's starting to gobble me up. I'm still working with [[j3d1h]] to identify a hybrid method.

<<<
https://www.kickscondor.com/indieweb-xyz-difficult-or-silo/

In a way, it’s a silo—a central info container. Silos make it easy. You go there and dump stuff in. But, here in the Indieweb, we want No Central. We want Decentral. Which is more difficult because all these little sites and blogs out there have to work together—that’s tough!
<<<

I'm that pedantic asshole that worries every site is definitionally a silo unless it is completely distributed, but even that seems incorrect. When I hit major sites, I'm usually connecting to multiple servers, downloading different objects from different servers simultaneously; the server just is distributed across many servers in many cases. 

I think a silo is more about the centralization of power over that data. Who owns it, can access it, modify it, distribute it, and repurpose it? When only some of the data stored is allowed to be exposed, that seems especially siloish to me.

<<<
We are a long way off from solving abuse on our websites. We desperately want technology to solve this. But it is a human problem. I am starting to believe that the more we solve a problem with technology, the more human problems we create.
<<<

I'm especially concerned with censorship. Filtering for salience is like censorship, but I take it there is an element of informed consent (whatever that quagmire means). The Hubski model (there are couple others like it) is fascinating to me. My preference is to leverage trust I've built with others to build patches of filtering. I want to be able to burst out of my filterbubbles, but I also want to be able to shape them (I want to have my cake and eat it too). I think it would take quite a bit of automation to help humans leverage trust in each other for constructing filters together. 

Take Reddit. I'm forced to use this aggregator. I don't want 5 all-powerful mods shaping a sub, I want to choose who my mods are, and I want to make use of the mods they choose by proxy. (Always with the wanting to have his cake and eat it too, this one: Ai-yai-yai)

I view these kinds of personal directories as the connecting tissue of the Web. They are pure linkage, connecting the valuable parts. And they, in the sense that they curate and edit this material, are valuable and generous works.

That's part of why I'm reaching out. I think I have to shotgun explore the breadth to find those with whom I can build a relationship of depth. Maybe it's like online-based dating. This also reminds me of arbitrage in vidya games, particularly back in the day before Auction Houses existed. As sad as it sounds, I'm trying to sell myself to others, to convince others that I'm worth their time. I aim to do so with integrity.

After looking at TBL’s ‘Solid’ for several hours—I don’t follow. It is a ‘personal data store’—but it seems awfully complex.

https://www.kickscondor.com/finding-blogs-in-the-future/

My part in this is: I have been spending time every day for the past six months searching for blogs - to see what the Web looks like outside of social networks. So I have a good perspective on where one can search nowadays - you can’t just type ‘blogs’ into Google. And I’m starting to get a good feel for where I would want to go to find blogs.
<<<

I'd be interested to see that process made explicit and see it evolve. You do mention a few things (e.g. pinboard), but I'm still interested in how to search for that which is not meant to be found. This is a non-trivial concern not just for blogs. I'd like to understand the systematic reasoning necessary not just for finding blogs, but perhaps searching for things which aren't monetized into oblivion.

You and Brad continue to work on a difficult problem here.

And not so they will become the new elite. But because I think we can benefit from each other’s attention. There is much to explore in this world.

That sounds like anti-classism to me. Attention is power, but you imply that with "new elite." I agree that we benefit from thinking about and with each other.

https://www.kickscondor.com/comments/robot-plus-human/

I’m starting to categorize the ‘blogging’ and ‘wiki-ing’ actions under the superset called ‘hypertexting’. Both are about simply writing hypertexts, but blogs arrange those texts in a linear summary and wikis arrange them as a web which starts from a single entry point. (And a self-contained hypertext book or directory would be a tree.)
<<<

I dig the hypertext umbrella. I'm actually annoyed when people call my wiki a blog, since it is obviously not that to me. Of course, the fool in me starts wondering what exactly on the web doesn't count as hypertexting? What doesn't have a single entry point? One of the things I like about TW is that I can arrange a storyriver and link directly to that river for someone. I want to be able to make a unique storyriver for any occasion, though I usually just have a single tiddler in mind.

<<<
Ok ok, one other thing that has dawned on me: it’s not just the emergent connections between writers that is salient when clustering. It’s the connections between readers as well! (This is one thing that Google cannot possibly capture.)
<<<

I'm sorry, kicks: I ask you to slow down for me because I fear I have misunderstood like a pedantic weasel. A lot of sites appear to provide signals to Google, Cloudflare, etc. of what you are reading (or they can make fairly decent guesses). Chrome users are especially mined for this, and I'm pretty disturbed by the (hopefully slim) possibility that Mozilla's Pocket behavior will move towards this well. Why should I agree Google can't capture it? I'm pretty sure they do capture this information, even if they don't algorithmically connect the dots well enough yet. I will agree their incentives may be a problem here. I think they are trying to cluster readers, identifying what the readers want and what maximizes Google's profit. I know you know all of what I've said and more, so I must be missing something obvious.

<<<
Particularly in a world which is becoming dominated by writers rather than readers - maybe the discovery of valuable readers is part of this.
<<<

When you say this, I think that's just what the business of advertisement has become. Of course, monetary value is not the only kind. [[FTO]] aims to find valuable readers in a way, though I'm trying to find valuable writers as well (hard to correspond if it ain't a two-way street). Alright, well, I need to think more about this, clearly. You have an interesting point.

You know, I think most people just aren't curious enough to click around and explore. Ain't nobody got time fo' dat. Curiosity requires temporarily assuming a flattening of the links on the web, assuming that they are more equal in value to you than usual. Only then do you have reason to think it is more worthwhile to shotgun and click on random stuff than you usually might. When we seek salience unfittingly, when exploration isn't a habitual aspect of our curation model, anything we aren't familiar with is a risky click and too often a waste of our time.

I like HBO shows because the signal-to-noise is safely high. Adult Swim has enormous variance, either being among my favorite shows or absolute garbage. I'm looking to get stuck, but I shouldn't. At this point, I don't even watch a show unless a friend advises me to do so. There are no recommendation engines that work for me besides that. Like an asshole, I rely upon the explorers to do the dirty work. I think that's one of the reasons I hold your work in such high regard. You are correct: finding salience is a human thing (at least for now).

Also, I have a book you might just take a quick peek at. I'm not claiming the book is correct, but you might find it interesting. [[On the Internet|http://download1.libgen.io/ads.php?md5=64B41E50347A2769D49F0A8391BE4BD8]] by Hubert Dreyfus.

https://www.kickscondor.com/hypertexting/

the superset distinction allow us to draw attention to the ‘body’ rather than the blog ‘post’ or the wiki ‘page’ and to ask: ‘what are we creating here?’
<<<

That seems to scream the concept of emergence.

<<<
how do I begin to approach your giant monolith of hypertext beyond just reading your two or three latest posts?
<<<

It's not just how you approach it; I cannot answer that question effectively enough even for myself. This hypertext has rapidly evolved for me, and it's still evolving at a pace that is hard to maintain. I cannot see far enough. I see myself having to generate a lot of different approaches to this hyperobject. I can never see the entire elephant at once; I have to use different perceptual lenses and tools to be effectively reductive about it.

<<<
The home page is definitely the curated entry point.
<<<

I think we are in agreement.

But, I think it's a worthy question to ask: curated by whom and for whom? My personal homepaged/bookmarked entry point isn't what many folks see atm: https://philosopher.life/#Root:Root%20%5B%5BLegal%20Notice%5D%5D (and you have your own bookmarks). I think if you look through [[FTO]], my letters to people are meant to be the initial entry points for each of them. However one chooses to build and focus the storyriver in their link to this hyperobject constitutes a curated entry point.<<ref "eg">> This issue may extend much further.

As you seem to indicate, curation appears to be something any agent can be engaged in here. Hypertext extends beyond the html file I send you when your browser settings, tools, and extensions modify and curate the experience as well (e.g. I won't even touch Reddit [and it's spidering onto the rest of the web] without half a dozen tweaks and tools; it's not worth my time).

<<<
 But it’s not just that entry point that’s important—the points that go deeper from there are important. h0p3’s home page was initially the most important thing to me. But now it’s the ‘recent changes’ page and the bookmarks I have that indicate where I intend to next explore further.
<<<

Cool. I think it's fair to say that's roughly my intention, as you'll find in {[[Help]]}. I take the [[APFVD]] epistemic structure to be primitive in some crucial respect, and once you realize how it telicly fits in [[Root]], I think the goal is to move to the sidebar to scaffold, explore, and more effectively hyperread this hypertextual hyperobject.<<ref "hy">> I'm not in a great position to tell you how best to read it; I think that depends on your context. I grant, however, that some methods are better than others. What counts as finding relevance in our hyperreading in general is some ridiculously hard problem (library scientists are famous for discussing this, but it's also clearly philosophical to me: [[The Salience]]). Refraining from justification and prescription to whatever [[dok]] I can here: it's probably fair to say most people will quickly run out of things worth reading on this wiki (if they found anything).

Also, hopefully only for the next few months (who am I kidding, probably years), I think you'll have a slightly hard time using [[Recent]] during [[The Remodeling]]. For most of this wiki's life, however, it's been an excellent tool.

<<<
 Sometimes he is a blog, sometimes he is a wiki. Sorry, man!
<<<

I suggest I've not been clear enough. There are obviously many blogs in this wiki (I'm not even sure how to count them). The majority of tiddlers are datestamped, but even that is somehow irrelevant at some level. What cannot be sequenced in time (especially with my snapshots)? Taking these concepts to the limit: anything represented in hypertext over time is a blog, and any amount of hypertext is a wiki. It's all hypertext. Categories of hypertext appear to be mere constructions. What is this construction other than the intentions of the author and audience? I cannot satisfyingly fix these classic problems, but I do not aim to be anti-realist, internalist, or merely constructivist about it. 

See, I don't mind your phrasing here. You see this growing object; you've explored it, and even how you approach it evolves. It is not merely a blog to either of us, even though we both often take up that perspective in how we use it.

I am blown away that you have any doubt about this. Karmawhores, advertisers, and social media professionals have a staggering array of methods for consistently manipulating multiple aspects of the media we consume, and that's not even talking about the legal and external pressures they can apply to publishers. These people aren't even the most dangerous either! I refuse to accept that you haven't personally witnessed shilling, trolling, botting, astroturfing, sockpuppets, COINTELPRO techniques, psyops, memetic weapons, and propaganda. 

Manipulators treat the minds of others as mere means; they do not respect your dignity. Satya Nadella is a manipulator. Does that mean he and a cabal of powerful deep state actors have conspired to control every little detail of your mind? No. But, the science of rhetoric, mass manipulation, and our ability as a species to produce increasingly effective apex predators only continues to rise. Power centralizes at any cost, including moral ones.

Algorithms are instruments. Instruments for what? They are means to some end, but what end?

What is undermining? One undermines a telos, a purpose, a foundation, an end goal. Why undermine? It seems undermining is also purposeful. What telos //should// you have in mind? Is it simply what its creator intends? Is it what the intellectual property "owner" intends? Is it what the majority of users intend? Is it what you personally seek? Jumping ahead: is it [[The Beautiful]]? Is it [[The Right]]? Is it [[The Good]]? 

What are games except for sets of rules we play by to win? What should you aim to win and how? What games and experience machines are most real and meaningful? What is the point of upvoting or any narrative? What do you mean by "design" here; designed for what? Why does any process exist? What is the real "for the sake of which" of each algorithm, and what is [[The Telos]] to which all structures and algorithms point?

I cannot help but point to the point of all points, my friend. `/point` - that's the point.

Sincerely,
