Percy is correct to point out that we feel the "nought," the emptiness, the need to add to ourselves, to need to fill that void, etc. This is part of the dialectic, and it's also part of the existential crisis we see running through a number of excellent philosophers. 

I can't say the fashion chapter fits me, but I've long been redpilled and directly opposed to our natures in this respect (since a child). 

One of my beefs with Percy is that his multiple choice answers are deeply incomplete. I think there are salient options he fails to include. I consider this a form of rhetoric. The problem with parody, of course, is that it's guerrilla warfare. You get to make your minor philosophical assault and then run for cover behind the "it's all a joke, right?" defense.
