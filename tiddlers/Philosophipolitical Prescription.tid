title: Philosophipolitical Prescription

// Reconstruction must follow deconstruction. It is our practical, metamodern human plight.//

[[Realpolitik Speculation]] is destructive, even if constructively so in crucial ways. Destruction is a necessary condition to rebuilding or modifying an object.<<ref "1">> Thus, despite the negative connotations of destruction, I still think it is outstanding. However, while that approach is necessary for empathy and being a good citizen of Humanity, it is not sufficient. Essentially, the problem with [[Realpolitik Speculation]] is how little prescription it provides. 

Wisdom takes both recognizing //what not to do// (the easy part) and having the more penetrating salient moral perception to realize //what to do//.<<ref "2">> While I grant [[Realpolitik Speculation]] provides some prescription in various contexts, particulars, cases, and respects, it still doesn't give a systematic prescription. What is the moral code of the universe, and how can we be practical with in it the political realm?

Of course, this has to be one of the hardest sections of philosophy to write upon. But, it is pragmatically necessary that we generate prescriptions for ourselves. Having a moral code for ourselves is prudentially wise. 

* Be clear with targets of rights and duties, the Hohfeldian relationships, as best as you can.
* Utilitarian arguments are often the easiest to make. 
* Virtue-theoretic ones require a powerful enough narrative to inspire the emotions of the virtuous agent in ourselves.<<ref "3">> 
* I will not be able to offer prescriptions that will make everyone happy, probably not even most. I just have to try and find the most rational prescription I can. That's the best I can do.

I seek to pragmatically solve the philosophipolitical equations about humanity for the sake of humanity. Essentially, I'm trying to pragmatize utopia. This will be absurdly difficult. Be willing to be wrong most of the time!

<<footnotes "1" "I'm even convinced that merely 'adding' to an object has a destructive property to it.">>

<<footnotes "2" "One might also make the case that wisdom isn't very wise at all if it is isn't implement, executed, and acted upon. We must question whether or not it even counts as wisdom if it doesn't motivate us. It depends on the degree to which the maxim can truly be separated from the virtuous agent's habituation, etc.">>

<<footnotes "3" "We must abide by the fact that the Virtue Ethicists simply don't have to play by the same rules as everyone else. Their work is clearly profoundly accurate in crucial ways. Since we have no solutions to [[Unify Metaethics|2017.04.14 - Unifying Metaethics]], we must accept it as a reasonable possibility (at least to some degree, shape, and kind). How it is that these fit together, and why do we take them to be so powerful and necessary to unify?">>
