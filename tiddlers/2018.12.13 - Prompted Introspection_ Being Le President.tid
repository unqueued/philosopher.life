title: 2018.12.13 - Prompted Introspection: Being Le President

!! What would you do to change the country and the world for the better if you were elected president?

I dismissed the question here: [[2018.04.05 - Prompted Introspection Log: If I Were President]]. I hate to say it, but I don't have much more to add to it. I think when you elect a president you are electing an entire staff as it relates to a number of groups. I believe I would be a lame duck, and I am doubtful many people would be interested in building an organization with me (or, I doubt we could be an effective one). 

I suppose my goal as a President would be to push for a way to decentralize the executive powers. Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to be a direct Presidential power.

I think I'd make a terrible leader. I can barely lead myself.
