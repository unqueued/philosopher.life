title: 2018.04.28 - Prompted Introspection Log: Human Disease

!! Which disease known to humankind do you hate the most? Explain why.

Define disease. There are profound metaethical assumptions one must make in order to effectively engage in epidemiology. You think you know it when you see it, but that doesn't mean you're justified.

I can't say I know the answer. Pressed to answer, I would argue about maladaptivity [[gfwiwcgws]]. I'm willing to interpret significant perfectionist, particularistic, telic normativity onto humankind, obviously. There is flourishing as a homo sapiens in our contexts today. That is not meaningless or relativistic to me. Dasein is really what matters about us, and on that view, I think memetic considerations are therefore the most profound kinds of diseases. These memes, however, are found in both our hardware and software. I cannot peel apart the nature vs. nature issue either. 

The family of psychopathic memeplexes are the diseases I hate most. I think they make us worse persons; unifying us into evil things. I think the world is wildly worse off because of it. It runs deep in evolved nature. Social Darwinian descriptions of psychological egoism are at the heart of pointing out what I really don't like about who we are. It's the truth though.
