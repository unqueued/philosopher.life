How is [[k0sh3k]]!?
JAN 4 9:51 PM
She's doing good. Working hard. Personally, I think it's unfair that she seems to do almost all the work at that library.
JAN 4 9:51 PM
I'm glad she loves her job (it gives her purpose).
JAN 4 9:51 PM
Definitely I feel like I’m in the same boat :woman-rowing-boat: we just are hard working people no matter what anyone else is doing
