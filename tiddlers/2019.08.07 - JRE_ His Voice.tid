title: 2019.08.07 - JRE: His Voice

My brother called me! The baby is doing great. Rebecca keeps telling him to go relax in many cases. This makes sense to me (though I usually have something else to say to fathers I've known). Sleep schedules are looking reasonable. It felt so good to hear his voice. 

My brother's Project Manager and Foreman said he was hilarious but lived a sad life (after watching one suck up to the other about sports without enjoying sports). My brother takes it to heart. I am glad my brother has the ability to not take himself too seriously (while still being existentially dead serious where it counts), to laugh at absurdity, to take a joke, etc. Indeed, there are sad parts of his life. I hold him in esteem though. Few people achieve depth like my brother. Those guys have no idea what they are missing in my brother.

We talked about WoW. He's worried I'm done. I don't know what to do, but I'm excited to play with him. My brother is totally cool with us trying to duo (which is awesome), and he's going to try to find stuff for us to do (I'm bad at it). I talked about the build. Testing shows the test dummies and people in worldchat have no idea what they are saying. We're forced to figure out the mechanics ourselves. If builds were free, I'd have no problem. 

I PLed him for a bit. I think the build and method makes sense when you see it. Note, his single target was even remotely in the same ballpark as mine, and that's 9 levels below me. I don't like that not great single-target DPS. It feels wrong.
