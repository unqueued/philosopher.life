title: 2018.09.30 - Self-Dialectic: Hegel or Marx

I am having a debate with myself about whether or not to go down the Hegel or Marx rabbitholes full force. It seems like the Metaphysical Dialectic vs Material Dialectic is what I'm really after. There is a theory vs. practice spectrum here, and what kind of dialectic I'm interested in handling is ultimately unclear to me. If I'm allowed to use that information here (still in doubt), and I think I inescapably must, then clearly I will need to attempt to balance learning and debating these two inside me fairly. They must cooperatively inform each other until their is Respecting Reason sublation.

I've been talking with my wife about this, though I've not stated it exactly that way before.
