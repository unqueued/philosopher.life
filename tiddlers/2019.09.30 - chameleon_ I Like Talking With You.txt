[4:33 AM] chameleon: how are you enjoying the music from the wiki?
[4:34 AM] h0p3: It's a chance to explore. I think my favorite so far has been Exterminio - Ordem E Progresso.
[4:35 AM] chameleon: haha, yeah, that's a banger. I used to be really into south american thrash metal, so it's a blast from the past for me. the whole album is pretty good if you like the first track
