title: 2019.07.29 - Prompted Introspection: Losing My Religion

!! Has religion played a role in your life? How?

Yeah, I've been a bit religious. You might say I dabble here and there. I guess you could say it's had some influence in my life in terms of radically defining the core of my [[4DID]] and vocation. I'm religious about my telos.

I've responded to this question before: [[2017.11.28 - Prompted Introspection Log: Religion in My Life]]. Correction, I am religious and spiritual at some level. I tried to escape it, but there's no escaping it.<<ref "a">> I was just flat wrong to deny it before. The rest of my argument is fine, ^^right?^^ 

One thing has struck me about [[kicks]]' religion: it's of and about people. He might want to deny that claim for some reason, but that is his central tentpeg thus far, goddess bless him. I can only [[hope]] to be such a well-directed madman.

My donors would refer to my moves here as "buffet religion." It serves as both an attack on relativism (which to a significant [[dok]] I have always agreed with) and an appeal to sticking to a single ingrouped tradition. It's not like I don't study the traditions and views of others. I respect many Saints, both the living and the dead. I'm forced to seek the [[salience]] in the desert in which I find myself. God, I hope I can do it [[irwartfrr]].
