title: 2019.12.13 - DeathOfRobinhood: Community

Ended up using Google Voice because Signal was being finicky. 

As usual, I can't recall my voice conversations well enough. We talked about moving, what it's like to live in the same area for most of one's life, the different kind of relationships which arise from wikis, building community with the people around us, alienation, the diversity of people in his church, my anxieties about my offspring's futures, connecting with people who share similar interests, the difficulty of pursuing a significant other (the rarity of commitment).

I think one of my favorite parts of speaking with DeathOfRobinhood is his gentleness (and, I mean, more than just a Canadian politeness). He's deft in how he handles my abruptness and awkwardness, kind in his inspection, and goes out of his way to listen more than he speaks. I think I do a terrible job of asking him questions and learning who he is. One of my goals here: I need to just listen and let him do the talking. He can hear what I think any day, but it's my chance to hear him. This is like my relationship with my brother, wherein the best use of our opportunity is for me to shoot for 30-40% of the speaking on average. As usual, I am not hedged-conservative enough.

He offers reasonable pushback. I like that we clarify and bridge together.

It's fascinating to me how he is both hyperfocused on what matters most and yet superchill. That's something I need to learn to do better. It's practical reason in him; he's pragmatic.
