!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The rich will do anything for the poor but get off their backs.
<<<

It's hyperbolic. At face value, almost all the wealthy people I've met want to feel like they are [[good]] people who do the [[right]] thing to some extent (at least sufficiently good). Psychological egoism subverts the motivations of everything fairly easily, perhaps into ad hoc territory in some cases. I can't tell you how molecules of altruism arise from evolution, but I also take freewill on [[faith]]. No, I have seen wealthy people perform kind acts (though not actions of moral motivation all the way down). Of course, in the ultimate analysis, rich humans cannot maintain their wealth if they are being moral (and some don't), and being rich means you maintain [[dok]] of slavery in your society. If you aren't spending yourself for [[Humanity]], you are engaged in the will to [[power]] game.
