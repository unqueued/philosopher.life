title: 2018.11.01 - Prompted Introspection: Blind Ocean Description

!! Describe the ocean to a person who is blind.

I'm pleasantly surprised to see how many of these questions I've answered before: [[2018.01.30 - Prompted Introspection Log: Ocean Blindness]]. It's neat to see my progress snowball. That was a non-answer too.

Presumed blind from birth, I think it's ridiculously hard to describe what visualization is like to a blind person. Even blind people who know what cubes feel like cannot identify cubes when they gain sight. My description, somehow, just isn't good enough. I think description would need to be actually be injected into their mind somehow. We need not give them actual vision of the world, but vision of some virtual world with an ocean in it is likely the only way.
