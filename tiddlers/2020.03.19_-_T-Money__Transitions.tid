How's life going?
Mar 19 11:57am
Very odd. Lol. How about yours?
Mar 19 4:17pm
Yeah, staying odd.
Mar 19 4:29pm
Been intense.

Currently they are refusing to shut down our facility. But we are noticing that Toyota of Georgetown is shutting down. This is a non-union plant that never shuts down! It is like a clock never stop. They have now declare that shut down for 2 weeks.

So we have a few thousand where we work at and because we are federal contractors we are unsure of how we fit into this game. I'm pretty frustrated with the fact that I still have to go to work and this is going on. I'm out in public I'm 90 miles away from home. Working in very close proximity with lots and lots of other guys.

The president of the salsa program sent out an email and basically said that we were not shutting down because we have a commitment to the customer and deadlines to meet basically we have to deliver aircraft to the military. And if we had any issues to contact our manager for flexibility and that sort of thing. I think there's been a total of five guys sent home to be quarantine unknowing if they are infected

That is crazy. The transitions you have to go through during this period are spiky.

Well I officially received the job in Somerset. So I did put my two week notice in on  So I would like to work those two weekends out because my wife has been put out of work. Governor beshear's has closed down all hair and nail salons. So therefore she does not have an income. I don't start my new job until April 6th. So I'm not quite sure what to do other than just keep going to work and make money. We can survive without it but it's just again yeah spiky

Definitely puts you an odd position. I hope two weeks from now, it will be a weight off your shoulders.
Mar 19 4:43pm
I appriciate it. How are you all doing?
Mar 19 4:47pm
It has been intense. I do not like my predictions and reading. The world is in flux, and I am experiencing significant anxiety.
Mar 19 4:48pm
I agree with you on that. I'm afraid that the u.s. is not taking this serious enough. I'm driving everyday on the interstate and it is full of cars going both directions.
