title: 2018.08.04 -- Le Reddit Log: Reactionary Family

https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/94p68u/how_do_you_handle_reactionary_family/

Some issues are simply too big and emotional to communicate in person. I give them a chance to explore my mind by having them read my wiki (https://philosopher.life/). I find that the time and distance gives them a chance to formulate good questions or clearly demonstrate to me, as a kind of litmus test, that they aren't actually interested in trust-building cooperation (i.e. they don't want a respectful relationship in which we empathize with each other). You have to pick your battles, and I'm not going to waste my time. At this point, I choose my family. It has been costly in some respects, but well worth my time.
