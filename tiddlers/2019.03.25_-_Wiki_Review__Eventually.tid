title: 2019.03.25 - Wiki Review: Eventually

* [[2019.03.24 - Wiki Audit: Leak]]
** Another warning sign about Bob.
* [[2019.03.24 - Sphygmus: Interesting Error]]
** I still can't reproduce the error, but that is not shocking to me.
** I'm having enough trouble with Bob that I may switch back to single-file. Nothing has been surefire yet.
* [[2019.03.24 - Family Log: Goat Goat God]]
** Not my meme circus, not my memonkeys.
* [[2019.03.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Lenin]]
** Conveniently, most people consider it impossible.
* [[2019.03.24 - Prompted Introspection: Bone Flute]]
** Trudat. 
* [[2019.03.24 - Wiki Review: Rethinking]]
** I feel like I should cull some of [[Zizek]].
* [[2019.03.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sick]]
** It continues. =(
* [[2019.03.24 - TDL: Encourage]]
** Yeah, it's slow going.
* [[2019.03.18 - Tasha: Power Naps]]
** Sad that she won't even think about the truth.
* [[2019.03.19 - Tasha: At War]]
** Street girl is fighting for the wrong things.
* [[2019.03.24 - Tasha: 42]]
** She is proud of it. 
* [[2019.03.20 - AA: Good Good]]
** Sign.
* [[2019.03.22 - AA: Encouraging]]
** Ah, yes. It must be difficult to watch. She has the opportunity to show me where it's wrong here. It's not enjoyable for any of us, but it should not be ignored.
* [[2019.03.24 - AA: Weird Shift]]
** Still holding on.
* [[2019.03.24 - MB: Car]]
** Accidental, but the good kind.
* [[2019.03.18 - K: Sleep]]
** Mini-tag.
* [[2019.03.20 - K: Drag Out]]
** I hope it won't be a problem for him. There's little I can do but listen, I think.
* [[2019.03.21 - K: Adblock]]
** You rebel, you. =)
* [[2019.03.22 - K: Fight Club]]
** It is weird to connect with him more than [[L]], but I gladly accept the chance!
* [[2019.03.19 - T-Money: Fusion]]
** I hope he recovers quickly. He's trying to push himself physically when he shouldn't from the sounds of it.
* [[2019.03.21 - T-Money: Bored]]
** Not meditation or existential reasoning time for him; he just wants to stay busy, live in novelty to avoid thinking about what matters, etc.
* [[2019.03.23 - T-Money: Maymays]]
** That image needs tweaking.
* [[2019.03.24 - T-Money: Shims & Dialectic]]
** Sharp teeth are hazards.
* [[2019.03.20 - JRE: Foster]]
** I am worried he is going to struggle with a lack of freetime again.
* [[2019.03.23 - JRE: Cock Smurf]]
** I'm glad to see him chatting more with me.
* [[2019.03.24 - JRE: Service]]
** He's a man with a plan. He's so functional. It's wonderful.
* [[2019.03.24 - /b/]]
** Fragments. Gotta go somewhere. Onto the heap.
* [[Best of All Possible Voltaires]]
** All my giggles. 
** I fear the [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] makes me too relaxed. I fear I'm not being picky enough.
