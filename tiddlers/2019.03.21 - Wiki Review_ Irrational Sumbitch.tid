** It's good. Part of the problem may just be an issue of repetition for me. Perhaps that's what I really need to do: give these explored songs another pass to see which ones light up again. That's often why I like any song (you irrational sumbitch).

** Good. I'm glad he's still interested in talking. It is rare that I can call someone out that far down and they continue to speak with me. There's some integrity.
** Fascinating to connect this writing to the man I knew so many years ago.
