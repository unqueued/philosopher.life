title: 2012.09.27 - Autonomy: Christman Notes

Summary:

Christman begins by explaining some standard views on autonomy, in particular a model of autonomy based on lower and higher order based desires, and he then offers what appear to be standard criticisms of those views. He names three kinds of general criticism: the regress problem, the ab initio problem, and what he coins ‘the incompleteness problem.’ Christman claims that the standard theories fall to these criticisms largely because these models use a structural “time-slice” analysis to determine autonomy. His counterexamples to the standard views seems to point that out as well, as the these examples highlight how the models of autonomy provided by Dworkin and Frankfurt are based upon a historical manipulation that undermines autonomy. This historical kind of criticism, arguing against “time-slice” analysis, requires we understand the manner in which desires, values, and beliefs were formed. Christman’s claim is that by shifting the focus of inquiry about autonomy to the conditions for and process of preference formation, he can “eliminate the need for the condition of identification altogether” (10). By focusing upon preference formation, Christman believes he avoids the criticisms of the standard views.



Thoughts:

The criticisms of the standard view really do seem problematic. At the very least, Christman juices our intuitions for why we should be worried about more the “time-slice” approach, and why a historical analysis is a necessary component of a complete account of autonomy. I’m worried that Christman doesn’t actually solve the standard problems or really get away from them. And, even if Christman does avoid the regress and ab initio problems, it seems as though autonomy may end up being not really that important, valuable, or meaningful. What I think he’s done is provide more problems for a creating a viable account of autonomy, not fewer.

“no person is self-made in the sense of being a fully formed and intact 'will' blossoming out of nowhere” (1)

“the key element of autonomy is, in my view, the agent's acceptance or rejection of the process of desire formation or the factors that give rise to that formation, rather than the agent's identification with the desire itself.” (2)

“The preference that guides her action has itself been tainted by manipulation” (3)

Whole person = a person’s whole life – It is a historical identity (3)

“autonomy is a special property of preference or better formation and not merely a characteristic of a person's entire life” (4)

Identification - when an agent reflects critically on a desire and, at the higher level, approves of having the desire – one can either acknowledge or evaluate having that desire (2 kinds of identification)(5)

Acknowledging Sense of Identification allows us to identify with our non-autonomous, inauthentic parts of ourselves. In this way, identification appears to conflict with autonomy. (5)

Evaluative Sense of Identification extends acknowledgments to a kind of approval. The role of disapproval isn’t clear. (5-6)

Subservient example – FO (Lower Order) and SO (Higher Order) desires are consistent, she approves of the FO and identifies with them. Her SO desires, however, appear manipulated and conditioned. She appears to lack autonomy, even though she fits the requirements for Dworkin’s autonomy. Further, we see the higher order regress that we saw in Frankfurt. (6-7)

Ab initio problem – I need an explanation. From what I can gather, it is about the claim that we may be autonomous with respect to LODs, but not autonomous with respect to HODs. The problem is that it seems as if the HODs control the LODs, and the non-autonomy seems to trickle down to the LODs. What is radical choice? – “a desire cannot be autonomous if it was evaluated by a desire that was not itself autonomous.” (7)

So, essentially, there are two major problems, the regress and the ab initio. By attempting to avoid both, we need an explanation of how HOD evaluation is autonomous, but different than the autonomy of LOD evaluation – that is the incompleteness problem (7-8)

Regress – “Any account of rational action that presupposes that the desires that move an agent are 'accepted' by her will invite an infinite regress of desires in the explanation of this acceptance. For either a desire descended to the agent without her awareness or approval (which seems a troublesome basis for the rationality of action), or the agent was able to judge whether or not this desire was acceptable. If the latter is the case (as must be on hierarchical 'approval' models), then the judgment about the desire will have to be based on (other) desires of the agent. Then the question arises about these new desires and their being approved or not by the agent, from which flows the infinite regress of desires.” (8)

Frankfurt – Strawberry hypnosis problem defeats the “decisive” answer to the infinite regress problem. The person is not autonomous, but fits the structure of autonomy laid out by Frankfurt. But, if Frankfurt agrees they aren’t autonomous, then he is missing something, as ‘identification is insufficient for autonomy” – hence the incompleteness problem. (8-9)

These models use a structural “time-slice” analysis to determine autonomy. Christman is arguing against the time-slice approach. His counterexamples seems to point that out as well, as the ways in which he argues against the autonomy of Dworkin and Frankfurt is based upon a manipulation, which requires we understand the manner in which desires, values, and beliefs were formed. (10)

One “must “submit to the regiment of ‘programming’ with the full knowledge of its nature and effects,” essentially one must have informed consent to conditioning, in order to have said to be autonomous in the way in which one forms or modifies desires, values, and beliefs. (10)

“the central focus for autonomy must make particular reference to the processes of preference formation, in particular what makes them 'manipulative' in a way crucially different from 'normal' processes of self-development” (10)

Christman’s claim is that by shifting the focus of inquiry about autonomy to the conditions for and process of preference formation, he can “eliminate the need for the condition of identification altogether” (10). Let’s see if he really can.

“What matters is what the agent thinks about the process of coming to have the desire, and whether she resists that process when (or if) given the chance” (10)

On what basis does one “resist the adoption of a value or desire”? That kind of resisting or choosing not to resist seems to be a time-slice approach. And, if it isn’t a choice at all, then it isn’t really governing, right?

The new requirement: “the agent was in a position to resist the development of a desire and she did not. This suggests the following conditions” (10-11)

“(i) A person P is autonomous relative to some desire D if it is the case that P did not resist the development of D when attending to this process of development, or P mould not have resisted that development had P attended to the process;

(ii) The lack of resistance to the development of D did not take place (or would not have) under the influence of factors that inhibit self-reflection;

and

(iii) The self-reflection involved in condition (i) is (minimally) rational and involves no self-deception.” (11)

“The motivating idea behind the theory is that autonomy is achieved when an agent is in a position to be aware of the changes and development of her character and of why these changes come about. This self-awareness enables the agent to foster or resist such changes. And while doing so the agent cannot be self-deceived or irrational (in a minimal sense). This implies that she must be free from the influence of factors that disrupt these cognitive capacities.” (11)

I’m still worried that Christman is subject to the regress he thinks he avoids. And, even if Christman does avoid the Regress (18-19), it seems as though autonomy is not really that important, valuable, or meaningful.
