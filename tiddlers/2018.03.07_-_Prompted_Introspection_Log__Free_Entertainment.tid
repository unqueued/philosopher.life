title: 2018.03.07 - Prompted Introspection Log: Free Entertainment

!! What would you do to entertain your family without spending any money?

Nothing is free. It's a basic law in physics and thus economics and computation as well. Thus, you must be more specific. Do you mean not spending a dollar in my bank account right now? I will assume so.

We engage in the dialectic, we watch pirated videos, and we make food together. Being and thinking about being together just is our entertainment. Sometimes we'll make art together, attend a concert at the university, or play outside.
