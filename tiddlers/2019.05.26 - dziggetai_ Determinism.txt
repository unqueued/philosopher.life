[1:47 PM] h0p3: How's life going?
[1:48 PM] Shp: lately i've been thinking about determinism
[1:50 PM] Shp: if there is only cause and effect in the natural world, it does seem quite obvious that its the same with us since we are part of the natural world. some randomness might occur, maybe that's what we interpret as the ability to choose
[1:52 PM] Shp: its interesting that I was exposed to a lot of religion as I grew up (doubting every single word of it of course, .. I still am) so up until like a week ago I thought that determinism was strongly connected to the concept of a deity. which now that I recognized that it doesn't seems foolish .
[1:53 PM] h0p3: by natural world, you mean physical world, right?
[1:53 PM] Shp: I am not sure if there is any other world, so yes
[1:55 PM] h0p3: I hold an unpopular point of view: I'm a libertarian freewill theorist. I'm an incompatibilist. My beliefs are a result of my brainwashed religious upbringing. I was closer to Arminian side than the Calvinist. I can't shake the intuition though.
[1:56 PM] h0p3: There are possibly different kinds of determinism to consider.
[1:57 PM] h0p3: Randomness appears to occur (though we can never be certain that it's ever actually random, we can only ever compute that it is pseudorandom, or likely enough to be indistinguishable from random for us).
[1:58 PM] h0p3: I assume your concern is something like: what makes randomness interpreted as freewill a meaningful kind of choice?
[1:59 PM] h0p3: I have no satisfactory answers here, btw.
[1:59 PM] h0p3: (as usual, lol)
[2:00 PM] h0p3: Compatibilists tend to have the fewest worries. It's conveniently stoic of them.
[2:01 PM] h0p3: Many skeptics do not find autonomy to be a coherent concept in the first place.
[2:03 PM] h0p3: For them, we are observers passively watching. Appearances of choice are illusory. There are some fMRI studies which show a disconnect between our phenomenology and the point at which a computer can reliably predict what choice is made. But, there's also a time delay for what we experience (it's not real time), and "filling in the gaps" for our hearing and even when we blink. I will agree that the freewill theorist given physicalist grounds appears to have perhaps an impossible task in front of them.
[2:05 PM] Shp: I'm not sure if I have any particular concerns, the topic in general is of concern to me :D I don't see how libertarian freewill can be the case. why are you or me different than a rock? and where does free will emerge in the chain of cause and effect?  (as in molecules react to one another, neurons do as well, I just don't see the how this can result in free will)
[2:07 PM] Shp: I didn't even think of that! I saw a video a few years ago about machines predicting what choice you'll make before you made them!
[2:07 PM] h0p3: For me, the issue is whether or not we are responsible for our lives. The interpretation of the self and world is radically different for me in either case.
[2:11 PM] h0p3: I think the Libertarian freewill theorist is going to presuppose metaphysics. They will not be physicalists.
[2:12 PM] h0p3: Freewill, on that view, appears to be something from outside physics acting on physics. I have no account for such a thing.
[2:14 PM] Shp: there is a neat book by Asimov that has time travel in it, I can't recall its title I read it years ago.. it presented me with the rather great concept of things making diversions in the chain of events but only sort of small ones and they eventually meet again. I think this is largely true for human lives - we can make little disturbances but things will end up essentially in the same way decades after our deaths. free will could be like this - we can choose between one flavor or ice cream or another, but the end result will be that we eat ice cream (only on a larger scale, obviously)
[2:14 PM] h0p3: If I understand correctly, conscious observation does appear to be fundamentally embedded in quantum mechanics. Rocks do not affect the world in the same way as humans. We are causally different than rocks, imho.
[2:16 PM] h0p3: I don't remember that one.
[2:16 PM] Shp: I can't imagine place outside the physical world
[2:16 PM] h0p3: That is shocking to me.
[2:16 PM] Shp: :D why?
[2:16 PM] h0p3: What do you mean by imagine?
[2:18 PM] Shp: well, like with higher dimensions that we can't experience as 3d beings, we can sorta imagine how it would feel like because we can get ourselves to understand how a flatlander would experience 3d objects
[2:18 PM] Shp: and that gets us an approximation to how it'd feel and be like to experience n dimensional objects.
[2:18 PM] Shp: but only in imagination.
[2:19 PM] Shp: so, since I live in the physical world, I can't imagine a world that is immaterial, or "above" our own
[2:20 PM] Shp: (ofc I know that I don't live in the physical world, I live in one that my brain constructs for me)
[2:21 PM] Shp: the end of eternity
[2:21 PM] Shp: that is the title. I remembered which book it was, I have it in a physical copy so I was able to check the title :)
[2:22 PM] h0p3: Sorta imagine sounds like imagining to me. And, you already agree we generally only have an approximation of the external world already.
[2:22 PM] Shp: not his best book, but this idea was neat in it.
[2:22 PM] h0p3: Do you mean to say you can't satisfactorily imagine it?
[2:23 PM] Shp: well, I need data to imagine it. what is there to imagine without that?
[2:23 PM] Shp: this whole conversation is reminding me of a great quote from Carl Sagan "we are a way for the universe to observe itself"
[2:24 PM] h0p3: Sounds like Hegel to me.
[2:24 PM] Shp: oh I misquoted, sorry
"we are a way for the cosmos to know itself"
[2:25 PM] Shp: I'm going all over the place, sorry - so you're saying that there is something that is outside the physical world. tell me more
[2:26 PM] h0p3: Well, first I want to understand why you think you can't imagine anything outside of physics.
[2:26 PM] Shp: (simulations, and our minds are inside the physical world, so they are not self contained imo.)
[2:26 PM] h0p3: Everytime you posit a limit, you posit something outside that limit (until you start talking about [[The Infinite]]).
[2:27 PM] Shp: could you explain this to me?
[2:27 PM] h0p3: Not satisfactorily, lol!
[2:28 PM] Shp: it doesn't make sense to me
[2:29 PM] h0p3: I am convinced that concepts necessitate their opposites.
[2:30 PM] Shp: why?
[2:30 PM] h0p3: You might not think concepts are real though.
[2:30 PM] Shp: I don't
[2:32 PM] Shp: "Well, first I want to understand why you think you can't imagine anything outside of physics."
I might  be able to, but I don't know what to imagine! (I can come up with concepts but it'd be mere brainstorming instead of doing anything  that is of significance, unless I stumble upon what's actually true by accident, and since there is a close infinite amount of thins one can come up with its highly unlikely)
[2:34 PM] h0p3: "Can" is a modal word. There are many variations in it. I don't think you mean it isn't conceptually (or logically) possible for you to imagine. I also don't think you mean it isn't physically possible either. The brainstorming is imagining. I posit you can imagine something outside of physics, regardless of your accuracy and justificaiton.
[2:34 PM] Shp: also, I need evidence and (ideally) proof, or at the very least for it to be logically coherent
[2:34 PM] h0p3: You will need to defend the claim that your brainstorming is not significant. What is significance?
[2:35 PM] h0p3: You are looking not to have faith at all.
[2:35 PM] h0p3: I admire the pursuit more than you know.
[2:36 PM] h0p3: You will never be able to escape having faith no matter how hard you try. Even the empiricists must begin their Bayesian equation with faith.
[2:36 PM] Shp: something gains significance imo when it relates to the truth or if it becomes useful in some way
[2:37 PM] h0p3: We are moving ridiculously fast again. I'm sorry I'm doing a shit job. You mean to say it has instrumental value. Useful for what?
[2:38 PM] h0p3: We can be wrong about it's utility too, so I think the "relates to the truth" is going to be important. I think that truth is not a result of me, it's not something I've constructed.
[2:38 PM] Shp: we're moving this fast because I can't stay at one topic for more than ten seconds without finding a wall, made of lack of knowledge that I can't climb :D
[2:39 PM] h0p3: Naw, your points are all excellent.
[2:40 PM] h0p3: I'd be interested to know what you think counts as truth.
[2:40 PM] h0p3: What makes 2+2=4 true?
[2:40 PM] h0p3: What does it mean to say it is true?
[2:43 PM] Shp: something is significant if it's useful for me, it is more significant if it is useful for both of us and it is even more significant if it's useful for humanity as a whole. even though I am convinced we don't have any particular significance even as a species, I can't escape the fact that I am human, so because I'm stuck with this 'inside perspective' the only importance I know is to us. also, since we give meaning to things, by themselves they wouldn't mean a thing. a rock has no meaning by itself, so it has no significance. unless it is important for something that makes it significant.
[2:43 PM] h0p3: (Gödel's Incompeteness is going to be a serious problem for you: it basically says that for an language which can syntactically represent arithmetic, there is something true which cannot be proven in the language...ie. no finite language and no finite computer can prove all of what is true.)
[2:45 PM] h0p3: I see no reason to think the subjective meaning I grant to something results in any objective meaning beyond the claim that I think it's meaningful.
[2:45 PM] Shp: then I envy Gödel. I don't even know if there is a single true thing at all, and he believes there is infinite true things!
[2:46 PM] Shp: I agree. and I am contradicting myself.
[2:46 PM] h0p3: We are at a place where concepts necessitate their opposites.
[2:46 PM] Shp: I didn't say objective though
[2:47 PM] h0p3: I know we are going to rely upon an absurdity here.
[2:47 PM] h0p3: A True Contradiction.
[2:48 PM] h0p3: I know that sounds insane.
[2:48 PM] h0p3: I hate it.
[2:48 PM] h0p3: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/
[2:48 PM] Shp: how fast do you read?
[2:48 PM] h0p3: I don't know.
[2:49 PM] h0p3: It depends on the context too.
[2:49 PM] h0p3: Sometimes fairly quickly, sometimes ridiculously slowly.
[2:49 PM] h0p3: You should assume I am slow. I think I'm slow on average.
[2:49 PM] Shp: haha, I can't ask how fast you comprehend, though I would like to know!
[2:50 PM] Shp: I'm sure I fall on the ridiculously slow side too.
[2:50 PM] h0p3: I like to think it can be a good thing, like we're digesting it, mulling it around, wrestling with it.
[2:53 PM] Shp: do you  think there is such a thing as "objective"?
I mean absolute zero seems quite a bit objective, but outside of that.
[2:53 PM] h0p3: You are speaking with an insane person. I believe the truthbearer of 2+2=4 is a real thing that exists in metaphysics. Logical truths are true even without anyone to think them. They are true in all possible worlds, even those without an evolved minds. I think The Truth is outside me and even outside of physics.
[2:54 PM] h0p3: I think the question "What was there before the Big Bang?" is a reasonable one.
[2:54 PM] Shp: there was no time before the big bang, so there is no before
[2:54 PM] h0p3: That is quite an assumption.
[2:54 PM] h0p3: What is your evidence again?
[2:54 PM] Shp: (assuming it was indeed the creation of time and space)
[2:55 PM] h0p3: I can't give evidence either way.
[2:55 PM] Shp: well, me neither
[2:55 PM] Shp: as much as I'd like to be an astronomer, I'm not
[2:56 PM] h0p3: They can't either, the physicists can't either from what I can tell.
[2:56 PM] Shp: but it is the scientific consensus.
[2:56 PM] h0p3: Oh, not at all.
[2:56 PM] h0p3: Physics has always and will always butt up against philosophy.
[2:56 PM] h0p3: The very cutting edge of theoretical physics just is philosophy.
[2:56 PM] h0p3: It's not empiricism.
[2:57 PM] Shp: physics is philosophy! natural philosophy, if I  recall correctly :D
[2:58 PM] h0p3: Well, I don't know what doesn't count as philosophy, some are just better at it than others.
[2:58 PM] Shp: as in some disciplines, or what do you mean?
[2:58 PM] h0p3: Aye!
[2:58 PM] Shp: and you say physics is not doing it well?
[2:58 PM] Shp: I say physics is doing quite well!
[2:59 PM] h0p3: I think it's fair to say they are doing well too.
[2:59 PM] Shp: although I have big issues with the big bang, now that you reminded me of them!
[2:59 PM] h0p3: But, again, my point is that they aren't doing science at some point.
[3:00 PM] Shp: that might be true. string theory does not seem to be based on the real world but it is logically coherent as far as I can tell!
[3:01 PM] Shp: so yes, that is less science than the double slit experiment :D
[3:01 PM] h0p3: The Big Bang is one such limit on the physical universe, btw. That it is reasonable to be curious about what it means to talk about "before" or "at" the Big Bang is where we start to talk about what is posited beyond that limit.
[3:01 PM] h0p3: Logical coherence might not mean what you think it does.
[3:02 PM] Shp: many things don't!
[3:02 PM] h0p3: Unicorns are logically coherent. Santa Clause is as well. Angels and demons.
[3:02 PM] h0p3: String theory seems to have more going for it than unicorns.
[3:03 PM] h0p3: It does model and predict behavior we can observe.
[3:05 PM] Shp: depending on who you talk to unicorns  could live in warm climates or cold ones and you have incoherence - and since there is no basis for it except for the weird sea animal that lives on the poles it can't have coherence, unless everyone is telling the same tale either because they agreed to it or got it from the same source
[3:05 PM] h0p3: Wait, why should I agree to that concept of incoherence? That's not the one I have in mind.
[3:05 PM] Shp: what concept of incoherence do you have in mind?
[3:07 PM] h0p3: Logical coherence is roughly a property or relationship among a set of propositions, namely that no contradiction can be derived from that set.
[3:08 PM] h0p3: I also don't see why the climate of unicorn is essential to the concept of the unicorn.
[3:09 PM] h0p3: But, if I have to go this direction, then I will say: my concept of the unicorn is logically coherent.
[3:09 PM] Shp: and you think I can't have propositions about santa or unicorns that contradict one another?
[3:09 PM] h0p3: That is not what I said.
[3:10 PM] Shp: okay, but you can have any arbitrary concept of a unicorn with any arbitrary propositions about it
[3:10 PM] h0p3: But, I can make sets of propositions about my keyboard which contradict one another as well.
[3:10 PM] h0p3: That is also not what I said.
[3:10 PM] Shp: :D
[3:12 PM] h0p3: Some people, especially in constructivist and physicalist shoes, prefer to think of logic as a set of rules we follow and claim to be "coherent" by definition without any further justification.
[3:12 PM] Shp: is that even possible? to have logical coherence about anything that has any complexity? I mean based on what you said you can't have derived contradictions! I can derive all sorts of things from even just one proposition
[3:13 PM] h0p3: I agree that you can derive many sorts of things from even zero propositions with logic. It appears you are claiming you can derive contradictions from anything (which amounts to agreeing to absurdity from the beginning).
[3:15 PM] h0p3: (I'm not playing a mere game with you btw; I'm trying to explain a fairly difficult thing to say which I normally need weeks to express in a classroom.)
[3:16 PM] Shp: classrooms make me think of conclusions and answers
[3:17 PM] Shp: I am not sure if we are headed in the direction of either
[3:19 PM] Shp: (no offense - this is not criticism, I don't really expect conclusions and answers.. the older I am the more sure I get that there are no such things.)
[3:19 PM] Shp: (but I'd love to have them!)
[3:20 PM] h0p3: That also sounds like a conclusion to me.
[3:20 PM] h0p3: Perhaps we only increase our confidence in some propositions.
[3:21 PM] Shp: I do believe there are answers in the world, I'm just not sure if anyone knows them. or that we can know them at all. ofc this is not true for relatively simple things like the roundness of the Earth or why the grass is green
[3:22 PM] Shp: in fact I believe there are answers for everything. I love the scientific approach.
[3:23 PM] h0p3: This might be something worth exploring for you too: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism
[3:23 PM] Shp: but again, no matter how many times I observe white swans, there are still black ones in Australia
[3:24 PM] Shp: and yes, increasing confidence in some propositions is something.
[3:25 PM] Shp: I'll look into this and the other link too :)
[3:29 PM] h0p3: If you are interested in First-Order Logic and metalogic, I keep my lecture notes here: https://philosopher.life/#2015.01.06%20-%20Symbolic%20Logic%3A%20Boolean%20Connectives
[3:29 PM] h0p3: That's where it begins, at least
[3:30 PM] h0p3: Poorly formatted though.
[3:31 PM] Shp: its loading
[3:32 PM] Shp: you can't say it is poorly formatted, I don't see formatting at all! (just joking, no offense :))
[3:33 PM] h0p3: Aye. Lol!
[3:33 PM] h0p3: Of the books I've used, this is by far my favorite: https://www.amazon.com/Language-Proof-Logic-David-Barker-Plummer/dp/1575866323
[3:34 PM] Shp: you have not continued your short notes on the inside no9 episodes. did you decide not to continue the show or are you just not taking notes?
[3:34 PM] h0p3: Yeah, I stopped watching. It wasn't striking me anymore.
[3:34 PM] h0p3: I got the schtick, and then it fell apart for me.
[3:35 PM] Shp: do you plan on returning to it?
[3:35 PM] h0p3: No idea. Sitting on our drive with several other things.
[3:37 PM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#TV%3A%20Exploration
[3:39 PM] h0p3: I'm in the terrible habit of trying shows, getting through an episode or season, and then losing interest.
[3:40 PM] h0p3: I actively try to do that with books; I want to avoid the sunk cost fallacy.
[3:40 PM] Shp: I'm in the terrible habit of staying with them even if they decline in quality :D
[3:42 PM] Shp: I am very meticulous in choosing what books I read and I often have them on my list for years before I end up reading them
[3:43 PM] h0p3: I am envious. I'm retarded when it comes to planning.
[3:43 PM] h0p3: I lack the discipline, and I can't forecast for myself that well.
[3:44 PM] Shp: (the stark change in topic to inside no9 was on purpose, I am expecting that I'll have to leave quite abruptly in a few minutes)
[3:45 PM] h0p3: Thank you for telling me! I miss social cues often, lol.
[3:45 PM] Shp: me too, and I was afraid you will interpret it as I lost interest which is not true
[3:45 PM] h0p3: Lol!
[3:46 PM] Shp: "I'm retarded when it comes to planning.
I lack the discipline"
ha! I feel the same way, I wish I could be systematic about everything and that my systems were all designed, but they often just simply on the path of least resistance
[3:46 PM] h0p3: Where path of least resistance for me is often reducible to my childlike capricious pursuit of consuming drugs of various kinds.
[3:48 PM] h0p3: Btw, how is life going for you? I never hear about it.
[3:48 PM] Shp: also, I like to read physical books and I am no king to have a library of my own, and local libraries don't have many books in english, so I end up ordering them from abroad and can't spend much so its regulating itself in a way
[3:48 PM] h0p3: Scarcity will give rise to wisdom.
[3:49 PM] Shp: it also reduces intelligence (as long as it lasts)
[3:49 PM] h0p3: I am ridiculously spoiled on this front. My wife ILLs any books and articles I want from around the world for free. I used to have to own everything I read, but I can't afford that and I hate moving books.
[3:49 PM] Shp: what kinds of drugs if I might ask?
[3:50 PM] h0p3: It can, yes. It depends on the degree or kind. There are contexts in which scarcity, hunger, and desire for limited resources motivates the efficient construction of good answers.
[3:52 PM] Shp: life is trouble as always, I am struggling with my behavior, I have identified the most important things to me, but I don't end up acting on anything, which is annoying.
[3:54 PM] h0p3: Preach. I'm sorry, homie. :frowning:
[3:54 PM] h0p3: Ah, well, I meant drugs in a broad, broad sense. As far as drugs, I have used: alcohol, cannabis, LSD, shrooms (used to grow them), DMT (make my own), ketamine (amazing for my depression), benzos (I'm paranoic about using them very rarely), some minor mind-altering substance which can be cheaply bought at a local store (like LSA and nutmeg).
[3:55 PM] h0p3: I prefer psychedelics and cannabis.
[3:56 PM] h0p3: How about you? What, if any, are your substances of choice?
[4:01 PM] Shp: none
[4:02 PM] Shp: I was a second-hand smoker in my childhood for which I'm quite upset, I've smoked the watered variety of cigarette thingies two times many years ago and have consumed alcohol like 1x per year :D
[4:03 PM] h0p3: I'd be pissed about that too. Ridiculously hard habit to break, sadly.
[4:03 PM] h0p3: I wish I didn't drink alcohol.
[4:04 PM] Shp: the time has come that I predicted when I switched to inside no9! I have to go now. to be continued!
[4:04 PM] h0p3: Peace, homie, ttyl!
