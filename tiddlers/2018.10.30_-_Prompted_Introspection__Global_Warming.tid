title: 2018.10.30 - Prompted Introspection: Global Warming

!! In your opinion, is Global Warming real? If so what is causing it? If not why is everyone so hyped up about it?

That you find this a valid question, Samwise, disturbs me. Global warming is a hyperobject, and the full causal explanation is not known. Increases in CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) trap heat, this causes some terrible feedback loops, and we aren't helping. That it's occurring is not worth your doubt. How fast, the consequences, and how we can stop it are worth our effort. It turns out that power structures across the globe have to radically alter to deal with this. Heads up: it isn't going to happen (but, I still have to try).

Epistemic trust is complex. We rely inductively rely upon webs of experts loosely coordinated to give us our information. That people do not trust is a complicated problem. Many of us, if not all, are at fault to varying [[dok]]. Again, I consider this a [[Golden Rule]] problem. Of course, the future of Humanity has a moral right to our intellectual and ecologically-driven labor.
