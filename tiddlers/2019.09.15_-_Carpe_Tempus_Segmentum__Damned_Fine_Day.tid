title: 2019.09.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Damned Fine Day

* Woke at 10
** Love the pattern.
* Read
* Fireman Time!
* WoW
* Cleaned kitchen
** Finally organized and back into the shape it was before the AC clusterfuck.
*** Though, it's making a funny noise (a different one) again.
* Prepped our meal
* Family Walk!
** What was wonderful about it for me is that I got to just listen to my wife do most of the speaking today.
** I offered my usual [[redpill]]s and [[Straussian]] advice. It's much more relaxing to sit on the passive end of the dialecture.
* One-on-Ones!
** My daughter continues to get snarkier about me (though she's so much more relaxed with others). She's gonna be an elegant beast.
* Family Log
* Lentil Soup & Beer
* I just fell asleep. Best nap I've had since...
** Nope, `[search:title[Carpe Tempus]search:text[nap]]` doesn't show one this good, imho. I woke up refreshed, serene, grateful, etc.
* My wife and daughter made brownies for us (and for Mr. Delp).
* Read our wikis...
** Not the worst, not the best. Glad to do it. 
** I've noticed that my offspring are actually reading what I have to say more closely than they used to. This has been good practice.
* WoW
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 4
