title: 2018.10.31 - Guitar: Stepping on Dangerous Women

We have an old advance copy of //Dangerous Women//. I use it as a stool for my foot to hold the classical position. Thus: "I step on Dangerous Women" -- just fuckin' terrible humor. Kids joke about it with me. My son's wrist was hurting, so I had him try the classical position too. We are playing //Minuet in G// after all. It's finally getting up to speed on my part with that syncopation that I crave. My son is getting better, and I think with improvements to his strumming patterns, that song is going to sound really good.

I'm considering having him learn to play by ear (as well) with strumming so that he can just walk up and join anything. That is not my skill. I've seen training for perfect pitch too, but I think that is irrelevant.

Daughter is still working on //Duelin' Banjos//. It coalesces.

The guitar is finally starting to feel natural again to the point that I can be read-to-hand about it, emotional even in wielding it. I'm not all the way there, but it's starting.
