!! Respond to the following gem:

Don't fear moving slowly. Fear standing still.

False. Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica. You can move in the wrong direction, and sometimes moving in any direction is wrong. I have no idea how or if this means anything applied to traversing the spectrum between fear and fearlessness.

Obviously, there are so many cases where doing something is wildly better than doing nothing at all. It's a fine motivational claim in most contexts or a token phrase you'd throw out in a meeting to introduce or cap an issue, but it doesn't hold much water.
