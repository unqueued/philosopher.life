Had a white one years ago. Deer killed it. Finally replaced it.
OCT 5 12:16 PM
You get to eat the venison?
OCT 5 12:29 PM
Nahm deer was tiny. Was too concerned with getting a tow home and rental car and insurance claim. Blah. I took the payout and paid off the loan on my garage. And bought the gold car.

Super good car but sold it awhile back, just not as sporty as the 2 door. And it was ugly and a v6 so worse gas mileage.
OCT 5 12:31 PM
Been driving the wife old car. But it doesn't have cruise.
OCT 5 12:32 PM
I picked the Honda up Wednesday.
OCT 5 12:32 PM
Black on black 4cyl 5speed.
OCT 5 12:32 PM
Cheap.
OCT 5 12:32 PM
Hope it turns out to be a good commuter.
OCT 5 12:32 PM
Aye, it looks well-suited for it.
OCT 5 12:33 PM
Thanks. It's what I wanted. Been looking for awhile. Like a couple of years.
OCT 5 12:34 PM
How is yalls weekend going?
OCT 5 12:34 PM
Fine enough. Cleaning, making art with my wife, reading and writing.
OCT 5 12:36 PM
Nice. What kind of art are you guys making?
OCT 5 12:37 PM
for my wife's library's "Books+Art" thing. She's making a cross out of an a gorgeous hand-drawn Bible we have.
OCT 5 12:39 PM
I'm just the dude on the sidelines coming up with ideas, being encouraging, etc.
OCT 5 12:39 PM
That's awesome. My wife is much more artistic than me. I feel where you are aiming from.
OCT 5 12:40 PM
Coming*
OCT 5 12:40 PM
I am interested in how the cross came out! Have you guys finished or still a work in progress?
OCT 5 9:39 PM
Still working on it. 
OCT 5 9:39 PM
I've been working on something else since she inspired me.
OCT 5 9:39 PM
That is cool. With my girls gone for fall break today and tomorrow are the last two days of my vacation. Then back to the grind. I don't much care for an empty house anymore.
OCT 5 9:41 PM
I hear that.
OCT 5 9:41 PM
They are on lake Michigan in Michigan, Indiana. So far looks like they are having a blast.
OCT 5 9:42 PM
Noice. They take the boat?
OCT 5 9:42 PM
With the In laws. Icould have took my vacation with them. But instead I stayed here and took my Vaca last week. Staycation.
OCT 5 9:43 PM
Nah they didn't take the boat. It's a long haul and the wife is not an expert at backing, launching, starting, all that stuff.
OCT 5 9:43 PM
That's a big lack compared to our little lake Cumberland man made reservoir
OCT 5 9:44 PM
Lake*
OCT 5 9:44 PM
Heck yeah, huge. Feels more like the ocean to me.
