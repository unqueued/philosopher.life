type: text/plain

[11:47 AM] h0p3: Hey! I'm sorry I've been off in my own world. Just saw your @.
[11:50 AM] chameleon: That's ok my dude! Was just wondering what was going on lol. I've been active in wikiworld recently
[11:50 AM] chameleon: I'm guessing wow? ;)
[11:53 AM] h0p3: I've been reading. I check at least once a day. Yes, I've chosen to destroy my life with WoW lol
[11:53 AM] h0p3: You were mentioned elsewhere: https://sphygm.us/#190801%20%E2%80%93%20wiki%3A%20SVG%20fun
[11:54 AM] chameleon: Oooh awesome, the tribe grows!
[11:55 AM] chameleon: Hopefully (probably not) I can keep a stable connection on the subway
[11:58 AM] h0p3: I can tell you've been active. Super explosive. I like how you don't use what I call a title.Tag. You let the tags do all that work.
[11:59 AM] h0p3: I'm still giving thought to it.
[12:01 PM] h0p3: It's easier to read through lists of titles by having a primary tag, especially when I'm searching through years and thousands of tiddlers (my memory aint so good too often).
[12:01 PM] h0p3: Sometimes, it's very hard for me to know where things belong or how to name them. I like not having to title.Tag in those cases especially.
[12:02 PM] chameleon: Sometimes I think I might have too many categories, or too few, so uh, watch that space
[12:06 PM] h0p3: There are some performance limitations with tags, but you have to reach tens of thousands IIRC. I wouldn't be too worried about too many categories; I think you've been judicious with them. Plus. the Commander tool can allow you to easily shape the tags too.
[12:08 PM] h0p3: I have no idea what I'm doing on that front though. Naming things is always an anciently hard problem. Names are like tentpegs for me. I put a bunch down, but sometimes the tent has to move.
[12:09 PM] h0p3: There are some links buried in [[Tagging Theory]] which might be worth your time.
[12:32 PM] chameleon: I'll have to get stuck in this evening...
[12:33 PM] chameleon: Also sphymus' page I another rabbithole :grin:
[2:38 PM] h0p3: Yeah, I like the rabbitholiness of wikis. Not everyone cares for the style. A lot of people say they get lost in the format. There's something to that vertigo worth embracing.
[2:39 PM] chameleon: for sure! it takes some getting used to, lol, but I find I eventually prefer it. You kind of have to get over not being able to use tabs and stuff (well, you can, but that's not what you're supposed to do, haha)
