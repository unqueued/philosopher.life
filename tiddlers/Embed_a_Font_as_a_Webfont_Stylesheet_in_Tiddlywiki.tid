title: Embed a Font as a Webfont Stylesheet in Tiddlywiki

# Get your font
# Use an online webfont generator (https://fontie.pixelsvsbytes.com/webfont-generator) or get your own toolchain
# Upload your font file (".ttf", ".eot", ".woff", etc) 
# Make sure you get CSS >> Base64 Encode
#* Look inside the file
# Generate your webkit: the output file is a ".zip" file containing a text file with the CSS code (foobarstylesheet.css)
# Copy the CSS source from that file into a tiddler
# Make sure the field font-family is what you want
# Tag the tiddler [[$:/tags/Stylesheet]] and change the tiddler type to "Plain text (text/plain)"
