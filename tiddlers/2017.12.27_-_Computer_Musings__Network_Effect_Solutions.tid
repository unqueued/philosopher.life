title: 2017.12.27 - Computer Musings: Network Effect Solutions

Let's be real. The network effect is a game theory problem which describes a manner in which monopolies are generated in digital ecosystems. Two thoughts: like the internet itself, like healthcare, like running water, I think search is a fundamental force that must be publicly available and is community property. Google's monopoly is a terrifying, awful thing. And, the weapon-noose continues to get worse. We need to make that information public. We need search requests to be publicly available (anonymized), we need the engines to be open, and we need to be able to select our own filter-bubbles. We can't merely having them selected for us. There has to be a given and take in this sphere, and it needs to be owned by everyone. There is no other escape from it. 

Of course, this won't happen for a ton of reasons, not the least of which is that those in power benefit too much from the control of information.
