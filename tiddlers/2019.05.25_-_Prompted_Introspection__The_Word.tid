!! What was/is something that your mother considered/considers very important?

The Word of Jesus Christ. 

She has no intention of following through on her [[faith]], of being epistemically transformed again and again by it, of being anything more than a priest rather than a prophet. She is exceptionally talented at lying to herself.

As much as I agree to the necessity of mysticism at the bottom, I find most mystics are egoistic frauds. What I find in them is confabulation, hubris, and conveniently seeking not to take up epistemic responsibility. That isn't how their emotions come off at the surface whatsoever either! But, it is at the core of most of the mystics I've met, and this is why I shred most of them. When it comes to [[The Moral Law]], they are not allowed to appeal to their emotions until after their reason can be reasonably^^tm^^ defended. Few are qualified, and even fewer would ever want to pay the price. It is painful to set aside our emotions when we are obligated. This is often what courage as part of the unified virtue is like.
