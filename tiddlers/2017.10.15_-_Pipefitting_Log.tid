title: 2017.10.15 - Pipefitting Log

Two QuickFix 6.1 synthetic urine kits bought. I'll need to find a way to comfortably and safely keep one on me at all times. I'm still going to try to pass employment screens with live samples, especially since they may just watch me piss (I've never had that happen yet, but the noose continues to tighten around us). The test I know will pass is better than the one I'm not sure. That said, this is wildly better than nothing. I may pick up a few more hand warmers just to make sure I can guarantee reaching the temps 92-100ish, plus I'd like to have used/practiced with one first (seems obvious and easy though).
