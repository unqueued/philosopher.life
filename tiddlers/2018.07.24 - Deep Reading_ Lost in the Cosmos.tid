title: 2018.07.24 - Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos

He's walking us through some characters to explain his transcendence/immanence dialectical modeling of the human condition. This looks like a glimpse into how an author might create a character bible. It's interesting. I don't mind the oversimplification just yet, since I need that initial model first. I'm hoping he goes somewhere with it though. Deep down, I fear he will not really attempt to resolve this problem, but I that's okay. I'm going to listen closely anyways.
