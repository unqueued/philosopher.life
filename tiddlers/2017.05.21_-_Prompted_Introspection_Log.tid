title: 2017.05.21 - Prompted Introspection Log

//I decided I would ask this classic-like one for myself on DCK today.//

!! If you could go back 20 years and magically alter, advise, or force yourself to understand, believe, and act upon 3 things, what would they be?

Clearly, the question runs into plenty of wonderful time paradoxes, epistemology, and philosophy of mind problems. Let's pretend they weren't problems, just for the sake of argument.

# Empathize with and program yourself. 
# Humbly work hard on what you care about.
# Pursue meaning in the pursuit of happiness. 

I suppose 11-year-old me would have done a lot of things differently if he could have been fittingly trained to understand and implement those fundamentals.

Let us not fret over spilled milk. Be stoic. You have a life ahead of you filled with opportunities. Go for it!

Maybe it's the afterglow effect, but I don't have much to say. I wonder if my [[Prompted Introspection Log]] felt so useful to me directly because I hadn't been able to use DCK. I don't feel the impact of this log while on or after DCK, even though I found it interesting.

It isn't that introspection isn't useful to me. It clearly very much is. Maybe it's the kind of introspection that matters. Particularism and contextualism to the rescue, yet again. I must introspect about the right things, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, etc. Thank you viciously circular Virtuous Man. I need content and decisions procedures backed by profound justifications!
