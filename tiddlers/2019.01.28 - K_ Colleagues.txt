Aye. I hope you do too.

What you up to?
MON 10:35 AM
Waiting for my Native American Religion class to start :)

You?
MON 10:37 AM
Reading and writing my wiki. Working on: https://philosopher.life/#2018.12.19%20-%20dziggetai%3A%20The%20Craft
MON 10:38 AM
Looks like a fun one to write! Another one of your colleagues I presume?
MON 10:40 AM
You can check his page (through the tag). He mentioned something about the [[APFVD]] structure in my wiki, and he was asking some other related questions. I shot him a letter, and we're going back and forth.
MON 10:42 AM
He's an artist.
MON 10:43 AM
Despite searching for him, I have little information.
MON 10:44 AM
I know nothing about Native American religion, how's that going?
MON 10:45 AM
Still in the intro stuff really. Talking about their gods and the like and spirits as well as connections with nature.
MON 10:46 AM
It’s pretty in depth
MON 10:46 AM
I assume it's a pretty big range
MON 10:48 AM
She isn’t focusing on specific tribes either, instead mentioning them and moving to others at a breakneck pace.
MON 10:49 AM
I hope it is not a regurgitative class.
MON 10:49 AM
What general discipline is the teacher coming from?
MON 10:50 AM
Humanities!
MON 10:56 AM
She’s also a Native so that’s nice too
