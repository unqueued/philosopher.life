title: 2018.12.11 - TWGCF: Non-Linearity

Non-linearity means you don't have have to get it exactly right the first time because you can execute construction out of order with TW. It enables you to handle the mistakes you couldn't have known were mistakes until you got to the other side; it allows you to build what you didn't even realize you wanted to build in the beginning. Its non-linearity might just be its low-friction flexible syntactic and semantic hackability; it is the Unix philosophy's principles incarnate once again. TW's non-linearity is a doorway to harnessing the ergodic beauty of hypertext. TW's non-linearity gives rise to evolving contexts, perspectives, and rhizomes; it means your work in TW can transcend itself again and again. 

Make way for the panacea of hypertext! Our savior is here! Make a joyful noise! Shout from the rooftops! Rejoice!
