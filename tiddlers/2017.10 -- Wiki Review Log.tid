!! Audit:

* This wiki has been undergoing a serious transformation in the past month. 
* It's hilariously serendipitous that my planning what I was going to do after the job was exactly what I needed, that I was ready to hit the ground running.
* It's obvious when I took Cannabliss. There are clear explosions on the wiki.
* I parted with the SLT convention for today; Happy Birthday.
* I have been a good role model for my children this month.
** Good job.
* I have definitely had serious tensions with my children this month.
** That has been a mixed bag of success and failure. It's okay. Keep doing your best. Practice correctly. Seek improvement.
* A few edits here and there while auditing. 
** Should I be recording them and talking about them?
*** Only if I think it's truly relevant. I will continue to [[infinigress]] if I don't.
* I have a hard time getting my wife to walk with me.
** She doesn't want to. She's tired. It's not worth it to her. Our conversations are draining for her. They don't fill her up. They don't make her happier.
* Oh yeah, I love my graphic. I don't know if it fits, but I like having some color. It is frivolous, aesthetic, etc. That's okay. It makes me happy.
* I definitely have struggled to get the font right.
** I still don't have the "edit" font setup the way I need it.
*** I should just ask.
* I think the [[Wiki Review Log]] is most interesting during my monthly audits. The story comes alive this way.
* I have lots of bidness ideas.
** My brother pointed out how I never put them into practice or take the steps to do that. 
*** I'm not yet convinced I can and should.
* I have more preamble, meta-thought, "Over-the-Bar," at the top of the page writing in these dailys logs.
** I keep developing conventions for myself.
* I've clearly made space on my wiki to talk about things which not everyone will want to read. That's fine. I don't think I've violated the CI or open spirit of the wiki by doing so.
* I'm taking {[[Dreams]]} seriously again. Good.
* Slowly, I build the existential lifetool, bootstrapping it.
* I never did look into VIM. The kids have though.
* I put LifeHacks on hold. That's fine. I know I want to develop that section.
** More importantly, I know I want [[Dependency-Worthy Memes Collections]]
* D2 has been important to me.
** I still do not know if it has been a good drug overall. It's not obvious.
* I love that I'm more willing to say these words to myself: "I don't know"
* Mathematics has definitely been a huge push for our family.
** I want to make sure my children feel triumphant and especially to see how their hard work pays off.
* I've definitely had a billion tabs up. I "save it for later" a lot. This is good behavior in some contexts, but it sucks.
* I have definitely dwelled on why and when people communicate with me.
* Perhaps I need to make my monthly audits follow the [[Wiki Review Log]] for the day as well. How did I respond to my own work? What do I think about that now?
