!! What does "You can't take it with you" mean?

It depends on the context. It's thoughtpoison against materialism in many cases. You might talk about earthly goods in the context of an afterlife here as well. It could be as mundane as being unable to bring a temporary item from one zone in an MMORPG to another. It should cause us to assess the value of things which aren't liquid, mobile, transferable, or bound to us.
