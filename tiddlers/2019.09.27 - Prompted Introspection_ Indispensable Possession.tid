title: 2019.09.27 - Prompted Introspection: Indispensable Possession

!! What is your most indispensable possession and why?

Is this prompt different from [[2018.10.13 - Prompted Introspection: Prized Possession]] and [[2018.12.29 - Prompted Introspection: Most Important Possession]]? Yes, yes, fine answers, sir.

I'm too drunk to give a shit. My penis has been sorer than usual. I've been asked to lay off it for a bit. What don't you understand about //indispensable//? You know, my penis has had many names. I prefer a name which makes fun of it to show my true adoration. 

[[WWDD]], half my teacher, even masturbated in public. Doing the lawd's work, I tell you what. I should write an ode to my penis some day; it's that indispensable to me. Wait, no, in the priority of objects I can access, I would rather have a computer than my penis (if I can only have one). This starts a terrible and normal chain for me. Fine. It's my brain. That's also why a drink, to dispense with that bastard. =)
