title: 2018.02.09 -- Job Hunting Log: Sad

Talked to the union. The secretary doesn't know anything, but the coordinator does. I'll try talking to him. This is the third union I'm trying to join. I'll see on Monday. I should have my doubts, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't try. I need to think of this as a war where I will lose a thousand battles, perhaps even a war that I believe I will lose, but I must still try.

Speaking of: I went to Dr. Young in person. He said the position was filled. It isn't on the site (and they removed others). I think he was white-lying to me. I will take that signal seriously. At this point, I dare not endanger my wife's social capital or status. We need her job.
