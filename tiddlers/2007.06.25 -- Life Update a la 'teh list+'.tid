title: 2007.06.25 -- Life Update a la 'teh list+'

Wow, it has been a while since I've posted. This has definitely been a busy month.

1) JRE graduated
2) Mom visited
3) k0sh3k and I went on vacation
4) Grandpa and Grandma moved close to us
5) JRE moved and Mom went back to Thailand
6) I've been teaching another studentless class (I never had many students to &quot;drive-away&quot; in the first place)
7) Birthdays for AIR and k0sh3k.

That was in no particular order. Short and sweet though. I'm sure things are just heating up for our new arrival. The incubatee is now muscling his or her (or its, heaven forbid) into the second trimester. Yay!

Oh yeah, I guess I didn't write this down before...but it is important. We've decided to go straight to Thailand instead of going to school first. k0sh3k and I knew we wanted to live outside the states and do missions and maybe teach our subjects if given the opportunity. We realize that we just won't benefit enough from going to school at this point, and we feel there is much more to be gained (and purpose to be fulfilled) by just entering missions now.

School is more of a barrier to where we should be than a path. School offers us education and certification. Both of which can be important, but unfortunately, these are not entirely useful in Thailand. k0sh3k and I have had to ask why we want to goto school, and we needed better reasons than we had.

Without a doubt, k0sh3k and I have peculiar intelligences, and I believe we have reached a basic threshold in our fields in which we are fully capable of learning, analyzing, and creating knowledge entirely on our own if need be...So, if we are really serious about learning in the first place, then we will do just that, regardless of our circumstances. The basic principle of school can be completed outside of school (the certification no, but that isn't why we really would want to goto school).

If we were called to teach elsewhere, then k0sh3k and I have the tools to do it already. Others may disagree, but that shows in my mind that they don't know us or see the larger plan at all. Of course, of course, we have committed the usual crime of our generation, the usual line goes: &quot;I'm the exception to the rule&quot;...&quot;I'm special&quot;...Lol. While ironically this isn't true of most who say it, k0sh3k and I are chosen. I could loop this back to &quot;other may disagree&quot; at this point. But, there is no point. k0sh3k and I have proven ourselves exceptional (it is one of the perks of being &quot;weird&quot;), and I know that we have the tools to do what God asks of us. There is a reason why I find &quot;4eak&quot; so fitting, I've pretty much taken it as a second name.

Anyways, this shift in plans is obviously important to us. We've been gathering what we need to move. We've talked to our doctors, and we've been advised that we cannot move until at least 8 weeks after the baby is born. This seems fine. We have so many loose ends to tie up. Preparing for the next baby, having it, present and future work and finances, getting 1-year teaching visas, figuring out what to do with the house and the stuff we have.

I will admit, the shift is somewhat bittersweet, but in no way regretful (in the end I am content[THE word of sufficiency]...nay, even happy) about the decision. It is only bittersweet on the surface of things, and that would only be in terms of the opportunity costs foregone to complete our mission. These, obviously, are acceptable &quot;losses&quot;.

I do have to say though, my parents have offered us the house indefinitely, and it has been a true aid to my family. In order for us to have payed for rent elsewhere, both of us would have needed to be working (which would have been fine, but certainly not preferred). The house has offered us the ability for k0sh3k to be a stay-at-home-mom (which sometimes she likes and sometimes she doesn't, although, it is growing on her). We are very grateful for the use of the house.
