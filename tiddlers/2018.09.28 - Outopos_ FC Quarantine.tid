title: 2018.09.28 - Outopos: FC Quarantine

https://www.reddit.com/r/FULLCOMMUNISM/comments/9jg3ok/rfullcommunism_quarantine_thread/

/r/FULLCOMMUNISM has been Quarantined by Reddit Admins. Hilariously, T_D is untouched. Put on your Straussian lenses. It's time to be paranoid. I hope the Left will wake up about censorship (so many favor it; the insanity!). Some variant of 1984 is real, and it always has been. Who benefits?

As you know, I'm profoundly disturbed by censorship. Exactly what counts as censorship is not a simple conceptual analysis either. Naively, Party A doesn't want Party B to have plain, unadulterated, complete, fully-ranked access to Content C. Censorship is about shaping the memeplex formation and flow in [[The Great Human Conversation]], even if only for short-bursts in targeted pockets. Information is power, especially in the Information Age, and that's exactly why it must be decentralized.

It is obvious that we must radically build towards tooling that enables and encourages us to individually filter, shape, and burst our own bubbles. Collective filtering is also extremely important, hence I think we have to build [[T42T]] systems for understanding others, trusting their opinions, etc. Hubski and a few others are pointing to something crucial. We must mitigate conflicts of interest in what and how content is dynamically presented. Again, this is a power decentralization problem. It's going to require serious public investment because it's a very difficult set of problems in CS; our best and brightest should not be building Google's and FB's but instead racing the other direction.<<ref "f">> Blockchain enthusiasm has been misplaced and selfish.

Again, I take [[Outopos]] to be the start of where we have to go. Hardware infrastructure decentralization is inescapably necessary to the success of the internet. Possession is 9/10th's of the law, and if we don't literally host the internet in our houses, we've already lost. The [[Atropos]] protocol might be a reasonable start, and it even handles the last mile problem decently. The game is already over if we are forced to rely upon their infrastructure. If information is going to be free, then we can't make it so I can walk into a datacenter and shutdown your server. However, it should be possible for everyone to shun a server.

Obviously, I'm not even scratching the surface of the tip of the iceberg. I do not have the technical chops to build this thing. I can barely even describe the requirements and goal (including the justifications).
