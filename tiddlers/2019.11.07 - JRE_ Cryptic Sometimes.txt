You feeling better?
Nov 7, 2019 12:23pm
Constipated now
Nov 7, 2019 12:23pm
Maybe cause of the tray of lasagna...
Nov 7, 2019 12:23pm
Matthew got super congested last night, and had a hard time breathing, so around 930-midnight i was up with him trying to help him find good positions to sleep in
Nov 7, 2019 12:24pm
We had lasagna recently. So amazing.
Nov 7, 2019 12:25pm
Yikes.
Nov 7, 2019 12:25pm
That is awful.
Nov 7, 2019 12:25pm
He doing any better today?
Nov 7, 2019 12:29pm
Yeah, still snorting like a pig sometimes, but otherwise fine.
Nov 7, 2019 12:30pm
Makes noises that make me jump up to see if he is breathing, and when I get there he is smiling
Nov 7, 2019 12:31pm
=)
Nov 7, 2019 12:31pm
Work starts up again tomorrow

This one was early on
Nov 7, 2019 12:34pm
Aye, you know how they use 6 month old babies in movies and pretend they are newborn?  He looks like the foster agency grabbed a one year old and we are all supposed to pretend he is 6 months old
Nov 7, 2019 12:35pm
Yes. I agree.
Nov 7, 2019 12:35pm
That dude is huge.
Nov 7, 2019 12:35pm
Also, you know the crew you are going to be working with?
Nov 7, 2019 12:35pm
Wrap looks good on you. It never seemed to work for me.
Nov 7, 2019 12:35pm
Made me overheat super fast
Nov 7, 2019 12:36pm
I'm not good at tying these, so it wasn't worth the emotional energy.
Nov 7, 2019 12:36pm
Makes sense. Like a furnace.
Nov 7, 2019 12:36pm
Yep
Nov 7, 2019 12:36pm
I am farting so much...
Nov 7, 2019 12:36pm
Good times. These days, even the taste of coffee makes me go take a shit. 
Nov 7, 2019 12:48pm
My farts smell like death too. Like, abnormally bad. Always have.

Nov 8, 2019 7:17pm

Nov 8, 2019 8:17pm

Nov 9, 2019 9:51am
Hard to tell that l the first line of each one is bold
Nov 9, 2019 9:53am
I've gotten to play with the lesser GPT-2 Models, but not the full one. It's astounding.
Nov 9, 2019 11:13am
How's your day going? 
Nov 9, 2019 11:49am
Matthew had a hard time breathing again, so we just turns trying to get him to sleep.  Long night
Nov 9, 2019 11:51am
Yikes.
Nov 9, 2019 11:51am

Nov 9, 2019 11:52am
He started up daycare this week, makes sense he would get sick.  Visitation starts next Thursday
Nov 9, 2019 11:52am
Oh, eyah.
Nov 9, 2019 11:52am
That is the sign of the beginning of the end, right?
Nov 9, 2019 11:52am
Nothing crazy, just snorting and snorting, enough to make it hard for him to sleep in his normal positions, but he can sleep okay, sorta, if we are holding him vertically
Nov 9, 2019 11:53am
Aye, month or two I net
Nov 9, 2019 11:53am
Bet
Nov 9, 2019 11:53am
It's been a crazy year.
