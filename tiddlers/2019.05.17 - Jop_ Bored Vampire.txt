How is your babysit's going?
FRI 12:42 PM
It goes well. I keep my journal of it here: https://philosopher.life/#Afterschool%20Teaching
FRI 12:45 PM
You can look through the Vault to read the timeline.
FRI 12:45 PM
(I have been told it is the easiest portion of my wiki to read and the most personable.)
FRI 12:46 PM
How about you? How's life going?
FRI 12:47 PM
I just finished reading the journal you sent me. I don't understand all of it but it seems like you like it .
FRI 12:58 PM
It's still not easy for me.
FRI 12:58 PM
I'm afraid you didn't click through the links. The link wasn't to the journal, it was a link to a collection of journal entries.
FRI 12:59 PM
The page you read was just an explanation of the project.
FRI 12:59 PM
This was yesterday's entry: https://philosopher.life/#2019.05.16%20-%20Afterschool%20Teaching%3A%20Pleasant
FRI 1:00 PM
I just want to talk to you.
FRI 1:00 PM
I can see that.
FRI 1:00 PM
I am talking to you over my wiki, lol.
FRI 1:01 PM
I don't want to read an encyclopedia.
FRI 1:01 PM
That is not an encyclopedia.
FRI 1:01 PM
What ever
FRI 1:02 PM
Haha
FRI 1:03 PM
Today is borring.
FRI 1:03 PM
I recommend reading and writing to fill in the boring gaps to everyone I meet, including those I babysit. =)
FRI 1:04 PM
Not for me
FRI 1:04 PM
That is what I usually hear.
FRI 1:05 PM
I said boring because today I was subbing with a teacher and she didn't let me do much.
FRI 1:06 PM
I'm sorry. =/
FRI 1:06 PM
And she always stop me when I try to help the kids.
FRI 1:07 PM
That is curious.
FRI 1:07 PM
Why do you think that is?
FRI 1:07 PM
There's a girl asked me about the paper work and she just yelled at the kid and said we already talked about it. But the girl didn't understand. And it's not a testing time.
FRI 1:09 PM
Sorry, I just want to complain.
FRI 1:09 PM
And when they use the restroom she said to the kids. Show Mrs.Metcalf you know how to use the restroom. (BS) They still play anyway.
FRI 1:12 PM
Lol. I love that you call bullshit. =)
FRI 1:13 PM
It's a valuable use of your time.
FRI 1:13 PM
Well, I'm sorry I try to be bad.
FRI 1:14 PM
?
FRI 1:14 PM
She just made me so angry.
FRI 1:15 PM
Are you still at working?
FRI 1:16 PM
I'm sorry she made you angry. I get pissed off quite often about my job as well.
FRI 1:17 PM
It's good to get it off your chest.
FRI 1:17 PM
School finishes next week.
FRI 1:17 PM
Thanks. Mine will be finished in two weeks.
FRI 1:19 PM
I guess you are at school right now.
FRI 1:21 PM
Well, no. I'm doing school with my kids though.
FRI 1:21 PM
Oh! What time do you work at the school?
FRI 1:22 PM
2:30
FRI 1:22 PM
Is that aftercare?
FRI 1:23 PM
Yup. That's why the log is called: Afterschool Teaching
FRI 1:25 PM
Do your kids come with you?
FRI 1:26 PM
I've been asked to bring them along, but I think it would be a complete waste of their time.
FRI 1:26 PM
I see

[[k0sh3k]]'s here:  http://k0sh3k.philosopher.life/
FRI 1:27 PM
Oh my! The have their own wiki.
FRI 1:28 PM
Aye, for a couple years now.
FRI 1:29 PM
On Sunday's, during Family Time, we read everyone's wiki entries for the week together and talk about it. It's been wonderful.
FRI 1:30 PM
It's been a good tool for empathizing with each other, stepping into each other's shoes, and thinking systematically about who we are together.
FRI 1:31 PM
Nice! It seems like you guys found something that you family like to do together.
FRI 1:32 PM
Aye. Although, it does more than that. It is proof of their schoolwork to us and for getting into college. It may be a resume. I think it helps them reason about how they tell themselves the stories of who they are (and how that evolves). Hopefully, it will be a tool of a lifetime for them.
FRI 1:34 PM
That is a smart family.
FRI 1:38 PM
Hopefully wise.
FRI 1:38 PM
Have to do what we can with what we have.
FRI 1:39 PM
When do officially fly out?
FRI 1:40 PM
June 2
FRI 1:40 PM
So soon
FRI 1:41 PM
On the way to Thailand it's not too difficult but on the way back it's going to be about 30 hours
FRI 1:41 PM
Hopefully you all will get some good sleep on the flight
FRI 1:41 PM
This morning I talked to my parents and my dad showed me around the house everything has changed so much I can't wait to see the house.
FRI 1:42 PM
I hope so too.
FRI 1:42 PM
That sounds exciting.
FRI 1:43 PM
Thank you [[h0p3]] for listening to me. And thank you for being a friend. I will also visit [[MWF]] and [[SLT]]. I can't wait to see them.
FRI 1:44 PM
Have a good time.
FRI 1:46 PM
It's nice to talk to you sorry I complained a lot but it feel good to get it out. You and me both need to get ready for the after care school, I'll talk to you later and kisses the kids for me please. Love
