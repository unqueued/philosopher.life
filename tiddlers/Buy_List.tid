* We have an extra SSD for each child. 2 SSDs, one for Linux, the other for the windows VM. 
* i5 should be up to the tasks they would need, including a windows VM. Video compression could be faster, but they can always turn the VM off to do that. 
* VT-D will allow serious passthrough.
* The GPU isn't godly, but they don't to play games which require max graphics. 
* I went AMD because passthrough may be easier with it.
* Ultimately, it will game, give them Windows applications more directly, but also allow them to live in Linux. Virtualization practice is very useful to have at their age.

Ultimately, if they want a better graphics card, they can always just buy another. The i5, I believe will last for a very long time. This is price efficient for the goal.
