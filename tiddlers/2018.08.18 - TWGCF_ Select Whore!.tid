title: 2018.08.18 - TWGCF: Select Whore!

I know you are still working on this gorgeous tool and the infrastructure for developing and distributing it. I have tested the tool on your demo several times. I gratefully request this with no expectations: I would like to get a feel for it on my own wiki and actually begin using it in production to develop more opinions about it. It might be a while before I get to do that I realize. Unfortunately, I don't know how to insert this into my wiki (although, I have tried a couple times). If and when you are ready, would you give me a set of instructions to insert this into my wiki (I'd like to be able to remove or modify it as this plugin develops)? It doesn't need to be a single drag and drop plugin; I'll work with whatever instructions you can give me. Obviously, you owe me nothing, and you can (and should) just tell me to figure it out for myself (you're already being generous to let us see your source).
