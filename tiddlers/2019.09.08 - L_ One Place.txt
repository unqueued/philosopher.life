Sunday is D&D day \o/

If I'd thought ahead I would have transferred all my DM stuff to my wiki first... RIP.

I hope you enjoy family time! Tell everyone I said hi and that I love them. :>
SEP 8 12:02 PM
Yay. I hope you have a great time.

You all have switched D&D days to Sunday.
SEP 8 12:37 PM
Hopefully, you can take your notes on the wiki for now.

I'm already updating my session notes at the very least. I will transfer everything eventually.

I know that feeling. So much to put into it from over the years.

Well, we tend to do it on Sundays now for family because it's easier for my parents to make it, particularly now that [[AG]] has a job at McD's.

I'm honestly kind of excited to put it all together though. It's been so satisfying to see it all in once place. :>
SEP 8 12:39 PM
