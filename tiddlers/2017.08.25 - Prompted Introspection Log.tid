!! How can you focus your wiki on your family?

* Add a page for each of them directly to the {[[Focus|Current Focus of h0p3's Wiki]]} page. 
* Write up Unschool Ideas individually.
** Don't even try to tie them together. Just go for it.
** Recall, again, they are suggestions, not expectations. They are hopes. They are a way for my children to see that their choices, whether good or bad for them, matter.
* Work more on: {[[Dreams|Dreams of h0p3]]} and related planning, devising, future-empathizing, and yes, even "dreaming," tools.
