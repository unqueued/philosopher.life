How's your day been?
MAY 2 7:25 PM
Pretty good —how are you?
MAY 2 8:16 PM
Been good. Productive enough, but not hard. Watching //Breaking Bad// with the family, atm. This is the third time I've tried with them, and it's finally clicking.
MAY 2 8:30 PM
I have tried watching it and though I enjoy the chemistry I haven’t gotten into it
MAY 2 9:16 PM

How's your day been?
MAY 3 6:15 PM
Pretty good:blush: How’s yours?
MAY 3 6:16 PM
Pretty good too, lol.
MAY 3 6:17 PM
What you up to this weekend?
MAY 3 6:17 PM
Mostly recovery. Registered for classes. My first one starts May 13th. Hoping to work some on the other room —need to finish the trim
MAY 3 6:18 PM
I hope your recovery goes well. Going full throttle. I assume your classes begin before school ends.
MAY 3 6:20 PM
Yes —it will be interesting :blush:
MAY 3 6:24 PM
Do you have plans for the weekend?
MAY 3 6:24 PM
I know...you could get a new kitten for [[k0sh3k]] for mother’s day!
MAY 3 6:25 PM
A week early
MAY 3 6:25 PM
Reading and writing.
MAY 3 6:25 PM
Hehe
MAY 3 6:25 PM
That is terrible. 2 is my limit.
MAY 3 6:25 PM
I'm never gonna budge. NEVA!
MAY 3 6:25 PM
Yeah she said...I figured I would try
MAY 3 6:26 PM
:kissing_cat:
MAY 3 6:26 PM
She will be grateful for your attempt, lol.
MAY 3 6:27 PM
She's zonked, crazy week (and next week too for her), so I'm hoping she'll take it easy.
MAY 3 6:27 PM
Really a kitten would be like 2.25 cats :cat2:
MAY 3 6:27 PM
I bet —she’s a hard worker
MAY 3 6:28 PM
I've been arguing to her that she clearly wants a dog. She wants a thing to sit in her lap permanently (except me!).
MAY 3 6:28 PM
Oooo dogs are nice too
MAY 3 6:29 PM
Our little one is demanding that I share my dinner even now
MAY 3 6:29 PM

MAY 3 6:29 PM
But Prim is the sweetest of all of them...she is probably 100 lbs now
MAY 3 6:30 PM
Not sure [[k0sh3k]] wants 100 lbs on her lap
MAY 3 6:41 PM
Definitely not. She is becoming more sensitive and bruises easier as she ages too. The kids have to be careful with her too.
MAY 3 6:43 PM
Oh no —so yes then it must be a kitten
MAY 3 6:43 PM
Lol. =)
MAY 3 6:45 PM
She wants a savannah cat.
MAY 3 6:45 PM
Ooooo
MAY 3 6:45 PM
That thing could eat a child.
MAY 3 6:46 PM
No thank you.
