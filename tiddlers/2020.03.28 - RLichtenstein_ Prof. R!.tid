I agree the goal is to discuss [[your|R!]] ideas and site. As you know, that will be difficult for me to do without coming to the table with my own point of view (which is often wrong and arrogantly so sometimes), but I will aim to minimize chit-chat and developing a personal relationship. Given the size of your work, this may take quite some time. I am slow, and please feel free to take as long as you wish to respond (or even ignore me if it suits you); and, obviously, I consider it a gift that you would take time out of your day to think about your work with me. Please feel free to let me know if you feel this isn't worth our time. It is my honor; thank you for the opportunity.

Sincerely,
