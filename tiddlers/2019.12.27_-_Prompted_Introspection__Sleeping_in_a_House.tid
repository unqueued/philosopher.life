title: 2019.12.27 - Prompted Introspection: Sleeping in a House

!! How do you feel when you sleep at some one's house?

It's extremely rare that I don't sleep at someone's house. I have a very strong preference for sleeping in a house, preferably with at least an inch of padding between me and whatever hard surface there may be. I do go camping once in a great while, though I kind of think of that as [[Humanity]]'s house. I take it back, I think I always sleep at someone's house. 

I have a very wide range of feelings while I'm sleeping too. I'd like to think that I'm fairly relaxed most of the time, but if I'm sleeping at someone else's house or feel insecure even in my own house, I'm less likely to sleep well. If I'm anxious enough, I will enter into a kind of half-brained sleep mode where it feels like I'm partially aware of my surroundings throughout the night (ready to pounce out of my daze). I don't think I'm terribly aware while I'm sleeping though, but I especially enjoy that feeling of sections of the world entering into my consciousness. Sound is particularly exciting, since I'll be there talking to myself, and then the sound around me just comes out of nowhere, piercing into my [[phenomenology]].
