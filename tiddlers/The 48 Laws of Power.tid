title: The 48 Laws of Power

//This terrifyingly effective Neo-Machiavellian training manual is filled with contradictions and icky advice. Unfortunately, selections of these laws are often descriptively accurate reflections of dark-triadic motivations and social means-to-ends reasoning in various contexts. That doesn't mean this work is coherent, self-consistent, or justified prescription. Know your enemies who believe reality is whatever they can get away with.//

Law 1: Never outshine the master.

* Make those above you feel superior. Do not show your talents too much, it’ll make them insecure.
* Make the master appear more brilliant than they are.
* Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment, envy and other manifestations of insecurity.
* While you cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others, with those above you, you must take a different approach.
* The master may feign appreciation, but at the first opportunity, he will replace you with someone less intelligent, attractive and threatening.
* Use discreet flattery with your master.
* If your ideas are more creative than your master’s, ascribe them to him, in as public a manner as possible.
* By letting others outshine you, you remain in control, instead of being a victim to their insecurity.
* You cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across, but you must be selectively cruel.
* If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing to fear from outshining him. Outdo, outcharm, and outsmart him at key moments.

Law 2: Never put too much trust in friends, learn to use enemies.

* Friends will quickly betray you.
* Hire former enemies, they’ll be loyal because they have more to prove. Your enemies are an untapped gold mine that you must learn to exploit.
* The problem is you often do not know your friends as well as you imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend each other.
* Since honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels.
* When you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualities he/she has kept hidden.
* The receipt of favor can become oppressive — it means you have been chosen because you are a friend, not because you are deserving. There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring a friend that afflicts them. The more favors and gifts you supply to revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive.
* Keep friends for friendship, but work with the skilled and competent.

Law 3: Conceal your intentions.

* Don't be honest whenever it doesn't benefit you.
* Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions.
* If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense.  
* Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelope them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late.
* Use decoyed objects of desire and red herrings to throw people off the scent. Use false sincerity, send ambiguous signals, set up misleading objects of desire. Unable to distinguish the genuine from the false, they cannot pick out your real goal.
* By making yourself too predictable and familiar, it becomes almost impossible to respect or fear you, and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions.
* Basic to an ability to conceal one’s intentions is a simple truth about human nature — our first instinct is to always trust appearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and hear — constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else would exhaust and terrify us.
* A tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments. Most people will believe you have experienced a change of heart since it is so unusual to play so lightly with something as emotional as one’s opinions and values.
* Never appear overpassionate and you raise suspicions. Be measured and believable or your ruse will seem the put-on that it is.
* To make your false sincerity believable, espouse a belief in honesty and forthrightness as important social values. Do this as publicly as possible. Emphasize your position on this subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt thought — though only one that is meaningless or irrelevant.
* The best deceivers use a bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention to themselves. They know that extravagant words and gestures immediately raise suspicion, but people will fail to imagine that the bland and harmless person they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up something else.
* One of the most effective smokescreen is the noble gesture. People want to believe noble gestures are genuine, for the belief is pleasant.
* No smokescreen, red herring, etc. will succeed in concealing your intentions if you already have an established reputation for deception

Law 4: Always say less than necessary.

* When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. 
* Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike.
* Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.
* Your silence will make other people uncomfortable. Humans are machines of interpretation and explanation; they have to know what you are thinking. When you carefully control what you reveal, they cannot pierce your intentions or meaning.
* The less you say, the more profound and mysterious you appear.
* There are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion and insecurity, especially in your superiors.

Law 5: So much depends on reputation – guard it with your life.

* Reputation is the cornerstone of power.
* Reputation alone will make you win.
* Destroy enemies by attacking their reputation. Then stand aside and let the public hang them.
* Reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of appearances, distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what you are really like, and giving you a degree of control over how the world judges you — a powerful position to be in.
* Make your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality.
* A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your strengths without you having to spend much energy. It can also create an aura around you that will instill respect or fear.
* If you have already stained your reputation and are prevented from establishing a new one — then it is better to associate with someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name to whitewash and elevate yours.
* Reputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. When you’re first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, anticipating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies — that reveals insecurity, not confidence in your reputation.

Law 6: Court attention at all cost.

* Everything is judged by appearance, what is unseen counts for nothing.
* Never get lost in a crowd or into oblivion.
* Be mysterious, magnetic, and appear more colorful than the masses.
* Do anything to make yourself seem larger than life.
* Make no distinction between kinds of attention — notoriety of any sort will bring you power. Better to be slandered and attacked than ignored.
* If you find yourself in a lowly position that offers little opportunity for you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack the most visible, most famous, most powerful person you can find.
* Once in the limelight, you must constantly renew it by adapting and varying your method of courting attention. If you don’t, the public will grow tired of you, take you for granted and move on to a newer star.
* The mysterious invites layers of interpretation, excites our imagination and seduces us into believing that it conceals something marvelous. Mysterious people put others in a kind of inferior position — that of trying to figure them out.
* Never appear overly greedy for attention, for it signals insecurity and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are times when it is not in your interest to be the center of attention.

Law 7: Let others do the work for you, but always take credit.

* Use the skills of others to do the work for you, never do yourself what others can do for you. Your efficiency will appear god-like.
* Do not be naive: at this moment, while you are slaving away on some project, there are vultures circling above you trying to figure out a way to survive and thrive off your creativity. It is useless to complain about this or wear yourself ragged with bitterness. Better to protect yourself and join the game.
* There is another application of this law that does not require the parasitic use of your contemporaries labor: use the past, a vast storehouse of knowledge and wisdom.
* Be sure you know when letting other people share the credit serves your purpose. It is especially important to not be greedy when you have a master above you

Law 8: Make other people come to you – use bait if necessary.

* When you force others to act, you’re in control.
* Make opponents come to you.
* Lure with gains, then attack.
* Aggressive action is not effective action. Most often the most effective action is to stay back, keep calm and let others be frustrated by the traps you lay for them, playing for long-term power instead of a quick victory.
* There are opposite cases where striking suddenly and aggressively at the enemy demoralizes him.

Law 9: Win through your actions, never through argument.

* Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: the resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. 
* The problem with trying to prove a point through argument is that, in the end, you can never be certain how it affects the people you’re arguing with. They may appear to agree with you politely, but inside they may resent you.
* It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.

Law 10: Avoid the unhappy and the unlucky.

* You’ll die from other’s misery – emotional states are as infectious as diseases.
* The unfortunate draw misfortune on themselves and will draw it on you.
* Associate with the happy and fortunate.
* In the game of power, the people you associate with are critical. The risk of associating with infectors is that you will waste valuable time and energy trying to free yourself.
* There is only one solution to infection: quarantine. Do not take pity, and do not enmesh yourself in trying to help.

Law 11: Learn to keep people dependent on you.

* To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. 
* Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough so that they can do without you.
* The ultimate power is the power to get people to do as you wish. When you can do this without having to force people or hurt them, when they willingly grant you what you desire, then your power is untouchable.
* The best way to do this is to create a relationship of dependence. The master requires your services; he is weak or unable to function without you; you have enmeshed yourself in his work so deeply that doing away with you would bring him great difficulty. Once such a relationship is established, you have the upper hand.
* The ultimate form of power is not independence. The completely independent man would love in a cabin in the woods, but he would have no power. The best you can hope for is that others will grow so dependent on you that you enjoy a kind of reverse independence: their need for you frees you.

Law 12: Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.

* One sincere move will cover over a dozen dishonest ones.
* Honesty can bring down the guard of suspicious people.
* Open their shield with honesty or timely Trojan horse gift, then deceive.
* Selective honesty is best employed on your first encounter with someone. We are all creatures of habit, and our first impressions last a long time. If someone believes you are honest at the start of your relationship it takes a lot to convince them otherwise. 

Law 13: When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy.

* If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself.
* When you beg them for help, you emphasize their position and power. They are strong enough to need nothing from you except the chance to feel superior. This is the wine that intoxicates them.
* There is an art to asking for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person you are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs.
* Self-interest is the lever that will move people. Train yourself to think your way inside the other person’s mind, to see their needs and interests.
* Some people will see an appeal to their self-interest as ugly and ignoble. They prefer to exercise charity, mercy, and justice as a way of feeling superior to you.

Law 14: Pose as a friend, work as a spy.

* Learn to probe and find valuable information.
* Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. 
* Better still, play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.
* Practice this tactic with caution and care. If people begin to suspect you are worming secrets out of them under the banner of conversation, they will avoid you. Emphasize friendly chatter, not valuable information.
* By pretending to bare your heart to another person, you make them more likely to reveal their own secrets.
* Just as you spy on other people, you must be prepared for others to spy on you.
* You can feed wrong information.

Law 15: Crush your enemy totally.

* More is lost through stopping halfway: the enemy will recover and seek revenge.
* Crush your enemy in body and spirit. 
* If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.

Law 16: Use absence to increase respect and honor.

* Too much circulation makes the price go down: the more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear.
* If you’re already established in a group, temporarily withdraw to make people talk.
* Create value through scarcity.
* At the right moment, you must learn to withdraw yourself before they unconsciously push you away. It is a game of hide-and-seek.
* The moment you allow yourself to be treated like anyone else, it is too late — you are swallowed and digested. To prevent this, you need to starve the other person of your absence. Force their respect by threatening them with the possibility that they will lose you for good; create a pattern of absence and presence.
* In the beginning, make yourself omnipresent. Only what is seen, appreciated and loved will be missed in its absence.

Law 17: Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability.

* Being predictable gives control to others.
* Behavior that isn’t consistent will wear people out, and they’ll stop trying to explain things.
* When used to the extreme, you’ll intimidate and terrorize.
* Predictability can work in your favor — you can lull people to sleep with a smokescreen.

Law 18: Do not build fortresses to protect yourself – isolation is dangerous.

* Isolation cuts you off from valuable information.
* It's better to mingle, make friends, and then you are shielded from your enemy in a crowd.
* Fortresses cut you off from help and cut into your flexibility. Everyone knows where you are.
* Power depends on social interaction and circulation.
* The effects of long-term isolation on the human mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail combined with an inability to see the larger picture, a kind of extravagant ugliness that no longer communicates.
* As a temporary recourse, isolation can help you gain perspective.

Law 19: Know who you’re dealing with – do not offend the wrong person.

* Never assume everyone will react the same way.
* Choose your victims carefully.
* Never offend the wrong person.
* Although he may initially disguise it, the arrogant/proud man’s touchy price makes him very dangerous. If at any point in your dealings with a person, you sense an oversensitive and overactive pride, flee.
* The hopelessly insecure man will attack you in bites that will take forever to get big enough for you to notice. If you find you have deceived such a person, disappear for a long time.
* Play on a suspicious man's nature to get him to turn against other people.
* Serpent's with a long memory will show no anger on the surface, cold and unaffectionate, he will calculate and wait. Be doubly careful of this snake, and if you have somehow injured him, either crush him completely or get him out of your sight.
* The plain, unassuming and often unintelligent man will waste your time, energy, resources and even your sanity in trying to deceive him.
* The ability to measure people and to know who you’re dealing with is the most important skill of all in gathering and conserving power.
* Never trust appearances.

Law 20: Do not commit to anyone.

* Fools rush to pick a side.
* Do not commit to a cause but yourself.
* Maintain independence.
* Make people chase you and play people against one another.
* Do not commit to anyone, but be courted by all. If you allow people to feel they possess you to any degree, you lose all power over them By not committing your affections, they will only try harder to win you over. Stay aloof and you gain the power that comes from their attention and frustrated desire. Play the Virgin Queen: give them hope but never satisfaction.
* When you hold yourself back, you incur not anger but respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make yourself ungraspable, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the relationship as most people do.
* Do not let people drag you into their petty fights and squabbles. Seem interested and supportive, but find a way to remain neutral; let others do the fighting while you stand back, watch and wait. When the fighting parties are good and tired they will be ripe for the picking. You can make it a practice, in fact, to stir up quarrels between other people, and then offer to mediate, gaining power as the go-between.
* Eventually you may find it worthwhile to commit to one side — if only for appearance’s sake.
* Energy wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength.

Law 21: Play a sucker to catch a sucker by seeming dumber than your mark.

* Don’t be stupid, but make your mark appear smarter than you.
* Making them appear smarter hides your motives.
* Given how important the idea of intelligence is to most people’s vanity, it is critical to never insult or impugn a person’s brain power.
* At the start of your climb to the top, you cannot play too stupid. You may want to let your bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter than the competition around you.
* A show of intelligence can help you get out of a scrape.

Law 22: Use the surrender tactic to transform weakness into power.

* When you’re weaker, never fight just for honor but surrender.
* Do not give them the satisfaction to win, surrender.
* Turn the other cheek to infuriate them. Surrender also offers a way of mocking your enemies, of turning their power against them.
* The next time someone pushes you, try this: do not resist or fight back, but yield. This often neutralizes their behaviour.

Law 23: Concentrate your forces.

* Intensity defeats extensity every time.
* Find a fat cow that’ll give you milk for a long time.
* Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another. 
* Gain the competitive advantage, be a specialist rather than a jack-of-all-trades.

Law 24: Play the perfect courtier.

* Mastered the art of indirection, flattery, yielding to superiors, and asserting power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner. 
* The successful courtier walks a tightrope — pleasing but not pleasing too much, obeying but somehow distinguishing himself from the other courtiers, while also never distinguishing himself so far as to make the ruler insecure.
* Great courtiers throughout history have mastered the science of manipulating people. They make the king feel more kingly; they make everyone else fear their power.
* Avoid ostentation, and never prattle on about yourself or call too much attention to your actions.
* Practice nonchalance, and never seem to be working too hard. Your talent must appear to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people take you for a genius rather than a workaholic. Even if something demands a lot of sweat, make it look effortless.
* Be frugal with flattery because too much of a good thing loses its value.
* Arrange to be noticed, pay attention to your physical appearance, and find a way to create a distinctive — a subtly distinctive style and image.
* Never be the bearer of bad news.
* Never affect friendliness or intimacy with your master because he just wants a subordinate.
* Never criticize those above you directly.
* Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know when to stop.
* Never joke about appearance or taste.
* Express admiration for the good work of others.
* Your way of thinking must keep up with the times.
* Be a source of pleasure.

Law 25: Re-create yourself.

* Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Create or re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. 
* Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you. 
* Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions — your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.
* Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment requires. Adapt your mask to the situation.
* Remember that overacting can be counterproductive — it is another way of spending too much effort trying to attract attention. Further, bad acting is bad acting.

Law 26: Keep your hands clean.

* You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. 
* Use others as scapegoats to disguise your involvement.
* Everyone makes mistakes, but those who are truly clever manage to hide them, and to make sure someone else is blamed. A convenient scapegoat should always be kept around for such moments.
* It is often wise to choose the most innocent victim possible as a sacrificial goal. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight you, and their naive protests may be seen as protesting too much, as a sign of their guilt.
* Let someone else be the executioner, or the bearer of bad news, while you bring only joy and glad tidings.
* You will often find it necessary to expend energy to cause an evil but necessary action. But you must never appear to be this action’s agent. Find a cat’s paw.
* You may also find cases in which deliberately offering yourself as the cat’s paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is the ruse of the perfect courtier. As the instrument that protects a master or peer from unpleasantness or danger, you gain immense respect.
* There are moments when it is advantageous to not disguise your involvement or responsibility, but rather take the blame yourself for some mistake. If you have power and are secure in it, you can sometimes ask for forgiveness. It is the ploy of the king who makes a show of his own sacrifices for the good of the people.

Law 27: Play on people’s need to believe to create a cultlike following.

* People want to believe in something.
* Become the focal point of this and offer them a cause, a new faith.
* Keep your words vague but full of promise.
* Emphasize enthusiasm over rationality.
* Give your new disciples rituals to perform and ask them to make sacrifices.

Law 28: Enter action with boldness.

* If you’re unsure then don’t do it.
* Timidity is dangerous.
* Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity.
* Everyone admires boldness, no one honors the timid.
* We may disguise our timidity as a concern for others, a desire not to hurt or offend, but in fact, we are really self-absorbed, worried about ourselves and how others perceive us.

Law 29: Plan all the way to the end.

* The ending is everything.
* Take into account of scenario.
* If you plan, you won’t be overwhelmed.
* Guide fortune by thinking far ahead.
* The ability to ignore immediate pleasure or dangers translates into power; most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan with this kind of foresight.
* Develop the power of being able to overcome the natural human tendency to react to things as they happen, and instead to train oneself to step back, imagining the larger things taking shape beyond one’s immediate vision.
* Your plan must include alternatives and have a degree of flexibility. Build in alternatives and be open to new routes towards your goal.

Law 30: Make your accomplishments seem effortless.

* Conceal and teach no one your clever tricks: make your success seem natural.
* Do not reveal how hard you work because, as humans, we admire things that move effortlessly and easily.
* It’s the idea of sprezzatura, the capacity to make the difficult seem easy. All the great Renaissance artists carefully kept their works under wraps. Only the finished masterpiece could be shown to the public. They knew that the making of the works would mar the magic of their effect, and their studied atmosphere of ease and natural beauty.
* Conceal your tricks and shortcuts not only to maintain competitive advantage but also because when you let this information out, you give people ideas they can use against you. You lose the advantages of keeping silent.
* The secrecy with which you surround your actions must seem lighthearted in spirit. A zeal to conceal your work makes you look like you’re taking the game too seriously.
* There are also times when revealing the inner working of your projects can prove worthwhile. It all depends on your audience’s taste, and on the times in which you operate.

Law 31: Control the opinions: get others to play with the cards you deal.

* The best deceptions seem to give the other person a choice. Your victims feel they are in control but are actually your puppets.
* Give options so no matter their choice, you win. Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of a dilemma: they are gored wherever they turn.
* When examined closely, the choices we have, in the marketplace, elections, jobs, tend to have noticeable limitations: they are often a matter of a choice simply between A and B, with the rest of the alphabets out of the picture.
* As long as the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the missing options. We “choose” to believe that the game is fair and that we have our freedom.
* This unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices stems from the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of anxiety. Unlimited options would paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Therefore, setting up a narrow range of choices should always be part of your deceptions.
* Colour the choices: propose 3–4 choices of action for each situation, and present them in a way that the one you prefer always seemed the best solution compared to the others.
* Force the resister with reverse psychology: push people to “choose” what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.
* Alter the playing field by attacking the logistics and dependencies of other options.
* Raise the price every time a buyer hesitates and another day goes by.
* It is often wise to implicate in your deceptions the very person who can do you the most harm if you fail.
* Controlling the options has one main purpose — disguise yourself as the agent of power and punishment. The tactic works best for those whose power is fragile and cannot operate too openly without incurring suspicion, resentment, and anger.

Law 32: Play to people’s fantasies.

* The truth is unpleasant, avoid it. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.
* Never be distracted by people’s glamorous portraits of themselves and their lives; search and dig for what really imprisons them.
* The Reality: change is slow and gradual. It requires hard work, a bit of luck, a fair amount of self-sacrifice and a lot of practice.
** The Fantasy: a sudden transformation will bring a total change in one’s fortunes, bypassing work, luck, self-sacrifice and time in one fantastic stroke.
* The Reality: the social realm has hard-set codes and boundaries. We understand these limits and know that we have to move within the same familiar circles, day in and day out.
** The Fantasy: we can enter a totally new world with different codes and the promise of adventure, skirting the sexual and relief from boredom.
* The Reality: society is fragmented and full of conflict.
** The Fantasy: people can come together in a mystical union of souls.
* The Reality: death. The dead cannot be brought back, the past cannot be changed.
** The Fantasy: a sudden reversal of this intolerable fact.
* The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure and promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering should be ungraspable.
* Never come too close to the place where you are actually expected to produce results. 

Law 33: Discover each man’s thumbscrew.

* Find other’s weaknesses.
* It's usually insecurity, uncontrollable emotions, secret pressures.
* Everyday conversation supplies the richest mine of weaknesses, so train yourself to listen
* Pay attention to gestures and unconscious signals. Start by always seeming interested. Appear to open up to the other person, share a secret with them. If you suspect someone has a particular soft spot, probe on it indirectly. Find people’s idols, the things they worship and will do anything to get.
* Find the helpless child. Most weaknesses begin in childhood, before the self builds up compensatory defenses. Knowing about a childhood need gives you a powerful key to a person’s weakness. One sign of this weakness is when you touch on it, the person will often act like a child.
* Playing on people’s weakness has one significant danger — you may stir up an action you cannot control.

Law 34: Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one.

* The way you carry yourself determines how you’re treated. Appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you.
* Kings respect themselves and inspire the same in others. By acting confident you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown to those who will think we must have reasons to feel so confident.
* Be overcome by your self-belief. Even while you know you are practicing a kind of deception on yourself, act like a king. You are likely to be treated as one.
* Go after the highest person in the building. This immediately puts you on the same plane as the chief executive you are attacking. By choosing a great opponent, you create the appearance of greatness.
* Give some sort of gift to those above you.
* The idea behind a regal demeanor is to set yourself apart from other people. But if you take this too far, it will be your undoing. Never make the mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself by humiliating people.

Law 35: Master the art of timing.

* Never seem in a hurry because hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself and over time. Instead, always seem patient.
* Sniff out the spirit of the times, find the trends that’ll give you power.
* Learn to stand back when not ready, and then strike.

Law 36: Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge.

* Acknowledging petty problems gives them existence.
* When you acknowledge an enemy you make them stronger.
* The more you a mistake visible, the worse it gets.
* If you want something but can’t have it, disdain it.
* The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.
* Turn your back on what you want, show your contempt and disdain. This kind of response drives your targets crazy.
* Commitment and engagement often weakens you. By paying undue attention to a puny enemy, you look puny and the longer it takes you to crush such an enemy, the larger the enemy seems. And if you succeed in crushing the irritant, you create sympathy for the weaker side.
* Sour-Grapes: don’t complain and draw attention to your disappointment. Act as if it never interested you in the first place.
* When you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people’s attention by making it clear that the attack did not even register. Though, among equals, this tactic might backfire.

Law 37: Create compelling spectacles.

* Striking imagery and symbolic gestures create the aura of power and people respond.
* Stage spectacles for those around you and heighten your presence.
* Dazzle by appearance.
* Words put you on the defensive; the image imposes itself as a given.
* Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color have enormous symbolic resonance.
* The best way to use images and symbols is to organize them into a grand spectacle that awes people and distracts them from unpleasant realities.

Law 38: Think as you like but behave like others.

* By flaunting your unconventional ways people will only think you want attention. They’ll punish you for making them feel inferior, therefore: blend in.
* Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.
* We all tell lies and hide our true feelings, for complete free expression is a social impossibility.
* There are people who see such restraints as an intolerable infringement on their freedom, and who have a need to prove the superiority of their values and beliefs. In the end, their arguments convince only a few and offend a great deal more. The reason arguments do not work is that most people hold their ideas and values without thinking about them.
* Wise and clever people learn early on that they can display conventional behavior and mouth conventional ideas without having to believe in them.
* The logical extension of this practice is the invaluable ability to be all things to all people. People will swallow the bait because it flatters them to believe that you share their ideas.
* The only time worth standing out is when you already stand out — when you have achieved an unshakable position of power and can display your difference from others as a sign of distance between you.
* There is always a place for the gadfly, the person who successfully defies custom and mocks what has grown lifeless in a culture.

Law 39: Stir up waters to catch fish.

* Anger and emotion are counterproductive, so stay calm and objective.
* Rattle your enemies to make them emotional while you stay calm.
* Anger is not power, but a sign of helplessness. People may temporarily be cowed by your tantrums, but in the end they lose respect for you. They also realize they can easily undermine a person with so little self-control.
* Once you have trained yourself not to take matters personally, you can play with the emotional responses of other people.
* In the face of a hot-headed enemy, an excellent response is no response. Nothing is as infuriating as a man who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs.
* When playing with people’s emotions you have to be careful. Study the enemy beforehand: some fish are best left at the bottom of the pond.
* There are also times where a well-timed burst of anger can do you good, but your anger must be manufactured and under your control. Then you can determine exactly how and on whom it will fall.

Law 40: Despise taking the free lunch.

* What is offered for free is dangerous — it usually involves a trick or a hidden obligation. 
* What has worth is worth paying for. 
* The powerful learn early to protect their most valuable resource: independence and room to maneuver.
* By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. 
* Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power. Hence, give free lunches, but don't take them.

Law 41: Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes.

* What happens first always appears better and more original than what’s next.
* Following great people means you must double their effort or power to outshine them.
* Do not get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making. 
* Slay the overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own way.
* Never let yourself be seen as following your predecessors. If you do you will never surpass him. You must physically demonstrate your difference, by establishing a style and symbolism that sets you apart.
* Hunt out the vacuums, the areas in a culture that have been left vacant and in which you can become the first and principal figure to shine.
* Be prepared to return to square one psychologically.
* The shadow of a predecessor can be used to your advantage if it is chosen as a trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought you power.
* The past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that would be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself.

Law 42: Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.

* Trouble can be traced to a single individual.
* These people will influence others.
* Do not negotiate but banish them.
* Strike at the source of the trouble.
* In every group, power is concentrated in the hands of one or two people — for people will congregate around a single strong personality. A key element in games of strategy is isolating the enemy’s power.
* If you act to isolate your enemy, make sure he lacks the means to repay the favor.

Law 43: Work on the hearts and minds of others.

* Coercion will work against you.
* Seduce others into wanting to move in your direction.
* Seduce others by operating on their individual psychologies and weaknesses.
* Soften them by working their emotions and what they fear.
* Ignore the hearts and minds and they will grow to hate you.
* In the game of power, you are surrounded by people who have absolutely no reason to help you unless it is in their self-interest to do so. And if you have nothing to offer, you are likely to make them hostile.
* The key to persuasion is softening people up and breaking them down gently. Work on their emotions and play on their intellectual weaknesses Be alert to both what separates them from everyone one else, and what they share with everyone else.

Law 44: Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect.

* When you mirror exactly what your enemies do, they cannot figure out your strategy.
* The mirror effect mocks and humiliates them, making them overreact.
* Hold a mirror to their psyches and you’ll seduce them and they’ll think they share your values.
* Mirror their actions and they learn lessons.
* If we look hard at the reflected image, we sometimes feel that we are seeing ourselves as others see us, as a person among other people, an object. That feeling makes us shudder.
* Do what your enemies do, following their actions as best you can, and they cannot see what you are up to — they are blinded by your mirror. Neutralize their strategy by playing a game of mimicry with them.
* You look deep into the souls of other people; fathom their innermost desires, their values, their tastes, their spirits and you reflect it back to them.
* When you mirror what other people have done to you, you can do so in a way that makes them realize you are doing to them exactly what they did to you.
* Create a perfect copy of an object, a place, a person. The copy acts as a kind of dummy, people take it for the real thing because it has the physical appearance of the real thing.

Law 45: Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once.

* Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level, people are creatures of habit. Too much innovation is traumatic and will lead to revolt.
* If you are new to a position of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is necessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past.
* Preach change as much as you like, but give them the comforting appearance of older events and traditions.
* Another strategy to disguise change is to make a loud and public display of support for the values of the past.
* The answer to the innate conservatism is to play the courtier’s game. Pay lip service to tradition. Identify elements in your revolution that can be made to seem to build on the past.
* The past is a corpse to be used as you see fit. If what happened in the recent past was painful and harsh, it is self-destructive to associate yourself with it.
* If you make a bold change from the past, you must avoid at all costs the appearance of a void or vacuum, or you will create terror. Fill that space immediately with new rituals and forms.

Law 46: Never appear too perfect.

* Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. 
* It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. 
* Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.
* The human has a hard time dealing with feelings of inferiority. In the face of superior skill, talent or power, we are often disturbed or ill at ease — because most of us have an inflated sense of ourselves. When we meet people who surpass us they make it clear to us that we are in fact mediocre.
* To deflect envy, subtly emphasize how lucky you have been, to make your happiness seem more attainable to other people.
* Disguise your power as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a source of happiness — and you make it seem less enviable. Emphasize your troubles and you turn a potential danger into a source of moral support.
* Act before envy takes root. However, once envy is there, it is sometimes best to affect the opposite approach — display the utmost disdain for those who envy you.

Law 47: Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory know when to stop.

* The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head. 
* There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop.

Law 48: Assume formlessness.

* By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. 
* Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes.
* The powerful are often people who in their youth have shown immense creativity in expressing something new through a new form. Society grants them power because it hungers for and rewards this sort of newness.
* The problem comes later when they often grow conservative and possessive. They no longer dream of creating new forms; their identities are set, their habits congeal and their rigidity make them easy targets.
* The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself to take nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness.
* Learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing events through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out the laws that others preach, the books they write to tell you what to do, and the sage advice of the elder.
* Rely too much on other people’s ideas and you end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much respect for other people’s wisdom will make you depreciate your own.
