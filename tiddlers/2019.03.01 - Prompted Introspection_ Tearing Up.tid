!! Is there a movie that has brought you to tears? Tell about it.

I don't watch a lot of movies; the [[S2NR]] ratio isn't good enough for me. I do watch movies I've seen before though to reflect on them again. They are lenses to me. At this point, I only watch new movies I'm told to watch. I can't recall the last time I went out of my way to find a new one for myself. That practice started dying almost a decade ago for me.

Of my [[Film: Library]], I cry almost every single fucking time I watch //Samsara//. There's not a single word spoken in the film, but it's beautiful. You know a film is powerful when it's the moving pictures themselves which tell the entire story. I've never seen a depiction of [[Humanity]] anything like it before (though I've seen //Baraka// and that other one). I don't understand why other people aren't completely blown away by the film. Why does this film not shatter them? I ain't a fancy man, so I assume this isn't a sophisticated film; it's just gripping.
