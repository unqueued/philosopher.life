title: ARAM: Annie

Annie is a burst damage initiation mage. She ultimately doesn't do a ton of damage, imho. She compresses fights into a small window with significant AOE Stun and damage that a good team can follow to cleanup. The counterinitiation is also quite strong. Knowing how to initiate with Annie is basically the primary skill. With impeccable timing, she can begin fights or turn the tide of a battle. When Annie is ahead, she is very good at staying ahead. Furthermore, there are very few champions who can pick a squishy and just kill them outright. As long as your positioning is good, you can either zone a champion or combo them out almost entirely. 

* Summoners
** Snowball - The fact is that she desperately needs gap closers
** Flash - Duh
* Build
** Items
*** Start
**** Catalyst of Aeons
**** Refillable Potion
*** General Build
**** Rod of Ages - I'm not sold on this for Annie. She desperately needs CDR. She is also incredibly squishy. This is a strong early game item, and it gives her just a pinch of survivability, which an initiator often needs.
**** Sorcerer's Shoes - You are a burst mage who doesn't seem to scale very well.
**** Morellonomicon - The CDR is really the key here. You are an ult-bot. 
**** Hextech Protobelt-01 - Getting in range to Ult is that important. She also wants to drop as much damage as possible and get the fuck out while she builds towards another stun.
**** Banshee's Veil - I think this is one of the stronger items in ARAM. It has CDR, and Annie is completely an ult bolt. Against most teams, I value the magic resist.
***** Otherwise, pickup Zhonya's Hourglass, which is amazing post initiation.
**** Void Staff - There's usually some magic resist you need to punch through. This can be so valuable that you want to build it early, and it even makes me rethink Rod of Ages.
