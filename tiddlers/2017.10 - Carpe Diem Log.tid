!! Audit:

* Mathematics Count: 16
** We took a week off, I started late in the month. We're over halfway through.
* Cannabliss Count: 13
** That is far less than I thought.
** I've just been so busy I don't know if I have time for it. 
** It does help me write.
* Inform the Men! Count: 8
** Roughly every 3.875 days. That's almost twice a week, and you had a trip this month.
* Fireman Time! Count: 36
** You horny son-of-a-bitch, lol.
* After losing my job, I can see I've still been quite productive. 
** This month has felt difficult, and my chest pains are there, but looking back, I feel like it has actually been easier than the previous month. This is a "break" for me after going balls to the wall for most of the year.
*** Although, I'm still going balls-to-the-wall.
* I need to think about why //The Nix// petered out.
* I've watched more new shows this month than I have in a very long time.
* I've been intentional in talking with people I care about.
* Keeping a morning routine has been very useful. It keeps in the productive spirit, out of depressive tendencies, etc. I think it has been useful to my offspring as well.
* Looking through our food, we really do eat nicely. It might not be pretty, but we eat fun stuff.
** Although, I'm quite worried I'm just getting fatter again.
* I hate to say it, but I'm really picky about my cartoons. It's hard to find narratives that hit me the right way.
* I've done a lot of cleaning and organizing this month. It shows too. The house is nicer looking than it has been in months.
* I've spent a ton of time in front of monster-10.
* I feel like I've lost of the get-up-and-go, go, go, go that I had at the beginning of the month. My pace has languished somewhat. 
** D2? You have felt off. I'm not sure. I don't think the kids feel that way. I'm still learning to be a father when they need to be already be a good one. You aren't perfect. Be kind to yourself. Just do your best.
* My son has been using his computer. I'm glad I got that setup for him. It's good to see him back on it. He has been caring for his machine this time. I'm proud of him.
* NCCER has picked up.
* It feels like I've had fewer sexual activities this month, but by Jabba, it was outstanding when I did.
* I should setup VPN clients for the laptop and phone.
* I have done a ton of reading and writing this month. It's been outstanding.
* Books+Art was a wonderful project. I didn't end up making what I thought I'd make, but it turned out awesomely. I'm glad we all contributed to it.
* We're being more careful with our grocery shopping than we have been in the past. We're getting it down to an efficiency level that I like.
* My daughter is still on the quest I've sent her to finish //Dune//. This is getting ridiculous.
* Car troubles, as usual. Lol.
* I think the last half of the month has been more difficult for us than the first half.
** My posts are shorter too, on average.
* I think my children need to follow their morning routines more closely, and I think they need a nightly routine that makes sense.
* The chest tightness has not gone away. But, I've been productive with it. Stoicism.
* I wonder if I need to start taking my probiotics daily. We will try that when the time comes, even though it is expensive.
* I have fallen asleep on the couch almost exclusively. Should I just head back upstairs guaranteed?
** That might just be the best option here. Getting my sleep schedule down cold is perhaps the best option. I can sit there. I hate letting my mind wander, but it may just be the price I need to pay. I'm convinced of it.
*** Alright, To-Do-Listed, that shit.
* I am interested in MB's thoughts on the wiki.
* I like having the kids prep. It requires thinking about what needs to happen, but not having to do all the juggling and more dangerous work. They will get there, of course. I also don't want to run them ragged. We work hard on math.
* I am at my most productive when I'm not watching shows.
** I need to be more careful. I need to master this drug.
* It's interesting that Charlie never calls me. In fact, nobody ever calls me besides my brothers. That is a very a strong signal. People aren't interested enough in talking to me to take the initiative to call; they are other things they value more. 
** That makes me sad, but I don't think I'll be changing my behavior that much. I'll change my outlook on what kind of relationship we have. But, I still want to have a relationship, even if it is mostly one-sided. 
*** My brother JRE half-joked with me that I don't play "hard-to-get" enough with the people I care about. Hmmm. That requires more thought.
* I very much enjoyed spending time with my brothers in KY. It was wonderful!
** I love you very much.
