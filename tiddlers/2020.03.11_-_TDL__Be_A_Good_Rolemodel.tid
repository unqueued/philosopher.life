title: 2020.03.11 - TDL: Be A Good Rolemodel

* The Doc's Office
** HPV vaccine for him, finally. I'm confident they'll do it.
*** NO and JC refused us for both of our offspring, which is insane.
** Need to help him see with eyes open as much as possible here. 
** I'm grateful that he will finally have some medical stability. 
* Let's do stir fry.
* Bisect the Triangle
* Maybe shop, or we can plan.
* I'd like to see us back on schooling here.
** Tasty card treats must wait, even though we all want to talk about it and play.
*** `/sigh`, I don't want to be a good role model, lol.
