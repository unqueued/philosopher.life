Via Resilio Sync!

Hey  [[h0p3]], I lose your cell number and our signal conversations. I manage to drop my phone in the toilet yesterday morning. I have gotten a new phone and most contacts transferred over. Yours did not. Also attempting to sync up using the key on sync. If you could drop me your number that would be awesome. And ill continue to use signal to contact you
```

```
New phone, eh?

Old phone did not survive a dunk in the toilet. Lol

Hope it's a phone you enjoy though.

They had a good deal. We were also due for an upgrade. So I got two sweet new phones for $15 extra a month for 2 years.
SUN 1:27 PM
Cool.

Everyone got an upgrade.

And gave my wife old. Phone to my kiddo. Which was a big upgrade for her and added her to our plan instead of Trac phone.
SUN 1:28 PM
Yeah it worked out in the end. Unfortunately that wqs not on my agenda for the two days.
SUN 1:28 PM
And then I didn't know how to get ahold of you but post to the sync which is on my pc. So I guess the message got thru?

Made three of these for my father in law, and two brother in laws. That's also a waterproof. 50cal ammo can. Good for an emergency storage kit in a car or truck 9r divide up and use on whatever. Can't wait to give them to the guys.
