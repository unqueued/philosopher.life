I teared up talking to my wife today. I see a brilliant woman who has endured so much pain. She has something inside her, something she's been aching to get out for decades. She knows it. It's part of her meaning, purpose, and vocation. It's that Octavia Butler Humanity X factor thing. I want her to pour herself into a work. She is the most well-read person I've ever met. It's time for her to express it, for herself and for the rest of us.

I'm hoping the wiki will be a gateway for her as well.
