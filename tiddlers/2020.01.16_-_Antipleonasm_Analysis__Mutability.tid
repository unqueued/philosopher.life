title: 2020.01.16 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Mutability

: It is a bad plan that cannot be changed.

Bad for what, [[gfwiwcgws]]? There are many kinds of plans which cannot be changed, and yet they are not bad for their purposes (though they can be bad for other ends as secondary effects). There's often no other way; if the end is categorical, then the necessary aspects of the hypothetical means cannot be changed, and yet they are not bad with respect to that end. 

I'll agree that flexibility, agility, malleability, openness, vagueness, gunkiness, and mobility tend to be valuable properties in executive functioning. Foregoing the opportunity to change and commitment are not bad by definition though. Mutability is valuable in virtue of the immutable.
