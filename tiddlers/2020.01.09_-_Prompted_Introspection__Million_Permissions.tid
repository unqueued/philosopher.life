title: 2020.01.09 - Prompted Introspection: Million Permissions

!! I wish I had a million? Then I would?

No, no, no, no! Please, Lady Melisandre. Don't do this me. Not the wishing game. I wish I had a million pragmatic sets of answers to the wish questions, {[[dreams]]} which fit my context in both pragmatism and idealism [[irwartfrr]] such that I'm left with mere preference, arbitrary doodling in my choices, where [[The Right]] is no longer a hardship to find or apply (except insofar as it is conceptually necessary), and I can whimsically wish for whatever I want from my pile of permitted wishes.
