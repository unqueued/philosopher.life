title: 2018.09.14 -- Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

How does a comic book not actually draw out the golden mean? If they did, they could have very quickly walked us through the details and gotchas. I'm disappointed. There's a way in which you simply cannot appreciate what is correct about Virtue Theory without visualizing it. It's dialectical, contextualist, and particularizes. 

The romantic story of anti-codificationism of Neo-Aristotelians is nauseating. Hursthouse, brilliant though she may be, is a fool on this matter. Pure non-cognitivism is ultimately a vote for anti-realism.
