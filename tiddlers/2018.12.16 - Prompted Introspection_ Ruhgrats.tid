!! What do you regret and why?

I have something related to this, [[2018.10.12 - Prompted Introspection: Regrets]], but I've never answered this question in this log before (to my knowledge). Not everything is up to me, and I only have so much control and responsibility. These are moves I wish I could make differently:

* I regret trusting my donors and giving them radical charity/forgiveness so many times.
** In fact, I regret trusting so many people, including myself, [[irwrongfrr]].
* I regret not listening to the philosophers I've met more openly and charitably.
* I regret spending my life in meaningless simulations to some significant [[dok]].
* I regret not taking cryptocurrency seriously back when it first came out, rofl. When I mined back then, it was just stupid esoteric toy to me.
** I should take some of my toys and hunches more seriously (if only I knew which ones).
* I regret having children so young (though I am lucky to have the children I do).
* I regret not trying harder in life and taking myself more seriously.
* I regret not writing to myself from the beginning!
* I regret not becoming a computer wizard.
