** Excellent notes. Thank you for working hard.
*[[2020.03.23 - YTDL]]
** Yeah. I hear that.

** I'm not sure how you're connecting the disconnection between "admiration and familiarity" with the fear and belief of cults. 
*** You likely have a reasonable thought process here. I don't see it though.
** Your opening claim is more obviously strong though.

** Indeed, we need to get back into the pomodoro habit. Please enforce it with me. Make sure we are all applying the rule wisely.

** I would like to know how you think it should be divvied up.

** That problem you were speaking about in [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] is a really hard one. I think you did a fine job of saying it.
** We could go through the e-mail list and figure out who is who, btw. I think the other artist your age would be a great candidate for a friend.
** You still beat me in [[Magic]]. Lol.
*** I'm hoping you consider joining me in digital play with EDH decks.
**** There's plenty of construction to practice too.
** I'm surprised you think you have too many. Why do you think that?
*** It seems to be an unending problem for anyone, from what I can see.
** Maybe we will re-read it then. I would be excited to see your take on the world Asimov has built. If you pushed the pace, you could do a book every day. Take it at whatever pace is worthwhile though.
** Having worthy error messages to point you in the right direction is not a simple problem. 
*** Some languages are just practically easier to write in because they handle it better.

** What part of git are you worried about here?
*** Yeah, please do.
** I'd like to have seen more specifics about your school work in here.
