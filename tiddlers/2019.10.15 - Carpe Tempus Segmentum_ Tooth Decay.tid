** Kids were extra curious since I've not been since before they were born.
** Decades later...4 cavities they couldn't find except by x-ray. Cool.
** They tried to sell me $26 toothpaste and talked me like I'm an idiot. It is true.
** They were stunned and said I'm ridiculously lucky. What was supposed to take multiple sessions didn't. Noice.
** Dental Assistant knew a surprising amount about my offspring and peppered me with questions about homeschooling, but that was only after she realized my teeth weren't disgusting.
