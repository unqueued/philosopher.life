title: 2019.08.20 - Prompted Introspection: Worst Parenting, Ever

!! What is the worst thing parents can do to their children?

I don't know. Wandering toward the extremes of [[The Good]] and its opposite is this neverending problem. Every time I posit a limit, I posit something beyond it. We live in a finite space, however, and so there is some set of answers which are in fact "the worst" in any given context for we [[fff]]. I am not convinced anyone could calculate such a thing in polynomial time or without resources far beyond what obtains in our physical universe, but I simply don't know enough (and can't) about the nature of the metaphysical properties of our transworld identities which enable freewill to say either way. My [[faith]] feels like overextension, and all I'm left with is ignorance.
