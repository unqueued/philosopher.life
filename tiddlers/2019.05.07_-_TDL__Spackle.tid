* We have company on Monday. 
* Spackle
* Phone has not been charging, make sure to kill the splitter.
* I've noticed tids are missing elsewhere. Ugh. I can't see what they have in common. I've seen people abandoning Bob, but multiple windows is still worth the loss.
* [[Hymns of h0p3]] reverted. What in the hell?
* Be your milk machine.
