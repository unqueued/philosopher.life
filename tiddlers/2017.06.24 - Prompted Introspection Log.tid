!! Three celebrity crushes...

All the tough questions and prompts for me today. This one is tough only because it is hard to narrow down. My wife has agreed to threesomes with any of these females should the occasion arise.

Do you mean something besides fuckability for a crush? Is it the appearance of who they are, who I really take them to be? I think they are terrible human beings. Fuck? Yes. Crush? No. Back to what matters here, the drug itself.

# //Carice van Houten// as Lady Melisandre of Asshai, The Red Woman, from Game of Thrones is a perfect 10. But, Carice van Houten isn't as hot in other roles. Carice generally isn't a perfect 10. It's the atmosphere, the makeup, the context, and the way The Red Woman carries herself that makes me so horny. 

# //Salma Hayek//. God damn! I have spilled a lot of seed to this woman. I think she is a terrible actress, and her characters are generally annoying and not believable. That's part of her schtick I guess. Regardless, she's insanely hot.

# //Lucy Liu//. She's a stunner. Oddly, I often love her characters/roles, and I don't mind her acting (not that it is good, but it works for me). She gives me the yellow fever.
