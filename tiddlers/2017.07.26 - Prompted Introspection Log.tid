!! Why should your son participate in the Boy Scouts of 'Murica?

* It is obvious to me that my son needs other male role models besides myself. There will be crucial times where he is not going to hear me, I fear. This is, of course, in no small part my fault. Other male role models and guides will possibly be incredibly useful to him.
* The friendships and experiences would be important markers, memories, and hopefully fill him with some confidence.
* He needs more social interaction.
* I think he would love the content of Boy Scouts. 
** Seriously. This is the best reason.
** My son has traditionally masculine practices he enjoys, often enough.
* It would be "just his," which may motivate him and feel like he is special. 

A couple problems. We'd need to find an active one. I'm not sure how much we can participate. This may not be possible until we have a car, and even then, I fear my wife would bear the largest burden here.
