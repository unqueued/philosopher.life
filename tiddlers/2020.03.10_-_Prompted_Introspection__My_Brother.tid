title: 2020.03.10 - Prompted Introspection: My Brother

!! Who is the one relative that I miss the most? What would I say to them if I could see them again?

I've decided to join these questions rather than keep them separate: [[2018.05.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: Missed Relative]] & [[2018.05.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: Say To Missed Relative]]. I have been able to grow my relationship with [[Charlie]], but not at the rate I would prefer. It's a fine pace given who he is and where we are though, and I count myself lucky to know him (few do). 

For most of 2019, no one in my family had any major contact with my brother [[AIR]]. He wasn't reachable. It was painful, scary, and sad. I've tried many, many times to contact him. Yesterday, it worked. The first thing I told him was: "I love you." If those were the only words he got to hear from me, that's what I'd wanted him to know. I'm grateful, relieved, and happy to be able to speak with him late into the night. It's like he surfaced from deep and chaotic waters, and we get to be together again. I'm lucky to know my brother (both of them). Sometimes, they are the only people in the world who have the experience necessary to see what I'm pointing at with the fitting emotional force and clarity.
