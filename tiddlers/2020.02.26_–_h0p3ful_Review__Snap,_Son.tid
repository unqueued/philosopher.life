*[[Notage Ti.1]]
** Oh snap. Wat. There are notes here.
** Interesting naming convention.
** I like how these are little breakpoints to back us up in the rabbitholing of our dialectures. You've got landmarks here! 
*** I'm exceptionally grateful that you would be so diligent in this.
** It's a difficult task: how do you write down what is most important about the external conversation(s) around you and the internal conversation(s) you're having simultaneously and real-time?
*** Simply an absurd task. But, it is wise to master it as best you can.
** I think just having notes that you aren't even worried about immediately digesting and drafting into something else (which is a crucial step for reconstruction), is a damned good use of your time. You don't know which thoughts are going to matter well enough. Just spit it out, and learn [[W5H]] to sort through it.
*** Even base impressions are worth writing down. 
**** There is a virtue-theoretic training to be done in the practice of more consistently writing down base impressions which are increasingly accurate in prediction or meeting the requirements of some model with more accuracy. It's highly empirical.

** Son, you know how to pick'em. Keep it up. 
*** This topic is huge. HUGE. HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE. You are a straight-up beast for even trying to tackle it.
** I would italicize the title: //Twilight of the Idols//.
** You should say: "I disagree," and you need to tell me what things are being defined. 
** "I don't know his" what? Definition(s)? You can make this clearer for us. It's not that what you've said is logically inconsistent, and there is a terseness here which is perfectly reasonable in plenty of contexts (it is more likely to sound better out of the mouth than reading off the page). The issue is about making it flow as naturally as possible for a larger context of people who might find that terseness offputting.
*** I'm not claiming you owe this to people at all times, but I am saying you have to codeswitch beautifully at times. It will be obligated in some cases, and it will simply be exceptionally useful and even [[ltf]] for you in other cases. You need to be able to turn it on when the time comes. It requires practice.
** I don't know how to pick it out for you well enough, but sometimes you say it perfectly, plainly, drop dead gorgeously, and it's a semi-informal tone to boot. So hard to achieve. Find that voice; you must train it.
*** I'm lost here, btw. I can't do it myself well enough either. I just want you to realize that sometimes your communication ability can be excellent, and it's worth realizing that practice has and will likely continue to help you in so many areas of your life. You work hard on this already, and you shouldn't stop. It has exponential gains for you; it's a survival force-multiplier for someone who is wired like you. I don't know it's painful. I'm sorry.
** "we dont' need language to live"
*** I do not know if you understand what your words mean far enough here. It's such an astounding thing to proclaim. It cannot be true, surely. Are you confident in your belief here, and why? 
**** I am going to continue arguing to you that some kinds of consciousness, including what makes us Daseinic (not to mention that it's crucial for being fit for such a condition), requires language. 
***** You should study feral and radically neglected children.
***** And, it turns out that we have a lot of trouble defining what consists in a language. What isn't a language? Consider, for example, the way in which it is common place to say two trees are biologically communicating. Is that really the same kind (or value) of sign and semantic work? 
*** You have to argue for this claim. You don't get to just state it without evidence.
**** I realize, this is an [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] from a pre-teen. I'm trying to show you where you eventually must go, and why.
**** In general: the more controversial the claim for your audience, the more quantity or quality evidence you are required to present. 
** Whoa, back it up: "shelther is just a misconception," `/busts-out-hipster-pose`. Do tell.
*** I like that you make me work for it, but make it worth my while. You need to spell it out more here.
**** Why? Because most people's instincts will be that you are wrong here, and you should know that. It has to be taken into account when you decide how to enrich the conversation train in the right spots. This is hard to do, and we suck at it as autists.
** Okay, even though I disagree so profoundly with you, I love what you are talking about here. You aren't wasting time on bullshit. This is real work.
** Don't stop your work in [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]. Keep going. This is a dojo, son. Go forth, and kick ass.

*[[2020.02.25 – Carpe Diem: 9:45]]
** Yeah, her pancakes are delicious. <3
*[[2020.02.25 – TDL: Lecture]]
** That is not specific enough. Either write something specific or nothing (to be assumed then). This is [[.tmpl]] copy and pasting. In this case, you are obligated to flesh it out. Do you see why you are obligated? Do you see the reason for it? 
** Consider having some of your goals as abstractions. 
*** e.g. "I want to be X today because Y."
*[[2020.02.25 – Prompted Introspection: Trusting trust]]
** You've got a conversational tone here. This is a technical topic to be speaking about conversationally. If you develop it more rigorously, it may help you fill in some gaps.
** I adore the courage you have in taking the hard road here. This is a stupid hard problem. You went straight to the bottom. <3
*** What it means to doubt a "proof" (and doubting what it means to doubt, including build proofs which doubt proofs) has some [[infinigress]]es we can't answer. It will be important to remember that we are mortal, [[fff]]. Do not hold yourself to a standard which cannot be achieved too closely or literally.
** I think you are more than //merely// confident that you exist. I think you are certain of it. Your [[phenomenology]] demonstrates that immediately to you. This is the primary thrust of Descartes' "cogito ergo sum." 
*** I say this, but I know there are people who spend their lives doubting right here too. I want you to see that it's okay to have a feeling of certainty in very particular corners. We will attempt to grow our axioms, even as we sometimes turn around to question and doubt them deeply.
** Make it grammatically correct. You gotta put the lipstick and rouge on it. Doll it up! Make it palatable, sexy, and attempt to limit the stumbling blocks for your readers.
*** Do you see the grammar errors?
*[[2020.02.25 – h0p3ful Review: Let's Rock]]
** This was much longer than I had meant to make it. I'm glad about that. I'm going to try to keep it shorter.
*** In part, we jumped into just reading our papers together because of it.
**** Speaking of which, when we go to draft, please take into account the feedback I've given you. 
*[[2020.02.25 – Wiki Review: "Referencing" is a silly word.]]
** Why is "referencing" a silly word? 
*** (I agree there are some silly things which arise from thinking about references.)
** Edited. We're renaming because I'm lazy.
** There are grammar errors in here. I understand we need a space to just write gibberish down, but you have to practice doing it cleanly too. 
*** If you don't know you can do it correctly when called upon to do so, then you should probably continue practicing correctly.
** It's very expensive to engage your [[Yearly Cross-section]]. I'm not even asking you to do what you are doing here. It's great, but know that I have higher priorities than this work. Feel free to do this work, but not at the expense of what I take to be valuable in our process here.
*** That said, I'm grateful that you are taking a hard look at what you've done. Comparing ourselves to ourselves is a mighty task. I appreciate that you aim to hold yourself accountable in here. 
** We're all crap students in some respects. Here's what you should do instead:
*** Talk about my [[h0p3ful Review]] in your [[Wiki Review]]. You should have more to say than "Yeah, I suck." If you really think that's the case, and you really want to do something about it, then it's time to address what I've said to you (which is hardly the claim I can teach you how to be an amazing student).
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Your grammar and spelling have improved. Continue to use your writing tools, please.
*** Learn why you got it wrong, and apply it. 
** You can get syntax highlighting for your code in your wiki.  Might be worth your time, and it improves readability significantly.
*** I know some people even write their code in their wikis, but I'm not convinced this is the best tool for that.
** I'd like to find a happy medium between formal writing and you expressing yourself however you see fit. Until you can write formally in a consistent fashion, I'm afraid we have to put your own expression preferences on the backburner. 
*** Your mother's prose is fantastic. You and I probably can't achieve it regardless of our efforts, but I want you to see an ideal. We have to figure out how to connect the pieces together in our conversation trains in a way that everyone can easily digest (what an impossible task!).
** Your formatting has improved over the years.
