title: 2019.09.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Simple Saturday

* Woke at 10
* Offspring on task
* Repairmen came. It took quite a while, but we now have something like a working AC. It's still not great though.
* WoW with bro.
* Reading
* Walk with wife
** Literary analysis. I sit and listen. =) It's so out of my league, lol. But, I'm lucky to be able to think about it with her.
** Philosophy, Religion, and Politics, as always.
** My wife is basically getting a mini-vacation for her interview in her opinion. Hipster hotel, geeking out with librarians at a Divinity school, good food, and traveling to see one of the better libraries in the world. 
*** She's been looking at the perks of this job. Jesus Christ. The wealthy live in a different world. Even Tulane didn't have it this good.
*** Even if the other person gets the job, this is still an awesome use of her time. =)
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* WoW
* Quinoa with some meat and onions, zucchini, squash, pineapple, and fruits. Beer too. =)
* WoW
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
