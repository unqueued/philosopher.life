title: 2019.09.24 - Afterschool Teaching: Kickin' It In Heaven

Prep was much easier since I only did half. Whitney shows up late, but she takes it to be her responsibility atm. I'm still going to be fallback though when it comes to feeding my children (but the paperwork is irrelevant to me). 

Whitney discussed how much she hates her economics class. She's never heard of Marxism, and she wasn't interested in hearing about it either.

Our numbers were cut more than half today. Lots of football games, cheering, cross-country, etc. Whitney only had 4 children today (almost all the absences were the older children). I handed her 6th.

The library was off limits today! Shit reason too, I saw no one in there all day. It is annoying how my program is the absolute lowest on the totem pole. Yeah, I've had another teacher say they are praying for me (jokingly signed the cross, and so on). Many of my students are the ones who get in trouble a lot. Mostly the poor, ofc.

7C and I talked about why he was there. He's obviously middle class. It's of his own volition. He commented again that I've stopped asking him if he has homework; I know he doesn't, and if there were a reason he didn't, I think I would figure it out through our discussions.

Like any decent children, I get asked random questions about everything all the time. I can't remember everything I field. From a question about what I'd do with $100 trillion dollars (yes, I would buy you a computer, kiddo), 5DB and 5DB2 talked with me about inflation and buying power (shit got all formal, yo). 5AN and I talked about the beauty of mathematics, what counts as knowledge and [[salience]], and the evolution of color perception in homo sapiens. 5AO and I talked about throwing people to the lions and human motivation (long conversation). 5HM and I talked about her plans for getting a scholarship to college and basketball. Shockingly to me, 5TB, 5AB, and I talked about whether or not people in prison deserved to be there (off a question about whether or not they were going to heaven); one has been drowned in his fundie religion and the other woke from personal experience.

I was asked by more than one student if I would be taking them to heaven today, and we did head to the lab! =) It was delightful.

Yeah, sometimes it kills me to see the trash they care about, but sometimes they find [[gems]]. I have no room to talk. The amount of garbage I've consumed is legion. Virtue of the practice takes time. I hope it becomes second nature to them, and I need them to [[ltf]] to rabbitholing. My offspring also consume tremendous amounts; it's absurd. You have to run on that hedonic treadmill enough to start isolating what actually matters, oscillating between addictions, and so on. I continue to intervene with critical reasoning where I can.

I'm mean, smiling as I deliver the bad news. Maybe 75% of the time when I'm asked a simple question about computers, I make them figure it out, search for an answer, etc. Many times they give up on the spot (though sometimes I force the issue). I tell them I do the same with my own chillun, but they are all my children and so I do it with all of them (of course, my offspring face much higher pressure from me).

5DB2 told me we like all the same things. I do like the things he likes. Trailerpark trash geeks unite; one of us.

[[gh057]] and I got to chat briefly twice. We're on like Donkeykong. Also, he's setting up syncs on multiple devices (noice). Maybe we'll softmod his chromebook here. He wants a wiki too. Let's do it.
