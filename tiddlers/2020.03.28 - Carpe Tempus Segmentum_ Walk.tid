** I'm still hoping for gold standard writing examples for them.
* Talked with [[JRE]]

*** Talked about his strategy for wandering.

** He talked with Tobiah, but stopped himself from continuing. 
** Matthew is doing much better!
** He was feeling bad that he wasn't being a good dad, and Rebecca was calling him out on it.
* Taxes!
** Offspring handled the paperwork, I typed, and we talked a lot during the process. There's a lot to say.
** Will likely have to followup on injured spouse.

*** Pissed into the stream! =)
