** "Corn virus" =)
** We spend 9 hours together. You might want to have more to say than that, lol.
*[[2020/03/08 -- Wiki Log]]
** I think your explanation of drug abuse was valuable for interpreting my use. I'm glad you did it.

** Preach, yo. Killing me with the laptop, kid. 
*[[The Lightning Thief // Chapter Two]]
** I'm grateful that you are taking our drafting procedures seriously. This is solid work. I don't think I could write this.
*[[The Lightning Thief // Chapter One]]
** Oh, wow, this got fleshed out. It flows much better than mine. Keep going after your mother's style.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** You should have a section for cosmetics. Battle body went well. Hair and makeup will put you where all the other females are. You will be judged on how you look more than who you are (there will not be many people who could judge who you are in a reasonable timeframe either), and you know it. Do not handicap yourself in the world.
** I've been thinking about that Breakthroughs book. I kind of think that's what we are doing in [[vidya]]s for [[Mathing]]. What do you think?
*** One more push through symbolic logic into mathematical logic would do us some serious good.
** New art you revealed drives home the point for me that you should have a section of your wiki (which can be easily ripped out [test it!]) that acts as a gallery or portfolio (even if only for yourself). We continue to talk about it. Don't you want to see the evolution of your own work?
*** I'd probably have a complete one and make selections from it.
** One thing that stands out about your [[TDL]]s: only you can interpret them with reasonable accuracy.
