title: 2020.01.28 - TDL: Stay Off The Crack

* GL on your [[Wiki Review]]. =)
* Read+Write like the wind, please.
* Stay off the crack. You have no time for it.
* Beans, rice, squash
* You have crafting, cleaning, and correspondence. Get to it, muhfucka.
* Time for your offspring to start doing some computer work.
* You may need to get more meds.
* Shopping will be soon, but we should continue to burn what is fresh.
** I like how you are building up a pantry. 
** Feels urban, old, and so different to run out to get missing bits for the meal of the day. It's not costly. I'm so grateful to be in a city on this count.
