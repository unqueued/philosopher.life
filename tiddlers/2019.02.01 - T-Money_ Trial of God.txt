FRI 8:44 AM
Morning poop read. Kinda chilled me to the bone and made. Me feew warm again.
FRI 8:44 AM
I find myself angry with God. I am by no means alone. I find it difficult to accept the fucked up random shit that happens to good people and the fortune and good luck of bad people.
FRI 10:59 AM
How do you wrestle with this? You can link me to your wiki.
FRI 11:00 AM
I learned enough about after-school. I feel like I could be an after school tutor. Lol
FRI 11:00 AM
Life goes on... (learned this morning a family friend who is with child has discovered her child has some rare condition and a 50/50 chance to live.)
FRI 11:01 AM
Shit, that's terrible. That is painful to even imagine.
FRI 11:02 AM
The after tutor part? I know. I already dislike this Matt guy. Hahah
FRI 11:03 AM
Oh, no, your family friend.
FRI 11:03 AM
Matt's not my favorite person, lol.
FRI 11:03 AM
*attempts to redirect with humor.
FRI 11:03 AM
Oh, lol. I'm autistic.
FRI 11:04 AM
Lol, it's a good joke. =)
FRI 11:04 AM
The problem of evil is one of the reasons I don't believe God is a moral agent (or an anthropomorphized object at all to the extent I can help thinking of it). It is one of the primary forces behind me leaving Christianity.
FRI 11:05 AM
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_of_God
FRI 11:05 AM
I'm angry at the idea of God, but I don't think there's a God (unless [[The Good]] counts...that is basically the philosopher's god).
FRI 11:06 AM
I have no particular places to link you that give you a succinct answer. You can search my wiki and see the evolution of my thoughts on it. I cuss often at the idea of God.
FRI 11:07 AM
Or I did.
FRI 11:07 AM
Get me drunk enough, and I will.
FRI 11:07 AM
I know your kinda dumb that's why I put the * to indicate my intent.  And thank you for the link. I will examine it.
FRI 11:07 AM
Lol! =)
FRI 11:08 AM
Thank you. I legit need it all-too-often.
FRI 11:08 AM
The distractify article points to this issue too.
FRI 11:09 AM
Maybe everything does.
FRI 11:10 AM
I cannot tell you the meaning of suffering. I have a hunch that some of it is meaningless.
FRI 11:10 AM
I remeber getting so angry with you in college. Until I kinda figured out you struggle with social ques. You probabaly never noticed. But even back then. Before you knew, I socialized with you often expressing my tone with an explination. Or reiterating stuff with added info to keep us on the same page. I remeber we usually kept the conversation light hearted.
FRI 11:11 AM
Namely due to my inability or desire to understand some of the complex philosophical point of views that I was unfamiliar with. No time like the present. To learn though.
FRI 11:12 AM
I don't have a good enough memory to see it all. I can see parts of that though, no doubt. I can see we both worked to click. I appreciate that quite a bit. I think it was an exercise of [[The Golden Rule]]. I wish it weren't it so, but I think that is one of the reasons I look back and don't think too highly of the rest of the gang we hung out with.
FRI 11:13 AM
I think you have a highly emotional approach to existentialism. Some of your aphorisms bubble up from it, imho.
FRI 11:14 AM
(that isn't to say mine isn't emotional)
FRI 11:14 AM
It's clear you feel the pain of it.
FRI 11:15 AM
I always knew that.
FRI 11:15 AM
I'm like 99% emotion. 1% reason.
FRI 11:15 AM
Some think we are all slaves to our passions.
FRI 11:15 AM
That 1% is a fighter though. And is really good with money and big life decisions. I tend to let him make the big ones.
FRI 11:16 AM
Lol
FRI 11:16 AM
Thine Frontal Lobes
FRI 11:16 AM
I think Kierkegaard will be a valuable author for you to explore.
FRI 11:17 AM
He's a Christian existentialist, and I wrestle with him constantly. He is integrated into my lenses of the world. I have to tell that bastard to shut his face sometimes because he's too loud, but I couldn't live without him.
FRI 11:17 AM
I like how you wrote that. That little voice is the story of my life.
FRI 11:18 AM
Hence the desire for intoxication. Often shuts him up or slows him down.
FRI 11:19 AM
Preach.
FRI 11:19 AM
I still cry at fucking Disney movies.
FRI 11:19 AM
Me too, especially when I'm feeling stressed.
FRI 11:19 AM
Moana. Stone female leads overcoming insane obstacles. I make fun of my girls for tearing up. But I'm wiping my eyes. They have caught me. Lol. No I cannot hide. It.
FRI 11:20 AM
Yeah, I have been there many times. I try to cry openly in front of my children for them to know it is an important part of life, that there is normalcy and value to it, and that they aren't alone. I can't tell you how many times I weep while writing my wiki.
FRI 11:23 AM
Or listening to a particular song, reading a poem that strikes me hard, or seeing the end of a story that I wish would never end.
FRI 11:24 AM
I am thankful for my wife, and for having a little girl. she is very emotinal as well. much like me. but i know i would have been much harder on a boy about crying.
FRI 11:26 AM
i still see emotion as weekness. or at least society does. and i have to hide it. everyday.
FRI 11:27 AM
I can feel that pressure too.
FRI 11:27 AM
thankfully i am clever enough to redirect shitty people at work who try to piss you off with humor, wit, and big words that distract.
FRI 11:27 AM
Especially in the fairly traditionalist, conservative cultures we live in.
FRI 11:27 AM
I will be AFKish (you know I always respond eventually, so don't hesitate, please). Applying to https://www.eff.org/opportunities/jobs/privacy-and-surveillance-activist, and I need to re-read https://philosopher.life/#2014.11.10%20-%20Dissertation%3A%20Challenges%20in%20Quasi-Lockean%20Intellectual%20Property%20Theory as part my application. The kids will have a long-lecture today as we think about it.
FRI 11:33 AM
Indeed. The day in young. Here is to hoping to success with the job. I feel if I can get an interview. I can get the job normally.
FRI 11:48 AM
https://youtu.be/n8RQY_Y3ip8
FRI 11:04 PM
Cool. =)
FRI 11:07 PM
I was going to make a joke before I clicked on it, but now I can't after seeing it is a moving duo with your daughter.
FRI 11:10 PM
She should learn guitar too! =)
FRI 11:10 PM
I think She wil. She has one. Of course. I just put new strings on it the other day.
FRI 11:11 PM
We came home from Mexican, I printed off the lyrics. We practiced maybe 10min. Then she was like "let's make a video"
FRI 11:12 PM
That is fun.
FRI 11:12 PM
It's fun to play music with your kids.
FRI 11:12 PM
The videos for some reason she really enjoy making. And I like then to. She seems to stay more focused know she is on camera.
FRI 11:12 PM
I love it. We also rode the golf cart, shot our sling shots at Clay pigeons, and shot the bb gun after I picked her up from school.
FRI 11:14 PM
BTW. Exploding a clay piwgon with a sling shot, we use marbles as ammo, is an amazing feeling.
FRI 11:14 PM
Lol
FRI 11:15 PM
Never done with it a sling shot before. I loved my slingshots growing up.
FRI 11:15 PM
I got really got with a sling shot as a youngster. I am happy to pass that on to her.
FRI 11:15 PM
So we aren't throwing the clay targets. Just set them up on a wall (on of our barns) then stand back and aim.
FRI 11:16 PM
Still satisfying.
FRI 11:17 PM
Yeah don't mistake our sling shot at stationary targets up close for moving targets. Lol. We ain't that level.
FRI 11:17 PM
The shattering, you spend and destroy something.
FRI 11:17 PM
Indeed. A large box is $10 - 100 clays. And they are biodegradable. And marbles are... Sand...
FRI 11:18 PM
The sell. Large ball bearings as sling shit ammo. But it's expensive and dumb. You can get like 100 marbles for 50 cents or a dollar.
FRI 11:19 PM
plus, marbles are style...that's what belongs with a slingshot...that or rocks
FRI 11:19 PM
Rocks are fine too. But you have to be picky about the rocks you grab, and know they do weird shit depending on the shape.
FRI 11:20 PM
aye
FRI 11:20 PM
She wanted to go bow and arrow today, but that's just a hassle. She needs alot. More practice with them, as do I. I never got good with a bow.
FRI 11:21 PM
And you have to retrieve your arrows! I'm to fat and lazy for that. Lol
FRI 11:22 PM
We gotta lose it before are 40 or it will never happen.
FRI 11:23 PM
I really really want to. I don't like. Being over weight. High BP. Borderline diabetic. Fucking bad genes I tell you...
FRI 11:24 PM
I sware to God I was sweating profusely and out of breath playing ping pong after work the other day!
FRI 11:25 PM
Remeber whe. We use to all the time in Dana!? We were good. You always Won! Same with racquetball.
FRI 11:25 PM
I've never quite been able to get back in pingpong or racketball form again since college
FRI 11:25 PM
Hell. Nah. But. I threw the guys at work. For a loop. They didn't expect ole T-Money to be sitting on those. Ping pong skills. Lol. Surprised a few.
FRI 11:26 PM
lol!
FRI 11:27 PM
I think. ME and you played that table. More than anyone else!
FRI 11:27 PM
We also, for a while, had that foosball table from Blueridge.
FRI 11:28 PM
That's right.
FRI 11:28 PM
I need to see if they have pingpong tables down at Milligan.
FRI 11:30 PM
That would be a worthy use of my time with the kids.
FRI 11:30 PM
BTW. I still keep. Up with Matthew kilcoyn. I don't speak to. Any of the other gang... I'm friends with jumis on FB. But haven't spoke. In years. After you left I kinda distanced myself from them. Or rather they distanced themselves from. Me.
FRI 11:30 PM
Aye. You told me. I didn't know about Jumis.
FRI 11:30 PM
Matthew requested to speak with you, I said ?[[MWF]]? is In a weird place. I did not feel comfortable giving out your # without your permission.
FRI 11:31 PM
Also, Matthew is, excatly what you would suspect. Deepthroating Donald trump, blissfully ignorsmt. Living at home with his. Mom. And dad. Recovering from a severe back injury.
FRI 11:32 PM
He never made anything of himself. And has nearly given up. He inpregnated a woman In. College and they got married. Then divorced and she moved to California with his kid.
FRI 11:33 PM
He sees her on Christmas and a month during the summer.
FRI 11:33 PM
Jesus.
FRI 11:33 PM
She is like 10 I think.
FRI 11:34 PM
Back injury I knew about, but it sounds terrible.
FRI 11:34 PM
I'm fine to speak with him, but I'm pretty sure he will hate me far more than he would have years ago. I remember he told me he was pleased to have his child to counteract me bringing a child into the world. Lol.
FRI 11:34 PM
To be honest. He is silly old. Matt. Kind hearted but putting. On. His hard front.
FRI 11:35 PM
I was a socialist back then, but now I'm full on the everything he hates...except I'm not a black female, lol.
FRI 11:37 PM
Still, he has tended to be quite polite with me.
FRI 11:38 PM
I will. Shoot him. Your #. I turned him on to signal.
FRI 11:38 PM
If that's OK.
FRI 11:38 PM
You know what your getting into. And I gave you some additional. Insight.
FRI 11:39 PM
Yeah, that's fine. I'm here to play by [[The Golden Rule]]. =)
FRI 11:40 PM
I request you don't mention I said anything. About the kid thing... It's not my place to ask. But it's a fucked up situation that he has spent thousands of $ on trying to fight the system to get joint custody and get. More time. He is bitter about how the judicial system. And how it has treated him.
FRI 11:40 PM
He smokes weed now. So you may have that in common.
FRI 11:41 PM
Sweet.
FRI 11:41 PM
Perhaps we will have far more in common than I expect.
FRI 11:41 PM
err* predict
FRI 11:41 PM
Either way, I'll be happy to talk with him.
FRI 11:42 PM
Haha. And... He respects you. We all did back then. Your a God dam genius. How can you not appriciate that.
FRI 11:42 PM
https://lv.linkedin.com/in/jumis-lo%C4%8Dmelis-6ba66585
FRI 11:43 PM
Looks exactly the same.
FRI 11:43 PM
He was diagnosed with MS right before we graduated.
FRI 11:44 PM
He plays Latvian original. Music. (his family was big into that) works with kiddos in camps and what not. He posts pics and videos.
FRI 11:44 PM
He had a tough time accepting the diagnosis. He changed his whole what I'm gonna do. In. Life. It basically forced a very athletic and driven individual. Into a more heathly lifestyle and minimal physical activity in excess.
FRI 11:46 PM
That must have been hard.
FRI 11:47 PM
I think. I was the first person he told after he found out.
FRI 11:48 PM
Interesting to see his majors. It makes sense. He often struck me as somewhat dark-triadic.
FRI 11:48 PM
His music is beautiful. =)
FRI 11:49 PM
I can't listen to it. Lol
FRI 11:54 PM
Weird ass shit.
FRI 11:54 PM
lol
FRI 11:54 PM
He was a good guitar player. Back in the day.
FRI 11:54 PM
just spent the last hour catching up with jumis.
SAT 1:50 AM
and that is the reason, i love facebook. thought our distance and lack on conversation existed. rare glipses of photos and posts kept us connected. as well as the history of friendship.
SAT 1:51 AM
and just kinda picked up where we left off.
SAT 1:51 AM
just another old friend to catch up with on my quest to reconnect. stay connected and not let people fade in and out of my life that i give a shit about.  far too often i have allowed that to be the reality. and it ended up me not having any friends to talk to.
SAT 1:53 AM
alas, the bed is calling.
SAT 1:53 AM
Ha, that is awesome. =)
SAT 12:24 PM
