Reasoned truth isn't so important to Kierkegaard. I disagree on these truths being immaterial, but I agree they aren't the ultimate thing we must attend to. They are necessary, but not sufficient.

It's not clear Marx has an effective foundation for metaethics.

!! My Notes:

Decentralizing power is the best method of applying the reflective equilibrium, of taking into account all points of view as best as possible in the grand dialectic of The Great Human Conversation. We must distribute self-determination.

The author has a particular point of view on Marx, no doubt.

Sartre

Man is condemned to be free...

Being in itself vs. Being for itself

Existence takes priority over essence. Man has no such innate nature, and therefore we create ourselves, our own essences, natures, etc.

Man didnt' createhimself, but he is responsible for everything he does. We are "free" individuals, we are condemned. 

Where does this responsibility come from?

Live authentically.

How does he escape being a nihilist? How does he make objective meaning? He can't. If we create it, then it is subjective. 

I suggest self-determination is about unfreeing ourselves, and therefore it is about being ruled by the right principles, and escaping the subjective creation of meaning to being ruled by some external principle that we give ourselves to.

Each generation must ask and answer the philosophical questions for themselves. They must find the "ultimate" answer for themselves, but he suggests there is no ultimate answer of the ultimate answers. That cannot be the case.

None of these moves are surprising me. It fits the tune I'm fairly used to hearing about it. I'm actually tryign to say Essence takes priority over Existence in a sense. Priority of what though? To me, meaning is the fundamental unit. I'm willing to start down the epistemic path first.

Ending was blah, whatever. The book was excellent overall. Very pleased to have read it.
