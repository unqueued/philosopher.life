//Weeding a lot of articles today. Many don't deserve to be here.//

* Stunning!
** https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/06/how-to-make-everyone-in-your-vicinity-secretly-fear-and-despise-you
*** A fascinating experiment (even if done very poorly). It has a lot to do with my life and wiki, imho. Also, it sounds like front-lobes are in the driver's seat without an understanding of our reliance upon emotional virtue-theoretic reasoning. Cultivation is complex.

*** Added to my stack
*** New PPP post!

*** One step further! To the degree something can be further decentralized without lowering utility, it is a monopolized (power is centralized). You were very close!
** https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-man-who-created-the-world-wide-web-has-some-regrets
*** You are tentatively forgiven, sir. We will hardware mesh, or we will perish. It is literally the only option. We have to automate "peering" cooperation like the big ISP boys do with the right "trust-building" protocol. Hello, [[Outopos]]!

*** Duuuuuuhhhh.
** http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Action.html
*** TLDR :P

* Disconfirm My Bias
** http://www.friesian.com/donner.htm
*** I feel like I might not be called a mystic on most of this, but I'm pretty convinced I am. I think mysticism is the logical consequence of metalogic.
** http://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/ex-smokers-crave-lost-identity-study-shows
*** That was not what I expected!

* Think About It
** http://www.bayesianinvestor.com/blog/index.php/2018/06/07/the-life-you-can-save/
*** People who are openly utilitarian without reserve are not to be trusted in metaethics. They have missed a qualitative piece of the puzzle which the Kantians and Virtue Theorists point out.
*** This person wants to talk about Hohfeldian analysis. 
*** Singer is generally on my shitlist too. This person really doesn't have an interest in being moral in the end, which really does have high costs. They are searching for anything to justify their take on egoism.
** https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/single-payer-or-bust-two-souls-universal-healthcare
*** Admittedly, this seems like it's not an insanely difficult problem to solve. This should be centrally planned in crucial ways. As usual, generating the right incentives models aren't going to be easy. Of the many crises we face, this seems like the easy pitch to knock out of the park. Perhaps I'm radically wrong; I realize how immense the hyperobject is (and simplification is key).
** https://www.city-journal.org/html/return-notman-15975.html
*** Sounds like Object Oriented Ontology (OOO)
** https://qbi.uq.edu.au/article/2018/06/new-schizophrenia-research-deepens-understanding-emotion-perception
** http://andrewmbailey.com/ap/Against_Materialism.pdf
*** This is a shit argument. I'm sorry, Plantinga. I adore your work otherwise. Aristotle has given the Bayesian externalist materialist the best reasons possible, and frankly so did Plato. The PoSR kind of reasoning is where it's all at. You must admit a the necessity of meaning outside of what you can conceivably conceive (hello, Gödel)...which means that materialism is definitionally insufficient.
** http://mally.stanford.edu/Papers/reflections.pdf
*** The unification theory in their conclusion is fascinating. To me, it is a form of contextualism.
** https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/moral-philosophy-and-its-discontents/
*** Look, the telos which gives us the calculus must be outside of mathematics itself because mathematics can't even describe it fully or provably by definition. Utility will always be Kant's bitch, folks. The qualitative will always be primitive to the quantitative in at least some contexts. We can only attempt to tell the incoherent story of the quantitatively impossible.
*** It's pretty hard to take this Naturalist Fallacy seriously. It's slapping us in the face in the last two paragraphs.
** https://philosophynow.org/issues/46/Newtons_Flaming_Laser_Sword
*** Umm...You've begged the question though; you aren't able to use Newton's Flaming Laser Sword to defend itself with itself. Gödel and Wittgenstein have shown you why science is fundamentally not the root of epistemological justification (as have countless other philosophers). This reminds me of that classic XKCD "subject purity," wherein I still think philosophers have completely outclassed you all still (even when you engage in just enough philosophical tradition to make yourself feel better about the foundations of what you are doing).

* Fishy
** https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-treasuredata/2018/06/20/the-rise-of-the-customer-data-platform-and-what-it-means-to-businesses/#19519c7353a1
*** I hope you get a kick out of being in the "Fishy" category. Sounds like reactionary work without an argument besides pointing (not enough at this level?).
** https://quillette.com/2018/07/02/political-moderates-are-lying/
*** Something stunning about this. There is a lot of good work in here. Problematically, they beg the question of being moderate, as if that is the only the correct answer, like they aren't responsible for turning to extremes, like somehow this isn't actually the correct process given the context. They've turned an "is" into an "ought" in a way. More importantly, it doesn't hold people responsible for lying. It's important to see people really are evil on their argument.
*** Love The Abilene Paradox.
*** It annoys me that they really aren't open to the possibility that the truth is extreme. 
*** This was a very well-written realpolitik piece, the rhetorical gloves hides reactionary fist just enough.
** https://np.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/8vtlwm/companies_use_job_openings_as_a_tax/
*** Yup!
** https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-07-03/dnc-chair-tom-perez-declares-socialist-ocasio-cortez-future-our-party
*** Trash use of a good argument. Unfortunate what they walk away with. More importantly, I do not believe Perez means this in the slightest. Most Leftists I've seen are quite suspicious.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/upshot/americans-are-having-fewer-babies-they-told-us-why.html
*** Still not socialism pursuit, eh?

* For my daughter:

*** Very powerful! You need to look into this. You need to use tools to empower your use of tools, and radically at that.
