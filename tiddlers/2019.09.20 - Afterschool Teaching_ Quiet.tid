title: 2019.09.20 - Afterschool Teaching: Quiet

Whitney was late. We were talking about our workload, and I asked her if she would do the paperwork if I was going to handle all the food prep solo. She gave me the deer in headlights look, but then after 10 minutes of trying to find a way not to reckon with fair distributions, she agreed that she should probably do her end of the foodwork. Cool. I can do that.

I smashed through more paperwork that should be input directly into a machine and calculated there. Software eats the world slowly, violently among the illiterate (and, I have no room to talk).

Madame Bacon had an extra assignment for 6KA. She's so dramatic. I enjoy filling in the gaps of the conversation train with her.

I almost completed my one-on-ones, but both Whitney wanted to leave early and then Delp forced us to leave before the usual mark. Fascinating. I am certainly annoying in my insistence on speaking with each child. Hey, I'll go with the flow. I finished over the course of the day. I wonder how long it will take before they realize they don't want my kind having serious discussions with the youth. I'm a bad influence.

Delp dropped in to gussy us up. Sonya stopped by. Only I was evaluated. This, of course, is a good sign. :P

We talked about philosophy, why I was there, and we talked about the nature of questions. The kids are enjoying being meta about our conversation. They led me today. We had up to 8 students gathering together to speak, but 2-3 was the average. They would come and go. Behavior was solid enough today. Not a lot of games, but there were lots of discussions, drawing, and reading.

5AN is exceptionally attentive to how I'm feeling. That is curious. 

Whitney eventually sent all her children to me and played in the office. 

We hit the lab eventually after cleaning up. It was probably too quiet in the lab. That's okay. I'll take it. I walked and thought to myself. I started up conversations when I could.
