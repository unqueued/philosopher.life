title: 2013.02.06 - Kant: The Categorical Imperative

 The CI “holds as an apodictically practical principle.”1 Why should this be the case? Apodicticity is an extraordinary epistemic standard. Kant knew this. For something to be apodictic, it must be indubitable, plain, obvious, and it must jump out at you, screaming its necessity. Yes, the apodictic really must shine forth like a jewel. The CI doesn’t clearly jump out or shine; the CI is doubted all the time by most folks. Clearly, Kant knows this. What then, does it mean to be apodoctic in this sense? I know he’s pushing for necessity and absoluteness. Fine. But, is he begging the question here by implanting the apodicticity of the CI within the very definition of rationality? Maybe.

On a different topic, a maxim is our subjective principle (rather than a law, which is universal), but I don’t know what that really entails at the end of the day. What is the structure of a maxim? I always thought it was something like this: [act, principle, purpose]. I’m not sure. One would hope that we could walk away with an obvious and clear understanding of how to decide what we are obligated and permitted to do. One would hope the very process of testing a maxim in the CI should be crystal clear, and the contradictions which apparently arise should be obvious, particularly if we are going to call them apodictic. It really isn’t so clear to me. For example, the kinds of contradictions (particularly in conception or will) worry me. A contradiction is a very significant claim. One should be able to demonstrate it in explicitly logic, else we should be very slow to say it is a contradiction. I don’t see it in Kant’s various examples.

Groundwork Section II (pp. 4:412-424)


…see previous notes through 4:414


4:415, The CI “holds as an apodictically practical principle.” Why should this be the case? Apodicticity is an extraordinary epistemic standard. For something to be apodictic, it must be indubitable, plain, obvious, and it must jump out at you. It really must shine forth like a jewel amongst the other propositions of the world. The CI is doubted all the time by most folks. Clearly, Kant knows this. What then, does it mean to be apodoctic in this sense? I know he’s pushing for necessity and absoluteness. Fine. But, is he begging the question here by implanting the apodicticity of the CI within the very definition of rationality? I think so.


4:415, All rational creatures seek happiness as an end.


4:416, Prudence is a skill, a means to one’s well-being.


4:420, The CI is the only practical all, all other imperatives are merely principle of the will (instead of laws), as they rest upon contingent truths.


4:421, “act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law”


4:422, an example application of the CI, the maxim/principle of self-love…


What is the structure of a maxim? I always thought it was like this:


{Act, principle, end,....all the other consideration} = Maxim, our subjective principle

[act, principle, purpose]

[means, end]


[kill himself, self-love, ….?]


The Maxim contradicts itself, and thus fails to pass the CI test. It is not so clear to me how it contradicts itself. Show me the contradiction – this should border on apodicticity, right?


Example of the Borrower, another contradiction arises. I don’t see it. A contradiction is a very significant claim. One should be able to demonstrate it in logic, explicitly, else we should be very slow to say it is a contradiction. This is important enough that it DOES need to be translated into propositional logic.

Example of the naturally talented man


That these “contradictions” exist really might just be “embedding” moral norms into the very concept of rationality itself.





Critique of Practical Reason (pp. 5:19-33)


5:19, maxims are subjective principles, only hold for an individual’s will, but are not laws, as laws are universal and hold for the will of all rational people


Which maxims can be universalized seems arbitrary to me.


5:20, describes the CI as objective. Why should I think it is objective?




Scanlon: How I am not a Kantian.


Scanlan answers to my about the nature of contradiction, pg 118. Problems though: what if I particularize the circumstance in the maxim? So, don’t lie, except in these very particular situations…It seems like we could avoid these contradictions on such particular maxims.


Show me why lying is always impermissible. My intuition is that it is irrational to agree to such a proposition.


Contradictions in conception, will.



Why should I think all people who are generally considered rational would agree to employ the CI, are capable of employing the CI, and would arrive at the same conclusions after employing the CI?
