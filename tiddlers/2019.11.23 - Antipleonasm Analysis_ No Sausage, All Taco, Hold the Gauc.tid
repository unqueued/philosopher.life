Yeah, no, like, that'll be a big very mega Oof from me, dawg. I like specializing when I know it's worthwhile. I'm hoping that eventually I'll move from generalist to specialist in life more effectively. Even in my own discipline, I'm all over the place.

Lame counterargument time: capitalism rewards specialization, but society needs generalists. You need cross-disciplines, librarians, translators, hybridizers, de-couplers, architects, pansexuals, bridge-builders, wizards, mixed martial artists, people who read way too god damn much (I hat u and ur stupid, fgts), park rangers, mad scientists, etc. 

[[Project Ascension]] was gorgeous, like [[MTG]]. Low-risk, high-test environments for specializing are meaningful and fun. Hand me a smaller world, and I'm a specialist.
