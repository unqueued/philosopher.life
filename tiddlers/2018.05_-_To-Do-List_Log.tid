!! Audit:

* I'm super proud of having accomplished my monthly TDL goals. Good job!
* I had a weekly hiccup, but that's okay. A job tends to smooth out how my week works out. There's less freedom to do what I want, and I know I was productive.
* While I'm working, auditing is harder.
* My TDLs are very simple while I'm working. Perhaps they are simply simpler over time. I fear, of course, that this log has become less useful to me over time. I'm not sure. I'd like to know my wife's opinion.
* I do like that I talk about my books in this log.
* I actually have some humor in these. That's good. I'd like to continue that, while still remaining productive.
* Zlam was actually useful for my sore muscles. It made the day very chillaxed.
* It took me quite a while to work through [[Music: Library]], and it's interesting to see how this log now overlaps with so many other logs. It seems to touch on {[[Focus]]}, [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum Logs]], [[Wiki Review Log]], and [[Wiki Audit Log]]. I need to think about the executive function stack I'm building. What's right, and what's wrong about it? Are there redundancies I can remove? Are there ways to streamline it? How do I pipe them together more effectively? I have the primitive semblance of a tool. I'd like to fashion it better, if I can. At this, I don't know how or what to do though.
* The work days are truly simple.
* Oh, I never finished grafting my doctor notes!
* Somehow, I look at the month and wish I accomplished more than I did. Is that unfair to myself? I did work my buns off. I am only human.
* Walking with my wife took a huge nosedive. I'm so sore after work I just can't do it. Working was good for my body though. I swear I can feel the difference.
* Overall, TDLs keep getting shorter and shorter. I fear I suffer from the same problems my chillun do on this matter. I think I need to work harder in how I reason about this. Of course, there are limits to what I should expect of myself.
