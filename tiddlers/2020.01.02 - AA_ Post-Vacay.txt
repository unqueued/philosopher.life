Thank you!

Back to rest of reality, lol.
Jan 2 10:47am
Yeah
Jan 2 10:49am
I really enjoyed being with everyone
Jan 2 10:49am
It was wonderful.
Jan 2 10:49am
I tend toward introvertedness but being with family is definitely a source of rest, joy and strength
Jan 2 10:50am
Are you driving today?
Jan 2 10:50am
Aye, and it was super chill. Good food and company.
Jan 2 10:51am
Next time, it may be [[AG]] driving up the mountain! =)
Jan 2 10:51am
We just got on the road. Kinda been a clusterfuck in the past 24 hours, lol.
Jan 2 10:51am
Removed water connections to washer, and a pipe burst. Water damage everywhere (though we are told we aren't liable). No water to clean with (or use for living). So that went well, lol.
Jan 2 10:53am
Got everything packed today, and [[j3d1h]] let Meow go (while the cat was freaking out). Ran into the thornbushes, took at an hour to find her, and another hour to get ahold of her. Everyone is cut up. But, we are finally on the road.
Jan 2 10:53am
I'm grateful about the water damage occurring AFTER we had already packed away the computers that would have been destroyed by indoor rainstorm.
Jan 2 10:55am
That sounds awful
Jan 2 10:56am
I am really glad that your stuff was ok and that you found Meow
Jan 2 10:56am
Me too.
Jan 2 10:56am
Travel safely and enjoy the scenery
Jan 2 10:57am
Bound to be some problems, and hopefully it will be smoother.
Jan 2 10:57am
I get to go out and talk to social security and then Verizon
Jan 2 10:57am
Trying to work on Maryâ€™s stuff

Jan 2 10:58am
=(
Jan 2 10:58am
But I can handle it better now
Jan 2 10:58am
We need magic wands for these things.
Jan 2 10:58am
Definitely! RL magic quest!
Jan 2 10:58am
I bet our family could come up with an awesome Magicquest of our own ðŸ˜Š
Jan 2 10:59am
Yes. [[1uxb0x]] and I were planning it already.
Jan 2 10:59am
Very nice!
