!! Audit: 

* My family is a drug. It is clear. I am dependent upon them in various ways.
* I am consistently obsessed with understanding my freedom within the drug-based framework. 
* There were fewer happier h0p3's logs this time, but there were fewer logs in any case, period. I feel like my other logs do quite a bit of my thinking for me. Is this a good thing?
** It has gotten to the point that I almost don't want to a monthly audit, except that I should audit this.
