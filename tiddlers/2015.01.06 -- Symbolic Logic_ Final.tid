Fill in the blanks. Write neatly and make it fit.	(each worth 2% of total)

    FOL translation of “Max is not home unless Claire is at the library”_________________________________________

    FOL translation of “not P is necessary and sufficient for both Q and R” ______________________________________

    English translation of ¬Cube(a) ↔ Small(b) ___________________________________________________________

    English translation of P → [Q ∨ (R → S)] ______________________________________________________________

    P → Q ⇔ ¬Q → _____ ⇔ _____ ∨ Q

    The claim “Joe’s great, he’s never drunk on Thursdays,” informally may indicate that Joe is drunk the rest of the time. In logic translation, this hidden suggestion is referred to as __________________________________________

    While semantically they are different, variables are __________________________ identical to individual constants.

    An object o satisfies a mere wff P(x) iff _______________________________________________________________

    ¬∃x S(x) is true iff _____________________________________________________________________satisfies S(x).

    FOL translation of “no P’s are not Q’s” _______________________________________________________________

    FOL translation of “only P’s are Q” __________________________________________________________________

    English translation of S ∧ ∀x [P(x) → Q(x)] ____________________________________________________________

    English translation of ∃x [Q(x) ∧ P(x)] ∨ ¬G ____________________________________________________________

    In a world with just cubes in it, ∀x [Tet(x) → Small(x)] is _____________________________________________ true.

    The TFF of ∀x [P(x) ∧ ∃y (Q(y) ∧ R(x, y))] → [∃z S(z) ∨ ¬∃y S(y)] ____________________________________________

    Two sentences of FOL are tautologically equivalent iff their ______________________________________________

    Example of a Tautology: ___________________________________________________________________________

    Ex. of a FO Truth which isn’t a Tautology: _____________________________________________________________

    Ex. of a Logical Truth which is neither FO Truth nor Tautology: ____________________________________________

    A pair of wffs with the same free variables are ________________________________ iff they are satisfied by the same objects in all possible circumstances.

    Show DeMorgan’s for Quantifiers: ¬∀x G(x) ⇔ __________________ and ∀x ¬G(x) ⇔ __________________

    ∀x [P(x) ∨ Q(x)] ⇔ ∀x P(x) ∨ ∀x Q(x) is true or false? __________

    English translation of ∃y ∀x Fears(x, y) _______________________________________________________________

    ∀x ∀y [Small(x) ∨ ¬Red(y)] ⇔ ¬∃z Red(z) ∨ ∀z Small(z) is true or false? __________

Neatly provide a FO Counterexample to the following argument (first translate into FOL) (worth 10% of total)



Fido is a dog

Every dog is shorter than Joe

Joe is taller than Fido



















Use scrap paper to figure out the proof, and neatly write your final answer here: (each worth 15% of total)	

|1. P ∨ (Q ∧ S) Show: S ↔ (R ∨ ¬R) |1. P ∨ (Q → R) Show: (S ∨ T) ↔ c = a

|2. D → ¬P |2. R → (S ∨ T)

|3. D ∨ S	|3. Q

|4. a = b

|5. b = c

|4. T ↔ P
