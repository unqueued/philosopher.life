[12:29 AM] chameleon: we play at FNM in nashville
[12:29 AM] chameleon: well, dickson
[12:29 AM] chameleon: and my boyfe plays using xmage
[12:31 AM] h0p3: Nifty, never seen that before.
[12:31 AM] h0p3: Automated rules enforcement of the official online was interesting to me.
[12:37 AM] chameleon: yeah wonder how it works
[12:41 AM] h0p3: In the eternal formats, there have been some card interactions and deck strategies which were logistically infeasible to play in an overly structured format. Magic offline (and looser digital stages) is filled with shortcuts, nods, and assumptions which some decks rely upon.
[12:43 AM] h0p3: Logistical problems suck for tournament play too. Sensei's Divining Top was a card that made too many turns last 5 minutes. Waiting an extra 15 minutes between rounds when time is called sucks. The Battle of Wits decks required going 5 color, tons of fetching, and thus tons of shuffling. That sucks (though, digital shuffling is a godsend).
[5:34 PM] chameleon: reading [[irwartfrr]] as iwartfart
[5:35 PM] chameleon: idk if the wiki is driving me crazy or if I'm driving the wiki crazy
[5:35 PM] h0p3: I need to start pronouncing it that way, lol!
[5:36 PM] h0p3: Crazy as it sounds, I actually say that word all the time in the house. Hard to spit out some things fast enough without my dumb abbreviations.
[5:37 PM] chameleon: I don't often use much netspeak irl... well, ok, I do say things like "tfw no gf" but I'll pronounce it in full. "that feel when no girlfriend", lol

[12:41 PM] h0p3: Madame chameleon, I have a dumb request. I need some unicode "brackets" for your name for my wiki. (I am happy to hunt for and with you). This is a trifle, but it makes me happy to have a symbol (or preferably a pair, like bookends [e.g. 【Kickscondor】, ⦗h0p3⦘, ᛝSphygmusᛝ]) which is yours on my wiki.
[2:17 PM] chameleon: hmmm, what about the tibetan brackets? lemme find them
[2:18 PM] chameleon: ༺chameleon༻
[2:18 PM] h0p3: I like those brackets!
[2:18 PM] chameleon: ༼chameleon༽
[2:19 PM] chameleon: both tibetan ones, I'm ok with either haha
[2:19 PM] h0p3: Oh, I like those too. Gonna take the second.
[2:23 PM] chameleon: http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_matching_brackets.html
[2:23 PM] chameleon: if you need more, there's a bunch here!
[2:25 PM] h0p3: Cool. Yes, I need that. Thank you.
