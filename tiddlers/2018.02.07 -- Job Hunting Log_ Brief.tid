title: 2018.02.07 -- Job Hunting Log: Brief

Lots of work on Craigslist. I setup an account, and I'm building searches. There are jobs to apply to, so I'm pleased to see that. I think I'll always keep looking. With an automated process setup, it's not painful to check.

I also ran my automated checks. Nothing new. Craigslist has a lot. I'll keep working it. I need to dive in tomorrow.
