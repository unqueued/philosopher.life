How are you spending your holiday (hopefully you don't have to work)?
DEC 24, 2018 4:48 PM
I don't have to work! Doing dinner and presents with the boyfriend's family tonight, and lunch tomorrow with more of them! In between, lots of TV (started the first season of mad men on Saturday) and knitting -- I started a scarf for my younger brother last January and now I'm last-minute trying to finish it :sweat_smile:
DEC 24, 2018 5:23 PM
That sounds awesome. =)
DEC 24, 2018 5:24 PM
Going to spend Wednesday cooking food for my family's get-together on Saturday, which should be the most enjoyable of all of them :)
DEC 24, 2018 5:24 PM
yeah it will be a good time I think! sounds like you've got fun things planned too!! :D
DEC 24, 2018 5:25 PM
Aye. I am excited to see my brother. It has been too long since I've seen him. Gonna rebuild computers with the kids too.
DEC 24, 2018 5:25 PM
Scarf-knitting and Mad Men should go together wonderfully.
DEC 24, 2018 5:26 PM
That show is important to me.
DEC 24, 2018 5:26 PM
I like having something to do with my hands while I watch (unless I'm falling asleep).

I didn't realize how much I missed some of my family while I was in Chicago until I was back home and spending more time with them. In some ways family members can empathize in ways other people can't (though it very much depends).
DEC 24, 2018 5:31 PM
Agreed! That is wonderful to have too. I bet it must be interesting for them having you come back from Chicago too.

My brother and i built my desktop together; it's a skill I'm glad to have some experience with :)
DEC 24, 2018 5:33 PM
They know your starting narratives. The initial investment in understanding you is there. It can be much easier for them to empathize with you than others (much lower cognitive load).
DEC 24, 2018 5:33 PM
Your brother like computers?
DEC 24, 2018 5:34 PM
Knitting is usually something I can't do with TV shows - some shows I don't want to look away from the screen - but mad men works very well as a knitting show. (I noticed your collection of don draper quotes.) I don't know what I think of the show yet.

I think you might like knitting! I made a lace shawl this spring and it's really like physical programming; I'd make a mistake and have to "debug" it - and of course patterns are basically algorithms for yarn. Very soothing for keeping hands busy.
DEC 24, 2018 5:36 PM
Knowing the starting narratives and having lived through them together does help I think. Though sometimes it's harder to talk about things because of that stronger emotional weight.
DEC 24, 2018 5:38 PM
My bro does like computers! We connected a lot around them and games in junior high/high school.
DEC 24, 2018 5:39 PM
Indeed, it can be much harder. There can be baggage, disagreement (differing memories). There can be a lot at stake when our narratives are intertwined. Our identities gunkily overlap.
DEC 24, 2018 5:40 PM
I am envious that your brother loves computers.
DEC 24, 2018 5:40 PM
JRE likes computers more, but primarily just for gaming, surfing, and pirating.
DEC 24, 2018 5:41 PM
They are kind to even use their computers with me.
DEC 24, 2018 5:41 PM
About 4 Christmases ago I did some knitting for a couple weeks.
DEC 24, 2018 5:41 PM
I'm not very good at it, but I enjoy some of the patterned repetitive aspects of it. It's soothing when it isn't infuriating. =)
DEC 24, 2018 5:42 PM
I made scarves for my extended family. SLT received a 250-yard yarn scarf, and I made fingerless gloves for wife.
DEC 24, 2018 5:44 PM
I still have the stuff to make a blanket in my room, but sometimes I just walk away from my projects. I don't know; the obsession just kinda of died on me.
DEC 24, 2018 5:44 PM
Mad Men is a show I have a lot of mixed feelings about. First few seasons are the best.
