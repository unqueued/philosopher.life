How's your weekend going?
MAY 5 12:56 PM
Good how are you
MAY 5 5:59 PM
Good. Family Time.
MAY 5 5:59 PM
Good —just getting up from nap roulette :blush:
MAY 5 6:00 PM
Reading through our wikis again. [[k0sh3k]] asked if you are feeling better. I don't know how long it takes to recover from the heart episode.
MAY 5 7:59 PM
I am doing pretty well. I talked to my cardiologist on Thursday and he referred me to a surgeon in Louisville for a cardio ablation
MAY 5 8:00 PM
Awesome. That is moving fast.
MAY 5 8:01 PM
Mostly recovery is sleep and I did that like a pro last weekend
MAY 5 8:01 PM
Lol.
MAY 5 8:01 PM
Well waiting for the Louisville dr to call for an appt ...where we can set a surgery date I hope —would like to get it done this summer if possible
MAY 5 8:02 PM
It’s like a week or two recovery bleh
MAY 5 8:03 PM
Aye. Very cool. You been reading more about it?
MAY 5 8:03 PM
Summer is a good time to recover.
MAY 5 8:03 PM
Hopefully won't interfere with class too much.
MAY 5 8:03 PM
Yeah —they map first -haven’t read up on how that works but the surgery goes up through the groin area (:cry:) to the heart
MAY 5 8:04 PM
Ugh.
MAY 5 8:04 PM
Yeah I am sure I can math without my groin and chest interfering
MAY 5 8:05 PM
It does not sound fun but not having random svt episodes when they are most inconvenient sounds nice
MAY 5 8:06 PM
Aye. Makes good sense to me.
MAY 5 8:07 PM
How’s [[k0sh3k]]’s head doing with the changing weather?
MAY 5 8:08 PM
Been killing her. Also the harder 2 weeks or so of the year at the end. Just need to make it one more week.
MAY 5 8:08 PM
CFS has been acting up too.
MAY 5 8:08 PM
Ugh poor [[k0sh3k]]
MAY 5 8:09 PM
I hope this week goes easier and quickly
