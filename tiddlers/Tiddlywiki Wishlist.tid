* Chat, messaging, posting, or any means of direct contact on the site itself. Very hard to integrate, from what I can tell.
* Updoots (although, I'm not convinced I have the heart for downvotes).
* Wordcounts

* I'd love to see the "backlinks" (?, that's what I'll call them) of each tiddler. What links to a tiddler? I want to know.
