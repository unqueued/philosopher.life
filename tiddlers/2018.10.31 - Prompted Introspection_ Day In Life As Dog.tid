title: 2018.10.31 - Prompted Introspection: Day In Life As Dog

!! Write a story about what 1 day in your life would be like if you were a dog.

I have responded to this before: [[2017.12.26 - Prompted Introspection Log: Doggy Day]]. 

On average, I would be a free-range dog in China. I have no idea if I'd be good eating. I wouldn't be myself, so I have no idea who I'd be. I think it would be a dog-eat-dog world for me though. Oh wait, I'm already there. Fuck.
