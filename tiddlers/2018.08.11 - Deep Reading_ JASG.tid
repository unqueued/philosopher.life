Prejudiced thoughts:

* I've read several books on Christ and culture.<<ref "c">> I've read books on apologetics. I've read many primary works on philosophy of religion, and I have several philosophy of religion classes under my belt (I've taught that class, too). 
* I fear Ravi is riding on Vitale's credentials. We'll compare the chapters. We'll see if that holds up, though.
* Hey, this wiki is filled with my prejudice. I'm accountable for it. Hold me to it.

Give me some context:

* [[Vince Vitale]]
* [[Ravi Zacharias]]
* [[JASG: Commentary]]

* Capitalizing On This Book
