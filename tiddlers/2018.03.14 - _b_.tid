Axiom: Nothing is free except randomness and meaninglessness. [There is a sufficient reason for everything, including, as a matter of faith, whatever skeptical exceptions you might levy against this. Randomness cannot be a physical attribute because physics, by definition, makes sense. It can appear pseudo-random, but true randomness is meaningless and cannot be physical. Being physical is a property of something, and you can't have an object with property that lacks meaning. Properties are meanings.]<<--Possible result. Meaning and being problematic.

Axiom: Habitually and radically question the nature of your reality. Be in control of the inputs to your mind to help maximize your autonomy (whatever kinds and versions you do possess). Truly engage in critical reasoning. Hyperread reality for relevance. Become an expert at refactoring your perceptions of the world. 

Axiom: Information wants to be free. Is this also a matter of entropy?

I need to know the meaning of being.

A bacterium or its cyborg counterpart may not have much of a mind, but it may have enough to qualify as an observer that stands outside the quantum realm.

Can you help me understand entropy as it relates to information theory, please? =)

ELI5, ELI12, ELI18 it for me, whatever you can do

I don't know if I should ask AA.

Also, they say "nothing is free." In physics, what are the best examples of something being free, or close-to-free, or crucially demonstrates the converse, that something wasn't free?

Maybe there are very different ways of talking about freedom in physics ("freedom from what?"), so perhaps there will be very different kinds of answers to give.
