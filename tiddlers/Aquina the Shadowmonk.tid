title: Aquina the Shadowmonk

//Like Santino Rice from Project Runway S2, I couldn't stop myself from endlessly embellishing.//

* Abilities
** Quad Flurry -- At-Will Type
*** I throw a strike, and if it lands, I instantly throw another strike, and so on, for a maximum of 4 strikes.
** Feign Death -- At-Will Type
*** I've studied death and its imitations. I appear to die and/or be dead. I'm quite practiced, and it tends to be fairly realistic looking. My eyes are wide open and vacant, mouth half-open, and maybe my tongue hangs out.<<ref "1">>
** Fade into Shadows -- Daily Type
*** I instantly teleport up to 10 feet in any direction while becoming completely invisible for 5 minutes.
** Divine Mend -- Conditional Type
*** Whenever I read or write, I have a chance to heal or cleanse myself.
** Lifetouch -- Innate Type
*** I heal myself and allies adjacent to me for a portion of all damage I deal to anything or anyone.

* Appearance
** I'm a 5' human female with exceptional breasts and an ass that just won't quit.
** I wear a "Dressed to the 9's" Gothic flowing dark hooded robe that covers every part of me except my fists and sandaled feet.
*** "I just hate my toes; they're so ugly, don't you think?....Like, I wish I had feet as beautiful as yours."
** I have cenobitic markings on my face, palms, and tastefully around my good parts. 
*** My "crazy" eyes and markings glimmer beneath my hooded robe.
** Skull-shaped wisps of dark smoke swirl around and emanate from my deadly life-giving fists.<<ref "2">>
** I look darkly monastic with a touch of schizophrenic demonic possession. 
** I like to meditate, read, write, and silently chant. I'm generally quiet. I'm a monk who deals in life and death.
*** Silent chanting: I noiselessly move my lips. Normally, with my hood up, people have difficulty seeing me chant. Those who can see it sometimes find it disturbing.

* Items
** Non-Magical<<ref "3">>
*** A dark leatherbound notebook
**** I love to draw "<3" emoji and write haikus. 
*** An extremely bright pink, girly pen
**** I sometimes perform a silent death-giggle when I use it.<<ref "4">>
*** A lodestone cut into a sphere<<ref "5">>
*** A square, absorbent, yellow, and porous bird-call whistle<<ref "6">>
*** Convex glass bound in an iron casing
** Magical
*** Golden Grill Rebreather -- Allows me to breathe in contexts I otherwise couldn't.<<ref "7">>
*** Time-Gate Glass Shard

* Weaknesses
** Double-Edged Lich -- Attackers are healed for a portion of the damage they deal to me.
** Epilepsy -- Recurrent, unprovoked seizures or unconsciousness. I can feel them coming on, but I only have a few seconds of consciousness before they hit me<<ref "8">> 
** Mute -- I can't talk, but I communicate through gestures, drawings, writing, etc.
