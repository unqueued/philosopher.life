 Been a bit stressful. Ended up giving a final written warnings to two dishwashers for no call no shows. They started to scream at me... I let them say what they wanted to say, and then proceeded to show all account of verbal warning and time stamps of not clocking in when they were to be here(1 hour to an hour and 20 Mins late). I then showed them how many times we have tried to help them find ways to work even showing them we have given money to you passed what you worked out of our on pockets.

 Besides that.  I went out with my roommate the other night to a pizza joint. And I am going to a pool party Tuesday

 It’s fucking hard.  I don’t know how I lost that part of my personality or maybe not lost it but it shriveled up and dried out, I feel like I’m reconstituting it back.

 That line goes into my wiki. I will need to think about that wording.
