I can see you've had to ask yourself what really matters this past year. You are crystallizing.

Good or better for the sake of what? You can be virtuous (excellent) at an immoral practice. The kind of virtue that matters requires picking out and acting on those principles and practices which are morally salient. There's a difference between only seeking to be good enough to be called [[good]] and seeking to be good. I get the feeling that you hide the fact that you are looking to just be good enough appearing rather than good enough. Oh, that is so arrogant to say. Them's fightin' words, right? I am being transparent with you. I am extremely consistent in my open, take-the-first-risk reciprocity with you.
