How has your weekend been? How's the writing going?
APR 28 6:21 PM
Busy as always. Hahaha. Our version of the Waterdeep campaign has been very enjoyable thus far. I think my take on it is making it strong and fun for my players. 

Hope your day is good. How was your weekend?

Sounds like you are building stories which matter with the group. Noice.

My weekend was good. Date, shopping, reading and writing, k-hole, and about 7 hours of family time.

That’s awesome! ^_^ I’m almost done with the semester. One more essay tomorrow.

I wrote almost 5 full pages in one go without stopping. Haha
TUE 12:49 PM
That is the best feeling.
TUE 12:49 PM
It was very messy.... and I didn’t even go back and read it. I know the information there is solid even if it’s a disaster of an essay.
TUE 12:50 PM
You are ready to be done.
TUE 12:50 PM
And now I am. :D
TUE 12:53 PM
I am so happy for you. I hope your summer is uplifting and productive.
TUE 12:54 PM
I can finally get back to my writing without falling behind or feeling guilty.
TUE 12:58 PM
Gonna be a different kind of grind. Reading and writing for 8-10 hours a day is grueling.
TUE 12:58 PM
Is that what your goal is this summer?
TUE 1:14 PM
That's what I already do, lol.
TUE 1:14 PM
Well, with homeschooling and lecturing*
TUE 1:15 PM
We sit and study all day.
TUE 1:15 PM
Oh I see what you mean now.
TUE 1:15 PM
My bad. Haha
TUE 1:15 PM
Little brain fried right now. XD
TUE 1:16 PM
I assumed you were going to be diving into this summer. Will you not?
TUE 1:16 PM
Diving into what?
TUE 1:16 PM
Reading and writing this summer.
TUE 1:17 PM
Yes! Hopefully going to get a lot of it done.
TUE 1:17 PM
Books don’t write themselves. Haha
TUE 1:25 PM
If only they did, lol.
