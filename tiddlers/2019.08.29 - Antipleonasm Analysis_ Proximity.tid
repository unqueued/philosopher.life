Some ridiculous percentage of jobs exist to protect the wealthy and their wealth. They've trained their psychopathy fairly well, but they also make sure to curate their experiences, the people they interact with, and the existential crises they face. Their bodies and narratives go untouched. Technologically empowered social barriers seal them off from us. The principal-agent problem is radical; accountability is outright prevented by design. It's already tough to pick out the top 9-10% in my area; the 1% is well hidden (generally, they don't live anywhere near the likes of me). I have no idea how to obtain justice.
