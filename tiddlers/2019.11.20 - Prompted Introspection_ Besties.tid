title: 2019.11.20 - Prompted Introspection: Besties

!! What makes your best friend your best friend?

~~Her titties.~~

A radical commitment to dialectically constructing ourselves together. She's taught me what [[love]] means again and again. I'm simply going to fail to codify how much our relationship means to me effectively enough. 10 of these wikis still wouldn't do it justice. We're existentialists, and everything is on the line together. She's the constructive reader and I'm the deconstructive writer. I adore how she has every ounce of my arrogance too, completely unphased by my foolish overconfidence. Lol! I'm just her retarded fucking child (she's such a pedo).

I've won a lot of lotteries in this world. One of them is finding someone peculiar enough to desire being with me so thoroughly and at such a young age.<<ref "i">> I'm 34, and I'm months away from my 15th anniversary (something incredibly rare for my age group); I'll have had a relationship with her for over half my life. Sir Fred de Rosset warned me in a capstone class at Berea against getting married so young (what an asshole ;P). He and I never got along (it's a pattern, I know).<<ref "s">> He was correct that I had at least one more radical transformation in my identity, but he was wrong to think my wife didn't understand her commitment (which is hardly to say we've done it well or perfectly). 

Something like 12% of married people don't even reveal to their spouses their income and wealth, and obviously most never share their assets together all the way down. My god, these people have no idea what they are supposed to be looking for in a significant other, in sharing our dialectical identities. Try trusting someone with what really matters to you all the way down. Holy fuck, they have no idea what intimacy, trust, and vulnerability really look like. I'm afraid most people never even get a taste of a wife like mine.<<ref "m">> That's horrifying. Best friend doesn't capture it. I think some people believe co-dependence is a bad thing, but that kind of vulnerability where it would kill us to lose them is as good as it gets. 

Recently, people have been asking her how I felt about her getting the position and our moving, like it was against my interests, sprung on me out of the blue, or I'd have a problem with it. Wat. What the fuck are you talking about, folx? Our lives are planned together so integrally (which is not to say we are effective in our executive functioning) that we aim (however poorly) for even the unplanned parts to be part of the plan. If that woman told me to grab [[m16]] and get in the car with our offspring because we had to leave right then and there, that's what we'd do (sure, she'd be explaining to me, but I know there's an explanation). She makes decisions for me, and when I go completely insane, probably all of them.

Dunbar systems are hardly well-understood. I am convinced that homo sapiens need a radical significant other. I'm not talking about monogamy; I'm talking about having someone else define you in [[love]] over decades. Social dyadicism, pair bonding, literally being 50% owned by another human being. I shit you not, in Hohfeldian property right structures over what is autonomously leftover (beyond my obligations to the world), my wife morally owns half my body and mind. That seems so wrong-headed to people in my experience.
