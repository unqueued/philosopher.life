To Whom It May Concern,

I saw your post on HN (it was up for 2 minutes); https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16703875. I found this as well: https://angel.co/spacetime-yc-s12/jobs/346230-reality-boundary-dissolving-designer.

My guess is you are making a psychedelic joke (in this case, I hope I've afforded you a good laugh). On the remote off-chance you aren't merely a troll, I present you a unique rabbithole resume:

Read the {About} page. Perhaps our goals align. I do not know. Feel free to reach out to me.

Sincerely,
