You are enjoying number theory. You are doing good work in that book. That book is legit mathematics. It might be easy or hard, but it is a doorway you can take!

I like your mandala flower drawing from today. You should study symmetry. You can draw with it, yes. You can also study something very special there. I'm a noob there in the desert, but I know it is special.

I am a Platonist. I am convinced GÃ¶del knew it too. I think [[The Beauty]] of mathematics is real all the way into metaphysical existence. I'm considered an insane person for believing a truthbearer (and maker/justifier) of mathematics exists in metaphysics. That is a hell of a [[faith]]. It is a very serious discussion in [[The Great Human Conversation]].
