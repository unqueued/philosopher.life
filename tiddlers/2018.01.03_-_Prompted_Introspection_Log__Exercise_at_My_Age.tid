title: 2018.01.03 - Prompted Introspection Log: Exercise at My Age

!! Why is exercise important to someone your age?

Is there an age in which it isn't important for primarily the same reasons? Maybe. When you get super fucking old, maybe. However, it seems useful even then. 

Exercise may not be the best way to lose weight, as caloric intake is the best in that respect, but it has an enormous impact on our cardiovascular systems and our mental states. I think there are physiological reasons it helps us mentally, but also ready-to-hand primal satisfactions it causes as well. 

I walk. When I'm working with my hands, I use my body. I must admit, I'm fairly sedentary now. I was a fairly active kid. I would argue it was a significant source of dopamine for me. It's kind of hard to drag me away from my computer, on top of my hikikomority. At this point, I walk when I can talk with someone. Usually, I'm calling my brother, and if I'm lucky, my wife goes with me.
