title: 2020.04.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Game Recognize Game

* Woke at 10
** Absurdly vivid dreams. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Worked on [[Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden]]
* [[JRE]] called me
** Conduction earphones. He sounds good, and he could hear me clearly (in fact, it's like a mini speaker phone).
** Keto diet planning. No fun.
** He's definitely feeling the heat of watching Matthew all day.
** I don't think he's going to be gardening with me here. Not convinced he's going to do much else prep. Not sure what he's thinking here.
** He made me laugh a ton today. 
* Worked on [[Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden]]
* Walk with muh wife
** I needed it. 
** She did more talking than usual.
*** Our friend Olivia from college called up. She's been on a journey.
** Angel Benjamin appeared at the end of the walk.
*** He honored us with conversation. We were lucky to see him again. He seemed to remember us.
*** He gave us many hugs and even kisses. 
*** I am, yet again, unable to follow what this man is telling me. I listen carefully. I think his friend James might be a part of him. I do not know.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** We each cooked our own meal together
** 2x games of Dominion
*** Whiskey, and I laughed my ass off during the games. =)
* Fell asleep in my wife's lap during episode of //Westworld//.
* Woke at midnightish
* Read+Write
