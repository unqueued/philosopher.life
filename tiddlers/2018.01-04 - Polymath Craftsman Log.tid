!! Audit:

* After realizing that I wasn't merely looking to engage in Pipefitting but instead something far broader, I've been trying to find ways to be handy.
* I never did get the fitter's information. I think I cannot trust the people that my wife works with, of course. I shouldn't need to be taught that lesson over and over again. 
* I really wasn't as handy as I'd have liked.
* Now that I'm working again, it is much easier to fill this up. 
* This will take many years to fill up. I'm excited by the prospect.
* I hope I don't have such enormous gaps of time where I don't use this log.
