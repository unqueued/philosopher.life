title: 2020.01.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: This Smells Like My Wiki

* Did I wake? I don't know. It was a nightmare night. 
* I can barely talk today. Folks kindly asking me questions, and I can barely sputter anything out.
* Family Time!
** My daughter introduced an excellent topic, and we rabbitholed.
*** That'll teach her for asking good questions!
*** I had to whisper.
** Went to look at their models, and we found they had been lying. So angry, I stopped it right there. I don't have energy to be angry, I can barely breathe.
* Chats with folks
* Wife and I read and talked about each other's wikis
* Wife makes a mug of lemon-honey tea that cuts through mucus and applies le soothing balm.
* Walk with wife
** More cough suppressant. Fuck yes, please. Shooting for highest safe dosage I can.
** I'm so lucky to be able to walk.
* Pork chops, potatoes, gravy, zucchini
* //Psych//
** I'm 100% convinced [[2019.12.09 - WordsMeanThings: Making Contact]] is referencing it now. Squinting before, but I can't not believe it at this point.
* Couldn't do 1-on-1's. My voice is toast, but I can sit and listen to the general chatter.
* Read+Write
* Watching GMs teach noobs. 
** Such a fantasy to watch and not play.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Tried going to bed early, but just tossed in my chair trying to sleep until 4:30. =/
