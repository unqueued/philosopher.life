title: 2020.01.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Garage

* Woke at 10:30
** Ugh, terrible fucking sleep. I thought we were done with this bullshit. Phlegm.
* Offspring weren't awake either (despite an alarm clock).
* We jumped into cleaning. 
* Some car paperwork.
** We have a long way to go. 
** We need to figure out how we're going to do inspections.
** Gonna be DMV hell for a bit.
* Looked for other insurers. At best, saves us $200 a year. That said, Geico has saved my ass more than once in breakdowns like a ghetto AAA.
* Garage was pwned! 
** Tried making room for a possible ping-pong table, but that aint happening. 
** Tool area looks solid, storage makes sense.
** Backporch has the goods too.
* Dialectures
* Living saw some major work. 
** Finally have my chalkboard (next to my desk too, <3). 
** Books set.
* Sent offspring on a walk
* Wife and I walked
** She was exhausted today. Not enough sleep. I've got to get her to bed earlier. We're staying up too late.
** She's getting bored, but is thinking it will pick up. She's getting all the access she needs to make her own work too. 
*** Seems like we need to engage in some long-term planning here. Perhaps just going straight for a degree would be a viable option?
**** Waiting for the 3-year mark makes more sense, and focusing on the offspring (assuming they are going to give a shit) would be wildly better.
* Offspring made chops, potatoes, gravy, asparagus
** My daughter nailed it!
* //Psych//
** Fell asleep in her lap again. <3
* I made brownies with my offspring
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Chess Network vidyas
