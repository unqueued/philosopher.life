I think your idea is interesting. If you are going to enable moderation at all, I don't see why we shouldn't be open to this. Your idea seems like the de facto approach we should be taking up.

Of course it would lead to more deleted content and bans at various levels in the thread. If that isn't a good thing (and it might not be), then perhaps moderation in general is problematic. 

Personally, I think users should be able to remove their own content, but moderation should be fully transparent. I should be able to run a script in my browser that reconstructs chilling effects of censorship. I wish I could pick moderators I trust for any given sub or thread who have what I consider to be high signal-to-noise ratio upvoting, downvoting, banning, and content deletion. I want to distribute and leverage trust, and I don't want to be stuck looking at what a single moderation team wants to show me.
