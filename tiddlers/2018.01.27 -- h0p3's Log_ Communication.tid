title: 2018.01.27 -- h0p3's Log: Communication

I notice that few people reach out to communicate with me, and I tend to be the initiator in most cases. This asymmetry is not an accident. It says something about who we are. I don't know if it means I'm the asshole, they are assholes, we all are assholes, or something more complex. Relationships, of course, are two way streets. 

It makes me sad that we don't communicate much. It must be stressful. That's okay. I'll keep knocking on the door. What else ought I do? I will take solace in communicating with myself!
