!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The responsibility of the writer as a moral agent is to try to bring the truth about matters of human significance to an audience that can do something about them.
<<<

I agree writers have profound moral responsibilities. I'm fine with this rule-of-thumb insofar as we are fairly broad in our interpretation of what counts as significance and doing "something about them." If the claim is that we wisely bridge theory into practice, then it has to be correct by definition. Do philosophy well in your context.
