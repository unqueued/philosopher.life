title: 2020.04.07 - Prompted Introspection: Teen Angst

!! What would you write in a letter you could send back in time to yourself as a teenager?

What am I talking about in [[2018.07.08 - Prompted Introspection: Teenage Me]]? I'm paying attention, sir!

It depends on where in my teenagehood. My C64 couldn't open this wiki. It would be a pain in the ass to even distribute the wiki onto 5 1⁄4 inch floppies. I would be impressed to see my 133mhz Cyrix 6x86L box with 128MB of RAM use this wiki. My Intel® Pentium® III could pull it off, but I suggest it would be an uphill battle. No, my first 64-bit AMD computer for EQ2 and WoW would be the first computer fit for the job. 

I guess I could print up the wiki. Lawd. That would be a giant pile, and there'd be no way I'd be allowed to read it. I'd need to devote a new section of the wiki to writing the entrance for various selves. I'd need to speak differently to the various stages of [[h0p3]]. Beyond the usual lottery numbers and stonks approach, I'd have a lot of educating to do. I wish I could be as awesome as my own offspring. I don't think I could say what I'd like to say quickly enough, and I don't think I would have listened very well. I'd need to provide proofs that I was who I say I am to myself, and I need to help teenage me bootstrap into this device. It takes a lot of practice to wield it.

Also, I hope [[Josiah]] is doing well. I assume he got tired of speaking with a crazy person. =)
