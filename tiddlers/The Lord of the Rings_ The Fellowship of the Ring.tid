I want to smash through this with my children as well. We'll go through these books together. I need to make sure they are writing about it. Kids are in for a real treat too. Phil Dragash has an absolutely sick audiobook here. I'm blown away it.

As a fat man, I adore elevensies and filling up the corners.

The spiritual dimension is very loud.

I wish there was a better inspection of the relationship of power and corruption. It's not like the books don't scream it, but it doesn't go nearly as far as I'd have liked. Part of the problem may just be his classism.

Going through two books with "The Dark Lord," I think the unspoken, almost gnostic stealth is worth considering. I consider Sauron to be one of the best evil characters I've ever encountered.

Ring of Gyges, as always, screams out. There are clear differences though.

The traveling name is fascinating. I think the exchange between Gandalf and Frodo in the beginning is among my favorites in the entire series.

I am always amazed at the difference in the propagation of news.

The Ring of Power is addictive. I do not know what the Will to Power means in this case, how we separate ourselves from it, and what it means to have power over power.

The songs in this copy are very natural sounding.

The penetrating questions of the elves are interesting. How the ring does not always overtake them is forced. The metanarrative is Christian.

I love the fencing in/out claim. Hello, dialectic.

I love how advice is given in a guarded manner.

Virtue theory is obvious here.

Ringwraithes would have caught these hobbits if there was "providence." I find that really annoying.

This book is actually too slow for me now. Have I become the uncouth movie watcher? Maybe. Perhaps it's because I actually read the codex much faster.

My children seem to love (standard) mushrooms as much as the hobbits. I can't wait until they are old enough to try psilocybin mushrooms. I think either 18, 25, or existential depression/crisis are the markers that make the most sense to me.

I love how Trees may in fact communicate. This isn't some OOO point either (but it could be). Parts of LOTR become more real to me.

Tom Bombadil will forever be the most problematic character in the entire fucking series. I have a billion questions, and I know Tolkien has zero fucking answers besides his whim. What was his subconscious malfunction?

Goldberry sounds like a good slut. Ring my bell, girl.

This section is one of my least favorite in the series during reading, but I like to ask the "what if's" and "what does it means about the ontology?" questions outside (or I did).

My wife likes to tease me about Bombadil. She knows the story point drives me insane. =) I love her. I feel like there author is being violent here! His whim destroys the realism of the fantasy. It's his story though. I do understand the escapist drive. It's not like I haven't enjoyed the Bombadil sequence before, but over time, it just keeps getting worse and worse. It doesn't re-read well.

Why does Frodo just hand it over without the affective restrain? I need to stop. Lol. No, don't go down this route of questioning. Just enjoy the show, homie.

Too late! Bombadil reminds me of the non-cognitivism of virtue theory that allows The Slip into confabulation...as if moral life is just easy, bro. Rofl. Tolkien really was a piece of shit on this point, especially for how much he trash talked Lewis.

Been having trouble getting my chillun to do their work. I thought I would stop this, but I really want to do it with them.

I have a hard time figuring out which character I'm most like in this story. Obviously, I have a lot in a common with many of the characters. I usually can't find a character that is like me, which is fine.

The stealth and secrecy of these stories continue to shine for me.

The "everyone knows everything about everyone" small town thing has disappeared in my life. I lived in that before. It's a curious thing. I realize it has some negative effects, but overall, there was also a sense of community that wouldn't have been there otherwise. The way news spreads is organic, slow, etc. I'm not being romantic about it.

OC is adored. That said, I still don't like the songs. They are flavor that I want to skip. Yeah, yeah, I get it.

Why doesn't Aragorn take the ring? The ring's "pull" makes no sense.

The Hobbit has one wild thing after another. FOTR is largely mundane, and it slowly builds up across the series. It's that classic arc.

I'm not sure the children are loving this. They loved The Hobbit. Should we wait to do LOTR? Will the end be awesome enough to them? I don't want to waste their first reading.

This book takes me back to Everquest. I played EQ before reading LOTR. It's an interesting experience to dive into the derivative (I do not use this word negatively) first.

I do not understand Strider. Sometimes he is human, sometimes he is more. Why can't he live at Riverdale again? How does he know his fate, or what does he think it is?

I gotta say, given the extremeness of what happens in the later books, I feel like the ringwraithes aren't even trying in this book!

I assume I'm reading this book out of sheer comfort again. My amygdala doesn't want me to be challenged.

I studied the map again. I've seen many maps of Middle Earth. We have a foil one in the living room too. I think this particular book has one of my favorites.

Tolkien spends way more time explaining context and lore outside of [[The Hobbit]].

My wiki basically my Precious. I talk to it often. 

He's going to drive me insane with the classist notion of not disrespecting or questioning authority or "your betters." 

Painfully enjoying Gandalf explaining to Bilbo that nobody is going to read Bilbo's book. I hear that.

The recolors memory and perception for Bilbo. He has that spiritual sense that something is off and wrong, but he can't put his finger on it; surely it's not the thing which he puts on his finger.

Okay, perhaps le Dark Lord just wasn't powerful enough to sense the ring. 

The way in which the will is understood in this book is not consistent. It's also a huge difference between The One Ring and the [[ROG]]. The will to power seems to come alive here though, it is reified. 

Gandalf's actions and inferences are incoherent. This is not how he would react.

I don't think the elves would have left Frodo like this. This is insane.

The wraiths don't hunt for the ring meaningfully enough. They aren't blinded by the pursuit of it enough.
