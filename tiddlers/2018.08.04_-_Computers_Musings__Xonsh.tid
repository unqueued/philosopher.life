title: 2018.08.04 - Computers Musings: Xonsh

Trying to get xonsh build system EZ. Package controller installed. Nobody has it. Python syntax is good enough.

Fucking sick useful to me: [[sanitize-clipboard.xsh]]

Generating [[Linux Tool Collection]], also forgot [[tmux]] for [[Leet Tools]]. Installing whatever I'm missing.
