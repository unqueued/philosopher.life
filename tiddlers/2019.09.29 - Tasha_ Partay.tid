title: 2019.09.29 - Tasha: Partay

God damn, we had such a good time. We brought a lot of alcohol, and they came prepared as well. We talked, drank, and they smoked (I have no ability to do so). She wants to try shrooms, and I should grow some eventually.

Esteban is a hoodrat who was able to attend private schools. I have met several such, and we get along likes peas and carrots (that's what I am at the end of the day). They know what it's like to be forced into this third culture sitting on the outside of two different worlds, codeswitching, [[redpill]]ed AF, seeing the lies and self-deceptions of emerging narratives everywhere. It's paranoic, isolating, and a hardknocks teacher of who we really are deep down.

Esteban recognized the millionaire's psychopathy more openly; he talked about the flashes and slips (a change, and I see why he switched jobs). [[Tasha]] is coming to grips, maybe. She hates that we both say or imply she's a slave (to some [[dok]]). She does stand up for herself, but she deserves so much better. She is sacrificially generous to those girls; she's their real momma. The traces of the Rand-Locke memeplex are still in sections of their reason and perception, but I think the infection is dying even further. 

It's so weird: outdoors, Esteban and I do the classic "male" greetings and so forth, but inside during our parties, we actually talk. There is something about being inside the house that matters to him maybe. His paranoia matches mine in many cases, and so I must create those spaces for us.

He's so wonderfully plain, talks gorgeous trash, picks out discrimination like a boss, and I like that he doesn't hold back and I know what he's thinking. If he doesn't like something, he's going to tell you. I adore it. He's chill in a way I am not, and perhaps I must learn to be more like that.

His technical paranoia isn't accurate, but the spirit is correct. Maybe it's a stoner thing? Peas and carrots.

Matthew and I talked about his interview. I sent him a list of questions. We talked about life as an autist in the world; it aint easy. I hope he does not feel alone. He is lucky to have a sister who loves him that much. I'd love to see the dude smashed drunk, but he's the rule-following autist to a tee (and, I know, I am one too! ;P). 

To my eyes, they are functionally married. It's wonderful to have the chance to speak with another married couple so openly. I don't get to do that often at all. 

We talked about what it's like to have remote relationships. We asked fun drunk questions. I'm sure I must be annoying to them at all times, but I'm egregious when I'm drunk. My wife dutifully put her hand in my lap to shut me up multiple times. Yes, dear. I'm lucky to have a watcher, a handler, someone to pull the leash to hold me back from jumping over the social cliffs and so forth. My cheerful antagonism is sometimes too poisonous. I call into question far too many things we are supposed to politely assume in our collective storytelling when I name or imply the absurdity of something; I'm just mean, uncharitable, and a dirty rat bastard (HOW DARE HE!). All that said, I also put people at ease because I cuss good, I'm disgusting (easy to be more sophisticated than I am), I can feel your pain, and no topic is off the table (though you will pay certain prices with me).

These people are stupidly busy, and I'm grateful they made time to throw a party for us. Their kitten, Naya, is cute AF. We must invite them over again.
