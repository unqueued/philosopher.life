!! Audit:

* I'm glad I quit Cannabis a month in advance of my initial plan. It is paying off. I knew that I was running out of content, and I knew I would likely need to generate field experience earlier than I thought. This was a wise move. Good job!
* I shot for $15 an hour, I did even better (although, perhaps not much better after travel expenses). I will continue to look for a job at TEC.
* I didn't have interview questions prepared; it was all of the sudden. This is not an industry which seems to have the standard kind of application process. I suppose that can be a good thing for me. I assume it only becomes more professionally normalized the higher up you go the food chain.
* I've avoided the co-op entirely, it appears. I'm just going to graduate 6 months early, rofl. Noice! 
* I did not finish my NCCER certification; although, I will have finished the 3rd book (assuming I don't fail this last test; although, I've never failed one before). I will find out if I can. It may or may not be useful, except as a blip on my resume. The union doesn't seem to care, but others might. I assume by the time it matters, I may be in much better shape. It really depends on how the next 2-3 years go.
* We never did have our rigging seminar. My teacher misunderstood what was happening. It was just a Boilermaker's advertisement. I should still consider the Boilermaker's union. It would be longer-term travel if I understand. That isn't what I want.
* It is not clear that my local union is really working out. The last time I saw Randy, when we were with others, he merely introduced me as someone hoping to join. I don't know exactly why. Is it because that is what I officially am, and he needs to keep up appearances or is it because he literally means just that? It could be either.
* My concerns about the collusion/relationship considerations between my teacher and Randy have waned somewhat. It became clearer over the course of this month that my teacher was looking for other non-union options for me because the union didn't seem to be working out so nicely. I'm happy to see that he understands where I am coming from to some extent.
* The printed resumes were nearly useless. Even what I took to be more analog industries are digitized in this respect. They were only useful in handing off to a couple people in the school. It wasn't clear these people actually helped me. I think they were just curious about the information, trying to understand their star student or something. 
* It has been a ride with AB&T. Once my schedule went off the tracks, it really went off the tracks. I'm hoping all of this works out. It is a crucial injection of capital into my future. Regardless of my socialist concerns about the nature of AB&T, I am at least grateful that they've helped me. 
* I did not smash this book as quickly as I thought I would. I should take that as a lesson. I probably will need to re-read this content. There is a lot to know. There is a difference between being able to cram and pass a test and having stored it in my long-term memory, and it is an even longer jump into having integrated it into the virtue-theoretic practices and applications of that knowledge.
* I never did finish the simulator. Lol. I assume I'm going to get a shit ton of practice at my new job. I hope I'm ready.
* There are several students I'll be leaving behind. I don't think I really care about my connections with them. TJ and Chris are the most likely to succeed. I have Chris' number, and TJ can be contacted through the union. The other students, if I ever really needed to reach them, could perhaps be contacted through my teacher. I don't think that will ever happen. I think only a few legitimate pipefitters really come out of that class each year. I hate to say it, but a lot of them are just losers (which may not be their fault).
* I am worried about my new job for a lot of reasons and in different ways. One thing I'm worried about is that I'm an imposter. That I won't know until I get into the field. That said, my teacher feels confident, and they liked my simulator work. I think I might succeed without too many problems. More worryingly, I know that I'm going to make a ton of mistakes, and I worry that I won't be able to fix them effectively, in a timely manner, or that it may cost me my job. That said, I'll have graduated, so it's okay.
* It only took me a couple weeks to actually find a job. I should be willing to job hob for now until I find the outfit that I really like. This is a low-risk, high-reward time. Anything is better than nothing at the moment, but I shouldn't be afraid to lose my job right now. I should continue to push for the best opportunities. It is important that I am not held back my employer, particularly here. Eventually, having built the right social capital and connections will be so important that I can't simply hop around. I'm not there yet though.
* I never did finish my alignment dogs. This wasn't exactly my fault. I lacked the threaded rods and nuts (or CNC'd taps) to make finish them off. Hopefully, I'll find an opportunity to finish them at my new job. It sounds like we are working with fairly small pipe. I may never actually use them at this job.
* My teacher started spending more time in the shop this month. I'm not sure I understand why. I can tell you that the shop was fairly barren. There are so few students left, and they spend too much time in the computer lab and studying the book. I think I was lucky to get as much shop time as I did (which, of course, could not have been made possible without me pushing for shop time). 
* I need to keep an open mind and be humble at my new position. I can't act like I know nothing though. I do need to build up rep/respect, and I need to be taken seriously enough to actually push my limits. There will be a feeling out process. 
* Twice I have broken the social conventions/rules by working in the shop without permission. I know I do so without the hesitation of others, as I'm only concerned with what I take to be moral. Of course, there are consequentialist considerations which I'm taking into account. I should still be mindful. I realize that I should only cross others' lines when it is truly necessary.
* I never did contact the electrician's union. It seems more reasonable because it is local. Ugh. It seems so difficult to shift gears. What makes me journeyman the fastest? Pipefitting. It seems like the best choice. Journeyman gives me the mobility, autonomy, and pay that I really need.
* I should continue to follow up on the AB&T tooling issue. I really need them asap. 
* I've not really contacted Randy. I need to though. It is important that he sees I mean business. I've tried many times. 
* It is important to see that my new employer does not obviously have their shit together. I must be guarded about this, but appear amiable and flexible. 
* I like that I've written out my steps, taken additional precautions and preparations and that I'm engaging in long-term planning. Success is not entirely an accident, even if it requires serious streaks of luck. 
* I need to thank my teacher. I have, but I'd like to demonstrate it more clearly.
