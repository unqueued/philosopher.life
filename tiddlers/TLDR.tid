title: TLDR

!! About:

//My wiki is a fine example of unconscionable, perhaps immoral, absurd, discursive, and esoteric prolix. Some people think it's intentionally obscurantist; these people are conspiracy theorists, or so I tell myself. However sloppy, unfinished, and sprawling: it's true that I prize precision over concision. It is rare that I justifiably achieve both. I am [[hoping]], in [[justified|The Right]] contrast, these are tweetable, [[antipleonasmic]] Platonic-dialogues and [[beautiful]] moments.//

I am lucky to have those in my life who teach me to be more self-deprecating. I am the most HumBLe man you've ever met; I gwaruntee it. I hope the self-deprecation work in this log serves as a role-model to how I create the rest of my work. It's important to know that my autism makes me ineffective in formulating TLDRs for others. I pack suitcases which require my specific idiocy to unpack, and too often they aren't worth unpacking because an idiot packed them. I don't know what to do about my compression, which includes knowing what's worth compressing. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it does not; sometimes it's not my fault, and sometimes it so clearly is. I need to learn when to shutup and when to say more. I apologize for being an overly-self-righteous and shitty interlocuter and person. 

This [[directory]] started out as generating "[[just absolute antipleonasm|https://www.kickscondor.com/notes/the-opposite-of-incoherent]]" about other parts of the wiki which one might worry could use an abstract, an intro, plain language reduction, or a ditty. I'm glad it turned into TLDRing self-deprecating stories. I am always in need of parables, teachable moments, and TLDR-worthy faceslaps.
