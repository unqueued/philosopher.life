title: 2007.04.24 - Maturity in Faith--The Recognition of a Conflict and a Choice

Look inside yourself. You know there is a struggle. You have to make the decision to do what is good or to do what is evil, you will fail someday in this choice (probably many days). You will know the Will of God, but you will deny it. You will rationally choose that which is irrational. You will be, in that instant, post-modern and a relativist. You will deny the truth. You will choose to change your perception of good being good, to the wrong being good. You choose what you feel is most valuable (always--undeniable fact), and when you choose evil, you are claiming that this &quot;evil&quot; really isn't evil to you, you are saying that it is the most valuable option. You willingly modify your memory, your belief, and your knowledge of what is good and what is evil. You give in to that temptation to do wrong. You believe you are smarter than God, that you are correct and He is somehow wrong. You commit blasphemy. You refuse to relinquish control, to give to God what was already His to begin with! You deny God His right to your mind and to your choice. At some level, everyone is the deep sinner. You doubt the existence and truth of God by your very choice and desire to do evil. You are no better than the rest of the trash in this world in this respect.

It is in this mindset that I have the utmost empathy for sinners. I see us as brothers in a struggle, a self-conflict. You cannot pass this off as mere &quot;angst&quot;. This is a question of denying self for God--you better be anxious about that! For those who are not &quot;nervous&quot;, I think a.) You are either perfect or, and far more likely, b.) you are too stupid to realize you are also in this continual conflict. When I am not actively evil, I hope I can be honest about who I am in those moments. I want to reach out to the people who are stupid and evil, especially because I know I need it when I am being stupid and evil. I have been where they are now! I must be discerning, but I must be compassionate.

The denial of such a conflict, or the scoffing at the honest outward manifestation of such a conflict that we all obviously have (but choose to hide), is a choice of ignorance, hypocrisy, and a choice which lacks the compassion and will to help those in need (the people in conflict!). It is here that I fully appreciate the music of Nine Inch Nails. How shocking!? Right? Why would I listen to NiN? Isn't he demonic (C.S. Lewis spells it: Demoniac)? Isn't he evil? Look at his lyrics to some of his more blasphemous songs (and I rarely can even hear lyrics in a song, I only hear music, ask anyone; I still don't know lyrics to songs I've heard hundreds of times...but when I have a spiritual stake in the matter, I can remember the words for some reason...Church music and Nine Inch Nails).

NiN songs, the best ones of course, are concerned with this idea of control. While I do not make the same conclusions as my friend from NiN, I can see where is coming from. I see him across the bright boundary. I know I jump to his side of the boundary each and every time I sin, and I cannot act like I have never been there. I see why he is there, and I admire that he has the balls to flat say what the conflict is in the end: an issue between our control and God's control. Do we give up ourselves to God? Yes, he chooses incorrectly, but he is no hypocrite--that boy sins boldly.

To any autonomous and sentient being of this world, giving up the true authority and control of self is a much larger thing than most anyone can imagine. It can feel worse than death (and there are several things worth than death if you need further explanation). It is a willing sacrifice of that which we most value about ourselves. We honestly cannot justify our occupation of this control, we are required to give it back. The greatest good is to give the control back to God. You are meant to be a slave--you are not meant to value yourself. You are only valuable insofar as you are useful or good to God. Do you know what is required of you? Can you possibly fathom the robotry asked of you? I doubt many do.

Yes, welcome to existentialism. The land where everyone fails, where most are blind, and where the few live in anguish as we recognize both what is required and why we fail over and over again.

While I listen to NiN, I know where I stand, and I am sobered. This is the spiritual battle that is before us all. It is real. It is the most important choice we can make, and NiN does a better job of showing this than half of the happy-go-lucky-warm-fuzzy crap I find in church. I would rather dine with a sinner that knows he is a sinner than the likes of the people I goto church with. Lukewarm is really a continual denial of this battle of control--it is no different to me than the unforgivable sin.

You are all in or nothing. I have much more respect for those who choose nothing than the lukewarm. The ones who chooses nothing has a chance to repent, just as I have a chance to repent when I choose to sin and when I have temporarily chosen the nothing.

Here, at the recognition of our base conflict, it is easy to see why one would &quot;mourn their faith&quot;. Every bone in our body seeks to maintain control of ourselves, we want to be ourselves. Being a true Christian is more than a leap of faith, it is the purposeful casting of one's self off a cliff, hoping never to return. It requires, to some degree, self-hatred in that sacrifice. Matured faith is much more difficult than we make it out to be. God help us.
