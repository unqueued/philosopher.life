title: Egoism

For the record, I believe I am a socialist because I believe the working class should own and control the means of production. I support personal property rights and oppose private property rights. I believe capitalism inevitably leads to the enslavement of the masses (to varying degrees) through the theft of labor and systematic oppression of the working class. I believe capitalism endorses a human-eat-human world, fails to protect human dignity, and fails to cultivate mutual respect and empathy in human societies. I believe we are on a moral quest to find and implement a practical and working socialist system on a global scale. I believe we will fail because I think humans are overwhelmingly egoistic, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to save our world. I don't have cause for any practical hope outside of my theoretical hope. 

Just because I believe the description of human nature is overwhelmingly egoistic doesn't mean I'm not a socialist, and it doesn't mean my beliefs are inconsistent. This is the key that Andrew Collier (and several other social theorists) are missing, imho. Here is the nuance which OP's quote doesn't quite capture (ofc, it would be hard to do in just a few words):

Egoism can be used *descriptively* and it can be used *prescriptively*. Egoism as a prescription (Ethical Egoism) is the claim you *ought* to be fundamentally self-interested. Egoism as a description (Psychological Egoism) is the claim that our motivations can be reduced to self-interest. 

What does it mean to say our motivations can be reduced to self-interest? 

If the happiness of others is a necessary condition to my happiness, then pursuing the happiness of others is a necessary means to my happiness as an end. I can be self-interested in my final goal while recognizing that I can't achieve that goal unless I actually care about the happiness of others.

Now, you might be quick to claim there is a contradiction or logical inconsistency here. Egoism, in practice, appears self-defeating. If the interests of others is instrumental to my self-interest, then by being interested in something besides myself, I'm no longer self-interested, right? I'd like fire back: isn't it possible that someone can consciously recognize that they love others because they love themselves? 

Why do I love gravy on my mashed potatoes? Is it because I love gravy *tout court*? No. I love gravy because I love the taste, and I love the taste because my mind and body are structured so as to reward me with pleasure for eating that delicious gravy. I love gravy because I love pleasuring myself. I love pleasuring myself because I love myself, i.e. because I'm self-interested. I'm self-interested because my mind and body are often structured so as to reward me for being self-interested. Being interested in gravy is not necessarily inconsistent with my self-interest. Just as I can be interested in gravy in virtue of my self-interest, I can be interested in others in virtue of my self-interest. 

Of course, eating too much gravy is detrimental to my health and ultimately my long-term happiness. It isn't in my self-interest to eat as much gravy as I can. My interest in gravy isn't always consistent with my self-interest. Self-interest requires practicing self-restraint while indulging in gravy. 

Ah, but what happens when my self-interest isn't compatible with your interests? How do I resolve this conflict of interests? Do I weigh them? What principles should I use? 

Ethical egoism bifurcates here. 




Descriptive egoism might be seen as *ad hoc* in its reduction. It seems more like an application of Occam's Razor to me though. 



Say a magic genie could either snap his fingers and make a socialist utopia or leave the world as it is (let us pretend that the genie's lucky wisher understands the implications and possibility of a socialist utopia). Consider the difference between the two following questions:

* What *should* each of us choose? 
* What *would* each of us choose? 

On both ethical and psychological egoism, it seems very likely that the elite ruling class both *should* and *would* choose the status quo. After all, they maximize their personal utility by keeping the working class enslaved and oppressed. 

The working class answers in the other direction. On ethical egoism, the working class obviously benefits the most from choosing a socialist utopia. 


It seems like there's no difference between descriptive and prescriptive egoism so far. They both arrive at the same conclusion. Here's where the difference shows up:



Here's another way to think of it. Rawls' has the concept of a Veil of Ignorance. Pretend you were stripped of your morally arbitrary characteristics, that you didn't know what you life on Earth would be like, what kinds of principles of justice would you select




Clearly, most people on the planet will benefit from socialist policies. 


Psychological Egoism:








Importantly, the description of psychological egoism may even come in degrees. In conceptual analysis, there appears to be room in Psychological egoism for self-interest to come in degrees, that is egoism might possibly be show strong tendencies and high probabilities to be self-interest. There may still be room for us to evolve or change to be more altruistic. Even if 

Most importantly descriptive egoism doesn't have to claim altruism is impossible, just that it is unlikely.

Just because we "are" or "tend to be" a certain way doesn't mean we have to be. If "ought implies can," and if we ought not be egoist, that doesn't necessitate that we descriptively aren't egoists. 


I am a socialist, but I really do think humans have evolved to be fundamentally selfish in important respects. I think cooperation can be innate, but that this cooperation is rooted in an memetic and genetic evolutionary story about individual specimens selfishly electing to cooperate in order to survive and thrive in societies.
