I am sorry that I am part of the reason you don't enjoy debate and philosophical argumentation  or discourse anymore. I am sorry for hurting you. I am doing my best to learn how to constructively engage in fundamental disagreement with you. Additionally, I think we are both stressed, and I am not as charitable or kind in tone or approach as I should be. I am sorry.
