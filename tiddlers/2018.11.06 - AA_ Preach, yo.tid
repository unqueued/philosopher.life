How do you take your coffee these days?

10 HR AGO
I don’t—it’s either coke or tea

I just can’t get over the bitter coffee taste

I have only recently become interested  in coffee. [[k0sh3k]] will take her leftovers and put them in a swill container for me in the fridge. I like cold black coffee and dark chocolate in the morning. Overlapping bitters, ftw.

Some days, I just NEED hot sauce.
