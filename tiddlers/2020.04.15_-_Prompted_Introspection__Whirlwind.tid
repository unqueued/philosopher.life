title: 2020.04.15 - Prompted Introspection: Whirlwind

!! What would it be like to be in a tornado?

This is a topic I've covered a few times:

* [[2018.03.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: Worst Weather Condition]]
* [[2018.07.18 - Prompted Introspection: In a Tornado]]
* [[2018.08.14 - Prompted Introspection: Brush With Death]]
* [[2019.03.04 - Prompted Introspection: Basement Weather]]

The tornado is one of my metaphors for life. Sometimes I call it a whirlwind. It's different from drowning for me since curling and letting the event passover me is less active in a way.
