title: 2018.11.26 - Prompted Introspection: Suitcase of Money

!! If you found a suitcase full of money in the middle of the street, what would you do?

Answered that here: [[2018.01.11 - Prompted Introspection Log: Money Suitcase]]. Capitalists have already forfeited their lives as slavers who only politely appear to have garnered consent. I'd be happy to take a capitalist's money. I have no intention of taking one red cent from an innocent. Searching for the original holder of the money would be necessary for determining the moral owner.
