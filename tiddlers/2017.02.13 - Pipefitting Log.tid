title: 2017.02.13 - Pipefitting Log

Today I took a test on power tools. I tend to read ahead in the book. My teacher gives us a study guide, and I carefully study those particular sections. I make A's on tests, but sometimes I miss a couple questions. My teacher seems unworried by it. But, this is a culture which is fine with C's and B's. I will force myself to retake the actual pipefitting exams until I can get them all right though.

Since I took my test early in the day (Mondays, from what I've gathered, are days where people sit on their asses and pretend to study while the teacher screws around), I was given something cool to do. I had asked about pipebending (since my brother talks about it often). Apparently, it is very uncommon for a pipefitter to do, but it does happen. So, I wanted to learn. We happened to have a giant programmable pipebending machine. We dusted it off (cleaned it and the area around it too) and started using it. I got to work with black iron pipe for the first time, and I also got to use the giant pipe cutting machine for the first time (super easy to use). Apparently, we are making 90s for the welding shop to use that day. /shrug, cool with me.

The pipebending machine hasn't been used for a year. My teacher had to bring out his calibration notes and the manual for the machine. We kept being 13 degrees off on our 90-degree bends. We cheated to make the bends (try squaring it by hand until we got it "good enough"). This didn't satisfy any of us. My teacher couldn't figure it out, so he let Keith and I figure it out. We watched the manufacturer's video, read the documentation, and messed around with it. It started working correctly for us, thankfully. I hate to say that I don't fully understand why we got it working when my teacher couldn't. It was kind of baffling. My suggestion, that we weren't initially mounting the pipe at a perpendicular angle (which is necessary) was turned down. I am quietly suspicious that I'm still right about this, but I can't say that I know that I'm right. I could easily be wrong.

I've been studying CAD prints. There is a lot of information on them and tons of objects I've never seen before. It looks doable though. From what I understand, the foreman (and/or pipefitter) interprets the prints and gives instructions or simplified isometric drawings to his underlings. A student who has been in the field (although, I suspect he doesn't have the drive or wisdom to know how to maximize his upward mobility) says that I wouldn't see those plans for at least 3 years as an apprentice. My teacher says a good journeyman or foreman would take the time to show me (and that I should definitely seek to understand them). I can only assume I will need to be excellent at it. My teacher walked me through a bunch of problems/questions I had about the prints he lent me.
