!! Audit:

* [[Saint Chomsky]] has dominated this log.
* I've been bored, feel like I have nothing to add, rarely disagree about anything large (and when it has been large, I'm flippant), and am nitpicky.
* There's good work in here, and I'm glad to solidify a position.
* I've not had to drop difficult tentpegs in the same way as I have against [[Ayn Rand]].
* Because he works with history and current events, you can feel how some of the material is dated. It's also clear that I barely scratch this surface of the amount of data this man has traversed.
* I may have pissed someone off with this one. =/
* I'm not nearly as formal as I thought I'd be.
* My responses are often smaller than the prompt. That is surprising!
* I think [[Saint Chomsky]] would not be pleased with any amount of Continental work I use to reason about his words.
* This log reminds me of writing on forums, but I don't have to worry about whether or not someone else is going to like it (outside of some idealized sense for [[The Golden Rule]] applied in my context).
** This log has inspired some of my now quite rare posting though.
* [[Saint Chomsky]]'s strengths are in analyzing propaganda, the centralization of power, and imperialism. He's weak in metaphysics and metaethics (though still makes some difficult and yet good moves).
** We different concepts of justification, no doubt.
* This log can be hard work sometimes, and I'm glad I do it.
* I'm enjoying doing this on a "person" basis, like I'm having a collapsed mini-dialectic with them.
