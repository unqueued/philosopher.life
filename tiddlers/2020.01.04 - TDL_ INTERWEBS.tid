title: 2020.01.04 - TDL: INTERWEBS

* Interwebs
** No, no, no...Today.
** [[m16]] can be up and running too.
* More shopping, presumably. 
** Recall, homie, that you will be without a vehicle until the evenings.
* Continue setting up the house as best we can until our stuff arrives.
* Coffeefilters
** For you, dearest. I had them in hand, and it took you 3 arguments to have me put them down. Now, I will drive another half hour for it. ;P
*** Sometimes you meet someone, and you know from the first moment that you want to spend your whole life without them...right? XD.
* Family Time!
* You need fruits and veggies. 
** Offspring's bellies are feeling okay, but the adults are feeling it.
