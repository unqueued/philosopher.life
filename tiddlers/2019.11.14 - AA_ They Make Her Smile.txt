Still searching for a place and making sure we can pay for it. Will be using a Pod. Getting boxes. We don't move until January 2-3ish, but we aim to have the current home packed and cleaned before the  trip to the cabin.

How's [[AG]] and [[UJ]]?
Nov 14, 2019 8:52am
They are good. The 1st grader that was so much trouble (stripping and peeing and spitting) has gone into a special behavioral program. So thats good. [[AG]] is making her way into a new good friend group
Nov 14, 2019 8:54am
I'm glad.
Nov 14, 2019 8:55am
How'd she get introduced? What makes them a good friend group for her?
Nov 14, 2019 8:55am
They are good girls and she has known them for a while but they have been in the other class
Nov 14, 2019 8:56am
They make her smile and have fun
Nov 14, 2019 8:56am
Aye, it's nice she has more people who make her smile and have fun.
