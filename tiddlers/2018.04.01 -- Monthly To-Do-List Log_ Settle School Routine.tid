title: 2018.04.01 -- Monthly To-Do-List Log: Settle School Routine

//I like writing this while I complete my audit. I get to triage and rethink. This is a good idea.//

* Finish the modularized resume
* Have a working [[NixOS]] development environment on HTPC.
* Try to find, take, and provide at least one positive reinforcement opportunity or instance per day for each person in your family. Work on being positive, you dumb piece of shit ;P.
* Continue to help my children become self-sufficient in school (as much as possible).
