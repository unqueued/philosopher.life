title: Cybernetic Eudaimonic Lifehacker Methodology

//Suspend Your Disbelief for one moment. Do not interrupt. Set aside the legion of excellent philosophical and practical questions you may have, and just see the vision. Be charitable, Straussian if you must.//

I imagine there are precious few people with a corpus of their thoughts like mine. Give it time, and my work may even be uniquely unique. The signals of who I am are very much embedded into this wiki. This may one day of be serious use to me (or, could also be a weapon used against me, I see the double-edged sword). 

I do not know how computers are going to evolve in the coming decades, or more importantly, how quickly. It is possible, perhaps given this wiki, that we will be able to build functional programs that mimic me, that can interact with me, that can interact with versions of me, etc. Perhaps we could even test how to influence the writer of this wiki programmatically by analyzing the wiki itself. I'm tying myself to it very strongly. I'm trying to make my mind as hackable as possible.

Imagine building a program built on this wiki that literally tries to teach itself given the wiki itself. Imagine looking at which outputs appeared happier. We could compare and think about their evolution. Imagine building a program that learns how to make this wiki happier. Imagine brute-forcing for the Eudaimonic Lifehacker in that search space. Find it, and figure a way to teach the owner to think that way in the shortest distance possible.
