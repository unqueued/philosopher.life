title: 2018.07.06 - PPP: Mathematical Platonism

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.00001.pdf

This is an attack on my turf. I am, essentially, a Platonist. I really do buy a rich concept of [[The Good]].

The constructivist contextualist somehow blinds themselves to the possibility of a universalizing context of all contexts. This is absurd. It's a matter of faith either direction. You really cannot be certain, but I suggest you already beg the fundamental questions in such a way that they only buy themselves hyperreality.

The problem of the foundation of Plato's metaphysics cannot be solved, as demonstrated by Gödel. I think Hegel can get us there pretty effectively as well. The Dialetheist brings us even closer. There is no rational way in finite language to talk about the infinite; we inevitably arrive upon at least one true contradiction.

But something starts to be disturbing.  The resulting M is big, extremely big: it contains too much junk. The large majority of coherent sets of axioms are totally irrelevant.

//Irrelevant// [[gfwiwcgws]], punk! To us? How do you know? Isn't the true universality and maximality of [[The Good]] that makes it what it is? I would expect nothing less!

During   the   Italian   Renaissance,   Michelangelo
Buonarroti, one of the greatest artists of all times, said
that a good sculptor does not create a statue:  he simply
“takes it out” from the block of stone where the statue
already lay hidden.  A statue is already there, in its block
of stone.  The artists must simply expose it, carving away
the redundant stone [6].  The artist does not “create” the
statue:  he “finds” it.

In  a  sense,  this  is  true:   a  statue  is  just  a  subset  of
the grains of stone forming the original block.  It suffices
to  take  away  the  other  grains,  and  the  statue  is  taken
out.  But the hard part of the game is of course to find
out
which
subset  of  grains  of  stone  to  leave  there,  and
this, unfortunately, is not written on the stone.  It is se-
lection that matters.  A block of stone already contained
Michelangelo’s
Moses
, but it also contained virtually any-
thing else –that is, all possible forms.  The art of sculp-
ture is to be able to determine, which, among this virtual
infinity of forms, will talk to the rest of us as art does.

Here's where you've failed to understand the nature of [[The Good]]: it's not reducible to mere Mathematics. The problem with your concept of Platonic forms is that it fails to include [[The Salience]] of itself! Only [[The Good]] is intrinsically good, self-defined. There is no escaping this. You are correct that math, ultimately is only instrumentally valuable, and that it cannot be reduced down, in and of itself, to what is the actual ultimate telos. The ultimate telos is the complete [[The Good]], or whatever is defined by it, and we cannot know.

You have a clever argument. I admire it's beauty. The mathematician can only speak of "is," but never "ought." Do not commit the naturalistic fallacy, and do not help yourself to that which you have no right even on your own terms.

Borges’s
famous library contained all possible books:  all possible
combinations of alphabet letters...Like  Michelangelo’s  stone,  Borges’s  library  is  void  of
any interest:  it has no content, because the value is in the choice, not in the totality of the alternatives.
<<<

Yeah, but [[The Good]] isn't reducible to such a thing. That is only part of the essential description. You must attempt to conceive of these books as computing themselves infinitely! 

You've strawmanned Platonism down to Mathematics. Open your mind.

I also agree that all infinite variations of every conceivable object, the essence of everything, including the mind-bending paradoxically self-refential and ultimately contradictory (for us) essence of all essences and saliences are bundled into it. 

Look, we're engaged in transcendental reasoning. We're engaged in faith like primitive primates pointing with a language that definitionally cannot describe the semantic thing-in-itself. It's not hopeless, but it is fundamentally impossible to succeed as we would wish to.

The value determined by what? You don't get to just help yourself!

<<<
Hegel’s  “night  in  which  all  cows  are  black” a  mere  featureless  vastness,  without  value  because  the
value is in the choice, not in the totality of the possibil-
ities. 
<<<

Again, a gorgeous analogy, but it begs the question against Platonism. Let me completely grant you the problem of flattening. I say unto you, the world itself is truly flat without [[The Good]]. There is no meaningful hierarchy without that totalitizer. 

<<<
Mathematics may be called an “ensemble of tautolo-
gies”,  in  the  sense  of  Wittgenstein.   But  it  is  not  the
ensemble of
all
tautologies:  these are too many and their
ensemble is uninteresting and irrelevant.  Mathematics is
about  recognizing  the  “interesting”  ones. 
<<<

WRONG! Doing Mathematics //well// picks out the interesting ones through anti-luck contextualism, but "well" is defined by [[The Good]]. You claim to be engaged in ethics, and with a sleight of hand, imply you are just doing mathematics.

Alright, I'm done.
