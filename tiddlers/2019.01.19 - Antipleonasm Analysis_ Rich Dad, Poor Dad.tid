!! Respond to the following gem:

It's the legal system if you're rich and the justice system if you're poor.

Omg, preach. The double-standard is fully real. Few things are "illegal" for the wealthy; they are simply taxed for the ability to do what we aren't allowed to do. Power continues to centralize in this dichotomy. Debtors prison and slavery are in full force here as well. I'm hard-pressed to find any serious attempts to curb this obvious bias to those in power in action. Decentralization is the only means of production of justice as fairness for all.
