One is Diamonized by Diamonds.

In contrast to [[Redpills]], Diamonds are primarily constructive. When we have refactored our perception in the right way, what was once chaos becomes legible and beautiful. Of course, that doesn't make them objectively correct, but we must hold onto what is precious until we can find better answers. Yes, inspect the facets of the gem, and you will find flaws. But, it is part of the metamodern commandment: construction must proceed deconstruction.

Previously, I thought Diamonds belonged to the persona opposed to [[RPIN]], but that may or may not be the case. It seems that even RPIN can construct Diamonds. Admittedly, RPIN tends to deliver Redpills more often. The degree to which one must construct a Redpill is perhaps Diamondic, but the purpose of the Redpill is to deconstruct. Diamonds may have a similar property in taking up other horn as well, and perhaps Diamonds may also have Redpilled elements to them that allow us to shed our perceptions of the noisy chaos to only see what is virtue-theoretically salient.

Plato's Sun is the classic and highest of Diamonds; The Good, the standard through which meaning, value, and order arises, obtains, or illuminates. It makes the world intelligible to us.

I tend to associate this with intersubjective objectivity and internalism of several varieties in metaethics, epistemology, and perhaps metaphysics. 

This is constructive narrative result of virtuously habituated virtue-theoretic non-cognitive fastmind computation. It is much harder to build than it is to destroy. These are models that seem very fit to me.
