title: 2019.11.02 - Wiki Review: Todotoday

* [[2019.09.28 - GB: Moving]]
** I'm glad he got out of there.
* [[2019.10.05 - GB: Superbusy]]
** If I could be guaranteed safe passage out, perfect anonymity, and a safeword to eject, and tools to write (ha)...control-freak, ofc, I would be willing to temporarily reside in an institution. 
* [[2019.10.19 - GB: Hey Man]]
** Always a difficult judgment call to make: who is worth that much commitment? Gonna take a long time to heal from those wounds. Loneliness epidemic.
* [[2019.10.30 - GB: Grinding Diss]]
** I can listen to books while I clean. Just need a way to type effectively. So many ideas for it over the years.
* [[2019.09.16 - JRE: Church of h0p3]]
** My hypothesis is that investment in a child has required him to commit differently with his SO.
* [[2019.09.21 - JRE: I'll Just Embarrass Myself]]
** He knows how to pick them, and I know how to dive in and dive out.
* [[2019.09.26 - JRE: A Hole Is A Hole 2ME]]
** Those links are killing me.
* [[2019.09.29 - JRE: Holy rDPS]]
** He's on the hunt for another game to fill the hole. I hear that.
* [[2019.10.05 - JRE: Gervais WoW]]
** My predictions were solid here.
* [[2019.10.12 - JRE: I Had The Corn Salsa]]
** Nope, we've kinda just dropped off in that respect.
* [[2019.10.19 - JRE: Tidbits]]
** It goes with the other rhyme so nicely. 
* [[2019.10.31 - JRE: Buttdial]]
** Me too. I'm hoping we can unofficially audit classes. Hard to convince lots of professors to allow this.
* [[2019.09.23 - Tasha: Peepers]]
** Kitty kats are kute.
* [[2019.09.24 - Tasha: Making Plans]]
** I hope her life simplifies, normalizes, and that she can see more clearly.
* [[2019.09.28 - Tasha: Neighbors]]
** I'm grateful they planned a party. We had a wonderful time speaking with them. 
* [[2019.10.05 - Tasha: Jack/Tire Iron]]
** She has a difficult relationship with her mother. I did my best to not make her life any harder than it already was. Yikes.
* [[2019.10.19 - Tasha: I Surrender]]
** Ah, spelling. So many mistakes on my part. =)
* [[2019.10.24 - Tasha: New Master]]
** Must be ridiculously painful. Rethinking what it was, reliving with a new lens. Horrifying.
* [[2019.10.31 - Tasha: Get Together & Talk]]
** My Marx costume is not bad.
* [[2019.09.17 - AA: Preferred Slope]]
** I've not asked her much about her classes lately.
* [[2019.09.23 - AA: Focusing On Work]]
** There are days when I really don't like my offspring, but overall, I do. Gonna be hard if and when they decide to leave.
* [[2019.09.24 - AA: Moth 2 A Flame]]
** She credits me too far here. She has always been interested in learning and teaching, imho. That's why I asked her to join me.
* [[2019.09.28 - AA: Soothing Deathstar]]
** Aim for having no breaks in parenting or friendships too.
* [[2019.10.02 - AA: Flying]]
** I hope that figure holds, lol! Would be nice.
* [[2019.10.05 - AA: Chili & Geschwind]]
** It's expensive to speak with me here.
* [[2019.10.09 - AA: Pale Bloodsuckers Unite!]]
** Ultimately, one of the reasons I prefer the night is that there's no one else there.
* [[2019.10.15 - AA: Moderation Analysis]]
** I wonder if and when I'll yearn for that delicious crack again.
* [[2019.10.18 - AA: Scattering Squirrels]]
** It is easier for me to put myself in her living room than with most.
* [[2019.10.21 - AA: Check-in Chatter]]
** That is ridiculously hard to do. I'm glad it's working for her. She's been making a lot of good moves this year.
* [[2019.10.16 - L: Freedom While Boss MIA]]
** Many of my relationships become this circle rather than a spiral. 
* [[2019.09.24 - L: Sane Optimism]]
** Alright, so does he share looking when she realizes what's ahead here? Will she continue after the whirlwind?
* [[2019.09.28 - L: Co-dependent Trolling]]
** Spicy? More like and love distinctions.
* [[2019.10.05 - L: Distraction From Woe]]
** It's interesting to see my son making inferences on timestamps. This is an ugly part of learning for an autist.
* [[2019.10.16 - L: Healthy, I'm Just Gonna Do Me]]
** She needs a better desk maybe. My complete forearms lay on the desk, and it helps. Might help for her, I don't know.
* [[2019.10.21 - L: Escape]]
** I have been here multiple times.
* [[2019.10.18 - gh057: Break]]
** I'm honored that he would join me on a tool like Signal.
* [[2019.10.27 - gh057: Relaxing Music]]
** Reminds me of swapping memes.
* [[2019.10.18 - K: Bunny Passion]]
** I'm glad it turned out to be a bunny class for him. I hope it's something he finds worthy of reflection.
* [[2019.10.23 - K: Shit Weekend]]
** I'm grateful that he knows how much I want to connect with him and takes it seriously. I hope I can be a useful friend to him (clearly, rarely my skill...which sucks, cause I realize that's my job, lol; why isn't it my purpose to master vidja games?).
* [[2019.09.30 - K: Trudge & Flounder]]
** I don't have enough people in the world who will talk about stick balls with me. I'm a simple man. If I can't talk about my laughably grotesque balls with you, it's gonna be hard to get to know me.<<ref "s">>
* [[2019.10.02 - K: Hydroflasks]]
** Wide range of temps this month. He talks about the weather with me, which is normally a [[smalltalk]] sign. It's not like we go deep often or far, but I think we have the chance to develop a lifelong friendship.
* [[2019.10.04 - K: Input Devices]]
** This is fun. I wish he enjoyed geeking out more on this front. I wonder if that will change.
* [[2019.10.09 - K: Renfaire]]
** I'm so glad to be done with WoW. I had an amazing time, but it's good to get out of that experience machine trap. I hope I avoid playing another one for a couple years. `/beg`
*** I still want to try FFXIV with them.
* [[2019.10.13 - K: Instrumentality]]
** I do not understand why people enjoy the faire, but I also don't spend money like that.
* [[2019.10.14 - K: Work & Play]]
** Sounds like the professor has a single point of view about the book she wants you to push. Good thing I agree with it!
* [[2019.10.18 - K: Surprise Prezi]]
** And, yet, you are taking fucking forever on [[DeathOfRobinhood]]'s letter. Must be silly to him. I'm sure he has figured out how to overcome whatever elements of perfectionism may be in him.
* [[2019.10.21 - K: Pinned Party]]
** He would hate having me as a player. Lol. I'll be annoyed by injustice in caprice (which I think most people cannot pick out well enough) of everyone (which isn't to say there's not plenty in me). I won't take too much of it seriously. I've never played along in people's individual and collective self-described narratives in a pleasing way (though I try to be useful).
* [[2019.10.22 - K: Thanks, I Hate It]]
** I have no idea where he is going after school. Safe plan is teaching, and he's been headed there for a while. Shame he didn't go for the minor in math. Hopefully, the masters will be paid for.
* [[2019.11.01 - Afterschool Teaching: Letting Them Know]]
** Edited. I'm sure I'll say it many times: it's a surreal experience leaving any teaching position. I'm bound to these homo sapiens.
* [[2019.10.23 - K: Million Things]]
** This is one point that I get to share with him that I don't with almost any other male: he [[love]]s his family in a hardcore fashion. Oldest boy taking care of his families.
* [[2019.10.27 - K: Precious Spacetime]]
** I must strike him as a contradiction here.
* [[2019.10.28 - K: Totally Get It]]
** Glad I said it. Been looking for a chance to say it since I met him.
* [[2019.10.31 - K: Wet & Rainy]]
** No kids in his building? That is weird. Says something about the demographics.
* [[2019.09.16 - T-Money: Season Of Life]]
** I realize writing letters is ridiculously expensive. It's gotta be something which I don't put time limits on. 
*** What may be the RPed brawling, gut, jester, absurd, and pointed moves [[kicks]] has been making are especially interesting. Been thinking about it with my wife quite a bit. 
* [[2019.09.21 - T-Money: Redneck Hacker]]
** Had an old neighbor in E-town who fixed up all sorts of things. Not a great dude, but he wasn't boring.
* [[2019.09.28 - T-Money: Again, In Your Honor]]
** I did eventually get to the chelada. Not as bad as the last time, but still not for me.
* [[2019.09.30 - T-Money: Turned Down]]
** That sucks. I desperately wish they could do UPS or something like that.
* [[2019.10.01 - T-Money: 100% By Myself]]
** I miss sarcasm all the time. 
* [[2019.10.05 - T-Money: Lake Michigan]]
** I hope they'll find a way for him not to be commuting that much day. 
* [[2019.10.11 - T-Money: Waterheater]]
** Indeed, I am glad that I rent in these cases. Still, there's is plenty of safety built into what he has.
* [[2019.10.18 - T-Money: You Still Up?]]
** I have no idea how to be helpful enough to him here. I'm significantly limited. I think talking with his wife probably as much as possible is his best chance to build the relationship.
* [[2019.10.22 - T-Money: Fisherman]]
** I hope fishing will be a chance for him to be reflective.
* [[2019.10.27 - T-Money: Scooter]]
** Reminds me of my neighbor in E-town.
* [[2019.11.01 - Computer Musings: FF Safemode]]
** FFDE has all the same, except the session.
* [[2019.10 - Wiki Review]]
** Ditto
* [[2019.10 - TDL]]
** Ditto
* [[2019.10 - Prompted Introspection]]

* [[2019.10 - Family Log]]

* [[2019.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis]]
** I need to get to work on this.
* [[2019.10 - Afterschool Teaching]]
** It's what I aim todotoday.
* [[2019.11.01 - Wiki Review: Roy]]
** Again, wildly overambitious.
* [[2019.11.01 - TDL: Bliss]]
** Looks like you will have all of it left to do. Been a while since you did that.
* [[2019.11.01 - Prompted Introspection: Keanu]]
** Edited. Yeah, that one requires more inspection.
* [[2019.11.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Busy]]
** Completed. I didn't get nearly as much done as I'd have liked.
* [[2019.11.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Guilty]]
** Completed. Yikes. I keep messing this up.
