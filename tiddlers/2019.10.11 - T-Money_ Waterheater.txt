This is a gauge I use to check the water pressure at my home. Normal pressure is 40-45

Tuesday the water company worked on an existing line across the street. Low and behold I go down stairs to check who's truck it was and my water heater had saturated my floor.
OCT 11 9:38 PM
Water heater is only 2.5 years old. So I call plumbing supply. They tell me to call the mfg. I call them and amazing, it is under warranty.
OCT 11 9:39 PM
I take the day off work and change out my water heater.
OCT 11 9:39 PM
The cost of the heater is free bust since I am originally installer I have to do it again according to warranty.

After instalation I notice water in the pan under the heater. I leaked checked everything. Used pipe joint Co.pound, I am very Confidemt.

It appears that the work the water company did changed the local pressure and now my pressure reducing value which is over 30 years old. Cannot keep up.
OCT 11 9:42 PM
So I got a changed a water heater for free but for no reason. The leak was coming from the temp and pressure relief valve on the water heater tank.
OCT 11 9:43 PM
So not have a trash can under the T&P valve and I am not confident that local hardware stores will carry the fittings for the 30+ year old pressure reducing value.
