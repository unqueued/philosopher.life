title: 2017.11.05 -- Retired: To-Do-List Log

!! About:

Perhaps I should track them here. They are the kinds of objects I should build when necessary. Having a place to go to is worth it. Make it easy on yourself, and make it a habit. Should be an easy copy and paste for [[Carpe Diem Log]] as well. This is currently wielded on a weekly basis, but it obviously doesn't have to be. Go with flow and learn to use this tool wisely!

!! Principles:

* Work on least fun to most fun when possible. Do the hardest lifting first, and as your emotional muscles weaken, your tasks get easier and easier. 
* Don't expect yourself to complete everything. You aren't perfect. Prioritize and triage.
** Eventually, you'll acquire the skill of knowing what you can expect of yourself and improve from there.
