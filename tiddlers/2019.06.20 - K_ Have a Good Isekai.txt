Doing well enough. Doing a second pass on the Music: Library. It continues to be shaped. Dialectures with the offspring. We are working on contemporary concentration camps in the US and conceptual analysis of this list https://philosopher.life/#Super%20Thinking%3A%20The%20Big%20Book%20of%20Mental%20Models.
