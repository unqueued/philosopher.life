title: 2019.12.29 - Prompted Introspection: First Day O'School

!! How do you feel on the first day of school?

I agree to my analysis in [[2018.02.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: First Day of School]]. I'd rather focus on the present than the past this round. 

There are so many kinds of schools. It's also difficult not to see myself as always being in school, but I'll agree every day, to some [[dok]], is a new day (and perhaps always a quasi first day of school). Engaging in new (or clarified) schools of thought is generally my favorite "first day" class, but my emotions can vary wildly. Sometimes it is pure horror, and sometimes pure bliss (and everywhere in between). I never feel like I am learning all alone (even if I'm in a room alone reading), but the social aspects of school, including various first day considerations, vary a ton as well. Ugh. I don't have a satisfyingly specific answer.
