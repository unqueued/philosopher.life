title: 2018.02.07 -- Computer Musings: Seedbox Redeux

I'm having serious troubles with Deluge, and I don't know why. I'm going to setup the seedbox again from scratch. It shouldn't take long now that I've got my recipe: [[Recipe: Kimsufi Arch Seedbox Setup]]. I'm done fooling with it. I'm pretty sure I know what I want now, so it shouldn't take long.
