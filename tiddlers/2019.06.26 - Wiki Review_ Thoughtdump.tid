title: 2019.06.26 - Wiki Review: Thoughtdump

** It kills me to see [[AIR]] isolated and falling. He doesn't want us, and there's not much I can do otherwise.
** It's interesting to see [[JRE]] lost his address. It might not matter; I'm convinced it won't be his address for long.

** There's a bunch which belong here. I guess I'll get around to it when I do.

** Nope. That's stupid.
