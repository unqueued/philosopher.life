It seems like [[K]] and I both slept so well over the weekend, then Sunday evening rolls around and we’re tossing and turning. Yeesh.

There's gotta be a name for that phenomenon. The anxiety of trying to fall asleep when you starting the work week up again.
MAY 6 9:59 AM
I miss sleeping like a kid so much.
MAY 6 10:00 AM
Don't forget that not sleeping is bad for you as you try to fall asleep, thinking about it will lower your anxiety, help you bust out of the thought-loop, and enable you to fall asleep faster, lol.

Sorry, had a long string of meetings. I assume that last bit was sarcasm because the more I think about how much I need to sleep the more anxious I get lol
MAY 6 1:51 PM
Oh, more absurd than sarcasm, I hope.
MAY 6 1:52 PM
Trying to be ironic while being empathic. I know the pain of not being able to sleep quite well.
MAY 6 1:52 PM
That works hehe. Honestly I find that if I just take my sleep patterns as they come instead of freaking out they tend to even out.
