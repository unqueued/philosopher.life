My [[Remembrall]] is an odd thing to use. [[Phenomenologically]], I jump down to whatever interests me like I'm [[hyperread]]ing. That's not what I'm supposed to do. I also don't like the lag. =/

Bob does not handle massive edits and additions through any tool well, Commander included. I just lost a bunch of small things over a good number of old tiddlers. We're going to have to think how to do this safely with QA. Kill BoB, boot it back, make changes, kill if necessary, repeat, etc., and then check? Perhaps such edits should just happen in singlefile and get loaded back into Bob. That might be a radically better idea.

Stopping at [[2018.02.04 - Weekly To-Do-List Log: On the Road]]. No functioning process, lost work, and I'm sick. Fuck it.
