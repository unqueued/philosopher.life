title: 2018.03.22 - Prompted Introspection Log: Admirable External Characteristic

!! Tell about a characteristic in others you admire?

Goodness. Righteousness. Justified-ication. Soundly Applied Wisdom in their contexts. People don't do their best; I see what is possible for them to infer. Thus, I rarely see it in others, but that's also a reason I don't much admire others. I legitimately believe [[Virtue is Knowledge]], and therefore Vice is a lack of knowledge in a particular way. Vicious people are ignorant, and given how I see how they shape themselves over time, I will also call them maliciously ignorant. Insofar as anyone has choice, I am convinced they choose to be maliciously ignorant qua selfishness in the long-run. Insofar as no one has choice, my prediction models are greatly improved by interpreting people through the selfishness lens, and it serves me best to understand the world is as it is.
