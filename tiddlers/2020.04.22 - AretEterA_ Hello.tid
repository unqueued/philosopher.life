title: 2020.04.22 - AretEterA: Hello

Dear [[AretEterA]],

It's a pleasure to meet you, [[nomad|Find The Others]]. Thank you for [[contact]]ing me. It's a surprise to have people contact me out of the blue; it's usually the other way around.

Your name is striking to me. What does it mean to you, and why do you choose it?

<<<
There's so much to unpack from your Tiddlywiki I don't even know where to begin..
<<<

Aye, lol. I don't know where to begin either often enough. If you need any [[help]], let me know.

<<<
Just want to give you a genuine thanks for the insights I'm sure to gain from diving in to this. Straight up grateful for this gift and I plan/wish to reciprocate some value when my circumstances align, but for now I want you to know that your comment yesterday will (has already) project my life towards a more positive outcome.

For context, I'm in the process of reconstructing myself. So this here if fucking gold! Again, I really appreciate this!

Thank you so much!

You're welcome; it's no problem. That is high praise, and I [[hope]] to live up to it. It's my honor to be useful for what matters most. 

The obligation of [[reconstruction|DOR]] is one of my {[[Axioms]]}, and I know it can be painful (to say the least). Please let me know if I can be of any use to you. I know developing TW and setting up the infrastructure you want around it isn't easy, and it can be disorienting (sometimes joyfully) to write, design, and explore in your own too. Despite heavy use, I am not terribly proficient with this tool, but I am happy to think with you and share what I understand.<<ref "t">> It's a journey.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
