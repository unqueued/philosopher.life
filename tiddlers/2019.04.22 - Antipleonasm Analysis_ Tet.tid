title: 2019.04.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Tet

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The Tet Offensive in January of 1968 [...] made the war unpopular. American corporate elites decided at that point that it just wasn't worth it, it was too costly, let's pull out. So at that time everybody became an opponent of the war because the orders from on high were that you were supposed to be opposed to it. And after that every single memoirist radically changed their story about what had happened. They all concocted this story that their hero, John F. Kennedy, was really planning to pull out of this unpopular war before he was killed and then Johnson changed it. If you look at the earlier memoirs, not a hint, I mean literally.

This is the closest claim to a conspiracy theory cabal (as [[JRE]] would be tempted to call it) I've seen so far. I agree that many incredibly wealthy people have the most influence on going to war, but I do not understand how or why the US stops going to war. I'm not surprised by Kennedy here, and I agree that memoirists and even historians have a realpolitik axe to grind which has more to do with making money than truth-telling to the best of their abilities.

I come from a generation that has never not known war and conflict. It's normalized, embedded in us, passÃ©, and too few actually give a shit or have time to give a shit. Setting aside the impoverished, apathy is reactionary and privilege. I don't work for the 97% I despise; I'm working for the 3% who merit my life.
