[1:32 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Hope you have a great Sunday and family time. :slight_smile:
[5:33 PM]  h0p3: Thank you! :slight_smile:
[5:33 PM]  h0p3: How's your weekend been?

[9:50 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Busy busy with recovery. Haha
[9:50 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Sorry I forgot to respond
[9:52 AM]  h0p3: nah, don't worry. Heard your weekend was kinda rough.
[9:52 AM]  h0p3: You feeling better?
[9:58 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I made it to work. Haha so that’s nice.
[9:59 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: Fuck this medicine. Never again.
[10:00 AM]  h0p3: Shit, dude. I'm sorry!
[10:01 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: It’s all good. Haha. At least now I know for sure.
[10:01 AM]  h0p3: Aye.
[10:02 AM]  h0p3: Still worth hunting. [[k0sh3k]]'s anxiety meds could only be taken for 3 months, but they actually worked. I'm hoping to find something which works for her.
[10:03 AM]  Ardent_Assailant: I think I’ll do my own research too. Maybe consider Therapy in addition to meds.

[12:57 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Hope your daily grind is fruitful and easy to get through :slight_smile:
[3:59 PM]  h0p3: Ha, same to you, homie. :slight_smile:
[3:59 PM]  h0p3: It's going over here.
[3:59 PM]  h0p3: Grinding with the offspring. Been a long one.
[3:59 PM]  h0p3: How about you?
[4:09 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: The journey of getting back to normal continues. Other than that I’m doing better overall.
[9:38 PM]  h0p3: How long you think it will take before you are back to normal?
[9:46 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I’m not sure tbh. The half life for everything is 7-14 days. I’m at 7 now. :/
[9:48 PM]  h0p3: Lexapro took much, much longer.
[9:48 PM]  h0p3: But, lexapro induces dependence.
[9:49 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I just want to feel my penis again. This is exhausting lmao
[9:49 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: My dr wanted to switch me to that.
[9:49 PM]  h0p3: I do not know how it will affect you.
[9:50 PM]  h0p3: I'm blind over here, but I'm hoping you are able to find something which works.
[9:51 PM]  h0p3: Super unfun part. Like, not having a solution makes it even more difficult to find one, to some degree (or in some sense).
[9:52 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Circling back. I heard lexapro can be super addicting.
[9:52 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: That’s the part that scares me.
[9:52 PM]  h0p3: (which isn't to say there is a solution which works)
[9:52 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: Right haha
[9:52 PM]  h0p3: Yes. It causes physical dependence, from what I understand.
[9:52 PM]  h0p3: You should be very careful about taking it. You do not come off it all at once, and you must taper down.
[9:53 PM]  h0p3: I still experienced "static" like shocks (I don't know how to describe it), and I know that sounds crazy.
[9:54 PM]  h0p3: I'm simply unqualified to know what you ought to do here. You are forced to be your own scientist and your own advocate in the health system we have.
[9:55 PM]  h0p3: I admire that you take it so seriously. It's smart. I wish I did it like you have.
[9:57 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: I know that I need to develop healthy ways to cope with anxiety outside of meds, but I do wanna start looking again eventually.
[9:59 PM]  h0p3: To be clear, I do not take any prescribed medication for my anxiety. I agree that the crucial part of anxiety is trying to solve its causes (though, this isn't always possible or as simple as I'd have liked). You thinking about waiting for a while before looking again at meds?
[10:05 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: For sure. After this experience I’m very hesitant to jump back in immediately.
[10:07 PM]  h0p3: Hard problem to weigh. I ended up giving up on it. We'll see, maybe I'll try again sometime. I can appreciate your position greatly. Seems very practical to me.
[10:09 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: My sister in law takes one that she likes a lot. I’ll get the name to you once I see her again.
[10:09 PM]  h0p3: Cool
10:11 PM]  Ardent_Assailant: :slight_smile:
