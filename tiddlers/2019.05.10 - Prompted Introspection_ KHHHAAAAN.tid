!! Who is a person that influenced your life? How?

Gengis Khan. No one is able to calculate how much he has influenced my life since almost all that information is lost to the sands of time. From what I understand, Genghisids comprise 0.5% of the living population. That's a whole bunch of butterfly effects from prolifically shooting loads into twats almost a millennium ago. Obviously, Tem√ºjin grew into a striking figure in the human dialectic well beyond his ability to procreate. He's obviously one of the the reasons I'm writing this entry too, and if he never lived, I wouldn't either (that bastard).
