title: 2017.04.05 - h0p3's Log

I'm going to start using a template in this blog. I can still freewheel it in here, but I also want to systematically and consistently ask myself certain questions. It's key to program yourself on this wiki. [[2017.04.05 - Pipefitting Log]] is the case example for why I need to have another Log. I basically answer the questions from the template there. I need to compartmentalize these logs to maximize signal-to-noise ratio in each of them but to also give me clearer data structures to analyze. This is what [[h0p3's Log]] is meant to be.
