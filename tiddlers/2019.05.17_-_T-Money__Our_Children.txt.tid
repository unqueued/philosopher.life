How are you man?
FRI 8:21 PM
Grinding away on the wiki and life.
FRI 8:44 PM
How about you? How's work and your body?
FRI 8:44 PM
I'm grinding away at trying to make this old body cooperate.
FRI 8:46 PM
`/whip`
FRI 8:46 PM
Pushing and working. Resting and reflecting.
FRI 8:46 PM
Sounds like a solid cycle.
FRI 8:46 PM
Inventing this evening. Very proud of this simple one.

Now I don't have to carry this bitch around anymore. I just ride around with my golf cart. They sell these for 100-500. I didn't spend a dime. Had everything here.
FRI 8:48 PM
Noice.
FRI 8:49 PM
I haven't been to your wiki in a couple of weeks. Since I started back work.
FRI 9:05 PM
It happens.
FRI 9:08 PM
You can use the Wiki Review or The 1000 to catchup.
FRI 9:08 PM
Assuming you wish to use it as a blog.
FRI 9:09 PM
Yeah. I'll catch up. It's just been busy. Now that I'm working again.
FRI 9:11 PM
I love after-school teachings.
FRI 11:13 PM
Lol, Good. =)
FRI 11:13 PM
I suspect that will disappear for summer?
FRI 11:14 PM
Yup.
FRI 11:14 PM
(I feel like, both the way it is written, and the simplicity, I visualize you, in these senerios and with the kids.)
FRI 11:15 PM
Those poor children, lol.
FRI 11:15 PM
We were those poor children too. At one time or another. Maybe not to the same extent. But in a different world, decades ago.
FRI 11:16 PM
Preach.
FRI 11:16 PM
My momma use to drive a school bus, work in the cafeteria, and watress at the waffle house daily. No bullshit.
FRI 11:17 PM
When I was in elementry
FRI 11:18 PM
Catch up on your wiki is. Fun. I missed some of this.
FRI 11:19 PM
Catching *
FRI 11:19 PM
I find the 5 15 after-school intersting. Rarely have you comoar d your own children to those that you mentor and assist and teach.
FRI 11:23 PM
Are we racing to adulthood?
FRI 11:24 PM
I don't mean that malicious.
FRI 11:24 PM
Uh, I'm racing to find my son in the desert.
FRI 11:24 PM
To help him survive.
FRI 11:24 PM
You have never met him, but I think you would understand after having met him.
FRI 11:25 PM
I would say so.
FRI 11:25 PM
My only point of reference is my own child.
FRI 11:25 PM
Who is a stark difference from your after school care or your own children.
FRI 11:26 PM
I desire her to have down time. To have play time. To habe zero responsibility. I get excited to see her play make believe and be a wild child.
FRI 11:27 PM
Aye. I appreciate that.
FRI 11:27 PM
I don't have an autistic son though ( is that correct?)
FRI 11:27 PM
That is true.
FRI 11:27 PM
I also don't struggle with that myself. So, we come far different ends of the spectrum.
FRI 11:28 PM
I aim to create a path for my children which is moral and highly mobile. I work on the assumption I will be dead before they are 25, and further that I will not see them significantly after they are 18. I have less than 1000 days of school left with my daughter.
FRI 11:30 PM
I prepare them for a world of hypercompetition
FRI 11:30 PM
They have no resources, no network, only their wits.
FRI 11:30 PM
I have but one thing I can give them: my understanding of the world.
FRI 11:31 PM
My daughter could marry her way into stability, but I aim to give her the tools to fight however she sees fit.
FRI 11:32 PM
My son will be lucky to survive.
FRI 11:32 PM
They do play, of course. Their schedules are far more relaxed and fluid, they never wait on buses, sit through useless school functions, wait for other children to be quiet. They teach themselves for 6 hours a day, go outside for at least an hour each day, do their chores, and have time to draw, play video games, surf, read, play with the neighborhood kids, wander, goto the playground. They screw around plenty when they should be working too.
FRI 11:35 PM
I think I have a lot in common with Asian Tiger parents. My job is to prepare them for adulthood, one which I now project to be quite difficult.
FRI 11:37 PM
I hope you don't think I am questioning your parenting.
FRI 11:38 PM
I am simply intersted
FRI 11:39 PM
Aye. I'm trying to explain my context for you.
FRI 11:39 PM
Indeed. You did a good job. I see a bigger picture.
FRI 11:39 PM
I watch my own kiddo utilize all of her manipulation skills at school from teachers to aides to after school or the nurse.
FRI 11:40 PM
She is a crafty little bitch.
FRI 11:41 PM
Lol!
FRI 11:41 PM
=)
FRI 11:41 PM
I am proud of that.
FRI 11:41 PM
It is an important skill to manipulate people to your will using your social skills and reading ppl
 Who responds to what.
FRI 11:41 PM
I call her BS all the time. She is just like me. But get away with alot with her mother and school. And blah. Lol
 She isn't lazy though. Works hard to play hard.
