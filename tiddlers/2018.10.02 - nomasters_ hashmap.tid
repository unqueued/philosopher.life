I'll be writing a blog post about it soon, to help give context, reasoning, and example use cases

Did you take any philosophy classes at LSU?
rjrbt
I did not.

I think we missed each other by a few years there.
rjrbt

I just bought the Kindle version of THINKING AND BEING to check it out.

Thanks for sending me that. I will grab a copy too.

I don't know how I came across it, but it looks fascinating.
In other words, logic provides us not with an empirical understanding of how our thinking actually works (that’s the purview of psychology), but with a normative understanding of how thinking should work. There is no “I” in logic.

Kimhi argues that this view is wrong, and that the distinction between psychology and logic has led our understanding of thinking astray. Consider that the following statement does not, according to the standard view, constitute a logical contradiction: “It’s raining, but I don’t believe it’s raining.” Why? Because the first part of the sentence concerns a state of affairs in the world (“it’s raining”), whereas the second part concerns someone’s state of mind (“I don’t believe it’s raining”).
like. I want to read his elaboration on that.

Sounds like a Brandom student to me!
Will have to ILL a copy
rjrbt
haha.

Sounds like his view of agency is going to rely upon coherentism. I will be curious how he handles physiological probabilistic reasoning (where externalists seem to have an initial edge). 
This does look fun! Thank you.

yeah, I was like: there is one other person I know that would find this interesting, i bet.
