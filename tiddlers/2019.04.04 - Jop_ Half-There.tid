I hear so little about them.

Do you have time to talk?
THU 12:46 PM
Just chit chat notthing important. But I guess you are busy right now then no problem.
THU 12:51 PM
Aye. I'm bouncing between a bunch of tasks.

Much easier to type than use voice.

We played some phone tag. She has no idea how our lives are going, despite the chance to try to know. 

She asked for advice on some math curriculum for her kiddos. They are struggling, and no one can help them. I am glad she cares for her children in this way, and I suggested some resources. Neither parent is going to take the time necessary to learn or interact with the children on this matter, but I know they are capable of doing that math.

I spoke with her about my prison guard duties. It made her laugh. She makes several misattribution errors. I continue to patiently explain.

I hear the Asian relationship structures in her words and intentions. I appreciate the value of her pursuit of harmony, but not at the expense of truth. We continue to speak about kindness/[[love]], the notion of identity, the nature of fundamental disagreement, and the meaning of friendship. We have been here many times.

She was only half there because she drove while talking (mostly listening). I appreciate her willingness to attempt. I will continue to reciprocate.

---

I called her up after work to connect again. We talked about our kids. I got to speak with her kiddos. They are seem to be doing well to me. They were quite open, which was surprising to me; normally, they are more shy. 

I'm worried [[Jop]] is being taken for a ride by her prospective employer. =/
