title: 2014.11.07 - Phil of Religion: Teleological

Paley

Stumbling across a stone, we might possibly think the stone had always been there. It wouldn’t be absurd to think it was just randomly there.

If, however, we stumbled across a watch, it would be absurd to think it had always been there, or that it could have randomly been there.

Why should we think that? Why is there a difference between the stone and the rock in our judgment?

The watch is organized, put together, framed. It is intricate, subtle, and complex. The parts fit together. There are reasons it put together like it is. It has a function, an end, and a purpose. The rock, not obviously these things…

Surely the watch is designed! The rock, not so obviously. For us, the watch might not be so amazing. Imagine you found a smart phone or something.

Clearly, the watch had a maker. It is the inevitable inference. Does it have to be? Maybe it is a smart bet!

Paley then offers some answers to a series of objections to the teleological argument:

I.

Even if we had never seen a watch made, or know no one capable of making a watch, or we were ignorant about to make watches, and it was mystery to us, we would surely still believe there was a watch maker.

At the very least, the ignorance may only serve to make us think very highly of the watch-maker (what is the sorcery?).

II.

Even if the watch was perfect, or if it sometimes malfunctioned, we would surely still infer that it had a a design, a function, a telos, and a maker. How else could we say it “malfunctioned” if we didn’t think it had a function?

III.

Even if we were ignorant about certain aspects of the watch, or even if there were superfluous parts that served no purpose (or so it seemed), we would surely make the same inference. There is enough evidence from what we already have that it must be designed. We don’t need to understand all of it.

IV.

Any rational person would deny this was just a random combination of material composition.

Begging the question.

V.

Rational people would not be satisfied by the claim that the watch was the result of natural principles of order. You might think of crystallization, or beautiful waterfalls, hexagonal honey combs having good structural and packing qualities, or sea-creatures with golden ratio shell arrangements.

One might argue these are arranged by natural principles of order. Although, I think Paley would argue otherwise.

VI.

Rational people would not accept that the intricacy of the watch is just an illusion which makes us mistakenly believe it is constructed or designed by a maker.

VII.

Rational people would be surprised to find the watch was the result of the “laws of metallic nature.” Why is this any different from the natural principle argument?

A law presupposes an agent, according to Paley. Thus, there the responsibility for the design still requires a maker or an agent.

VIII.

A rational person would not accept that he knows nothing about the matter and isn’t justified in drawing any conclusions.

Radical skepticism like this might just be begging the question, and should be dismissed by the rational person?

Application:

Sets out the corresponding analogy or argument concerning the world and God, but it is pretty obvious how the two arguments are connected.



Hume

Dialogue. Cleanthes is theologian, opposed by, Demea the orthodox believer and Philo the skeptic.

Cleanthes:

    The universe is like a great machine comprised of smaller machines comprised of smaller machines, and so on.

    This great machine fits together so well. When we contemplate it, we must admire it.

    This great machine to be an extravagant and fantastically designed device similar to the some machines we as humans engineer and produce (only the great machine is truly great).

    By “rules of analogy,” it is clear that if our man-made machines have an author or designer, then surely this great machine, the universe, also has an Author or Designer.

    The world itself is the beginning of this a posteriori proof of God’s existence.

        Again, proof here is such a strong word. A modern teleologist would hardly claim it is proof; merely that it is evidence, a reason for believing.

Demea:

    Can’t agree with Cleanthes.

    This just isn’t a traditional enough argument.

        No demonstration of the “Being of God”

            Might think of Aristotle here.

        No abstract arguments. Apparently too simple.

        No a priori proofs.

            A priori proofs are somehow thought to be higher or better than a posteriori. They are the kinds of proofs that all rational creatures, with or without experience, could realize.

            Surely a good proof of God would be a priori.

        The argument relies upon experience and probabilities; there is too much to doubt.

    This may give advantages to atheists which should never be granted.

Philo:

    We are constantly making a posteriori, experiential inferences.

    Analogical reasoning, however, has problems.

        Having experienced the circulation of blood in humans, we may analogically infer that blood also circulates in frogs and fish, and the other animals.

            This is a strong analogical inference, but still subject to doubt.

        It would be a much weaker analogical inference, however, to claim that because we as humans experience blood circulation that sap circulates in vegetables.

            Experiments may show otherwise.

    If we see a house, we have great reasons to infer there was an architect because we have previous experience concerning the causes and effects of houses.

        We’ve seen enough houses caused by architects that this inference is easy.

    Surely we can’t apply the same reasoning of the house to the universe.

        The analogy just isn’t complete or perfect enough.

            There are so many obvious differences; this just isn’t analogous enough to make the inference

        E.g. We’ve never seen anyone build a universe.

Cleanthes:

    Surely this is more than mere guesswork or conjecture.

    Is the analogy between the house and the universe really so slight?

    Surely the universe is ordered, proportioned, and arranged. A house as well.

    I fear you all have belittled my argument; dismissed it too quickly.

Demea:

    Good God! How could we allow a proof of God to fall short of perfection.

        God’s perfection requires a perfect proof.

    This argument by Cleanthes is nothing more than extravagant opinions.

        By that, I take it he means they aren’t justified.

Philo:

    I’m arguing with Cleanthes on his own grounds. There are dangerous consequences to his argument.

        It should also be more convincing to him.

    You seem to have a real problem with the fact that Cleanthes argument is a posteriori

        Let’s consider Cleanthes argument, to see if he has offered something worthwhile.

        Maybe it isn’t such a bad argument.

    We can’t rely solely upon a priori reasoning, arguments, and belief-formation.

        We just couldn’t understand the universe, or what’s important.

        Since you can always dream up anything, including reasons for things, you wouldn’t have a reason to think there was a particular cause for anything.

        Imagine starting from the a priori, and then opening your eyes to the a posteriori.

            You wouldn’t be able to see or assign the cause of events.

        Anything is possibly the cause from the a priori.

        Only experience can point out the true cause of any phenomenon.

            Although, to be clear: Hume may be a skeptic of causation! This is the character speaking on behalf of Cleanthes.

    Our experience gives us a principle, a principle which tells us that ordered and arranged things generally have a designer.

        This isn’t proof of a designer. This is, however, evidence for a designer.

        It is a justification. The principle makes sense, despite having a posteriori origins.

    E.g. if you throw several pieces of steel together, without shape or form; they will never arrange themselves into a watch.

        That’s what experience tells us.

    Experience “proves” that there is an original principle of order in mind, not in matter.

        From similar effects or cases, we can infer similar causes.

    However, I don’t think this is good reasoning, and I will “defend…the adorable mysteriousness of the Divine nature.”

    Cleanthes is said to assent to Philo’s representation of the argument

    Philo seems to claim that Cleanthes believes “all inferences…concerning fact are founded on experience.”

        This seems to be a stronger claim than what I took Cleanthes to have offered.

        This seems likely false to me: there seem to be a priori inferences.

    Further, Philo claims Cleanthes has argued, “all experimental reasoning are founded on the supposition that similar causes prove similar effects.”

        That might be agreed to.

    Philo warns us that we have to be extremely careful in translating the cause of one case to another similar case.

        How similar must they be?

            If they are basically, exactly the same, well, no problems.

            But, as the similarity drifts, as does the supporting evidence of the principle. The strength of the similarity results in the strength of the inference.

        Differences between cases give us reasons to doubt they have the same kind of causation.

    The problem is that this analogy is too great!

        It is one thing to talk about watches, ships, and houses, and quite another thing to talk about the universe as a whole.

    We might be drawing a conclusion about the parts and applying it to the whole.

        Is that reasonable?

        E.g. from the growth of a hair, as a part, can we learn anything concerning the generation of a man as a whole?

            My gut is to say yes!

        E.g. Would the manner of a leaf’s blowing, even though perfectly known, afford us any instruction concerning the vegetation of the tree?

            Not obviously. This isn’t as directly a parts/whole argument though.

    Even if we granted this parts/whole inference, why should we think the way humans perceive reasons, design, and causation should be the the kinds or principles for inferring the model and cause of the entire universe?

        Cleanthes view is too anthropocentric!

            I sympathize. From a very objective, 3rd-personal, ideal perspective, this seems right.

            I worry this is overly skeptical.

        Well, what other choice do we have?

        Epistemic duty is about doing the best we can with what we have.

            All we have is human reason. We have to make it work.

    Why should we think the rest of the universe is like our little corner of it?

        Maybe the principles are wildly different out there. Maybe causation operates differently.

        We don’t know! This similarity inference just might not work.

        Skeptical claim, and I think that buys us uncertainty and doubt. However, does it provide a great argument against justification?

            Not obviously. In fact, I’d say we might need reasons why we should think it is different.

    It is certain that the liker the effects, the liker the causes which are inferred, and the stronger the argument.

        Anything which isn’t as similar has a lower probability, and renders the inference less likely.

    We can see different scopes of the world; macroscopic and cosmic all the way to microscopic.

        Why should we think these are similar.

        This seems to anticipate, hilariously, a discovering that happened hundreds of years later: quantum mechanics, which really don’t follow causal principles we find on macroscopic scales.

Cleanthes:

    These aren’t real objections; they are only discoveries of new instances of art and contrivance.

        There is still a watch! We might not know how the watch works. But, it still seems to have an intricacy and a causal beauty to it.

Philo:

    Claims Cleanthes must renounce all claim to infinity in any of the attributes of God.

        For, the cause can only be proportioned to the effect. Since the effect isn’t infinite, nor is the cause.

            How do we know the former? Why should we agree?

    If God is finite, then lots of things won’t make sense.

        Can God be morally perfect, omniscient, or omnipotent?

        You’ve made God too human!

    Why should we think the author is that brilliant?

        Maybe he copied someone.

        Maybe he made a bunch of shitty universes and just haphazardly stumbled on this one.

    Why can’t we just think there are a number of deities and demons which made the world? Why must there be One designer.

    How do we explain evil in the universe?

        Surely God wouldn’t have designed that.

    You just don’t know this universe is intricate and ordered, so why should you know there is a designer?



General claims:

    At best, the teleological argument only gets us to an intelligent designer. Why must we agree that designer is God?

        We need another argument to close this gap, much in the same way for the cosmological argument.

    Perhaps there are multiple designers.

    The universe is unique, while the watch isn’t. They aren’t similar enough. The analogy doesn’t hold.

    You can empirically experience the creation of a watch, but you can’t the universe.

    Does the designer need a designer?

        Did someone design God?

        Infinite regress

    All designers we know of are corporeal. Should we infer that God is corporeal?

    How do we know this wasn’t just brought into existence by chance?

    The universe isn’t perfectly designed.
