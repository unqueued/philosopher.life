title: 2017.08.23 - Pipefitting Log

Chris picked me up earlier than usual, and I had to push bricks. I was in a rush. I didn't even brush my teeth or take my vitamins. I did give him $20 for giving me a ride though. We talked about the job mostly on the way. We're still trying to understand the landscape. I take it that most people engage in an activity like this. Let us hope that Chris and I have a significant competitive advantage at it since we need to skyrocket.

I asked Chris-M to sit with us at the table. I'm glad he joined us. He always has valuable information for me. I'm going to learn a ton from him.

We've been given permanent lock-out/tag-out keys for the train-track switch that runs through our primary work area (Area 1, 2, 5). It's a big deal to fuck this up. I'll need to make sure not to forget them. Chris-M says he leaves a "note" for himself. Imho, this is like having a personal lock-out/tag-out for yourself, to remember to do your other lock-out/tag-out duties. I think it is interesting, if maybe redundant (but maybe redundancy is not a bad idea at all). 

Dave (David-M) said to us was obviously running around crazy this morning. He did have the time to quickly walk us through the drawings. I intend to study them. We still don't have access yet, but Dave continues to promise we will get it. I'm trying to understand why he doesn't follow through.

We went on to finish the work from yesterday. I drove the lift. Chris-M asked if I felt comfortable. We discussed what that meant, and I told him I wasn't sure basically. I've used them, but that doesn't mean I'm good with them. He let me do it anyways. I did fine. We didn't have a hot work permit, so we had to use the sawzall and portaband. The bolts couldn't be touched by my wrenches, so we cut those as well. We'd get halfway through and then wrench them off. This still didn't work. We had to pry. Luckily, I had 2 pry bars and the motha' fuckin' cold chisel was the absolute bomb. Multiple times I would ask if we should switch to another tool I had ready, and my journeyman would think for a second and say, "yeah, good idea." In the end, he complimented my cold chisel. I drove the scissor lift back and put my tools away. 

Break!

We didn't do much. I helped the riggers and ironworkers mount a support tower. Chad is one of the foremen. A true asshole among assholes, but I can handle him.

I found the book sitting and grabbed it to interpret what we needed to do next. The drawings were very sparse. They didn't have nearly as much information as I was hoping they would have. We were also missing some. I noticed the ironworkers had a set we didn't have access to. It was good to see what it actually was going to look like between 234 and 291. I have a clearer understanding of it. I wish I had these drawings from the beginning. They aren't perfect, but they are far better than nothing. 

Foreman, apparently, sometimes withhold information. Dave says that's not the kind of foreman he is. I believe him for now, yet I am completed confused as to why he hasn't simply given us copies. Given the amount of time he has spent talking about making copies, he could have just made the fucking copies. 

Dave gave the Chris-M and I (and John) an actual pipefitter assignment. We are rerouting a drainage pipe out of the way of where giant support will be mounted to a 2'-by-2' column. I helped take measurements and draw lines. Chris-M is doing most of the work though. I'm not sure how to insert myself politely and make sure I'm learning it all. I'm doing my best to learn without being rude. I believe I shouldn't be too passive though.

Lunch!

We sat around taking measurements. /yawn - It simply doesn't take 4 people to do this aspect. 2 would have sufficed.

Dave came to grab some help, and Chris and I volunteered. It was a very neat process. We marked the pipes and compared the spool sheets to the isometric sheets. We marked the cardinal directions the pipe should be facing and flagged them yellow or red (with caution/barricade tape) for the riggers to know which needed to be moved first and to know which position in which to lay them, etc. This process strongly reminded me of the process I used in the shop, wherein I marked all my pipes and lined them up for assembly. Of course, in this case, we couldn't line them up. They are huge fucking lengths of pipe, and we were basically balancing on them like we were on some giant industrial jungle gym.

Break!

We got stuff set up for the PVC run. Not much otherwise though. I put stuff away and put my lockout-tagout gear in my box. 

Also, my wife lovingly brought the wraparound and paperwork to Tim today for me.
