title: 2019.12.18 - TDL: Celebration With Neighbors

* Living Room, Kitchen, Bathrooms
** Limited, but every ounce counts.
* More Project Ascension for le offspring. 
** Helluva metaphor. Dialectures and fun.
* Pizza, beer, burger for wife
* Party with neighbors
** Maybe some board games? Or, just talk. 
* Continue to encourage keeping a list for modeling during [[Family Time]]
* I'd like to see some writing done tomorrow.
