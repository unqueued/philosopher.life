* Instead of delivering dreams, politicians now promise to protect us from nightmares.
* Those with the darkest nightmares became the most powerful.
* It was a fantasy politically expedient to sell.
* Precautionary Principle shaped society
* HOLY FUCK, LEO STRAUSS!!
** I think Strauss' interpretation style is absolutely crucial, paranoically charitable, and necessary to doing philosophy well. His influence on conservatives is relevant. Those in desperate need for X (whatever that may be) turn to Straussian hermeneutical methodologies.
** It is interesting to see how Neo-conservativism and Classic Liberalism are peeled apart here. I think Curtis made a mistake here. I am convinced the Libertarian memeplex is addictive, and I take it to actually be a driving force in Neoconservatism. Neocons injected themselves into Conservativism and subverted those masses (not that Conservatives were actually that far away the Libertarian memeplex in the first place). In fact, what makes them effective is they embrace Redpilled descriptions combined with psychopathic prescription.
** I want to point out that Straussian interpretation is not conceptually bound to making this move. One of my teachers went a very different route, for example. I am part of the Straussian lineage.
** Interesting mythology and pursuit of certainty. I worry, of course, that we are obligated to be Straussian as a matter of intellectual honesty, even if it produces implausible appearing explanations. That's the nature of the Redpill. 
** It seem to me that Straussian's are Redpilled descriptively, but their prescriptions can vary considerably.
* The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
* In a society that believes in nothing, fear becomes the only agenda. And a society that believes in nothing is particular frightened by people who believe in anything.
* It's a provacative walk through deception, perception shaping, and the distortion of the Great Human Conversation. I don't agree with it all, but the kernel is correct.
