title: 2018.05.26 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Humans in Medical Research

!! How do you feel about using humans in medical research?

That was should do so wisely. Exactly what that entails in complex. For example, I think informed consent is a conceptual quagmire in metaethics. The whole system is ugly as fuck, to tell the truth. Until we make progress in the Epistemology being primitive to Ontology debate, I worry we can't clean up a whole bunch of these issues. I can't answer the questions. I can only give you my best guess or multiple options.

While I used to be staunchly pro-life (pacifist, etc.), at this point, I'm far less so. Finding a way to decentralize power and remove political and economic gain from this research is absolutely necessary. I suggest that socialism has to be instituted before we can reliably and meaningfully talk about many forms of this research. 

Obviously, we have to use humans in research. How else can we learn?
