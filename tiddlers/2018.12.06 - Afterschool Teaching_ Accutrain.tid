title: 2018.12.06 - Afterschool Teaching: Accutrain

Accutrain testing completed. It reminds me of the technical school. I can see why people hate school when the entire system is built like this. I  zipped up the certificate (html files and directories) and sent it to Sonya. I will see her on Saturday at 9 for First Aid training. Tomorrow, I see Delp at 3.
