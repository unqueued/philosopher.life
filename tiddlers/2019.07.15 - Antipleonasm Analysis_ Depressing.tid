This is depressing. Even when he isn't exacting in his codification, the spirit of his claim is timeless. I hear echoes of Plato and Aristotle [[antipleonasmified]] in these aphorisms.<<ref "g">> The Ten Commandments scream out at me as well. I'm never going to write as poignantly as Voltaire. It's hard not to see Enlightenment as being every bit as radical as human behavioral modernity in the evolution of our political discourse, our dialectics, and [[The Great Human Conversation]].
