title: 2020.03.26 - Prompted Introspection: Being A Better Friend

!! In what ways do you wish you were a better friend? Why do you find yourself unable or unwilling to do so?

I'm modifying the question from [[2018.06.18 - Prompted Introspection: Being a Better Friend]]. The answer is still correct. I'm not good at being relaxed, easy-going, low-friction, recognizably polite, acceptably civil, peaceful, and someone people enjoy hanging out with. I talk too much (I have a tendency to dominate in conversations if I don't pull back extremely far), and I'm preoccupied with particular concerns in a looping and rabbitholing manner that most of my friends are not going to be interested in engaging in to the same degree. 

I wish I could find a way to be interested in what other people find interesting in the manner in which they find it interesting (this was the exact problem I had in academic circles that stopped being real classrooms too). What I find interesting about it is not interesting enough for us both, or there are gaps that I don't know how to fill and dots to connect that reach too far. Further, it's not that I'm not curious (far from it, I suggest), but I have a narrow conception of what merits my curiosity. I find myself lacking rational reasons to push in other directions. As absurd as it sounds, I also feel the weight of the world in a way that I don't think most do; I have obligations to push in some directions as well. I'm too goal-directed for most.

Passive engagement is far easier here. Finding active ways to [[salient]]ly participate in the lives of my friends is hard to do well. In a way, I have to not be myself, and I think I should do that to some extent. That's part of constructing myself with [[The Other]].
