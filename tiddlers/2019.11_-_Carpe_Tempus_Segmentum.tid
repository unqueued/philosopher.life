!! Audit:

* Your daughter has been exceptionally emotional. Much higher than usual.
** I mean, terrible inferences. That's not like her. Dat 13yo limbic system is pure juice. Blame the hormones, yeah, okay. She's moving too.
*** Naw, she's crazy fucking sane compared to the other 13yo girls I know. It's also a good thing that she doesn't have too flat an affect. Look, this is part of the price of fighting anhedonia in her. We have to curb and channel the acid and deadly lasers tho, [[JHBFC]].
**** She is incredibly thoughtful (piercingly empathic, I've never witnessed anything like it from someone her age...even at 6); she just so profoundly knows how fucked the world really is at such a young age. Your fault, not hers.
***** She's a genius interpreter who doesn't write, and that's your fault too. Caught between worlds, it's impossible to pick up that many pieces.
* Spoon mood. Skin hunger. You aren't having enough sex (though, interestingly, your libido is down).
* We are the worst family to watch a video on YT, show, or a movie with. We're constantly pausing to talk. I'm hoping that will develop into a more useful habit in the 21st century. 
** It's just not rude when the whole point is to share the story together, to bind ourselves with a narrative or idea. It's a springboard. The experience is with the people in the room, not merely of the vidya.
*** Where else do you get to "pause the world" to do this? When we read together (and you're reading wrong if you don't).
* We've watched a FUCKTON of vidya.
** Lots of cannabliss too.
* You have failed to complete your logs multiple times this month.
** It's also been quite busy, lots of changes.
* As usual, this is a catchall. Glad to have it.
