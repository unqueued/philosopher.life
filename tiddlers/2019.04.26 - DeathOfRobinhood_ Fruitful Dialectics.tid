Welcome, please come in and make yourself at home. From the looks of it, you have traveled far to come here. Thank you for {[[speaking with me|Contact]]}, and please let me know if I can {[[help]]} you.

Hi h0p3,

I'm the guy on Reddit who linked to the Christian Thinktank.
<<<

I'm glad you did too. [[That|https://christianthinktank.com]] is a fascinating rabbithole. I don't have nearly enough examples of work like my own to explore and reason about. How'd you come across it? Do you have any more I could see? What do you like to read? If you feel comfortable, tell me about yourself.

<<<
Your wiki was disorienting at first, but became more agreeable once I just picked a spot and continued to read in the direction my inclinations lay, without worrying about the threads I didn't follow.
<<<

I'm sorry my wiki is so disorienting. If it's any consolation (probably not), it's also disorienting for me in many regards (as stupid as that sounds), and that is likely, in no small part, my fault. 

It's fascinating to hear how you come to find it more agreeable. I never understand enough about this hyperobject myself, and I'm grateful for your fresh perspective. I do not know the best way to read or write this wiki in most contexts, including both of ours.

As always, I'm curious to know which threads in the rhizome tickled your fancy and why.

<<<
Still pretty early in my exploring. You lay out your being in such a naked fashion it seems almost rude to examine and comment upon your content directly (though it certainly doesn't help that I'm not familiar with a muchof the literary and philosophical references you make!) Much easier to consider form (and I find your form super intriguing) atm.
<<<

Thank you for your consideration; I was [[naked]], and you clothed me. I'm a madman out here in the desert. I don't think they care for the ravings of a lunatic in the city limits. Examine and comment away; it's as human as I can make it. Hopefully, my e-penis won't gross you out; please feel free to laugh. I will be indebted to your feedback, weaving, plucking logs out of my eyes, and realtalk.

<<<
In the interest of transparency, as I stated in the SSC Reddit, I'm pretty inseparable from my underlying proselytic motivations, although I consider exchanging ideas honestly with someone a rewarding end in itself (is this an untrue cliché? I take it you'd conceive of this 'exchange of ideas' as a means to an infinitely higher end, that is, the Good, at least as far as that can be exemplified in human personalities, which, I suppose, would make you a more earnest proselytizer than me!)
<<<

I applaud your transparency. Honesty, in its various [[dok]], is an important sign to me.

I was surprised to find you in [[/r/SSC|http://reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/]]. It is a den of evil.<<ref "k">> There are many thieves, tax collectors, reactionaries, Sadducees, and Pharisees among them. I admire how you sup with and learn from unrepentant sinners who aim to centralize power into the hands of the few; with hardened hearts, they construct a Tower of Babel. However unlikely, I hope you succeed in converting them to follow Christ all the way down.

I adore that you are a man of {[[principle]]} and conviction. You are clearly someone with a purpose. I do not often meet many strangers in the desert truly stamped with your image these days. I hold justified [[faith]] in high regard, and your integrity and courage to stand up for what you believe is universally greater than all of us is, at the very least, [[beautiful]] to me.

Peace be with you; I serve [[The Good]].<<ref "g">> Or, I try to serve [[The Good]] (perhaps mostly as an arrogant fool, as you can see).<<ref "m">> I come from a zealous Christian background, so please feel comfortable speaking with as much depth as you wish about your belief and desire structures. I have served and wrestled many angels, nomad, and I will do my best to understand you. I suggest we have a great deal in common, sir. I am not a Christian primarily because, while I believe in the divine, I will not anthropomorphize or Daseinomorphize the transcendent one iota more than is necessary (if I can help it). 

While I deny some of the standard orthodox fundamentals of most self-described Christian sects through history, I think you will also find many of my core beliefs may be a valuable subset of yours. My understanding of [[The Good]], to my poor knowledge, is compatible with the historical, syncretized, and evolving (or, more charitably, the progressively revealed) Abrahamic God memeplex.

Make no mistake: we are both accountable in this space, and I will hold you to your proselytizing, nomad.<<ref "j">> So when you do, strike true, and be prepared to go down the rabbithole with me. I do not meet many Christians who withstand my scrutiny (maybe 1-3%).<<ref "10">> [[My wife|k0sh3k]] is one of them. I think you would enjoy her company a great deal. 

I am grateful to you for taking the time to speak with me. Indeed, man cannot live on bread alone. Even in fundamental disagreement, our conversation is a sacrament. The dialectical exchange of ideas [[irwartfrr]] is the first step to [[building Heaven on Earth|The Original Position]]. Our exchange here is a matter of both faith and works; I could only [[hope]] to be an instrument of and for the divine.

<<<
You write about some reaching out to you with an aim to co-operate, or else, to seek help. Do you get many people reaching out with the aim of 'helping' you?
<<<

I beg you cite where I wrote this. I agree that several people write to me in the spirit of cooperation, some seek my help, and some both or neither. I feel like I speak with all kinds of people in the desert. I aim to serve what matters most, nomad.

I wouldn't say I get many people who reach out to me in the first place (I'm kind of a hermit wandering the desert), but a surprising percentage of them aim to help me. [[Sphygmus]] and [[kickscondor]] are clear examples of people who have gracefully gone well beyond the call of duty to help me.

<<<
Speaking of which, I found a dead link. Hypertext for the 'The Golden Rule' in the entry for 'The Right' leads to an error.
<<<

What you experienced isn't a dead link, though it certainly appears to function like one. At some point, I changed my mind and [[alias]]ed [[The Golden Rule]] to [[The Right]]. Forgive my mess, please. I'm sorry for the lack of clarity. Further, I despise that the most important terms on my wiki have not been carefully defined. I beg you for time. I have much to say about the topic, if you wish to look. There are currently about 2500 matches to "[[The Right]]" (not counting synonyms and implications) in the wiki, but not as many referencing links. Part of the meanings of my words are in virtue of how I use them throughout the wiki.

Part of me has been concerned [[The Golden Rule]] and [[The Right]] might need to be peeled apart, but I'm not convinced I must anymore. Insofar as they might be different (and I do not yet claim that is the case), [[The Right]] sublates [[The Golden Rule]]. There may be a very deep problem to solve in distinguishing obligations to [[The Good]] (traditionally, the greatest commandment) from obligations to [[Others]] (the second greatest). I am in no position to answer it to my satisfaction, nomad. Saint Kierkegaard and I continue to [[Straussian]]ly wrestle on the issue.

<<<
Thanks for this experimental space you've created. May your labour be fruitful.
<<<

Thank you for thinking about this [[model|IATVMOASRM]] with me. I adore your focus on fruit rather than mere gifts.

<<<
Peace, and Eagerly awaiting a response,

Ivan
<<<

I am, of course, interested in [[names|Anomianisms]]. Please tell me about yours. I eagerly await your response as well, and I'm hoping to learn what kind of relationship you might like to build together.<<ref "r">> Please take as long as you need to respond.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
