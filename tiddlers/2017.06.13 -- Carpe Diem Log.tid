title: 2017.06.13 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up early, but went back to bed. Alarm clock woke me up afterwards.
* I woke the kids up and got them started.
* I worked hard and tried to progress outside of classwork itself in several ways. I'm proud of that.
* I spoke with my family at lunch, and I was interrupted by Luke. I did find the address to visit Jacobs though.
** I also wrote my cheatsheet. 
* I worked hard again.
* I visited Randy.
* I visited Eastman, but it was a failure.
* I listened to Sessions obstruct justice for over an hour. I will never give up.
* I got home at the same time as my wife, and we found that my children didn't do their work. We had a tough talk, again.
* I had some fireman time.
* I made Indian food for dinner.
* My son didn't want my help for dishes =(.
* I've sent the kids to do their logs before bed
* I'm having a drink tonight. I'll probably watch some videos before I sleep.
* Honestly, it has been fairly chill, except for my children.
