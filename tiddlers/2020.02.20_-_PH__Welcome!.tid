Dear [[PH]], 

<<<
Hey, I'm really happy to hear from you. 

I've been sitting on a draft of this email all day, lol. I've no idea how to kick this off.
<<<

It's great to [[hear|Contact]] from you too, \o/. I think you just [[kick|kickscondor]]ed it off! 

<<<
I'm not entirely sure what to make of the link you sent me, is this some sort of blog?
<<<

I'm not entirely sure what to make of the [[link|Links]] I sent you either. I'm sorry. I'm a [[lunatic|Why You Might Hate Me]] out here in the open desert. Even most lunatics think I've an extra measure lunacy.<<ref "o">> 

It's important that you read or at least gloss through the [[Readme]] I sent you. Take your time, please, no rush.<<ref "r">> I write out in the open, [[ITS]]. I think it can be [[common sense]] (and arguably far more justified than that) to [[connect|Connect]] pseudonymously (and honestly); I rarely offer [[privacy]] or anonymity.<<ref "i">> I talk with a number of [[people|FTO]] over my wiki.<<ref "m">> Some of my [[hyperconversation]]s are extremely long, layered, and distributed in the wiki, joyfully growing and spilling over into [[offline|Offline Users]] experience as well.

This wiki is my mere heap of [[public self-representation|PSM]].<<ref "c">> I'm a madman in the desert, sir. Even though it's hard to read (I'm sorry), it is an important object for getting to know me and for me to express myself. You don't have to have a personal site to speak with me (most don't), but some find it useful. 

There's something wrong about the interwebs and in the postmodernized world at large. We aren't connecting as ourselves terribly well. Building deep friendships and [[intimacy|Fostering Intimacy]] is expensive for a number of reasons. Loneliness sucks. I'm doing what I can to fix that.  

In case we need some [[can-openers|Prompted Introspection]] here:

{{Getting to Know Someone in X Questions}}

I'm a flood of thought, so you'll have to pick out what is [[salient]] in the stream (if anything, lol) and narrow the conversation with me.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
