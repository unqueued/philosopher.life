title: 2018.07.02 -- To My One: ðŸ’”

While I cannot recall the explicit words, I am quite sure I committed myself many times to the two claims:

# To grow as a Christian with you.
# To teach our children to be Christians.

This much is clear: we are in Parfit's territory. I cannot resolve the problem (and I'm not convinced any philosopher can; identity is a matter of faith itself). I offered you a way out several years ago; please, consider it a standing offer. I mean no ill-will by it, and it's not what I want, as you know. 

I see this as an admittance of my failure to be able to uphold my own commitments in this case, to foresee who a 19-year-old autistic manchild would become after 13 years of toil in ripping off the gaslit-veil. I have made it abundantly clear that my faith took me away from my faith. The thing which you hold at the center of your identity I have done my best to compatibilize myself with...and I would argue you've done the same for me.

Yet, you are alone in your desire to raise Christian children and to grow as a Christian. I am radically opposed to it, and I've tried to be clear about my goals (knowing I fail often). What is left of God for me is divorced from most of the Christian tradition, scripture, and community. Christianity and its practitioners aren't righteous; they aren't justified. I've aimed to show our children the truth; I owe them a hell of a lot better than what I got. 

I write about who I am and my intentions with an honesty few could publicly maintain. Even though I fail, I really am trying to be transparent. I am sorry for my failures to communicate, to uphold my commitments, and to be the man you need or want. I'm simply not rational and consistent enough either; I apologize for that as well.

It is my moral right as a human being to defend myself as a victim, even if I do so fragmentedly and not nearly as effectively as someone who wasn't mentally abused. I am definitely a man whose intuitions are split on the matter (and that makes sense). I've been rapidly trying to rewrite myself. Perhaps that too is not enough. If I could undo it all (much of which wasn't up to me), I would. Believe me, I really wish I never lived. Even though you didn't say it, you would be correct to say you didn't sign up for this, and I willingly absolve you of whatever duty you may have left. Just say the word. I really don't want to cause you pain.

You really have tried your best. I think I have too. I cannot give you what you want. You don't deserve any of this, and you deserve wildly better. I know it, and you should too. Our married lives are marred. Perhaps we are each alone, even after fighting our way to compatibilizing our maps. It's not your fault at all. I don't think it's mine either.

I'm not here to give up, and I don't think you are either.
