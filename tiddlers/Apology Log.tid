title: Apology Log

!! About:

//Make it a habit to forgive and apologize to yourself and others.//

I need to be a person who apologizes in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, and so on and so forth. Admittedly, I am not an expert of experts on the metaethics and phenomenology of apologies. Apologies are crucial functions in human relations and identity-shaping, but I don't fully understand the concept.<<ref "1">> I am not virtuous enough to pick out all the morally salient features of these theoretical contexts, let alone having the habitual will-power and fitting moral motivation to consistently apply them. I am sorry for my ignorance of apologies. Where I do not know, I can only hope to improve.

I need to think about what I'm apologizing for and to whom. It's time to start apologizing more because it is both useful and intrinsically valuable<<ref "2">> to apologize. I want to be the kind of person who apologizes more frequently and wisely.

Of course, apologies are useful to us. Apologies don't change the past, but they do change the future. Apologies fix relationships, gluing together our broken bonds. Obviously, the goal is not to merely virtue signal or justify our behavior with apologies. One must be careful in moving from "please" to "sorry" as the magic word for achieving one's ends. Once we engage in the "it is easier to ask for forgiveness than permission" instrumental territory of employing apologies as excuses, we are deceptively using people as mere means. Essentially, one must not simply look at the consequence of an apology, but also the motivating principle.

Apologies can be inadequate. "I'm sorry" doesn't solve everything. Even changing who you are and your behavior doesn't always fix it. Restoration is a necessary goal, but unfortunately, restoring the victim is not always possible, and the penance of retributive justice does not always soothe pain either. Sadly, time and effort do not always heal a wound. But, in some normative sense, that's okay; sometimes it is outside our control. Apologies are not merely for obvious and direct beneficial consequences; they are part of the good will atonement for bad will (the fundamental moral consequential reasoning of fallible and imperfect "autonomous" Kantian creatures). You can only stoicly do your best and worry about what is in your control in your attempt to be a unified moral agent.

* I dream that one day the //Focus// subsection is empty because I don't need it anymore (not because I've decided not to apologize when it was necessary).

<<footnotes "1" "Sadly, I don't think any of you do either. Many are flat out wrong about the nature of atonement, what we owe to others and ourselves, our moral psychology, etc. A complete analysis of the notion of an apology is equivalent to and requires having solved some much larger looking problems in philosophy.">>

<<footnotes "2" "Or, the act itself recognizes the intrinsic value of the other as an end in themselves, and hence apology is of the hypothetical reason necessary for employing the categorical imperative as an end, and so on.">>

<<footnotes "3" "Duh.">>
