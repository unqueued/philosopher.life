How's your weekend been?
2 HR AGO
Pretty good! Snow day from church weehoo
1 HR AGO
Hehe
1 HR AGO
That is excellent.
1 HR AGO
No school tomorrow either, I assume.
1 HR AGO
Exactly
1 HR AGO
A long, snowy weekend
1 HR AGO
But tomorrow I get to have a cracked molar pulled
1 HR AGO
=(
1 HR AGO
I need to go to the dentist someday.
1 HR AGO
It's been 16ish years. I'm sure nothing has gone wrong in that time period.
1 HR AGO
It’s my own fault but not doing the things I need to take care of myself
1 HR AGO
Yeah pain has forced me to take a better look
1 HR AGO
I hope it is painless, relieving, and dirt cheap for you.
1 HR AGO
Pulling is ...root canal and crown not so much ...so we pull
1 HR AGO
So the bookstore chain that I work for is looking at closing stores...can’t keep up in the digital age.
1 HR AGO
Ah.
1 HR AGO
I'm sorry.
1 HR AGO
I know keeping busy is a valuable way to be constructive. What are you thinking of doing instead?
1 HR AGO
Assuming they do close down.
1 HR AGO
Not sure if that includes our store or not but I can’t imagine they would close bigger stores and leave us open
1 HR AGO
Well it sounds like we are good until April then they do an 8 week closing sale and then clean up. Those that stay get a bonus
1 HR AGO
Sounds like that will get me through most of the summer.
1 HR AGO
Cool. It sounds like you have time to plan too.
1 HR AGO
I don’t know if I will try and get a side hustle for the school year or if I will wait until summer again...
1 HR AGO
Yeah plenty of time to plan
1 HR AGO
Unless you have to, might choose not to have a side hustle and plan something else. I have no idea what that might be. It's a cool opportunity though.
1 HR AGO
The sucky part has been that the manager we had (and she was really good and has been with the company in different positions for years) She left to move up to a spot at the corporate office in October
1 HR AGO
They started letting go at the corporate level first and she was one of the 110 that got the axe
1 HR AGO
Ah.
1 HR AGO
That sucks hard.
1 HR AGO
What's she doing?
1 HR AGO
Yeah —you’d think they would at least say —hey do you want your manager spot back? (They haven’t filled it)
1 HR AGO
I am not surprised by the kinds of moves they are making, but I'm sorry to see she is a victim of it.
1 HR AGO
So far she is ok...they did give a severance of some sorts and she was living with a family that she used to nanny for so she can do that but she is actively looking
1 HR AGO
Yeah me too
1 HR AGO
I am thinking about other things I might like to do ...I have a friend that teaches at ECTC (math) at night. Maybe I can look into that but it would require more math than I have maybe?
1 HR AGO
Noice. I have no idea what is required for it.
1 HR AGO
Me either but she would know
1 HR AGO
On the upside, we got to have lunch with [[K]] and [[L]] and [[UJ]]’s nephew Seth
1 HR AGO
It was really nice :blush:
1 HR AGO
That is awesome. =)
1 HR AGO
[[UJ]] HAD to go to guitar center —it’s a good thing we don’t live closer to it. But that is right by [[L]]’s apt
59 MIN AGO
rofl
58 MIN AGO
We had Five Guys burgers and fries —greasy but awesome
58 MIN AGO
flies and honey, Guitar Center is awesome
58 MIN AGO
Sounds like an amazing day.
58 MIN AGO
Yep yep
58 MIN AGO
You'd be broke if they had one next to you.
58 MIN AGO
It was
58 MIN AGO
No kidding
57 MIN AGO
They keep offering him credit which would not be a good thing
57 MIN AGO
Lol. But, he needs that 5,000 dollar guitar. Don't you understand?
57 MIN AGO
Apparently I don’t
56 MIN AGO
But he loves that you do?
56 MIN AGO
I do not! Lol. I have the cheapest solid top on the market.
56 MIN AGO
The beautiful part of being unskilled with my instruments is that I can't really feel or hear the difference between the highest end and the midgrade.
55 MIN AGO
It's like coffee for me.
55 MIN AGO
My wife instantly can tell you many things in blind tests about her coffee (I test her for fun).
55 MIN AGO
I have no preference for whichever black coffee you put in front of me. It's coffee.
55 MIN AGO
Nice!
55 MIN AGO
I'm a philistine.
55 MIN AGO
He can tell you with music but not food
54 MIN AGO
He says he is a goat
54 MIN AGO
:goat:
54 MIN AGO
Goats are delicious.
54 MIN AGO
Sure?
54 MIN AGO
Lol
