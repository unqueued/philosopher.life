Autonomy and Freedom


The concept of autonomy is closely linked with the concept of freedom, but they are not the same. To get clear on the former it will help to distinguish it from the latter.


Berlin distinguishes two kinds of freedom: negative and positive. His conception of positive freedom is very close to what contemporary theorists call “autonomy.” So let’s start with his conception of negative freedom and see how it relates to his conception of positive freedom.


Varieties of Negative Freedom


What is freedom? What does it mean to be free?


Hobbes and Mill believed (or are often thought to have believed) that freedom is largely a matter of non-frustration – of being able to do what you want to do.


Hobbes: “A free man is he that, in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do, is not hindered to do what he has a will to do.” It’s not clear how to interpret this, but Hobbes is often interpreted as holding the view that you’re free insofar as your preferred option is accessible.


Berlin disagrees with Hobbes for three reasons:

    Hobbes’s view (on at least one interpretation) makes no mention of the restricting actions of others. On his view, any hindrance detracts from your freedom. Berlin, however, thinks that the hindrance has to be man-made and intentional. Mere inability, he thinks, doesn’t make you less free. Coercion, he notes, implies the deliberate interference of human beings within the area in which one could otherwise act. This view is fairly widespread. Consider:


Rousseau: “The nature of things does not madden us. Only ill will does.”


Kant: “Find himself in what condition he will, the human being is dependent on many external things…. But what is harder and more unnatural than this yoke of necessity is the subjection of one human being under the will of another. No misfortune can be more terrifying to one who is accustomed to freedom.”


    Unlike Hobbes, Berlin thinks that you lose freedom if others prevent you from doing what you could have done, or what you might have wanted to do, and not merely what you actually wanted to do. On Hobbes’s view, as long as your preferred option is available you are free, even if no other options are available.


For Berlin, your options are like doors. How extensive your choice is depends on how many doors there are. How significant the choice is depends on what the doors lead to. And how free the choice is depends on whether and the extent to which the doors are closed because of the actions of others.


    On Hobbes’s view, it seems that you can enhance your freedom by adapting your desires to your circumstances. Berlin thinks this isn’t possible – one cannot make oneself freer in this way. To think otherwise, he thinks, is to confuse freedom with desire fulfillment.

Berlin: “To teach a man that, if he cannot get what he wants, he must learn to want only what he can get may contribute to his happiness or his security; but it will not increase his freedom.”

Berlin, then, rejects the idea of freedom as non-frustration and opts instead for the idea of freedom as non-interference. Freedom, he thinks, requires that every option be accessible in that it isn’t blocked or obscured by the (deliberate?) actions of others.


We could, however, insist on an even more muscular conception of freedom – freedom as non-domination – according to which every door must be open and there must not be any doorkeepers with the power to close them. We might prefer this conception for two reasons:


    Freedom as non-interference is compatible with benevolent slavery.

    If you can’t make yourself freer by adaptation, why think that you can make yourself freer by ingratiation?


Negative Freedom: The Options View


On the options view, your freedom depends on the number and quality of your options. The more options you have, and the more desirable they are, the freer you are. On this view, anything that limits either the number or quality of your options limits your freedom, whether it’s other people, nature, or your own inadequacies.


Positive Freedom - Autonomy


You’re free in the negative sense, thinks Berlin, insofar as no one interferes with your activities. You’re free in the positive sense to the extent that you’re governed by your true self.


Autonomy, on this view, is a kind of self-mastery, which you achieve by taming the demons within. Clearly this view requires a way to distinguish between those internal elements that are “demons” – that are alien to you – and those that are genuinely your own. Traditionally, the concept of rationality has played a key role in drawing that distinction.


The thought is that the real you is the rational you, and that you are self-governing when you are ruled not by your passions but by the rational side of your nature.


Rationality, of course, is a hotly disputed concept. But it’s not so far-fetched to think that some beliefs and desires are rationally forbidden while others are rationally required, and that the latter define the real you. Interestingly, on this view, the real you is not what makes you different from everyone else but it’s what you have in common with others. The real me and the real you are essentially the same. The fake me and the fake you, however, are vastly different.


A problem with autonomy, thinks Berlin, is that it provides a cover for those who wish to coerce others. It allows them to say that what may seem like coercion is really nothing of the sort because the one being “coerced” actually endorses the coercion.


Consider: X coerces Y when X makes Y do something that Y doesn’t want to do. But what we actually want depends on who we are, and if we’re essentially rational creatures, and if reason compels us to want certain things, then those might be what we actually want, regardless of what we say we want. Forcing us to act on those desires, then, might not be coercive.


An interesting reply, though, would be to argue that one can force people even to do the things they most want – that such acts might be justifiable but they are still coercive. Or one could challenge the distinction between real and fake selves or the attempt to carve out that distinction by appealing to the concept of rationality.
