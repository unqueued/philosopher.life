Sounds like after school has been rough —how’s it going otherwise?
THU 12:32 PM
I appreciate that. Thank you. It is a weird one (no surprise).
THU 12:32 PM
We're doing okay. [[j3d1h]] is sick today!
THU 12:32 PM
That never happens.
THU 12:32 PM
I think I must have passed something to her.
THU 12:32 PM
She got some extra sleep and is just reading today.
THU 12:32 PM
I still don't have [[1uxb0x]]'s machine fixed. Hoping to sell the piano.
THU 12:33 PM
Been practicing meditation (which is..uh...not something I have any practice with).
THU 12:33 PM
Hopefully will learn to silence myself. =)
THU 12:34 PM
([[j3d1h]] says, "yeah, you should do that")
THU 12:34 PM
It’s hard to be with myself in silence
THU 12:34 PM
Sorry [[j3d1h]] is sick :face_with_thermometer::confused:
THU 12:35 PM
ikr, the amount of anxiety is overwhelming
THU 12:35 PM
or...I'm having too much fun thinking, hard to stop
THU 12:35 PM
Yeah I use noise to silences the pit voices
THU 12:35 PM
! Lol!
THU 12:36 PM
Preach.
THU 12:36 PM
How about you, how's it going?
THU 12:37 PM
I am ok —I think I am doing better about knowing when I need more meds to cope so I am able to be normal
THU 12:39 PM
Or at least do the things that are expected at the house...
THU 12:41 PM
Ah, that is a skill. [[JRE]] recently had to do that too. It's cool to see it working. That's not an easy thing to measure.
THU 12:41 PM
You and [[JRE]] both have me thinking about trying anti-depressants again.
THU 12:42 PM
It has taken forever to first get on meds and second find the right dosage
THU 12:44 PM
I am able to play with amounts because I have had some donated by a family member that refuses to take it
THU 12:45 PM
Lol
THU 12:45 PM
I am sorry for them, and I happy for you.
THU 12:45 PM
I'm glad you have the resources needed to find it.
THU 12:45 PM
Yeah, I wish this person would take it for themselves but it certainly has helped me
