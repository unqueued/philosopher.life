title: 2018.05.30 - Deep Reading Log: The Doors of Perception

This appears to be he first major use of an entheogen. It's a very interesting account.

Is-ness, beautiful. The being and becoming conflation is the classic problem, but I'm not convinced he has solved the problem either.

He appears to have had a much stronger trip than anything I've had outside of ketamine.

The notion that we have perfect memory seems extremely unlikely. The shutting out, however, the filtering, the Bayesian filter, seems entirely right. I'm very pleased with his evo-psych language approach.

The Glucose argument might actually have some truth to it!

He is worried about drugs making up too introspective, lacking the pursuit of what he takes to be our survival telos? Why?

The finite mind perceiving totality line is epic.

Why should I agree that rich color perception isn't evolutionarily useful to us? This seems out of line with the level of reasoning he presents otherwise.

Symbols can never be the things they stand for.

He seems to smack artists around a lot. But, doesn't he see his own word-symbols have this? Of course, but then what does he think he is engaged in?

I think his discussion of ego-death, depersonalization, and derealization is fascinating.

Someone, it is the non-reality in art that makes it most beautiful to him. I looked at those paintings.

Contemplating in its height but not its fullness...? Access, but incompatible with action and will to action, even the thought of action. Is this just him, though?

"Suchness" and world of contingencies. This dude is speaking my language.

"Psychological disintegration" =) !!!

Totality found in the broken pieces. Dangerous but advantageous to live in that disintegration.

The urge to escape from selfhood... =)

It is clear he has the noble savage fallacy going on (reminds me of Brave New World)
