!! Part 1 — The Engineers Plot

The Stalin conflict with the Bourgeois Engineers is new to me. I clearly know very little about the history of it. Stalin was correct, in a sense, to view us as tiny cogs in a societal machine. 

It's interesting to see the STEM majors were purposely overspecialized on purpose.

"Building the new world" - I can only assume that software and electrical engineers of today are engaged in the same process. 


!! Part 2 — To The Brink Of Eternity

I'm continually reminded of the power of the RAND corporation over many decades. I do not understand their powers now.

It's interesting to see how we feed analysts false information.

Warmongering is quite real, and always has been.

It's interesting to see a history of preppers.

Game theory had a profound influence earlier than I realized. I didn't know it was practiced this early.

The Star Wars project always was ridiculous.


!! Part 3 — The League Of Gentlemen

The two-edged sword isn't presented well enough in this series.

Infinite economic growth and neoliberalism cropping up.

I think stagflation is actually occurring right now!

It's interesting how the flat rate of growth isn't the primary problem in a way, but rather the comparative rate of growth against other nations.

I can't believe I'm hearing this economic theory continually being put into practice again and again. How is this not profound evidence that monetary policy and economists are frauds? Remember: 50% of psychology's most important studies can't be reproduced. Why should we think something this complex could likely be modeled either?

You should have believed the Marxist story! It's fucking obvious.


!! Part 4 — Goodbye Mrs. Ant

The DDT thing takes me back to the uproar of my childhood.

Sometimes, I think Curtis is a luddite.

It is interesting to see how academia is continually harnessed by capitalists. 

The Anti-Leftism has been pretty disgusting.
