title: 2020.02.17 - Prompted Introspection: Olympics?

!! Should the Canadian Government financially support Olympic teams?

Samwise, I've decided you are Canadian. I think the Olympics are a sham, a capitalist venture, and a complete failure to recognize what's most essential about who we are as a species. We have bigger fish to fry than this bullshit, and I say the same about sports in schools. 

Don't get me wrong: I enjoy playing sports (or did for most of my life), and I'm hypercompetitive in many cases. It's not what matters though beyond mere subjectivity in the vast majority of cases. We face real problems in the world.
