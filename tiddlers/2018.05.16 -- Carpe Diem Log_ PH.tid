title: 2018.05.16 -- Carpe Diem Log: PH

* Woke at 5:54, but I had many awakenings through the night. It was good sleep though. 
** I am grateful.
* I forgot that I got gas until I had been awake for 10 minutes (how the fuck am I forgetting things like that?)
* Sidenote: I think I'm still gaining weight. =/ I have been parting with my pure fruits and veggies for breakfast and lunch. That's a mistake. It's been difficult though. I only have so much time in the day. I still get a ton of them, but I also tend to have other stuff. I should work harder to stick to my diet.
* Went to work; it was raining the entire time.
