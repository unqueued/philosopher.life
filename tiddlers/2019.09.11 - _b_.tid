I wonder if there will be a day where I'm done being addicted to vidja games. It's difficult to find a game which can hold my attention. A mix of nostalgia and a brand new set of mechanics I've never seen in a game before has overtaken me twice now in the past few years. 

Magic has lost all much of that quality. It's a beautiful machine to me, and I enjoy being there. Watching my children light up and come out of their shells with their cardboard rhetoric is great. It does not consume me; it doesn't offer that delectable skinnerbox bait.

It's interesting to see a collection of such intelligent (though I do not claim wise, and thus intelligent [[irwartfrr]] and all the way down) people banded together wasting their lives in this experience machine. It's both glorious and heartbreaking. That's the way it is with these sorts of games. We are a pile of broken fools. I should know better.
