!! About:

//You are what you eat, and your shit just is you. Do the dirty. Go on. Do as St. Morty preaches: ''get your shit together''. Welcome to the Bastion of Caprophilia; The Official Asshole of this Wiki. Bootstrapping Random Seed, Dissonant Cognitive Dissident, Crucible of the Human Paradox,  Sparkthread of Genius: Fly, My Darling! Be free, my thought-turd-doves!//

Did a lightbulb turn on for you? Is something bothering you? Are you feeling constipated? You know you need to "get it out" before you lose that intuition or insight, before you suffer by clogging your mind with it. Don't be embarrassed about it either because, as they say: "Everybody poops." If you don't know where to put it or don't want to label it, then put it here! Better here than nowhere. Pain is the price of progress, thus you must filter for [[Redpills]] and [[Diamonds]] lodged in your concentrated evil shit-stream-of-consciousness. 

Evolution relies upon randomness. Computation relies upon inputs, transformation, and outputs. Apply the principles, mentat! Thus, we all must preserve, contain, and harness that beautiful spark of craziness in ourselves. It's simply too useful and wonderfully human not to. Take this calculated risk because it pays off; this is the gamble worth taking. Be a brave boy, and take a shit in your potty. 

Freewrite, doodle, and dash your chicken-scratch upon these wikipages. This is a place to be creative and random. Be messy or organized. Be constructive or destructive. See what your gut is really telling you. Go ahead and take a braindump. //Uhhhhhhhgnh//. Let the psychic diarrhea flow.<<ref "1">> //Sploooooosh//. This is a place for chaotic, honest imagination. Peer behind the veil; find the music. Seek the diamonds and redpills in the rough; plant those seeds. Shotgun fling your poo at the wall and see what sticks; find the emergent beauty.

Be uninhibitedly meta; take the first steps into a new frontier or idea; be free. You aren't beholden to any hierarchy or criticism here. Listen to your gut, and go with the flow. Try to use your bigboy words, but if you can't, that's okay too. You don't even need to wipe: just get it out! Take a deep breath and //push// that turd-baby of a thought onto the pages of this wiki. ''Push! You can do it!!''

Welcome to an existential implementation of the Monte Carlo Method.  Too often (for us to accept it is random chance) these uncharted and uncategorized chaotic seeds contain diamonds and redpills.<<ref "2">> They are practical philosophical facts applicable to your perceptions of the world. Not all your ideas are good; however, some of them will be soberly sane, and you will even find the thread of genius in some of them. You'd be surprised where the seeds eventually germinate and find themselves; they flourish, cross-pollinate, and evolve.

This uniquely titled homage log contains the bulk of your stream-of-consciousness writing. You might initially see it as the [[Prompted Introspection Log]] with no rules, requirements, or limits. It seems to be more than that though, but you probably aren't sure how to explain it (virgin ideas are rarely well-supported, unfragmented, and effectively articulated). In any case, it is worth your time. Take a shit, pick out the seeds, plant them, and cultivate them in this fertile scratchpad field, the playground shitgarden in your existential sandbox.<<ref "3">> 

Make lemonade and grow a forest of wisdom from what you shit out of your mind because you don't know what you don't know, and therefore you are often in no position to deny yourself the opportunity to just say what's on your mind in the moment, particularly to yourself. In here, you've haphazardly wisely (i.e. paradoxically) given //root// access to a madmen: yourself. This is as freewill-libertarian homunculus as you get. Consciousness, that Daseinic narrative collectively written and observed by your non-conscious, computational minds is the most fundamental feedback loop mechanism that defines who you are. Even if conciousness isn't free, it's still the function most essential to defining, changing, and interpreting your identity: forming and modifying the habits that constitute your persistent identity.

This is a dangerous, beautifully messy, and amazingly necessary place on this wiki; here your stream-of-consciousness directly adds to my (future-you's) wiki. I respect you, warts, shit, and all. ''Go make mistakes''. Seriously. Be the best turd-throwing primate you can be! I need the treasures hiding in your poop (yummy). So, have at it, go hog-wild, go hax0r it, and go "make'h the pooooopiiees." With a shit-eating grin, I'm picking through, hopefully cleaning off, and eating whatever you're serving out of that beautiful hairy asshole I'm eating out and from like a 4-dimensional self-human-centipede.

!! Principles:

* "We'll do it live! Fuck it!"
* Write whatever you want.
** If it releases you of judgment, consider this a subset of {[[Dreams]]}.
** You are free to write any narrative or thought in a sandboxed virtual experience machine; watch it play out.
* This log is so prestigious it doesn't even follow conventions or {[[Principles]]} unless I feel like it in the moment. 
** Run free! Fly! Be what you will!
* Seems like it should remain [title.Title]less.
** Fight the power!
* Let's just assume /b/ is perma -=[ Rabbitholed ]=-
* Write your letter to yourself, humanity, family, friend, stranger, or foe. Say whatever you need to say.
* Audits are required.

!! Dreams:

* Consider wiping...
** While the seeds may be random, I would like the cultivation and interrogation of these seeds to eventually have a more formal process and outlet.
* Try to figure out how to change your wiki so that you can pour some of your work into designated areas, into projects themselves.

<<footnotes "1" "You don't have to be proud of it, but you know you'll look at it. You always look at the shit which comes out of you. Most people do (that is, look at their //own// shit). Enjoy it. You aren't living if you aren't taking a good, hard look at your shit, i.e. [[Know Thyself]].">>

<<footnotes "2" "''For Posterity's Sake, I leave this Relic here to remind myself of how far I've come, of what this page really meant to me, and of how and why both I and this wiki have evolved the way we have:'' Of course, this begins to look like its own {[[Projects|Projects on this Wiki]]} page, but I will not [[infinigress]]. To some extent, Stream-of-Conscious writing was how the {[[Projects|Projects on this Wiki]]} started out. However, this log is much closer to {[[Dreams]]}. Ultimately, it's important to keep this kind of free-thinking zone available. The 4chan consciousness was proof of it. The irony of what they would think of this truly magnificent device and my obvious autism is not lost on me. I am thankful, nonetheless, to those low-empathy anons. /salute; o7">>

<<footnotes "3" "Which isn't to say the wiki isn't ultimately a shitgarden either. I'd like to hope it is better than that. Poop in this corner of your sandbox, please.">>
