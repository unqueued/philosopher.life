!! About:

//‚Ç©“∫ùò¢ à ‚ï§—õ·òì ùîΩ·µÅ óÍó™ is this sublime stack of mere heaps? You are what you eat, and your shitposting just is you. So, go on: do the dirty. Do as St. Morty preaches: ''get your shit together''. [[/b/]] it! Welcome to the Dialetheic Bastion of Caprophilia, The Chaotic Libertarian Freeport of Memes, The Official Asshole of this Wiki. Bootstrapping Random Seed, Dissonant Cognitive Dissident, Filthy Crucible of the Human Paradox, Sparkthread of Genius: Fly, My Darling! Be free, my floating thought-turd-dove!//

Yo. What it do? I FINK U [[4EAK|4eak]]Y, and [[I like you a lot|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uee_mcxvrw&]]. Immerse yourself in the poophorically explosive overflow of sometimes valuable, self-anonymized, donated hypothetical shitstorms and toilet-graffiti. Bless your interpretatin' heart...

Did a lightbulb turn on for you? Is something bothering you? Can thy olfactory senses detect what //teh// Dwayne Johnson is preparing?<<ref "la">> Are you feeling constipated? You know you need to "get it out" before you lose that intuition or insight before you suffer by clogging your mind with it. Don't be embarrassed about it either because, as they say: "Everybody poops." If you don't know where to put it, don't want to label it, do not wish to endorse or assent to it, or wish to quarantine or bracket it: then put it here! Better here than nowhere. You'll figure out what to do with it later. 

The pain of learning [[W5H]] to trust yourself is the price of progress, thus you must filter for [[redpills]] and [[diamonds]] lodged in your (often) concentrated evil shit-stream-of-consciousness emerging from your non-conscious processes. Coherence is an art even when it's built with boxes of contradictions. Write that fresh, ugly unwritten. Bypass the paralysis of analysis if you must.

Painful though it may be, salient evolution still relies upon some element of randomness. Computation boils down to inputs, transformation, and outputs. Apply the principles, mentat! Thus, we all must preserve, contain, and harness that beautiful spark of craziness in ourselves. It's simply too useful and wonderfully human not to. Take this calculated risk of improvisation because it pays off; this is the gamble worth taking. Control, containerize, and digest your randomness, sir. Be a brave boy, and take a shit in your potty. 

Freewrite, free associate, spin up seemingly useless objects, incoherently doodle, and rapidly dash your chicken-scratch upon these pages. Just stamp it with your [[/b/]] seal of who-gives-a-fuck? This is a place to be creative and haphazard. Be messy or organized. Be constructive or destructive. Stop trying to care about anything except getting it out. See what your gut is really telling you. Go ahead and take a braindump. //Uhhhhhhhgnh//. Let the psychic diarrhea flow.<<ref "1">> //Sploooooosh//. This is a place for chaotic, honest imagination. Peer behind the veil; find the music. Seek the diamonds and redpills in the rough. Plant those seeds. Shotgun fling your poo at the wall and see what sticks; find the emergent beauty.

Be uninhibitedly meta; take the first steps into a new frontier or idea; be free. You aren't beholden to any hierarchy or criticism here. Pretend there are no rules, requirements, or limits. Listen to your gut, and go with the flow. Try to use your bigboy words, but if you can't, that's okay too. You don't even need to wipe: just get it out! Take a deep breath and //push// that turd-baby of a thought onto the pages of this wiki. ''Push! You can do it!!''

Welcome to an existential implementation of the Monte Carlo Method.  Too often (for us to accept it is mere random chance) these uncharted and uncategorized chaotic seeds contain or lead to diamonds and redpills.<<ref "2">> Dasein affectively wears different lenses in his various modes towards the world. So listen up, my little Dasein, these are often your crucial bracketings and debracketings of perceptions of the world. Not all your ideas are good (most are shit); however, some of them will be soberly sane, and you will even find the thread of genius in some of them. You'd be surprised where the seeds eventually germinate and find themselves; they flourish, cross-pollinate, and evolve.

This uniquely titled homage log contains the bulk of your uncategorized stream-of-consciousness writing. You probably aren't sure how to explain it because virgin ideas are rarely well-supported, unfragmented, and effectively articulated. In any case, it is worth your time. Take a shit, pick out the seeds, plant them, and cultivate them with this fertile scratchpad field, the playground shitgarden in your existential sandbox.<<ref "3">> 

Make lemonade and grow a forest of wisdom from what you shit out of your mind because you don't know what you don't know, and therefore you are often in no position to deny yourself the opportunity to just say what's on your mind in the moment, particularly to yourself. In here, you've haphazardly wisely (i.e. paradoxically) given //root// access to a madman: yourself. This is as pregnant-present freewill-libertarian homunculean as you get. Consciousness, that Daseinic narrative collectively written and observed by your non-conscious, computational minds is the most fundamental feedback loop mechanism that defines who you are. Even if consciousness isn't free, it's still the function most essential to defining, changing, and interpreting your identity: forming and modifying the habits that constitute your persistent identity.

This is a dangerous and necessary memetic inlet and outlet on this wiki. Here your stream-of-consciousness directly adds to my (future-you's) wiki. I respect you, warts, shit, and all. ''Go make mistakes''. Seriously. Be the best turd-throwing primate you can be! I need the treasures hiding in your poop (yummy). So, have at it, go hogwild, go hax0r it, and go "make'h the pooooopiiees." With a shit-eating grin, I'm picking through, hopefully cleaning off, and eating whatever you're serving out of that beautiful hairy asshole I'm eating out and from like a 4-dimensional self-human-centipede.

[[/b/]]-attidunally your justifiable [[/b/]]eatitudes.

<<footnotes "2" "For Posterity's Sake, I leave this ''Relic'' here to remind myself of how far I've come, of what this page really meant to me, and of how and why both I and this wiki have evolved the way we have.

To some extent, Stream-of-Conscious writing was how the {[[Projects|Projects on this Wiki]]} directory started out. However, this log is much closer to {[[Dreams]]}. Ultimately, it's important to keep this kind of free-thinking zone available. The 4chan consciousness was proof of it. The irony of what they would think of this truly magnificent device and my obvious autism is not lost on me. I am thankful, nonetheless, to those low-empathy anons. /salute; o7">>
