title: 2019.10.02 - Afterschool Teaching: Yeah, Probably

Delp pulled us all aside and showed us what a student had written on some paper on the librarian's desk:

<<<
5TB is a bitch. Fuck you.
<<<

True and deserved words, of course. Delp went on a handwriting analysis spree until he found a suitable culprit, 6CM. He copped to it, but then he claims he didn't do it. Delp is convinced it is his handwriting. He is suspended. We talked, he cried, and I know he's going to be in a lot of trouble. 

The librarian was also annoyed that two students had played hide and seek behind her desk (I'm guessing an adult must have said something since no video footage of the room was viewed; the cop was leaving when I arrived today, so that's why). I've been asked to take that desk (which even I have been avoiding) to make sure no student can. Alright.

Carson is almost too privileged to touch oranges. They make her gag. She's proud of being a picky and neat eater. Whitney is a country girl who is far less dainty. Both are willing to get their hands dirty, but it bothers one far more than the other.

Matt has been staying late to help. I complimented him on it and commiserated. He's so fucking drained. That first year is killer.

One-on-ones went well. I was pleasantly surprised to see Carson join me in sitting with the kids to talk. I was super happy to see all my younger children already working on their homework before we arrived. 

5JW had homework today! We joked about it. 

7C got in trouble in school. I can never trust anyone's story, but I am surprised to see it. He also had homework for it, and he was adamant he wasn't going to work this punishment because he was innocent. I think I convinced him this particular fight wasn't worth it for him. 

8HM and I talked about her book. She has to write on every book. She's putting my children to shame. I am pretty disgusted by my parenting when I see her kicking so much ass. Yeah, the book is trash and her papers aren't great, but she fucking tries. She's recognizing that none of the other children do as much work as she does, but I told her to keep it up. I have no hand in her success, but I'm proud from afar of her commitment.

We are, of course, banned from the library. I am surprised not to hear it was my fault this time around (though maybe that will come). They may have recalled that the students were all handed to me, but maybe they were too dazzled by the drama of it. 

I took my 6th graders to Stout's room. Since we cannot go to the gym, library, lab, or outside (banned or used by other groups), it was either a classroom or the cafeteria. I don't care for the useless panopticon. They are the most difficult group, but isolated, they can be handled. It was a boring day for them since they wouldn't take any of my suggestions. There's only two students who want to be there; the rest are forced for babysitting and/or as a punishment for failing grades. Hard to work with students who have no intention of being even decent. Most despise how much I describe and prescribe, taking them to task for shitty arguments, and holding them accountable. 

We talked about prisons.

My daughter called me in the middle of class. Emergency flood in our bathroom, but my son figured out how to turn off the water from the valve before it got insane. Clever boy. My public children heard the conversation and were surprised by the sequence of events. My daughter sounded weird on the phone. 

My namesake and I continue to speak about the value of her overtly honest and confrontational style. The pot spoke with the kettle, and I'm trying to save her some heartache. I see where she gets it from. Her adoptive parents love her; it's so obvious.

Whitney told me 8L punched 8A, and she got suspended as well. It's been one of those days. That girl hates being here too, understandably.

Carson and I talked in the office for a bit. She says this is nothing like the school she and her brothers attended in Bristol. She said it was the best prep school there, and her brothers didn't even know what a cussword was (lol). She said the teachers at her school were really good, but others were there for a paycheck. She said she was here because it looked good on her resume. She is shocked by what a poor kid's school is like. It's a shame she doesn't have a real education either; I see a pure reactionary in her.

Delp talked about the festival he's working at. He continues to encourage me to take my children to it because it would be so educational. 

Everyone seemed to be fairly spent today.
