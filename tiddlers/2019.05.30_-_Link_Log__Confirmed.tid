*** Psychopaths can empathize. Morality is about moral motivation in choosing not to stop empathizing [[irwartfrr]] and exercising [[The Golden Rule]] as rationally as we can by placing ourselves behind the [[VOI]].

*** It's weird to see that I already have engaged in something like that cryptographic behavior even though I'm obviously disgusted by AMP.

*** It is rare that I meet people who are opposed to poverty who have ever fucking served the impoverished with their lives.

*** I'm going to puke. Why won't the world be more like I want it to be? The best solution I can find looks nothing like this at all. Thank god I don't make decisions which matter even for my own life, lol.

*** Yeah, I have noticed the walls are closing in on me. Fuck.

* Think About It
** https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/24/a-new-trial-of-an-ancient-rhetorical-trick-finds-it-can-make-you-wiser/
*** I'd be interested to know if my autism influences the efficacy of that trick. I find the second-personal approach in [[TDL]] refreshing and useful. I am, of course, an obscene ruminator.

*** Mein scarce resources are [[hope]] and meaning, right?
** http://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/dude-wheres-my-frontal-cortex-rp
*** Small reward feels like a punishment. Give me all the risks. I would not call my daughter optimistic, and it depends on the context for empathy. Sometimes her ability to read my mind exceeds not only her mother's, but even my own: that is fucking crazy. The article makes me feel better for her and where she is though. I just don't want to fail her; I'm tired of failing.
** https://anticapital0.wordpress.com/the-limitations-of-the-wage-demand/
*** Like any drunk socialist, my problem is that I'm retarded because I'm interested is answering capitalism on a global scale. I find very few people who are willing to sacrifice for people they've never met. I've met fucking genius moral philosophers who rationalize that immoral behavior too. I can't convince people not to be egoists; they've already committed the unforgivable.
** https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/group-chats-are-making-the-internet-fun-again.html
*** Part of my usual 1vN problematic. I do see this spreading around me, but it doesn't work for me. That this isn't decentralized is the gross part. 

* Fishy

*** You've got to be shitting me. It's been obvious for well over a decade. No. These assholes are responsible.
** https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-20/many-millennials-gen-z-pessimistic-on-life-deloitte-survey
*** Show me an apples to apples age comparison. Wait until the chillun are Jesus' Crufixional Age as material conditions worsen. Until then, all I see is "cry me a river." 
** https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/22/the-apa-meeting-a-photo-essay/
*** Better to make fun of wokeness, reactionary.
** https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/20/politics/dhs-chinese-drone-warning/index.html
*** Yellow scare. I prefer fever and decentralizing fervor. Guis, why can't see just make love and peace rather than war?
** https://qz.com/1624252/pythons-creator-thinks-it-has-a-diversity-problem/
*** Looks like idpol reactionary. I'm too shitty with any language to know. Also, writing is pointless and can't solve anything :P (okay, okay, I need to stop being sarcastic because, yes, I love you [it's almost not even up to me, it's great].).

* Interesting
** https://www.pcmag.com/news/368417/neal-stephenson-explains-his-vision-of-the-digital-afterlife
*** I thought I swore him off. Fuck. Okay, fine. Fine, fine, fine. If I can remember, and I really should, I need to do this.
**** 10 thousand gizmos, and no reliable way to remind myself. I will find a way to ignore anything I've designed to capture my attention. Also, you are drunk, h0p3: go somewhere besides your home.
