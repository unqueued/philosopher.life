How does that game go? Lol.
SAT 7:44 PM
It’s like you have a person that is up high on a ledge and you have to jump and flip on your way to hit a target. If you get enough points you get to move on to another high place
SUN 7:50 PM
Cool. That sounds fun. =)
SAT 7:51 PM
I am a fan of trying to understand games.
SAT 7:52 PM
I like it when they land weird
SUN 7:52 PM
What happens when they land weird?
SAT 7:53 PM
Whenever you land weird like not on their feet, they look awkward. It would probably hurt in rl but it looks funny on the game
SUN 7:54 PM
Reminds me of some ragdoll physics games, from the description.<<ref "2020.02.25">>
SAT 7:54 PM
