title: 2018.08.10 - Deep Reading: Introducing Alain Badiou

I still don't understand how to differentiate between the three kinds of epistemic agents here. What is the justification? This suffers all the problems of internalism. I cannot abide it, even though I am sympathetic to the political discourse. 

Reality is a linguistic simulation, an attempt at coherence without anything external to us. Verification, objective meaning, and The Real are impossible on this view. Obviously, my philosophical bias is coming out to play here. 

I cannot accept a correlation which allows culture to "construct" truth. Subjects play a role, but not the all encompassing one Kant leaves us.
