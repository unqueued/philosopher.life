How are you spending your day?

~~Same thing I do every Pinky, try to take over the world.~~ It's Sunday, and that means family time (https://philosopher.life/#Family%20Time). It usually consumes the entire day after they get back from church.

Will be making a roast, and doing my usual reading and writing.
