title: 2019.11.25 - TDL: Finish Boxing

* Your room is getting closer. Still can't be boxed though.
* Offspring have a ways to go, but they are making progress. Needs to be finished.
* Read+Write
* I want some veggies.
* Wife decides if we move forward with the apartment in question. Very expensive for what we are getting. Still, it's close!
