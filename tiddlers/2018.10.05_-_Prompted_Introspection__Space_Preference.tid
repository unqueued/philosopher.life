title: 2018.10.05 - Prompted Introspection: Space Preference

!! When you close your eyes and think of where you want to live, what comes to the surface? Specifically, what do you want your space to look like? And what do you think that reflects about you?

Looking at my past answer, [[2017.12.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: Living Space Wish]], I can see that I'm not just talking about my house, but my life and my wiki too. 

What I want ideally-ideally and what I want ideally-practically are different. In my context, I think I want more space around my desk so the kids can join me. I want us to throw down together at understanding ourselves and the world. I want it to be ingrained into their identities, a habituated virtue that really can only be taught with intense practice.

I hope it demonstrates my axiom: [[BAGD]]. I need my children to be armed for a world I do not understand.
