title: 2007.03.15 - Life Update.

Taxes are nearly finished. We still have a few values to put in (trying to find those). I doubt we'll get much back (we are in a the lower-middle class tax bracket now--used to be upper-lower class). That is fine with me. I'm sure we'll be asking Dad to check over our stuff to make sure it looks correct. I don't want an audit or any trouble. The cool part: we are doing our taxes online. No paper work or jazz.

Speaking of finances, we have money saved up, now we just have to choose wisely how to use it. Things we are looking at:

1.) Paying off the debt (10k)
2.) Visiting Mom and Dad in Thailand (2k-3k total)
3.) Getting a 2nd car. (2-3k)

I think it will be very difficult to do all three of these. I may sell my WoW account to try and pay for some of it.

On another random note, my pants are barely fitting. I think I'm moving from 34-36 to 36-38. I am fat. I am stagnant. Lord knows, I am not one for stagnation. I sit in front of a computer screen more than anyone I know. (Such a special bond with my monitor). My uber-wealth allows me to be fat. Although, for L*nt (so bad it deserves a Bleep), I gave up deep fried foods. I can't believe how much I miss it. So fat. I can hear my mother now: &quot;well, go for a walk, exercise, yahta yahta..&quot; I come home from work pretty tired. I usually cook dinner. Exercising means I need to equip the baby up to go...It is a hassle. Would the hassle be worth it? Sure, I could wake up early and do it, but then I'd need to goto bed earlier, which would mean I missing out on Daily Show/Colbert (my source in so many ways). I don't mind working with my hands as long as my brain is not rotting away. Where can I do both? Teach...gym! Nevermind.

My life is good. I just need to remind myself of that fact. Sure, I lack purpose, wasting away in some senses, hate my job, depise the people around me, couldn't find a spiritual and intellectual home if I had to, and see no real way out of my predicament. On top of that, j3d1h still taps herself on the chest, pointing and saying 'momma'...she mimics, but she has no idea that words mean anything. What is this, The Miracle Worker? &quot;MMMOOMMMMAAA, it has a name.&quot; Will she ever get it?....of course, my wife is just as sunshiney as I am, so we are great empathizers. Other than that, yeah, I do have it good. I'm sure every parent goes through this stuff, whatever. Fulfilling my purpose might be selfish anyways, I've got k0sh3k and j3d1h (in part, my purpose in the first place, am I begging the question?) to consider.

Wow, I nearly sound Emo. I'll shutup.
