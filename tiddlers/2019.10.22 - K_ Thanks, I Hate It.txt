Going well enough. Lots to do, not getting enough done. Lol. How about you?

Same honestly. ðŸ˜’ I need to get this workshop going but Iâ€™m feeling uninspired. Iâ€™m tempted to put the horror story off until the semesterâ€™s end and just do another chapter for now. 

For my last two stories I had something genuinely disturb me to provide inspiration but I havenâ€™t had that happen this year.

Ugh. Lol. Reminding me that I need to go write too.

Surrending myself to just making multireddits for braincandy consumption.

It wouldnâ€™t be a problem if I wasnâ€™t blindsided by this fucking presentation.

That sounds yummy haha

I just donâ€™t have the time to brainstorm when I have to wait for my professor to give us prompts so I can write another 7-8 page paper in less than a week.

We just need to disturb you! This sounds like loads of fun, lol.
OCT 22 12:47 PM
Hahaha. I need to try harder!
