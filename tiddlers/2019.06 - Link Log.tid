!! Audit:

* I think commenting sloped up over the course of the month. Noice. Sometimes you can, and sometimes you can't.
* //Vidya// has been a fine outlet. I know there are folks who like muh maymays and vids. It's a start! 
** I think this addition captures my multimedia consumption better too.
* Neat to see one with only //Think About It// and below. That is extremely rare (maybe a first).
* Some folks were interested in this particular log this month. Cool. I hope it is useful. 
* I have had a renewed sense that this will one day be valuable to ML for this wiki in a number of respects.
* I still have tabs which have sat forever, but I have slowly been clearing some out. My primary browser has been an absolute madhouse, and further, I've been mixing with other browsers on occasions (while following my usual requirements).
* This isn't directly about the [[Link Log]], but I was reminded to look it up. I have about 47k `[[foobar internal wiki link]]`s today. I'm insane.
