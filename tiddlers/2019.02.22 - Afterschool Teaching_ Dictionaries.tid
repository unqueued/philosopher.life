title: 2019.02.22 - Afterschool Teaching: Dictionaries

I got most everything ready. Delp had to go to take care of his wife. He thinks the yonanas counts as a STEM project. They aren't allowed to touch it, and we're grinding semi-frozen bananas. Wishful thinking on his part.

I took the 5th to the library. Matt came to help, but he lost his temper with them (saw him count). I told him I had the difficult ones. 5NP and 5NP2 were awful today. I made them use dictionaries, and I wouldn't hand them the answers (or engage in strategies that handed them through random attempts). I made the boys do actual work. 5TG actually tried. It was miraculous, and yes, the kid is slick as fuck. As to the shitheads, I managed them so they didn't throw absolute tantrums. Their parents are terrible, and so is capitalism.

The other 5th graders were fine. The girls and I get along swimmingly. 

The Friday anti-drug crew were here to preach to the older kids.

Mitchell and I spoke for an hour. We talked extensively about the 5th graders. He has a clear understanding of their mental states and emerging relationships. He understands many dynamics well. I am shocked by his competence. I asked what he'd like me to do differently. He likes how we're doing it, and he'd prefer I take the math tutoring from him. I told him I'm nobody (status wise), but I also praised him directly. He clearly has his head on fairly straight (even if I don't trust his motivations or larger concepts of morality and political obligations).

I saw a pipefitter peer of mine pick up 8TA! So many things have clicked for me.

The janitors and I continue to get along just fine. They work obscene hours.
