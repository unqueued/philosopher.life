* Woke up on the couch, went to bed. Couldn't sleep. Oh yeah, it's 6:30, when I normally wake up. Welp, gj.
* Layed down just relaxing with my wife.
* Inform the Men!
* Played some league and surfed.
* Found Dale's number online, called him, grabbed the tools off his porch.
* Went shopping, twice. Picked up groceries and other stuff I need to live in Charlotte.
* Prepped the ribs and put them in the oven.
* More league.
* Blessed sleep.
