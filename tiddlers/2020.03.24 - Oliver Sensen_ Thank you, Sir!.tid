I'm always going to be a fan of yours. I'm grateful for your work. You and [[Husain Sarkar|https://www.lsu.edu/hss/philosophy/people/sarkar.php]] are still my favorite rockstar Kant teachers today. It has been my honor to have been your student. I've thought about [[contact]]ing you for several years to say "thank you," and I decided to just take a chance to bother you today (please ignore me at-will).<<ref "f">>

I'm always insufficiently wrestling to fittingly understand and apply what is objectively [[salient|The Good]], and I'm grateful to you for so kindly and thoroughly helping me reason about Reason. It's been a journey, sir. In some corresponding sense, I aim to sleep with a copy of The Groundwork underneath my pillow on even the off chance of learning through osmosis. While I am surely unfit to understand what Saint Kant is [[Straussian]]ly saying, I'd like to say thank you in my impoverished Kantonese:

"Two things [as inexplicable one] fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and [[awe|Awe]]...[the unification of] the [unbound] starry heavens above me and the moral law [bound] within me."

Perhaps I'm setting off in a different direction from the last time we met; I think my dissertation on [[Intellectual Property|2014.11.10 - Challenges in Quasi-Lockean Intellectual Property Theory]] wasn't seeking what mattered most well enough. In case the links ever come down, enclosed you'll find a current copy of my diary.

Your student,

[[h0p3]]
