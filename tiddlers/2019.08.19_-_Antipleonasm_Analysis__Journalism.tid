title: 2019.08.19 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Journalism

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations.
<<<

The sentiment is correct. It's not stated carefully enough. The antecedent makes room for Journalism being in a larger class, but the second, by conversational implicature, appears to deny anything else belongs to that class. Clearly, one can print something that someone else doesn't want printed without it being journalism. 

More interestingly, however, all forms of political [[power]] are social interactions and a form of public relations. However, PR has all the connotations of a word relating to imagecrafting, face, rhetoric, and manipulation minds. Of course, telling the truth, especially when it costs us, is almost always our moral duty.
