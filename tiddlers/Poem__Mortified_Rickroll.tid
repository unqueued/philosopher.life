To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand this wiki. 

The [[redpills]] and [[diamonds]] are extremely subtle,
    and without a solid grasp of [[h0p3]]'s nihilistic reality (the only real reality, right?),
        his posts will go over the typical reader's head.

True fans require years of studying the blade to appreciate the depth of h0p3's mental masturbation.
    His deftly woken wiki is not only funny:
        it says something deep about life.
    As a consequence:
        people who dislike h0p3 truly ARE idiots-
        of course they wouldn't appreciate him.
    
I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons,
    scratching their heads in confusion as:
        h0p3's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. 

I pity the fools.
    Wubba Lubba Dub Dub Deeznuts:
        Amen.
