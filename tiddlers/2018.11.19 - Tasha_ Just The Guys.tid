By the way, thank you for music recommendations. I started surfing around The Youtubes' recommendations built on your recommendations too, ha. =)
MON 1:47 PM
Awesome! Hope you found some good stuff
MON 2:45 PM
I’ll send you more if you want
MON 2:45 PM
Of course! Thank you.
MON 2:46 PM
By the way, [[k0sh3k]] just asked me if we are still meeting with Esteban and Matthew or not. We are happy with whatever you all prefer.
MON 2:47 PM
I think so - Esteban is working for another 12 mins so I can text him to hit you up if so. He left at 7 am so I haven’t seen him all day
MON 2:50 PM
Esteban sent you a text message
MON 4:01 PM
Just letting you know since I know you don’t see them as much :slightly_smiling_face:
MON 4:02 PM
Hey, this is [[k0sh3k]]!
MON 4:03 PM
Hi [[k0sh3k]]
MON 4:03 PM
We didn't get the text message; don't know why.
MON 4:03 PM
Hmm
MON 4:03 PM
It'll probably show up at 8:00 tomorrow morning, lol.
MON 4:04 PM
Do you know what the message said?
MON 4:07 PM
I’m asking him now sorry I’m at work as well :see_no_evil:
MON 4:08 PM
Oh, sorry, lol!
MON 4:08 PM
No your fine just trying to help as well and my response time is off and on with this little girl bouncing around
MON 4:14 PM
He said he was just confirming if you. Guys want them to go over there or if you guys want to go over to our place at 6:30 either one is fine but just curious if they go over if they can bring anything.
MON 4:23 PM
Cool! What's his number and we'll send him a message?
MON 4:27 PM
We literally just got his message...
MON 4:29 PM
Phones are weird...
MON 4:29 PM
REDACTED
MON 4:32 PM
Thanks!
