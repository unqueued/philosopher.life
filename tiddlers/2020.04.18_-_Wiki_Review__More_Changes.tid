title: 2020.04.18 - Wiki Review: More Changes

* [[2020.04.17 - Wiki Review: Offspring On Brain]]
** More changes to the structure of our days. 8-12 will be my wife's time. It is reasonable to cover the basics in that space, and I cannot be held responsible for interfering (well, not easily, lol). Wikis at noon, and we jump into my work (much of which just happens in the evening anyway). 
* [[2020.04.17 - TDL: Date]]
** They didn't get the corner. 
** It was a fine day, better than predicted. There was a lot to think about.
* [[2020.04.17 - Prompted Introspection: Interesting Conversations]]
** Edited. [[FTO]] keeps me busy AF.
* [[2020.04.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Game Recognize Game]]
** Completed. Slowly catching up.
* [[Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden]]
** I guess this is a thing now. Cool. Hopefully, it doesn't just fall apart. It might. I'll do what I can here.
** Also, thinking about ways to plant the vine-based plants around the mini hillside behind us.
