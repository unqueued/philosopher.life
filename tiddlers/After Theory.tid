This is clearly pointing out the metamodern dialectic. Postmodernism and critical theory often fail to critique themselves, and this is an attempt to remedy that. Postmodernism deconstructed the world around us all the way down to pure simulacrum; there is no epistemic or ontic foundation on that view. Unfortunately, it is our practical plight to find the semblance of an answer while admitting it can never be the answer we really want. We cannot escape faith.
