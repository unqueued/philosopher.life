title: 2019.04.06 - Prompted Introspection: Nana

!! Tell a memory that you have with one of your grandmothers.

Nana ate her meals faster than I do mine. That is difficult to comprehend. I smash through my food like a poor fat person (she was poor and fat too). Even when I'm trying to slow down for all the excellent reasons, it's fast. She grew up in poverty. Her husband is a ridiculous misogynist, and she lived a trapped life. She was the best of my grandmothers. I'm glad she came to live with us for a time.
