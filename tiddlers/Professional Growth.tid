** Do the riskiest task first.
*** Move fast and break things.
** Repay technical debt.

* Measure what you want to improve
** Tools are multipliers that allow your to scale your impact beyond the confines of a day, snowballing into new workflows that weren't previously possible.
** The higher you climb up the ladder, the more your effectiveness will be measured not by your individual contributions but by your impact on the people around you.
