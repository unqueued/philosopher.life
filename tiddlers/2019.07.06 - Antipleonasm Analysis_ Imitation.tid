title: 2019.07.06 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Imitation

!! Respond to the following [[gem]]:

<<<
Thus, almost everything is imitation...The most original minds borrowed from one another...It is with books as with the fire in our hearths; we go to a neighbor to get the embers and light it when we return home, pass it on to others, and it belongs to everyone.

Preach, yo! Thus, almost ever meme is a copy rather than an original. We probabilistically share, pass, foist, or discover representations of ideas through or with others. Beliefs, desires, and resulting behaviors just are our rhizomatic cultures. Uniqueness comes in [[dok]], as does originality, but even the dialectical processes which led to such things show that basically nothing of what we are (excepting our freewill) is the result of self-caused processes. You can't be original because you aren't [[The Good]], except insofar as you comprise it or are constituted by it.

I'm radically opposed to intellectual property, and I find anti-plagiarism practices disturbing. Make a copy, trace it, dupe it, I don't care: it's yours now. Does that mean you accomplished a task as difficult as the original? No. Does that me the original (or creator of the original) was wholly the cause of its own origins? No. Non-rivalrousness of intellectual objects means we don't ahve a fundamental right to them tout court and all else being equal. Own yourselves, [[others]], and mere things [[irwartfrr]]. IP disputes are for capitalist pigs. Adding friction to the spread of ideas through false accreditations my be a social lubricant in some respects, but it does not help us in the long run. There are other ways to authenticate  in the face of liars these days too.
