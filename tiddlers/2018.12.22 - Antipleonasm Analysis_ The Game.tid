!! Respond to the following:

Always keep your foes confused. If they are never certain who you are or what you want, they cannot know what you are like to do next. Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose, or even seem to work against you. Remember that, Sansa, when you come to play the game.

I must dissect this quote backwards.

What is //The Game//?<<ref "tg">> It's fair to say this is a namedrop trope. Setting that aside, Petyr essentially defines The Game as the pursuit of the Will to Power in the material dialectic. Human pyramids, dog-eat-dog evolution, laissez-faire markets, and Darwinian games don't have to stay forever locked into zerosum games. Each of us really are free to choose to be otherwise. Game-theoretically, if enough players choose to play by [[T42T]], their cooperative structures will defeat everything else. Whose side are you on? If it is just your own happiness, then be a psychopath who can effectively lie to themselves about being the hero of their own story.<<ref "ah">>

His argument to Sansa is itself a realpolitik move! It is purely adversarial advice, even when it is ironically, self-referentially revealing his own strategy (which isn't, in general, usually all that strategic). Indeed, this is a baffling claim. [[Straussian]] and Daoist as ever, this honesty serves his purposes eventually (though not directly it appears). Ultimately, surprise is the means to his end, and that means gaining information advantages in iterated games through strategically chosen sacrificial misdirection. He aims to  impair Bayesian inferential mechanisms.

This is one of the things I [[hope]] to sit in stark contrast to: I'm transparent even when it is deeply inconvenient to me. I don't aim to confuse my foes or those watching. I aim to give the most meticulous account of [[The Good]] and [[The Right]] ever given in human history. I don't just flash one of my cards to you in the hopes you will make a mistake with that information; to the best of my [[fff]] abilities, I'm playing what I take to be the [[T42T]] game with my cards face-up on the table for all to see for every round of the game. It will reveal the monsters and angels among us, and I think it's the only way to solve the snowball of Petyr's and their ladders.
