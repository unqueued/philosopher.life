* If I'm going to have just a single link, I prefer it to be Stunning! =)
* You know, once I finally have 128GB of RAM, this log is never getting done. Mwuahahaha. 
** Already burning up to 20GB on FF on [[m10]].
** I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm still (call me insane) still considering my usual 1-to-1 RAM-to-SWAP. I've lived without Swap before, and 128GB should be just fine and dandy, RIGHT? I've never spent 128GB of SSD on Swap before. I aint got money fo dat.
*** I should not encourage this behavior in myself!
**** This is [[Computer Musings]]. How do I gunkily tag and pigeonhole this one? Hrmm.
* I guess it depends on my mood? Some days, you can't shut me up, and other days I'm just slotting them.
* You know, I don't hate what I've done this month. It's not like it's different than usual. I think I've just come to accept what this thing is.
* I despise how often I cite the NYT. Why the fuck is my diet going this direction?
** Actually, I can't say it is going that way...This is something to dream about. I want to measure that.
* The point in [[2019.02.28 - Reddit Theory & Practice: SSC Vortex]] is a problem. I still don't know how to manage my stack well enough in this wiki (let alone outside it).
* It might be a pile of shit, h0p3, but it's your pile of shit, god damnit. =)
