title: 2019.02.06 - Afterschool Teaching: Chromebooks

Matt is sick. People are dropping like flies. The office manager had the cafeteria sing happy birthday to Whitney. Odd use of power, and Whitney complained about it. I agree it wasn't necessary.

I took the older kids, and Mitchell broke the 5th and 6th boys and girls up too. Whitney took the boys, and our helpers took the girls. 

The older kids do not realize they are engaged in the tragedy of the commons. I'm still letting them chill while they do their work. The kids wanted to use the chromebooks in the class. There are a few gems in this group. 

I have had to argue with several students about the value of reading. Most are proud they don't read.

I sent some folks to get books from the library (waste of time). I could be strict, but I just don't see the point. Some reading got done, homework was finished entirely, some studying for tests too. I'll take it.

We hit the computer lab. 6Df got sick and had to call home. Like flies. =(

We got out early today. Whitney complains about having to do paperwork for 3 kids, lol. I handle 20 usually.  I should be able to handle more.  We both had more today, but it wasn't that bad.
