Yes. This person gets it. I am literally trying to become a cyborg on this wiki. I am deeply invested in stripping away our morally arbitrary characteristics and in the Original Position, wisely wielding my Ring of Gyges. We clearly have disagreements, but I think we share a great deal in common. It's a lot to take in at once. I need to sit on it.

I fear our greatest disagreement is over the nature of philosophy and The Good itself.

The production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now.

I understand the redpilled vortices and problematics of metanarratives. Unfortunately, you cannot have [[The Categorical Imperative]] and [[The Good]] with out it. There cannot be construction alone; we cannot have pure simulacrum. We must oscillate between the modern and post-modern in our bootstrapping toward the truth, a transcendent truth in which we can only have faith. That is our plight. We must oscillate carefully between construction and deconstruction, essentialism and relativism. She is mistaken, but for the right fucking reasons!

This is the best feminist argument I've ever seen. It's primary thrust is egalitarian.
