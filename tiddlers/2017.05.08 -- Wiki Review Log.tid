title: 2017.05.08 -- Wiki Review Log

I was reminded that I forgot to do some of my monthly audits. I suppose monthly audits can be spread across the month. I'd like to do it in a timely manner though. There is something useful about taking in the big picture all at once.

* [[2017.05.07 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** I have yet another happy thing to write about today in [[h0p3's Log]]. I'm glad I have clarified what I'm doing in it.
* [[2017.05.07 -- k0sh3k's Wiki Log]]
** I'm really trying to help k0sh3k start using this tool. I think it will be incredibly useful to her and to us. I think it will make her an even better role model for the kids, and I think it will enable her to see how to help them succeed with this tool as well.
* [[2017.05.07 -- j3d1h's Wiki Log]]
** Arguably, she has made the largest effort in hers. I'm pleased to see it. Give it a year, and it could be an excellent wiki for a person of any age.
* [[2017.05.07 -- 1uxb0x's Wiki Log]]
** He's doing well with what he has. He's growing and improving. I need to continue to encourage him. 
* [[2017.05.07 -- Family Log]]
** This is my favorite iteration of the [[Family Log]] so far. We're not only better at completing it, but it has evolved into having the right sorts of questions. The compliments/positive comments section went well this time.
* [[2017.05.07 -- Diet Log]]
** I actually went out of my way to eat. DCK makes it so I avoid it without even thinking about it. Par for the course.
* [[Homemade Maxims, Phrases, etc.]]
** My daughter came up with "moral fluency" in her wiki. It sparked a neat conversation. I think it's a brilliant phrase for an 11-year-old. Both my children, in many ways, are miles ahead of where I was at their ages. A decade from now, there will be several topics they will be able to speak about/engage in that I will never be able to do even if I tried. That pleases me.
* [[2017.05.07 -- Homeschooling Log]]
** This went so smoothly. When k0sh3k handles discipline our lives are better. I still offer reasons and explanations for why and how they've done something wrong, but I don't have to be angry about it. It's far more constructive across the board. 
** Progress was obvious. The structure maybe isn't perfect yet, but it is improving.
** The general notes section was useful. Perhaps I need a general notes section per child as well. I will contemplate it more.
* [[2017.04 -- Homeschooling Log]]
** I forgot to write an audit of this month. IIRC, there are a few others I need to handle.
* [[The Perfect ARAM Champion]]
** Clearly, I need to think more about the question.
* [[2017.05.07 -- DCK Meditation]]
** I'm leaving the grammar, syntax, structure, etc. as is. I think it is important to preserve the nature of this thing to some extent.
** I'm glad that k0sh3k reviewed it and gave me her comments. It is time that she plays a more active role in shaping me. For quite a while, it was really just me with her support for whatever I thought was best.
