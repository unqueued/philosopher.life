title: 2020.04.01 - Prompted Introspection: Growing Up

!! What did you want to be when you grew up?

[[2018.06.30 - Prompted Introspection: All Growed Up]] is accurate. I had plenty of things I when I was all growed up. Even today, I was thinking: when I grow up, I want to do two chix at the same time. 

I have always wanted to walk in space. What kid didn't want to be an astronaut? I wanted to be someone who experienced being outside the world, looking at Earth from such a different perspective. Movies and books about space and aliens were so important to me, and they still are. I know I won't be able to see space. Hell, I don't think I'll ever be able to visit any other continent again. That's okay though. Maybe this astronautic desire has played and continues to play some sort of role in what I aim for. 

Can't say I've grown up. Still feel like I'm like I'm 12 every day, and I still feel like 12yo [[h0p3]] had to grow up a lot faster than all the other boys I knew. It's what I am.
