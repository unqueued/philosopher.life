title: 2019.12.28 - Prompted Introspection: Thunderstorms

!! How do you feel during a thunderstorm?

It depends on the context (ugh, sorry, but that's so important to answering such open questions). I don't want the power to go out, and I remember that I wish I'd just get an APC I respected. I'm on the lookout for my cats, since I think they will be nervous. I prefer to stay indoors strongly, and I do not like getting caught out in a storm. I despise heavy thunderstorms while I'm in my vehicle. I really like the look of lightning while I'm in a forest, and I like the sound of thunder across deserts. Thunderstorms from a distance are inspiring.
