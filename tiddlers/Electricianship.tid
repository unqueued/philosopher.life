!! About:

//In gratitude to my brother [[JRE]]. While I don't know how much he cares for this wiki, including this directory, I do know he cares about this goal with and for me.//

I believe demand for electricians is high and only getting higher. When Boomers finally start dying off,<<ref "1">> the pool of qualified workers is going to shrink. That will be good for me. It appears to have the highest bar to entry alongside possessing the most depth and breadth of the various major trades. It should have a very steep learning curve for decades to come. That is pleasing.

I'm making the transition from pipefitter to electrician. I hope to still do pipefitting, and a non-trivial percentage of electrical work is running conduit. I should be in good shape. I like being able to enter a new industry while having had some experience out in the field. I'm not totally green, and I know what it's like to learn this kind of topic. I have non-trivial models about the business, practical, and social related issues surrounding these industries. I enter this vortex with some survival tools.

I am going to try to find a way to make my electrician apprenticeship count as time pipefitting as much as I can. I'll eventually, try to join the UA as well. The goal, essentially, is to be able to get jobs in either domain. It wouldn't be an insanely difficult to do plumbing as well. Add in some excavation experience, and I would be very well-suited to a number of tasks. One step at a time though.

I don't know if I'll ever be a good electrician, but I will do my best. I hope to be able to talk shop with my brother about it too. He's already a good one, clearly. He's been kind enough to help me do this, and while unnecessary and insufficient for being the reason for why I'm doing this, I do seek his approval. This isn't a competition; it's literally us trying to help each other survive and thrive as best we can.

I may eventually aim for a specialty, and perhaps I could jump to designing curriculum and/or teaching. I may also shoot for QA work. Importantly, I have options, and due to high demand, I believe I'll be afforded the mobility to work the jobs I feel are moral and in keeping with essential socialist principles. I don't know what the future holds, but this is my gamble.
