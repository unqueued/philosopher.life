My multimeter is not functioning. It was a cheap one. I got what I paid for, according to my brother. That's okay. We'll use the laundromat this week. I've purchased another multimeter, it will be here Wednesday. This one is highly rated amongst users and it was still fairly cheap ($18). I'll find out on Wednesday what part I need, and I'll call shops around the area to see if they the part I need at a reasonable price. If not, I'll buy the part online as well. It will be at least another week before I can fix this. That's okay.
