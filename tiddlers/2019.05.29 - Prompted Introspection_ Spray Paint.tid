title: 2019.05.29 - Prompted Introspection: Spray Paint

!! What is an event that you will never forget from your school days?

I remember being pulled out of class in the 6th grade to go spray paint the basketball court, 4-Square arenas, and the track and field lines. I enjoy spraypainting, but I really wish I had an actual education instead. This isn't up to me, and I'm doing my best to overcome a 3rd world start. I've won a lot of other lotteries though, and I'm lucky to be where I am. I don't know how average people around the world do it.
