I am growing convinced that my TW will eventually fail to be the best tool for the job for me. There is a ton I like about it though. If TW were to continue evolving, (e.g. TWC->TW5), it would become TWASM. Time will tell if Google allows the decentralized web through the browser (I highly doubt it); they may require an approved pay-to-play key to passthrough the VM in many cases, especially if they handle a store or distribution (and, it appears they aim to). 

Unfortunately, I don't understand how WASM is evolving or see where it's heading clearly enough.
