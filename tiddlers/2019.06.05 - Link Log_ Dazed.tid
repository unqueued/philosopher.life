* Think About It
** https://longreads.com/2019/05/31/the-artificial-intelligence-of-the-public-intellectual/
*** I keep seeing arguments about the obligations of intellectuals to the public. I don't know how to prevent the marketing contest.
** https://aeon.co/ideas/there-is-no-middle-ground-for-deep-disagreements-about-facts
*** He only has one book that matters. He became a reactionary, nationalist pig afterward. You must at the same time will the impossibility of censorship while willing everyone to seek [[The Moral Law]]. I'm fine with saying sublation must occur.
** https://supchina.com/2019/03/13/chinas-intellectual-dark-web-and-its-most-active-fanatic/
*** That is too generous to the intellectual dark web which is much further [[pright]] than is presented here. I know almost nothing about China, as usual. This is fascinating.
** https://aeon.co/essays/human-dignity-is-an-ideal-with-remarkably-shallow-roots
*** Uh, that is a terrible analysis. The roots run much deeper. Are you looking at [[The Golden Rule]] memeplex in [[The Great Human Conversation]]? I agree, we have a great deal to learn and implement, and I'll agree Kant is the modern herald. I say this as someone who is open to Shafer-Landau's moral realism, that dignity is a value is a property/relationship.

*** Sounds amygdalic to me. I'm sure I would be accused of it. This is something I face with many [[pleft]]ists. They are not open to this possibility that most people are really evil.
** https://frenziedstasis.org/hyper-stratification-and-cybernetic-capital/
*** Shit. I barely know anyone I think significantly agrees with me.
*** I take it back; they do exist in locales, but those are in virtue of their ideological assemblages. Location in cyberspace is always physical, but I agree the geographic location of users becomes far less relevant (though not irrelevant).
*** Being oppositional is just as important offline as it is online. Dialectics are everywhere in everything, [[ITS]]. 
*** Yes, there is censure and punishments (even micro) for minor things in meatspace. 
*** Social capital might be a misuse of the term, especially insofar as we face non-rivalrous properties of concepts (though thinking always costs something). I do not know how far the parallel goes.
*** Also, I deny you believe something if you don't fittingly act on it (perhaps you change your mind very quickly).
*** Let's us be clear: hate and opposition are not the same thing. Also, something and people should be hated. Clearly, you have no interest in moralism...so archaic, pass√©, barbaric, right? Fuck you. Wanna talk about why you are wrong?

*** We were talking about this. We can dig for far more. You need to reason about how other people perceive you based upon your age.

*** One thing I like about us is that we are preoccupied with a precision regarding the human condition and the computational theory of mind. We aim to be scientists of empathy. We know we are bad at it, and we aim to overcome our weakness. This person is not exactly right, but some of it is spot on.
