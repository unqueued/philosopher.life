title: 2018.10.16 - Guitar: Callus

My calluses are growing. I can finally feel that hardened layer shielding me. It's wonderful!

We played today. I think my son is considering giving up. We had an intense discussion.

My daughter continued working. She has lots of questions about theory, especially since Banjo tab has its own peculiarities. 

My children wanted to focus, so I decided to spend much of my time sight-reading. I started work on //King of the Fairies//. As usual, I think it sounds better faster than my sheetmusic suggests, but there are sections of this song which will take serious work to get up to my preferred speed. There is a lot of variation available to this song, imho.
