title: 2018.10.11 - Polymath Craftsman: Music Stand

Decided to clean off my music stand. Someone jammed the top rod so thoroughly down into the bottom that it didn't seem fixable. Vicegrips and bruteforce did not work. A long screwdriver and some hammering on the inside of the bottom loosened it enough to then pull it out though. Noice.
