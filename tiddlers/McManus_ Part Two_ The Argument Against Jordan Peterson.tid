title: McManus: Part Two: The Argument Against Jordan Peterson

https://merionwest.com/2018/06/08/part-two-the-argument-against-jordan-peterson/

<<<
Jordan Peterson comments on the archetype of the “decadent”: a person who shirks responsibility for their life and assumes that everything that happens to them is the product of social circumstance and bad luck. He characterizes this person, willing to blame others for their lot, as psychologically-fueled by resentment and jealousy towards those who have more than he does.
<<<

Beware those who call for //civility// or wield the //lazy/////envy// prosperity gospel ad hominem. These are classic dark-triadic and reactionary rhetorical plays in the dialectic.

<<<
> when I am faced with a frustrating situation I do not ask myself what I am going to do about it. I ask myself who is responsible for it—and I am always ready to conclude that if the other person were to act properly then the problem would not exist. 
<<<

Ah, and then I conclude that I must resort to revolution to prevent those people from acting improperly! This is excellent advice for Marxists. Do something about it, bitches! Obviously, the ruling class and reactionaries are the problem; it would be better if they didn't exist, wouldn't it? =)

Realpolitik interpretation time, Strauss-take-the-wheel, I think he's taking his own medicine literally here in how he attacks his enemies. What's he going to do about the Left? He's going to be a sophist. How's he going to maximize his personal utility and status? Become a cult leader!  He's //doing// something about it: if only they would act properly, he wouldn't have these problems.

<<<
Interestingly, that primary purpose of The Road to Wigan Pier was to present Orwell’s staunch defense of socialism is ignored by Peterson in his first book and quickly brushed past in the second
<<<

Preach.

<<<
Peterson believes that, rather than blaming others or social institutions for our failings, individuals should look to their own efforts.
<<<

Remember: it's your fault. 

The problem with [[stoic|Redpilled Stoicism]] reframing is that it literally aims to divorce you from reality sometimes.

<<<
 higher intelligence or competitive/aggressive drive, will inevitably lead us to organize into similar hierarchies. 
<<<

His prediction is likely correct. Evolution as a fuzzy zerosum game rewards the dark-triadic emergence unless a sufficient percentage of players radically employ [[T42T]], turn-the-other-cheek [[The Golden Rule]]. [[ridtyawtr]]. Social dominance is likely the best prediction and description of our species, but that doesn't make it the correct prescription. This is also the State of Nature sleight of hand.

<<<
As he sometimes puts it “life is suffering” and “unfair.” Some people will be on top, and others will not.  Other times Peterson invokes the aforementioned meritocratic virtues to suggest that hierarchy is not just inevitable—but desirable. 
<<<

A dangerous rhetorical slide, gaslighting us harder and harder as the crisis builds steam. How else can you tame the revolt of the slaves?

<<<
At times, he aligns it with the individualism of Judeo-Christian doctrine
<<<

That may be an accurate assessment of the Judeo-Christian memeplex and political bodies evolving through the history of our species, but it's a very poor interpretation of the principles at the heart of their holy texts.

<<<
Sometimes he’ll invoke Buddhist and Daoist symbology and mythology to buttress the claim that life can be unfair.
<<<

Whatever it takes to oppress the masses. Was fascinating to see Buddhism as a state religion when I lived in Thailand.

<<<
Liberalism from Hobbes onwards largely emerged as a reaction against traditional Christian doctrine.  Liberals such as Locke, Voltaire and others argued that individuals should reason for themselves, be suspicious of tradition, and look to their private happiness.
<<<

They took themselves to be rebelling against Christian institutions, people, and memeplexes. Christians don't have to care though; they can swallow their enemies. Turn on your Straussian lenses, and you'll see the Progressive Revelation concept can buy Christians almost anything. I suggest postmodern evangelicals employ that concept without integrity, and they fall into a fideistic spiral which functionally results in relativism (even if they ironically decry it). The Rand-Locke memeplex continues to race like a viral epidemic through Christian institutions today.

<<<
 reason was the handmaiden of faith
<<<

A classic question in philosophy. Wittgenstein clearly agreed, and he was a beast! There's a limit to how we can coherentify and search for our axioms.

<<<
Firstly, I am unaware of anyone, even on the far Left, who argues that all hierarchies are inherently unjust and must be eliminated. 
<<<

I'm met purist anarchists who appear to claim this, though their argument seems to fall apart very quickly. I think it's a clear strawman.

<<<
Debates about hierarchy aren’t debates about whether any hierarchies should exist. They are debates about which hierarchies are morally defensible and conducive to aggregate social welfare
<<<

Preach. 

<<<
Simply observing that hierarchies are natural gets us nowhere in such discussions.
<<<

is/ought, and it's meant to be a sleight of hand, imho

<<<
His justifications seem to consist in realizing that life is “unfair,” hierarchy will always exist, and we must simply deal with it. 
<<<

Man up. Stop being a wussy. You're just playing semantics; it is what it is, and you can't do anything about it. It's the gaslighting of stoicism, the diminution of hope, the conflation of description with prescription.

<<<
So, on the one hand, we have fatalism about the status quo—on the other, moralism about merit and getting ahead in contemporary hierarchies through effort.
<<<

That's the reactionary slip. He'll conveniently switch between the two when it suits him. One must always look very closely at a speaker who openly contradicts themselves. What is the motivation for such a thing?

<<<
Peterson is an adept psychologist who offers useful advice to individuals in need of life guidance. 
<<<

wat. Lol. I can't accept false charity here.
