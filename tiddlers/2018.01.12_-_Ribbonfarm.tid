//Legibility// is a key notion in refactoring perception.

The Authoritarian High-Modernist Recipe for Failure:

* Look at a complex and confusing reality, such as the social dynamics of an old city
* Fail to understand all the subtleties of how the complex reality works
* Attribute that failure to the irrationality of what you are looking at, rather than your own limitations
* Come up with an idealized blank-slate vision of what that reality ought to look like
* Argue that the relative simplicity and platonic orderliness of the vision represents rationality<<ref "2019.03.21-0">>
* Use authoritarian power to impose that vision, by demolishing the old reality if necessary
* Watch your rational Utopia fail horribly

The big mistake in this pattern of failure is projecting your subjective lack of comprehension onto the object you are looking at, as “irrationality.” We make this mistake because we are tempted by a desire for legibility.

Legibilizing the state is part of the Statesman's job, clearly. You have to be able to perceive it before you can know what you ought to do. Of course, the above cautions against a flawed pattern of reasoning and monoculture.

High-modernism (which is a seemingly practical attempt at distributing, pursuing, and injecting the illusion of certainty into everything) leads to oversimplification. I take it that post-modernism, in correcting these mistakes, deconstructs the world into a vast complexity that we have no justification or methodology to put back together.

<<<
Complex realities turn this logic on its head; it is easier to comprehend the whole by walking among the trees, absorbing the gestalt, and becoming a holographic/fractal part of the forest, than by hovering above it.
<<<

Well. I would also say that walking in the forest itself also lacks the ideal objective perspective as well. It seems that you need to take up all perspective simultaneously and simplify from there as best as heuristically possible. Obviously, the birds'-eye view is tremendously valuable, even if it fails to pick out all the salient features in virtuous perception.

<<<
the High Modernist failure-through-legibility-seeking formula is a large scale effect of the rationalization of the fear of (apparent) chaos.
<<<

Ah, that is correct. The postmodernist, in a sense, has the integrity to face that fear with intellectual honesty that the modernist does not.

Unfortunately, I'm not so sure Rao escapes the problems of postmodernism either. He does an apt job of moving us from modern to postmodern, but will he have the prescriptive powers and ability to dig us out of that hole? Look, he's obviously a genius. He's going to make moves that are quite practical, but can he see that he's doing that?

American liberal, a cocoon that gently reinforces her self-image as a more evolved, aware, and thoughtful creature than her parochial suburban, beer-guzzling, football-fan cousin
<<< 

Lol. 

<<<
If your preoccupation with race and injustice occupies you so completely that even the parrot cannot dislodge it, then it must be a sad life. In a very real sense, your mind is not free, and therefore neither are you, if there is not even temporary room for the parrot. The parrot can only occupy a free mind. To my list of profundities, I will add the following: a free mind is one which the parrot can occupy easily, and stay in as long as it chooses.
<<<

Ah. I finally see what he's pointing to, at least a fuzzily. Question, is that really freedom, and is that a freedom worth having? It is only free qua parrot, right? You also have a blank-slate assumption embedded in here that we should not accept; it is only the ideal agent that can see without bias. 

<<<
Viktor Frankl said, “between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” 
<<<

This is a phenomenological/existentialist account of freedom. I am moving to the compatibilist end of the spectrum, bit by bit.<<ref "2019.03.21-1">> I worry, unfortunately, that conscious freedom is still an illusion. The best we can do is habituate ourselves to be the kind of person with the disposition to be free qua parrot.

<<<
The Ancient Eye is a precursor to  both the scientific type of imagination that invented diffraction patterns, and a specific kind of artistic eye that can see this way without having ever encountered the idea of diffraction. Possibly it emerges from the very structure of our minds (I once watched a documentary about a math savant who could instantly tell if a number was prime; he apparently “saw” numbers in his head as a sort of landscape, within which  primes appeared in some special way)....the eye of science and the eye of art are both descended from the Ancient Eye
<<<

Homie, you are looking for the concept of //techne//. This doesn't need to be a grand postmodern exploration (although, such explorations should definitely be responding to Plato and Aristotle). The //ancients saw// it long ago.

<<<
A great deal has been written about TED, the elitism it represents and how it encourages a deep-rooted television-science mentality among the best thinkers, by tempting them to pander. 
<<<

Ha. Preach, yo!

Overall, I'm unimpressed by this article. It's gorgeously written, but the content isn't moving.

<<<
I don’t like or use the term scientific method. Instead, I prefer the phrase scientific sensibility. The idea of a “scientific method” suggests that a certain subtle approach to engaging the world can be reduced to a codified behavior. It confuses a model of justification for a model of discovery. It attempts to locate the reliability of a certain subjective approach to discovery in a specific technique.
<<<

Ah, codification worries in virtue theory. May I suggest that you simply agree that we've oversimplified the scientific method, that we've failed to generalize it to all the contexts. A collection of techniques will likely have something in common, and unfortunately, you are going to be forced to agree to its codification, even if this is only in reference to //epistemic behavior//.

<<<
 I believe in methodological anarchy: there is no privileged method for discovering truths
<<<

Ah. You're fucked. There are fundamental problems in epistemology. such as the Foundation problem, that you're claiming to have resolved here. I don't mind skepticism, but you need to be careful. I think you must agree to a set of axioms, and those are privileged by definition.

<<<
The sensibility that informs reliable processes of discovery has a characteristic feature: it is unsentimental.
<<<

No, no, no, no, no. Attempting to seek objectivity and truth is itself sentimental. You cannot escape having that starting place in epistemology. You claim to have escaped Modernism, but you obviously cannot my postmodern friend.

<<<
The scientific method is a sensibility crammed into the mold of a system. It is a an attempt to externalize something subtle and internal into something legible and external.
<<<

You have to be practical, it's the only practical option. More importantly, you are asking scientists to be philosophers. I have no problem with that, but you need to straight up say it. I adore smacktalking the epistemology of scientists too.

<<<
When we objectify discovery into a legible system and a specific method, the subjective attitude with respect to that system and method becomes impoverished in proportion to the poverty of the system and method itself.
<<<

Ah, here is your primary point. Whenever you talk about legibility, I shall pay more attention. 

Yes. This is true. Of course, I see this as an eternal dialectic to iteratively improve upon the codification/objectification of discovery. Clearly, you stand against making modernist moves as legibility tends to oversimplify us into epistemic grids that are fundamentally flawed, bottlenecked, etc. I'm trying to find a metamodern interpretation of your work, Rao. As always, feel free to accuse me of lacking charity.

<<<
To have a perfectly unsentimental sensibility is to be free to look at reality without expectations about what you will see.
<<<

Parrots. I see what you want. You and I both know it can't be had. You are forced into the practical, and I am forced to be idealist (and vice versa). We can only oscillate in dialectic closer to the intersubjective objectivity.

Obviously, we lack the words to grapple with this problem. I'm glad to see you are trying to wrestle with it too.
