We're doing well. Working out the logistics for moving. They are helping us with a relocation agency, and our goal is to be with you and then move the next day.

This week had been horrible‚ÄîIt was diet and freak out most of Monday-Wednesday or eat what I need to survive the long hours and stress

Preach.
Nov 1, 2019 1:31pm
This is the hardest season to diet too. It's insane.
Nov 1, 2019 1:31pm
Sometimes when I have high sugar days, I don‚Äôt eat as much so it could be ok
Nov 1, 2019 1:32pm
That is true
Nov 1, 2019 1:32pm
