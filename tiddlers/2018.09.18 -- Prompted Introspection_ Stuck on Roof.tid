title: 2018.09.18 -- Prompted Introspection: Stuck on Roof

!! Imagine you're stuck on the roof of a house that has been carried away by a flood. Which person would you most like to be on the roof with you?

I have answered this before: [[2018.01.02 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Flood Roof Mate]]. God damn, this is a bleak question. I change my answer! I love when I do that. My previous answer is illogical.

I want someone who needs to die to be on the roof with me. Duh! Why the hell would I want my wife to die with me? Sorry, love. My answer was stupid.

So, who needs to die? This is a tough one. I'm actually not sure who is damaging the world the most by remaining alive. I'm also not sure what kind of impact someone's death might have. Would it be known they died with me on this roof? 

This has to be one of my favorite realpolitik lists I've ever drawn up (in no particular order):

* Bezos
* Trump
* Jinping
* Gates
* Page
* Thiel
* Mercer
* etc.

You get the picture. To my list: fuck you all very much.
