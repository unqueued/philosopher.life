"""
Those who sat in solstice dark, 
Have seen the Light rendering stark;
That we too may incarnate the governing Word;
Though imperfectly stated, and occasionally slurred.

Merry Christmas, [[h0p3]], to you, [[k0sh3k]], [[j3d1h]], and [[1uxb0x]].

Merry Christmas, Ivan. Your words are more timely than you know.  Thank you. I love you.
Dec 25, 2019 9:03am
I've found in trying those words on myself, that I love you too. Please let me know how and when I may be of service.

There are three people in my life who are alone today, and I cannot fill the void in them. Their suffering is raw and visceral today; I can never find the right words for them.

I hope you get to spend today with Selah, and I hope it's one to remember.
Dec 25, 2019 9:19am
Thank you, I will go to her this afternoon.

It's good that these three people know they aren't forgotten today. I trust that your love towards them is meaningfully, and strategically demonstrated. Let's spend our days spreading ourselves thin for the people who are poorly covered.

Aye. I only saw the path yesterday. I have a great deal of ground to cover today in the desert; I hope to catchup and triage for one which I am woefully underprepared. I have to race now.

[[k0sh3k]] loves your words, btw.
Dec 25, 2019 9:55am
Be swift then. Catch you later!
