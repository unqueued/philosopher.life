title: 2018.09.12 - Deep Reading: Fear: Trump in the White House

"He doesn't have a lot of cash," lol. No doubt.

The reason he didn't spend a lot on his election is because he doesn't have anything to spend. We know this.

Here's how I know I've been bit by the hyperreality bug: the book has the confabulatory truthiness that I believe, but I have no idea what's true. It's a whirlwind. The contradiction of believing the unbelievable. We're years into the debacle, and I still feel drowned in it. It's all old and new at the same time. I feel like I'm going insane!

"Trump hasn't spent a second getting ready for this moment." This book is so fucking painful.

I am woefully ignore of Mattis.

I definitely feel powerless with this book. Fear is right.

"Compromat" lol!

Am I just being a masochist in reading this book? I feel called to witness it. I think it's my duty as a citizen to make sure I'm holding up my end of the bargain. I also fear I'm just constantly confirming my bias over and over and over again! 

This book gets a rise out of me; it's visceral. To what extent is this device not justified in doing so? At what point is this rhetoric?

I appreciate that the FBI doesn't "confirm" stories, or at least, I appreciate the justification given here. I really don't trust or like them at all either.

"He didn't look the part" due to his mustache. See, I believe that! The issue of emotional chemistry does seem to be the story here.

I hate to admit it, but just from a "virtue of the practice" standpoint, Trump's trolling can be impressive.

The wiretap on Trump tower tweets...I'm just shaking my head. I have no analysis! This is not what I'm supposed to be doing! I'm not actually learning, I'm just feeling.

McCain is still a piece of shit. Glad I partied to your death, asshole.

Really does believe/want China to love him. I wish we saw more of the psychology here. This feels like one layer deeper than what we were already gleaning from the news.

Trumps tweet are too painful to accept. The contradictions are mind-boggling.

I don't know what isn't a service. I'm supposed to know, but I have philosophical worries about the economic definitions. I have this beef with Marx's taxonomy as well.

"Why do you have these views?....I just do...I've these views for 30 years" KYS! I fucking hate you so much.

Trump's protectionism is exactly what it sounds like. I hate to fucking duck rule this.

"The first daughter" - Jesus!

Trump's thinking about chemical weapons and children is hard to interpret.

One interesting thing about Trump's presidency is that his ignorance has very often revealed to me my own ignorance. In a weird way, I'm grateful to him for that.

Glad that Trump was so angry on May 18th. He's scared. I hope Pence gets fucked too.

Megaphone to the world it is.

I do not understand when Trump decides to listen to people.

Why does he think "Trade is bad"? Is it just plain stupidity? He's painted that way here.

Tillerson isn't a good guy. Wish they showed that here more effectively. Trump talks trash about Sessions, but I wish Sessions also got his ass kicked here.

Aside, I am glad to see Sanders still has a megaphone. 

Of course, I can't point to many politicians legitimately apologizing either. They are all evil in this respect.
