title: 2018.03.30 - Prompted Introspection Log: Sunday Childhood

!! What did your family do on Sundays as a child?

My donors were pastors for the vast majority of my childhood (starting explicitly right after before I turned 6). At 5, I remember attending an African American Baptist church. At 6, MWF was voted on and off the Baptist church island before transitioning to Methodism (mind you, Moody->South Baptist Seminary->New Haven->Mannsville). After that, we hopped around in KY, poor as fuck with 3rd world educations. Sunday was when we did our little dance and earned our keep. After losing my faith, it's been a slowly digested redpill to reinterpret all my interactions and relationships, understanding them for what they really were (refactoring my perceptions).

I enjoyed Sundays often enough, but I obviously had no idea how brainwashed into an insane cult we were.
