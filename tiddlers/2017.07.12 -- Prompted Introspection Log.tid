title: 2017.07.12 -- Prompted Introspection Log

!! Your daughter said she is "afraid to be afraid." What do you think upon reflection?

I'm not sure what it means to be afraid to be afraid. My daughter is very smart, and she is good at making word puzzles up for me at times. When I go to inspect and interrogate the notion, I find she provides a moving target that isn't meant to be rational.

 She said this about canoing. We talked about it, and I think she is worried that any fun, new thing is like that for her. Does that mean we need to continually get her to try new things until that fades? Or is that she has too much of that (I don't think so)? She needs stability, right? I need to ask her more. This is a concept I need her to write about! I must have a well-reasoned dialogue about it with her. I think it is wonderful that she sees this thing in herself. What better way to work on it than by first knowing what it is that you are working on?

That said, what does it literally mean? I think it's a fun phrase.

One could imagine someone being afraid of nothing because they are afraid of being afraid, except of being afraid itself. They so don't want to be afraid that they aren't afraid of anything, except of being afraid. That "the only thing to fear is fear itself" comes to mind, of course. Maybe that was her reference. 

It is super important that my daughter feel confident. She is awesome. How do I help her overcome her fear? How can I help her feel better about herself and pursue her self-interests wisely, passionately, and without undue fear?
