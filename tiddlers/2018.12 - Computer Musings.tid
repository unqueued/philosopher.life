!! Audit:

* This was a heavy month (or it felt like it).
* There are three different [[title.Tag]] sources for this Tag. That's awesome. So many things converge on this. I'm happy to see that I'm going to engage in [[Monthly Audit]]s of these from different angles or log perspectives.
* It's interesting to see a Rabbithole in here. Hm. I have no idea why.
* The switch to Bob has pushed lots of [[RGM]] infrastructure changes, and I've had plenty of headaches. That said: it's been wonderful to have multiple tabs open. That ability alone is worthwhile.
** How many times have I lost progress and trains of thought because I couldn't just fire up another tab?
*** Countless.
* Archer router came back from the grave: henceforth, I dub thee: Lazarus.
* I'm beginning to want a new computer.
** I'm not desperate. It's not yet a need. I'm starting to get all cramped in here.
* I can never say it enough: I fucking hate my ISP. ;P
** Gives me all the warm fuzzies inside to say it outloud. I need to be able to say it. They are straight up evil.
* I'm taking far too long to respond to [[kickscondor]]. This is fucking embarrassing.
** I know he is fine with how long I take. I am not!
*** But, he is fine with it. He knows how fucking busy you've been. Hell, you've seen how busy he's been too.
* I still haven't moved to 5.1.18 or 19. Lol.
* I love routers and tablets.
* The move to Dallas has been a good "downsizing" move.
