{{2018.02.18 - Weekly To-Do-List Log: Keep Trucking}}

---

* I did a damned good job in my work this week. I need to keep it up and expand.
* I didn't have cannabis, but I did drink 3 times this week (with permission). I'd prefer I didn't do that this week. It's the wrong drug.
* I did not deal with IRS problem, and I'm going to wait. That will be next week.
* I got a lot of reading and computer work done as well.
* The kids were very productive.
* Our anniversary wasn't a big to-do, but it was lovely.
* This week was definitely seized.
