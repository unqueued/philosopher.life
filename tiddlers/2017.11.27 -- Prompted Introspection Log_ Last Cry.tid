title: 2017.11.27 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Last Cry

!! When was the last time you cried and why?

I don't recall, sadly. I used to keep a [[Cry Log]] though. It was useful for inspecting when and why I was moved to cry. I also think there are different kinds of crying. I can be moved to tears for happy reasons, just emotional complexity overwhelming sensitivity reasons, as well as negative feelings reasons like sadness or anger.

I know why I cry. I do it often enough. It has certainly slowed down as of late, but that's okay. I think, overall, I've been happier in some respects (although, still not fulfilled).
