Doing well. Took car into shop to get it all checked out, glad to be able to do it. Family Time is beginning soon enough, and it's been a rough week with my daughter, in particular. Will be fun, but some parts will be emotionally expensive.

I'm not reading and writing as much as I should, but I feel like we going to get closer to a groove.
