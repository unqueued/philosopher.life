Welcome to one of the oldest logs on this wiki.<<ref "1">>

I want to be a virtuous craftsman because it's incredibly useful and enjoyable.<<ref "2">> It rounds out my arsenal, prepares me for a variety of situations, and relaxes social requirements on me. 

They say you need a mythical 10,000 hours to become a master of something. I want to master many arts though, and hence I'll need a lifetime. Of course, I'm impatient, but I crave effectiveness and efficiency. I'm also extraordinary at learning when I apply myself. Let's see if my training, natural talent, discipline, and this log allow me to beat the curve. This log is meant to be a mastery acceleration tool and planning device. Keeping a journal or log allows us to be reflective, to plan, to find patterns, to adjust our trajectories, and to see how far we've come. 

The goal is to capture those arts involved in building the standard tangibles of a trade or craft. I'm not sure what does and doesn't count as craftsmanship and the //techne// of yore. It's a construction (ha!), but in time I hope to define it as more than merely building physical objects outside of our minds (few things don't count on such a broad definition).
