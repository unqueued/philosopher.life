!! About:

//I dedicate this page to those glorious German wordies and hermeneutic spiral-tarpits who inspired this tool: Kant, Hegel, and Heidegger. Truth is precise but not always concise.//

I exuberantly write in my own hot-wired language with little regard for the unjustified language conventions of those who aren't listening to (and weren't going to listen to) me in the first place.<<ref "1">> People with sufficient learning will realize I have profoundly listened to humanity; I've empathized deeply with the Great Human Conversation, and without a doubt, most (if not all) of my message is really an extension of yours. I'm not trying to punish the reader with a shibboleth; this is as clear a bridge as I can make (remember: I'm trying to cross this bridge).<<ref "en">>

My work of art is sometimes: dense, verbose, complex, organic, rhizomatic, recursively self-referential, enigmatic, neologized, portmanteauic, caveatic, computational, philosophical, superweird, absurd, constantly evolving, radically unconventional, and wildly unfun to interpret. Often, I am a very poor communicator; I wish it weren't so. I'm doing my autistic best to communicate and become the best person I can be. Here I hope to ease our hermeneutic burden. 

This hlexical [[hlexicon]] is my specialized dictionary to decode some of my inscrutable language, a key to reading my reality map (as well as the patterns arising from it), and my ugly-hackish homemade stencil tool for painting with words. Here you find a significant chunk of my deprivatized personal notation. This metamodern macro-metaprogramming tool is designed to help us play my postmodern language game with as much foundation as I can muster.

I'd like to warn you: I am prone to employ and develop a jargony personal language on this wiki in order to be laconic, unambiguous, and maximize both the space and detail of my expressivity (even if only with and for myself). Sometimes I need to be as exacting with myself as I can be in order to pack just the right punch. Sometimes precision just makes the job easier, but othertimes it enables the creation of something which couldn't have been created otherwise for pragmatic logistical or theoretic reasons. There is a profound flexibility in the objects I can construct and demonstrate when I'm precise with my language, and ultimately, the point is to ungibberishify and justify myself (perhaps paradoxically with gibberish) in order to more effectively shape my identity.

While it may be hard to believe, I'm avoiding intentional obscurantism. I sometimes use my old religious language to compile a new one. I fear and sometimes celebrate that my writing can be fragmented, ignorant, lazy-arrogant, manically impulsive, circuitously redundant, infinitely disjointed, toxically postmodern, drainingly listical, unbearably solipsistic, insularly gnostic, cultically argotic, unacceptably loan-worded, annoyingly calqued, egregiously Nabokovian, sadistly Pynchonian, and way too fucking long. I'm sorry if it fails to add up for you.<<ref "dj">>

Don't get me wrong. I'm climbing the monkeybars of meaning like an especially retarded ape. I know it. Admittedly, I'd like to see you do better. Teach me, master. Let me learn your ways. I need it!

Like a virtuous Orwellian autist, I'm overshooting the golden epistemic mean (in my context) by attempting to become more schizophrenic in how I consciously model my language, which gives profound shape to the possibility of what thoughts I can or will likely have. Crucially, I don't know what's really worth thinking, so therefore I often try to say everything that matters to me and sort it out later. Unfortunately, even then, I can't pick out the universal particulars with maximum salience, but I have to try. Sometimes, taking the time to austically develop my own language really is instrumentally useful to my intermediate schizophrenic goals (which themselves are instrumental to reaching for the final goals of epistemic and ontic self-justification).

I realize there is a madness, perhaps even a kind of memetic violence, to employing an overly particularized patois, especially as I change over time. Of course, I am worried that privatizing my language too far makes it useless or inaccessible to others (and perhaps even eventually myself). In a practical sense, I must break my own autistic code and untangle the web for myself before I could hope to more conventionally encode it for others.
