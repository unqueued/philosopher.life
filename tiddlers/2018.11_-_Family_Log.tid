!! Audit:

* I can tell I've basically given up holding my children responsible in some ways. It's disheartening to see that they don't really give a shit.
** If they decide to try, great. I'm there to support them.
** I will still offer my opinion and basic judgment, but I can't afford to lose my health because they aren't doing their best (or even basic attempts).
** My son has failed himself so many times this month.
*** I've been there (probably still am there).
* I think I'm the only person who really takes daily work in their wiki seriously, though my wife does when it is convenient.
** I'm glad to see she's actually doing her research and planning on her wiki.
* Adults are tired, and the kids are getting enough sleep. Cool.
* My daughter has been doing all the writing this month.
** This has been useful in several ways, and I'm very appreciative.
* Several walks have demonstrated we are making progress, but I still feel like a failure this month.
