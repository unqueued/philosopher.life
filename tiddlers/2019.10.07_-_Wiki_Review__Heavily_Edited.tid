title: 2019.10.07 - Wiki Review: Heavily Edited

* [[2019.10.06 - Wiki Review: Wandflicker]]
** As usual, [[PH]] may go no where.
* [[2019.10.06 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Dining]]
** Edited. Meh. This one sucks.
* [[2019.10.06 - TDL: Mr. K's]]
** My wife asked me to buy another sex toy which will go easier on me. Fair point.
* [[2019.10.06 - Prompted Introspection: Tie The Knot]]
** Edited. It becomes clearer to me. I have fucked a lot of things up, but I'm feeling confident in this one. 
* [[2019.10.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Nappy]]
** Completed. But, those naps made a difference. Even 20 minutes goes a long way sometimes.
* [[2019.10.05 - Antipleonasm Analysis: C Student]]
** Edited. The [[Link Log]] is taking over [[AA]].
* [[2019.10.06 - Family Log: Stop failing]]
** Edited names. Lawdy. We have a long ways to go still. 
* [[2019.10.06 - Link Log: Stahp Him]]
** Edit. Slowly cleaning. The chronology is even more fucked up than usual. Hit 50GB of RAM usage the other night: sweet leak.
*** Also, don't try to open 200 wikis at once. 
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: Orwell Candy Secrets]]
** What candy is most suitable? Gonna need to be wrapped. I still use it to hold my thumbdrives.
