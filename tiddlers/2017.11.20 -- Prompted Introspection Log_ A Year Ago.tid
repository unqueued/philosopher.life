title: 2017.11.20 -- Prompted Introspection Log: A Year Ago

!! How is your life different now from just a year ago?

I was extremely depressed and broken a year ago. I'm far less so of each, as you can see on this wiki. Don't you think so, Lady Melisandre?<<ref "1">> 

I have a plan, I have hope, the world and myself makes more sense to me, and I'm happy to be alive. Everything feels different to me. My life is different too. 

We have a financial gameplan and stability, my children are happy, and my wife and I continue to grow together. It's been a damned fine year, one of the best of my life.
