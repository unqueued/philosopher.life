//Redaction, Link Autocompletion, & Other Hawt Substitutions//

I've never learned to write with heavily integrated, highly-tailored autocompletion. I am a fast typist, but this could bump me to the next level. Linting and autocompletion for natural language in my TW is not going to be easy, but I think making it a habit to construct this tooling will [[ltf]]. There appear to be TW specific rules that I might be able to enumerate, and there could be far more automation eventually build directly into the wiki itself.

https://joshuafontany.github.io/TW5-JsonManglerPlugin/ -- What if selected [[Alias]]es and names could be adjusted? This could go very far. There are limits, but this makes a different driver's seat. This will have to be a hand-grown list, but some automated tooling to build the json would be nice.

Cursor placement is not as good in this as it is in [[Text Blaze]]. 

I am worried that some of these will be counterproductive. Tagging and searching ain't gonna like these, Yogi. I have no idea if this is going to help as much I [[hope]]. There are some very fine lines here, exceptions, etc. I'm not even sure I'm going to love this autocompletion. Let's go hogwild to figure it out though. I hope to build a toolset that will last me for a long time. There are some race-conditiony contradictions in my list too.

This feels like ghetto VIM/Emacs, doesn't it?

Python script parses index.html to find the most common single word links, including `[[foo|`? possibly but definitely `[[foobar]]`. Might as well do the top 400, leaving room for 100. Note sure how to handle [[Alias]]es. Should be automatically formatted in this json/dictionary format.

What mechanics do I want to ease? What syntax am I tired of writing (with no exceptions)? What names am I willing to always link every time?

```json
{
  "Godel": "Gödel",
  "Philosophical Analysis": "Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση",
  "d8": "%d(YYYY[.]MM[.]DD)",
  "invchar": "​",
  "philosophical analysis": "Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση",
  "uberme": "übermensch"
}
```
