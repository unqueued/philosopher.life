* What did they not respond to in my first letter? Think about it.
* Provide a damned good, highly cited answer. Show your work!

This is about my self-dialectic. It's one of the radically fundamental problems in philosophy, and a profoundly difficult computational problem. I really want to program myself wisely.

I'm looking for the telic structures which emerge from links. I fear tags do not actually help much in this respect. Often, when I would want to tag, I would also just like to plain search my wiki for particular phrases and terms. Labeling is superduper hard, and if I label incorrectly, if I fail to model, it will fall apart.
