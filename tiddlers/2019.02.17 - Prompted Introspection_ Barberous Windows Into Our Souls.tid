title: 2019.02.17 - Prompted Introspection: Barberous Windows Into Our Souls

!! Describe an incident at a beauty or barber shop.

Presumably, you mean an incident I have experienced in an actual shop. Dude, I'm poor. I have never been to one. My hair has always been cut at home. I'd rather have a book, a computer, or food than a haircut.

I have had girls put makeup on my face, and I was so beautiful. You have to really scrub the foundation into my face to get through my whiskers. Anything coming close to my eyes is pure torture though; I can't even watch other people work around their eyes because it triggers the phenomenology so strongly in me. My wife teases me every chance she gets. I will weep (literally) for you brave souls who put on your warpaint out of necessity. Similarly, there is a 90% chance I'm going to start tearing up if I see you cry; it leaps out of you into me. It makes it hard to man-up and look tough in Southern cultures in which men are certainly never allowed to do this.
