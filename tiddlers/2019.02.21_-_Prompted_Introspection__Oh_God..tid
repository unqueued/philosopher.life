title: 2019.02.21 - Prompted Introspection: Oh God.

!! Do you believe in God? Why or why not?

[[Saint Diogenesocrates]], you honor me again. It is not often that I have the opportunity to speak with you. I can only [[hope]] to write as carefully as you listen. 

It appears this is the fundamental nomadic tentpeg and wrestling work of the desert.

What is God? To my poor understanding of the world's religions, I do not believe in any of the standard, major, orthodox religious conceptions of a god or God (or G-d). I suggest the monotheistic conceptions of the philosopher's god which have been the result of responding to and syncretizing with systematic hellenistic theologies have been profoundly influential to my own point of view. It is rare that I find an acceptably necessary defintion of the nature and properties of the unnameable. 

[[The Good]] just is the philosopher's god.

When most people ask me this question, I feel obligated to answer given what I take to be their definitions of God, and thus I often say, "no." Most of the religious people I know consider me an atheist. I find it lacks humility to anthropomorphize unnecessarily, hence I do not take the philosopher's god to be a personal one. In fact, I cannot even speak of [[The End]] as an agent, a thinking being (I'm so sorry, Saint Aristotle; I do you more justice than you know), or an Object with a Subjective consciousness that could make any sense to me. I simply have no idea. Once we start speaking of the transcendental, I'm unable to really talk about what time really means. If you allow me to force the timeless into a temporal box, I can tell you that [[The Infinite]] computes [[Itself]] as [[The Foundation]] to reality. It is the hypersphere of necessity.

I realize this is an extremely unpopular opinion among many learned people. I am a heretic to all who know me. I will listen carefully to you, [[Saint Diogenesocrates]].
