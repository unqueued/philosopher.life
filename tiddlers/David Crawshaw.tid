** I ain't no expert, but some of those Go tools look outstanding. I'm impressed.
** Clearly, very skilled.
*** OCAML, Scala, Golang, and lots of languages (a sign of an actual programmer)
* Left Google
** Likes Fuchsia (wat)...
** I'd be interested to understand why. As usual, I hold people accountable for who they are and how they reason.
* Sydney (though, his accent feels relaxed to me)
* Math and History =) Noice.
** Interestingly, it is hard to find him expressing much about humanity, though he talks about code quite a bit (he is an expert).
* Lots of The Youtubes talks

** WBM is the only way to surf this site. It changes and hosts some, then blanks.
** Programming productivity, rockets, satellites, servers, history of ideas
*** Not openly for most of these
** Works against complexity (but in what!?)
