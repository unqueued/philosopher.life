title: Getting Outside the USA

The US is in civil war, and I'm still convinced we're in WWIII (though war might need to be defined differently today). It's the elite vs everyone else, and unfortunately, The Right (not [[The Right]]) and the Left are being sublated in the material dialectic as they wrestle with each other. A tiny selection of The Right is emerging even more strongly as the masters of the rest of our species yet again.

The poor are being eaten alive and thrown away like garbage. There is little hope here.
