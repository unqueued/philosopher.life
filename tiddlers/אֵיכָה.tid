title: אֵיכָה

Who wails this scarlet widow dirge? Your lamentations are splintered weeping.

You disobeyed your master, you worthless whore: you deserved your rape. Your Father humiliates you, Zion, because you were a slut who failed to respect her owner. Obey or suffer! God is your enemy and your savior; He is your psychopathic creator. You can't hate God once you believe you understand Him. You've brought this on yourself; you don't hate yourself nearly enough. You will say:

<<<
Master, I deserved your rejection before. Please, take me back. I'll be a good girl. I beg you not to abandon me!
<<<

You have Stockholm syndrome. Submit to God's power; you know His merciless destruction is itself mercy. Delude yourself with doubletalk.  He manipulates you into begging for your own enslavement. This is your rationalization, a coping method. You eat your children because God is eating you.
