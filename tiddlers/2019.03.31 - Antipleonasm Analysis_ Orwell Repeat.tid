title: 2019.03.31 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Orwell Repeat

!! Respond to the following gem:

Pointing to the massive amounts of propaganda spewed by government and institutions around the world, observers have called our era the age of Orwell. But the fact is that Orwell was a latecomer on the scene. As early as World War I, American historians offered themselves to President Woodrow Wilson to carry out a task they called "historical engineering," by which they meant designing the facts of history so that they would serve state policy. In this instance, the U.S. government wanted to silence opposition to the war. This represents a version of Orwell's 1984, even before Orwell was writing.

I don't have a word for this feeling of someone not being surprised and yet still being shocked. It's an inconsistency in me, a form of cognitive dissonance, and a reminder that I still don't know what I think I know all-too-often. I have seen this in how textbooks are written for public schools, and the interwebs brings its own varieties of memetic warfare. It is painful to see us reliving a history I do not know. Aint nobody got time to study it all; I couldn't catch up to [[Saint Chomsky]] even if I wanted to. These people put me to shame.
