title: 2018.05.01 - Deep Reading Log: A History of Western Philosophy

I've worked my way up to Dante's time. It's kind of breathtaking to see the history of the Catholic church through this lense. I vaguely remember this from my Western Tradition and history classes over the years, as well as readings over the past decade. 

I'm impressed by Russell's profound charity with people he clearly disagrees with. He also tells it like it is, calling hypocrites out, etc. I hope that I will be able to have a similar point of view when all is said and done for me as well.
