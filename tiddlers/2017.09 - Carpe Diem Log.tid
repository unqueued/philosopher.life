How I usually do it:<<ref "2018.12.03">>

* Woke up before the alarm
* Worked
* Listened
* Talked
* Ate
* Maybe a Show
* Fireman time!
* Bed

Okay, back to it:

* Cannabliss is wonderful
* DCK is worth it
* Talking to my family is awesome
* My days are monotonous and deeply compressed
* I actually have benefited from the routine.
* There are days where I try to contact everyone I care about. Why?
* We've had some good shows this month.
* Audiobooks have kept me sane.
* Sleep has been amazing. I need to make sure I do.
* My family helped me a lot this month with prep.
* I am in debt to my daughter and wife in particular for cooking this month.
* Pizza fell off the map.
