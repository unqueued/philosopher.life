title: 2017.12.30 - Prompted Introspection Log: Sleeping Outdoors

!! Tell about a time you slept outdoors.

My favorite was sleeping on the back patio with my wife. I know you didn't ask about my favorite, but this one just jumps out at me. I treasure it.<<ref "2018.12.24">> We lay down blankets in very late fall, cold enough that it was almost winter. We snuggled, banged, and I felt alive outside with her.

<<footnotes "2018.12.24" "I hate to say it, but that is not my wife anymore. She would never do that again. Her conservatism and inability to rationally override her emotions makes these kinds of special moments rare. That's okay. I can see why she has grown this way, I can appreciate it. I love her, and I will continue to treasure this memory.">>
