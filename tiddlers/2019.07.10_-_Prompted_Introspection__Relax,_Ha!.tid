title: 2019.07.10 - Prompted Introspection: Relax, Ha!

!! What do you do to relax?

Roflmao. What is relaxation? I'm going to kick complete ass at it. I've tried answering this before: [[2018.07.19 - Prompted Introspection: Relaxing Destination]]. 

Speaking of which, I still haven't completely picked up [[How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy]], so I must already doing it right, right? Actually, I got several pages into it, and I realized I was going to need to wrestle with the person's metaethics; I have a hypertelic view which is not easy to swallow for that author, imho.

I don't let go often. I let go during sexual intercourse, right before I fall asleep, sometimes in meditation, and that might be it. Otherwise, I'm usually trying to get in the zone, talk about what matters, attack problems, or do something meaningful with myself. Of course, cooling off, chillaxing, and so forth is necessary, but as a means to [[The End]]. This is unpopular among many people, but they often have not fully understood the implications of what it means to fight against capitalism's commodification.

It is very convenient to relax. I am wary of those who do not believe they owe the world a great deal in the name of such pleasure. It is rare that I find someone who I think should relax more, rather I think most people choose not to justifiably {[[Focus]]} themselves.
