Danforth now

It's a Lil lonely. Getting out for this exercise has been good.
Dec 17, 2019 7:22pm
Aye.
Dec 17, 2019 7:23pm
How are you sir?
Dec 17, 2019 7:27pm
I need to get some exercise too. Lol. I get a walk in, and that's pretty good for me.
Dec 17, 2019 7:27pm
We're doing well.
Dec 17, 2019 7:27pm
I am excited and scared for you. I hope you take some photos. I've never seen Yale campus other than pics online.
Dec 17, 2019 7:30pm
I'll ask [[k0sh3k]] to take some photos (she's into it). Don't let me forget. Probably nothing special is my bet. But, I'm excited and scared too.

I haven't read your wiki in some time. Life is busy. I move into my new apt on the 1st.
Dec 17, 2019 7:33pm
aye, doing the motel thing until then, right?
Dec 17, 2019 7:34pm
But much shorter drive. Resisting the urge to meet other women while alone is gonna be hard. Lol. But I can manage it. Concentrate on exercise and health and hobbys.
Dec 17, 2019 7:34pm
We move about the same time.
Dec 17, 2019 7:34pm
Glad that the drive is sane.
Dec 17, 2019 7:34pm
Yeah. Been drinking too much. I really wanna get somewhat sober
Dec 17, 2019 7:34pm
Sounds like a damned good set of goals too.
Dec 17, 2019 7:34pm
I'm inebriated right now, lol. Medicinal is fucking legal in CT though, so hopefully it will be easier to break for me.
Dec 17, 2019 7:35pm
That would be amazing. I am jealous.
Dec 17, 2019 7:38pm
But I get my own apt alone. Kinda like being separated. Lol
Dec 17, 2019 7:39pm
I don't know if it's a win or lose.
Dec 17, 2019 7:39pm
Hopefully, you can voice chat or video chat every day. That may help.
