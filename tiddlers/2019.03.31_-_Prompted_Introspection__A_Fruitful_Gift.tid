title: 2019.03.31 - Prompted Introspection: A Fruitful Gift

!! Describe a favorite letter you have received.

[[2017.12.09 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Letter]] makes me cry again. God damn. She has been through thick and thin with me. I'm grateful to have our [[Family Log]] as a ritual in our family time because it provides a semi-formal space in which to thank her and to show the kids what [[love]] really means in how I explicate her character and behavior (while constantly pointing out that I can barely put even a semblance into words). I love how the compliments are sometimes the openings of speeches. This letter is an opener.

The letter, in this case, conjures more fading memory and bursting emotion than I'm going to be able to accurately express to my family. I desperately need my children to know what a lifepartner looks, feels, thinks, and acts like. She's a rolemodel to us. Despite the codification problems I face, she makes it easy to point-teach for them what it means to be a [[good]] human. 

This letter is a sign of a covenant. It's grace, kindness, patience, and empathy. She will always be the gentle person I [[hope]] they become. May they never need the weapons I hand them for the desert. She humbles me (and that is no small task). I'm a brute compared to her elegant and noble [[salience]]. In some contexts, all I know is violence, and all she knows is healing. She has the higher gift.
