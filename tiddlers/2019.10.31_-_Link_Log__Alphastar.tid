*** I am disappointed that it's not really mastering something from zero human knowledge. Of course, their own hand-crafted bot is going to be sick.
*** They might be moving onto another project, which I would take as a sign they don't think they can actually succeed. Failure, I believe, would be badpress and not make them as much money.
*** Maybe in a sense they are generating and hunting [[Pavlov]] in its various orders.
*** I adore how they attempted to make it more humanly realistic. I would also be interested in absolutely perfect play. What does perfect micro look like? That is what we'd really be up against anyway. Why aren't more people interested in that? The "won in virtue of" might give bad press, taint it in a way, as there appears to lack some kind of justice in a sense. 
*** Yes, I'd love to see Civ played out. Hell, I'd love to see it play it play raids in Everquest, easily the most time-consuming game I've ever seen, with absurd punishments (kids these days don't even know what it means to travel for a day so you could actually kill something in the destination zone the next day, let alone what a corpse run entailed).

*** If I achieved a tenth of that articulacy, I'd be proud of myself.

*** Reduced to culture wars, check. Fine contrived non-committal descriptions in here, as usual, love the story-telling. Now, are you going to have the integrity to look at Marx's historical analysis of material dialectics with charity? Moloch, no. This too is mere zeitgeist, inauthentic, especially not justified, and nothing really matters. 
**** And, of course, you see the flaw in Marx at least implicitly: you have to do metaethics and metaphysics (too religious for a scientist masquerading as informed cultural critic and philosopher). Sounds like you've been playing the game you describe here for a long time too, homie. Reactionary sheltering his egoism in a shell game.
***** I too, of course, my dear, have unsubbed from such non-sense and riff-raff, lol.
*** My favorite part is that you imply you can avoid being swept by any (meta)narrative. So above it, you're not religious at all either. =). Lawdy. I still get along better (even when I'm fighting) with the schizotypal poets.

*** Found my ode to beer simply because I got wingdinged.

*** An experiment I want to see unfold. Huge number of readers for the number of comments, usually a terrible sign.

*** I don't even know where to begin. It's chilling to see evil speak the truth where others do not and then lie so hard. A good capitalist and crypto-reactionary knows Marx's basic claims, but they use that hypothetical imperative as a springboard toward egoism. You must choose an end for it.
