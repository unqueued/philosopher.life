*[[i3 Config]]
** Might want to tag it, homie. Doesn't have to be in the wiki unless you want it to. We need to share it for now until you have more control over your device.
*** How are you liking //rofi//? Does some nifty things.
*[[Notage Ti.10]]
** Thank you for attempting to take notes. I am very grateful that you would do so.
*** Today, with your sister's teacher, I took notes as well. It's a skill you will find exceptionally useful if you can't remember the complete conversation (which is fair to say about most everyone, right?).
*[[Re-write]]
** Fascinating! This is your own idea. I like it a lot. I think you should make sure it isn't orphaned (or even nearly orphaned). Try to have at least one place in a hierarchy to put it for now (even if it's super messy). Maybe tag it with a parent tag/directory you want to create (or two). 
*[[2020.03.18 – Wiki Review: Acronymical.]]
** That was my fault. Sorry. We did make up for it though.
*[[2020.03.18 – Prompted Introspection: Da-da.]]
** They would not kick me out for being a [[pleft]]ist, though I'm certainly shunned for it. There were other arbitrary considerations that would get me kicked out though.
** You are too kind. Thank you. I am not that [[good]], son. 
*[[2020.03.18 – h0p3ful Review: Rewriting]]
** I adore that we have [[MTG]] decks as metaphors for languages and conversation trains.
*[[2020.03.18 – Antipleonasm Analysis: (Re-write)]]
** I'm quite a hypocrite at times too. You must point that out as well. Let us be fair.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 5, Draft 1]]
** I would call it a //Rough// Draft. There's good work in here. Continue, sir.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Your mom and I are worried about your grammar. You are always going to be below grade-level in some areas (which is fine, right?). You have to practice communicating correctly given the particular conventions and rules of various societies (and learning new rulesets). Neither of us will be excellent at this, but it's necessary for our survival. Keep pushing, sir. You are better at it than I was at your age. Don't give up.
