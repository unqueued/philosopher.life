This is a unique page. I'm not sure its status. It's like I'm trying to hand you top security read+write clearance of my art, but you already had that with my life. I don't mean this as a useless gesture.

I see marriage as a covenant between two people.<<ref "1">> I literally gave my life to you, and you gave yours to me. Corporations aren't people, but we're trying to be one person. We own each other, and in love, we cultivate and program each other. That is our commitment to each other. If I could "renew" my vows, it would be in the spirit of the knowledge of what it means to have a right to shape the other. Essentially, we aren't individually autonomous in marriage, we help each other make decisions about who we are and will be. This made sense at a practical level, but the theoretical issues have now been highlighted for me. I really do love you, and I want you to mold me into a person you want me to be. I trust you.

I hope this is a place where you work on me and where I listen to you. In a sense, this wiki is for both of us. I want to shape it into something we both love. Help me do that, please. I think you not only have the right, but even the duty.
