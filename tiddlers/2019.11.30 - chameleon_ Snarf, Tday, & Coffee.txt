[12:11 PM] h0p3: Hope you have a great Thanksgiving!
[1:40 PM] chameleon: And yourself! My first over here, hehe
[1:50 PM] h0p3: I like holidays in which eating is mandated, integral to celebrating it. I kinda hope you get a traditional thanksgiving meal this go around.
[10:15 PM] chameleon: Holy shit you finished your letter to death of robinhood
[10:15 PM] h0p3: Rofl, only took me 5 months!
[10:16 PM] h0p3: I think he has been following closely because he just sent me his number today, and I sent him my address and number.
[10:16 PM] h0p3: That letter turned out way, way longer than I thought it would.
[10:17 PM] h0p3: I am trying to write something awesome to you as well, and I hope it won't be 105 pages, lol.
[10:17 PM] chameleon: Hehehe
[10:17 PM] h0p3: Please tell me you got to have stuffing and gravy.
[10:18 PM] chameleon: I did! Round my inlaws
[10:18 PM] chameleon: I got super lucky to have such nice inlaws
[10:20 PM] h0p3: Noice. It's great to have inlaws that enjoy being with you. I don't think most of my in-laws care for me, but my uncle [[Charlie]] is a way cool dude (and a hermit).
[10:21 PM] chameleon: The cat and I had a Moment

[10:21 PM] h0p3: I hope you will be able to see your immediate family, especially your mom and dad soon (that shit aint cheap).
[10:21 PM] chameleon: They're probably coming over in the new year
[10:22 PM] h0p3: Noice.
[10:32 PM] h0p3: I adore having a cat in my lap. Chairman Meow is most likely to spend time with me.
[10:33 PM] h0p3: That's a very pretty one in your lap. Looks right at home.
[10:33 PM] chameleon: She was acting like a ragdoll cat haha
[10:37 PM] h0p3: http://live.philosopher.life/chameleon/ -- I much prefer qTox for this, btw! Please tell me when you have the image, as I will be taking it down.
[10:42 PM] chameleon: Snarfed c:
[10:42 PM] chameleon: Into the vault lol

[11:38 PM] h0p3: Still trying to work a way out there. Coffee would be cool! :slight_smile:
[11:44 PM] chameleon: love me some coffee
[11:44 PM] chameleon: we have a starbucks near me
[11:45 PM] h0p3: How do you take your coffee? (I drink it black and cold from the fridge)
[11:47 PM] chameleon: depends on how it's prepared or where I'm getting it from :slight_smile: but usually black
[11:47 PM] chameleon: at home I make it with a french press
[11:47 PM] chameleon: and drink it fresh
[11:48 PM] h0p3: That is how my wife does it too.
[11:50 PM] h0p3: I'm not able to tell the difference between coffees so well, but I like the press more than the coffee machines we've had.
[11:51 PM] h0p3: My wife would enjoy a con quite a bit (and if they have a Magic tournament, so would I, lol).
[11:59 PM] chameleon: the hubs has been getting me into mtg
[11:59 PM] chameleon: I'm sure you could get a game in a gathering of nerds, lol
[11:59 PM] h0p3: Oh no, you will never escape that blackhole.
[11:59 PM] chameleon: Nerds: the Gathering
[11:59 PM] h0p3: Truly
[11:59 PM] h0p3: We could play digitally too. Cockatrice is well designed.
[12:00 AM] h0p3: There is something wonderful about holding the cardboard though.
[12:01 AM] h0p3: Does The Abyssal play often, and do yall have a playgroup you get to meet up with for that game?
