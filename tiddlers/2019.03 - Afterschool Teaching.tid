!! Audit:

* These feel much briefer to me. I think my modeling is becoming accuratized. I'm not as surprised. There's less to digest.
** Now it feels more like a log to me.
** No, some of this still houses plenty of surprise.
* A lot of people have been feeling sick this month. =(
* I'm not convinced that my bringing resources usually helps. There's a few students who stand out.
** I have to find ways to reverse the 80/20.
* I'm glad I don't have to speak with adults too often.
* All-in-all, I have found people I like. That's uncommon.
** It's also a result of maintaining distance by design.
* Mitchell makes life better. He's a powerhouse.
* I see a lot of stress everywhere around me.
** The janitors are pretty chill though.
* I'm not going to censor how kids use their computers, but I will continue to offer the disclaimer. 
* I'm trying to help the kids develop reasonable strategies for breaking unjustified rules wisely and in justified manners. 
* It is always weird to be called "Mr. [[h0p3]] (first name)." 
** I think some of my rebel students actually mean it. I'm going to keep treating them like young adults, like my own children.
* I think I have continued to establish that I'm interested in taking the kids who want quiet time to read, write, talk, play board games, and use machines.
