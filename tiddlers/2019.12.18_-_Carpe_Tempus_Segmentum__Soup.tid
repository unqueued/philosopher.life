* Woke at 7:30
** Not enough, but it'll work.
** My wife did not sleep well. =(
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* Clean and pack

** Interesting that he had been in the neighborhood before. Quite a distance.
* Coffeebliss
* Clean and pack
** Back is complete!
* Cavan and I talked at length.
** Discussion of his work, where he's from, his baby. 
** He was down for some refreshments. 
** has number, hopefully he'll take up Signal and Resilio so I can send him books and shows.
*** His wife loves to read too. He asked me for recommendations. As usual, I am not qualified, but I'll try.
** He says they have no paint (since matching is impossible after the buyout). Said I didn't even need to spackle, etc. I'd still prefer to get it as clean as I can.
** He reminds me of a comedian, but I can't put my finger on it. He's down to Earth. 
*** His buddy joined us and we talked about Linux (their idea). They want to get laptops and throw Linux on them. Cool. 
* More VM work
** Likely an iptables problem for dat inside Whonix. Firewall poked, port reachable. 
*** Not worth wasting the time of gurus on this. They have their hands full after walking through their meeting notes.

* Dialecture
* Offspring made the soup.
** I like their improvisation when it turned out we didn't have cinnamon.
* Dialecture
* My brother [[JRE]] called me up.
** My brother should teach the union classes. He's by far the most qualified, and his arguments are even better than I can make on the spot. 
** Talked about the Chesterton quote and a meme about facts with respect to a coworker who knows his ex. 
*** Oh look, a recursion! Lol.
** My bro has been wrestling a lot with his relationship.
*** I walked him through my failure, and pointed out that I thought he was being hard on himself by comparison.
** Curious about [[Laurel]]. 
** Noted that I'm taking a longer time to post chats. I don't know the best interval.
