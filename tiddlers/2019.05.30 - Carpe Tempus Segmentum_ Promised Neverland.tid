title: 2019.05.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Promised Neverland

* Fitness Routine
* The Promised Neverland
* Worked with kiddos on VMs, CH, and AHK. They are different problems to work through.
* Fruit, nuts, veggies, and vits.
* Read+Write
* Finished [[Introducing Baudrillard: A Graphic Guide]], [[Circe]], and [[Greek & Latin Roots]].
* Dialecture
* BB
* The Promised Neverland
* The offspring made dinner with me. Watermelon, grilled cheese, and tomato soup. I also made some salisbury steak.
** I am so lucky to have food to eat, and watermelon season is the best. They are $3 again, and that is both affordable and delicious. 
* Got drunk
* Sleep by 1ish?
