title: 2017.04.26 - Realpolitik Speculation: Trump Administration's Gridlock

About a month ago I wrote about Rex Tillerson, [[2017.03.22 - Realpolitik Speculation: The Second Cold War]]. I suggested that Rex would likely push to lift sanctions on Russia for oil money. Today, he claims he will not be lifting these sanctions. What can I say? I am still watching political theater. Here is where you get to call me out of uncharitable conspiracy theorizing, as though no amount of evidence will exonerate my enemies.

The Trump administration is under intense scrutiny, particularly with respect to Russia. Ivanka is running defense for her father, poorly at that. Perhaps Rex Tillerson is now playing defense as well. I know that if I were possibly facing serious collusion/treason charges, I would hope to appear, at least at face value, like I had no intention of helping Putin or benefiting from being in a symbiotic relationship with him. 

Rex is an absentee Secretary of State. It is far from clear he is legitimately trying to do anything like the job he's supposed to do. He must deflect and deny that he has any involvement with Russia in the current political climate. This is one key way to appear clean. For now, I'm convinced his words are empty cosmetics. The red flags are still there. The successful capitalist, con artist, is simply telling us what we want to hear to get us off his back. I'm still convinced he may attempt to lift these sanctions if the opportunity arises. 

Putin seems to have no intention of handing back Crimea.<<ref "1">> Is Rex running some power play against Putin? Probably not. In any case, given this administration's ability to literally get away with contradicting itself on a daily basis (I'm not exaggerating), it doesn't seem impossible for Rex to publicly change his mind without serious penalty. Presumably, he simply needs the right moment for it. Given the scrutiny, it may never come to fruition.  Alternatively, there may be other contrary trades here with lower risk but still significant rewards for Rex. 

Regardless, one thing is clear: despite the obstructionists and Russian collusionists, parts of the US government are pursuing an investigation into the Russian intervention in US politics.<<ref "2">> It is forcing the Trump administration to alter its course (not that they had an incredibly well-thought-out gameplan to start with). Trump's initial gameplan has all but halted (or he has run out of ideas), it seems.

It is no secret that Trump has not actually accomplished much of anything directly (beyond the flood of executive orders). His alt-right driven dismantling of the executive branch and consistent political fumbling have acted as a thin veil (transparent to most, but opaque to his supporters) enabling him to fleece the American people for his own personal benefit. As he said during his campaign, he has no interest in domestic or foreign policy (lol). Not accomplishing anything directly may be just fine to him. Unless something changes, it seems like we are in gridlock as he attempts to bleed us. 

My worry is that he will continue to raise the Spectacle Specter for us over and over again. Appearances are most of all that matters to the man. He will misdirect the dumbest of the American people as he attempts to pick our pockets (even while many of us stare right at him as shamelessly does it). One Specter many are worried about is a more direct war with North Korea. There continues to be plenty of saber rattling, and preparations appear underway. It seems to be a distraction //the people need.//<<ref "3">> Nothing unites stupid and scared "patriotic" people more behind the powers of evil than the "glory" and "necessity" of war. People are idiots and psychopaths.

Speaking of North Korea, without a doubt, China seems more than happy to line the Trump Family's pockets. If Trump does give up on Putin, perhaps it will be for China (or whoever can hold his attention). I would not be a happy South Korea at this time. It is even clearer now why Trump torpedoed TPP, as I talked about before: [[2017.01.23 - Realpolitik Speculation: TPP]]. Both China and Russia seem to have enormous influence over a man who can obviously be bought.
