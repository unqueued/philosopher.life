`/salute`, hope you are doing well, sir
Feb 23 5:44pm
Hey man. How are you doing? I hope Yale is treated you guys well
Mar 4 12:55pm
Heyas! Sorry, been a busy day.
Mar 4 8:45pm
I'm doing well. Health is better. We're getting back into a groove over here.
Mar 4 8:46pm
Working hard with my offspring.
Mar 4 8:46pm
[[k0sh3k]] is enjoying her job at Yale. It's a much better environment for her.
Mar 4 8:46pm
How about you?
Mar 4 8:47pm
Glad to hear that. Having a job you don't hate is a big freaking deal
Mar 6 4:39pm
I'm guessing you're in charge of the main share of the homeschooling?
Mar 6 4:40pm
Yes.
Mar 6 4:40pm
Those poor children.
Mar 6 4:41pm
Lol
Mar 6 4:41pm
Do you enjoy doing that? Sounds like a metric ton of work
Mar 6 4:41pm
She does help though. Currently, I'm working as a student with them while she is the teacher. Seems to help.
Mar 6 4:41pm
It's nothing like any other teaching job I've had.
Mar 6 4:42pm
I love being able to speak with them. We talk for several hours each day while working in our wikis. It's my favorite part of being able to teach them by far.
Mar 6 4:43pm
It's a frantic science to find out how to teach well to each of my children (and both).
Mar 6 4:43pm
It's work, parts of it are hell, and parts of it are heaven. Overall, I'm lucky to have the chance to be their teacher.
Mar 6 4:44pm
Seems like an incredible way to really find out who your children are as people, or who they're growing up into. And obviously like you said you get tot tailor teaching to them as individuals. But so difficult to figure out how to do that
Mar 6 4:47pm
Also, not poor them. You're one of the smartest people I've ever met dude. And I feel like you'd be a very patient teacher
Mar 6 4:48pm
That is high praise, lol. Thank you.
Mar 6 4:50pm
In the opening of what I often first tell people who are getting to know me through my wiki is this: "Dedicated to Sir GB, long was he my trusted adviser without even my knowledge of it." I wouldn't be where I am without your friendship and guidance.
Mar 6 4:52pm
If I contributed anything to the dialectic it was in being a sounding board
Mar 6 5:06pm
But I do take that as a serious compliment
