//Finding the [[irwartfrr]] to wandering [[The Infinite]] extremes to extrema in the open desert.//

How does a Heideggerian phenomenologically and Aristotelian-virtue-theoretically describe the [[agi]] considerations of dialectics between Rationalist-Platonic-Hegelian Idealistic Immaterial Dialectics and Rawlsian-Marxist Pragmatic Material Dialectics wielding Kant's GÃ¶delian-charged Perception Lasers as a faithful Kierkegaardian metamodern realist all the way down? Tell me [[Saint Diogenesocrates]]? I beg you. Show me the light.

What is in whom, and vice versa? I cannot answer the question [[irwartfrr]].
