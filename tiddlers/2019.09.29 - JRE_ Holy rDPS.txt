How do I use this holy dps?

You push the buttons and win.

Spell priorities

I can't say I've nailed that down perfectly. Holy Fire -> Penance -> Smite, imho, is the DPS rank.
SEP 29 10:33 AM
However, smite can become instant cast.
SEP 29 10:33 AM
That sometimes modifies what one ought to do.
SEP 29 10:34 AM
You will spam smite a ton

People claim to get even higher DPS than I do with this build, so I am probably doing it wrong.

I've never seen anyone use Lunar Guidance REs, but I'm liking them a lot.
SEP 29 10:35 AM
I see them in a lot of other rDPS caster builds.

How many mobs needed to do rain of fire?
SEP 29 10:36 AM
4
SEP 29 10:36 AM
and, Holy Nova should be even higher DPS
SEP 29 10:36 AM
I rain only when I'm lazy or I must be safe.
SEP 29 10:36 AM
Gotcha, rain when I need distance
SEP 29 10:36 AM
I've not tested rain heavily with new REs.

Odds are good that your best pure DPS is single just going single-target until you hit 6 mobs.
