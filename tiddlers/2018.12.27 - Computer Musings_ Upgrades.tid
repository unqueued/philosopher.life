title: 2018.12.27 - Computer Musings: Upgrades

Doing some pacman and yaourt upgrades. 

qTox is complaining about my chatlogs again.

Signal won't even start, and I can't upgrade it either. The build fails, and I could not be bothered. I've stuck with that particular AUR package for a while, but no one else in my family uses it. Uninstalled and moved on.
