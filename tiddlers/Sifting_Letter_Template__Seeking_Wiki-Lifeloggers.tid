title: Sifting Letter Template: Seeking Wiki-Lifeloggers

Hello! I'm trying to find people engaged in self-reflective, introspective lifelogging through personal wikis. I'd like to get to know you, understand your contemplative methodology, and attempt to learn from you about how to wisely use this amazing wiki tool.

This is my personal wiki: https://philosopher.life/. Desktop highly recommended; it's about ~14mb in size. 

Some of you are going to think "₩Һ𝘢ʈ ╤ћᘓ 𝔽ᵁʗꗪ" when you see my wiki. For some, my wiki may feel like Timecube or TempleOS. I apologize for wasting your time. Some of you, however, may be engaged in a similar process. I'd like to connect with you folks! Let's at least be penpals. You can also find my contact information on the wiki.
