Mastery takes more than talent, it takes persistence. Never give up! Fight. If you fall down, stand back up. It's about being comfortable with failing in the right way. You have to practice correctly. Make the right mistakes, consistently, over and over. Make mistakes for good reasons, and learn more reasons. Take your lessons. Be disciplined. It's a long road. Pick things worth mastering.
