What you up to this weekend?
FRI 2:38 PM
I hit voicemail. I wanted to say: happy birthday. =) I hope you have a great day.
SAT 11:43 AM
Morning! And thank you — I was hanging out with my parents/sister yesterday for mah birthday and set my phone aside. I haven’t gotten to listen to your message yet but I will after church.
SUN 10:23 AM
Mom, [[AG]], and I had a really good conversation last night. Here’s to hoping we make some ground on preparing my sister for the real world.
SUN 10:24 AM
I didn't leave a message. Just instant messaged instead. =)

Sounds like it was a great birthday.
