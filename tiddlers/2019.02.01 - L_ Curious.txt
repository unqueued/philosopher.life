By forward facing I more meant outward facing, as in this aspect of my job is the one seen by a more “general” audience.
FRI 4:02 PM
Or to word it differently, they gave me the job to talk to people because they know I don’t shut up lol
FRI 4:03 PM
Lol. You saying a lot does say a lot about you. =) I like that.
FRI 4:29 PM
Shiny vidya are wonderful. Is that game rockin' your world?
FRI 4:30 PM
It is! Its target audience is fairly young so it starts out a little slow, but the story really picks up just after the first world. It’s also a VERY beautiful game because they programmed it using the Unreal Engine (which you should totally look up if you haven’t seen anything from it yet)

Making me feel old. =)

Unreal came out when I was [[j3d1h]]'s age, lol.
FRI 9:04 PM
Really??
FRI 9:29 PM
I didn’t hear anything about it until more recently... bigger companies have started using it and really getting the name out there.
FRI 9:29 PM
It probably has more to do with the kinds of games you played growing up (which isn't to say I'm a huge gamer).
FRI 9:38 PM
Unreal has defined the industry for decades, imho.
