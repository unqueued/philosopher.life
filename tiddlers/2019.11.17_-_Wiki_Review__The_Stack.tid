title: 2019.11.17 - Wiki Review: The Stack

* [[Privacy]]
** My god, there is so much to do here. [[Power]] was difficult to write because I had to attempt to describe ontology down to [[The Dialetheia]] up to material dialectics (building the compressed Kantian metaphysical bridge between Hegel and Marx). I think what makes this so difficult is that I have to attempt to point to the bare kernels of [[The Moral Law]] and emergent political justice as it explodes onto The Stack of the material dialectic, [[hope]]fully with some technical proficiency; the details of computing the hypothetical as categorical make it more expensive to write than mere [[power]].
** High-level best practices...oh shit, with respect to what!? Lol. Oh, okay, guess I have to dive first.
*** I am [[Straussian]]ly open to the possibility it is a test. Of course, I am not Snowden, but, I wasn't a Libertarian who actually worked for these people either. His revelation was only surprising to me in that someone had the integrity to openly confirm it.

** Gunky curious conventions. Make little piles and heaps to process. 
* [[2019.11 - Afterschool Teaching]]
** It was a helluva month. Gonna have to find a way to do something similar, but hopefully something which makes more use of my talents.

** I adore my daughter's sense of humor. Even the little things she picks out are great.

** I like how 1.5 years later, I'm just diving in to say it. 
* [[2019.11.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Life Is Just A Phase]]
** Completed. I need, like, 10k more of those days to get everything I need to get done actually done.
* [[2019.11.16 - TDL: Still Chill]]
** Working on it! Seems doable. 
*** Not chilling when I'm writing, but I am pleased with my effort.

** Give 'em hell, Harry.
