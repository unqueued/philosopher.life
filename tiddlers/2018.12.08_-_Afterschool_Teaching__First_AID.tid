title: 2018.12.08 - Afterschool Teaching: First AID

I showed up 200 seconds late. The door was locked. Cool. They let me in, we continued. The course was clearly trimmed heavily by Sonya. What may have taken 9 hours took 4-5 (and I think I could have squeezed it down to 3 pretty easily).

This was different than the last time I had a CPR/First Aid course (13? years ago). Most of it is the same though.

As usual, I stayed quiet. I was with 5 other southern females. It was what you'd expect. 

I'm grateful to have the chance to practice this. I got paid almost minimum wage for several hours too, so that's cool.
