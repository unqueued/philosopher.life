Don’t do it. I don’t think a TLDR is beneficial to anyone viewing your wiki. The value comes from it as a whole. And I say this as someone who has maybe scratched through 1% of it.
<<<

Thank you for taking the time to think about it and give me advice. I need it! It does feel like TLDRing my work defeats the purpose. Of course, that is my gut instinct. I'm trying to doubt it, lol. I think [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]] is the only project that forcefully pushes me for [[TLDR]] content, but the others not so much.

I also say this as someone currently inebriated after consuming copious amounts of beer.
<<<

Right on, homie. I join you with cannabutter tonight. =)

<<<
But, based on your notes, I can tell your heart is not in the idea either. Maybe, through a TLDR, your wiki becomes more accessible to a wider audience, but I don’t believe that’s the goal. And I also don’t think the TLDR audience will end up getting anything out of it if that became the starting place for individuals discovering your wiki for the first time.
<<<

I am not sold on the idea. I just don't understand enough about relevant accessibility (even for myself to this heap of a wiki). My goal is to be hospitable, but there are limits to what I can do here. Time and time again, I find I'm looking for people who want to read and write even when it's not fun. I'm not here to make it marketable beyond what is necessary for giving people a chance to know me if they wanted to put in the time. I'm obligated to build doorways and hand people the keys, but yeah, you're right, I just don't see how [[TLDR]]ing my current content does anything that matters. I keep running into versions of those problems, even in how I think about the [[RGM]].

<<<
If it could truly help individuals, such as the one you wrote to mentioning the creation of the TLDR, then I would suggest including some boiler plate copy in your correspondence, but don’t create a homebase for people to come to from the get-go in order to get the gist.
<<<

I have no idea how to introduce anyone effectively enough to this wiki. I'm still telling myself the gist of it (poorly), so I'm not going to be able to reduce it down correctly. 

Interestingly, I have something like boilerplate: I aim to point to {[[Contact]]}, {[[Help]]}, and [[Find The Others]] fairly consistently. It's not an elevator speech or simple, but that's okay too. They are very much what this wiki is about to me.

I only have anecdata, but I think the majority of people who would take the time to look closely at the wiki tend to be fairly open people. This wiki is unsuitable for almost everyone, lol. That's okay. I have met people who take the time to think with me (including you). That is joyous!

<<<
But that’s just my two cents. You said you needed advice, mine may not be the most valuable, but I offer it as one honest opinion for how I’ve consumed, learned, and taken bits from your wiki for myself.
<<<

Thank you! I can see you put thought into it. I appreciate your honesty immensely. I do not find most people aim to be honest with me (especially if it costs them).

<<<
P.S.

I still want to respond to your letter. I may end up doing that later tonight as I’m sure you wouldn’t mind a drunk letter in response. We will see. If not tonight, then probably in the next week or so. Cheers!

Lol, go for it! I need to do more Drunkposting myself. Take all the time you need.
