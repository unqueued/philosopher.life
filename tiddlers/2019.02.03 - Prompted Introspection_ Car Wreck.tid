title: 2019.02.03 - Prompted Introspection: Car Wreck

!! Have you ever been in a car wreck? How many? Whose fault was it?

I was between the Catholic church and school (toward the mainstreet), and a very old lady rear-ended me (not the only time I've been rear-ended). She was clearly not in her right mind. A cop stopped by, took us to a parking lot, and started doing the paperwork. She started arguing with him, and he started arguing back. I was told to leave. I was a 16-year-old kid who was taught to respect authority, so I did.

I should have stayed. She clearly was not well, and she needed an advocate. I just left that poor woman to defend herself. I chose not to be her witness and protector. I knew better. I fucked up.
