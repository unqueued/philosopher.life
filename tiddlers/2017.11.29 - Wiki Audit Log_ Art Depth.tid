title: 2017.11.29 - Wiki Audit Log: Art Depth

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

* I'm thinking I should re-write {[[About]]} after doing my 1-depth pass of the wiki. I will perhaps have had enough shape given to the wiki to do that. If not 1-depth, then 2-depth seems quite reasonable. I seem to be breaking my depth rules anyways, from time to time. It's okay to go with the flow, here.<<ref "2018.12.21">>

* H: modifications.

* I'm doing something weird in [[Map]]. Trying this "pin" thing out. I have alternative pages I may want to visit, templates for example. And, I don't want to crawl a tree for them, but I also don't want them clogging up Hub. Perhaps it should just goto Hub. In some ways, Hub is the real Map, and Map is more like Pins/Hub or whatever.

** I actually need to clean house in here. I can't go breadth first always. I need more arrangement. I don't know the rules for why, and that's okay. I'm just going for it.

* [[Computing]]
** Talk about spring cleaning. Jesus. There is a lot to do.

<<footnotes "2018.12.21" "This move is absolutely fascinating to me! GOOD FUCKING JOB!! That rewrite was so hard to do. I've spent countless hours constructing it, and I'm so so grateful to myself for having tried to think about the wiki as a whole before trying to write a coherent narrative in there.">>
