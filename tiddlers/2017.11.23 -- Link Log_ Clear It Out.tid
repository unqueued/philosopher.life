*** You aren't preaching the real problem just yet. It's uglier than you've said. I suspect you are implying it, but it's time to be honest and more open about the attack than you've been. There is something more nefarious going on. It is just like TheATL to phrase it this way.

*** As usual, he gets a ton wrong, but there are a few things he is correct about. I have the similar things to say about many people who call themselves Leftists. 
** https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/opinion/facebook-regulation-incentive.html
*** I am worried about what regulation looks like. I think regulation needs to be pretty damned open sourced and require options (and sane defaults). It would likely tear FB apart (which I'm fine with). I think we need government investment into open competitors. Some kinds of information access need to be as open and decentralized as possible.

*** The world is destabilizing, yes. There are people who benefit from this. There are those who allow it, enable it, and not merely those who perpetrate it. I do not mean it is deeply planned, but I also mean to say that it is not entirely accidental and that there are reasons for it that make sense.

*** WTF are you talking about? It's not hard to secure it yourself. And, if you have people do it by hand at a central repository, it's also not that dangerous. Management structures can vary quite a bit.
