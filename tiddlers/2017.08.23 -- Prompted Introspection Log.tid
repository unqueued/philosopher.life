!! Why is Charlie so fucking awesome? Why you do love this man? Why does he walk on water with you?

Charlie is an autistic savant. He is functional, but the gaps are more obvious with him. He can't hide it and blend nearly as well. He has such a unique perspective. I love the way his mind works, the things he studies, the brilliance and sometimes simplicity. He always has interesting takes on the world, and what he considers important others do not (but he is often seeking the very heart of the matter or the edges of something quite beautiful). 

I feel a kinship with Charlie. It's nice to not feel alone. Ultimately, we aim to choose friends who make us happy. Charlie makes me happy. I like talking to him. Often, Charlie and I can talk with each other about things we can't talk about with anyone else. It's so nice to be able to take any topic and traverse the rabbit holes to explain it and appreciate it; we both do this with each other. Few people have the patience and interest in such things, let alone the aptitude. 

That makes us fairly sympatico, I think. 

Charlie is also my wife's uncle. I get to appreciate why she likes me, how we get along, and to understand her better as well. There are many dynamics I'm coming to understand better.

Does Charlie really walk on water with me? I mean, he voted for Trump, and I still love talking to him. That is about as close to walking on water with me as you get, right? I can't name a single Trump voter I truly enjoy being with besides Charlie. He was naive about the nature of politics and humanity, but that is a result of autism. I can forgive that.
