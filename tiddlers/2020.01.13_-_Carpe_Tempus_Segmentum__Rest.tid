title: 2020.01.13 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Rest

* Woke at 9
** Better than the night before. I'm so grateful. Still awful, but there was sleep. 
** Throat is getting bloodier, and my face puffier. I'm coughing less though.
* Encouraged offspring
* Rested
* Pods are finally gone
* Putting some house together
* Rested
* Read+Write
* Walked with wife
** Couldn't talk much, but I got to listen. <3
** I bought some $15 shoes at the clearance store. Fit like a glove, slip-on sneakers.
** Found a cheap but way cool dress for my daughter (who approved of it, so merry x-mas).
** A mug with which I hope to make kintsugi for [[CH]]
* Stir fry, eggrolls
* //Psych//
* Read+Write
* Thinking about Lambdaschool, DS. 
** I have no idea if [[j3d1h]] would be interested. There are sections of the math which I can't do either (no idea how quickly I could learn; we'd have to see).
