!! Respond to the following gem:

When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why they are poor, they call me a communist.

Praising you as a saint when you pay the costs they should be paying is profitable. Compliments are cheap virtue signals. Exposing the consequences of immoral motivation will make you many enemies (both from those in power and their reactionary social structures). Trying to politically and philosophically solve the fundamental problems of dark-triadicism will cost you with almost everyone. If you systematically explore people in dialectics, I wager only 3% of the population are altruistic and intellectually competent enough to get the answer right.

I should add that most people think society is messed up. I can walk through large segments of it and find agreement with many people (with some explanation). But, it is clear that once I start to point out how Marx is talking about that, I have crossed the line.
