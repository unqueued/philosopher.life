title: 2020.03.22 - L: Wish It Was Longer

"""
[8:32 PM] h0p3: You having a good weekend?
[9:49 PM] Sohalia: Yes!
[9:49 PM] Sohalia: Honestly I wish it was longer.
[9:49 PM] h0p3: No doubt.
[9:49 PM] Sohalia: How about you?
[9:50 PM] h0p3: Keeping head above water. Grinding. [[Magic]] has been fun. Trying to help my offspring with their [[TTP]]s (pulling teeth): https://philosopher.life/#Maps
[9:51 PM] h0p3: Watching the world crumble, and reckoning with it.
[9:51 PM] Sohalia: Boi you said it...
[9:53 PM] Sohalia: I shouldn’t be surprised by how absolutely awfully the wider population’s response was to this outbreak, let alone our President’s. Thankfully the new KY governor is actually trying to help contain the situation — I think his guidance is the reason our count isn’t quite as high as it could be (but I guess we won’t truly know for a while).
[9:53 PM] h0p3: I'm predicting 45% real adult unemployment in the US.
[9:54 PM] Sohalia: A truly terrifying prospect
[9:55 PM] Sohalia: Most of my extended friend group are okay, but both halves of one couple got laid off/told their new job wouldn’t start until an indefinite date. Absolutely awful.
[10:05 PM] Sohalia: Surprisingly the library is still open for [[K]] though — sort of bittersweet in our case.
[10:05 PM] Sohalia: But at least we are taken care of.
