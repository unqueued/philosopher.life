Now if they would make disposable pots and stuff ‚ÄîI would bad for the environment but happy not doing dishes
OCT 18 2:15 PM
Over the years, I've convinced myself to migrate portions of my laundry process to just have clean baskets sitting on my steel shelves. I do the laundry, and then I have a basket of clean clothes to find what I need (it's not like anything I wear ever matches anyway).
OCT 18 2:17 PM
Dishes is another sort of problem which I'm looking to eventually have ugly beautiful hacks for that work well enough.
OCT 18 2:18 PM
As long as it is clean and comfortable‚Äîmatching doesn‚Äôt matter
OCT 18 2:18 PM
Let me know when you get dish hacks
OCT 18 2:18 PM
I will take comfortable and keeps me out of prison when I walk outside (which, I suppose, does imply some level of cleanliness: once it starts growing cheese, that's how I really know I need to clean it, lol).
OCT 18 2:19 PM
I do really well keeping up and then some ‚Äúchopped champion‚Äù uses every stinkin dush in the place ‚ÄîI just can‚Äôt
OCT 18 2:19 PM
Dish that is
OCT 18 2:20 PM
Yes. That is one of the reasons I don't like to cook anything big.
OCT 18 2:20 PM
The kitchen is usually cleaner when I am cooking because I clean as I go and try to limit the things I use....
OCT 18 2:21 PM
There is a way in which the only way to defeat some tragedy of the commons is to enforce having the cook do the cleaning. 
OCT 18 2:23 PM
Yeah ‚ÄîI do buy a bundle of small aluminum pans ($8 for 30 ish) for oven cooking
OCT 18 2:25 PM
[[UJ]] and I are just tired at night....and [[AG]] is not motivated....
OCT 18 2:26 PM
That is us! lol. 
OCT 18 2:27 PM
I imagine it must be exceptionally difficult for you all since you spend so many spoons working with others at work.
OCT 18 2:28 PM
Yeah ‚ÄîI have been trying to throw stuff in the oven before nappage....
OCT 18 2:28 PM
Chicken usually
OCT 18 2:28 PM
I am interested to see if I lost any weight tomorrow....
OCT 18 2:29 PM
I have become a fan of ordering from Walmart online and picking up....its nice to not wander through the store
OCT 18 2:30 PM
That makes so much sense.
OCT 18 2:30 PM
They might actually compete with Amazon with that model (which is not to say I think this is a good thing). 
OCT 18 2:31 PM
I do Aldis about every week or so. [[k0sh3k]] does Wal-mart maybe every other week after church. Amazon almost everything else.
OCT 18 2:31 PM
We need to think about ordering from Wal-mart though.
OCT 18 2:32 PM
Yeah I like Aldi‚Äôs too
OCT 18 2:32 PM
It doesn‚Äôt cost any extra or if it does its like $5
