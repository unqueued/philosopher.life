title: 2017.07.17 - Pipefitting Log

I arrived early and locked the box. I had to wait for about half an hour for anyone to show up. The crane and the chiller truck showed up first. I could see them call up Terry. Terry came at 7:45ish. I told him about Greg's message, but he had heard. In fact, he said I wouldn't be able to work on my previous project for an entire week. This pissed him off because he felt like working on the roof was not even worth it for only a week. He didn't know what I was going to be doing, basically. 

Terry, Jacob, and Travis are all leaving at 3:00 each day because of church (VBS, presumably). I still get to stay to 5:00 as long as I have work. You bet your ass I'm staying. Money and experience with no one constantly looking over my shoulder? Yes, please. 

Jaye didn't show up for the longest time. I thought he wasn't coming. I even asked if he had been let go (I probably shouldn't have drawn attention to it, but it had been an hour!). Jaye came, he claims to have been waiting on the other side of the building. I find this odd since our orders would still come from the same location. I think he was lying because he was late. In any case, it was good to see him.

Jaye's kid was cleared of cancer over the weekend. They are doing a make-a-wish trip to Disney after the marrow transplant though. Also, he still doesn't have a new hood. He promised to this week. Let me say, I have my doubts now.

We watched for about 2 hours while the rigging guys did everything. They wouldn't let us touch a thing. I was hoping to get my hands dirty a bit, but I'm glad to have seen them in action. They were very fast. Also, they were very fat.

The riggers/crane company gave us stickers. I felt like a little kid in school. The stickers go on my hard hat, and they show I've been a bigboy, a good worker, an experienced, cool person. I'm so awesome: just look at my stickers. 

I told Jaye about the union and autism. He had talked about how cool it was that my son was autistic, and the union. Told him I forgot my phone and the brownies too. He laughed. It's actually not too difficult to make Jaye laugh, which is nice. He gave me a Gatorade as we drove a bit in his car. I'm sure this does not endear me to my official coworkers. Jaye has been thinking about why they seem so standoffish to both of us as well; I'm not the only one who has noticed.

I wanted something to do. I'm here to fucking practice and work, to gain dat experience. So, I primed Terry by asking him questions about how the chillers would be hooked up. I was right, and the idea dawned on him that I could do the fitting for the chiller. I'm not in love with working in the heat like this, but I think it will at least be something. I want to get as many projects under my belt as possible. He spoke to me like I'm an idiot, of course. It's okay; I'm new, and the abuse is incredibly mild. At least I get to keep my job for today! That's not how I'm going to treat new people, I hope. Oh, he gave me a new wrap around too, and I thanked him for it. Submit to your abusers when you must.

I measured top and bottom of the pipe from the concrete foundation, then found the centerpoint. It's 6" pipe, so the TO for our 90 is 9". I needed to come off the concrete level by 8-1/16". 

We had to move the welding machine into place with the truck, run our wires, use a saw of some sort (don't remember the name, will ask again) to cut the insulation off. I used an angle bar with my spirit level to find matching lines from the concrete underneath the chiller to the pipe in the dirt. I marked the pipe at the concrete level and then found the cut level. The wrap around was wonderful! We cut the pipe before lunch.

I went to Burger King. Port 80 and 443 only with a clear MITM. No VPN possible. Um...no thanks. I was hoping to call home on my machine. I guess I can't.

I cut a nipple and beveled it. We put a nipple on the 90, a flange on the nipples, and I prepped: the butterfly valve, a flange, and an odd nipple with flanges on either side that attached to the other side of the butterfly valve (Terry made it for me). We were supposed to finish the whole thing, but it was too hot to tack, and we needed to finish the last weld on the inside.

I've noticed that the welding standards are significantly lower here than at the shop in a lot of ways. They say "it's just water" to everything.

I'm sunburnt and super exhausted. My back hurts today as well. It is what it is, eh?
