Because I use it 98% of the time to just fall asleep to cartoons, I've still not set it up after installing the new SSD. Also, I figure out what I ripped out: a speaker. Rofl. It doesn't matter to me though, since I always have a set of earbuds/headphones with it. I also always have my phone with me if I have m15. Even at night, I earbud so as not to wake my wife.
