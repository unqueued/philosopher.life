!! Audit:

* The first meditation is frankly brief. 
* I think it is important that I'm not interrupted when I'm doing this work. When the family comes home from church, I have the immediate urge to go hug them. I think I need to concentrate.
* Change is hard. I can see the work here.
* It still messes with my sleep schedule. I need to take it very early.
* I haven't been taking it every single week. It's on and off. But, sometimes, that's the best I can do.
