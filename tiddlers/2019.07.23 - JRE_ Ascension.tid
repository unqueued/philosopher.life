title: 2019.07.23 - JRE: Ascension

We talked for quite a while. His job is going well, and he's pleased with the weather. He's been fucking awesomely. `/hi5`

He bought faux butterfly knives for my offspring to practice their ninjitsu skills with. Awesome. They will adore it.

We talked shows. We're thinking about how our reasons for watching have changed since childhood. He recommended Serial podcast. I'm grateful for every recommendation he gives me.

Then we talked about [[Project Ascension]], and, ofc, that is all I could think about. It's beautiful. It's a giant fucking theorycrafting rabbithole.
