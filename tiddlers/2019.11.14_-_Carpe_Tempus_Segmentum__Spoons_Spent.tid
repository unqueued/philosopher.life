title: 2019.11.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Spoons Spent

* Woke at 6.
** Fuck. That is not enough.
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* Shower
* Cleaning
* Trying to get offspring on task.
* Read+Write
* Helped son find what he needed, and raised the hood for him. He did the charging.
* Read+Write
* Dialecture
* Work
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** Matthew and Rebecca are doing somewhat better. They really aren't getting enough sleep. I can hear it in my brother's voice.
** He's talking too much sense at work, and it's getting him in trouble. Good thing he has tenure as a jman.
** We talked about my day. He cried too. 
** My son sent his uncle a message asking about electron flow in batteries. My son didn't engage in the conversation train fittingly, so we will think about how to improve (my brother is gracious in his interpretation).
* Talked with wife. Wrong account, so we'll keep trying.
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Linguine, red sauce, melon, veggies
** Not enough beans for beans and rice.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 2
