title: Revisionist History: S01E04

I've heard Carlos' story before. I'm not sure when or why. Again, I am not surprised. I haven't believed we've lived in a meritocracy or in a nation with any major upward mobility or fair opportunities. The American Dream is as weak as ever. It's a lie used to control the masses. 

I fucking hate everyone. Kill yourselves, you selfish pieces of shit.
