Yes. Much better.

Doesn't sound like they know what was wrong (blood cultures turned up nothing, and they couldn't find any pus to test), but they pumped me full of anti-everything and it worked.

How's your weekend been?
TUE 10:17 AM
Was it like MRSA or streph or staph? That’s kinda weird

I hope it stays away

Think it was a fungal infection that enabled a bacterial infection.
