title: 2018.06.10 - Deep Reading Log: The Art of War

Going through The Teaching Company's lecture first.

Not really "The Art of War" title, but more like "Master Sun's Military Methods" translation. Lived at the end of 6th century BC, but the authorship is clearly appropriated. Interestingly, that may be an application of the principle in question. Neato.
