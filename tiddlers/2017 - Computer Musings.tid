!! Audit:

* These are very random thoughts, but that is okay. This was not a project until November. Only then did I realize what I was actually trying to make this entire time.
* I'm giving title.Titles to those which don't have one.
* This "Log" which I didn't initially realize was a log was clearly influential on this wiki. I see the marks.
* I'm still impressed by the performance on that i3.
* To-Do-Lists =)
* Oh, snap! Internet Laws seems like [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]] content to me. Cut-Paste and Transclude!
** Feed the beast!
* Hrmm...One of these is a Walkthrough.
* Preach, yo!
* ZSH is wonderful, btw.
* Fuck FF.
* Some oddball ideas in here.
* I did a lot of work this year, even though I don't show it.
* I use these shortcuts often. I'm glad I recorded them.
* Only half my ricing is worth it in the end.
