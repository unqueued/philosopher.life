title: 2018.11.06 - Guitar: Fire

My fingers are on fire. They are beet red, the top skin layers are gone. God damn, it BURNS! My son's fingers are feeling it too. We practiced hard today. We went through our classical music and a couple Celtic songs. I'm sounding terrible. My son identified a chord all on his own, and he is finding the patterns in the music. We are making progress! =)

My daughter is getting copies for me to play with her. She has set out to learn 3 increasingly difficult variations of //Duelin' Banjos//.
