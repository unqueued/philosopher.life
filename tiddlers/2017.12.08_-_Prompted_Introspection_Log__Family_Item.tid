title: 2017.12.08 - Prompted Introspection Log: Family Item

!! What family item has changed your view or ideas about a family member?

I'm not sure what counts as a family item. Are we talking about heirlooms, talismans, collectively-owned objects, or what? What separates it from any old object of, by, from, regarding a family member? It is rare that an object alone (or even primarily) changes my view or idea about a family member in a significant way. Artifacts reveal things about us, of course. 

I remember one of my grand donors giving us his dead cellphones in the late '90s. He clearly never gave a shit about us. He gave us his trash. He could have radically changed our lives, and he didn't. Hilariously, I think the same thing about my donors now. The cycle continues.
