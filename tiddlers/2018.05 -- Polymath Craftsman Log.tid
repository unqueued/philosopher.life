!! Audit:

* I need to write my hours out!
** Done (or, well enough).
* Planning was awful on that job, and it showed. This was his second time as a foreman. I will need to learn quite a bit to fit it altogether. I hope to naturally slide into being amazing at it, if and when it ever occurs to me (I would eventually like to be able to build whatever I wanted).
* I ended up making one friend (had two, but I think Bryce learned to dislike me...) in Brian, who is the only journeyman from our union. If there was a friend to make, he'd be the most useful one to me.
* I was sore, but not insanely so. I'm glad to have given my body a workout. I'm ready to get back into it.
* Colton did a very shitty job of making clear what he wanted, but that's because he didn't really know what he wanted. He hadn't figured it out, and even when he did, he often gave inconsistent commands. 
* The bluetooth headset was a godsend. I love working and listening at the same time. The drive to and from work was honestly beautiful. It was time for reading, and it was powerful to me.
* I learned in the first few days that my boss was a liar. I should start using my gut's model of people more often. I'm right: they are psychopaths.
* I did some work on the weekends. I like setting up for it to some extent.
* I've noticed that I'm not really learning about electrical work, even though I thought I would dive in. I have been following the subreddits though, and I'm becoming familiar with the imagery and some conversations. I hope to blend in nicely, to look like a natural, to not remove all doubt of my ignorance upon my first few spoken words, etc.
* Unfortunately, I stopped learning things on this job. I was just a grunt worker, and apparently, I was doing the work that only the electricians were supposed to do.
* I'm sticking to my guns.
* There is some epic trash talk in these logs, rofl.
* It's beautiful to be able to connect with my son on these matters. I hope it becomes a rich source of value and meaning to us, common ground, and a place to work together.
* I despise being lied to.
* Rain was handled oddly. I really don't like just sitting there. 
* I'm not looking forward to traveling 1.5 hours one-way. Fuuuuu.
* I could not have done this without my family. My wife and daughter in particular helped me out multiple times. I need to thank them again.
* Fuck Colton.
* I'm very pleased with having a gameplan to describe how I think I can be fairly compensated.
* Perhaps I need to ease off the socialist soapbox. Ugh, but that just wouldn't be me.
