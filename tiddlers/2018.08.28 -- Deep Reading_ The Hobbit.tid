title: 2018.08.28 -- Deep Reading: The Hobbit

I'm going through my old favorites with the kids. I was eventually able to convince my daughter to read this book before (after much argumentation). I'm glad to do this as an audiobook with them. We made it about 20% on our first session. 

Admittedly, this is not lighting up for me like [[Dune]], but that's okay. This is largely about connecting with my chillun through shared stories. This isn't their only exposure. We've (to my chagrin) see at least the first Hobbit movie. We've talked about it quite a bit. I'm glad to be going through this book. There are a lot of discussions my wife and I have which ultimately require knowledge of Tolkien's work. We need dem references.
