* Woke at 9
** Attaboy
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* My daughter did all the callwork with our landlords.
* Dialectures
** Damned good questions from both my offspring. 
*** I know they don't have the technical terms down pat, so it's going to be difficult to say it correctly in some contexts.
* Kevin showed up to help us. He listened in on the dialectures, but he did not participate (the man is busy).
** Ridiculously respectful about interrupting. Wish he jumped in.
* Read+Write
* Grocery shopping
** Still can't do audiobooks. My mind prefers to race and wander. Alrighty.
* Work
* Talked with my brother, [[JRE]].
** He generously offered us breathing room again. He was worried that [[k0sh3k]] is feeling pressure due to finances. That is exceptionally kind of him. 
* Walked with wife
** Seems much better today. 
*** She got a nap in too.
** We are on like Donkeykong tomorrow. She is DTF!
*** Congratz on the sex birfday brownies might be in order.
**** "Tell me where you want your gift, girl"
* Beer, then nap
* Linguine, red sauce, salad. 
** Offspring preferred to cook tonight. Noice, gracias. It was delicious.
* My wife is watching //Rick & Morty// all the way through for the first time that she remembers. I hope to savor each coming episode with her.
** She giggled a bunch. 
* WoW
** Short. Was asked to DPS for AQ, but didn't feel like it.
* I like having my head in my wife's lap. Most relaxing place in the world.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 1:45
