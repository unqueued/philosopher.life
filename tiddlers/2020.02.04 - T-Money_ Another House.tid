How's your weekend?
Feb 2 8:14pm
How's your day going?
Feb 4 12:13pm
Hey man. Apologies for delayed responces. Life seems to be busy and stressful as of late. And quite unnecessarily I might add! Lol. How are you and yours?
Feb 4 6:10pm
Not a problem. I assumed it's been super busy for ya. I'm sorry it's been stressful too. I hope the your pad in Berea is a bit more comfy and less infested.
Feb 4 6:13pm
We're doing well enough. Still trying to get back into the groove of things with everyone.
Feb 4 6:13pm
Mostly pleasant though.
Feb 4 6:13pm
That is good. How has the weather been? It had been warm down here.
Feb 4 6:24pm
It's cold enough to keep snow on the ground, but not bad at all. Still good walking weather.
Feb 4 6:27pm
That is good. How is the weight-loss going?
Feb 4 7:05pm
That I don't know. Probably gaining weight, lol.
Feb 4 7:05pm
I'm trying to eat more fruits and vegetables and lay off the deliciousness except at dinner time.
Feb 4 7:05pm
I still have 3 pairs of nice 34's from when I first got married, and last year I could fit them for the first time...but, I can't now, lol.
Feb 4 7:06pm
I'm up to 36s and 38s... =/ 250lbs
Feb 4 7:06pm
Food is so god damn delicious. Beer too.

Feb 4 7:07pm
Looks delicious.
Feb 4 7:08pm
Tuna, rice, apple, and a beer here. Gonna get some cake in a bit.
Feb 4 7:08pm
I woudl much rather have that though, lol
Feb 4 7:08pm
I Don't Want This. but we had no meals prep and my fridge went down last week. lost all my food.
Feb 4 7:08pm
So I'm Hesitant To Put Anything In JT.
Feb 4 7:09pm
=/ yeah
Feb 4 7:09pm
Untill It Shows its gonna act right.
Feb 4 7:09pm
You got 7ish more weeks in there, yeah?
Feb 4 7:10pm
Indeed. One hot water heater for 4 units. Had to wait on water to warm up before shower. And finished shower going Luke warm to cold fast...
Feb 4 7:11pm
We are looking at houses to buy.
Feb 4 7:11pm
Aye
Feb 4 7:11pm
I bet it's going to be crazy busy for you for several months then, eh?
Feb 4 7:11pm
Found some really cheap ones. Old rentals. One I'm looking at not is only 60k.  2 bedroom.
Feb 4 7:12pm
Now*
Feb 4 7:12pm
Noice.
Feb 4 7:12pm
But I'm cash poor unless I take a bunch out of savings. And they want you to have 5-20%down and closing costs in cash.
Feb 4 7:13pm
But I can go finance a truck, or a tractor with zero down and spend the same amount!
Feb 4 7:13pm
Irritating. Trying to think outside the box on how I can do it without spending a bunch of $ up front.
Feb 4 7:14pm
What do you think of this 2 bds â€¢ 1 ba â€¢ 750 sqft home I found on Zillow? https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/205-Herndon-St-Berea-KY-40403/218467992_zpid/
Feb 4 7:16pm
Kinda small. But that's bigger than my apartment.
Feb 5 7:58pm
Also smaller than my garage in Somerset. Haha
Feb 5 7:58pm
It looks pleasant.
Feb 5 7:58pm
Lots of convos going. Looks like best option is a home equity line of credit on the house my wife inherited in Somerset. Then we can basically pay cash for Berea home and have enough to turn carport into garage. Then. In a year flip lines of credit to the Berea home and take the line off the Somerset house and put it on the Berea house.
Feb 5 8:00pm
I didn't realize how difficult buying a house was. We have bought raw property before. 2 acres and it was pretty simple.
Feb 5 8:01pm
We bought two acres that ajoin my father in laws property and my Somerset house and had a barn on it.
Feb 5 8:02pm
Which you have seen pictures of.
Feb 5 8:02pm
Aye
Feb 5 8:02pm
Why is flipping the lines worth it?
Feb 5 8:05pm
Peace of mind. For me. It's not really worth it. But it takes my "home" off the list if shit the bank can take if I renig, go bankrupt, reinjury my back to non workable.... That kinda thing. I just want the somerset house free and clear asap. But I don't wanna pay their down payments and closing cost out of pocket.
Feb 5 8:07pm
They can suck an egg.
Feb 5 8:07pm
Makes sense.
Feb 5 8:08pm
Also forgo the mortgage lendors and deal straig with my bank.
Feb 5 8:08pm
Apparently the mortgage lendors pack on the fines and shit. I had no idea. We bought the property thru the bank. It was simple.
Feb 5 8:09pm
I sympathize with first home buyers. They want you to have 20-30k up front.
Feb 5 8:09pm
Which. Most some people may have. But most working families don't have that liquid cash on hand and want to just deplete savings so quickly
Feb 5 8:10pm
Aye. The numbers are grim.
Feb 5 8:11pm
If your a veteran you ding have to pay anything down.
Feb 5 8:16pm
So if you fight for oil and opium your good.
Feb 5 8:16pm
Lol
Feb 5 8:16pm
Aye. We reward the murderers who enforce the will of capitalists and reactionaries. It is mighty tempting. Large sections of my extended family are military.
Feb 5 8:17pm
I feel like I woukd have fit better in the civil war Era.
Feb 5 8:37pm

Love this one though.
Feb 5 8:53pm
Corona virus looks promising. Hoping for a purge. Even if I'm included.
Feb 5 8:53pm
Ha. =). Higher chances of taking out the elderly, but unfortunately, not the most important sections of that demographic. Difficult to target those who deserve it in a just purge.
Feb 5 9:00pm
Meh. Take our the elderly would wipe out most of congress! Hahah
Feb 5 9:09pm
I'm not so cold hearted I truely wish that but I surely fantasize about anything that gets me out of work tomorrow. ðŸ˜‚
Feb 5 9:10pm
It's the weekend, my dude.
Feb 7 6:26pm
Hope it's amazing for you.
Feb 7 6:26pm
Lol. Life doesn't cut a man breaks sir.

This was Thursday night. I am much better now. But a long night of drinking by myself was in order Thursday after this news. He would have done it for me. Lots of memories with this guy.
Feb 8 7:32pm
We became frienda because our mothers were drinking buddies and she dropped him off with me and my friends about 12 years old.
Feb 8 7:33pm
I'd like to take credit for helping him eventually learn to be cool. Lmao. When we first ahold of him he had a long way to go. But he passed in awesomeness. My life goes on.
Feb 8 7:35pm
I'm sorry for your loss.
Feb 8 10:06pm
Thanka man. Life's a bitch. He lived it like a champ.

He lived life as full as he could despite having and being treated for cancer for 15 years.
Feb 8 10:23pm
I'm happy to have known him so well.
Feb 8 10:24pm
That's a long time to battle cancer.
Feb 8 10:24pm
He wasn't suppose to pass. But I think he under reported his current condition to everyone.
Feb 8 10:25pm
Including his family. He was going to the mayo clinic in Jacksonville for special treatment but had several differnt tumors removed.
Feb 8 10:25pm
At different times in his life.
Feb 8 10:26pm
Yeah. I was yore up Thursday when I first heard the news. I am alot better now.
