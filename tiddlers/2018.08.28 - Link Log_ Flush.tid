*** tictactization, [[antipleonasm]], whatever...I agree to most of the argument here, but I do admire the attempt to usher people into philosophy that doesn't close people off into something reductive. I have to admit, from my [[Introducing Aristotle: A Graphic Guide]], I'm realizing that I'm likely able to see the richness of what is being said now in a way that I just couldn't have a decade ago. I have to iterate and grow the depth of my understanding. I applaud anything that helps model philosophy like that for others. 
** https://philosophynow.org/issues/127/Decoding_Chomsky_by_Chris_Knight

*** I can only assume this is a bad sign.
** https://motherboard.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/xwk9zd/how-facebook-content-moderation-works
*** It's pretty clear to me that we have to build tools that allow people to construct their own filter bubbles. Decentralizing this process is absolutely crucial. It's not easy to do, and it can only be done to some extent. Unfortunately, centralization is the way of capitalism.
** https://80000hours.org/2017/11/consider-applying-for-a-phd-program-now/
*** Interesting to see them going this direction. I'm glad to have learned what I did. I wish I didn't have to spend my life trying to undo the damage my donors did.
** http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201474&type=printable
*** The weird part about these bullshit sentences is that I can conceive of contexts in which these are not bullshit but reasonably meaningful (at least for most of these). There's a serious different in the vocabulary of these sentences which is problematic. I think they run the risk denying the philosophical terminology as having serious meaning, which is fascinating. 
** https://zandercutt.com/2018/08/23/the-approval-economy/
*** What about moral approval? Lol. See, I think it's my time online that has helped me understand the structures and fabric of moral life in this way. I don't think it's a bad thing to see every detail of our lives as being a moral issue at all. Of course, this is exactly why I have to peel apart mere social conventions from the moral law with zeal.

*** Interesting. I reached out.
** https://www.overcomingbias.com/2018/07/economics-rarely-say-nothing-but.html
*** Actually, I think Economists tend to be egoists, and that warps their methaethics profoundly (I've known a ton of dual-degree holders). There is something wrong with the ways in which economists attempt to provide prescription. I even find their descriptive practices to be in service to a prescription that isn't well conceived too.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/opinion/if-philosophy-wont-diversify-lets-call-it-what-it-really-is.html
*** There's something right about this claim.
** https://triplebyte.com/blog/rejection-feedback
*** Partially right, of course.
** http://barryhawkins.com/blog/posts/the-story-of-why-i-left-riot-games/
*** The "professional" language issue seems irrelevant to me. I only care about what is moral. That's not a defense, but I think it's a problem.
** https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/john-rawls-reticent-socialist-review-theory-of-justice
*** I'm in the Rawlsian lineage. I think there are good socialist interpretations of his work (obviously, that's what I'm trying to do). His later work was not cosmopolitan though. I actually think he promoted the status quo. It's fucked up.
** https://www.wikitribune.com/story/2018/08/29/internet-tech/donald-trump-accuses-google-of-being-rigged-says-the-internet-giant-should-be-careful/85663/
*** Broken clock? I always have to think twice whenever Trump and I agree.
** https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/08/americas-broken-retirement-system-recipe-political-chaos.html
*** I have little interested in saving the Boomers. The 3% among them, however, I do aim to save.

* Fishy
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/style/modern-love-the-kisses-that-paid-my-rent.html
*** I have no moral problem with prostitution, but I despise a society that forces us into it. I think that's just a vignette of Capitalism, but my worry is that this is about reducing it to an identity politics problem that somehow is more important that the class problem. This is a class problem folks, and I think this piece is meant to misdirect us.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/opinion/sunday/what-socialism-looks-like-in-2018.html
*** And, yet, I'm not convinced demsocs are radical. I think they want to maintain capitalism, as much as they might think otherwise. They still want centralized processes rather than decentralized ones. They do care about inequality and the Crisis of Capitalism, they just don't understand the problems well enough to consider the solution effectively. It is not accident that the real Left (which is far more extreme than these centrists) isn't paid more than mere lipservice beyond a name drop.
** https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/energy-department-teams-up-with-bill-gates-to-move-mini-nuclear-plants-to-market
*** I agree to the move. I doubt his intentions. I do not understand how he benefits, but I am sure he does.
** https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/25/opinion/sunday/student-debt-loan-default-college.html
*** Agreed, and yet, you do not consider the answer. It allows you to say whatever you want.
** https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/dont-shoot-messenger
*** I don't think you are being paranoid enough here.
