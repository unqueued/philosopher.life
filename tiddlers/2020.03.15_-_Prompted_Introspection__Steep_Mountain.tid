title: 2020.03.15 - Prompted Introspection: Steep Mountain

!! Did I do something today that I can be proud of?

[[Family Time]] was my project for the day, and it was fruitful (and the latter half enjoyable). I think we are making headway into scheduling, accountability, and executive functioning with my offspring. I'm excited by the possibility that we will be able to plan more thoroughly together. I'm hoping that my offspring will be far more adept with these tools (or their own) than I have been. I didn't have anyone to try this with me at their ages, and I'm glad I have the chance to do it with them. It's a steep mountain.
