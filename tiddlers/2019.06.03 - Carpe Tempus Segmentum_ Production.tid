** My wife despaired that no one listens to her. I do. I am a hardheaded sumbitch, but she does change my mind and behavior. I also think carefully about her Biblical analysis and her work in libraries. We also do philosophy together. It's interesting to hear us echo the same thought to each other, and we both recognize the other is listening. Her Sunday school class doesn't though, lol.

* Watched the flat tube
* Tried to sleep, but didn't. =(
