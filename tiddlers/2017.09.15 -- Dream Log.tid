title: 2017.09.15 -- Dream Log

I went to bed early, and I know I had been dream since before 4am. I woke at 4 to piss, so I'd know. I went back to bed and dreamt for another hour and a half. The alarm clock sounded, and I was catapulted out of my dream into reality. Somehow, being pulled out by the alarm clock scares me out of my memory.
