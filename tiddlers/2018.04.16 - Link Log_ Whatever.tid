*** Yup. And, of course, TheATL isn't going to explain the socialist considerations to resolving it. You aren't really pointing at the cause, but you have pointed out a problem.

* Think About It

We spawned psychology, and if you are really paying attention to the history of thought in psych, you'll see philosophers have made sustained contributions to your theory, helping guide whatever it is you think is science (and, you do a piss poor job). Unfortunately, you've also misrepresented philosophy here as well.
