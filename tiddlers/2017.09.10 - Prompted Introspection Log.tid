!! When do you know a [[Prompted Introspection Log]] is prompted by Samwise Gamgee?

Do I have to explain something stupidly obvious? Probably a Gamgee post.

Does it make me angry? I need to offload it on to someone, why not Samwise Gamgee?

Am I having a shitty day? It's Samwise Gamgee's fault!

None of these are particularly good answers, I can see. Perhaps I should focus less on that strawman of a character.
