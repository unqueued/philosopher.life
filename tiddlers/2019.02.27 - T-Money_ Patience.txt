WED 7:09 PM
Been a fine week. Wish I didn't make slave wages for helping poor kids, but no one else is going to do it well.
WED 7:11 PM
Working hard on my wiki.
WED 7:11 PM
Kids are doing well in school. Sold the piano, and my son built a desk to sit next to me. That has helped him immensely.
WED 7:12 PM
Was he struggling with school work? I'm curious as to what that would. Help him with?
WED 7:13 PM
Aye. He often doesn't focus.
WED 7:13 PM
I just finished attempting to help my 9 year old summarize a book. They have started book reports. My chest is not tight due to anxiety and frustration.
WED 7:14 PM
I commend you one working with your own kids and helping the others.
WED 7:15 PM
I am. A much better teacher at things that are more mechanical/hands on.
WED 7:16 PM
That is something that my kids needs to practice. It's like pulling teeth to get them to write about what they read.
WED 7:16 PM
Understandably! That is your area of expertise.
WED 7:16 PM
You probably have to show others so often it's enjoyable for you.
WED 7:16 PM
Anything hands on really. I have tons of patience with. But the other, I just get frustrated.
WED 7:16 PM
Summerizing is a difficult task. For most adults. I know it is for her. But Berea kinda beat that shit into you.
WED 7:18 PM
So writing comes much more natural to me than the general. Population. Bu I'm pissed my wife is having her do so much after school anyway.
WED 7:19 PM
They did theater Â¥play oractice" then she practiced her singing, now she's writing a book report, and hasn't even eaten yet and I think she needs a shower tonight.
WED 7:20 PM
Bedtime is 8-830ish
WED 7:20 PM
I just feel. Like. My wife. Is too hard on the kid sometimes.
WED 7:21 PM
Tomorrow she has advanced. Math tutoring (which I'm going to stop after this year) and singing lessons.
WED 7:21 PM
I have a strong distaste for homework and teachers who have other students grade kids  work at school.
WED 7:22 PM
I also have a huge distaste for teachers to don't give partial credit in math problems.
WED 7:23 PM
I have no idea what I'd do in your shoes. =(
WED 7:23 PM
I think you'd find me a tyrant, lol.
WED 7:24 PM
Probabaly.
WED 7:26 PM
I have no desire to push my child. Towards a goal. I also had lazy teachers.
WED 7:27 PM
That came out weird.
WED 7:28 PM
I don't wanna punch Samantha past her too far beyond her peers
WED 7:28 PM
She said is already in the gifted class. She's a little. Genius in my eyes. She has trouble focusing...
WED 7:29 PM
But she reads books on her own for fun without me asking. Like choose books instead of TV.
WED 7:29 PM
We probably have different conceptions of human flourishing.
WED 7:30 PM
It's awesome that she loves to read.
WED 7:30 PM
You were raised very differently than me and I raise my child very differently than I was raised. I suspect you do as we..
WED 7:31 PM
Well.
WED 7:31 PM
Aye. That's true.
WED 7:31 PM
I suspect we are building onto and improving the best that we can from what we were taught.
WED 7:31 PM
Difference of opinion  on human flourishing. I suspect we would agree on most things. (at what rate is expect, probabaly disagree.)
WED 7:32 PM
I cannot say. I don't know.
WED 7:33 PM
I speculate.
WED 7:33 PM
As a situation if circumstance I was a very different child than mine currently is. The environment that I was raised is in likely similar to. Many of the kids you watch after school. Single mom, always working and gone, moms boyfriends comes and goes, little to no supervision, by fith grade I had a mowhawk, legit, usually wore laid down. I smoke ciggaretts and I was reported to my DARE police officer by fellow students as a drug user and possible gang affiliate.
WED 7:37 PM
Aye. I can appreciate that.
WED 7:38 PM
The only reason I passed 5th grade was because they "passed" me. In 6th grad when I. Moved to the 3 red light town, hours away from the suburbs of Atlant. When my mother remairred.
WED 7:39 PM
I was failing every course in school. And had my first cloths on sexual encou ter with my baby sitter at age 10. Multiple times.
WED 7:40 PM
Meh. I turned out OK. I'm just an addict who works a highly safety sensitive job.
WED 7:41 PM
lol
WED 7:41 PM
Like people die if I fuck up.
WED 7:41 PM
So, I don't fuck. Up...
WED 7:41 PM
Lol is right. Apologies for the unrequested childhood summary.
WED 7:42 PM
Hah
WED 7:42 PM
Lol. I don't mind at all. I've heard it more than once, but it's also good to hear it again.
WED 7:42 PM
I take pride in my white privledge.
WED 7:46 PM
Hahaha
WED 7:46 PM
What can I say.
WED 7:46 PM
Lol
WED 7:46 PM
I bet that book would sell. "My success with white privledge"
WED 7:47 PM
That is a joke and conversation much better suited for Matthew kilcoyn.
WED 7:48 PM
=)
WED 7:48 PM
Lol! =)
WED 8:02 PM
He had a rough upbringing as well. In a olor opposite kinda way.
WED 8:02 PM
I remember some. Of yours. But it is a distant foggy memory of those conversations.
WED 8:03 PM
