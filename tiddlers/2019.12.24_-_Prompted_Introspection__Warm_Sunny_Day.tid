title: 2019.12.24 - Prompted Introspection: Warm Sunny Day

!! How do you feel on a warm sunny day?

Same as usual: I'm probably inside. It may be warmer inside, but I may not be fully aware of it. I'm growing more comfortable with heat each passing year, but I'm grateful not to have to take my body to the thermal limit. Having worked in shitty physical conditions and lived in some tropical climates, my range of comfortable temps seems to have expanded. I think it's possible I've seen a drop in my testosterone over the years, and that may also have impact. I like warmth more than I did before, and I suppose that's a good adaption for climate change on average.

I try to go walking in the sunlight. I need it, and I know and feel I need it. That tends to be the warm sunny day I experience these days. So, when I'm actually out in the warm sun, I'm probably walking and talking with my brother [[JRE]] or my wife. That feeling is  hard to beat.
