I have two bags-- a small one for carrying my high use tools, and a big one for my rare use ones.   The big bag was not in the gang box.  We don't know where it went.  Yaaaay!
AUG 13 4:41 PM
Fuck
AUG 13 4:41 PM
fo real
AUG 13 4:42 PM
big money
AUG 13 4:42 PM
Ugh.
AUG 13 4:42 PM
That is a sinking feeling. I'm sorry.
AUG 13 4:42 PM
boss was upset about shit today too, was cranky af with me, even though he knew i was upset cause i couldn't find the bag-
AUG 13 4:43 PM
think everyone was pretty sure i had taken it home, so we were all trying to reserve judgement
AUG 13 4:43 PM
How much you think you lost?
AUG 13 4:43 PM
1500 maybe?
AUG 13 4:43 PM
Jesus
AUG 13 4:43 PM
obviously not that much used, but to buy it all over again
AUG 13 4:43 PM

AUG 13 4:43 PM
and a lot of it wasn't on the tool list, so they won't replace it
AUG 13 4:44 PM
so... i think im gonna keep it paired down-- i have no idea how long it has been gone-- so obviously I have been able to make due without most of that stuff
AUG 13 4:44 PM
sad to see it go, but won't necessarily stop me from doing everything, although a lot of people borrowed my tools, so they might have to get their own shit now lol

AUG 13 4:45 PM
pain in my ass
AUG 13 4:45 PM
you at school atm?
AUG 13 4:45 PM
And, destroys trust
AUG 13 4:45 PM
i don't think any of my coworkers took it
AUG 13 4:46 PM
Good
AUG 13 4:46 PM
hell, i probably put it down somewhere and forgot to put it back in the gangbox, and another contractor took it
AUG 13 4:46 PM
and i don't exactly have the moral highground on stealing
AUG 13 4:46 PM
You don't steal of individuals.
AUG 13 4:46 PM
from*
AUG 13 4:46 PM
i've been so fucking scatter brained
AUG 13 4:46 PM
Dude, I've been wondering how you're keeping it all together. Seems like it has been insanely busy.

the other day, when we got the call about viper, I drove it to the parking lot, and just got out.  There is a pump nearby, so i couldn't hear that it was still running

i got no room to complain, rebecca is doing 80% for real.  She never wakes me up at night, and I asked her 3 times today if she wanted me to pick up matthew from her mom's and she says no.  
AUG 13 4:49 PM
can't tell whether she is afraid of asking too much of me, or she just wants to have more time with him
AUG 13 4:49 PM
imagine it is the former
AUG 13 4:49 PM
gonna raid tonight?
AUG 13 4:50 PM
i wanna encourage MC raid for a chance to get that weapon
AUG 13 4:50 PM
what weapon?
AUG 13 4:50 PM
I did some MC last night (though stupidly didn't get the quest
AUG 13 4:50 PM
They keyed me. Been so long since I keyed.
AUG 13 4:51 PM
also, that build has so much more utility spells than anything we have tried... kinda crazy
AUG 13 4:51 PM
Built for raiding and a tiny bit of PvP, I think
AUG 13 4:51 PM
(Work is going well. I have all of them right now in the lab. I adore the lab.)
AUG 13 4:52 PM
how many atm?
AUG 13 4:52 PM
The weapons we need drop in ZG, I think.
AUG 13 4:52 PM

AUG 13 4:52 PM
was 40
AUG 13 4:52 PM
Is that the one we need?

AUG 13 4:53 PM
he had one of each
AUG 13 4:53 PM
 
AUG 13 4:53 PM
the damage listed on it isn't accurate
AUG 13 4:53 PM
maybe i should contact him and make sure where they drop
AUG 13 4:53 PM
his DPS was insane
AUG 13 4:54 PM
aye
AUG 13 4:54 PM
he said he can go way higher than what we saw in certain situations
AUG 13 4:54 PM
Also, we should test for differences in our parsers just to make sure they are accurate
AUG 13 4:54 PM
we were doing mostly single target, must be nuts
AUG 13 4:54 PM
k
AUG 13 4:55 PM
i imagine the longer you play with peeps, the more accurate they get
AUG 13 4:55 PM
get some regression towards the mean goin on
AUG 13 4:55 PM
Also, I have RE's listed up on the wiki. if you see any of them, please don't sell
AUG 13 4:55 PM
k
AUG 13 4:55 PM
i think im gonna go grind some cash
AUG 13 4:55 PM
I rolled the 80% cleave RE last night
AUG 13 4:56 PM
and respec into what he has
AUG 13 4:56 PM
no shit :)
AUG 13 4:56 PM
nice
AUG 13 4:56 PM
how many runes have you done??
AUG 13 4:56 PM
or did you pay gold?
AUG 13 4:56 PM
Imho, you should grind dailies and dungeons for Mystics Runes (or whatever they are called; the left most one)
AUG 13 4:56 PM
I did gold once just see if costs scale up, and they do
AUG 13 4:57 PM
...
AUG 13 4:57 PM
wtf, maybe shit only scales up at 60?
AUG 13 4:57 PM
i did a bunch of them before 60 and they did not go up...
AUG 13 4:57 PM
Maybe we should use alts to do BoE stuff
AUG 13 4:57 PM
Also, I'm enjoying the healing role
AUG 13 4:58 PM
i should prolly spring for the spec thing
AUG 13 4:58 PM
I may continue to down that road
AUG 13 4:58 PM
i just wish the double dp was still here
AUG 13 4:58 PM
yeah, spec thing is worth every penny
AUG 13 4:58 PM
kinda want the flight path thing too
AUG 13 4:59 PM
bank would be the one that seems most worthy to me
AUG 13 4:59 PM
I have to carry a full set of gear around with me, and I don't like that
AUG 13 4:59 PM
with 4 specs, it's the only way to change on the fly
AUG 13 5:00 PM
I switched to healer last night mid raid, and it made it smoother. My DPS is still garbage compared to the vets with gear.
AUG 13 5:01 PM
nice-- good utility
AUG 13 5:02 PM
the bank is only useable in instanced or rested areas
AUG 13 5:03 PM
still have to complete the build, wanted to see if I could collect a bunch of souls and not invest in drain soul, lol
AUG 13 5:03 PM
Yuck
AUG 13 5:03 PM
aye
AUG 13 5:03 PM
so still good on raids i suppose
AUG 13 5:03 PM
but, not worth 35 dollars...
AUG 13 5:03 PM
they got a pretty slick little money maker
AUG 13 5:04 PM
No doubt, especially with seasons where you have to buy stuff again
AUG 13 5:05 PM
was pretty illuminating to hear they used to let you use honor to get a spec
AUG 13 5:05 PM
aye
AUG 13 5:05 PM
But, they have a monopoly on a very unique take on WoW. Guess they will squeeze it for everything they can. I wonder if it will ever be taken down.
AUG 13 5:06 PM
Damn, was just reading the stuff from ghost.  I like how despite how I've never seen the man, I can hear a voice I his writing.  Daggers of kindness... sounds like a man worth meeting.
AUG 14 2:28 PM
He is a good man.
AUG 14 2:29 PM
Also, we think [[k0sh3k]] is getting to the final interview at Yale.
AUG 14 2:30 PM
They asked for her references.
AUG 14 2:31 PM
Fuckin aye.
