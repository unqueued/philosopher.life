title: 2017.11.17 - Prompted Introspection Log: Unusual Ride

!! Recall an unusual bus, train, or plane ride.

I have many, so I'll limit it to three.

* Post-Vasectomy 20 hour nightmare trip to Thailand
** I had a vasectomy a few days before moving to Thailand, but it didn't go as smoothly as we'd hoped. We had a problem, and I had to visit the ER hours before we left. My wife and I had a 2-year-old and a 3-month-old on a 20-hour trip where I was in significant pain. 
* Greyhound trip to St. Louis
** I was 11, my brother 9, and we traveled to St. Louis to visit Von (very interesting woman, a box of contradictions, but devoted to helping human beings [much can be forgiven]). It was an interesting journey, and I'm glad we did it. This was before mobile phones proliferated. I could not imagine my children doing this in today's society. 
* Denver Mission's Trip Bus Girl
** This is the most fucked up one. We went on a packaged/planned mission trip to Denver, visiting the soup kitchens, working with children, etc. It was eye-opening in many ways. Each of the mission teens got paired with children on a bus headed to the Denver Broncos stadium, and this little 7-year-old girl next to me kept trying to touch me, sexually. I kept having to push her hands away and tell her it wasn't appropriate. I was stunned. This girl was so sexually abused it was how she connected with men in her life. I told the adults who lead the mission, but I don't think anything came of it. =/
