title: 2018.11.29 - Computer Musings: Memory

I finally did it. I crashed my computer due to a lack of memory. I usually keep a good eye on it. Oops! 20 years ago, I could not imagine burning 32GB of memory (including swap). Fuck, my hard drive was 3GB at the time, roflmao. I was fly as fuck with 128mb of RAM coming off that goddamn Commodore. Today, I'm looking at 128GB and think: yeah, I could use that eventually, no sweat. The worst part is that memory prices have basically stagnated. I have to buy used at this point.
