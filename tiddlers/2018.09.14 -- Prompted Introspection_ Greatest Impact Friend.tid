title: 2018.09.14 -- Prompted Introspection: Greatest Impact Friend

!! Which friend has had the greatest impact on your life and why?

My wife. We live our lives together. I got married at 19 years old, and I only really have memory of 14 of them. I've been married for 13 years. Half my life, and almost all of my politically autonomous life, has been spent with my wife. Those are just the obvious facts.

Do you think I'd be writing these words without her? Ha. I wouldn't be alive. I wouldn't want to live without her. I've said it before: if she dies, I'll complete my fundamental obligations to my children and then end my life. There is no life without her. I can barely stand a complete day without the woman; I'm physiologically and psychologically dependent. People think this is a bad thing. I just don't see why. It's at the point where I'm not able to distinguish myself from her in my reasoning in so many cases. 

I'm not a Christian anymore, but I still powerfully appreciate the spiritual notion of marriage. I'm not joking in [[k0sh3k]]. Theologians will see the moves I have made here.<<ref "l">>
