title: 2017.11.07 -- Retired: Apology Log

!! About:

I need to apologize. I need to think about what I'm apologizing for and to whom. It's time to start apologizing more because it is useful to apologize. I want to be the kind of person who apologizes more frequently about consequential issues.

!! Principles:

* Be humble, willing to change, and do your best.
* Be specific about what you did wrong, about what is wrong with you are, and how you hope to improve.
* Tag the content for those you are apologize to.
