!! You had a disagreement with your brother about what makes a good parent. What do you think about it?

We were talking about a way in which I was failing my son. I'm trying to fix it. My brother felt that my standard was too high. He said it was so high that it made every parent a bad parent. 

I don't see anything conceptually wrong with that possibility. I conceded that while it wasn't good given the standard of parenting, perhaps it was good enough for the standard of human parenting. But, even then, I am not convinced my standard is too high.

Granted, I often don't know how much of the good we can feasibly partake of in a particular instance, and so I'm not always in the best position to judge the line of rightness. I realize ought implies can. I also recognize just how extensive the possibility of "can" extends to each of us in so many cases. This is why people are very often mistaken about the line I draw.

I also worry my brother is annoyed with me. I believe he doesn't like how high of a standard I hold my own donors to, and I assume he doesn't want to think he should be evaluated by such a high standard when he is a parent.

Time and time again, I find I achieve the best results in the long run by having a high standard and lowering it only when I have good reasons. I consider it pragmatic perfectionism.
