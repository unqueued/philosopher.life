title: 2020.02.07 - Prompted Introspection: Exciting Quality

!! Which quality best describes your life–exciting, organised, dull–and why?

Uh, I don't know. That's a hard question to answer, and maybe it needs more perspective. I consider myself radically disorganized given what I have, a failure beyond comprehension. Have you seen this wiki, Samwise? Shambles. My {[[Focus]]} is a joke. I really want to be organized (and organized [[irwartfrr]] toward [[The End]]). To be fair, there are some existential places where my organization has an autistic clarity. However, by-and-large, it's messy, by-ear, poorly executed, unmapped, and a pile. I'm retarded, which is fine (at some point, that isn't up to me), except I shoot myself in the foot (and others suffer for it) by often not choosing to work on my weaknesses.

I don't think I'm dull. Most people find I am dull though (perspective, again, matters: whatever desires and sensitivities and [[salience]] do you hold or pick out?). My interests seem absurd to the point of appearing meaningless to most people. And, if I'm  not dull to people, it's usually because I'm painful, frustrating, disgusting, annoying, exhausting, and, in a sense, still not exciting in a positive manner.

It depends on how you catch me, the circumstances. There's plenty going on in my head, but outwardly I may not show much. I don't find my life boring (I have to fight trying to immerse myself in fun things; I'm obsessive), although I will have bouts of feeling like nothing is as meaningful to me (which doesn't mean it isn't objectively meaningful) as usual; no, usually I find it implausible, infeasible, and overwhelming. I go to bed and wake up thinking, swirling and pointy. I have a hard time "turning it off." Depressants and snuggles with passively watchable shows are usually the only thing which will help me chill. 

I can't say I'm exciting in a fun way. I'm a stimulated person though, hypersensitive in many cases (completely inert and passive in others though). I sift for [[gems]] enough that I'm desensitized to a great deal too. There are many drugs in my life, most of which aren't standard substances, and unfortunately, my teleological disorganization demonstrates my lack of wisdom pretty constantly. I hope my children will understand my failures and actively fight whatever demons I have passed on.
