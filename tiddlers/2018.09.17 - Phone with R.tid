title: 2018.09.17 - Phone with R

[[R]] is one of the reasons I write in my wiki. Seriously, except the beginning of this wiki ([[2016.10.17 - Letter to Mom and Dad]] from [[To and From: My Parents]]), my letters with [[R]], starting here [[2017.01.10 - Letters with R]], have been unknowingly the second oldest [[Find The Others]] application on this wiki. Before I even knew I was engaging in [[FTO]], I reached out to my mother(~~-in-law~~). She has been a guide for me in writing this wiki and thinking about life. It has been quite a journey in the desert. 

I asked her about what she thought I should do. She said that I need to make sure I am safe, and that my safety is her concern. I feel the fear of risk and the [[hope]] of love. She said that she understands the feeling of turning the other cheek here. She feels [[The Moral Law]] deep inside her; I can see it. I believe she felt the weight that I am holding; it is tremendous. I told her that I think we would fail to reconcile, and she appeared to agree while maintaining the possibility that they could change (she does not believe she could turn away from her own children for any reason; we discussed this as well). One critique she offered of my Golden Rule is that she is worried it is to too approval-seeking; I cautiously disagreed (respecting what she meant quite a bit), but agree that this is a crucial concern to think about.<<ref "ap">> I am grateful to her for trying to think about it both ways with me. She said she does not know, and she says it is not her decision to make and only I can do it.<<ref "c">> She said she would think and pray for me.

She also told me disturbing news at the end. We were talking about the fact that her retirement is becoming this insanely difficult thing to accomplish (I voiced my hesitancy at calling her for this reason, since I know her load is heavy<<ref "s">>), and apparently the stress has caused what appeared to be a cardiac event last week that caused her to visit the ER. She just got word today from the doctor that it was not a cardiac event, and that we should not be worried. She asked me to tell my wife, and I explained that I would do my best to tell my children. She does not want anyone to worry about her, and so she doesn't want to cause a fuss.

<<footnotes "ap" "I discuss approval seeking through this wiki. Unfortunately, I think the affective and cognitive empathy of the [[The Moral Law]] means we must take the reasons of others to be our own reasons, to some [[dok]] (i.e. [[irwartfrr]]). Their approval, even as some ideal version of their identities shed of their morally arbitrary characteristics, particularly in [[The Original Position]] in the classic Rawlsian sense, really does matter. The Ring of Gyges is still a matter of theoretical approval even when there is no one to practically approve or disapprove.">>

<<footnotes "c" "She gives me the guarded advice of Elves and Fremen!">>

<<footnotes "s" "She assured me that the day she couldn't pick up the phone for me is the day she would be quiting whatever prevented her from picking up.">>
