title: 2018.10.04 - Wiki Audit: Hermit Crab Switch

My daughter and have spent much of the day trying stuff out, thinking about whether or not we just want to make our own plugin. [[Sphygmus]]'s flexbox is something I'm going to use; it's amazing. There are some particularities I still prefer differently. We're constructing the wiki from scratch and importing the tiddlers in. 

~~Hotkeys are broken for me in this one!~~

Looked through my snapshots. It's the autocompletion plugin that breaks it for me. I have to let that plugin go again. =(
