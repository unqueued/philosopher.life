*** Fuck that. They are straight up evil. They really could have known better. They've chosen their lives. They had all the information they needed. No motherfuckers, I'm going to hold you accountable. You don't get to treat those who get it right like shit for most of your lives, profiting off it, and not pay the price for the all the privileges afforded by your evil. Fuck you.

*** I feel ahead of the curve. We were cordcutters back in 2006ish. We've lived on torrents for a long time (usenet, direct download, and other networks to some extent as well). I have a different view of my drug usage here than others, and that's in part because I've had far more access than others for a longer time. I've been binging without ads for over a decade now, and so a lot of the thoughts these people have seem to be creeping up on where I am at. Add in my politics, and perhaps we will see more people moving this direction.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** http://liberty.princeton.edu/Publications/asplos18_hmtx.pdf
*** I never place enough emphasis on the need for building hardware designed for multi-threading (in a non-embarrassingly parallel sense). I love the goal, which is to write compilers designed for automating this task. I wonder how this relates to something like [[Rust]]. Obviously, this is way beyond my paygrade.
** https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/29/teens-desert-social-media
*** I don't think people have defined "Social media" well enough. Did my data get transmitted to you? Tell me why it isn't social media, please.

*** Uh, I didn't realize this was a problem. =/

* Think About It
** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289618300552?via%3Dihub
*** You mean those who are intelligent will seek to preserve their genetic advantages over others in the market? I'm shocked, I tell you. Being moral is hard, and that's why it's so rare.
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17861078
*** I use DDG maybe once a week. Sometimes, the cost of trying to extract information from its results are simply not worth it. Infinite scroll google after polluting my profiles is hard to beat.
** https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/a-majority-of-u-s-teens-are-taking-steps-to-limit-smartphone-and-social-media-use/
*** My children use their phones, no doubt, but they spend the vast majority of time on their desktops/laptops. This was by design. I think the productivity and raw control of diving into the deep end from the beginning will have a massive pay off for them in the long run. It already does.
** http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167218768779
*** Have you stopped to consider the possibility that expertise as a signal can be radically wrong? How do you think paradigmatic progress is really made? Before Snowden, I was accused of being a conspiracy theorist by the average person. Now it's common knowledge. I think you need to evaluate what counts as epistemic justification itself. It turns out to be a much deeper problem that you don't get to just help yourselves to as scientists. You are obligated in the dialectic to concede the territory to which you have no right. The problem, essentially, is that you have to admit that epistemic moves and lack of trust actually turn out to be the most justified positions! This is closer to the fundamental problem of philosophy than most people realize, imho.
** http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/the-way-of-the-dao/2959238
*** I see this as doing fundamental philosophy. I also don't think it's been systematically computed. The real complexity which arises from it, imho, is still something best understood through a Western philosopher's lens. Yes, I am a culturalist, and I think I do appreciate the cross-cultural issues this school of thought is talking about. I love the contrarian nature of the Dao, and it's clearly philosophical. I consider it a gateway to the issues though.

*** The entire situation sucks. I really wish people had the moral integrity not to verbally abuse her about this. I wish we could forgive each other and move on somewhat (I know it's not that simple), and instead I think everyone is getting fucked. =(
** https://medium.com/@cmmhartmann/from-silence-to-sound-a93f742fae88
*** Does it allow you to maximize your utility, to be a better person, or to see [[The Salience]] more effectively? You seem to waffle. I'm glad you shared your experience.

*** Bitch, you don't get to pawn this off entirely on someone else. You are just as responsible for that lack of implementation of socialism and decentralization of power as anyone. That you think you can peel the economic apart of the political so cleanly is a sign of confabulation.
