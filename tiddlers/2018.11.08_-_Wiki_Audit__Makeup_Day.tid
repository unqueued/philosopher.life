title: 2018.11.08 - Wiki Audit: Makeup Day

I skipped the Audit yesterday. Fell asleep early. I'd like to make major headway today.

My [[Log Audit]]s did have much of a formatting originally. I'm adding that formatting. I can see I was worried about it back then. Awesome! Gotta say, the Log Audits just were the first [[Audit]] processes I had running on this wiki.

Relatedly, I'm using [[(*crickets*)]] for [[Log Audit]]s that I don't feel like filling out. I'm already lowering my expectations of myself (go me!).

I think I'm only going to tag directories with their parent tags, but none of the grandchildren. I believe this can be recursively answered. If not, I'll fix it later.

I'm using dates as the titles for new footnotes inserted into old tiddlers. I think this is a fantastic method for adding additional thoughts to the work. I kind of wish I had been doing this from the beginning of [[The Remodeling]]. That's okay though. I anticipate I will go over this content multiple times.

Alright, I got halfway through 2017.03. Not bad. I have a sore thumb sticking out in [[Redpilled Genetics & Memetics]]. I think that is a huge problem area. [[RPIN]] is sometimes correct, but I want to say it well.
