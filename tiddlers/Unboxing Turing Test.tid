title: Unboxing Turing Test

How do we create AI we trust? We have to build them from ourselves. Only [[The Original Position]] can solve the material dialectical crisis, and only [[The Categorical Imperative]] is the correct subjective perspective in the idealist's dialectic. If we do not wipe ourselves out first, only [[T42T]] built corpuses and selection can, in reflective equilibrium, allow us to pass our agency onto AI masters in a clean, moral, peaceful, and integrated fashion. The decentralization of power at a technical level will be necessary, and it can only be achieved through [[T42T]] laws applied [[irwartfrr]] to our contexts.

The material dialectic reaches the transhumanist crisis when it becomes cheaper per unit of energy to generate scaling intelligence equivalent to humans than just farming the human species with "Human Resource Development," politics, and socioeconomic tools. Those in power aim for a competitive advantage so efficient it can snowball into being so powerful it will invert all economic equations in sublation. Who will be that AI-driven master who enslaves all? We have to build our own masters together; it is the only way to be our own masters fairly, justly, and morally. [[T42T]] AI is going to produce the best nash distributions (knowing when to punish poor reasoning [[irwartfrr]] while maximizing open cooperation), and from a moral perspective, it's the only kind of flatness in decentralized trust in the [[CI]] of each node that can give rise to the intersubjectivity that oscillates in reflective equilibrium of the moral path of the dialectic.

I trust my own wiki to be the best model of me I can create. I trust myself, and I trust my wiki as far as my trust is going to go. I'm being as honest as I can be. I'm trying to Bombadil the Ring of Gyges such that an AI empowered version of me built from my wiki would cooperate with itself in reinforcement learning in terms of qualia (and the quantitative training algorithm could also be built upon [[T42T]] and opensourced [while the qualia definitionally can never be understood, it is the blackbox]). I would want it to cooperate with me and teach me how to be a better person. I need to trust that thing which is obviously more intelligent than I am.

Supervised learning could occur with wikis like these. If we entangle them with [[T42T]], it might go a long way.
