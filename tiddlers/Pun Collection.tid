title: Pun Collection

Abandon hope all ye who enter here. The humblest absurdities, the clearest unintelligibilities, the simplest mindfucks will make you want to kys. Some of them are dark, some of them are anti-humor, and some of them are just boringly "ironic" one-liners that force the audience to question the validity and value of their own existence. I need to keep puns out of the other collections; it's an infection control problem. Also, this is the most sadistic part of this wiki, by a long shot. I need a pun here.
