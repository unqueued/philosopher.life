title: 2018.07.10 -- PPP: Mind and Causal Exclusion

http://www.iep.utm.edu/causal-e/

<<<
The causal exclusion problem is the leading objection to this view, and it is based on the causal exclusion principle, which stipulates that events cannot have more than a single sufficient cause.

Do you mean all the way at the beginning, the unmoved mover cause, or do you mean that no one particular effect can have two causes. Are we in dialethea territory? Undermining and overmining.

I'm not a physicalist. I believe in metaphysics. Ultimately, it appears physics has a metaphysical cause and end. I don't know what it means to be a nonreductive physicalist; that sounds insane to me, like you are trying to have your metaphysical cake and physically eat it too while calling yourself a physicalist.

<<<
The causal exclusion principle conflicts with the nonreductive physicalist view that behavioural effects have a sufficient physical cause and a distinct mental cause.

Well, this is tricky. What is [[The Good]] exactly? I think my ability to attend to meaning itself somehow arises from more than the material. Do I see value as a property out in the world? Maybe. I'm open to other kinds of ontologies here, though I do not understand what it means.

I am with Chalmers in claiming "mental states have qualitative or intentional properties that are irreducible to physical processes." Whatever is involved in perceiving salience in context, if it is not a game (and it's not), must require something truly profound between the relationship of ontology and epistemology.

I just don't know what is meant by mental cause here. I'm sorry. Again, [[The Good]] seems to be a metaphysical thing which causally reaches into my mind, is found in there, is partially computed, is to some non-trivial realist extent represented there. The mental represents something not physical, and I don't know what it really means to say that all the way down.
