title: 2018.10.22 - Be A Good Dad: Unemployment

My children and I discussed unemployment statistics. We walked through what they actually mean, how they are calculated, and essentially how these statistics are wielded to gaslight us. We discussed the increasing suicide rate, drug usage, and decline of health in the US. We discussed what it means for the US to borrow in its own currency and who appears to be in control of the fed.
