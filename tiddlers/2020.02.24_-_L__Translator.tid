[5:33 PM]  h0p3: How's your weekend going?

[9:39 AM]  Sohalia: Hey! To answer your question, it went well enough. [[K]] had it rough, as I’m sure you’ll hear, but aside from that it was good. Got to clean the house some, write some, been doing some more digging into what direction I want to take my work life.
[9:39 AM]  h0p3: Sounds like a solid weekend.
[9:40 AM]  h0p3: Sorry [[K]] had it rough =/
[9:40 AM]  h0p3: (we didn't get any cleaning done this weekend, and it shows)
[9:41 AM]  Sohalia: I feel that. I still have some laundry to take care of myself. Clothes are the bane of my existence. :laughing:
[9:41 AM]  Sohalia: On a job note: I’ve realized that the most fulfilling part of my job currently is my corporate communications position, so I’m considering diving full deep in that direction.
[9:41 AM]  Sohalia: I feel like it’s a flexible enough set of skills that I could do it for anyone anywhere, which puts me in a good position to cast a wide net.
[9:42 AM]  h0p3: I have no idea what is entailed in that world, but I think it fits your skillset, background, and personality.
[9:43 AM]  h0p3: It's good that the net can be wide too.
[9:45 AM]  Sohalia: Well, right now it entails (1) being told what to say (2) thinking about how that thing should ACTUALLY be said (3) adjusting what I’ve said if anyone finds it confusing. 

I basically get to be an advocate for my audience with my department. Cause there are SO many times that our management wants to keep some issue under the radar or keep the details hidden for no logical reason.
[9:52 AM]  h0p3: You are a translator.
[9:52 AM]  Sohalia: Exactly! Which I tend to do a lot in my every day life anyways, so it works out.
