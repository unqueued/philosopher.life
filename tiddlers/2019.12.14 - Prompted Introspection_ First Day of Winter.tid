title: 2019.12.14 - Prompted Introspection: First Day of Winter

!! How do you feel on the first day of winter? Why?

This is a day. It might be a winter day. Cool. I think the most interesting aspects of seasons for me boil down to global warming, the tilt of the urf, and the spirals of time. Generally, I'm not thinking or feeling much about the season though. You see: I stay indoors a lot, and I fucking love my onesy and my blanket. I like that the cat decides I'm worth at least my warmth. I probably feel anxious and depressed, hungry, horny, and probably vacant with a hint of despair. Hopefully, I'm coming with the same inevitability as the first day of winter.
