Hey Jon,

I've been thinking about your interview with Damon McGregor (we were peers in one of your classes). I have some thoughts for you.

Your description at this timemarker (https://youtu.be/zELaTWPfZNk?t=890) reminds me of a metaphysical kind of hyperobject (something like Timothy Morton's OOO). I saw here (https://youtu.be/zELaTWPfZNk?t=3560) that you are already familiar with OOO (you certainly know more about the topic than I do), so perhaps I've said absolutely nothing useful to you. 

Your Kantian prison explanation of the flowers on the chains of your oppression is an apt description of what I'm feeling. Skepticism just isn't satisfying. I'm reminded of the Cratylian point from Gorgias: 

# Nothing exists. 
# Even if something did exist, nothing can be known about it
# and even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it cannot be communicated to others. 
# And, finally, even if it can be communicated, it cannot be understood.

This central ancient problem has had many cross-cultural religious and philosophical investigations. I'm fighting against it. Oddly enough, the above reminds me of The Four Dog Defense:

# First of all, I don't have a dog.
# And if I had a dog, it doesn't bite.
# And if I had a dog and it did bite, then it didn't bite you.
# And if I had a dog and it did bite, and it bit you, then you provoked the dog.

I dearly hope it is rhetoric. I want my life to be meaningfully meaningful.

You were always a fascinating teacher for me. You were the first philosopher to show me the Continental tradition, more importantly, your openness was refreshing.

I never quite fit in or got along (I did my best to be polite), but I'm grateful to have learned what I did. After discovering very late in life that I am autistic and dealing with being surprised by so many false top-down models of the world, I have found that I may be on a similar philosophical path as you. For example, the computational theory of mind has been very important to my understanding of my own autism and philosophy in general. I look ahead on the road, and I see you've been down it. I intend to read your work now. As I progress down the trail you've made, I'll be writing my thoughts about it here: https://philosopher.life/.


Sincerely,
