Hello Teacher,

I saw your interview with Damon McGregor (we were peers in one of your classes), and I was moved by it. Upon inspection, I see you left a destabilizing splinter in my mind, and it has been eating away at me for years. I've found it necessary to review my notes of your classes, and now I'm diving into your book. It's remarkable and a radical departure from my comfort zone. I can tell I'll need to re-read it several times (perhaps I should have finished it entirely before contacting you). I hope to walk across the analytic-continental bridge you've been building in Speculative Realism. 

Although I wouldn't be surprised at all if you've seen it already, I come bearing a semi-related gift which might be of interest to you: 

https://github.com/FormalTheology/GoedelGod/blob/master/Papers/2017/LogicaUniversalis-HajekAndersonControversy/main.pdf

It's neat, =), and I think you might enjoy geeking out on it too. 

I'm giving you my naive gut feel on it. Perhaps fundamental philosophy is above my paygrade, so feel free to dismiss my thoughts as useless gibberish. With vicious bottom-up undermining reasoning, I'm often stuck in my own autistic rut in my vain pursuit of reducing uncertainty in the Bayesian equation. Take me to be Cratylianly pointing to this or (whatever it means to say it) something beyond it. Finite and fallible, being just a part of the whole, I cannot model the model of all models. It is my plight to try anyways. God damnit, I refuse to be quiet about the ineffable. So, with vertigo, here is my babble.

Perhaps there are many names for it. Some call it God, others The Good, and so on. To me, it is that which gives meaning. My gut tells me to remain curious about the Gödellian "positive" property. How else can there be meaningful meaning?

To my understanding, the Principle of Sufficient Reason (PoSR) results in the modal collapse of the conjunction of all contingent truths (CCT), as it appears something necessary must be the sufficient reason for CCT, lest we fall into something like Russell's Paradox. I do not know what it means for necessity to cause contingency. So, paradoxically, it appears the PoSR necessitates the CCT, eliminating the possibility of contingency altogether.

The modal collapse is one of my fears, since I think it destroys differentiating meaning by flattening the world into equivalent unity. If everything is necessary and thus positive, then what does it really mean to say something is positive? Necessary and positive compared to what? Isn't contingency necessary for meaning? Isn't the dialectic between necessity and contingency necessary for there being a dialectic at all? Surely this is not just an illusion collapsed into a singularity. I'm a greedy bastard who desires both the parts and the whole cake too.

The "positive" property reminds me not only of a dialectic against what is not positive, but it also reminds me of binary computation. I desperately do not want all of my 1's to be reduced to 0's! I take it to be the case Gödel proved there are always more things that are true than you can prove, and that perplexingly gives me great relief. I suppose meaning has to be computable but extend beyond the limits of computation as we can conceive of it. I do not know what it would it mean for meaning to not be computable. Whatever it means to say it, meaning seems to begin with a true contradiction into self-computing infinite regress.

Perhaps I must learn to deanthropocentrize myself, to paranoically stop privileging my own relationships to objects or perceptions of meaning over other kinds of objects. In a way, this flattens meaning too. Brand me a crazy person, but I'm legitimately considering the possibility of the PoSR or the Law of Non-Contradiction as simultaneously true and false. Let me say, this is not where I expected to end up in my philosophical journey. I think you helped turn me into a mystic, dude. 

Any guidance would be appreciated. Perhaps there are particular sections of your book which answer


Sincerely,

Hey Jon,

I've been thinking about your interview with Damon McGregor (we were peers in one of your classes). I have some thoughts for you.

Your description at this timemarker (https://youtu.be/zELaTWPfZNk?t=890) reminds me of a metaphysical kind of hyperobject (something like Timothy Morton's OOO). I saw here (https://youtu.be/zELaTWPfZNk?t=3560) that you are already familiar with OOO (you certainly know more about the topic than I do), so perhaps I've said absolutely nothing useful to you. 

Your Kantian prison explanation of the flowers on the chains of your oppression is an apt description of what I'm feeling. Skepticism just isn't satisfying. I'm reminded of the Cratylian point from Gorgias: 

# Nothing exists. 
# Even if something did exist, nothing can be known about it
# and even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it cannot be communicated to others. 
# And, finally, even if it can be communicated, it cannot be understood.

This central ancient problem has had many cross-cultural religious and philosophical investigations. I'm fighting against it. Oddly enough, the above reminds me of The Four Dog Defense:

# First of all, I don't have a dog.
# And if I had a dog, it doesn't bite.
# And if I had a dog and it did bite, then it didn't bite you.
# And if I had a dog and it did bite, and it bit you, then you provoked the dog.

I dearly hope it is rhetoric. I want my life to be meaningfully meaningful.

You were always a fascinating teacher for me. You were the first philosopher to show me the Continental tradition, more importantly, your openness was refreshing.

I never quite fit in or got along (I did my best to be polite), but I'm grateful to have learned what I did. After discovering very late in life that I am autistic and dealing with being surprised by so many false top-down models of the world, I have found that I may be on a similar philosophical path as you. For example, the computational theory of mind has been very important to my understanding of my own autism and philosophy in general. I look ahead on the road, and I see you've been down it. I intend to read your work now. As I progress down the trail you've made, I'll be writing my thoughts about it here: https://philosopher.life/.


Sincerely,
