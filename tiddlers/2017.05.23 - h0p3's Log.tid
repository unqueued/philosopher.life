!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

It's fine. I'm still trying to recover from my lack of sleep from the other night. I ate a lot today. I've still been experiencing thought loops. I need to do something about it. 


---
!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

When my brother [[JRE]] was getting married, I remember talking to my dad about the fact that I wished I could be my brother's best man. I was sad that I wasn't considered.  You know my dad's response was?

<<<
You got what you deserve.
<<<

It was dripping with his standard judgmental venom. This wasn't prefaced or said kindly. It wasn't meant as constructive criticism. It was meant to be a stab. It reminds me of my Christmas as a 12-year-old where he said to me "You are the most selfish person I have ever met."<<ref "1">> Regardless of whether or not he is right, that is not how he should say it to his child. I'm tired of his shit. 

You know what I think? Fuck you, you dark-triadic asshole. You don't even deserve to breathe oxygen. Even your Holy Bible will tell you that. You think you care about children? Look at the suffering of your own children. You are the cause of their suffering. You clearly don't care. You should have taken Paul's advice; you shouldn't have had children. You are a terrible parent. It would be better if you never contacted your family again. Seriously, we'd be better off without you. That's the least you could do for us.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

My father lacks empathy for his children. He is a psychopath to a significant extent in this context.<<ref "2">> He damages his children, and his wife justifies it (which makes her a psychopath too). I'm tired of dealing with them. Every time I see them, it is ultimately just painful. Nothing good comes from it. I meet and talk with them because:

# I somehow still love them. Why the fuck would I love those who lied to me, manipulated me, and abused me? 
# I want to be wrong about who they are. I'm literally in denial.
# I'm conditioned to do so. I'm actively trying to fix that.
# I legitimately hope my children can have a good relationship with their grandparents, even if I can't. Can I trust they will be good to my children even if they weren't good to their own?

My parents want to see their grandchildren for selfish reasons. They want the warm fuzzies. They don't care about the damage they actually incur at the end of the day. They blind themselves to it. They really are classic baby-boomers. 

It has been eye-opening to get to know my mother-in-law. She's not perfect, but her behavior actually shows love. She regularly goes out of her way to ask me if I need anything. Contrast this with my parents. I can't even recall the last time they asked me that. They know we are in an incredibly vulnerable and difficult position, and they've done almost nothing to help us (besides attempting to buy their grandchildren's love). They don't even try to empathize. They don't even try to take responsibility for their creations.

I'm wishing my parents ultimately were different people than who they are. They are terrible human beings. I need to just accept that fact and move on. I have to protect myself and my family from them. 

They think I owe them respect. They don't deserve my respect. Let me reiterate: creators have the a priori obligations to their creations, not the other way around. They are human beings with basic human dignity, and that is the extent of the respect they are owed.<<ref "3">>

I think we both see each other as mentally ill. Maybe we are both right. Ultimately, they are more responsible for our situation though. Blame flows to those who had the power; power and responsibility go hand in hand. If you don't like your creations, guess who's fault that is?<<ref "4">>

I am angry at myself for having been suckered into being charitable to them for so long. I was correct about them as a teenager. I should have left them for good. It was a costly mistake.

!! What are you going to do about what happened?

I've decided to just start digesting my thought loops here. I'll have to inspect them, I'm sure. It's time to get it out.

<<footnotes "1" "I once told my mother about this, and she honestly didn't believe me. Fuck her too.">>

<<footnotes "2" "Recall that psychopathy is a spectrum. It comes in degrees. My definition here is 'choosing not to feel empathy for another person.'">>

<<footnotes "3" "Queue shitty religious or social convention argument here. They really don't have a sound //moral// argument.">>

<<footnotes "4" "Let's take the time to consider the possibility that I could dismantle whatever lame theory of free will they have in mind designed to conveniently abdicate their personal responsibility and narcissistically shape their narrative.">>
