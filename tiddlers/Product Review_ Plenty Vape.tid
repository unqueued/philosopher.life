* 4/5
** It's still pricier than I think it should be. German engineering brand-name premium? I'd like to see a generic of this tool built.
* I can't smoke anything. Combustion burns, plus I need to puke. I can use this though, albeit with significant coughing.
** I'm lucky to be able to hold for the recommended 3 seconds.
* Convection, wide-mouthed chamber hits strong with low-resistance pull, and it's shockingly efficient.
** Take the well-designed whip+chamber off and freeze it immediately after your last hit. Your flower will last forever. It's ridiculous.
*** Yes, rapid changes in temperature should add to the wear and tear, but the whip is cheaper than the product to merit it.
*** Might as well pack the chamber instead of using the pad.
*** Also, don't modify the whip itself (it's not meant to be uncoiled).
**** Some replace the coil, but that has to be mistake. The coil is so well designed. 
***** Additional cooling might be worthy for some though.
*** Even with almost daily use, it's difficult for me to use a gram a week. It's in the neighborhood of being as cheap as ramen noodles.
**** And, I've yet to make an extraction to see how far it goes.
* Safety feature is annoying but rational, analog and mechanical is a huge plus, it's super simple to use and replace parts on, and you can dial in your usage.
* Start at low temps, and ramp up after vapor stops being produced. When you can't get vapor to come out, it's done. Simple.
** Save your ABV (which is nicely chocolate, never burned).
* It's not terribly portable, but it's well-suited to a desk.
** Custom foam inserts would be my suggestion for travel.
** I don't see why the ridiculously expensive Volcano is better except in terms of sharing and not being completely tied to an outlet. 
*** Also, get a promo code.
