This is a page literally about me, [[h0p3]]. Perhaps you are thinking: isn't that what both this wiki in general and {[[About]]} purport to be?<<ref "1">> Why the redundancy? 

I can't quell these fears, and even worse, I'm going to temporarily set aside the objection without any justification beyond the claim: this page exists because my gut is convinced I need this page. I can't quite see why yet, but I hope I will. I don't know what the future holds here. For now, I'm going to play it Loosey-Goosey and go with the flow.

As usual, most of this is impolite to say about oneself. It comes off as arrogant, lacking in humility, deceptive virtue signalling, dark-triadic, or cryptically self-important. But, guess what? My life is important to me. I want it to mean something, even if it only means something to me. I might not be doing a good job of it, but I'm at least trying. I'm wandering, throwing off my dogmatic yokes, and doing my best to find the truth in the desert.

I believe most people would despise what I'm trying to do, what I aspire to be, what I think I'm engaging in, precisely because they are scared of it. I must move past their judgment. It's okay. I will not take myself lightly. I may never succeed, but I will not give up. My goal is to become a [[Eudaimonic Lifehacker]].

** finding himself; finding [[h0p3]].
