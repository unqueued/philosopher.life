It just keeps coming up: we model the universal from the particulars. They do get that right. That is the empirical aspect, the inductive step, the leap of faith, the finite modeling of the infinite, the reductive necessity for the [[fff]], the contextualist's point which we pray to anti-luck our way into solving sufficiently, the fundamental problem in philosophy, the relationship between our epistemology's real+truthful access to ontology, the non-simulative aspect of our simulation, the love of wisdom.
