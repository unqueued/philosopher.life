!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

I'm doing well. My sleep continues to be interrupted over and over. I sometimes wake up with pressure or mild headaches. I am sleeping though. I'm pleasantly surprised to see that my sleep schedule is remaining stable even without the alarm clock. The week off has been nice. Conversely, k0sh3k's sleep schedule has still not improved. I've tried to make it better for her, but I'm not sure it is within my power to help her here. 

I'm still taking care of my nails. I've definitely had them in my mouth to bite them but retracted. 

I had some wine the other night. I've not had much of an urge to drink though. I can feel not having the cannabis, but it's quite livable. I take this to be a good sign since I am on my week off (where I'd normally be tempted/need it the most). Getting back to work next week is hopefully going to put the nail in the cannabis coffin for me, or so I hope. 


!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

Lectured kids about programming ourselves. My son has strong incompatibilist intuitions and even offers some of the basic fitting anecdotes and arguments for it. I'm helping him see the compatibilist light. It's key that he understands how autonomy is reducible to programming ourselves over time. The more fundamental homunculus of incompatibilism cannot exist and/or is irrelevant. I've planted the seeds. We will cultivate them together.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technologic, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

I'm trying to help my children understand the value in being meta about programming themselves. I want them to develop a {[[Principles|Principles of Programming Myself]]} section for themselves. I want them to take charge of their lives and to evolve into more autonomous beings. I wish someone had sat me down and done this with me. It's obvious that we should all do it. I'm helping them the best way I know how. 

One recurring theme for me with my relationship with my parents is that my success indirectly serves to highlight their failures. When I see what they did with what they had, I'm less forgiving, especially given their attitudes towards me today. It seems hypocritical of them at the very least. Essentially, there doesn't seem to be a way for both of us to win. I have to stop worrying and thinking about it, except insofar as it is necessary to root out the flaws in my own parenting and self (and highlight or improve upon the good). 


!! What are you going to do about what happened?

I should think more about how to help them. Accountability has to be done well (I'm not good at this...I'm prone to anger). Offering good arguments, leading by example, and encouragement are useful and positive. Self-mastery is very difficult to teach when I don't really have it myself. It is a lot to ask. 

I probably should be careful in how I push. I have that "GO GO GO!!!" mentality. I must hold it back, reign it in, and quiet it somewhat. One of my interconnected vices is pushing too hard on others (perhaps myself in many cases), or at least pushing in the wrong way. I have to realize that being autistic means that I lack the right sort of theories of mind necessary to persuade and nudge outside of brute force. I am intelligent enough to intellectualize socialization, however non-guttural it is for me. I should do so. My lack of social skills (and the expectations of others) holds me back from success and happiness in many cases. This is an area to intellectually and emotionally learn. I need to practice it. Why? Because I am engaged in the science of my children's happiness.

Also, I need to fix the dryer. I keep putting it off. I know I might fail. I just need to try it. The cost is buying a new dryer and installing it. Why not? At least try to save yourself some money. Look at it this way: assume you have to buy the dryer anyways. Assume the cost is already going to paid. Now you can tinker and attempt to learn on something. This is a learning opportunity that you normally couldn't afford. Go get 'em!
