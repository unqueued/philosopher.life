How's your day going?
FRI 11:04 AM
Started it in the er —heart running wild but now I am home resting
FRI 11:05 AM
!
FRI 11:05 AM
I am glad you are resting. =(
FRI 11:06 AM
How’s your day
FRI 11:06 AM
Bah it’s ok —may have to look into an ablation
FRI 11:06 AM
And I need the rest so its all good
FRI 11:07 AM
I'm worried for you, and you are also making me think my wife is working too hard as well. It's the end of the semester, and it's a mad dash. She has a billion things on her plate.
FRI 11:08 AM
I think [[K]] is feeling the heat with his papers and exam.
FRI 11:08 AM
Yeah end of the school year is rough
FRI 11:09 AM
I will be out just faulty wiring
FRI 11:09 AM
But extra rest for [[k0sh3k]] would be good too
FRI 11:10 AM
Err I will be alright that is
FRI 11:10 AM
The Dr has even said its genetic but probably on the McCormick side ...
FRI 11:11 AM
How long they make you wait in the ER room?
FRI 11:12 AM
They don’t —they always take me right away
FRI 11:12 AM
Makes sense to me. Sounds terrifying.
FRI 11:13 AM
And I am usually good in 10 mins but then I get to wait for blood tests
FRI 11:13 AM
Make sure there is no stroke or damage
FRI 11:13 AM
So its a couple hours
FRI 11:14 AM
It was scary at first but now it’s old hat
FRI 11:14 AM
Lol.
FRI 11:14 AM
That is comforting.
FRI 11:14 AM
Mary has it too —it’s a gift I could do without :blush:
FRI 11:15 AM
Not that it is comparable, but the weaker physiological effects of anxiety feel old hat enough that I don't worry so much about them (which, I think think actually helps with the anxiety).
FRI 11:15 AM
Yeah I can understand that too
FRI 11:16 AM
Mine really is not life threatening just inconvenient
FRI 11:16 AM
Also, I'm doing well. I received a letter from someone who calls themselves Ivan, DeathOfRobinhood. I keep running into the art crowd a bunch. Writing a letter to them. Lots of letter writing.
FRI 11:17 AM
Is it good correspondence?
FRI 11:18 AM
The [[Find The Others]] {[[axiom]]} has transformed how I use my wiki. I devote way more time to interacting with others than my usual work. I think it's good correspondence; it's honest, and I construct myself with the other as best I can. For a hermit like me, it's a way to actually build relationships too.
FRI 11:19 AM
Good idea!
FRI 11:20 AM
Little Dude and I are off to nap land —will talk more later :sleeping:
FRI 11:21 AM
See ya! Take it easy.
