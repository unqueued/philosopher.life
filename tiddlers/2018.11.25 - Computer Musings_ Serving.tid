title: 2018.11.25 - Computer Musings: Serving

Ugh. Github is throwing up two new errors. First, "Page build timed out." Now just build error. Getting spammed about it, which I appreciate! 

There is a possibility that my wiki is simply too large for the limits they have set on their build system. That sucks. I was really getting to enjoy relying upon them to serve a single webpage for me. I enjoyed not having to handle any of the backend bullshit. I could always just lazily abuse Cloudflare (gross!). I'm not sure what I want to do at this point.

Serving blank TW works. Rollback didn't. There is something different on their end.

Hrm, two hours later it seems back up at least on https://m6ram.github.io/. However, I still don't see anything on https://philosopher.life/. Alright, settings for custom domain has been reset? I'm not sure what's happening. The custom domain modification appears to be on our end. We're resetting it.

[[j3d1h]] has the fix; she thinks the custom domain is being overwritten by our local. She went: delete wiki-real-time directory, git clone m6ram.github.io repo, rename directory to wiki-real-time.

Robots.txt and favicon added to git script.

Yikes. ATL is also throwing up errors. Logged into SSH once to reboot. After reboot, I can't even SSH into the VPS! Tried from VPS client area. Also no go. Other services are up and running.

`nmap -sV -sC 167.160.87.100`

Shows it's not up. What (or whom) turned off SSH?

Hrmm...

```
root@h0p3:/etc/ssh# sshd -t
Missing privilege separation directory: /var/run/sshd
```

`mkdir -p /var/run/sshd`

Voila.

Fuck. It doesn't survive reboot.

Hrmm...`mkdir -p -m0755 /var/run/sshd` is already in `/etc/init/ssh.conf`

Ticket created. They say it's because I'm using a non-standard port. This doesn't even work when I switch back to 22. I could run some ugly-lazy non-fix hack to mkdir on boot and start ssh. Meh. Note, I'm still running btsync instead of resilio sync on this server though! ROFL. I think it's time to remake it.

I have to renew the subscription in 6 days anyways. Cybermonday on lowendtalk is wonderful. Budgetnode has been excellent. 512mb RAM, 20GB SSD, 1TB Bandwidth, and a shitty core (throttled) for a dollar a month has been excellent for two years. It works.

Looks like that will replace Kimsufi, despite the lack of drive space. Asked about Manjaro/Arch. I am tired of Ubuntu and Debian.

USB backup made.

---

Attempting persistent encrypted Manjaro installation on a 64GB USB drive I've found. It ain't fast though.

---

Upgrading Resilio Sync. They force paused my syncs. *sigh. I do hope that a good tool will come to replace this bullshit.

---

I went for the TragicServer VPS. $30 a year instead of $12 now. I don't care for the OVZ6 kernel requirement, but I think I can work around it.

And...same problem on this VPS. Has something to do with an upgrade.

Can't chattr it.

Ah, they have Debian 9 though. Otherwise, onto CentOS 7.

libc6 requires a kernel I can't have, /cry.

`Failed to get D-Bus connection: Connection refused` from CentOS. =/

Alright, so I basically just can't upgrade. Welp. Okay.
