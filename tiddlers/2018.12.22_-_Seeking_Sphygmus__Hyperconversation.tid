title: 2018.12.22 - Seeking Sphygmus: Hyperconversation

//A trail of thoughts.//

* This is it! This is the multi-threaded [[hyperconversation]]. I think it's practically fractal and rhizomatic.
** There are responses everywhere! It's gorgeous. It's fucking EPIC! `/turns-on-the-EDM`
** There are so many threads, I will not be able to maintain the context. Citation and reference are too explosive (which is fine; it may be how we escape hyperreality itself in Simulation and Simulacram, at least internally); if I need to do better here, let me know.
** I suppose this isn't <<tag [[To]]>> or <<tag [[From]]>>. It's <<tag [[With]]>>.<<ref "tb">>
* It is possible I must now [[hyperread]] you to even have the chance of [[deepreading]] you; I consider that a glorious problem.
** I am now contending with the possibility that I will not be able to keep up. I am excited!
*** Triage. [[New]] first, then work through your docket? Sounds like a reasonable plan to me.
** I will not be able to cleanly talk through it all bit-by-bit, though I am reading closely.
* Tiddler listing shows more changes than [[Recent]]. This is the tricky part I've experienced with .tids.
** I need to find a solution to this issue. 
* Tagged monthly audit logs in the body; that feels idiomatic to me. I will need to keep that in mind.
* [[k0sh3k]] is going to love //General Reference//, lol.
* So many tantalizing missing tiddlers!
* I almost went nearlyfreespeech too. I still might as a backup plan/fallover.

This is going to sound so fucking arrogant (//surprise!//), but there may not be too many solid examples of people building their wikis together, constructing hyperobjects so heavily cross-referenced (we might be the first to have anything like this). It is, in some sense, a joy of mine that I purposely design part of my wiki which can't be understood without yours (you are a keeper and maker [not just a witness] of part of my identity). It's freeing to feel like I don't have to preserve the context all by myself and not to feel like I have to.

<<<
I have neglected the intro tiddlers on /''''/sphygm.us for an as-yet undetermined reason. Just not interesting to me? Unsure.
<<<

Imho, you should {[[focus]]} on whatever matters most to you. Sometimes you'll have explicit reason, and sometimes you'll only have your gut. If it's not interesting to you, then set it aside. If it ever does become something you want to do, then you'll do it then, eh? Part of my goal is to sprawl and dig deep when I like I'll strike oil. [[The Remodeling]], however, is an exhausting process with that kind of freestyling; so far, I think it is a worthy price to pay. I feel like it is related to learning to trust oneself.

<<<
I'm using my Root tab more and more as I remodel, and my private wiki merely starts up with the previously open tiddlers (something which doesn't work with a static page, I don't think).
<<<

That may be your browser's "open previous pages" function. I like to be able to re-spin-up my workspaces like that as well. It's part of why I'm moving my wiki workstation to yet another browser (FFDE for browsing, FF became [[h0p3]]'s identity container, and now I really just need an uninterrupted, wiki-only browser that functions again, lol). The browser makes or breaks development in the wiki for me. Singlefile and node have some differences as well in this "memory," although keeping your storyriver can be done in singlefile by keeping the complete link structure in the URL bar.

Somehow the wiki magic requires embracing the ever-evolving [[remodeling]] grind from what I can tell (it's a very slow autonomy). Looking through snapshots to see your doorways to your own hyperobject evolve is lovely. It's a key part of the telling ourselves the story of ourselves.

<<<
UGH I have like flailing arm thoughts about his comment on the APFVD structure. I agree that it doesn't work for me, especially after having literally copied it into several of my tiddlers back in August & September, and then taking it out as I audited them this week. I'm curious where he sees it not working for me in my wiki right now...given [[my aha! moment|181005 â€“ wiki: definitions!]] about structuring, my wiki feels much more //my own// and less //borrowed from someone else//, though the nods and similar moves are obvious. Perhaps those are what he's seeing?

At any rate I'm going to assume this is a thought based on, as his title suggests, a "mile high view," and see how it develops from there.<<footnote "butt" "naaahhh I'm still a little butthurt -- not butthurt, but sad? pouty! that I'm not yet speaking //myself// loud and clear from the wiki, as his comment suggests. helloooo insecurity.">>
<<<

I should have said that more gently and correctly. I'm sorry. That wasn't my intention. I do not mean to make you feel bad in the least here. I'm exploring something which has some similarities with my wiki but is not mine (and I can't say I'm the best explorer). You have your own style, goals, and mechanics, and it's my pleasure to figure it out (you've been doing that with my wiki for months!). That you decide to find what works for you (and that will always evolve too) is a good thing; that's what this tooling is all about, imho. I am open to the possibility that years from now, I will abandon my own [[APFVD]] structure too (I have no idea what that would look like). This tool is ridiculously flexible; it's like a medium/dimension I slog through, and it allows me to slowly (and perhaps poorly) transform myself.<<ref "w">>

I adore NIN (even if I've yet to figure out how to add it to [[Music: Library]]). I was once saw an interview with Reznor talking about Cash's cover of //Hurt// which basically said it wasn't even his song anymore. Cash made it his own (and I like the cover more than the original). Your wiki really is your own. I think that's awesome. I will maintain that [[The Right]] is particularized to your context. I'd like to think that Leibniz and Newton might collaboratively have found each other's differing approaches to calculus fascinating. This is a profound learning experience for me. I'm looking at myself as I look at you too.

Despite many years of studying the concept, I cannot define freewill. I have relegated myself to being a mystic here; it's faith for me. I think almost all of my identity (or maybe even all of it, depending how far we go here) is borrowed and the result of dialectics.<<ref "c">> None of my words or ideas are exclusively my own (I am not [[The Unmoved Mover]]). I want to celebrate the fact that your identity becomes embedded in mine in a non-zerosum way (and vice versa); I think that's what empathy is like.

Unfortunately, I am sometimes forced to understand your work by contrasting it to my own (it's like an anchor-crutch to me). My claim that it is not working for you might just be this: I don't see you using it much. I have no problem with that. I still don't know enough about your wiki. This is my first time seeing your self-modeling with this kind of richness. It's wonderfully overwhelming to me.

If it is any consolation, I still feel like I'm never clear enough in my wiki to myself or to [[others]]. I assume it's the process and method that matters most. This problem is dizzying, and frankly, most people don't have the ballsack to even try to engage in it. You are being bold, loud, and clear. I think you take a unique kind of risk (the only kind worth taking!) in the public exploration and modeling of yourself. I will never be as good at understanding you as you. I think it is better to blame me here for not being a good enough listener. I cannot see it all once (I understand I never can, but I can get closer). I will listen carefully.

<<<
Really the Focus link just serves as a quick way to edit that tab and has nothing to do with the particular APFVD structure. Perhaps I should rename it..?
<<<

That makes sense me. That's how I saw it. I'm working on figuring out how to set up all the transclusions for the sidebar myself. That monster keeps growing.

<<<
In a straight forward sort of way, the use of `:` in [[define:]] is a relic from my //define: wiki//, //define: awareness//, //define: the forest// days. I removed the word //define:// from those titles entirely, but kept the colon in its tiddler title... I think it just //feels// more open ended like even the title is asking the question, you know?<<footnote "lang" "So much of my writing and style is not visible to me. My SAT/ACT tests and most of my college papers indicate that I have a good grasp of grammar and language usage. Like [[h0p3]] says, I've been virtuously habituated into the structure of language for //years// now. Having two English teachers for parents certainly helped with that! Also diagramming sentences, and just reading a ''shit ton'' as a kid. At this point, I'm not consciously thinking about my grammar or the feeling of my writing -- it just happens from my gut. I still struggle with using the passive voice too often, though.">>
<<<

That makes excellent sense. I like that it's an opened ended "what am I defining?".

Tangent: your section on the ready-to-hand mode of not even having to consciously think about your grammar when you write reminds me of thinking into our machines again.<<ref "tt">>

Speaking of books for kids, do you have any that you would want kids in the Appalachian Mountains to read?

<<<
...perhaps explaining myself takes the interesting-ness out of the thinking about it
<<<

Even this sentence is boldly writing about yourself.<<ref "m">> Do you mean this makes it less interesting to you? Fascinating if that is the case. If not, I totally get being worried about writing something mundane for [[others]], but I am convinced the wiki is first and foremost about taking yourself seriously. I beg you not to be too harsh (unless you really, really want to). This is your place, and it my privilege to see your beliefs and desires.

<<<
Qualia is not my entire mazeway but informs it in large part.
<<<

I adore this claim. I think it points to a realist position. 

Also, mazeway is an excellent word. Do you think it's different from a reality map?

<<<
aNd I kNoW hOW tHiS soUNdS, like 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps' but that's not the same thing. It's incredibly necessary to acknowledge and recognize the effects of circumstances, of contexts, of the structural and symbolic forces that shape the world around us and the way we see that world. And then, once you recognize these circumstances, //''as the person embodied within them''//, a space opens up for you to see even the tiniest opportunities for resistance and freedom. And //then//, within that space, with those opportunities, you can 'rescue yourself.
<<<

Preach, yo! =) 

What do you call that trollish Mocking-Spongebob-style/memefont/doohickey? Spongemock is my current best choice. It's hilarious and lovely. ~~I would like to know more about it (even though I might be able to guess with some degree of accuracy). That's the kind thing I'd be tempted to script. Hotkey and bam, you've got one of many signature voicestyles in your pocket (might be something you even cycle a couple times until the right randomish structure in the text pops up...I do not know the rules).~~

Someone has delivered us from evil (updating i3 for this): https://github.com/dhildebr/spongebob-case

//The Solitude of Prime Numbers// screams out of your wiki!

I will add, at least from my own understanding, that exegesis (when contrasted to eisegesis) is about reading //out of// (rather //in to//) a work. It is an issue of charity (I do not claim to be skilled in this high art), an attempt at objectivity, etc. I can't say I succeed, nor do I claim these are conceptually coherent hermeneutical notions (but I think they are better than nothing).

I think they would make it even easier to nest your writing (since you embed the footnotes as a kind of end-line footnote/annotation) -- I assume you regularly extract out text into footnotes too.">>
