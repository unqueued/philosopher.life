title: 2017.11.27 -- Polymath Craftsman Log

Worked on my wife's present. After visiting her office, I see she may not even really love it. Although, were I in here shoes, this would be absolutely crucial to me. Let us hope that in time she will see it the way I do. 

Tweezers, superglue, with patience and testing fixed it up. It lives! I think we will be in good enough shape to do this. The rest of the work isn't exactly Craftsman work, despite it being the Science in Art.
