SEP 20 11:05 AM
Itâ€™s a book festival at ECTC â€”which is great! But the kids are not excited so having to be herded like cats
SEP 20 11:08 AM
Oh, it sounds like it would be way more fun with no kids at all, lol.
SEP 20 11:09 AM
Yes or just my own kid
SEP 20 11:10 AM
No doubt.
SEP 20 11:10 AM
But its Friday!
SEP 20 11:11 AM
That is one of my favorite parts about working with my public children. It's a reminder of how much I like my own.
SEP 20 11:11 AM
Gotta study math stuffs for Sunday test
SEP 20 11:11 AM
Heck yes, Friday ftw.
SEP 20 11:11 AM

Oh, lol. Cool.
SEP 23 1:40 PM
Think I am gonna stay and study at school
SEP 23 1:40 PM
Maybe take it here too
SEP 23 1:40 PM
I have no idea how you do it. I want to leave the moment I can almost every time (unless I'm in a conversation with gh057).
SEP 23 1:41 PM
ðŸ˜Š
SEP 23 1:41 PM
Well my desk is big and my chair is comfortableâ€”less distractions less mess
SEP 23 1:42 PM
Oh, yeah, I know that feel.
SEP 23 1:43 PM
I think I could find more things to do at home...
SEP 23 1:43 PM
Eat â€”napâ€”watch tv....
SEP 23 1:44 PM
I have no room to talk, lol. I walk into my home, I'm probably going to be disappointed by my offspring's output, a trashed living room and kitchen, I will feel the pull of my vidja or the couch, and I've spent all my spoons, the gas tank is so empty when I look at it.
SEP 23 1:45 PM
Finding a way to focus makes sense  to me.
SEP 23 1:45 PM
I hope it is a quiet, productive, and yet serene space for you tonight.
SEP 23 1:46 PM
Yeah I think I better just stay....or I wonâ€™t get it done
SEP 23 1:46 PM
Thank you!
