*** Hilarious. Blame the victim. No, social media is not the ultimate bogeyman. It's a problem, but the real issue is capitalism. You are begging for a reason besides the truth.

*** Only the wealthy can use the government to prevent their own exploitation.

*** Thank you, thank you, thank you!

* Confirm My Bias
** https://www.nngroup.com/articles/authority-principle/
*** Manipulation
** https://mic.com/articles/187807/want-to-grow-the-us-economycancel-student-debt-new-report-shows#.wYKiVBTJl
*** Sounds obvious, but I'm clearly biased.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/teenagers-learning-online-porn-literacy-sex-education.html
*** Reminded me to talk to my kids about this issue today. It's crucial that they understand the different between reality and fantasy.

** http://neurosciencenews.com/social-interaction-addiction-8445/
*** And this is why I don't have the same social media addictions (although, to be clear, I'm definitely dependent on a number of tech tools)

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/mozilla-announces-an-open-framework-for-the-internet-of-things/
*** Such a good idea. That I didn't even think about this confirms I have huge blindspots. I hope it takes off.
** https://www.quantamagazine.org/gil-kalais-argument-against-quantum-computers-20180207/
*** I clearly have no idea what I'm doing.

*** [[Atropos]] may just be a pipedream

* Think About It
** https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/08/stanford-professor-mccarthyism-antifa?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other
*** I'm not sure we are there yet. I see it though. Thiel's influence is no joke.
** https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-08/how-the-places-that-don-t-matter-fueled-populism
*** This is an odd way of peeling it apart.
** https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/08/vladimir-putin-russian-election-iran-zimbabwe
*** I don't know what our response should be. We have our own fire to put out, in a sense.
** https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/
*** The phrase "opportunity cost" needs to be in there. Learning to say "no" is fundamentally a part of directing our lives.
** http://www.eurocanadian.ca/2018/02/invasive-species-hidden-natural-cost-of-immigration-diversity.html
*** I agree that "they took our jobs" is a valuable thing issue. The problem, of course, is capitalism itself. Immigration is not the flaw. Be angry with the elites, but please, do so for the right reasons. 
**** We have to craft a socialist memeplex to inject into the world before it is too late!

* Fishy
** https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-deep-state-conspiracy-is-how-fascists-discredit-democracy
*** Look, the Right Conspiracists are 99% crazy as fuck. And, yes, the article is right to point out the insanity. However, the unwillingness to admit the fundamental centralization of power in the hands of the few is not an accidental blindness either. Some variant of a deep state exists, obviously. I'm just as disappointed in your lack of objectivity here.

*** That is likely no accident. It was removed though.
** https://medium.com/@aldamiz/how-we-grew-from-0-to-4-million-women-on-our-fashion-app-with-a-vertical-machine-learning-approach-f8b7fc0a89d7
*** Hype. Also, I think this is a bad thing for a number of reasons.
