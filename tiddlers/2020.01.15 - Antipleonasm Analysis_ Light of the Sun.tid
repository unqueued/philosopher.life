title: 2020.01.15 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Light of the Sun

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
; Lumen soli mutuum das.
: You are lending light to the sun. 
<<<

And, what is wrong with that? Does it brighten or pick out what is [[salient]] more effectively? Is it sufficiently effective to be worthwhile? Clarification, like redundancy (which is what the aphorism is usually about) is not always appropriate, and it can even lower the [[S2NR]] of a dialectic as a distraction or waste of energy. It depends. 

It's a striking sentence to a Kantian Platonist though! It is as though one's autonomy becomes instrumentally valuable to those perceiving what is reflected and picked out by [[The Good]]. As quasi ends in themselves, maybe one does lend light to the sun in some sense. Ah, I am not qualified to know.
