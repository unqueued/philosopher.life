Screenshot of some black magic wizardry, lol! I see two tiddlers in a story river, the top being her default style and what appears to be a changelog. Below is tiddler of my previous letter to her, and somehow a stylesheet which emulates my wiki's style for that tiddler (if I understand correctly) given the "from h0p3" tag.

* Title: 180914 - Fm h0p3: Monolith
* Tags: from h0p3, h0p3

My style is right there. I never even thought about changing the wiki to do this; I didn't even know it was possible. I am tickled. Lol. I'm gonna have to think about how far that can go.
