title: 2019.12.06 - Prompted Introspection: Four Things

!! What four things are most important in your life?

The conjunction problem arises immediately for me again, [[2018.02.05 - Prompted Introspection Log: Quad Max Value]]. Let me add that there is a difference between what I take to be most important in my life and what ought to be (and arguably even what is, in fact, in some sense). Further, it might be useful if you give me a timeslice. I will assume you mean my [[4DID]] here. I also would like to know what you mean by "thing" here, since that's fairly broad. There's a host of various kinds of important questions in here.

* Reality
* Justification
* All other forms of normativity
* Tool for thinking and applying the other three.
