title: 2018.06.16 - Prompted Introspection: All-Expenses Paid Vacay

!! You have one week to do whatever you want, all-expenses-paid, what things would you want to do? Where would you go?

Melisandre, you make it too broad for me. All-expenses-paid could technically mean I own everything for a week, right? You are the one who has fronted the ability for it to be paid; you are the guarantor of this (which means I don't have to know how you did it, right?). I would radically redistribute power, decentralize it. 

That, of course, is not what you have in mind. 

Of those things which can normally be bought, I would obviously go into space.
