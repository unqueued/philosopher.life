This movie hit me so powerfully, I wanted to put it straight into the //God-like Cult Classic//. It punched me everywhere. It was an existential masterpiece. I'm fresh from viewing it for the first time, so I can't even see straight. I must temper my expectations, and I must nurture hope wisely. I must digest it. I must bring out my big guns and laser beams. It's time to think, and even if I can't put it into words, I must bury myself in it.

Kevin Spacey is an actor I have always despised. He is a bad actor; yes, he only plays one role. But, I forgive the one-trick-pony, in fact, I admire it. I know what that means, that raw competitive advantage, that crystalline blind beauty of the one min-maxed function perfected qua itself. Spacey is not a bad actor. Sure, he's a bad actor in general, in versatility, etc., but he's not a bad actor. In fact, he is extremely talented at presenting a particular kind of face: a psychopath. 

He is a virtuoso psychopath on screen, at least a brand of it. And, it is obvious that he is a psychopath to the core. His real life demonstrated that to us, slowly, but I knew all along. I know it when I see it. It is no accident that he breaks the 4th wall so often in his films, even glances of it that other actors are never allowed.

Its literality is breathtaking. It reified the concept so hard that what's on the screen physically hits you through the air; your body can literally feel the thing. 

This was art. Art that passes the ultimate of turing tests: even when you know it is an art-test, when you know you are being tested on its artfulness, when you know you are supposed to pick every flaw out you can possibly imagine, and especially when you know you aren't supposed to call it art, you know it is still art. Honesty requires it of you.
