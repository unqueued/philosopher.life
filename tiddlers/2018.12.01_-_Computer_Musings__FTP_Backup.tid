title: 2018.12.01 - Computer Musings: FTP Backup

I like to have backups. I want to be able to recover from catastrophic failures. Currently, [[m10]]:/home/h0p3 is backed up to HTPC, dimbob, and KS. I will be dropping Kimsufi after these many years. I'd like one more offsite. I picked up this very odd shared-hosting plan for $.49 a year for FTP access. I'm still considering picking up jailed SSH access for $2 a year. I am concerned that they will not allow me to use up that much CPU and RAM though. In my experience, nobody intends you to run heavy usage software inside these jails.

The other solid option is duplicity or some other rsync based option. Encrypted incremental backups would be nice. I wish they were compressed though. Hard to beat the resilio sync option. Being able to reproduce m10's home from anywhere with just a key is nice.

FTP is wildly easier and they aren't going to tell me to stop; there's no fucking around with the jail either. Hrmm.

Picking up the SSH anyways. Even if this is a scam, I'm interested. Funnily enough, I have cronjob access, and I could eke out control with that. I think I'd rather play it safe though and just official SSH jail instead.

~350mb memory usage from hypercored on dallas, ~70mb here on my VMed arch install, and...I can't even touch dimbob. What's up? Why did I lose access? Asking my bro.

Cleanup some sync archiving and settings on dallas. It's burning so much. Good news is it can download as much as I can. It's just upload that counts against me.

Setting to just a week. I don't have a ton of space.

`(curl -s wget.racing/nench.sh | bash; curl -s wget.racing/nench.sh | bash) 2>&1 | tee nench.log` is still amazing on Dallas compared to KS too. Download speeds are almost gigabit to some datacenters. $2.50 a month cannot be beat overall.

Perhaps I should consider the storage-based VPSes. If I could mount them and then software RAID 0 across them with Dallas, I'd be able to build a sick fucking seedbox. I would like to snowball all the content off myanonyamouse.

I dream of a day when SSD storage wipes HDD's off the map. In fact, time to edit {[[Dreams]]}.
