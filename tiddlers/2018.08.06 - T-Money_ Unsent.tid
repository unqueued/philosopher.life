Dear T-Money,

At Berea, you used to joke about we humans each being a "box of contradictions." I'm forever indebted to that analogy. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me about it.

I'm sorry if I did a poor job communicating over the phone in our last conversation. I hope life is going well for you.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
