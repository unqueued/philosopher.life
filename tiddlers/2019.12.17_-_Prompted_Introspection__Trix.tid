!! How do you feel when you play a trick on someone?

It depends on the circumstances. 

I'm not all that tricky. I like tricks in standard games though. Iocane powder and The Kansas City Shuffle with gross bluffs, feints within feints within feints, and everyone forced to ride wild assumptions. But, what rich information advantage game doesn't have that? Have you ever watched LoL professionals throw skillshots that make no god damn sense except against other professionals? Magic can be filled with many orders of bluffs and postured telegraphs in the eternal formats. Heavy prep against particular strategies often boils down to allowing you to employ muscle memory just enough to consciously steer the battle off asymmetrical cliffs, and that is also a feeling.
