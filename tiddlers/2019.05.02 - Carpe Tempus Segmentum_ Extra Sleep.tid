* I woke at 6, but ended up with half-brain sleep until 9.
** I needed it.
* medfirestretch
* fruit and vits
* I've been playing more idle games. I'm hunting for idles games that allow me to play almost pure idle with tiny bursts of click (with some thoughtful strat). 
** Waste of time, skinnerbox, pure sim drug, yadda yadda. Yeah, I know. I'm escaping for a bit into...virtual productivity! Lol. So stupid.
*** You can spare 5 minutes here and there.
* Made sure porch was set.
* Read+Write
* I've been giving instructions for when I'm gone, but that hasn't been working out.
** Maybe we should take a day off to clean?
*** I would hate to break the habit formation of grinding. I need to strike a good balance with them.
* Work 
* Walked with wife
** Her head is killing her. =(
* Offspring made grilled cheese, tomato soup, salad, and fruit. 
* Beer and 3x BB
* Sleep by 12:30
