title: Redpilled Genetics & Memetics

//Redpilled// is a word I've studied and watched evolve in public consciousness for quite a while. It is imperative that you realize that the concept doesn't have to be reduced to mere alt-right misogyny and psychopathy (although, it definitely must account for these behaviors and perspectives). Being redpilled can mean being practical, stoic, intellectually honest, and pursuing realism about human nature. There is a kernel of truth which average 'Redpillers' are deeply correct about, even though they are wrong about so much. It need not offer moral prescription outside of epistemic normativity. This is ponerology; empathizing with humans means deeply understanding our flaws and selfishness while realizing it naturally arises from evolutionary processes.

Admittedly, this section has enormous cross-section with [[Realpolitik Speculation]]. I think it is different though. If you really want to answer the question: "Why is there evil?" you must pursue it like this. 

Here I examine that which [[Social Darwinism]], studied correctly, helps us understand. Our hardware is genetic and the software memetic, and both are highly affected by our environments.<<ref "1">> The following articles will therefore be concerned with instrumental redpills and descriptive (not prescriptive!) practical reasoning about fundamental homo sapien mental states and patterns, including: social rules of thumb, human tropes, economics, psychographics, psychometrics, memetic description, psychological hacks, social engineering, manipulation, influence, conditioning, training, and memetic programming. 

Yes, here we learn how the sausage is made. The goal is to become an adept student of human nature, come to grips with living computation, and to appreciate memes and memers for who and what we really are. Effective utilitarians are already here. Non-realist, non-cognitive, or egoistic Virtue Theory must openly admit it. We pull Kant screaming and kicking into here. But, even he must obey the call of Reason by definition.
