title: Emotional Reasoning

Why can't I trust my emotions? I think I can't trust my emotions more than the average person. Let me be clear, parts of my emotions are incredibly talented. 

I do philosophy in an emotional way. I've spent a lot of time training the right mental reflexes. In a way, many of my talents have a strong emotional basis to them. It just "feels" right to me. When I follow that feeling, I am very often right. 

Because I fail to empathize with the minds of others so often, so fundamentally in some ways, I am unable to form strong airtight theories of their mind in profound ways. I am constantly shocked at who human beings, who my family, who my friends, and who I am. I am bad an understanding who we are in important ways. My emotions on behalf others' emotions are often not accurate.

And, in important ways, my emotions on behalf of future self are not accurate. My lack of empathy skills has profound consequences. That means I need to arm myself against my emotional ignorance. I know I can't totally trust my emotions, so I need the right tools and pathways to learn how to trust them again. It's why I am writing this wiki.
