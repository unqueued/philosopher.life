Required text and software: Language, Proof, and Logic: Second Edition

You must buy a new copy of this book. It comes with software that must be registered under your name. Your homework grade comes from using this registered software - you can’t pass the class without it. Make sure you get the SECOND edition. If you need help finding the text: you can find a new hardcopy at Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Language-Proof-Logic-2ND-Edition/dp/1575866323) or you can buy a physical or digital copy directly from the source at Stanford (http://ggweb.stanford.edu/store). The manuals which come with the software are very useful. You can find them at: http://ggweb.stanford.edu/support/manual/.


Course Description and General Objectives:

This is an introductory course in symbolic logic, which will introduce the core concepts in logic through the study of sentential and predicate logic systems. After exploring some basic concepts in logic, we will focus on sentential logic. Here, we will be interested in the symbolization of natural language, truth-functions, truth tables, and constructing proofs using the Fitch language. In the latter part of the semester, our focus will be on predicate logic. We will be interested in the basic concepts of predicate logic, basic semantics for predicate logic, and constructing proofs using a system of deduction for predicate logic.


Program Outlines:

Elementary Symbolic Logic (PHIL1210) will introduce students to the core concepts of logic. Classroom activities, reading, and homework assignments are designed to help students understand issues in logic and to become familiar with basic systems of symbolic logic. The study of symbolic logic aids in developing the capacity for abstract thought, and students will learn to apply the skills learned in logic to concrete arguments encountered both inside and outside the classroom.


Philosophy Department Learning Outcomes:

    Students become acquainted with a range of thinkers, topics, and methods.

    In both classroom discussion and written work, students should demonstrate the ability to analyze ideas and present them clearly, providing arguments and evidence for their claims.


Specific Course Outcomes:

    To become aware of the core concepts in the study and development of logic.

    To discuss and think about the philosophical issues underlying the study and development of logic.


Course Requirements and Grading:

Homework (50%)

    There will be many homework assignments in this class. Practice is essential. You will be well rewarded for your effort.

    Students often study and practice symbolic logic together, outside of class. This is great. I encourage you to find study buddies! I want to warn you, however, that some students working in groups run the risk of not actually learning how to solve problems on their own. It is crucial that you can actually do this by yourself, since there will be nobody to help you on the exams. If do you study and practice symbolic logic with others, make sure you’re actually learning the content and problem-solving skills necessary for taking the exams by yourself.

    Since the pace of the class may vary, I will assign due dates to homework in class.

    At the end of the class (when I calculate course grades), 10% of your homework grade will be outright given to you. The reason is that some problems just don’t click with everyone, and I don’t want students completing most of their homework quickly and then spending hours trying to figure out just one of the problem. This 10% buffer provides you a degree of liberty to skip some problems which are most vexing to you (which often differ from person to person).


Midterm (25%)

    About midway through the semester, there will be a midterm exam. I will announce the date in advance.

    The midterm may be curved based on the performance of the class as a whole.

Final Exam (25%)

    The final exam will be given during the final exam period, which is scheduled for Friday, May 8th, 1:00-5:00pm, and will take place in the usual classroom.

    The final will be cumulative, though it will focus on the material from after the midterm.

    The final may be curved based on the performance of the class as a whole.


Lateness and Absence Policy: Homework submitted late will receive only half credit. Exams missed because of an unexcused absence cannot be made up, and will receive a failing grade.


Cheating and Plagiarism Policy: Getting help is fine. Working together on homework is fine. Simply copying answers is not okay. If I have evidence of cheating or plagiarism, I will refer the case to the Honor Board. See: http://tulane.edu/college/code.cfm.


Office Hours & Contact: I encourage you to come to me with any questions you have related to the course material or your studies more generally. Please feel free to stop by or to schedule an appointment with me.


No class on the following dates:

    February 16th (Mardi Gras)

    February 30th; March 1st, 3rd, 6th (Spring Break)

    April 29th (Study Period)


Schedule - Our schedule will be a bit flexible and subject to change. I will announce assignments in advance. You should expect homework to be assigned every class. In this order, and at the pace that I see fit, we will cover as much of the following as we can over the course of the semester:

    Chapter 1 – Atomic Sentences

    Chapter 2 – The Logic of Atomic Sentences

    Chapter 3 – The Boolean Connectives

    Chapter 4 – The Logic of Boolean Connectives

    Chapter 5 – Methods of Proof for Boolean Logic

    Chapter 6 – Formal Proofs and Boolean Logic

    Chapter 7 – Conditionals

    Chapter 8 – The Logic of Conditionals


Section II - Quantifiers

    Chapter 9 – Introduction to Quantification

    Chapter 10 – The Logic of Quantifiers

    Chapter 11 – Multiple Quantifiers

    Chapter 12 – Methods of Proof for Quantifiers

    Chapter 13 – Formal Proofs and Quantifiers
