Plox MADE the item with the RE... doh
SEP 4 11:48 PM
no wonder that dude had multiple items with the same RE, prolly knows the ilvl needed for an expensive RE, and just grinds mats to MAKE it
SEP 4 11:49 PM
Might be a cheap way to roll
SEP 4 11:49 PM
yup
SEP 4 11:49 PM
it doesn't say its made by plox in a link, so i think the auction house link won't show it either
SEP 4 11:50 PM
also, because i have cleave and execute higher priority than thunderclap, tc has dropped to 1.5% of my dps, which means i have lost the 10% slow, which if it's happening to you as well, might account for some of the feeling that you are taking more damage than normal
SEP 4 11:52 PM
or maybe you forgot to put ice armor back on after switching specs, that's 20% slow too
SEP 4 11:53 PM
No, my DPS has dropped
SEP 4 11:53 PM
I will sometimes go for seconds with no white damage
SEP 4 11:54 PM
It's lag
SEP 4 11:54 PM
And, I don't know when it will hit.
SEP 4 11:54 PM
Overall, less responsive though
SEP 4 11:54 PM
yeah! I was having that white damage shit happen to me a week or so ago, very frustrating
SEP 4 11:55 PM
although, one time i thought it was happening, and in reality i had been disarmed

poison on your weapon triggers the elemental devastation, as does the leg RE that ute uses (arcane burst -- just a small DD with clearcasting buff)
