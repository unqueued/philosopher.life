title: 2019.09.12 - Afterschool Teaching: Dialectics

Whitney apologized for being late today. Prep was fine. One-on-one's were joyful. I feel a bit like a low latency whack-a-mole state machine as I have dozens of children grabbing my attention left and right, and I have to answer very quickly while maintaining the threads of the conversations I'm in.

I had a lot of children who were forced to sit with me today. I'm continuing to have to break 6NP and 6KA. Meanwhile, I had a ton of readers, chess, and magic games going on today. I'm lucky to have students who are interested in exercising their minds in their pseudo-yard time in this prison.

5CM and I talked about leisure as a concept, her computer, and her love of Netflix. We talked about piracy. 

Many questions about my own children today. I tried to walk them through the differences. Even questions like "What grade are they in?" can never be simply answered. I ended up showing them chatlogs with my own children. It's difficult to describe the difference. 

The librarian stopped by to see how we were doing. There's another big game tonight.

We attempted to speak about political philosophy today. They asked me why I feared for my children (among many questions). I have no idea how to build this fast enough for them. We discussed the centralization of power. 7G was paying attention, and we had dialectics. 

My children asked for full explanations of the ban. Unfortunatey, I'm not able to communicate the whole well enough. =/

Delp and I have very little to talk about. Our interests do not overlap almost anywhere. Speaking with [[gh057]] and Delp at the same time is interesting.
