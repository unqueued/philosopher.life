Hello, fellow babbler. 

Is the truth of your sentence hidden then? How do you know it is true? How do you know there is nothing more [[beautiful]] than what is hidden? What does it mean for something to be uncovered then? Presume the correspondence theory is correct, is it not more accurate to say the thing-in-itself, the truthbearer, is hidden than the truth? It appears one might access, though [justification, closure, completion, and coherence] are other matters, the truth of the thing-in-itself without fully uncovering or directly accessing the thing-in-itself. 

I agree that some aspect of the truth is always hidden to the [[fff]] because only [[The Infinite]] can reflexively compute Itself, including whatever relationship any object has to, in unification with, or toward [[The End]]. //Some// truth is hidden //to us//, necessarily, yes. 

We are so deep now that I now don't know how to interpret that word "nothing." Do you mean to roughly say ¬∃(x) or posit Nothingness as an object (or it that also a bad question for other kinds of reasons here)? So much hinges on that interpretation, it appears. 

To say the truth is the most [[beautiful]] thing is a fascinating claim, but [[beautiful]] to whom, given what context and perspective? There are so many truths I find profoundly ugly, the kinds which make me wish I didn't know the truth, the sort which make me wish I wasn't alive, and the type which are painful, icky, hideous, disgusting, and I wish was false with everything in me. I'll grant that [[beauty]] may obtain in any truth to some extent (and, I'm very open to the claim that it necessarily must be except at a special place in [[The Grand Dialectic]] which [[The Good]] sublates).

The other interpretation is also very odd. For Nothingness itself to be something at all, to have any property, is a very hard problem indeed. Does [[Beauty]], that attractive force of [[The Good]] which is not [[The Right]], predicate of Nothingness? Oh, we are so far out of my league. I have no idea what to say about such a thing. It's guesswork to me at this point. 

I don't know what to make of your sentence. It's the kind which I want to see transformed and explored again and again though. It's a deep claim, even if you didn't mean it to be.
