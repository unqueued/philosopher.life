!! What rituals do you have or hold?

I'd argue writing in my wiki is a sort of ritual, but it probably doesn't have the kind of repetitive order down to the details which I expect of a ritual. I'd think I'd be the sort of person who follows rituals. Hrm. Meh, let's broaden the notion.

I often meditate for a bit when I wake up. I like it. It's not gamechanging for me, but I'm grateful to have the chance. I think I get to wander or even recombobulate. Sometimes is serious business, but I'm usually just gathering. 

For many years, the first thing I did upon waking up was get on my [[monster]] for news and messages. Medding and morning glory are common intermediate steps. My day is all wrong if I don't get on my machine early in the morning. Even when I have to get up early for work, I find ways to sneak time onto a machine.

Hugging my family. Doesn't sound like a ritual, but they already know what questions I'm going to ask, and half the time we are answering them before the questions get asked. 

[[Family Time]] is a ritual.
