Hey man. It has been a hectic week. How is your move going. We were able to get the keys last Friday. So we painted the small place Saturday and moved in on Sunday. It all went well. Until last night I found fleas in the rugs! Lol. Brand new rugs at that. I guess that's why I get for buying them from the flea mall. Lol. All the other Tennant have cats. And seen a few strays running around. And their is a shared washer dryer room in the center. So I suspect we walked them in off the lawn or  something. So I did the spray and dust on the rugs. The apartment is ceramic tile so I treated the rugs and will see how well it worked Sunday.  Back in Somerset now. But yall have the long haul move. Are you still on the road?

That's no fun. Hopefully, that will clear up before you head back.

I bet it has been a hectic week. Pretty much the same here. Just got through NY, and we're about an hour away from getting our keys.

Probably won't receive our pods for another week, so we'll be camping in doors for a while.
