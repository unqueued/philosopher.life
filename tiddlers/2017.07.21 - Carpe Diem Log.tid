title: 2017.07.21 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up with the alarm. I was tired.
* Bricks Pushed
* I packed the car after getting ready with the remaining stuff and left for work.
* I worked hard, but I felt sick after lunch.
** Don't eat so much.
* I made the trek back. 
** Two serious traffic jams on the way back and lost an hour for it.
* Hugs and kisses
* Shower of the Gods
* Inform the Men
* Shower of Men
* We celebrated with some Chinese food.
** Glad we went, but won't be going back there.
* Watched the new GoT episode
** As predicted, they can't resolve the story. Glad to see it though.
* Bricks Pushed (I ate a ton today).
* Beer and League.
* Overall, it was an excellent day. Towards the end of the evening, just like last Saturday, I had to play the bad guy to get my children to do their work. I started with reason, and that didn't work. Fools.
