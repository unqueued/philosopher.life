title: Contrived Prompts Ideabag

* If you were dictator of the world, country, state, county, city, neighborhood, family, and any other archetypal governmental contexts (feel free to use lateral thinking in naming these contexts), what would you do? How would you lead? 
* Why don't you follow philosophy like someone standardly interested in it? When you are obsessed with something, you usually enjoy reading every little thing about it. You don't do that with philosophy. Why not?
* Can you speak to the relationship between Moral Excellence, Excelllence of Personhood, Homo Sapien Excellence, etc.? For example, it seems completely possible that the pursuit of morality taken to maximum excellence will drive a person crazy. I legitimately think that people who are sane aren't trying hard enough to be moral.
