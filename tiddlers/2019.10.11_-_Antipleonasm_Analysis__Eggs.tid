!! Respond to the following gem:

No matter how much freedom they're given, most kids are still glorified props, carefully shuttled from one secure location to the next. We're not children, we're eggs.

Insofar as we have contingency remaining in our [[4DID]]'s, we're eggs. Some have more variation in their hatching and rehatching possibilities than others. As we crystallize our identities, our eggishness may not be terribly meaningful. Children appear to have more plasticity available to them. The clay is wetter and the possibilities wider. 

I'm far from convinced most kids are glorified props in the sense of being carefully shuttled from one secure location to the next. There are particular countries and contexts in which this is obviously true. It's simply not most! Are most kids objects and props used as mere means by at least some other humans? Of course. What then is this freedom you are talking about? I suggest there are significant shaping and limits placed on both political and moral autonomies of children. There is also something to be said for enabling incrementally growing domains of risk-taking.

The analogy fits a lot of first-world kids. My own are a solid example. We speak often about how they live in a bubble (or an egg, or an incubator, or what have you). They aren't shuttled so much as sheltered in some respects. But, I don't shield or censor access to information and models of the world simpliciter. I'm radically in favor of access, wrestling, and exploring. Security, in this case, is against those who do not aim to allow their minds to be free. I do not know how to build effective philosophers all the way down. I'm simply not a [[good enough dad|Be A Good Dad]].
