title: 2018.08.30 -- nomasters: Demonstration

```
ok - node module is now on npm https://www.npmjs.com/package/hashmap-client

Nice! =)

The dev who is going to be working with me on the mobile app said she'd work with me on the landing page now too
and we plan to have a runable demo on the landing page that hooks into prototype.hashmap.sh
h0p3
that is a good idea
rjrbt
yeah, I know this thing makes sense in my head, but is still very abstract to almost everyone else
h0p3
I know that feeling quite a bit. =)
rjrbt
its more concrete than I think people assume, but its hard for people to grok that without something that has buttons and instant feedback.

Demonstration is always a valuable shortcut
rjrbt
one thing I know we'll do though, is set the Max TTL to be shorter, like 1 hour or so
I have a feeling that if this gets picked up on Hacker News we might be handling quite a bit traffic for a short period of time

I think you should make it as clean as you can before it hits HN.

100%
that's why I've spent this extra time on a proper JS lib
its actually got 100% test coverage too, I just finished that up today
