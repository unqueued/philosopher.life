!! Audit:

* I can immediately feel the difference between [[Sphygmus]]' script and mine just from order.
* There are several running threads this month. I like that. I hope I continue down that path.
** I can never tell how what kinds of containers and signals to use for threading like this. That's okay though.
* It's emotive and somehow very [[TDL]] oriented in many cases.
* I'm always curious how much the tiny bits in this particular log will be used to interpret what it targets. It's easy to ignore it, and yet, I think it often shouldn't be ignored.
* This is surprisingly emotionally painful to read.
* I can see some decision making in here. I'm forced to crystallize content.
* I did a ton of fucking work this month, but I can see my ups and downs pretty clearly. The cause, unfortunately, appears to just be depression.
* This month had a ton of work in the wiki, so my reviews had lots of members to write content for. I'm glad I take my pulse in this log.
