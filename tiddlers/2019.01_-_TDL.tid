!! Audit:

* Humor. Praise jeebus.
* I like that I asked a question. I should do that more.
* It might be simple, and I might fail, but I'm still glad I do this.
* One day, I will get my life in order and either this log will be unnecessary or it will be profoundly awesome.
** keeping my head above water right now
* `/facepalm`, I'm embarrassed/ashamed
** Fuck it! You did fine, homie. You are not superman. Chill.
* It feels like my projects keep getting pulled and strained across larger chunks of time.
* You know what, [[Computer Musings]] has sucked because our infrastructure has been in absolute chaos since X-mas.
** It's congealing, however slowly!
* My son has been driving me insane, and so have I. =)
* I'm proud of my dirt hill. Keep going.
