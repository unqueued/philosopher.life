title: 2017.08.29 - Pipefitting Log

Drove myself today in our temporary vehicle. Listened to Gladwell's Revisionist History. Got plenty of writing done.

New guys came in. Chris-M introduced me to some of them. He said I was pretty green, but I knew a lot. I take that as a compliment.

I've been assigned to work with Chris-M on finalizing the headers. Chris-M studied the iso's while I did the layout for the supports and drawing lines for where the pipe needs to be layed. I helped the riggers put it into place somewhat, and I had to hammer and move the large supports into place. After the break, we'll move the main header into place. It is off 7 inches in one direction on one end and 1 inch in the other direction on the other end (long fucking, huge piece). 

David's son is here. I was expecting pure white given Dave's libertarian view. Nope. Awesome, not obviously a racist then. Good. In any case, we will see. He has been assigned to work with Chris and me. I assume that's a good sign, that we are viewed highly enough for that. Let's see who he is, what he knows, how hard he works, and whether or not he is bird-dogging on for his pops.

Break!

We moved the pipe into place. Brandon, Dave's son, has obviously been around the block. I enjoyed working with him. We got the supports all aligned (took multiple tries). I did a tiny bit of rigging to help the rigger. I feel like I was the only one who understood what we needed to accomplish, but at the same time, didn't feel it was my place to tell them they were doing it wrong. I need to be a bit more aggressive, straight-forward, and willing to make mistakes. 

We pulled some more measurements, drew some lines. I'll be going up with the riggers to fit the massive pipe. I know the centerlines, so I can do it. The rigger kept moving it until I was satisfied by it.

I asked one of the new guys, Jeff, a fitter of several decades I assume, how long he had been a fitter. He said this is his first job (which was obviously not true). Dick.

Lunch!

We thought we were going to move 2609-02-05 into place. Nope, the riggers had a shipment coming in of our last header. We waited around. I grabbed the drawings and studied. It was the first time I got to really sit down with them it felt. I'm beginning to see how the pieces in the documentation fit together. It's not a simple document. I'm still working my way through it. I hope to become extremely adept at interpreting them and understanding the order of operations and issues I need to take into account.

Brandon showed me his tools. He has some I don't have, but I clearly have a lot more. He is on this job as a complete fitter. He gets paid $4 an hour more. I'm seeing what he understands.  I anticipate I'll be catching up to him within a year.

The shipment finally came in. I took notes and helped figure out with of the 9 pieces were which and in which direction they went. We set them aside though because immediately after the operator was ready for us to work on the pipe we setup before lunch. I suited up in my harness and went with Chris. It wasn't terrifying this time, but it was quite uncomfortable. I was also completely useless to him. I told him as much. He shook his head to make me feel better, but I know he knows it is true. In fact, he decided he would do it himself 15 minutes later. We still had some adjustments to make after an hour of work, but I obviously wasn't useful for it. Also, our fit-up lines for rigging are NOT correct. They do not go where we expected them. The pipe feels too short. I didn't measure the pipe. 

When I am in charge, I will have the pipes measured against the isos and labeled immediately. We need order. This place is chaos.

We worked past break time.

Break!

I did a bit more reading, and I also slightly directed my foreman as he operated the lull moving two very large header pieces together for us. It was during this that I decided that Brandon is actually fairly annoying. I'll learn what I can from him, despite his attitude. 

Post Work!

I realize I'm really beginning to understand these more complex iso's. It's gratifying. I hope I can master them eventually, as it is clearly important to being a good pipefitter.

I need some actual hammers. Today it was clear I was ill-prepared. It took several different hammers to accomplish the job. A retractable flexible measuring tape with a magnet attached would be sick.

I went through my hardware to see if I could fix the tool I have. I can't.

I need to contact AB&T for a gangbox. Of course, I need a vehicle again so that I can measure.
