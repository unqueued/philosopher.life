“Correlationism is like a mixing desk in a music recording studio. It has two faders: the correlator and the correlatee. Strong correlationism turns the correlator fader all the way up and the correlatee fader all the way down. Thus arises from strong correlationism the culturalist idea that culture (or discourse or ideology or…) makes things real.”

<<<
But humans should not abandon their search for “the real” by resigning themselves to an existence fraught with an irreconcilable, ontological relativism.
<<<

<<<
If we were not fundamentally “broken inside,” then how can we possibly expect to find ourselves in other things, concepts, and places?
<<<

<<<
Explosive holism is concerned with how the parts of something extend or subordinate themselves in relation to some presumed and backwards glancing whole.
<<<

<<<
To claim that something exists is to claim that it exists like something else.
<<<

<<<
That no single transcendent heap can subsume all other heaps is what Morton wants to instill in Marxist thought, which becomes more totalitarian with each claim it increasingly purports as inevitable and universal.
<<<

Ah, but...this denies [[The Telos]]. You have no escaped your relativism, be it truth or ontological. 

<<<
Distinctions like “me-versus-nature, human-versus-nonhuman, subject-versus-object and health-versus-pathology” are not just arbitrarily determined in the way orthodox cultural relativism claims; they are a reflection of how those in power reinscribe “likeness” and “familiarity” onto others as a function of the power they hold over them.

I'm not a panpsychist. I am a profound differentiationist though. I do think some points of view are simply more valuable than others, even to the point of being specist in a sense. Rationality, whatever that X-factor, really does seem special. I'm sorry. I don't think the phenomenology of a rock is equal to mine. I can't go into OOO like this.

Fascination still does not preclude this differentiationism.

<<<
Humankindness is “a return to inconsistency” and unpredictability (i.e. to contingency).
<<<

Why is "contingency" necessarily better?

<<<
Morton muses, “At the ground state, the quantized particles of action turn out to be fascinated appreciation, as we will see.” We cultivate fascination by acknowledging the wiggle room between us and the ways we bracket the symbiotic real. The silliness of which is deemed as incompatible for what passes as “politically or ethically effective.” Our actions are neither purely altruistic or selfish. Instead, a framework of mutual aid better allows for both us and them to “rock” back and forth in their own way.

I agree to the need for humility and flexibility in the dialectic. I worry this borders, yet again, on relativism. I take up the contextualist's sensitive charge. I don't understand the basis of normativity here.
