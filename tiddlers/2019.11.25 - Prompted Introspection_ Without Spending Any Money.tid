title: 2019.11.25 - Prompted Introspection: Without Spending Any Money

!! What would you do to entertain your family without spending any money?

Lol, [[2018.03.07 - Prompted Introspection Log: Free Entertainment]] is poorly argued. It appears that nothing is free in physics (but I'm open to some exceptions), and I spoke out of turn for computation. I still get to it, but incorrectly.

I think the point I should have raised was that we couldn't survive as a family without spending money; it's practically a necessary condition to being able to entertain them again and again. 

I appreciate that we entertain ourselves together. Oscillating between our books/computers and speaking with each other in person is amazing. We live in our living room, no doubt. I'm lucky to have a family who enjoys being together.
