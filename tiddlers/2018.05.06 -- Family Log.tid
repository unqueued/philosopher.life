!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** You had to give cleaning the toilet several tries yesterday. Before your last round, you came and asked for my opinion on it. That was wise. It's important that you ask your boss or someone with more experience to take a look at your work for improvement. Further, I want you to know I admire your persistence. I love that you keep trying, and I hope you keep trying on keeping on trying.
** Thank you for staying in contact with me this week while doing your schoolwork.
** Thank you for working on your characters, especially Nines. They were really cool.
* j3d1h
** I'm proud of the fact that you are taking your reading seriously and thinking about it. 1984 is a book that is going to stick with you, and I hope you continue to appreciate dystopian literature. If my idol Aristotle were alive today, despite you being a female, he'd would praise you as a "political animal." Keep going, girl.
** Thank you for teaching me how to cut a mango.
** Thank you for letting me borrow your jacket sweater thing.
** Thank you for trying to help me with my wiki.
* k0sh3k
** Thank you for hiding cookies for us.
** I'm really proud of you for taking over troubleshooting your wiki. I know it's really frustrating, and I'm sorry. I appreciate that you are owning your data and computing. You continue to do that in multiple areas, and it's because you don't love it but you still do that you're a better rolemodel than I am to our children in this. Thank you.
** Thank you for making baklava and cookies.
* h0p3
** Thank you for letting us outside twice on grace.
** Thank you for working so hard this week.
** Thank you for helping me make the brownies.
