title: 2017.04.25 - Realpolitik Speculation: Privatized Quantum Computing

John Deere has recently claimed that only corporations can have intellectual property rights. The absurdity of the selfishness of the people in my world is hard to bear. I see it all around me. This IP trend, in controlling our ability to simply access and use ideas, is getting out of control. It is legalized mass mind control. I think we should call it "IP Power Creep," since that is exactly what has been happening for hundreds of years.

Mobile phone technologies, both hardware and software, have been locked down into an oligopoly through a series of patent wars that bar entry to competition by design. Another wave of patent oligopolies are coming, and this time, they have more legal precedent and experience in solidifying and centralizing their power structures. 

Case in point: Quantum computing. To whatever extent it will change the world, it will reside in the hands of the few. Presumably, it will break large swathes of cryptography and perhaps revolutionize search (which is one of the hardest problems we've ever faced in computing). Many large companies are racing to grab up patents for this.<<ref "1">>

If and when it comes to fruition, only a few companies will have access. It won't simply be proprietary, it will be locked behind physical, digital, economic, and political barriers. This technology will not be available to the masses, except through the oligopolized doorsteps. They will hide these quantum silos, use them to maximize their profits and powers. Forget the good of humankind. These people are psychopathic. 

Do not buy into the Religion of Innovation. It is yet another opiate of the masses. That isn't to say technology is the problem. As always, the problem boils down to the people who use, control, and implement the technology.
