How was your weekend?
SEP 23 12:49 PM
Shit
SEP 23 1:03 PM
I was out of town all weekend. ðŸ˜‚
SEP 23 1:03 PM
=(
SEP 23 1:03 PM
I completely missed your message. I am so sorry. Lol
SEP 23 1:03 PM
Naw, it's cool, and understandable. Sounds like it was busy.
SEP 23 1:03 PM
We went to visit Anessa and just relax and chill. I spent a lot of time just doing homework.
SEP 23 1:03 PM
Still not done. ðŸ˜‚
SEP 23 1:03 PM
But it was enjoyable nevertheless.
SEP 23 1:03 PM
How was your weekend?
SEP 23 1:03 PM
Oh, good. I thought you meant your weekend was Shit, lol.
SEP 23 1:04 PM
Work today is shit though. They swapped my cubicle without asking me first. Iâ€™m really annoyed about it.
SEP 23 1:04 PM
Well, I'm glad you got some homework done and some chill time with Anessa.
SEP 23 1:04 PM
That is annoying.
SEP 23 1:04 PM
They very much respect you as an individual, [[K]].
SEP 23 1:05 PM
Thanks. :)

Yeah they gave it to the new girl- the one who got the position instead of me.
SEP 23 1:05 PM
Hahahahaha
SEP 23 1:05 PM
My weekend was solid.
SEP 23 1:06 PM
Do anything fun?
SEP 23 1:06 PM
Vidja?
SEP 23 1:06 PM
Pumping my veins full of vidya drugs.
SEP 23 1:06 PM
I've not been writing as much as I'd like.
SEP 23 1:07 PM
Neither have my offspring. This one is on me, lol.
SEP 23 1:07 PM
Anyway, [[k0sh3k]] flies up to CT in a few weeks, so I'm excited about that.
SEP 23 1:07 PM
Yeah! Job interviews are super exciting. :) sheâ€™s gonna get it. I can feel it.
SEP 23 1:09 PM
Would be fucking insane if she does.
SEP 23 1:13 PM
Does she know what her competition looks like?
SEP 23 1:14 PM
I feel like she told me but I cant recall.
SEP 23 1:14 PM
No idea. One other person made it. I don't know if they will get to meet each other.
SEP 23 1:16 PM
I'm such an asshole, but I hope this person fails hard and then wins a different lottery.
SEP 23 1:16 PM
If hoping for your wife to succeed makes you an asshole, then make room for me on the ship too. Haha
SEP 23 1:25 PM
The dentist is cruel
SEP 24 10:50 AM
I went in expecting a cleaning and walked out with two fillings. :D
SEP 24 10:50 AM
And now Iâ€™m numb forever.
SEP 24 10:50 AM
It's been a dentist-y week. My wife and offspring went yesterday and today.
SEP 24 12:34 PM
Dentists are one step above chiropractors for me.
SEP 24 12:35 PM
Sorry about the fillings and the numbness.
SEP 24 12:35 PM
No worries. lol
SEP 24 12:42 PM
How are you?
SEP 24 12:43 PM
Oh, you know me: grinding away in my wiki, walking and talking to myself like a madman.
SEP 24 12:44 PM
Nice. I took off work today for the dentist. Iâ€™ve got one more assignment to do, a reading to begin and a presentation to give this afternoon.
SEP 24 12:49 PM
Ah, what presentation?
SEP 24 12:56 PM
Challenging Tradition in Palace Walk :)
SEP 24 12:59 PM
Have a good day!
SEP 25 9:44 AM
You too. =)
SEP 25 11:51 AM
How'd the presentation go?
SEP 25 11:51 AM
14 minutes! I dragged it out really nicely.
SEP 25 11:52 AM
Also I literally just read my paper but she told me she loved it.
SEP 25 11:52 AM
Classic.
SEP 25 11:52 AM
I made the right call not putting a shit ton of effort into it.
SEP 25 11:53 AM
Hahaha
SEP 25 11:53 AM
I often prefer the paper reading anyway.
SEP 25 11:53 AM
Agreed. I just wasnâ€™t convinced that she really cared if it was a full-fledged presentation or not as long as we did a good analysis.
