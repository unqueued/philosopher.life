Life is a series of risks and risk management.

I'm increasingly convinced that I need to take apart what I mean by private languages. Wittgenstein and I have a serious disagreement still.

I am increasingly convinced that religions and memeplexes in general tend to evolve to encourage a special kind of selfishness. The Selfishness Gene and Meme are interlinked profoundly. Not all religions are conceptually selfish! Duh. But the popular ones, the most viral ones, on average, have a high likelihood of it. Psychological egoism is correct in some crucial respects, but I suggest that altruistic molecules can still emerge from selfish atoms. There is a faithful trusting trust starting place, but we can adjust it computationally to achieve it.
