title: 2018.11.28 - CATI: Simulation, Externalism, Representation

The "is" and the "ought" are paradoxically simultaneous, coextant, etc. I tend to favor ontology's primacy to epistemology, but not when it comes to normativity in some respects. I do not see why [[The Good]] must be an agent. The idea of an agent does not make it an agent, even if it is the perfect, infinite form of agentness itself (somehow parasitically, conditionally bound to perfection and [[The Good]] in general). This is, again the context of all contexts, but I may need to deny Saint Spinoza's, Saint Leibniz's, Saint GÃ¶del's, and perhaps even Saint Hegel's notions of unifying necessitation. 

Simulation is necessary for possibility. The "to be otherwise" of [[The Right]] and perhaps even [[The Good]] of [[The Good]] requires not just change, but the possibility of alternative changes. Simulation of The Cave is paradoxically what allows us to recognize the externality of [[The Good]] and [[The Right]].
