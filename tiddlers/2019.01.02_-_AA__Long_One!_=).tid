How did the birthdays go? Did they get fun things?
WED 12:22 PM
They had fun. Having [[JRE]] and Rebecca made it awesome.
WED 12:24 PM
They got fun things.
WED 12:25 PM
Cool â€”didnâ€™t realize [[JRE]] and Rebecca made it down there.  ðŸ¥° Family visits with close relatives is awesome
WED 12:44 PM
How's your day going?
WED 1:17 PM
Open house â€”generally the parents I need to see donâ€™t come
WED 1:17 PM
Lol. Yeah.
WED 1:17 PM
So reading and eating cookies
WED 1:17 PM
=)
WED 1:18 PM
Whatcha reading?
WED 1:18 PM
Have to work tonightâ€”wonder if they will notice if I nap under my desk
WED 1:18 PM
hehe
WED 1:19 PM
Working on party types for pokemon letâ€™s go (itâ€™s been a while since I played gen 1) and fiction (doesnâ€™t take much brain power)
WED 1:19 PM
Highland queen (?) something like that â€”based on MacBethâ€™s wife
WED 1:20 PM
I let [[AG]] have the Mew from the pokeball controller ...sigh miss that little pink cat :cat2:
WED 1:22 PM
Lol
WED 1:23 PM
Mew is special.
WED 1:24 PM
What is a party type?
WED 1:24 PM
Well we have the Eevee version so trying to cover the spectrum
WED 1:24 PM
I find reading can be a draining affair for me unless I'm just engrossed in the topic. Your book sounds like work to me, lol.
WED 1:25 PM
And they have released a bunch of moves for Eevee that are really helpful
WED 1:25 PM
ah
WED 1:25 PM
I have her with a water move that heals, a fairy move that heals things like burn or paralyzed for the party, a lightning move that paralyzes and an ice move that also removes special stats from the attacker
WED 1:27 PM
So they damage and are helpful
WED 1:27 PM
Reading is an escape...
WED 1:28 PM
But makes me sleepy :sleeping:
WED 1:28 PM
Do you follow the storyline in the series?
WED 1:30 PM
I know [[L]] very much likes that aspect of games.
WED 1:30 PM
I hear that escape, lol. =)
WED 1:31 PM
Yes I have
WED 1:31 PM
You might like the Discworld series. It's beautiful escapist fantasy, imho. It's hilarious, cute, and different.
WED 1:32 PM
(or, you have probably read it, for all I know)
WED 1:32 PM
Nice I shall look
WED 1:33 PM
Going back through the books of 2018 with [[k0sh3k]] on our walk yesterday
WED 1:33 PM
that one stuck out
WED 1:33 PM
[[L]] is reading the Witcher series â€”they looked interesting
WED 1:35 PM
Aye. You sent me looking into it. It's neat to see that world become popular and explode.
WED 1:37 PM
What are your favorite books? Are there any that you re-read?
WED 1:37 PM
I like Diane Setterfieldâ€™s Thirteenth tale. I like Historical fiction from Henry 8th-Elizabeth 1 and Avalon/Arthurian stuff like Mists of Avalon
WED 2:02 PM
Strong female leads it seems ...but then I named my first born REDACTED so ...there you go
WED 2:03 PM
! =)
WED 2:04 PM
googling your list here
WED 2:04 PM
You and [[k0sh3k]] probably have significant overlap.
WED 2:05 PM
She has excellent taste :grin:
WED 2:06 PM
I just finished Lina Potterâ€™s Medieval Tale series â€”The were pretty good.
WED 2:07 PM
Aye, lol. She saves me so much time by picking out books.
WED 2:07 PM
Googling
WED 2:07 PM
Are you a George R.R. Martin fan?
WED 2:08 PM
I can't keep track of that many characters.
WED 2:09 PM
I have not read any of his but googling it shows me that I should
WED 2:09 PM
Sometimes if you keep reading, they sort themselves out
WED 2:10 PM
Those puzzles are too big for me unless I'm taking notes. They don't come alive for me the same way is my guess.
WED 2:10 PM
I have read and enjoyed so many mysteries that I can often predict the ending â€”I love books that surprise me
WED 2:11 PM
I hope you take this as the ridiculously high compliment that it is: you and my wife are very similar people in crucial respects, especially your narrative skills and empathic attention to the details of  human life.
WED 2:13 PM
I can totally see you predicting books like that, lol. My wife does that too.
WED 2:13 PM
So hard to find a book that surprises her.
WED 2:13 PM
Btw, first GoT book is in our sync.
WED 2:13 PM
Your wife is a very special lady! Thank you it is a very high compliment. Oooo thanks!
WED 2:14 PM
I cannot predict books. Hell, I can't predict books I've read before, lol.
WED 2:14 PM
I get to be the first stop on the ms/hs IT ladder â€”if something doesnâ€™t work, I get called
WED 2:15 PM
So I get to deal with the... is it on? Does it have paper? Are you connected to the right ip add?
WED 2:15 PM
Sigh at least itâ€™s something to do... only one parent in 2.25 hrs and her son is great
WED 2:16 PM
Troubleshooting is an underpaid job. They couldn't live without ya, lol.
WED 2:17 PM
Need more caffeine to deal
WED 2:17 PM
Hehe :cup_with_straw:
WED 2:17 PM
When does school start back for you?
WED 2:20 PM
Tomorrow
WED 2:20 PM
Forgot to get my physical, so getting that done and turning in the paperwork. Then I have work.
WED 2:20 PM
It is annoying to me that I have to pay for literally everything at this job.
WED 2:21 PM
I've never had to pay for my own background check before, lol.
WED 2:21 PM
Oh wow :astonished: usually they at least do that :confused:
WED 2:21 PM
We start tomorrow too â€”I am ready to be back
WED 2:22 PM
You think you become increasingly a creature of habit as you age?
WED 2:26 PM
I'm trying to think about whether or not I am.
WED 2:26 PM
(life feels like such a whirlwind that I'm perhaps a poor judge on this front)
WED 2:26 PM
Yes...or maybe itâ€™s just that spontaneous/unstructured interruptions are disturbing
WED 2:27 PM
I have learned to deal but itâ€™s not fun
WED 2:28 PM
Minimizing surprise is energy efficient for a brain.
WED 2:28 PM
That makes sense
WED 2:28 PM
I'm still thinking about your pit analogy. I may start collecting those analogies.
WED 2:28 PM
Hey Saturday will be 17 yrs with [[UJ]]!
WED 2:29 PM
Wow!
WED 2:29 PM
Congratulations. It doesn't feel like 17 years to me (although, it kinda does too).
WED 2:29 PM
Not that that is s a pit hehe but as my break progressed, I could feel myself sliding in
WED 2:30 PM
That is approaching half your lifetimes.
WED 2:30 PM
You arenâ€™t that far behind
WED 2:30 PM
Will be 14 for us in a few weeks.
WED 2:30 PM
That is true :blush: He saved [[L]] and I in many ways...
WED 2:30 PM
Yes. I respect him; it is not often that I have the opportunity to say that about most anyone. I'm grateful you two found each other.
WED 2:31 PM
Needed balance â€”poor [[L]] had to deal with my intensity. I am grateful too
WED 2:32 PM
Yeah, he does have a different style, no doubt.
WED 2:32 PM
Itâ€™s good for me â€”he often gives good perspective and advice about situations that I have allowed to grow out of proportion in my head
WED 2:33 PM
And he loves me even in my pit...and helps push/pull me out
WED 2:34 PM
Sounds like you've already got your card written!
WED 2:37 PM
I'd have gone insane (still might anyways) without [[k0sh3k]]. I do not know how single people do it.
WED 2:37 PM
Actually, I don't know how most married people do it either.
WED 2:38 PM
Preach!
WED 2:38 PM
=)
