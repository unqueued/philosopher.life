title: 2018.09.14 - Deep Reading: Fear: Trump in the White House

Alright, so Trump has been outspoken (for often poor reasons) against wars we're engaged in. Nobody can justify it to him. What are we missing here? 

It's obvious that they "can't win" and are passing the hot potato of liability...I think I'm missing something awful.

I do not understand the firing of Bannon. I know I'm supposed to, but I don't.

Trumpisms are killing me.

It is becoming increasingly obvious that the whirlwind will never be reduced into a manageable point of view. There's simply too many moving parts for any person to provide a clean history of this. The semblance will always be weak.

"I like these big round numbers" - You know, this is the kind of bullshit I would parody with Bush. I need to stop participating in this. It's time to admit the sheer competence of evil humans. They have a competitive advantage in being immoral, and they are clearly wielding it.

Trump's xenophobia doesn't seem to enable any kind of allies unless they directly benefit him, stroke his ego, etc. This is always the initial hypothesis. Am I searching in vain here?

He asks the "what do we get from..." or "what do get out of..." questions with simplicity.

I hate that I'm not allowed to give up. I just want to give up.

Shithole is such an egregious word. You know, I don't completely disagree though. This is my problem. Sometimes Trump say something true. His intentions are fucking disgusting. But, yeah...we raped the world. They suffer in "shitholes" because WE did that to them, because we exploit them (look, I'm not saying we are the only people at fault either). It's such a weird feeling to agree with Trump on anything. 

What do they mean by "globalist?" Seems like they could mean a couple things.

It's interesting how they don't seem nearly scared enough of Mueller. 

"You're a fucking liar" lol. This felt like I was reading a play.

I feel icked out.
