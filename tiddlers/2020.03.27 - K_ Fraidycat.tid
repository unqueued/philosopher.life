12:44 PM] h0p3: How's the day going?
[12:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Not too bad. Although I just took [[L]] to the store and she had a mini panic attack.
[12:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: She hasn’t gone out since all this started. Poor thing.
[12:48 PM] h0p3: :frowning:
[12:48 PM] h0p3: I'm sorry.
[12:49 PM] h0p3: It's hard to get out of the house. It feels so different.
[12:50 PM] h0p3: I know it causes me to have to face the world in a way that I don't fully from my own computer.
[12:50 PM] h0p3: I hope she's doing okay now.
[12:58 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Not sure tbh. Just gonna go straight home and make her play animal crossing lol.
[12:59 PM] Ardent_Assailant: How are you doing?
[2:29 PM] h0p3: Lol. I'm glad she had something to soothe her. Self-comfort is sometimes self-care.
[2:30 PM] h0p3: I bet she's having a blast with it too.
[2:30 PM] h0p3: You playing Animal Crossing too?
[2:30 PM] h0p3: I've not seen you play that genre of games, I believe.
[2:30 PM] h0p3: I'm doing fine. I got to finally meet [[kicks]] realtime. It's the highlight of my day, no doubt.
[2:30 PM] h0p3: I need to get on with school work with my offspring.
[2:31 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yah! When I can haha. [[L]] has put an absurd amount of hours into it so far. It has drop in drop out couch coop which helps a little bit.
[2:31 PM] h0p3: Ah
[2:31 PM] h0p3: That is well-designed.
[2:31 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yo that’s cool! How did you all meet up?
[2:31 PM] h0p3: Over a twitch stream.
[2:32 PM] h0p3: It's weird to write maybe 100-200 pages of text with someone without having had a more realtime connection before.
[2:44 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Did you all play something together or did you watch him do so?
[2:47 PM] h0p3: We surfed, he read an excerpt from a book, and we considered this excellent tool of his: https://fraidyc.at/.
