I did a lot of connecting today. There's still a flurry of new organization.

WOOT WOOOOOOOT!!! {[[About]]} to {[[Help]]} transplant is completed, with new stitches. It's not perfect, but "It's ALIVE!"

It's clear to me that I want to migrate the argument from {[[Principles]]} elsewhere. I thought I recently had an idea for where to put it. Ugh, but I can't find it. 

BELAY THAT SOB STORY!!!

[[Program Yourself]] Axiom....DUHHH!

Gonna have to keep the {[[Principles]]} name and setup transclusions. This will be a massive undertaking, imho.
