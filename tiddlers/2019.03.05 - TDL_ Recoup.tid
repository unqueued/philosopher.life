* Sleep in a bit if you can.
* Not sure what we are doing for food here. We've become so adept at measuring that it's rare to have leftovers. I feel like a German.
* m16 awaits, lol. What the hell are you waiting for?
** Busy AF.
** Kids will probably spend a good deal of tomorrow with me on it.
** Behind the screen? It's 75lbs homie. You have to secure that to the fucking wall. 
** I have to know the transplant will work. I'm not burning time on [[m10]].
** [[1uxb0x]] recommended just building the table with the server in it. His idea is ideal. I'd want to build the thing from scratch. I don't have the parts or the tools, =/. Would be a sick project to do with him.
* I have so many letters to write. Go for it!
