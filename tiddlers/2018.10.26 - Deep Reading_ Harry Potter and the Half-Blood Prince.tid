God, I feel like Luna. Lol.

I don't think I care for the celebrity thing going on. I think the series is quite inconsistent on the matter too.

Unbreakable vow is forced. This is way too choreographed. I didn't like it the first time I read it, and I still don't this Nth time either.

Rowling does a good job of showing the coming of age of her characters though. You can see them change through the books.

Trust is a hard problem.

Scrim's bullshit does feel real to me. God damnit.
