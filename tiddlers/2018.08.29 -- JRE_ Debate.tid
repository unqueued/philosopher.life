title: 2018.08.29 -- JRE: Debate

My brother has been correcting people at work. His arguments are good ones. He feels like someone needs to be pushing back and not silently assenting to a consensus that enables racism or pro-Capitalist beliefs, etc. He's a voice of reason, and he does so calmy and kindly. He is struggling with the fact that he spends his social capital not to his benefit but as a sacrifice.

We talked moral and political philosophy. My brother is a smart dude. Some of the conversations I have with him I can't have with even trained philosophers. 

He said he'd read the letter to [[kickscondor]].

He sounded lucid and not broken today!
