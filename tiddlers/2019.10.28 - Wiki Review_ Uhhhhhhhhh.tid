title: 2019.10.28 - Wiki Review: Uhhhhhhhhh

* [[2019.10.27 - Family Log: Take Responsible]]
** My Tina impression will never be good enough.
* [[2019.10.27 - Tjandamurra: G'day!]]
** I still haven't found how they share the keys yet, but I've not gone hunting (the days feel packed, but look in your [[CTS]] logs: you have time if necessary).
* [[Tjandamurra]]
** Fascinating human. 
* [[2019.10.27 - TDL: 50k_2_me + 100k_2_myworstenemy = 150k_2_myself]]
** Edited. I don't know enough to say it doesn't scale; different purpose. Something beautiful about it.
* [[2019.10.27 - Wiki Review: Cook The Onion]]
** Okay, I'm trying. I will try to continue getting to bed earlier.
*** Axshoolee, maybe you need to get back into working out some. Remember the last time you moved? Your muscles were bruised. You were literally black and blue.

** She doesn't think so at all. She thinks it's the incentives for accomplishing. That is a strong argument. I have failed in my attempts there.

** Edited. Jokes are very rare in here. That should change, right? Plenty of rhetoric to slice and dice if necessary. Priests and philosophers among them.
** Loosey-goosey free association wandering is a different approach. There's something to that here too. Letting it hang or almost lazily drape? 
*** Bliss.
**** I think you behave and have a better lense with it (ofc, that's what they would all say!). This I can say: better than drinking.
