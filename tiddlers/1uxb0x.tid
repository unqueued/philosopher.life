<<<
What was silent in the father speaks in the son, and often I found in the son the unveiled secret of the father.

-- Friedrich Nietzsche, //The Gay Science//
<<<

My son is my enigma. I continually fail to model him. He surprises me all the time. Sometimes my autism makes it so that I know exactly where he's coming from in a uniquely difficult way to appreciate, but sometimes I'm completely at a loss. I do not know how to be a good rolemodel for my son because I do not sufficiently understand him. I race with everything to find him in the desert!

''I am coming, son!! Keep doing your best!!!'' My wiki will reach you. I will build a literary structure unlike any in history to reach you.

We must rapidly build common ground and build towards his happiness. It is crucial to me that I prevent an uncrossable gulf from forming between us. I think our wikis will be the most important communications tools between us. I'm going to build a wiki that my son can use to model me and teach him how to model himself and others. 

1uxb0x is exceptionally altruistic, kind, and profoundly concerned with [[The Golden Rule]]. My son is perhaps the most moral human being I've ever met, except to himself. My son does not respect himself in a consistent manner, does not recognize his own dignity in a fitting way, and dehumanizes himself when he is saddest. Like every terrible father: I pass my demons on. I must teach him to love himself as best I can. My son deserves my respect, and I must teach him to seek his own approval as wisely as possible. Empathy is a complex problem for autists, and I will use everything in my power to help him accurately model and identify with his [[4DID]].

My son didn't speak until he was 4, and it has been a torturous uphill battle to help him become functional. I am afraid for him; I'm afraid of what his life will be like. I desperately want him to have the tools to be self-sufficient, to avoid persecution, and to be happy on his own terms. He fills me with hope when I watch him make quantum leaps I did not realize he was capable of. He is clearly intelligent, even if unpredictably and perplexingly so. I should not underestimate my son, but I also should not apply too much pressure. It is a difficult balance to strike. It is not my goal to duplicate myself in my son, but I hope to give him what tools I have (and beyond) that suit him. Every day is an uncharted territory with him, and we will seize that opportunity. Life gets better for my son; I have seen it.

!! Principles:

* [[Be A Good Dad]]
* Find practical activities my son benefits from. Build his confidence. 
* I must give him hope, protect him, listen to him, and cultivate him. 
* I must help my son respect himself, to avoid being overly self-critical, to forgive himself, to never give up, to make the best of what he has available to him, and to program himself wisely.
