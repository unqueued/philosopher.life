*[[The Lightning Thief: 4, Draft 1]]
** We aren't writing this one yet. You have it all set up for it though. Good thinking. =)
*[[The Lightning Thief: 4, Notes]]
** That annoys me too. I don't see why he should make that noise.
** Your notes are kinda sparse, homie. 
*[[TDL: Yesterday]]
** Hey, you should build your link. You've seen the way I have it set on mine. Try something like it.
*[[ERSD]]
** Ditto.
*[[EUSJ]]
** Ditto.
*[[RSSIT/RM]]
** Ditto.
*[[ESH]]
** I think you should tag these. Round them up into a place to analyze.

** Don't listen to this guy. He's a loser. =)
*[[2020.03.09 – Carpe Diem: In H in B]]
** Yikes. Empty. I've been there, homie.
*[[2020.03.09 – Wiki Review: hopefully]]
** What are you thinking about the [[.tmpl]]s?
*[[2020.03.09 – Prompted Introspection: Chores]]
** Life is sometimes a chore, or at least a significant portion of it. I'd like to think you have minimal, fun, or even obviously useful chores in your life.
*** Which isn't to say that how we choose to exercise our freedom isn't going to be a chore to some [[dok]]. I think it's easier to be [[good]] in your shoes than many others.
** Your grammar needs some work here. 
*[[2020.03.09 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Failing]]
** You might want to consider smoothing this out.
** You obviously know what I think. =)
** Doubling your failure rate can sometimes be the best way to improve the odds of succeeding (eventually) at a task.
** This is one thing I adore about your character, sir: you don't give up. You know you are going to bang your head against the wall trying to figure something out sometimes, and some setbacks don't scare you. You know it isn't [[hope]]less. You are resilient and perseverant instead. It is one of your greatest strengths, son.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** DO! =)
** I'm so grateful to see your hard work pay off. We aren't always so lucky in life.
