title: 2019.08.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Le Chin

* Woke at 10
* Meditation 
* As I always do, hugged my chillun. Everyone got some sleep.
* Fitness Routine
** OHEMGEE, I did it. I've lost a few reps of pushups. I could have hit 40, but I don't go to absolute exhaustion. My one whole chinup is feeling much cleaner, and I go slow down for that negative.
** The stretching is still my favorite.
* Coffee. I'm beginning to become an addict. Cold, black, cheap 8oz espresso.
** I don't want the headaches and withdrawals on this shit. I've seen what it does to people. That was the worst Lent I ever experienced growing up; even the pure fasting was easier.
* Dialectures spawned by both my spawn. Lots of conceptual analysis today.
* Read+Write
* My son made me proud today. I told him he should let me do the wireless (wrote it on the blackboard last night alongside the other mapping) since he's put in his time. He told me he didn't feel like he gave it his best, and he wants to wait to hand it to me. Cool. You got it, man. I adore that you take your responsibility seriously.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 4?
