Dear Sho,

Yo ~~bro~~ sister, hello, it's so great to hear from you, fo' sho'.<<ref "p">> Your name is fun to rhyme with, and I'm bad at it. Sorry, lol.

<<<
Hey, dude, how are you?
<<<

I'm doing well enough. I'm grinding. The wiki is reasonable evidence of it. It's been an ordeal getting my offspring back into the groove of school after spending 2 weeks away at my brother's place in KY.

My brother, [[JRE]], showed me [[Project Ascension]]; it's blowing my mind. I think I've died and gone to heaven. But, wait, there's moar! The parts for [[m16]] arrived. The offspring and I built it together today. It's pretty shiny.

I hope you are doing well too! 

<<<
Sorry took me so long to get back to you.
<<<

Please take as long as you need. Some people take a while to reply, and that is a [[good]] thing. I take forever myself, and so I wouldn't have any room to talk either. That I know you are going to respond is half the paranoic battle for me (I'm mostly an idiot). In case it ever matters, you can always use Signal or anything from [[Contact]] to reach me instantly.

<<<
Have had heaps on my mind. Work, health, Ed's work and health, the house, and losing some more friends! Another one bites the dust! Fucking theme song of my life. :P

Ach, weel. Fuck 'em!
<<<

Shit, I'm sorry. =( And, please, don't worry about taking time to get back to me, especially when you have heaps on your mind. I'm going to listen when you talk (though, please tell me to listen quietly if that is what you need [and, I will do so]; I am not the correct listener everyone needs in every situation, but I'm trying to learn). 

I am sorry to hear that you have lost friends on top of the whirlwind. Losing friends is hard. I don't know the circumstances. One of the things I've had to contend with over the past couple years is "who is actually my friend?". I've been wrong a bunch of times. That's actually one of the purposes of my wiki; it [[help]]s me think about who is actually my friend with evidence. It feels like a civil world war in the air these days, and it's eating me alive. 

You win some, you lose some. Yeah, sometimes you should say "fuck 'em," that part of the forgiving retaliation of [[T42T]], imho. I [[hope]] you find 2 more friends for each one you lose. I can't say the social climate is great for it, but I'm hopeful (a rare treat-state for me). 

<<<
How is k0sh3k, also? She's not been on whatsapp so much... I hope she is busy with good things, and not busy with shitty, hard things.
<<<

She's been busy as all get out. She's had a lot of migraines this month, and that worries me. I don't know what to do about it, but it freaks me out that she's in so much pain. I talk with her and hold her, but I'm not very good at just being there (instead of searching for answers) while she's in pain (classic, ofc, and I'm still working on it 15 years later). She's been busy with good things otherwise. She keeps her wiki here: http://k0sh3k.philosopher.life/. She's got an interview with muthafuckin' YALE this month, lol. From what I can see, she's killin' it.

<<<
How's the laundry situation? ðŸ˜‚ 
<<<

Thank you for asking. I think you are the only person who has asked us about this thing which is so practically important to our lives. I finally found a dryer for $100 from a man who repairs them on the side. We had [[a good conversation|Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind]] about Marxism without using the word. We just got it recently though, and we had been using this stainless steel dryer rack in/outdoors. I'm glad we have it, especially since our apartment eats dryers for brefest (not so yum for us). 

<<<
No, honestly, I can relate. We cannae hang a washing line because it cannae look like we're living here, yet.
<<<

That makes me so fucking angry. I know you have the moral right to do it, and I know you are still doing the right thing laying low. It chokes me up to think about what you face. I'm sorry. I'd say "hang in there," but that's not the right phrase here.

<<<
So we get to wash and dry our clothes about once a month at our neighbour's. At this point, being in the caravan an aw, I reckon we and all of our belongings smell enough that it doesn't matter much, anyway.
<<<

My clothes might get washed about once a month as well. I am a smelly sumbitch for real. Even after I take a shower. I hope you are treated with respect. You are a woman of dignity and honor.

<<<
So, no doubt you'll have seen the good news from yesterday, about our new (totally democratically-elected ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜«) prime minister. See attached.

How awful. Not in the slightest bit surprising, but somehow still just as depressing.
<<<

Lol! That image hurts. I'm losing my goddamned mind over here. I even punched holes through a door (though we fixed it up decently). I am grieved. I don't know how you are holding it together either. You clearly are made of some resilient stuff.<<ref "n">>

<<<
Let me know how you are getting on!
<<<

I do through my wiki. It's as honest and open as I know how to write it. It's also really fucking weird (sorry).

<<<
Hugs, 

Sho

`/hug`

You are my homie, and I [[love]] you,

[[h0p3]]
