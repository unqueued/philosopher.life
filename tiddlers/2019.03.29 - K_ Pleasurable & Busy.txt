Have a great day!
FRI 9:04 AM
You  too =)
FRI 9:06 AM
What's your plan for today and the weekend?
FRI 9:06 AM
Gonna play Episode Ardyn before [[L]] gets home, then I’m gonna finish Fight Club and start my paper. Might have dinner with friends tonight. Tomorrow I’m running a session all day. :)
FRI 10:39 AM
What about you?
FRI 10:39 AM
Long conversation with the kiddos. It turns out to be the most important part of homeschooling. We talk a ton.
FRI 11:47 AM
That's why I'm late responding.
FRI 11:47 AM
Had to google Episode Ardyn
FRI 11:47 AM
I don't know what I'd do without Kotaku and The Youtubes; they allow outsiders to have glimpses into your worlds.
FRI 11:48 AM
Sounds like you have a pleasurable weekend. Awesome.
FRI 11:49 AM
I'm reading and writing. Hopefully recover to 100% too.
FRI 11:49 AM
That's good. :) And no worries!

It's the final DLC story of FFXV. I'm sad to say goodbye to it.

Pleasurable and busy.

Are you feeling any better at all?
FRI 1:09 PM
Yeah, I'm at 90%
FRI 1:09 PM
:)
FRI 1:09 PM
that's a lot better!
FRI 1:09 PM
No doubt.
FRI 1:09 PM
Done with Fight Club! I think I understand your points from the other day better.
FRI 3:04 PM
The reason why this movie is good to watch in conjunction with Postmodernism is because they take every chance they can get to make fun of the fourth wall.
FRI 3:04 PM
And I realized that I was also forgetting about a really key trait of post modernism that really brings the whole movie home. Capitalism/ Consumerism.
FRI 3:26 PM
Yay. That movie is outstanding. It takes on a different life for me each time I watch it too.
FRI 3:44 PM
I really enjoyed it.
FRI 3:52 PM
So restructuring my main points, I wanna talk about Ed's relationships, particularly with Tyler with maybe a brief mention of Marla, the anti-capitalist themes, and the fun poking of metanarratives within the fourth wall.
FRI 3:54 PM
I do not know the exact prompt you have been given for this assignment. The best paragraph in your paper should be devoted to outlining the definition postmodernism and then hooking up those main points to it. You have so little space to do the work you want to (and should) do.
FRI 3:59 PM
I think you'll have to crystallize quite a bit.
FRI 3:59 PM
I'm working on it right now... I think I should brainstorm like crazy this weekend, then begin writing Monday.
FRI 4:00 PM
There's just so much to discuss in so little room.,
FRI 4:00 PM
Your main points will make it a rock solid paper.
FRI 4:00 PM
Thanks!
FRI 4:00 PM
I tried checking out your notes again, but it won't load for me for some reason.
FRI 4:00 PM
When in doubt, write the first draft longer, and then spend your time culling and crystallizing down.
FRI 4:00 PM
That's a good idea. ^_^
FRI 4:01 PM
My daughter is working on the infrastructure. Lemme pull up a copy for you.
FRI 4:01 PM
You're the best.:D

I need these page guidelines doubled.
FRI 4:20 PM
:D
FRI 4:20 PM
You have an ability I do not. Lol. I cannot outline like that. I often don't know what I'm supposed to write until after I've written it. That looks excellent.
FRI 4:21 PM
Back in grade school, I hated outlining, but without it, there's no way I could get anything coherent out. Haha
FRI 4:22 PM
I think devoting at least a paragraph to a definition of postmodernism will be a useful board to peg everything against.
FRI 4:22 PM
Definitely! It'll be crucial to fully explain it in context of its tendrils around Fight Club
FRI 4:23 PM
I really need more than 5 pages....
FRI 4:23 PM
I know, lol.
FRI 4:23 PM
Please excuse me. I'm a broken record.
FRI 4:23 PM
Sidenote
FRI 4:23 PM
While I was locating your Fight Club page, I realized that you archived all of our signal conversations in your Wiki.
FRI 4:24 PM
We've talked a shit ton this year.
FRI 4:24 PM
Heck yeah. I aim to model our relationship clearly for us. I want to be objective and thoughtful about it.
FRI 4:25 PM
In the months following the reset, I noticed dates here and there to the end of 2018, and once 2019 came around BAM.
FRI 4:25 PM
It's a long ass list hahaha
FRI 4:25 PM
It has been wonderful
FRI 4:25 PM
Likewise. :D I lament the days where I'm too busy to talk more.
FRI 4:26 PM
Today has been good though.
FRI 4:26 PM
You have been the second person this week to have recognized I'm thinking about and modeling my relationships. T-Money has struggled with that fact far more.
FRI 4:26 PM
My honesty can be a painful experience, though I aim to be kind.
FRI 4:27 PM
Nah it doesn't bother me.
FRI 4:27 PM
I see it as transparency!
FRI 4:27 PM
=) I adore that you appreciate it. I think most people find it insane.
FRI 4:27 PM
Maybe it is, but I don't care, lol.
FRI 4:30 PM
I think it shows devotion.
FRI 4:30 PM
Insane Devotion. I am a zealot.
FRI 4:31 PM
When is your paper due?
FRI 4:32 PM
Next Friday. So I’d like to have the whole rough draft done by Monday night, edits by Wednesday night, and feedback by Thursday before I turn it in. XD
FRI 4:35 PM
I have to set these goals or I’ll never get it done.
FRI 4:35 PM
I meant to finish the movie much sooner. Ever the busy bee.
FRI 4:35 PM
If I could go back in time, I would be as disciplined as you are.
FRI 4:35 PM
Your cultivate your attention. I'm still learning how to focus.
FRI 4:36 PM
I just need one extra day every week and I would be completely set. Hahaha
FRI 4:38 PM
If I were more disciplined I would have finished the movie last week :joy:
FRI 4:38 PM
preach
FRI 4:38 PM
to the extra day*
FRI 4:38 PM
Have you selected your classes for next semester beyond middle eastern lit?
FRI 4:39 PM
Yes! I am taking intro to old English. We’re gonna learn how to read it properly. 

Advanced fiction creative writing. So fucking excited!!

And post colonial voices which is another literature class.
FRI 4:43 PM
Fantastic. Are those the last classes you need?
FRI 5:59 PM
Yes! Then I will be a bachelor! >:D
FRI 6:53 PM
Excellent  =)
