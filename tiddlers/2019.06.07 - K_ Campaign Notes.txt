FRI 11:16 AM
I have an interview today doing office work at a lab. I hope I get it.
FRI 11:16 AM
I desperately want to finish my letter to [[kickscondor]]. I've taken forever, but it's a long one that took some wrestling.
FRI 11:16 AM
I've got a lot of books to read.
FRI 11:17 AM
Doing paperwork for the hospital trying to clear that up.
FRI 11:17 AM
Dude that’s awesome! Good luck!
FRI 11:17 AM
How about you? You got a D&D session going?
FRI 11:17 AM
Yep! Running tomorrow. And the Saturday after. And the Saturday after.
FRI 11:17 AM
:joy::joy::joy:
FRI 11:18 AM
Nice to have the pulse.
FRI 11:18 AM
You should send me to gave. I'd like to read it!
FRI 11:18 AM
game*
FRI 11:18 AM
How's life going, btw? I feel like we haven't talked about much this week.
FRI 11:19 AM
Like my campaign notes?
FRI 11:19 AM
It’s going. Vacation was nice.
FRI 11:19 AM
There’s so much I wanna get done this summer. X)
FRI 11:19 AM
Got a lot of stories I want to consume and writing to get done.
FRI 11:20 AM
And people to see
FRI 11:20 AM
You guys included. ;)
FRI 11:21 AM
Looking at.... second or third week of July? Would either of those work?
FRI 11:21 AM
The kids will be with [[JRE]] from July 6-20.
FRI 11:22 AM
We would love to have you any time. It will either be 2 or 4 of us.
FRI 11:22 AM
What's your story list to consume?
FRI 11:22 AM
Gotcha! I’ll let [[L]] know. 

Working through my jrpg backlog, Chrono Trigger, Persona 5, Nier Automata, and a new playthrough of Final Fantasy VII. Got a lot of fantasy and horror books I want to read too. If I could just get into a few of them that would be great. 

[[L]] and I are also watching Buffy together and I wanna catch up on Stranger Things, Haunting of Hill House, and several anime series too.
FRI 11:25 AM
And we have a new expansion coming at the end of this month too
FRI 11:25 AM
Yes, I want to see your campaign notes!
FRI 11:27 AM
Googling some of those.
FRI 11:27 AM
I’ll toss ya a google drive share when I go on lunch!
FRI 11:27 AM
My notes are hardly riveting reading. It’s more the mad musings of someone trying to predict what 6 sociopaths are going to do. :D
FRI 11:28 AM
Rofl
FRI 11:28 AM
But there are fun little tidbits nevertheless.
FRI 11:28 AM
I’m also binging Critical Role at work, which is a Dungeons and Dragons Podcast ran by professional voice actors.
FRI 11:31 AM
Reminds me of listening to vidya game pros.
FRI 11:32 AM
You pickup any ideas from it?
FRI 11:32 AM
I initially avoided it because the community holds their game in the highest regard and I didn’t want my games to try to emulate that, but I’m watching it more to learn how to master pacing, which is something I feel I’m bad at.
FRI 11:32 AM
Definitely!
FRI 11:32 AM
I’m really invested in the story now.
FRI 11:33 AM
Matt is a good DM too. He has a lot of love for the game and his friends.
FRI 11:34 AM
I do not understand why you would not emulate greatness. Is it too cookiecutter, not authentic enough?
FRI 11:34 AM
I want to draw inspiration from it for sure, but I don’t want to be an imitation.
FRI 11:36 AM
I must be a weirdo on that one. Lol.
FRI 11:36 AM
Another big thing I’m learning is how to make better flavor text
FRI 11:37 AM
Because I’m really bad at doing so on the fly.
FRI 11:37 AM
I’m also bad at Doing it in my personal writing. Haha
FRI 11:37 AM
One of my DM friends is a really big fan of the show and he all but begged me to give it a fair chance. Here I am 45 episodes later...
FRI 11:43 AM
Lol. Smashing through it.
FRI 11:44 AM
There's gotta be loves of things to learn about being a live raconteur.
FRI 11:45 AM
I assume improv concepts and practice might be useful too.
FRI 11:45 AM
I’d love to actually take improv classes.
FRI 11:45 AM
They seem great!
FRI 11:45 AM
REDACTED
FRI 12:27 PM
We are currently in chapter 2.
FRI 12:27 PM
Session #6
FRI 12:27 PM
Bookwyrm is one of my wife's handles.
FRI 12:31 PM
These are well-structured.
FRI 12:31 PM
That actually came from the book haha
FRI 12:31 PM
The name, not the structure
FRI 12:32 PM
Thanks!
FRI 12:32 PM
I try to keep it super organized
FRI 12:32 PM
I can see how they could be part of the wireframing for a much larger book or world.
FRI 12:32 PM
Eventually I envision Notable Locations becoming too big for my docs and needing it's own dedicated compendium.
FRI 12:32 PM
But yeah, this is how I structure all of my campaigns
FRI 12:33 PM
Yup. Making your data reusable and transformable will be valuable.
FRI 12:33 PM
My outlines for my writing are similar too
FRI 12:33 PM
totes :D
