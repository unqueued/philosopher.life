I asked my players to pick out their own character themes and battle themes and this is one for our Paladin.
MON 10:43 AM
Inspiring
MON 10:43 AM
Solid Paladin pick
MON 10:43 AM
Definitely.  I’m trying to use their song picks to rally them up when key moments are happening.
MON 10:47 AM
It’s working well so far.
MON 10:47 AM
Also. Fight Club tonight!!
MON 10:47 AM
A signal to them the pay attention: the boss encounter is here.
MON 10:48 AM
Get in the zone.
MON 10:48 AM
Exactly. It’s very JRPG, but considering I’m the DM I can’t say I’m surprised that we have ended up doing this. :joy:
MON 10:49 AM
Still thinking about Fight Club too.
MON 11:00 AM
Let me know when you finish it. We can geek out.
