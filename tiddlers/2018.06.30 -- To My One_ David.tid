title: 2018.06.30 -- To My One: David

I feel fairly betrayed sitting here, but I knew I would. This one is not up to me.

It is a betrayal of me, however, that you have earned the right to engage in many times over. That is the rule of law given our covenant. The best argument, of course, is that you believe it is the best option for the children (you have not provided a full-fledged argument).

I actually want to know what you would think of me taking the kids to see David. Seriously. Take 10 minutes and respond to me. No, it isn't identical, but there is something sufficiently similar enough to warrant investigation. That is how little merit I see in this move, how painful it is, etc. Are you sure you've given it the correct amount of thought? 

You already know what my answer is to David; I have offered my service many times over. I'm not asking for the same, but perhaps my feelings still make some sense here.

I'm glad I gave it to you to decide. It is important to me that I am not held responsible for it any more than is necessary. I hope you made the right choice, even though I do not see it as such. I love you.
