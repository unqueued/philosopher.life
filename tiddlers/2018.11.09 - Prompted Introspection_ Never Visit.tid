title: 2018.11.09 - Prompted Introspection: Never Visit

!! What?s one place that you would like to visit but never will? Why will you never go there?

I've answered similar questions before:

There is an obvious trend in my preference here: I'd love to actually visit space. I want to experience the enormity and smallness of our planet, see it from another perspective. I want to zero-G fuck. I want to play games and play in zero-G too. I want to spacewalk, wear the gear, and...you know, that's how I'd like to die too.

I am not a multi-millionaire. I cannot afford to visit space.
