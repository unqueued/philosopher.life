title: 2019.12.02 - DeathOfRobinhood: Phone Call

DeathOfRobinhood answered, and he suggested we switch to Signal to make sure I wouldn't be charged for the phone call. 

It was a pleasant conversation. We talked about our weekends, non-profits, Thailand, [[Charlie]], Selah, his immediate family and in-laws, my family, the nature of work which is rewarding (vs. delayed gratification), and Tokyo drifting a boat. 

He needed to get home (it's crazy cold, and so he waited at work to speak with me), and eat. It was excellent speaking with him. We're going to call again.
