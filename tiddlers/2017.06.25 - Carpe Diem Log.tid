title: 2017.06.25 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up, shut the door, fireman time!
* I woke up really early, so I was actually the first one downstairs. I surfed while people trickled down. 
* I watched a bit of league too!
* After everyone left, I took my DCK and watched Rick and Morty until it started to hit. 
* I was already set up to meditate in my room. That's what I did. 
** It was hard work, and I'm glad I did it.
* The family arrived before my meditation ended.
* My son showed me what he and his sister had made in Sunday school. It was cute and interesting. He put on a show.
* I came downstairs and finished my DCK writing. 
* My daughter started her schoolwork, and my son went out to play (since he had finished his). 
* I set up power and ethernet cords around the house.
* I tried calling the Landlord (corporate HQ really), but nobody answered. I'll try again tomorrow.
* We went shopping for groceries. It went by quickly, and it was fun.
* We put groceries away. My son came back to help us. 
** We've been giving him more roaming freedom.
** He now marks on the chalkboard where he is in addition to telling us.
* We made chili and cornbread for later in the evening.
* I made the sexy times with mi amor.
** I am surprised that I can achieve it through the DCK afterglow now.
** It is possible the effects are weakening on me. In any case, things seem to be working.
* My wife and I talked. We planned our DND game.
* I planned and wrote about it. Everyone had a blast building characters.
** The kids were excited to the point of being rude actually.
* We had our family meeting while we ate.
* I chatted briefly with my friend ALM.
* I'm writing this, getting some water, and gonna watch some Rick and Morty while I try to fall asleep. 
** DCK's ability to prevent me from sleeping is still there.
** I will assume it is harder for DCK to disassociate me now. I believe I am more integrated than I was.
