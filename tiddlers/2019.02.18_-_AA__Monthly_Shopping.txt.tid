type: text/plain

Your Monday going well? You get enough caffeine? :P
MON 8:52 AM
Getting caffeinated now —no school on this celebration of the Presidents
MON 10:07 AM
We are attempting to do grocery shopping for the month...in the past that has saved us money but I need a good list so I don’t miss things
MON 10:08 AM
How’s your Monday?
MON 10:08 AM
Only for those who deserve the day off. There is no rest for the wicked! I have the opportunity to go in today, lol.
MON 10:08 AM
Woot woot?
MON 10:08 AM
If I had a deepfreezer, I would do that.
MON 10:08 AM
Yeah we got a small one
MON 10:09 AM
I still have to get the refrigerated stuff.
MON 10:09 AM
Hoping to go out two weeks worth on the things that won’t keep
MON 10:09 AM
Save you time and money.
MON 10:10 AM
Yeah I am less likely to buy stuff I don’t need
MON 10:10 AM
From what I understand, South Koreans spend the least amount of time shopping of any developed nation.
MON 10:10 AM
That too!
MON 10:10 AM
Sometimes I like to wander in the store, but most of the time I am on a mission to escape with all the necessary loots in speed record runtime.
MON 10:11 AM
I cheese the bosses, abuse the geometry, swear at my cart, and bunny hop strafe for that bleeding edge.
MON 10:12 AM
Yeah and then I get blocked by little old ladies studying labels right in front of whatever I need ...it’s a conspiracy....every aisle
MON 10:13 AM
lol
MON 10:13 AM
How are you managing your list?
MON 10:14 AM
I'm a man who likes to make lists.
MON 10:14 AM
How can I get them to move without being rude?.... that’s the game
MON 10:14 AM
I tell them not to get what they have in their hands: it's poison.
MON 10:15 AM
I made a menu for the month and am basing my list off of that and then adding the other things (toiletries and such) as I remember them ...wandering the store in my mind
MON 10:15 AM
Ooooo thats a good one
MON 10:15 AM
We have a mouse in the house...most of one, at least.
MON 10:17 AM
I'm not sure how to convince my cats that I don't eat mice.
MON 10:18 AM
We have cats... though from time to time we will have one but mice don’t last long here
MON 10:18 AM
Yeah cats like to give presents
