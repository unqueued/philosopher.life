K said he got ahold of you on here, so I’m going to leave this book of a response here and hope you see it.

I’ll keep my phone on me today so I can respond.

Let me start this off by saying that this has been a long time coming. Too long. And truthfully I regret that. I have failed miserably at dealing with everything that’s come my way lately, but we’ll get to that. I just wanted to let you know right off the bat that I’m sorry for avoiding you for so long.

I read what your post and talked about it with K. I know you already guessed much of what I’m about to say, but you deserve a full explanation. Much of what K conveyed to you for me were things that I’d told him over a period of time to help convince myself that what I was doing was okay. (Specifically, that the chat we used was too inconvenient, that I’ve been busy, or that I’ve been sick.) All of them are true, but ultimately not the REAL reasons that it was happening or even legitimate reasons to not talk to you.

You hit the nail on the head at several points throughout your post, namely that I was experiencing sever anxiety/depression. I won’t say that what I went through was by any means close to how bad it can truly get for some, but it was the worst I’ve ever personally experienced. There were several months where I could hardly muster the motivation to go to work and would just lie in bed and “work from home”. One little thing that was wrong that day would be enough to keep me at home, which just made my predicament worse. There were points where I was legitimately sick, but I think most of it was mental.

As for where it all came from... I honestly was depressed about my work life. I felt like I wasn’t gaining anything of value, that nothing I did was meaningful, that I was expendable. It felt like everything I tried to do to make it better actually only made it worse. And the whole time I kept remembering our conversations about Humana.

I kept thinking about how you were coercing me into getting back into chemical engineering now while I’m still young. Instead of taking your guidance as encouragement like I usually do, I was punishing myself for even accepting the Humana job in the first place. I felt like a failure because I didn’t remember much of my schooling. I was worried because I didn’t think I had enough engineering experience to warrant even trying to get back into the field. I was an emotional mess. Alongside that, I had another friend who was also trying to encourage me to look around for ChemE jobs and it was just adding to the mental torrent (to no fault of his own). I hardly talked to anyone but K and the people in front of me, let alone friends and family.

So while all of this was happening, we also suddenly had more obligations than normal. Family obligations, holidays, big work projects, and anime conventions were just some of the things piling up. Trying to juggle all this AND climb out of my dark hole was proving nearly impossible.

As more time passed, I realized it had been far too long since I’d talked to you and I felt terrible for it. Nearly every day I’d think about you, k0sh3k, and the kids and had no idea how to re-build the bridge I thought I’d torn down. I felt selfish, but every time K would say “just call him” a swarm of panic would keep me from even being able to touch my phone. I even found myself avoiding my computer because it would remind me of my failure. (Remember that perfectionist problem you mentioned? Yeah... definitely applies here.) The guilt was only building. I thought for sure you all were angry with me or thought I’d taken sides in this family stuff and didn’t want any more to do with me. I realize now that was my anxiety/depression talking. I should know better than to think you would turn away from me so easily.

Thankfully though, I have a husband solid as a rock. He held on through the whole experience, let me pour my heart out to him wherever I needed, and most importantly helped me through this reconnecting process. Honestly, when I saw the title of your post I almost burst into tears. I want nothing more than to start over with you all. I feel awful for letting it get this far and pointing fingers at everything other than what the actual problem was. Unfortunately, I am historically terrible at understanding the source of my depression and dealing with it. I hope, despite everything, that you can forgive me and we can truly start over.

I think that addresses pretty much everything. Please call me out for clarification if something doesn’t make sense. Typing this all up has felt so freeing. This is honestly probably the happiest I’ve felt since I first started climbing out of “the pit” as I like to call it. In the mean time, let’s work on finding a platform that we both like to communicate on. I want to see the messages you send me at random times of the day so I can respond to them when I’m best able. Also, if you’re okay with it, I may occasionally send you all physical letters because I thoroughly enjoy them and want an excuse to use paper and pen.

Had a wonderful discussion with L for 2 hours. We talked about a great number of things. We talked about strategies for reasoning about low-hanging fruit cosmetics/appearances for my daughter. We talked about K's brothers, depression, and living away from our parents. L and I talk about family life quite a bit. We talked about being older siblings, brainwashing, and her younger sister.

L told me about her cosplay. She put a lot of thought and work into it. It's a different world, and even though I've seen it online and read about it, it's really different hearing it from L's perspective. 

Her mother is worried about L losing her faith, and I can see why. L has some epistemology that borders on relativism. Her doubt seems to take a different course than mine, and I hope it will be constructive for her. I talked to L about that I don't want her to feel alone because she may continue to experience vertigo on that front. 

L said she's reading through the [[MWF]]+[[SLT]] threads I left for her. L told me that my donors have warned her about me (yet again), including that I'm selling drugs now. Lol. Jesus. Of course, I considered the possibility back when I grew mushrooms years ago. I don't have a conceptual problem with it either; it can be incredibly moral. But, the fact is that I don't sell drugs. I've never found the risk to be one worth taking. I make them for myself, and I've got what I need for myself. I am not surprised to see their lies. They really must hold onto their dark-triadic confabulations. This one isn't up to me. I can't help but smile a little bit in recognizing that my version of the story appears more coherent to those who know us best...how frightening it must be to even distantly face the possibility that I might be right about them. Their minds won't even let that happen though. Let's be honest, the game is over.

It's sad to hear that AA&UJ may have bought the story as well, regularly warning L about me and my brothers. They really don't care about my side of the story. L does though. I appreciate that very much. I'll still read the book we were sent and respond carefully to it. I have doubts they are interested in any opinion which doesn't agree with their own, but that's okay. I'm going to give them the chance anyways.

L talked about growing comfortable with Humana. That makes me sad, since I think ultimately her work is used for evil. She is finding ways to pad her resume and gain experience though. She was not clear about what she intends to do with her ChemE dream. I actually don't feel like we've gotten anywhere. She was thinking about it, went into the pit, climbed out, and...she I fear she may just fall back into that pit without taking action. I could be entirely wrong though. I'm hoping she finds the right path for her.

I'm going to try Signal and Keybase with her to start.

We chatted well into the night.
