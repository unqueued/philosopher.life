title: 2019.01.22 - Kitty Kat Korner: Literally

Ranga's piano top is gone with the piano. He is either pining for it or exploring the negative space in our living room. He is curled up in the corner playing with some ethernet cords (noes!!). In this case, he seems to feel defensively superior in the corner against Chairman Meow (despite elevation privileges she can acquire). Is this a holdover from when the piano made a cat king of the mountain? I think so. The inference is a bad one, but he is so comfy looking.

My cats love the carpet (too much), but I adore watching them sleep with abandon on the floor (or anywhere).
