title: 2020.02.19 - Wiki Review: Twinkie, Not Toaster Strudel, Plz

* [[Links: Dats]]
** Still not updating correctly. Hrm. Well, we'll see.
* [[2020.02.18 - Prompted Introspection: Families]]
** Edited. I still don't have a definition of family that I find effective enough.
* [[2020.02.18 - TDL: Groceries]]
** You didn't do a good job. It's not like you didn't get anything done, but you didn't push hard enough. 
*** You also went to bed crazy early. That is fine. You didn't try hard enough while you were awake.
* [[2020.02.18 - Wiki Review: Formaldehyde Casualdejekyll]]
** Oh, hrm, I wonder (maybe two signals). There is a small chance [[SLT]] is reading this. `/wave`
*** I'm going to remind you that you can [[speak anonymously with me|Contact]] (I suggest protonmail, and we can build far more if you need).
* [[2020.02.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Substance of Shadow]]
** Completed. 
** It's going to be interesting to have offspring which so many consider pointless, useless to them, a poor fit for capitalism. I hope we have the tools for them to thrive in it despite the pressure. 
* [[My Rainbow]]
** This parts from my goal to be a plaintextual as I can. It's embracing TW further. I would like to make it easy to pick out things which matter to people. Reminds me of the need for versioning too.
* [[@: All]]
** I have no idea if it will see much use. Experiments.
* [[2020.02.18 - Link Log: Totally Sober]]
** I need more of this keyboard smashing //gibberish;lasdfj;lasdjfasdf//.
*** It's interesting to see my daughter bring it up today as well.
** Alright, I'll do it. Ping.
