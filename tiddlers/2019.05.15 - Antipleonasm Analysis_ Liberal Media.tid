title: 2019.05.15 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Liberal Media

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
[The "liberal media"] love to be denounced from the right, and the right loves to denounce them, because that makes them look like courageous defenders of freedom and independence while, in fact, they are imposing all of the presuppositions of the propaganda system.

I participated in a 30-minute survey from Vanderbilt last night, and the guy asked me a series of basic political questions. I chose "other" and explained myself whenever I could. I also had to identify as liberal or conservative and then democrat or republican.  There was no space outside of the Overton window which was being examined. You didn't exist on this poll unless you fit a highly specified set of categories. I am all in favor of naming and pigeon-holing, but I expect robust mechanisms for defining ourselves. 

The [[pright]] and [[pleft]] are dialectical entities themselves, comprised of dialectics internally. At least for the spectacle of political theatre in media, however, the appearance of those dialectics are profoundly warped (and go on to affect the actual dialectic in [[The Great Human Conversation]] profoundly). The "liberal media" is a red herring though, misdirected by the elite, and a strawman for the [[pright]]. I'm not sure how far it goes the other direction, particularly since conservative social mechanics enable more effective in/outgrouping. 

I find the "liberal media" absurdly [[pright]], and it's obviously propaganda to me. The facade of representing the fundamental disagreement is all they need to keep us chained to the interests of the elite.
