My brother recently asked me about what the end game in D2 looks like. That is not like him, especially since I've basically stopped playing for quite a while (and he knows this [or should]). He was searching for something to talk about?

I'm going to start talking more about my wiki with him. I should talk about what is important to me with him. No reason to search.

You will never have the opportunity to claim you didn't have the chance to know me. I have sealed off that excuse to you forever. Extirpating you has been incredibly painful. I don't deny the good in our relationship, but I cannot hold the good without the bad. It's a matter of integrity. Thus, you have been re-written in my perceptions; the redpill was strong. I tell you this: knowing what I know would destroy you. I see sublation is not likely. I forgive you for not wanting to be destroyed.

I am often reminded of our differences in preferences. I hope you can see this is not simply a preference for me. It's quite serious. Call it koolaid: you clearly do not understand. Claim it's the drugs: have you even looked at my usage? I keep detailed records; I've researched a lot. This was not some accident to get high. I've been wiser than my doctors in self-medication. You aren't paying attention.

It is kinder for both of us to stay away from each other.
