title: 2019.04.24 - Afterschool Teaching: Mexico

Whitney said she has been feeling weird. It's probably stress. It's amazing that this woman is going to be paid to teach given the trouble she is having in school.

Delp accused me via the librarian of having allowed my children to break her smartboard computer. I actually saw that error yesterday, a BSOD, but none of my children touched it (though I have no problem with them using the smartboard). He said the librarian was going to talk to me about it; I gave her the chance, but she didn't speak to me. He came back later to apologize to me. 

Our numbers appear to be diminishing, and I think many are heading home earlier. Mitchell says this is normal, especially since so many kids have sports to play. 

I took everyone who had homework and the usual library group. 7Hm has his mother's crazy-streak, and he barely tries. 

Everyone is ganging up on 5NP. I'm having to draw lines. The kid only deserves part of it.

6CM and 7Jm required plenty of my discipline today. 7Jm in sat next to me, against his will, several times. I make him and 5NP2 cry sometimes (or bring them to the edge). Neither have fathers. I give them very little breathing space in the dialectic, and I'm a stickler for doing our work and respecting others. 

7SR and I talked for a while one on one. She doesn't know what her parents do for a living. She claims to hate socializing, and I talked to her about the way she maintains her social capital (used that exact phrase) in the school. Yeah, she blushed and gave me the knowing smile. Like most of the kids, she is proud of her hatred of reading. I found out, however, that she does like Anne Franke. We talked a bit about that.

My namesake and I talked about swearing and defeating trolls. I'm trying to help her avoid the social stigma that won't be useful to her. 

6HM and 9AM, sisters, talked about their lives with me. I talked about my own children with them too. They have some upward mobility in their lives, and I hope they take it.

5CM and I spoke at length. He is heading to Mexico for the summer. He's going to journal about it and take pictures. I've been encouraging him to read. He needs it. I'm heartbroken to see that his family will be relying upon his paperwork since they have been defined as an underclass to be exploited in capitalism. He will be the first in his family to have an official driver's license. My heart breaks for this young man.  

5:24f was 4:24f because her mom's boss is gone today. We talked about her reading list and record-keeping. She actually reads, and I treat her like an adult for it.

I did a lot of wandering and engaging in 1-on-1s. 

I've been asking all the kids why they are in the program. They are aware of the babysitting.
