title: 2020.02.24 - TDL: Repeat

* We had a great day. Let's do it again.
** This time, we'll be reading each others' papers, brainstorming, critiquing, shaping, editing, and maybe revising for our teacher.
** When "the essence" of linear algebra starts to get too hard, we'll switch.
*** Make sure your son and daughter pause and use the chalkboard more. That did a fuckton of work.
* Try and continue accountability by walking through the [[Review]] chains.
** I'm interested to see their own review thoughts. May they be different and useful to them.
* Pineapple, salad, and maybe something with rice.
* Hey, hey, hey, vape erryday.
* Also, [[Recent Obsession]] awaits.
