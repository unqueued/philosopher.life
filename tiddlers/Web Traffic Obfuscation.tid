title: Web Traffic Obfuscation

I am well aware of the severe limitations and flaws of this activity. I'm also convinced it is a non-trivial defense and attack. This is monkeywrenching, and it doesn't need to be perfect.

I aim to: 

* at least partially blur my web identity by polluting my web traffic
* burst my unelected filter-bubbles 
* disrupt the signal-to-noise ratio of targeted advertising against me while wrecking their wallets
* shove random noise-fists up my ISPs' asses

Sites/Scripts:

* https://github.com/essandess/isp-data-pollution/blob/master/isp_data_pollution.py
** I'll wait on it.
* https://github.com/benyanke/internet_noise_bash/blob/master/generate_noise.sh
** Seems adaptable.
* https://fascinatedbox.github.io/RuinMyHistory/Ruin.html
** Seems pretty weak.

Extensions (none are great):

* Noiszy
** Randomly open sites
* Chaff
** Randomly open sites
* TrackMeNot
** Random searches

Make Me Happy:

* AdNauseam
** Valuable noise-maker and spends advertisers dollars
* AutoMute
** I don't want to hear anything
* Random User-Agent
** Fuck it.
* I'm not robot catpcha clicker
** No idea if it is useful.
