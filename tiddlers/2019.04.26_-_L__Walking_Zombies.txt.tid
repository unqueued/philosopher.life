I've been recommended a book, if you want to read it with me: "How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy"
MON 5:13 PM
Ooohhhhh
MON 5:43 PM
It sounds like something I’d be interested in. Paper or digital?
MON 5:43 PM
I'm going to ILL it.
MON 5:45 PM
Paper for me.
MON 5:45 PM

How'd your day go?
THU 7:25 PM
Hey [[h0p3]]! I pretty much forgot my phone existed last night so I missed your message. My day has been alright. I’ve actually been conducting interviews to hire on new people to my current team. Nice experience to have before I throw myself back into the job market.
FRI 11:50 AM
I’m also monstrously tired today, which has pretty much been the theme for this whole week. [[K]] and I woke up like zombies.
FRI 11:51 AM
I am glad you forgot your phone. That is unlike you sometimes. Hard to disconnect. I hope it was excellent.
FRI 11:51 AM
I'm glad you are interviewing too! I'm sure it's a powerful experience.
FRI 11:51 AM
I'm sorry you are so tired. I hope you have the chance to chill this weekend.
FRI 11:52 AM
[[K]] sounds like he's been super busy too.
FRI 11:52 AM
The semester is coming to an end, and hopefully it will cool down for him (and all the others in our family who work on that schedule).
FRI 11:52 AM
The experience has reminded me how truly not terrifying interviews are, despite the anxiety I feel before they happen.
FRI 11:52 AM
Good.
FRI 11:52 AM
Yeah, this semester is really wearing on him... he’s so ready to be done with school.
FRI 11:52 AM
And as for forgetting my phone, taking time to be away from it has been a refreshing experience. I’ve been trying to mix things up a little so I’m not so disconnected from what’s around me all the time.
FRI 11:54 AM
I’ve been on two walks this week around downtown Louisville. One was a long trip around the waterfront park. I wandered around and just took in the sights. I found this spooky hallway/walkway thing that runs under the 64 ramp over here. It was painted lavender for some reason, which made it all the more strange.
FRI 11:56 AM
Speak of the devil, I was writing: I don't know much about your lives (that's sad to say), but I can't recommend walking with one's spouse more highly. It's often the highlight of my day.
FRI 11:57 AM

FRI 11:57 AM
Solid pic. =)
FRI 11:57 AM
I think [[K]] and I would really benefit from it. I generally feel reluctant to ask because he’s so busy/tired.
FRI 11:57 AM
I feel like our general exhaustion keeps me from doin a lot of things. We haven’t explored as much around our neighborhood as I would like.
FRI 11:59 AM
I'm often the one who initiates. I spend my capital and my wife's spoons on that with regularity. I appreciate that she is extremely busy and has medical conditions which make her tired. I hate imposing on her in this way, but I'm continually convinced it is the correct thing to do. She comes around to it. Most of the time there is no push at all; it's just a habit now.
FRI 12:00 PM
Hmmm... that’s helpful. I often think he and I don’t exercise as much as we should, and the time away from screens would be beneficial.
FRI 12:02 PM
It is a source of sanity, realtalk, the usual human [[phenomenological]] necessities in being in the world, and the exercise is paramount (since we both sit on our asses all day long). It is good for your depression. I think the  more you don't feel like it, the more you probably need to do it.
FRI 12:02 PM
I'm not convinced screentime is necessarily bad (doesn't look like the evidence points to it). I have no room to speak on the exercise front of course; I'm wildly out of shape, lol.
FRI 12:03 PM
Do straight lines qualify as shapes? Because if so then I’m a shape... of sorts....
FRI 12:04 PM
Lol =)
FRI 12:04 PM
I often struggle against the “the more I don’t want to the more I really should” mentality when it comes to things that are good for me. [[K]] is much stronger than me in that aspect.
FRI 12:05 PM
I hear that, and I can't say I'm any better, lol. Whatever [[K]] is doing sometimes feels like magic to me.
FRI 12:06 PM
I can say, looking back, not all of my activities were so valuable in the long-term. I'm easily distracted and lost in thought. Holding hands, walking, and talking with those I love the most: that one continues to snowball for me. I know [[k0sh3k]] and I can spend hours in our own worlds reading, watching, and writing (and, we spend a good deal of time thinking about each other's writing). It's hard to prune the 10,000 things down to the handful of feasible salient ones.
FRI 12:09 PM
Good food for thought. I think [[K]] and I could benefit from some quality us time too.
FRI 12:11 PM
I ask for the walk right after I hug her upon first seeing her each week day. It might be more important for me because I'm a hermit though. You guys seem to get out more, so it might not be as important for you.
FRI 12:11 PM
I find that walking is good for me because it satisfies my need to explore. That, and I get stir crazy being inside all day no matter what kind of “inside” it is. But I crave time with [[K]], more than just sitting in the same general area with him. The more we talk about it the more it sounds like we should just make time for it.
FRI 12:22 PM
Do you all go for walks even when it rains?
FRI 12:43 PM
Aye. We use umbrellas. My wife is not fond of bad weather, and she hates the cold.
FRI 12:44 PM
Still worth it.
FRI 12:44 PM
Hehe, neither am I. We have big umbrellas though, and [[K]] loves the rain, so I think he’d like it even more.
FRI 12:45 PM
