!! What is a New Year's Eve you will never forget?

My daughter was born on New Year's Eve (and my son on New Year's Day). My wife needed another dozen donuts, and on the way to checkout, her water broke. I, of course, could not help but ask if she had peed herself, rofl. The worst part is that we didn't get the donuts because you aren't supposed to eat in labor. She got mighty hungry.

To my knowledge, it was not a particularly difficult birth. I've decided, I had the easy job.

When my daughter was born, she bleeted like a purple alien. They didn't let us hold her immediately. They ran their tests, and then we got to hold her for the first time. It was a mammalian moment I will treasure. Looking back, I can't believe we did it, but we did! It's been a breakneck pace since then.

We also entered labor with my son on New Year's Eve. His was far more dangerous, and we are lucky my wife is alive. Due to a doctor's mistake, my son was born late, 9 pounds. He was a block, a jaundiced yellow brick with thrush and an insatiable appetite. As the doctors rushed to save my wife (I didn't know she was dying, but they gave her opiates despite our clear instructions about her allergies), they handed him to me. I didn't even think about why they would hand my son to be, but I was happy.

I fed my son 6oz. God damn, boy! He even slept through the night. I'm grateful to have two healthy children. Admittedly, I still don't understand it.
