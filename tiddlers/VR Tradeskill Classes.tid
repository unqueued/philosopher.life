title: VR Tradeskill Classes

I'm not sure how much competition I want to generate for myself. It is clear, however, that education will be radically altered by this medium. I'm not saying all forms of education can be reduced to it. Obviously, that can't be the case. However, there are significant opportunities here.

VR costs a lot for the equipment, but it doesn't cost nearly as much as a lot of industrial equipment and raw materials. A well-built VR class could be incredibly valuable. Imagine learning to do the math, the science, and various concepts in VR. Just like the Sculpting game, you can do many kinds of tradeskills in VR. Imagine putting it into practice in the field. Have a video game where you literally navigate various construction sites and practice. Turn the swearing up, make the interactions like an RPG in a sense, and actually train people to work in the field.
