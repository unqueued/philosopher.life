title: 2018.12.18 - blair@blairreeves.me: Preach

Hello Blair,

I stumbled upon your http://blairreeves.me/2018/12/12/the-internet-as-television/ post. Preach, yo. 

I suggest profound decentralization is at the heart of succeeding in that vision. A Web 3.0 built upon sending [[others]] the static (and open source) components to compile and run the site dynamically clientside<<ref "d">> enables us to own our data and algorithms;<<ref "o">> it is the only escape from the centralization of power.<<ref "w">> Unfortunately, it may require nation-state level resources to build an effective tool.<<ref "c">> The end-to-end principle must be applied to peers, and until we are functional peers on the internet, our intermediaries pwn and MITM attack us. I [[hope]], but I do not predict we will acquire our [[Humanity]] again. Perhaps it is a topic we can explore together.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
