I began writing my response to your [[post|https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/cdqrux/wheres_the_sneerclub_effort_posts/etx08kk/]], and then realized I just needed to do it in my wiki instead.<<ref "l">> Thank you for [[reaching out|contact]] to me [[nomad]]. It is my pleasure to write a letter to you. If you are ever interested in being penpals and having a [[hyperconversation]], I'm here. 

<<<
I'm perennially fascinated by your wiki, even if I've no idea what exactly to make of it.
<<<

That is high praise. Thank you. 

You might check out [[help]] and the [[Root]] [[directories]]. Like myself, my wiki is still not sane enough, I'm afraid. It might not look like it, but I'm doing my best over here. I'm a schizotypal autistic man, so I'm not a great communicator (not even with myself).

<<<
It reminds me of the stories I write for myself and occasionally share with trusted friends, like some kind of Darger-esque doomed project.
<<<

I wish we all had more trusted friends to share the stories of our lives with. One of my goals is to show people what it's like to be themselves online, to be transparent, and to build ourselves in the sunlight. I'm doing a terrible job. Lol.

It's painful and funny that you call it a Darger-esque doomed project. Yeah, that's probably right. I'm a madman. Sometimes I feel like Noah.<<ref "u">> I'm pretty sure most people, except [[my wife|k0sh3k]] and few [[others]], believe I'm throwing my life away by writing it into this wiki.

Also, I owe you an apology for not responding [[a year ago|https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/8tx0oa/seeking_wikilifeloggers/e1azrmc/)]]. I hope to be the kind of person who responds, and I didn't. //I'm sorry//. [[IA2DYJ]], I'd like to make it up to you!

<<<
I read your wiki when I saw you posting on sneer club like two weeks ago. Gotta admit I haven't the foggiest what your actual position is. I ended up thinking you were nrx or something because of all the Kant. 
<<<

It's not your fault that you don't know what my position is. I can barely articulate what I see already. It's hard work, and my progress is slowing down (to my great frustration). I [[hope]] you can forgive me for being [[gibberish|2019.04.21 - /b/]] and [[IATVMOASRM]].

You are correct, I'm especially indebted to Saint Kant. He is a difficult man to wrestle with. I appreciate your listening so closely enough to my pile of words to know that.<<ref "n">> It is rare that I meet people who empathize with weird, manic strangers online. Thank you.

As to my position: I'm a ''shitty'' and overambitious [[Straussian]] interpreter of Saints [[Plato|Saint Plato]], Aristotle, Kant, [[Hegel|Conceiving About The Inconceivable]], Marx, [[Heidegger|Phenomenology]], and [[Rawls|The Original Position]]. I don't participate in academic philosophy anymore; I just don't fit in as myself.<<ref "t">> I'm still "doing" philosophy, but trying another route in the wiki. It's rogue, [[arrogant]], and stupid. I'm a retarded rebel. My {[[Axioms]]} are in shambles, so feel free to call me a crackpot. They are hard problems. I'm currently working on some metaethics, [[Game Theory Agents]], the nature of <<tag [[Dark Triadicism]]>>and what it means to decentralize [[power]]. 

<<<
I did like the idea of making a wiki like this; what tools do you use/what's your setup?
<<<

My [[RGM]] is kinda madcap and sprawling. My daughter, [[j3d1h]], and my son, [[1uxb0x]], help administer the wikis for our [[family|Family Log]]. It has changed and continues to change. I use a lot of tools in [[Computing]].

Singlefile mode with Firefox works just fine. You appear competent with technology, so you might want to jump straight into the deeper end of the pool. If you don't use linux, I suggest it for this project (even if only in VM). I recommend TW5-Bob. Use zerotier to enable multi-device. [[Wiki: Chromium Setup]] is my dedicated wiki-browser on [[m10]]. There's a lot of tools that help along the edges, indirectly, and for serving your wiki to others. It would be my honor to help you set it up given what you have. 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
