title: 2019.10.07 - Sphygmus: 𖡟 Rabbitholed 𖡟

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

Dear [[Sphygmus]],<<ref "inf">>

* Unless I think it looks too ugly, you get the funkiest letter I've written.
** I hope it's mostly an outline-letter and a celebration of an aspect of writing in the wiki which I think you've made a high-art.
** I think you won't mind me experimenting here, even if it is silly or not effective in the end. 
** I'm maximizing the bullet-pointed formatting for now.
*** Celebratin' dat brainstorming, sub-proofs, and [[salient]]-threading.
**** It enables me to see which branches and leaves can or ought be grown, fragmented, or restructured. 
***** Links and [ctrl+f]-able identical phrases are my ghetto tags, or something like that.
***** Limits my use of parentheses and footnotes.
****** Seems more monotone for it.
**** Seems obvious, but I just don't do it well enough.
*** I know paragraphs have something similar going on, but I'm convinced the explicit nested structuring isn't just [[beautiful]], but useful.
*** I'm a huge fan of the way you think in bullet-points. It's got the gunky quality all parsed up into purposeful trees.
**** I'd like to practice reasoning and communicating this way with you as well. 
** I'm trying to be open-ended in how this letter is built.
*** I'm thankful I can still read your wiki every day, [[@]]'n'chat with you, and read your //Log://. I think it makes me feel like I have more license in how long I take or how oddly I write letters. It allows me to develop a richer and more thorough voice. I need that. 
**** Writing, particularly after significant and unconfident digestion, is often so much more expensive than reading for me.

<<<
I'm not sure what I covered last time we talked, but it's been a busy and emotional few months for me, though I'm not sure I remember half of it. 
<<<

* Looks like you've been on a rocketship this year. 
** You've had a ton of changes and new things to wrestle with.

* Thank goodness for our wikis here. Writing, reviewing, reading it with others seems to provide some of that necessary repetition for remembering our stories, even if only implicitly, tacitly, or virtue-theoretically. 
** I'm not sure it helps me explicitly enough though, and, of course, the wiki is often so chaotic. It still helps jump back into the feelings and cognition of a timeslice. 

<<<
* ''April:'' I had to go back and read our discord messages to remember what I was up to. 😅 Looks like I was all about letterboxing and getting Arch Linux set up on my chrome book then.
* ''May:'' I ~~finally~~ started progress on applying to jobs -- which mostly looked like making lists of them on Indeed. I applied to a "Business Analyst Web Development" position, and also an Archive Assistant position that a coworker recommended me for. Then I stopped applying to anything else. I started working on the [[CollectScents|https://sphygm.us/#CollectScents]] web app while waiting to hear back from jobs (and trying to build my portfolio).
* ''June:'' I was feeling on average pretty down in both May and June, and generally sick of working retail at a store that felt like it was on the brink of collapsing. I had two interviews this month (for the two positions I applied for in May) and both went well, despite much anxiety on my part. I got final results at the end of the month and started the transition to a new job.<<footnote "m" "The business analyst position was 'put on hold' so I accepted the Archive Assistant position.">> I also picked Stardew Valley back up and almost all of my spare time was spent playing that.
<<<

* I adore that we can relive and rethink our [[hyperconversation]]. 

* I'm not used to having relationships like ours which are built with thinking about the whole of our lifelong discussion with each other so thoroughly. 
** The slowness of it is sometimes a profound strength; there's still a ton of...torque. 
** You help me understand my attempts with so many people, including [[offline]] blood relatives, to have a relationship centered around thinking about and communicating with each other so remotely through systematic writing. 
*** I'm grateful. 
*** I still feel like a noob at it.
** Intimacy, deep relationships, high price to read and write, terror of vulnerability.

* I am so happy you got out of retail. 

* I can appreciate how much anxiety and perhaps depression goes into the leap you've made. 
** I'm sorry that it may have felt like a deep valley you weren't confident you'd climb out of. 
*** From what I can tell, it's paying off. 
** I'm so happy to see you emerge from that season of life so victorious. You've been kicking ass.

<<<
This month has been completing the transition from my old job to my new job! I tried to leave things in a decent state at the art store, making sure my knowledge about our email system and website got transferred as much as possible to the people taking over those roles. Really saw how much I'd been doing when having to train people on all of it. 
<<<

* That makes good sense to me. 
** It's cool to pass on that institutional knowledge and give shape to what it may become without you. 
*** I bet that was satisfying in a way. 
*** You will probably continue to do that again and again over the years. 

* Leaving jobs, perhaps just big changes in general, are surreal. 
** It's an in-your-face time of reflection (hardly to say I am successful).

* You still seem to be making lots of transitions. 
** I [[hope]] to become as thoughtful as you so often are in your planning. 

<<<
Now I'm starting my 5th full week at the new job - I can barely believe it's been that much time already! I've been learning and doing so much each day compared to where I was before, so the workdays go by quickly instead of dragging on.
<<<

* Seems to me like you're still learning at a brisk pace even months later. That is awesome. 
** I think it's cool that Peach is so helpful to your learning and play too. It's awesome to have someone to geek out with in-person every day. 
** Besides the commute (though audiobooks go a long way), it sounds like your workdays, even after work, just fly by.

<<<
Before college, when I was still in high school, an organization called QuestBridge got my name and sent an informational mailing about going to college as a low income student. I applied for and was awarded a spot in a college prep conference they were having, which is more relevant to the story later. I also applied early action to several colleges through them (which waived application fees) and while I wasn't matched with any schools for a full ride scholarship, that application did lead to my early acceptance from the University of Chicago and (I'm sure I've mentioned) between a very generous local scholarship and uChicago's financial aid package, I'm now on the other side with no loans. All that to say -- I don't know what your plans when you start going into that process with your kids, but I think it's definitely worth looking into the resources QuestBridge could provide. 
<<<

* So jelly of getting out without loans! Even with full-rides and jobs, with my offspring, we couldn't afford to live without loans. 

* Thank you for telling me about QuestBridge! That's going to become important to us in the next couple of years. 
** [[k0sh3k]]'s new job may put us over the line on what counts as low-income. 
*** Thailand was the last time we had those kinds of resources. 
** Thank you for thinking about this with me; there are very few people in my life that talk with me about this subject (which is ridiculously important to me). 

* We're still thinking about whether or not we should homeschool in CT. The next few years are going to be make or break for my offspring. 

<<<
Because of the pre-college program I was a part of, I've been included in the Quest activities in college and since then, though I didn't really do a lot with the student organization at uChicago. Anyway, long way around, QuestBridge turned 25 this year and had a celebratory conference in San Francisco this past weekend which I just got back from! That could be the subject of a whole letter by itself! Will be?
<<<

* That is cool as hell. I'm sure it will be something to remember, perhaps a capstone to a substory too. 
** I'm glad you got to travel to a city too since it's right up your alley. 

<<<
So, now I'm back to living regular life.
<<<

* XD. It still seems so exceptional to me. Closer to regular, as the average person lives.
** It's easier to see the regularity of it lately though. With your opening up, I'm grateful to see your everydayness too. It's not something I get to see from most people online. 
*** Usually, people say it isn't worth capturing or some such. That's so weird to me. I think it's part of honesty and sucking out the marrow.

<<<
I was so unsure about what life would be like without the structure of school as a college senior, and between the new job and the conference I'm sitting here with that uncertainty again. It's different, because I'm actually living in it now rather than anticipating it, but still.
<<<

* I do not handle uncertainty terribly well. Despite being all over the place, I'm a glutton for structure, repetition, and routine. 
** I've enjoyed watching you settle into things but then keep on diving deeper.

<<<
I've essentially hit the majority of the major life milestones and from here until I'm 40, and 80, and so on is gonna be about how I choose to fill that time, rather than aiming to complete certain checkbox goals.<<footnote "well" "really the only big two left are marriage and kids and those feel generally less obligatory than everything before them. The kid question is a knotty one and idk even how to think about it, so I haven't. Right now I'm telling myself that I don't want kids b/c idk, a world dying of climate change seems like a shitty place to inherit - idk, it's a Gordian Knot if I ever saw one.">>
<<<

* This milestone line has stuck with me for a while. I think our lives are telic cannons. 
** The question of what these lives are for the sake of, [[gfwiwcgws]], is crucial to me. 
** I agree you've hit the majority of the major life milestones. 
*** I am curious to know what you will make of your vocation. 
**** Some call it an 80,000 hour problem (though I cannot say I'm a fan of that reasoning). 
*** Perhaps you increasingly have the generalized building blocks to specialize and channel yourself into what matters most to you.
 
<<<
...really the only big two left are marriage and kids and those feel generally less obligatory than everything before them. The kid question is a knotty one and idk even how to think about it, so I haven't. Right now I'm telling myself that I don't want kids b/c idk, a world dying of climate change seems like a shitty place to inherit - idk, it's a Gordian Knot if I ever saw one.
<<<

* I see that in you. One thing I admire about your reasoning about the world, as it is sprinkled in your wiki, is how practical you are in your approach to building healthy environments. 
** To my eyes, you've been sensibly thinking about the relationship you hope to have with your significant other with consistency. It makes sense to me to hammer that out before worrying too much about kids.

* One of my favorite answers to the Gordian Knot is adoption. 

* What do you feel is most obligatory about your life now? 

<<<
Similarly, something that's been on my mind lately is self-perception through change, and how to think about who I've been in the past when it can feel so different from who I am now.
<<<

* I can see that! It shows up strongly in your wiki.
** I'd like to think it shows up in mine as well. 

* Classic problems in identity and metaphysics, and on top of it, our own human and personal experiences.
** We aren't going to solve this one cleanly, imho, since there are too many [[infinigress]]es. There are bullets to bite here.

* Given that you have such a fantastic collection of journals, I think you so well positioned to reason about this.
** With such a unique corpus, I hope this issue becomes one of the key philosophical concerns you develop for yourself and others.
** I hope you start all the way at the beginning, and just digest it. I don't know what or if conclusions can be drawn. 
** I don't know if it is something you will make public, but maybe it will be something you stagger or mull around before releasing.

<<<
Oh, and of course, travel brings [[Placeness|https://sphygm.us/#Placeness]] to the forefront of my mind. I'm always a little nostalgic for public transit and it gets even stronger after spending some time in a place with subways.<<footnote "bs" "I'm really bad at using buses, though. I never got on a single bus when I studied abroad in Paris, and not in San Fran either. I was pretty competent/comfortable with them in Chicago, but that's because I had one of those tap & go cards -- it always seems like a hassle to figure out how to pay for buses when traveling, and their routes seem less straightforward than trains (whether or not that's actually true).">>
<<<

* Every time I see that word, I think of Heidegger. Seems like he's exceptionally worth your time.
** I have lots of disagreements with him, and I bet you would too. Still, he provides some vocabulary to use, or at least to make your distinctions with.

* Geo-caching, modding in Skyrim, metrophilia, embodiment
** I look forward to meeting you in person someday. =). No rush. I'm sure it will be perfectly awkward! Lol.

* Spatial reasoning, memory being tied to landmarks.
** Also, reminds me of the wiki a ton.

* I have so little practice using public transportation. I've generally had a guide to help me the first time in a given location.
** It's anxiety-inducing for me usually, but I've generally had a serious timetable I have to keep to watch my offspring.

<<<
Part of me is really attached to the idea of knowing a place well -- I want to observe the intricacies of how all the moving (slow and fast) parts come together, and to form some sort of instinctual gut knowledge that comes through time and immersion. I don't think I'd actually let that get in the way of moving if moving was something I really wanted to do, but idk.
<<<

* Desire for predictability in the chaos for me.

* Bottom-up reasoning. I'm definitely curious about your ability to pay attention to so much detail.

* Train enthusiasts. There's something gorgeous.

* I lack roots, but I appreciate the value of what it means to have them to some extent. 
** A problem in globalization, the personal costs of mobility, nomadism. 

<<<
Still, I was really emotional at leaving -- there's things about cities that feel really good and that make me wish I lived in them. Like: I prefer the bustle of a really crowded city center to a smaller city center with much, much less foot traffic. I feel less exposed, and more able to just be as much me as I can -- there's so many people around that any strangeness on my part in terms of actions or dress or anything just blends in with the overall range of strangeness in cities. And I prefer the diversity -- being around so many different ways of living makes the more homogeneous places seem boring and uninteresting.
<<<

* People-watching.

* My brother, [[JRE]], is also someone who adores the city.
** Though, I think it's different in your case. It's not the access to amenities of urban living.

* I respect the vulnerability of exposure. I think your alienness is cool AF, but I consider myself lucky to meet those who are aliens in a way.
** I'm sorry that you have probably experienced non-trivial pain and injustice in how your appearances have been evaluated by others.
** Being online seems similar enough in some respects.
** My image of you must be wrong, of course. I can see you finding the safe nooks in the forest which no one will ever see. 

<<<
> I appreciate that you dig for it.

Ohhh man I feel so self-centered searching for myself on your wiki but I'm also super curious so I do it anyway!
<<<

* Lol! =). I have no idea how else you can map yourself onto the wiki without footholds, including searching for yourself.
** I wish more people would search for themselves on my wiki. 
** I wish I knew how to make this simpler, easier, more useful. 
*** Perhaps client-side notifications make more sense. 
*** I don't know how to pick out what matters to someone else well enough.
**** Also, the wiki is too damn big, lol! Search is the only option.

<<<
I wonder what a "highlight reel" would look like? It seems to me like that's almost your rootier tiddlers anyway -- the ones with the most effort and time and writing devoted to them, yes? And then you also have to decide what is most interesting or important for you to highlight when that could quite possibly vary from what other people think are most interesting or important by a wide margin.<<footnote "UGH" "oh my god I've been sitting outside writing this letter for about a half hour and I already have 2 bug bites on my foot?!!! what the fuck is this nonsense, I haven't had any mosquito bites all season until now. :C">>
<<<

* I'm still thinking about it. I don't want to write for the wrong reasons. Highlight for whom? [[gfwiwcgws]]. 
** I [[hope]] to articulate a systematic take in philosophy, one which is also integrated into my everydayness. 
*** Some of the work in here could be rolled out into papers, but I don't intend to join academia again (despite a lot of people saying I should).
** Yeah, [[Root]] with the [[APFVD]] structure with no orphans (okay, currently there are some) does say something worth highlighting. Reducing or antipleonasmifying is very hard to do well, [[WINTCIS]].
** [[Leet]] and the sidebar will hopefully grow more of this. 

* This question is definitely related to [[2019.12.25 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Massive Highly-Interlinked]]. 

<<<
> I've slowed down recently on that log, the hoarded buildup is getting worse, lol.

You're a link dragon! Stockpiling your hoard of shiny tabs in the cave of Firefox's RAM usage. :D
<<<

* Added to [[Link Log]]. Yeah, I'm collecting all the shiny things, lol. =)
* I've enjoyed watching your links treasures build up in your wiki too. 

<<<
I'm so glad to have inspired your dynamic wiki experimentation -- and I'm glad that it's fun!
<<<

* Not that I've solved it yet. I keep waffling on the same things (lawdy).
* Ah, more than that too. I've greatly enjoyed watching your wiki evolve. You are far more skilled in making it yours, and it's beautifully customized. I'm convinced that won't be something I can achieve, but your work is an inspiration.

<<<
Locator seems interesting -- I'm not sure I understand how it works, but I haven't used it a lot either.
<<<

* Worth your time! I hope you spend an evening trying it out. 
* As you've considered several times, it's difficult to gauge the value of visualization in the wiki. 
** I think it probably could be more valuable, but it requires more performance than we can milk from the tooling available.
** Locator is a surprising visualization to me. I think it's good for traversing the branches of our trees.
** Kin itself may be useful on its own too. 

<<<
Search of h0p3 definitely came in handy when I was searching myself, though, because I'd forgotten the filter text syntax, hah. And it's nifty to have it all in one spot there!
<<<

* Sadly, effort has halted on this one. We've not even had a prototype yet.

<<<
> I'll be interested to know if it is like riding a bicycle for you...

I'm not sure if this is an impulse you've ever felt, but after about 2 or 3 years of using my computers, I tend to get an itch to back up my files, delete everything, and start over with a fresh install. It was that same sort of urge I was feeling, coming back to my wiki. But, idk, I'm going forward without rebuilding it at the moment, and we'll see if I still feel that itch after spending more time in it going forward. I'd like to figure out how to evolve in place, rather than starting from scratch.

Btw - your web URLs are different when I click on tiddlers! It looks like they have link-like brackets in the actual URL? What's the story there?

> Does that go for both in your private use and public?

Yes, definitely, though slightly more for public writing than private. I don't feel it as much when I read old journals, say, but there's much more time and age difference there so I tend to approach them with gentle amusement.

I posit that it's easier to be vulnerable and open in meatspace or over voice chat than it is to be in writing, because of the more-or-less permanence of writing. Moments of vulnerability and openness can be emotionally overwhelming for me, and I go back to being less open/aware/grounded in my body in between those moments. I think that's a major part of my resistance to reading some of my own writing.

It seems this relates to the next part -- the fear of "performative" writing being a fear of vulnerability in a way that feels like an opening for mockery or denigration (regardless of whether or not that's a legitimate possibility).

Some wandering: performance holds connotations of rehearsal, recitation, editing, facades, and masks for me. Those connotations seem to be the opposite of "being oneself" or "authenticity" but -- I mean, if I am aware of my thoughts, and aware of my emotions, and aware of my awareness, and there is an open space where "I am that I am" is not collapsed into my emotions, or my thoughts, or my ego -- and if "authenticity" is synonymous with "acting from thoughts/emotions without being aware of them" then it seems authenticity is not what I want to strive for. So in a sense, performance is merely having the freedom of choice in how to act, separately from thoughts and emotions.

> How's CollectScents going? Looks like you're deep into something fun.

I haven't touched it in a while -- it was my project while I was waiting to hear back from jobs, and during the last two weeks at the art store and my first weeks at the new job, I was really diving into Stardew Valley for the emotional comfort. I'm in the middle of refactoring my query code for CollectScents, which I feel uncertain about, but which also has to get done before I start adding any new systems (like users and user data).

I also think the question of "is this just fun project for me or am I going try and launch it as an actual thing for other people to use?" is getting in my way. Some hard-core imposter syndrome worries setting in about it not being "good enough" to be released or that it's got messy code and is just hacked together blah blah. Which, true, I'm much less skilled than anyone who's been writing code for their day job for the past X number of years, and I'm sure there's a lot of code smells, but I gotta learn to walk before I can learn to drive and there's lots of falling over when you learn to walk, right?!

That aside, I'm super into Neo4j as a database -- makes the data modelling much easier than with a relational database -- and Bootstrap has actually been really great for quickly prototyping a decent looking website (though it's pretty different than doing all the CSS by hand).

TV shows, hm -- well, I can't find any results for //Killing Eve// or //Fleabag// in your wiki, so I will highly recommend those. Phoebe Waller-Bridge also was involved with //Crashing//<<footnote "C4" "not the American comedy show, but the British Channel 4 show">>, which isn't quite on the same level as the other two but I still very much enjoyed it. //Dark// is also phenomenal, and //The Handmaid's Tale//, though so far I enjoyed the first two seasons of that more than I've been enjoying the 3rd season. //Chernobyl// was fascinating! Oh, and while //Legion//'s story is good but not great, the visual design and cinematography is out of this world -- insanely well done and gorgeous. Have you seen //Hannibal//?

OH and omg, k0sh3k, so much congratulations on your interview with Yale!! I'm sending all my best thoughts and encouragement your way and I hope it goes well!

Finally -- and maybe this is a case where even asking the question changes the answer -- does my writing seem different to you in this letter? It does to me, but I can't quite put my finger on why or how or where.

Hugs to everyone from me!

Dear h0p3,

It is good to read your wiki! I was amused by the //Calendar// tiddler appearing today, when I just deleted my own tiddler that was meant to serve a similar purpose. I love my wiki, but trying to do time management in it just didn't work for me -- I hope it goes more successfully for you!

> I'll be interested to know if it is like riding a bicycle for you (assuming that plays any role), and insofar as it is still not a second skin after that, I'd like to know if you will be reaching for another second skin.

I'm not sure changing the color palette and other general styling of my wiki is exactly //substantial// work, but it feels like it was a good way to get comfortable again in my wiki -- like, relearning the controls in a video game after stepping away for a while. --- plus, I appreciate the spark of fun that really embracing the【﻿Ｏ　Ｕ　Ｔ　Ｒ　Ｕ　Ｎ】𝒶єŞŦ𝒽𝐞т𝕚ς has brought for me.

I'm definitely back on the //wiki review// and //carpe diem// horse again, knock on wood. My wiki reviews have almost become essays recently, which is interesting -- multi-paragraph long nested bullet points and so forth. 

> It's not a mere performance to me, but I'm your audience and friend...I am interested to know how you are doing and what you're thinking!

So I mentioned in my last letter the QuestBridge conference in San Francisco I went to, and how that would probably be a letter all to itself. I want to preface this by saying ''thank you'', thank you, thank you. For listening and telling me you're listening. I don't think I've mentioned it before, but I'm the eldest of two and --

I've grown a lot, socially. I've grown a ''lot'' since being a junior high girl in a sweatshirt dress<<footnote "sew" "Take a sweatshirt and sew a long strip of flannel or other fabric around the bottom to get an article of clothing I wore a lot as a kid in fall & winter. I...wouldn't be caught dead in one now but they were comfortable and warm and I was already weird so I don't remembering thinking anything of it then.">> walking every school day afternoon to an 8th grade public art class with maybe 15 or 20 other students and feeling overwhelmed, shy, and intimidated.<<footnote "snk" "and super snarky in my head? and also checking people out? man -- I think about who I was then and I think quiet--shy--nerdy--dork but I really don't give myself enough credit for being spunky and passionate and interested and gutsy and opinionated, especially in my journals!">>

Sorry -- this is a letter to you but so much of writing ''to'' someone is about noticing what is important to me<<footnote "hp" "like -- when I'm writing to myself it's a feedback loop but when I'm writing //for// someone else it's new and I'm not just telling myself the same thing over and over. does that make sense?">> and so, for myself, I want to take out this footnote and highlight it really big:

!!! I really don't give myself enough credit for being spunky and passionate and interested and gutsy and opinionated, especially in my journals!

''Storytelling'', and telling the stories of ourselves, was the rough organizing theme in one of the conference's keynotes. The guy was the sort who usually gets chosen for these kinds of keynotes -- rough early life, goes to college, works for Google, goes into Investment Banking, blah blah. I'm sure there were several pithy points of advice woven into the keynote -- and he was successful at being a charismatic and gripping speaker -- but I think the rough organizational idea was more interesting than the speech itself. 

How do we tell ourselves the stories of our past? What language do we use? How does that shape our memories and how we view ourselves in the present -- and how does that affect the ''actions'' we take every day?

I had this moment of realization at the conference, as I was eating breakfast standing at a table with two other women: If a clone of me had walked into that room at that moment, she could have assumed that I was yet another person who already had friends and a group and interesting conversations and that she was the only person walking into the crowd with no one she already knew to eat with.

How many of the conversations happening around me did I assume, by default, were just people who already knew each other? And what disservice did I do to myself and other people through excluding myself by default because of that assumption?

I had an argument with my co-worker one Saturday, along the lines of "what makes art art?" A key part of his definition involved "communication with another person" and I was pushing back against that so hard.<<footnote "." "[[here|190302 – Carpe Diem: Chats!]], actually. self-note, sorry!">> I wanted to say that art is still art, even if the artist works for 2 months on a canvas & just hides it in their basement and keeps doing this for years and //never// shows anyone -- that artist's work is still valid, I wanted to shout!

But I think I was wrong.

I pushed back against that definition because I felt afraid of communication and wanting to say things out loud where one or many other people might hear. I felt afraid of even the possibility of having a voice louder than just a private journal page.

> There is only one way I get to know who I faithfully take to be you: you tell me who you are and keep performing with me in our play. That's online or offline.<<footnote "musik" "soundtrack for this letter: [[Stories We Tell Ourselves – Edie Brickell]]">>

hugs, sphygmus<<footnote "pps" "this is still  a draft -- I think? or one in a series of more letters.">><<footnote "." "'a) lots of people more eloquent than me have said these things about self-narrative. b) thank you for listening to me talk about it. c) anxiety spiral brain is triggered so I'm going to end this letter here!">>















* Bi-directional Parasocial Relationships
** Passivity, signaling, load balancing
** It's a good thing I can just listen. Responding can be extremely expensive (though sometimes it's just chill).
** We keep coming back to it, and that means there's something there: you know you don't have to apologize for how long it takes to respond, and yet we both do it, lol. Seems to be part of the concern. 
** Voting and instant impressions. I hate social media driven around them, and yet, they may serve a purpose. Not going to work for my [[RGM]] (unless we all host), but it might for yours.



* Wiki Review
** You have more threads that get weave over the course of several days. 
*** Comparing wrinkles on our toes here, but I want to know your thoughts on it.


* Sites
** It's cool to see you building a lot of different parts of your site. 
** You've been hunting and sifting through a bunch of other wikis and sites.

---

* Drafts 
** I have no idea what the hell this mess is. Lol.
*** I know, I know: it's only a draft. Literally, you can write anything you want and I know you aren't committing to it (which is a great thing!). Also, maybe I'm totally missing the point (cause I am a terrible interpreter, as you know), but you've been mulling around the idea in your drafts that you are "a blunt pair of scissors compared to a scalpel." (aside: I'm beginning to think talking about drafts out loud together is something I really like about letter writing in this slow way). It's the opposite to me! You have to be the most exacting of any person I get to speak with. Even if you wouldn't want to, I know you could cut me if you needed to, lol. You are the scalpel; I see precision, formality learned from appreciating uncertainty, and deeply-hedged hesitation in your moves. I think you'd have really let go and just let it rip in order to be blunt. That might not be the right way to go for you (I have no idea). If that's something you want, but don't feel comfortable with just yet: put it on the backburner. We have time! I hope one day, I'll be lucky enough to get a letter from you that roasts and razzes me.

** I'm like a toddler learning to stand with them. Cool as hell, and I don't understand the possibilities of them well enough.

* The visual art.
** The root image is perfect. Everything else starts falling into place for me. I can't do what you are doing (so I can't say I understand it well enough), but I think you should continue to push even harder in this direction.
*** Especially in your UI design, e.g. colorful semantics, use of various kinds of drawing, etc. Reminds me of mixing custom subreddit CSS showing up in the agglomerating home feed.
** I wish I kept my notebooks (well, and my trapperkeepers! :P)

* Stepping into the light.
** I see you more brightly than I did before (which is not to say I'm a skilled interpreter).
** Your work makes me wrestle with what I'm doing inside my own wiki and head a lot. I'm still learning to build my sandcastle by watching you build yours. 
*** It reminds me of learning Spanish. I'm beyond awful at learning languages, but I'm grateful for the opportunity. Speaking a tiny bit of Spanish has been useful in connecting with [[others]], but it also taught me to be meta about English too.
*** Aside: phrases I've heard so often in my life:
**** You live too much inside your own head.
**** Stop overthinking it.
**** You're just shuffling heaps of words around, splitting hairs, or playing semantics.
**** ...and that's why no one likes you! XD
** I will always be interested in why you join me in this activity. It's not something I am used to in life.

* Carpe Diem completeness
** Unified, enriched, highly descriptive, more than a skeleton. 
** Existential grinding. I see a lot of hard work in your wiki.
*** It's way more realtime and visceral in a way.
**** It's not like you don't have serious, rigorous analytical reasoning in your work, but it's also very personable. You make it easy and pleasant for your reader to step inside your world and feel it.
***** In contrast, I feel like I climb out of a person's screen (like the girl from //The Ring// in my case), but I do a poor job of inviting someone to climb into an enjoyable version of mine (at best, inducing what may be a repulsive and disorienting mind-prison [[phenomenology]] in my case); you seem to have both skills without incurring drawbacks like mine.
****** Though, I cannot say I'm effective at stepping into anyone's shoes! I'm the worst kind of empathizer in that I map the differences of standing in your shoes onto my own so literally that it's obtuse, I'm never immersive enough.

* Crucial empathy question. Yikes, like a nightmare test for an autist to take. I give you my impression, and I doubt its thoughtfulness. I am a very poor modeler, and at best, there are only certain classes of things I effectively generalize about. With that disclaimer, I think I see some differences. 
** You seem happier or more content to me.
*** Maybe you are jumping more headfirst into life. 
** You've embraced decoration more. It pops.
** Boldness and growing more comfortable in your skin. 
*** I'm not going to call it swagger (because I actually think you are obviously humble and filled with doubt<<ref "d">>), but there's a shimmer there which I adore.
**** Obviously, I'm an insane person on this front.
** Accepting the risk or a willingness to be disliked, alone. 
*** Wrestling with what it means for others to think about your wiki and you. I'm grateful to have the chance to see your point of view here. What you think about is important, and I think you are proving that to yourself.
** I think you are wisely wrestling with whose approval you seek. I'd argue you're taking your own approval more seriously in the way you tell yourself and others the stories of you who are. 
*** There is a hard ethical problem in it, since [[The Golden Rule]] requires some version of seeking the approval of others at our own expense. The lines are expensive to draw wisely.
*** I know some people do not like the claim that, to some significant [[dok]], we are the stories we tell ourselves. It sounds romantic at first, but there's something skeptical about it in the analytic tradition.
** You seem to more effectively handle thoughts and doubts which bubble up about how important even the little things and perhaps even mundane aspects of your life (by common standards) are in your writing. 
*** Of course, I am a huge fan of the little and mundane things, some of which are actually lightswitches, hardly frivolous doodads, and authenticating deets. Your nesting and footnotes do a fuckton of work for you. I think you savor life with it.
**** I don't know where your wiki is going, but I hope you will always maintain at least a pillar (if not fundamentally the skeleton) of gunky, fluid, pseudo-rambly elements of stream-of-conscious writing.
** In exploring and defining yourself, I think you are defining your friends and family. Your relationship to otherness in and around you is an inescapable feature of your writing.

* You may cringe at me or worse here. I'm sorry. Perfectly awkward autist reporting for duty. `/salute`. I'm thinking //About://[[You|Sphygmus]]. This may be completely irrelevant, old hat, not worth your time, delusional projection, pathetic of me, horrifyingly overly-paternalistic, or worse. As always, you must pick the threads with me.
** Your revelation of a significant portion of your wiki helps me understand you and us more clearly. I'm exceptionally grateful for your honesty. I believe I owe you an important explanation and door for you to correct me on what I see as part of the mile-high view of our shared reality bouncing-board map-bridge we are building together.
** You are a sister to me. I don't mean this in a [[cult]]ic sense. It's a fair assessment of what family means to me. Sure, our relationship is mediated almost entirely via our [[hyperconversation]], a complex problem, but it's real to me.  
*** In selecting who I ought to be, given what I understand about who I am, I often don't know how to be or become the best interlocutor for you (which you obviously know). I am not always the most useful peer (and I leave it up to you to determine how much of an understatement that is).
** Maybe I'm stupid, unfair, or wrong for it, but I see fragments, opposing poles, my [[hopes]] for, and semblances of my daughter in you (and to some [[dok]], you in her), so strongly often enough. 
*** That is not on purpose, and I don't sufficiently know what I'm supposed to make of it either, but it's clear I see (very poorly and sometimes foolishly, I am sure) variations of elements of my daughter embedded in many people I meet in the desert. Examples include:
**** I don't think I model you nearly as effectively as you model me. You effectively speak, interpret, and translate my rigid autistic gibberish, including my especially religious and hairsplitting dialect, even realtime. You make inferences which demonstrate you are filling in the gaps in our conversation train often, you are absurdly patient with me, and I think that means you are an especially empathic listener. 
***** As is the case for my daughter. 
**** You are especially concerned with and able to lose yourself in computers, games, art, making things, philosophy, and narrative. 
***** As is the case for my daughter, intensely. I consider it a gift and a curse, lol.
**** I don't see you this way, but I'm an inept and perhaps absolutely insane person here: to various [[dok]], you have seen yourself as socially awkward, and while that may be true in some contexts (and despite my biased mind-blindness), you seem like an adept reasoner about [[Humanity]] to me. 
***** As is the case for my daughter, to my profoundly [[fff]] knowledge.
**** You have at least one religious [[fff]] parent.
***** As does my daughter. Both of her parents are Nth-degreers on the matter.
**** You have several important people in your life who enjoy teaching, learning, and language
***** Which is true, but that is hardly to say my daughter has anyone effective enough at these practices in her life.
**** With non-trivial depth and self-reflection, you seem constructively caught between multiple cultures and maybe wrestling with vastly different epistemic worlds. You seem to have more than the usual to make sense of in your perception of the world. I think you handle it more gracefully than I do too.
***** As is the case for my daughter.

*** All that said, now for the extra awkward part, this is what I say to my offspring (paging /u/[[j3d1h]] and /u/[[1uxb0x]]), and this is what I'm going to say to you, likely out of turn or place, perhaps absurdly, and at least partially (if not completely) irrelevant to you in some sense:
**** I aim for you to, openly or privately, and to various [[dok]]: balance the equation of seeking my approval, effortlessly ignoring it, or sometimes even profoundly disapproving of me [[irwartfrr]].<<ref "y">> I am not a good teacher of this problem, but I am often a poor student of it. 
***** It's not fun to wrestle with your old man. It's exhausting even.
**** I do not effectively know how to [[be a good dad|Be A Good Dad]] to or for you. Since we are in a principle-agent and creator/creation relationship, I owe you a fuckton, especially if you charge interest in the calculation, and as you know, I get and am going to get it terribly wrong all the time.
**** You are exceptionally charitable to me, and that's precisely why you must radically doubt me too, and I can't draw those lines safely for you. Only you can. That will not always be fun for either of us, but it's necessary for your autonomy.
***** One of your skills is that you know how and when not to disagree with me too well, and while sometimes that's a good thing, I can't say that's always a good thing for you. Surely, with mixed feelings, you have to agree I'm an asshole in a bunch of situations, and it's up to you to determine justice as fairness with me here.
***** Fundamentally, you will also need to determine both qualitatively (narratively) and quantitatively (game-theoretically) the [[dok]] to which I am a bloodsucking dark-triadic vampire, parasite, or blight. I am not a holy man, even though I so often am convinced I am correct, so you're going to have to wrestle.
**** I think one of the [[T42T]] costs of your actively listening so vulnerably and closely to me is making sure I pay the same prices with you. I'm convinced I owe you not only my eyes and ears, but my voice and reach to some extent. I've said this before, and I want to say it again. Among the various other asymmetric claim rights on my personhood you have earned, including modification rights to this wiki, the right to force me to look at something for the sake of accountability, the right to call me an asshole (you do it all the time, and you need to), and the exhaustible right to silence me in dialectics, [[The Ol' Yeller Clause]] is yours to use at-will.
***** There are significant limits to the pain you should undergo to speak with me. Be fair to yourself.
**** One of the ways in which I've cursed you is by complexifying and setting such extraordinarily high standards (which I hypocritically fail to meet constantly) for how you connect the essentialist dots of you were with who you are and will be in how you tell yourself the stories of who you are in particular and in general.
***** It's not easy, but I am convinced it will be a rich and meaningful story.
**** I enjoy our [[hyperconversation]], but that doesn't mean I deserve to. It is my honor to be your father, and I love you.

* Fleabag
** OOoooo. Daammmn grill, this is insane. I'm going to need to watch it multiple times; it's striking. I am sorry that I am slow, but it may say something very important for us. I consider shared, in terms of both //like// and [[love]], mediums to be radical memetic bridges for price-efficient mindmelds. It is extremely rare that someone picks out a show for me this fucking cleanly. It's more mana than sugar to me, and I am fascinated by it.
** [[Identifying With Fictional Characters]]. This place is beyond-the-pale cringe, no doubt. How drawn are you to this story and to these characters?
** That constant 4th wall-breaking ever show up in your wiki?

* Carly Fleischmann
** Sometimes I feel like Carly Fleischmann with my wiki. 
** I am interested in how we match together in this respect, but I'm also interested in it as self-exploration here.
** I definitely connect with schizotypals in many cases. I'm curious about how my language game patterns and lenses can be as radically golden ruled as I can with what I consider to be my epistemic weakness: top-down modeling. I think it is my moral duty as an autist to attempt to hack my brain in this respect (as dumb as that sounds, or as hilariously impossible as it sounds, I recognize). I'm looking to become fittingly open, henotic, and clearing up my goggles [[irwartfrr]] as part of my strategy for wandering the desert. I am a bottom-up reasoner, so I've gotta work toward the other side, achieving what is [[faith]]fully an approach toward the golden epistemic mean.
** I'm still learning how to talk through my wiki. Sometimes, I am beyond awful at understanding the nature of [[hyperconversations]], and perhaps more generally new models tend to require more emergent kinds of reasoning which I'm super hit or absolutely strikeout miss on.
** Do you think my compulsive use of the wiki is dependence or addiction?

* Wikis and Herd Immunity
** Open trust-building exercises. 
** The Spanish Inquisition as Trolley Problem. Seeking the fitting between empirically-verified deontology and rationalist consequentialism.


* YO!

I feel like a latex balloon of a person, with all of this rubbish tossing and turning inside, and writing (my wiki) is like cutting a little hole and letting it out -- but only some of it.

I never want to write down the nasty things I think, the ones that I know would be hurtful to the people -- to someone -- close to me. I hate myself for thinking them. I don't know if they mean something ''real'' or if they're just manifestations of all of my own shit I haven't dealt with, that if I were a better person I wouldn't be feeling or thinking these things. 

I hate myself for bottling things up -- I feel like I'm just being my mother all over again. I can feel it -- the shutting down, the tensing up, keeping a wall up.

It's just -- I'm not sure I want to be that person. If you're the average of the 5 people around you most then -- I feel afraid that we're not building each other up healthily but that we're reinforcing our weaknesses and 

I want to do things with someone else. Do I want to do things with someone else? I feel that -- that striking out on my own is forever a coping mechanism. Yes, part of it is being self sufficient and strong and what have you but the other part is that I feel afraid I'll hate the other person and end up annoyed with them or disappointed, because I have to give up control over how things go.

: how fucked is it that I can only foresee two possible outcomes of, say, going on a weekend camping trip with another person: either we'd both do our own things or we'd try to do something together and it wouldn't be satisfying for either of us. Fuck, can't I even conceive of an experience that's more enjoyable with //collaboration together// than even doing one's own thing??

All I've ever wanted was for someone to be there and hold me while I cry with no expectation, no pressure -- oh my god I would be feeling so shut down and bottled up if they asked me to do the same, I think -- I don't handle others' sadness well I think -- but fuck it would be positive and healthy for me -- that would be a ''good thing'' to butt up against and deal with. 

Feeling into my body, the feelings I'm feeling are: tightness in my neck, tenseness in my shoulders, my teeth were chattering like the nutcracker for a second -- pressure in my temples -- just tightness and so much teeth chattering. I have to breathe wth my mouth wider open or they just go and go like those wind up toys.

What actions can I take to address these feelings? Request to talk. ''Stay connected to your body during'', notice when you might be retreating around a wall, ''pause'' and feel. Use "I feel" statements. I feel bad when it seems like our goals don't align, when who we are doesn't align. 

The teeth chatter is back.

Even just simple acknowledgement might help; I don't need total conversion. Because it can be comforting, sometimes, when I feel like the world is ending, to be next to someone so completely detached and confused (?) by that point of view, someone who isn't paranoid in ways. Being mirrors and echoing despair to infinity feels unhealthy in its own right.

Ack.<<ref "ack">> `/hug`

{{Text Art: I Love You||ASCII: 100%}}

Oh, my guts turn inside and out thinking about this pericope as well. I've been going to sleep and waking up still thinking about it. I'd rather just sit in silence on the matter. Fuck, I'm still freaking out a bit about how to respond to these echoing words.<<ref "yk">> I hesitate to even pointedly acknowledge all of the references and sequences in this rabbithole, which runs deep in many directions; it lights up a great deal for me on our bridgemap.<<ref "se">> Your words ooze into so much I see (and don't see) in your life. I don't want to interpret it out loud,<<ref "re">> especially because, even in [[love]], my deconstruction method is so profoundly violent and paranoic it can barely hold something so delicate, let alone in a gentle manner. I //have// to say something though, so I ask you to bear with my fumbling. I [[hope]] you can hear me in the same vein as you have written.

I feel this is perhaps the most expensive set of words you've ever written (even if it's not to me).<<ref "ys">>. I don't even know how to honor such a thing, even with your explicit instructions and given the significant anxieties embedded in it. Sometimes you give me gifts of tools which I cannot repay, and now you give us gifts of yourself. [[Sphygmus]], if that's not the light stepping out into the light, I don't know what is. I am grateful for your honest vulnerability. This is as much my narrow bridge of [[hope]] to fearlessly cross as it is yours.

OOPS, DRAFT!



[[Love]],
