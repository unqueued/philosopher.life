title: 2019.10.01 - Prompted Introspection: Nicomachean Ethics

!! What is your favorite book and why?

I've answered this before: [[2017.12.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Book]]. I'm going to move into a different realm here and talk about philosophy books. The Nicomachean Ethics is a work of art. I'm so indebted to it. There's no way you can interpret [[Saint Plato]] correctly without it, and it spawns the groundwork for so many major problems in moral philosophy. His systematic approach sets the bar incredibly high for everyone coming after him, and whether people realize it or not, they are responding to him. Walking through that book, arguing about it page by page with a trained philosopher over the course of a month or two should be something every person on the planet is required to do. 

Also, I write my wiki to my offspring, and this book has been an inspiration.
