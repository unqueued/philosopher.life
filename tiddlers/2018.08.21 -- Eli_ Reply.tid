Thank you for your considered response. You have not offended, and I do understand the value of this gift. Thank you for it.

In response to your insights I will offer this:

I love insects. [[I think they are beautiful and complicated|http://beetlequeen.com/]]. This being said, I have no desire to collect their bodies and preserve them. I do not pin them to boards and view them out of context.

I try not to begrudge those who do, but it isn't for me. The beauty of an insect is the individual in larger context, Ecosystem.

Noun or gerund. I hope for gerund.

Similarly, I believe an act of archiving can either be a force of integration or of separation. By drawing a circle around something do we merely call attention to it, or do we cut it out of its larger context?

Again, thank you for your considered response.

Curious misdirection. Avoids directly responding. Veiled, but appears to be a T42T failure.
