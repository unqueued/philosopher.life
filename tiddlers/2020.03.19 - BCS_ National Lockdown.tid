"""
[11:58 AM] h0p3: How's it going? (nothing to talk about here, just connecting)
[12:32 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Hey, I'm good
[12:32 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: officially in a national lockdown so looks like I may have some time to work on things
[12:32 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: and also preparing for an interview in a half hour or so
[12:32 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: and you?
[12:33 PM] h0p3: I hope that it will not be a difficult time for you in lockdown.
[12:33 PM] h0p3: And, I wish you luck on your interview.
[12:33 PM] h0p3: I'm homeschooling my offspring right now.
[12:34 PM] h0p3: We are safe, we have food, and we are watching the world.
[12:47 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Luckily I think I'll be fine, there's plenty of food and labor laws are fairly strong here so I don't expect layoffs in the short term
[12:48 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Thanks! I'll share with everyone once it's published
[12:48 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Stay safe out there as much as you can, unfortunately the worst is yet to come it seems
[12:49 PM] The Blockchain Socialist: Let me know if there's any way I can help
[4:54 PM] h0p3: Yeah, my prediction is grim too. I think we will be okay, and I appreciate your offer.
