title: 2020.01.16 - Prompted Introspection: Wish To Dive

!! I wish I could see?? because?..

[[2017.11.24 - Prompted Introspection Log: Wish to See]] is incorrect now. I want to see the gameplan for my life. {[[Dreams]]}, like so many places on my wiki, sits in shambles. One thing I'd like to credit you with, Lady Melisandre, is helping me see the futility in much of my desire. You force me to face my fantasies in an odd way. I think you help me narrow it down. 

There is a non-trivial chance that I will live in New Haven for the rest of my life. That's something to plan around. I can't see the forest of trees of decisions well enough. I wish I could see myself dive in anyway.
