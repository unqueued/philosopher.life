** Single dashes, for now, please. You may change them programmatically if and when the time comes.

** My goodness. Would you take a look at that kung-fu? You fucking monster! It's so gorgeously said. It's so right! It's good! Now, that is charity. I am so ready for you to read the //Nicomachean Ethics// and //The Republic//. You are going to beast out.
** "Absolutely" -- rofl! 
** "'Good' is always desirable, but still depends on the context," including the point of view. There is a privileged position, The Objective, and hence why it is always desirable in some manner or [[dok]]. The issue at stake here is that [[The Good]] must be unified in some sense, mapping. There is a context of all contexts, though it is very hard to talk about what that things means:
*** We will be split into a kind of incoherence or an incompleteness as the finite. Only [[The Infinite]] with respect to [[The Dialetheia]] could possibly resolve this problem (and, both point directly toward it).
** It's not just "real-time," part of the problem appears to be that we must scale our identities into many timeslices to answer the Ship of Theseus problem. There are [[infinigress]]es here.
** The sufficiently virtuous agent can tell you what to do to some [[dok]]. It's not like we can never model each other at all effectively enough to pick out the particulars of [[salience]] in their context. But, you are correct about pointing to the problems of particularism and contextualism so cleanly, the problems of rule-following, etc.
** Teleology is a hard problem. This is excellent work.
*[[2020/02/25 -- Prompted Introspection: Average Dream]]
** That is fascinating. I'm super jelly. I not only don't believe I dreams as cool as that, I don't think I'm even able to be aware of my states like that.
*[[2020/02/25 -- Life Log]]
** A fair worry. I'm thinking we'll try to watch it through another round, and I've picked up more linear algebra content for us. For now, I'm trying to just keep it fun.
*[[2020/02/25 -- Wiki Log]]
** Lol! I did find my way onto here. `/rawr`
*** I even get to write that curs-ed word in your wiki.
**** Cur Sed, I tell you.
*** I hope it will be something incredibly useful to you. 
*** Also, you are welcome. :P
** I want to see you engage what I wrote. You're gonna have to say something about [[h0p3's Review]] in your [[Wiki Review]]. Toss me a few bullet-points every now and then. I know it's so much easier to just say in person, but written proof matters in so many cases. 
** You may be sarcastic (and don't act like you weren't...terrible argument you just gave me in person: do you see the comment I'm responding to?). Good. Make it kick ass, tear all flesh so that it will be silent. You better be justified.
** I'd prefer you were more specific in your thoughts on the [[Yearly Cross-section]].
** I don't know if you are joking about cancel culture here. =)
** Neat. What hobby?
*[[2020/02/25 -- To-Do List Log]]
** "Mutuals" - That is a fascinating word, and it's worth inspecting many times.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I often forget that you worked on Rust. Pain in the ass for both of us. Glad we gave it a shot.
*** That ecosystem is very, very slowly coming together. In a minor way, I think that is good for you (even if I think it's terrible for the world).
*** Hard to find a job with it, but understanding it will likely be valuable in many contexts. 
*** If you do decide to specialize in CS (or even something adjacent), I think this is a place to study. 
**** Even if you never worked with computers again (I know not how nor why, and I don't want to), you are morally obligated to attempt to understand at a cursory level what's happening here (and many other places).
***** I say that knowing full well that almost no one does. I suggest I'm aware of how absurd this claim is.
** I am huge fan of this one: [[2018/02/26 -- Why I like to Make Characters]].
*** Sick work in here, homie.
** HoneyKetchup fluff? I think I'm going to puke. I have no idea what you are talking about either. :P
** "They Say / I Say" was a great book. I hope that you literature book will become like that for you.
*** We are way, way out of my league. This is your mother's bailiwick. She's a monster here. Please, learn from her. Take my weapons and take her flowstyle.
*** Look at yourself: your verbal intelligence is intimidating (and sometimes wasted unwisely). You should wrestle hard here. Push. Master it inside and out. You have been handed pieces very few children have ever had for this place and practice in the desert too (both genetically and environmentally). At the very least, it will be a source of competitive advantage in markets, but you and I both know it's far more than that.
** I miss your hyper reading logs.
*** Commentary is strong. Love it. It's expensive, of course.
*** I know you search all the time. Why not? 
**** Don't even write about it. Just build collections of links.
****  I'd be honored to just open the world from your point of view.
*** At the very least, if you are going to break the rules, don't break all of them once. If you are going to use the internet to screw around, show your work.
** We took a giant break from math. I'm glad we are starting up again in a place that is fun. 
*** Eventually, we have to get to writing proofs out. It is one thing to be able to follow the conversation at [[FO]] level, and another to be able to write at that level, especially since you'll need both to begin [[SO]] meaningfully. Being able to have an intuitive and well-worn path to "why" is ridiculously hard.
** It's a pleasant read today. I'm grateful for your hardwork. I know it must be ridiculously unfun to be thrown into pools this fucking deep.
