!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** You are doing a good job of building friendships and dealing with (and thinking through) your conflicts. It's important to reach out to people, and I'm proud of you. We know it hurts sometimes and that it isn't easy, but it is a good thing to do.
** You did a better job on meltdowns. You did your best to stay calm and level-headed.
** You had a moment this week when talking with me where you didn't want to end the conversation. You asked to speak longer with me. That made me feel really good, and I'm glad you enjoyed talking with me at that moment. That's what friendships are made of.
* j3d1h
** You did better on your school work this week. I really appreciate you starting to value and take yourself more seriously. It's a wise move.
** You've been trying to play outside more. That's good for your health. Also, you made a youtube minecraft video. You followed through on your plan and commitment. Good job.
** Today, when you asked Jacob his name, despite not knowing his name, you were okay with the awkwardness and overcoming it. That takes guts. Good job.
* k0sh3k
** I know you don't feel like you are good with money, but I've seen you grow a ton when it comes to financial responsibility. You really do plan ahead, sacrifice for us, and pass the marshmallow test as a mother and wife. I'm really thankful that you've taken the time and energy to become a financially responsible person. Thank you for forgiving my many mistakes in this respect as well; you've been gracious to me when I've failed us in this respect. I hope I can pay it back to you.
** It's nice that you take the time to make treats for your dad's friends and acquaintances. 
** You taught me how to make coffee. Thank you.
* h0p3
** Thank you for paying attention to our wikis and caring about what happened during our week.
** Thank you for being kinder than you usually are this weekend.
** Thank you for making your weekends about your family. A lot of guys in your position don't do that.
