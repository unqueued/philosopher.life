*** This only exacerbates never being able to behold the thing in itself. We only have broken access to the stories we tell ourselves about the appearance of the thing.

** https://news.ncsu.edu/2018/03/free-will-review-2018/
*** I'm starting to care less about the problem. I hold people accountable, and I'm not going to worry about why as much. It's kind of refreshing.

*** He had a lot to gain from Russia. It must be even worse than I imagined if he has done this.

*** Often, I feel the same contradictory pull in myself.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/go-vote.html?
*** Institute Ranged Voting, and I will never miss the opportunity. FPTP is game-theoretically unsound to the point that it really doesn't make a difference. My vote is useless either way, especially in the electoral college system. Dismiss me all you want. I will vote when I believe it actually adds up to something. For the record, I did vote in the primaries, and I did so knowing full well that the DNC would never allow Sanders to take the reigns.

*** Look, this is Vice. I actually don't think people should be giving birth, but I do think we a moral responsibility to take care of the children that already exist in the world. There are, of course, people who simply cannot. But, I think there are also a non-trivial number of people who elect to be childless not out of necessity but simply out of self-interest. I do have a problem with those people.
