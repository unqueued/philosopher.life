I drove 3.5 hours to Chattanooga. I had to wander since it was locked down. They even thought I was an intruder. They have actual security for that building. I take that to be a very odd sign. In any case, as soon as I got in and asked for an application, they told me I'd need my highschool transcript. I said I didn't have my transcripts with me. They said I couldn't apply without them. This is weird, and it is part of the corporate policy mixed with government regulations. Normally, application procedures which require transcripts give you time and even allow you to space out the application process into chunks.

They said I couldn't take the application home and that I couldn't fill it out. I tried calling my wife and schools I've attended. None could help me in the time period I had. I was annoyed since I had traveled a long distance and brought what I thought necessary. Clearly, they do not have their heads on straight enough to explain the requirements (Keaton also showed up randomly after I did and also didn't bring what he needed). This is a bad sign.

I talked to Jeff, the training coordinator. He gives me the psychopathic heebie-jeebies. He's almost proud of it. He has the idealogical traits and behavioral markers for it. It felt slimy (and this isn't just my jaded unhappiness over the application, but even when I heard him speak the first time and met him back home). He talked with the board to see if they could change the policy for me, especially since I don't have high school transcripts. Apparently, they wouldn't take any transcripts from my decade of post-secondary education. It was high school or nothing. I had to convince Jeff, gently, that my education was at least at a high school level, lol. He then acted like he solved my problem, but didn't and tried to send me on my way. He doesn't sound like the kind of boss I want to work with, and the people are not good people (I met several [some of the second time]). 

That said, I was given a tour of the facility after requesting it (which was part of the reason I was there). The facility is amazing. Business in booming in that area. Growth exists. I could make a living there. I could learn anything and everything in the trade. They have millions and millions of dollars of equipment there, including welding robots, to learn on. They might be terrible people, but I could strongly benefit from them. In contrast, the local union is more like drunk incompetence. I fear I wouldn't learn what I really need there.

Anyways, as I was leaving, I saw Keaton. We were surprised to see each other. If I do move down there, perhaps I'll room with Keaton (assuming he goes that direction as well). We're planning to come back down together on the 28th, I believe, for the tests I needed to take. Basically, little of what I told was going to happen when I arrived actually occurred, and not without my prodding.

In any case, I left, hit a gas station. Their pump didn't work, so I found another one. About 20 minutes onto I-75N I got a flat. Luckily, I noticed something was off immediately (you only have seconds) and started slowing down (my bucket'o'bolts is barely holding it together; I am truly blessed that my car has lasted as long as it has given the $1.8k we paid for it). Anyways, the tired broke oddly (disconcerting). I put the donut on the car, and I called my insurer for the nearest tire change service center. As I was driving there, they told me they had my tire in stock, but that a tornado had recently destroyed their shop. My directions were wrong. So, they guided me over the phone to their location. I got there, they took my car, and then they discovered they didn't have my tire. They kindly made 2 phone calls, but no one had my tire size. So, they said my best chance was to try Wal-mart. So, I went to Wal-mart. 

Wal-mart took forever at every stage. They said they had the tire, but it took 20 minutes of searching. Eventually, I joined in searching with them. It then took 2.5 hours for them to change the tired (I was 3rd in the queue). It was very late when I got home. It was not the best of days. I will not give up though.
