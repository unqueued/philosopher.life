!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

Fairly good. Still sleeping well enough, but I wake up a lot. I'm not tired though, so this might just be a normal aging thing. I'm feeling the need to stuff my face with food. That's not the behavior I ought to engage in.

My routine is fairly standard. Going back to school/work gives me an excellent reason to wake up in the morning. I have much to do with my day. I like that feeling of having thing to do (and wanting to do them) throughout my days. I take that to be a good sign.

!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

The car didn't start. Again. I feel like it's farce. I also feel like I'm better prepared this time, slightly. The car is charging as we speak. I traded back the old (brand new) charger that didn't work (since I tested it, just in case we would need it, and it failed). The new one is analog, and it works.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

If I understood the technological problem, we wouldn't be having one. Lol. I think of the problem as being about lacking money to progress and replace this vehicle. I can't have a bad attitude about the vehicle; it has served us so well. I'm incredibly grateful to have it. It is easily my favorite car of all time, however beatup and shabby this officially antique aged car may be. It has done the job, and performed well above what we could ever expect. Let me reiterate again, I am so grateful to have this car. It's been a blessing.

Living in a society where this is common, well...that's the fundamental problem. Not much I can do about that either. 

Stoicism, friend. That is the answer.

(So, the tactic is to reframe and continually reframe the problem as necessary).

!! What are you going to do about what happened?

I'm charging it. I'll count my blessings. I'll work on that dryer while I'm waiting, eh? Lol. 

As to eating, I think I should stop eating later in the evening. Alternatively, a replacement snack, fruits and vegetables only, might be acceptable. That's when I prefer my beer, unfortunately. I do use it as a drug to relax.
