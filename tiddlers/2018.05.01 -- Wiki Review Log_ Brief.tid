* [[2018.04.30 -- Deep Reading Log: A History of Western Philosophy]]
** I wish I had a better way to stop and taking notes. It's close to viable, but not yet on the phone while I'm driving. Voice commands, unfortunately, include costs I don't wish to pay.
* [[2018.04.30 -- Link Log: Morning Go]]
** Not much there, but that's okay. It will probably die down quite a bit now that I'm on the job.
