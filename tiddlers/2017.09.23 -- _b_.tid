Belief in altruism is faith. All the evidence points towards egoism. It makes evoluntary sense.

Of course, even in moral psychology, your professor is too horrified by the thought to accept it. We simply must call such a theory //ad hoc// and dismiss it. Of course, we have our rationalized intuitions and phenomenological perspective which "shows us" that we personally have been altruistic. 

AH HA! But, we can easily be wrong about what motivates us. People all too often are wrong on this account. People really shouldn't trust themselves as much as they do.

The bitch of the thing is that I aspire to do the impossible, to be the impossible: to actually, fundamentally be altruistic and happy.

What does it mean on a fundamental scale to be altruistic?

Here is why slacking at work isn't theft: they are trying to take you for everything you are worth. They aren't trying to fairly pay for your labor, so why should you try to give them your absolute 100% effort? What, because you promised? What real choice did you have? You have to eat. What's their excuse? They need another yacht?

The more I get to know a person, the less I like them. With vanishingly few exceptions, I eventually find character traits, patterns, and malicious ignorance in the people I learn about. Granted, no one is perfect. But, a man has to draw his lines somewhere. It's the only practical thing to do.

Would you be friends with Hitler? Why not? So, how should that line be drawn, and why is your line-drawing principle more rational and moral than mine?

Maybe I need a redpill log?

I do have faith in myself. I have to have hope. Is this faith in altruism? Probably. This contradiction leads to serious cognitive dissonance.

Why am I allowed to have it in myself and those I have cherrpicked but not others? That is clearly a violation of alethic reasoning. 

Alethically, I should not have belief in altruistic behavior in humans. But, I do anyways. obivously, the only justification I ahve left to offer is pragmatic, prudential reasoning. The ned of my family's happiness is higher to me than the alethic truth. That is a rare move for me, and it lacks integrity. Such is my plight.

Why not extend this belief in altruism to everyone? It isn't prudent and it isn't alethic. What other reasons could I possibly give? The purple pilled metamodern one? What does it even look like in this case? What motivates it?

I find that people rarely reciprocate questions with me. They aren't interested in me in the way I am in them.

Fidget spinners, cubes, and toys are part of an old class of toys. See worrystones and prayer beads.

Corporately sponsored school programs exist to ease the scarcity of particular functions. It is cheaper to barely educate an extreme specialty externally which locks its participants into a climb up the ladder of starvation than to develop well-rounded, free as in //liber//, citizens with choices who are paid full value for their labor.

I find empathizing with your malicious ignorance to be painful. You inspire hatred. Humanity is its own selfish adversary.

---

Fierce integrity, that's how I want to be constituted.

---

I seek to be/live independently of the evils of humanity. I can't stop it, but at least I can avoid participating in it.

---

We simply cannot avoid being paid by evil people to do things which become tainted since these things ultiamtely are used for evil purposes. Is there moral employment left (if there ever was any)?

One nice thing about the trades is that you learn on the job. otherwise, I wouldn't ahve the motivation or will power to do so.
