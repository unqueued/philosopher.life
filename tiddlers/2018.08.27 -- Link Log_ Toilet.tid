*** Despite considering it for many years, I'm having a hard time getting over what it means for videos to be simulated at this level. Trust was always problem (it's easy to make video or the lack thereof lie).

*** The Black Cloud Manifesto isn't written by someone who is stable, and that's fine with me. I'm listening, sir.

* Think About It

*** Have you seen the state of the world today? Lol. I agree, it's abusable. IQ and motivational gains generally come back within 3 days, so I don't think it's permanent effects are so bad, except for the consequences derived during use itself. Let me also point out that it has plenty of positive effects. It's like computers or anything that is a double-edged sword.

*** Of course, there are other ways to pay for this, asshole. You didn't even try to look at it. You just assume capitalism is the way to go.
** https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/08/crap-sandwich-a-sneaky-ill-conceived-managerial-technique-for-giving-negative-feedback.html
*** I think negative feedback from someone who legitimately cares about you as a person can be couched in a way that isn't bullshit. The problem is that it becomes apparent that they are just there to manipulate you.

** https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/what-trumps-supporters-think-of-corruption/568147/
*** I think they will do anything to maintain the neoliberal PoV here. Yes, this may be partially true, but the desire to prevent the decentralization of power (i.e. socialism) is really what sits behind this kind of piece, imho.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/opinion/happiness-inequality-prosperity-.html
*** Look, I regularly argue the value of status as it is standardly understood. The problem here is that they've conflated power with mere status. This is some neo'libral bullshit, homie.
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17831226
*** It's like they've sidestepped the problem. Fine, I can't point to some difference between Dividends and Buybacks in important ways. The transfer of wealth, however, is still there, assholes.
