title: 2018.06.17 -- AIR: Call

I had called my brother at around 11. He was at work, so he couldn't pick up. 15 minutes later, he called me from the bathroom (from I can tell in the voicemail), but I couldn't answer it. He said we'd talk at 10:30ish. I texted him saying that would be great.

I waited until about 11:30 before I called him. He was driving and couldn't respond (which is odd because that's usually fine). He called me back 15 minutes later at the house and said he was too exhausted to talk. He clearly had a very long day at work, and I felt bad for him. I hope we get to talk sometime.
