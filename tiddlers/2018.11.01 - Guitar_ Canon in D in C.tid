title: 2018.11.01 - Guitar: Canon in D in C

My son and I practiced //Minuet in G//. We played with more force today. It was very pleasant, and even my son was pleased with it. We decided to try another song. I rustled my way through a few until we happened upon Canon in D (arranged in C, unless we capo, but I like the deep sound on the guitar). My son had to learn a couple new chords to play with me. This one is going to require some serious time to hit full speed. It's already sounding non-trivially decent.

I finally played with my daughter. She has the first half of the first/easy version of the song set. I ended up playing the piece for her on banjo to help her see some of the fingering problems and hear the flow. She's gonna have to really work hard to get that song up to speed and feeling right. We sound good together, and it was fun.

The skin on my fingers is shredding off. I think it's because we took a break. Thankfully, it's a pleasant pain, almost numbing.

I'm playing up to speed more effectively, with more feeling, without having to reason about it so much, blindly, and my sight-reading skill is coming back. I feel like a decent beginner again.

My son and I practiced Rock of Brae together. We had to figure out and mark chords for him. This will be a growing process for both of us. I want him to start building custom strumming patterns per measure, placing chords where they feel right, etc. I want him to see what it means for him to accompany.
