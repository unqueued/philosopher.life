** I find that I have difficulty writing in the wiki (high or sober) while working this job. I need to find ways to write more while at work, and not just recording in my notebook. I need to make it easy to type. I'm still just not fast enough on my android keyboard (I don't think I can be; very hard type 100wpm on that screen). It's important that I get stuff done on my breaks, while I still have the energy for it. By the end of work, I sometimes don't have much of anything left in the gas tank. Save that time for your family as much as you can.
