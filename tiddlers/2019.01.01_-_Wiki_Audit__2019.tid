title: 2019.01.01 - Wiki Audit: 2019

Today, I engage in what I hope will be a new tradition: [[Retired]] snapshots of each [[Directory]]. I'm not cloning, and I'm not keeping [[Alias]]es or tags. I'm keeping the complete title and body. I need to complete my [[Monthly Audit]] first. I need to make sure I've hardcoded everything I care about in these as well.

Last year, my [[Log Audit]]s for the year required me to read everything. That was an extremely unfun process. With [[The Remodeling]] I don't have to worry about it (I'm doing 2018 this year ;P [I'm still not sure what I'm going to do with 2019 content in 2019...it's debatable]). I'm just going to read the [[Monthly Audit]]s themselves! ROFL.

So, [[Monthly Audit]], [[Directory]] retirement snapshot,<<ref "h">> Yearly audit. This is going to be a slow process today, lol.

It's incredibly satisfying to do the yearly audit of my [[Monthly Auditable]]s. Some of these logs are themselves short little books. I'd have a skein notebook for each of them. The amount of lifting required to get that thing onto my personal library shelf has been absurd. [[Sphygmus]] is correct: there is a lot of journal work in here. That journ~~al~~ey is part of writing the letter of {[[About]]} to myself; it just takes a really long time. The yearly audits in //Vault:// are my doorways, and they have huge branches behind them. It's weird to see how much content sits behind [[2018 - /b/]]; most links just don't have that much sitting behind them. It's a weird feeling, but a satisfying one.

I shouldn't call them snapshots. That //keyword// is already chosen for my daily snapshots of the entire wiki. What about "retireshots?"

The [[Monthly Auditable]]s are not finished yet. I think I made good progress. I'm grateful to have set out the work I wanted to accomplish in advance. I obviously fucked around too much today.

Thus far, I've completed:

* [[/b/]]
* [[Afterschool Teaching]]
* [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]
* [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]
* [[Computer Musings]]
* [[Family Log]]
* [[Link Log]]
* [[Prompted Introspection]]
* [[TDL]]
