title: 2017.11.20 -- Carpe Diem Log: Drunk

* Woke at 9:45, still arguing with myself in my sleep.
* We cleaned the house until 4ish, with a small break for Archer
* D2
* Talked to JRE.
** He won't be coming for Thanksgiving. He is on call to receive a foster child and doesn't want to leave R alone for it. I told him I'd do the same thing in his shoes.
* Read+Write
* Archer
* Burgers
* Got drunk
* Talked to AIR
** Still trying to get XMPP up and running with him.
* Mouse problems, but figured out it was my second mouse connected (I'm still on the fence about the vertical mouse, but I love it in many ways).
* Up till midnight/1ish.
