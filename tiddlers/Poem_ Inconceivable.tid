title: Poem: Inconceivable

```
Anchor yourself to the first island you find.
Take the EZ Road to Convenience.
Keep only the pictures which confirm what you wanted to see.

Desperately cling to dreams you've already paid for.
Double-down when you know you've lost the bet.
Reinforce your view of reality at any cost.

Be certain whenever you are confident.
Find no flaws in what attracts you.
Favor your tribe above all others.

Fade memories until they appear grander than the present and future.
Personalize vague statements to fit your needs.
Have faith in your cure, and it will work.

Presume justice where there is none.
Agree with those who have power over you.
Your knowledge should be obvious to everyone, right?

Judge others by their character, but yourself by your context.
Take responsibility for your success, but never your failure.
Never doubt yourself: you're perfect.

Being wrong hurts.
Your aversion to pain prevents you from knowing the truth.
Pay the price to be right.
```
