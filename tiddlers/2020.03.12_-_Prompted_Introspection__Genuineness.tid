title: 2020.03.12 - Prompted Introspection: Genuineness

!! Why is it important to be genuine?

As usual, I am not careful enough with my words. I have some corrections for [[2018.05.21 - Prompted Introspection Log: Being Genuine]]. I know too many analytic philosophers who throw this concept away, sadly.

In some cases, I do want to act like someone else, and in some cases, I should (even when I don't). That too can be genuine. Particularizing parts of ourselves to a given context (or with a given set of persons) is an expensive task at times. 

Justified genuinity is important by definition. It turns out that being genuine without justification isn't important enough. Using our autonomy and honesty to be, do, and become what matters most in our context is going to require a genuineness to some [[dok]]. 

Genuine with respect to what? It seems to come in layers as well.
