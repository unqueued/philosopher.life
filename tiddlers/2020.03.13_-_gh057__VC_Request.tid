Hello, sir! You want to VC some this weekend?
Mar 13 1:14pm
Yeah that be great!
Mar 13 1:14pm
How you doing? All your family ok?
Mar 13 1:15pm
We are doing well. Been pulling teeth with my offspring this week, but we've been productive. We finally have a dining table, and that is great. It's been many years.
Mar 13 1:17pm
How about your family, and how are you?
Mar 13 1:17pm
I'm doing ok. Same ol grind. Looking for the schools to close soon due to this virus thing. Family is well.  I'm glad you got a table. Ours is mostly used for the cats to eat on . lol we usually eat in livingroom. Lol. 
Mar 13 1:19pm
Yeah, I bet. Schools have been shutting down all over the place.
Mar 13 1:19pm
Our cats love the table too, lol.
Mar 13 1:19pm
Lol yep i think they like the higher ground. Lol
Mar 13 1:20pm
I'm glad everyone is well. I hope you don't catch this thing. Good news is that our youngest family members are the safest among us for this thing.
Mar 13 1:20pm
Ty . I hope this thing gets gone pretty soon. I hate anyone who has to deal with the quarantine and im sure tge fallout from getting it.
Mar 13 1:22pm
I am simply unable to guess the effects of this event. I've never seen anything like it.
Mar 13 1:22pm
Me either and i hope this isnt going to become the norm every year and every illness that comes.....scary
Mar 13 1:23pm
There is a graphic novel series called //Lazarus// which you should check out. Super badass, fun (not lame at all, imho, and I find most superhero junk lame), and it demonstrates a world which has this kind of illness weaponized in the world.

(if you want me to grab copies for you, let me know)
Mar 13 1:25pm
That be great.
