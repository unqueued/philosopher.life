[7:21 PM] h0p3: Hope your day is going well, and I hope you guys are having fun with the visual novel.
[7:28 PM] Sohalia: We are! It’s anime af. And it’s nice to have people over cause this extrovert needs human interaction. :eyes:
[7:28 PM] Sohalia: I’m also derping around on my computer while they tell [[K]] which waifus he should date in game.
[1:34 PM] h0p3: How's your day going?
[2:13 PM] Sohalia: Not too shabby
[2:13 PM] Sohalia: Needed food like an hour ago but I am working on fixing that
[2:13 PM] Sohalia: Good otherwise though — hbu?
[2:14 PM] h0p3: Still feeling pretty sick, but I'll survive. I have a ton to do.
[2:14 PM] Sohalia: Woah, I think I missed that part
[2:15 PM] Sohalia: I’m sorry you’re sick. That really sucks, especially after moving.
[2:15 PM] h0p3: Aye, just got the pods yesterday, so I need to complete that task. Move aint over yet! :slight_smile: lol. But, it has been fairly smooth.
[2:41 PM] Sohalia: Good good
[2:42 PM] Sohalia: Well take it one step at a time. You don’t have to be completely moved in immediately... I mean just look at us. It took us like two years to be fully unpacked and we live in a 3 room apartment. :laughing:
[2:43 PM] h0p3: Sadly, we may have to move again in a year. They are trying to sell this place. It was what we could find and afford at the time (despite a month of looking). Still, moving within the same city is radically easier.
[2:48 PM] Sohalia: True true
[2:48 PM] Sohalia: Why is finding comfortable, affordable housing so damn impossible?? Ugh.
[2:50 PM] h0p3: Because as Adam Smith and Marx both describe, Rentseekers are effective parasites.
[2:51 PM] Sohalia: :<
[2:52 PM] Sohalia: On a less infuriating note, I found this cool picture today
[2:52 PM] Sohalia:

[2:55 PM] h0p3: That picture needs music. Very cool.
[2:58 PM] Sohalia: It dooooooes
[2:59 PM] Sohalia: It screams “vapor wave” to me and I love it
[2:59 PM] Sohalia: I made it my lock screen. :eyes:
[2:59 PM] h0p3: Somewhat reminded of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqaAs_3azSs

LORN - ANVIL [Official Music Video]

[3:30 PM] Sohalia: This music video feels like a dream
[3:32 PM] Sohalia: Or maybe it’s what some of my dreams feel like?
[3:34 PM] Sohalia: Not that I’m usually writhing in pain from having my brain downloaded lol
[3:46 PM] Sohalia: I wish I could download my dreams and let other people watch them. I think of the strangest things sometimes.
[4:18 PM] h0p3: I wish I understood more about dreaming.
[4:19 PM] Sohalia: I am one of the few people who still vividly dreams apparently. I wonder why that is?
[4:19 PM] h0p3: No idea.
[5:07 PM] Sohalia: Whaaaaaat
[5:07 PM] Sohalia: I thought you knew everything? :thinking:
[5:13 PM] h0p3: Lol :slight_smile:
[5:13 PM] h0p3: I wish.
[5:18 PM] h0p3: It's been a year since I last did so, but I'd still recommend "The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self" again. Especially since you have some kind of quasi-lucid dreaming thing it seems to me, it would likely be pertinent.
