title: 2019.07.26 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Fucking Hens

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
A well-known joke - a fool who thought he was a grain of corn. After some time in a mental hospital he was cured; now he knew that he was not a grain, but a man. So they let him out; but soon after he came running back saying, 'I met a hen and I was afraid she would try to eat me.' The doctors tried to calm him down. 'What are you afraid of? You know you are not a grain, but a man.' The fool answered: 'Yes of course I know that, but does the hen know?'
<<<

I'm so out of the loop on this pointless claim. I didn't know this as a well-known joke, and I suspect the chicken doesn't either. Furthermore, as an autistic man, I cannot understand this joke. I just can't suspend my disbelief enough. Of course, at least according to my theory of its mind, the chicken can't understand that I don't get the joke because the chicken doesn't hold beliefs which count as knowledge at all. If it did, then it might understand I don't understand the joke, that the man isn't a grain of corn, and perhaps that the man might be worried the chicken doesn't understand the man isn't a grain of corn.

Classic doxastic problematic, right? I don't know what it means to believe something but not act on it all the way down. I believe in freewill, but it's kinda magic to me, yo. The fool doesn't coherentify his beliefs, fails to meaningfully generate and commit the chains of inferences to his hierarchical deep self, and never gets past square 2 because he doesn't seem to really get past square 1. 

Wait, how do I know that you know that the man knew he wasn't a grain a corn again? In any case, since it is technically relevant in at least one possible world: I don't know with certainty what the hen knows or doesn't know, nor do I know if it is necessarily always foolish to be concerned with such a thing.

Okay, I've got it. For the sake of generating a counterexample, imagine a world like that of the last episode of Season 2 in //Rick and Morty// (you probably won't appreciate this one), where everything grows on a corncob (unliveable conditions, right?). Now, the men who grow on that planet might actually be grains of corn on a cob of that Earth-like planet outside of the federation/guberment's control. Chickens on such a planet could be huge, and they mistake men who aren't from the planet (and hence no grains of mancorn) with those grains of mancorn growing on the planet. It is conceivably important to a rational fool that the chicken knew he wasn't a grain of corn too. 

I forgot why I gave a fuck about this joke. If you made it this far, whoever you are, you have earned a prize. You are hereby granted one free bitchslap scheduled in advance at my convenience.
