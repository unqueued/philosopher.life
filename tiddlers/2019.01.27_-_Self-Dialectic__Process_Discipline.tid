title: 2019.01.27 - Self-Dialectic: Process Discipline

Ran across something [[JYU]] said about using TW as I do: he said it takes too much process discipline. I don't know how you are supposed to do this without enormous process discipline. What does it look like? Maybe I don't know what it really means. You have to be boxy, do all the hardcrafting work in the right order, and have the integrity to do it ~~even~~ especially when it sucks. How else can you manufacture yourself safely, consistently, wisely, and progressively? Creativity requires constriction to some [[dok]].

Systematically reasoning about your life has to be...systematic. What am I missing?

I probably shouldn't think too much of it. The STEMlords and marketers are not going to see what matters to me, imho. Heretic, indeed.

I think process discipline is about generating virtuous habits that you no longer have to reason about. You keep climbing that mountain. You build bigger habits from smaller ones. 

There are places for serious messiness and creativity here. Containing it ain't easy. Knowing when to let it out of the cage, taking the risks, etc. I still haven't learned how to do it [[irwartfrr]]. As usual, there is something profoundly dysfunctional about me.
