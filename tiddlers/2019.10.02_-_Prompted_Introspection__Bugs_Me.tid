title: 2019.10.02 - Prompted Introspection: Bugs Me

!! What is something that really bugs you?

When I've tried really hard and it didn't work, fix it, or end up mattering (except in the ultimate analysis which sits outside consequentialism). I'm looking for a fairy tale ending here. I'd like it to add up in a satisfying way for me while I'm still living. So far, I cannot say my perseverance has been worth it beyond [[The Moral Law]], but that's the only appropriate Reason. Still, my virtue-theoretic disposition remains plenty bugged and even broken.
