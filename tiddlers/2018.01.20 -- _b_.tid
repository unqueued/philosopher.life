"Fascism is an historical conception in which man could not be what he is without being a factor in the spiritual process to which he contributes, either in the family sphere or in the social sphere, in the nation or in history in general to which all nations contribute. Hence is derived the great importance of tradition in the records, language, customs and rules of human society. Man without a part in history is nothing."

That's from Readings in Fascism and National Socialism: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14058

The Fascist leader is meant to embody the racial spirit of the people. His legitimacy comes from his lack of creativity, and his utter conformity to traditional values.
