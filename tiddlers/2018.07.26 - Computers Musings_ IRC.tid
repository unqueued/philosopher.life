Freenode (and its admins in particular) are getting hammered by some spammers/hackers. There appears to be a campaign to paint them as pedophiles. Turning off private messages.

`/umode +R`

Set in network connect configuration too.

I don't see a use for stacked mode...Tabbed is almost definitionally better from what I can. I TAKE IT BACK! I've found some usecases, particularly in vertical modes where it's preferred.

I need generic templates that I can cycle through to impose on the windows. I want specific templates that I can save for particular workflows and workspaces.

Perhaps I can enter into a particular "Mode" when using a template as well.

* "Startup Layouts"
* "Imposing Layouts/Templates"

Here are imposable layouts I want to "cycle" through:

* X by X grid layout.
* v-stack, with master to left side and slaves to the right
* ?
