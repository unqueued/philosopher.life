title: 2019.03.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Lucidity

* Woke at 9
** Oh, I'm experiencing awareness of myself before I wake up and hear what is physically external to me, but I can talk to myself in the darkness and in my dreams. It happened twice last night, once to turn off Archer, and the other upon actually waking fully. There is no sound beyond my internal voice, and then it comes to me. This is extremely exciting!
*** With the skeptic's standard, I cannot say "external world" here, I can only say physically external to me.
** Feeling embodied and having sensation also becomes disclosed to me.
** I feel like a brain in a vat, just a wee bit, even if I am the vat.
