title: 2019.12.18 - Prompted Introspection: New Child

!! How would you feel if a new child moved into your neighbourhood?

Harsh, but yeah: [[2017.11.15 - Prompted Introspection Log: New Kid on the Block]]. It's not that I don't give a shit at all, but there's so many people here I simply can't keep track. We seem to get along well with the neighborhood kids, and it's common for some to come by to play with my son. We're sometimes required to resolve disputes or make sure they are being safe (like that one time there was a bear running through the neighborhood).

I like that my offspring have a chance to think about the lives of other children, to have comparison points, to get out of our bubble, and to have more perspective.

Finding peers for my daughter has not worked here (though it's fine online). Last birthday party she attended, she started taking the parents to task in political debate. Just hopped right in there from the kids' table. Lawdy. Good for her.
