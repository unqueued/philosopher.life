title: 2018.01.02 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Flood Roof Mate

!! Imagine you're stuck on the roof of a house that has been carried away by a flood. Which person would you most like to be on the roof with you?

My wife. Most likely we are going to die (I'm going to pretend my children are visiting their uncle in this scenario, since I don't want to think about the alternative). I have a few minutes to live, and I want to spend it with her. What else would I want? She gives me meaning because she interprets me.
