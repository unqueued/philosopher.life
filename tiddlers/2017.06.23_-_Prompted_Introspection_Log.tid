!! Champion an organization

People suck, especially when they are interacting with each other. I rarely have respect for organizations. That said, I am grateful a few exist as they are (for the most part!). I highly recommend The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF): https://www.eff.org/. They do good work. They preserve digital, intellectual, technological, and adjacent human rights through western legal systems. They aren't perfect, but I have respect for what they do and why they do it.

I don't give money to organizations anymore for the most part (my trust fuse is burned out), but EFF is one of the few I will continue to give money to. If there is any hope for humanity, and the masses, in particular, it will be through organizations like the EFF fighting the psychopaths of our world.

I suppose I don't know how to champion an organization. Champion to whom? Convincing myself is easy. Explaining why the EFF is so valuable to others requires convincing them of their stupidity, generally on a multitude of subjects and levels. Oh, I can put forth a rational argument. That's not what this is about though. Their very foundations are so profoundly wrong and ignorant that I'm putting the cart before the horse even trying to champion the EFF to them. These people already "know" what they think they need to know. Good luck closing that incommensurable gap.

Explaining what is good and right about the EFF requires having Theories of The Good and The Right in the first place (and the will be to be philosophical). For my audience, we aren't going to agree, and I'm not going to lie. I think there's no point to it. To be fair, I think some of those who support the EFF don't even get what's great about the EFF; they support it for the wrong reasons or for incomplete reasons. 

My championing is only effective for people who were already fairly close to agreeing with me in the first place, and that is generally quite rare.

I'm sure you think that's "just a fine attitude, indeed" don't you Samwise Gamgee? Go fuck yourself, you sarcastic piece of shit. Welcome to the epistemological and ethical nature of fundamental disagreement. To an overwhelming degree, I'm not responsible for the willed-ignorance of others. That's true today more than it has ever been. Finding the truth today has far less to do with the Socratic method and public discourse in a traditional sense than it does with curating, bursting your information bubbles, and critical analysis on your own. The information is easily obtained. Having the intellectual integrity is the hard part. Sifting through it, thinking about it, and being wise is on the individual, and my obligations to you and others are fairly limited outside of my citizenship (of which, I'm fairly powerless). 

I'll quietly plant seeds and cultivate those ready to drink my kool-aid, but I'm not here to be a prophet. Most of you assholes deserve to suffer (of course, I don't want humans to suffer, but part of me thinks you should reap what you've sown). 

The days when people come up to me charitably asking questions and listening to me for understanding is when I will bend over backward to connect the dots for them. I'm done sacrificing myself for humanity (which doesn't deserve to live) beyond what I believe is morally required of us all.

Championing is a weasel word for rhetoric, not philosophy. KYS, Samwise Gamgee. I'm not playing that game unless I can reasonably improve the lives of my children and family with it, and even then, I do so in disgust. I'm avoiding that game whenever possible. Not my circus, not my monkeys. I have no more spoons to give.
