title: 2017.06.06 - Pipefitting Log

Today was a good day. The day began with Chris and I finishing the drawing and math for the second half of our large fabrication. We had done most of it yesterday, but I wanted to finalize the math since Nash decided he wasn't going to take his test until Friday. As a consequence (and it was obvious that this was the going to happen), the teacher told him he would do shop work instead of sitting in the classroom. I didn't trust Nash to do any of the planning or math. Nash, of course, was not pleased to have to work in the shop. He is incredibly lazy.

 I studied for my next test for most of the day. There was a large interruption in the middle of the day. A recruiter from the international boilermaker's union stopped by to give us a speech.

He was full of himself, hated liberals and educated people, proudly ignorant, and was absurdly capitalist. The union was a way to make money, but he didn't see the social utility and underlying basis of it seemed. He was a simple man. That said, regardless of the d-bag messenger, I will be looking into it. There is a union 2-hours away from me. Probably not worth it, but I don't want to leave any stone unturned here.

The starting pay was good. They mostly do welding, but they need fitters too. Starting pay is $23 for everyone unless they can pass more tests on MIG and TIG. Tops out at $31 not included about $12 in benefits. 

Let's say the world isn't ending, I think the best option is to become vested in multiple organizations. This distributes risks and maximizes my earning potential for retirement. I could reasonably become vested in 2-3 organization before retirement. This seems especially useful considering how top brass don't appear to make more money. It depends on our needs, I guess.

In any case, I didn't take the exam because of this interruption and because Chris left early. I decided to wait for him, and since I was ready to get my nose out of the book, I went into the shop to get some work done. Nash had cut 4 pipes and beveled 2. That was it. Lol. He was "practicing his welding" (i.e. dicking around). What an asshole. I'm glad I won't be actually working with him and that he doesn't hold me back from progressing at this point. I had to grab a 30-foot length with Matt (new guy) and make the cuts. I checked everything, marked it, and organized it. I didn't have time to get all the fittings set. I'll probably do that later since I highly doubt Nash will.
