Michael Blouin and I need to be friends. Marxist quotes starting on page 2, and I would never expect such a thing could be tolerated in his workplace. 

Neoliberalism as "the construction of an imaginary tradition" is harsh. Love it. "Fantasy clouds a much darker reality." Fucking preach, yo!

He spends a great deal of time fleshing out the description, as he should. There are many technical moves here, and I regret that I'm borderline illiterate. I've consumed maybe 60% of the content he's talking about.

I would like to know his opinion on Radical Markets.

I need to know this Blouin's prescription. He has a well-rounded point of view here, built in both the quant and qual aspects of the problem.

This is a book that needs to be read more than once. I'm going to look pretty fucking stupid in front of him. Too bad! I need wisdom.

Ugh, I've never seen Candyman (although, I've glimpsed parts of it). He does a fine job of pointing out the racial equality != class equality, the sleight of hand.

As usual critical theory does a great job in deconstruction, a crucial one. I'm still looking for the construction (which is not to detract from deconstruction, but simply to complete it).

I'm going to annoy him with my inarticulacy. So be it. I see in places he does not, even if I'm not a good communicator. This man deserves my help, and I think we should be friends.

Yes. So, once we " wake from these potent illusions," what are we to do?

Look, I'm all for "recast[ing] the critical community as a collective" and "reinvent[ing] our very modes of dreaming." You still need principles, reasons, paradigms. We must start planting those seeds and finding them now. We are out of time.
