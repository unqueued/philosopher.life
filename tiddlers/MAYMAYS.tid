!! About:

<<<
Words are memes that can be pronounced.

-- Daniel C. Dennett

<<<
Memes can be visual. Our image of George Washington is a meme. We don't actually have any idea what George Washington looked like. There are so many different portraits of him, and they're all different. But we have an image in our head, and that image is propagated from one place to another, from one person to another. 

-- James Gleick

Rumors had their own classic epidemiology. Each started with a single germinating event. Information spread from that point, mutating and interbreedingâ€”a conical mass of threads, expanding into the future from the apex of their common birthplace. Eventually, of course, they'd wither and die; the cone would simply dissipate at its wide end, its permutations senescent and exhausted.

There were exceptions, of course. Every now and then a single thread persisted, grew thick and gnarled and unkillable: conspiracy theories and urban legends, the hooks embedded in popular songs, the comforting Easter-bunny lies of religious doctrine. These were the memes: viral concepts, infections of conscious thought. Some flared and died like mayflies. Others lasted a thousand years or more, tricked billions into the endless propagation of parasitic half-truths.

-- Peter Watts, Maelstrom

My daughter points out that I have replaced some usage of the word "meme" with "maymay" simply so that I have the ability to use "meme" as a very serious philosophical term of art. Dank Maymays r lit. Let's functionally weaponize them with [[The Golden Rule]].
