title: 2019.03.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Free Expression

!! Respond to the following gem:

From a comparative perspective, the United States is unusual if not unique in the lack of restraints on freedom of expression. It is also unusual in the range and effectiveness of methods employed to restrain freedom of thought... Where the voice of the people is heard, elite groups must insure their voice says the right things… The less the state is able to employ violence in the defense of the interest of the elite groups that effectively dominate it, the more it becomes necessary to devise techniques of ‘manufacture of consent’… Where obedience is guaranteed by violence, rulers may tend towards a ‘behaviourist’ conception; it is enough that people obey; what they think does not matter too much. Where the state lacks means of coercion, it is important to control what people think.

Traditionally, freedom of expression may be more effectively protected by US law than many other nations, but it's obviously under attack and faces significant pressures from a variety of individuals, groups, and institutions.

A dichotomy between free expression and thought is fascinating. I think they are conceptually linked, but that appears to be his point. 

I suppose fMRI machines might pose an example of where I would be willing to sever them; to be punished for the results of that machine alone would cause many to lose the ability to think something which they wouldn't directly express otherwise. Perhaps some kinds of //Minority Report// prediction might also be another version of a tool to peeling them apart. I tend to think that our behaviors, including speech, just are expressions of our thoughts. [[Saint Chomsky]] implies this as well, imho.

Obviously, so-called "consent" is manufactured all-too-often, and it comes in many degrees. Our autonomy is often corrupted, our conditioning subtle yet pervasive. Behold the invisible nudging and social pressures, the dominance of oligarchic media narratives, censorship (rather than picking out what is salient), the revision of history maintained even in schools, literal memetic warfare, and the profound escalation of surveillance capitalism for marketing and enforcement. 

Obeying is a hard problem. I find mental action to be action as well. I can't peel them apart nicely; that's part of understanding the concept of freedom. Insofar as an action is act and motive, then the behaviorist is concerned with mere act but not the blackbox motive. 

I think physical violence is still quite common in the US (just look at our prison system), and many nations simply underreport. As I have mentioned, physical violence is often unnecessary in virtue of the physical defense measures our nation has already undertaken against uprising. I think we are profoundly physically and memetically influenced and dominated. Not, of course, justified coercion does exist; that is the duty of the state and the people generating and maintain a government. Even where a state has the means to physical coercion, mental domination is often the effective option.
