title: Troublemakers: Lessons in Freedom from Young Children at School

Yikes. Her definition of freedom isn't coherent enough, though she is absolutely right about so much of what we owe to children though. I'm going to cut her some slack here. She's not an expert in the domain I'm worried about.

The author does a beautiful fucking job. It's visceral and well-argued. I wish someone handed me this book long ago. I can't say I'm learning anything, but that doesn't matter. 

I have much stronger opinions about what we owe to each other, and I care more about learning than the author. (no offense) She has conflated material dialectics with academic dialectics. I obviously understand the crossover, and I agree to the descriptions she gives and the explanations. She doesn't know what it's supposed to be enough to realize that she's not giving an effective prescription. Perhaps I'm just not far enough into the book.

Anyone can say "freedom." I'm hoping she will see the fundamental problem rests with the centralization of power in general. I'm fine with attacking hierarchies that don't aim to decentralize power [[irwartfrr]].

---

These are tropes with profound empathy in their creation. The prescription is so generalized it is weak. I know that feel. She is not correct about freedom and personal identity. Once she manages to pickup the coherent metaethics necessary to distill this issue, the rest of her book solidifies.

Unfortunately, I'm still not convinced that she is picking outthe real cause well enough: capitalism. I suggest her audience, and more importantly, those who hand her the mouthpiece here, have no interest in going that direction too strongly. Don't get me wrong: there is plenty of solid socialist reasoning in here. She doesn't complete it though, and I think that shifts the blame where it doesn't quite belong. It was a well -engineered piece of rhetoric. 

I adore that she sees [[love]] like she does, but she's missing pieces. The best part of this book are just the stories. She should stay out of ethics and political philosophy.
