title: 2017.07.27 - Wiki Review Log

* [[Mobile Phone To-Do-Checklist]]
** Have a plan. I really need it up and running asap. I know exactly what I want out of desktops, laptops, SoCs, etc. Phones are their own beasts. They still don't meet my expectations and needs, but I should continue to try and find a way to maximize their utility in my life.
* [[2017.07.26 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** My wife and I talked about it. It may not be the best idea. Walking through the books, however, seems useful. The badges, pride, and poor moral training they receive in Boy Scouts aren't what I want for him though.
* [[2017.07.26 - Pipefitting Log]]
** Edited: added the phone part. I forgot.
* [[2017.07.26 - Wiki Review Log]]
** Edited, Edited, Edited. I should say what I've edited.
* [[2017.07.26 - Carpe Diem Log]]
** Maybe I should have a notes section. Notes are different from Carpe Diem, right? I fear I'm entering the territory of something not useful enough in itself. I have to be ruthless with my logs.
*** I should ask my wife what she thinks. She has a good eye.
