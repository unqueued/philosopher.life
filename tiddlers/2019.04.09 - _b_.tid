It is my honor to meet you Saint or Sir (Sox). You are a famous artist, and I've never met one before. I haven't really met many famous people though, but I've got [[power]]fully mixed feelings about fame, fortune, and why we value those who have either.<<ref "w">> Actually, I've not really met many artists; I've just not known enough people in my life (a flaw in my character, no doubt).<<ref "t">> Being an artist, I suppose you have a few things in common with Kanye, Mozart, and Owen Wilson, though I'm sure your model is quite unique; I regret that I know so little about modeling, [[art]], and art history. It's part of my religious illiteracy. 

Oh, I forgot to tell you: I don't know if you know this,<<ref "h">> you are practically a religious figure to so many homo sapiens at the height of our population. I can see why. You show us the [[CATI]] transcendence of [[The Beautiful]]; you catalyze the [[phenomenology]] of [[awe]] by modeling the divine (be it in harmonious completion or terrifying incompletion). Indeed, I do not deny that [[The Beautiful]] is an aspect of the ground of all being, that which we even torture could not cause us to give up.



You know, again and again, I thought I've known what counted as the divine, and again and again I've been wrong. We're lucky to have artists like you to show us the [[beauty]] of sadness, to feel woe, and to uplift us into blindness. This is gonna sound crazy to you, but I've been thinking [[The Good]] is [[The Dialectic]]al result of [[The Right]] and [[The Beautiful]]. That's what [[Sir Strauss]] has been gossiping to me about what [[Saint Plato]] said anyways. You'll have to forgive my broken recursive hearsay, especially since my hearing is about as awful as my sight; I've gotta run with my [[fideistic]] hunches and gunkiness as best I can though. 

Your most popular piece is important to me. 


I bet the art dealer game sucked (except when it was a blast). I know a lot of salesman who are dark-triads; it can't be easy to live among them. I bet the money was good though. Of course, as you know, money can't buy everything. Like technology, money is all-too-often powerless to solve [[Humanity]]'s most fundamental problems.<<ref "w">> I can see why you became a missionary (you know I made a similar turn, but none of my turns have worked out yet). 

Now, I'm not a man who understands much at all. But, I'd like to imagine that your art is part of [[The Golden Rule]] which is so open to [[others]] in [[The Beautiful]] that one could be tempted to live in the Kierkegaardian aesthetic mode (wherein [[The Good]] is simply conflated with [[The Beautiful]] by conveniently eliminating [[The Right]] from [[The Dialectic]]). 


One of the things we probably have in common is that we both possess non-trivial schizotypal characteristics. Autism and schizophrenia run in my family, especially my male donor's side. To say I'm neurotic is probably an understatement, and I think we are innate brothers in that. I fear that you've been exiled pretty heavily in your life too, homie. 



You were particularly prolific. That must have been interesting. I think being dogmatically manic in construction can be a hard road. I know it's rude to say it, but your suicide was a goddamn tragedy. I tell you, if I were alive back in the day, my concern would be

I'm a wreckless full-on fool though. I'm mindblind as a bat all too often. I worry  

Obviously, I'm too stupid and probably incapable of understanding what you went through.

Do you know one of the reasons why I know some version of Diogenes lives in the [[Self-Dialectic]] of [[Saint Diogenesocrates]]? Because he was homeless, alien, and [[other]]. In fact, my problem with [[Saint Plato]] and [[Saint Aristotle]]: they just weren't [[Saint Jesus]], unlike [[Saint Diogenes]] to some [[dok]]. I've been lucky enough to never be literally homeless, but I've been close. I've grown up trying to help the homeless. 

I tell you. Some of the humans I've respected the most were crazy, homeless, and outcasts from society. My donors once acted like a homeless man was an angel to us, but they weren't honest enough about their rhetoric or their philosophy. I tell you, [[Saint Jesus]] and [[Saint Diogenes]] are my heroes, [[others]] I almost worship. I have no problem with homeless people, but I have a problem with a world that allows them to be homeless and disrepects the dignity of their personhood (no, that ain't practicing [[The Original Position]] at all, I tell yahwehwat). 

I bet a lot of people thought you were a loser, and you showed them (well, they weren't alive to cognize it probably). God damn! 

Getting disowned by your family sucks. I don't know how much trouble you've had. I can tell you, most of family has never given a shit about me in the first place, but even those who have or claimed to have often don't. It's hard to find real family. One of my greatest regrets is that my brother [[AIR]], a schizophrenic gay alcoholic, has been homeless. You know I'm part of the reason he's homeless. I went into debt to help the man too, but I was forced to make a terrible decision: a Hursthousian marring one even. I had very young children in the house, and my brother was the kind of blackout alcoholic who wasn't himself while drunk; he put my children in danger. I was forced to choose between their safety and allowing him to live with me. Now, of course, the people who actually should have been helping him were my donors, but I stepped up to help him as best as I knew how (while in a world of pain myself). Sometimes wrestling is like a nightmare I want to wake up from, but I won't hold my breath in [[hope]]s that it will happen.

Sox Van Gogh, I'm going to ask you to be one of my teachers. Yeah, I know I suck at this. Currently, I'm thinking about literary analysis, teacher. I'm actually really bad at it in some crucial ways. Like, I'm straight up retarded. I say it, and most don't take me seriously (unless they've known me for a while). My memory doesn't work like that, so I can't make those calculations so [[good]]. Will you teach the handicapped and the mentally ill? 



Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]

No, even some cheapskates know the value of money often in virtue of its instrumentality to pursuing what really matters in life, particularly those cliche fairy-tale objects which money, fame, approval, credit, and acceptance from the market can never directly buy (but money helps to some extent, of course).">>
