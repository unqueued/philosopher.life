He called me from the beach he hopes to move to in a couple years. Retirement is not going well, and his tempjob is sucking the life out of him. He sounds very much unhappy with life, and I feel bad for him. I'm bad at communicating that fact effectively enough to him.

He probably said he loved me unconditionally about 20 times. He said he understood me. He claims to have read my wiki, but could not address it. He made a lot of tall promises. He really wanted me to throw reason away and listen to his affective influence. Clearly, he thinks what I'm doing is stupid. =/ - I can't help him there. He can read and debate directly with me about the stupidity in writing from now on.

He continually explicitly contradicted (straight up P and ~P, literally) himself throughout the conversation (a common problem with him over the past ~13 years I've known him) and also repeated himself like a broken record (huge dark-triad redflags). Several moves he said were profoundly illogical (and bear close inspection). It was a very Straussian moment. It is interesting for an autist to build a relation with a schizophrenic. I love the man, even though we disagree in a profound way across the Bayesian bridge. 

I think he is gently trying to say he is not interested in my wiki. He claimed he could only get to know me by taking a walk with me. He had no argument for the claim other than a feeling. Actually, overall, I think he disagrees with my beliefs and desires pretty radically (even when we have quite a bit in common). In a sense, it's okay that we disagree because we have no other choices to some non-trivial extent. Of course, even in [[T42T]] on the [[Wiki Litmus Test]], I am willing to accept what minimal cooperation can arise from not engaging in our disagreements with each other at this level. Admittedly, not much of a relationship can be built if we can't engage in each other's writing. 

He said he felt bad that he wasn't able to call me back quickly enough. I told him not to worry about it. It sounded like he wasn't sure about us meeting in person either, for logistical reasons. I told him not to worry about it, and we will see each other when we can.

I think we both desperately wanted the other to know we loved one another. We felt distant, and we did not want to be. I admire that about him. 

It felt like hospitality negotiation in the desert. I enjoy having the chance to be so open with him, as gently as I can. I do not wish to be a dick to this man, and I go out of my way not to contradict his faulty reasoning as far as I charitably can. It leaves us little space to discuss what matters, but I appreciate that he even wants to try (recognizing the difference between us as nomads is huge in a number of regards). I hear hospitality and [[The Golden Rule]] there, and I hope I did a good job of conveying the desire for peace, cooperation, trust, and love built on the best foundations we can muster together.

If all we get to have is a shallow relationship, then I will continue it. Obviously, I hope for more. Regardless, I will treat The Other here, different language/perception/model though he may have, as empathically as I can.

Love can exist even with minimal trust and respect. I will do my best, sir!
