title: 2018.11.20 - Prompted Introspection: Frightening Animals

!! What animals frighten you and why?

Snakes and spiders frighten me. I am genetically programmed, like most of my species, to detect and react strongly to these creatures who can sometimes be very dangerous.

I'm not a person who generally adores animals (especially not the human kind), but sometimes I find a particular one that I like. I love and like my cats. I would rather watch an animal than interact with one in the vast majority of cases. Some of this preference is the result of fear.

Humans clearly frighten me the most. I think the vast majority of human specimens are awful persons.
