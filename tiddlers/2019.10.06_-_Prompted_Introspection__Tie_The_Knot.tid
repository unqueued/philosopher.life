title: 2019.10.06 - Prompted Introspection: Tie The Knot

!! What is your favorite day of the week?

[[2018.03.18 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favday of Week]] is correct. If I have to pick one, it will be Sunday. [[Family Time]] is the dialectical, oscillating pulse of our lives together. Some of the hardest work we do happens on Sunday. It's a commitment. It also makes a lot of my son's friends sad that he rarely gets to go out on Sundays because it's monopolized by being with the family.

If the week is a spiral or a loop, Sunday is where we tie the knots of our lives together. It's a mix of many activities. It's collective existential upkeep, a space to hold each other accountable, guaranteed time set apart for just being there with one another in a pressureless way, handing down our interpretation of a tradition worth valuing (ridiculously rare or narrow for me), constructing our self-representations together, and it takes our pulse. It is a pulse, a clock cycle in the computation of our family.
