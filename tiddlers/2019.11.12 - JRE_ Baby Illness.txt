I am sorry. I know you are crazy busy dude. 
Nov 12, 2019 10:44am
You have a baby, so there is barely anytime for anything.
Nov 12, 2019 10:44am
How sick are they?
Nov 12, 2019 10:44am
Nah, normally he sleeps pretty easy and often
Nov 12, 2019 10:45am
She Is throwing up
Nov 12, 2019 10:45am
He is super congested
Nov 12, 2019 10:45am
His sleep process takes like a solid hour to do now, and involves lots of me being frustrated lol
Nov 12, 2019 10:46am
Gotta get him to a shallow sleep by bouncing him while doing squats (no joke,its the only thing that works), then I gotta let him sleep on my chest for 15 min while I sit down, and finally can try to put him in bed, which works half the time, otherwise we go right back to the beginning
Nov 12, 2019 10:50am
That sounds exceptionally frustrating.
Nov 12, 2019 10:59am
Are you staying home today?
Nov 12, 2019 10:59am
Yeah, he cried a ton at daycare on monday, and rebecca is staying home
Nov 12, 2019 11:00am
Gotta turtle up and survive.
Nov 12, 2019 11:00am
Granted, she did wake up with him this morning after my 5-7 session and let me sleep until 1030, so obviously she is pulling her weight despite feeling sick
Nov 12, 2019 11:01am
She loves you both.
Nov 12, 2019 11:02am

Tried returning the pos tools the company got me for store credit so I could select a few better quality tools.  No such luck.

Nov 17, 2019 5:45pm
Yuck. =(

I'm glad that you weren't all sick at the same time.
Nov 17, 2019 5:48pm
True
Nov 17, 2019 5:48pm
I hope you can get enough sleep, and that it won't get bad. Whatever the hell Rebecca had sounds awful.
