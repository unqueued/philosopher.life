title: 2018.05.14 - Polymath Craftsman: Takin' It Easy

We showed up. We sat around doing fuck all. We searched for wires, Colton made a show of it, etc. 2 hours into the day, we got to work. 

Colton still hasn't figured out all of what is entailed in this job. He spent an hour just figuring out how many lamps there are and comparing to our inventory after I spoke to him early in the morning about it. My worry is that he is literally trying to screw us out of work time by acting like there is more work than there actually is. It turns out, he's just incompetent (although, that still doesn't preclude him from having evil motivations).

I got to drive the trencher/ditch-witch. I'm not terribly good at it, but I did okay for a first try I think. 

We screwed around a lot today. It is possible that Colton is going to be true to his word; you must forgive my doubt. He has failed other tests before. We also left 45 minutes early. That is surprising to me.
