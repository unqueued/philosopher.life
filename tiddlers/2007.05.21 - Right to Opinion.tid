title: 2007.05.21 - Right to Opinion

Briefly elaborating on my previous commentary on Democracy: I think it is important to evaluate one more point. People don't necessarily have a right to an opinion. We all take this as a &quot;right&quot;, and we assume it to be true. We don't want to put ourselves in a position to ever deny our own &quot;right&quot; to our opinion. But, frankly, it is obvious that we don't believe people have a right to their opinion.

The only people with a &quot;right&quot; to an opinion are those who are correct. If you say 2+2=4, and that statement is true, then you have the proper warrant to believe it, and thus I might say you have a &quot;right&quot; to that opinion. But, then again, it isn't opinion at that point.

Opinion is useless outside the truth.

Utility arguments fail. A &quot;right&quot; requires some innate value that mere utility simply cannot justify. We cannot value opinions which are blatantly flase, we can, however, admire the truth an opinion contains. Again, this doesn't necessarily justify &quot;rights&quot; per se.

Obviously, there are too many stupid people that have incorrect opinions, and probably no right to hold those opinions. Warrant and reason are required. The lack of those justifies a lack of &quot;right to opinion&quot;.

When we talk about gaming, a matter in which I'm an expert, then I generally have the right to hold an opinion (I.E. because I know fact). If you wanted my opinion on the mechanics of automobiles, a subject that I know nothing about, then I must inform you that I really don't have a &quot;right&quot; to hold any opinion.

In the same way, I think stupid people should say, &quot;I don't know&quot; and shut their faces.

This isn't practical. And, it will never be put into action. But, it is true.
