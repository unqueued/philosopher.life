title: 2019.09.24 - Prompted Introspection: Optimistic About

!! What is something you are optimistic about?

That some sense of optimism, to some [[dok]], is worth our time and energy. [[Hope]] is {[[axiom]]}atic to me, but [[hope]] for what? That is a hard problem. As I age, my predictions of the happiness we will achieve grows dimmer and lower. I am more confident than ever that we are fucked. My optimism is one of modality, and the odds are radically against us. [[ridtyawtr]]. I know it can be solved, though it cannot be as great as it once could have been. Each passing day, we lose margins of what can be accomplished in addition to suffering we cause in the present. My optimism is a matter of [[faith]]. What I [[hope]] for diminishes with time and understanding of the state of affairs. I hold onto my loved ones as Armageddon comes. Theodicy is damning.
