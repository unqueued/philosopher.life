!! What would you do if you knew the answer to pollution of the earth?

It depends on the answer. Of the best answers I know, I would simply sit and cry. Nobody is going to implement it. We aren't going to cooperate. The tragedy of the commons and our prisoner's dilemmas end the hope of solving pollution. We're fucked. 

That said, if I felt like it would have a chance of succeeding, I would start trying to convert the world to implement it.
