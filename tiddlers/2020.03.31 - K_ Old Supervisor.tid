[11:43 AM] h0p3: Neat. For what?
[11:45 AM] Ardent_Assailant: My old supervisor wants me to organize her pile of books into SuDoc for later because they’re all mixed up haha
[11:45 AM] h0p3: TAing for your super
[11:45 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Basically.
[11:45 AM] Ardent_Assailant: She knows that if I have nothing to do here then I’ll have to stop working.
[11:45 AM] h0p3: She is the best.
[11:46 AM] Ardent_Assailant: So she gave me something very time-consuming to do over the next few months.
[11:46 AM] Ardent_Assailant: She really is.
[11:46 AM] Ardent_Assailant: She’s the one who hired me.
[11:47 AM] Ardent_Assailant: It’s also something new to put on my resume.

[11:48 AM] Ardent_Assailant: That’s my new handle lol
[11:49 AM] Ardent_Assailant: What are you up to today?
[11:50 AM] h0p3: Reading and writing. Presentations on https://philosopher.life/#Belief today. I'd like to flesh it out more. We need to do a big shopping.
[11:57 AM] Ardent_Assailant: A lot of good info. It’s a great skeleton to start out with.
[11:57 AM] Ardent_Assailant: We need to do some mild shopping but I don’t want to.
[12:01 PM] h0p3: I've never cared for shopping offline. It's somehow even less fun these days, lol.
