When I want to talk about something cool about computers, my brother tends to try to end the conversation. He doesn't want to talk about it or even listen to me ramble out it. I get it. 

I'm willing (actually, I'm generally directly interested) to listen to his technical talk in video games or his work, but I don't think he really wants to do the same for me.
