    Theory of a legal system (concept of law):

        Legal Positivism

            Definition/Initial Thoughts

                Separability Thesis

                    Civil laws are not logically connected to moral law

                    Validity of laws has nothing to do, necessarily speaking, with moral right and wrong

                        Valid means they are conceptually accepted as a law

                    You could have a genuine set of laws which are quite immoral

                H.L.A. Hart is an example proponent of this view

                Law is normative in the sense that it describes that laws say “you ought to do this”, but whether or not the laws have normativity themselves, that is different

                The claim, apparently, isn’t that they have a value neutral view of the law, rather system of ruels are normative, just not based on morality necessarily (conceptually linked).

            Classical Positivism

                Bentham

                John Austin

                    The Imperative Theory of Law

            Modern Positivism

                Started by H.L.A. Hart

                Exlusive Positivists (Hard)

                    Joseph Raz, Scott Shapiro are examples

                    You necessarily can’t include moral norms in making laws. Laws are incompatible entirely with morality.

                    If you use morality as a validity standard, then law becomes too ambiguous because morality is ambiguous and too debateable.

                Inclusive Positivists (Soft)

                    Definitions and initial thoughts:

                        H.L.A. Hart, Coleman, and Kramer are examples

                        Moral criteria doesn’t necessarily have to be of the validity standard, but it can.

                        Advanced societies often do employ moral law as a criteria for evaluating civil law

                    Version 1 – “If you want” moral norms can be necessary for particular valid laws.

                        Moral notions can be injected into the law, but a law could still be immoral

                        Not necessarily, but possibly: we could have a government which has moral norms as its validity criterion.

                        Ex: “Can’t engage in cruel and unusual punishment”

                            The only way to tell what is cruel and unusual is to engage in some sort of moral criteria

                        Ex: “Follow due process of Law”

                            Innately embedded notion of “fairness” or “right”

                    Version 2 – “IF you want,” Moral norms can be sufficient for particular valid laws

                        Golden rule is sometimes taken as being sufficient in itself as a law, even though it isn’t written in our books or something.

                        Incorporationism-criterion can incorporate moral norms

        Natural Law

            Definition and Initial Thoughts:

                Moral Concept of Law

                (broader sense than philosophers would use the phrase “Natural law” – where we associate more exclusively to someone like Aquinas, but this also includes Locke, etc.)

                    E.g. Reason is able to discern crucial moral rules/natural laws

                Deny the Separability Thesis

                    The standard of validity in which a civil law must satisfy certain moral requirements

                Ronald Dworkin is an example proponent of this view

                    He thinks you need a moral justification for the use of coercion

Hart thinks command is an appeal to authority. You obey the command because you appreciate the authority, not merely because you fear punishment. You have a reason for obeying that command in accepting the authority. T

Chapters 2-4 of Hart’s book explains what is wrong with classical positivism



How is law different from orders and orders back by threats?

How is law related to morality?

What are rules and to what extent is law an affair of law? How are they different from habits and norms?



Austin’s Positivism-

Austin thinks a command is a coercive order. Hart doesn’t like this use.

Think about the coercive order of a gunman. Is that order a law? No. Well, why not? What is the difference between this and a law?

    The gunman talks to you directly, and to you alone. It only applies to you.

        In law, you might be expected to find it. Law might be promulgated through indirect means. Can’t confine law to merely a personal communication, but it should be public.

    Law applies to more people. It is a general order that everyone in a territory is expected to comply with.

        Gunman’s territory is perhaps too small. We think of a legal system as applying a significant territory. It can’t just be the locality of the gunman.

    There are no notions of an office for a gunman (no room for it is Austin’s theory, no office of the sovereign created by rules), but we might offices.

    Laws usually aren’t immediate, they stand or persist for a time, unlike the gunman’s order.

    Coercive orders don’t seem to apply to the gunman, maybe they can’t, but laws seem like they often should apply to everyone, including the issuer.

    Does the gunman have ultimate



    Standing

    General – order to general population

    Public – availability, disseminated publically

    Issued by a sovereign





When we think of the sovereign, for Austin, the sovereign is the foundation, the power to issue commands. People habitually obey the orders of the sovereign.



9/12/13

Simple Imperative Model – Austin

AN unlimited power sovereign over a region. People under his control habitually obey his coercive orders. The sovereign doesn’t habitually obey anyone else.

Any legal system has a sovereign.

Hart tries to make the coercive model of law as plausible as possible with his modifications (or charitable clarifications of the gun example).



Hart gives 5 objections to the imperative model (even the model he’s been as generous as possible towards):

Hart admits the model of coercive orders, as he teased it out, seems to capture something important about criminal laws, and laws that impose duties, and order us to do things, and they are backed up by a threat of punishment. E.g. don’t murder (except in self defense or other justification, you’ll be punished otherwise). Lots of laws do seem to fall in the coercive order model, but he thinks there is a difference between real criminal law.

Strictly speaking about coercive orders is distinct from rules.

    Varieties of laws beyond the simple imperative understanding

        E.g. power conferring laws – They seem to enable us to do certain things rather than disable us from doing something

            Don’t seem to apply to us unless we wish to have them apply, in some sense. We make choices about whether or not to exercise these powers.

            These don’t’ arbitrarily distributes powers to random citizens. To validly exercise the relevant power, a certain designated legal procedure must be followed.

            Law, in this case, can enable us to do things which we think are very useful.

            Apparently, we can always separate the power-conferring law from any punishments which might later be entailed by not following certain implications of that law (when that law is validly exercised).

                Hart is against mere penal law: “If you do P, then punishment Q”

                E.g. I buy a fridge – I’ve been given a power to buy it. But, is this a power I didn’t have before?

            Private legislators

                Power to make a contract

                    If we don’t follow the correct procedures, then we don’t make a valid contract.

                    Not like a coercive order though. You are never generally required to make a contract. Although, yes, once you enter into a contract, you may have coercive powers that enforce that contract.

                    Compare

                        Do X, or punishment Y.

                        Do X in situation Z (Z being something you have control over, a choice to put yourself in this situation), or punishment Y. (This seems to be the contract).

                        Why are these really all that distinct? Both can be universal duties, except that one is particularized to a situation. This is much like particularism in ethics. You can still have universal laws, they just happen to be highly specified, to the point that many people may never have to worry about those rules. The rule itself isn’t condition though – it applies to everyone, even if it won’t practically matter to most people.

                        Not all power-conferring laws have a coercive component though. I can see that.

                Create new rights and correlative duties

            Public legislators

        You at the power-conferring law from the perspective of the person who wants to do something.

            Voting is a solid example.

        External perspective – don’t’ need to know why the law is the way it is..or any reason not to do something the law forbids, but we obey it because we fear the punishment (and that is the only reason). Power conferring rules on different on this perspective, going more internal. Why would I want to exercise this power? Punishment is not involved. I’m not threatened with punishment.

    Unlike Coercive orders, laws can possibly apply to the lawmakers themselves

        Do laws have a “self-binding” quality?

        There may be reasons that certain laws don’t bind the lawmakers.

        Can’t understand without the internal perspective.

        Locke

            Trust model –we trust them, and they shouldn’t abuse the power entrusted to them.

    Some laws don’t seem to originate in the coercive orders of anyone; instead, some laws seem to originate in custom.

        Golden rule example, can be recognized as a custom and give validity to it. Not sufficient for the coercive models.

        Not sure this is a good one. It seems that a sovereign might tacitly consent or something. Maybe the judge making the interpretation is in part the sovereign (and so this objection is really just another one altogether).

    Habitual obedience to coercive orders is not adequate to explain the continuity and persistence of law.

        E.g. laws seems to be followed even after the personal sovereign has died.

        Rex 1 and Rex 2. Habitual obedience toward rex 1, while we think habitual obedience will go on toward rex 2.

        I don’t’ find this objection ot have much force. It seems to me that even the rex 1 dies, and his laws die with him, that doesn’t mean that he didn’t have laws qua habitual obedience. Laws, in my view, can be more fleeting, lacking continuity and persistence. Hart has a different intuition.

        I think Hart merely LIKES continuity and persistence. It is perhaps necessary to have these characteristics to have a good law (not that it is sufficient for having a good law).

        Why can’t Rex 1 issue a coercive order to follow Rex 2? Seems like he could, and that would be a problem, as it would be the continuity and persistence requirements, possibly.

        I think this objection tries to arbitrarily limit the character of law.

        Habit vs. Rule

            Habit

                Convergence of people’s behavior – a pattern of behavior

            Rule

                Convergence of behavior (same)

                Standard (justifiably criticized if you depart from the convergence) – internal point of view, if you deviate from the rule, then you are justification criticized – internal attitude is different than habit.

                Is this criticism a kind of coercion? Organized public stigma and humiliation for deviating form the rule seems coercive.

                Critical reflective attitude – you see that you ought to

                If you can’t enter into this internal attitude, and you don’t take it to be normative, then it isn’t a rule for you. Psychopaths might not have rules. If you don’t adopt it to be a rule, then it isn’t a rule. This might be a problem. It seems to be a rule, whether or not you see it or not.

                What is this normativity of rule if it isn’t moral? What if I deny normativity out of moral normativity? What then? I don’t understand “ought” outside it.

                It seems reasonable to think a good reason to follow a rule is to avoid punishment, but this is disallowed on Hart’s view. Just fearing punishment isn’t good enough, on his view. But, I don’t know why? Why “ought” outside of punishment being necessary to defin e a rule?

What is the normativity of law outside of the normativity of morality? Is normativity a necessary characteristics of laws in legal positivism? Seems like we are doing metaethics here.



9/19/13

Objections to the simple coercion model (??) – Hart against Austin:

    Variety of Laws

        Power-conferring –

            these rules themselves don’t impose any duty to follow a correct procedure. If you don’t’ follow the correct procedure in making a contract, then there aren’t any duties which come from it – and you won’t be punished for not following these procedures (odd for coercive law). But, further, you don’t have any duties in the first place to follow the procedure.

            Hart thinks Power-conferring rules are different from duty-conferring rules.

            We do want contracts to be enforced, of course. We want people tothinks that they really do have a duty imposition built into them. Coleman talks about having a duty to correctly follow the procedures.

    Habits of Obedience vs. Rules

        Consistency requires a rule for the succession of office.

        Distinction that is important between Habits and rules (from internal point of view):

            Even primary duty imposing rules are not like coercive orders that are habitually obeyed.

Last Objection (the 5th):

Question of the Sovereign

    Simple Imperative Model’s sovereign is legally unlimited entity (person or group of people). According to that model, every genuine legal system as a sovereign at the foundation of it (even if it is hard to find). Everyone habitually obeys the sovereign, but the sovereign does not habitually obey anyone else.

        The sovereign may accept certain conventions that aren’t regarded as laws. E.g. maybe he fears revolt, and doesn’t really make orders which would provoke the other people in his territory. E.g. the sovereign might just follow certain moral coventions.

    Hart argues against this model

        Can’t always find a sovereign.

            Written Constitution example (there are parts that are excempt form the article 5 amendment formula – e.g. can’t amend that a state gives up its two senators unless by the consent of that state). Imagine an unamendable constitution, since the constitution limits all other people’s powers legally, then there is no one or entity with unlimited power. This is odd though, as I still want to think about popular sovereignty as being at the heart of any enforceable unamendable constitution.

            Only one assembly. Popular sovereignty is not allowed by the strict interpretation of Austin’s view. Hart is unsympathetic to using pop sov as a way of justifying the Austinian model. It is too messy. It lacks a supreme ruler “feeling” to it.

            Hart want to draw a sharpline between pop sov and real unlimited sovereign model.

            Maybe there is a specific group of individuals that, if they came together, could decide to change the constistution (e.g. get rid of the 1st amendment). There seems to be a concentration of power in these people that might seem to look like Austinian sovereignty, even though there are intermediate steps.

        Sovereign might be bound by law – he is not legally unlimited in this sense.

        Power-conferring rules is conferring limited powers on officials, and also conferring/distributing disabilities = no-powers.

        Nobody has unlimited power. Checks and balances. Power-conferring rules are crucial to the limited powers. In principle, you could have a rule that sets up an office of the sovereign in accord with some rule of succession, etc.,

Pg. 77



Talk about Hart’s own theory:

Union of two kinds of rules – primary, duty imposing rules and secondary, power-conferring rules

It is in this union that we find the key to genuine legal systems and laws. It is not in the idea of coercive orders that the classical positivists (like Austin) had maintained.

Pg. 81

He identifies the two kinds of rules. Primary type, humans are required to do or abstain from certain actions, whether they want to or not.

Second rules are parasitic upon primary. Doing or saying certain things extinguish, modify, or control primaryrules.

The union of primary rules is a crucial foundation of the legal system. It is very necessary, although it isn’t sufficient. Hart is not laiming to give us a dictionary definition of law. Through analysis he is trying to clarify law, but he isn’t giving it to us on a plate. We have to go through the analysis to understand the features he has in mind and why.

You mayfeel obliged because you fear punishment, psychological attitude, fearing harm. This notion of feeling obliged is tied up with your self-interest….Hart has a different sense of obliged???

Hart thinks you can have an obligation without feeling obliged. I could have an internal attitude, endorse the standard, upon critical reflection I find it normative for my own conduct, and yet I might not feel obliged.

Hart wants to distinguish doing something as a result of feeling obliged out of notion of self interest and doing something because you feel you ought to do something (what he thinks is a genuine obligation). Maybe this distinction isn’t really successful.

I take it that this is descriptive. It doesn’t matter if you really ought to do something, that hasn’t anything to do with the law, but merely whether or not you have the feeling that you ought to…that is genuine obligation in a descriptive, non-normative sense.

Pre-legal primitive society – only primary rules, no secondary ones. Just duty imposing rules.



My question: Why is a description of law not just a subset of a descriptive, sociological, almost Darwinian view of ethics>? They seem to have a different kind of normativity that sits outside ethics (even a descriptive view of ethical normativity).



What are the defects of a pre-legal society?

    Uncertainty about primary rules (what they are and mean).

    Static society – not a lot of ways to change the rules? It lacks the mechanism for changing them.

    Decentralized enforcement, lacks governmental effectiveness and efficiency

Secondary rules correct these defects. Supplementing the primary rules is the remedy.

    Secondary rule of recognition (corrects problem 1)

        Gives a group of citizens the power to tell us what are valid legal rules in the system. The rule of recognition sets out certain criteria of validity, marks of what counts as a valid law. A rule which satisfies this criteria is a valid law in the legal system. Some officials are going to, by applying these criteria, be able to say “this rule is a law, and this one is not.”

            This only limits uncertainty. It doesn’t make the law entirely uncertain. In practice, it doesn’t seem to completely resolve uncertainty. How much uncertainty has to go away?

    Secondary Rule of Change (corrects problem 2)

        Give some group of officials the power to change the duty imposing rules.

        Implicitly connected to the rule of recognition because if you give a group of officials power to change primary laws, then you have to recognize that these legislators are a source of legal validity. If they follow the right procedure, then they’ve created new or different rules of our legal system.

    Secondary Rules of Adjudication (corrects problem 3)

        Judges have the power to adjudicate or settle disagreements or disputes over primary rules.

        Again, the people with this authority are recognized as a valid source of law. When a judge issues a decision resolving a dispute, that interpretation is a valid law (or modification of law, etc.).

        Note that even having many different local courts is possibly too decentralized without a supreme court.

All the secondary rules can be collapsed into a complex rule of recognition. It implicitly can have built into the rules of change and adjudication.



It seems to me that we might want a secondary rule of “executive power” for enforcement. It would confer power to people to enforce the rules, to take what legislators create and bring people (against their will, and coercively) to the courts. The problem seems to be that these aren’t rules about other rules exactly, is it?



The union of secondary rules (expressed in a complicated rule of recognition) and primary rules gives us a legal system. The rule of recognition – “How do you go about figuring out whether or not a rule is valid or not?” – this rule is the criterion of legal validity. If X craft Rule of recognition’s criterion of validity to by Y, then it seems like X is the real source or criterion of validity. Who gives X that power?

The rule of recognition is unusual. ROR is tied to a social practice, especially among officials. An ultimate rule of the system. It is closely connected to the fact that it is embedded in the practice of officials in the sense that officials more or less agree that when you try and figure out what a valid law is, your practice goes by this criteria.

I worry there is something circular about that. Is there a chicken or egg problem? What are some moves that allow us to go from pre-legal to legal? You need laws to confer power to officials, but then you need officials to make laws.

Coleman replies to this objection.

ROR is at the foundation of the system. It is ultimate in the sense that you can’t go behind that law. You have to stop at its criterion. But, again, I worry about this circularity objection. The people who create the criterion seem to be the real criterion.

RoR is a law from an internal perspective, but also an oberservable convergence behavior of officials. There are two ways of looking at it, according to Hart, that makes it distinctive.

This is like the problem of the criterion in epistemology (skepticism), right?

Infinite regress problem coming? I don’t know.

If the officials aren’t engaged in the practice of the RoR, then it doesn’t exist. Very descriptive and observable. Tied to social practices in a way that the other social laws are not tied to social practice.



Questions for Midterm-

Think about the difference between the ultimate ROR, the supreme criterion of legal validity (maybe a hierarchy of conditions of validity, but that hierarchy has priorities built into it, and the supreme one is supreme), and a sovereign (or even a legally unlimited legislature).

For rex1 and rex2, they are close. But for an advanced society like the US, they are very different. WTF is the supreme criterion?

When it comes to the social practice (Hart’s theory is sometimes called “the practiced theory of rules”), the type of practice is special because the normative attitudes of one official is dependent upon the attitudes of other officials. Most officials have to be engaged in the same. There is a collective interaction, apparently (although, I don’t see it). Lecture 7 in coleman’s book, conventionality thesis, and the fact that social practice is kind of like a coordinating convention where are attitudes are mutually dependent on another (like coordinating our cars while driving down the road). Shared cooperative activity.



9/26/13

Riley left last class by thinking about:

    ROR is ultimate.

    There is a supreme criterion or source of legal validity.

    Sovereignty, Austin’s sense…

May there is an ROR for Rex 1 that says there is an office of a sovereign, and whoever is the occupant, say rex, the ROR says whoever occupies this position of the sovereign, their enactments, whatever rules they make, are laws in this system. In such a simple system, these three things are very closely associated.

Take the US system:

What do we mean when we say the ROR is the ultimate rule? X is validated or justified by Y…so on, regress. ROR is bottom, stops that regress, it is the foundation. There is always something behind the non-ultimate rules which validate them, but there isn’t anything behind the ROR. Every other rule can trace their validity to the rule of recognition. The ROR sets out the sources. There is only one ROR, but many conditions, many criteria of validity as set out by the ROR.

ROR - > Social practice, convention

What is the rule of recognition? It is implicit (acc. to Hart). It could be embodied in written principle, but it need not. It could just be an implicit rule. To say what it is is to refer to this practice, the behavior of the officials in the legal system. What are their practices for identifying the legally valid rules of the system? That is the implicit ROR.

    Social practice (and rules)

        Internal statements

            E.g. This rule is a valid rule under the ROR. These are statements made by people within the system of rules.

        External statements

            A statement that could be made by an outside observer. They can see it is not just habits of behavior, but something more. Can they really see inside the internal state? Can they trust the word of the officials?

What does it mean to take on the internal perspective, and find a rule normative for you, to think you ought to follow it, but not find it to be a duty or obligation? Isn’t that what “ought” just means?

We can’t ask, what makes the ROR legally valid? I don’t see why not though.



Supreme Criterion of Legal Validity – The ROR sets out multiple criteria of legal validity, particularly in advanced of societies. E.g. the written constitution, statutes enacted by congress, decisions made by judges, customs can be valid laws too. – these are all sources of law. A well defined system puts these sources into a hierarchy. The supreme criterion demonstrates the priority of the sources or criteria of law. It resovles conflicts of legal validity.

E.g. of this prioritization: if congress follows the proper procedure, it is valid, until it comes before the supreme court, which may rule it unconstitutional. When the courts rule as such, then it overrules the congress.

ROR is forward looking. It gives you guidance as to figuring out what is valid. We can’t decide this merely at looking at past behavior. The ROR, in this sense, can’t be fully written down, and must be implicit.

The supreme criterion of legal validity is the ultimate aspect of the ROR. All other criteria for laws must meet and be shaped by the supreme criterion.

What makes criteria not a rule?

It seems arbitrary to talk about the ROR as being anything but the supreme criterion. The supreme criteria seems to be a tertiary rule about the secondary rules.

Supposedly, ROR can’t be reduced to mere social practice (even though normativity is somehow built into the social practice).

I don’t understand what it means to separate “is” from “ought” in soft positivism.

What about the relationship between sovereignty and the supreme criterion?



ROR – When it comes to recognition of social practice, the nature of it, these practices are coordinating conventions.



Hart doesn’t think power-conferring rules ??must or can?? impose duties (including the RoR). Hypothetical imperative…if you want to make this valid law, then follow this procedure. Officials have power to follow the procedure, to satisfy the hypothetical imperative, but they don’t have a duty to do so. Coleman disagrees. He thinks the ROR and power-conferring rules do impose duties. The idea is that you have a duty to exercise your power in the proper way. If you didn’t do your duty, you’d be punished by the other officials. He can do that without saying that officials have duties to make morally good laws, rather they just need to make laws.

Is Coleman saying that power-conferring laws MUST have duties attached to them, or merely that they CAN?





3 Kinds of Issues:

    How to classify ROR?

    Minimum conditions for existence of a genuine legal system

    Pathological Cases: Grey Areas



Look at chapter 6, where Hart says, “let’s accept my argument, what is crucial to a legal system?”

Pg. 112. Two ways to look at ROR. From perspective of people within the system of rules who accept the rules as reason sof r their actions, they make internal statements when describing the rules. From that perspective, the ROR is a valid law, it is implicitly treated as a law itself. The very existence of the ROR depends upon the social practice, without the practice there is no ROR. From the external perspective, it is just a fact, just a social practice. That isn’t an adequate view of the matter, but that is Hart’s view.



Pg 116-117, two conditions for genuine legal systems. (1) the rules that are recognized as legally valid by the officials, that are genuinely complied with by everyone in the society.

Important defect of genuine legal:

It is possible for there to be a genuine legal system where the officials are all engaged in this social practice (as to how they identify what counts as a valid rule), and they make immoral laws, and the ordinary citizens might be ignorant of th the secondary rules (don’t now much about the legal structure), and they may only comply because they fear punishment (not because these laws are rules or reasons for their own actions), and so the masses of the citizens can be like sheep. They don’t know how it works, and they can just comply out of fear of punishment, and this is unhealthy. Yet, it is valid.



Pathological cases…Revolution, Invasion, etc. Where the mass citizens are not complying with what the officials regard as valid laws. There is a question about whether or not a legal system exists. Can the officials be restored?

He thinks these cases are possible and explainable in his theory.

Ex: Maybe a mother country as a bunch of colonies. The ROR that is practiced in the colonies says the supreme criterion is the British Parliament. Maybe the British parliament makes a colonial government structure, and this is all accepted by the local officials. What if the colonies break off, no longer recognizing the British Parliament as the supreme criterion? The local officials don’t regard it this way. Maybe they follow the remaining sources, but not that supreme one. The local officials seem to be the break-away point. They seem to have the real ROR, and artificially grant that power to the British Parliament. Proximity seems to matter.

Law and Morality – as Hart see’s it

We can admit that Justice seems to be connected to morality, such as distribution concerns, fairness, compensation, etc.

Although, we might separate justice from morality in thinking that applying deeply immoral laws, correctly according the statutes, would be serving justice, qua the law itself, despite it being immoral to do so. Impartially applied nazi law might be “justice” in this sense, even though it seems far from justice in the moral sense.

Hart spends time trying to tell us what, in his view, is distinctive about moral rules. There are other rules in society besides moral rules.

4 cardinal features of morality –

(pg 173-)

    Importance

        You may have to sacrifice to follow the moral rule, and that might not be easy, so it better be important.

        We can see a legal rule (or rule of politeness, etc.) as unimportant, but we can’t find genuine moral rules to be unimportant.

        Perhaps breaking a parking law just isn’t immoral. Some legal rules just aren’t important or they are trivial, unlike moral laws.

        Some people might not agree with Hart, and instead claim that once a law was in place, it becomes a moral issue. One should follow the law because it is a law. The law extends morality.

        Not everyone thinks that Hart is right about importance distinguishing moral rules from other kinds of rules.

    Immunity from deliberate change

        Legal rules may be introduced by deliberate enactment, but moral rules are not subject to deliberate change by enactment.

    Voluntary Character of moral offenses

        You’ve done something immoral only if you’ve done it deliberately. You can be excused for violating a moral principle if you didn’t really intend to violate it. However, it isn’t clear that you can be excused for the law, even if violated involuntarily – law can employ a sense of strict liability.

        Mens Rea – Guilty Mind

    Differing forms of pressure

        Later Hart claims: Legal punishment, only legal sanctions, are the only true punishment. Moral rules don’t have punishment in the same way. They are external.

        Moral pressure, the kind of criticism one receives from breaking a moral rule, comes from internal perspective. The criticism is about being ashamed, about feeling like your character is flawed, about not being a good person who does good things for good reasons, about feeling guilty when you break a moral rule, etc.

        Appeal to moral rules being important in themselves

        Internal rather than external sanctions.



Minimum content of Natural Law

Hart admits that there is something true, something common sensical about the natural law theory, in the sense that at least a certain minimum content is found in both the legal system and the moral code in advanced societies.

There are legal rules against murder and theft; and there are moral rules against these things. There is overlap in the content of these sets of rules.

Contingent human desire for survival – in order to survive, you need certain rules to be in place. Survival principles, as content, seem to be found both in moral and legal rules. Nazi example, nazi rules are distorted in the sense that the definition of humans is limited, excluding certain groups of people. It helps the Aryans survive. Minorities were “conspiring” to destroy true German society, and so furvor against the minority groups comes from perhaps the notions of survival.

Pg 193

4 types of rules:

    Rules of Property

        Guarantee your survival through owning the fruits of your labor and trade

        Tend to appear in both moral and legal realms.

    Rules of Personal safety

        Prevents you from being harmed, raped, killed, etc. – show up in both realms as well. Associated with survival.

    Rules of Promising/Contracting

        Can’t lie, fraudulently lead people into false contracts

    Rules of Punishment

These kinds of fundamental rules appear in both systems, there is overlap regarding survival.

The separation thesis is consistent with an overlap between the content of moral rules and legal rules.

5 truisms – ch 9 – contingent features of human beings and the world we live in:

    Human vulnerability

        Vulnerable to attack, we can be killed, catch disease, etc.

    Approximate equality

        Not huge differences

        One person can’t ignore everyone else (hobbes)

    Limited Altruism

        Just a fact, acc. to Hart, that we are selfish creatures

        Can’t really expect us to sacrifice our self-interest to help others

    Scarcity of Resources

        The world is such that valuable resources are source, command a price, etc.

    Limited Understanding

        Cognitively imperfect, bounded rationality

        Prone to weakness of will (seems like “limited cognitive function” or maybe something of its own)

These contingent facts could have been otherwise, Hart thinks.

Most people want to survive. We have rules which make it more likely. It is a contingent fact that we desire to survive. We could have been otherwise.

Hart is emphasizing the idea of minimal content, which is versus teleological view of classical (metaphysical) natural law theory. Hart doesn’t buy into this perspective.



The term “right” applies, misleadingly, to so many different legal positions.

Right = claim

Being under the position of a claim holder, in the legal system.



Hohfeldian classification of fundamental jural positions:



First-Order position under the Law

Claim vs. No-Claim

Claim

I have a claim on the society for the protection for some interest or concern that I regard as important. E.g. a claim not to be attacked; a claim to property I’ve created or labored for…

no-claim

No-claim position is a position in which you have no claim.



Liberty vs. Duty

Liberty

A privilege, a permission. A liberty to do X means I don’t have any obligation not to do that X. Liberty is the same as not having a Duty to do X.

A unilateral liberty – liberty to X is compatible with a duty to do X.

Liberty to X, which is compatible with the Duty to X, but opposite of the Duty to ~X

Liberty to ~X, which is compatible with the Duty to ~X, but opposite of the Duty to X.

Bi-lateral liberty – a liberty to do or not to do X – fully incompatible with a duty to do or not to do X

I could have the liberty to do X, and others might also…e.g. applying for a job. No obligation to not apply for it (or to apply for it, perhaps, in this case). Other people can have that same liberty. The competition between us may result in me not getting the job. It is not like a claim where my interests have to be protected.

Just because I have a liberty doesn’t mean others don’t have a duty to not interfere. Although, often liberties are buttressed indirectly by duties.

Naked liberty (just no obligation not to do something) vs. Liberties backed up by claims.

Duty

An obligation to do or not to do something.



Power vs Disability

Power

The ability to change people’s claims, duties, and liberties (first order positions under the law).

E.g. A contract to sell my car. Duty to sell my car at a certain price when I make a contract. Claim to buy it at a certain price from me for my contractee.

Disability

No-power. Not having power.



Immunity vs. Liability

Immunity

Immune from having some set of rights, claims, or liberties from being altered.

Liability

The position of being liable to have my existing rights, duties, and liberties altered by someone with power to do so. I’m not immune.



Presenting logical correlates, instead of opposites.

Claim/Duty

A person has a claim iff some set of people have correlative duties.

Liberty/No-Claim

A person has a liberty to do X iff other people have correlative position of no-claim that the person not do that (i.e. that person doesn’t have a duty not to do X).

Power/Liability

A person has a power iff other people have a correlative liability to have their existing claims/liberties/duties changed.

Immunity/Disability

A person has immunity iff other people have a correlative position of no-power, essentially a disability, to alter that person’s claims/liberties/duties.



Claim relates to Liberty analogously to how power relates to immunity.

If I have a liberty, then I have freedom from other people’s claims (they have no-claim).

If I have immunity, then I have freedom from other’s people powers (they are disabled).



We can articulate Freedom from and freedom to (in Berlin’s sense) using these Hohfeldian concepts.





Competing theories of (legal?) rights:

    Interest Theory of Rights (a.k.a. benefits theory)

        Kramer, some utilitarians, etc.

        A right is a claim to protect a vital interest of mine

            A right gives me an important benefit. If I hold the right, then I am the beneficiary of that claim. I am really benefiting from society protecting it.

            E.g. I might have an interest with respect to liberty to not be interfered with in some coercive conduct.

        The rightholder has to benefit from a claim…why the fuck would that be true?

            Benefit doesn’t have to be some personal sense – making me richer, etc. ideas of my own self-interest. Benefit can extend beyond that.

                E.g. maybe I have rights to fulfill the duties of my public official office. The interest theory can be extended to show I have an interest simply to perform the acts of my office, even if it isn’t personal in some sense.

        The Focus of the interest theory is on getting this protection to important interests, leaving open the question of which interests are really important (Maybe utility, or whatever…there are a range of interest theories for selecting important interests).

        Refers to Hohfeld’s framework. A right is just a claim, a claim to protect certain interests.

        No logical relationship between first order jural positions and second.

    Choice theory of rights (a.k.a. the will theory)

        Steiner Rejects the interest theory – also H.L.A. Hart agrees to this view as well

        A right is claim + the power to enforce the duties that are correlative with the claim.

            Having a right is a complex position. You need both components.

                How successful do you need to be in enforcing?

            The power to wave the duties correlated to the claim.

        Have to be able to choose in accord with their rights. They have to have some control over some set of actions with respect to a right.

        Under choice theory, if I have a right, then others have correlative duties and liabilities.

        There is a logical relationship between first and second order jural positions.

            Legal systems are those which actually work. You need auxiliary legal support to have rights.

            The work conception of rights means that there are more than just the correlations we’ve identified in the system

Working Theory of Rights/Law, Steiner’s theory, extension of Hohfeldian Conceptual analysis and logical correlatives:

    Power -> Liberty to exercise that power

        Kramer thinks supreme court justices might have powers that they have duties not to exercise.

    Liability -> no-claim not to have the correlative power exercised

    Disability = no-power, thus Disability -> lack of liberty to exercise a power

        Disability -> duty not to exercise power [which they don’t have] (fucking weird way of saying it)

        Disability -> others have claim rights that the power not be exercised

    Immunity = not liable, thus Immunity -> claim not to have the correlative power exercised

This means that Kramer?? thinks that a right is a claim, a power, and a liberty to exercise that power

My thoughts: Why should we define our concepts the way we do? We need ethical reasons, and reasons that serve ethical theories, basically.



1st stage –demand fulfillment of duties (if don’t voluntarily, no need to do anything else)

2nd stage – if not voluntarily fulfilled, then get a relevant official to bring this person to court.

3rd stage – if a trial is held, and it has been decided that you’ve fulfilled your duties, then you are punished.

If IP isn’t enforceable, then it isn’t IP rights aren’t really rights, based on Steiner’s theory.















Power -> Liberty

Liability -> no-claim against the holder of the correlative power

Disability = no-power -> duty not to do what one has a disability to do



Argument against the working interpretation….Supreme court example:

You can have the legal authority to make a bad ruling or interpretation, but you have a duty not to make a bad ruling or interpretation. Hence, you won’t have a liberty to use that power in a certain way, that is, you don’t have a liberty to make a bad ruling or interpretation.

That seems, at best, to be a moral judgment. You “ought” not make a bad ruling from a moral perspective is just wildly different from a legal claim to not being able to do it.





Choice-working conception

Interest theory deny working conceptions entailments between the secondary and primary jural positions.





Kramer – Rights are just claims. You don’t need to be mentally competent or rational. Just as long as you have interests, you could theoretically be protected by a right. For Kramer, because he rejects the working conception, has some odd things falls out.

Will theorists think only minimally rational agents can have rights.

Kramer accepts Hohfeld’s framework. One of the crucial aspects of Hohfeld’s is the ‘correlativity thesis’.

Legal duties always imply legal claims. Legal duties <-->legal claims (claims =rights). There is always a correlation between duties of an individual and rights of other individuals.

Critics of Hohfeld’s thesis here, think that there can be absolute legal duties. For instance, one might argue the duty to pay income taxes is not correlative to any individual right. Can a person take me to court for not paying my taxes? If not, then I don’t have a duty to them to pay my taxes.

Duties are only those sorts of thing for which one can be taken to court by the person towards which you have the duty.?? Why is that true. Can’t I just report the person to the IRS? The IRS speaks on my behalf, in a sense. Not all duties are enforceable either. Maybe I can’t take them to court,but that doesn’t mean I don’t have a right.

I have a duty not to litter. If someone else watches me litter, they can’t take me to court over it, but they can report it to the enforcers of law, who can then perhaps take me to court.



Kramer extends Hohfeld by saying that in addition to individual claims, there can be irreducible group/collective rights. Where the large group is society, for example. Irreducible right of the collectivity. Individual duties are not merely correlative to claims of other individuals, but it could be claims of a collectivity. Agents can be collective identities, it seems.



One case that brings about many aspects of the the interest theory??:

    The case of third-party beneficiaries

        Under the interest theory, a claim holder, a right protects the interest of the claim holder, so rights need to be beneficial to the holders. If you had a right which wasn’t good for you, it was actually detrimental, then under the interest theory, we don’t’ want to call that a genuine right.

            Will theorists aren’t committed to this idea that rights are to the benefit of the claim holder.

        Consider a person who has made a contract to send flowers to a third-party. The idea is that the beneficiary is the third party. It seems like the person who made the contract has the right, but he isn’t benefiting (apparently). I have the power to waive fulfillment of a duty of the flower seller to fulfill the contract, or the power to take them to court to demand fulfillment. The person who made the contract seems like the right holder.

            Why can’t you be interested in having someone deliver the flowers? Both the person receiving and the contract makers (the buyer) has interests here.

            Oddly, Riley is arguing that the beneficiary, because they benefit, has a right on the interest theory. I don’t see why that is true. I see why the contract maker has a right (and an interest), but not why the third party has a right. It seems like the flower shop as a duty TO the contract maker to give flowers to someone else.

        How do we identify which interests deserve rights and which don’t?

            Seems to me: that Claim->interest, but not interest->claim

            Take another 3rd party case, where I take out a loan for my brother get 10k. Brother benefits, and I suppose I do as well. Does it make sense to say he has a right to this money because he is benefiting? What if my brother is spending 9k of it on furniture, then it seems like the furniture shop owner is really benefiting. Does he have a right under the interest theory? And so on. Do they all rights?

                I took the interest theory to be weeding out which things we are tempted to call claims are genuine claims, and that is when a claim actually benefits the claim-holder. I don’t see the interest theory as really going around sifting through the benefits out there to decide which benefits count are protected by claims. Riley thinks the latter is the case.

                If the brother’s interest isn’t satisfied, then that is sufficient to tell us that the contract has no been fulfilled. On the other hand, the owner of the furniture store, if his interest in having the 9k spent in his store is denied, that isn’t sufficient to say the contract was not fulfilled.

                    I want to say that if my brother’s interest isn’t fulfilled, then mine, as the loan-taker, isn’t fulfilled. My brother’s interest being fulfilled is sufficient for mine. My interest still seems to be the real test, and my brother’s interest is coincidental.

                Bentham’s Test – if not satisfying an interest is not sufficient for telling us that something is wrong with the fulfillment of the contract, then it isn’t an interest backed by a claim.

                    This tests sifts through interests to find those which are actually salient to the contract.

    Intuitively appealing aspect of interest theory when compared to the will theory

        Children, mentally competent people, animals, fetus, etc. cannot have will theory rights

            Will theory might argue a “future like ours”

            Will theory might argue that parents or those on behalf the child kinds have what we call the children’s rights

            They don’t have the competence to use the powers, someone must exercise on behalf of the child. So, they don’t have complete rights.

            Child is not a right-holder, but maybe they have a claim??

            Doesn’t seem like the interest-theory can demonstrate that the child can/should exercise powers of the right either.

                Although, I don’t see why all rights have to be alienable or exercisable.

                Why should we agree that you need power to have a right? Maybe there are different classes of claim rights. Some have a power to exercise, and others do not.

                Claim just means you can justifiably blaim, but it doesn’t mean you will be mentally capable of it, nor that you can enforce it.

        Will theory rights cannot be “inalienable”

            You’ve got to have the power to demand fulfillment or waive fulfillment on the will theory, but some rights can’t be given up on the interest theory, it seems.

            Will theory will argue this is just paternalism. You are telling me that you know better than I know what is good for me. Will theory says I have to be in control over my rights.

                You have to think paternalism is a bad thing, otherwise, that will theory isn’t very persuasive for you.

                Inalienable right to waive your rights…lel

        Ordinary citizens do not have Will theory rights against crimes

            Will theory: We don’t have any power to demand it is fulfilled. The rightsholders are the state officials.

            Kramer thinks that is crazy to say that the officials are the rightsholders.

            Will theorist doesn’t think we need to bring in the collective rights notion

    Interest theory has better explanation of rights correlative to public duties such as a duty to pay taxes, i.e. duty is correlative with irreducible collective right to receive taxes.

        Will theorist can just say that the officials in charge are the ones with the duties and rights. The official has the power to collect and the power to waive.

    Will theory (not just the Interest theory) is “thinly evaluative” (and not merely descriptive, formal)

Smuggling in moral concepts into legal ones.





Seems to me that they are injecting moral notions into legal concepts. The definitions of legal concepts can’t have this if we are to be legal positivists.

Laws generate some sort of jural position. All jural positions can be talked about in terms of claim rights (although the interest theory wants to deny this). All laws are reducible to some set of claim rights. Claim rights are, by definition, only in existence if there is a beneficiary. Benefits seem to be a moral concept. It seems to me that there are no laws which aren’t definitionally tied up in the moral concept of benefiting on the interest theory. It seems like a natural law theory moreso than a legal positivist’s theory. Can benefits be non-moral? Assuming benefit means a kind of prudential good, I don’t see how.



What is an example of something we are tempted to call a right but doesn’t actually benefit the supposed-right-holder?







    Will Theory

        Duties under the criminal law

            State officials have the rights

                Ordinary citizens don’t have a claim right against that you not commit a crime against them

                Ordinary citizens can’t even waive rights

        Public duties to pay income taxes

            Correlative rights are in state officials, e.g. the IRS – the head of the IRS has the ability to waive the duty or demand fulfillment

        Constitutional duties – Duties under a limited constitution

            Some state official might be all powerful??

    Interest Theory

        Duties under the criminal law

            Ordinary citizens have correlative claims

            State officials still have important roles to play, adjudicating, enforcement, legislating, etc.

                Those duties of officials are correlative to a claim or right of the collectivity.

            Kramer thinks the Will theory has it wrong, because we ordinarily talk about individuals having rights, not the officials, ultimately.

        Public duties to pay income taxes

            Admits they don’t owe taxes to any individual. But is that the point? If I have a duty to pay my taxes, that doesn’t mean my taxes have to go toward someone. This is a third party kind of argument, perhaps.

            Irreducible collective claim = right

        Constitutional duties – Duties under a limited constitution

            Constitution is a power conferring rule – it assigns and limits powers.

            You might have the disability to take away certain immunities of ordinary citiziens

                Maybe there is immunity to claim right to not be murdered

                Immunity for that immunity of that claim right to not be murdered??



Steiner argues these three issues are conceptual issues. Steiner might also be arguing against some moral objections that some might have against the Will theory.

Will theory isn’t denying that children don’t have claims. Children just aren’t competent to exercise the powers. Children have nominal claims at best on their view. The state officials, however, hold the rights for the children, in a sense.

Will theory thinks claim rights are “claims + powers”

What powers do you have to be in order to be a will-theory right-holder? State officials seem to have these powers:

    Powers:

        The pairs of sub-powers (elaborating on HLA Hart)

        First pair – Ex Ante (before the event – before the crime is committed)

            Power to waive fulfillment of duties ex ante

                If you exercise this power, the rest of the powers disappear in that instance?

                    Why? Isn’t just waiting to demand the same as waiving temporarily?

            Power to demand fulfillment of duties ex ante

                Some people think officials always have a duty to demand fulfillment, and hence don’t have a liberty to waive, and thus they might not have the power

        Second pair – Ex Post (after the event – after the crime is committed)

            Power to waive taking the wrongdoer to trial

                Decline to charge someone

            Power to demand/take the wrongdoer to trial

        Third Pair – Ex Trial

            Power to waive enforcement or fulfillment of punishment/sentence

            Power to demand enforcement or fulfillment of punishment/sentence

Will Theory is saying officials have a claim rights associated with their office, and these pairs of powers to waive of demand fulfillment of claims over time.

Under the Will Theory, it is possible for an official to delegate some of his powers to others. So, these various pairs of powers might be delegated. Delegating under certain conditions…senior official can say, if I don’t like the way you use your power, then they can take it away. There can be a hierarchy of officials with delegation. But, the senior officials can revoke that trickle down of delegated powers and retain all the powers for themselves.

Maybe the head of the IRS is the only official with all these Will Theory powers. He delegates, and only he has them. Maybe it is only the president. Whatever.

Maybe a subordinate official has a disability, a no-power --- correlative to --- a senior official has a correlative immunity

There can be a chain of disabilities and immunities.

Nobody has unwaivable immunity. Someone has the power to waive their own immunities. If this is true, then the 3 pairs is possible.

IF there was an unwaivable immunity,

Is he begging the question? Is he forcibly making room for the Will Theory?

Why can’t we think of, in principle, as a conceptual matter, any legal system such that nobody has all the powers (even with delegation in mind) that the Will Theory requires? If we can conceive of it, it seems to be a counterexample to the claim of the Will Theory’s conception of rights.

Will Theory Right – Claim + set of 3 pairs of powers associated with that claim



A couple of objections that Steiner levels against the extended Hohfeldian view that public duties are correlative to ireeductible collective claim rights.

    Collectivity as a whole = Unempowerable entity

        Just as children/animals aren’t competent, the irreducible collectivity lacks the competence to exercise powers

        Collective delegates powers to officials.

    Situation of a son and his parents

        2 possible scenarios

            Son has a duty to support his parents in their old age

            Son has a duty to inform on his parents if they engage in seditious activities

                This may be a public duty of some sort. The interest theory is not going to say the parents have a correlative claim to be informed upon.

                Kramer handles this by saying the son has a duty to the collectivity. Society/collectivity may have an interest.

                    What really is a good for the society?

            Will Theory handles these scenarios:

                State officials have the will theory rights

        Steiner has there is no chance of getting a set of compossible rights.

            Too many conflicts of rights in the collectivity. Can’t figure out, in principle, who has the relevant powers, claims, etc.



Moral Objections

Lifeboat example – people notice someone is in trouble, there is a boat the people at the shore could take, but the boat is owned by a will-theory right-holder. All legal rights, under positivism, are subject to, but not logically bound to, moral criticism. The right holder can deny it. The Will-Theory right holder can insist on morally wrong use of the boat.

Peremptory – will theory rights are not necessarily morally peremptory, overriding, the most important of all considerations. The duties claimed in will theory rights…

Lifeboat example



Will theory rights and correlative duties are not morally peremptory.



The Concept of Political Authority/Power

    Kramer

        Power (Hohfeldian sense)

            Having a power doesn’t really mean you have the power to use it

            Nominal powers exist, just powers on a paper, since you may have a duty not sue them.
