* Parts aren't in. They will soon enough though. =)
* Keep eating healthily. I think would you benefit from not eating late at night, [[h0p3]].
* [[Power]]'s a beast. Huge topic, branching fucking everywhere.
** It may take a while. Don't worry about that.
** The letters are going to have to sit for quite a while.
* Lentil Soup sounds amazing.
* Heavy rain, so think more about your wife.
* Keep working with all the kiddos. Do your best.
