!! Audit:

* More tickler and talking to myself.
* There's predigestion going on here.
* This feels asynchronous and gunky.
* I think I'm coming up for air here in some respects.
* Humor helps, but forgiveness cures.
* 10,000 things. I think I'm narrowing them down.
** I also feel like my brother [[JRE]] here.
* I've pushed to use DCK, and I did. It took quite a bit of work to tip the scales.
* Yet another month of failure on m16.
** But, not absolute failure. I did try. It's just going super slowly.
* I think I'm feeling depressed as I read this.
** DCK might not be fixing it either.
* This month has been the least painful of [[TDL]]'s to read.
** I don't feel like an abject failure. There is progress here.
** I am, once again, grateful to [[Sphygmus]]'s self-modeling here.
* Why does the month feel so distant to me?
** Has the time dilation thing going on.
* My lack of discipline and executive functioning is apparent. 
** Keep going, homie.
