title: 2020.01.11 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Meaningful Life

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
A meaningful life...is distinct from a happy life or a morally good one...“meaning arises when subjective attraction meets objective attractiveness.” A meaningful life must, in some sense then, feel worthwhile. The person living the life must be engaged by it. A life of commitment to causes that are generally defined as worthy — like feeding and clothing the poor or ministering to the ill — but that do not move the person participating in them will lack meaningfulness in this sense. However, for a life to be meaningful, it must also be worthwhile. Engagement in a life of tiddlywinks does not rise to the level of a meaningful life, no matter how gripped one might be by the game.

Brilliant, as usual.<<ref "w">> I see no reason to buy this definition of a meaningful life, but I appreciate it. There's at least something correct about it (that you aim to maintain some concept of [[The Objective]] is non-trivial), but there's also a deep slip in here (one which would be convenient to pass over). I have to sound uncharitable now to point to it, and I'm sorry. Meaningful to whom? I think you are trying to have your cake and eat it too here.

Surely this is only a //kind// of meaning or meaningful life, and we ought not hand over the entire word, unless you just mean it only in a sense (as you say). Why can't something be meaningful even without Dasein? It's not that meaning only arises under those conditions, but I'll agree that the objectivity truth of "subjective meaning arises" in at least some of those cases. Surely you mean to speak of subjective meaning which is objectively meaningful, but what isn't objectively meaningful at all? Note the difference between experiencing/understanding meaning/meaningful lives and the factual state of affairs of that meaning obtaining without an observer. You still have to give me reasons to think subjectivity is conceptually necessary for meaningful lives (especially since we can be wrong) in this respect.

What does it mean for subjective attraction to meet objective attractiveness (i.e. [[The Good]], or its constitutive parts, [[The Right]] or [[The Beautiful]])? Can't it meet it poorly, ineffectively, incorrectly, unfittingly in [[dok]]? And, therefore, when doesn't it meet it? My first criticism is that you may be elevating and placing too much emphasis on the subject's perspective (while at the possibly denying the ontic status of that perspective when it doesn't meet your conditions of Reason in your other work). 

What kind of meaning //ought// we pursue? You are attempting to point to a lack of objectively necessary meaning in the sad philanthropist in virtue of his lack of corresponding affect and subjective attraction. I'll agree that, all else being equal, it would be better if the sad philanthropist met all the conditions of [[The Moral Law]] and wasn't sad about it. Who wouldn't want to experience [[awe]] in every moment of every day? Why can't I say that you don't have a really, really meaningful life unless you live in pure [[awe]] and bliss every second (I'm taking that fulfillment to the Nth degree, and you have to show me why it doesn't slide down this slope)? Surely, you have to see that subjectivity cannot be first or the final cause of meaning, it is only a means. Meaning is objective and external to us, even if we subjectively instantiate it as tokens.

The sad philanthropist's experience and choices are still meaningful, even if it isn't as [[good]] or [[beautiful]] (though definitionally just as [[right]]) as the happy philanthropist's. It's not there isn't a meaning, the valence does not change, but the normative semantics varies. Hitler had a meaningful life, and it meant something profoundly evil. You are pulling the Scholastic Slip here, as you do with Freedom; I see no reason to hand you it in full. 

My second criticism is that you've, yet again, failed to make sense of the meaning of what we initially take to be the meaninglessness and deprivation of evil. Let me point you in the right direction again: What is worth suffering for? How do you walk through fire [[irwartfrr]]?
