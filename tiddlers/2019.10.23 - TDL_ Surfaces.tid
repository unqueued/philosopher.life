title: 2019.10.23 - TDL: Surfaces

* Living room surfaces require cleaning. 
** Either solve the trash crisis or start selling gas. No wildcards.
* Crack whips. Lawdy.
* IASIP is hitting the spot.
** Cycling again.
* Roast. Haven't had corned beef in a while.
* Wife asked for new blackboard goal.
** Clip a wing: "MAIL IT!" to "NAIL IT!"
*** Though, unlikely. Most unfortunate given her anime librarian girl outfit. =) 
* Write, please.
