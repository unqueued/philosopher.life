title: 2017.02.16 -- Realpolitik Speculation: Democratic Hypocrisy on Whistleblowing

//This one is hateful. I'm right, but that doesn't mean I will be convincing. I take this to be a useful opportunity to blow off steam.//

I am amazed at the public's backlash against whistleblowers. You people are fucking retarded, and I hate you all (even as I attempt to empathize with you [as you can see, I'm failing in this moment {or perhaps, I'm empathizing so well with you that I'm literally saying what you'd say, in the way you'd say it, if you knew what I knew]). You are part of the problem. It's one thing for your stupidity to cause you and you alone to suffer and die. It's an entirely different thing for your malicious ignorance to cause everyone else to suffer and die. What gives you the right to be like you are? I have no power over your malicious ignorance. 

I want to scream at you all: don't you see the difference between morality and legality!? The legal positivists are right, and therefore the rule of law is still fundamentally a joke.<<ref "1">> Godwin's Law time: Hitler and Nazi Germany had a conceptually legitimate government. That doesn't mean we should do what they say, that doesn't mean we are unconditionally, normatively bound by their laws, and so on. Apply that reasoning, for the love of god, before we all suffer and die. I would stomp a hole in St. Paul's ass regarding this if I could (you aren't looking so hot yourself either, Jesus<<ref "2">>); that brilliant dickhole saw one mountain, but none of the mountains behind it (thanks for that).

The DNC and far too many democrats I know have consistently opposed and sought to punish/prevent whistleblowing.<<ref "3">> This was especially obvious when a Democratic president, Obama, was in charge. The DNC are wolves, and democrats sheep (fear not, I have even harsher opinions about the RNC and their pig-slaves). Now that Trump is president, the DNC and the democrats I know sing a completely different tune about whisteblowing. They are all for it now. They see the value in it only when it suits them. Hypocrites and psychopaths, the lot of you. Your lack of even trying for ideal idealism disgusts me.

You buy that aphorism: information is power. Who do you wish to empower? Who should you really fear? What does it take to have a functioning democracy? Don't you see the necessity of whistleblowing? Don't you see the real enemy? Of course not. You are a fool.

We are fighting capitalism, the Hyperclass, deep states, dark money, mind-control,<<ref "4">> multi-national political entities, and the idiocy of humanity. The punks and hippies were telling you the truth before they were corrupted and swallowed up. It's the "system," man. Truth is everything. Transparency is key. Sunlight is the only disinfectant. Whistleblowing is a necessary condition to our freedom, political equality, economic opportunity, and happiness.

Look through the history of whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are not perfect people, but they are almost always heroes. They are people who sacrificed immensely for you. Look how you repay them! You know what, I have every right to be angry with you. You are, in no small part, the reason this world sucks and the reason I'm unhappy. Fuck you, and please KYS.

<<footnotes "1" "It seems only the virtuous, which often doesn't include me, really know when to apply the rule of law.">>

<<footnotes "2" "I can think of a couple gnostic interpretations of Jesus that allow him to escape this criticism. Odds are that you don't give a shit about that though. I'm sure you know what Jesus 'really' meant.">>

<<footnotes "3" "Inevitably, there are fools who think the 'proper channels' are the normatively appropriate channels by definition. Again, please see the moral/legal distinction.">>

<<footnotes "4" "Let's be clear: telepathy and supernatural means of manipulating objects and minds are bullshit. There is no radical neurosurgery (at least not yet). And, yet, memetic conditioning and mind-control are quite real. Classic rhetoric was only the beginning. We have honed it, technologized it, and created mind-weapons. The power in the hands of the few is breathtaking.">>
