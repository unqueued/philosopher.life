title: 2019.03.15 - Charlie: Multiverse Dialectic

Charlie is feeling unwell, but he seems to be recovering.

We talked about autism and the infinitesimal short-circuit. It bothers him to death too. 

Projection, spirality, reflection, observers, thing-in-itself, and simulation. We talked a lot of Kant and CERN; the intersection is hilarious and intense. Yet again, we wished we recorded the conversation. It branches too fast. I'm going to have to start taking notes while we talk, but I need to walk while we talk. I can't be still. 

It was a 2.5 hour conversation, and I only have fragments left. We both continue to say it. Why does he not have any interest in writing it down outside the conversation?
