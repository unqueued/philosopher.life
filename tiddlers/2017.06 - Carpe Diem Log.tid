!! Audit:

* This is my first month writing this log. I decided that my other logs were too specific, and in a way, I needed basic/standard journal/diary information.
* I tended to write about what made my day great, worth living, and what I was most grateful for. I really felt blessed writing many of these.
* Ideally, this log should be written at the end of the night, but I often found that I would write this log somewhere in the evening and project into the future/plan, the rest of my evening. Most of the time, I write this log only after the work of the day has been done and I have time to chillax. I think this is the best method for now.
* I had a lot of sex this month. Yay!
** I also had a lot of fireman time. Yay!
* It was clearly a very busy month for me. I accomplished quite a bit, and while I felt uncertain, it seemed work out well.
** Take risks! Manage your anxiety!
