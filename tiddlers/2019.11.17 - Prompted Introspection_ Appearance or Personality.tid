title: 2019.11.17 - Prompted Introspection: Appearance or Personality

!! What is more important to you, appearance or personality?

Wait, what's the difference again? XD. Yeah, this is one of those questions for a [[PSM]]: [[2017.06.19 - Prompted Introspection Log]]. There I go helping myself again to that which I cannot define clearly enough, lawdy. There's no escaping appearance, and there are limits to the extent that we can even know our own motivation, which is also an appearance. It's a matter of [[faith]]. Insofar as personality might be closer to the thing-in-itself as it relates to [[The Moral Law]], clearly that one is more important. We wade through an endless layering of appearances, and toward what, [[gfwiwcgws]]?
