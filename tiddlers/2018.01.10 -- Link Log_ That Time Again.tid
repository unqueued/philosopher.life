title: 2018.01.10 -- Link Log: That Time Again

* Stunning!
** https://www.the-american-interest.com/2014/06/15/the-twin-insurgency/
*** Holy fuck is that well-written!

* KYS

* Preach, yo!
** http://genocide.org/the-grief-exception-diversity-causes-depression/
*** I have to say, it really fucking pissed me off when people acted like I didn't have a right to be depressed, like somehow it was something wrong inside me and not the world. Assholes. You are the problem.
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/15/the-psychology-of-inequality
*** This was a weak argument, and yet still good enough.
** http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-1616-rubbish.html-2
*** Go you, homies!

* Confirm My Bias
** https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/your-smartphone-is-making-you-stupid/article37511900/
*** And, yet, we still watch a show together while we eat. Although, mind you, it is a rule in a our house that we talk about what we are watching. We commonly pause (I do so more than others, I must admit). 
*** Our computers are deeply integrated into everything we do. I'm not sure if we can truly even be ourselves without our screens. Sometimes, I use my screen to help me even say the correct words to someone. Is it wrong to think there might be a middle way? For example, reading each other's wikis is often the most direct line of sight method to understand someone. Obviously, we need to practice socializing outside such a clean window as well. This is tricky.

** https://www.vox.com/2018/1/8/16822374/school-segregation-gerrymander-map
*** Even as homeschoolers, we are obviously very worried.

** https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7phuvm/my_last_90_days_of_gay_social_apps_oc/
*** Stereotypes exist for a reason...=(...still, very interesting data set. Dick pics are ineffective.


* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.eater.com/2018/1/5/16853818/rotisserie-chicken-costco-grocery-stores-price
*** I feel stupid. That is so obvious.
** https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/7p6tx4/what_is_the_deal_with_evolutionary_psychology/
*** There's not hope for them.
** https://captaincapitalism.blogspot.com/2018/01/how-western-governors-university-will.html
*** Ah, good to get smacked in the face with their insanity once in a while. That is a terrible argument, lol. There are so many things I can't just learn on my own or in a digital classroom. There are reasons I needed to develop scholastic relationships in vulnerable in-person settings with my teachers. Hubert Dreyfus was right.

* Think About It
** http://nautil.us/issue/56/perspective/autistic-prodigies-since-rain-man
*** I certainly wasn't a prodigy at that level, and I was far more functional.
** https://www.theringer.com/movies/2018/1/8/16861248/morpheus-neo-the-matrix-red-pill-or-blue-pill-monologue
*** Gorgeous. One of the most important scenes in cinema ever produced. And, I think you should be worried about the fact that Morpheus fails to even attempt to explain what the Matrix is...he could have, and it may have influenced Neo's decision. That is perhaps on purpose. Why not dissection of this?
** http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/08/fight-me-psychologists-birth-order-effects-exist-and-are-very-strong/
*** Perhaps not the best argument. Compelling still.

* Fishy
** https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/38562147/julian-assange-to-leave-ecuadorian-embassy-given-passport/
*** We'll see what happens.
** https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2018/01/09/improving-urls-for-amp-pages/
*** Centralization of power, still.
*** http://ampletter.org/
** http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-cancer-therapies-could-control-all-infectious-disease-2018-1
*** And the Redpilled Reason, Survey Says: He wants to live forever, and cancer is a statistical guarantee for all humans.
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDFZKAS5eQw
*** Something is not right about this.

*** I keep seeing that phrase "intelligence is changeable." I want to shout out that it often is, and to some extent, but there are cases where it cannot be changed. They know this, I'm sure. I wish it was better said.

*** Interesting. I feel this way often enough. How about you?
*** /r/lostgeneration says this about it: Step 1: Expect one employee to do the work of a 100 Step 2: Blame the employee for "underperformance" Step 3: Imagine a psuedo neurological disorder and make money off treating it Step 4: Publish an article about it and seem like you're here to help
