Traveling is not always fun.

Mine has been busy. The logistics of the move are solidifying, and I'm less anxious about it.

Will be visiting family the days right before our move, so that makes it complicated.
Dec 8, 2019 7:23pm
But, I think it's all worked out.

You all have moved alot. But that makes it no less easier! Glad the plans are coming together.

Berea is a great place. Gotta be somewhat surreal.

Have access to the gym, racquetball, weights, lots if intellectual things, convocation and the atmosphere of a younger me, (I hope) might encourage healthy living and exercise uninhibited by the troubles at home.
