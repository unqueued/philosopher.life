!! About:

<<<
All great fiction films tend towards documentary, just as all great documentaries tend towards fiction. 

-- Jean luc Godard, //Godard on Godard//
<<<

Documentaries are potent educational devices because they deliver such a strong affective+cognitive point of view. I prefer them to be nature porn or journalistic tools. It is difficult to peel apart fact from fiction, and they tend to be rhetorical works driven by agendas (which doesn't make them unjustified by definition). There is a dialectic between objectivity and subjectivity readily apparent in a documentary, but I do not know how to describe it well enough. Regardless, documentaries often force me to confront a painful reality. They have a strong addictive potential as well. Admittedly, I don't watch them often, but I should; they are usually low-hanging fruit.
