Here are my daily meds:

* Prebiotic Fiber
* Probiotics
** Contains at least Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species
* Fish Oil
* Multi-vitamin
** Contains at least Vitamins D, A, K, and Magnesium

I use coconut oil to prevent rashes and skin infections I'm prone to have when stressed. I don't know why it works, but it does.
