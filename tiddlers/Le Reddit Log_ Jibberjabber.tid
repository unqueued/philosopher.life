>>`> implying i'm implying :P`

>>You're having a discussion that I hold in high regard, and I [hope](https://philosopher.life/#hope) to see more. Many of the most respected members of the TW community aren't as concerned as you are about this. It's not an easy [computing](https://philosopher.life/#Computing) or [social](https://philosopher.life/#The%20Philosopher%20King) problem to solve. 

>>[Ideally](https://philosopher.life/#Outopos), most of the problems are solved outside of the TW community. Pragmatically: dogfooded, decentralized TWs (in which the [workers own the means of production](https://philosopher.life/#Socialism)) is the direction that interests me the most (or attaching TWs onto platforms we respect). Unfortunately, the barrier to entry is high and problems like discoverability, safe multi-user environments, and search still aren't easily solved. I don't have any specific alternative I adore either. There's no living platform that meets my preferred requirements. [I've been thinking](https://philosopher.life/#P2P%3A%20Aether) about [Aether](https://getaether.net), but the default [ephemerality](https://philosopher.life/#Le%20Reddit%20Log%3A%20Jibberjabber) isn't conducive to building historically verifiable relationships or well-organized long-term knowledge bases (and I have other quiet worries). I'm also interested in tooling that runs well on shitty devices and profoundly [censored, shaped, and inspected] networks, targeting what most of the world has access to. 

>>As has been noted many times in the community, TW lacks an effective course of learning too. It's fragmented in a way that gives no intuitive learning curve (though it is far simpler than anything else like it). I can't build such a thing because I can barely use TW myself. My family and I use the tool a ton, but we don't work under the hood so much as drive the vehicle.

>>Like you, I'm still on the hunt, trying to think about the problem as best I can. I appreciate your fervor. It's a pleasure to meet you, [nomad](https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others).

>At that point, I wasn't thinking of a specific alternative, since many networks are better than Google Groups, which even requires a phone number, just like Facebook.

>Preferably specifically ones explicitly supportive of open source projects. Of course the safest option would be an independent solution (private servers), but I won't let the best kill the good.

>What I found irritating was the irony of it: something as open and transparent as TiddlyWiki trapped behind a Facebook-style phonewall (by the pattern of "paywall"). I mean, even GitHub, though it's now owned Microsoft, is a way better option. (And anybody could have thought of it!)

>Was your implication that you're a TiddlyWiki developer or that you are planning to build a new community?

Just a rando here, but I strongly appreciate your concern. I'm interested in having the morally justified tooling for building communities that practice The Golden Rule. What would you prefer?

>>>> I'm somehow okay with my worry that your answer dodges the question (which is not to say you intended to so).

>>> Ah, yeah, re-reading your post I get what you mean.

>>>> To my eyes, the graph is misleading. I don't see why we should agree that a sufficient percentage of people will have their jobs back, and I take it that a lot of poor people are getting wrecked. I'm not convinced that most people will be employed in such a way that they can pay to reasonably live (let alone lead meaningful, flourishing human lives), a price which I predict will continue to rise.

>>> Yeah, I definitely agree with this. I was more making a mathematical correction to how people were interpreting this than an emotional one, this issue really is unprecedented, especially to poor and struggling people in America and all over the world. There really is no bright side to it, some people are going to get absolutely fucked unless we see some rich countries/ states/ cities/ etc. making a quick recovery and starting to disburse international/ interstate/ local/ etc. aid to those who need it. I do not see this happening.

>>> In a very morbid way, this whole situation is quite fascinating. This is the type of thing you might see in a movie or read of in the history books, and it’s happening before our very eyes. How we react to this will change to course of human history forever - do we make like the Black Death and go for a new enlightenment, or do we double down on our current ways...

>>Thank you for your earnest and thoughtful answer. I'm somehow okay with my worry that your answer dodges the question (which is not to say you intended to do so). The spirit of your answer is something I admire. [[I|h0p3]] hold [[hope]] in high regard.

>>To my eyes, the graph is misleading. I don't see why we should agree that a sufficient percentage of people will have their jobs back, and I take it that a lot of poor people are getting wrecked. I'm not convinced that most people will be employed in such a way that they can pay to reasonably live (let alone lead meaningful, flourishing human lives), a price which I predict will continue to rise. I believe the situation is far more dire than unemployment claims can demonstrate. I too hope our crisis will change minds. That is not my prediction, and given how the democratic primaries have been handled (another piece of evidence on a giant heap), my hope is not in current voting processes available to us (though, I consider voting to be the only method to have a morally justified functioning government, and that is what I'm fighting for).

>>I appreciate how level-headed you are for someone your age. I adore computers (though I am not as skilled as you are with them). If you ever want a madman for a friend (I'm like wild-card Charlie from IASIP :P), a crazy penpal even, hit me up. Some of my correspondence lasts for hundreds of pages. It would be my honor to get to know you.

>Honestly, I think that most Americans have become so disillusioned with politics that very few of these things can meaningfully sway them either way.

>The problem with American politics is that for almost two hundred years these people have had a choice between a rock and a hard place, you can only take that for so long before you start realizing that one man will knock out out cold and steal your money while the other will pickpicket it quietly and blame it on someone else. As a result, most Americans - even very politically minded ones - have become apathetic to politics in general, instead choosing to focus on their individual issues. The only remaining people who are left to vote are the die-hards, the bleeding hearts, the ones with too much time and the ones whose hope haven’t been snuffed out yet.

>In America today, we need a major issue to give people hope again that their vote actually matters. My hope is that this virus will do the trick, but honestly I have no idea.

Do you think the unemployment numbers in the US are accurate and good-faith measurements? Do those numbers inform the possible-voting public in a fitting way?

>>>>> Do you mind if I use it as an example of how TiddlyRoam can support large wikis?

>>>>Thank you for testing! I'm sad that live mapping performance becomes unwieldy. I'll have to think about how I'd want to make predetermined maps. It's cool as hell to see visualizations of it too.

>>> Just tested it and it worked fine! Here's a picture of how the whole screen looked. With this view, the live view updated almost instantaneously. However, if you choose to look at the graph view showing all tiddlers within two nodes distance, it did take a little longer to load the map.

>>> Note that, apart from live view which updates as you move between tiddlers, you can also arrange predetermined graphs. For example, in your case u/4eak, you might want to create a map that introduces new visitors to the wiki. These predetermined maps will load very quickly, regardless of their size.

>>> As to whether it is the right tool for your specific case, that is probably up to you. The bidirectional links worked neatly, the localised live view map works well, and setting up predetermined maps might be nice for certain topics.

>>That is the largest example I have available.

I feel your pain. Poor working memory (and difficulty committing things to long-term memory) runs in my family. Spaced repetition and excellent tooling has helped. My family uses Tiddlywiki, and it's very good at helping you organize, search, re-use your data, and have an exobrain to offload into and think big-picture about.

I participate everyday in a group of people who use Tiddlywiki heavily. At least in part, it functions as a social network. We speak from our wikis. It doesn't fit well into the rationalist community (though there are connections). It's not for drive-by readers though (my own wiki is over 30MB of plaintext); it's expensive to engage in the process of reading and writing with each other.

>>>> Can you speak to the technical infrastructures and policies which we are morally obligated to construct and maintain for journalists and everyone in society? I'm particularly interested in your point(s) of view on censorship, free speech, and the centralization of power.

>>>> Also, in case you want to know who you are speaking with, [[this is me|https://philosopher.life/]].

>>> I am against censorship--but am not an absolutist about it. For example, I don't believe people like Alex Jones have the first amendment right to PROFIT off of inciting violence and creating conspiracy theories about murdered school children. I don't have an issue with him being kicked off YouTube and other platforms (he has the right to spew his hate and violence on his own platform). But to me that's where it ends. I don't support YouTube and Facebook and Twitter suppression and demonetization that we have been seeing--nor the widespread f**kery of Google with their ranking schemes. To me, tech companies need to be regulated because they are public utilities....and they need to be regulated by public entities that DO NOT have any financial dealings/donations from them.

>> Do you think Alex Jones has any moral rights to a domain name, a stable IP address, an unNATed internet connection (with no blocked ports), or to have his information packets forwarded (with no difference in priority) by middle internet routers regardless of his profound evil? Do your enemies have a morally justified political right to own a platform which is widely and publically accessible even by people who are not computer savvy, and insofar as an individual cannot own the infrastructure, what (if anything) does society owe him to support his platform?

>> What kinds of regulations do you have in mind? If these are public utilities, should they be privately owned at all? What do you think about the distinction between a publisher and a platform?

> He's not going to answer this as the AMA is over, but you hit the nail on the head.

> Free speech, means all speech. You may not like what the other person says, but they have the right to say it. Authoritarians believe in the opposite.

> The "hate speech" label is increasingly being used in a calculated manner to suppress and censor various types of speech and discussion even for simple disagreements or political views considered "wrong think."

> You see this occurring more and more every day.

> Alex Jones was a trial balloon to test public acceptance/resistance to de-platforming and mass censorship of a public figure. Since this event, you now see Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms increasing censorship of all users. i.e. First they came for Alex Jones, but I did not stand up, now they come for me...

> Youtube and other tech platforms like Facebook and Twitter are not neutral platforms. Their liability protections should be revoked.

It is the centralization of political power in the material dialectic. Owning even the technological means of production is a necessary way out. Unfortunately, it's expensive, there are inefficiencies in decentralization which most people are unwilling to pay for, and the internet on a global scale is something which appears to be controlled by particular nation-states and multi-national corporations which have no desire to empower individuals.

Sometimes you are going to have to kill the sociopath trying to kill you and others. Even The Golden Rule requires turning against your enemy at some point. The root cause of capitalism is egoism, including apathy and an unwillingness to recognize that violence is sometimes the only answer. My real enemy is the capitalist and everyone who enables them. That old lady is far more responsible than you've implied.

I hear ya. Many people find me cynical (I see evil in almost everyone I encounter). I see some of that in your posting history too, so I think we have that in common.

I can agree many are non-trivially responsible to some degree or kind for their circumstances. Generalizing is quite difficult, as you point out. I appreciate that you actually want to care and are willing to think about our moral responsibilities. You are correct: there are leechers, freeriders, sociopaths, and people who deserve their homelessness to some significant extent, but I think looking over the entirety of many of their lives will often show they aren't entirely responsible. Even the victimizers are usually victims at the same time, and I think you've overstated the opportunities available to them. Morally justified upward mobility barely exists for most people; status crystallization or falling is the norm.

You and I have different experiences in this sphere. I have worked with folks of all ages, including homeless children and impoverished persons outside of the US for years. I've seen their faces and heard their stories in many cities and countrysides. The vast majority of homeless people on this planet, including first world nations, are more blameless than your argument implies. I can appreciate being jaded here, but it's worth looking at again and again. If you are interested, I'm willing to engage in a much more significant public conversation with you.

Gah, this would never have happened in ancient Greece. Knowledge is not a bias in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons. Don't be so close-minded. All possible logically valid inferences and memeplexes are equally salient, and ad hominem attacks are conceptually wrong in both argumentation and selecting authorities. Tribalism is always immoral, and thus discriminating philosophers are the worst kind of scum.

Into infinite regress, fittingly responding to the paradox of tolerance with The Golden Rule and wrestling [[The Other]] with integrity is one of the hard self-defining problems in philosophy.

Of course, it is my honor to [[help]].

I'm sorry you are feeling lost. That's not your fault. It's not designed to be disorienting; it's as organized as I know how to make it. I do not know how to solve that vertigo. To be clear, I am lost too. It is the best tool I have found.

It's really big, currently ~60 (100k-word) novels. It's also heavily fragmented (currently into over 10,000 pieces). Imagine having 10k submitted posts in your sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/Lonewolfeslayer/ on every topic in your life. How would you organize and relate them? It is not an easy problem.

My family and I write in [our wikis](https://philosopher.life/) daily, and it helps with homeschooling quite a bit. Our [family time](https://philosopher.life/#Family%20Time) includes walking as a family and one-on-one time, but our wikis are self-shaped social media, organizational, and personal knowledge base tools for telling the stories of our lives together. 

The barrier to entry into modern capitalism is so fucking high, I'm forced to require my offspring to mechanize, automate, and become adept with leet tools if they are going to have the competitive advantage necessary to survive. It is very hard to be moral in a world in which one's competitors are not trying to be moral. We also build infrastructures and conventions in preparation for us to be able to live meaningful remote lives together because we simply can't see far enough into the future. These survival habits have to begin very early.

The centralization of power (in this case) is only going to be effectively defeated through P2P filtration.

It's good to see this question here. I usually find this kind of learning+productivity porn question in /r/TheMotte and /r/slatestarcodex, and I'm happy to see it in a Leftist sub.

I use Tiddlywiki. I cannot recommend it highly enough. My entire family uses it in place of social media. It's also how my children take their notes and reason about projects for homeschooling. It's extremely hackable, it's a second-brain, and it enables many kinds of autonomy. I didn't discover this tool until after 11 years of post-secondary education, and I'm pretty pissed off about it (it's not quite that old). Better late than never.

I've been using my wiki for almost 3 years now. It's ~30MB of almost pure text in a single file (that's how I prefer to serve it), or ~60 novels in length.

I am free tech support to anyone in this sub who wants to set it up. It would be my privilege to help you own your identity, your data, and how you shape yourself with FOSS power tools. May you own the memes of production.

Not a problem. Even though I use it a bunch, it often still feels new to me. There's so much to learn.
<<<

<<<
Yes! It abstracts away a lot of the programming while still giving you access to work under the hood if you want (you may one day decide that is something that you want to do).

You do not need to know how to engineer standard software to build your own wiki. You will need to learn the markup language and play with settings, but if you can do markup on Reddit, you can do it on the wiki. I suggest using Firefox with the saving extension or the Bob executable (both are excellent options). There are many learning curves to using a wiki, and only some of them are technical. I think you will do great, and if you get stuck: you can always ask me or anyone on the forums.
<<<

<<<
The Firefox method is the simplest, and in my experience, it is also the most performant (though I hold a minority view on this one). I used it for years, even with multiple devices (I use Resilio Sync to synchronize files across my devices). My wife still uses it too, but the rest of my family has moved onto Bob. Do not forget to install the savetrail plugin (it has saved my ass so many times), and I also highly recommend you take a nightly snapshot of your wiki (you may want to rollback or reason about the evolution of your wiki).
