title: The One Skinnerbox 2RTA

//What would be the perfect game for me? Tribes + WoW + EQ/bots + D2 + MTG + Hero Clicker + LoL + EvE...I do not claim this is feasible or even technically possible.//

!! Technical

* Decentralized, no SaaS (unless we are simply serving each other, perhaps federation for NAT-piercing)
* Modular, moddable, automated compatibility detection (until it must be manual), the players are the DMs/GMs. It has to be something WE construct and evolve together in all aspects.
* Layered on [[Atropos]]
* Lossy anti-cheat??
* Rollbacks

!! Social

* Vote-2-Kick, Vote-2-Mute, Web of Trust rating, etc.
* Whitelist and Blacklist filtering sharded consensus
* Mail and chat

!! Itemization & Economies

* In virtue of having been generated by and with others. You can only use items with others that they've programmatically generated by the group. You can't use a weapon that the entire group hasn't verified.
* First-class botting required/encouraged sections, including mining/exploring/upgrading/idle-clicking/trading/gambling

!! Play

* First-Person preferred mechanics
* Tribes 2 and Ascend movement, Z-axis, rewards significant practice, aerial dogfighting, slow projectiles, timing.
* No target-locking; all dexterity
* Formally Verified Dialectic: who's the beatdown? Defense vs. Offense

!! PvP

* Ante or No Ante; not everyone wants to play for keeps

Talk about a game that wants to burn a TB of hard drive space, all your RAM, CPU, and throughput. The price of decentralization is absurd here.

How do we lossy, shardy, consensusually, consensually, and entertainingly tell stories together through the rhetorical, ludological, and technical components of our mutually generated simulations and experience machines?

In a way, how do we makes it so everyone plays the kind of game they want with those who agree to play by those rules in a fair way? Most sets in the rhizome are incompatible by definition in the search space, but perhaps they can bridge together across sliding spectrums.
