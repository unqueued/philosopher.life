title: 2019.06.25 - Wiki Review: Chatty

* [[Wiki: Transplant]]
** Hopeful thinking? Well, you win some, you lose some. You haven't lost yet.
* [[2019.06.24 - Computer Musings: Sublime Text 3]]
** Edited. The offspring are all set.
* [[2019.06.24 - JRE: Buttdial]]
** Edited. 
** I think he's still adjusting to his meds. I'm glad he's working out. I hope he gets ripped and feels better.
* [[2019.06.24 - /b/]]
** I never know when to rename stuff either. It started out me not knowing where I wanted to put it, but it has more shape now.
* [[2019.06.24 - TDL: Transplant]]
** Ugh, looks like it is failing for me. I've spent too much time building up the niceties and muscle memories in the wiki device.
* [[2019.06.24 - Prompted Introspection: Family Tradition]]
** It's not often that I get to transclude complete tiddlers into others. This one worked out nicely.
** I can't say I'm all that proud of so many of my choices in life, but [[Family Time]] has been one of the shining examples of doing something right. I appreciate how it's hard work and has extreme ups-and-downs, but still adds up so beautifully.

** Otherwise, he continues to minimize interaction through wikis. That said, I think he's been minimizing interaction. It's painful to face, and he'd rather just take his drugs (I get it); I also think he's depressed. I hope the exercise routine is going to help him considerably. It might!
* [[2019.06.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: All Over]]
** Completed. 
** She's pouring herself out for people to learn. She's a pillar.
* [[2019.06.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Doctrinal System]]
** Edited. 
** [[Saint Chomsky]] has provided me quite a journey. Responding to him, even out of context, has required some work each day. I hope it adds up! =)
* [[2019.06.20 - T-Money: His Male Donor]]
** I adore the "you guys did alot of moving around with alot of uncertinty, as well" line. This is why he has to see the systemic illness of capitalism. There's a reason people don't have roots, community, and stability: it's capitalism. It's shocking to see someone from his background not recognize it immediately: survivor bias likely. I see the same in my sister-in-laws.
* [[2019.06.23 - T-Money: Whoops!]]
** Yikes. I am embarrassed. I shouldn't have done that. That is the kind of rudeness I'm opposed to.

** He's been using [[SLT]]'s language a bit more. I've heard an old nickname of mine recently from his as well, and he claimed he wasn't high. I wonder what that means.
