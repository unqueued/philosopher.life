title: 2018.06.30 - Daily TDL: Chill JRE's Fam

* Read+Write
* Chill with JRE's Fam
* Perhaps pickup some harddrives for my brother, since he is down his last 1 HDD...and even that one is dying out. 
** Setup software RAID 0 for him, I think. Offered to just make a NAS for him, but that isn't whathe wants to do.
