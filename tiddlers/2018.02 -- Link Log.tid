!! Audits:

* I can tell I've been absolutely drowning in hyperreading material.
* There are gaps, no doubt.
* I love the ASCII Art
* I've stopped writing so much about Confirm My Bias. I think this makes some sense. Other sections require more thought and response.
* I love that I feel the freedom to just post one thing and nothing else. That is going to happen when I have control over this drug. Good on you.
* There is Antipleonasmic and Redpilled Socialism work all over the place.
* I clearly work very hard to maintain hope and reason. These links are bleak as fuck.
* It is delicious to see my biases and beliefs confirmed by such a wide variety of sources.
* I will say this, I feel well-read. My filter-bubble is sick as fuck. /dance
* Edits.
* Breathtaking quality+quantity content I've covered.
