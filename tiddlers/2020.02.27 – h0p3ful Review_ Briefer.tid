*[[2020.02.26 – The Lightning Thief: Second draft]]
** I know our teacher is grading you here, so I will be quite brief.
*** I appreciate how much thought you've put into this. It's a significant improvement over past work and your last draft as well.
**** I desperately want you to see that writing is a process, one which often takes years (or even a lifetime) to complete (and it may not even ever get finished...you will have to take risks there too). Go look at your work two years ago, or go pull out our notebooks from many years ago, and you'll see stark differences. You did that. I know this is your worst subject, and I'm proud that you work to make it your best. 
*[[Notage Ti.2]]
** I appreciate that you attempted to take notes. It is not an easy or fun task.
*[[2020.02.26 – Wiki Review: Divisibility.]]
** Ha, it's okay that I have a ton to say about it, right? =) 
*** Also, I think you've done more work than you've jokingly implied here (just to make sure that is explicit). 
*** I see so many stories and connections come out of your words. I wish I knew how to explain that well enough.
** You've struggled with pronouns for a long time. Keep hunting for it. I know it's hard. I appreciate your effort, sir.
** Evil != Wrong, insofar as Good is the precise opposite of Evil (though, there is a deep, deep problem here, a whale in philosophy).
** You are not specific enough in your [[Yearly Cross-section]] commentary. It may be better to say nothing. I'd like you to try it like I'm doing it (or your sister's method). 
*[[2020.02.26 – TDL: Lecture?]]
** This wasn't specified, yet again. Do you understand what I'm saying?
*[[2020.02.26 – h0p3ful Review: Snap, Son]]
** Okay, I'm trying to keep it shorter!
*[[2020.02.26 – Carpe Diem: Wrote]]
** Why didn't you fill this out? This doesn't say much of anything?
*[[2020.02.26 – Prompted Introspection: Define.]]
** 0.000005% is more standard. Scientific notation is fine too.
** Your grammar needs work here. Look for the errors, please. 
*** It's not that you need to be perfect, but you have to try to find them more than you have been.
** I adore this topic. It's such an excellent point. There's is a great deal to think about here.
*** Also, because [[kicks]] sometimes features your site in his work, I would be shocked if the number were only 10. 
*** Note, ofc, that the privacy or secrecy you have is incidental, and it could change. It is possible, however unlikely, that many, many people would read your work. We talk about this often, and we must continue.
*[[2020.02.26 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Slavery with extra steps.]]
** Being educated does not mean you are likely to escape poverty. This is something you should study. You need to see the demographic trends to recognize what stage of capitalism we're living in.
*** Education is necessary, but it is not sufficient for so many things.
** It is important to see that even poor people have some degrees of freedom. This is not easy to pick out, and it becomes a matter of [[Moral Luck]] which must be examined carefully. Just because it's hard to reason here doesn't give us the right not to, btw.
** I admire that your gut instinct, your knee-jerk reaction, is to defend the poor. It's wise. Make sure you act on it.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** It's interesting to see your work spread across so many tiddlers. It has tended to be very thin (understandably). I think you are growing your ability to say more about a given topic in whatever window you have.
*** Recall that we will often fail to connect enough dots. It is part of why verbosity is so necessary. For many people, it is a sign of not caring about their time, but coming from an autist, it is the best we can do in some cases.
