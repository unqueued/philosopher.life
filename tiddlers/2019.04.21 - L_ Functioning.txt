Yours too! Ours was busy, but good. I hardly got sleep last night because of the air mattress K and I were sleeping on, so I was in the weird land of “totally sleepy but still somehow functioning” nearly all day

I think I live in that world sometimes. I'm sorry. Glad it was good.

Bah, nothing to be sorry about. Growing up means learning to operate while sleep deprived. Plus, it was really good to see all my family.

While I was talking to Mom about their house upgrades she said you’ve been very encouraging for her. Thank you for that — I think sometimes my mom just needs a cheerleader and I am bad about being that for her.
