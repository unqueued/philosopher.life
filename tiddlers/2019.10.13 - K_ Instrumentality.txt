How was the renfaire?
OCT 13 10:43 AM
I‚Äôve got a paper to round out, groceries to fetch, and a Samurai to play tonight.
OCT 13 10:43 AM
It was great
OCT 13 10:43 AM
I LOVE the faire. :)
OCT 13 10:43 AM
I want to cosplay one of my characters next year.
OCT 13 10:43 AM
Oh, awesome, which one?
OCT 13 10:44 AM
You are smashing through your papers. Sounds like today is going to be solid for you.
OCT 13 10:44 AM
Leaning toward my Drow Gunslinger. Gonna be a human variant because I‚Äôm not fucking with body paint. Haha. That‚Äôs a good way to get in trouble. üëÄ
OCT 13 10:45 AM
Fingers crossed! This paper is interesting.
OCT 13 10:45 AM
I‚Äôm writing about ‚Äúthe Flying Man of Stone by Dilman (?) Dila and it‚Äôs portrayal of technology particularly weapons.
OCT 13 10:46 AM
Yeah, body paint sounds like a mess, too much work, things go wrong. I've only been to one renfaire. It is very much [[k0sh3k]]'s thing. I like food and titties, so I also like it. 
OCT 13 10:46 AM
Lmao
OCT 13 10:47 AM
Same
OCT 13 10:47 AM
We went twice this year. [[L]] dressed up both times.
OCT 13 10:47 AM
That novella looks interesting: http://www.bookshybooks.com/2016/04/meet-flying-man-of-stone-by-dilman-dila.html

What is your thesis?
OCT 13 10:48 AM
It has some flaws, but it was a fun read at least.
OCT 13 10:48 AM
This is for African American Sci-fi
OCT 13 10:48 AM
Aye
OCT 13 10:48 AM
(sounds like that class has been improving)
OCT 13 10:49 AM
That Dila has interesting things to say about technology and its role but ultimately he never really favors a certain side when it comes to weaponizing them.
OCT 13 10:49 AM
Do you think he should have favored a side given his arguments/presentation/narrative?
OCT 13 10:50 AM
The big moral is that humans are too evil and use technology to kill each other, but at the end of the book the big champion of that thought goes back on his word right before his son is killed by an angry mob. The message is too muddled to draw a contemplative conclusion outside of that message.
OCT 13 10:50 AM
Yeah. Definitely.
OCT 13 10:50 AM
I don‚Äôt really have a hard thesis. I just wanted to talk about this jumbled mess of a book. Hahaha
OCT 13 10:51 AM
Because I‚Äôve been so busy with other stuff I JUST stared this paper on Friday and don‚Äôt really have time to put what I want into it. :(
OCT 13 10:52 AM
Well, I'm way out of my league on literary interpretation. Your thesis sounds hard enough to me. 
OCT 13 10:54 AM
Maybe it's also one of those books you come back to read again later. 
OCT 13 10:54 AM
Perhaps. I wish it went a little deeper. There are a lot of really cool supernatural elements that are never expanded on and they‚Äôre much more interesting than the main plot imo.

If you're interested. :) As always, I wish I had more pages and more time.
OCT 13 6:05 PM
I am a fan of this problem.

I usually talk about it in terms of instrumental reasoning, hypothetical imperatives, means to ends relationships, etc. You make many excellent moves in speaking about the nature of tools and autonomy.
OCT 13 8:06 PM
I don't think you should spend more time on the paper (pretty sure it's already an A), but if you developed it further, it should go that direction.
