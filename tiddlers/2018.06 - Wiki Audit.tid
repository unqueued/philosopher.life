!! Audit:

* I never did finish grafting my doctoral notes. I should do that!
* The transformation of {[[About]]} continues. This audit has most of my thoughts on it. It's clear that there is a significant relationship to [[Self-Dialectic]] as well.
* Constant rabbitholes.
* Some of these are short, some aren't. Not sure why.
* I think I prefer it in narratival rather than listed format.
* I didn't do this log every day, despite it being a Core Daily Requirement. This is tricky. Sometimes I just don't have the energy to do this kind of heavy lifting, and I think it's okay that I don't. Should it move to frequent? Maybe. It's so important that I really want to keep it up with the other core daily requirements. This is a habit I desperately need.
* I've noticed this log has a hell of a lot in common with {[[Principles]]} as well, which outside of [[Axioms of h0p3]] seems to not be used very much lately. I assume it will have another revamp some day.
* [[Wiki Review]] reminds me of how much work I've been doing, but [[Wiki Audit]] actually gives the narrative of it. I think the Audit is more verbal/narratival while the Review is somehow more quantitative in its feeling.
* I like that term "facelift." Sometimes that's what it is.
* It's interesting to see some of [[Computer Musings]] show up in this log, when it is directly related to the wiki itself.
* Deeping Reading, and IJ in particular are bound up in this Audit. That is very interesting to me. My Recent Obsessions and major Frequent Logs & Projects show up often.
* TDL and my Wiki Audit have an odd relationship as well. I can't tell you how many times I've basically just started writing a TDL in my Audit rather than explaining what I've done. I fear that waiting a day is a mistake though. I want to put my immediate thought process down asap.
* I'm still not sure what I want to do with The Matrix script commentary. Part of me thinks it really should stay, but I worry it is bloat that I should just cut.
* This feels very much like my venerable {Projects} of yore.
* A lot of the projects, unfortunately, come and go. This is part of shotgunning for what matters though.
** KEEP GOING!
* One of the projects that has been ongoing for a while but is only now starting to bear any fruit is my [[Find The Others]] related project. I'm pleased to see it is doing something. I think it may take decades for it to truly blossom. I hope it does.
* I'm feeling pretty bad that I've not responded to those 3 in a week. It's kind of been a crazy week though.
* Ugh, I hereby forgive myself for failing to complete this log daily. I will remain open to the possibility that it is not the right option as well.
