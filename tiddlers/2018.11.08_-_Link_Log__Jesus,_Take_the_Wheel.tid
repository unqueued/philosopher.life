*** Duuuuuuhhhh Doyyyy

* Think About It
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/magazine/placebo-effect-medicine.html
*** We increasingly just don't give a shit about each other. We blame people for their illnesses. Social causes of healing clearly demonstrate social causes of illness.
** https://lawless.tech/xenotransplantation-playing-god-because-at-least-somebody-should/
*** Think we'll be harnessing them for than transplantation and food. Once we can figure out how to make computers out of them...
** https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/falling-walls-social-relationships-as-a-spatial-problem/
*** I think my wiki enables me to engage in this reasoning more effectively too.
** https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/meet-yourself
*** A fine start. They clearly have no fucking clue how deep this rabbithole goes. They have no idea what technology brings to the table.
** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/why-doctors-hate-their-computers
*** Almost nothing on how AI is likely going to replace diagnostics (the hardest part). Recognizing what to put into their computer and gut checking is all they will do, besides the bedside manner etc.
** https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-social-thinker/201809/what-event-causes-people-become-politically-conservative
*** And, yet, I hope to be a man of incredible integrity.

*** JHBFC
** https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/philosophy-has-made-plenty-of-progress/
*** I feel like this series is missing the fucking point. /bangs-head-on-wall

* Fishy
** https://www.thenation.com/article/the-real-reason-americans-dont-care-about-the-costs-of-war/
*** But, almost no dissection of the morality of it outside the cost. The moral costs are what matter, which is larger than mere financial costs.
** https://colddarkstars.wordpress.com/2018/06/30/crisis-theory-the-decline-of-capitalism-as-the-growth-of-expensive-and-fragile-complexity/
*** Actually, I think you've stepped over Marx's theory. I'm willing to set aside Marx's math, and so should you.
** https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/
*** The article is borderline Stunning! The prescription, however, is not aiming for socialism. Game over. 
** http://www.unz.com/freed/lets-have-a-war-with-russia/
*** Yikes, but you are responsible for this too, lol.
** https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/we-should-teach-media-literacy-in-elementary-school/
*** Yet, I am still convinced this will be a means of control.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/magazine/FBI-charlottesville-white-nationalism-far-right.html
*** Actually, it seems like they have enabled it.
** https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-are-the-chances-that-americas-disunion-turns-into-civil-war-2018-11-07
*** It's so curious. I think that 21st Century Warfare is just radically more complex and different than what this person is talking about. It's extremely clear that Class Civil War is already upon us. This glosses over what's already happening (and has happened).
** https://aeon.co/ideas/believing-without-evidence-is-always-morally-wrong
*** Ad hominem time.
*** Clearly, a huge debate in epistemology. 
** https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-11-04/millennial-men-failing-find-jobs-amid-hottest-market-decades
*** Gross. No attempts to see it. That's the zerohedge I know and hate. =/
