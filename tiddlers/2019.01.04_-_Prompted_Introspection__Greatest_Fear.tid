title: 2019.01.04 - Prompted Introspection: Greatest Fear

!! What is your greatest fear and how often do you think about it?

I answer that here: [[2018.01.18 - Prompted Introspection Log: Greatest Fear]]. I'm feeling far more confident in my purpose this go around (WOOT!). Now I am worried that I will never succeed. I still think [[The End of Humanity]] is coming. My offspring make me quite sad: I'm failing to motivate them. I love that I started referencing other parts of my wiki to answer these questions; that was a damned fine move.
