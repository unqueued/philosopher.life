title: 2019.06.07 - Wiki Review: The Japanese

* [[2019.06.06 - Link Log: Slowly Cleaning]]
** This is slow going. I'll take it. It's better than nothing, dude.
* [[2019.06.06 - Wiki Review: Lucky]]
** I'm looking forward to having two letters from [[T-Money]] to respond to. I hope he doesn't feel rushed. Letters are awesome gifts.
* [[2019.06.06 - TDL: Research]]
** Didn't get the stubs. That will have to be next week. Otherwise, you did a good job, homie.
* [[2019.06.06 - Prompted Introspection: LSD]]
** Edited. We are going to have to try that again. =)
* [[2019.06.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Solid]]
** Completed. Actually, it's very squishy. It has the pearl-like texture inside too. Goddess bless the Japanese for this bounty.
* [[2019.06.06 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Appalled]]
** Edited. This is one of the shitty parts of being parent. She's not seen Saunders fully come out yet.
* [[2019.06.06 - kickscondor: Sooper-Sekrit]]
** To be fair, you'd either have to penetrate Google or me to find it.
* [[kickscondor: @]]
** It's not real-time chat, but it's just as obnoxious. Congratz! 
* [[2019.06.06 - T-Money: Phone!]]
** It's fascinating to see [[T-Money]] reads this. He joins the precious few who read the backbone skeleton of my wiki with any regularity. `/wave` =)
