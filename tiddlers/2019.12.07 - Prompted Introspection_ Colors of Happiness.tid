title: 2019.12.07 - Prompted Introspection: Colors of Happiness

!! What color makes you think of happiness?

Rainbows, neons, reflectivity, transparency, and black and white make me feel and think about kinds of happiness. Surprise! I think I can see various kinds of happiness in each color, and I'm not sure I can pick out one over another so well here (it's a range). Other than that, you need to flesh out a context for me to say which color makes me think of happiness more than the others. Even if I can't see them terribly well, colors make me happy.
