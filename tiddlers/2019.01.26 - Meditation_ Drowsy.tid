title: 2019.01.26 - Meditation: Drowsy

I tried meditating while drowsy and very sleepy. I have no idea if it worked. It wasn't unpleasant though. I need to sleep better, imho.

I did my stretches afterward this time. I need it just to limber up I think. I regret ever stopping this practice. I should have been doing it all along!
