**** Hissy fits. =)

* Confirm My Bias

*** I'd like to understand their effects on me. I used significant quantities.
** https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-018-9498-2
*** For the love of Seldon, be redpilled. Understand our motivations as humans: we're selfish.

*** But, one day, it might. It's an entangled mess.

*** Ah, the hell I avoid with a few tools

*** I would dearly love these answers. I fear there are philosophical underpinnings that make this infeasible.

* Think About It

*** Sounds "holistic." I admire much of her argument. I smell fish, but I will set it aside for now.

* Fishy

*** It seems to me that Google is setting itself up to have even more control over the advertisement experience, but not for the benefit of the people. This article does a very poor job articulating what Mozilla is really doing. I take it this is no accident, and I don't think this is mere fanboi material. Agenda.

*** Correlation vs. Causation, and you admit it. I wish you took the time to see the costs of digital illiteracy and even broader illiteracy as the result of limiting screentime.

*** He might be right, but his argument is trash and his motivations arguably worse.
** https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Enlightenment-Now
*** I will read the book with skeptical eyes. I have been a fan of Pinker's work before. That Gates wields it, however, requires caution.

* Interesting

*** A good skinny
** https://news.mit.edu/2018/new-study-reveals-how-brain-waves-control-working-memory-0126
*** I can't say I understand what a brain wave means.
