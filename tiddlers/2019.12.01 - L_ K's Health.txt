Been a while. =)

You doing okay?
Dec 1, 2019 1:55pm
I am doing much better now that I’ve had time away from work, honestly. Unfortunately, we had to take [[K]] to the hospital because he was having sharp chest pains. We think it may be a sever allergic reaction to staying at my parents’ house, but they’re doing tests just to be sure.

I also believe it may have been induced by stress all things considered.
Dec 1, 2019 1:57pm
Yes
Dec 1, 2019 1:57pm
he has been under enormous stress
Dec 1, 2019 1:57pm
I also learned today just how sever his fear of needles is. Don’t think I’ve seen him this wound up before. Shoo...

He is doing much better already, truthfully. We are waiting on test results meow.
Dec 1, 2019 1:58pm
I'm glad he is doing much better.
Dec 1, 2019 1:59pm
It sounds like the test results will be reasonable too.
Dec 1, 2019 1:59pm
Which means I feel better too. I hate seeing him like this. I’ve been asking if I should take him to the doctor for awhile now but the answer has always been “no”. Looks like I should have just done it anyways.

Not thrilled to see how much this will cost, but like I told [[K]] I’ll lay whatever I need to to make sure he gets better. Plus we have good insurance.
Dec 1, 2019 2:01pm
It is a blessing to have good insurance.

He's been working hard. Will this endanger his ability to graduate? It is possible to ask for extensions from professors.
Dec 1, 2019 2:05pm
I don’t think it will, no. He’s been working his ass off to make sure he gets everything done on time. He keeps talking about how he has to do more work tonight but I told him we’ll worry about that later. His assignments due in the next few days have a rough draft at the very least, so he could always turn that in if he needs to.
