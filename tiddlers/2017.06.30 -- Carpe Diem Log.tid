title: 2017.06.30 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Today has been a great day!
* I woke up, and spanked that monkey.
* I cleaned the house. It was in good shape, so it didn't take long. The kids helped.
* I played some league and surfed some.
* When my wife came home at midday, we did a bit more cleaning. 
* We hit the library, and then we went grocery shopping.
** We found the bulk beef that's super cheap. Yay!
** I hope we have all that we need.
* I put food away and prepared tiny 1 lb packets for the meat.
* I made chili.
* More league of legends and surfing, a bit of writing too.
* L&K came first. It was great to see them. We talked. =)
* My brother came later. We immediately went straight for the school.
** Everything was shutdown, but the machinist teacher left his garage door open. We snuck in that way, and we found that the welder's shop wasn't locked. We then went through the grinding room to get into the pipefitter shop. 
** I showed my brother around. Showed him the simulator. I was glad he got to see it.
** We did some welding and had some visuals of things we had talked about before.
** I was really glad I got to show my brother the shop. It was a capstone to the class for me.
* We headed back home for chili.
* We talked and talked, and then we got ready for DND.
* We played a bit before we went to bed. It was fun. 
* I'm finishing this off right now and watching some TSM v C9.
