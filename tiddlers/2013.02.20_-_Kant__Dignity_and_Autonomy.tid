title: 2013.02.20 - Kant: Dignity and Autonomy

 Let me begin by saying: I feel like I’m quickly becoming lost in the “Kantonese” (as you aptly call it). The fact that I may not be “getting it” must be my fault. Admittedly, many issues and definitions in the text are unsettled for me to the point that I’m not entirely sure what Kant means to say in many of the passages we are reading. Something as technical and terminologically based as our reading needs a worthy lexicon if we are to come up with an effective systematic interpretation (I’ve been looking at a couple, and I’m unsatisfied so far).

Anyways, I’ve several thoughts, worries, and questions, but I’m only going to cover a couple for the sake of time and space.

In 4:433, I think “kingdom” is an interesting word choice because we normally think of someone be ruled by someone or something else in a kingdom. Being a member a kingdom, some might say, demonstrates a distinct lack of autonomy in certain respects. Kant says we belong to this kingdom as a “sovereign” because we are subject to our own laws, not subject to others laws. Those laws just happen to be the same law though. But, in 4:434, I feel like I’ve lost what Kant means by sovereign.

I believe Kant needs the three versions of the moral law to be logically equivalent (they need to logically imply each other). Why should I think the three versions of the moral law are logically equivalent? I want a breakdown.

4:434 continues to be tricky as it discusses “freedom of the will.” I still don’t know what Kant means by this. I’m still not entirely sure I understand what Kant means by “the will” at all. Kant’s conception of our psychology (and metaphysics) is unclear, and that’s a shame given how specific he seems to try to be in employing our psychology in his moral theory.

Are we not autonomous when we don’t make our own laws? It seems like it (that’s what the heteronomous will seems to be all about). We only make our own laws when we employ the CI, right? If so, it seems like we are only autonomous when we employ the CI, right? Now, if autonomy is the basis of our moral responsibility (most think it is), then when we do not employ the CI, are we essentially not morally responsible? I’ve asked this before, and so you’ll have to forgive my ignorance. I fear I still don’t understand. Admittedly, I’m worried that Kant is just begging the question as to what counts as rational, autonomous, etc.

Lastly, if Kant is not an incompatibilist (and you suggest he isn’t), then is he a compatibilist? (Heaven forbid.) What would be the effects of having an incompatibilist interpretation of Kant? What does he say to someone with incompatibilist intuitions? That intuition is so strong for me that I’d deny our moral responsibility if I found I was sufficiently convinced that we lack libertarian free will (whether it be a homunculus or something else :P).

February 20: Dignity and Autonomy

Groundwork Section II (pp. 4:431-445)

Critique of Practical Reason (pp. 5:33-42)



Worries from the get-go:

If Kant is not an incompatibilist, is he a compatibilist? (Heaven forbid) What would be the effects of having an incompatibilist interpretation of Kant.


I believe Kant needs the three versions of the moral law to be logically equivalent (they need to logically imply each other). Why should I think the three versions of the moral law are logically equivalent? I want a breakdown! =)


I’m quickly becoming lost in the ‘Kantonese.’


I’m so worried that Kant is just begging the question of what counts as rational and what counts as the will so that his theory works.


Are we not autonomous when we don’t make our own laws? It seems like it. We only make our own laws when we employ the CI, right? If so, it seems like we are only autonomous when we employ the CI, right? Now, if autonomy is the basis of our moral responsibility (most think it is), then when we do not employ the CI, are we essentially not morally responsible?



Groundwork Section II (pp. 4:431-445)


4:431, “the subject of all ends is every rational being as an end in itself”


4:431, “the will of every rational being as a will giving universal law”


4:432, if we are merely a subject of a law, like laws of nature, then it wouldn’t be us choosing to follow the laws; if a law arises from our own will, then it would be us choosing to follow the laws


4:433, kingdom of ends is dependent upon autonomy


4:433, all rational beings are under the law to treat other rational never as merely a means but also as ends, giving rise to systematic union under common law, hence kingdom (of ends)


4:433, kingdom is an interesting word choice because we normally think of someone be ruled by someone else in a kingdom. Being a member a kingdom, some might say, demonstrates a distinct lack of autonomy in certain respects. Kant says we belong to this kingdom as a “sovereign” because we are subject to our own laws, not subject to other's laws. Those laws just happen to be the same law though.


4:434, freedom of the will…I still don’t know what Kant means by this. I’m still not entirely sure I understand what Kant means by “the will” at all. Kant’s conception of our psychology (and metaphysics) is unclear, and that’s a shame given how specific he seems to try to be in employing our psychology in his moral theory


4:434, no, I clearly don’t understand what Kant means by Sovereign at all.


4:434, Everything has either a price or a dignity. That which has no price (people) has dignity.


4:436, “Nothing can have a worth other than that which the law determines for it” – lawgiving itself, which determines worth, has dignity. Autonomy is the ground of dignity.


4:436, All maxims have: a form, a matter (an end), a complete determination (harmonizes with the kingdom of ends)


4:439, I don’t understand the paradox


4:441, when some other object other than the will give it a law, heteronomy of the will results.


4:442, empirical principles (including happiness) cannot ground the moral law



Critique of Practical Reason (pp. 5:33-42)


5:33, independence from external forces is freedom in the negative sense, while giving oneself law, practical reason, is freedom in the positive sense.
