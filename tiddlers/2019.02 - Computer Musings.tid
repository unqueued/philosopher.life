!! Audit:

* Extremely brief! I've just been too busy to mess with machines that much.
** Your children have been handling things as well.
* Half of these are outside gunk! Look at that. What the hell does it mean?
** It's not primary, it is losing power, it is woven into other things, it is being sublated?
** It has overlap, but it isn't the primary point somehow?
* Git has settled (for now). 
* Turns out Chrome on Android is the only bullet-proof browser for VPN access to Bob on [[m10]].
* I'm going to miss TW5Nav on the phone tremendously. It came within 25% of the speed of what I can do on [[m10]]. I'm going to lose that. That's okay. Being able to use the wiki from the phone is just a gift, not a requirement.
* I have to thank [[j3d1h]] again. She makes this possible with me. There are few problems that get solved without her help and consultation.
* I'm bummed by the loss of signing. The only way to get it back is a minutely hack inside a VM with a browser to go singlefile.
** I can afford that though...128GB RAM, remember? I'm going to run Bob inside a VM too.
*** WAIT! That should be called [[monster-13]], right? I've never actually given a monster-name to my VMs. I can't believe this is going to happen!
