title: 2019.04.17 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Sport

!! What is your favorite sport? Why?

Making fun of sportsball and its fans. I'm a hater. Athletics are celebrated over academics; that's insane. I think sports have become a tool of oppression. Sports are meant to pacify the masses into holding strong opinions about teams that don't actually matter. I think they are irrelevant narratives. It's about not actually participating in what matters. I don't care for this kind of drug. I think citizens owe all the rest of us an informed participation in politics, and that requires significant literacy, research, and dialectics.

I do like to watch e-sports because I'm a hypocrite. I especially like watching games against AI. I'm fascinated by what is unintuitive about it. I'm not a fanatic though, and I feel like I meet my basic political obligations.

Enjoy athletics, but not at the expense of your moral duties. As always, everything in moderation (to the Golden mean).
