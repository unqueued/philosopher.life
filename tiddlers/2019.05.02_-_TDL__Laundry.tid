title: 2019.05.02 - TDL: Laundry

* Laundry: it piles up. I need to push.
** The table just sits, lol.
* We have a lot of beef, and we aren't doing anything with it.
* I think it is about time to take another crack at m16, and this time with another monitor. I would like to borrow one from the college if I can.
** or, just wait for the refund as previously planned.
* We seem to be in a BB mood, and I'm thinking 2 last a time is a fine pace. I am worried that will not be good for their homework and freetime. 
** Get real: the take that freetime at will when you aren't there, lol.
* Continue taking care of yourself: that systemic infection needs to die.
