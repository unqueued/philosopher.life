title: 2017.12.11 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Travel Wish

!! If you could travel anywhere in the world for a vacation, where would it be and why?

Mi'lady, you endow me with yet another wish. Do I need to know the exact location, to what extent? If I am given wiggle room, if you enable some interpretation, then I would elect to visit a place that would enable me to transfer enormous mounts of power and wealth to those who deserve it. I'm sure there are, behind many closed doors, opportunities for such things, especially if you allow me to magically exit my vacation in a way that I entered. Of course, I'm tempted to travel into you as well; talk about a magical entrance.

Does it have to be a normal vacation spot? How abnormal can it be? Can I orbit a space station circling the earth, or is that "on" rather than "in" the world? Can I visit the Mariana Trench in a submersible? How specific does the spot have to be? I would absolutely adore a tour of China. But, at that rate, would I not tour the entire world itself?

I would love to head to Peru for some legit ayahuasca, puking my guts out while seeing that alternate reality concocted by my brain. Ah, perhaps that is where I really want to go, to a place my mind is capable of reaching. Genie, I wish to travel to Nirvana, or true eternal happiness, or a perpetual eudaimonic experience machine, or a special "state of mind" overlay on top of reality that enabled me to achieve eudaimonia here. 

While perhaps not physically (or metaphysically?) possible, could I technically travel and survey metaphysics itself? Who would not want to see that heaven-hellscape? The transcendental would, of course, be an interesting place to go. I don't even know what that means, and I'm afraid that you cannot either. 

Travel is such an odd notion. Traveling inside myself is arguably what I'm doing here in the wiki. Do you think I will be able to find happiness? Be honest with me, my love.
