[3:13 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Hope your day is going well so far. :slight_smile:
[3:13 PM] h0p3: Working hard with the offspring. Currently in [[h0p3ful Review]].
[3:17 PM] h0p3: How about you? Is it going well?
[3:34 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Not too bad! Got a lot to get done before spring break haha
[3:34 PM] h0p3: Ah, like what?
[3:34 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Going shopping later for groceries too. [[L]] wants to start stockpiling in case of corona virus scare.
[3:34 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Unpacking boxes of lost library books from the renovation. :slight_smile:
[3:34 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Weâ€™re finally on the last set.
[3:34 PM] h0p3: Noice.
[3:35 PM] h0p3: Will it have any impact on your position when there aren't any boxes to unpack?
[3:36 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Nah. There are countless metal tins with even more to unpack in the RRS (Robotic Retrieval System). They want me to get those too hahaha.
[3:36 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Maybe 50,000 more books if I had to guess.
[3:36 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Hell. Maybe 100,000
[4:26 PM] h0p3: So many books, so little time.

[8:45 PM] h0p3: How'd your day go?
[8:46 PM] Ardent_Assailant: not too bad! last day of work before spring break :slight_smile:
[8:46 PM] Ardent_Assailant: how about you?
[8:47 PM] h0p3: Noice. You got any plans for spring break?
[8:47 PM] h0p3: I'm doing well. Been a busy day being a dad.
[8:50 PM] Ardent_Assailant: [[L]] and I are taking a staycation. Between the stress of the medicine and finances we just wanna take it easy.
[8:50 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Dad days are fun haha
[8:51 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I hope it's a good one
[8:51 PM] h0p3: Staycation ftw.
[8:51 PM] h0p3: Not always, but this one was fun. :slight_smile:
[8:51 PM] h0p3: I like that we have the chance to talk for hours. It cannot be replaced.
[8:52 PM] h0p3: Well, I wish you great food, great sex, and great sleep on your staycation, sir.
[8:52 PM] h0p3: Hopefully some gaming too.
[8:53 PM] h0p3: Will [[L]] be taking time off with you?
[9:06 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Likewise. :slight_smile: I look forward to the break convos we'll have next week. :)

Thanks! I'm hoping for all those great things too haha. And yes, I implored her to take it off with me so we could have some time together to explore Louisville
[9:15 PM] Ardent_Assailant: My doctor wants me to go to a urologist, but I don't really see the point tbh, lol
[9:16 PM] h0p3: Seems worth thinking about. Might be a point; I simply don't know enough.
[9:17 PM] Ardent_Assailant: My numbness is slowly going away. Monday was the last bad day. I have another weird issue right now but it's something I think will get better with time as hormones regulate
[9:23 PM] h0p3: At the end of the day, you'll have to make those decisions. No one else can. I would be less concerned if I knew I could go back to the urologist at any point. I also don't know how much this costs you. Seems like you are pretty confident but still willing doubt and research.
[9:31 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yeah that isn't an issue thank goodness. The more I read about zoloft the more annoyed I get that my doc wasn't forthright with these side effects. But since it is getting better and I'm back at some semblance of normal, I'm okay to ride out for a bit to see if things improve.
[10:22 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Phew. We almost cleared a new raid. Got really close!
[10:25 PM] h0p3: Delicious. That is a good feeling too. I like making progress in new raid content.
[10:25 PM] h0p3: There's a place where you can't clear, but next week, withone improving their characters and knowing more about the encounters, it's cleaner and you get further.
[11:09 PM] Ardent_Assailant: We can totally clear this next time. :slight_smile: just gotta see the mechanics a little bit more.
