* Stunning!
** https://www.e-flux.com/journal/81/125815/on-the-unhappy-consciousness-of-neoreactionaries/
*** God damn, son. Can't say I agree to the conclusion, but it depends.
*** Do I need to reach out? Have I met a long-lost cousin? Probably wouldn't give two-shits about me, and that's cool. Probably worth saying, "hello."

*** No need for experts that will cause problems for you, right? Capitalists only care for the humanities insofar as they maximize their hedons and are useful for exploiting humanity itself.

* Confirm My Bias
** http://ftp.iza.org/dp12282.pdf
*** Most people are bullshitters, but the wealthy are going to tend to have the competitive edge (and are raised to have it).

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/elizabeth-warren-student-debt-plan-gives-two-thirds-of-its-benefits-to-the-top-40-percent/
*** I'm tired of trusting people. =/

* Think About It
** https://qz.com/quartzy/1588115/instagram-influencers-are-out-slackers-are-in/
*** It depends on what you mean by slacker, as always. If I have to arbitrarily draw a line, why not say 80% of your waking life should be spent working your ass off. But, ofc, on what and for what? There it is easy to be cast as a slacker without being useless (just useless to those who wish to exploit you). I think we are obligated to be more than slacktivists.
** https://www.cs.bu.edu/~jappavoo/Resources/Papers/unikernel-hotos19.pdf
*** Probably inevitable in several domains, but I'm not convinced this is good the average person in general. I'm not convinced there is a way out of this specialization.
** https://iai.tv/articles/does-consciousness-come-in-degrees-auid-1226
*** I'm slow. I don't see why 2 and 3 are so easy to peel apart. I am, of course, convinced that the 4th option is [[The Objective]].

*** What a weird comparison and claim, right? I can (often must) have music as complete background, but I have to be purposely multi-tasking to listen to a podcast (or audiobook) and get work done too. 
*** I just don't get why people like podcasts. I must be retarded. I can handle rawness, amateur work, and the humanity (I adore it in some cases). When it comes to content though, what podcast is really worth my time? There are people I want to speak with directly, and there are famous lectures and debates I want to hear, but I don't see why reading isn't a better use of my time (especially with music!).

** https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/04/18/workers-of-the-world-embrace-your-value-chains/
*** Uh, make sure they are "your" value chains though, as in: the workers must own the means of production. Don't forget that part because it's kind of important. =)

*** Nabbed a copy.

*** Plenty of blessed arguments against centralization of power and surveillance. There's some awesome //wat// in there.
** https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-welcome-to-shanghai-the-capital-of-the-future/
*** Principle-agent problem affects everyone, and I still have no idea how the recession might affect them, including their dark banking. As usual, I know almost nothing.
