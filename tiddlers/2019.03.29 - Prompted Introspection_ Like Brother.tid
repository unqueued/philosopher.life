title: 2019.03.29 - Prompted Introspection: Like Brother

!! How are you like one of your brothers or sisters?

I share a great deal in common with both of my brothers. Here's an important one: we don't trust our donors to varying [[dok]]. It's sad, but it's also an important sanity check. I think we've developed a profound cynicism as we shed and wrestle with years of psychological abuse. My brothers have both received counseling, and I am glad they have another source of basic sanity to help them reason about their lives.
