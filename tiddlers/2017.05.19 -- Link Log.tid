* I've alway found Dark Matter to seem ad hoc. I'm not saying it isn't a possible explanation, but it certainly doesn't feel right. It feels forced, like an ugly constant. -- http://nautil.us/issue/48/chaos/the-physicist-who-denies-dark-matter
* My darker opinion is that algorithms will herd the retards among us to vote for the algorithms which make wealthy and powerful people even wealthier and more powerful; the winners here won't be The People -- https://www.wired.com/2017/05/hear-lets-elect-ai-president/?mbid=synd_digg
* Fuck 'em, write your personal essays anyways -- http://www.newyorker.com/culture/jia-tolentino/the-personal-essay-boom-is-over?mbid=synd_digg
* There is much to say here. One fun note I want to point out is how consciousness is thought to be about minimizing surprise, and yet I think that humor, entertainment, and learning are a kind of controlled and highly contextual way of pushing these kinds of boundaries and surprising ourselves (perhaps as a way of learning not to be surprised?). -- https://aeon.co/essays/consciousness-is-not-a-thing-but-a-process-of-inference
** nautil.us and aeon.co are clearly valuable in my eyes 
* Classism and Evolutionary Considerations about Stress -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYG0ZuTv5rs
** You will be healthier and live longer when you subordinate others. Those in charge literally live better and longer lives. Eudaimonia and Ethics are not always compatible.
* Our purchasing power is decreasing; I think there are serious caveats and exceptions to consider in both directions here -- http://davkett.com/en/much-purchasing-power-americans-lost-last-decade/
* Color me surprised, Uber doing evil? You mean their "innovation" isn't ultimately for the benefit of humanity? What? Say it ain't so. --  https://gizmodo.com/uber-doesn-t-want-you-to-see-this-document-about-its-va-1795151637
* Interesting book -- http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine
* As much flak as I see LSC get, sometimes they really do fucking get it -- https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/6c5e8p/worth_the_read/
