title: 2018.10.29 - Employment: Applying

* Applied to a church secretary position. So many evils in front of me.
** Filled.
* Applied to an after-school program leader position.
** I actually care about that position. I'd need to think quite a bit about how to do it well.
** ''Immediately scheduled for an interview.''
* Applied to IT Technician position for JC
** It's recent and only open for a bit. Interesting to know I don't have much time for applications here.
** I'm going to bet this position is already filled, but they have to make it look like it isn't. Nepotism is rampant.
** Very annoying application process.
