** I've only seen one of his posts before.
* Protestant Apologist (perhaps not always), splash of mysticism (ineffable [[beauty]] focus?), probably volunteers, has seen a face of poverty, seeking community, interested in systematic reasoning and emotion (good!), and (uncharitably I am open to) possibly post-frontal-lobe development Christian seeking localized pragmatism and stoic mutability based on some variant of egoism (more eudaimonic than hedonic from the looks) in his personality shaping.
* Jung.
* English spelling.
* Arts and Animation
** Self-identifies as "creative Type 4 melancholic loner"
* Personal finance crowd.
* He would adore my wife.
** Seems to be exploring Biblical studies, Theology, and Contemporary Christianity, but I can't gauge his knowledge yet.
* Publicly hedged-conservative, but takes risk with purpose, particularly proselytizing.
* Went out on a limb with SSC (though they are clearly to the political right [and hence embrace the epistemologies which enable it], so trying to bridge the evangelical trad to SSC-Reactionary-Cult is not as insane to me as others might think).
* Articulate, self-taught, highly personal, apologizes, argues with integrity, demonstrates charity, knows how to listen, points out rhetoric too. <3
* Clearly concerned with authority (and appearances of coming correct), probably has non-trivial bents toward order and respect and yet is obviously open (artist). I don't see a traditionalist in this person though, but it is hard to imagine he doesn't learn from tradition.
* Probably not much achievement and hedonic value orientation; prefers stimulation and serving others. Super curious person, high openness. Introverted, yes. I find the person conscientious (seems aware to me), but others may not (hard to tell). Kindly disagreeable, likely.
* True Believer, Scotsman, and Remnant.
* Calvinism?

* Looks right to me
