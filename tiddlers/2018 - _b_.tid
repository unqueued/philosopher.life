!! Audit:

* This log saw much heavier usage in the first half of the year.
** Imho, as the wiki has sprawled, congealed, and morphed, [[/b/]] has become less necessary. 
*** New Journal tiddler tool has made this wiki significantly different.
* Substance use, Rabbitholing, politics, psychology, and highly personal (nearly [[h0p3's Log]]) material are all in here: this is such an emotional tool for me.
* There is clearly wrestling with where content goes and why (classic fucking wiki problem if I ever heard of one).
* I'm flippant with myself. If there was a log to do that in, it would be this one. =)
* I can literally fucking see [[FTO]] evolving here. Wow.
** Interestingly, it has evolved away from my [[Donors]]. That isn't to say they don't cloud my thoughts often, but it isn't to the same [[dok]] that I have to [[/b/]] it.
