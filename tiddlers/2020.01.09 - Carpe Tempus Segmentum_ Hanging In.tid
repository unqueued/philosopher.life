* Fireman Time!
* Encouraged offspring
* Unloaded all the pods
** My son's idea was much better than mine.
** Sifted for what we needed immediately.
* Tracy at 94(?) stopped by to speak with us. Friendly neighbor. Nifty. 
** She said to stop by. We must bring her dessert.
* Chatted with folks. 
** My throat hurts. =/
* Ribs, salad, pineapple, shepherd's pie, wedges
* //Psych//
** So good to have even a semblance of a living room. 
* Worked on my wife's new machine
** I'm so glad she was granted admin privileges. 
** Should be all set for [[j3d1h]] to finish off Bob
*** Need to prevent publishing to make sure the privacy toolchain will function correctly. Maybe Saturday.
