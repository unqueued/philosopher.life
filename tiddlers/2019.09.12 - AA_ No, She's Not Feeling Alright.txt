How are your classes going?
MON 12:55 PM
Hey, you feeling alright?
THU 12:44 PM
Yeah —took Gpa to the heart dr yesterday. It went ok.
THU 12:44 PM
Ah. That sounds like it could be intense. I'm glad it okay.
THU 12:45 PM
The lady admin here at school is not the best—she tends to make assumptions and get mad over silly things
THU 12:47 PM
Ugh. She treating you right?
THU 12:48 PM
Struggling with that —extra meds
THU 12:48 PM
Not really but fighting it right now won’t get me anywhere but further in poop
THU 12:48 PM
I feel that pain. I'm trying not to speak my mind to my authority at the moment for the same reason.
THU 12:49 PM
I shall wait until it calms down to talk to her...the male admin is awesome! I usually deal with him
THU 12:50 PM
Biding your time, planning, taking extra meds, and sounds like you are doing the balancing act to stay out of the pit. You are kicking ass.
THU 12:56 PM
I'm sorry she's mad about silly things. It's a waste of energy.
THU 12:57 PM
Thank you —really trying but the pit seems warm and cozy though I know it is not
THU 12:57 PM
She doesn’t see in herself the things she does to others as bad —but if others behaved the way she does, she would correct them
THU 1:18 PM
Hypocrisy is infuriating.
THU 1:18 PM
Anywho...gpa is in excellent health for his age —he could work circles around me—these surgeries should be fairly simple as long as he doesn’t have any blockages or vein issues
THU 1:19 PM
May you have gotten those health genes :blush:
THU 1:20 PM
Yes hypocrisy angers me
THU 1:20 PM
Yeah, I hope I got them healthy genes. Something has to make up for the way I eat and sit all day, lol.
THU 1:24 PM
He wasn’t the most active while on the road for those 25 years —he mostly ate and sat until he found out he had the Beatus then he lost weight.
THU 1:33 PM
He really didn’t do the gym thing until he moved here —mostly out of boredom
THU 1:34 PM
I'm pretty convinced I'll eventually have the Beatus or some sort of heart malfunction. They did bloodwork this summer, and they said my Triglycerides were ridiculously high.
THU 1:36 PM
Yeah he has taken cholesterol meds but some of them give him muscle cramps
THU 1:38 PM
The Beatus is so fun.... sigh
