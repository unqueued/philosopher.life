title: 2018.11.20 - Employment: Appears Employed

Woot!

I was going to call my interviewer for a postmortem since I thought I pwned the interview but somehow didn't get the job. Turns out, I did get the job. She just called. I am now a paid babysitter that appears to have the chance to program however he wants. I'm going to get paid to show chillun how to reason, use computers, play games, and eat snacks. That sounds like a fine job (though I can't say younger children are my favorite to teach, I've done fine before). My children are going to enjoy it too. 

It's not a lot of money, but it would probably be enough to float. We don't live like Spartans, but we are fairly efficient. This job is at least in the moral ballpark. I need to think about my wardrobe (well, my shelf). I have to appear respectable for the monkeys in us all.

I'm told her Monday is the earliest I could contact Kathy (HR). We are traveling (starting today). This is likely a good thing since I enjoyed a blissful evening last night (the first since [[2018.10.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Wiff Muh Bruh]]). I'll be testing myself, and I'm already prepared to study for the test if I need.

I should keep hunting.

Apparently, I passed the second stage interview for the DCS position as well. Neat. I was completely convinced that I couldn't get this job either.
