title: 2017.02.24 - Realpolitik Speculation: Redpilled Socialism

//Intelligent and honest Redpillers know socialism|Socialism is a devastatingly accurate description of capitalism and human economics. The prescription is all that is left.//

The Idealism of Socialism is that which is intellectually honest in a wide range of anti-capitalist arguments. And, guess what? It exists! There are numerous, incredibly justified reasons we should not accept capitalism. There is a reasonable pattern of thought you may not have considered, but you should. You feel like you've done that path, but you haven't. You know people are evil, but you've not been willing to run with it, to put in your pocket, to really see the world through that lens. Now, apply that rule "people are evil," and take it the nth degree. See what turns out to be real and what doesn't. 

You just haven't been charitable enough to socialism. You've failed to effectively interpret human beings as being evil when they become powerful (it's just a fact). You should not trust authority. //Pay attention//. We learned about socialism in all the wrong way. We were wrong about what it was. It wasn't evil. You've been brainwashed to believe what you do. Here, take your redpill. 

# /Hands(h0p3, Redpill, [your name here])
#  I require your consent. Have charity now. You have to be a willing participant in the acquisition of life-changing knowledge. The loss of innocence requires the curiosity of the Tree of Knowledge. Does it hurt? Yes. Is it worth it? Probably. 
# You have to assume you could be wrong, about everything. You have to be willing to be wrong about everything. Have the humility to consider the possibility, to be honest with yourself in relation to the world. 
# I patiently wait for you to swallow it.
# ..
# Let me show you the real world:

Socialism describes capitalism as a socioeconomic system (or family of such systems) based on the exploitation of the labor force through private ownership of the means of production. Capitalist society is structured so as to reward the most socially adept abusers of human nature. It is a meritocracy for elite psychopaths and psychopathic bloodlines. It enables the psychopathic segment of our species to enslave us. Capitalism is a vicious game of egoism in which only the most redpilled with //weak moral compasses// and// the means to exploit the poor and weak// become successful (and eventually totalitarian) predators. 

Capitalism is the result of applied social Darwinism. Socialism is an attempt to describe this human game, and it posits that a revolution, revolt, or uprising against capitalism and private (but not personal) ownership is inevitable. Whether or not this borderline faith-based position on revolution is true is irrelevant to the fundamental truths in the description of capitalism. Revolution is a prescription, but socialism is fundamentally descriptive (that's where it's power lay). It's redpilled when it's done correctly too! It is a very profound description of human history, our current world, and continues to give us good explanations for why the world changes as it does in profound ways (not everything, of course). 

We start with labor and value. Labor adds value to materials. We generate value by embedding our labor (time, energy, effort, etc.) into products; part of who we are is imbued in the things we labor to create. The total value a worker creates through their labor is productivity value. There may be many kinds of metaethical value, but this one is fundamentally important to us all. It's part of being an agent that we labor. Who owns this labor, and the results of it, productivity value, to what extent, and why? 

For the capitalist, productivity value can be split into two major kinds: wage value and surplus value.<<ref "1">> A product's wage value is used to pay the worker. The value generated beyond the wages paid to the worker is surplus value; it is the source of profit.<<ref "2">> Surplus value can be used to pay constant capital<<ref "3">> costs, replacing the means of production, technology, marketing, distribution, finances, human resources, logistics, expansion, security, competitive advantages, political influence, taxes, etc. The remaining surplus is profit.<<ref "4">>

Capitalists hire workers to create products. Capitalists sell these products for approximately the productivity value, pay (legally required) wage value to workers, pay (economically required) constant capital costs, and keep the rest as profit. This profit is often used to cyclically generate more capital; capital begets capital. At first glance, this may not seem problematic (especially to those socially conditioned to accept it). Unfortunately, the repeated application of this business cycle results in dangerous shifts in the power dynamics of a society, and this results in the capitalist exploitation of the working class.

Capitalism is not stable; it is driven by the neverending generation of competitive advantage (naturally or artificially). Capitalists must consistently reinvest in their constant capital to continue to be profitable.<<ref "5">> One crucial method to generating competitive advantage as a corporation is to have as few employees as possible and to pay them as little as they will accept. As a consequence, wages are suppressed at all costs (morality is deemed irrelevant here) and human labor is price-efficiently replaced with technology and streamlined processes/logistics.<<ref "6">> As human labor is replaced, workers become unemployed. Unemployment forces wages down. The unemployed, the army of reserve labor, compete for available jobs. The higher the supply of laborers, the lower they must sell their labor-power to capitalists. Thus, capitalists are engaged in the continual process of maximizing the productivity value of labor while paying lower and lower wages to fewer and fewer people for it.<<ref "7">> 

This vicious cycle enables capitalists to tighten their grip on the working class. Over time, there are fewer and fewer employers hiring fewer and fewer employees, while simultaneously paying lower and lower wages. The unemployed become desperate. They will accept worse and lower material conditions to survive. What other choice do they have? Capitalists exploit workers insofar as workers have no other options. When capitalists own all the means of production, workers have no other choice but to accept wages artificially depressed further and further below the productivity value of their labor (if they can find employment at all). 

As capitalists centralize power and monopolize the means of productions, there is a corresponding increase in the rate and degree of enslavement of the working class. In a vast human economic pyramid scheme, we find repeating cycles of wealth trickling upwards with power centralizing and rising to the top. The working class loses opportunities, freedoms, and bargaining powers as they become splintered, suppressed, and controlled. Capitalism devours the majority, and this time, it appears to be the driving force behind the extinction of our species.

As the working class becomes aware of the causes of the crisis (developing class consciousness), capitalists must oppress them even harder. Of course, workers who complain, bargain, or fight back will be punished. Submission appears to be the only practical option. Oppression branches out much further than that. Our surveillance state exists to maintain capitalist power. Our media is consolidated and owned by capitalists seeking to subvert and undermine resistance to their power. We are engaged in wars not for the freedom of our people, but for the enslavement of mankind, to the benefit of capitalists. 

Our laws are written by capitalists. Our politicians are capitalists bought by capitalists. Our law enforcers are capitalists bought by capitalists. Our judicial branch has its capitalist corruptions as well. From local, to regional, to state, to national, to international contexts, capitalists own and control us. The rat race is very real, and slavery has only become more complex in implementation, kind, and degree. Many fail to see capitalism for what it really is: a game theoretic, absurdly complex, psychopathically owned and operated form of slavery.

Capitalism is a helluva drug. It is an incredibly viral meme that injects itself into the core of its hosts so deeply that it alters their fundamental behaviors, empathies, hatred, beliefs, and desires in systematic, long-term ways. Our culture is being swallowed by this Egoistic memetic network crawling through the human species like an epidemic. It's tendrils control our minds. The allure of selfishness is too profound, especially for the powerful and those with the means to maximize their personal pleasure at the expense of anyone they can find the will power to dehumanize. It is quite the meme, this invisible-appearing force. It is a category of a kind of viral creature that exists and reproduces in our minds. 

This is an apt description of human motivations, history, the memetic nature of our problems, and reality. Socialism is thought to demonstrate the material conditions and crises of capitalism. Insofar as socialism relies upon material conditions to do its intellectual heavy lifting, it remains a description which lacks idealism. It only provides us the contextual content of maxims; it only provides us instrumental reason, hypothetical imperatives. It only describes the motivations and historical cycles of humanity. Even if it correctly predicts revolution (which may itself be inaccurate in the information age; Marx could not have foreseen everything), it does not, in itself, show why we should revolt against capitalism and slavery. 

Ultimately, socialism describes what "is" but not "ought." Marxist versions of socialism pre-describes revolution as the outcome (and hopes for improvements), but it cannot normatively prescribe because it does not give us an underlying moral theory. It is a political and economic theory, but not a moral one. Too often, I see Redpillers conflate the "is" of capitalism (as described by socialism) with the "ought" which follows from the prescription. Essentially, these psychopaths think prescription and description are the same. That is the naturalistic fallacy is in its barest form.

We must be empathic towards the poor, the weak, and the needy, regardless of our station in life. We must have [[Redpilled Empathy]]. We must end capitalism because we must end slavery because slavery lacks empathy. Redpilled Socialism is an application of the golden rule inside of capitalist systems. It's a variant of the Veil of Ignorance.

The only aspect of socialism, as a description, which I worry about is its prediction of revolution. The assumption seems to be that the poor and disenfranchised will eventually do something about it. I think it fails to understand the nature of technology and its ability to maintain the status of quo of enslavement, to protect the Hyperclass, and to prevent, disarm, and defeat any attempts at a revolution.

Why should we think socialism' predicted revolution will ever occur? Sure, hope for the best, vote for it, teach people it, see the reason in it, morally expect us to follow socialized prescription, but you have to be practical about what you predict will happen. It is basic utilitarian thought that cannot be escaped. You hope for the best, but plan for the worst. I want to see the end of capitalism because it would honestly make the world a better place; it is the only chance for the survival of the human species. I'd love to have grandchildren, to see the world happy and healthy. But, it isn't going to happen. You must see the necessity of protecting our selves from the world and preparing for the inevitable disasters approaching our species. 

I would be rejected from socialist circles for saying this. I want to point out that I'm not claiming "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em." I support the end of capitalism, but I'm not convinced it will actually occur due to both the raw intelligence, wealth, and power of our ruling class and the stupidity, poverty, and weakness of the proletariat. Only a fool would think that 3.5% of the population composed of proletarians would be able to overthrow the capitalist yoke; that noose is on tight, and the weapons of coercion are beyond what Marx could have fathomed. Inequality only continues to grow on the metrics that matter. Of course, there always remains the possibility that socialist revolution will occur (however small it may be). Until then, I'm going to prepare as though it isn't going to happen because that is the best evidence I have. Basically, I think my socialist brethren are deeply wrong; there is a better and more accurate pragmatic socialist prescription. I will protect my family from a world of psychopaths, and I will try to do so without being psychopathic towards the world. Accepting the reality of our shitty human nature's accuratizes our predictions and therefore appropriately tempers our expectations. This is pragmatic hope. As far as I can tell, it is the best prescription I have at the moment.

The moral of the story, thus far, understand and support socialism, but don't assume or hope that others will have the willpower, integrity, and moral virtue to take the Redpill and actually be good people. You've taken the Redpill, so you know: no one escapes being selfish.
