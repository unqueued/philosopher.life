Woke up yesterday to a loud crash—[[UJ]] broke one of the wooden chairs. He says the leg was weak. Yet another [[UJ]]  Combat Swivel chair made...the tradition continues hehe (He has broken several chairs including a car seat of Shannon’s which Shannon renamed the “[[UJ]]  Memorial Combat Swivel Chair” :blush:
