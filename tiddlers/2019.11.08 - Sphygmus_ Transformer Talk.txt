I quietly write this existentially isolating autopoietic self-idiom to (and seek the approval of) both current and future generations of autists. It is my hope that by sharing this with you, I may one day be able to pass my wisdom onto future generations of Autistic people and vice versa.

I'm an autist and I have no words for this. I don't know how to explain it. The way it feels is that I've just experienced a very powerful and deeply personal moment of self-discovery. I feel that I have seen into the core of my very own being and the self that others can only see by viewing their own behavior.

This is a very emotional and powerful thing to say, so if I get it wrong or it's unclear in any way, please know I am very, very sorry.

So if you're an autist and you want to
[12:40 PM] h0p3: Thank you. :slight_smile: Lol.
[12:40 PM] robotic_scarab: i'm afraid to stick my own writing in :rofl:
[12:45 PM] h0p3: I'm still laughing, lol.
[12:46 PM] robotic_scarab: that one got me too, aha
[12:48 PM] h0p3: I was going to write to Brynne (http://iwillansweryouremails.com/) aided by this, but now I need to speak with this being as everyone else.
[12:53 PM] h0p3: [I am taking on and using some of your vocabulary - this is something that happens to me, I notice - my voice and dreams are malleable, molded by the books or people or voices or games or obsessions I immerse myself in.]

My goal is to create a voice that is authentic to me. So when I make a recording - it is for me, for me to use and be the one to decide how I would want it used. When you are recording a voice that has no intention of being used, I guess you can say, it is a gift. I will have to make sure that I can do it, as my recording of my life will always be available, on my blog, in audio and on audio books and other formats and media. It will never be deleted, or hidden.

So for me this will be the most important part
[12:53 PM] robotic_scarab: ahah! that's amazing
