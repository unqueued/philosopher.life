title: 2020.01.25 - Wiki Review: Escape Limbo Chaos

* [[2020.01.24 - Wiki Review: Toward Settled Habits]]
** Completed. I'm so ready to be back in a groove. I'm off in this limbo chaos. Still, it's a small price to pay for the jump in opportunity for stability. It might be a first for us. =)
* [[2020.01.24 - TDL: DMV]]
** We did what we could. Clusterfuck with the DMV (probably the worst I've had in almost 20 years of dealing with DMVs).
* [[2020.01.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Solid Push]]
** The battlestation is not complete (and it can't until I've finished all the networking and arranging personal effects), but it's so much better. 
*** I love my position in the living room too. It's not larger than what we had in JC, but it's been simplified.
**** We probably need to run power cords into the couches for folks. 
***** I still need buy lists from folks.
* [[2020.01.24 - Prompted Introspection: Loved]]
** [[Love]] is painful in a world which lacks it.
* [[Being Nice]]
** It was surprising to see how many kinds of mental deficiency this fit.
