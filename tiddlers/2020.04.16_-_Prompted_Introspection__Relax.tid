title: 2020.04.16 - Prompted Introspection: Relax

!! Where would you go to relax and why?

[[2018.07.19 - Prompted Introspection: Relaxing Destination]] is fine. I have more to say, and I'm glad. Relaxing comes in [[dok]], and how I relax at a given location varies. It's also not easy to define relaxation when triggering the diffuse mode is built into how I do my work. 

I often relax online. Saccharine enjoyment factor shows up in odd places for me. Lately, Tiktok videos, especially with my offspring, have been great for relaxation. I relax looking at the water flow in the creek, laying my head in my wife's lap, playing games with my offspring, etc. It's not easy to narrow down the conditions. Sometimes I'll relax when it's loud or quiet, intense or peaceful, with people or without. I wish I had a more rational explanation.

Lately, late at night, instead of pushing on [[monster]], I get out off my desk and lay down on the couch instead.
