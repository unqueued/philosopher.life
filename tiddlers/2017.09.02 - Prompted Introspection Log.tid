!! Why aren't you watching and playing League of Legends?

Well, I catch highlights on matches, but that's it. I'm just not interested. I feel like I have more important things to do with my time. I only have a few hours each evening, and my weekends are always packed. I think this is the natural course of things, and there is nothing wrong with it. It's good. I've found higher utility options. Good for me!
