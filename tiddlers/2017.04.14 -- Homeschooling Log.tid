title: 2017.04.14 -- Homeschooling Log

Like clockwork, we are revamping it. Inevitably, I fail (but, I won't give up). [[k0sh3k]] is completely in charge of accountability. All I do is plan, curate, talk, clarify, explain, and help. I'm revamping this homeschooling part of the wiki as well. It needs more structure. My job has nothing to do with making sure they are on task. I make suggestions. I give advice. 

Essentially, I'm smart enough to see what you don't understand, but I can't help you see it, believe it, want it, pursue it, be motivated by it, or any other virtue-theoretic approaching of "it."
