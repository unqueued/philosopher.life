<<<
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

Keeping silent authentically is possible only in genuine discoursing. To be able to keep silent, Dasein must have something to say—that is, it must have at its disposal an authentic and rich disclosedness of itself.

Sir【Kickscondor】the Stampeding<<ref "st">> Librarian Flowermaker is the first [[Human]] who took the time to extravagantly engage me in this wiki via [[hyperconversation]].<<ref "h">> I am blown away by it. It is blinding to me. I have had to remodel and rehabituate myself in virtue of our practice. I do not know his father,<<ref "f">> but his father's argument has passed through him to me: //conversation is a sacrament//.<<ref "s">> I hang on this man's words, and [[IA2DHJ|IA2DYJ]]. Excepting his librarian vocation, [[Kickscondor]] does not reveal himself or his opinion often;<<ref "p">> it is how he practices //The Robustness Principle// vein of [[T42T]] in the sacrament. Indeed, he is artful in [[The Great Human Conversation]].

I believe this nomad is searching the desert for the //imago dei// in [[Humanity]]. However expressively reserved, radically open, paranoically anti-dogmatic, and humbly hedged-conservative he may be, I must help him find the [[fire in the wilderness|salience]] he seeks. I do not know this man's religion:<<ref "rl">> he does not say. Even his silence is deafening. Sometimes he is the [[salience]] of [[silence|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silence_(novel)]] to me.<<ref "ss">> Sometimes even the negative space carves this wiki out; he helps me understand and see what I'm doing in this wiki like none [[other]].

Sometimes [[kickscondor]] appears to be a quiet brawling shadow;<<ref "sh">> he could be an unkindly dangerous opponent if he ever chose to be (and, ofc, he does not).<<ref "nf">> He appears to be my age or older than me, and he has the marks of a nomad who has wandered many parts of the desert. I do not know who he is, but if I'm forced to guess,<<ref "rec">> I estimate he is likely a recovering ex-Judeo-Christian-memeplex survivor turned Holy Jungian Daoist [[j3d1h]]acker [[Shadowmonk|Aquina the Shadowmonk]] Mystic.<<ref "d">> He is [[powerful]] to me in our dialectic. [[Kicks]] is a [[Straussian]], empathically tolerant, and persistently patient angel I have wrestled (not in vain) in the desert. It is [[my honor|h0p3]] to know him. May we always spiral in dialectic to synthetically integrate into an emerging, autonomous, self-modeling hermeneutical lens sufficient to perceive the //imago dei// in [[The Other]].<<ref "b">>

Finally, I am scared shitless to guess aloud what may be //The Event// which has mutilated my pseudonymous brother.<<ref "pr">> We both barely hold onto our sanity. I'm afraid I will fail to do him justice in the contradictory task of modeling his qualia for or to him.<<ref "q">> The miracles of meaning which may emerge from suffering may be ineffable. He is a reminder to me that I do not know what is possible all the way down, including my [[fff]] inability to [[name|Alias]] the [[unnameable]].

<<footnotes "f" "If you ever read these words: you are correct, Sir. With regret, I have realized that truth too late in life. In this respect, I am indebted to you for teaching your son this sacrament through sacrament with him. I seek [[The Other]] in your son. Your son listens to [[Humanity]], and I'm learning how to do so from him (however poor a student I may be).">>

<<footnotes "s" "It is rare that anyone so directly modifies and tests my {[[axioms]]}.">>

<<footnotes "p" "I am hesitant to say these words because [[I am still concerned|2018.09.10 - kickscondor: Qualia is Personal]], however unlikely it may be, that I open an old wound in my friend (I say it again in tears of the possibility that I am right about this world-ending thing to me: I am so sorry. I don't know how you live through the loss...and, I should never wish to cause you pain again about it). I cannot see what he does not show me, but I must make charitable and kind assumptions in my modeling. It is my opinion that this man knows how meaning emerges from suffering; that is a hardwon memeplex to have practiced.">>

<<footnotes "rl" "I hesitate to say this word. It may be a painful word to him! I know a man of faith when I see one though. He cannot hide that fact from me. Some form of spiritual belief bleeds out of his cloak.">>

<<footnotes "ss" "Make no mistake: I always prefer to hear his voice to his silence.">>

<<footnotes "sh" "To my shadowboxer. Or, do I have these backward? He must tell me who I am.">>

<<footnotes "nf" "I could not fathom this man as being evil even in profound disagreement. This man may be armed [he feigns much and never brandishes what he keeps inside his cloak], but he is never underhanded. That's not who he is. He is gentle, listens carefully, and plays [[T42T]] with dignity and skill I do not see often. May there be 10,000 like him in the desert!">>

<<footnotes "rec" "In modeling his self-model for him in [[T42T]] reciprocation.">>

<<footnotes "d" "Pay attention, daughter! Hospitably and humbly watch this nomad with me. Do you see yourself in him?">>

<<footnotes "b" "Or maybe he already sees it and he's just helping this blind fool see it too.">>

<<footnotes "pr" "I don't believe in prayer anymore (if I ever did?), but I desperately [[hope]] and quietly beg for the chance to pray that I am wrong in this thing. Honesty turns into my nightmare here.">>

<<footnotes "q" "Shamefully, I cannot offer him nearly as effective a gift of empathy as he offers me.">>
