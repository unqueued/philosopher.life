* Looked into P2P Tiddlywiki
** https://dat-tiddlywiki.glitch.me/
** Neat.
* Legit appreciates the open web.
* SoC, modding/hackerspace/indie/tinker, IoT-esque, low-cost + low-power systems, embedding technology into our lives
* Quit computer programming to teach public elementary school during the summer of 2015...antidote to the self-loathing and looming pointlessness that felt as a programmer
** This person has experienced significant loss before.
** Had a pragmatic, real-world response to the "Rationalist" effective altruist which I appreciated.
** Worried about morality and the human condition; not the stereotypical STEM. Clearly, this person realizes that learning is for the sake of making better humans, not merely to get a job.
** This person cares about their life's purpose.
