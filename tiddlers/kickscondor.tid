** Had a pragmatic, real-world response to the "Rationalist" effective altruist which I appreciated.
** Worried about morality and the human condition; not the stereotypical STEM. Clearly, this person realizes that learning is for the sake of making better humans, not merely to get a job.
** This person has experienced significant loss before.
** This person cares about their life's purpose.
