*** I hate that he is more competent than I had hoped.

* Think About It
** https://believermag.com/under-the-weather/
*** I have mixed feelings about it. [[Redpilled Stoicism]] has a serious moral problem in it. It is too much for one person to hold. 
** https://www.wired.com/story/mind-games-the-tortured-lives-of-targeted-individuals/
*** I wonder how many stepping stones this is away from where I'm standing. Some consider me already there.
** https://summation.net/2019/09/05/first-principles-about-when-to-use-first-principles/
*** Ignore the pictures. Be a realist and idealist.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/opinion/sunday/the-age-of-american-despair.html
*** I feel like I have no one to speak with. The [[Straussian]]s were Neo-Aristotelian Egoists and Neocons, the Neo-Kantians & Rawlsian were Libs, the Marxists never studied Plato enough, and most were just Libertarians of some variety. None of them cared enough about computers to be metamodern either. I can usually find some intersection, but never enough.

*** I think CA/SA will be hit ridiculously hard in the coming months too.
** https://www.wired.com/story/empathy-is-tearing-us-apart/
*** Just wait until you realize that psychopathy comes in degrees and is far more prevalent than most people are willing to recognize. Outgrouping is necessary, and empathy [[irwartfrr]] will still lead to violence in many cases.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/style/cancel-culture.html
*** If you don't have beliefs you are willing to die for, you're a bad person.

* Fishy

*** Solving this does not solve the fundamental exploitation problem. It only masks it. That's the point here though.

*** Yikes. It's a popular point of view. Begging the question gorgeously, ofc.
** https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rising-threat-of-digital-nationalism-11572620577?mod=rsswn
*** No, Fuck That! It is NOT inevitable. The space of possibility is much more expansive.

*** They wouldn't lie, would they?
** https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/
*** Lmao. Totally above it. More grey tribe and finding ourselves without actually recognizing what it means to pursue what is outside ourselves with integrity. Convenient.
