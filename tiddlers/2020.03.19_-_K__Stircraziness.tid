[11:57 AM] h0p3: How's it going?
[11:58 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Hey! There are three of us in the office today so that’s fun. No supervisors means I can slack off all I want haha
[12:15 PM] h0p3: Fuck yeah! :slight_smile: Enjoy, sir.
[12:16 PM] Ardent_Assailant: What are you up to?
[12:16 PM] h0p3: Just grinding along in the house with everyone today. It feels like an office in here too.
[12:16 PM] h0p3: I need to watch The Office again with my offspring.
[12:17 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Oh yeah... we still have a season to go on that too
[12:17 PM] h0p3: Enjoying our time together. We've never actually had so much time with all 4 of us, even though we are busy doing our own things to some degree.
[12:18 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It sounds amazing. :slight_smile:
[12:18 PM] Ardent_Assailant: What kind of opportunities has it allowed for you all?
[12:20 PM] h0p3: Offspring get to see their mom at work. It is a very useful model for them.
[12:20 PM] h0p3: We get to make decisions or have conversations which require all four of us more often or in shorter windows.
[12:22 PM] h0p3: My wife has more chances to interact with and educate our offspring. It's hard to describe what it is because parts of it don't feel very linear. I think there's a kind of emergent value to it which isn't easy to predict.
[12:23 PM] h0p3: Way more family time has been outstanding, useful, and intense.
[12:24 PM] h0p3: Our schedules are gelling together more.
[12:24 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yeah. Hopefully nobody is super stir crazy. I’m worried about how it’s all going to affect [[L]] in the long run because she hates being at home so much.
[12:24 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’m happy for you all though. :slight_smile: it sounds wonderful.
[12:24 PM] h0p3: Will taking walks help?
[12:25 PM] h0p3: Stircrazyiness is something I don't understand well enough. You know me. I adore being in my home.
[12:28 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Me too lmao
[12:29 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Perhaps. I’ll offer that suggestion to her if it comes up
