title: 2020.02.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Boomers Booming Me In The Ass Again

* Woke at the mothafuckin' crack of 10
** My brain is on fire. Ugh. You. Stupid. Brain.
** Also, it's cold AF in my house. Who knew?
* Meditation
** Fast-paced. Manic me.
* Fireman Time!
* Who the fuck has time for [[Fitness Routine]]?
** My brother apparently, lol. Good for him.
*** I think it's funny that he's feeling guilty not working today. Capitalist conditioning. 
* My offspring were surprisingly kinda on task. 
** I don't know how, and I'm afraid to ask questions. Like a baseball game, you just keep holding your right arm at a 90 degree angle and hop on one foot until the end of the game to maintain that mojo. Don't question the voodoo.
* Dialectures
* Reasoned with the man who did my emissions test until he started searching his database more effectively. Yes, I know I was there, and no, you didn't record my data correctly.
** Yay. Have this piece of paper.
* DMV
** Eric the Boomer, who knows me by name now, apologized yet again and told me I have the patience of Job. `/giggle`
** It felt dirty to do, but I organized and pruned apps on my phone.
*** I've decided to just start blocking anyone not in my contacts list. I feel like a bad citizen.
*** I'm going to puke right now. Despite what my brain tells me, I know it's not a real computer. I hates it.
*** Perhaps I should catalog the apps on the wiki. 
** I'm getting good at shooting-the-shit with DMV employees.
*** I am too fascinated by how people type with ultra-long fingernails. 
** SUV is registered. 
** As my wife pointed out to me, I failed to get IDs for my offspring. Fuck.
*** Do they really, really, really, really neeeed them tho? I've been to the DMV so many fucking times. Please don't make me go.
* Sorrento's
** Yeah, solid. Expensive.
* Mailed off my bruhvnuh's noif.
** Two guys talked with me about my knife for a while. Felt good ol'boys up in there.
* Power-steering for the SUV fixed, gas, etc.
* Produce shopping
** Forgot bags. Offspring got those.
* Re-arranged my tool-shop area in the garage for my wife.
** I'm sad. Parking will be better all around though. 
* Fireman Time!
* Snuggles->Nap
* Lentil Soup
** We're going too heavy on the salt. Also, ironically from [[Audit]], missing my lemon juice.
* //Battlestar Galactica//
* Chats
* Daughter's toe is purple. Everything else is normal.
** I am not a doctor. I am barely a dad. 
* Read+write
* Sleep by 4?
