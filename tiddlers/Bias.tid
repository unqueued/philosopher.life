title: Bias

//Figure out how to stop foolin' urself. It's so easy, bro. Just, like, prefer to believe or desire, for a bit, what you usually prefer to be false and unworthy. That's why I stopped sucking so much horse cock.//

<<<
When the learned take neither revelation nor reason for their guide, they fall into as great, and worse errors, than the unlearned; for they only make use of that system of Divine wisdom, which should guide them into truth, when they can find or pick out any thing that will suit their purpose, or that they can pervert to such—the very means of leading themselves and others into error.

-- Ottobah Cugoano, //Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slaver//

Lying to ourselves is more deeply ingrained than lying to others.

Labels bias our perceptions, thinking, and behavior. A label or story can either separate us from, or connect us to, nature. For our health and happiness, we must critically evaluate our labels and stories by their effects.

Men judge things according to the disposition of their minds, and had rather imagine things than understand them.

When a man finds a conclusion agreeable, he accepts it without argument, but when he finds it disagreeable, he will bring against it all the forces of logic and reason.

Bias and prejudice are attitudes to be kept in hand, not attitudes to be avoided.

* [[Virtue is Knowledge]]
** Virtue is a bias. Knowledge is a bias. It is discriminating, distinguishing, and judgmental.
** [[irwartfrr]]ness and [[irwrongfrr]]ness are biases.
** Even the Daoist is pointing to the need for bias given the particulars of the world.
** It's difficult not to believe what we think (or impossible in some respects).
** Mistakes have to be a normal part of functioning Bayesian/empirical approaches to making inferences or shaping our perceptions and personalities.

* Bias helps us address information overload, lack of meaning, the need to act fast, and how to know what needs to be remembered for later.
** Information Overload: we aggressively filter so that noise becomes signal. Unfortunately, we don’t see everything, and some of the information we filter out is actually useful and important.
*** We notice things that are already primed in memory or repeated often. This is the simple rule that our brains are more likely to notice things that are related to stuff that’s recently been loaded in memory.
*** Syncopated, bizarre, and surprising things stick out more. Ordinary or predicted information is often skipped or filtered out.
*** We’ll generally tend to weigh the significance of the new value by the direction the change happened (positive or negative) more than re-evaluating the new value as if it had been presented alone.
*** We're drawn to details with confirm our beliefs, feelings, and desires; we tend to ignore details that disconfirm.
** Lacking Meaning: we fill in gaps with confabulated stories. Unfortunately, we live with delusions.
*** We find stories and patterns even in sparse data, seeking to reconstruct the luxury of a complete and certain feeling world.
*** We fill in characteristics from stereotypes, generalities, and prior histories whenever there are new specific instances or gaps in information.
*** We imagine things and people we’re familiar with or fond of as better than things and people we aren’t familiar with or fond of. 
*** We simplify probabilities and numbers to make them easier to think about.
*** We project our mental states onto other minds, stories, and events.
** Need to Act Fast: we jump to conclusions because we feel we need a decision now. Unfortunately, some of the quick reactions and decisions we jump to are unfair, self-serving, and counter-productive.
*** We need to be confident in our ability to make an impact and to feel like what we do is important.
*** In order to stay focused, we favor the immediate, relatable thing in front of us over the delayed and distant.
*** We’re motivated to complete things that we’ve already invested time and energy in.
*** We’re motivated to preserve our autonomy and status in a group, and to avoid irreversible decisions. 
*** We favor options that appear simple or that have more complete information over more complex, ambiguous options.
** Remembering What Is [[Salient]]: it is constitutive of [[fff]] consciousness that we reshape our models with what appears to matter most.
*** We edit and reinforce some memories after the fact.
*** We discard specifics to form generalities.
*** We reduce events and lists to their key elements. 
*** We store memories differently based on how they were experienced.

* Implicit Bias
** Acting on the basis of prejudice and stereotypes without intending to do so.
*** Is it conceptually discriminatory in an unjustified manner?
** Systems 1 and 2
*** Automated activations and control of attitudes
** Priming Methodological Assumption
*** People respond more quickly to concepts closely linked together in memory, and most subjects in the sequential priming task are quicker to respond to words given exposure to previous words.
**** There's something right about this. We are prediction machines in no small part.
*** Subjects’ automatic responses were thought to be “uncontaminated” by controlled or strategic responses.
**** Hrm. Think of the reflex game for catching falling objects. You can learn to prime your body to catch on the hair trigger.
**** It might not be clean enough, but there's something here to consider.
** Implicit attitudes: introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action toward social objects. 
** Implicit measures are instruments that assess people’s thoughts, feelings, behavior, evaluations, and categorization judgments quasi-indirectly by limiting the subject's awareness of what is being studied to minimize the chance to introspect and respond strategically.
** Quad Model of Processes that Contribute to Responses
***  (1) the automatic activation of an association; (2) the subject’s ability to determine a correct response (i.e., a response that reflects one’s subjective assessment of truth); (3) the ability to override automatic associations; and (4) general response biases (e.g., favoring right-handed responses)

* Tactics
** Steelmanning your opposition. Write out your position's apostacy.
** It's hard to stand outside yourself, but you can attempt to stand outside the object for better lighting.
