title: 2018.12.23 - Afterschool Teaching: 24

Added more to [[Afterschool Teaching: Math]], namely fleshed out 24. I was going to just wander by hand, but this makes it easier. [[AA]] helped me with this (thank you!), and I OCRed her image. She suggested money and dice games.

I've added some fun concepts to teach them. I really want them to understand some of the beauty of mathematics. I should dig more. I feel like I have the 10 thousand things on my plate.
