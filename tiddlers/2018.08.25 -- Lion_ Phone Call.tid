title: 2018.08.25 -- Lion: Phone Call

He advertises his number. I called him up. No answer. I hope it wasn't too late in the evening for him. E-mail it is:

Hi Lion,

I stumbled across your book today, and I was blown away by it. I'm so taken by your work that I couldn't help myself; I just called you a few minutes ago. I'd like to get to know you.

You can get to know me here: https://philosopher.life/. I'll be thinking about you and your work out loud there.

I have no idea how or if you desire to proceed. In any case, it's a pleasure to meet you.

Sincerely,

h0p3

Saw the text request only after I called/emailed. Shit.
