title: 2018.08.10 -- BAGD: Signify

The wiki as self-representation is a signifier that we don't know what we don't know in a profound way.

I want to avoid you ever finding yourself lost at sea without having had practice building a Neurathian boat.

The wiki is an existential tool designed to help you flexibly navigate what might otherwise appear to be the uncharted or even unnavigatable.

Grow your vines of knowledge here.

I am to use this as a tutorial method, a Socratic technodialectic.

Relating the [[Root]] project is perhaps what much of our life boils down to.
