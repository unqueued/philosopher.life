**** Long have I argued with other philosophers that being ethical is not some small set of large decisions over the course of our lives (although, those matter too), but that every moment and choice is laced with ethical implications and content. Choice is ethical, always, at every moment. Yes, the postmodern problematics arise. We must live with those demons and shadows.

*** Shitty LPT, but the point is still important. If I worked in an office, I would want automated backups of my data that I, and only I, control and know about. I can think of a few rituals to do this, but that is extra work. Perhaps it is a "once a week" and when I feel the need. You can script/manually backup stuff onto the computer's drives and make it look innocuous enough. Switch the machine off, boot-up with a separate encrypted drive, automated scripts to take them and boot down. EZ-Peasy, right?

*** "The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it."
