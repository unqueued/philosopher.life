title: 2017.02.26 -- Realpolitik Speculation: The DNC: Republicans in Democratic Clothing

Two-party systems are known to be game-theoretically flawed in crucial ways. Third parties really can't really exist. It is A/B testing, but in our case, the entire game is bought by corporate funds and elite interests. The DNC has a duty to represent the Leftist side (progressive and liberal are meaningless words), but they don't and won't. 

Perez just got elected DNC chairman. He's a corporate shill, an establishment status quo fellow. He forced the defeat of Sanders. He's in the Obama/Clinton right-center camp, not the Sander/Warren left-center camp. It's the wrong direction. This is the RNC all over again. They have been hollowed out by and large by the Hyperclass (if they weren't always that way).

The DNC is about as culpable for the reign of capitalism as the RNC as far as I can tell. They really do defend the status quo. It is a well-known DNC tactic that when a social movement begins to take-off, the DNC courts them with a "progressive" message, attach themselves to the movement, inject themselves into the power structures of the movement, take it over from the inside, and purge the radical elements that pose significant threats to the status quo. The DNC swallows leftist movements and neutralizes them.

They subvert and subdue lower class progress (which, at this point, is just having a seat at the proverbial table) to maintain the capitalist system. They are extensions of corporate power. Both parties are just the "right" and "left" political arms of capitalism (but in reality, they are both right-wing to differing degrees).

It's passed the problem of them "not learning their lesson." They clearly have aimed for this. The Democrats are as much the enemies of the people as the Republicans. No one actually represents the people. Our true masters are emerging.
