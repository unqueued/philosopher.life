title: 2018.09.05 -- Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

The encounters between HP and Dumbledore tend to be some of the most important to me. I can feel myself there.

I do not understand why they are using polyjuice potions and all this effort for weak outcomes. Why not go for broke?

Why does it take weeks for Hermione? 

I've decided that I'm kind of looking for a Horcrux like that diary in this wiki! I think this diary sounds amazing. I'm very glad to read this book again just to inspect this horcrux (a word I often use to describe my wiki). 

It's interesting how much Everquest, Diablo 2, and Tolkien informed my images of this series. Somehow, the basilisk just felt cartoonish to me.

The Chamber itself is odd. 

The "purity" of HP being so powerful really doesn't play out, or when it does, it feels forced in these stories. I suppose it's to help average people feel above average.

God damn ex machina bullshit.

Love to hate the Malfoys.
