It's a non-trivial sleight of hand to peel apart. It's obviously ridiculous to criticize someone over something which they have no power. You don't get a choice in your genes (well, at least not the ones you are born with; biotech may change even this). You also have no choice in other morally arbitrary characteristics, such as where you are born, to whom, in what context, etc. Further, conditioning isn't up to you. Insofar as it wasn't up to you, you aren't morally responsible for you who are.

We might point out that one plant specimen is flourishing more than another (perhaps one was born in the shade without a good source of water, while the other was born into perfect eudaimonic conditions). Again, however, this is moral luck (at best, we can say something is "bad," in this metaethical sphere, but not "wrong"). My goal is to criticize those attributes for which one is responsible.

As a person, I am reducible to my beliefs, desires, emotions, and behaviors. Further, it appears cultures are similarly reducible to memeplexes and behavioral expressions of those memeplexes.

I don't want to let racists off the hook for their racist beliefs. There is something wrong with choosing to be racist, with having a racist identity, for participating in racist culture. Insofar as they are merely conditioned, I must say they aren't responsible. I can only say it's a bad thing they hold and act upon those memeplexes, particularly since it isn't up to them. Insofar as they are free to define themselves, to shape their identities, to condition themselves (I make no claims to explaining what counts as freewill here), they are responsible, and I'm correct to criticize them.

Insofar as persons choose to be racists, I am a culturalist against racist memeplexes and behaviors. Given the same caveat, I'm culturalist against the Randian Memeplex; Randians form a culture. Capitalism is reducible to cultures of memeplexes and behaviors as well. Socialism is also a culture. Some cultures, some memeplexes and behaviors, are better than some others (existential quantifiers on both ends), and insofar as we are free to choose them, some are more right than some others.

Thus, socialist thought is culturalist, but it aims to do so in the right way, at the right times, for the right reasons, and so on. The dialectic is a cultural one; material conditions are largely the result of cultural wars. I am not ashamed to participate in counterculture.
