title: 2019.06.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Law of Nature

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Remember, every business firm, like even a mom and pop grocery store, is a market imperfection. A firm is defined in economic theory as a market imperfection introduced to deal with transaction costs. And the sort of theory is that the imperfections, the firms, are kinda like little islands in a free market sea. But the problem with that is that the sea doesn't remotely resemble a free market, and the islands are bigger than the sea; so that raises some questions about the picture. But these market imperfections, like a firm, or a transnational corporation, or a strategic alliance among them, this is a form of administering interchanges. And there's a real question about whether we want to accept that. Why, for example, should the international socioeconomic system, or for that matter our own society, be in the hands of unaccountable private tyrannies? That's a decision, it's not a law of nature.

[[Saint Chomsky]] appears to be talking about the non-existence of overidealized concepts of the free market, mere vacuum theories, frictionless spherical chickens in econophysics, and perfect reductions (you know: Economics!). Market imperfections become centralized power in broad social contexts. I agree that it isn't a law of nature (whatever that word means) like the speed of light constant (and even these laws may be contingent truths). I prefer to think that the state of nature and capitalism are strongly related though, and those who can (or believe they can) exploit this description of the probabilities of our causation aim to prescribe it as the only possibility. The soundbite meme which I see "capitalism is human nature," which is just another way of saying we should both completely describe and prescribe social systems based upon the assumption of absolute psychological egoism. I agree that the vast majority of homo sapiens are immorally egoistic, but not all, and more importantly, it's up to us to some non-trivial [[dok]] whether or not we are going to be egoistic. Discussions of freewill, metaethics, and metaphysics are dismissed (and surprisingly, even the [[pleft]] does this as well). I agree with the conclusion: capitulating to capitalism is a decision.
