Have a great day today!
THU 8:44 AM
That is a fascinating book choice. Is it for a class?
THU 9:58 AM
I hope it’ll teach me more about the author! Because my thesis is that a Taoist perspective is crucial to understanding her collection of poetry (a different book).
THU 9:59 AM
And if it directly talks about Taoism (which I think it will) then even better.
THU 10:00 AM
I have no idea. Her site is bare. She's a hypnotherapist.
THU 10:01 AM
I also think that’s super cool. I might be able to link hypnosis into meditation.
THU 10:03 AM
Maybe. Lmao
THU 10:03 AM
The paper has been revised!
THU 10:01 PM
That is a stronger point of view. Good!
THU 10:13 PM
I cannot say it is clearly Marxist (though it may be), but I will say it is anarchist and opposed to capitalism. I think of Marxism as fundamentally concerned with the workers owning the means of production.
THU 10:14 PM
Your thoughts were beneficial to tie it all together.
THU 10:15 PM
I may have just wanted to say “Marxist”. :joy:
THU 10:15 PM
It's an important question raised by the movie.
THU 10:15 PM
My professor mentioned in class today that Frederic Johnson, the guy I quoted twice, wrote his essay from a Marxist perspective but I’m still unraveling that sentiment
THU 10:16 PM
What’s ZZ?
THU 10:18 PM
A keyboard error, lol
THU 10:18 PM
Lmao
THU 10:19 PM
I should try to reconcile the Marxist comment before turning in.
THU 10:19 PM
Any other things stick it to you?
THU 10:19 PM
Out***
THU 10:19 PM
Criticizing consumerism is not the same thing as criticizing capitalism.
THU 10:20 PM
I don't know if it is a massive plot to exhibit their influence. Was it a display of power, or something else?
THU 10:21 PM
I wish you had 20 pages (sorry, I'm repeating myself)
THU 10:22 PM
Hehehe
THU 10:22 PM
So much to compress here
THU 10:22 PM
I should just remove the traces of capitalism.
THU 10:22 PM
Consumerism is the more important part anyway.
THU 10:22 PM
Filling in the existential holes with material consumption.
THU 10:23 PM
Your thesis is that //Fight Club// is actually postmodern, and that stands out much clearer (I strongly disagree with the claim, but you have done a much better job of supporting it).
THU 10:25 PM
"cannot be certain that the events of the movie hold the purpose of expressing a universal truth." is too weak a claim. Many people think we can only ever have confidence (probabilistic inferences) in our metanarratives and realism. You might consider punching harder there.
THU 10:26 PM
I would argue there is a difference between having irreverence for Grand Metanarratives about metaphysics+metaethics+objective_truth and irreverence for maintaining a narrative in the story or even maintaining the audiences ability to feel comfortable as an audience.
THU 10:28 PM
The irreverence shown in the film is the latter quite clearly, but the former not so obviously.
THU 10:28 PM
How so? Could you tell me more?
THU 10:30 PM
The flippant manner in which the fourth wall is broken is a rhetorical device, it tells you this film isn't like others, it doesn't care about mere social conventions of how narratives in blockbuster films normally go (algorithmically designed just to make money and reach the lowest common denominators for consumption). Being willing to break social conventions is not denying moral law or truth.
THU 10:35 PM
The film is toxic to a particular form of narrative/movie consumption. It has a point to make in the very rhetorical device it ironically wields.
THU 10:36 PM
It's punk.
THU 10:36 PM
Countercultural.
THU 10:36 PM
(and ironically commodified itself, no doubt)
THU 10:37 PM
It's a realpolitik story. It's a direct political device for waking people up. It's a telic story. It has a goal, a reason, a truth it's trying to get people to see.
THU 10:39 PM
And, it will break rules and ironically make fun of itself to get you there.
THU 10:39 PM
Yeah. It does have that metanarrative. :joy:
THU 10:39 PM
It's not countercultural in the sense that no culture has meaning at all, relativized into oblivion. It's countercultural in the sense that it is fighting for something real. I think it begs the question of meaning, objective truth...even if it is only in confirming that we must wrestle with ourselves and others (sometimes quite violently) to pursue the truth, purpose, and who we are.
THU 10:41 PM
That he makes an army to do this absurd thing is hyperbolic or perhaps just an incoherent attempt at fruitful anarchic approaches to fighting back.
THU 10:42 PM
I think the army is almost an after thought. I think the men actually fighting amongst themselves is the core of who they are. It reminds me of Jacob, it reminds me of Plato.
THU 10:43 PM
There is dialectic in there.
THU 10:43 PM
We're forced to ask ourselves: "What are we fighting for?"
THU 10:43 PM
I love that we are gently* fighting about the meaning and purpose of this film.
THU 10:45 PM
I don’t really swing one way or the other. Lol. I still don’t think it’s a postmodern movie. XD But it is evident that we feel different on some of the aspects and that’s okay!
THU 11:19 PM
I’ll likely pull your thought up tomorrow when I put the finishing touches on, think long and hard about them, and integrate them where I feel necessary. :)
THU 11:20 PM
It’s what I did for yesterday’s notes too.
THU 11:20 PM
In [[L]]’s words, there’s some [[h0p3]] in my writing. :D
THU 11:20 PM
XD
THU 11:22 PM
Aye. There's some of both you in my writing (literally, your words and empathically too).
THU 11:23 PM
Telling the stories of our lives together.
