title: 2017.04.22 -- Computer Musings: Cloud Garden Ports

All too often, I am not a smart man. For the life of me, I've been trying to understand why the new Macbooks are dropping their ports. I can't think of a good reason for it. It seems like an obvious step backwards to me.

Clearly, they intend they want to push as much computation into the software/cloud side of things as they can. This is just another attempt to tighten the noose around those in their walled garden.
