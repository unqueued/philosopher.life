title: 2019.06.13 - Prompted Introspection: Non-Existence of TV

!! If TV didn't exist, what would you do with your time?

I could not define who I would be or what the world would be like (I strongly doubt I would exist either). Only in the past 2 decades has the internet overtaken it as the most influential medium, and even then, video (which is perhaps not TV) might still be a leading memetic force for large swathes of the population. We live in what I take to be a Golden Age or Renaissance of TV Shows transmitted over the net. There's never been storytelling like this before. 

I have no idea how to hypotheticalize a contemporary world without TV. It's like asking me what would happen if we never discovered computing, or electricity, or plastic. I can't delve into reasonably justified counterexamples here because I can't flesh out the tidal waves of contingent truths which would have to obtain in those possible worlds.

I don't think this is the question you meant to ask.
