title: Fuglee Joe

* Abilities
** Wallflower -  Innate/Conditional:  If he doesn't hum, talk, or directly interact with a person, people will fail to notice him or his actions. 
***While he doesn't have the most interesting personality, his lackluster presence doesn't account for the strength of this ability.  This effect can extend to items that he grabs while a wallflower, as long as a person isn't intently focusing on the item when he first moves it.  
***In combat, he cannot become a wallflower after being noticed, unless flash is used.
*** While he is a wallflower, friend and foe alike does not know where he is, making friendly fire a possibility and friendly heals/buffs  impossible unless the beneficial spells are AoE.

**Stab - At-Will: Uses two piercing weapons proficiently.  Can do double damage while behind a target.

**Apply Poison - Conditional: Apply poison to the edge of a piercing weapon in his possession.  Poisons last for 2 hits before fading.  Poisons damage weapons if left on the blade outside combat, so the ability can only be used before an ambush or during combat.

**Flash - Conditional:  Throw a vial of flash serum, creating a blinding light.  Instantly enter the wallflower state for all entities in the encounter.  Due to the serum being highly reactive, only one serum can be carried at a time, and they can only be created outside of combat encounters.

**Obfuscate - Daily:  Extend the wallflower ability to an enemy.  Targeted enemy can no longer be perceived by his allies, regardless of any attempts made to get their attention.  There is a small chance that the targeted enemy will be completely phased out of existence.



* Appearance
**Average height human, with gray eyes and slightly gray skin. Face is so unremarkable, often friends fail to recognize him until he talks.
**Plain leather armor with no unique or noteworthy markings.
**Forearms are covered in red tattoos, all of which emit a slight glow.


* Items
** Non-Magical Items
*** Acid Poison - when applied to dagger, allows the weapon to cut through armor with ease.
*** Fire Poison - when applied to dagger, the dagger will become extremely hot, increasing weapon damage against light armor and possibly setting targets on fire.
*** Flash serum Kit - can be used outside of combat to create a flash serum vial.
*** Daggers
***Small Canvas portraits-- small piece of canvas on which three people have been painted.  One of the paintings resembles Fuglee, while the other two is a woman and a young girl.
** Magical Item
*** Ring of Magical Awareness-- wearing this ring makes Fuglee aware of the presence of all nearby magical items, up to 20 feet away.  If Fuglee places his hand against a magical item for longer than a minute, he can get a general sense of what the magical item is capable of doing.


* Weaknesses
** Fade - If Fuglee stays in the wallflower state for more than an hour, he starts to fade from existence.  While he will never fully disappear, he is weak when faded (-1 to saving throws)
** What a bore - Fuglee's personality and lack of charisma makes it difficult to make relationships and to get good prices while bartering.  People are often confused when they first notice him and so he makes a bad first impression.
