The story is silly. It's a forced narrative with a clear purpose. 

I have some bits of disgreement, but I'm pleased with this by and large. There are, however, some revisions of history, not fitting interpretations, etc. I think the author has whitewashed these philosophers and artificially streamlined The Narrative. But, I can forgive this. So far, I do want my children to go through this book.
