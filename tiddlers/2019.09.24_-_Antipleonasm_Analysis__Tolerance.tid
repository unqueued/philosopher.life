title: 2019.09.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Tolerance

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The liberal idea of tolerance is more and more a kind of intolerance. What it means is 'Leave me alone; don't harass me; I'm intolerant towards your over-proximity.'
<<<

It's an underhanded rhetorical tactic I see wielded all the time. It's self-deceptive too. Radical honesty over tolerance is still going to teach you to be careful with your words (again and again). The leftists who have changed my mind the most over the years have been intolerant and kindly violent in the dialectic with me. I am forever in debt to those who lovingly (though not always nicely) look me in the eyes and tell me: that part of you is evil. It's important to be dismissed at times. It's such an insanely expensive thing to do on both ends.<<ref "c">> 

Tolerance is often a weasel word for relativism. I'll take you down the rabbithole of vagueness and internalism all you want, and I know it's easy to drown in it. I am anathema, the dogmatic blight, the sour cynic, and the absolute asshole. We do not have a prima facie right to just be whoever we want to be. The paradox of tolerance requires putting down our tentpegs, putting our money where our mouth is, putting our necks on the line, and habituating justified Aristotelian Magnanimity. 

Sometimes you get this right. You understand the violence and dialectically obligated hatred which emerges with [[love]] to some extent. You have argued that we ought to make commitments in public, and it appears the more expertise one has, the more you expect (though you don't predict) they ought to pick out the dogmatically detailed [[salience]] to extrema (because that's exactly what virtue is about). I know a wrestler when I see one. 

Intolerance is a [[phenomenological]], epistemic, and thus moral filter for picking out what is [[salient]], enabling one's ray(s) of intentionality of some varying scope, resolution, and so forth. I don't blame the tolerant for being intolerant except insofar as they are hypocritical, unjustifiably deceptive, conveniently anti-realist, promoting relativism, egoistically failing to meet their obligations to wrestle with others, and failing to play fair in justice as fairness.
