In the civilized parts of our world today, we normally don’t settle disputes with fists or yelling anymore. We pretend that everybody is reasonable, and therefore resort to reason, at least on the surface...The key here is the association with “winning.” In human social interaction, winning is rarely about the facts or the truth. It is usually about ending an interaction in a preferred status relationship.
<<<

Lol. Yeah. Rhetoric, manipulation, and status are the basis of who we really are.

Using the petard method of using someone's argument against them requires them to be hypocritical to disagree, to inspect the flaws in themselves and their own reasoning, to lack integrity, etc. 

<<<
To function as a human being, you are forced to accept a minimum level of deception in your life. The more complex and challenging your life, the higher this minimum.
<<<

Ah, I'm fucked.

Hierarchy of Deception (ranked from least sophisticated to most):

* outright lying and fabrication of evidence.
* misdirection. You don’t lie, but you foreground a pattern of true information that is likely to lead to false conclusions.
* withholding of information. You don’t lie or misdirect, but you don’t necessarily share any information that you don’t have to.
* equivocation, or sharing of information in ambiguous ways. This allows you to maintain plausible deniability against charges of lying, misdirection or withholding information, and relies on the predisposition of the other party to draw certain conclusions over others.
* you get not-correcting-others. You don’t lie, misdirect, withhold or equivocate. But when others are drawing false conclusions that you could correct if you chose to (or missing inferences that are obvious to you due to your greater skill), you selectively choose not to help them out.

<<<
When you get good at not-correcting-others in helpful ways, you become a good teacher.
<<<

Okay. Fair point. Good teaching is about manipulation in the right way.

<<<
How much of your advantage should you give away when you are morally unsure about your position? I assert that you should give away the advantage in direct proportion to the amount of doubt you feel.
<<<

See. Rao's now perfectly evil. There is some deep sanity to that claim.

Rao implores us to beware those who preach "“You must be willing to look foolish" -> "You must accept the consequences” -> "take one for the team", especially when it benefits them.

<<<
You should certainly accept that failure is imminent the moment the signs are clear. When the writing’s on the wall, it is time to quit fighting for success.
<<<

Ah. I feel this way about society in general.

<<<
It is time to rapidly shift into damage control mode. There are no holy judges out there watching to see if karmic justice is done, and waiting to applaud your noble actions. Only gleeful onlookers enjoying their moment of schadenfreude, other evil and slightly evil people furiously looking for an opportunity in your fall, and well-intentioned compassionate souls eager to commiserate and tempt you into passivity when you need to be active.
<<<

Preach, yo!

<<<
As a principal in a risky endeavor, unless you are prone to denial, you’ll realize that failure is unavoidable long before others do. This means you have the most time and control over consequences, which includes a degree of control over how, where and when others find out what’s happening, and how they react.
<<<

Ah, I'm trying to think about what possible courses of action are available to me. I think this is a global catastrophe. I can't see that far ahead. I also don't know which fork we are heading down. It's dystopia, yes, but one is far more savage than the other. 

<<<
Damage control means predicting the unmanaged course of events, designing interventions to minimize fallout, and optimally distributing the residual impact among all exposed parties. This means trading off impact on trust, credibility, and future opportunities. It means salvaging material assets. And yes: it means deciding how foolish you can afford to look.
<<<

He's worried about something I am not here, obviously. I'm not taking his advice in his context. This, of course, is excellent advice.

<<<
When a true failure looms, you must play or be played.
<<<

Zero sum.

<<<
When two parties have divergent agendas, the party that controls data flows is usually the one that wins.
<<<

The memes, yo. This is almost obvious. He's tricky, no doubt.

Rebooting conversations: 

* you repeat all or part of their opening line, but with zero emotional content. Deadpan. Sometimes asserted as a question.
** prevents emotional hijacking

Hallway Chicken (the little hacks):

<<<
The key to giving way graciously, as it happens, is to slow your movements down to below the walking tempo of the oncomer. This is a status win because slow movements are associated with higher status.
<<<

Doorway Holding

Uh, yes. He has distilled it so nicely.

Holy fuck, his section on Interruptions gets it too! These are the micro rules for social transactions. I do my best not to use them maliciously when I understand them (although, I also don't understand many because I'm autistic).

...

Meh. The rest of the book goes down the wrong path.
