Postmodernism, as an idea I respect (as the non-trivial and understandable problem in the world), in dialectic with the [material manifestations, outputs, and causes of our subjective ideas is one which our lives] explains and is explained by fundamentally fragmented identities, containing all the errors of object-oriented reasoning, and asynchronous interactions with ourselves, the world, & others. All of the laws of networking and CS apply to the physical aspects of reality (excepting our epistemology more generally). I've said nothing new. 

Writing's natural compression, multi-threaded asynchronicity, reusability, expressiveness, and epic libraries for computing about it makes it the most important communications tool available to me. Writing, especially long-form or long-term writing (pick your tradeoffs), is the platform I want to use with those I care about the most, and I think it's the basis upon which society (even through heavily virtualized mediums) should be [[deconstructed and reconstructed]].
