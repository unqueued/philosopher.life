title: 2020.01.18 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Effective Lying

!! Respond to the following gem:

: A liar should have a good memory.

That's a hypothetical imperative if I ever saw one. Should given what end? Obviously, there are cases in which one can lie successfully where memory (particularly long-term) is borderline irrelevant to achieving the goal. 

I think some of the most crucial lies which people tell themselves are something they aim not to have much memory about. The goal is to not think about it, to have false dead-ends, to push it outside of conscious experience as much as possible. 

Failing to tell the truth, even as deception through omission, feels very much this to me as well. Figuring out the routes back to the truth that also have to be concealed is often no small task, especially long-term. There's a way in which even politeness will force us to construct alienated models with each other. 

Yes, however, an effective liar should often have a good memory.
