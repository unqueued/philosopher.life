!! What kind of TV commercial would you like to make? Describe it.

I'm generally speaking opposed to advertisement, commercials, rhetoric, deception, manipulation, and brainwashing. I also assume this question means more than mere T.V.; I don't have a subscription (I dropped mine 10 years ago, before it was cool). Let us say a short video that large swathes of people have to watch, whether online, on their boobtube, or otherwise. That seems far more applicable, and I think it matches the spirit of this outdated question (What is a cassette tape? amiright?).

I have another question, does it have to be something which advertises? Or, can I just drop truth-bombs? What must I say? Can it be just any video, or does it need to fit the more narrow constraints generally understood by the word "commercial." As I said, I'm probably against what is generally meant. I find it morally repugnant. So, you have your answer if that's what you mean. But, assuming you'll take the more general definition, just any video, now that I think would be useful and interesting.

I want to be philosophical, truth-telling, and hopefully persuasive. Let us assume I only get 60 seconds. Those times slots vary, of course. It depends on the medium as well. T.V. commercials have been trending shorter and shorter due to the poorer and poorer attention spans of the people who still watch them. Online commercials, particularly successful ones, tend to be longer. I'm going to stick to a minute, I guess. 

What would you say to the masses in 60 seconds? What would you display? What is the heart of the message? What's the chronology of that 60 seconds?

I think I would attempt to inject Redpilled Socialist memes into these minds of these people. People have been brainwashed to despise it. They do not understand socialism. I have met far too many people who actually hold socialist values in some respects, they just don't realize it. They have the first-half of the seed, but it isn't complete. Their conditioning prevents them from seeing the basic truth.

I think I would open with an imitation (as closely as legally possible) of the "warning" beep/buzzer you hear for emergencies, etc. It is quite attention grabbing. I want to shock them. I want this to be a Harrison Bergeron + Anonymous moment, but hold the tragedy and cartoonishness.

Beeeeeeeeep!!!

Pay Attention! You will only hear this message once, and chances are, those in power will not want you to see it again.

Here is the fundamental truth: Human beings are selfish, egoistic creatures. We are evil; yes, even you and me. Some are more evil than others; we sit on a spectrum.

Those in power are psychopaths. They do not empathize with humans, and they don't feel obligated to play by any moral rules. They are enslaving the rest of us...

I need a 30 seconds elevator speech on Redpilled Socialism as a description of capitalism. I need pictures and clips to go along with it. There are probably some famous quotes to embed. 

At the end, I would provide a public-crypto key, a site, contacts, etc. I would explain how to organize in a brief way. 

This seems very difficult to do in 60 seconds. 

Of course, perhaps it wouldn't be very effective. We aren't very rational. The entire idea, of course, is useless in this way. I'm just dreaming.
