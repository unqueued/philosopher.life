title: 2019.01.22 - Meditation: Easier

I did breathing exercises upon waking up.

I eventually did some stretches and yoga. I think I want my wife to join me here.

I had a much easier time meditating today. I'm still having difficulty releasing my chest and shoulders, but I could. My mind did not race nearly as much. Meditation ended when Chairman Meow decided to join me and lick my armpit.
