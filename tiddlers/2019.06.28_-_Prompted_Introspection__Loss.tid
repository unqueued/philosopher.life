title: 2019.06.28 - Prompted Introspection: Loss

!! If you knew you would loose ever possession you own but one, what would you keep?

I'm not entirely sure what counts as a possession. I am not sure how you could force me to lose my possessions either. Is this wiki my possession? I have made it fairly difficult to destroy it, but perhaps you mean I would lose access to it (and that would require a loss of many things). I'd keep the money we have in our bank account since we'd need it to survive. I would sorely miss not having [[m10]] among so many other things. I have the identity essentials setup for fleeing a housefire, basic food and water prep, and two bugout bags.

Losing our possessions would provide a significant survival problem to us. It would radically change so much about our lives. Not having pots and pans, media access, clothes, beds, vehicles, the basic identification paperwork to traverse society and access ourselves, no tools, no computers...It would be insane. The loss would take me.
