I hope you valence this better than me. I feel that you do.

Balance
OCT 1 12:29 AM
I don't envy aspects of your position. My wife is ridiculously generous to me. She believes in my message, and predicts I will be persecuted no matter where I go. Because I will never fit in, there's a sense in which figuring out the next move is pointless for me (not that I don't dream). But, I spend a lot of time thinking with my family about how to move them forward.
OCT 1 12:31 AM
You a lot to balance.
OCT 1 12:31 AM

OCT 1 12:31 AM
I have encouraged my wife to help examine this burden. Just to see, there are no good local jobs. That moving home is less than half of my income. That I've spent 10 years in aviation and my bachlors degree is meaningless.
OCT 1 12:33 AM
(we disagree on the the value of your Bachelors ;P)
OCT 1 12:33 AM
Talked to a buddy. He wants me to apply for FedEx. He is friends with the hiring manager.
OCT 1 12:33 AM
Fuck yeah.
OCT 1 12:34 AM
It's in Memphis tn
OCT 1 12:34 AM
I would move in a heartbeat in your shoes.
OCT 1 12:34 AM
But, I do not have roots.
OCT 1 12:34 AM
Neither does my wife.
OCT 1 12:34 AM
Wife has never wanted to move. We literally live in the house she grew up in. Elementary, middle, high school. The n she moved a trailer on the farm when she got older....
OCT 1 12:35 AM
My roots are more about the work I've put into the property and house.
OCT 1 12:36 AM
100% by myself.
OCT 1 12:36 AM
She watched sometimes. Lmao.
OCT 1 12:37 AM
Sorry. I'm in a... Odd mood. Forgive my neediness and "about me" attitude.
OCT 1 12:37 AM
Life's a bitch...

Still being productive despite.
OCT 1 12:38 AM
Looks like fun.
OCT 1 12:39 AM
Your misinterpret, or fully catch my sarcasm. Not sir which.
OCT 1 12:41 AM
Lol
OCT 1 12:41 AM
Lol.
OCT 1 12:42 AM
Well, it looks like work. 
OCT 1 12:42 AM
Yeah. Working on wife's suburban. That thr bank owns. In a garage that paid for. Taking my vacation so I can fix it so her and my daughter and her family can use it to actually go on a real vacation.
OCT 1 12:44 AM
Is that irony. Cause I want it to be?
OCT 1 12:44 AM
I do not understand it.
OCT 1 12:44 AM
Taking a week off from work to evaluate after a string of frustrations made sense.
OCT 1 12:45 AM
I am surprised they would go on vacation without you. 
OCT 1 12:46 AM
But, it is kind that you fix the vehicle.
OCT 1 12:46 AM
Wife usually goes on three vacations a year.
OCT 1 12:46 AM
She is very fortunate.
OCT 1 12:47 AM
We had one planned. But she messed her back up (legit). And I just worked instead. While she recovered.
OCT 1 12:47 AM
She doesn't realize my contributions. I don't think. She has always paid the house bills and I paid for most everything else.
OCT 1 12:48 AM
It matters none. My apologies.
OCT 1 12:50 AM
It sounds like you have many long talks to have with each other. 
OCT 1 12:51 AM
These are not simple issues. Fairly planning your lives together is hard work.
OCT 1 12:51 AM
Much easier if I didn't have a wife and kid in tow.
OCT 1 12:57 AM
My dad walked away. Why not keep the tradition? Lol
OCT 1 12:58 AM
A terrifying thought, lol.
OCT 1 12:58 AM
You wouldn't last a week. That's my bet.
OCT 1 12:58 AM
I'm afraid it is more appealing than terrifying.
OCT 1 12:58 AM
I have always talked to other women since we get t together. Keeping a back up plan in place.
OCT 1 12:59 AM
Looking at the future. I'm not proud of that.
OCT 1 12:59 AM
I hear ya. I live in a different world. My wife says I can have sex with whoever I want, but I'm far too lazy and incompetent to pursue anyone, lol. I'm addicted to her. She's my drug.
OCT 1 1:01 AM
I think she's too generous with her retarded ~~husband~~ oldest kid. 
OCT 1 1:01 AM
Keep talking with her.
OCT 1 1:04 AM
I don't know what else to do when we have a profound disagreement.
OCT 1 1:04 AM
I have been told I have to walk the line. Usually without sex, the intamacy, or affection.
OCT 1 1:05 AM
I live with a great business partner and mother that I my child. She is not a lover. I'm afraid.
OCT 1 1:06 AM
I thought I could change that 15 years ago. When we got together.
OCT 1 1:06 AM
Now that is terrifying. =(
OCT 1 1:07 AM
I'm afraid you confuse that with life. =)

Atv tires to change next. By hand!
OCT 1 1:19 AM
Maxed out on the liquor I had. Beer isnt enough. I dump mouthfuls of Valium. But it barely works. Nor kratom.
OCT 1 1:20 AM
Life is a bitch. But we keep grinding. As you say.
