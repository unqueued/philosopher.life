title: My Autism

I have always had a mental condition, we just didn't know what it was. You know I didn't add up, that I wasn't normal. You've seen weird ticks, unexplainables, the moments of brilliance and the moments of insane stupidity. You've known by the way I turn my head when I watch TV. You've known from our many conversations, given your long set of experiences and training in having conversations with people. You've known when you realized you don't understand some of the things I say, and yet have reasons to believe I'm saying something reasonable.  You've seen how I can't socialize correctly (and it doesn't make sense to you given the rest of my intelligence). You've known by the fact that despite the many odds against me, I've done some things that you didn't expect I could. There is a place in me that is deeply retarded, and yet there are places that very abnormally functional on the bell curve. You've known I was a 4eak for a long time. You've known.

I think you think I am a narcissist or a psychopath. If if it is true that you do, then I think it makes you hypocrites as the least. I think it shows a lack of empathy on your part. I think it is a fissure between us. I think that everyone is narcisistic. Why shouldn't I? I think that narcisism and self-interest is simply explained in different ways. I think morality is an ad hoc concept. Those Kantian thoughts, those come from the faster acting part of your mind, the part that doesn't think for real. Trust your fucking frontal lobes. 

I think you dismiss me as some addicted fool. I think you have no clue about what I've experienced. I think you do not understand the concept of addiction, nor the concept of a drug. I think you do not have enough background in the analysis of the rewards center of our brains, nor a meta-analysis of those analyses.

You mean something in the symbol of the Jackelope. What do you mean by it? How do I see it? I see a childhood story that demonstrates I can't trust what you said to me. What do you see? That you were just joking? Okay, then I see that you didn't know your child well enough to know how he actually thought, that you lacked empathy for your children in critical ways. 



[ASD|Autism Spectrum Disorder]]

The ways in which I play video games is an excellent example of my autism. I play ludologically, with zero care for narrative. I do not "play as the character" or roleplay or see myself in a story. 

I have difficulty suspending disbelief. 



, specifically, the appearance of what was called PDD-NOS (before they were all rolled into the spectrum).
