title: 2019.06.15 - TDL: Roast

* Family Time!
* Roast. I'm looking forward to it. =)
* You might do some laundry. You go through it much slower over the summer.
* We've still not done any swimming as a family. I think your son could use your guidance here yet again.
* Continue to encourage your children to have a clean and fast handwriting style. 
* The [[Music: Library]] inventory audit is going much slower than anticipated. Let's keep grinding. Afterward, we can do a judgment pass and set up a faster process for adding to the collection.
