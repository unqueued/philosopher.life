title: 2019.04.22 - Wiki Review: Congeal

* [[2019.04.21 - Prompted Introspection: Fam Vacay]]
** Edited.
* [[2019.04.21 - Wiki Review: Pleasant]]
** Been walking a lot. My wife is complaining about leg pain. I need to walk (and, so does she).
* [[2019.04.21 - TDL: Spring Break]]
** Almost everything completed. That is satisfying.
* [[2019.04.21 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Morpheusaic Chomsky]]
** Edited.
* [[2019.04.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Amazing Easter]]
** She is coming out of her shell a lot more with me. I adore it.

** It's so fucking weird to speak Christian Theology when I'm not a Christian, except with my wife. Ah, but that's because there is only one maybe two major {[[axioms]]} different to the best of my abilities.
* [[2019.04.17 - T-Money: Project]]
** That is an odd mixture of books.
* [[2019.04.21 - T-Money: Easter]]
** I have a very different perspective on what is worth my time.
* [[2019.04.21 - L: Functioning]]
** Beautifully meta.
* [[2019.04.21 - Jop: Ping]]
** I think she only connects when it's really tickling her. Most of the time, it's irrelevant to her.
* [[2019.04.15 - K: Tao]]
** I think he cares for it more than I do. I am, of course, an asshole.
* [[2019.04.17 - K: U2]]
** We've said very little.
* [[2019.04.19 - K: Work]]
** Senioritis.
* [[2019.04.21 - K: Paper]]
** I'm betting he spent his spoons.
* [[2019.04.15 - L: Curation]]
** Interesting to see the time limit. I'm probably not going to be able to condense it for her like that.
* [[2019.04.16 - L: Cathartic]]
** I clearly do not understand.
* [[2019.04.17 - AA: Testing]]
** She's been working hard.
* [[2019.04.19 - AA: Prep]]
** I'm not used to emoticons, clearly. I'm often inaccurate with them, and I never know how accurate others are with them.
* [[2019.04.21 - AA: Easter]]
** Fascinating to hear her perspective on it.
* [[2019.04.17 - L: Not Shabby]]
** Glad to be back.
* [[2019.04.20 - L: Hugs]]
** It's a fascinating experience to see her response here.
* [[2019.04.16 - JRE: Counting Calories]]
** I am slow. I should have known what he was talking about.
* [[2019.04.21 - JRE: Vacation]]
** I hope it is peaceful for him.
* [[2019.04.21 - Family Log: Butter Than Ever]]
** There was a war for the [[title.Title]]. Lol.
* [[2019.04.21 - /b/]]
** Still thinking on it. Sadly, the images do not come back. I have no idea how people replicate it at all.
