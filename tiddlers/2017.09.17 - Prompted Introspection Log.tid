!! Are you going to shoot for the K-Hole again?

Not at a high dosage. I'm done with that. I'm glad to have figured out that I indeed did experience a K-hole on my first dosage, I just wasn't sure at the time. Confirmed! That says something interesting about my physiology. 

The K-hole is perfectly fine. Getting sick is not. DCK's effect on my depressive tendencies isn't lost on me either.
