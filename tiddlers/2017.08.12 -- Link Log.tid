*** This is no accident. We suffer the same fate.
*** Note that "owning the means of production" also requires owning the knowledge of production. Political and Financial Labor are quite real, and power to the people means they absolutely must be educated to the brim. Fuck the proud no-nothings and those who seek to enslave the minds of the poor, powerless, and uneducated.

*** Baby-boomers have missed the boat. They've collected the wrong things, they cultivated the wrong things and people, and they've given the wrong world to their children. Burn in hell.

*** Macron was also Le Penn Light. Neo-liberals are wolves in sheepskin.

** Too small. They really need to buy the decentralized model. Stop centralizing, Mozilla. If you really want to disrupt, you need to start generating networks that can compete with Google, etc. That's only going to happen through distributed computing.

** An interesting post. I love ProtonMail. Again, decentrality fixes these things. I know it's way, way harder logistically.

** The censors come for us all. They are tightening down on the scope of the dialectic. We will have lively debate in the "center" as determined by our censors. Socialism is officially a Dark Art in their eyes.

** I have yet to make the switch again. I've tried so many times. Been a Chrome user since day 1. Extensions make the Browser (a virtualized OS, imho). I need both. =(

** Single-threaded is actually getting closer to competitive. Will I one day own an AMD monster again? Perhaps.

* https://aeon.co/essays/so-you-re-surrounded-by-idiots-guess-who-the-real-jerk-is
** I think they would be tempted to call me a jerk. The shortcuts they've used here have their flaws. I think empathy is more complex than they've presented.

* https://insights.hpe.com/articles/say-goodbye-to-your-keyboard-1708.html
** I have a hard time believing keyboards are going to disappear. There are certain kinds of work that I'm not sure sure can be safely, privately, or effectively done without a keyboard.
