[1:27 PM] h0p3: How's your world?
[1:28 PM] robotic_scarab: It's crazy in more ways than one!
[1:28 PM] h0p3: Lol. I hear that.
[1:30 PM] h0p3: They are shutting down a whole bunch of stuff in our area. Feels more real each day.
[1:31 PM] robotic_scarab: Peach's lucky to be in a position where he's working from home until June (boggles my mind); the studio I work at has moved to WFH as well, with exceptions made for people on the production team who need to be editing video on workstations & the servers. I tried to do the same on Monday but had computer issues and came in, then a huge request involving the archive side of things came in yesterday night (I'm usually quite adamant that I don't look at my work email after hours and on weekends, but when I get texted about stuff... at least had to address it, lol). That's been a whooole messy thing to figure out today, and since my fellow archivist is on PTO this week tis all me! wheeeeeee
[1:32 PM] robotic_scarab: given that I usually spend my weekends just hanging out with Peach & my weekdays at work and home, nothing about my routine has really changed b/c of the virus tbh
[1:33 PM] robotic_scarab: tho it's still getting in my head because I'm realizing work is really weird without other people and even if it was just minor daily contact, I actually miss that more than I thought
[1:33 PM] h0p3: Lawd. You have extra on your shoulders during this crazy time.
[1:33 PM] h0p3: It must be eerie not to have them, and less fun. :frowning:
[1:34 PM] h0p3: I'm glad that Peach gets to work from home though, and it's great that your routine isn't too disrupted.
[1:35 PM] h0p3: I have no idea how long this thing is going to last. Any projections from your workplace?
[1:39 PM] robotic_scarab: I have no idea either
[1:39 PM] robotic_scarab: they just announced restaurant closings in the city here, and that's going to hit the service workers hard
[1:39 PM] h0p3: No doubt.
[1:39 PM] robotic_scarab: a month seems difficult for people to manage, much less longer than that
[1:39 PM] h0p3: Hand-to-mouth cannot afford this.
[1:40 PM] robotic_scarab: exactly :S
[1:41 PM] robotic_scarab: I donated to a local food bank after I went grocery shopping, and I intend to keep matching my grocery spending with donations through this time ... I expect they'll end up getting hard and it feels like at least something I can do
[1:41 PM] h0p3: It's been weighing on mind; [[AIR]]'s hours got cut, and I can't stop reading about it.
[1:43 PM] h0p3: I saw that. That is a good idea. I know it will be put to good use.
[1:44 PM] robotic_scarab: I feel like I went down the rabbit hole of reading about it last week and have had to take a step back over the weekend
[1:44 PM] robotic_scarab: so much of it is not up to us :S
[1:45 PM] h0p3: You don't have to hunt for people to help that way, and it fills immediate needs of those who merit our time the most.
[1:47 PM] h0p3: It's a painful read. I agree that so little is up to us. I can appreciate the need to step back, catch one's breath, and have enough distance to be objective.
[1:48 PM] robotic_scarab: How are you all doing/feeling? I haven't caught up on your wiki in about a week :(
[1:51 PM] h0p3: [[k0sh3k]] has had all the major changes. Still intense with the offspring, but the flow and pace aren't different. We already practically live in a bubble, so not huge changes. I'm a minor/dabbler prepper, so we've not experienced some of the rush. Feeling good, feeling productive, and my usual level of anxiety has not changed. Seems similar for everyone in our family.
[1:54 PM] robotic_scarab: good! I'm glad it hasn't had too much of an impact & hopefully it continues to stay that way
