How's it going?
SAT 2:29 PM
Good good —writing fluff to my statistics teacher.  Wish I was better at fluff
SAT 2:30 PM
Fluffing is hard work.
SAT 2:31 PM
Yep :flushed::face_with_open_mouth_vomiting::dizzy_face:
SAT 2:31 PM
It’s a written summary of all I learned this week. I find myself making up things just to fill out the sheet and get a decent grade
SAT 2:33 PM
Something not to torment my students with weekly
SAT 2:33 PM
How’s everything with you?
SAT 2:34 PM
Sounds like the teacher is taking the pulse of the class and giving away free grades where possible. Incentive structures are such that they want to pass everyone. I think many are quick to drop people to a B to fight inflation, but they are slow to fail.
SAT 2:35 PM
Math seems like an odd one to do it for, but I'm bad on that front. I try to make both of my children do it daily.
SAT 2:36 PM
It's hard to do for math though.
SAT 2:36 PM
Yeah...I also don’t enjoy the write a summary of an article where the summary is required to be longer than the article?
SAT 2:36 PM
Sigh
SAT 2:36 PM
Throw up definitions, examples, and tidbits. It's like squeezing a rock for water.
SAT 2:36 PM
The proportions class has been pretty fun though
SAT 2:37 PM
Yay!
SAT 2:37 PM
I'm doing fine. Kinda a chill day. We're doing our monthly audits. The surface I have to cover this month is smaller. Taking the month into perspective and cleaning my second brain up aint so bad.
SAT 2:39 PM
Trying to convince my children to bot Clicker Heroes with me. I think it will be a valuable use of their time on many fronts.
SAT 2:39 PM
Clicker Heroes?
SAT 2:40 PM
I like writing bots and watching them play though.
SAT 2:40 PM
Nice!
SAT 2:40 PM
A skinnerbox.
SAT 2:40 PM
It's an idle/clicker game.
SAT 2:40 PM
Ahhh ok
