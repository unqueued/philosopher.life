* Finish Bodyguard?
* You need to shower, homie.
* Keep complaining about the AC. It needs to be fixed.
** They replaced Johnny, and my wife feels there is something off about his replacement.
* Not much else planning for the interview, but we're going to need to actually get a credit card in case that is the only thing the car rentals will take (though I think a taxi service will likely be enough). 
* Do the best you can with your children. It feels like the end.
