!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
...it was natural and perhaps human that the privileged princes of these new economic dynasties thirsting for power, reached out for control over government itself. They created a new despotism and wrapped it in the robes of legal sanction. In its service new mercenaries sought to regiment the people, their labor, and their property. And as a result the average man once more confronts the problem that faced the Minute Man.

The weasel word is "natural." That fabled religious-philosophical term has been the bane of many premises. I am virulently opposed to the compatibilist view which allows everyone off the hook for being greedy and selfish bastards. You folks only take up the notion of being free when it conveniently suits you. To say selfishness is inescapably and immutably human nature is just a rationalization to help you not feel like you choose to be an asshole.

Beautifully, this quote can take up the claim that there are huge veins of egoistic selfishness, and that's exactly why we must fight against it with our governments. I am indebted to Roosevelt's understanding of how selfishness corrupts power structures on a historical basis. The number of contemporary "patriots" who have no fucking clue is yet another example of history repeating itself.<<ref "m">>

A call to arms is necessary.

Even if you are a wonderful philosopher and realpolitik historian, you are an ugly man...I don't want to see you crank your shaft one iota more than is necessary. Your drunk cumshots are like the 5 to 30 minute orgasms of swine (had a vet friend who had to jerk pigs off to get his degree, ROFL). The brain bukkake is too much to handle.">>
