title: 2018.11.18 - Guitar: Drifting Off

I finally have a routine, and my fingers can feel it. I'm just grinding the same 5 songs. It's a good thing I really like these pieces, lol. I really want to be able to play them without significant flaws at speed and to be able to focus on the feeling of it (and to play). 

By the end of my session, I was drifting off! I stopped caring. It could just be my lack of sleep though. I play the guitar much better when I've slept well, I'm not feeling depressed, I've been practicing with consistency, and I've had some coffee.
