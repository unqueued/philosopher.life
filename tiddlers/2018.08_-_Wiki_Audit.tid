!! Audit:

* I did reorganize [[Computing]]! =) Looks good, too.
* Crypto for {[[Verify]]} improved. That's a non-trivial improvement.
* The radical gains in {[[Help]]} have been awesome. I now have somewhere to point designed for guests. In fact, [[FTO]] is now meaningfully possible. My intentions are clear, my explanations and justifications reasonably clear enough, etc. If someone really wanted to understand, they could.
* I must admit, I've done very little in my {[[Principles]]} rework. It's such a huge fucking problem to deal with. That said, I have made progress. I can't hold myself to some insane standard here. I do work very hard on this wiki.
* I think [[Hub]] and [[Pin]] have become even more streamlined, cleaner, and I've done a better job making them say what I need them to say.
* Some of my letter writing really exhausted my time and energy. I didn't have much left. In fact, socializing in general costs me. I'm glad to do it. [[FTO]] ain't easy yo. I also think that my [[Deep Reading]] and [[Link Log]] have taken huge chunks of time out of my day too. It's hard to achieve everything I want to achieve.
* I'm left with some mechanical questions which I've not answered. I'm not quite sure how I want [[Music: Exploration]] to evolve. [[Sphygmus]]' letters should show more authorship. I'm not sure what to do about that.
* I can now search my wiki with much better filters. I love that!
