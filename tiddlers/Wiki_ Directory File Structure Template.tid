title: Wiki: Directory File Structure Template

!! About:

//If you care about it, put a ring on it.//

Here I store the common template for many directories on this wiki. I need to force myself to think about issues in this kind of framework. And, I wanted to make it easy on myself, hence the template.

* New and Reconstruction Process
** Use a template
** Brainstorm quotes, aphorisms, and kernel tests. Digest, organize, and respond to them. Own them, then weave.
** Streamline
** Compile resources and dreams.

---
!! Principles:

* Do you have a complex practice you want to engage in? Use a template.
* Do you have a concept that you can't define well or that is particularly important? Use a template.
* Don't forget to look up quotes and [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]] content for designing and thinking about the project you are beginning (particularly on your second draft; after the first retirement).
