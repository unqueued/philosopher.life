We are working on empathizing with ourselves, honesty, self-reflection, working hard, doing our best, id

* Lecture
** When necessary, we must talk and think about particular subjects or ideas. entifying with our future selves, executive functioning, delaying gratification, thinking about and applying utilitarianism, appreciating and working with our virtue theoretic identities and practices, and understanding the Kantian point of view.

We are working to understand the redpilled nature of the world together, to understand the power dynamics and structures of the world, to appreciate and be skilled in the art of socializing, and to have the means to be happy in a dire world.

* Math
** Life of Fred
*** Middle school completed
** Khan Academy
*** Almost done with 5th grade; more grinding to do; it's just proof that she can pass tests.
** Singapore Math 
*** Only up to 3rd grade completed; I love the emphasis on word problems and problem solving as opposed to calculation.
** [[Better Explained|https://betterexplained.com]] 
*** This resource is amazing. 
*** Her current preferred assignment. I'm fine with it, since I think the narrative and clear explanations should give her a strong groundwork for advanced mathematics. 

* Problem Solving
** Reading about using Python, Bash, Zsh, and Xonsh (~15 minutes)
*** Working through a [[Linux and CLI ebook|https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxcommand/files/latest/download?source=typ_redirect]].
*** Reading real-world python and bash programs, commenting them line-by-line to demonstrate understanding, and following up with a mile-high commentary afterwards to show she can synthesize the parts and understand the architecture and purpose of the code she is reading (how the pieces fit together, why, etc.)
** Writing Tools (~45 minutes)
*** Administration of her linux machines, servers, and VMs
*** Writing scripts and automation tools
*** Configuring and organizing her digital life

* Formal Reasoning
** Reading analytic philosophy
*** Current focus is on generalized branches of philosophy, particularly understanding core concepts and terminology. This is a survey of the landscapes.
** Economics, mathematics, computer science, and physics are also acceptable subjects

* Literature
** Reading and discussing a standard university American literature textbook
*** American literature was chosen to test the water, to introduce her to the art of literary interpretation of serious canonical works.
** World literature is coming.

* Spanish
** The primary goal of learning Spanish is to understand languages and English with more depth. 
** The second goal of learning Spanish is to literally become bilingual to some degree. She may become fluent. Right now, it's about the grammar. She has an excellent memory, and her accent is dead on. She may develop a reading knowledge, move to chatting online, and eventually develop an ear and conversational skills. There are many programs available; finding the people to practice with, now that's the hard part.

** Here she finds resources, bookmarks, and tools. 
*** This is also quite useful for shaping and helping her find content and 
** She searches for answers and practices asking questions.
** She develops a bullshit detector, interprets authority, and discovers the core of "relevance" as she spiders through the world of information.
** Requirements:
*** Find one new tool for the command line, install it, understand it, explor it, use it, etc. -- bookmark it.
*** Find one good news source, bookmarked and organized.
*** Find one good website, by her personal standards, also bookmarked.

* Videos
** School of Life
** Game of Thrones (art worth watching)

* P.E.
** I hope she can make exercise a lifelong habit.

* Journal
** She keeps track of everything she does, reflects, and writes about it. 

Academic Bootcamps Available:

** I'd love to see 100wpm for standard English and something comparable for technical/formal/programmatic writing.

** Becoming an excellent touchscreen typist will also be useful. It must be practiced.
