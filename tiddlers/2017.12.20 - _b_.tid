Showerthought: there is a possibility that my Daseinic identity didn't really begin in full until I had a constant stream of memory, around 5 years old. I married at 19. That means that next year, I will have spent half of my Daseinic life with my wife. That's pretty insane. Just from a chronological perspective, she is in half of my memory (although, I'd argue more).
