title: 2018.09.29 â€“- Prompted Introspection: Trade Places with Fpmous

!! If you could trade places with a famous person for a day, who would you like to be and why?

Lady Melisandre, you grant me yet another wishful thinking gift. Presumably, I won't directly think or see as they do (ultimately, I'm unsure of how this works), standing in their mental shoes, empathize down to the qualia, etc. This is "trading places." There are only three reasonable answers:

# Use the trade as a drug for hedonia
# Use the trade to maximize the happiness of [[h0p3]]'s life after the tradeback
# Use the trade to improve the world as much as possible

The first option is insanely short-sighted. I don't need an experience machine.

The second option is incredibly selfish. I'm not sure who could improve my family's life the most, but Bezos is not a trivial bet. I'm not sure if I could manage to transfer the bulk of his wealth to me in just a day. Even a drop of his wealth would radically alter what I could do in the world.

The third option seems most important, but I think it would require enormous choreography and foreknowledge. In fact, a day is so short that it still might just be better to transfer wealth and allow me to spend it wisely without the time constraints.

In any case, I'd probably need to find a way to lock myself personal body down for 24 hours to prevent the switchee from preventing me from doing my work.
