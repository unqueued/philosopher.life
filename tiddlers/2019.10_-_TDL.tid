!! Audit:

* Just, like, so many major obstacles overcome in my life this month. ;P.
** Was a big month, no doubt. We're moving!
* I don't understand the rules for what goes in here.
** I also don't understand how it relates enough to [[CTS]]
*** I also constantly repeat myself. 
** You barely talk about school, reading, and writing. The bulk of your work, lol. You talk about the other stuff far more.
* They have been enjoying freetime as carrots. No other reward seems effective. 
* It's a good thing you have humor in here because it's just flat out sad what you have to plan and reason about in here.
** I also appreciate that you are the kind of person who laughs at his own jokes.
** Do what you can. =)
* Sex. As always.
** Presumably, this doesn't end. 
* 60-70% success rate. 
** You pile a bunch in there sometimes, and there's no way. You keep piling. 
* That break was excellent. Still tons to do at home.
** Coffeebliss hit the spot.
* Btw, you dreamed up way too much for Books+Art, but what you made was cool. 
* I like how I simplify what I want in life here. Walk, talk, fuck, eat, sleep covers almost all the bases. Just variation here.
* Glad I got my teeth cleaned, a new sex toy, a new state to live in.
