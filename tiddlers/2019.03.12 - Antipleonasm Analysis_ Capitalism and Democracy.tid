title: 2019.03.12 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Capitalism and Democracy

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Personally I'm in favor of democracy, which means that the central institutions in the society have to be under popular control. Now, under capitalism we can't have democracy by definition. Capitalism is a system in which the central institutions of society are in principle under autocratic control. Thus, a corporation or an industry is, if we were to think of it in political terms, fascist; that is, it has tight control at the top and strict obedience has to be established at every level â€“ there's a little bargaining, a little give and take, but the line of authority is perfectly straightforward. Just as I'm opposed to political fascism, I'm opposed to economic fascism. I think that until major institutions of society are under the popular control of participants and communities, it's pointless to talk about democracy.

Preach, yo. I hear Rawls and Marx screaming out of this. Who doesn't enjoy reading what they already believe? 

Democracy is scary to me, of course. I look at the masses, and I am disturbed. The average isn't the best, but this is the best form of fairness I can find. This is yet another reason I'm so radically in favor of giving everyone the best educations possible. I don't want to be voting alongside fools. Nobody should want such a thing, but those in power find it far more convenient to manipulate than empower those around them.

Insofar as information is power, I expect that power (education being one example of information power) to be decentralized and disseminated [[irwartfrr]]. Perhaps it is a chicken or egg problem, but progress had to start somewhere. We can do it again (maybe it already is). It requires each of us sacrificing as much of our leisure time as we can [[irwartfrr]]. Some people don't even have time for that, and that is an example of capitalism so effectively enslaving people they don't even have a chance to think.

Helping others even have the chance to fulfill their obligations to be [[good]] political animals is our obligation. I do not claim that voting, as it is structured right now, is the fitting political action.

The emergences of centralized power necessary to enable the Rule of Law and solve those computational problems which require Federation (reaching up to the highest echelons of adjudication, enforcement, and legislation) must be in virtue of decentralized structures which can effectively perpetuate, maintain, and improve themselves. This is why I'm so concerned with implementing [[The Original Position]], [[Outopos]], and [[AIoutopIA]]. Beyond the infrastructure, digital representations and proxies necessary for profound decentralization can be profoundly strong if we really wanted them to be.   

Insofar as capitalism conceptually leads to the centralization of power, it is antithetical to the very notion of democracy. [[Saint Chomsky]] is right. Democracy just is the fitting decentralization of power in a context. Capitalism is autocratic and fascist. It exists to centralize power in the hands of those who already have it.

I'm not convinced we can draw some conceptual line between political and economic fascism too strongly. One is a subset of the other. 

He's being hyperbolic to the point we can't take him literally here: obviously, we should talk about democracy. We can't simply act like we have a democracy without the necessary conditions, and that's what he's pointing out.
