title: 2017.10.25 -- D2: Log

 I've noticed IM on mobs that shouldn't for 1.13. I'm worried that several things aren't quite right in my D2 executable. I'm testing The Pit for MFing and finding Socket gear I desperately need. Seems to work. I need to find some socketed items for runewords or some very high level uniques to get my smiter where I want him. Eventually, my smiter will just grind the ubers.
