title: 2019.02.15 - Be A Good Dad: Semantics

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

My daughter continues to ask penetrating questions. I am unable to provide answers beyond trying to explain why I can't provide answers to the best of my knowledge. I continue to redpill them about society and prepare them for increasing alienation. 

Capitalism, narratives in games, rhetoric, dialectics, [[The Good]] (as always), contextualism, elitism, democracy, language creation, perils of gnosticism, and wandering. 

One of my concerns is this: my children are crazy good listeners (which aint easy with my autistically empowered schizotypal machinegun rabbitholing), excellent questioners in the dialectic, and deconstructively skilled, but they don't do enough construction. The difference between the difficulty of what they can take in vs what they put out is too large; it is the networking Robustness principle [[irwrongfrr]]. I'm not creating enough opportunities for them to be constructive, to put down tentpegs, to lay out their own positions and have them more explicitly state the changes in their reality maps. The analysis is there, the synthesis is not. Indeed, I am a failure in this myself. I must double my efforts.

This is clearly my problem to handle. A good philosopher would know how to teach and motivate construction far better than I do.
