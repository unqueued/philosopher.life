title: 2018.04.06 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Feeling Safe

!! What makes you feel safe?

Note the difference between what makes someone "feel" something and being justified in feeling that way. I believe I could name things that enable me to delude myself into feeling safe when I'm actually not. 

Safety requires a threat-model, as in: safe from what in what context? It's a matter of degrees and kinds as well. You appear to mean "safe" in some very general sense (a hyperobject so large that I can't fully conceive of it in the first place). Your use of "make" here suggests that I've experienced it before. From what I can tell, we aren't safe. I think the human species is going to wipe itself out. What we need to make us safe may be possible (however implausible), but I don't think I've ever experienced it.

I go back to my tried and true answer: decentralizing power.
