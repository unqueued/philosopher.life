!! Why do you hate me? (Samwise Gamgee)

Alright, I've not read the LOTR series in a couple years. I used to read it every year, but I haven't lately. And, you know my memory isn't what it used to be, by a longshot. All I have left are emotional footprints of the story, a feel for it. I'd need to deep read it again to give you an explicit reason for why you don't deserve to live beyond a shadow of a doubt.

You represent humanity, according to that beautiful idiot: Tolkien. That might be a good enough reason. 

I think you are annoying, difficult to empathize with, often the problem, lacking vision, and uninterested or lacking curiosity in that which matters most. I think you represent a terrible, anti-intellectual person.
