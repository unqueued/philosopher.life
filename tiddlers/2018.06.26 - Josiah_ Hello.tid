It's a pleasure to meet you. I apologize for taking so long to develop my response to you. I'm making changes to my wiki because of your words, and there is a great deal to think about.

I'd like to thank you for taking me seriously: //thank you//. That matters to me, and I aim to show you the same hospitality. If burdensome, feel free not to pick up the threads I lay down for you here. I do not wish to annoy you with my systematic reply to your thoughtful comments.

You said to me:

<<<
WHOA! That is seriously brilliant.  I need a couple of days to survey it. Comments later. It's lovely to see an actual wiki in it's purpose.
<<<

Purpose is //the// word, my friend. I aim to "see [my] actual wiki in it's purpose" in the most teleologically (purpose by definition!) engineered way available to me. You have confirmed it for me, and I'm going to continue engineering {[[About]]} in virtue of that kind of reasoning (unless you have something to say about it). It is possible that one could offer me no higher praise than to say I'm using my wiki in its purpose; I truly hope to live up to the spirit of that goal.

One thing that stands out to me about your comments is how quickly and directly you zeroed in on my teleological crisis and computation. Besides my wife and children, you are the first person to meaningfully do so in my eyes. Straniero, sei il benvenuto nella mia famiglia. I do not have bread to break with you this far away, but I would like to share your company.

I also want to say thank you for not immediately calling me an arrogantly ignorant asshole, even if I am one. I will remember it. And, in [[T42T]] fashion, you have earned two things from me:

# You've earned the right to ask a non-trivial favor of me. Please feel free to exercise your right. In part, insofar as you desire, I'm here to build trust and ensure my cooperation with you.
# If it means anything, you are hereby granted admin powers on my wiki: insofar as you desire, tell me what you think all the way to the [[Root]], even if it hurts me. My goal is to always post what you say (barring PII sanitization) and respond to it with maximum charity.
#* You are officially one of only a few [[Other|Find The Others]] Admins I have identified so far.

As I said to you on the forums:

<<<
@ Josiah

I'm glad you like it. I'm always looking to improve it. I will think carefully about your comments.
<<<

I mean it. And, that's what I'm doing right now. You said to me:

<<<
Noted.

Side note: TW is very interesting in that semantic "heft" can play a big part in motivation towards function change (i.e. differentiation and "evolution" of the tech functions in service of semantic drive) in the wiki. Usually software doesn't have the adaptive flex needed for that, nor the conceptual framework for think/feel it through. 
<<<

I love the way you say it. That's right on the money. Why don't more people see the concept of the wiki, especially TiddlyWiki's beautiful implementation, like this? I don't want to imagine life without the tool now. How do you make use of Tiddlywiki in your life? Are there other tools you teleologically adore as much as Tiddlywiki?

You clearly get the notion of //soft//ware and its relation to creative processes, likely beyond what I do in many respects. I'm on a quest to understand how to use this tool more effectively. You appear to have been thinking about this issue longer than I have; do you have any unique examples of leveraging the wiki you could point me to? I want to learn to really make the most of this wiki and my media consumption in general. Since you are a sysadmin, what do you think I should be doing, consuming, or creating?

<<<
h0p3

I read quite a lot of it. Its interesting. Particularly the themes and style of composition.
<<<

Thank you for giving it your charitable attention. I can see you saw with eyes wide open. I apologize for its roughness and arrogance. I realize I'm an uneducated savage when it comes to the art of writing (probably just art in general). I don't know what counts as good style, taste, or how to make anything that others would generally enjoy reading.<<ref "g">> In some crucial way that I will never be able to make up for, narratives are one of my profound weaknesses as an autistic man. Gotta start somewhere though, eh?<<ref "ij">>

<<<
It comes over, philosophically, as an "assay in teleology."
<<<

You are the first stranger to ever //get it//. Thank you for seeing it. Purpose is at the very heart of it (I [[hope]]!). I've never had a random stranger make me feel so much less alone in this world.

Let me also say, my work is incredibly [[fff]], a mess to read, and perhaps the wrong approach entirely. Do not hold back your criticism, please. I trust you to deliver it as wisely as you see fit.

<<<
Its very concerned with meaning, but also legacy--lessons learnt, rules derived that a Putative Junior Should Benefit From.
<<<

Nailed it! In fact, you've said the thing which I've not been able to make explicit enough to myself! I have made changes to {[[About]]} in virtue of your claim.

I'd like to add my executive functioning isn't so great in crucial respects. I'm trying to teach and remind myself as clearly as I can. Actively reasoning about how to become better at being my own sublator has required me to give myself enormous structures of evidence. I have to teach myself and my children how to be a good human (functioning a bit like the Nicomachean Ethics). It's an epic struggle for me, and I know I'm bad at it.

<<<
In that regard it brought strongly to mind the great Russian film "Palms" (Ladoni) by Artour Aristakysian that is a meditation by a father about his unborn child using extraordinary footage of ordinary & disabled people: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D3tSwHMQa0 (The English subtitled version is gone, only Spanish, sorry).
<<<

Wow! That film is like nothing I've ever seen before. You must forgive my complete ignorance of film. I am beyond illiterate. I don't aim to put words in your mouth ("in that regard," of course), but I found an excerpt about the film that floored me.<<ref "AA">> 

I wept watching that film. I hope to live up to something like that; taking brokenness and building something from which there emerges not brokenness. I'm trying to make something extraordinary of my Humanity given ordinary pieces of my humanity. That appears to be the only functional method to reach my goal.

<<<
The point being:  they share an emergent single, recursively, pursued thread backgrounded against the viscus nature of the "normal".
<<<

I'm trying to interpret this sentence accurately, and I have strong doubts about my results. I take you to be talking about [[The Good]] of Humanity; the objective (or intersubjective) teleological structure of meaning which rises from the flatness. You could easily mean something else, and I want to see it. Please correct me.

<<<
If one were cynical you could see it purely as a writing exercise about inhabiting a persona that adumbrates a system that is "right". But its cleverer than that. Its almost a human writing it about a reality.
<<<

This line has been a splinter in my mind for a week now. I can guarantee you I will be thinking about it for a long time. Maybe you are pointing at that which terrifies and drives me; I cannot make it meaningful enough for myself (and I suspect I never will). It is quite possible that I do not merit (or may even vehemently hope to disagree with) the compliment you've given me.

Upon reflection and careful parsing (as well as enlisting the help of my wife), I believe you have profoundly understood my goal with the wiki...but there is a possible interpretation of these words which amount to perhaps the most devastating critique of me and my work you could possibly have written. It is a haunting feeling to see both paths at the same time. It's painful enough that I almost don't want to know which meaning you hold; well-conceived ad hominem attacks aren't fallacies in this realm. 

This is such an intensely personal object to me, a talisman-mirror; sometimes it is all I can hope for in the world and myself. Forgive my paranoia, pride, and insanity, since I do not mean to insult your intelligence or intentions one iota. It is hard for me to fully appreciate what you've said.

This wiki is not a fiction and is not meant to be one (even if it is ultimately absurd or "wrong"). It really is just a human writing to itself about what it perceives reality to be, and I really do aim to make it as "right" as I can. I really do want to be as justified in my belief about my purpose (and therefore also about teleology in general) as I can. I hope to look forwards and backwards in my life to find it presently meaningful.

If you are claiming that I've done a clever and meaningful job of painting some representation of myself painting representations of myself, that is very high praise. The gnawing doubt is that you really mean that I am just a shell though, and if that is the case, you might also consider my work (and how I perceive myself, and probably myself directly) to be a complete joke (which is tough to swallow, because I can't brush you off: you clearly understand me too effectively for me to have the right to dismiss you for lacking charity).

"It is almost a human talking to itself about itself" is worryingly ambiguous to me. It reminds me of Hume going outside his house of "I" to look inside and see who's there only to discover it is empty.

I crave your clarification.

<<<
I might have further comments on the relation of the message to the medium.

Josiah 
<<<

One major mechanic of the wiki which I cannot find an effective enough use for is "tagging." I'm autistic, which means I'm not a good top-down Bayesian modeler in many contexts; it is possible this is one of my deep blindnesses at work. Please, tell me the magic of using tags like a boss. I am very poor at it, and it looks powerful. In fact, if you have any thoughts about how to improve any of my mechanics or models, I am all ears.

I've read your [[Five Facets Model of Creative Process|https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/chor/2014/00000005/00000001/art00005?crawler=true]]. It's interesting, and it lights up nicely with Tiddlywiki. Do you have other work I should read? Do you think there are any incredibly strong introductions to Gendlin? I beg you to define the word {[[Focus]]} for me as clearly as you are willing, please.

Lastly, I know very little about your philosophical point of view. I would like to know where you are coming from and empathize with your position. I also realize that it is time consuming and emotionally exhausting to speak with me. You may have much better things to do with your time, nomad. In any case, I am listening. 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]

<<footnotes "AA" "'My little son, it's me, your father...' The narrator tries to communicate with his unborn son and takes off on a journey were you see faces of apparitions of those outcasts, who find their solace of living only in the shadows; outside, but beside, the political and economical system; system that kills the individual and creates masses instead. These outcasts are bums, cripples, madmen, lunatics. They, in the eyes of the narrator, are the only ones, that know what it means to be human. They are not corrupt by the masses or the system; they are so overwhelmed by their madness or dreams, that they have lost the relationship with the world. They live in a world of their own, thus enabling freedom from the system. What they do, is wait. They quietly wait for the day the kingdom of God will descend upon earth.">>
