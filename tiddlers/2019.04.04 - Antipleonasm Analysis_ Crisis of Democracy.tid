title: 2019.04.04 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Crisis of Democracy

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
During the 1960s, large groups of people who are normally passive and apathetic began to try to enter the political arena to press their demands.â€¦ The naive might call that democracy, but that's because they don't understand. The sophisticated understand that that's the crisis of democracy.

I want to say that if people aren't participating in democracy, then you don't have a democracy. Democracies might tolerantly give rise to lower participation and the centralization of power which disables the representation in some cases, but surely there can be exceptions. Enforcing and training political animals to fulfill their obligations to each other isn't easy. This is what applying [[The Original Position]] is meant to do though. Representation cannot be an accident; this is why I punish those who abstain from political life.
