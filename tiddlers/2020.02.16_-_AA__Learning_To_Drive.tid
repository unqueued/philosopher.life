How was your weekend so far? You get some sleep?
Feb 16 1:58pm
How's the fam doing?
Feb 16 1:58pm
We are doing pretty well
Feb 17 12:32pm
Day off too, not bad.
Feb 17 12:33pm
Everyone off?
Feb 17 12:33pm
Need to get to work on cleaning up the kitchen...took [[AG]] for a driving lesson (am shakey but ok)
Feb 17 12:33pm
No [[UJ]] had school â€”make up for a snow day
Feb 17 12:33pm
Ah, snap.
Feb 17 12:34pm
Well, I'm glad she had her lesson. Sorry [[UJ]] wasn't able to take her.
Feb 17 12:34pm
They had one lesson together in the mustang
Feb 17 12:34pm
Perfect car for lessons. Peel out, peel out, peel...!1! Fun car.
Feb 17 12:35pm
(I can't imagine [[AG]] doing that)
Feb 17 12:36pm
He was anxious and a bit yelly when she drove into the grass
Feb 17 12:37pm
Gotta be nerve-wracking
Feb 17 12:43pm

Feb 18 1:13pm
Beep boop
Feb 18 1:13pm
Principal is mad at me for skipping â€”ah well
Feb 18 1:14pm
lol, ah well
Feb 18 1:14pm
Sigh â€”no reason for me to be there and others miss often
Feb 18 1:14pm
Ah well
Feb 18 1:14pm
I hope your day is twice as delicious or useful. Not fun to be in that spot sometimes.
Feb 18 1:15pm
Yep itâ€™s gonna be ok ðŸ˜Š
Feb 18 1:15pm
How are [[AG]] and [[UJ]] doing?
Feb 18 1:16pm
Good good
Feb 18 1:16pm
Climbing out of the hole I was in yesterday....how are you today
Feb 19 1:37pm
I hear that. Hopefully, it's not a painful climb.
Feb 19 1:39pm
I'm doing okay. I've got a lot on the mind, and I should be writing and reading. Trying to keep the ball rolling with my offspring too, slowly oscillating (I hope) back into a groove.
Feb 19 1:39pm
You doing alright?
Feb 19 1:40pm
As long as I am agile enough to keep my head up and at the same time avoid the principal until she forgets she is mad at me â€”laying low
Feb 19 1:40pm
Lol
Feb 19 1:40pm
