title: 2017.03.31 - Pipefitting Log

Today was short but productive. I studied for the test. Took it. Made a 100. I was not expecting to do well considering how Chris didn't do well. I studied more than he did for this one, I think. 

Afterward, I was told to go tack weld for Ferguson on his socket weld project (I've been dying to start socket welds for weeks). Ferguson is quite odd, definitely has Aspergers (has the classic facial structure of it too, imho). His ability spatial reasoning is actually fairly impressive in some respects (he can mentally rotate the assembly fairly effectively, although he is not efficient about how often he must do it). We both fit the pieces, and I tacked.

As to tacking, I need to keep higher heat, 75ish on the carbon steel pipe. It's hard to strike the arc otherwise. The tacks looked decent enough (most of them looked better than what Ferguson and Harold had done [they've been at this for 3-4 months). I will be excellent at it with another day of practice (I had about an hour's worth today, but most of it wasn't even tacking). I will probably fling the red ember off the tip from now on. It does make it easier to strike the arc again. I'm used to burning whole rods, and I rarely have to restart. Constantly tacking requires efficiently making multiple uses of the same rod. Also, don't forget to strike horizontally, and keep yourself in a comfortable 2-handed position. Find out how to do that in all cases, positions, angles, etc.

I can see that socket weld will be fairly easy. Screwpipe concepts transfer very well. I found the takeouts part of my book for it. Cutting the pipe will be even simpler than screwpipe since we get to use the wonderful bandsaw. There seem to be two tricky parts to socket welds from what I can see. 

The first is making sure your pieces are in good shape (we recycle everything). There's so much leftover slag and weld stuck on the fittings (and pipe to a lesser extent). It is angle-grinder and even die-grinder central. Of course, this just boils down to being systematic in our gathering and preparation of materials (which I'm good at). I'll eventually have Nash do this part after I've mastered it since it is clearly bitchwork. I've done the same on screwpipe. Since I have a competitive advantage in everything compared to Nash, I should work on those tasks in which I have the highest degree of competitive advantage over him. It's the most efficient use of our time. The fact is that I perform the actual planning and fitting to a much greater degree than Nash when compared to our performances of menial labor tasks.

So, for our projects, one person will grab and prepare the fittings and flanges. Another will grab and cut the pipe. The pipe can definitely make use of two people, even though it can be done by one. Eventually, we will all need to grind the last 1.5-2 inches of each end of each pipe (probably going to be a 2-person max kind of thing given our space). Label (although, this should be done at cutting time), double check, and start building. 

The second trick is making sure that everything is level. Here screwpipe concepts don't appear to transfer as well, and this is apparently where I will eventually learn to love socket welds so much more than screwpipe. There's definitely a lot less heavy lifting work to be done, from what I can tell. For now, we would fit and level/plumb, tack once, check it/bend it, tack on the other side, check it/bend it (and sometimes rotate the assembly to do it again), then make the final tacks. If we fail, then we have to grind the tacks off and do it again. That's a waste of time. Being level is key. Putting the fittings on correctly is tough. You have to literally put the levels straight on the fittings. I do not get to rely so heavily upon having the secondary/tertiary pipes fitted to finalize my level as I do with screwpipe. I am told that buttwelds are even easier, and I can kind of see it (once someone is truly careful in their initially fitting), as there is so much wiggle room in socket welds. 

Also, I was told not to fit entirely into the back of the fitting, but leave a 1/8th of an inch space. I assume this is for heat expansion reasons and perhaps to give more options while fitting.

It will take some practice get the correct process flow down for it. I will streamline that sumbitch before too long though, I guarantee it.

Another noteworthy consideration: tacking requires having multiple people. Traditionally, the fitter "fits" the pipe and holds it while the welder tacks it. Since I'm going to be a craftsman, I will see if I can learn to do it by myself. That would be a truly useful thing to learn. I have read about alignment dogs and other tools which hold pipes in place, but we have none in the shop. It will be a place to be creative, experimental, and thoughtful.

My teacher brought me into his office before lunch. He told me that he's never had students like Chris and me before who smash through the computer and book tests  (and, from what I gather, he's never had anyone complete the shop work at the pace we do, even though he has had actual pipefitter apprentices in his class before). It is conceivable that we will finish the 1st pipefitter book (the book after the core book) by the end of the first trimester. We are hot on the heels of the class before us. I anticipate catching up to them within a month or two. When we do catch up, I hope I won't be slowed down by them. I don't want to hold their hands and babysit. I'm going to grab Chris and make sure he is my permanent partner in this class. Your partners matter a ton. I expect this is true almost everywhere and nearly always. 

Anyways, so in his office, he told me that since we're moving so quickly through the course, he's decided to offer an "elective" portion of the course. Essentially, he wants to give us the option to do the 3rd NCCER pipefitter book (these are fairly expensive, and the school will pay for it). I think this is a great idea, and I told him so. I believe I will very quickly master the two forms of fitting I've yet to learn, and even with side projects and additional tools to learn, I will have more time on my hands than I know what to do with. The 3rd NCCER book and welding should keep me busy.

Honestly, it would be sick if I could finish the entire NCCER pipefitter's certification in less than a year. That's probably dreaming though. I'll do what I can, eh? I think I need to ask for the study points in advance of our time off in April. I want to cover 1-test a day in my week off. That's totally doable. It would be great to come back and have a test-taking day. Jumping ahead half a book or more would be a worthwhile use of my time off. 

It is clear to me that I have much to learn. I'm smashing through the easy beginner stuff, but the world of pipefitting is still quite large (not as large as Philosophy by any stretch), especially when you take up the adjacent fields. 

We talked about the history of pipefitting and how little it has changed over the years. I think that is fascinating. I have to say, I'm kind of pleased to be in a field that isn't likely to make huge transformations. I like learning things that will last me for a long time. It is one of the problems I have with applied computer science.
