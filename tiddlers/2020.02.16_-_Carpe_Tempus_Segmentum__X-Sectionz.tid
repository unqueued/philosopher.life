title: 2020.02.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: X-Sectionz

* Woke at 9:30
** Felt fine.
* Meditation, vits, coffeebliss
* Hugs and talking
* Offspring on tasks
* Fireman Time!
* Chats
* Family Time!
** Too cold to walk. The joke, ofc, is that the house is also too cold to be in. 
*** Dad's science experiment is bad. Real bad.
** [[Family Log]]
*** Mass discussions for hours.
**** Yeah, using the log as the catalyst is correct.
**** Best part of the day, not even close.
** One-on-ones
*** Made gloves with daughter as well. Son is not interested.
** Tacos
* //Battlestar Galactica//
* Wikis
** [[X-Section]] on my offspring's wikis were invaluable. Comparing ourselves to ourselves was awesome. 
*** Going for a "This Week Last Year" approach. 
**** Also, hoping to see [[Review]]s and something which demonstrates they've at least looked at the [[X-Section]] each day. 
*** My favorite part is that I'm in a position to show progress real-time and argue about it.
** My son is cursed with my inabilities, my daughter blessed with my wife's abilities. Pretty unfair, lol. 
** [[A History of Western Philosophy]] + Audio and a college lit book (focusing on short stories, poems, plays, essays) for my daughter. 
*** Let's hope she will try. Philosophy is her idea. I hope she digests and researches. Going slowly through that book and searching everything, hopefully forming an opinion, would be an incredible walkthrough. Not getting my hopes up. 
** [[The Hobbit]], audio, and some Prothero books on comparative religion for my son.
*** Seems a bit poli-sci, economicsed out? That's the direction he wants to go. Hope he does.
** Both have made the case for Khan because they just want mastery now. Let's see if they run with it.
* wiki-git wasn't in backups...fixed. 
** P2P connections should be coming up again. <3 u, RAM.
* Working on Windoze and the router.
* Read+Write
* Caught up way too late trying out an obscene amount of filesharing software. Trying to resurrect some pieces. I'm sad to see how many good ideas just died. =/ Some blood, sweat, and tears in some of this software.
** I'm even sadder to see that so little fucking progress has been made. This software is really complex to build well. It can't be done by one person. 
** `/salute` to the pioneers who saw the goal which so many today don't even realize.
* Sleep by 4. Lol.
