!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Referring to your employees as "family" is the corporate equivalent of telling a prostitute "you love her."
<<<

That is a clever claim.

The vast majority of sex workers are woefully under-protected. I am disgusted by how people treat sex workers. Most sex workers I've met merit the hedge and charity we all owe to widows, orphans, and aliens. I also don't have a conceptual moral problem with prostitution; in fact, I am in favor of state-sponsored prostitution for those in need. Like any slavery, of course, I have a moral problem when people are forced into sexual slavery, even if only indirectly because of the ways in which society is shaped. I am also [[redpill]]ed enough to agree to the claim that sexual market mating games often boil down to versions of prostitution (there is a great deal to say here). 

I appreciate how employees and prostitutes can be compared. We must be especially careful in top-down power dynamics. How you treat those over whom you have power profoundly defines you. Corporate manipulation, in this case, is disgusting. I've yet to see an instance that wasn't manipulation either. Milligan College does this a lot.

I am not quite sure if most johns who say "I love you" to a prostitute are trying to be manipulative. Surely some are, and surely some aren't. When I go in for analysis, part of the silliness of the joke isn't funny to me. The comparison isn't parallel enough.
