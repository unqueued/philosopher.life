title: 2020.03.26 - Wiki Review: Infiltration

* [[2020.03.25 - Wiki Review: Godbless The Rona QuaranTiktok Extravaganza Summoning The Tim & Eric Cthulhu]]
** This is one aspect of fraidycat's evolution I like: it takes Tiktok seriously. Mind you, I've never seen a Tiktok that is critical all by itself, but the collection has a non-trivial value. Even the performance is worthwhile, and it's my window into [[The Great Human Conversation]] right now that I'd otherwise not see in my other hyperreading. They are obviously trying to maintain their walls, and he's infiltrating.

** Yeah, I'm going to keep breaking the rules until a cop tells me to fuck off. I shall plead ignorance.

** I'm afraid that I don't understand what my brother adores about it. It's not that it's not well done. It is. It's funny too. It's not picking out what matters enough to me.
* [[2020.03.25 - Prompted Introspection: Reacting]]
** Completed. Obviously, I need to continue working on this question. I am not useful enough to people.

** This is fantastic. I'm grateful.
** I don't mean to offend [[AF]], but I still take [[DeathOfRobinhood]]'s point of view more seriously. Perhaps it's just because I know him so much better, or we share more interests, or something. 
*** Of course, it doesn't matter what I think here. My daughter makes all the decisions. I'm an advisor if she wants it, and probably more just her chauffeur otherwise.
* [[2020.03.25 - h0p3ful Review: Those Things]]
** The syncing just isn't important enough. We can do it by hand until it starts to break our backs.
* [[Animal Consciousness]]
** Laughably incomplete even for initial notes. I didn't focus enough. 
*** Be a better rolemodel, dude.

** He's doing a better job, and I'm grateful that he's embracing his morning more than usual.
