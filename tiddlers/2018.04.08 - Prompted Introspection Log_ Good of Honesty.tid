title: 2018.04.08 - Prompted Introspection Log: Good of Honesty

!! Why would it be good to be honest?

Define [[The Good]]. Good for what, in which context, given what standard ([[gfwiwcgws]])? It's not easy. Honesty is also a complex ethical notion. I don't feel like trying to generate justified explanations, and I'm not sure I could in this space in the first place. Honesty requires using the right kinds of epistemic axioms, and it often entails being motivated [[irwartfrr]].

Obviously, honesty can serve different accounts of [[The Good]]. Generally-speaking, I think honesty is key to respecting the dignity of persons and engaging in effectively philosophy. There is a humility in honesty that requires us to recognize that we aren't the center of reality, that we are fallible, that we have much to learn, and that others are in the same position.
