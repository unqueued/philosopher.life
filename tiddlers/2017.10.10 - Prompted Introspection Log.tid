!! What do you think about VR gaming?

I thought I wouldn't be taken in by it even more than I have. I am very rarely blown away for very long by fancy graphics. The games I love most are ultimately found in their mechanics. But, VR //is// a mechanic, a profound one. This is clearly a goal for our family. We need to work towards VR. 

That vision of us living our lives in VR but not with each other seems to be more real each day. We need to fight such forces in our lives. This is tricky. Maybe we should stick to having a daily family time as well. One hour that we set aside with and for each other. This is only going to get harder. We have to try and establish the connective order while we still can. Eventually, we won't be able to, most likely.
