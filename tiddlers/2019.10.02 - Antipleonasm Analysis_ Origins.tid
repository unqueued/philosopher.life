!! Respond to the following gem:

[A] great embarrassing fact...haunts all attempts to represent the market as the highest form of human freedom: that historically, impersonal, commercial markets originate in theft.

It's true, and it's more than embarrassing. This is a classic argument against Nozick's take on Locke and Libertarianism, which I generally find to be the deontic strain of capitalism which sits underneath the acclaimed utilitarian arguments riding on the assumption of unbreakable psychological egoism. You can't call such markets "legitimate transfer" on Libertarian grounds if supposed "legitimate acquisition" was actually illegitimate transfer (which likely borders on being hypocritical given his patterned justice critique). Freedom, however, is not the objective; it's justified freedom! We're not here to talk about //mere// freedom; it's justice that we're after. 

Capitalists aren't interested in the facts unadulterated, of course. Their egoism has psychopathically filtered out what is objectively [[salient]] for what fits their subjective desires.
