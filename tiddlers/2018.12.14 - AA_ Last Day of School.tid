title: 2018.12.14 - AA: Last Day of School

```
Last day of school....
FRI 11:18 AM
\o/
FRI 11:18 AM
And I have created a video game room...
FRI 11:18 AM
I think school ends next Wednesday forme.
FRI 11:19 AM
Three switches and two projectors —multiplayer mario games
FRI 11:19 AM
Lol!
FRI 11:19 AM
Your students must adore you.
FRI 11:19 AM
I struggle with the lack of organized things to do...
FRI 11:19 AM
I, uh, am probably going to be experiencing that significantly here soon.
FRI 11:20 AM
Not looking forward to the vertigo of it.
FRI 11:20 AM
Will plan in the wiki as best I can.
FRI 11:20 AM
I can't do that, but I will look for things like that.
FRI 11:20 AM
I am basically the lowest on the totem pole, a glorified babysitter.
FRI 11:20 AM
At least this keeps them busy...my autistic guy keeps telling the others they suck (it’s true but not tactful —makes me laugh)
FRI 11:21 AM
rofl
FRI 11:21 AM
Maybe he's my hero. =)
FRI 11:21 AM
Yeah but the stuff you can offer those kids is awesome
FRI 11:21 AM
Indeed. I think I can be a different figure in their lives.
FRI 11:22 AM
It may open their eyes and give them opportunities they hadn’t thought of...one adult that cares enough to invest can turn things around
FRI 11:32 AM
I agree that does occur. I think it is rare. Still, even if I only reach 3%, I will be pleased.
FRI 11:34 AM
It is rare but 3% would be great. Worth trying regardless of slim returns
FRI 12:17 PM
Currently, I think the best I can do is just listen. Will take a while to figure out how I can be directly useful to them.
FRI 5:21 PM
I probably don’t listen enough...
FRI 6:05 PM
The task...gotta make sure we do such and such...
FRI 6:06 PM
Listening would be an excellent start
FRI 6:06 PM
