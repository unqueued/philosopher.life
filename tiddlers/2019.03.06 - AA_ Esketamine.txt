We can't even get standard migraine meds through our insurance.
WED 1:17 PM
They dictate whether or not I can afford that.
WED 1:17 PM
Yeah I caught that while I was browsing
WED 1:17 PM
Bleh Insurance sucks

Even with appeals from us and doctors, it's been a no go.

I've been meaning to take some recently.

They are picky about my diabetic drugs —I often have to change because they decide not to cover something I have taken for years
WED 1:21 PM
I know almost nothing about diabetic drugs. Do you experience any differences? Do you ever have to go without?
WED 1:23 PM
Um the difficult part is that they won’t tell you what the will cover
WED 1:25 PM
Super annoying.

A black box that you have to brute force test.

So the pharmacist tells you, it is gonna be $500 —it’s hard to find a substitute they will cover

I have had help from Peter Johnson since he is diabetic too and on the same insurance—otherwise its hit or miss

People are dying so others can make money.

Same with [[AG]]’s adhd meds —some dosages they won’t cover because it’s not available in generic but they don’t tell you that
WED 1:27 PM
I get that research is expensive and insurance wants to make big bucks but it shouldn’t be at the cost of people’s lives
WED 1:28 PM
Aye. It's pretty damning. =(
