*** I rarely see social scientists doing philosophy well. This was a good step. There are many fundamental problems here, of course. But, look at the subject.
*** The Hobbesian freedom issue shows up. I think this person hasn't teased apart the various kinds of freedom/autonomy well enough. That's okay though.

*** Ah, doing economics in a mathematical vacuum again. You still don't see it. Listen to the virtuous agent when he tells you that your codification fails. This will be wielded as a justification for great evil.

*** Oh look, someone thinks he's not responsible for the beast he helped create. Fuck you. You deserve to be slaughtered with the rest of them.

*** What a load of shit from TheATL! You mean: they can't find employees who will work under poor conditions and low pay, employees who will submit to long-term abuse, exploitation, etc.
*** Glossing through the author's body of work, I can see her bias.
*** Look, I agree to many points, but you are truly missing the boat.

*** Protesters are going to risk brain damage from now on. This is a way of killing people indirectly. Jesus. Breathtaking evil in most of you.

*** Yeah. Still nothing. =( Atropos/Outopos looks necessary. You all are not worried nearly enough. This is the time to fucking panic, right now! I've seen us in freefall for over a decade. When are you going to come to your senses? Ah, you won't. We really are boned.

*** Hrmmm...I think Dark Triadicism is radically different from Depression. You've missed the point. This is weird.

*** Nothing new is said. It is obvious that completely rebuilding infrastructure from the ground up is the only answer. We need a radical shift for environmental and logistical/economical reasons. We must decentralize power. This article misses the boat, and I don't think that's an accident.

*** I think the link between racism and classism requires more thought than was displayed here. They have an agenda, and it is not altruistic.
