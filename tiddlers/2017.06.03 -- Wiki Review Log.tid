title: 2017.06.03 -- Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.06.02 -- Philosophy Probe Log]]
** Edited.
* [[Life Hacks & Pro Tips Collection]]
** I wish I started collecting these a long time ago.
* [[2017.06.02 -- Prompted Introspection Log]]
** I think I'd like to more of these picture prompts. I prefer to do language analysis in my [[Philosophy Probe Log]]. 
* [[Embed a Picture on Tiddlywiki]]
** Slowly collecting more and more code snippets. 
* [[2017.06.02 -- Link Log]]
** My reading often doesn't make me happy, at least not in the short term. Avoiding the pitfalls and derealization that I associate with being uneducated, ignorant, and brainwashed is worth the long-term happiness though.
* [[2017.06.02 -- Diet Log]]
** Edited and summed.
* [[Everquest]]
** Edited.
** May I be wise with my time.
* [[2017.06.02 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** I will revamp my {Focus} section today. I clearly need to.
* [[2017.06.02 -- Pipefitting Log]]
** I like the work I've done in this log. I need to be more proactive, executive, and planning-oriented. Unfortunately it seems like there is a real split in the styles of thinking I engage in here. One is about pipefitting directly, and the other is about the social, economic, and political ramifications and aspects of my job. Perhaps I should split them? In any case, both require serious and consistent work on my part.
* [[ARAM: Soraka]]
** Filled it out. I hope to be done with these so I can be left tweaking.
