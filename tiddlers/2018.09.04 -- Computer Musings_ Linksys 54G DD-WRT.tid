title: 2018.09.04 -- Computer Musings: Linksys 54G DD-WRT

I always check the electronics of thrift stores. I've picked up two Linksys routers for DD-WRT over the years. I'm glad we had them available. My daughter tested them both out. We're using high-gain antennae on top of our Ubiquiti AP. No 5Ghz sadly (which I was coming to enjoy). 

My daughter is in charge of it, but she clearly needed some hints, instructions, guidance. She's feeling lost.

Kali, long time, no see. Want to show my daughter a couple things.

HTPC crontab for rsync of wiki from resilio sync to dropbox had to be added. Whoops.
