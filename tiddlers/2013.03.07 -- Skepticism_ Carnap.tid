title: 2013.03.07 -- Skepticism: Carnap

The empirical verifiability principle of meaningfulness is the doctrine that a sentence is meaningful if and only if it is verifiable or falsifiable at least to some degree, and the confirmation of disconfirmation ultimately comes from sense-experience.

Meaninglessness = incapable of truth of falsity

Verifiability principle views skepticism as meaningless (as well as transc. Idealism)

Carnap accepts “conditional correctness’ of skepticism; if there are meaningful questions about the knowledge of the word, skepticism is correct

VP (verifiability principle) is deflationary



Two ingredients to knowledge: the experience on which it is based, the linguistic framework in terms of which we understand that experience.
