This scene is a crucial one in the series. It is my contention that Draper is a demonstration of the convenient [[Will to Power]] which selectively denies our identities. It's Ribbonfarm-esque. Draper is a master liar, especially to himself. The ending is just another clear example of this principle. It's Zen psychopathy. 

Erase your memory at just the right points to maintain your hedonic treadmill and believe you are still a good (enough) person. The ability to deny your identity to various [[dok]] is the ability to rationalize your way into any algorithm, deny your moral obligations, to deny your witness, and simply push a button and act like you are playing another existential game (as though you erased the past to some [[dok]]).<<ref "f">>

It's fascinating to see that it still catches up with Draper in his own mind from time to time, and he must actively suppress it. I think you can shape yourself to do this. This is yet another example of how the non-cognitivism of virtue theory is so easily twisted into a monstrous egoism (it's an odd experience to speak with these ~~philosophers~~ hedonists who have deluded themselves).

I hold you fuckers responsible for who you are to the [[dok]] you are responsible (to the best of my knowledge).
