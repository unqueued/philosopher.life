 It's meme like this that keep me coming back to Facebook. Hahah

 What do you think about that meme?

 So its making fun of nike and their kapernick advertisement. Which has taken conservatives by storm. Which in it of itself is humorous. And the internet is overrun with bad memes about just do it. But this funny on more than one level. I like sanders. He has consistently stood for what he believes. From civil rights to modern wage gap.

 Makes sense.

 I agree it's funny too. I just wanted to understand what you thought was funny about it.

 It's a basic joke on his campaign of expanding social programs at the expense of the taxpayer. Nothing more.

 This is one of the problems with irony and parody. It can dogwhistle or satisfy the worldviews of multiple people at once. Reminds me of conservatives who took The Colbert Report at face value, or hatewatching Bill O'Reilly, etc.

 That would keep me coming back to FB too. I think it's why I've regularly stopped to read 4chan since we were in college. Voat is another one of those interesting places.

 I was annoyed by the kneeling of the NFL players. But I don't even watch football. I was more annoyed at the general publics correlation to how his kneeling means he didn't support our military or he hated America. Southpark did an episode on it. It was flipping halarious. But everything Southpark does, is.

 So if you can do computer programing, what about cell phone apps?

 I really don't like my phone.

 It's not designed for me to have control of it

 (quite the opposite)

 I've had smart phones since they came out, but I've always hated them.

 The options are really limited.

 So, I can program CLI tools in Termux on Android (and I'm sure iOS has something like it).
5 hours ago
 I program applications built by other people more than writing my own software for it.
5 hours ago
 Although, I've written software that runs on Android, I've not made anything useful.

 I build my computing life around my Desktop/Laptop as much as possible.

 I ask, because I have a small handful of million dollar applications/ideas that I think could be profitable. I will have to run them by you sometime.

 neat =)

 I have a sweet desktop, but I find I'm on my phone 90â€° of the time.

 I do not know how you do it. I know that is very normal.

 I regularly have 300-500 tabs open across several firefox windows in a workspace just for my link log (https://philosopher.life/#Link%20Log:%5B%5BLink%20Log%5D%5D). I can't surf the internet on a phone, no matter how much I attempt to streamline the process.

 Facebook offered the snap hat creators $3billion and he turned it down. They reared the app in college...

 I don't even use a mouse most of the time at this point; I have to navigate by keyboard.

 Good gracious. That's too many windows. That's insane.

 I read a lot.

 I get anxiety if I have double digits. Haha

 I have app ideas, btw.

 I just don't think that I want to build a tool only for a phone; I'd want a tool that stretches across all the ecosystems

 some of my favorite software is usable across every major platform

 I can't say I'm really interested in money in the end. I have different goals.

 Haha.

 I understand one must work to live.

 I think even once you retire, you should still have a valuable work. It's vocation.

 I don't disagree. Maybe something that doesn't require me to get up at 4am! Hah.

 I can agree to that too. =)

 I should point out another thing for apps: my thesis and dissertation were wholesale attacks on intellectual property (against Lockean/Kantian and Utilitarian arguments of it).  https://www.fsf.org/ is about where I'm at. Even my wiki is public domain.

 Free and Open Source software or bust for me. I did write software at Humana. It was fun, but as I said, it was evil.
