title: 2018.01.30 - Wiki Audit Log: Yearly Log Audits

!! SO:<<ref "2019.03.26">>

* Apparently, in my infinite wisdom, I didn't actually audit my logs for the year. Brilliant post-mortem!
* I begin that process now. I see that I'm coming up on my next monthly audit (for the new year)

!! FO:

* [[2017 - To-Do-List Log]]
** [[To-Do-List Log]] has been revamped. Now that I've completed my audit, I have a clearer understanding of what I'm trying to accomplish and how I can get there.
* [[2017 - Carpe Diem Log]]
** Finished most of it.
