title: 2018.02.23 -- Deep Reading Log: The Shining

Jesus. The characters are dark, and outside of the supernatural elements, the realism is strong to the point of being painful. King does not shy away from showing the fundamental evil embedded in us all. It's graphic. I don't like horror. =(

I think part of what is painful about this book for me is that I empathize with Jack, and he reminds me of how much of a failure I am.

The book is agonizingly slow.
