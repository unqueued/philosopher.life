!! Audit:

* And...survey says: you are addicted to wow, you are a nightowl, and you masturbate a lot. Surprise!
* This log captures way less when I'm thrown into my game.
* I'm so disappointed by both our landlord and ISP (and the people of the world who think we should allow such things).
* Okay, you have been meditating a lot. I have no idea if it has done any good or not, but I enjoy it.
* Not much cannabliss and alcohol when I've got WoW.
** But, plenty of coffee. I've also been in a dark chocolate mood.
* Dreams have been fucking insane. It's a sign I'm in the zone.
* It was wonderful having [[gh057]] and his wife over. It was an honor.
* Dialectures have slimmed down, and frankly, I think your children's schoolwork is suffering.
** They've also been staying up late too. We just caught them with laptops and phones last night at 1am in bed. Jesus Christ.
* You need to shower more.
* I know you've not been exercising enough either. 
* BCS dropped off the map. 
** Maybe I shouldn't game. My wife decides.
* It's been a blistering pace in WoW. =)
