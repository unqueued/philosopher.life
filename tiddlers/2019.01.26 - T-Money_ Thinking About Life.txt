So a friend from aviation maintenance school. Is trying to. Help me get a job at UPS in Louisville ky. It is a union job reaching top out pay of $56 an hour projected to go up to $65. Top out pay is reached in year six. Healthcare is 100% paid for and does not come out of check.
SAT 9:13 AM
In order to do this I would have to rent a room, an apartment, or use my camper to work until I reached top out pay. Then I would. Be making enough $ Kathy would not have to work. And she could move closer to her PARENTS. but by that time. Samantha will be in HS. I doubt she will want to change high schools.
SAT 9:15 AM
This goes against the idea of moving towards a simpler life with more free time for family. It is the exact opposite. I would spend more time away from my family. In order to better provide and ensure a pension
SAT 9:16 AM
What's most important to provide?
SAT 10:18 AM
Our current yearly income is less than $50k a year. I suggest even $30 an hour at full time is enough to live on in Louisville. My brother makes those wages.
SAT 10:19 AM
I make nearly $30 an hour now but commute 180 miles a day and spend like $12k on healthy insurance out of. My pay.
SAT 10:20 AM
Sometimes. I hate life decisions. =)
SAT 10:21 AM
What is the starting pay at that job?
SAT 10:21 AM
Starting is $21 but again zero dollars paid to heath insurance. So our take home pay is the same.
SAT 10:22 AM
But at year six I reach six figures.
SAT 10:22 AM
And then Kathy would. Never have to work again. And I could. Potentially retire early.
SAT 10:22 AM
Or pay off all debt now, semi retire now and just leave cheaper.
SAT 10:23 AM
Live*
SAT 10:23 AM
I would be impressed if you could retire early. Most will never be able to retire, imho.
SAT 10:23 AM
I'm sure you have done the math.
SAT 10:24 AM
Imho, you don't have to top out before everyone moves up there.
SAT 10:24 AM
you can get 3 - 13 shifts. which means i am only there 3 nights a week. of course i would be on night shift for the next decade. But it might be more benificial for the girls to stay in somerset, and I purchase a home, and rent the rooms out to fellow mechanics.
SAT 4:27 PM
essentially, rent out a crash pad.
SAT 4:27 PM
which would pay the mortage and build equity without me paying for it.
SAT 4:27 PM
and then if im only working 3 nights a week I am home 4 days a week.
SAT 4:28 PM
Rent-seeking is quite effective in our economy
SAT 4:28 PM
it is a frustrating delimia. I really just want to be home more. but I have incrediable obligations to provide.
SAT 4:31 PM
I know that pain. =(
SAT 4:32 PM
whatcha gonna do... i generally have faith that what will be, will be. and that decision i ultimently make will be, the best decision at that time... the future is unknown, and will change. and i will have to change with it.
SAT 4:32 PM
I can't say I agree.
SAT 4:33 PM
(asshole philosopher, as usual, lol)
SAT 4:33 PM
haha. i had no idea. what will be- will be. was a phrase that someone could disagree with?
SAT 4:34 PM
It depends on how you interpret that claim.
SAT 4:34 PM
that was a wrap up BS statement.
SAT 4:34 PM
Cool beans, I hear ya.
SAT 4:35 PM
i did not mean to dimish your disagreement. i was just stating my original intent.
SAT 4:36 PM
Lol, it's fine. I appreciate the desire to be stoic about what is not in your control.
SAT 4:37 PM
I think that's where you are really going.
SAT 4:37 PM
i often feel, as of recent, i explain, rant, bitch, and complain to your ear and feel that if done in excess is unfair to you. im more ways than one.
SAT 4:38 PM
and yes, i try to concentrate on what is inside my small window of control.
SAT 4:38 PM
to many things outside of my control that cause intense anxiety. i attempt not to think of them unless forced to.
SAT 4:38 PM
like, when i read your wiki page.
SAT 4:38 PM
I appreciate that you take the time and energy to be open my point of view (which is often an unpleasant experience).
SAT 4:39 PM
:)
SAT 4:39 PM
lol
SAT 4:39 PM
I will also say I think far more is in our control than we usually want to admit. This is one of my areas of interest as a philosopher. I study autonomy.
SAT 4:39 PM
i am not only open, i respect you point of view.
SAT 4:39 PM
i hold it in high regard. there are few in this world that speak, write, text with a level of intelligence and deliberate than yourself.
SAT 4:40 PM
High praise, thank you.
SAT 4:40 PM
deliberate intent.
SAT 4:40 PM
i missed a word there.
SAT 4:41 PM
That is my life too.
SAT 4:41 PM
I think it is getting worse as I age.
SAT 4:41 PM
I'm so glad they not only have spellcheckers but even grammar checkers now.
SAT 4:41 PM
We're spoiled.
SAT 4:41 PM
indeed! and yes, thank you so much for the MS office hack for my laptop. works wonderfully.
SAT 4:42 PM
i never learned to spell. never had to except for primary school.
SAT 4:42 PM
then we got the internet. so by the time i started learning $5 words i didnt need to know how to spell them.
SAT 4:43 PM
i spell phonetically. and i have no shame.
SAT 4:43 PM
It works.
SAT 4:44 PM
the worst is when your country accent/ miss pronunciation of a word causes the spell check to not be able to understand what you are saying! then you have to google it! hahaha
SAT 4:44 PM
I know what you are saying too (or at least I know the words and I have the opportunity to think about them), and that's the important part to me.
SAT 4:44 PM
How are you today, and what are you up to?
SAT 4:47 PM
Also I have been meaning to ask. What currently daily "substance" do you take and how often or consistent?
SAT 4:47 PM
Doing well. Most coffee and alcohol during the weekdays. Cannabis edible (straight butter) once per day on Saturday and Sunday if I can: https://philosopher.life/#Hidden%3A%20Cannabutter%20Recipe
SAT 4:49 PM
DMT was unimpressive, but I'm not going to smoke it. I'm simply too sensitive to smoke.
SAT 4:49 PM
I should probably use ketamine; my depression has been weighing on me. My brother and wife have both asked me about it.
SAT 4:50 PM
I'm doing well enough. The wiki is by far the best indicator, ofc.
SAT 4:50 PM
My name showed up here: https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html
SAT 4:50 PM
Thinking about it.
SAT 4:50 PM
Wrote a letter to my daughter's new boyfriend: https://philosopher.life/#2019.01.22%20-%20j3d1h%3A%20Entity%3A%20First%20Contact
SAT 4:51 PM
I've got a lot of letters to write, and I want to get back to [[The Remodeling]]. I have quite a bit to do to whip my wiki into shape.
SAT 4:52 PM
I am impressed by your self discipline.
SAT 4:55 PM
I text you generally while in the middle of doing something. I am often so preoccupied that I have not time to read all of your wiki. As much as you woukd want some too. I apologize for my preoccupation and pure laziness.
SAT 4:57 PM

SAT 4:57 PM
Well, I hope you will read everything connected linked in your letter. It may take time to walk through the doorways, but I believe it will be a valuable use of our time.
SAT 4:58 PM
I can appreciate having limited time, ofc.
SAT 4:58 PM
Little badger. Single shot. .22 cal modified by me with 5. 50 cord, a bowie knife, magnesium striker.
SAT 4:58 PM
Looks like fun =)

SAT 4:59 PM
Original looks like this. It is a "survival rifle". Just a toy. Lots of guys mod them with all kinds of stuff. It also folds and goes into a small backpack. It is alot of fun to shoot. If you like shooting guns.
SAT 5:00 PM
I've shot before. It's fun. I like target practice. I've only ever owned one, and I've never shot it before.
SAT 5:02 PM
This is one place where I agree with my Libertarian enemies: "Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary"
SAT 5:02 PM
I am generally opposed to violence, but I have come to accept that most humans do not deserve to live (and actionably at that in particular circumstances).
SAT 5:03 PM
Ofc, even as a Christian, I took seriously "the wages of sin is death" and "vengeance is mine...says the lord"
SAT 5:05 PM
We are in yet another civil war, imho (a high tech, far more globalized kind). There are those in TN would who take my life if they knew what I believed.
SAT 5:07 PM
Lol. Yeah. There are some rough folks out there. I try to reach out to all and find common ground.
SAT 5:10 PM
I am not a master of bullshiting. But I'm pretty good.

New flood light installed on back porch. 200 watts equivalent in LED in back yard now. Looks like a landing strip.
SAT 10:06 PM

SAT 10:31 PM
Thanks. Lol. How I spend my Saturday nights. Lol.

First time. She did amazing. I am super instructor like with safety. And she obeyed all my instruction without question.

SAT 11:36 PM
I am also opposed to violence. And I will avoid even elevated disagreements or conflicts when I can. And I hope I never have to pull a weapon in self defense.
SAT 11:38 PM
But I am afraid of the masses. I need to protect my own as well as ensure a food supply if it comes to that.
SAT 11:39 PM
I can appreciate that.
SAT 11:40 PM
Even [[T42T]] enables violence (Jesus flipped tables and more)
SAT 11:40 PM
Namely due to injustices in money lending. If I remeber. Was the only time they mention him as a teenager. Approx 12 years old?
SAT 11:44 PM
Kind of.
SAT 11:45 PM
It had more to do with where those injustices were occurring.
SAT 11:46 PM
That the church had became a center for commerce was a core problem. It served the wrong master. Those in power (financially, politically, and religiously) practiced the moral law only in name (the letter of the law), but failed to practice the spirit of the law and pursue the center of God's Will is a more accurate and complete answer.
SAT 11:49 PM
To continue on the track, you have to remember that Christ came to fulfill the old testament laws and prophesies. The progressive revelation of "an eye for an eye" to "turn the other cheek" is the ethical and political mission (though not the salvific), and hence why it is stated as the second greatest commandment and is the core of his praxis.
SAT 11:51 PM
I knew it was a place of commerce but had forgotten that it was a Church. It was a biblical image that stuck with me.
