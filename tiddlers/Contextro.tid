//This Relic is a prototype which eventually gave birth to [[hlexicon]]. Ironically, this [[hlexical]] word had been forgotten and lost until [[The Remodeling]]'s archeological dig uncovered the narrative for me. While I may not use this word anymore, learning to grow comfortable making words up in this language game has been worth it. Good job, mate. `/salute`//
