title: 2018.01.10 - Retired: Thailand

Most of my writing was online. An enormous amount was lost to the sands of time and natural digital erosion. Outside of instant messaging/chat, http://4chan.com and http://mtgthesource.com were my primary hangouts. I wrote a lot on these sites. Between magic, the blooming of 4chan, and my heavily curated RSS feeds, I maintained a measure of sanity through yet another dark time in my life.  Hence, I only have a couple records left from this time period.

Moving to Thailand with two very young children was a leap I took. I knew I just couldn't accept living as a Christian in the West. In Thailand, I learned I couldn't accept living as a Christian anywhere. It took many years before I was able to escape the prison though. I'm a slow learner. 

I very much feel like I wasted my youth. I was given the wrong input from the beginning, and it sent me on a wild goose chase. Of course, every creature has a right to blame its creators (including themselves). Bitterness is fine as long as it fuels growth and leads to happiness, but at some point, it is spilled milk. I have to be stoic and worry about what I can control, which is the present and future.
