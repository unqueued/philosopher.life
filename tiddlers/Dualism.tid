title: Dualism

//Be brave and humble. Be prepared to fight anyone who aims to define or frame dialectics between ideality/reality or ontology/epistemology, which is everyone (whether they realize it or not). You are going to have to slit the throats of many STEMlords, reactionaries, egoistic materialists, and popular [reductionists, eliminativists, nominalists, etc.] along the way. This one is also for all the marbles; it is an ancient fundamental problem in philosophy for a reason. To my blind eyes, even if he's mistaken in his diaeresis, Saint Hegel is shooting lightning bolts out of his fingertips to show us the elephant's foot. Wise enlightenment recognizes that we do not transcend dualism, even if [[It]] does. This is a problem in ontology quietly couched and conveniently recast as a problem in philosophy of mind.//

Dualism makes the problem insoluble; materialism denies the existence of any phenomenon to study, and hence of any problem.

-- John R. Searle, //Consciousness and Language//

<<<
Substance thinking and substance extended are one and the same substance, comprehended now through one attribute, now through the other.

-- Saint Spinoza, //Ethics, Part 2, Prop. 7, Scholium//

If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms.

-- J. B. S. Haldane, //Possible Worlds//

<<<
Modern secular thought has its own dualism: It treats only the physical world as knowable and testable, while locking everything else - mind, spirit, morality, meaning - into the realm of private, subjective feelings. The so-called fact/value split.

-- Nancy Pearcey

<<<
All existence seemed to be based on duality, on contrast. Either one was a man or one was a woman, either a wanderer or sedentary burgher, either a thinking person or a feeling person-no one could breathe in at the same time as he breathed out, be a man as well as a woman, experience freedom as well as order, combine instinct and mind. One always had to pay for one with the loss of the other, and one thing was always just as important and desirable as the other. 

-- Hermann Hesse, //Narcissus and Goldmund//

We must no more ask whether the soul and body are one than ask whether the wax and the figure impressed on it are one.

-- Saint Aristotle

* Questions
** what is the relationship between mental properties and physical properties?
** Ontological questions
*** What are mental states and what are physical states? Is one class a subclass of the other, so that all mental states are physical, or vice versa? Or are mental states and physical states entirely distinct?
*** Causal questions 
**** Do physical states influence mental states? Do mental states influence physical states? If so, how?

* Definitions and Properties
** Dualist views say that the mental and the physical are both real and neither can be assimilated or reduced to the other.
** Types
*** Substance dualism: mind and matter are fundamentally distinct kinds of substances
**** Interactionism: mind and matter interact, though how?
**** Occasionalism: mind and matter never actually interact, merely an appearance.
**** Parallelism: a pre-established harmony such that it only seems as if physical and mental events cause, and are caused by, one another. In reality, mental causes only have mental effects and physical causes only have physical effects.
**** Epiphenomenalism:  all mental events are caused by a physical event and have no physical consequences. 
***** e.g. your thoughts are just by-products of the physical processes that really determine what you do, like the heat generated by your computer, and play no role in the explanation of your behavior
*** Property dualism (emergent materialism): ontological distinction lies in the differences between properties of mind and matter
*** Predicate dualism: irreducibility of mental predicates to physical predicates

* Motivations
** Qualia
*** Conscious mental events are private to the subject, who has privileged access to them of a kind no-one has to the physical.
*** What it is like to be conscious of and toward.
*** Acquisition of knowledge exclusive to conscious experience
*** Functional P-zombies are conceivable
** PoSR
** Metaphysics
** Idealism
** The Hard Problem, Irreducibility, Rationalist Priors and Limits of Empiricism
*** Even if we had //a// neural correlate for consciousness (which is not to say we'd know the structure of them all or what structures must or must not give rise to consciousness), we still would not know why a specific physical process leads to the occurrence of a specific phenomenal experience
*** Panpsychism assraping

* Opposition is The Norm
** Begging the question, neuroscientists implicitly accept a view that they explicitly reject dualism. Assumptions:
*** The mind is physical. (dualism rejected)
*** The part of the physical world that is sufficient for the mind is the brain or some suitable proper part of the central nervous system (Neural Chauvinism)
*** Helping themselves to components of dualism by postulating some intermediate thing-like entity that is not exactly a physical thing but has some allure of scientific respectability like information, coding, computation, maps, representations, and symbols without adding anything of value to the causal description of the world. But the intermediate entity is only an epistemic entity that makes no difference in the physical world and hence cannot provide the physical basis of consciousness/ The grounding "entities" are just epistemic fictions, "ontological promissory notes," that are never redeemed. In the absence of physicalist redemption, "ontological promissory notes" offer a dualistic picture/
