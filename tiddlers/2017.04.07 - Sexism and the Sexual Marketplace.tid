title: 2017.04.07 - Sexism and the Sexual Marketplace

The sexual marketplace is completely real. It's fundamental to the evolution of sexual creatures of all kinds on planet Earth. Seriously. We are animals.

Sexism is also completely real. Discriminatory practices against all sexes are profound, systemic, and even subconscious.<<ref "1">>

Sexism and the sexual marketplace are deeply connected. Competition for sexual value creates hostility. I see Libertarian assumptions (which aren't obviously the correct ones to take up) embedded in even the most leftist people I've seen when it comes to the sexual game (which, they refuse to acknowledge exists, but will talk about in other ways if you phrase the questions correctly). 

Sexism will only end when the sexual marketplace is dissolved. For instance, if we evolved (or technologically and sociologically evolved) to become asexual in practice, both in terms of how we derive physical and psychic pleasure (pair-bonding, social consequences, closeness, religiosity, etc. long associated with many instances of sex) and reproduction, sexism will cease to exist. Sex involves risks and costs in multiple domains. Remove them, and the world will be radically different. 

It may even possible that a long-term decrease in the risks and costs associated with the pursuit of the sexual marketplace would decrease sexism. That has systemic considerations and confounding factors which make it less obvious though. It seems like a reasonable possibility though. The less that sex is believed to be and used as a token of power, paired with lower STI and pregnancy rates (or costless abortions), the less influence it will have on power dynamics between human beings.

Give sex away. Make it easy to have sex. Lower the demand for sex. When you do, sexism will likely decrease.

One final caveat, it is possible that the human species has evolved to be innately sexist. Let us hope we are plastic enough to overcome such influence.

<<footnotes "1" "To be clear, this is not a discussion of gender as some social construct. They should swallow a few redpills to understand the very concept of what they are talking about. Gender forks into either complete relativism or are strongly tied to sex. In the former case, their discussion becomes irrelevant because it is relativistic, and in the latter, they would be conceding the very thesis they argue against. Of course, I have no problem with people pursuing the kinds of lives they want to lead, just in case they follow the basic moral law of empathy.">>
