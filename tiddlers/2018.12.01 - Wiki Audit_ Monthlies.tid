title: 2018.12.01 - Wiki Audit: Monthlies

$:/plugins/sphygmus/core/stylesheet/flex4h0p3 has been modified to keep the sidebar black and opaque for mobile. The goal is to make sure the rainbow doesn't overlap. I believe my brother was reading through my wiki in the doctor's office last night. It is a functional problem if you can't read the sidebar. It's basically mini-commandline on this wiki. I'd like to add, [[Sphygmus]]'s work is so beautiful. In fact, I watched the chess championship in a second window IN the Wiki Workspace, and that would not have been possible without her. 

Speaking of [[Sphygmus]], I have been giving more thought to her [[Auto-Wiki-Mator-Button]]. I have a billion things I'm trying to do (or it feels like it), but it is very clear to me that I want to integrate and develop what she has done very deeply; it should be a process on this wiki. In the end, I want specific buttons carefully designed for all the projects that matter to me. I want to be able to control my interface as well as she can control hers. The [[Wiki Audit: The Button Project]] is now in dreams. She has sent me on a path in the desert, and I hope to complete that vision. It's gorgeous and functional (I could offer no higher praise to something which partakes and instantiates both [[The Right]] and [[The Beautiful]]...that might just be [[The Good]]!).

~~I've decided that the work I'm doing in [[The Remodeling]] needs to be done in the monthly [[audit]]. I want to be able to catch up, and I want that behavior to be normal for me. Logs rarely require a great deal of work outside of grammar, cleaning up the formatting, perhaps some footnotes for semantic edits, and making sure it's tagged (already done in this case).~~

~~I had been considering doing this work in my [[Wiki Review]], but "a day later" just isn't appropriate for [[audit]] work. Admittedly, even a month might not be enough to disassociate. That said, I still intend to continue to the complete overhauls/re-reads.~~

No. This is not going to work. It just needs to be pure [[Wiki Audit]]. I need to disconnect completely before I clean up the mess. It may take longer, but that is okay. I can always write down my stopping point in [[The Remodeling]] and start there for mini remodeling or something.

The [[Monthly Auditable]]'s have been audited! That went by much faster than usual, but that may be because it was a Saturday. I basically had the whole day. Coffee helped too. =)

WTF happened to [[Highdeas Log]]? Why did that get deleted? It's not like I fully agree with it, but I still largely do. Was it an element of paranoia? Was it dislike? I make no note of it either. Wtf? Reinserted, timestamps are taken off in this case (first time ever?). I need a solid method for greping through my archives. It turned out to be a waste of time, I think, but that's okay. I should celebrate mistakes in this case. Not all of my projects and approaches work out, and I need to consistently remind myself of that fact.

I actually made some headway today in [[The Remodeling]] despite the mountain of other work I've done. Noice.
