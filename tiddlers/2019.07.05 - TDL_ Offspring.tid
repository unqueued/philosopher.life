* Drive my offspring.
** I think they are going to have a blast at [[JRE]]'s.
* Bring some bluetooth tooling for music, or finish that terrible book.
* I like that you are doing [[The Remodeling]] again. You wife is kicking butt too. Let's clean up while we can.
* Make sure we plan our remote family time. 
** Seems like the kids like Discord for this. 
* That chicken needs to be eaten. Couscous sounds good.
