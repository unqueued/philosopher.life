!! If all my wishes came true, I would......

Probably have another set of wishes I would want to come true. It's the fascinating aspect of utopia as the [[fff]], as we hurtle toward The Absolute, and the problem of desire satisfaction for us. We are not [[The Infinite]], and insofar as we experience intentionality in our [[phenomenology]], we are wishing for something. [[gfwiwcgws]]. 

Schopenhauer was mistaken in his hatred. On my heterodox reading, Hegel can offer an external reason which provides the basis for the internal desire-satisfaction problem at stake.
