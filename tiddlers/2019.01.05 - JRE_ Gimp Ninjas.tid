You need some of those pingpong balls so you can disappear when the TMNT show up. Where is shredder?
1 HR AGO
I see gimp, you see FOOT soldier

I tried sleeping in the long johns
1 HR AGO
Shredder Harkonnen.
1 HR AGO
Woke up to some super sweaty balls

1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
Gimp makes you think of dune, makes me think pulp fiction
1 HR AGO
Interestig
1 HR AGO
Trying to sound fruedian just looks like a spelling error
1 HR AGO
You aren't Pulp Fiction until you are taking that picture in the basement.
1 HR AGO
I saw that scene again recently
1 HR AGO
Went from shockingly taboo to just gross
1 HR AGO
The shock market got oversaturated
1 HR AGO
You sure about that? I'm sure we can find something to shock you.
1 HR AGO
I keep hearing about this beheading video of the hikers in morraco
1 HR AGO
Lol =) jk
1 HR AGO
Curious, but know it isnt good for me, so trying not to plug into that particular experience
1 HR AGO
Upped dose from 20mg to 40mg
1 HR AGO
Both make sense to me.
1 HR AGO
You feeling the difference?
1 HR AGO
Just a slightly stronger desire to randomly cry, but not any corresponding wave of sadness
1 HR AGO
Only on day 2 tho
1 HR AGO
Ah
1 HR AGO
I have no idea what that means. I am grateful to have the chance to cry.
1 HR AGO
Yeah, its a mixed bag for me.  I think the meds open me up to feeling stuff, which is bittersweet
1 HR AGO
Preach.
1 HR AGO
God hates gay people!
1 HR AGO
lol
1 HR AGO
Give us money for our propaganda efforts
1 HR AGO
/cry
1 HR AGO

=)
1 HR AGO
Im hungry
1 HR AGO
Amen.
1 HR AGO
I have lamb korma in the fridge
1 HR AGO
6 levels of spicy, i go for 6
1 HR AGO
Asked the indian fella what level he eats, he said 3 or 4.
1 HR AGO
Spice addiction is real.
1 HR AGO
Show that pansy who's boss.
1 HR AGO
Now you are making me hungry.
1 HR AGO
Said he used to eat hotter than 6 in india, but after 5 years in us, he has developed a mucus problem when he eats hot stuff
1 HR AGO
That is extra appetizing.
1 HR AGO
Did he show what he meant by that?
1 HR AGO
"My throat just gets full of mucus. So much mucus.  Is your food good?"
1 HR AGO
Mmmmm....mucus.
1 HR AGO
I do hope that [[k0sh3k]] one day needs all of my mucus. Loves my mucus. Begs for it.
1 HR AGO
Nah, i didnt offer to share my spicy food, and he wasnt chortling a chode, so no mucus
1 HR AGO
Ugh
1 HR AGO
I went from hungry to not in record time
1 HR AGO
lol
1 HR AGO
Huzzah
1 HR AGO
New diet
1 HR AGO
The Mucus Diet
1 HR AGO
Just read that text before each meal
1 HR AGO
I'm Mucus ?[[MWF]]?, I'll be your Mucus Gimp Ninja today; who is the birthday boy?
1 HR AGO
Homework idea :Get your daughter to use photoshop to design the cover of the best selling dieting book
1 HR AGO
Prison mike's much less popular brother
1 HR AGO
lol
1 HR AGO
I try to have as little influence on how she constructs her art as possible. I cheer her on, but I want that space to be her's as much as I can. I have made requests though.
1 HR AGO
Maybe she would benefit from guided assignments in art the same way she has in coding
1 HR AGO
Aye.
1 HR AGO
Following curriculum would do her good.
1 HR AGO
Art is completely an elective for her. I have to pick my battles, and everything else is already at war. I can't afford to spend my social capital with her on this point.
1 HR AGO
God, sitting around in all this stuff was comfortable, but pacing while i text means im sweating...
1 HR AGO
lol
1 HR AGO
Wanna wip me at a quick goblin fight?
1 HR AGO
Whip
1 HR AGO
Sure!
1 HR AGO
Made a game

```
[13:35:07] FuglyJoe rolls a 4 with a 20-sided die.
[13:35:11] ￼ FuglyJoe: damn
[13:35:20] h0p3 draws their initial hand.
[13:35:30] ￼ h0p3: ugh
[13:35:38] ￼ h0p3: kp
[13:35:45] FuglyJoe takes a mulligan to 5.
[13:35:57] ￼ FuglyJoe: wow
    no mana at all on one hand lol
    gtg
[13:38:43] h0p3 points from their Goblin Cratermaker to FuglyJoe's Goblin Lackey.
[13:38:55] ￼ FuglyJoe: how?
    oh block. lol
    HAHAHAHA
    holy shit
[13:39:13] ￼ h0p3: Lol
[13:39:14] ￼ FuglyJoe: forgot summoning sickness didn't stop block
[13:39:20] ￼ h0p3: Let's pretend that didn't happen
[13:39:35] ￼ FuglyJoe: Fuuuuuuuck
[13:39:50] ￼ FuglyJoe: i have to top deck to not get fucked...
[13:40:22] ￼ FuglyJoe: my forceball came in-- i grabbed one that you don't need a string for, very nice
[13:40:32] ￼ h0p3: wow, neat
    That sounds excellent
[13:40:48] ￼ FuglyJoe: i did it for 90 min, rebecca said she couldn't handle it anymore lol
[13:40:53] ￼ h0p3: rofl
[13:41:10] ￼ h0p3: upkeep effects
[13:41:21] ￼ FuglyJoe: what does that mean?
[13:41:26] ￼ h0p3: wait on your upkeep
    I have an effect
[13:41:29] ￼ FuglyJoe: k
[13:42:07] ￼ FuglyJoe: yep...
[13:43:17] ￼ FuglyJoe: now-- should i have hoped to get 2 more mana to pop a incinerator?
    or was that ok
[13:43:37] ￼ h0p3: You did the right thing.
[13:44:27] FuglyJoe points from their Gempalm Incinerator to h0p3's Goblin Warchief.
[13:44:34] ￼ h0p3: go ahead and take that back
[13:44:39] ￼ FuglyJoe: oops
    thx
[13:44:52] ￼ FuglyJoe: i don't know why i think of inc as 2 damage
    thx
[13:47:03] ￼ FuglyJoe: damn
[13:47:12] ￼ FuglyJoe: top deckin for mana lol
[13:48:15] ￼ FuglyJoe: ooooh shit
[13:48:22] ￼ FuglyJoe: WAAAAAIT
    wtf
[13:48:33] ￼ FuglyJoe: god damn it
[13:48:46] ￼ h0p3: hehe
[13:48:47] ￼ FuglyJoe: something happened 
    sorry
[13:49:17] ￼ FuglyJoe: accidentally put it into my hand instead of graveyard
[13:49:27] ￼ h0p3: Uh, that's still in your hand, right?
[13:49:28] ￼ FuglyJoe: so saw it again and thought i had royally messed up by not using it
[13:49:34] ￼ h0p3: You should use it.
[13:49:36] ￼ FuglyJoe: nah, i popped it earlier
    oh
    nm
    i have the memory of a gold fish
    god damn
    im making a fool of myself
[13:50:18] FuglyJoe moves Gempalm Incinerator from their graveyard to their hand.
[13:50:22] ￼ h0p3: lol, it's fine
    thousand moving pieces
    I suppose you are popping something
[13:50:56] ￼ FuglyJoe: its over anyway
[13:50:58] ￼ h0p3: upkeep effects
[13:51:01] ￼ h0p3: aye, gg
[13:51:22] ￼ h0p3: oh shit, lol
[13:51:25] ￼ FuglyJoe: just got the wasteland
[13:51:48] ￼ h0p3: the double mull was a huge kick in the nuts
    You have a lot of gas, just no way to get it onto the table. 
[13:52:31] ￼ FuglyJoe: yeah, if you don't have aether/lackey, and only have 2 mana, it felt like a safe mull
    then the next hand had no mana/lackey/aether
[13:53:00] ￼ h0p3: I'm willing to keep non-vial, non-lackey hands if they are very control heavy
[13:53:18] ￼ FuglyJoe: like ports?
[13:53:29] ￼ h0p3: sometimes
    incinerator, whirler, and SS are amazing in this matchup
[13:54:02] ￼ FuglyJoe: SS? really?
    i need to see him in action i guess, seems very underwhelmin
[13:54:13] ￼ h0p3: with a bit of matron/leader, I feel like I can control my way into an advantageous position in this matchup
    without haste, he is a liability
    with haste, he is one of the best cards in the deck in this matchup, imho
    It's about like a whirler every turn, but far more complex lines of play
[13:55:03] ￼ FuglyJoe: how does haste help me so much?
[13:55:33] ￼ h0p3: sharpshooter with haste clears all but my warchief
[13:55:41] ￼ FuglyJoe: ooooh
[13:55:44] ￼ h0p3: 1 card takes out 3
[13:55:46] ￼ FuglyJoe: SS means sharpshooter lol
[13:55:50] ￼ h0p3: yes! sorry
[13:55:54] ￼ FuglyJoe: i thought you mean stingscourgert
[13:55:57] ￼ h0p3: oh
    that is the worst card in the deck in this matchup
    lol, eyah
    you are right, Sting is awful
    I still want the kids to practice with that card because it's a fucking bomb in some matchups
    it is extremely un-redlike
[13:56:41] ￼ FuglyJoe: yeah, [[1uxb0x]] used kiki and SS to clear my board, was enlightening
    yeah, seems like a blue card, neh?
[13:57:03] ￼ h0p3: yes
    comes from a set where they purposely tried to mix the colors
    happy that this one is a goblin
[13:57:35] ￼ FuglyJoe: k-- one more, then its time to masturbate
    reb just left
[13:58:05] ￼ FuglyJoe: hard lesson game-- no do overs
[13:59:02] ￼ h0p3: =)
[13:59:11] ￼ h0p3: kp
[13:59:14] ￼ FuglyJoe: im goin first
[14:00:01] ￼ h0p3: sorry I'm going slow
    writing as we go
[14:00:47] ￼ FuglyJoe: going first has a measurable advantage, yeah? has it been nailed down to a specfic %?
[14:02:11] ￼ FuglyJoe: fuck my butt-- missed my draw step
[14:02:20] ￼ h0p3: uh, did you?
    draw
[14:02:23] ￼ FuglyJoe: nope
    no do over
    hard lesson game
[14:02:35] ￼ h0p3: Going first has a significant advantage
[14:02:53] ￼ FuglyJoe: i passed the turn btw
[14:04:54] ￼ h0p3: Ouch
[14:04:56] ￼ h0p3: =(
[14:06:17] ￼ h0p3: ouch
[14:06:20] ￼ h0p3: lol
    I need those lands
[14:06:32] ￼ FuglyJoe: well, you have vial out now, so im on a clock
[14:06:37] ￼ h0p3: true
[14:07:12] ￼ FuglyJoe: goblin
    :)
[14:07:18] ￼ h0p3: haha
[14:07:54] ￼ h0p3: my gamble did not pay off
[14:08:43] FuglyJoe puts Goblin Matron into play from their hand.
[14:08:56] ￼ h0p3: no whammies, no whammies, no whammies
[14:08:57] ￼ FuglyJoe: give me a sec-- this takes me a long while
[14:09:21] ￼ h0p3: take as long as you'd like
[14:09:48] FuglyJoe puts Goblin Chieftain into play from their library.
[14:09:53] ￼ h0p3: Fascinating
[14:09:58] ￼ FuglyJoe: damn
    k-- so bad move
    what would you grab?
[14:10:06] ￼ h0p3: I cannot say that
    I simply don't know enough to answer the question.
[14:10:20] ￼ FuglyJoe: k
    one sec
[14:10:35] ￼ h0p3: There are indeed cases in which that is the correct choice.
[14:10:39] ￼ FuglyJoe: k
[14:11:02] ￼ h0p3: god fucking damnit
[14:12:51] ￼ FuglyJoe: response?
[14:12:58] ￼ h0p3: none
[14:14:33] ￼ FuglyJoe: was worried about inc
[14:16:18] ￼ FuglyJoe: take that yah bastage
[14:16:23] ￼ h0p3: lol
[14:16:35] ￼ h0p3: vial trigger on the stack
[14:16:46] ￼ FuglyJoe: WHooooooooaaaa
    WTF
    that is good to know
[14:17:15] h0p3 points from their Goblin Chainwhirler to FuglyJoe.
[14:17:15] ￼ FuglyJoe: i have been tapping that like a fucking sorcery lol
    god damn...
[14:17:20] ￼ h0p3: lol
    noice
[14:17:34] ￼ h0p3: often it's during opponent's combat step or EoT
    give away as little information as possible with it
[14:18:03] ￼ FuglyJoe: gg
[14:18:21] ￼ h0p3: gg
    I think matron->crater was the best shot.
    You could destroy my vial and I'd be sitting on one land
[14:18:46] ￼ FuglyJoe: ooooh
    gotcha
[14:19:01] FuglyJoe puts Goblin Ringleader into play from their hand.
[14:19:03] FuglyJoe puts Lightning Crafter into play from their hand.
[14:19:04] FuglyJoe puts Goblin Matron into play from their hand.
[14:19:14] ￼ h0p3: crafter is a card I just don't know about
[14:19:17] ￼ FuglyJoe: i mistakenly thought LC was 3 mana
[14:19:17] ￼ h0p3: Sometimes it's amazing
    a must answer
    othertimes, it is virtual card disadvantage
[14:19:53] h0p3 puts Lightning Crafter into play from their hand.
[14:19:55] ￼ FuglyJoe: it pairs nicely with matrons i thinks
[14:19:57] ￼ h0p3: have one sittingin my hadn too
    yes
    matrons and ringleaders are fodder
[14:20:40] ￼ FuglyJoe: makes gem inc stronger, gives you something to sac on gang and prosp
    feel like im not getting to play Ringleader often
[14:21:01] ￼ h0p3: Indeed, they are the glue
[14:21:12] ￼ FuglyJoe: basically hard casting everything in our games
[14:21:29] ￼ h0p3: I ain't making it easy on ya.
[14:21:36] ￼ FuglyJoe: haven't had an aether yet, and lackey and instigator get popped as priority 
[14:21:54] ￼ h0p3: Aye. Vial is the real deal here.
    We're basically playing control decks that can combo on the spot (switch to the beatdown roll nicely)
[14:22:19] ￼ FuglyJoe: didn't affinity use vials too?
[14:22:24] ￼ h0p3: Long ago, yes
    Nobody uses them anymore.
[14:22:42] ￼ FuglyJoe: your still current on the metagame?
[14:22:53] ￼ h0p3: That deck has evolved into another creature entire. I call that deck "MUD" a mono brown control-prison deck, in this case with more aggression.
[14:22:55] ￼ FuglyJoe: you're*
[14:23:04] ￼ h0p3: nope, I peek at it
    but, I'm not playing competitively
[14:23:13] ￼ FuglyJoe: brown?
[14:23:25] ￼ h0p3: yup, the old artifacts were brown in color
[14:23:31] ￼ FuglyJoe: ah
[14:24:11] ￼ h0p3: Love the "Gimp and Ninja" title to this game, btw, lol
[14:24:21] ￼ FuglyJoe: I'll have to get some more "My face to your fist technique" time in with your kids this week
[14:24:29] ￼ h0p3: lol
    That is a lot of nuts
[14:24:37] ￼ FuglyJoe: lol
     that movie was so bad, weird how it has carved a spot in our memories
[14:25:08] ￼ h0p3: I hope I have chosen better movies for the kids, lol.
[14:25:25] ￼ FuglyJoe: i wasn't really diggin zombieland the second time through
    kind of forgot why i enjoyed it so much the first time
[14:25:35] ￼ h0p3: me neither
    perhaps doesn't belong on the list
    that list is hard to make
[14:26:20] ￼ FuglyJoe: yeah, gotta be the right person at the right time in their lift to enjoy it
    a rolling list
    anyway
    im gonna hit the penis
[14:27:14] ￼ h0p3: love you, go masturbate
[14:27:22] ￼ FuglyJoe: "_
    :)
[14:27:29] FuglyJoe has lost connection to the game.
