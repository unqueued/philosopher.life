title: 2019.12.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Dixiecrat

!! Respond to the following gem:

What is a Dixiecrat? A Democrat. A Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat in disguise...The Dixiecrats in Washington, D.C., control the key committees that run the government. The only reason the Dixiecrats control these committees is because they have seniority. The only reason they have seniority is because they come from states where Negroes can’t vote. This is not even a government that’s based on democracy. It is not a government that is made up of representatives of the people. Half of the people in the South can’t even vote. Eastland is not even supposed to be in Washington. Half of the senators and congressmen who occupy these key positions in Washington, D.C., are there illegally, are there unconstitutionally...These senators and congressmen actually violate the constitutional amendments that guarantee the people of that particular state or county the right to vote. And the Constitution itself has within it the machinery to expel any representative from a state where the voting rights of the people are violated. You don’t even need new legislation. Any person in Congress right now, who is there from a state or a district where the voting rights of the people are violated, that particular person should be expelled from Congress. And when you expel him, you’ve removed one of the obstacles in the path of any real meaningful legislation in this country. In fact, when you expel them, you don’t need new legislation, because they will be replaced by black representatives from counties and districts where the black man is in the majority, not in the minority.

I don't know enough US history to say. I agree that Dixiecrats are Democrats, and I have little sympathy for either. I've known people who call themselves Dixiecrats (that'll be a big yikes from me, dawg). I grew up in the American South, and the split between local Democratic leaders and national Republican voting struck me as hypocritical. 

I'll agree that seniority, as it is currently defined, is insane. In a well-oiled voting apparatus, that would be handled by webs of authority which trace back down to the voter as seamlessly as possible. Of course, political power will continue to centralize through whatever corruptive means are available. I think problem has only gotten worse, including systematic attacks on proletariat voting (which sits well before the radical failures of representation).

I don't care if people are legal power from legal means if they aren't morally justified, and they aren't.

Oddly, you are far more optimistic than I am. Are you being realpolitik here? I think so.
