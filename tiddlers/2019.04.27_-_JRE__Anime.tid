My brother has moved to another anti-depressant, Lexapro. Ugh. On second thought though, I'm more optimistic for my brother's success with it. He seems to respond better to anti-depressants. 

We talked about oral sex. He delivers perfect noises again, lol.

My brother talked about Matt, his co-worker, and several kinds of dialectics he has engaged in. The more he explains, the more I'm convinced I see my 5th graders in Matt (and vv.). My brother is really good to that kid, but that kid will never know it. I think what is wrong with his co-workers is something I can generalize to most of the human population; people don't want to rule themselves with cognition that is universalizable (including reasoning about the value and meaning of our emotions [[irwartfrr]]). We talked about even just using our leisure time, even an hour a night, studying practical and theoretic wisdom; for the world to do so would radically alter it.

We had a discussion about a podcast between Colbert and Conan. I was the buzzkill rhetoric hawk again. I pointed out what I thought were their moral opportunity costs, the permissibility of their identities, what we owe to each other as political animals, what literacy has to look like, what it means for democracy to obtain, and the nature of hedonism, ad hominem, and the sacrifices most of the elite are obligated to collectively make for the sake of everyone on the planet.

My brother and I talked about Smith, The Blight, Antiheroes, "Are we the badguys?", what it means to decentralize power, obligations to engage in philosophy, modal realism, my intuitions on what is possible in the world, and animating my view. It was interesting to hear my brother reason about how my point of view is often considered villainous.

Defeating the paradox of tolerance means we have to make moral perfectionist determinations of the [[good]] of personhood, including the more empirically particularized [[good]] of [[Humanity]] in virtue of the more essential and generalized notion of persons. I'm a eugenicist and eumemecist; psychopathy is evil. If we could magically snap our fingers, take pills, or alter our genes to eliminate it, we should.
