title: 2019.08.29 - Afterschool Teaching: The Mark

VPParker and Whitney are building a case with DCS regarding 8J and 7CM. They are hedging it as a joke. Raw consequentialist reasoning here, I am not convinced the best outcomes will arise from a group home for either of my children. I see wealth inequality playing out yet again in terms of who can afford to help these children.

I did the prep while she walked through her report. She left it out for me to read. I wasn't able to finish off our data from yesterday, but I'll get to it.

8L is clearly depressed. Her hopelessness bleeds out, and she's hilarious. The darkness is strong with this one. I think she is sleeping way too much. Sharp tongue. I adore it.

Madame Bacon took my 5th. I took everyone else. Behavior was solid enough. They only had to study, but I'm glad she's grinding with them. Good habits here.

Unfortunately, there's a fuckton of busywork and wasted effort here. Even the teachers don't really believe in learning, or when they do, the bar tends to be in the gutter. The moral virtue training makes me want to puke. 

6TS decided to play magic with us. Wow. I'm continually stunned here. Let's do it, homie. They took one off me 2v1. We're exploring the concept of control nicely.

FPS games are taking over. My wiki kids had to leave early today. =(

The adults are breaking apart 8J and 7CM. I'm supposed to call the office whenever one wants to go take a piss. Lock and key, phone tag, etc. 8J confirmed the last phone call was about him, lol. Whitney is chillin in the office while the gym monkeys play on their own. 

Matt borrowed some of my 5th in the lab. I have no idea. He's been attempting to connect in tidbits more with me. Small things, I think. I will need to think about what it means, and I hope to useful to the man.

We're stocked with 9th graders. They are required to be here, but I'm glad they come. We aren't accepting anymore (not up to me; I think we should). 

My children were upset that we left early from the lab (understandably). 7Gf (thought she was 8Gf) is becoming more devious. It's a great mix.

[[gh057]] and I chatted. He knows yesterday was a rough day. I appreciate having an ear, someone to vent with. He and my brother help me realize I'm not alone in this. He knows what our children are up against. Also, thank you for the Maker's Mark. =)
