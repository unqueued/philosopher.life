//This is a prompt we might ask of anyone who has political [[power]] over [[us & others|others]]. In a conceptually perfect democracy (including being behind the [[VOI]]), everyone has power over us, which is exactly why we should care about their reasons on any grounds. We are morally obligated to strongly care for what other people think and feel even as pure egoists who admit justice as an end. MLK & [[Saint MX]] were [[good]] anarchists. How will we, as profoundly [[fff]] individual citizens, know when authority is justified without having developed a thorough notion of that justification? And, therefore, how should we develop justified answers to this prompt ourselves? In what is correct about metaethical perfectionism, we are tasked with listing objective standards of [[The Good]] of [[Humanity]] for the sake of pursuing it. Surely, such a list cannot be generated overnight well enough. It must take a lifetime of [[Straussian]] study. Saints [[Plato]] and Aristotle, blessed be their [[name]]s and naming, profoundly understood what it meant to be political & realpolitik animals. Profoundly Fair Representation can be computed far more effectively and safely than we have in our governments; currently, insofar as it is up to us, it's primarily the centralizing pyramid of privatized egos<<ref "t">> which shapes our material dialectics. Unity is expensive, and unity in determining the [[gfwiwcgws]] must be performed in reflective equilibrium (preferably far better than an egoist's nash equilibrium both in consequence and intention). Fire up the quadratic ranged voting and bring out the frictionless spherical chickens in a vacuum. As always, [[ridtyawtr]].//

I'm opposed to nationalism. I'm a cosmopolitan in a way that does not sit well with a lot of people. What does it mean to care about billions of people in the past, present, and future? What conventions work toward what is obligatory [[irwartfrr]]?

I'm also someone who is open to radical transformations of the Earth which are not environmentally friendly on some views (though, obviously, it's crazy fucking evil not to care about our planet, even purely instrumentally).

So much of who we are should not be reduced to a plain market even if this will be our tendency as a species.

How do you jumpstart a political world based not on the assumption that most people will be unjustifiably selfish (note, we can change to some [[dok]])? How do you jumpstart a political world which maximizes the odds we will not be unjustifiably selfish? What's your self-perpetuating and evolving New Deal?

* Worldwide Medical Care Program
** We must serve the poorest of the world. They should get the same treatment that we do in our healthcare system. If we want nice healthcare, we better pay for everyone to have it. Given diminishing marginal returns, the maximin standard of the least should be the highest we can make.

* Worldwide Sustainable Food Program
** Absolutely absurd that this is privatized at all.
** Potable water on the spot
** Making food to be shipped

* Worldwide Sheltering Program

* Worldwide Transport Infrastructure
** Prioritization won't be easy; it's hard to make fair.
** Building [[Outopos]]
** Radical investment in low and no-carbon decentralized energy infrastructures
** Some necessary centralization components of public transport...
*** Likely need to be anonymized, completely unregulated

* Worldwide Education Program

* Worldwide Voting Mechanisms
** Implementation of [[TPK]]
** Progressive Taxation of Power.
*** Automation, including inflation-index adjustment
*** Gonna have to B-word a currency to force the matter.
*** There is a price to pay for privacy, and the significant spheres of power should not have the power to afford privacy.
** [[The Great Human Conversation]] Cannon Voting
*** What are things we should all have to see together? Or, how do we divide up the task wisely?
*** What languages and memeplexes must we pick together, share together, tend to be fluent in together, and which shape our behavioral practices to some non-trivial [[dok]]?
*** Discourses built on commonground with commoners is required. This [[power]] shapes people's reality maps so profoundly, and we have to decentralize it as best we can.
** Voting on Research Proposals
