m15 can't afford to run /home off an SD card. It's absurdly slow. It really can only be for pure storage. I'm going to have reinstall and do it differently now. KDE's partition/disk tool forces root permissions, so I had to fix that as well. 

Installed KDE. Meh. I like it on my desktop, but I think I'll stick to XFCE on the chromebook.

I've decided to forego swap for now.

Since this is the the umpteenth time I've done this, I might as well have it written down:

```bash
$ sudo pacman -S xorg-xbacklight
$ xbacklight -inc 4
$ xbacklight -dec 3
```

Gotta be able to hit 1 easily.

```bash
amixer set Master 3%-
amixer set Master 3%+
amixer set Master toggle
```
