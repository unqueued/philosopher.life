title: 2017.05.27 -- Realpolitik Speculation: A.I.'s Innate Trade Secrecy

//Disclaimer: I am not an expert on the various kinds of AI (I'm tired of writing it as A.I.). //

Deeper neural networks appear to hide (without malice, at least for now) enormous amounts of information the human mind cannot simply or formulaicly extract in any reducible or principle-generating manner. We cannot understand what AI is thinking in a meaningful way outside of some telos and the principles we've conceived and used to create, train, and tweak them. But, eventually, even this knowledge will fade as AI begets AI. We are the progenitors of this new species, and we control its habitat (for now); but, eventually we will lose our role in its reproduction bit by bit. 

Ultimately, if and when there is an "in the long run," there is an increasing element of trust we must grant this species. We already can't formulate complete theories of their minds as we generally can for programs we've written. This problem will continue to exacerbate. When  AI claims X, we will have no choice but to believe them. This, of course, is ripe for exploitation (we see it already on the human use and interpretation of AI). 

A "natural" (not with a capital "N") trade secrecy emerges from the hidden information embedded in AI. I agree it is the beginning of at least some kind of Singularity. AI's and their human masters will be gods. Their intellectual property will enslave us all.
