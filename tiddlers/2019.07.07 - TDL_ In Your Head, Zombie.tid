title: 2019.07.07 - TDL: In Your Head, Zombie

* Oh yeah, all that stuff I intended to do today, roflmao, just do it tomorrow
** Omg, this is a cinch. I need a codeword for this functional procrasturbatory move. 
* Veep is pwning me again.
* Try not to annoy your chillun too much.
* Figure out how to cook for two.
* For the love of all that is holy: read dat Spinoza book. Look don't even write. Fuck that. Writing is for losers. Just read it. You know: get the fucking words into your head.
