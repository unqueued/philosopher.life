title: Afterschool Teaching: Science & Social

//I get one tiny lesson per week, and I think concept introductions or wrestling with particular quotes will give me the most bang for the buck in the tiny window I have. Freewriting, discussion, and note-taking. Teach big ideas and dialectical processes; they have no one else to show them.//

* Economics
* CS
* Political Science
* Philosophy (duh doy :P)
