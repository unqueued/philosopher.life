title: 2018.02.27 - Prompted Introspection Log: Children Rule the World

!! What would happen if children ruled the world?

* What does it mean to be a child?
* What does it mean to rule the world?
* Which children are ruling the world, for how long, and to what extent do they rule world? 
* How did the children come to power?
* What makes it so "adults" don't take the power back?

I know that sounds so obvious to you. When I peel apart these concepts, it becomes less obvious to me. I can only give arbitrary reasons to draw these lines.

Given the common sense notions, I'll tell you that it would be chaos for 2 minutes before "adults" usurped and overpowered them. The cacophony would result from interrogating ourselves, figuring out how this came to be.

Even when I try to imagine stable forms of "common sense" children-rulers, I am not convinced they are truly in power. They are figure-heads. Deep states will always exist.
