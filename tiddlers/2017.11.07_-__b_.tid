Referring to your employees as "family" is the corporate equivalent of telling a prostitute "you love her."

Gun-control is not the answer, fucktards. Socialism is the answer.

Do you want to prevent the death of fetuses? Outlawing abortions is not the answer. Seriously. Go look at it, you ignorant fuck. How about you treat the fucking cause of the problem: poverty,  a lack of support structures, and wealth, education, and opportunity inequality. The solution to abortion is preventing the need for them in the first place. 

Apply the lesson, retards. Gun-control does not solve your problem. 

Build infrastructure to help mentally unwell people. Let's make the world love rather than hate us. Let's make people who don't have a reason to kill. Prevent reasons for violence, don't simply try to take away a means to violence. Violence is useful, after all.

Stop your neo-liberal policies. It's going to take guns to stop the Hyperclass and the armies they have built against us.

If I were female, I would have a portable vibrator embedded in me at all times. I'd get off all over the place. Why not? Fluids can be caught, masturbation can be silently and motionlessly achieved, and you can hide your arousal. This is free utility people. What are you doing with your lives?
