title: 2018.08.08 -- Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos

Canticle of Leibowitz reference. This book does feel like he had a sci-fi book idea, but couldn't put it into novel form. I'm reminded of Seveneves too. 

He's talking about the internalism/externalism debate from a geographical notion, but ultimately doesn't resolve the problem in a meaningful way.

It's weird for a book to be a "mock" self-help book while still trying to be a self-help book.

Glad I read it. I don't think I'd read it again.
