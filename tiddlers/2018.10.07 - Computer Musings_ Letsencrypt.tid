title: 2018.10.07 - Computer Musings: Letsencrypt

This is almost comical. My ineptitude is loud and clear again. 

Firefox was throwing up this error for me yesterday:

<<<
Peerâ€™s Certificate has expired. HTTP Strict Transport Security: false HTTP Public Key Pinning: false
<<<

Could be just on my end, but 99% sure it isn't.

I have no idea why I have so much trouble with letsencrypt; it's EZ mode, right? Every once'd in a while, something goes wrong with letsencrypt for me.

certbot tells me it's not expired. Thus, I'm clearly missing something. Let's just do it all over again (and then again, and so on), that will fix it, right? Fuck me.

```bash
sudo certbot revoke --cert-path /etc/letsencrypt/archive/philosopher.life/cert1.pem
sudo certbot revoke --cert-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/web.pem
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge certbot
sudo apt-get install certbot
```

Can't pass letsencrypt test without temporarily killing the forced https lines in `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf`

```
$SERVER["socket"] == ":443" {
ssl.engine = "enable"
ssl.pemfile = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/web.pem" # Combined Certificate
ssl.ca-file = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/chain.pem" # Root CA
server.name = "philosopher.life" # Domain Name OR Virtual Host Name
server.document-root = "/var/www/html" # Document Root
server.errorlog = "/var/log/lighttpd/error.log"
}

$HTTP["scheme"] == "http" {
$HTTP["host"] == "philosopher.life" { # HTTP URL
url.redirect = ("/.*" => "https://philosopher.life$0") # Redirection HTTPS URL
}
}
```

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/html -d philosopher.life -d www.philosopher.life
sudo cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/cert.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/privkey.pem > /etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/web.pem
```

Restore lighttpd.conf lines

```bash
sudo service lighttpd restart
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
sudo crontab -e
```

`6 1,13 * * * certbot renew --renew-hook "service lighttpd restart"`

I'm missing something stupid obvious to someone who isn't a skiddie here. I predict a failure on 2019-01-05. For the giggles, I may just run this next time:

```
sudo cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/cert.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/privkey.pem > /etc/letsencrypt/live/philosopher.life/web.pem
```

I could just write the script to completely rekey every 3 months. Ah, my insanity. The Rube Goldberg Computing life. 

Also, I should consider moving away from lighttpd.
