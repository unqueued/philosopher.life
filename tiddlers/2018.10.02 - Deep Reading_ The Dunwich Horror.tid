I'm not even sure what to say about this book. It's fucking weird, lol. But, that's the point. The mix of weird blackish alien magic with towns being converted into modern civilization is definitely his trope. The resolution of the stories, unfortunately, never make any sense. I suggest this is on purpose. My [[Straussian]] sensor goes off, but I have absolutely no idea where I'm supposed to go with it. 

I should add the knickknacks that come with the book are cute. It's an experience.
