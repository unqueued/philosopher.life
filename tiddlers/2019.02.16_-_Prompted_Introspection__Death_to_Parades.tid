title: 2019.02.16 - Prompted Introspection: Death to Parades

!! Describe a fair, parade, or festival you have attended.

I have spent non-trivial portions of my life trying to understand why the humans around me give a shit about it. I like concerts, plays, mind-blowing museums, nudity, free food, and the beach. I don't care for amusement parks anymore, but I like a good pool. Fairs, parades, and festivals are like bars, the mall, and going to church: please kill me. I even avoided Songkran like the fucking plague. I find funerals more interesting, fo' realsies.

We took the kids to parade a while back. What's the fucking point? Why should we give a shit? Can we just talk, or read, or masturbate instead? Maybe I've just not been to the right one? 

Perhaps the closest thing to a festival I like are the section of conventions devoted to competitive gaming or computers. I'm not there for the people except for appreciating their expertise. Most of the time, I see far more of the world through my computer.
