Shitastic time since last night.  Restless leg syndrome kept me up until 4am, then we tried going kayaking, but I now have the shits so bad we stopped after 30 minutes.  Also, I contributed to making rebecca feel bad about kayaking (we needed to go upstream, and in those 30 minutes we may have travelled 100 yards total because she isn't very coordinated nor strong, which was frustrating to me, which I didn't hide very well)
MON 1:37 PM
Just hanging out in the room, since there is no restroom near the beach
MON 1:38 PM
Also, thought it was pretty funny that Killcoin knows I don't much care for him
MON 1:39 PM
Glad the dck is working
MON 1:40 PM
What did you write that was so humorous?
MON 1:40 PM
Huh, you gave me an interesting idea.
MON 3:26 PM
What's that?
MON 3:31 PM
I'm sorry you feeling stuck in the room.
MON 3:31 PM
My last vacation with [[k0sh3k]] was like that.
MON 3:31 PM
You got sick?
MON 3:32 PM
Sorry, afking hard. Yeah, I was puking my guts out from some illness. I did go swimming once, and I had a steak though.
MON 4:12 PM
Yeah, I didn't want to put words into your mouth there. I tried to say it right.
MON 4:12 PM
I'm glad I had DCK to use.
MON 4:12 PM
Uh, I'm not sure I wrote anything that was super humorous. Are you asking about the encrypted file?
MON 4:18 PM
Nah, you said you and the kids cracked up about what you wrote while on dck

MON 4:40 PM
Wow, how the hell did you type all of that, seems much more coherent than what I felt capable of doing when I tried it
MON 4:46 PM
This is actually me intentionally trying to stay in the k-hole and only coming up for breathe. I can fight it enough to be fully there (which I have done before as well). The results are far less interesting though.
MON 4:47 PM
I use as minimal a threshold dose as I can though.
MON 4:47 PM
It's far less of a sledge-hammer than my first uses too.
MON 4:48 PM
I am more able to not freak out, I think.

MON 4:53 PM
It's like a digital power of attorney.
MON 4:58 PM
I've been recommended a book, if you want to read it with me: "How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy"
