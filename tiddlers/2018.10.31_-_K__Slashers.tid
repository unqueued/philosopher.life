So what slasher films did you watch?
12 HR AGO
Good morning! For once our schedules seemed to have lined up. Hahaha
11 HR AGO
In “Slasher” I watched Scream 4 which is a personal favorite and the newest A Nightmare on Elm Street which is trash.
11 HR AGO
I also watched the Conjuring. Tonight I plan to watch the second one for the first time and the original Halloween to bring it all full circle.
11 HR AGO
My short story is also almost finished. I’ll send you a copy once I get my final feedback in. :)
11 HR AGO
You are on a run, lol.
11 HR AGO
It's cool that you have a tradition of it.
11 HR AGO
I'm excited to see your shortstory.
11 HR AGO
It makes me happy. It’s fun to work those horror muscles while I figure my life out. Haha
11 HR AGO
How was [[AIR]] doing?
11 HR AGO
Was fine. Got ghosted by his date/BF. So, he is to'w up. Starts work today. May take his mind off it a bit; I do not know.
11 HR AGO
That really sucks. :/
11 HR AGO
How are you guys?
11 HR AGO
Any Halloween plans?
11 HR AGO
Give things to kids, have my kids go get things given to them. Read+Write like a madman.
11 HR AGO
Whatcha working on?
11 HR AGO
Figuring my life out with my wiki, uploading my mind into it. Currently in The Remodeling (https://philosopher.life/#The%20Remodeling:%5B%5BThe%20Remodeling%5D%5D)
11 HR AGO
[[j3d1h]] and I have been building a lot of tools for it.
11 HR AGO
New (https://philosopher.life/#New:New) is the best indicator of what I'm working (at least new stuff). Because of The Remodeling, Recent (https://philosopher.life/#Recent:Recent), which includes all edits, is out of control.
11 HR AGO
It's a massive overhaul of ~7k pages and their structuring.
11 HR AGO
Oof. That sounds.... daunting. Haha.
10 HR AGO
Indeed, it's a huge amount of work. Embracing the grind. =)
