title: 2019.06.18 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Bush

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The Bush Administration do have moral values. Their moral values are very explicit: shine the boots of the rich and the powerful, kick everybody else in the face, and let your grandchildren pay for it. That simple principle predicts almost everything that's happening.
<<<

That explains almost every politician I've seen. The state is controlled by capitalism. Bush and the Republicans are exceptionally obvious about it to the point that some portion of the population can recognize it. Many of these people think the best option is a compromise with another party controlled by capitalism as well. It's a rhetorical dialectic. It's not that we can't do anything about it. 

The wealthy are at war with the rest of us, and they always have been. Wealthy people who aim to be moral do not stay wealthy for very long. Concentrated power exists for its own sake, and it only turns on its empathy to control the rest of us. They are, of course, the largest problem. Those who do not aim to solve it, however, are reactionaries of some flavor. If you don't intend to be political, you have already decided to maintain the status quo. Those who do not study and speak of civics on a daily basis have already failed to participate in a functioning democracy (or a revolution toward one), and I say that recognizing how large swathes of the population have extremely limited time to do anything other than function as wage-slave cogs.

The homeless schizoid addict on the street, the single mom working 2-3 jobs, the 12yo kid brainwashed in school, etc. have far lower moral requirements on their lives. Most folks I know, however, are profoundly culpable for failing to engage in philosophy, political discourse, and wrestling for what matters most. I have a problem with hedonists who do not fight to be moral persons; I see selfish egoism infecting most people, and I would know: I fight it in myself all the time.
