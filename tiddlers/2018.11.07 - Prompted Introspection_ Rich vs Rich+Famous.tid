title: 2018.11.07 - Prompted Introspection: Rich vs Rich+Famous

!! Would you rather be rich and famous or just rich? Why?

I am reminded by these set of questions:

* [[2018.01.16 - Prompted Introspection Log: Wealth or Fame]]
* [[2018.09.19 - Prompted Introspection: Fame and Fortune]]

This appears to be a question about power.

Wealthy people who aren't famous have other kinds of powers, especially as the world crumbles around us. Some wealthy people are very interested in maintaining privacy and anonymity except when they choose to reveal the information.

I guess it depends on how famous you are in this question. Are you famous enough that you can say anything and people will still pay attention because you said it, or must you say something in accordance with what gets viewers? Obviously, I have something to say to the people of the world. I don't think I'm ready to say it well though. I don't know how much time I have either.

I'd prefer to give anonymously if I could. I'd want even my fame to be anonymous fame. Of course, this question is a mere {[[Dream]]}.
