title: 2018.02.20 - Employment Log: Jumping In

Finding jobs is my job, and it always will be. My occupation isn't simply a single thing. I can see that I will need to constantly be on the lookout. My tools must always be sharp, regularly used, and working on the next thing. This will not be an accident. Success will require constant force.

I'm cleaning up the [[Employment Log]] page. I'm structuring it. I want it to be a pristine laboratory. Let's fill it with the objects we need and make it a home worth living in.

I'm not going to list all the major changes I'm making because it is happening to rapidly right now.

I am sad to see how much networking is truly the key to this. I am not surprised. I do not have that option, I believe.
