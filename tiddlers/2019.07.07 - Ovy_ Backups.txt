[2:28 PM] Valdus: uhm I just imported omnibus by dragging and dropping into the bob tw. It worked on this laptop end Im scared to look at the desktop to see what happened.
[2:29 PM] Valdus: only thing thats annoying is that it is saving as "tiddlywiki"

[3:46 PM] h0p3: Yay! :smiley:
[3:59 PM] Valdus: But that saving as TiddlyWiki kinda freaks me out
[8:21 PM] Valdus: Ok, now the next thing on the agenda is palette. After that, outer space tiddlywiki
[11:22 PM] h0p3: You'll want to make sure you get the saving and backups all set. You need that foundation to be as solid as you can get it, imho.
