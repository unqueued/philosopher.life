title: 2019.06.25 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Out of Hiding

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
When everybody is swept away unthinkingly by what everybody else does and believes in, those who think are drawn out of hiding becauseâ€¦ [thinking] becomes a kind of action.
<<<

This reminds me of several theories of autonomy and how we beg the question of reason in defining personhood, authenticity, anarchism, and [[the other]]. I refuse to claim the "unthinking" aren't thinking at all though they are thinking very poorly; it reaches into the spectrum of unthinking. They think to choose not to think about what merits thought, and after that, I am willing to call it the moral equivalent of thoughtlessness even though all the material machinations in their brains appear to look like any other kind of instance we would call thoughtfulness. I agree people tend not to be thoughtful in general, but I also think they could if they really wanted to some significant extent. Not all humans are persons, and not all persons deserve to think and exist as they do. Reason^^tm^^ is the justificatory criterion for both agency (including evil agents) in general and valid agency more specifically. It is here that coercion in [[The Golden Rule]] arises.

The quote seems more to be about blindly celebrating contrarianism, countercultural behaviors, and "thinking for oneself" (whatever that means) than the justification and meaning of such a thing. I also am not convinced those who think are drawn out of hiding. The cream does not always rise to the top, there are Einstein's who die picking cotton in the fields, and you can be so far on the end of the bellcurve that you are alone, trapped on your epistemic island with no bridges others would dare cross or create with you.

Similar to how one man's modus ponens is another man's modus tollens, so too one man's wisdom of the crowds is another man's appeal to popular bandwagons. Epistemic justification ultimately emits from [[The Good]] which is both transcendent and somehow (whatever it means to say it) immanent in our context. Reflective equilibrium is the only empirical heuristic I know for discovering and contextualizing the otherwise transcendent, and therefore this rebellious uncovering we know not what in [[The Dialectic]], including [[The Great Human Conversation]] is necessary. Being philosophical is often a renegade action, but not all renegade actions are valid. How can we know which are valid and invalid? I guess we'll need someone to uncover that for us, to come out of hiding and reveal what is outside the cave. Will we listen? Ha. Fat chance, those cog-like drone NPCs.<<ref "c">>
