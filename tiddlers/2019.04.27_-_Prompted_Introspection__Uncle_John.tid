title: 2019.04.27 - Prompted Introspection: Uncle John

!! Tell a memory you have with one of your uncles.

This was an important one: [[2018.03.25 - Prompted Introspection Log: Uncle Memory]]. I don't have much time spent with my other uncles. My Uncle John, in Nevada, was a lifelong military computer specialist (though I'm not convinced he really knows that much). He has an interesting personality, initially some extra teeth, and he virtue signals effectively to friends and family. My brother [[JRE]] wants to be like him, and that is surprisingly irrational (bordering on confabulation to me). Nice as my uncle may be to many folks, John is a reactionary and a murderer, and so are his sons. Own up to what the US Military-Industrial-Complex really is, and try to fix the damage you've caused (remorse and spending the rest of your life still won't restore enough victims). He protects and enforces the interests of the elite, and he's been paid handsomely for it.

I've visited his house once. We watched //Cast Away//, and they didn't spend much time getting to know me. I don't think they really gave a shit, and I'm sure they wouldn't want to know me now (oh noes, all the big words that make me feel bad); of course, the blame can be spread around fairly easily here. 

They had broadband, and it was amazing. It was fascinating to see how he didn't give a shit about it. In fact, he is one of the people that helped me worry about working with computers for a living; I wouldn't want to give up a passionate hobby because it was monetizable.
