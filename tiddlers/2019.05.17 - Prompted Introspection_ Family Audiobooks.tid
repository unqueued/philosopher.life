title: 2019.05.17 - Prompted Introspection: Family Audiobooks

!! What is a game or song that your family played or sang while driving?

Ouch, this is a rough question: [[2017.11.08 - Prompted Introspection Log: Let's All Go 'Round to Mary Ann's]]. I'm going to shoot for something more pleasant this time around. Packing into a car for 12-18 hours on a drive (we've done some serious driving together) serves as a pressure-cooking microcosm of our relationship dynamics. My favorites "game" was listening to audiobooks as a family. This was about the time my donors started censoring more heavily, but I am still grateful for having an introduction to listening to real books. I'm a huge fan. I wish I had been more consistent about it, and I hope to instill that in my own children. I want it to be something they do on a daily basis (as opposed to podcasts).
