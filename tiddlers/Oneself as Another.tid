I see a few major interrelated considerations here:

* Narrative identity: telling ourselves the stories of who we are and who we ought to be.
* Self-dialectic as identity
* The relationship between conscious and non-conscious processes of our minds.
* The classic persistent identity problem in the Ship of Theseus.

Perhaps I'm not understanding the gist of the argument. I am definitely worried about these issues quite a bit. I'm not seeing how he helps us.
