title: 2018.08.02 - BAGD

We have wikis so that we can deeply understand each other. The goal is for us to build an epic bridge. We are looking to make it so I can transfer my reasoning to you. I want to upload my mind into yours as a VM. You can use it however you see fit, but I think it will be damned useful to you.

I want you to constantly have that moment where you think "OMG, I need to write this down now!" I want you to be thinking of cool stuff and putting it where belongs as best you can. I want you to have new methods for engaging in your wiki all the time. I want you to grow your methodologies for how you use this wiki.

I want us to have our conversations together on these wikis. I want you to be able to converse with me MOST fluently through your wiki. Even if we can't be face-to-face for any reason, no matter where we are in life, I want to be able to understand you perfectly. This is the best possible medium I can conceive of for understanding you both.

I believe you are morally obligated to use me through my wiki and yours (obviously not as mere means), and I'm morally obligated to enable and encourage you to do so.

I am truly stupid in profound ways, and this wiki is the best existential coping tool I've ever found. I hate feeling stupid, and this has been a blessing, a relief, and a source of real construction.

Listen, but write!
