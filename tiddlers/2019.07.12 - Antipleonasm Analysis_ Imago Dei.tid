[[JHBFC]], that is outstanding, soldier! Voltaire don't play, yo. This is a bitchslap through time, and I've been plenty guilty of it myself. It's part of why I moved from theism to deism. I think it's hubris to attribute a mind like mine to the transcendent more than I absolutely must. Does it compute? Yeah, somehow, but I don't know what infinite computation really means, and I can't. Mathematical constructivism and logics which try to safely speak about [[The Infinite]] are much closer, but it still appears [[The Dialetheia]] is inescapable. I have no idea what to do with that [[True Contradiction]]; and, I aim to be radically transparent in how I surd-elim out of that with integrity.

It's fairly commonplace for me to find an OOO-style relativism (or at least it's wielded that way in a convenient and arbitrary fashion), and I'm paranoically concerned with the circular reasoning of internalists. I can appreciate trying to deanthropromorphize the memeplex, but ultimately, we cannot deanthropocentrize our epistemology all the way down. Kant is correct on this. The //imago dei//, however, is at the very least a perceptual participation (and I believe far more because I have [[faith]] in [[The Right]] and our [[agency]]). Plato was correct on this (as usual).
