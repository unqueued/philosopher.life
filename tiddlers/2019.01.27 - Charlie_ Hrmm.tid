I am worried about my Uncle Charlie. He is an autistic recluse. I've not been able to get a'hold of him for quite a while now. That's pretty normal with him. He doesn't quite understand or care about responding, but I think I owe him a great deal of latitude here. I legitimately think he can't see it. Communication only works under special conditions with him (and that goes for everyone who knows him).

Missy and Carl have not sounded an alarm though (but, they are quiet folk on this front).

Heard back. He's okay.
