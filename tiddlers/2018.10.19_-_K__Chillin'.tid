Eastern philosophy class still the standout one for you?

What about it changed for you?

Switching from Hinduism to Buddhism I think.

I was super into the former but the latter just wasn’t as great imo

Have you all covered Daoism yet?
6 HR AGO
Not yet! That’s the last third.

Good stuff on the way?

I am not qualified to answer your question with any authority. I can tell you that Daoism appears to have direct correlations with some fundamental claims in Western philosophy. Daoism is the school of Eastern philosophy which I am personally most interested in.

It also may depend quite a bit on your teacher.

I've had half a dozen Kant teachers, and only two of them were amazing.

I like my teacher a lot. I’m just not as invested in Buddhism for some reason... I don’t know why. It’s really the antithesis to Hinduism.
