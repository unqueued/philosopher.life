I spent a lot of time lecturing and trying to piece this place together. [[/b/]] shows some of the major work, but so does the [[Self-Dialectic]]. Nothing crazy, but I'll get there bit by bit.

I'm responding to folks. I'm still building my processes and thinking about what this wiki will become.

I'm still working on {[[Contact]]}. It's clear I need to have more to say here.

[[Cypher's Choice]] is actually neat to me. I think most people will find it stupid. My HPPD, however, actually force patterns to emerge from it. The hallucination is strong, and in fact, it gives me a headache to look at it too long. It's a pretty overwhelming sensation.
