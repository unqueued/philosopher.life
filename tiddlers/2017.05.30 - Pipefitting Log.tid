title: 2017.05.30 - Pipefitting Log

Today was a great day. I thought we were starting our pipefitting class up again, but we didn't. I saw TJ; so he's back. We talked for a while. He got paid to weld, even though he really can't weld. There is a reasonable chance I may do some welding for money, I take it. 

So, since I didn't have pipefitting today, I welded. Dale wasn't there this morning (someone subbed for the first few hours), so I decided to try my hand at three projects I've never done before. I did a vertical weld, an overhead weld (I failed the first one, couldn't repair it without more grind work than I wanted to do, so I restarted), and a horizontal T-joint fillet. I then brought those 3 and my horizontal weld to Dale at the end of the day. He said they were very good, and he explained where I went wrong (if I didn't point it out to him beforehand). He had me go back over the T-joint with 1/8 7018's (at 115ish heat). I had used the 3/32's, which I didn't know weren't the best choice for the project (no one corrected me). The overhead was very difficult, but it turned out decently. A lot of students walked into my booth over the course of the day, and I talked with others for pointers. It is good to hear from many perspectives; I'm grateful for the opportunity.

Dale and I talked about my goals (while the millwright teacher [who is always over there] and several students sat listening to us; a common occurrence when I speak with Dale). I explained that I have given thought to it, and I realized that I won't be able to spend much time in this class (even though I want to; I think it would be very good for my future). I really need to get a job now though. I explained that I just wanted to at least get my feet wet with everything. I did not explain, but have heard from many students that my work is passable (and sometimes great), including people who have been welding for years. Thus, I think even "getting my feet wet" on these kinds of projects ultimately gives me a barometer and comfort zone to know what I'm willing to say I could possibly do in an interview. I'm willing to take on-the-job certs for some of these welds.

At the moment, I can only do structural welds. I can't pipeweld, which is where the real money is, and it is the most closely associated with pipefitting in the first place. I do want to try pipe-welding, although my teacher thinks I won't really be ready to touch it without at least another solid month under my belt (which isn't going to happen). I'm going to try a few pipewelds anyways. I want to round my stickwelding out at least. TIG is an entirely different beast, and I may never have the pleasure to learn. That's okay. I'll take what I can get.

Speaking of jobs, I'm just now nearing the point where I would pass a drugtest (minus extensive panels for DCK). I haven't had cannabis in 40 days, 20 more puts me in a comfortable zone. Also, I was offered cannabis from Kevin today, since I gave him my cannabutter recipe to help him make some for his dying mom (she is apparently in a lot of pain and doesn't want to use opioids). No go, obviously; he wanted to know if he did it right (I was going to help him make it yesterday, but completely forgot). I'm in the home stretch here before the real game. I have to say, I'm proud of my ability to stabilize myself with this wiki. I've worked at it. I'm glad I've been talking to myself. You rock, dude. =)

I should probably rework my resume at this point. The last time I modified it, I just put down I was in school for pipefitting. I have specific skills which I feel comfortable claiming on a resume at this point. I will need it.
