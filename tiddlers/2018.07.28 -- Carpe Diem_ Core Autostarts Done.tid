title: 2018.07.28 -- Carpe Diem: Core Autostarts Done

* Woke at 9:30
* Worked on m10
* Talked with L and fam about DND, thought about what we are doing.
* Finalized backups
* Screwed around with mesh
* Tried to help ALM with Linux. He really doesn't want to put any work in. 90% of the questions he asks me he should have just googled first. He wants me to hold his hand through everything.
* Grilled Cheese, Tomato Soup, Baked Brussel Sprouts (by far my favorite style at this point)
* Inform the Men!
* Worked on m10
* Bed by 2
