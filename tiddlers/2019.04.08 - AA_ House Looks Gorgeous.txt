How was your day back?
MON 8:13 PM
It was tiring —didn’t sleep well last night but made it through
MON 9:07 PM
Sorry =(
MON 9:07 PM
I am glad you made it through.
MON 9:07 PM
Did put a second coat on the purple room tonight
MON 9:07 PM
Its ok —night before school back is never good sleep
MON 9:08 PM
If and when you are up to it, I'd love to see.
MON 9:08 PM
How was your Monday
MON 9:08 PM
Yeah, that is often rough. It's jarring to me to jump back into it.
MON 9:08 PM
I'm often late up and night worried about the next day. The weekend has far less of that.
MON 9:09 PM
I will take new pictures tomorrow but I have these from yesterday
MON 9:09 PM
Cool.

The purple room is now gray too
MON 9:09 PM
Wow!
MON 9:10 PM
I love the color and the floors.
MON 9:10 PM
[[UJ]] got the trim up in [[L]]’s room —I need to touch it up
MON 9:10 PM
How are the kitty cats liking it?
MON 9:11 PM
I think ours prefer the carpet because they can sink their claws into it.
MON 9:11 PM
But, I'd take that beautiful flooring any day for appearance, feel, and cleaning.
MON 9:12 PM
Yeah it cleans pretty well and is water proof
MON 9:12 PM
It was fairly easy to put down —I was looking for something low maintenance and pet/lundy proof :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
MON 9:13 PM
Oh, my Monday's been productive. I'm working hard on a request from a friend. Trying to define [[Power]], and it's sending me down a bunch of rabbitholes. Currently working on this terrifying book "The 48 Laws of Power" (which is basically a neo-Machiavellian training manual).
MON 9:13 PM
Oooo that could be lots of rabbit holes
MON 9:14 PM
Aye. Turns out defining [[Awe]] and [[Love]] is way easier, lol.
MON 9:15 PM
I can see that
MON 9:15 PM
Power can be defined differently depending on the person or the situation...
MON 9:16 PM
Yeah, it's broader and harder to generalize and crystallize so far. Will continue hammering.
MON 9:17 PM
How's [[UJ]] and [[AG]] doing?
MON 9:17 PM
Good good —tired but good
MON 9:17 PM
I think I'm annoying [[AG]] a bit knocking on her message box door, so I'll ask you. Her formal is coming up here soon, yeah?
MON 9:18 PM
I bet [[UJ]] is tired, working at school then at home on the floors and walls with you.
MON 9:18 PM
Yes the 19th —her phone is likely dead and mia
MON 9:18 PM
How'd his dissertation go btw? He pass?
MON 9:18 PM
I can’t even get her to text the guy she’s going with
MON 9:19 PM
I'll have to see about doing a dance thing for mine as well. I, uh, have a hard time connecting with many of the homeschool groups in my area. We're on different wavelengths or something.
MON 9:19 PM
She's probably shy.
MON 9:19 PM
Went good —he has a few edits but defended and did great
MON 9:19 PM
Noice.
MON 9:19 PM
Congratz to him.

A perfect pose.
MON 9:21 PM
Posted on Facebook—the pic made [[JRE]] laugh so I thought I would share
MON 9:21 PM
It’s a yearbook picture hehe
MON 9:21 PM
Aye, I remember you showing it to me. It fits many occasions though.
MON 9:22 PM
Should make something out of that picture, embalm it.
MON 9:23 PM
Yes seemed like the best one for this occasion—better than the bagpipes one anyway
