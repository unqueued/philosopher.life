title: 2018.02.09 - Computer Musings: Seedbox Tweaking

I'm not sure why deluge web-ui worked before but not now. However, I found a way to get it back online, which is good. I prefer to xirvik's instead of pushing .torrent files (I'm willing to do either though).

Installed vpncloud on my computer after editing PKGBUILD. It worked on one machine, but not another. I left a comment on the AUR forum.

Edit the PKGBUILD for version 0.8.1, and delete example line. I had to use `rustup default nightly` for installation.<<ref "2020.02.09">>

I've created an account on the AUR and sent an e-mail to the maintainer. I think I may become a maintainer if he doesn't update it.

See [[vpncloud.rs]]
