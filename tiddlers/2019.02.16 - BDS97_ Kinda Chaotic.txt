[11:55:05] h0p3: How's life going for you?
[11:55:41] BDS97: home: hi
[11:55:45] BDS97: home: kinda chaotic, but quite well, thanks
[11:55:48] BDS97: home: how about you?
[11:56:32] h0p3: Reading and writing, working with my kids and those in the afterschool program. Busy, but good.
[11:57:20] h0p3: Have you made decisions for work?
[11:58:36] BDS97: home: yeah, freelancing looks like it'll work out
[11:58:40] h0p3: Noice
[11:58:55] BDS97: home: actually, I'm setting up a server for a client right now, so it works for now at least
[12:02:26] h0p3: You set it all up from scratch for em?
[12:03:14] BDS97: home: yeah, I'm still not the best at handling Kubernetes, although that's a thing I'd like to learn in the short term
[12:03:32] h0p3: Makes sense. I know nothing on that front.
[12:03:34] BDS97: home: and this is just a temporary server, so it's just a simple VPS with a bunch of databases, Redis, and NodeJS on it
[12:04:26] BDS97: home: would be much simpler with kubernetes, it would be a few yaml files, and the redis and db setup could be automated
[12:04:31] BDS97: home: but that's for the future
[12:05:37] BDS97: home: as for atropos btw, I've been doing some brainstorming, it looks like layer 1 and 2 are going to be fused together
[12:06:01] BDS97: home: or separated at a different point, I don't know yet
[12:06:45] h0p3: Hm. Why is that?
[12:06:49] BDS97: home: wanted to send you the layer 1 spec already, but some challenges popped up with that
[12:06:59] BDS97: home: so, for example the control of the tunnels
[12:07:24] BDS97: home: you need to be able to continue a tunnel from the end of another tunnel
[12:07:45] BDS97: home: otherwise, the anonymity factor would be reducded to one hop, and that's not really enough
[12:08:14] BDS97: home: then there was something around the crypto, basically while designing the previous system I forgot xsalsa20 is a stream cipher and needs a nonce
[12:08:53] BDS97: home: which is completely solvable without any additional overhead, but this way layer 1 will dictate the nonce of layer 2
[12:09:20] BDS97: home: so maybe the entire routing should just be shifted to layer 2
[12:09:50] BDS97: home: anyway, I don't think I'm making a lot of sense here, it's kinda under the hood stuff, and that's exactly what I haven't sent to you yet
[12:11:40] h0p3: I can see the bricks, but I don't see the building yet (which is totally fine!).
[12:13:11] h0p3: Just from an aesthetic (form) point of view, which isn't function, I found 4 layers to be beautiful. That is likely irrelevant. I will come to understand it.
[12:13:46] BDS97: home: for me, it makes sense because of the separation of concerns
[12:14:34] BDS97: home: that's why I don't know yet how this will be handled, because both of these solutions require deeper interaction between layer 1 and 2
[12:14:44] BDS97: home: maybe there's a cleaner cutoff point somewhere else
[12:15:13] BDS97: home: I don't want any single layer to be too complex either, that would be a bit harder on maintainability
