title: 2018.03.08 -- Prompted Introspection Log: My Appearance

!! How do you feel about your appearance?

When I think about appearances, my gut reaction is that they are dumb. Do I think that about my appearance? Generally, yes, I do. However, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I have an aesthetic preference. I think I'm more likely to express my aesthetic interests when I'm alone. I avoid playing a redpilled game with others in this respect, at least insofar as I can. 

When I am in public spheres, I must maintain an acceptable appearance so as not to offend and perhaps to even be allowed entry into the society around me. There are various social spheres that require it. It's a signal, a social password of the tribe. I am forced to signal to these creatures.

Also, my belly is getting fatter even though the rest of me isn't. It runs in the family. I suppose some of my appearances actually demonstrate something about my health to me. Those are signals I care about. 

I do care about whether or not my wife finds me attractive or at least easy to be around. If I smelled bad, for example, I wouldn't want to impose that on her. I am a slave to her approval in that respect, but I choose to be (yeah, Libertarians, I said that).
