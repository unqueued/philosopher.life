[8:00 PM] chameleon:
Irrigators channel waters;
fletchers straighten arrows;
carpenters shape wood;
the wise master themselves.
[8:00 PM] chameleon: Buddha quote for public self modelling?
[10:13 AM] h0p3: It's beautiful. I like that it picks out the difference between mere virtue of the practice and practices universally worth our time.
[10:15 AM] h0p3: There are sections of Plato and Aristotle which say the same in trying to flesh out how the pursuit of wisdom is a different from the other arts or mathematics.
[10:16 AM] h0p3: Stoicism seems to be concerned with mastering ourselves in virtue of having mastered what it is that we can even master about ourselves.
[10:20 AM] h0p3: One thing I'm interested in is a kind of Hegelian (though many talk about it) understanding of how our identities extend into the world (e.g. [[monster-16]] is sublationally part of my identity), and so the quote takes on its fuller meaning in recognizing that mastering ourselves is also part of mastering our extension into the world.
[10:21 AM] h0p3: One of my problems with the quote is this though: someone can be an evil master of themselves.
[10:21 AM] chameleon: an evil genius?
[10:23 AM] h0p3: I'm not claiming you have to be a genius, though a genius can. What it means to master oneself might be something which scales with our capacity to do so, particularly if you take who we are, essentially, to be the sum or emergences or dispositions of the choices which were up to us.
[10:23 AM] h0p3: (bringing us back to the stoic problem in a way)
[10:24 AM] h0p3: The wise and the unwise can possibly master themselves. I agree the wise always master themselves though.
[10:24 AM] chameleon: feel like I got a free antipleonism analysis here, thanks! lots to think about
[10:24 AM] chameleon: mind if I cop this for my wiki?
[10:25 AM] h0p3: It's going into mine too! Of course, lol. :slight_smile:
[10:25 AM] chameleon: hehe, thanks ^^
[10:26 AM] chameleon: I still don't put many of my IM convos on my wiki. I did it once with something that seemed on topic, though: https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.08.29%20-%20the%20death%20of%20a%20waifuist
[10:26 AM] h0p3: Aye.
[10:28 AM] h0p3: I don't know how important your chatlogs are to you. You could weave them into a private version of the wiki and export a public out of it. It is likely the case you have more public/private considerations to weigh, understandably.
[10:29 AM] chameleon: as much as anything, a lot of them are pretty trivial chatter that I don't think are really worth putting out there, y'know
