title: 2018.10.10 - BAGD: Juggle Priorities

One of the skills of growing up is learning to juggle priorities. There are 10,000 things to do, and one of them is figuring out how to do the other 9,999 of them in the right order. Triage. You have to be inductive, and you have to know where and how to focus (and why, etc.). As much as I rail against Capitalism, I think knowing how to maximize your personal productivity in a healthy way is necessary, valuable, and something that you will enjoy. It's part of being autonomous! You must weigh yourselves.
