[8:12 AM] h0p3: ROLFMAO! :slight_smile:
[8:12 AM] h0p3: That is awesome.
[8:23 AM] h0p3: Into [[WWDD]] with this one.
[8:24 AM] h0p3: Thank you! Also, sorry I'm taking forever on my letters. It's a process.
[8:26 AM] h0p3: I'm still reading. Feels like you've been offline more since moving. I assume it's still a whirlwind for you (it would be for me).
[2:16 PM] chameleon: Hehe, saw that meme and thought of you instantly =w=.
I think I might be, yeah. Still getting used to everything here
