title: 2018.01.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: Ideal President

!! Who is your ideal presidential candidate?

Ideal for whom? Me? Surely the goal is justice in general. I will assume you mean ideal for humanity.

That is a tough one. It's like you are asking me to re-write Plato's //Statesmen// and //Republic//. I'm not qualified to answer the question. I'm working on it though.

To me, one does not merely elect a president, but an entire wing of staff and logistics. You are electing an executive branch. You can have the ideal president, but without the right staff, he may, in fact, be wildly worse than what we have now (although, that is hard to imagine). 

I think the question should really be asking: "what is the ideal executive branch?" or something like that. And, again, I am unqualified to answer.

Unfortunately, when I keep going down that rabbithole, I run the risk of extending the question to governments in general. There is also a huge difference when I contextualize its framing. What makes an ideal statesman right now may different than 20 years ago, etc. 

Of course, if we are going to achieve anything meaningful, we at least have to attempt to generalize. Particularism to a fault gives us no heuristic. The ideally practical or practically ideal is what we really mean then, right? 

Ah, well, then I will attempt to generalize (but, again, I am not qualified):

* Statesmen must be tested for Dark Triad Spectrum Disorders. High empathy is a requirement.
* Statesmen must be extremely knowledgeable and intelligent. 
* Statesmen must be talented philosophers. 
* Statesmen must excel at standing behind the Veil of Ignorance (again, an empathy check in justice determinations)

Part of the problem, of course, is that any Statesman who met these qualifications would never be elected, and they'd be a lame duck if they were. Essentially, they will need to be manipulative given the right justifications. There doesn't seem to be a way around it. You must fight evil with evil, nazis and ax-murderers at your doorstep with lies, etc. But, justification is extremely hard to produce.

Alright, that's the best I can do for now.
