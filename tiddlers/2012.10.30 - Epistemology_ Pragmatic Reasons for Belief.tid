title: 2012.10.30 - Epistemology: Pragmatic Reasons for Belief

From page 172 on Kelly, I am certainly struck by the (equivalent) questions: “Can the expected consequences of holding a belief make a difference to whether it is rational to hold that belief?” and “Can practical considerations ever rationalize the holding of a belief?”

Kelly explains that “with respect to beliefs, rationality just is epistemic rationality.”





I’m not sur

“that a belief X will or will not have practical benefits does not motivate, result in, or cause one to believe or abandon belief in X”





Perhaps I’ve really misunderstood your argument. I don’t intend to strawman, and if I do, please correct me.

I don’t know if Smith is “ignoring evidence” in the first case. From what I can see, he’s not taken the time to reflect and infer that this boat going north should be taken as evidence. The ability to ignore evidence seems to border upon doxastic voluntarism, which I’m not yet convinced is something you mean to defend.

I've sympathies for your divisions: rationality, responsibility (rightness, blameworthiness, etc.), and goodness. Rationality, at least on these divisions, seems to be shrunk down (from what we usually might think of it as) into a kind of mere inferential thinking, right? Given what evidence one does have, and without reference to any responsibility, we can determine the rationality of a belief/choice (at least theoretically) by examining the inferential steps one takes. I take you to be saying something like: as long as one takes truth-preserving inferential steps, one is being rational. Again, I’ve got similar inclinations, but I don’t know if I can completely agree.

As you anticipated, my worry is that responsibility and rationality can't be peeled apart so nicely. Of course, I think we both already agree that in most cases we are responsible for being rational. The issue is whether or not the requirements of rationality include following certain duties. Note that making inferences is a type of evidence gathering. Rationality seems to include a responsibility to make proper inferences, essentially to gather evidence is right way. Apart from gathering evidence in the right sort of way, it seems likely to me that rationality might also include the responsibility to gather enough evidence or a certain amount of evidence (which I take you to be denying).

Consider this terribly oversimplified way of thinking (I already see several problems with it, but I think I can get my point across with this still):

P1. Act n from that “n is worth i utility,” where i is the highest utility.

P2. X1 is worth 5 utility (this qualifies for P1)

P3. X2 is worth 10 more utility than X1 (this does not, by itself and without further inference, qualify for P1)

P4. X3 is worth 15 more utility than X1 (same as P3’s comment)

C1. X2 is worth 15 utility (inferred from 2, 3, and some other assumptions about logic/mathematics/predicates)

C2. 15 is the highest utility of the “n is worth i utility” (inferred from 1-5, etc.)

C3. Act X2 (inferred from 1 and 6, etc.)

Clearly, all the steps were rational, at least on a narrow definition, as all inferences appear to be truth-preserving. The problem is that we’ve ignored P4, and we decided not to gather more evidence specific to P4 via inference. On the narrow definition of rationality, we could have rationally arrived at the conclusion to Act X3 if we had only decided to seek more evidence and to continue drawing inferences, but we aren’t being irrational (on the narrow definition) when we don’t.

If I understand your argument correctly, we might argue that this person’s way of thinking is rational, yet irresponsible because one should have sought more evidence. Somehow this doesn’t sit right with me. I want to say that not making the inference about P4 was, at least to some extent, not rational. The steps were right there! This guy wasn’t thinking straight (and not just because he assumed utilitarianism in P1 :P). Despite making reasonable inferences, this manner of thought just isn’t reasonable enough.

It seems to me that merely making truth-preserving inferences isn’t sufficient for rationality. Ensuring some level of difficulty of inferences, making sure to gather a certain level of evidence, seems to be a necessary aspect of being rationality. The validity of inferences can’t be the only responsibility within rationality; a responsibility to have a certain depth and breadth of inferences and evidence has to be a part of that rationality. Rationality, otherwise, seems too weak.

But, Smith might just be doing the same, right? He chose not to reflect, to gather more evidence, or make these inferences about the boat and the direction of the beach. We might argue that he was so irresponsible, he failed to meet the degree-of-evidence-gathering-duties required to be rational in this respect, that we should call him rational in this respect.
