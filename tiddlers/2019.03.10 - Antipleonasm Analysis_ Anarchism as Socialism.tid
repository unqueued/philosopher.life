title: 2019.03.10 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Anarchism as Socialism

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The consistent anarchist, then, should be a socialist, but a socialist of a particular sort. He will not only oppose alienated and specialized labor and look forward to the appropriation of capital by the whole body of workers, but he will also insist that this appropriation be direct, not exercised by some elite force acting in the name of the proletariat.

Preach, yo! Who cannot see a powerful semblance of the truth of justice in these words? This is type 2 anarchism that aims to be categorical! The [[CI]] will not only compute the [[right]] [[end]], but also the completely [[right]] means to those ends. This is what maximum maxim validation looks like. I cannot speak highly enough of such a thing.

Do tell me, please, what is directness? I thought I knew, but my memory fails me constantly.

It turns out that the justified Rule of Law is an extremely hard problem in political philosophy, just as hard as the Criterion problem. Enforcement as retaliation is going to require bit-for-bit, hand-to-hand, gun-to-gun, battleship-to-battleship combat. There's no way around it. Those unwilling to go to war against evil have already lost it. How do you decentralize the construction and maintenance of the centralization of power [[irwartfrr]]? Democracy must grow arms, but how can we do this wisely?

The costs of retaliation can only be paid at a P2P level to some extent.<<ref "s">> Insofar as Federalism (into the [[SO]] [[infinigress]]) is conceptually required to solve specific computation problems, so too will we require elite and centralized retaliatory enforcement of [[The Golden Rule]]. Justified elitism is so hard to do, most remotely sane people I know consider it impossible; it's hard to find practical anecdata which gives us hope here (power tends to corrupt). Unfortunately, this problem doesn't go away no matter how much we will it into non-existence. There's a non-linear logic problem here we have to formalize as hard as we can and then ML for the empirical results of rationalist faith. I cannot solve it all by myself, but I can tell you that there are literal interpretations of your last phrase which conceptually cannot be correct. What am I to make of this?

In [[Straussian]] charity, I shall argue that you seek to justify governments qua the [[dok]] to which they decentralize power to whatever they possibly can be decentralized in their context. Insofar as you point us to the center of the [[good]]will in politics, I agree. Insofar as you think you've drawn the universal conceptual line, you have not succeeded. This is a crazy hard problem though. It's dialectically daunting. Too often, those who claim to be socialist have only been so in name. Too often, we do not build antifragility into our decentralization to stave off unjustified centralization [[irwartfrr]].

Thus, I suggest the line should read:

"but he will also insist that this appropriation be as direct as possible, not exercised by some elite force acting in the name of the proletariat anymore than is conceptually necessary."

Obviously, he is correct to be profoundly concerned with the centralization of power, especially as it is a convenient vice we take up as humans. It's so easy not to fulfill our obligations as political animals. The man is a prescient oracle.
