title: 2019.02.19 - Be A Good Dad: GPT2

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

Discussion began with GPT2, branched wildly. Hubert Dreyfus, memetic warfare, wisely constructing democracy in the 21st century, fundamental disagreement, engaging in systematic dialectics with milestones in [[The Great Human Conversation]], turing test concepts, the hard problem of consciousness, quantum relationships to mind, compatibilism, games, necessity of education, and what trust looks like.

Indeed, it will be difficult to use an internet largely constructed and deconstructed by GPT2 evolved bots (and perhaps eventually sentient AI).

My kids said they loved talking with me today. =)

I feel like I branch like lightning to give reflections of the elephant's foot. Hyperobjects can never be reduced enough.

Secondary discussion on the FOL differences between equality and equivalence.
