title: 2019.01.21 - Wiki Review: Conmigo

* [[2019.01.20 - Family Log: Late]]
** The amount of age-inappropriate emoji is inappropes.
* [[2019.01.20 - /b/]]
** My daughter would laugh at that. Would he?
* [[2019.01.16 - Jop: Keeping Up]]
** I'm proud of her (from afar, and I don't mean to be all patronizing about it...I know what it means for her to be building these habits in her context).
* [[2019.01.20 - Jop: Cool]]
** I've been saying I like half the kids and no one else.
* [[2019.01.16 - AA: Reading Slower]]
** There are many words on the screen.
* [[2019.01.17 - AA: She Read]]
** No response though.
* [[2019.01.20 - Sphygmus: Desert Tag]]
** I wish I started searching earlier. I've been feeling swamped (what's new?).
* [[2019.01.20 - AA: Weehoo]]
** She is a woman in pain. She is climbing out of the pit. `/salute`
* [[2019.01.15 - K: Classes]]
** Yeah, I'm pretty cool, man. I can say the word "lit" like young people do these days.
* [[2019.01.16 - K: Goodday, Sir]]
** I like how he knows I'm testing for it (even if I'm doing a poor job).
* [[2019.01.17 - K: Appear]]
** That is generous of him. It's weird that he would read something that his wife would not in this case.
* [[2019.01.18 - K: Read The Letter]]
** He continues to initiate. I'm surprised! I'm grateful.
* [[2019.01.20 - K: Cancel School]]
** I've seen more of his snappy humor lately. I like that.
* [[2019.01.16 - L: D&D]]
** It's weird to see how she compares friends and family. I'm sad to see how she seeks approval in her friends (especially from the game my brother played with her).
* [[2019.01.20 - L: Hey, You]]
** Brain vomit line is a keeper. =)
* [[2019.01.20 - JRE: Palsy]]
** This one was special to me. I tried explaining to the kids. I'm probably the only other person that remembers it first personally.
* [[2019.01.16 - T-Money: Bittersweet]]
** He has a particular kind of existential crisis, imho.
* [[2019.01.19 - T-Money: Antipleonasm]]
** I was surprised by that image. What does it mean to him?
* [[2019.01.17 - Sho: Catpix]]
** Seems like we are back to saying little to each other. =(
* [[2019.01.17 - Tasha: > replying]]
** Edited type.
* [[2019.01.16 - Sapphomo: Response]]
** A billion things.
* [[2019.01.15 - Sapphomo: First Contact]]
** Sorry. 
* [[Sapphomo]]
** I've not responded yet.
* [[2019.01.14 - Sphygmus: Persistant Identity]]
** That is a kaleidescope of thoughts. I wish she wasn't scared to read her own writing; I worry she doesn't recognize the dignity of her honesty with herself. I feel that pain. I want to be encouraging and useful to her.
* [[2019.01.16 - Sphygmus: The Letter]]
** It was a hard letter to write. I'm lucky to have someone thinking out loud with me about it.
* [[2019.01.17 - Sphygmus: Studio]]
** I'm taking forever, as usual. I'm grateful that she is so understanding about it.
* [[2019.01.18 - Sphygmus: Stickers]]
** For the record, I do not put stickers on anything. My Lian-Li cases are the opposite (Apple fanbois have no fucking clue what hawtness is). But, I want to remember [[Sphygmus]] when I work on my wiki.
* [[2019.01.19 - Sphygmus: All Over]]
** I adore how [[Sphygmus]] doesn't chase the market. She makes art from the heart (and, plus, I like her art).
* [[2019.01.20 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Suffer No Slaves]]
** Mom's spa-peggy-and-meatballs.
* [[2019.01.20 - Prompted Introspection: Inspiration]]
** Locution
* [[2019.01.20 - Wiki Review: Pulsey Today]]
** I'm still feeling super torn. [[The Remodeling]] has to get done. I don't want to disappoint [[Sphygmus]]. Her work has kicked butt, and I know I'm slow. I'm just not as fast as she is at shaping the mechanical aspects of my wiki.
* [[2019.01.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Roast It]]
** Completed.
* [[j3d1h: Entity]]
** [[PH]]ed it.
** He has seen this site before, and he's looking forward to getting to know me. Well, I hope to get to know him too. He seems to make my daughter happy (a necessary puzzle piece).
* [[2019.01.20 - Meditation: Alrighty]]
** Am I a pansy? Lol. Maybe. I hope it will lower my blood pressure.
* [[2019.01.20 - Computer Musings: Power]]
** I am grateful to have so much technology available to me.
* [[2019.01.20 - TDL: MLK]]
** Nailed it.
** Turned out to be a much better day than I predicted.
* [[Meditation]]
** I did it. I have something rolling. It's small, it's probably shitty, but it's something! =)
