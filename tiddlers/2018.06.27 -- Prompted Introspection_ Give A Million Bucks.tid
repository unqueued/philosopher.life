title: 2018.06.27 -- Prompted Introspection: Give A Million Bucks

!! If you won a million dollars but had to give it all away, who would you give it to and why?

Give it all away to whom? Can I just give it to my wife? Let's assume I'm not allowed to even indirectly benefit to a sufficient [[dok]] threshold of your choosing, whatever that may mean.

I'd create a foundation of people I trust to use the 1 million dollars to pay for bounties to developers for piecing together [[Outopos]]. We need a blockchain built on generating one Golden Rule-based currency: Trust itself. You should mine for others' [[T42T]] cooperative trust, developing highly coordinated communities, and building the technological backbone necessary to institute [[The Original Position]].

I think bounties would need to demonstrate they could follow certain rules. The Foundation would need to vote consistently to regulate itself or how they spend the money. Decentralizing the Foundation at political, economical, geographic, and technical levels would be a fundamental goal.
