title: 2019.11.06 - Afterschool Teaching: Exhausting

Carson asked me for my thoughts on a particular case at daycare. I suggested she wait for a pattern before taking the next step. She's possibly found a friend to take my spot. She agreed the hiring practice here is too hidden (by design in my view). Her adopted uncle has died, and it's been really hard on her. She's holding back tears today.

Celery is dead. We're doing what we can.

One-on-ones were more difficult today. I've had a lot of angry and sad students today. I spent a chunk of time defining kindness with several. A lot of the younger students asked to come with me, but it's not up to me. I'd like to give them lab time, but people are too concerned with protecting their innocence to allow them around the 6-8th graders.

5AN says I am a walking Google. I'm a dork, of course, but I think it's mostly because I take her questions seriously. I wish she would pay more attention when I say: "I don't know" and "you need to look that up." We talked about boredom. It's an interesting thing to be interested in.

I took my kids to the library today. Homework completed, some folks read, nobody wanted to play games. Unfortunately, 6KA decided to play hardball. Took an hour in the corner to break him. The boy is exhausting. It's been a day of teaching 12yo boys how to apologize. Spoons well spent in the end.

I have a much easier time with people who are kind; they can walk all over me and the set of school rules which I find immoral when they do. 6KS, my new kid, is sharp as a tack. She appreciates what I'm trying to buy her, and overtows the line for it. I'm lucky to have students who realize that playing by rules makes for a good time. It's nice to even have a few that tell me they are sorry for what I put up with; my hoods among them ("my momma would have beat my ass if I did that, you're lucky he's only putting you in the corner" etc.).

Some girls asked me if I'm straight. We talked about spectrums. They were unhappy with my insistence. 

8G has finally given up. She decided to hard reset her phone. Poor thing. She seemed okay with it afterward. Tons of my kids have old phones with no service. I have many ideas of how to preserve their right to access the internet at the school, but I can't afford to do it right.
