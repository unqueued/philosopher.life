title: 2018.10.10 - Wiki Audit: Tags

[[Sphygmus]] has pointed out how unergonomic tagpills can be with over 50 tiddlers tagged (especially for ordering). She's right. 

<<tag Vault>> is going to be a ridiculous monster, likely thousands. Who's going to click that button and live? Half the fucking wiki technically belongs in {[[Vault]]}. Ought I just move to directories, monthly audits, etc.? Big collections can be vaulted, but should the atoms?

What is that going to mean for how I ought to tag? Some tags are going to be HUGE on this wiki. I really feel like I need to go take some mistakes (though not all of them, right?) and figure out how to fix them afterward. It's clear that I can't see far enough, so I'm just going to overextend. Why not go hogwild here?

[[footnote-converter.py]] in the works. Setting aside papers until then. SKIP begins at: [[2010.08.26 - Degrees of Inference]]

I have a real problem with dating correctly, lol.

---

Correcting proper naming convention errors. Awesome. I'm proud to see I had been trying to generate pseudonymity from the beginning.

---

Holy fuck. Going through my <<tag [[Log Audit]]>> is intense...I'm all over the place...thus [[TW: Cheatsheet]]

---

I like being able to keep my original names in the tiddler titles while collectively renaming the entire thing in my tags. This is excellent! It shows the evolution of my thinking on the top while still allowing me to group for automation with tags.

---

Since this isn't private, I get to use grammarly, etc. Slurp away, you pieces of shit. =)

---

This is intensely emotional for me. Looking back at how fucking far I've come. The amount of work, the lunacy of it, the idiotic hardknocks, the babysteps, etc. are overwhelming to me. 

---

Not in love with `Wiki:` [[titletag]]. I need that for things which I don't immediately know where the belong, where they come from, etc. I need it for context. I shouldn't need a titletag for anything directly about some mechanic of this wiki, right?

I'm actually completing monthly audits, minus [[2017.01 - Pipefitting Log]], which has been made one of the [[Relics]].
