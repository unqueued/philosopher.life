title: 2017.11.14 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Mother's Geographic Heritage

!! What state or country what was your mother raised in?

Milwaukee, Wisconsin between 1963 and 1981. Standard regional cultural markers apply, in addition to stereotypes: dairy, polka, bowling, beer, boiling everything, GBPackers, etc. She's 100% Polish. Well-to-do-ish but insane family; in addition to my donor, my immigrant Great Depression era great-grandmother was the only other decent human being of the lot.<<ref "1">> The usual expressions of Slavic psychopathy can be found running through her upbringing.<<ref "2">> 

Her accent dissipated quickly (with a few leftover artifacts), but you can still hear it strongly enough in her extended family. Without directly doxxing her, the first half of her hyphenated last name is one of the few remaining obvious clues of this heritage.

<<footnotes "2" "She didn't escape this expression either, although her mask is quite elaborate, truly educated, shaped by her faith, better justified, and more forgiveable.">>
