I'd like for a moment, in the spirit of Mark 9:38-41, to pause and worship with you.

> May the Good God of all that is Right and Beautiful be exalted. We give You thanks and praise for the Light You have sent into the world. May our words and meditations be pleasing to You and may the blueprints of the Kingdom form the pattern of our conversation.

You've written (in the Good):

>    The Good, however, generates a subset of itself targeting the finite architectures and contextual particularities of each of our minds. Essentially, there is always a uniquely fitting implementation of The Good for every creature because The Good contextualizes itself. Perfect infinite theoretical wisdom must reduce itself to the fitting finite practical wisdom for mere mortals.

Given that this is true, why reject the contextualized aspect of the Good as it has been given us? I'm referring to your insistent de-personalization of the Deity. If the ideal outworking of the Law is empathy, why do you not empathize with the Spirit whom you grieve by robbing Him of Personhood?

Maybe you do not want to risk building graven images? You've no doubt seen many of those who would be guilty of thinking He was altogether like us! Maybe you distinguish yourself from the simple who believe every word, thus you prudently consider your steps. Your doubt is rooted in good. Your moral receptors are sensitive and functioning, but what to make of your divine prosopagnosia; your inability to cry out "Abba! Father!"?

> If you are interested in telling me, [[W5H]] did you convert?

I was baptized in a Catholic church as a baby and attended a Sunday school at a Presbyterian church until I was ten or eleven. My mom came from a Christian family (her grandfather converted in China) and, growing up in Malaysia, she and her large family were often helped by a local Presbyterian group, leaving her with positive emotions towards the denomination. I think it is important that I don't neglect to share the generally favourable Christian context I grew up in, even if we weren't actively practicing for many years.

In my early teens I started reading Naomi Klein (No Logo and Shock Doctrine) which lead me into anti-corporatism, and then eventually Zeitgeist-ism. I developed some contempt for Christianity, which I associated with Bush-era American imperialism, and, being a mystic, viewed the Yahweh of the Word as a sort of usurper of the Goddess of the Image's proper place. I didn't actually know any earnest believers to measure my impressions against except for one bible-thumping con-man who I only met infrequently. 

When I was 21, I found someone on Youtube making a positive case for Christianity, and because he seemed both thoughtful and sincere, I was intrigued. I was familiar with the basic doctrines already, but the internet opened up an avenue to explore the personal consequences of the faith in a way I had not seen before. 

I knew enough at the time to realize that 'belief' in something must be grounded in something that was demonstrably plausible, and that it ought to have consequences in the way I ordered my reasoning and practice. I also can't deny the role emotion and fear played in moving me in the direction of belief as I found myself increasingly worried that if anything like the God of the Bible existed, my current lifestyle choices were not aligned with Its principles. I wrestled for months with unease until I gave up one night, face down in my room, and spoke with the God Jesus presents as 'Our Father', asking me to take Him as His own.

What followed were weeks of a sort of disorientated joy. Circles of love for others were being drawn increasingly larger, habits of sin (traditionally defined) were violently rooted out of my life, and then commenced the beginnings of a pattern of prayer and answer.

Obviously the issue of cherry-picking for my bias comes into play here. I've certainly had many unanswered prayers, and there are many ambiguous situations I may well have interpreted in favour of theism.<<ref "f">>

But actually, as much as I fear my power to select memories in favour of my bias, I've seen direct answers to prayers often enough that, if I have to doubt, I doubt in the direction of reality maybe being constructed along the lines of some kind of The Secret notion. Which would just be awful. Awful!

> Any story you can tell as a theist I can translate as a deist.

Ok, but why? Assuming you can account for truth-telling, reliability of memory, etc...Why would a slew of personal stories of prayer being improbably answered, sometimes hours later, not count in favour of a listening/responsive deity? I know three ex-Muslims, two who are close friends, whose conversions were catalyzed by visions of Christ. Why pull back the goalposts when a visible emanation of the deity manifests? Yes, a fair coin can land heads fifty times in a row, but what reasons might you have to not check to see if the game is rigged? I'm not asking you to //apologize for contemporary Christianity// sharing milkshakes with Mammon at the Hamusement park, but are there other expressions of the ancient faith out there?

I just came back from the States meeting up with friends from a Christian charitable organization I'm involved with. Some of them are missionaries, others are involved in practical expressions of love which include helping guide sustainable farming development, building safe house networks, and many other good things where poverty forces people to rely on God in ways we rich folk rarely have to, and they tell of ways that He moves and reveals patterns that can't simply be chalked up to good luck or good planning. 

> Every ounce of evidence you have requires no personal interaction; it could all have been set into motion by anything. It appears functionally reducible, and I'm worried it is hubris to think one could see that far into the noumena to know. I don't see why you will ever have public or private evidence of a personal relationship with a theistic God, not even for yourself.

Am I claiming to know that much? My models of the world have had countless re-iterations, and I expect to continue updating for as long as I refuse to prize cynicism. As for evidence, I'm not sure we could even have a real conversation about that as you seem to have rejected the notion of epistemic possibly-ness for this entire category of subjects. If there is no evidence you will ever allow, then I'm afraid I'm just a poor sparrow of the field colliding with your spotless, but closed, window.

> More fundamentally, it is not clear to me that examination isn't a form of engagement, but I'd like to know why you think you are engaged any further than I am

Thank you for provoking me to exercise caution here. I don't want to make assumptions, in my arrogance, that devalue what you've learned and experienced.

I'm not sure the allusion to a linear journey as implied by terms like 'further' are always helpful as they suggest that there is a common route we all take where such measurements are meaningful. Instead, I like to think we're all either oriented towards or away from the Good (embodied in Christ) and that part of our duty to one another is simply to strengthen and particularize that orientation, regardless of our starting point (which could be all over the map). 

Anyway, forgive me for my imperfect addressals. Please don't think this is a burden to me, I very much enjoy it, and I'm glad we're both in a position to respect each other's busy-ness and responsibilities.

In sincerity and brotherly love,

Ivan

<<footnotes "f" "Early in my faith, I was looking for other believers, since I had no Christian friends at the time. I met some guys my age at a church and was invited to their place. On my way there, in the metro, I was approached by guy named Vito; unremarkable except for hisbrilliant sea-blue eyes, telling me I must be filled with the Holy Spirit (with little preceding context). After a short exchange where he pressed this one idea, my train came, and we split. It was the highlight of my day because hanging out with those Christian guys afterwards was so so disappointing! I don't want to rag on them too much, they were hospitable, but in pious terms, they lacked that bleeding desire for righteousness and justice. I later interpreted that event as God sending me Vito to present me with the case for a 'higher' life else I be disillusioned with my first social interaction with flesh and blood Christians.">>
