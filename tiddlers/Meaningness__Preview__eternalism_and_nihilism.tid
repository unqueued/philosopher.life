title: Meaningness: Preview: eternalism and nihilism

<<<
Eternalism and nihilism are the simplest, and most extreme, stances toward meaningness.

* Eternalism says that everything has a definite, true meaning.
* Nihilism says that nothing really means anything.

Both these stances are wrong, factually. They are also unworkable, in their implications for living.
<<<

Strong words. You're bold. Sounds like you are selling something. =) This looks like an epic strawman. I do not wield the word "fact" lightly (it's a technical word for me). Unworkability, of course, is also not a defeating argument against either.

Here you go bro:

* Everything has a meaning.
* Nothing has a meaning.
* Some (but not all) things have a meaning.

Logically, those are your only options. 

They are all quite extreme and simple appearing. I worry, however, that just because these propositions appear simple that you want to shuffle away any approach to explaining and justifying them as being "simple." Far from it. As I discussed in the last section, you clearly have not been careful in understanding how to talk about eternal meaning (which I consider the harder horn of the dichotomy to interpret).

I'd like, up front, your opinion on the meaning of logic. Tell me, do you think "a=a" is logically true in all possible worlds? Do you think it contains any normative content whatsoever? If you are going to make sweeping generalizations here, I need to first know I'm not dealing with someone who relativizes logic when it is convenient for them. I'm not going to engage in a fancy dance with you.

<<<
However, almost everyone falls into them at times, triggered by particular contexts. Each stance is based on genuine insights, and a powerful, emotionally appealing pattern of thinking. They also can seem to be the only possible alternatives, so we are forced into one by the repulsive qualities of the other.
<<<

I want to know what you mean by "genuine." You agree these insights have meaning. Tell me about how that meaning is meaningful. 

I disagree on the repulsion as the sole motivating argumentative force. It seems that people clearly can be attracted to one and not merely fleeing the other.

<<<
Confused stances are resolved by dissolving their fixations and accepting what they deny. Specific “antidotes” or counter-thoughts are available that help with this...Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness.
<<<

Poison-thoughts. You have my attention. Counterproofs and healing viruses to our malware are important. Obviously you are touching on our desire for confidence, if not outright certainty, in normative meaning. You want to release us of this burden. I get it. Soothing words, no doubt. But, do you actually solve the problem? I will require an explanation of the dimensionality of meaningness. You are telling me what it isn't, which is fine. Contrast is crucial. But, you also need to have an account for it (although, I don't expect perfection here, obviously).

<<<
 Meaning is important enough that this uncertainty is emotionally unacceptable.
<<<

What an odd phrase. "Important," of course, is just another word for meaningful, i.e. Meaning is meaningful enough. Note the difference between the two:

# //X is //meaningful, and I find uncertainty in its meaning to be emotionally unacceptable.
# //Meaning as a concept which obtains in reality is //meaningful, and I find uncertainty in its meaning to be emotionally unacceptable.

Being wrong about what is meaningful is entirely different from being wrong about there being meaning at all. I find that many people have made the mistake of conflating the two above. Are you sure you are talking about the latter?

<<<
Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness. It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity. See also fixation, another defense.
<<<

Meaning is definitionally fixated. Meanings can come and go, perhaps, but that just means (I'm sorry, I don't have another word) the fixations come and go. It's part of the structure of a meaning to be fixated. It's a functional relationship between at least two objects. Meaning is computed. It has to have a deterministic element to it to be meaning at all. Why are you not talking about this? You are too skilled in your art not to know.

<<<
If meanings are objective, not human creations, it may seem they must come from some ultimate, transcendent source. In many systems, that is a God. In others, it is an abstraction, like Fate or Reason or the Absolute. These are supposed to provide the sole source of meaning, purpose, value, and ethics. I refer to any such source as an eternal ordering principle or Cosmic Plan.
<<<

Good. I'm glad you were specific.

<<<
Luckily, there is no eternal ordering principle, so eternalism is false as a fact-claim.
<<<

Luckily, the quote above is an eternal ordering principle of meaning, so eternalism is true as a fact-claim.

Oh, no, I like this one more:

Luckily, there is no eternal ordering principle which justifies the above quote, so eternalism is false as a fact-claim.

This is a terrible argument. I fear you are oversimplifying on purpose, like you are trying to hide the very problem itself under the rug. The problem of meaning is one of question begging par excellence. 

<<<
Arguments about that never seem to persuade anyone, however. So I take this hyper-atheism for granted, and instead ask: what are our options if eternalism is wrong?
<<<

Umm...No, you don't get to just "help yourself." You can request that we take up your assumptions for the sake of argument though. Let me charitably grant you that.

<<<
Here it is helpful to understand what works, and doesn’t work, about eternalism (and the other confused stances) emotionally, rather than in terms of truth.
<<<

You said the magic words. Appealing to my emotions, I think your eternal argument about eternalism is trash. You are presenting "truthiness" in your "meaningness" relativized just enough to conveniently capture what you want, but not accepting the consequences of it.

<<<
The appeal of eternalism is that questions of life-purpose and ethics have clear, simple answers. If you act in accordance with this Cosmic Plan, you are guaranteed a good outcome. You can be assured that seeming chaos and senseless misery are all orderly parts of the will of an all-good principle.
<<<

The gloves are off. You clearly aren't even trying to give "eternalism" a fair shake. You appear to equate every concept of it with some prosperity theism gospel. That's absurd, even from a theist's perspective! Who the fuck said eternalism offers clear, simple answer? You have completely missed the point. You're trying to make it sound dumb and oversimplistic, and you need to be steelmanning the argument instead. 

You need to define [[The Good]]. You don't get to just help yourself to it when you want it, buster. Right now, you are denying it.

<<<
In those situations, adopting the eternalist stance makes you think and act in ways that lead to big trouble.
<<<

See, you don't get to use the word "trouble" in a meaningful way unless you can define the normative content embedded in it. You have to have an exlanation, even if you only have a circular one (and then we infinigress, of course).

<<<
It is difficult to see how the suffering caused by earthquakes could be willed by a benevolent God, or meaningful, or anything other than disasters that just happened. The difficulty of maintaining willful blindness to meaninglessness is an obstacle to eternalism. It is hard not to fall into the confused stance that most things are God’s will, but not the bad bits. Once you admit that some things are meaningless, the logic of eternalism starts to fall apart.
<<<

Umm...Suffering is meaningful, even if only instrumentally. The Theodician's Jury is out on whether or not suffering is intrinsically meaningful (and you are in no position to deny them). Do you mean to say the opposite of [[The Good]] is meaningless by definition? That cannot be correct.

To say something is incorrect, wrong, or bad puts boundaries on what that thing is. It explains, at the very least, what it is not. That is a negative meaning. Now, you might say we need positive meaning, but we must be open to the possibility that all positive meanings can be reinterpreted in terms of negative meaning agglomerations. Object X is simply not object Y, Z, A, B, etc. Perhaps we don't have to give it any more than that to pick it out of our domain. Of course, that isn't a predicate. But, we can go negative on that as well: Object X simply doesn't have the properties Q, W, E, R, T, etc. Real objects have properties, right? Negative meaning is a meaning.

Thus, suffering, since it is bad, since it is explicitly not [[The Good]], is meaningful. It means something to us in our narratives. In fact, I suggest that Dasein's plight is conceptually bound to experiencing some degrees or types of suffering. 

To the extent the word "suffering" can be understood, it is meaningful. That's true by definition. Some of these stories are false, yes. We can be wrong, yes. Stories change, and the best understandings require jumping from one existential vortex to the next. You must pickup grand metanarratives and wield them until you find the next one. You can put one down without putting on another. There is no escaping this. That is Dasein's plight. Well, you are doomed to agree to one, even if you simply call that grand narrative "meaningness." There is no escaping it. Is there a grand metanarrative of the metanarratives? I cannot compute an infinigress, thus if I am to escape infinitely computing it, I must answer, yes. It's a bufferoverflow error or some fatal existential computing error not to. Aren't we already going to assume it is incorrect to just be stuck in a thoughtloop trying to solve it for the rest of our finite lives? You can only solve the problems that are possible for you to solve. The only answer to the question, "is there meaning?" requires having begged the question that there is meaning in the first place. This is the only practical option. 

Would you ask the question "is there meaning?" if you didn't want the answer? Note, of course, wanting the answer is already a kind of question begging here if you take that "desire" to really be you. What if the answer was impossible to achieve, or what if it took infinite computing power to answer it, or what if you must cross into NP-Hard problems or incompleteness to solve it, or what if you must cross the transcendental divide into metaphysics itself to have the answer? Do you agree "ought implies can?" If that is conceptually true (and it appears so), then you must agree that we cannot expect ourselves to come up with impossible answers. What then are the correct limits of possible answers? Maybe that varies per person, with each mind having its own limits. Fine. I'm willing to be fluid and contextualize hard fucking core, but there must be a principle for this, right? But, surely, you can see that the ultimate answer, since you agree there is an answer, must ultimately rest upon a foundation of external, objective meaning. You cannot escape the grandest of grand metanarratives of metanarraatives (second order): [[The Categorical Imperative]].

[[The Truth]], [[The Good]], [[The Categorical Imperative]], is impractical to us by definiton.

I'm done reading for now. I clearly have more in common with Spinoza that I could ever admit. It's time to dig into him.

---

I'm taking another try at it. It's clear that author intends to lambast the Judeo-Christian memeplex, and he does so correctly a large percentage of the time. He also clearly has no idea what I mean by Eternalism at all.

<<<
Nihilism starts from the intelligent recognition that eternalism is false and unworkable. Most events are meaningless; meaning is not objective; there is no Cosmic Plan.
<<<

He obviously sways this direction. He doesn't even take it to the Nth degree with "most" here. I appreciate where he is coming from though.

<<<
 Instead, nihilism uses intelligence against itself to produce stupidity. Somehow meaning must be explained away by intellectual sleight-of-hand.
<<<

I fear a man who gets eternalism wrong doesn't really get nihilism either. There is no stupidity on nihilism. It literally doesn't matter. Here's the author's problem, he just needs to call it: Contsruction and Deconstruction. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a construction which allows him to survive deconstruction.

I agree with a lot of what he's saying though. I appreciate he has taken the time to say it.

<<<
It’s common for people to switch between eternalism and nihilism repeatedly in the space of a few minutes. Once you start to see this pattern, and catch yourself doing it, it becomes funny.
<<<

Fair to say. With the amount of trash talk and strawmanning you've levied, you better have a damned good answer. 

<<<
The various “confused stances” discussed later in this book arise in this way. Each is a bargain in which we reluctantly acknowledge meaninglessness in some parts of life, deny it in others, and try to get the world to accept that. But it doesn’t; so every compromise causes new trouble, and fails...The wrong idea underlying all confused stances is that things must be either definitely meaningful or else effectively meaningless. Or, if meaning is not objective, it must be subjective. But these are not the only possibilities.
<<<

Teach me to compromise wisely, to go with the flow, master. I'm very interested to see your nomadic answer. I will be forever in your debt if you can show me The Way. I hate to warn you that even speaking of [[The Good]] of moderation requires a standard. I believe you see this recurring problem, but will you be able to satisfactorily answer it?

<<<
 According to the stance that recognizes meaningness, meaning is real but not definite. It is neither objective nor subjective. It is neither given by an external force nor a human invention.
<<<

What does it mean to say meaning is not definite? Meaning defines. It gives us the outlines of things, the essence of things, the properties and relationships of things, the order and structure of things, the value and purpose of things, etc. Do you even know what you are saying here? It's a contradiction. I will walk with you on your contradictory path because I'm curious. You obviously have insight, but you are speaking doubletalk here. 

Pray tell what it means for something to be neither objective nor subjective? I have no idea what that even means. Similarly, you have vexxingly claimed to dissolve the externalist and internalist debate alongside the realist and anti-realist debate. You're claiming to have solved the fundamental problems of philosophy here. Forgive my doubt. You're a genius, no doubt, but I have excellent reason to suspect you are wrong.

I am continually annoyed by your inconsistency, hyprocrisy, helping yourself to what you say others have no right to, and your strawman arguments. I push forward, however, because if you are right, then you'll have solved the mystery that plagues me.

<<<
Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial. They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run.
<<<

Look, this reminds me of vague virtue-theoretic arguments. You're basically saying "appropriately fixate and deny meaning" in the right ways, at the right times, for the right reasons. Great. You've uttered a truism. Have you actually provided us the content of these maxims though? 

<<<
Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.
<<<

This is a definition I am not yet in a position to argue against. I worry that Nebulosity as a phenomena may be Nebulous, but that might be your point. I am worried about your use of "all," of course. I'm fighting the urge to throw away your work as gibberish, but I can see this work is no accident.

<<<
Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form.
<<<

There seems to be something right about that. It's induction and empiricism. I take it this person is against Rationalism and even refuses aspects of Kant's moves.

<<<
From point of view of the complete stance, eternalism and nihilism are each half right. Eternalism rightly recognizes that the world is meaningful to us, and that it must be accepted as it is. This is the acknowledgement of pattern: the world in all its variety, pain and pleasure alike. Nihilism rightly recognizes that there is no eternal source of meaning, so there is no ultimate basis or necessity for rejecting anything. This is the acceptance of nebulosity: the chaos and contingency of the world, and the recognition that we are free from divine law.
<<<

I got it, bro. I know your thesis. Let's see how complete your stance really is. Perhaps you don't have a thesis of //how the world is//, but really about how we ought to think, or you are giving us rounded answers to digging ourselves out of spirals and problematics. Is this just a heuristic device for you?
