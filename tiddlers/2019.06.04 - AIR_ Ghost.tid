Hey [[AIR]],

I've not been able to reach you for about 5 months. I don't understand it, and that's okay. I hope everything is going well for you. 

My offspring will be spending a couple weeks with [[JRE]] next month. I'm sure they would enjoy having the chance to see you. 

I hope your job is going well, and I hope your boss has eased up on you. 

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
