ah, man, how are you?
THU 8:31 AM
i'm fucking sick of the world
THU 8:31 AM
and humans
THU 8:31 AM
honestly, so fed-up
THU 8:31 AM
i've even turned down a bit of work today because my head space is just fucked
THU 8:32 AM
i have a bit of work that isnae urgent, so i'm just gonnae do a bit of that and then get stoned
THU 8:32 AM
just, everything.
THU 8:33 AM
we were watching live westminster shite last night, about Brexit
THU 8:33 AM
what fucking nonsense
THU 8:33 AM
i just feel like the degree to which the world is drowned in BULLSHIT is even so much more than it was when we were growing up a couple of decades ago
THU 8:33 AM
which is mindblowing, because gods ken the 80s were FULL OF BULLSHIT...
THU 8:34 AM
ed's been on the phone to the council (local authority) to pay our council tax bill
THU 8:35 AM
now, i'm okay with payhing tax (or at least i would be if it were spent fucking properly!!!!)
THU 8:36 AM
but just... it's so bullshit. Ah! I want another word, but that one is just too apt.
THU 8:36 AM
They are having to charge more, even though the services are fucking SAD and PATHETIC and INADEQUATE, because england's squeezed all the money out of scotland... but of course, plenty of folk in scotland fucking chose to perpetuate that in 2014, so I have to hate them, too...
THU 8:37 AM
just seeing the released line-up for the Hebridean Celtic (music) festival that's in Stornoway in July
THU 8:38 AM
fuckign PISH
THU 8:38 AM
the headliner is KT Tunstall, a f ucking bitch whore who spoke out against scottish independence
THU 8:38 AM
i kind of want to go picket/harass when t he festival comes, but of course I won't do
THU 8:39 AM
sorry, i'm just having a bitch
THU 8:39 AM
pretty pointless, really
THU 8:39 AM
but thanks for 'listening' lol ;)
THU 8:39 AM
I'm sorry you are sick of the world. Preach!
THU 8:59 AM
It could easily be filled with more bullshit, even a higher ratio of it too. I suspect it is. I think as the crisis of capitalism looms, memetic warfare becomes stronger.
THU 9:00 AM
You have a right to be angry.
THU 9:02 AM
memetic warfare?
THU 9:38 AM
apart from being a fantastic phrase, explain what you mean?
THU 9:38 AM
I definitely agree though that the 'crisis' of capitalism is causing a lot of this
THU 9:39 AM
the 'top' is so close to falling over
THU 9:39 AM
Memetic warfare is information and psychological warfare.
THU 9:39 AM
It's propaganda.
THU 9:39 AM
they're just desperate to make hay while the sun shines, not that any of they cunts have had to cut hay in probalby thousands of yeras...
THU 9:39 AM
oh ok
THU 9:39 AM
:)
THU 9:39 AM
stop being so fancy, then :P haha
THU 9:39 AM
we started watching this new 2-part series (we'll ony do about 30 mins at a time) last night about Hitler
THU 9:40 AM
he fucking spent his early 20s being a homeless bum in Vienna, painting
THU 9:40 AM
who'd have thought? that sounds so honest and human :P
THU 9:40 AM
It's astroturfing, shilling, censorship, flood forums, purposely trolling, paying people to subvert honest conversation, tracking those who are troublemakers, etc.
THU 9:40 AM
Lol.
THU 9:40 AM
aye, aye, ,and aye
THU 9:40 AM
i hear you
THU 9:40 AM
it's one reason why i try to avoid actually saying anything on facebook
THU 9:41 AM
i mean, i dnot' use it
THU 9:41 AM
but sometimes the urge to troll/fight is really tempting lol
THU 9:41 AM
but again, we are aiming to spend our lives in this tiny place
THU 9:41 AM
so i need to keep cards closer to my chest
THU 9:41 AM
that's the only good thing about living somewhere massive like the USA
THU 9:41 AM
say what you want
THU 9:41 AM
fuck the people who dinnae like it
THU 9:41 AM
because there are TOO MANY PEOPLE for it to make adiffernece, really, anyway lol
THU 9:42 AM
It's why I adore my wiki. It gives me a chance to say my peace. Those who want to read it can, those who don't make that choice for themselves.
THU 9:42 AM
aye
THU 9:42 AM
I very rarely get to be myself in Tennessee
THU 9:42 AM
i would think
THU 9:42 AM
well, Lewis is a LOT smaller than TN, even! haha
THU 9:42 AM
on one hand i like the idea of a blog/wiki/whatever because i have things i want to express.
THU 9:43 AM
lol, I can see why it becomes even more problematic for you
THU 9:43 AM
on the other hand, after having been on social media for the first decade or so it wa sa thing
THU 9:43 AM
i think it's actually better for me not to
THU 9:43 AM
it means i spend less time in my head/thoughts
THU 9:43 AM
which, jus sayin, you should maybe think about for your own wellbeing ;) hehe
THU 9:43 AM
I appreciate that, thank you.
THU 9:44 AM
besides,  i don't think what i really want or long for is a few folk who care/understand to hear me
THU 9:44 AM
I consider it my duty and my purpose though.
THU 9:44 AM
i think what i actually really want is to SHOCK people and PISS PEOPLE OFF and STIR THINGS UP
THU 9:44 AM
well, that's fair enough, it's your call! ;)
THU 9:44 AM
and i get that, too
THU 9:44 AM
because what would the world be like now if more sensitive and honest and intelligent people had been more heard?
THU 9:44 AM
but aye, i want to make trouble
THU 9:45 AM
i want to make people angry
THU 9:45 AM
i want to vandalise, destroy
THU 9:45 AM
i mean, only certain things for good reasons, not indiscriminately
THU 9:45 AM
;)
THU 9:45 AM
I want to embrace my inner Shiva, i guess lol
THU 9:45 AM
I think if we're going to have real change, it will require violent revolution.
THU 9:45 AM
or rather, let OUT my inner Shiva! to do some fucking damage to all these stupid cunts fucking up the world!!!
THU 9:45 AM
i agree with you
THU 9:45 AM
In my berea days i was really taken in by all the hippie pacifist stuff
THU 9:46 AM
Calls for civility are calls to silence victims and those defending victims.
THU 9:46 AM
which, theorertically, i love
THU 9:46 AM
but it's not the wrold in which we live
THU 9:46 AM
AYE!!! YES! that!
THU 9:46 AM
me too. I was a strong pacifist
THU 9:46 AM
for decades
THU 9:46 AM
more things we have in common, i guess ;)
THU 9:46 AM
=)
THU 9:46 AM
Ed's no pacifist by any means and I ken he's had an influence on me, of course
THU 9:46 AM
but honestly
THU 9:46 AM
i am feeling that
THU 9:47 AM
i am feeling that all the stuff we've been taught over the last 4, 5, 6 decades or whateer
THU 9:47 AM
is just bullshit to keep us quiet and complacent
THU 9:47 AM
Yup
THU 9:47 AM
I mean... fuck man. have you seen/read anything about Brexit?
THU 9:47 AM
It is utterly shocking
THU 9:47 AM
and the thing is, it is very clear at this point that most people - in govt or just poeple - dont' want brexit to happen
THU 9:47 AM
I have some. I still can determine how much damage it will cause. It's too big for me to see.
THU 9:47 AM
of course, the FACTS are that it shouldnae happen
THU 9:47 AM
BUT
THU 9:48 AM
can't*
THU 9:48 AM
the very richest poshest worst fucking cunts, they're going to do all they can to ensure brexit happens
THU 9:48 AM
even though we know now that it will be without a deal
THU 9:48 AM
Aye, it's really huge
THU 9:48 AM
and it's so DUMB
THU 9:48 AM
and all these people who are like, anti europe, they think it's all germany tryhing to take over the world, again... well fuck man, maybe it is
THU 9:49 AM
but look at every single stastic there is about England and Germany, and ask me who i'd rather be ruled by :P
THU 9:49 AM
The english are just really shitty, failed, useless germans!!
THU 9:49 AM
honestly, tho
THU 9:49 AM
what i care m ost about is scotland
THU 9:49 AM
and scotland is better off with brussells than london. FACT
THU 9:49 AM
I call it the Rand-Locke Memeplex. It is the celebration of egoistic selfishness, hyperindividualism, the denial of the claim that we actually owe anything to each other.
THU 9:49 AM
its like when Bill Hicks was trying to explain to people that cannabis is better than alcohol
THU 9:49 AM
its' like stop your inner monologue, youre WRONG
THU 9:50 AM
What does this Rand-Locke thing come from? Do you mean John Locke, or another one? Do you mean Ayn Rand?
THU 9:50 AM
There we may differ (don't hate me!). I prefer to think we are humans, and I'm opposed to nationalism or other such divisions.
THU 9:50 AM
Yes!
THU 9:50 AM
I have a vague idea of what that means, if so
THU 9:50 AM
not so clear on the Locke thing
THU 9:50 AM
Locke is the basis of contemporary Libertarian positions on property rights
THU 9:50 AM
I don't hate you. I also think we are humans, and I also think we should aim to live as a global human community. I'm just thinking in terms of how we get there and, right now, NOTHING is going to happen en masse
THU 9:51 AM
oh is he? okay
THU 9:51 AM
fuck him, then lol
THU 9:51 AM
Lol!
THU 9:51 AM
ken, Jesus didnae believe in private property. Funny how so many 'christians' seem to miss that... conveniently...
THU 9:51 AM
They don't give a shit what Jesus says.
THU 9:51 AM
i know
THU 9:51 AM
My wife is the exception.
THU 9:51 AM
money is their true god :)
THU 9:51 AM
your wife is exceptional in many, many ways ;)
THU 9:52 AM
she may even be my 'favourite christian', if i had to pick one
THU 9:52 AM
or felt comfortable minimising her wisdom into one label ;)
THU 9:52 AM
Mine too. =)
THU 9:52 AM
haha, well i hope so! lol
THU 9:52 AM
You know, I could still attend church, even though I don't believe Jesus is God, if they actually even remotely tried to live up to his words.
THU 9:52 AM
i've said to her in the past that one thing I respect SO MUCH about her is that she fights for her faith amongst the honesty of fact. She doesnae try to change facts to fit her so-called 'faith', which of course is what most folk do
THU 9:53 AM
i hear ya
THU 9:53 AM
Even an atheist should be able to look at The Golden Rule and be like: bingo, that's it!
THU 9:53 AM
to me, church is (or should be) about community. I learned that Union Church :) Part of a congregation for several years, and never ever a christian, and no one cared
THU 9:53 AM
well aye, who cares where something came from? If it's sense, it's sense.
THU 9:53 AM
That makes sense
THU 9:54 AM
lol
THU 9:54 AM
Yup
THU 9:54 AM
I'm writing a letter to my cousin (she's like a sister to me). It's heartbreaking to write.
THU 9:54 AM
well, i'm glad for you to have some relatives who are close to you, in actual human terms
THU 9:55 AM
why heartbreaking? Is verything okay?
THU 9:55 AM
She works at Humana. I did too until I figured out that it was evil. I've been trying to explain to her that they murder people and cause gratuitous suffering for the sake of profit.
THU 9:55 AM
i mean obivously 'everything' is not okay, but you know what i mean.
THU 9:55 AM
oh, i see
THU 9:55 AM
I'm the only person who is going to tell her the truth. =/
THU 9:55 AM
clearly
THU 9:56 AM
that's one of the funnest things about brexit, by the way, is watching the UK make itself a slave to the US and its LACK of standards, in anything and everything
THU 9:56 AM
they're going to sell our NHS to private american companies
THU 9:56 AM
Jesus.
THU 9:56 AM
I did not know that.
THU 9:56 AM
they're going to start allowing chlorinated chicken and hormoned-to-fuck beef and dairy etc
THU 9:56 AM
because it'll be the only way to get affordable food to these islands
THU 9:57 AM
the EU doesnae allow that crap, they actually have SOME standards for humans and the planet
THU 9:57 AM
We can't afford to move.
THU 9:57 AM
the UK is so happy to be getting rid of the Eureopean Human Rights convention
THU 9:57 AM
so they can take away what few rights workers have
THU 9:57 AM
:( I'm sorry
THU 9:57 AM
that said, i'm not sure where I'd tell you to go
THU 9:57 AM
i think at this rate, unless one is super wealthy, EVERYWHERE is fucked
THU 9:57 AM
tho coastal areas more immediately ;) lol
THU 9:57 AM
lol
THU 9:58 AM
Scandinavia and Germany seem like solid picks, which is not to say I'm in agree with their politics either. They do well on the metrics.
THU 9:58 AM

THU 9:59 AM
I'll tell you what... this is one of the most frustrating things about being in Scotland, today...
THU 9:59 AM
WE SHOULD BE WITH THEM
THU 9:59 AM
the wee scandinavian countries
THU 9:59 AM
we are like them, culturally, far more than we're like england
THU 10:00 AM
we have oil
THU 10:00 AM
(or did have, thanks England)
THU 10:00 AM
and fishing
(or did have, again, thanks, England!!)
THU 10:00 AM
to your global/human thing.. i think it's just easier, more practical and pragmatic and logistically reasonable, to 'govern' or 'manage' smaller areas and smaller groups of people
THU 10:00 AM
Those men have punchable faces.
THU 10:00 AM
in theory, that should give individuals a louder voice, too
THU 10:01 AM
oh don't they?
THU 10:01 AM
go find Jaco Rees Mogg in a video, hear his voice
THU 10:01 AM
any time i see/hear him i actually want to strangle him to death
THU 10:01 AM
lol
THU 10:01 AM
saw his face on a paper in the supermarket last week and was literally about to spit on it when ir emembered i was in public, and in a shop
THU 10:01 AM
and i'd have to buy it lol
THU 10:01 AM
honestly, i hate that man. i would murder him if i coudl. honestly.
THU 10:01 AM
some fucking hippie i turned out to be, eh?
THU 10:01 AM
Ed's proud, tho hahaha
THU 10:01 AM
I would too!
THU 10:02 AM
Kindness is not niceness. Even Jesus was violent at times. The Golden Rule means enforcing the The Golden Rule (you know, because nobody is the exception to the rule).
THU 10:02 AM
aye, but you know. people are stupid.
THU 10:03 AM
What drives me fucking crazy is how many people purposely try to narrow the scope of possibility. They say: "that's the way the world is...and that's why it could never be significantly better."

THU 10:03 AM
This woman, she's great. she's been touring a wee talk/film about how Scotland could and should be like our wee neighbours to the north
THU 10:03 AM
Which is why I'm an advocate for radical, free, and mandatory learning.
THU 10:03 AM
haha
THU 10:03 AM
well, that is sad, because possibility is much larger than people acknowledge
THU 10:04 AM
Preach, yo!
THU 10:04 AM
i mean, if every working class person got a gun or knife or pitchfork and marched into parliament and took some heids off, things MIGHT change!
THU 10:04 AM
I have a shitty question: do you think one day you are going to be forced to leave your beloved Scotland, like...permanently?
THU 10:05 AM
but we also know the likelihood is that somehow, whoever has any influence/power in t he new system, will just put themeslves at the top, exploit thelower folk, etc.
THU 10:05 AM
still, id' not mind us having a chance, anyway
THU 10:05 AM
Oh, no, I don't think I will do, thankfully. I got my citizenship (UK) in 2013
THU 10:05 AM
Ed and I will be legally married, at some point
THU 10:05 AM
so that won't hurt
THU 10:05 AM
but I had to get citizenship, even years before it was clear how things were changing here (in terms of anti immigrants), just because I c ouldnae deal with the potential that they might make me leave Scotland
THU 10:06 AM
i think now the only chance that could happen would be if the US authorities came after me
THU 10:06 AM
of course the UK will extradite me to them if they ask
THU 10:06 AM
No, I don't mean because authorities tell you to leave: I mean...do you think it will be something you can't afford?
THU 10:06 AM
but I don't think they'll ask. I'm too poor.
THU 10:06 AM
oh!
THU 10:06 AM
oh i see
THU 10:06 AM
well, no, not really that, either, just because where else woudl i go?
THU 10:06 AM
I have no idea.
THU 10:06 AM
On Lewis, ed and i can grow some things and eat stuff from the ocean
THU 10:06 AM
that's already a better set-up than most folk will have in urban or suburban areas
THU 10:07 AM
or even some rural areas
THU 10:07 AM
I think if things got really bad, we're more likely to hunker down on our land and fight/struggle to the end, than to go elsewhere
THU 10:07 AM
that said, when i sent my stepdad a link a few weeks ago about  brexit and how it's going ot mean food will be twice as expensive etc
THU 10:07 AM
he was like oh, i guess we're your escape plan, now
THU 10:07 AM
(because they've been considering us their escape route, ha!)
THU 10:08 AM
and i was like nope. I will go wander about the mediterranean on foot before i go back to the US
THU 10:08 AM
i just say mediterranean because I could conceivably get there, and it's an icer place to be homeless than scotland
THU 10:08 AM
lol
THU 10:08 AM
in terms of climate
THU 10:08 AM
lol
THU 10:08 A
