title: 2019.08.15 - Afterschool Teaching: Much Smoother

7Kf stopped me in the hall to talk. I think we are getting along. 6JR came to the office to talk about magic. He's very excited.

I prepared the paperwork and snack. My children didn't eat the veggies, but they liked the fruit. 

One of the teachers stopped by as I was speaking with my children and said I deserved a purple heart. That was curious. He teaches all day as well. I think he was referring to the rowdiness.

5Em is hilarious. He started quoting Gandalf to me and tried to do a double-leg takedown on me to prevent me from passing. Normally, the children aren't supposed to physically wrestle with the adults, but I also didn't want him to think I was offended. I am normally not the sort of person who touches anyone or who likes to be touched. Thankfully, I spun around him on the 4th attempt and he relented.  All I can think of is "5 more minutes of this" line from Rick & Morty, `/smh`.

The teachers gathered, and we explained the process to the VP. He's a quiet man, and I can see the wheels spinning. He's realizing the clusterfuck that is our paperwork and how little meaningful structure we have. I'm sure he is used to it, and I'm guessing he doesn't want to be here (but sees it as part of his job). His questions were poorly posed, so I am curious about his competencies. It's not a Peter Principle exactly, but I see a politician in him.

I am shocked to see 8HM has homework again, the only student today. I won't be making her do it though since I know she'll get it done. She has earned my trust, and I need to show what that means.

I was handed 6th. Everyone else took a set. I headed straight to the library, and people grabbed boardgames. We played magic. I played GRb ramp with spot removal and some classics; it was almost singleton. I may start handicapping myself turns to make it more competitive.

As always, I am asked about phones. We practiced hiding our devices and reasoning about the kinds of questions they should be asking authorities. I hope they will learn I am not officially allowed to validate the behavior.

7CM and 8Jf are now calling me daddy just to get me to react, lol.  We continue to have conversations about authority and kindness. Their language puts me in a difficult position with other students, but I prefer freedom here. My stomach turns inside and out to see her cuts (they might be getting worse); she's been naming them after people. She knows she's fucked, and her morbid humor is on par with mine. Her sister, by comparison, has the more goody-two-shoes approach and yet is worldly at the same time; fascinating mix. 

I am surprised by the number of yessirs I've been getting from many students. They think I am much older than I am too, lol. I started greying as a teenager though, and maybe my greybeard is one of the reasons for the Gandalf quotes? 

I spent almost 2 hours teaching and playing magic with 6Am(wtf?) 6JR, 6BG, and 6Cm. I'm pushing their attention spans to their limits. My son, by comparison, is a focused titan filled with lazer beams and a desire to do his best; he has grown so much these past few years. I do not give him enough credit.  

We finally got to the lab. I'm feeling bad about taking too long with magic here. I want my students who need to use the computers to have every minute they deserve. I am pleased to see that many don't give a shit about the censorship rules, and I continue to give my lab speech.

I sat with my stragglers in the end instead of doing my paperwork. Delp looked minorly worried. I'm lightning with paperwork though, so he shouldn't be. He prefers his teachers to sit with him in the office while the kids stay out there, but that's not why I'm here. The kids and I shot the shit some, but we had some interesting discussions too. The poor kids had to hear about episiotomies and giving birth. 

It is my honor to feed, nurture, and wrestle them.
