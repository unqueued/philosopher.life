Here I attempt to turn my Husserlian ray of intentionality upon itself. When I am thinking existentially in a recursive manner, I can more decisively align my many orders of Frankfurtian networks of beliefs and desires. Here I directly practice [[metaliving]] by reflecting on where and what I've been focusing on in this wiki. I need to be thinking about the state and nature of the projects I am working on from a more objective perspective. I hope this is an act of mid-term executive functioning. I do it subconsciously and indirectly to some extent, but not explicitly enough. Here I force myself to write it down at least once a month.

Essentially, I need a constantly updating review and gameplan for this wiki. I must hold myself accountable and strategize. I need to consider where and how I spend my time and energy on this lifetool and wisely adjust my behaviors accordingly. I hope to have the material with which to strategize, forecast and redirect my focus. Thus, here I generate a list of my currently prioritized projects and foci.

Note that I do not rank my {[[Projects|Projects on this Wiki]]}, and for good reason. However, I do rank my foci. Here I tentatively set my tent pegs down in my nomadic journey. 

Lastly, I feel it necessary to point out the infinigress I approach in this log-based introspection. I'm running into classic postmodern metanarrative and autonomy problematics. As a matter of metamodern pragmatism, I will accept there must be a foundational boundary where I stop constantly investigating and deconstructing. I will leave it to my yearly audit/assessment/review to investigate the state and nature of this page in those respects and to push further into that self-reflective frontier. I feel this strikes an appropriate balance between the definitionally impossible logistics of that infinigress and having the integrity to continue my recursive, multi-ordered executive functioning.
