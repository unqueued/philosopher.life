* Offspring went to be friends for the evening.
** Isaac comes over often, but this time he came inside. Way too cold out there. 
*** Learned he switched to another school. This is his third in the area. Hrm. He claims the school adjusted his grades to make it possible for him to leave. That is fascinating.
* Walked with wife.
** Thinking about what [[kicks]] is saying.
* Talked with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
** He is level and precise.
** I need to call him later in the evening to make sure he gets home.
* Talked with [[gh057]]
** He's planned time off during the month. Noice.
** He's looking for another job. I hope he takes me up on the offer to help with the resume. Part of the problem he faces is that he doesn't want to do the job he's qualified for (quite understandably).
*** He's in good spirits though.
** Wants to set up a wiki, waiting on a laptop. He'll have to come over and we will work on it together.
* Family seems okay, but people are tired.
** [[K]] is feeling better, thankfully.
* Eggs, grits
* //The Newsroom//
* Wife and I thought about the move.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 2:15
