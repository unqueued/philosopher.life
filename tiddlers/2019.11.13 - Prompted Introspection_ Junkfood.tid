title: 2019.11.13 - Prompted Introspection: Junkfood

!! What are junk foods?

Objects which belong in my tummy. GET IN MY BELLEH. They exist to exploit and pwn our evolved appetites. They overwhelm our sensibilities. They form a sweet, salty, or savory disaster. We may associate junkfood with lower classes, but I'm willing to think junkfood is a larger metaphor. It's a trojan horse, and we often accept it even when we know it's a trap. It fills some kind of desire molecule, at least part of which is need, and temporarily appears to fulfill it at a price we wouldn't pay if we were more rational.
