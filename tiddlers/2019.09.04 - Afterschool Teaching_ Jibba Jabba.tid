title: 2019.09.04 - Afterschool Teaching: Jibba Jabba

Still doing prep solo. The third hire didn't pay for her own drug test and background check, so they kicked her. I am surprised the spot was almost filled so quickly. Whitney found a friend for the slot, and she's pushing for her. Cool. Finished off more useless data sheets. 

I have no idea why we have so many high school volunteers. I went through the records, and it greatly increased (only some data is worth keeping ;P). I'm glad to see my former students, and I'm surprised they are here. My guess is that parents find this to be free babysitting. Some of these students are trustworthy, so it must be a form of sheltering. It's cool though, I'm glad they are here and have a chance to socialize. They do a bit of cleanup and connect with some of my other public children. I fear they use the ghetto kids.

Delp isn't here today, and Matt filled in. He's been staying late, putting in his time on this ladder. The gap between us is huge, but I am pleased with the way in which he seeks non-trivial literacy in our public children.

I was asked about the 5th, and I gave my overview. They were surprised by my assessment of 5TB. Of course, later on in the day, 5NP, 5TB, and 5Am got in trouble (not with me). I am shocked. I adore the punishment Matt cooked up for them: good ol' apology letters. Make them tell the story. Matt apparently had preached to these young ones. It's interesting to see how he channels his authority. Matt and VPParker are both privileged, deceptive climbers, but it is obvious that Matt is bringing some substance. He gives a shit, even if he doesn't appreciate the broader systems and philosophical problematics around him.

One-on-ones went well. 

8HM and I are jibberjabbering like adults. She is ridiculously quiet, beyond reserved. I'm lucky to get anything out of her.

Encouraging my children to do the robotics team. It's something constructive. 

8L, 8J, and a few 9th graders were trying to shock me with their answers to my follow-up question of why there weren't feeling so good. They joked "...and, I got my pussy eaten this weekend" which got a zero hesitation injection "that doesn't sound like a bad weekend, just make sure you are being safe and getting enough sleep." The tables turned, their faces reddened, and they laughed. These kids have so little to live for.

People are annoyed or amused that I dismiss some questions out of hand. They'll get it eventually.

Escalating for attention. Trying to call down first, then the school clap, and then the whistle (which is painful to old ears, but even more piercing for young ears; anyone close to me is quiet enough, and I ask them to cover their ears).

I took basically everyone as Whitney just sent her students who wanted to be in the library with me (which was nearly all). Considering I had that many, it was still fairly smooth. Homework got finished, and we played a lot of board games. The elite played Chess and MTG, ofc. =). I'm having a harder and harder time escaping the library to the lab. I need more lab time; we just aren't getting enough time in on our computers.

5CM finally got to play a game, though she was disappointed for stepping in for 6BG (she came late because she had homework). 2HD, and 7L and I were together. I played MWC and he his homebrew from a boxset he made over the past 24 hours. They had Affinity and Gobbos. 

6KB and I continue to wrestle with her math. She just wants me to tell her if it's correct (or the answer when she is lazy), and I keep making her tell me why. I think she has a mind for it but no confidence or interest. Her answers have been informal proofs, and I'm loving it.

[[gh057]] is having a quiet day, and I'm having a noisy one. Unless it's the tailend of the day, I usually only get to see him when I'm darting between activities or errands, unfortunately. I feel lucky when I have spaces to speak; he deserves more of my time than I can give. I was able to stay a bit after to talk too, so that was wonderful. He's confirming that admins are not funding janitorial supplies (pushing out of pocket and post hoc approved reimbursement with all the risk on The Janitors' heads) on top of requiring unpaid work. It makes me sick inside. These people make that school function, they keep it safe for us, and you know how messy kids are. I am so angry to see The Janitors treated like this.

Many of my students are sore from sports. We're talking about why this is a good thing. I am, of course, a hypocrite; I am quick to point it out to them. I slap my belly and talk about eatin'. We all like to eat. =)

5TB and I might have connected some today. After that letter, we had the usual lab talk, and he saw some sense in it. My students are regularly surprised by what I would advise my own offspring to do in this prison. He talked about his experiences at the elementary school. Of course, this may come back to bite me, but I assume every day I have with my public children is gravy.

5Sm and his mom were talking with me about magic today. I am, apparently, cool with my fellow kids. Matt and Whitney joined. 

I tried to get the printing done, but they've not set it up yet. Not my circus, not my monkeys. I'm handing it to Delp now.

6TS's sister came today to drop off clothes to a teacher and find her brother after hours (she's always looking out for him). Yesterday, Delp thought it was hilarious that I had her do the parental survey given that she's an 8th grader, assuming I had no idea who she was (admittedly, she looks much older than her age peers). It's what he wanted from last year though, and moreover, he's on the legal hook for this one. She is the stand-in guardian; if Delp is allowing her to take 6TS home, then she can do the pointless survey. In any case, she was hunting for her brother who wasn't there. This is the second time. I am worried that 6TS is not being responsible.
