<<footnotes "1" "This is a weird answer to a weird question. I could give you many of my standard answers found in the usual foundational places of this wiki. Unfortunately, if I have to give you the point-blank answer, this is it. I don't think the source of meaning is inside me. It's outside me. There can be no other answer, and even the 'why' of the matter self-points itself, that ultimate telos. It is weird because it inverts my own axioms...it is literally the unmoved mover, the Axiom of axioms, etc. I don't list my [[Axioms of h0p3]] like that, but there are safety reasons for doing so (just in case I find out I'm wrong, which is pretty fucking hard for me to fathom right now).">>
