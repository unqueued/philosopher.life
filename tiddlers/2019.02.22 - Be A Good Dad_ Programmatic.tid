title: 2019.02.22 - Be A Good Dad: Programmatic

We discussed variables, data structure, memory, and safety in python and other languages. We talked about compilers, LLVM, and the beauty of trying to generalize the problem. We walked through Python's behavior as it compares to other languages.

We talked about virtue signaling, honesty, and giving.
