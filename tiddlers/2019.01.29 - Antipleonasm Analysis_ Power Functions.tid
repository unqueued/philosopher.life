title: 2019.01.29 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Power Functions

!! Respond to the following gem:

All things are subject to interpretation. Whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power not truth.

In merely the material dialectic, given only we [[fff]], I wholeheartedly agree. Truth, of course, is objective. Only [[The Good]] itself can infinitely interpret itself, and the truth is in virtue of it. Perceiving truth is only ever a function of [[The Good]] to some initial and ending extent. I do agree that all things are subject to interpretation; it is not meaningful without it. We must all attempt the impossible in interpreting the signs of [[The Good]]. What else can we do? It is my faith that it is possible for me to interpret not as a function of power (for the sake of power) but as a genuine pursuit of truth. I'm a realist, and I believe it's possible for me to legitimately know at least one thing. Call "knowing" a power if you wish, but I think that fails to appreciate what is so profoundly beautiful in the above realpolitik [[redpill]]. 

Here's another way to look at this: does Sir Nietzsche's rule apply to itself? I suggest he will rely upon the same ladders of meaning to which I point to make any coherent use of it.
