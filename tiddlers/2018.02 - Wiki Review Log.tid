!! Audit:

* I did way more heavy lifting earlier this month. It has clearly tapered off tremendously. I am confused by this. Why? What is the cause of this?
** Again, is this a lack of cannabis? Or, is this something more sinister/problematic?
* I love having strong opinions, lol.
* I have a reasonable backup process now.
* I'll get to Job in the NRSV someday.
** I need a job more than Job.
* I've noticed that I don't always shop when I thought I would go shopping. That's fine though.
* My psychometrics have been important to me. They are helping me see how employers see me. Dyadic meta-accuracy!
* It's clear that I'm spending too much time watching shows. I need to cut back and do more work in my wiki. I feel like I've neglected this wiki over the course of the month. (`/bad llama`)
* My philosophical work was not in vein! I need to continue down the path. This construction is necessary.
* bed != bud, lol<<ref "2019.03.26">>
* I see some [[Wiki Audit Log]] work is being done here. Will I eventually just merge them? That is always the question.
** I'm still learning towards no.
* I have made serious efforts to relax this month. Sometimes I'm pushing hard, and other times pulling back. I don't know what to do about this. It's important to strike the right balance.
* I clearly didn't have as much sex as I'd have liked. It leaks into this log too.
* [[Continentality]] has been an interesting project.
* Ugh, I can see my unhappiness with myself this month. I hate that feeling. I'm feeling unhappy about being unhappy with myself. Lol.
* Not having a job clearly has me down; failing to find one effectively even further. Stand back up and fight!
* I'm still working through my yearly audit. That's okay. This is my first time.
* I'm not sure if my wife and I are adoring each other's reading materials. I am holding up my end though.
* I need to work more on Saturdays<<ref "2019.03.26-1">>
* This has been a couch-heavy 2 weeks.<<ref "2019.03.26-2">>
* There are some days here with more analysis that usual. On average, I have more to say in this log than the past few months (I believe). Good!
* It's weird that [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] and [[Wiki Review Log]] are often doing the same kind of work. One holds me accountable to [[To-Do-List Logs]] and the other against my wiki as a whole. Still, plenty of overlap. 
* Overall, good month, sir.
