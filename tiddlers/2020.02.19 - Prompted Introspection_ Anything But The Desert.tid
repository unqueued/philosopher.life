title: 2020.02.19 - Prompted Introspection: Anything But The Desert

!! Where would you prefer to be right now–mountains, desert, beach–and why?

I've answered this before, and tangentially elsewhere (not sure how far to go): 

* [[2017.11.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: Mountains & Forests]]
* [[2018.04.22 - Prompted Introspection Log: Area Preference]]
* [[2019.06.26 - Prompted Introspection: Living the Dream]]

I want to be on my computer right now (preferably with blowjobs, drugs, and Stephen Pinker gearing up for fist-fight in the living room). But, I would adore a glassy treehouse on the mountainous edge of a beach. 

And, when you think about it, why is a beach not a desert, a really tiny one? Yeah, it's probably not, but it's close.

I prefer not to be in the desert. That's part of wandering like a nomadic madman, I suppose.
