How's your day going?
WED 12:35 PM
How's your day been?
THU 7:25 PM
Hey, [[h0p3]]! Better, I guess? It’s Derby weekend so things are kind of calm, but it’s more of a cold “I’m just going what I have to to not get in trouble”
THU 9:25 PM
Heya. Calm is good, as is flying under the radar.
FRI 8:15 AM
How's your day been? You playing a campaign tonight?
FRI 6:15 PM
It’s been good! I got to pretty much do whatever today because nearly everyone is off for Derby. And yes, we are playing one of our campaigns tonight — very soon in facg
FRI 6:32 PM
Er, in fact*
FRI 6:32 PM
I get to use my really terrible Scottish accent
FRI 6:32 PM
Lol. =)
FRI 6:33 PM
I actually practiced this accent for two weeks before our first game so it wouldn’t be horrendous
FRI 6:33 PM
That is dedication. I think you should make them suffer instead.
FRI 6:35 PM
lol
FRI 6:41 PM
My problem is I get stage fright so to speak, and if I don’t practice I tend to have my accent bleed into other things.
FRI 6:42 PM
Like instead of just Scottish it becomes Scotts-Irish or randomly English because reasons
FRI 6:42 PM
As much as it pains my friends from the region: "eh, they're all about the same, amiright?"
FRI 6:43 PM
That’s the approach I took with a different accent — my barbarian was supposed to have a Norwegian accent and it’s basically just a jumble of everything. It sounds Russian, Norwegian, and sometimes slightly Icelandic. It’s a mess. But it’s fun to be angry and Russian-ish at the same time.
FRI 6:48 PM
I’ve probably used it as an excuse to threaten people a few too many times.
FRI 6:50 PM
Learn the appropriate toast for alcohol, how to say yes and no, at least 3 swear words, and a fun phrase like: "can my donkey have sex with your mother?" Done.
FRI 6:51 PM
LOL
FRI 6:54 PM
This is a glorious idea
FRI 6:54 PM
