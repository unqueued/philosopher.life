title: 2019.03.23 - TDL: Family Time

* 10mg DCK
* Family Time!
* I'm hoping my wife and I can stick to eating healthily. It would be good for both of us.
** The kids need to see it can and should be done too. I'm sure, as they age, this will become a problem. My wife and I were healthier at their ages too.
* Go ahead and keep working on your letters, even a bit at a time if you must. They need work.
* Just random shot in the dark: would it be worth writing on //loss//?
* That closet needs to be cleaned, as does the living room. Make sure it is done this weekend.
** Drill. Pipe. Seal.
