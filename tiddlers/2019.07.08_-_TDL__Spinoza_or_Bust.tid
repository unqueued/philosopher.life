title: 2019.07.08 - TDL: Spinoza or Bust

* Spinoza: Pansy!
* Get the kitchen set.
* Do your laundry.
* I think you should make the living room nicer.
* Porkchops, potatoes, some kind of veggie or fruit for dinner (apples).
* We probably need to grab more movies worth watching. While the kick is on.
* Letter to [[DeathOfRobinhood]] had some progress, build some inertia. 
** Need that [[Arrogance]] and perhaps [[Personhood]], oh, and [[4DID]] too?
