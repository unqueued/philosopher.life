title: 2018.09.14 -- Deep Reading: LOTR:FOTR

This book takes me back to Everquest. I played EQ before reading LOTR. It's an interesting experience to dive into the derivative (I do not use this word negatively) first.

I do not understand Strider. Sometimes he is human, sometimes he is more. Why can't he live at Riverdale again? How does he know his fate, or what does he think it is?

I gotta say, given the extremeness of what happens in the later books, I feel like the ringwraithes aren't even trying in this book!
