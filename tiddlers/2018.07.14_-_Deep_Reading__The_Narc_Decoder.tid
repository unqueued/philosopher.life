title: 2018.07.14 - Deep Reading: The Narc Decoder

It's very interesting to go through [[MWF]] and [[SLT]]'s writings now, to recall our video and personal conversations, and to relive my upbringing. There's some truly fucked up shit in it. It's no accident their children are broken.

I am very glad that my wife acts as a shield and middleman for me, allowing me to vulnerably digest it. I don't believe my donors are major Narcs (though they clearly speak the language with a particular accent), since I think the other dark triad traits are more obvious in them. The control freak shit, the rhetoric, the cultish narrative shaping, etc. however are beyond fucked up.
