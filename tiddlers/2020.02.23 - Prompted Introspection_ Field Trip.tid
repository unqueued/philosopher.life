title: 2020.02.23 - Prompted Introspection: Field Trip

!! Where do you think we should go on our class fieldtrip this year? Why?

Oh, we should definitely head to the concentration camps, laugh at those fucking spics in cages. I'm sure we will learn that they deserve it after looking them in the eyes.

We should actually talk with homeless people just to know we are superior and that justice obtains. 

Better yet, let's tour the ghettos of the world. When I encounter underfed children, it only strengthens my belief that selfishness is a good thing and that moral systems simply must be constructs which don't correspond to anything objective. All that matters are my personal preferences because nothing actually matters except when I feel like it does, right? Violence, clearly, is always wrong, no matter how many people are tortured.

Let's really get to know our enemies. Such a fieldtrip would be mere rhetoric, of course.
