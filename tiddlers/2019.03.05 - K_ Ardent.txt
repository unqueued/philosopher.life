How do you predict your day will go? What have you been thinking about?
TUE 8:46 AM
I would probably use the word “arduous” to describe how today will go. Haha. Also my weight loss has reached an asymptote which is frustrating. How are you today?
TUE 9:06 AM
I suppose one must be ardent to answer the arduous.
TUE 9:06 AM
I'm sorry about the weight loss!
TUE 9:07 AM
I'm okay today.
TUE 9:07 AM
Writing a letter to kicks.
TUE 9:07 AM
I have a new machine, possibly. Going to try to get it working.
TUE 9:08 AM
How do you lose weight, btw?
TUE 9:08 AM
My ffxiv character is named Ardent. So you could say that I am literally Ardent. ;)

It’s all good!

That’s good to hear!

Noice. 

Yeah? Like a computer?

Done mostly calorie counting since 11 months ago, and I’ve lost 30lbs
TUE 9:09 AM
Yes, you are the Ardent Assassin of Arduity.
TUE 9:10 AM
Calorie counting works. It's true. So painful. I hate it.
TUE 9:11 AM
You are an inspiration.
TUE 9:11 AM
Yes. New computer.  A used one.
TUE 9:11 AM
Nuh uh. >_>
TUE 9:11 AM
Nice! What are the specs?
TUE 9:11 AM
75 Pounds. Too long to fit anywhere. There is a lot of metal, and I don't know if it works yet.
TUE 9:12 AM
Cost me $350 from ebay with shipping.
TUE 9:13 AM
4 x Intel Xeon E5-4640, 128GB RAM (I've finally started hitting 32GB including swap this year)
