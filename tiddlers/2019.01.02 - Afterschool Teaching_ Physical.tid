title: 2019.01.02 - Afterschool Teaching: Physical

I forgot about the physical exam. I need to get that done tomorrow! I am continually annoyed that this minimum wage job has multiple barriers to entry which I have to pay for. The physical, the testing, the background checks, the training, the equipment and tooling should come out of their pocket not mine, especially since I get paid jackshit.
