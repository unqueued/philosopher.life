title: 2018.08.23 -- Prompted Introspection: Wince

!! What caused me to wince today?

My daughter's screen flashed as was I was checking on her efforts. This is almost always a sign that she is screwing around rather than trying. I called her out on it, but then she miraculously defended herself and said she was working. From the sound of her voice, I believed her. It was quite unlike her I apologized. 

I'm glad to be wrong in a sense, but I wish I didn't make the assumption.
