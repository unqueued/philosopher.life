!! I wish everyone had?..

I'm tired of providing the most [[salient]] answers I can find to these questions. Onto dumber answers for the shiggles. 

I wish everyone had the chance to be a more literal [[homonculus|The Homunculus]] inside of random people around the world. It would be amazing to see people trapped inside the worlds of others, particularly the poor, long enough to realize that they don't own themselves, that there's serious work to do which extends beyond just having a good time, and having the chance to more fully empathize behind some quasi [[VOI]]. Most people of means have no intention of studying the concept of justice, and I'd like to see them confronted by the reality of the lives of most people on the planet (I need it too).
