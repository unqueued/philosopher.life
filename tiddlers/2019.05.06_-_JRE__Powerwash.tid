My brother is feeling better! Woot! He had a bad week, but it sounds like he's back. He's got his energy back.

The party went well, though his brother-in-law-ish is a complete fucktard, as usual. My bro did the powerwashing for his mother-in-law, and he said it looks night and day different. He also got fresh chicken wings.

Work went well. He made fun of his apprentice (well-deserved), and we talked about the difficulty of audiobooks and podcasts at work. 

We discussed the nature of podcasts, and my brother made recommendations to me outside the sphere (rabbitholed on heartbreak). AP Bio (was marginally on my radar), Superstore, and Dear Zach (which, apparently, I'm not allowed to read about before hand, and I have to watch it all the way through). I'm excited.

Neo Yokio and One Punch Man make fun of anime in a way, or they are antithetical in some important way.

We talked a bit about diminishing marginal utility, and I tried to answer my brother's questions about pragmatic breakpoints. He is searching with me, and I'm grateful.

I said I had to go fuck, eat sushi, and watch GoT. Sounds like a plan.
