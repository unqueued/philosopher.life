Hi Leon,

I'm h0p3. It's nice to meet you. If this message is inappropriately "out of the blue" for you, I apologize. I've been reading through your lifelog: http://wiki.secretgeek.net. It's an interesting site. I like your projects and reasoning, especially your "About" page.

Despite our differences, I think we have major similarities in our goals and methods: https://philosopher.life/.

I found you by reference here: http://wiki.secretgeek.net/istigkeit, by way of a Google search for the term as used in Huxley's "The Door of Perceptions." You have an elegant and simple explanation of a face of this epistemic-ontic phenomenon. I wanted to say thank you for posting your view. It reminds me of Baudrillard's "Simulacra and Simulation." It's clear you have a logical bent to the problem, a quantitative approach to the fundamental problem in philosophy. It also reminds me of Gödel's incompleteness. I would like to know more about your opinion on the problem.

Anyways, this letter is just a shot in the dark; it's worth my time to reach out and try to start a dialogue with you. I don't meet enough people who think like you do.

Sincerely,

h0p3

Thanks for reaching out h0p3

I must’ve got that word from the doors of perception. I thought I picked it up from a Milan Kundera book but I guess it was Huxley after all.

Is your site built on a modified tiddly wiki? I used to use that, it’s nifty.

Something I quite like is Russels paradox. You know about that?
