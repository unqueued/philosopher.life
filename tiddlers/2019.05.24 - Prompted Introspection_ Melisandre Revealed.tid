title: 2019.05.24 - Prompted Introspection: Melisandre Revealed

!! Who is a friend you haven't seen for a long time but would like to see.

I answered this one last year: [[2018.04.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: See Friend Again]].  

One of my concerns is that the image of the friend I used to have is illusory, a false narrative, and ultimately our seeing each other wouldn't be valuable or deeply connected to the memories I have. So many people who I thought were my friends weren't, and people generally have had the social information advantages over me to the point of regular exploitation. 

Just as damning: my memory is failing me. I can feel my memories being stripped away. I'm losing my mind. Encounters with many people are just gone, and I fear I wouldn't even recognize an old memory even if I were to experience it again. The number of people who have been my friend, people who I would like to see again if only I knew who they were to me, sadly grows each year. The objective truth of our friendship does not die, but my access to it increasingly fails in various [[dok]].

My son's evolving image and reconstruction of his very young childhood friend, Muyong, reveals the same pattern in me.

Beyond that, the people who turned out to be dialectically crucial to me, at least in my understanding, often wouldn't appreciate why I am thankful or hold them in high regard. The reason I think they were [[good]] for or to me isn't one they would want to hear in many cases, or they wouldn't understand it even if I had a great deal of time to explain the meaning of the causal chain. Most would just find my argument insane. I continue to feel quite lonely in my ability to express to people why I value our friendship so much; it is often better for them that I don't waste their energy. It's ironic, bittersweet, and a form of comic tragedy. It would take superpowers to effectively reach out.

I see. Thank you, Lady Melisandre. That is a wish-granting question which is both sad and beautiful.

Alright, I'm going way back to [[New Haven]] for this one. Our neighbors were our babysitters. They were a rough family, but they were a family. The oldest daughter was exceptionally kind to us. I do not remember her face, her name, or almost anything about her besides her kindness.<<ref "2019.06.01">> She is an impression to me, one which only has a probabilistic and emotional appeal. I doubt she even values her interactions with me or her old self any more, but that is who I wish I could see again. Despite my doubts, I hope she flourishes.
