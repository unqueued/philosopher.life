title: 2018.09.15 -- Computer Musings: Pouring Rain?

So...my rooted and reimaged Amazon Firetablet (nexus image) appears to have died. Looks bricked. I get to the boot logo, and that's it. I can't access anything.

Before this, I noticed it was slowing down considerably (it was already barely useable, even slimmed down from the spyware bullshit they initially installed). Something's dead or dying it, but I have no idea if it's hardware or software. I've not changed anything in the software. I use it to read and once in a while to play a mind-numbing game as I push bricks on my throne. 

Ugh. All the bricks, but I can't flush this one.

My devices which have worked for a long time are bricking without intervention. What's happening?

BELAY THAT ORDER!

It took 40 minutes of letting it sit there, but I finally see an Android logo...

Shit. No touchscreen. Don't feel like plugging in a mouse here (I'm trying to take a shit here). It's a $30 tablet designed to enslave me, and I got my money's worth and freedom out of it. I can't complain too much (except, you know, about Capitalism and dark-triads). I have an old phone I can use instead; the screen size matters for reading, sadly. Reading highly visual content is like looking at a book through a peephole. 

I legitimately do not understand how people live on their phones. It's a travesty. There is absolutely no way they can accomplish the media consumption I do on that device. Some forms of communication are better on the phone, but most are radically worse. Fast typists on the phone seem to hit 50-60 wpm, and that is with some serious autocompletion abuse (bending over backwards with proprietary tools too). The cognitive load for hitting 100wpm on my keyboard isn't even there for me, and when we start to hit symbols, special keys, and automation through hotkeys, it's like living in a different universe. The papers I've received from phones have always been atrocious. This is something the state SHOULD be handing to people. It's a memetic and technical vaccination. There's a digital illiteracy/divide epidemic. How the fuck do you think we are going to solve it, assholes?
