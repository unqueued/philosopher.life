!! Audit:

* You make way, way more mistakes typing in your text editor. Jesus.
* A larger number of these I've written on before. 
* If I can get a facepalm from my wife, I'm doing a great job.
* `/clippity-clappity` those emotes make me happy
* [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] keeps pouring in, like [[/b/]] did.
** Some of the questions just are that though. Not up to me.
* Clearly, I'm not the only one reading these. 
** u r doing such a damn good job, btw. It's a real conversation.
* I like when I can get my son to laugh. 
** I have no idea how to raise him to be a mature man. I'm clearly a foolish child.
* I adore when you take things too literally. Dumb ~~claims~~ questions need plucked chicken counterexamples.
* There are some strong answers in here. 
** Good job, dude.
