title: 2019.04.30 - Afterschool Teaching: Talking

Whitney has been frazzled. I'm glad she took time off. The usual kids stopped by and trolled, I trolled back a bit.

As usual, I'm the only adult that mingles during the first half-hour. I probably need to do it more though since I have a harder time connecting with people.

I continue to have people tell me to take phones and drinks up (I, ofc, offer the usual heads-up and disclaimers about the adults and rules). I have had Delp, Whitney, and Matt bird-dogging me. Monitor away, lol. Those poor adults; I'm sure it must be confusing to them why I don't follow here. I will continue to nod in passive aggression while making spaces for my children. 

Mitchell took my homework kids away. We laughed about 5NP lying yet again. I think Mitchell is the only one trying over here. 

I spoke with high schoolers about what their prison is like. 

9AM and I spoke at length about college, markets, medicine, STEM v Humanities, and planning. That girl is smart. Her dad is an actual carpenter, and he's showing her how to build a house: lucky girl. 

7SR and I talked about embarrassment, local geography, social conventions, and I joked around with her. She's hilarious to tease and a good sport. 9AM knows deadpan immediately; she hunts for it now.

5:24f is grinding. I saw what she does for book-reports, and I'm concerned my children aren't up to par just yet. She has so much initiative in her; she is responsible.

5CM and I talked about what he does after school. That kid breaks my heart. He helps his dad with roofing. He got internet yesterday; he's using his own money to pay for it. Holy shit. That kid is a hero. He is so kind to everyone too. I look at that kid, and I know we are all fucking up. We owe him so much more.

I've had a lot more kids joking with me. That's interesting. I think I take the kids more interested in talking anyway.

As usual, my music is dope and lit. Thank you, chillun. 

5Zf is lonely today. Her partner in crime is gone, and I've failed to find a way to be useful to her.
