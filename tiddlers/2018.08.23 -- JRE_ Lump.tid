title: 2018.08.23 -- JRE: Lump

My brother had a hard time breathing last night. He had to stay up for it. Instead of work, he went to the doctor. They found a lump in his lung, and they don't have reasons for why he has a breathing problem. They don't believe its asthma, even with a bad breathing test result. They were concerned about pulmonary embolism. He is awaiting a call, and will be getting a catscan no matter what. 

He setup appointment for tonsils. 

He is urged by Rebecca to do the counseling thing. We talked about it. I hope he journals hard. Call ended shortly.

He has been constructive, and I hope he continues!
