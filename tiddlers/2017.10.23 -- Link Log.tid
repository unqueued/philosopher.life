I feel compelled to point out the inconsistencies in my thoughts in this log. Don't you see them?

* KYS

*** What a poor understanding of their moral responsibility. They could and should have known what they were doing and getting into long ago. This was obvious to anyone paying attention.

* Preach, yo!
** https://www.xda-developers.com/android-dns-over-tls-website-privacy/
*** How the fuck was this not standard from the beginning?
*** It's time to just restart from the beginning. We can build it. This is doable. You have to stop the obstructionist capitalists and reactionaries.

** http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/10/synthetic_biology_could_lead_to_the_re_emergence_of_smallpox.html
*** Of course, I can see the idiots moved to give up their freedoms. They've missed the larger metanarratives.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/43ng4n/california-restaurant-admits-its-been-serving-popeyes-chicken-for-months
*** I might have initially found a problem with this, but I can't find a rational one beyond a margins markup. I can conceive of restaurants that have the right mix of everything I would want though, and I would pay a bit extra for that.
** https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/20/human-genome-not-fully-sequenced/
*** I'm actually not even sure what ultimately counts as a complete sequence. I fear there are significant philosophical issues at stake in even trying to answer that question.

* Fishy

** https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain?
*** Okay, I'm done seeing it make its way. Yes, disgusting. The echo-chamber on this one is almost unanimous.

* Neat

*** I'm ignorant, yo, but this is how I fix it.
** https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/26/the-linux-scheduler-a-decade-of-wasted-cores/
*** It's time to be honest: we need to build load-balancing hardware. We've hit the single-thread IPS physical limits, and now growth is through decentralized computing paradigms. This is a key, yall. We already do this to some extent, but we just have to own up to it one every level of the stack.

*** Again, why the cloud? I want to control my data.

*** Okay, should I stop posting tools which I wouldn't want to actually use? How do I know I wouldn't want to use them?
