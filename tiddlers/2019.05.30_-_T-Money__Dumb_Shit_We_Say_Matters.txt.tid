type: text/plain

What's up home slice?
THU 5:07 PM
School and not much else.
THU 5:09 PM
How about you?
THU 5:09 PM
Just fi ished my work week. Friday night for me.
THU 5:10 PM
Slowly Planning my escape from lockheed
THU 5:12 PM
I appreciate that you can do the 4 day week even though with your commute there's almost no time on those days.
THU 5:12 PM
I hope you can escape, lol.
THU 5:13 PM
I keep applying to jobs and get nothing back.
THU 5:13 PM
Well, couple MLMs hit me up, so kind of them.
THU 5:13 PM
Ever hear back about the Louisville job?
THU 5:13 PM
Nothing from Louisville. Unfortunately. And I don't know what I want that job. Despite the money. I have grow tired of aviation and the red tape and nonsense.
THU 5:15 PM
Every major mfg Corp or the like wants to be as efficient as Toyota. So they have all accepted these systems and policies to streamline processes and save costs but they are just pushing numbers and not concentrating onn the real issues.
THU 5:16 PM
A guy in our hanger was having heart problems so they called the ambulance. We have no certified first responders. Our 3 firefighters were out to training. The doctor on site didn't have clearance to get into the hanger and when the ambulance arrived they went to the wrong building before finally being escorted to our hanger.
THU 5:18 PM
You can't make that up. Lol
THU 5:18 PM
Ugh. =/
THU 5:18 PM
Guy is fine.
THU 5:19 PM
Reminds me of something I read recently about 3 strikes policies for allowing tailgaters and falling for phishing attempts. Security makes life hard.
THU 5:19 PM
We got a random metal detection event the other day. Inside the hanger. It was a trick to catch people with phones.
THU 5:20 PM
They got a couple of guys with phones and then they go thru everything.
THU 5:21 PM
But we don't even have access to any classified info, or sensitive. Let alone secrete.
THU 5:21 PM
They security at the bluegrass army depot were nerve gas is stored was easier to deal with. And they hand the authority to fuck you up.
THU 5:22 PM
They guys are glorified guards.
THU 5:22 PM
In any event. =)
THU 5:23 PM
Lol
THU 5:23 PM
A surprising percentage of jobs in capitalism simply revolve around protecting the wealth of the elite.
THU 5:23 PM
(nerve gas being one of them)
THU 5:23 PM
They are destroying all of it as we speak.
THU 5:23 PM
Neat.
THU 5:23 PM
Sounds hard to do safely.
THU 5:23 PM
The mustard would be done by end of year. The other stuff is harder to deal with.
THU 5:24 PM
I as a primative my stick is bigger than your deterant in the global defense industry I still believe strength and a show of force is necessary. But the conflicts we have been getting for involved with are absurd.
THU 5:26 PM
It is something I often find some common ground on with Libertarians
THU 5:27 PM
Did I show you the swings me and Samantha built last weekend?
THU 5:28 PM
Heck yeah. They were beautiful.
THU 5:28 PM
She has been tearing up the one on the back yard.
THU 5:30 PM
I have plants to make two more. But using a unique material.
THU 5:30 PM
What material?
THU 5:32 PM
Image attached to message
THU 5:33 PM
These are ringa used for this ld wagon wheels
THU 5:34 PM
For old
THU 5:34 PM
Single rope, multi direction, lot of different kinda swinging. Really good for spinning. What kid doesn't like spinning! It's like our first taste a buzz!
THU 5:35 PM
=)
THU 5:36 PM
Hopefully the guys still has them. I had a bad hangover Monday and didn't do shit.
THU 5:39 PM
I didn't get out of bed till like 3 30lol
THU 5:40 PM
I outslept the hangover
THU 5:40 PM
Outstanding!
THU 5:40 PM
I dunno about that. Kinda shameful lol
THU 5:41 PM
I'm lucky enough not to get bad hangovers.
THU 5:41 PM
I cannot say it is immoral, so I'm not able to say you should be ashamed. I realize it is socially unacceptable.
THU 5:41 PM
It is the worst of all my vices and the only one that actually scares me.
THU 5:42 PM
I could do cocaine or heroine tonight. No fear.
THU 5:42 PM
I wish I didn't drink as well.
THU 5:43 PM
I'm afraid of and I love alcohol
THU 5:43 PM
Not many options.
THU 5:43 PM
I could do cocaine, but I'm saving heroine for right before I kick off.
THU 5:43 PM
That's how I hope to go out.
THU 5:43 PM
I'm applying to be a substitute teacher tomorrow. Or gathering the info to apply.
THU 5:43 PM
Noice. That sounds worthy. I think you'd enjoy teaching in many respects.
THU 5:44 PM
Life is hard. But I'm not so sure about controlling my death. I think it will get you when it's ready.
THU 5:45 PM
Had a coworker die a week or so ago. 49. 3 kids. One just graduated.
THU 5:45 PM
=(
THU 5:45 PM
He was literally out of state at his grandmother's funeral
THU 5:45 PM
Fuck up. I know.
THU 5:45 PM
Edf
THU 5:45 PM
Ed*
THU 5:46 PM
Another coworker had a real heart attack Wednesday but didn't go to hospital till after work.
THU 5:46 PM
And the other guy they said he had an anxiety attack. The one about thr ambulance.
THU 5:47 PM
I don't think they drug test substitute teachers either.
THU 5:47 PM
Enough to make one almost superstitious.
THU 5:47 PM
And I can sub at the local junior College.
THU 5:47 PM
They drug test heavily out here.
THU 5:47 PM
And if you become a sub you can get the state group Healthcare.
THU 5:48 PM
So that is my current plan. To solidify my families Healthcare. Then go from there.
THU 5:49 PM
Hell they don't even drug test teachers around here.
THU 5:49 PM
Awesome.
THU 5:49 PM
Once they took the pension system away they have lost alot of teachers.
THU 5:51 PM
I am not surprised.
THU 5:52 PM
I would rather be in the trade school. But I feel like I'm about mid life right now.
THU 5:52 PM
So it I'm ever gonna do my own thing I gotta jump now.
THU 5:52 PM
Sister just got diagnosed with diabetes. She's only 3 years older than me.
THU 5:53 PM
Runs in my family too. I am not looking forward to it.
THU 5:54 PM
I wish I knew more about restoring old trucks.
THU 5:54 PM
I have a feeling I might be able to flip a few and get some basic inventory. I wish I was a better welder. But I can always pay for a college credit and go learn one class. And buy a better welder.
THU 5:55 PM
I suspect a better welder and practice and I would be fine.
THU 5:56 PM
All I have is Flux core crap. Harbor freight chepo
THU 5:56 PM
If I were in your shoes, I'd pickup a nice machine and practice quite a bit. You've got the space.
THU 5:57 PM
You would be surprised how full my garage is right now. Lol
THU 6:07 PM
Screenshot of video attached to message
THU 10:25 PM
Looks fun. =)
THU 10:26 PM
Cmon up. I pay for good help
THU 10:26 PM
Lol
THU 10:27 PM
Lol.
THU 10:27 PM
Where are yall at Johnson city?
THU 10:27 PM
Right?
THU 10:27 PM
Aye.
THU 10:28 PM
Why do you say aye?
THU 10:28 PM
Force of habit.
THU 10:28 PM
Is this a habit developed?
THU 10:28 PM
When and where?
THU 10:28 PM
This is new. I don't recall you saying it at Berea.
THU 10:29 PM
Playing video games online long before we met.
THU 10:29 PM
Maybe you did.
THU 10:29 PM
Aye
THU 10:29 PM
It is a Yankee thing. And I get it. I just didn't know where it came from.
THU 10:29 PM
Lol!
THU 10:29 PM
Damn yankees.
THU 10:30 PM
I am perma outgrouped.
THU 10:30 PM
Also, I'm drunk tonight*
THU 10:30 PM
Dude. I worked and lived in minnisoda, Wisconsin and date a chick from New hampahire.
THU 10:30 PM
I did not get along with anyone.
THU 10:31 PM
I'm just giving you a hard time; I know you don't give a shit.
THU 10:31 PM
I'm drinking as well.
THU 10:31 PM
Not one. You can be an arrogant ass all you like. I won't judge you.
THU 10:31 PM
Lol
THU 10:32 PM
It would be just an extension of my work day. With bigger words and ideas.
THU 10:32 PM
Lmao
THU 10:32 PM
I think you have plenty of judgment, everyone does. I'm not convinced it is possible to perceive without judging; I think they are conceptually related.
THU 10:33 PM
Anyway, I didn't know you worked in up north
THU 10:33 PM
What were you doing all the way up thar?
THU 10:33 PM
So fucking technical. Have a frees space. I'm not gonna take the dumb shit you say and post it on the internet. Hold it aganist you in a later conversation, or let you damage my fragile ego.
THU 10:37 PM
"no judgment."
THU 10:37 PM
Lol
THU 10:37 PM
I was inspecting and testing cranes, bucket trucks digger Derrick, aerial firetruck (ladder trucks) all aerial devices doing annual Dot inspections.
THU 10:38 PM
And non destructive testing.
THU 10:39 PM
I'll let you keep thinking about your claim =-)
THU 10:39 PM
The work sounds interesting.
THU 10:40 PM
Thinking about it judging makes no sense.
THU 10:40 PM
Lol.
THU 10:41 PM
Like. "I don't have to think, I only have to do it, the results are always perfect. But that's old news"
THU 10:41 PM
It's worth being technical about judgment and what we owe to others.
THU 10:42 PM
Maybe if I was auditing a college course for my Job
THU 10:44 PM
I don't think friendship is that texhnical
THU 10:45 PM
It defeats the purpose.
THU 10:45 PM
Life is that technical.
THU 10:45 PM
I do have a freespace, and I am well aware of my accountability to my words. I choose them carefully, especially with my friends.
THU 10:45 PM
Our brains work differently.
THU 10:45 PM
Description is not prescription. That our brains work differently doesn't mean they ought.
THU 10:46 PM
Imagine the person who tells me 2+2=5 and claims "our brains work differently."
THU 10:46 PM
I choose words carefully. But I also don't value many peoples opinion. So, I judge harshly and think little of most people.
THU 10:46 PM
I won't relative judgment beyond what is necessary context.
THU 10:47 PM
That might be true to some extent. I think you value Vonnegut.
THU 10:47 PM
There are narratives which move you.
THU 10:47 PM
Yea think?
THU 10:47 PM
Lol
 I am happy with that observation
THU 10:48 PM
What r u drinking tonight?
THU 10:48 PM
A variety! =)
THU 10:48 PM
Beer and wine
THU 10:49 PM
How about you?
THU 10:49 PM
Homemade cheladas and just had a small bottle of southern comfort.
THU 10:55 PM
Noice.
THU 10:55 PM
Ice house edge 24oz 8.0‰ then i have a few double stacked natty lights. Got the souther comfort is like a triple shot bottle. Small. For a kick me off.
THU 10:57 PM
40mg Valium. Crazy amount of kratom.
THU 10:57 PM
Lol
THU 10:57 PM
God damn.
THU 10:57 PM
You are going for it tonight.
THU 10:57 PM
Some cocaine would be nice.
THU 10:57 PM
I don't think you realize the depth of my problem.
THU 10:58 PM
This is a... Normal Friday night. Since I don't work tomorrow.
THU 10:58 PM
I try to keep the drinking to aminum. But it's hard.
THU 10:59 PM
I hear that.
THU 10:59 PM
I only buy what I will drink that night. If I get too much I will drink it all.
THU 10:59 PM
Kathy hates it. I dunno how your wife feels.
THU 10:59 PM
Seems like you vary your usage alot.
THU 10:59 PM
I do. There are months I don't drink, and there are months I drink fairly heavily.
THU 11:00 PM
My wife surprises me. She is worried about my liver, brain, diabetes, and mental health. She also thinks substance abuse is extremely normal in my position. She's fine with it.
THU 11:01 PM
I have puked before though (Brandy never again!), and that I think that is one of her lines (understandably).
THU 11:02 PM
hah.
THU 11:02 PM

THU 11:03 PM
not at you.
THU 11:03 PM
Lol

THU 11:03 PM
i thought it was like beer
THU 11:03 PM

THU 11:04 PM
Lol. That is awesome (and terrible).
THU 11:04 PM

THU 11:04 PM

THU 11:04 PM
I don't remember how much yall drank.
THU 11:04 PM

THU 11:04 PM
puked
THU 11:04 PM

THU 11:04 PM
IIRC, you actually abstained from drinking and got high more often. You preferred to talk and smoke than get drunk with me.
THU 11:05 PM
it was like 4 in the afternoon.
THU 11:05 PM
Alcoholism sucks. I am so ready for legalized weed.
THU 11:05 PM
embarrased because i had a real issue with alcohol back then
THU 11:05 PM
i got in trouble with public saftey for drinking my first weekend in berea.
THU 11:06 PM

THU 11:07 PM
Lol. I don't remember that roommate, I believe. Did he have glasses?
THU 11:07 PM

THU 11:07 PM
Nope. I really don't remember.
THU 11:07 PM
Shit, it's been a while.
THU 11:08 PM

THU 11:08 PM
your memory is shot or your drunk one
THU 11:08 PM
or both
THU 11:08 PM

THU 11:08 PM
My memory is dying so fast. It sucks.
THU 11:08 PM
i have a horribly good memory
THU 11:08 PM
it is a burden mostly
THU 11:08 PM
Yeah, especially if it is about negative things.
THU 11:09 PM
My memory used to be quite strong until puberty.
THU 11:09 PM
But, it has been in decline ever since.
THU 11:09 PM
Must the titties.
THU 11:09 PM
must be*
THU 11:09 PM
i had a tough time remember shit before i was 9 or 10. but lots of therapy
THU 11:10 PM

THU 11:10 PM
By that account, your daughter has lived a significantly better childhood than you had.
THU 11:10 PM
(no offense to those who raised you)
THU 11:10 PM
YOUR GOD DAMN RIGHT
THU 11:10 PM
caps indicate excitment not yelling
THU 11:11 PM

THU 11:11 PM

THU 11:12 PM

THU 11:12 PM

THU 11:12 PM

THU 11:12 PM

THU 11:12 PM

THU 11:13 PM
That is a bunch, sir.
THU 11:13 PM

THU 11:14 PM

THU 11:14 PM

THU 11:14 PM

THU 11:14 PM
Roflmao.
THU 11:14 PM
(dig)
THU 11:15 PM
I post both our drunk shit on the interwebs!
THU 11:15 PM
I care enough about our relationship to document it.
THU 11:15 PM
To systematically think about it.
THU 11:15 PM
ill never forget it.
THU 11:15 PM
no need to document
THU 11:15 PM
Hahah
THU 11:15 PM
i obviously remember more.
THU 11:16 PM
So you stay in touch with any of your sisters still?
THU 11:16 PM
you dont remember the bearings you put int he skateboard you gave me. or the color of the wheels.
THU 11:16 PM
i do
THU 11:16 PM
I don't remember a ton. No doubt. It's one of the reasons I try to write about it.
THU 11:17 PM
(improtu quiz.
THU 11:17 PM
Shoot!
THU 11:17 PM
go MF
THU 11:17 PM
I can't pass a quiz to save my life.
THU 11:18 PM
But, I need another beer*
THU 11:18 PM
seriously?
THU 11:18 PM
me too
THU 11:18 PM
I guess I can pass some quizes. It depends.
THU 11:19 PM
red bones bearings with soft red longboard wheels no name board, still quality with king pin trucks
THU 11:19 PM
and i didnt even buy the GD thing
THU 11:19 PM
black bottom.
THU 11:20 PM
reg grip tape
THU 11:20 PM
i think you need to do suduku or something.
THU 11:20 PM
help out that memory
THU 11:20 PM
Lol.
THU 11:20 PM
hahaha
THU 11:20 PM
IIRC, they were red bones bearings and soft wheels. They were NOT longboard wheels though.
THU 11:21 PM
Those have a difference shape.
THU 11:21 PM
They were gorgeous wheels though. I remember picking them out and paying for them.
THU 11:22 PM
I don't recall which trucks I picked up though. I remember the magazine I bought them from.
THU 11:22 PM
That's a skateboard from 20 years ago.
THU 11:23 PM
When I lived in Wilmore, KY
THU 11:23 PM
I remember the routes and ramps I'd use with it. The skateboard carried me for many years.
THU 11:24 PM
I got too fat to ride.
THU 11:25 PM
Lol.
THU 11:25 PM
I went skating recently, and I felt like a fish out of water. That would have been unthinkable to me as youngling.
THU 11:25 PM
Sad to say, my kids do not enjoy any of those activities despite my encouragement.
THU 11:26 PM
the longboard wheels came from the diameter and softness of the wheels. which are similar to the softness of a longboard wheel
THU 11:26 PM
intended to not be stopped by a tiny pebble
THU 11:26 PM
No doubt. That's why I picked em. I don't remember if the graphic had worn off by college or not. They used to have literally skulls on them.
THU 11:27 PM
i was so mad when someone stole that board.
THU 11:27 PM
Shit happens. I'm sure they got some good use out of it.
THU 11:27 PM
there was no graphic when i got it. it was all black.
THU 11:27 PM
might have been picked off.
THU 11:27 PM
it was like a brand new board. it had been road, but not alot of griding.
THU 11:28 PM
last handfull of times i got drunk and blacked out.
THU 11:30 PM
i woke up to lectures on my youtube account.
THU 11:30 PM
halarious
THU 11:30 PM
Lol
THU 11:30 PM
my blackout level is about 2 beers
THU 11:31 PM
i have studied it.
THU 11:31 PM
i think because i am boarderline diabetic it happens easily
THU 11:31 PM
there is not scientific understanding of why
THU 11:31 PM
binge drinking, which i am quilty of
THU 11:31 PM
since about 10 15 i have had 4 beers and 2 shots
THU 11:32 PM
on top ofwhat i already had
THU 11:32 PM
makes blackouts easy. not pass outs. just loss of memory
THU 11:32 PM
and the fact im borderline diabetic
THU 11:32 PM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH5AHa5Im4U&list=PLixT_j3mcollkzYxMRImqFLp6NOON2lbU&index=16
THU 11:37 PM
Sa-Roc - Forever, Cold Beer, and Freight Train are my favorites.
THU 11:48 PM
Your list has a strong point of view.
THU 11:49 PM
It's quite a judgment about music. I enjoyed it.
THU 11:49 PM
My list as in what I've sent you?
THU 11:55 PM
Aye.
THU 11:55 PM
I am, ofc, the heathen that doesn't care about lyrics.
THU 11:55 PM
The sound is my preference.
THU 11:55 PM
Indeed.  It's blasphemy.
THU 11:56 PM
Our brains just work differently, homie. =)
THU 11:56 PM
Aye
THU 11:57 PM
(accepting non jusgmental, OK, with different personalities)
THU 11:57 PM
You sound pretty judgmental in your accusations of judgmentality. I mean no judgment by it, ofc.
THU 11:58 PM
It's a standard move I see in postmodernism.*
THU 11:58 PM
friendship is like diagreeing with your spouse.
FRI 12:01 AM
but you get you insult and make your point. but agree to disagree
FRI 12:01 AM
and move on
FRI 12:01 AM
like it didnt happen
FRI 12:02 AM
Lol. I prefer to think of myself as the nagging spouse.
FRI 12:02 AM
thats because you are
FRI 12:02 AM
rofl =)
FRI 12:02 AM
its ok
FRI 12:02 AM
i dont judge you
FRI 12:02 AM
All roads lead to one place.
FRI 12:02 AM
lmao
FRI 12:02 AM
I appreciate that you wish not to be judgmental. I take that into account in my judgment. I am, ofc, the worst.
FRI 12:03 AM
Friendship is hard to define, sir.
FRI 12:04 AM
I've yet to come across a definition that works.
FRI 12:04 AM
Love is the best I can do.
FRI 12:04 AM
we determined on the outset that we were both in attempts at creating this.
FRI 12:05 AM
i think keeping with that orignal goal is the best idea
FRI 12:05 AM
14 years later, and we're still at it.
FRI 12:06 AM
there is not defined fucking schedule or rule for friendship no more than a marriage.
FRI 12:06 AM
I can appreciate the desire to not codify it.
FRI 12:07 AM
its work, its time apart, its effort, its space... it is all of those things at once.
FRI 12:07 AM
Sounds like a reasonable code so far.
FRI 12:07 AM
if you attempt to codify a friendship. or a marriage. you are OCD to a point that i cannot handle
FRI 12:08 AM
Lol! =)
FRI 12:08 AM
Cannot even can!
FRI 12:08 AM
and legit. brain works different than mine
FRI 12:08 AM
can or care?
FRI 12:08 AM
I'm just meming. I like that phrase "cannot even can."
FRI 12:09 AM
that makes no sense
FRI 12:09 AM
your meme is horrible
FRI 12:09 AM
get a new one
FRI 12:09 AM
Agreed
FRI 12:09 AM

As a friend, I would love to be like a good bra for you, brah.
FRI 12:20 AM
I am hard to find. I support specific variants of your transworld identity. Unfortunately, I am uncomfortable like a prickly sumbitch. It depends on how you define "always lifts you up;" I may not make you feel happy, but there's more to life than that. I am sure, however, that I make you look 10x sexier.
FRI 12:22 AM
T-money, I make your nipples sing!
FRI 12:22 AM

FRI 12:32 AM
Whole words disappear.

FRI 12:32 AM
I greatly appreciate that, btw. I know you fill in the gaps for me.
FRI 12:32 AM
That's probably a skill in the 21 century.
FRI 12:33 AM
And truth be told I must confess
I’m living, breathing in reminisce
Of pseudo-intellectualism and a waning confidence
I climb mountains and hills 
With handfuls of lost and blistered
People, 
Somehow depth loses touch

Bold in stride, I follow
But it escapes me
Like things of importance, and priorities
I’ve got to many obligations, responsibilities
To be lost, or desperate, humble or wrong

I’m pushing, rushing, with no regrets
This meager knowledge has got me thinking
I should be desperate, ruthless, and 
Claiming what’s left

Of that fading glimpse I once retained
Clear of omission, of people 
Or pain
And depth loses touch
My pseudo-intellectualism has got me thinking

I should follow a guilt-stricken, emotional road
With weakness and faith, and hope 
And expectations of something better 
Bold I follow, and race toward the tide
Consuming, pathetic feelings of helplessness

Yes these books 
And his story and a can full of death in a bag
I’m pacing and drunken and ripped to the bone
Too open, too affectionate, too honest 
I don’t have time 
For this senseless
Bullshit
Obligations, these responsibilities

Fortified, conditioned, 
This greed driven mind
Yet why can’t I touch them
Affect them, relentless and immense 
I feel like something maybe
Worth an audience
A preacher, a poet, a fickle release
A machine, an toy, almost human tease
FRI 12:34 AM
youve read this before im sure
FRI 12:35 AM
Never
FRI 12:35 AM
Or I don't remember.
FRI 12:35 AM
Jesus Saves... Fucking shit.
FRI 12:36 AM
Poetry and lyrics do not stick with me.
FRI 12:37 AM
I still don't know the lyrics to Amazing Grace.
FRI 12:37 AM
I can play that on dozen instruments. Played it with hundreds of people for years. Sung it thousands of times. It just doesn't stick.
FRI 12:38 AM
Wish I could blame in the beer. Sadly, it's a problem since birth.
FRI 12:38 AM
jesus saves. shit humans according to scripture
FRI 12:42 AM
and lyrics stick with me
FRI 12:43 AM
We've evolved for it, no doubt. Part of the oral tradition built into 100 billion homo sapiens.
FRI 12:43 AM
but i think lyrics stick with me the same way a philisophy idea sticks with you.
FRI 12:43 AM
you study and comprend and read.
FRI 12:43 AM
i listen an feel
FRI 12:43 AM
and then come to similar outcomes of life.
FRI 12:44 AM
generations of philisofical thought.
FRI 12:44 AM

FRI 12:44 AM
