title: Hypercynic

The 90's were a special time. My first website was an Angelfire ad-based freebie. I didn't know anyone else who had their own website back then, and it was a fun thing for an asocial teenager to do.<<ref "1">>  My "coding" experience was limited to TI-83 Basic and QBasic.<<ref "2">> HTML and Javascript were totally new to me, and I had a blast. I'm sad to say that I can't find any of my work from back then. I stopped having a website in college, but after college I started publicly writing and programming again. Hypercynic was my second website.

I was a budding, naive, idealistic young adult in the 00's (and most of the 10's if we are being honest). While I was taking my first ass-raping redpill, getting my dreams and soul crushed by a reality I was obviously unprepared for, I spent time writing on a more professional personal website. It was a lot of fun, and it kept me sane. In a way, it was a predecessor to this wiki, and I wish to honor it by preserving its memory here. I found a copy of an encoded text file version of the site I made before taking it down, and I was wise enough to have backed it up with the original "G-Mail Drive" program (an unauthorized version of Google Drive which came out years before Google decided to officially compete in that space; it was the first "Dropbox"-like cloud for digital hoarders I'd ever used). I want to warn you that the formatting is particularly atrocious even after plenty of ctrl+h replacements (because I'm still too lazy to code it) to make it legible and sanitized.

It makes me laugh and cry that I thought I was hypercynical before. I didn't like the world, the people in it, myself, but I didn't know why. It's been a long decade trying to figure that out (and, perhaps, that suffering and searching will only continue). Obviously, I'm a radically different person than I was a decade ago in many ways.<<ref "3">> I accept the cringe with the nostalgia. It's the nature of the self-reflective beast. My blog<<ref "4">> was at least as odd and awkward as this wiki-journal-blog is, if not more so. I look on it fondly though. I see where I came from. Interpreting my Hypercynic work these many years later has helped me better piece together my narrative and make more sense of my world.

<<footnotes "1" "Back when I was first getting into hacking, curious tween to young teenager that I was, I decided I wanted to protect my site and create my own authorized private sections. I made some other neat little hacks that Angelfire obviously did not anticipate (hacking was really easy back then), but somehow it was a complete anticipatable toy security mechanism for punishing those who failed to enter the correct password after 3 guesses that made me laugh the most. It would just fucking rapidfire spam you with pop-up windows. Mind you, browsers were incredibly simple and unextendable back then. No one could stop it, and many browsers didn't let you choose to block pop-ups back then (not that anyone would have thought to do anything about it). It was very easy to crash a computer by flooding it with pop-ups (which you couldn't even click off). I set it to '50' pop-up windows, which crashed every single computer I had ever seen....50 pop-ups, rofl. I could likely throw 500 on my primary machine and survive just fine. Come to think of it, that website had many keywords for which it was the top result in Altavista (the original Google in terms of search engine excellence). Imagine that: I literally was the top result for multiple searches back then without any SEO! ">>
<<footnotes "2" "I had no one to teach or encourage me to pursue it. I wish I did.">>
<<footnotes "3" "Of course, I still have tons in common with who I was. I'm still just as foolish and ignorant in critical ways. I keep growing though.">>
<<footnotes "4" "Names will be redacted. I am obviously quite doxxable to anyone who is persistent (and odds are, if you are reading this [and I'm pretty sure no one does], you already know who I am). I can think of a dozen ways to unmask me. That's okay. Remember that anonymity and privacy come in degrees. I'm just trying not to be low-hanging fruit at this point.">>
