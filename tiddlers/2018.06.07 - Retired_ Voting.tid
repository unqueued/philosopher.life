title: 2018.06.07 - Retired: Voting

Since Plato, we’ve known that democracy sucks, but we’ve also seen a solid, practical case made for it simply in virtue of not having a better option actually available to us. Tyranny of tyrants, oligarchies, and majorities in democracies will always be a problem. 

This separation between the legal and moral realms is odd. Some people want to paint it as two kinds of normativity (that just sounds fucking stupid though). Ought is ought. There is either a unified normative theory or nothing. 

Weird things come out of this split. Censoring, as a practice, can be done morally. Practically and politically, however, it will be abused. Hence, even those things which we might morally wish to censor may need to be left untouched so that we can protect those sorts of speech which are necessary to a healthy, informed public.

Anyways, I would absolutely love to ban most people from voting. Fuck people. Most of us are retarded. It would be best, in some hypothetical way, to make sure everyone passed certain tests to allow them to vote (you need to be smart, informed, moral, etc.). Imagine how a small, well-educated voting base would perform (sounds like I’m trying to describe the ideal congress)? Awesomely, right? But, who is going to design these tests and implement them? How can such a thing not be abused (like the censorship issue)? Eh, it can’t. Basically, I don’t think we can have a political system other than democracy just because there will always be some pieces of shit/corrupt elites which will abuse the system.

So, everyone has a “legal” right to vote. That doesn’t mean everyone has a “moral” right to vote. I think most people are immoral when they are so arrogant to think they have the right to vote (hell, I don’t even know if I’m qualified to vote).
