*Made a "create new journal tiddler tagged with this one" hotkey, which promptly broke (I'll fix it eventually!)
*Removed the Tools tab, added the Keys tab (nothing new, really)
*Cleared out `$:/config/DefaultSidebarTab`, meaning that, when the wiki starts, no sidebar tab is selected

*Changed search results so you can walk through with arrow keys (see $:/core/ui/DefaultSearchResultList for what that code looks like)
**Note: in your palette, general primary is that background-of-selected-tiddler grey. Don't change it to something bright, please.
