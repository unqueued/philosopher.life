title: 2018.04.22 - h0p3's Log: Unannounced Visit

My donors honored us with their presence without our invitation. I've seen this powerplay before. I told my wife we'd play it however she wished. She invited them in (which is fine; hospitality, etc.). I sat mostly silent for several hours and listened like a laser as they connected with my children. Eventually, I had enough and took my phone with me outside. I called JRE and explained the situation. He was surprised and said that it didn't match his expectations from the conversation he had with them a couple days ago. He kindly said I was "gathering my thoughts," and he was right.

While I was gone, they asked to see the children the next day. My wife said "no." I'm grateful that she understood the context and did not wish to encourage their behavior. For the past couple days, we had talked about the issue. I smelled this coming. I'm glad we had agreed that she would likely be taking time off to take the kids to see MWF and SLT later in the summer if we were asked (which, of course, we would be). 

If you are reading, MWF and SLT: I do not prevent you from communicating with my children. You can call them on the phone, tox video chat, xmpp messenger, sms, and e-mail. You aren't allowed to infect them with your religious beliefs, and I will not allow you to destabilize their relationships with their parents. Yes, you don't get to see them in person whenever you want since that interferes with our own family life. Guess what? You aren't entitled to see them, even though you clearly feel that way. I'm being generous to you. You are welcome.
