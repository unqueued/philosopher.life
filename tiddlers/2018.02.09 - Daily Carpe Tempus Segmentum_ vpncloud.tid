* Woke at 7:15
** That nap helped, I think.
* I was lucky enough to be able to kiss my wife before she left for work.
* Woke kids, started on schoolwork.
* Talked to union, will go in Monday.<<ref "2020.02.09-1">>
* Talked to Garland. He claims the position is filled, but he left up the position online. He's probably white-lying to me, and that is a good indication that I won't be hired at Milligan.<<ref "2020.02.09-2">>
* Read+Write
* Bliss
* Had impromptu dinner (wife had event to attend in the evening). Was fun!
