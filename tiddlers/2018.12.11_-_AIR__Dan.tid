My brother's boss threatened to fire his two sous chefs (one being my brother). The psychopath may do it. The contradictions were outstanding. My brother has one backup plan, but I think he must start working even harder to find an out.

My brother thanked me for the chance to vent. I'm glad to be there for him and think about it with him!
