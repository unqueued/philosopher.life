How's your day going?

Yesterday was good. How are you today?
MON 9:55 AM
Awesome. I checked in periodically on your game. It was neat to see.
MON 9:56 AM
I'm doing well today. We are finally getting that tax money in from what I understand. I've been applying to jobs. I didn't get the second interview for the position I was hoping for, I believe. Doing school work with the kiddos.
MON 9:58 AM
How about you?
MON 9:58 AM
The notes are complete now.
MON 10:08 AM
Good to hear on the taxes! Sucks on the job. :(

MON 10:08 AM
Sorry, man.

No worries. It is what it is.

Ups and downs.

What you up to today?

Work. Gonna take it easy tonight.
MON 10:20 AM
That’s the current plan!
MON 10:21 AM
Sounds good. Hopefully, you'll have a chance to read or watch some of the narratives you told me about a week or so ago.
MON 10:23 AM
I can't say the show was my cup of tea, but my wife adored it: Good Omens. 6 episode mini-series, light-hearted, and gorgeous
MON 10:24 AM
Thanks! I’ll check it out. :)
