!! Audit:

* The adults are tired, stressed, and barely making it; the kids are getting sleep, food, life skills, and schoolwork (to some extent).
* The kids are growing up so goddamned fast. 
** I'm not going to have time to show them everything I need to show them. I've gotta triage and do my best. I've gotta teach them how to do their best and survive in the desert.
** I've had to relax and just let them be foolish in a ton of cases. I cannot control everything, and they must learn and try on their own in so many ways.
* This log is officially a [[Root User]]. It hasn't weighed in directly on anything yet, but I think that's a good thing.
** Perhaps I'm doing it wrong. How do I give more voice to it beyond the kinds of [[Log Audit]]s that I'm writing right now?
* Complimenting has been a crucial practice. I'm so grateful for this in our lives.
** I am ridiculously negative, and I need to make sure I have a guaranteed space wherein I am positive.
* Like the [[review]], this is a powerful pulsetaking tool. It's weekliness is unique.
** Should I being doing more like this one?
* [[k0sh3k]] is the rock of our household.
** She has endured so fucking much this year. I do not know how.
* School has been hell, as usual. 
** We have lots of problems. Nothing seems to be a great fix. We're making progress though.
