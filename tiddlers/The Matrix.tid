title: The Matrix

!! About:

//Like Dune, it's one of my looking glasses: temet nosce.//

This is my favorite story of all time. Seriously, of every piece of media I've ever consumed, this one is the best. No, it's not perfect. Yes, it's worth studying.

Plato (Black Sabbath) may have started it, but The Wachowski's (Metallica) appear to have perfected it, at least in some crucial respects. That is one [[Diamond]]ic [[Redpill]], a construction for deconstruction. It is one of the fundamental dialectical catalysts of my life. A non-trivial [[dok]] of who I am is reducible to my relationship, identification or wrestling, with this narratival memeplex. 

This is the primary origin of the term [[Redpill]]. This is a classic cultural phenomenon, particularly in the circles I've been hovering for decades. I say very little of bluepills on this wiki, but I do talk about something else: the [[Diamond]].

The film, or what it represents, is skeuomorphic, recursively transfiguring how we can see it, ourselves, and the world around us. As the years go by, I see the world through this lens differently, and in a sense, understand the lens itself differently through itself. It keeps changing how I interpret it; that's a powerful, recursive, dialectical hermenuetic circle or spiral. The feedback loop, complexity, and systematicity of this ontic/epistemic question is everywhere. 

I should have incredibly strong feelings and opinion about it. It's art to me. It's part of the faith which I cannot give up; it's just born into me (and, believe me, I've tried to doubt it). It's no accident.

!! Dreams:

* Search my wiki for "The Matrix," "experience machine," etc. I want to connect all the dots here. This movie is a profound, simple language tool for me to express my point of view. It's Diamondic in its Redpilledness.
