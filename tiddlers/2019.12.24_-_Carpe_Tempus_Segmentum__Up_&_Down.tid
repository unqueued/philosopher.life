* Woke at 3:30

* Shower of the Gods!
* We packed and cleaned.
* Spoke with [[Killcoin]]
* Called [[JRE]]
* Tons of cleaning. 
** The upstairs has only been this clean once: when we moved in. Lol. My god, we are terrible at keeping a clean house.
* We called it quits at 10:30, but nobody wanted to sleep.
** I'm proud of our effort together. It's coming along.
* //Psych// while sitting on pillows, drinking ours dranks, talking shit, and laughing. 
** Up way, way too late. 
* Read+Write
** Blind-sided. I had no idea what we were talking about. We went from what I consider a deep topic to a terrifying one. 
*** I don't even know how to show I'm listening. Nothing fits. I have no words, and all that I find aren't good enough. Will need to think about how best to respond.
* Sleep by 3:30?
