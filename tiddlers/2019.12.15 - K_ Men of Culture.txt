The week was fun. The graduation ceremony was sucky haha. Glad itâ€™s over.
Dec 15, 2019 10:08pm
Me too.
Dec 15, 2019 10:08pm
Hopefully, you can get some chill time in.
Dec 15, 2019 10:08pm
Allergy problem all set?
Dec 15, 2019 10:08pm
Iâ€™m seeing a nurse practitioner tomorrow. Hoping for something. Haha. What are you up to?
Dec 15, 2019 10:12pm
I tend to have better interactions with the nurse practitioner than the doctor (doc knows how to make money of 'em). I hope it goes well.

Family Time, boxing, organizing, cleaning

[[L]] demands that I tell them the three Aâ€™s: Asthma, Allergies, and Anxiety
Dec 15, 2019 10:20pm
Nice. Sounds like a good time all around. :)
Dec 15, 2019 10:20pm
Hope you guys at least took some time to relax.
Dec 15, 2019 10:20pm
Aye. all worthy for them to know.
Dec 15, 2019 10:20pm
We watched an episode of Psych and shot the shit a bit. Sunday is usually our most intense day.
Dec 15, 2019 10:21pm
It has been a good day though
Dec 15, 2019 10:21pm
We are entering the home stretch for our Christmas shopping. We spent all day working on that. Iâ€™m taking the car in this week too for our Gatlinburg trip :)
Dec 15, 2019 10:21pm
Good!
Dec 15, 2019 10:21pm
I'm taking the car in as well for the same, lol.
Dec 15, 2019 10:22pm
Won't be doing any X-mas shopping though. Simply too insane. Won't even be celebrating their birthdays until after the move.
Dec 15, 2019 10:22pm
I feel that. Our wallets are SCREAMING haha
Dec 15, 2019 10:33pm
Relationships are expensive. ;)
Dec 15, 2019 10:33pm
Iâ€™m looking forward to or canon experience. I think itâ€™ll be super fun and hopefully chill too.
Dec 15, 2019 10:34pm
Our cabin***
Dec 15, 2019 10:34pm
Yeah, hopefully cozy and that blacksmithing thing sounds pretty awesome.
Dec 15, 2019 10:34pm
It does. Iâ€™d love to watch. I donâ€™t wanna do it personally though hah
Dec 15, 2019 10:35pm
I'm hoping my right arm has had so much practice that this won't make me too sore.
Dec 15, 2019 10:36pm
I don't think anyone else in my immediate is interested in doing it either. Just gonna watch, I believe.
Dec 15, 2019 10:36pm
I really just wanna relax at the cabin. Iâ€™m gonna bring some games and books as well as my laptop. We should all watch some movies together too. I have a projector that might give us a big picture if we can find a clear enough wall.
Dec 15, 2019 10:39pm
Heck yeah
Dec 15, 2019 10:39pm
Just being in each othersâ€™ company is going to be very good.
Dec 15, 2019 10:40pm
:)
Dec 15, 2019 10:40pm
I'd like to watch The Big Lebowski
Dec 15, 2019 10:40pm
no doubt
Dec 15, 2019 10:40pm
Iâ€™ve never seen it so that sounds great!
Dec 15, 2019 10:40pm
[[AA]] would not have cared a couple decades ago, but I don't know where she's at on it now: there are tits in this movie.
Dec 15, 2019 10:41pm
It is a great, great movie though.
Dec 15, 2019 10:41pm
Like, cult-classic.
Dec 15, 2019 10:41pm
Maybe weâ€™ll put it on while the kids are in the pool. Iâ€™m not scared of tiddies. ðŸ˜‚
Dec 15, 2019 10:42pm
Ah, mine have already seen it. It's no big deal to me.
Dec 15, 2019 10:42pm
My son loves Japanese girls, and all I can do it nod my head in assent. Yes, son, those are amazing boobs.
Dec 15, 2019 10:43pm
lol
Dec 15, 2019 10:43pm
I see [[1uxb0x]] too is a [Removed: Degenerate] man of culture.
Dec 15, 2019 10:44pm
rofl
Dec 15, 2019 10:44pm
[[L]] just watched me woo a pig-tailed anime girl in Persona 5. Trust me when I say weâ€™re both commenting on their cup sizes.
Dec 15, 2019 10:45pm
Poyfect
Dec 15, 2019 10:45pm
But anyway. If they donâ€™t wanna watch it, they can just go to another room. Thereâ€™s plenty of places to hide in the cabin lmao.
Dec 15, 2019 10:45pm
Seems like a big cabin too
Dec 15, 2019 10:46pm
super excited
Dec 15, 2019 10:46pm
Iâ€™m probably crazy. I 100% wanna give that hot tub a spin. I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s cold outside.
Dec 15, 2019 10:47pm
Probably the best time to do the hot tub. I
Dec 15, 2019 10:47pm
I think so too. Thereâ€™s no way in hell weâ€™ll be cold once we get into it.
