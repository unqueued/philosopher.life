* Woke up before alarm
* Fireman Time!
** Had to be quick.
* Worked hard
* Listened to //The Help//.
** Now that's some revisionist historical fiction
* Watched Tosh.0 and The Matrix with the kiddos. Pizza.
* We did some math to figure out if our store bought pizza was actually more price efficient than the special at Papa Johns.
* Fireman Time! 
* Talked to wife, bed.
