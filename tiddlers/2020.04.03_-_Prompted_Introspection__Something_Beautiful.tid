title: 2020.04.03 - Prompted Introspection: Something Beautiful

!! How do you feel when you see something beautiful? Have you ever seen something so beautiful it makes you cry?

This is a special [[prompt]] for me, and that is obvious even in [[2018.07.02 - Prompted Introspection: The Beautiful]]. My hesitation with [[beauty]] is due to my ability to be wrong about the target or cause of my [[awe]]. [[The Good]]'s normativity is dialectically split, and for a mind like mine, [[The Right]]'s normativity overrides by unconditional definition. I have mixed feelings about something which is beautiful, and I have a wide variety of reactions. I feel lucky to experience what is beautiful so often.
