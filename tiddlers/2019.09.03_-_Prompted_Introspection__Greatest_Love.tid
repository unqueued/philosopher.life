title: 2019.09.03 - Prompted Introspection: Greatest Love

!! What or who is the greatest love of your life?

The "what" which is not a "who" to my knowledge that //attracts// me the most is [[The Good]], and hence [[The Right]] and [[The Beautiful]]. I'm fine saying [[love]] can target such a thing, but I'm open to more precise definitions which preclude it. As to the who, it is clearly my wife, [[k0sh3k]]. 

You are pitchin' easy ones to me today, Samwise. Thank you. =)
