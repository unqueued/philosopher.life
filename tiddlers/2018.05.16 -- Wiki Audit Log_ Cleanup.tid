title: 2018.05.16 -- Wiki Audit Log: Cleanup

* Fixed some of my [[A History of Western Philosophy]] transclusions
** Thank you, k0sh3k, for pointing these out to me. I'm not sure how you knew that. Please let me know how you figured out that out; did you really remember how all the pieces fit together?
** -=[ Rabbitedholed ]=-
* Check recent for a shit ton of small edits. I'm just reading and fixing. They are small changes, but still important to me.
* I'm finally migrating notes and assorted bullshit into this wiki. I already do that for current content, so why not the old. I really don't know what is going to matter in the end to me. It's text, and it belongs here.
* [[Pin]] is getting a revamp
* Grafting in a ton of my old work, and I'm glad I did. There is a must read book for me again. I need to take a deeper look at Brandom.
