A reality that determines itself. Inner-freedom generates a fuller kind of reality, divine, spirit, soul, god, etc. Plato and Hegel show that God is deeply familiar to us in part, through our everyday experience of seeking to know and partake of [[The Good]]. This experience is what we call soul. 

Sense experience is not the last word. Human freedom, the modeling of our perceptions, identities of ourselves and the world around us, [[The Good]], just is crucial. Even Kant knew it. Hegel is trying to close the gap between practical and ideal with the ultimately ideal. 

Hegel doesn't preach the forms, but that doesn't prevent him from being a student of Plato. They seek certainty, idealism, the reality of the soul and divine, [[The Good]], that these things are all a thought. These ideal realities are the most real because they contrast with physical reality and everything else because it is more self-determining.
