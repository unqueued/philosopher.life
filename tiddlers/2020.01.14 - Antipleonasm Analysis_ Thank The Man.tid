title: 2020.01.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Thank The Man

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
How can you thank a man for giving you what's already yours? How then can you thank him for giving you only part of what's already yours?
<<<

~~By uttering the words "thank you," my dude.~~ 

When is it appropriate to thank someone (and similarly, when is it appropriate to apologize?)? Out in the world, I aim to "please," "thank you," and "I'm sorry" the everliving fuck out of the humans around me, especially the poor and those who serve.<<ref "q">> I need us to see each person standing before us as someone with an innerlife like ours,<<ref "a">> and it is crucial that we bend over backward in hedged-conservatism to kneejerk react with hospitality, come correct, dance every dance, dot-i's and cross-t's, etc. It is not so clear what is really mine.

Does this lessen the meaning or value of saying "thank you" in some contexts? Yes, at some surface level it does. But, that's when honesty and being forthcoming in our analysis allows us to say "thank you" with more depth. Imagine a culture in which thanking someone was seen as being too formal, as subtly implying a kind of distance between you and the [[other]] which would hurt their feelings. Being thankful has to arise in layers and be fitted to the context.

There are also plenty of cases in which I am polite to those unjustifiably in [[power]]-over me. I'm less likely to swallow my pride (larger than life too) than most, but it's practically necessary in many cases. I'm not internally thankful even though I demonstrate it externally.

Why we ought (or ought not) thank someone is a non-trivial problem that can be partially peeled apart from what is already owed to us. Obviously, I agree there are cases in which we must demand what is already ours, and we ought not demonstrate gratitude to those in [[power]] because it implies accepting injustice. Your cases, in particular, [[Saint MX]], stand out as being of this kind. Gratitude requires my submission deep down; sometimes I can only cry. Yet, we must wield submission in warfare wisely.

The price the poor put on my head is far too high. I aim to hand submission signals to slaves all day, and I aim to drip condescension and disdain with masters and some reactionaries. Annoyingly so to my offspring, I am sure. It is so rare that I give a shit about politeness in most respects, but to impose costs on the less fortunate is a quick way to open a dialecture.">>

<<footnotes "a" "And, as I've mentioned, this becomes radically harder and requiring far more integrity to do when they aren't standing there, when it is mere principle-agent remotivity, when our feelings cannot be trusted because they were never activated without cognitively forcing ourselves to look at it.">>
