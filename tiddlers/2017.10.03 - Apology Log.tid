//Postscript of Apology given over phone//

I am sorry for having made fun of your eating chicken wings. I don't know if I offended you, but I realized that it may have been bullying. I'm sorry if you felt bullied.

Turns out, my brother didn't think it was bad at all. In fact, he had worried that he made me feel like I had offended him. Cool.
