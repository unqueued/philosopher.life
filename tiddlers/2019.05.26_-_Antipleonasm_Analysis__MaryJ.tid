!! Respond to the following gem:

If the principle is, "Let's not get lethal substances out to the public", the first one you'd go after is tobacco. The next one you'd go after is alcohol. Way down the list you'd get to cocaine, and sort of invisibly low you'd get to marijuana.

I'm obviously in agreement. I recognize that pure THC is not healthy in various contexts, but cannabis can be quite healthy in others. One should never actually use tobacco or alcohol except insofar as it is a social gateway, and even then, if you can find a way around it you should. I don't consider this the most pressing issue we face, but it serves as a fine example of whose interests are being served.
