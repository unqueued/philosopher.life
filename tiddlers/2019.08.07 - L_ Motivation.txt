How goes your grind?
WED 10:41 AM
Mm, not as well as it should be. I feel like it’s so easy to get stuck in a rut these days.
WED 10:44 AM
But I’m having a better mental day today, so hoping to channel that into being productive.
WED 10:44 AM
Alright. [[AA]] has The Pit. You have The Rut. I need a The X.
WED 10:47 AM
The Nix.
WED 10:48 AM
You have that yearly presentation season coming up soon, yeah?
WED 10:49 AM
Yup! It happens in November. I have had exactly zero motivation to work on it.
WED 10:51 AM
Understandably
WED 10:51 AM
I wish I could snap off my lack of motivation at work and just leave it with work things. It’s frustrating how much it dampers the rest of my mind even after I log off.
WED 10:51 AM
The Rut is infectious.
WED 10:52 AM
It doesn’t help either that I am atrocious at setting routines for myself. I specifically don’t like them and so I am bad at forcing myself to do the things I need to do to make strides in the right direction. Ugh.
WED 10:53 AM
Can I send my brain in for reprogramming? Is that a thing? lol
WED 10:54 AM
Lol
WED 10:54 AM
Must find brainalyzer
WED 10:54 AM
I have been thinking about everything we talked about on our visit down, particularly what kind of tools I would be interested in making through programming.
WED 10:56 AM
My conclusion is my lack of understanding is making it hard for me to come up with ideas.
WED 10:57 AM
Lol. That is my life summed up.
WED 10:58 AM
Honestly, making some kind of character-creator would be super cool, but that is a BIG project to tackle at the start. Big mostly because I would want ALL the things. I like options.
WED 10:59 AM
Vidja games are the idealized work I was always meant to do. Building them, however, sounds awful to me.
WED 10:59 AM
Yeeeaaaah
WED 10:59 AM
Once the thing you do for fun becomes your job, it’s not as fun anymore.
WED 10:59 AM
Nothing like destroying your hobby by monetizing it.
WED 11:01 AM
It seems almost backwards. Shouldn’t we love getting paid for the things we enjoy doing?
WED 11:02 AM
It’s like it flips a switch in our brains once money is involved.
WED 11:03 AM
Doesn't hurt to dream and plan about the specs and requirements. Put all the things into the dream. If you want to build it, then you can ask yourself how to iterate into it then.
WED 11:03 AM
You aren't building for yourself when you commodify yourself in capitalism in the vast majority of cases.
WED 11:04 AM
Perhaps dreaming and thinking about this will be practice too.
WED 11:06 AM
That’s fair. I guess when you take the “labor of love” out of it and make it all about pushing numbers it’s not fun anymore.
WED 11:08 AM
Hmm... fair point. I just need to make baby steps. I need to do.
WED 11:10 AM
Honestly while I’m working at home I have the perfect opportunity to do sterf. I think I’ve just been being a blob because it’s easier. :/

I'm say now saying "been being a blob" like "wehadababyitsaboy"

My man, Peter Gibbons, says:  "We don't have a lot of time on this Earth! We weren't meant to spend it this way! Human beings were not meant to sit in little cubicles staring at computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements!" and later on in the movie, "I did absolutely nothing and it was everything I thought it could be."
WED 11:14 AM
Too true
WED 11:15 AM
The corporate buzz all just feels and IS so pointless. I hate it more than I thought I would.
WED 11:16 AM
How's it going? Looking forward to the weekend?
