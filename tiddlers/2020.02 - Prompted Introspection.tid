!! Audit:

* Short, idiosyncratic. 
* Trying to help my offspring understand what it's like to be a pseudo-cyborg of sorts has been on the brain.
* I'm grateful that I still have to answer questions designed for children because they help me make explicit a perspective as a dad.
* One-word answer. Lawdy. Adorable.
* Maybe I should have some kind of `/s` tag, lol.
* [[Linkfarmer]] notion shows up in thinking about lacking enough curation, I believe.
* Oh, I am so glad to be done with that giant "wish" push of questions.
** Although, I can see some of them may have to stay. Mixed feelings there.
* I have finally reached the each of [[Generic Prompts]]. It has taken many years. 
* Fuck it, I should contact The Blockchain Socialist. Not enough crypto[[pleft]]ists in the world.
