title: 2018.09.13 - Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

I'm enjoying the section on ethics. It's an intro, but I don't feel like anything is out of place. I'm hoping we'll get to the notions. I'm worried we won't talk about the unity of virtue and [[The Good]]. I'm worried that it will miss the telic features of Aristotle. But, we'll see.

Pointless though it may be (because who else really cares?), I'd like to shout out to Sir Husain Sarkar (I cannot speak to his Sainthood yet). Academically considered a nobody, but I think he's a man of profound honor. The man probably doesn't like me (what's new?), but having the chance to learn from and wrestle with him has been crucial to my life. It was luck to have him as my teacher, and I'm grateful. It's a weird feeling to be unable to effectively communicate one's gratefulness (weirder when the person would probably not be happy about the gratefulness?). I am at a loss for having such a gift; I can't repay it. I will remember you none-the-less, sir. May my work be an extension of yours. 

He is the only teacher to have cried in my classes (his father had died), and it was obvious how the words we read spoke to and through him. His emotion was highly trained, and his absolute respect for reason was something I hope to live up to. We might disagree on Aristotle and Kant, but not on their brilliance. He knows a face of this thing which we can all barely utter and point to. It is blinding. 

The vast majority of academics I know clearly do not understand how special Aristotle is in human history, but Sarkar knew. I stand in awe. I mean awesome here in the most traditional and transcendental sense. I am lucky to have seen even a glimpse of such a thing.
