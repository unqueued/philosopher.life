title: 2020.03.06 - Prompted Introspection: Assho'

!! If you died tomorrow, what would you most be remembered for?

I almost want to replay [[2018.05.06 - Prompted Introspection Log: Remembered]] and [[2018.05.09 - Prompted Introspection Log: Die Tomorrow]]. I hope that, in part, I would be remembered for being the dork who would consider doing such a thing if I died tomorrow.

For a while now, I have prepared for such an event. I want to make sure that my offspring can still hear me whenever they need or want (assuming they would, lol). I don't know if how I might be remembered after death would be much different than how I am remembered while living. 

I assume I will be remembered as that asshole.
