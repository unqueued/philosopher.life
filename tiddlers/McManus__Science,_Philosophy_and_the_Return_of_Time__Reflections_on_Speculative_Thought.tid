<<<
I  argue  that  Unger  and  Smolin  are too quick to turn to a heuristic account of the infinite, and indeed mathematics as a 
whole.  Their project advances too fundamentally anti-Platonic an agenda.
<<<

Preach, yo. 

<<<
This leads many physicists, for instance Roger Penrose,  to ascribe allegedly eternal physical laws a Platonic status, and  to  grant  the  mathematical  models  depicting  them  a  consequent  ontological  priority
<<<

Of course, there can be a difference between an implementation/instantiation/representation of the mathematical model and the model itself. That we can ask "can the laws of physics be different?" is already an indicator that it isn't some a priori absolute truth. Moving from the infinite of metaphysics to the finite of physics carries a fuckton of baggage.

It appears that contingency obtains in the physical universe, but mathematics is necessary. It would be an inductive leap of faith to claim physical laws are necessary. Eventually, you have to say it is a matter of faith. Empiricism is boned.

Overall, I'm a fan of Penrose, especially since he takes Gödel so seriously.

<<<
The first is that the universe, as we experience it,  is  the  product  of  relational  and  contingent  processes  which  lead  to  probabilistic  
outcomes. 
<<<

I cannot solve this core problem. I do not understand how contingency arises from necessity. I suggest it takes [[The Dialetheia]] to defuse Gödel's Ontological modal collapse. There is a place where even logic must fail for the [[fff]], hilariously, Gödel may also be pointing us to that as well.

<<<
Since the laws of nature are contingent, rather than necessary, the future remains undetermined
<<<

I guess you aren't trying to convince me at all, lol. I've always taken the laws of physics to be contingent if contingency exists (and, I surely hope it does). Interestingly, I cannot say it is not determined, since even determined things might be contingent; a causal chain itself may be contingent (the origins for example) while still admitting the necessity of instrumentality once that chain begins. Fatalism, of course, is another issue, and I think that is an even bigger problem in dealing with the infinitude of metaphysics. I do not know how to resolve these problems.

Probabilistic appearing yet determined is still possible. We also can never actually distinguish random from pseudorandom.

Unfortunately, I can't take a position on time just yet. It's real enough for me to be a moral agent; that's all I'm willing to posit.

<<<
Any ontologically rigorous account of reality must ultimately find a way to account for the infinite, both in its mathematical formulations and as it appears in nature.  
<<<

To whatever [[dok]] we can. Our access to the infinite is a serious problem. I hope to epistemically humble in how I approach the matter.

<<<
 While mathematicians and physicists might be dealing with immense and even indefinitely large quantities, they do not believe we  should  ascribe  any  significance  to  infinity  beyond  that  required  to  do  the  practical  work  of  everyday  science
<<<

Well, I think it depends on who you are talking to. I also think this is just part of the empirical vs. rationalist divide that still matters. I think of it like imaginary numbers. I have no idea how to ascribe reality to them, but the math clearly models the world well for us in a predictive way. I'm not in a position to define the ontic status of infinity or imaginary numbers beyond a Platonic finger pointing to the heavens. People are afraid to admit their reliance upon metaphysics; it's unpopular. I can see how it has been abused, but I can see there is no way around it either.

<<<
Unger  and  Smolin  conceive  of  the  infinite  as  essentially  a  heuristic  term;  one  with  
some  use  but  without  actual  substance.
<<<

As you know, "substance" is a technical word in philosophy. I believe the infinite is real. I do not wish to ascribe substance to it like ours unless I am forced. I can see that it's just a language game tool for them. 

<<<
Most involve simply trying to tame the infinite by suggesting that it is little more than a pragmatic tool that cannot be connected to any empirical object.  
<<<

I agree it cannot be fully understand by us how it is connected, but I think there are likely both empirical and analytic claims which point or require the connection. If anything is the pragmatic tool, it is our physical universe is service to the infinite.

<<<
Both these accounts of consciousness rely on mathematical insights about 
infinite  to  show  how  our  mind  is  not  entirely  determined  by  external  reality, 
<<<

I'm sorry, I think I need clarification here. I don't actually see why either of those accounts are necessarily doing that work, or why we should take them to be correct in it. I suggest they might only make room for the possibility at best here. Perhaps I'm just an idiot, so you'll have to forgive me. I'm just not convinced they succeed in the claim.

Gödel's linguistic limits show us that only the infinite has a chance of computing the infinite with completeness.

<<<
 He  maintains  that  consciousness  is  infinite  because  it  com
es  to  
recognize  its  own  status  as  Absolutely  free  through  being  able  to  will  its  own  causality.    
<<<

Sounds like a turing machine to me, unfortunately, we're finite. There are algorithms I really can't compute and consciously attend to as a whole (even if I can get to an answer). To that degree, perhaps we aren't conscious?

<<<
Consciousness is able to bring novelty into the world in a manner that is not determined 
by anterior natural laws, and is thus a creative and free being.
<<<

That is not clear to me. I remain open to the unfortunate possibility that consciousness is at least partially epiphenomenal. My freewill and consciousness can be detached. 

<<<
The  best  
consciousness  could  do  was  to  express  these  sublime  thoughts  in  art,  and  therefore  
mediat
e the paradox of being a potentially infinite subject within the absolute infinite of 
nature
<<<

I don't buy that our consciousness is infinite, or I will need to know the nature of its infinitude more plainly than you've expressed. How can we speak of the ineffable? At some point, I think we can only point. 

I know jackshit about Schelling. My wife is grabbing a book for me. It's definitely square in my problem search space in this wiki. The "self
-alienating Absolute unity" seems like an actual possible answer to me. Clearly, I have some serious reading to do.
