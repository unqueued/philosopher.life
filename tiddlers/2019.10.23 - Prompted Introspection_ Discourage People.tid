title: 2019.10.23 - Prompted Introspection: Discourage People

!! If you owned a store, what would you do to discourage people from stealing from you?

`/snarky faux answer as a capitalist`

`/define stealing in Real Hohfeldian analysis`

So glad to get that out of the way. Alright, so I need more information (SURPRISE!). There's so many kinds of stores, and I have a hard time seeing myself as a store-owner. What am I going to sell which I believe in that other people actually want to pay for (to the point I'd even worry about theft)? Lmao. 

Presumably, I'm a failure as a store-owner, and the odds are good that whatever is being stolen from me (such a complex and long list, though I'm hardly a significant victim) is in virtue of how the elite (and their reactionary horde) have structured society.<<ref "a">>

Worst part is this: I enjoy combat questions like this. I would adore having the chance to solve this kind of problem. I can only do so in virtual spaces though. There's no reasonable way to engage in it offline.
