!! Audit:

* This log is music to my ears. This is exactly what I think I need to do to develop this wiki.
* I still haven't found a reason for tagging. I keep looking. I think I'm still right. The ability to use the search bar seems to eliminate the issue.
* There is something delicious about doing facelifts. I need it, clearly.
* The preview addon has been amazing
* PPP nosedived, but I've been quite busy. Perhaps it will come back.
* I hope to really do a fantastic job this coming month. I'm back into the swing of it, I believe.
