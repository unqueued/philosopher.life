title: Voting: Conceptual Politization of Money

Long have we sought to distinguish money from power. We must understand this feedback loop very carefully.

It is absolutely crucial that we draw a bright line between financial capital and political capital as strongly as possible in a democracy. The political market must always control the economic, and never the other way around. That is wildly easier said than done (and perhaps conceptually impossible on a number of fronts). How do we give a voice to the future of humankind? How do we give a voice to those who deserve it the most? How do we give voice to the voiceless and unheard? How do we effectively decentralize real power?

Campaign finance reform is crucial. Campaigning, advertisement, and rhetoric are serious problems. We should be wise here and sometimes quite radical. Certain kinds of moves are just obviously wrong.

Preventing representatives from benefiting from any financial arrangements; true volunteers, or being forced to trade away their economic positions. 

Turning adjudication into more jury-peer oriented work is key.
