title: 2018.12.02 -- Retired: Magic: The Gathering

I do have my 10,000 hours in this game. I won a SCG5k and went second day at their annual thing. Magic is burned into my brain. I'm teaching my children how to play. I hope it is something we can do together for many decades to come. There are very few board games I enjoy playing. I don't play competitively anymore, but I like to screw around once in a while.
