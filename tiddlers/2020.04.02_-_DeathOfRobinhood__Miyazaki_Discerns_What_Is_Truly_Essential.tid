Ha. Preach, yo. What book is that?

Starting Point. A bunch of Hayao Miyazaki's early writings and talks.

Neat.

I recently saw a vidya of some kids showing Miyazaki their attempts to use ML to build unintuitive zombie animation movements, and he did not like it one bit. lol. Lemme see if I can find it.

He's probably right about that.
