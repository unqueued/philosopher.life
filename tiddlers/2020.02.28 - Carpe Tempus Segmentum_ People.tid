title: 2020.02.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: People

* Woke at 10
* Meditation
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** Thinking about just pulling Rigs/Matthew out of daycare if coronavirus strikes us more considerably. Given the amount of illness they've had, I can appreciate that.
** Regret and trying hard.
** My memory is failing me. I don't remember even half of what we discussed.
** Anxiety and depression in my offspring. 
* vits+meds+coffeebliss
* Dialecture
* Kitchen
* Fireman Time!
* Read
* Dialecture
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
* Working on drafts.
* Dialecture
* Prepped for breakfast for dinner
* We all made food together in the kitchen.
** We had read [[k0sh3k]]'s entries, so it made for an interesting discussion.
* Eat 
* Walked with wife
** I now have my very own beanie from clearance. It's warm and fits. I like that.
* Chatted with [[Sphygmus]]
** She's helping think through this with me. She has far more experience in this spot than I do. 
* [[Mathing]]...starting at the beginning again. Second pass.
* Talked with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
** Pleasantly surprised we had the chance. I didn't predict he'd have much in the gas tank left. It was late and he'd had quite a day.
** We had a rambly conversation. Went everywhere.
** Talked about school with my offspring.
** He told me a story of a boogie day. He bought a sandwich which was too expensive, he got a suit for the wedding, and he walked me through a day in a section of town trying to sell to him. 
*** I appreciate how concerned he is with not overindulging, in reasoning about privilege on a global scale. He aims to be content with limited material. 
*** Class, social status dynamics, hedonic treadmill, and being frugal. We agree that we are rich, and it's interesting to see a taste of climbing that economic ladder.
** Wandered in the paper. 
** Talked about parables and animation. 
*** He already does this, even if he doesn't have total control of the vision of what is produced.  
**** I think it suits him. He is a naturally skilled student of Humanity. Freeflow storytelling, he picks out what matters with high consistency. 
** We talked about games and family.
*** Pokemon, hipsters, toxic fans
*** Particularly caught by a story of throwing his gameboy into a body of water.
*** We talked about old friends in our games. 
** We thought about Jesus and standards of skepticism.
** Still thinking together about our fundamental disagreement. 
*** I think I find it smaller than he does.
*** The social and the divine; [[faith]] as personal vs. communal? Maybe.
*** He is exceptionally kind with me.

* Drink
* Sleep by 3?
