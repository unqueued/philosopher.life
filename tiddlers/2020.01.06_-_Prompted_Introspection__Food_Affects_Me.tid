title: 2020.01.06 - Prompted Introspection: Food Affects Me

!! How do you think eating junk food affects you?

I've recently answered a related question: [[2019.11.13 - Prompted Introspection: Junkfood]]. I've read some about how it affects me, and I could research enough to answer this question more specifically (but, I'm lazy). A proper answer is going to need to talk about different [[dok]] of junkfood too. I can say that junkfood is often pleasurable in an immediate way for me, but I don't feel right when I'm only eating junkfood. My body knows it needs fruits and veggies; my gut feels better when I have eaten decent food.

Beyond time and financial resources, I don't think junkfood is so much my problem as portions and how fast I eat. I do not give my body time to register that I'm full, and my portions are out of control. When I'm working with my hands, I have stronger immediate incentive to be in shape.

I'm hoping to use bliss more, alcohol less (often eat way more with alcohol), fast more (eating only within specific hours, or force fruits and veggies only outside that scope), drink far more liquid before a meal, eat slowly (need to just time myself or follow my daughter [as she has mastered this]). Junkfood isn't so much the monster for me, but being wise in how I feed myself is an uphill climb. I grew up poor, and I'm wired wrong (but, I can still fix this). I despise that I'm such a bad rolemodel for my offspring too. When my mind and body are busy without being stressed, I'm less likely to abuse this drug as an addiction.
