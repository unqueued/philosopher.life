title: 2018.04.25 - Prompted Introspection Log: Dream Interpretation

!! What is your interpretation of one of your recent dreams?

I'm notoriously bad at recalling my dreams. I am also extremely skeptical of what I do remember. Only in the half-lucid, almost awake dreamstates before I wake up do I have any memory that I can trust at all. I work hard to avoid confabulation and to be strongly confident, even when that means I deny myself whatever I initially thought I perceived in my dreams. It's important to me that I attempt to be accurate. I consider dream interpretation to be just another layer/extension of the confabulation chain.

I will not answer this question as you wish because I deny the value or meaning of its premises to a non-trivial extent. I do not understand why we dream, or even why we sleep. I have seen many good hypotheses, and I could ramble off an opinion if I were forced to give one. 

Dreaming is important to me because I believe it says something crucial about the nature of minds and consciousness. That the other animals dream is also very interesting. I do not think dreams have the meaning that astrologers, supernatural spiritualists, and religious believers impart to them though. 

I don't want to interpret my dreams to make them say exactly what I want them to say. The contents of the dreams may not ultimately be relevant. I just don't know. Until I have more evidence, what we are dreaming, essentially, is just less interesting to me than "why" or "how" or "that" we are dreaming.

Unfortunately, I'm not even sure if my hypnagogic states are even dreams in the first place. This may be all moot.
