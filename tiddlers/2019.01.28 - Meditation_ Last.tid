title: 2019.01.28 - Meditation: Last

This will be the last daily required meditation log. I'm not seeing any value in consistently continuing this. I'm still going to continue the practice and maintain it in my [[Carpe Diem]] log. As I have new things to say, when I finally get around to reading more on the topic, as my practice is shaped, I'll say more.

Maybe I should have a monthly kind of log here? I don't know.
