title: 2020.02.09 - Prompted Introspection: Take Me To Africa, Please

!! Which place would you most like to visit–Africa, China, Alaska–why?

Wtf, why is Alaska on here? I mean, don't get me wrong, I would really enjoy going to Alaska under the correct conditions. This is like asking if I want a bite of pizza or a feast+orgy for a fortnight with Victoria Secret models. 

This is a hard choice. I can say that someone with my name has had no-fly-listish troubles before; I'd worry about getting back into the country a bit (paranoia talking, surely). I would not want this wiki tied to my offline identity in China, but I am, of course, extremely curious about that big nation. Africa is huge though, and I think I'd learn the most from traveling throughout Africa. I've lived in East Asia, but I've zero experience anywhere near Africa. Africa it is.
