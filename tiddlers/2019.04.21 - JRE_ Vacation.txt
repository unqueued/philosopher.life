You have me exploring this. I've never seen it before. Lol.
13 HR AGO
I think [[k0sh3k]] is going to especially love it.
13 HR AGO
It's part of her daily routine to walk through comics.
13 HR AGO
Yeah, I also like the one a few over where the doctor tells him he has acorns lol
13 HR AGO
How's the trip going?
13 HR AGO
A little colder than rebecca would want
12 HR AGO
But kind of perfect for me lol.  Too cold to go in the ocean, but walks on the beach is great
12 HR AGO
Noice. [[k0sh3k]]'s dream (like her mother's) is to live next to the beach.
12 HR AGO
I like walking on the beach too. I don't really go barefoot enough.

Like walking on clouds, plus adds to my whole jesus vibe
12 HR AGO
Nobody messes with the Jesus.
12 HR AGO
Watched //Dogma// with the kids again last night, and Zizek vs Peterson the night before. Jesus and Zizek on the brain.
12 HR AGO
They laughed a lot more this time around. I think it was clicking more.
12 HR AGO
Zizek's talking makes me wish I had an unmbrella...  very "wet" way of talking
12 HR AGO
Sexy Slobber

Revelation: people like to go to the beach cause they like being acceptably drunk in public
9 HR AGO
It makes the beach way better

New game: water is cold and nowhere to pee.  What's the minimum distance from my seat that I must move to per in my swim trunks. Lol
9 HR AGO
Pee
9 HR AGO
The most drunk I have ever been
4 HR AGO
Took a lot of attempts to get that coherent
4 HR AGO
Lol!
4 HR AGO
Awesome.
4 HR AGO
I think you should walk up to someone to pee. Talk them and just go for it.
4 HR AGO
I am surprised you can type at all while that drunk, lol.
4 HR AGO
Bucket of oysters is fun to shuck, not so fun to throw up

Said on the way home, "well, I guess you get to hear how loudly I vomit tonight."
19 MIN AGO
Took a shit first, gave her a few flushes, folded a towel to kneel on, read on my phone until I was ready
18 MIN AGO
Grossest thought during the moment -- "wow, the gumbo appetizer still tastes good!"
17 MIN AGO
Lol. It's amazing that you have the ability shit first. I don't know which is worse. I think I'm dying when I shit or puke sometimes.
17 MIN AGO
Now just waiting for round 2
17 MIN AGO
=/
17 MIN AGO
Good that it still tasted good though. Gumbo probably isn't much different coming up.
