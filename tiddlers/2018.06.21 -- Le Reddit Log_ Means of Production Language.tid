title: 2018.06.21 -- Le Reddit Log: Means of Production Language

https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/8ssk82/why_dont_modern_socialist_parties_and_politicians/

If you cannot trace your political argument back to decentralizing the "means of production" language, I generally interpret you to still be "on the fence" between socialism and capitalism. You likely see deep problems with Capitalism, but you haven't sufficiently (which is not the same thing as "completely") traced out the recurring causal forces. It's a centrist position. I have a similar position for those who sit on a fence leaning towards Capitalism.
