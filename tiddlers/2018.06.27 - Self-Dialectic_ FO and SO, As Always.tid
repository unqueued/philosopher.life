title: 2018.06.27 - Self-Dialectic: FO and SO, As Always

You need to assume a [[FO]] axiom of [[The Good]] in order to be [[SO]] about it. Your fastmind must have a theory of [[The Good]] embedded in it, and we work over it, grow it, etc. If the Frontal Lobes are the Utilitarian Calculator/Inference Maker, the Slowmind Algorithm, then the corresponding Data structures are ultimately stored in the Fastmind.
