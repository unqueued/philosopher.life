title: 2007.04.13 -- A Night I Will Remember

Hmm...It has been a week. I'm ready to sleep.

Last night j3d1h jumped off the couch face-planting a book (and she is heavy, so that really can do some serious damage). Damnit child, how many times have I told you not to do that!?!11!? (jk) Anyways, her top tooth split open her bottom lip pretty well. She had blood gushing everywhere. We freaked out.

I didn't know how bad the situation was, so I reacted as if it were the worst. I soaked up blood and made sure j3d1h wasn't choking on it. I applied some pressure with a towel wrapped in a ice. (yeah, I know, I'm stupid). From what I understand, the head bleeds well (although the mouth regenerates quickly). In any case, it was a serious matter and I was a desperate parent--I do not take things lightly.

Of course, the cut wasn't that bad. But, at the time, I didn't know if this girl had a lip anymore or not. My main concern was making sure she wasn't going to bleed or choke. Lord have mercy, there have been very few times in my life where I was so filled with fear. That is one of the worst feelings in the world.Â 

We called our doctor immediately (busy)...we weren't going to wait. We called Janet-- Janet said it wouldn't hurt to have it checked out. While k0sh3k was on the phone I got j3d1h to calm down (and I calmed down too). The blood was coagulating (sp?) and the lip growing big. I sit down with her, she's past the shock, and then she realizes she's still in pain (and I know the difference in cries, I don't respond to whining, but I know this one hurt even from the sound coming from her mouth).

We examined her lip (had to pull it down and out to see the full extent of the cut). It was a decent length, but we couldn't tell how deep it was. By this time, I know my child is safe, so I've changed from surival mode to problem-solving mode. The cut was pretty deep though, and we decided to goto the hospital, even if it was likely j3d1h wasn't going to get stitches.

j3d1h was doing okay while distracted ...so we didn't know whether she needed to see the doctor or not. Better safe than sorry, right? So, we head to the hospital ER, check in, and the nurse brought a doctor into the triage room to see if the cut needed &quot;suturing&quot; as they put it. He examined my screaming child, and could not make a conclusion right then and there... (wtf, why not?). So...we wait for some crazy amounts of hours. After it gets 2-3 in the morning we finally in the actual ER. At this point, my child has been asleep on my neck for a bit, so she gets MIGHTY pissed off when we enter the ER. And, I mean, this girl was ferociously angry. She flat squalled for another 1 hour while we sat in the actual ER. I don't blame her, it was late, she should be sleeping, and instead she's bleeding out of a painful cut on her lip.

They examined her again and they decided to suture. Whether they decided to suture because we had stayed for so long (as if weÂ might have attitudes of this trip to the ER being a waste if they didn't do anything) or not I do not know. I think the head doctor gave valid justification for the stitches.

Let me tell you the worst part of my night: four people (me included) holding my child down while she has her lip stitched. We didn't just hold her down though. A kid that had been nearly unwillingly awake and screaming for the better part of the night, who generally dislikes any sort of restrainsts placed upon her, was literally fitted and strapped into a device designed to force the child into submission and stillness. My child, who is is truly my child, did not submit. Yet, still, the huge straps choking her body down to the board behind her did not contain her fury. I had to do it.

While I don't really care if I got stitches or whatever, watching them open, close, prod, and stick my child's wound over and over again while I not only sit by and watch, but help them do it by securing my child for her torture session, was traumatic for me. It had been a long day and an even longer night, and now I was helplessly requiredÂ to force my child to endure that mechanism of submission so that the needle, tweezers and wires could be used to stitch her lip. She fought the whole time, choking on her blood and snot. Through our containment of the child, Her face and her limbs were compressed, almost to the point of bruising. Man, I didn't want to do that--I'd give anything not to have to do that again.Â I know I had to do it.

I don't know which is really worse: a.) being helpless, and not in control of my child's future and welfare (like the beginning) or b.) Causing my child great pain, even if it is best for her in the end (you sit there and do it, it isn't so easy as you might think)

I realize these are both two different coins, both with different sides (and I have mixed, yet exceptionally strong feelings regarding them). The first eventually leads to my child making her own choices (good and bad ones I assume), choices that will be meaningful one's in God's eyes. I hear that is a pretty necessary precondition to be of value to God.Â The second is useful, it allows me to cultivate a fruitful child in the end, one that will be passed over as Judgement falls upon those who did not have her painful training.

What a night.
