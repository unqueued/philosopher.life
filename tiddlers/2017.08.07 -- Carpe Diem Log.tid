title: 2017.08.07 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up very early, but before the alarm clock. I was anxious.
* My rash is getting worse.
* I spent what felt like a long day at work, even though I didn't do much.
* My children did not clean the living room.
* Light Cannabliss!
* I got a lockable toolbox and chain, since they won't let me transport tools on a daily basis between my car and worksite (shuttle). 
* The kids made up or it by making dinner. 
* We watched two episodes of Rick and Morty.
* Writing, then bed.
