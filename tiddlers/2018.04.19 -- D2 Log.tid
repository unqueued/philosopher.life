Finding nothin but gems, charms, jewels, and low end runes. Turns out, Lo was what I was missing for Grief. I decided to complete it. It's the end game smiter weapon. With it, I now have a complete smiter (though far from perfect). 75% CB, Grief, Triple Absorb, Upp Zak, etc. I'm going to be able to farm the ubers. Never played a smiter before. Pretty awful for minion clearing. 

Got the sorc out and ran Nith for keys (he dropped two in a single go). She can do it cleanly, but it's not safe enough to /p8 it.

Lilith was absolute cake. Izrael insanely simple. I did the Treachery trick, and I'm glad I did. The minions are literally the only hard part. I had a really hard time against Duriel though. I died multiple times on CRs, and everything was so fucking fast. That map would not be so bad if I could teleport. Without Teleport, it's a real bear. Even the minions were dropping me to half in a single hit. Mind you, I have maxed Defiance for my Holy Shield. 20k Armor is not great, but it's also not awful. Highest I've ever had, that's for sure. 

I was eventually able to do enough white-knuckle kiting to make the kill and get out. 

I spawned Uber Tristram. All three were stacked on top of each other, and they would not let me pull them out. So, I said fuck it, and ran in. I went for Mephisto first because he is the badass. I FORGOT to put Salvation on (doh!), but I was lucky enough to Treachery. I had to pot once. I crushed them hard and fast. 

I'm glad I didn't try this on the necro. 

I have a 16/10 Assassin Torch now! Yay!
