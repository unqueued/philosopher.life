[5:05 PM] h0p3: /wave
[5:05 PM] h0p3: Hope life is going well for you, homie.
[5:27 PM] Shp: h3ll0 h0p3
[5:27 PM] h0p3: h1
[5:27 PM] Shp: I've been super busy with procrastination
[5:28 PM] Shp: so I haven't even read through the omg I can't even recall its name.
[5:28 PM] h0p3: You have been swamped, drowning even. Hopefully, you're going easy on yourself.
[5:29 PM] Shp: yup. I didn't expect to find quicksand in the desert
[5:30 PM] h0p3: https://www.wikihow.com/Get-out-of-Quicksand
[5:30 PM] h0p3: I hear that.
[5:30 PM] Shp: your phenomenology tiddler! I have seen it, didn't get to the end yet
[5:30 PM] h0p3: Oh, well, give that one some time.
[5:30 PM] Shp: which is sad cuz it aint even that long
[5:31 PM] h0p3: I'm not even done with it.
[5:31 PM] h0p3: It's stupid hard to read. Ignore it at will.
[5:31 PM] h0p3: So what you been up to with your beautiful procastination and otherwise?
[5:32 PM] h0p3: I feel like I've been spinnin' my wheels as of late.
[5:33 PM] Shp: i can't  ignore it!  and don't want to either
[5:35 PM] Shp: I'm trying to think of something that is relevant to you
[5:35 PM] Shp: but I'm drawing a blank
[5:35 PM] h0p3: Lol. Alrighty.
[5:35 PM] Shp: been wasting my time
[5:36 PM] h0p3: Love, Death & Robots needs to be one of the ways you are "wasting" your time. It's fun! :smiley:
[5:36 PM] Shp: ive watched love death+robots too
[5:36 PM] Shp: haha!
[5:36 PM] h0p3: lol
[5:37 PM] Shp: :D i actually wanted to mention it to you a week or two ago but when i checked yr wiki it was there
[5:38 PM] h0p3: What did you enjoy most about it?
[5:40 PM] Shp: the robots! :D i love anthologies in general like black mirror or even older stuff like the outer limits
[5:41 PM] h0p3: There is nothing wrong with your television set.
[5:41 PM] h0p3: Those all seem solid to me. See, can't be wasting your time. Robots, dude.
[5:42 PM] h0p3: I love having shows in common with my kiddos. It is rare that we get to watch a new show that we see for the first time together.
[5:42 PM] h0p3: I felt like a kid again watching it.
[5:43 PM] h0p3: (though far cooler than anything I got to watch as a kid)
[5:44 PM] Shp: :D i wish stuff like this existed when I was younger too!
[5:44 PM] h0p3: Kids these days. Have it so easy. We had to walk uphill both ways in the snow.
[5:45 PM] h0p3: Btw, I would be grateful to explore any list of shows you think I should explore.
[5:46 PM] Shp: I'm looking at your list now
[5:47 PM] h0p3: I'm not very fast about it, but when I'm in the mood (which eventually happens), I like to have high signal-to-noise ratio ([[S2NR]]) stuff to watch. You wanted to marry one of my favorite shows, so...you gotsa know what it do.
[5:47 PM] Shp: inside no 9 is missing, I definitely recommend it.
[5:48 PM] h0p3: Coming down now.
[5:49 PM] Shp: its uhm. I like it. lemme know if you end up hating it :D
[5:49 PM] h0p3: Lol. That's fine too.
[5:49 PM] Shp: but its an anthology as well, quality varies per ep
[5:51 PM] h0p3: I am always in debt to those who give me solid recommendations. Sometimes it takes me a couple tries to get into something too.
[5:53 PM] Shp: electric dreams was disappointing for me but probably because I had way too big expectations because of Philip K. Dick
[5:54 PM] Shp: lots of my favs are on your list btw
[5:54 PM] h0p3: I am shocked, I tell you. :smiley:
[5:54 PM] h0p3: I tried to get into electric dreams, but it didn't stick with me. I will have to try again.
[5:55 PM] Shp: its not as good as it should be..
[5:56 PM] h0p3: No, I take it back, I tried getting into:  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
[5:56 PM] Shp: im interested to see what they'll do with the foundation series. I hope it will be good!
[5:57 PM] Shp: oh! sorry. so electric dreams is an anthology show based on  short stories by Philip K Dick
[5:58 PM] h0p3: Hard to get science fictions books I love correct on the screen.
[5:58 PM] h0p3: I will probably skip out on Foundation.
[5:58 PM] Shp: yeah, I'm afraid foundation is going to be disappointing but I'll give it a shot!
[5:59 PM] h0p3: You have probably read it (it sounds like you have consumed far more than I have): Hyperion.
[5:59 PM] h0p3: That has an anthology thing going on too.
[5:59 PM] Shp: nope, I havent even heard of it yet!
[5:59 PM] h0p3: Thinking about re-reading it with my bro anyways. I want to see why he's extra hooked on it.
[6:00 PM] h0p3: Well, I will recommend it. It aint Dune or Foundation, but it's solid.
[6:00 PM] h0p3: Braincandy
[6:01 PM] Shp: cool! I'll definitely read it!
[6:02 PM] Shp: as for tv recommendations: I think mindhunter is quite good.
[6:03 PM] Shp: I'm generally not interested in the topic it explores, but dexter was great too and it is of similar subjects :)
[6:04 PM] h0p3: I will try it again. Dexter stuck, but Mindhunter did not.
[6:04 PM] h0p3: That is coming down as well.
[6:04 PM] Shp: not many things are as good as Dune or Foundation :)
[6:05 PM] h0p3: Ah, we are spoiled. Kids these days.
[6:06 PM] h0p3: By the way, is there a word you think I should fallibly attempt to define? I've asked my wife as well. I think I should ask around. I often don't know where I am supposed to go.
[6:08 PM] Shp: yup!
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
[6:08 PM] Shp: just kidding, Sphygmus will enjoy this if she sees it :)
[6:08 PM] h0p3: Lol.
[6:09 PM] h0p3: I bet she will. /wave :smiley:
[6:11 PM] h0p3: Speaking of dziggetai, [[T42T]] Nomad, I have a request for you: if you would like a different name on my wiki, please tell me. I will encrypt your information and set it aside, and you can have the name of your choosing.
[6:11 PM] Shp: youve gotta be kidding me
[6:11 PM] h0p3: I will excise/replace the information that resides on it as well*
[6:12 PM] Shp: I actually thought about this today
[6:13 PM] Shp: how much work it'd be for you to change my name and whether or not you'd change it in the archived wikies as well
[6:13 PM] h0p3: I cannot change the archives. I am sorry.
[6:13 PM] h0p3: It is an Orwellian problem.
[6:13 PM] Shp: haha
[6:13 PM] Shp: it does not make any sense to change it now then, does it?
[6:14 PM] h0p3: Ah, I will argue to you that privacy and anonymity come in degrees.
[6:14 PM] Shp: im just gonna have to change my name irl, lol!
[6:14 PM] h0p3: Well, the offer stands.
[6:17 PM] Shp: let's do it!
[6:17 PM] Shp: maybe that'll ltf for me
[6:18 PM] h0p3: Ha. Good.
[6:20 PM] Shp: i'm trying to come up with a name
[6:20 PM] h0p3: Take your time.
[6:22 PM] h0p3: You have qTox (or any Tox client)?
[6:23 PM] Shp: nope
[6:23 PM] h0p3: A protonmail?
[6:23 PM] Shp: nope
[6:23 PM] Shp: I don't get why it makes sense for you though.
[6:24 PM] Shp: to use them
[6:24 PM] h0p3: Why's that?
[6:24 PM] Shp: I think you wrote about it
[6:24 PM] Shp: you end up posting it anyway
[6:27 PM] h0p3: Aye. It's true. Very little is ever REDACTED.
[6:28 PM] h0p3: I will continue to argue that privacy and anonymity come in degrees. I'm still a fan of such tools even with my absurd openness.
[6:57 PM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
[6:59 PM] Shp: :D
[7:12 PM] Shp: still fighting with the username issue btw, takes forever
[7:14 PM] h0p3: Lol. Take as much time as you want. No rush.
[7:18 PM] Shp: I like the reference to breaking bad in the pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis tiddler
[7:18 PM] h0p3: Only the best shows for you, sir.
[7:19 PM] h0p3: My favorite: ð“‚¸ð“‚¸ð“‚¸ð“‚¸ð“‚¸ð“‚¸ð“‚¸ð“‚¸
[7:20 PM] h0p3: I've decided, some unicode genius was looking out for me. I have a guardian angel or something picking out symbols for me.
[7:22 PM] Shp: you lost me there
[7:23 PM] h0p3: I like dumb unicode symbols. Lol.
[7:23 PM] h0p3: I use those symbols in the tiddler.
[7:24 PM] Shp: i see :)
[7:24 PM] h0p3: Sometimes, it will be better for you to think of me as your retarded 12 year old brother.
[7:25 PM] Shp: nah, I think of you as someone who would probably be better off with more appropriate (smarter) company
[7:33 PM] Shp: I choose the word dziggetai as my chosen "name", thank you.
[7:34 PM] h0p3: I adore it.
[7:35 PM] h0p3: You can change it again later if you wish, btw.
[7:35 PM] Shp: random word generator to the rescue! :D I laughed at it because of ignorance, so it shall be a good choice!
[7:36 PM] Shp: neat. my name is going to be different in every other version of your wiki :smile:
[7:36 PM] h0p3: We will need to create a tool for such a thing.
[7:37 PM] Shp: :D if you were using a single file it would be "easy peasy"
[7:38 PM] h0p3: My [[RGM]] actually generates a singlefile every minute. We are prepared to decompile when necessary. I'm actually going to have to search for your name to weed it out.
[7:39 PM] Shp: I'm sorry for causing trouble
[7:39 PM] h0p3: Naw, lol.
[7:39 PM] Shp: I appreciate your effort
[7:39 PM] h0p3: It's no trouble.
[7:43 PM] Shp: did I mention to expect weirdness from inside no 9? it is important to do so. :D
[7:44 PM] h0p3: I appreciate that. Thank you. I will keep my mind open.
[7:49 PM] Shp: earlier
[7:49 PM] Shp: when you asked for a word to define
[7:54 PM] Shp: maybe this doesn't even make sense :D

editing jumped to my mind.. but what I'd like to talk about/hear your angle on is not really a definition of the word, but a definition and "subtools" of it as a tool or a skill.

we edit text, movies, photographs, all sorts of things.
I wonder if there are commonalities and underlying techniques/strategies among all the uses of editing
[7:55 PM] Shp: maybe I'm exercising complexophilia again
[7:55 PM] h0p3: Naw.
[7:55 PM] h0p3: That's an important question.
[7:56 PM] h0p3: Sounds like a good antipleonasm too.
[7:56 PM] h0p3: It's such a broad question. I will need to think about it.
[7:57 PM] Shp: I've thought about bringing it up in a letter but I don't seem to get around writing those....
[7:58 PM] Shp: thank you! :)
[8:01 PM] Shp: one more note on the TV stuff: do not, under any circumstance, watch falling skies. it is a huge waste of time!
[8:02 PM] h0p3: Noted, lol. Thank you.
[8:02 PM] h0p3: My gut instinct is that I won't be immediately useful to you in this word. Editing is about having a vision of the good, the for the sake of which, the [[gfwiwcgws]] of what is being edited. To me, talking about the [[end]] of a thing is necessary to talking about the means to achieving it.
[8:04 PM] Shp: that's already useful! although you can come to results by editing aimlessly as well.
[8:04 PM] h0p3: Yes, randomness is necessary for evolution. Empiricism requires it. It is the only fair way to become biased.
[8:05 PM] h0p3: We have to take the risk of generating accidents [[irwartfrr]].
[8:07 PM] h0p3: Once you have an ideal in mind, you are able to ask how your unedited object differs and why it differs. That might require studying, exploration, and trying variations until you see improvements. The preference is to be able to articulate up front what needs to be fixed though.
[8:08 PM] Shp: now that we ventured into something meaningful, I have to go. to be continued!
have a great evening!
[8:08 PM] h0p3: You too! :smiley:
