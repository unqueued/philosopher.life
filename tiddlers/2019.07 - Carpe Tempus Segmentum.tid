!! Audit:

* I've been meditating some more, which is fine.
* I've not been doing the [[Fitness Routine]] nearly enough. 
** You really need to get back into it, homie.
* We've not really been watching a show every night, and considering the amount of material we need to cover, I think that needs to be addressed.
* Back to the regular sleep schedule, up way late most of the time. unless I've been drinking.
* These all blur together for me. They look the same.
* After the offspring left, I decided we needed to change up how we did our tech. It's been a good call.
* I've been using cannabliss more. I'm about out. It's been more than 3 years since I've purchased.
* Like it owes me money, no doubt.
* I've been drinking a lot of tea, and my stomach doesn't like it when I don't eat fruits and vegetables (particularly veggies, I think).
* Not as many incompletions.
** Keep it up!
* It was lower stress without my offspring, and the whirlwind hit hard when they came back. I'm going to continue to grind with them as best I can.
