Dear [[kickscondor]],

You are on my mind often. You are a household name for us. I'm grateful to reach into the darkness for each other's hands, to read between the lines, to faithfully [[fff]]ingly model each other, and to connect with you over the chasm. I suspect I say little or nothing new to you, but realtalk is priceless, sacramental, sacrificial, and my honor.<<ref "wh">>

I've been reading through our [[hyperconversation]] again. Among my failures, I have failed to "[[engage in relaxed wrestling and leisurely discussion|2018.09.17 - kickscondor: Dogmackic]]" with you. I am sorry. I despise being anti-funsies so often.<<ref "nc">> I fear I have but one currency to spend. I'm a foolish man of frustratingly little middle ground. As I have come to see again and again, with honor, you hold up your end of the [[T42T]], even when I fail.

Philosophy is super cereal bidness to me (and that means everything is), even in the use of irony, humor, grufeling, and relaxation.<<ref "e">> I'm retarded and plenty evil; I blindly have no idea how to let go (the more I look at it, the more I don't even know what it means to let go). Ancient leisure is intense to me. Saint Socrates walked around holding [[The Good]] as the first principle for determining everything else, and he couldn't let it go either (it's why people either loved or hated him with little in between, at least as the stories go).<<ref "tg">>

>What do you think decentralizing power really means? We have to empathically give a shit about each other’s stories. […] My point of contention is not with the preservation of the underground (which I applaud) but a world in which the centralization of power is maintained through automation and dark UX so profound we can’t escape it.

You’re always asking me to clear up my terms—and I never do—but I’ll ask anyway:
<<<

I think it's fair to say you have at least [[a minor non-cognitivist anticodificationist streak|2018.12.03 - Link Log: Please]] in you.<<ref "ti">> I appreciate your cautious yet chillaxed approach to defining; I suggest it demonstrates your sanity. I can only assume you have sorted through so many definitions over the decades that you find few hold merit. You are a person of great doubt to me, and that is only qua profound belief; it appears you have been burned something awful. As usual, //I have no satisfactory answers//. It is a sign of praise that you would ask me for my definition.

I've been thinking for over two months (!!!) on your letter. I'm sorry I'm taking forever; you set me on fire and sent me off to think way deep in the desert, and thank you. In addition to digesting your words, I've been busy filling this digital cardboard dumpster-house with my usual cybertrash.

Want to hear something insane, [[kicks]]? ...No, no, no, I mean beyond my usual gibberish in this wiki.<<ref "f">> ...Alright, sometimes, when I'm walking by myself, I literally rehearsively converse with my model of you in person out loud. Like any decent crazy person, I talk to myself and my imaginary friends (though I try not to freak out the normies around me). What a delicious human experience it is, speaking with [[a model of a model of a model of you|IATVMOASRM]], or at least so I imagine. Me, myself, and I am surrounded by absurd persons. We all are, except when we aren't.

`/snap`. I'm rambling again. Anyway, I've been thinking about this particular line above for a while. I don't think you "never do" at all,<<ref "as">> though that must be your point. You aren't writing random noise to me. Worst case scenario: you indirectly or unintentionally still define much in our dialectic. Further, this aint no Chinese Room even if I can't explain how terms terminate all the way down. As usual, I'm still trying to decode your blargles, an endless tunnel into the clearing, but I've [[faith]] I get closer to understanding your intentional terms and even part of you bit by bit.<<ref "ic">> I have a difficult time pointing to anyone who isn't engaged in [[Public Self-Modeling]] to at least a minor [[dok]] when they communicate in public.

You know I know you know I follow you through Satan-itself,<<ref "pe">> a devoiding RSS client,<<ref "RSS">> right? So, initially, I read it stripped down and out of context in bewildered adoration of the words alone before moving on to see the complete vidya.<<ref "sp">> I very much enjoyed the [[gem]] even if I didn't understand it, though I'd like to think you would be pleased with that too. Whatever it is, it is all that it is; your pile is a dialectical result of you and an extension of your rainbow-pinning hyperidentity. Even if it isn't all of you (and, of course, I agree it can never be a complete model), it is both generated part and semblematic representation of you, and you cleared up your terms so [[beautiful]]ly for us. Now, I know you hate pointless emotional responses, so I'll be brief (as I usually am, [[ITS]]): but I [[love]] the absolute garbage which [[spills|/b/]] out of your filthy [[guts|Antipleonasm Analysis]], [[kicks]].<<ref "wc">> 

<<<
what do you mean by ‘power’?
<<<

Thank you for asking me to define [[Power]]. It's a big question. I've been asked to define [[Hugs]] and [[pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis]] by [[others]]. You asked me to define something which is quite cereal; it's a topic embedded in my work and our conversation. I appreciate the thoughtfulness of your guidance here. Indeed, that is a word I may need to define and refine again and again. Thank you for fronting material in the dialectic as well; I think that is an honest show of good faith.

<<<
 And what do you mean by ‘decentralizing power’?
<<<

When I do, I'm almost always speaking of decentralizing //political// power. Thus, on my current definition, decentralizing political power is decentralizing human power-over [[others]]. This, of course, is absurdly broad.<<ref "ab">> It's infeasible to enumerate all of the power-overs and Hohfeldian rights clusters, but I think we can empirically improve and fry the bigger fish first (or we're at least obligated to try our best). Sometimes I think we both agree federation and representation are necessary in many political contexts, computations, and decision procedures. 

One of my audacious assumptions is that fair networks and governments should be built on P2P trust. Further, I'm claiming decentralizing power requires cyclical patterned redistribution of both wealth and the means of production, especially seeking to maximize the utility of those at the bottom (which is neither of us). Building stable representative democracy in which each of our accounts of [[The Good]] are weighed fairly with each other in the 21st Century should look wildly different than the previous attempts.<<ref "pa">>

Of course, not all cases and kinds of political power can be decentralized. Widespread agreement can also be a kind of centralization of power virtualized on top of decentralized power. It's also crucial to me to protect and enable dissenting opinions (another reason I want decentralized infrastructures).

<<<
 Because my first stab is that you’re talking about getting us back to local governments, tribes or something.
<<<

I was surprised to see this from you, and I'm not sure why you think that. I'm grateful to your first stab. Thank you. Indeed, I've done a terrible job explaining my position. I'm sorry.

I agree local governments are necessary (though I certainly have no intention of eliminating larger governments, far from it). Further, I'm unable to provide a beautiful definition of locality when we peel it out of geographic proximity. I also agree that tribal-like outgrouping is conceptually necessary, however, but I think outgroups should have a radically protected ability to have their voices heard and computed in the scaling Rule of Law.

I'm hardly a minimalist when it comes to government; [[we must all participate in our governance|The Original Position]]. Whether we want to be or not, we are political animals. My concept of decentralization is about building a global voice, a philosopher king, from the ground up. Every person's identity should shape that which rules us. I think we can actualize the social contract far more than most want to admit is possible. Of course, I do not predict what I expect of us all will obtain. Feel free to call me a naive or ignorant idealist (or worse, lol). 

<<<
 The term ‘power’ gets bandied about—it’s the person with the money to hire, the person who radios the tanks when to roll in and when to back out, it’s the person with the megaphone.
<<<

Who do you believe doesn't bandy the word "power" about unwisely? 

Those are examples of power, no doubt. In fact, those are examples of common problematic locations for the centralization of power. Money, military, and media control are currently quite centralized. The will of the few unjustifiably dominates [[others]] to a significant degree in these domains, and it generally has through history. Indeed, I seek to decentralize the power of those locations asap.

There are many domains and [[dok]] of power to concern ourselves with. As [[you've pointed out|https://www.kickscondor.com/memory-of-the-world]], knowledge is a power; in fact, it forms a cluster of many [[dok]] of other powers. I demand that everyone is educated and as wise as possible in their context; knowledge should not be centralized more than is conceptually necessary (it is a grave crime against [[Humanity]]). 

Power doesn't have to be huge though. However marginal it may be, my ability to walk up to someone and say "hello" is also a power-over myself, them, and [[others]] to some [[dok]]. When I step on a blade of grass or when I chop down or plant a tree, I'm also exercising a power-over future [[others]]. I have an extremely hard time pointing to any moment of my day which isn't ultimately moral and political in virtue of power (but, of course, we must be practical in how we aim to solve such an intractable problem for the finite).

<<<
I’m not really keyed in on ‘power’—I don’t see it as a kind of natural element.
<<<

At least on my definition, that doesn't appear accurate to me. It appears you sometimes avoid the topic and confrontation in general. You are quite tolerant; I can see why you might not feel like you are keyed in on power, especially as it is commonly understood. It is clear that power is definitionally going to be the means to your ends though, and insofar as you are hypothetically and categorically rational, it will be in virtue of having been keyed in on [[power]] [[irwartfrr]]. 

Also, I see no reason to think power is unnatural either. Perhaps I'm going to need you to define that weasel word "natural" for me, which has been used beg the question and sneak in more content than almost any other word I can name. I'm reading this book, [[Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present]]. It's a blast, and I think it does a fine job of showing how power, including political power, arises (and falls) in even the physicalist's natural world.

<<<
Seems more like it gets used to say: //this//, this is evil.
<<<

That's also okay, right? You wouldn't be ironically pointing out the evil of pointing out evil. Sometimes outrage and corrosive discourse are justified; we desperately need to pick out when power is used for evil (or when it is even evil to have that power). Moral superiority is real even if most displays of righteous indignation (or dismissal) are invalid. I hope to come to understand your personal theory of [[irwartfrr]] and [[gfwiwcgws]] as well.

Dasein is not going to emerge from the ready-to-hand mode when nothing is wrong. When his hammer breaks (the expergefacient event), his ray of intentionality is `/snap`ped into another dimension, his flow is broken, and he is pulled out of the zone only to be hurled into the present-at-hand mode to consciously investigate the world around him for a suitable replacement for that hammer, to reason about hammerness, to think about the instruments and ends around him more broadly. In cases where the hammer doesn't break and when construction is hunky-dory, the issue of power is far less likely to creep into your [[phenomenology]]. Evolutionarily, you might think of this as an "if it aint broke, don't fix it" energy-efficiency built into our probabilistic modeling of the world around us. Of course, we can be wrong about how we feel and reason about power.

Our autonomy can be used for [[good]] and [[right]] things as well! Making https://href.cool/ required power-over your machines (and many other things), and moreover, it even required power-over an infrastructure controlled by [[others]] to make is deliverable on the internet. Even its contents are political. Your sites are extensions of your identity in [[The Dialectic]], and it takes power to create and maintain them.

<<<
How to decentralize power? In a world of billions? Answering these questions is way beyond me.
<<<

Well, at some point, into idealism, these questions are beyond any of us. We can never do it perfectly all the way down. I don't think they are completely beyond you at all in a practical sense though. In fact, it's obvious that your work on the indieweb and love of Dat are attempts to decentralize power, even in a world of billions (even if that isn't what you adore about them). Saint Kant is going to ask you to hypotheticalize a world in which everyone acted on your maxims (or perhaps something roughly like them). Would that be reasonable for [[Humanity]] (especially behind the [[VOI]])?

Further, just because you don't know the best answer available to you doesn't mean you aren't morally obligated to pursue it. I'm a little bit shocked that you, a former computer expert, can't imagine ways in which to decentralize power in computing beyond what you've got so far (I assume you are sandbagging me here). 

You do actually work on the problem (you certainly haven't given up), but maybe you've over-pragmatized your approach just a bit.<<ref "co">> Though perhaps you are already doing so, I am surprised you don't walk me down this path and show me how stupid I am (in your gentle manner, ofc). I'm double-dog daring dawg: ''show me''. Go ahead and pin me, wrastler. If you are correct, I will cry "uncle" and give up. 

What do you think merits [[hope]] in this case, and why?

<<<
My wavelength is watching ‘humanity’—are we holding on to the transcendent ‘divinity’/‘shittiness’ of being human? Can we see this humanity in each other and at least allow the recognition of another human being to dawn on our faces?
<<<

It's why I [[love]] and like you, [[kicks]]. [[YWSOAM]]. I see it on your face. You really don't give a shit about power merely for power's sake, and even if you may be slightly confused about the conditions under which it is possible and what it means to say it (whereas, surely I am far more confused), I'm convinced you do have an [[end]] in mind. 

Imho, this is why our conversations have depth. We are both profoundly concerned with this space. I don't think you are just "watching" though (regardless of how obviously skilled you are); you are acting on it too. In both observation and action, you will need to reason about the instrumental means and particles necessary to achieving the ends of your wavelengths.

Of course, we enter into difficult territory with your tentpeg. I'm forced to conjecture here, sir. I agree that we contain an image, a copy, a corresponding representation of the divine. We're machines (perhaps excepting our freewill), but the content we process and choose requires the divine. I cannot say any of us are divine beyond our ability to perceive, contribute to, or be constituted by the divine, but I will admit to being otherwise shitty. Ensuring we justifiably experience what appears to be the transcendent is one of my jobs as a philosopher. To the extent which the divine transcends us, it is outside us by definition; we are lucky to just hold onto its tail or nomadically chase it in the desert.

<<<
I like to think of it as an ‘antimisanthrophic’ effort to at least establish a baseline sympathy or pity or some kind of comfort with our other peoples. Being a person is rough—we have no idea what’s going on here.// Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? //
<<<

That is a [[beautiful]] and even [[right]] sentiment with contextualization. I'm curious to know when you think misanthropy toward an individual is ever justified (I suggest even that process must be antimisanthrophicized as best we can).

At least at face value, empathy is something we agree on (though even sociopaths are skilled empaths), and I think we should attempt to empathize with every person (though, it becomes complex when we empathize with psychopaths, and it's also complex to empathize with collectives over time). I don't think the kid born with a silver spoon in his mouth deserves nearly as much of our energy and pity as the starving kid who doesn't usually register in our minds (most people try to block it out, quite successfully). You have to empathize with the ideal forms of people too, and you have to empathize with [[Humanity]] as a whole. Further, moral empathy is not simply observational; it's going to require action. Effective Antimisanthropy^^tm^^ is going to require analyzing power structures in the world and using your power to change them [[irwartfrr]]. Ultimately, and this part sucks: justified empathy obligates violence and hatred in some cases.

<<<
 (Perhaps I don’t take ‘power’ seriously enough. If none of us did—would it still be ‘power’?)
<<<

We may continue to butt heads on this issue, or at least we are feeling our way toward better answers.<<ref "sa">>

Perhaps to a fault you avoid thinking about power in some respects. Your method of empathy is profound, and it is why I admire what I consider to be one of your minor mistakes in avoidance (it's a damned good mistake). You seek out the weirdos and generally the less powerful. I will argue that you seek to collect and give voice to the crazies and cottonpickers in the fields. Of course, even if insufficient, that is a necessary approach to decentralizing power. I will continue to argue to you that the flypaper constructed underground is not as morally valuable as tilling the foundations for grassroots and digital rhizomes. I am convinced it is the only possible answer to otherwise certain slavery and destruction, but I also think it's the right thing to do.

I suppose I don't know what it means to take power seriously [[irwartfrr]] beyond trying to be moral [[irwartfrr]]. Are you actually doing the best you can with what you have? That's as serious as it gets to me.

To your question: it is power even if we don't wish to recognize it or take it seriously. In fact, we aren't fully aware of our power. That is always a moral problem to solve. [[Virtue is Knowledge]], but there comes a point where ignorance is not malicious, of course.

<<<
>    I will continue to argue for radical decentralization and worldclass p2p filtering. That is the only out, and the window may be closing. It can’t just be done by hand. We go down if the masses do.

Gah, I’m not convinced that technology has any answers! We can’t make some elaborate mousetrap that will enforce the life we want to live.
<<<

There! That's it. The Hoth system. You've come out and said it, and it's a helluva tentpeg to be holding in your hand. Are you sure you mean to say it this strongly? You seem to adore technical art and yet presumably feel a disillusionment earned through expert observation of computing in the world. How much do you want it to be true, and why do you think this is true? Do you have sufficient justification? The consequences of your claim are enormous. 

Many animals engage in teleological reasoning sufficient for tool use and techne, including building mousetraps. They are dynamic (though I cannot say conscious or sapient) in how they reason and evolve the image and implementation of their arts. The physical world is a computer, and technology need not be silicon-based. All the structures of society are tools. We are tools too, though hopefully not mere tools. Even as ends, our lives are profoundly instrumental.

The trap is already here, and it always has been. If at all, what kind of trap are you going to work for? It almost sounds like you've given up, and maybe that's because you can see something I do not. The consequence of your words appears to possibly slip into anarchism to the extent that you deny the possibility of justifiably governing ourselves. If not, why? What is justified and effective government, and what makes it possible or impossible? Governments are computers; excepting our freewill (something I take on faith), we are computers, and the world is a computer.

I need evidence for this contrarian pessimism which borders on justifying apathy, and I think I have the moral right to ask for it. I've known plenty of people who worked with complex human-driven systems for a living who became skeptical through observing what is usually accomplished with these instruments and then overreductively induced an artificially narrowed scope of what is possible. Despite your wonder, you also sometimes feel like a cynical jaded husk to me. Though, crucially, you lack compassion fatigue in many respects (and that itself may be a kind of miracle). I'm not sure what to make of it, and again, I'm only able to guess here. Your actions and arguments appear split to me (and surely you must say the same of me).

<<<
Of course, I’m not sure humans have any answers either!
<<<

That is a kind of answer too, human.

I can appreciate not being certain. I don't think the standard of knowledge is that high though in almost any human contexts. 

Answers to what question(s)? Do you think it is impossible to answer such a question? Will you agree that just because we don't immediately have an answer doesn't mean we aren't responsible for trying to find one? Will you agree that some are likely closer to answering such questions than others?

As a [[fff]] philosopher (and a fool), I'm all about trying to answer valuable questions (including: "what counts as valuable?") as best as I can. Is there no [[hope]] to solving our problems? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? I am curious to know if you will provide the quietist's response here.

<<<
But I will say that talking to you and your family is the best technology I’ve encountered in a decade.
<<<

Knowing the tip of your prowess, that is incredibly high praise. Thank you. It's been the most fulfilling use of technology of my life (though not even close to the most hedonically pleasing). I can't say I know how to get where I'm trying to go, but I'm trying. I don't predict my success. Taking the leap not only without certainty but without confidence sucks; it feels more like a romantic deathmarch.

<<<
 Sure, I’m reliant on a sturdy free-enough technology that gets our words passed around. 
<<<

Do you think we have to build at least some kinds of mousetraps for that sturdiness and sufficient freedom? Getting our words passed around on our preferred conditions is non-trivial.

<<<
And those words are our plain humanity on the wire.
<<<

Oh, this sentence is a keeper. You sound like a wizard or sorcerer to me. Most people don't believe your claim, but I know it is true. It's also why I doubt you are really so cynical all the way down. I am sure I am missing something important though. In any case, wizard, I'm going to continue challenging your flypapering attempts to de-prioritize systematic mousetrap P2Pdom in our weighings. Our [[Humanity]] is on the wire, [[kicks]], and this is why I expect us to be treated as equals in our bottom-up construction toward the ideal. Indeed, I seek the implausible but not the impossible.

<<<
>    I am worried about some perhaps difficult to justify originality+authenticity moves, but the underground is not more real to me conceptually (though it can be more valid or valuable in the dialectic). I only care about “making it your own” insofar as it is justified to the particulars of your context. The Beautiful is not the overriding reason, but insofar as all other obligations are met, it is the last deciding force. The necessity of preserving freespeech and decentralizing power (including memetic distribution) comes long before The Beautiful though.

You’re not being cryptic—I just think sometimes your compression level is turned up on thoughts like these.
<<<

I appreciate that claim. Yeah, lol, it's compressed and incomplete (but, that's my work in general). I think they are usually fragments. I take [[The Right]] to be the master of [[The Beautiful]] slave in the grand dialectic for persons. The questions "who ought we be?" or "what ought I do?" just are questions of [[The Right]], and that includes how we take into account [[The Beautiful]]. 

I hope I am not annoying you with my compression. I must compress carbon to construct [[diamonds]]. I have a modeling deficiency, and this is often how I start solving it in academic philosophy. I will probably fail. 

<<<
 I also have to add that I DO appreciate pop culture—I actually think it’s one of the most promising religions or symbolic systems we’ve ever developed. (And it’s REALLY tempting to demonize it, because it’s backup by capitalism—though I think that most people can appreciate the value of the engine—most people seem to agree that artists should be paid.)
<<<

I'd like to know what it is that you think is worth demonizing. You want a minimal level of compassion, but I think it will logically imply lacking compassion in at least one context. It can be easy to say "let's be compassionate," but one hard part of the test of compassion is knowing what isn't worth our compassion.

What makes a religion or symbolic system promising? What is it promising for? That is quite teleological, but I don't know what end you have in mind here. I know I'm such a huge fucking pain in the ass. As I regularly told: I am the worst. I'm the dialectical opponent of [[Meaningness]]. The externalist, eternalist, essentialist "for the sake of which" is my ~~clown~~ bidness.

I've been interested in your definition of religion (not easy to define). You speak of [[being moral without religion|https://www.kickscondor.com/comments/very-real-names]], but then call mainstream media a religion. That is a fascinating move. One appears to be ridiculously broad, so broad it should include mores, norms, emotes, desires, memeplexes, behaviors, etc. and the other sounds quite narrow, enough to deny a conceptual relationship between religion and morality. I'm not claiming this is logically inconsistent, but it's worth exploring.

I'm going to sound archaic, [[pright]] conservative, dogmatic, and cliche here. My problem with pop culture is that it often distracts us from what objectively matters to our contexts. It has to be consumed in moderation, and it cannot come at the wholesale expense of other philosophical ventures and practices. In argumentation, I'm looking for more than a lowest common denominator or highest grossing appeal to the masses. Yes, I think pop culture is the result of the commodification of our minds to serve the centralization of power, and  capitalism is a driving force of what I find evil. 

Of course, I appreciate markets. There are contexts in which perfect competition seem necessary and reasonable too. To be clear, I think artists can be paid outside of capitalism too (in case you are making a point about intellectual property here, which I am deadset against). I think if most people saw what I see, they would not appreciate the engine so much. 

<<<
Anyway, I don’t think mainstream culture is necessarily any less original or authentic than the underground. I just think that mainstream culture has become imbalanced—it has really captivated everyone this time, and fewer people seem to know how to escape it—which is the purpose of an ‘underground’, to me, and, of course, this is all just my perception.
<<<

Preach, yo!

I'm probably saying nothing new, but I want to finish each other's sandwiches here. I have a hard time drawing lines between mainstream and underground/counterculture, especially since they define each other. It appears to be a spectrum which comes in [[dok]]. Insofar as mainstream culture is shaped by those seeking to unjustifiably enslave others (taxation is a form of slavery<<ref "sl">> which is often justified), and that's generally what it has been, I'm opposed to it (we are shocked). I'm not against the concept of the mainstream, but only virtue of a fitting process and telos. 

When my granddonor traveled from Boston to the American South in the 50's, he could hardly understand anyone and vv. Their language games were not sufficiently commensurable. This problem is an ancient one; you could (and in some parts of the world you still can) travel 15 miles to the next town and find people speaking an incompatible language. Our languages and memeplexes have become standardized through mass media, and now there isn't so much difference in our cultural practices. The unificatory aspects of Chinese writing, the printing press, the radio, television, the interwebs cause massive upheaval and sublationary unification in our dialectics and the evolution of our discourses; they push toward a master, a mainstream. I don't have a conceptual problem with that because there are possible worlds (however unlikely) in which the mainstream is functional bonhomie, [[The Golden Rule]], compassion, and treating others as ends in themselves. That is an imbalance I seek, but of course, that is not where our imbalance is headed.

At least while the US military is one of the largest corporations on the planet, as long as the US dollar maintains its dominance, as long as Western legal structures can be coercively injected into the rest of the world (and enable streamlined processes for corporations to dominate the proletariat everywhere), I suspect mainstream cultural artifacts and memeplexes condoned by some portion of the transnational elite (especially the Rand-Locke memeplex) will continue to explosively infect and perhaps saturate the world. Escaping the mainstream is going to require a helluva a mousetrap, homie. I am not convinced even I have escaped the mainstream whatsoever; at best, I only have one foot outside that cave. I am convinced constructing a usable, stable, and difficult-to-defeat underground is our goal. I think we are at war with elite private interests and hyperindividualism which celebrates egoistic power structures.

Currently, owning your devices, data, and joining the underground is a very steep climb. Many of my students over the years either have no device or only have a mobile device (complete papers researched, plagiarized, and written on a phone), and it's not easy to be underground on these platforms (I consider myself an abject failure in this regard; though I'm not the only reason I still don't satisfactorily own my phone). My assumption is that you teach fairly privileged children because none of the primary and secondary schools in my area have a teacher with your competence (not even in the same league, homie). Hand your students a cheap VPS. Even with instructions, how many of them can be on the indieweb within a day? Can they e-mail, chat, and post on non-mainstream platforms? Half my middleschoolers can't create a mainstream e-mail account.<<ref "id">> I agree that education is in no small part up to the individual, but escaping the mainstream is borderline a miracle for most people. One of my goals is a mousetrap which enables turnkey undergrounds for the underprivileged; of course, tax dollars should be spent building that thing (that is exactly what justified governments do: they give voice to the people).

<<<
I think—I think what happened was that, in the previous decade, the Internet gave the underground a tremendous breath of air. You basically had a network that was //all// underground—and I don’t just mean some kind of hip, stylized underground—I mean that, before the corporations figured out how to milk it, you would search for ‘donuts’ and be at someone’s uncle’s website.
<<<

I have little experience in the underground,<<ref "le">> and I can't speak to what life was really like before the internet too significantly. I came late to the beginning of the internet; 1994 is the earliest I touched it, and I was a child. I can remember it was radically easier to find someone's uncle's website. SEO barely existed, and it was easy to be found and to find people building personal things in their own way.

Preventing the exploitation of search is a hard problem, and decentralizing it is a profound problem (you know the CS far better than I). YaCy is a beautiful failure, a landmark and compass. I know P2P and federation has to be part of the answer. That is not where the money is in capitalism, except insofar as manufactured ML models run on our phones can do the work for our Big Brothers; we will be computing for them on our mobile devices and via WASM. They own and shape it though.

Word of mouth isn't good enough. Tools may be incomplete, but we cannot sufficiently compete without them.

There was no hunting around for rare vinyl or out-of-print Borges novels any more—the whole ‘underground’ world had doorways now. The underground became the mainstream culture and, yeah, we lost an actual underground.
<<<

Ah, yes, the part of the underground I value so highly! That does have to be part of it, but that novelty market is not why I value the underground so much. 

I don't have much of a problem with the underground having doorways. This is often my problem with piracy communities. The poor deserve access, and I shouldn't have to give you proof that I'm [[leet|Leet]] or be lucky enough to know someone who can introduce or vouch for me. Enabling first-class P2P relationships requires eliminating how we commodify our relationships and defeating powerful adversaries. I only value the underground in terms of making sure the nearly powerless can be appropriately empowered. Otherwise, I seek radical openness. Of course, it's not an easy problem. 

<<<
 And I think there was a kind of crisis of overwhelm that mainstream culture had become so wide—like, “we need robots to sift through all of this.”
<<<

Wait, why is that such a bad thing? You are moving too fast for me, sir. You are obviously reliant upon many such robots (you even build them). I too need robots to sift through all this! That reincarnation of the postmodern crisis is neverending; I can only hope to attenuate and mitigatively shape it. I am so grateful for having computers help me pick out what is [[salient]], especially when it searches on my own terms. There is too much information for me not to use mindless robots, otherwise I'm stuck with paper and narrowed scopes/proximities of people.

My issue is about a justified [[dok]] of autonomy in these algorithms. The world around me, my body, my brain, and at least most of the mind which emerges from them are [[algorithms|https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1410/1410.0369.pdf]], right? Prima facie, my construction of my digital identity, filter-bubbles, and the ability to sift for [[gems]] and interpretations should generally be up to me.<<ref "um">> 

My problem is with the (wait for it...!) centralization of computing power, the ownership, the motives and incentives for construction of these algorithms. Who do these algorithms serve? It's not the people in general, and especially not the poor. I have to fight to find robots which aren't meant to have me serve those in power. It's a constant treadmill. Why do you think I'm teaching my children what little I know about computers? It's war.

Filtering is not censorship, but it can approximate it. What data do I think it really worth hosting on my own dime, especially if it were automated for me? Am I forced to AMP my data for it to be findable in the only walled-garden silos which people look? What does it take to make it so I can find your uncle's donut page, especially if I don't know you? Building democratic filter algorithms which enable us to construct our filters with each other is a political necessity. This is what decentralizing power in the face of giants has to look like.

Perhaps the best way to put it is, again, I feel like I say this all the time: as a human algorithm. This person (or group) acts as the community’s recommendation and relations engine. It’s not inferred by upvotes but is much more active than that. (In the same way that I have absolutely no algorithm doing my work of curating href.cool.)
<<< 

Your post was excellent. As usual, I must be missing something important. It's a mixture of my misanthropy, hubris, and stupidity, I am sure.

I agree that we are seeking justified human algorithms (not just any) in almost everything. Upvote mechanisms are human algos. What's not human enough about them to you? Is it that they fail to accurately and fairly depict a balanced kaleidoscope of our individual conceptions of [[The Good]]? Am I unable to hear your voice and are you unable to express it for unacceptable reasons?

I agree you directly and indirectly benefit from upvoting and do more than that. We both pop up thousands of pages each month; we skate around, narrow them down, rabbithole when we're feeling lucky, and hunt for [[S2NR]]. We are choosing how to log, label, upvote, and talk about them on our terms. I would argue it is active, and it is heavily reliant upon the passive inferences of others. My primary problem with it is that it's not decentralized upvoting and filtering (this is why Reddit and HN, used correctly, are still some of my primary tools).

Personal sites are a necessary step, but it won't suffice. Word of mouth through personal sites is way too slow (and it's only sped up because at least some of the users are using the shared medium tools). I need fast feeds and slow ones too; that's how I think. We absolutely require the speed of a Reddit and a Google, and that requires packaging up ourselves and content into something so standardized that it becomes partially impersonalized. Sharing the medium of the message requires concessions (though not necessarily into [[corpypastas|https://www.kickscondor.com/corpypastas]]). To the best of our abilities, that concession should not be to a corporation commodifying the medium and hence the message. Of course, as you've pointed out, it's ridiculously hard to incentivize and construct the technical aspects of a decentralized version of these giants. It's one of the reasons I like https://indieweb.xyz; it's a boutique for the commons and yet obviously the right direction. Unfortunately, I can't get most people with less than 100 IQ to actively participate in it (which is radically not your fault or theirs at all). Democracy requires turnkey tools for the dumb and the lazy (you know, like me!). If I can't have it running in 10 minutes flat, it's already dead to the masses. Q the flypaper argument.

You like my [[Link Log]]s, but they are obviously generated by my reliance upon upvotes. `/music Mortal Kombat`: I'm racing in the desert,<<ref "ik">> manically skimming off aggregation and discussions; I'm drowning. I'm in the fight of my life to find the answer. Where in the everliving fuck is Morpheus? He was supposed to be here by now! It's simply infeasible for me to wholesale rely upon bouncing from personal site to personal site to get where I'm going. You must be a special person (and most people just aren't you, [[kicks]]) for me to ctrl+rclick+drag to open your entire blogroll and explore your digital identity (including in terms of your linkage). I think it's fair to say I try to digest some individuals, but I also must digest the masses.

The human algorithm is one we may need to think about together. I am unconvinced you have no algorithm for your work. Maybe it is less reliant upon some [[dok]] of algorithms, but you make a much stronger claim than that.

<<<
 There was a time when Twitter first came out that people were joking that it was just a bunch of people posting updates that they’re shitting right now. And now we just post those updates, no shame.
<<<

Aye. I remember. I do the same even on my wiki, lol. I have never been a fan of most social networks, but I'm fairly antisocial (not exactly by choice). Forums, personal sites, and direct messaging are usually the tools I prefer. The centralization of social networks has been one of the problems from the beginning, and yes, I'm going to continue to blame capitalism to some significant degree. A mix of the network effect, the paradox of choice, and general digital literacy laziness or inability eliminates most competition. Of course, most people really do want to live their lives in just a few apps and on a few sites. Functional P2P software for the masses (and probably infrastructures designed to accommodate them) has to be built through governments.

The part that actually got me here is the ‘shallow aesthete’ because it’s dead on—I //think// that I am on the prowl for this guy, but he’s out all the time, spray painting little soap bubbles on people’s suitcases.

Forgive my lack of understanding. You may be on the prowl for this guy, but I also can't tell you this guy (as you've defined him for me) is categorically a shallow aesthete. I do not claim you do either, but I'm obligated to point out that I must not conflate them. Clearly, you know more of your vision than I do; you'd have to flesh him out for me. I deny that all possible versions of this man are shallow aesthetes. No. Some of these men are the poor, the mourning, the meek, the hungry thirsting for righteousness, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peacemakers, and the unjustifiably persecuted. Hospitably beware the angels among them. [[IA2DYJ]], and some of these men are the reason I aim to subvert the world. I do not know the exact man for which you prowl, but I will not condemn that everyman without evidence. Perhaps you aren't a shallow aesthete or prowling for one.

I don’t think the point of a personal website is so much to design something pretty and ‘authentic’ (wtf?) or even ‘cool’.

I adore that your gut instinct is to `/wtf` "authenticity" (though I cannot seal the door). Indeed, being "cool" isn't even remotely sufficient (look at us; we're dorks, lol...though, obviously, you are radically more worthy and likable than I am). That is an important marker. I will continue to argue [[The End]] is not defined by [[The Beautiful]] alone.

 I think of it just as having a ‘home’—which seems eminently human to me—as opposed to ‘mechanical’ or ‘hive-minded’, such as being another tweet, lost in the feed.

You are going for it now. I adore it. That feels like you are fighting nihilism in that claim.

Why should I think the mechanical or the hive-minded isn't eminently human to some significant [[dok]]? We are largely machines (including our emotions), and we form some kind of hive-mind which does at least partially define us. What about you is not mechanical, [[kicks]]? I suggest it is only your freewill. That is the only explanation left, and it is the only applied Principle of Sufficient Reason for peeling you out of the dialectical feed as an [[end]] rather than lost-worthy mere means.

While I hope for technologies like Dat (and have always loved peer-to-peer since the days of Freenet and Gnutella), the technology is so far from being adequate as to seem impossible at times. So, I’m quite happy getting anyone I can back into personal websites and wikis. 
<<<

You're right. I wish it weren't so.

I am a fan of what Freenet and Gnutella stand for. I agree it seems nearly impossible because it's so implausible. Of course, your existence is not impossible, but it’s also not very likely. The odds of correctly responding to capitalism are wildly against us. Building algorithms which are meant to decentralize power isn't usually profitable. Those world-class engineers in SV do not construct computers for [[Humanity]]. I'm so grateful to the morally motivated members of the FOSS and decentrality communities who have done their best; they are my heroes. This is the kind of large scale problem which individuals are unlikely to solve (though it appears possible to me), and instead, these are the kind of investments entire societies have to make.

I'm happy to try to get people back into personal sites too. I am, of course, the judgmental asshole and outcast. I beg everyone I know to own themselves fittingly (which includes giving up part of what they thought they had a claim right to). I've been failing awesomely since the late 90's.<<ref "fm">> This is yet another Tragedy of the Commons. Solving it is just not fun enough; the cost/benefit ratio and barrier to entry are high. The question "why be moral?" is non-sense, but people conveniently aim to ask it any, including with respect to how they compute. People are stupid and evil, [[kicks]], but I maintain there is a sliver of a possibility we can be people who merit our respect (which is what I currently respect about most humans: who they could be just is part of who they are). 

The amount of change which must occur for those technologies to flourish is gargantuan. My prediction, as usual, is utter failure. I don't like playing games in which I'm unfairly almost guaranteed to lose. This the life I find myself in, and I hope to have the courage and integrity to keep fighting for what matters most. I would be grateful for proof that it's impossible and definitionally not worth my time: it would be quite a load off my chest.

Lately I’ve been thinking that ensuring a myriad of ISPs is a lot more important than peer-to-peer.
<<<

That's a peering problem too. I agree that maximizing ISP cooperation is a fundamental problem, and it doesn't simply boil down to having higher competition in markets. That is part of P2P/federation! 

Look at the trajectory of the internet in the world. It is being sealed off, country by country. They are becoming censored intranets. There are people who will live their lives mediated entirely through FAANG-like oligopolies. Attempts to build completely different physical internets and nestable VPNs (subject to the whims of many middle routers) have failed, but they are the only outs. Capitalism will always centralize power, including ISPs, especially as it controls our governments. We have to own the means of production, including the infrastructure of the internet. 

I'm going to continue to argue for [[Atropos]]/[[Outopos]]. Even if it becomes mainstream, Dat isn't the answer (though it's part of it!).  We openly mesh, onion route, and automate [[T42T]] trust or lose to the centralization of power.

I hate getting my hopes up like this, because now I have some sense of a hidden or elusive truth buried in the center of this blog—and I’ve felt that almost constantly when approaching socialist blogs. But I need to remember that it’s just a blog: it’s not possible for it to have the answers and what’s usually lacking is enough imagination on my part. So this is sweet.
<<<

I know that pain. Most of our species have been poured into the dialectical opposition, and it's going to take some huge leaps to find comparable responses. Where are the cheatcodes for this game again? 

I do not know what you mean when you say a blog cannot have the answer. Answer to what? Is there no answer, and can such a thing be demonstrated in a blog? I don't know what expressible thing can't be blogged. It reminds me of suspicions about the nature of language as a trap, where we play word games to escape, as though philosophy is at best mere therapy as it were.

I am lucky that you exercise caution and conservative openness on my behalf. Thank you for thinking with me. You are like a one-eyed bird leading a blind fool. My brother [[JRE]] pulls me back to pragmaticism like this as well. I feel like [[Lady Melisandre|Prompted Introspection]] is granting me a wish to ask for more wishes.

Your response is particularly funny to me because many, many times I’ve tried to convince your father that having an audience changes writing in a variety of unpredictable ways—and I’m not sure he ever believed me.
<<<

Lol, yeah, that made me laugh too, XD. I've been working to explain this lack of privacy to both my children to the best of my fallible abilities for a while. I'm not convinced this event has changed how he thinks or behaves that much. To his knowledge, he has had others look at his wiki, but never a stranger.

I would be indebted to you for a list. 

Since [[my first letter|2018.07.14 - kickscondor: Hello, Nomad!]], I've tried to convince you there is a [[ROG]] question at the heart of whether or not (and the [[dok]] to which) it //should// change writing (though I do not claim to have resolved it). That lacking privacy against some audience changes what is communicated doesn't mean it should. It depends! I think we disagree on the lines of dependence. To the extreme example again, that's what [[The Moral Law]] is: an idealized audience we never escape.<<ref "m">> 

My assumption is that we actually see non-trivial swathes of each other's claims here. In dialectical opposition, we're hammering out and attempting to fallibly codify that variety and unpredictability (or difficulty in predicting) to get to the root. Do we have much disagreement on the descriptions of privacy from technical and causal perspectives? Maybe. That's not so clear to me. Metaethics appears to be a profound source of disagreement. Once we hammer out semblances of what we owe to each other and why, only then we can prescribe the means to those ends.

You aim for opaque, well-mannered, pseudonymous bonhomie. At face value, I obviously value those rule-of-thumb aims too. Unfortunately, I still don't know the [[gfwiwcgws]] for each of these terms (though I'm trying to fill them out). For what purpose? Opaque to whom on which conditions? Well-mannered given what standard?<<ref "r">> Pseudonymous to what extent in which contexts? Doesn't bonhomie necessarily require violence in some cases? I realize it is difficult to codify your virtuous instincts here, and it's not like I have given great answers either (and I should be held to much, much higher standard here). I think bonhomie requires less opacity.

It's not that I don't believe privacy (or lack thereof) tends to influence what is written in difficult to understand ways. Far from it! Surely you agree to that in me, right? I've explicitly argued that to you from our first letter. You can look at the first snapshot of this wiki and see I'm facing that question. I point to its aspects all the time in the [[Link Log]]. I think my particular practice is jarring, especially since I sometimes push morally-justified freespeech to its limits; my work is realpolitik though (it's not just a work about politics, it's designed to be a controversial political work itself). It's gotta be an odd experience to engage someone who is taking notes, scribing the conversation, and writing so many personal thoughts on a projector screen in front of you and everyone else as you speak (we're both doing it to various [[dok]]). 

When I shape and filter myself, I want it to be in virtue of the fact that I'm [[fff]]ingly accountable to the emergent moral authority functionally derived in no small part from every conceivable person in every possible world; that's the integrity required to privatize ourselves and provide morally defensible positions for faith and qualia. That's what justified tolerance and celebrations of differences between us in dialectics conceptually must look like.

Of course, I know my autism is an immediate reason to doubt that I have any clue (a fair ad hominem!). I should be exceptionally bad at reasoning about this sphere, and perhaps I am. Perhaps my predictive coding is all sorts of wrong here. I think your best line of reasoning so far has been the Robustness Principle applied to privacy which offers a hedged-conservative buffer to handle the difficult to predict exceptions. Perhaps we're debating what counts as the most anti-fragile morally-justified political strategy for respecting [[Others]]. Especially for privacy, I'm concerned with who our identities are insofar as they are conceptually related to who our identities ought to be, and everything else is gravy (I'm not trying to demean gravy in the least; our moral effort should culminate in feasts). 

My goal isn't to merely filter what I say to people: it's to filter who I am. I'm under the gun here. I deny that I have a prima facie right to be just whoever I want to be and opaquely appear as something else to others,<<ref "mr">> but I do not deny the moral permissibility of opacity in all contexts. Deception is such a hard problem that Kant outright denied it was ever morally permissible; I'm working hard (fighting [and probably losing to] possibly the most elite wrestler who ever lived) to secure the moral permissibility (let alone the obligations) of deception, translucence, and opacity. Deception uses people as means, and unfortunately usually as mere means in my experience (that's my prediction), and thus we must toe the line and bend over backward to transparently demonstrate as best we can that our private right to deceive the [[other]] was warranted behind the [[VOI]]. We must virtually speak on behalf of the deceived as wisely as we can.

I will argue that it isn't that I don't believe, it's that these privacy concerns are outweighed by far more pressing matters in the world (from the looks of it, I probably think the world is in worse shape than you do). Given the crisis we face: I think I'm morally required to take much greater political risks in my context, and I think, to varying [[dok]], most people are too.

I'm glad to see you connecting with my son especially. It's not easy to do in some respects. Many people have dismissed him as a mute or an idiot, someone who will never have a valuable voice in their eyes. He has come much further than you know.

We roared laughing through your video. My son laughed and cringed seeing you read his post aloud; it reminded him of [[this|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EShUeudtaFg]]. There is much we do not understand in the video, and we weren't sure what words you were saying @6:14. It reminds me of [[this|https://youtu.be/p3p2GrSO6JI?t=208]]. 

It is wonderful to hear your voice. Your offline and online tones match beautifully. You remind me of several English teachers I've had with a wandering disorganization on the surface.

Obviously, your tool is only half an RSS tool, so why are you calling it an RSS tool? Speaking of etymology, I would argue the origins of words can be seeds to better ideas, but that must also be your point here. We're not sure what to call it either. It is a feed, a crawler, an aggregating prioritizer of your attention. You are building something like a far more customized self-hosted Reddit frontpage (you do seem to be gunning for a replacement to Reddit from multiple angles). It saves you from having to open bookmark folders by hand. 

You don't post a ton, so you make it easy on me to follow. I am much more talented at wasting our time though. So, while it doesn't matter in the least (I mean, what does?), I realize my flooding wiki doesn't really fit nicely in your tool. Assuming you are insane enough to be thinking about the problem, I also don't know how far you want to specialize that crawlegator. There are many treadmills you'd need to tailor it to. Unfortunately, I spend little time trying to make my wiki RSSable because I have no idea how to make what is [[salient]] about my wiki algorithmically pop up for you in an easy manner (for so many stupid reasons). I have a fuckton of noise for you to sift through. What are you sifting for? I just don't know what you perceive as [[S2NR]] for you.

I would be tempted to diff https://philosopher.life/#:[search[kickscondor]] or build more complex filter expressions. Keyword searches may catch everything you want to see; I don't know how to tell. Perhaps there is something you need me to do on my end to make it easier for you. If at all, what doorways, hinges, and knobs do you need, homie? I strongly prefer delivering a single object, but I will make an exception for you if you feel it useful.<<ref "cust">>

This following absurd idea also isn't that, but I think it's slightly related. 

Because I am so blind, I rely upon the fallacious wisdom of the crowds. I am a huge fan of [[Reddit on Youtube|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reddit-on-youtube/]]. Of course, I am wary of the gamification, memetic warfare, etc. Echo chambers, however, can be quite useful in crystallizing; they tumble rocks for [[gems]] too often. Further, I'm pissed off that I don't have the power to construct my own filter-bubbles based upon how other people construct their filter-bubbles in a decentralized fashion. In my wildest dreams, I wish for an aggregator in which I choose the moderators who filter, updoot in ranged voting, and categorize any given of any given sub, tag, or content. I wish I could see through the eyes of my favorite crazy people, and I'd like to see the work which is censored by particular groups as well.

I wish I had a running auto-searched commentary for content. Did my mentors, friends, enemies, or high [[S2NR]] crowds have something to say about the URL I'm currently viewing? It would be outstanding to have a tabbed sidebar commentary. Yeah, I'm definitely interested in what the average Redditor and HN user has to say, but I'm especially interested in prioritizing what you have to say about the topic or link.

> You don’t post a ton, so you make it easy on me to follow. I am much more talented at wasting our time though. So, while it doesn’t matter in the least (I mean, what does?), I realize my flooding wiki doesn’t really fit nicely in your tool.

In your case, the tool is helpful because I can see a graph of activity—and, actually, now I realize: I think I would be interested in illustrating updates vs new material. I do value new material slightly more. And I think I would especially like to see minor edits (50 chars or less) not shown.
<<<

That makes good sense in my case. There's plenty of work that is just updated. I use [[New]] all the time, but [[Recent]] uncommonly (though we may start reading wikis in [[Family Time]] by [[Recent]]). We've tried a couple times to get versioning set in the wiki. We've been derailed on other assignments though. I'm sorry that it is coming along so slowly. 

The goal is to make it so anything which doesn't reside in [[New]] is old enough that it will be versioned, and anything which leaves [[Recent]] is old enough that versions will be sliced out. From what I can tell, given the tools available, we'll have to keep full copies rather than deltas, and the diff is computed in the browser. The wordcount might be something we should do as well (that's how I track your `/all` too); a vertical strip of tabs in [[Recent]] might give options for that.

My assumption is that not many other people in your snazzy bookmarker are updating and re-using older content that often.

<<<
Yes, for you, the graph will be noisy. It will just show constant activity. But you do tend to update in clumps. So knowing the moment has arrived—and there is a new clump out there—that helps. It’s even more helpful for the rest of your family’s wikis. Because they are usually less frequent than you. Saving myself the cognitive load of simply having to determine whether the wiki has changed or not (manually) leaves me more time to read.
<<<

I'm seeing that clumpiness too, and I feel like I've slowed down considerably on significantly altering the wiki. It's now more of a heartbeat to me. I've not used as much cannabis this year (which makes talking to myself far more interesting), and life seems to be shifting. I assume my posting will continue to decline if and when I pick up a full-time position. Perhaps it will come and go, have ups and downs. I'm pretty sad to see [[The Remodeling]] and [[Wiki Audit]] have died off for now.

<<<
I think I could also, like you say, use the ability to monitor keywords. I do find messages using my name in search. And I also rank [[Link Log]]s higher—your roundups are some of my favorites. But I also don’t want to become too dependant on such things, because I like reading about your afterschool teaching and your meta-discussions about shaping your wiki. No matter the algorithm, there is a danger that the tool starts doing too much of the reading for you. That’s why I feel passionate about designing it to be painfully inadequate.
<<<

Lol! =) It's definitely a manual hammer. Perhaps inside every tool there's a hammer. 

Not that it matters: I am colorblind, but I liked your use of color. It reminds me of video games, chess, and reading gamestates at a glance.

This is a continuation of our conversation. I can appreciate not wanting to be too dependent on it, though that isn't where my instincts go. I'm sure you see more clearly here than I do. I feel like I already have to do too much by hand (though you probably have a far more advanced process). Striking the right balance between automated convenience and personally verified exploration ain't easy.

I think I am content leave it as a ‘bookmark folder’ with some perks. I want it to be like a hammer—an elegant, limited tool with one job to do. I don’t think I need it to become a massive engine. I don’t want to suddenly be spending all of my time with it.

There's something right about it. Maybe it will inspire to someone to make a browser addon out of it. I'm going to keep thinking about your lense. I want to know what a generalized version of that tool, a massive engine, should look like.

I think you are doing a remarkable job at organizing your wiki! You are so consistent with your naming<<footnote "1" "“There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” – Phil Karlton">>—so that only left me to parse your whole wiki. This is the best RSS feed I could ask for. I wish every blog could be slurped up so easily. I can form a complete history and plunder it all immediately. I can read the timestamps on everything perfeckly.
<<<

I try to keep it organized (though I can't say I'm living up to my own expectations on that front). Parsability matters to me for a future I cannot see, for others who might want to do something with the wiki, and because I'm just not sure how long I will be able to continue using this tool.<<ref "jn">> Perhaps one day I'll see the fitting parts to syndicate in a manner which makes sense to me, but I have my doubts. So far, I'm hoping the ability to craft complex bookmarks will do some of that work.

This is a very juicy take. I tend to think that if you find an enemy’s (or a friend’s) blog, then the information is all there. But I think your point is really hot: viewing your ‘feed’ might be a lot more interesting to me than it even is to you! Walking a mile in your shoes. I like this idea. I may crib this at some point.
<<<

Wait, why is the information all there? It shows some of it. There's a ton I observe which I didn't think pertinent to put in my wiki (and signaling in my wiki is still fairly expensive), which may be similar to censorship or filter-bubble shaping, but how do you know what I chose not to put on my wiki? I very rarely offer upvotes, downvotes, and only on a handful of occasions have I deleted something of someone else's making on a public forum, but this is especially because I don't own that data. However, I think those are useful signals which aren't easily parsed out of a personal site (not even mine, and I actually have built my [[Link Log]] with signaling for ML in mind). Of course, I'm still going to write about some of them, but I can signal far more in an interface like Reddit. I need to be able to sort like an empowered chicken-sexer. I want to scroll'n'signal with hotkeys and grow different feeds from my own machines which have increasing [[S2NR]]s. I want to use other people's models to breed and compete with mine. I think our pseudonymized ranged quadratic vote data should be something we share with others to construct enormous friend-to-friend networks. I'm going to continue to argue that half of this story must be radically automated.

Indeed, I absolutely must see how groups think at a glance, and especially through a lens not controlled by centralized powers who own the gateways, the platforms, and essentially the users to varying [[dok]]. Yes, we must have our personal site slow-reading peer review process (it's part of effective communal epistemology practices), but we also need meme velocity. We require both. We need the single-thread CPU compute, the slow grind, the exercise of our system 2 autonomy. We also need that highly parallelized, automated, system 1 approach memetic explosiveness (and our current systems are not designed for the people or by the people). The global dialectic needs both, and each of us must own the memes of productions.

I'm convinced there is a great deal of room to [[brainstorm|2018.03.30 - Outopos: Decentralized Reddit]] about how to decentralize a tool like Reddit. There's been a bunch of attempts so far, and I'm not convinced any sound one can be monetized or federated (beyond proxying). I'm not trusting a tool in which an admin (including on a federated platform) can bury or even remove me from the conversation completely.<<ref "yc">>

There might be 10,000,000 people in a particular network, and I want to see how various networks within it view the whole. I have to see who censored and voted for what to shape these feeds. I already have to use add-ons to mark which users are from particular forums for contexts, to block trolls out entirely, etc. I shouldn't have to convince the other mods that one of the mods is going rogue. I should be able to control that from my end for my feed. I want to pick out smart people and have their lenses help me form mine in various contexts.

You have to correct me if I'm wrong, but sometimes we come off as luddites (despite our love of computers). Speaking slowly and at length is something I value. I obviously care about having a place divided off from the flypaper lightning mediums which is entirely my own. I still can't convince almost anyone to write letters with me; it's a dying art. The manual hammer, the nails, the lumber, and the great assortment of tools one uses to build a house, The Republic, The City of God, or what have you, should be machined, CNCed, and mass-produced as much as we safely can; furthermore, those manual tools only maintain their power in virtue of the automation that does all the work to allow us to pick out and apply the [[salience]].

I appreciate the dystopian concern that we're losing our autonomy by handing our perceptions over to algorithms which aren't fairly driven by all humans rather than just a select few (though I deny //none//, as that is obviously false<<ref "qu">>). Perhaps these algorithms are a means of owning us, acting as vulgar surrogates for "authentic" interaction, and pacifying us into inert objects. Of course, keeping humans in the loop [[irwartfrr]] is expensive, especially in a decentralized manner.

<<<
So, I see two ideas here, actually:

* I share a public ‘feed’ list that you can peruse—barring some feeds I would mark as private, possibly—and you would see the whole thing just as I see it.
<<<

Preferably with metadata that includes signaling, and more importantly, it must be decentralized. Retroshare is the closest thing I've seen to an intuitive F2F model, but it's simply not performant enough, and it wasn't designed for voting. We must vote on what is [[salient]], sir. It is the only fair option. 

I am, of course, a foolish madman. To think e-voting is so obviously correct must mean I'm taking the crazy pills. Most experts think it's insane. They are, of course, wrong. I can blindly see it.

<<<
* An extension—like the ‘Reddit on Youtube’ one—where you can see related comments from anything in your feed. (It’s very possible that you’ve commented on something somewhere deep in your wiki and I’ll never find it unless I manually search—and I’m not going to do that for every link I come across.)
<<<

Yup. Insofar as they are public, or at least F2F public, I should be able to make use of your feeds, your friend's feeds, what you and your friends have in common, models you've generated, etc. I have so much content in front of me, and not enough choice in the interpretive lenses for me to discover it, inspect it, uncover its secrets, or to even give me a glimpse of what [[others]] think about it. 

I suspect this would be quite bandwidth intensive. I am also afraid that the tidal wave toward mobile is going to fisher-price my web experience further and further. the MARkET DicTaTES It, RighT? who hAs time tO ReAd ThEse daYS? FUCK ThAT shIt. i WAnt To SCrOLl tHROuGH CaTS, TiTs, And mEMeS aBout peOPLe i hATe. THE neWs MaKes me Sad, So I'm nOt goING TO LooK aT ANY of iT; i hAve nO RESponSIBIlItIEs tO ANYONe eLSe. Meh. Maybe that's all that would occur with my ideal platform. It's hard to escape the rolling eternal winters. I'll seek the 3% wherever they are trapped.

<<<
I will reply to you further on the rest of your letter. I have had a great time following the writing of it. I have enjoyed watching my interactions with your family play out.
<<<

I'm glad you've enjoyed following it. I'm sorry I've taken so fucking long on it. I have been busy elsewhere (your letter has been the most fun to write in recent memory), and I keep finding more to say in this letter.

<<<
I wonder how 1uxb0x is handling having a troll-admirer on his hands.
<<<

He's still reasoning about it. You aren't easy to reason about, [[kicks]]. No one else I know can make heads or tails of you, but they haven't spent the absurd number of hours thinking about you that I have. 

<<<
I know T-Money probably thinks I am teasing.
<<<

[[T-Money]] is also coming to grips with both of us. I think you make him uneasy, but I think he isn't too interested in trying to understand you. That sucks. I have encouraged him to reach out to you.<<ref "so">> 

I'm curious to know how many of your friends are Republicans or worse, [[kicks]]. Lol. 

<<<
For me, to read 1uxb0x is to experience life in a very potent way. To only see laughter or amusement in the writing of 1uxb0x is to limit the experience immensely.<<footnote "2" "I feel some regret at emphasizing the word “importaint”—as if an error in grammar were just another amusement to kick around. However—how could I pass it up? It is a pun of a higher order—so perfect for the son of Your Filthiness! The whole sentence is so readable. For such a short writing to instantly transport us to the Major’s Cabin, to Greece, to the death of the successful companies of this world. This is as good as it gets. To make our predictions, to cry our disbelief (“2 bucks?!?!”) and to finally say: “Shit.” For such is Sophie’s World.">> I worry that he will pack it all up and hide it all away, not knowing the harm of the lights I shine on it. I would understand this. //Why go back to the place! Why read my wiki assignments from dad?//

I don’t know exactly why he would feel embarassed at being so lauded. (I vaunt 1uxb0x, I VAUNT him.) But I think it is good, if so: to recoil against one’s own arrogance must happen I think.
<<<

It was a potent experience for him too. Over his lifespan, I've found he can be extremely sensitive to the world. I'm proud to say (since it was quite a climb to get him to a point where he understood the context), he regularly flees the room when even minor cringe shows up in a show. He nopes right out of there. He is aware, but it is going to take some time for him to develop fitting reactions (and I'm hardly equipped to show him or be an effective rolemodel). 

Admittedly, he's a young autist, and some aspects of your communication are oblique. We do our best to explain to him. I do not see much arrogance in my son (and arrogance is my forte; I'm like, the best at it), but I am often wrong.

I think the idea of your troll-admiration is growing on him though. Here I am speaking for him.

It's been really cool to see you interact with us all. I can't say I've ever had that experience before.

You recently posted [[On Dat|https://www.kickscondor.com/on-dat]] and [[Infostrats|https://www.kickscondor.com/infostrats]]. These are so ridiculously on topic for this letter (and for most of our letters). I need to sit and think about what you said. I look at this letter, and I still feel it's incomplete. Ugh. Okay, well, this is where it's at. I need to officially finish this letter and let you do the talking. 

`/hug`

[[Love]],
