Hey John,

I totally understand about not making money with philosophy. Adjuncting makes less than minimum wage, and I don't care about the status. I've been jumping into tradeskills (pipefitter and electrician) to make money in a way I find morally acceptable. To answer your question:

* Tulane University; PhD, Philosophy: 2012 - 2016,
* Louisiana State University; MA, Philosophy: 2010 - 2012
* Berea College; BA, Philosophy: 2003 - 2005

I've met several engineers who have little or no serious practice in the humanities (even for 15 minutes). It's interesting to me that your school required it. What school was that? Do you feel it was ultimately a good thing for you, how about for the other engineers in your program? Do you think it would be good for STEM students in general?

Thank you for skimming the article and giving me your gut reaction. You say it in an interesting way, and I'm going to think more about it. On a related note, one of my professors was a specialist in fundamental epistemic disagreement. I hope you will take it as a compliment when I say your work reminds me of his. I want to understand more about your perspective.

Btw, your post on Infinite Jest has been one of the reasons I've started to pick up the book. It's not like the books I'm used to reading; it's an odd experience. It's gonna take a couple weeks to get through this beast. I'm not qualified to assess artistic literature, but I can see the hysterical realist encyclopedic novel has a lot in common with my autobiographical mind upload found on my wiki.

I believe I owe it to you to tell you, I'm autistic (it is possible you already guessed or knew that); sometimes I am annoyingly talkative and inquisitive. I don't mean to be rude, so you should point it out to me when it happens so I can learn to be polite with you. I have to cognitively develop a theory of your mind since I lack the neurotypical affective ability to model you and your preferred social conventions. With that caveat, I have a personal big picture question for you:

As you understand it, if you can sum it up, what is the core metanarrative of your reality map? What really matters to you? What's most real to you? Do you think life has an objective meaning or purpose?

Sincerely,

h0p3
