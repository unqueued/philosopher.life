title: 2019.06.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Doctrinal System

!! Respond to the following [[gem]]:

One of the great achievements of the doctrinal system has been to divert anger from the corporate sector to the government that implements the programs that the corporate sector designs, such as the highly protectionist corporate/investor rights agreements that are uniformly mis-described as "free trade agreements" in the media and commentary. With all its flaws, the government is, to some extent, under popular influence and control, unlike the corporate sector. It is highly advantageous for the business world to foster hatred for pointy-headed government bureaucrats and to drive out of people's minds the subversive idea that the government might become an instrument of popular will, a government of, by and for the people.

I'm convinced most people I know are either patriots or people who do not have any [[hope]] for functional representation. I do not have a problem with the fittingly generated centralization of [[power]], but I'll need some amazing reasons to believe it has been decentrally legislated, adjudicated, and executed as best as possible.

It is clear that capitalism owns our government, but it is also clear that it is not conceptually necessary that it will or should. Hatred for the government as puppet but not capitalism as puppetmaster is incoherent, and for most people, I consider it an immoral epistemic position.

I believe in the possibility of democracy, and unfortunately, only the blockchain Libertarians are open to the technical possibility as well. I will continue to build toward the idea of it as best I can. [[TOP]], [[Atropos]], and [[AIoutopIA]] form the only out I know; it's a longshot, but any successful option is already unlikely. 

I'm afraid I've only convinced [[BDS97]] of the value, but it is not his cross to bear alone. It requires an army of people building it.
