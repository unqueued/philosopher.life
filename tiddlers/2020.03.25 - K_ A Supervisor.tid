title: 2020.03.25 - K: A Supervisor

"""
[12:40 PM] h0p3: Yo, how's it going?
[12:58 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Not great honestly. I was eavesdropping on a supervisor yesterday that stepped in for mail and he told a coworker of mine that if we close, I’ll be out of a job. I caught the supervisor about five minutes later and asked if there was any news and he told me no.
[12:58 PM] Ardent_Assailant: So I’m just sitting here wondering if I need to put out any effort at all if we might close tomorrow.
[1:02 PM] h0p3: Fuck, dude. :frowning:
[1:02 PM] h0p3: That's not cool.
[1:02 PM] h0p3: I wish you had a supervisor who would be upfront with you.
[1:02 PM] h0p3: Doesn't sound like they are on your side.
[1:03 PM] h0p3: Lots of stress, a whirlwind of change. I hate uncertainty so often.
[1:05 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yeah it’s shitty. I thought we were cool but I guess not. :joy:
[1:05 PM] Ardent_Assailant: My own supervisor would be straight with me but she’s working from home now.
[1:05 PM] Ardent_Assailant: My old supervisor would be straight with me too if she were part of the situation. She’s very respected in the library.
[1:07 PM] h0p3: I'm trying not to be angry with the people who have power over you. I don't think that's going to help you here. I'm grateful that some of your supervisors respect you as a person. I don't like that you might be falling through the cracks here. I think a lot of people are experiencing that this month.
[1:08 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It’s a tough situation. Uofl is going to pay their employees and their student employees if things all shut down— which is great, but since I’m a temp and graduated I’m technically neither haha.
[1:13 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I wouldn’t mind being laid off. I just don’t appreciate the shadiness of it. I’m afraid to ask my actual supervisor because I shouldn’t know that he said that. But I’m also pissed that he lied to me.
[1:17 PM] h0p3: I hear that.
[1:18 PM] h0p3: So work is a pile of stress. How is the rest of life going?
[1:19 PM] Ardent_Assailant: We’re finally getting some good groceries so that’s nice.
[1:20 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Lots of TP and some meat too
[1:20 PM] Ardent_Assailant: How are you all?
[1:20 PM] h0p3: Our stores still don't have TP, lol.
[1:20 PM] h0p3: I'm glad you are getting some good food though. That is solid.
[1:21 PM] h0p3: We're good. Grinding along. Magic has been fun. My [[TDL]] for today says: "Destroy in Magic, then Victory Fucking Ur Mom...or a walk"
[1:23 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Lmao
[1:23 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I ordered from Walmart .com
[1:23 PM] h0p3: Ah, makes good sense
[1:23 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It came on time and it was super safe
[1:24 PM] h0p3: That may be something we will engage in more often. Amazon has changed our lives, but we've not hopped on the W-entity ordering train yet.
[1:24 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I waited days for amazon to restock before I gave in haha
[1:25 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I won’t tell if you do order. :eyes:
[1:27 PM] h0p3: The primary use of my time has been switching to teaching academic philosophy more full-time. I've asked for my offspring to plan with me, and this is where I'm at: https://philosopher.life/#BAGD%3A%20%CE%A6%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%20%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%BB%CF%85%CF%83%CE%B7.tmpl
[1:27 PM] h0p3: Monday was my topic selection: https://philosopher.life/#Abstract%20Objects
[1:28 PM] h0p3: We're working on method. Just a dream, but I'd like to read the entire Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy with additional sources by the time they are adults.
[1:28 PM] h0p3: Could not have a more elite survey of academic philosophy than that.
[1:31 PM] Ardent_Assailant: This is a massive project haha. I’m excited to see the results.
