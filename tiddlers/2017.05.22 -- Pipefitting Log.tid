title: 2017.05.22 -- Pipefitting Log

Today wasn't too eventful, although I got plenty done. I have finally finished my second pipefitter book. Technically, I have completed all coursework. It took about 4 and half months, but I did it. I'm staying to really become adept at buttwelds, learn the rest of the tools, finish the optional two books, learn to weld, maximize my networking and recommendations, and grab my certifications. These are good reasons to stay and continue for now.

I was sick of studying for this last test. I decided to just ask for it and see what I got. Turns out, I did great. Chris did not. I was perplexed before, but I now I believe I understand the reason for this pattern. I think we are finally hitting a point in the books which extend beyond his knowledge (he has already studied this stuff for 2 years).

I talked to Mel at lunch. He continues to amaze me. He is purposely trying to bide his time sitting in the classroom. He wants to take 5 more days to finish 2 tests. His goal is to avoid the shop for the rest of the time he is here, which will just be those 5 days because he has found a way to weasel out of the full semester (this isn't like he is working ahead). He literally has never actually done buttwelds. The skill I've heard is most universal, he doesn't want to practice it at all. He wants to be a utility man for the government. I can definitely see him as the stereotypical government employee. Rubbish.

Chris and I went straight into our fabrication. We finished it. One leg was off in my measurements by close to half an inch. We didn't do the 1/8" takeouts, and the flange wasn't deep enough. That's the reason. Both can be solved with more planning. We should do so. We ended up doing a the 3-4-5 trick, but had to use a calculator for 2'-3'-43.26". We got everything set to mount, but our teacher said there would no be no overtime allowed. Essentially, he said we didn't have time to complete it today. So, we started cleaning and waited until he told us to go home.
