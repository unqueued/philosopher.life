title: 2019.11.05 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Peace & War

!! Respond to the following gem:

; Si vis pacem, para bellum
: If you want peace, prepare for war.

Pragmatically [[hoping]] for the best requires preparing for the worst in many respects. Peace as some [[SO]]ed event is going to require a lot of [[FO]] war. Plenty of Daoist reasoning to throw at this too. 

Incentivizing peace is expensive. There are ways to constructively anticipate and avoid war without pre-emptively striking. There's a butterzone for making yourself non-low-hanging fruit without actually investing in direct combat. Persistent and stable peace is a result of having made war so risky that people are punished for even remotely considering it. Note, of course, that not all kinds of peace are justified. The peace of Huxley can have catastrophic results too.
