title: FTO Mode: Reply

//I'm replying, but usually not initiating.//

This is a broken state. I'm pulling more than my fair share, and I've sufficient evidence to see I'm not respecting my own [time, energy, and autonomy] in continuing to tirelessly initiate. When you do at all, I don't trust the way in which you reciprocate.
