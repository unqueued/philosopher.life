title: 2013.04.04 - Skepticism: Reading Notes

Bonjour

The causal or nomological relationship between the believer and the world which makes the believe certain or highly probably need not be consciously known by the believer. It can be external to his subjective perspective.

Positive Thesis – Only externalism avoids skepticism

Externalism, particularly neo-Moorean externalism, has simpler and easier requirements for justification of knowledge, and it explains why we “know” ordinary propositions where other theories fail, as they are “too demanding and grandiose.”



Dretske’s: “If skepticism is false, externalism is true”

Externalism does not require we “justifiably believe that those skeptical possibilities are not actualized” (something we can’t justify in the first place) in order to have knowledge – all other theories do require this justification which can’t be had, and that is why they fall to skepticism where externalism does not.

But perhaps internalist views can also have neo-Moorean view: “the commensense view provides the best explanation of our evidence—we can justifiably believe that skeptical possibilities are not actualized.”

Unless Dretske can show why the non-externalists can’t be justified in this belief, then his claim that externalism is only theory which escapes skepticism doesn’t work.



Van Cleve:



Negative Thesis – Externalism implausibly avoids skepticism

How do we know the “apparently” reliable is actually reliable at all?

    Conditional answer: if we can satisfy the skeptic, then externalist beliefs are justified. But the antecedent doesn’t seem to be answered.

Does one need to believe that one is justified in believing ~BIV?

Justified in believing is different from knowledge. It seems a lot easier to show that one is merely justified in believing. Perhaps skepticism demonstrates that we don’t have knowledge, presumably a very high epistemic standard, but does it demonstrate that we aren’t even justified in believing anything about the (assumed) external world?





I realize I’m glossing over and perhaps even oversimplifying a carefully crafted argument with a lot of terminology. Take what I say with a large grain of salt.

Explanationism oddly seems like a grander, coherentist version of neo-Moorean dogmatism.

The basic structure of the arguments seems to be: I have two competing proposition A and B; I am more confident in A than B; thus, I am justified in believing A.

For dogmatism: I have a hand, I am more confident in the existence of my hand than skeptical principles, hence I have hand. That is the basic move that the dogmatist makes, right?

It seems to me that that explanationist is doing the same thing on a grander scale. I have two competing sets of propositions, set A (RHW) and set B (BIV); I am more confident in set A than set B; thus, am justified in believing set A.

There is a kind of Occam’s razor or ‘best explanation’ principle which leads to this confidence found in both dogmatism and explanationism. Setting aside whether or not that principle actually gets us to explanationism (for example, it isn’t clear to me that RHW is really any simpler than BIV), I worry that explanationism might ultimately be unsatisfying to the skeptic in parallel ways to dogmatism because of its reliance upon a best explanation principle. The skeptic has such a high standard of justification that the best explanation principle just doesn’t cut it. The skeptic seeks more than mere justified belief, he seeks knowledge or even certainty, which is not what the ‘best explanation’ principle can provide. The best explanation principle might itself need justification.

Perhaps I have just misunderstood the argument here, and maybe my description and criticism miss the mark entirely.



Where does justification end? (this is a response to skepticism)



He looks at several different ways of responding to skepticism.

ontological simplicity, coherence (consistency) simplicity, or there is one underlying phenomena that explain many surface phenomena.



Not ad hoc (explain more than just the case at hand)

Should unify phenomena
