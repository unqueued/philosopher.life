!! Why does your brother JRE not like [[Prompted Introspection Log]]?

He says it is difficult to decode. Is it really? I think many of these are just straight-up obvious to him. Maybe he finds them useless, boring, or not worth his time. That is certainly possible.

Does he not like engaging in this kind of reasoning? I don't know. I think he does. 

I am baffled, I have to say.

I realize, I write a ton, and he is not going to take the time to try to read it all (understandable, I suppose, as it would take an hour a week to do, as far as I've seen).
