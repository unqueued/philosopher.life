title: 2018.11.11 - Computer Musings: Mobile Typing

I need to become a decent typist on my phone. I'm still going to hate the device no matter what; it is not my device, I am just paying for the privilege to be its slave. There's no getting around the fact that it would be useful to be able to type even half as fast on the phone as I can on a full keyboard. I'll be trying out several keyboards. I actually want to integrate prediction, autocorrect, and autocomplete into the skill of typing on my phone in a significant way. I can see I may need to become adept with gestures as well. My goal is to approach this with fresh eyes.

* Swiftkey
** Gorgeous extended keyboard
** Actual button accuracy feels high, but may just be a feeling.
* Fleksy
** Solid minimal full keyboard, but I don't see what's special about it.
* Gboard
** Seems like the obvious keyboard to beat; it's the strongest tech company in the world.
** I despise the fact that to use this tool means I give it all up. When the entire method of input is digital, I have no control.
** The predictive text on this keyboard is absurdly good (they continue to improve).
** I spend half my time just looking at the prediction hunting for what I want. This isn't typing; this is prediction hunting.
** Voice continues to improve leaps and bounds.
*** I feel like I'm going to throw up.
* Minuum 
** Manipulative intro.
** So radically different. I've never used anything like it.
** It's EZ mode if you can't spell or you are sloppy.
** You actually have to get used to typing the entire word out (or nearly) to have a good prediction, unlike Gboard (who clearly has all the real firepower).
** One of my problems is that each button press makes my brain go "no, that's not what I want." Actually, I think this keyboard is only best if you don't even look at the predictions whatsoever.
** The unique ultra-slim keyboard is fascinating. My brain is so burned in QWERTY, that I don't see the point. This could be faster, but the prediction is not //that// good (though it is amazing).
