Normally I try to avoid zero-sum mindframes because I find them to be fairly icky. Unfortunately, they are sometimes accurate depictions of reality (as much as I despise that fact). Sometimes there is no meaning and increase in utility for cooperation. Sometimes there is no middle ground. Sometimes one side wins and the other loses, and steps leads you one way or the other. Sometimes there is no compromise or possibility for both sides to be satisfied.<<ref "2019.03.23">>
