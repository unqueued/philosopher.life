title: 2018.12.22 - Prompted Introspection: A Spoonful

!! Just a spoonful of what makes the medicine go down?

I do not know which interlocutor has asked me. I must answer as though an anonymous angel in the desert is asking me. It is the only [[right]] approach.

Saint Diogenesocrates, is that you? It is so good to see you once again. You honor me. I would prefer to just listen to you, but now you have picked me out in the dialectic and asked me to respond. It is my privilege. To my [[fff]] knowledge, it is my obligation to respond with either agreement or disagreement followed by the appropriate supporting argument. This question is open-ended in appearance. Is the premise of the question a valid one? I do not know, sir.

Sugarcoating is a simulation, an avoidance of what would otherwise be reality, an attempt to balance (or strengthen) the utilitarian equation of the context, a chaser/mixer to wash away the pain we believe is necessary to relieving us of a greater pain (or source of pain). Not all simulations are immoral, clearly. This is a viable notion to me, but it is not clear that all spoonfuls are acceptable masks.

Did you treat yourself and [[others]] as ends in themselves (or direct ends to [[The End]] in themselves)? This includes the utility calculation; it is embedded in [[The Categorical Imperative]]. I see particularizing the contextual [[agi]] considerations of my maxims are critical to answering this question. Please, Saint Diogenesocrates, could you be more specific about your question?

It is clear that just because something can make the medicine palatably go down does not justify it. What I use isn't necessary what others would need. What I use isn't even necessarily what I should. Thus, your question is too open-ended.
