title: 2019.02.22 - JRE: Sounds Off

My brother had pizza at work, but it was a blah day. 

He talked to his therapist, and she wanted to interpret his dream. He's not looking forward to the drive to see our donors (or perhaps seeing our donors). I talked a bit about my worry with Jung. 

The nerve which controls his face is hurting. He aint out of it yet. I hope it will heal quickly.

He had a failed project and felt frustrated in building his woodshop.

He sounded down today in general. He talked patiently, but he doesn't seem interested in much today. He was tired, and he sounded off.

He thanked me for calling him.
