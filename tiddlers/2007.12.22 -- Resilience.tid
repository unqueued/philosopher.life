title: 2007.12.22 -- Resilience

The purpose of this article is for us to better understand the meaning and value of resilience as it relates to your average PvP circumstances. I will give the equations context.

What is resilience?

Resilience is a 3-part stat.

A.) x% reduction in an opponent’s critical strike rate (henceforth variable resA)
B.) 2x% reduction in an opponent’s critical strike damage (resB)
C.) x% reduction in an opponent’s DoT damage (resC)

X = [Resilience rating * 0.025]

e.g. 100 resilience rating = 2.5% reduction in an opponent’s critical strike rate
5% reduction in an opponent’s critical strike damage
2.5% reduction in an opponet’s DoT damage

What is the purpose of resilience?

Resilience is a survivability stat which exists to mitigate the effectiveness of burst damage and randomness in the game. Unlike armor, it does not strictly mitigate all incoming damage like a blanket protection, however, it does serve to mitigate the random crit streaks and intensity of crits in the game while blanket-mitigating all DoT damage. Resilience eliminates variance in damage taken. Resilience, essentially, exists to make a more fair and predictable fight in PvP through increased consistency in survivability gains.

Beautifully, resilience mitigates nearly all sources of damage to some extent.

How valuable is this stat?

The best way to measure the effects of resilience is to understand its equivalence in HP. How much survivability does resilience add per itemization cost-unit as compared to the survivability gains of HP/Stamina of equivalent itemization costs? The truth of the matter is that several PvP circumstances exist in which resilience is the wrong stat in which to invest. Most players fail to recognize this fact.

HP, like AP is to melee damage, is a static and linear gain in survivability. Resilience, like most forms of damage reduction, functions exponentially, with geometric gains in survivability. Specifically, against targets that resilience can effect (assuming they have crit rating or use DoTs), resilience increases the value of each point of health.

To give a workable example, consider personA with 10k hp who faces a melee opponent with a 30% crit rate. If personA has one open gemslot, should he use a 12 stamina gem, 8 resilience gem, or 4 resilience/6 stamina to maximize his survivability against said opponent? 120hp vs. 0.2%/0.4% reduction vs. 0.1%/0.2%/60hp.

Without even looking too closely at the math, it is easy to see that the highest initial survivability (time to live) gains come from investment in HP/stamina. But, at some point, in cases where a person has enough [virtual HP] (actual HP + actual Healing received), exponential survivability stats overcome the utility of straight HP/Stamina investment in itemization costs. Where is the point of inflection? Where does resilience become greater in value, per itemization cost, than HP/stamina?

This is a somewhat complicated question to answer. It depends on several variables. Resilience rating, total virtual health, proportion of DD and DoT damage types, crit bonus, and crit rate are the fundamental variables you need to know. As each of these variables scale up or down, we’ll see shifts in the comparative values of resilience and stamina. In our case, we want to ask ourselves what the average quantity will be for each of these variables.

What calculations must be made?

We need to take a look at the very meaning of critical strike chance and how it effects survivability and opponent’s damage in order to fully understand what resilience is doing for us.

Take personA:

It takes 10,000 1-damage non-crit strikes to consume personA’s survivability.
If personA’s opponent (personB) has a 30% crit rate (and 100% crit damage bonus), then it will take ~7,692 strikes, or ~2307 2-damage crit strikes and ~5384 1-damage non-crit strikes, to consume personA’s survivability.

Moving from 0% to 30% crit chance on personB’s 1-damage strikes has a dramatic effect on personA’s time to live. 23.1% less effort is required of personB to get the same effect as striking without crits, and essentially, personA loses 23.1% survivability because of personB’s gain in crit chance.

+30% crit chance buff for personB is the same as a -23.1% debuff of personA’s HP.

10,000 * (1 - 23.1%) = 7,692 HP
7,692 1-damage non-crit strikes

Your opponent’s offense and your defense are mathematically translatable concepts. Because of this, you may even think of this situation as each point of personA’s 10,000 health is worth 23.1% LESS because of an increase in personB’s crit chance. Time to live ratio’s remain the same, regardless of how you look at the problem.

Damage enhancement is not directly the same loss in survivability for an opponent.

([HP] / (1 + [Damage Modifier])) = [Surivability Post Damage Modifier]
10,000 / (1 + .1) = 9,090
10,000 / (1 + .3) = 7,692
10,000 / (1 + .6) = 6,250
10,000 / (1 + 1.0) = 5,000
10,000 / (1 + 2.0) = 3,333

You’ll also notice that there is diminishing returns to increases in [Damage Modifer], but an exponential returns in mitigating [Damage Modifier]. Moving from 200% [DM] to 100% [DM], a 100% difference, is merely a 1,666 gain in survivability, while moving from 10% [DM] to 0% [DM], a 10% difference, is a whopping 910 survivability. The less crit your opponent has, the better resA’s effect will become.

Resilience effect A (resA) becomes better and better with each point (I’m not going to deal with the other two effects just yet), assuming that each percentage point of resilience has a corresonding degree of crit rating. If an opponent doesn’t have a great deal of crit rate, then resilience is obviously the stat to stack. Taking crit chance to near zero is preferred. Unfortunately, a character can only get so much resilience (capped in itemization), while crit rates are much easier to maximize. If high enough (beyond resilience correspondence cap), the higher your opponent’s crit rating, the less valuable resilience becomes in this respect. In some cases, crit ratings may soar so high that stamina provides greater benefit in survivability itemization.

Think about it: it takes 400 resilience to lower just 10% crit rate (and 400 resilience is a fairly large chunk). If an opponent has only 10% to begin with, then you are gaining 910 survivability. But, if the opponent had 35% crit rate (definitely possible), then you only move from 7407 to 8000 survivability, a 593 survivabilty gain. You would need a currently unreachable amount of resilience to cover that amount of crit rate. As such, you start at the low end of the curve when calculating how resilience negates crit rate, and you receive fewer actual time-to-live benefits. While resB attempts to curb this effect, it does not negate the strength of crit stacking beyond the reach of resilience itemization possibilities. In any case, the scaling needs of resilience promotes an all-or-nothing mentality (admittedly, itemization is limited, and you’re going to definitely have some degree of resilience in your gear if you PvP; however, a good portion of enchants/gems/trinkets have more variance to choose from).

The problem for the case for resilience may be worse. We need to convert the survivability gains of resilience to the flat survivability gains of stamina/HP in equivalent itemization costs.

Even if you used 400 resilience against an opponent with 10% crit rate, gaining 910 survivability, a 10% (9,090/910) increase in the value of your HP, you could do the same thing by just adding (10,000*10%) 1,000 HP.

10,000 * 10 = 11,000 / (1 + .1) = 10,000
10,000 / (1 + .1 - [400 resA or .1]) = 10,000

In this case, where playerA has 10,000 HP, a 1,000 HP gain, or 100 stamina, is the equivalent of the survivability gains of 400 resilience against an opponent with 10% crit chance. But, which is easier to reach in itemization costs, 100 stamina or 400 resilience?

Looking at gems, 100 stamina = 66.67 Resilience rating. For the itemization cost of 400 resilience, you would gain 600 stamina or 6,000 HP. It is simply obvious that 16k hp is going to have more survivability than 10k hp with 400 resilience against an opponent with a 10% crit rate.

10,000 / (1 + .1) = 9,090
16,000 / (1 + .1) = 14,545
10,000 / (1 + .1 - [400 resA or .1]) = 10,000

Using stamina in your itemization instead of resilience will net a player 5,455 survivability, while the equivalent itemization costs in resilience (400) only nets a player 910 survivability. Stamina is 500% better than resilience at 10,000 HP with an opponent at 10% crit rate. Stamina, as well, never capped, and resilience’s effect A capped because you can’t lower crit rate beyond 0%. This could exist if people were stacking enough resil and dropping every bit of crit rating possible for linear damage gains like AP/+spell/etc.

Again, as we saw before, resilience becomes even worse against targets with higher crit rates where our exponential gains of resilience are set back in the curve.

10,000 / (1 + .35) = 7,407
16,000 / (1 + .35) = 11,851
10,000 / (1 + .35 - [400 resA or .1]) = 8,000

Stamina = 11,851 - 7,407 = 4,444 survivability gain
Resilience = 593 survivability gain.

It would seem that Stamina is 649% better than resilience in this case. Ah, but now we have a crit rating that is not matched by resA, and we have not included the second effect of resilience, resB, in our calculation. Here, resB will curb the effects of rising crit rates that resA cannot negate. In this case, there is 25% crit chance left to be affected by resB’s effect. Essentially, the effects of any crit chance left over is reduced by resB.

[HP] / (1 + (([Crit rate] - [resA rate]) * (1 - [resB rate]))) = [Survivability Post Resilience] (resA and B’s effect)
10,000 / (1 + ((.35 - [.1]) * (1 - [.2]))) = 10,000 / (1 + (.25 * .8)) = 10,000 / (1 + .2) = 8,333

Notice a 333 survivability gain because of resB against an opponent with 35% crit rate.

ResA=593 survivability gain
ResB=333 survivability gain
Resilence nets 926 survivability
Stamina nets 4,444 survivability

Stamina is 380% better than resilience when including ResB’s effect with 10k hp and a 35% crit rate opponent.

There are several forces at work. The higher initial crit rate, the less we benefit from lowering it. However, the higher the crit rate, the better resilience becomes, proportionately, as compared to stamina.

We do not play in a world where everone has exactly 10k initial HP. In some cases, for example, heavy-healing based arena circumstances, whereby a person might recieve 50k healing throughout the game in addition to their natural 10k (we might say they have 60k virtual HP), resilience is extremely valuable stat. Resilience scales with your HP. It makes each health point worth MORE; stamina cannot do this.

So, taking our example at a 35% crit rate:

60,000 / (1 + .35) = 44,444
66,000 / (1 + .35) = 48,889
60,000 / (1 + (([.35] - [.1]) * (1 - [.2]))) = 50,000

Hello, resilience.

Stamina: 48,889 - 44,444 = 4,445 survivability
Resilience: 50,000 - 44,444 = 5,556 survivability

Resilience is 25% better than stamina here. Make it 590,000 Healing + 10,000 starting HP.

600,000 / (1 + .35) = 444,444
606,000 / (1 + .35) = 448,889
600,000 / (1 + (([.35] - [.1]) * (1 - [.2]))) = 500,000

Stamina: 448,889 - 444,444 = 4,445 survivability (hrmm…I swear i’ve seen this number before…linear gains look small with enough virtual HP)
Resilience: 500,000 - 444,444 = 55,556 survivability

400 Resilience is 1,149% greater than 600 Stamina with 600k virtual hp against a target with 35% crit rate.

Stamina, a linear survivability stat, becomes outclassed quickly in fights where there are high crit rates and a lot of healing.

Where is the point of inflection, whereby stamina=resilience in itemization costs?

As stated, it depends on several variables: resilience rating (converted to resA,B, and C rates), total virtual health, ratio of DoT and Direct Damage, crit bonus, and crit chance. We need to define these variables more to understand the process.

[Initial HP] + [Actual Healing received] = [Virtual HP] (or [VHP] for short)

This cannot include overhealing. It must include all buffs to your HP that are not dispelled.

Crit bonus is an important factor. Some classes have higher damage bonuses than others with a critical strike. This influences the value of resB. The higher the bonus, the more effect from resB. This show how crit bonus and resB operates inside a resilience calculation:

[Damage] + ((([Damage] * ([Crit chance] - [ResA])) * [Crit Bonus]) * (1 - [resB])) = [Damage Post Crit and Res]

Take: 1000 1-damage swings, 30% crit chance, 0% crit bonus, 10% resA and 20% resb

1000 + (((1000 * (30%-10%)) * 0%) * (1 - 20%)) =
1000 + (((1000 * 20%) * 0%) * 80%) =
1000 + ((200 * 0%) * 80%) =
1000 + (0 * 80%) = 1000

Take: 1000 1-damage swings, 30% crit chance, 50% crit bonus, 10% resA and 20% resb

1000 + (((1000 * (30%-10%)) * 50%) * (1 - 20%)) =
1000 + (((1000 * 20%) * 50%) * 80%) =
1000 + ((200 * 50%) * 80%) =
1000 + (100 * 80%) = 1080, would have been 1100 without resB. 20 damage reduction from resB

Take: 1000 1-damage swings, 30% crit chance, 100% crit bonus, 10% resA and 20% resb

1000 + (((1000 * (30%-10%)) * 100%) * (1 - 20%)) =
1000 + (((1000 * 20%) * 100%) * 80%) =
1000 + ((200 * 100%) * 80%) =
1000 + (200 * 80%) = 1160, would have been 1200 without resB. 40 damage reducton from resB

ResB’s effect scales with crit bonus. This also means that resB affect melee classes much worse, in general, than casters. With crit bonus in mind, we have to rewrite the [Survivability Post Resilience] formula:

[HP] / (1 + ((([Crit rate] - [resA rate]) * [Crit Bonus]) * (1 - [resB rate]))) = [Survivability Post Resilience] ([SPR])

ResC’s effect has yet to be discussed. This is very straightfoward. It has the same value as resA against DoTs, and it is a strict mitigation of all DoT damage (no randomness involved). The problem with calculating ResC’s effect is that we need to know the proportion of damage that is DoT and DD over an average fight. Resilience will have a more profound effect upon DD, and thus, including this ratio of DD and DoT in our equation will bring our numbers more in line with the actual average value of resilience. Unfortunately, this gives us yet another factor of variance. Some circumstances will have heavy DoT damage and others none.

At 400 resilience you will reduce all DoT damage by 10% (just as you would reduce all crit chances against you by 10%). Assuming you were taking 100% DoT damage, the survivability value of resC is exactly 10%.

It takes 10,000 1-point DoT ticks to consume the survivability of someone with 10k HP. Let’s look at what adding 400 resilience, or 10% damage reduction of DoT’s can do:

What happens in the reduction, where X is the end survivability:

X * (1 + (-10%)) = 10,000.

11,111 * (1 + (-10%)) = 10,000

so:

[HP] / (1 + ([Damage modifier]) = [Survivability]

10,000 / (1 + (-10%)) = 11,111 survivability, or a 1,111 gain in survivability.

So, to include ResC, just see it as a negative Damage modifier on DoT damage.

[HP] / (1 - [ResC]) = [Survivability Post ResC]
10,000 / (1 - 10%) = 11,111

The total equation becomes uglier by including resC’s effect. We have to include the ratio of DD and DoT damage. They will serve as two different halves of survivability.

Proportion of damage that is Direct (critable) = [PDD]
Proportion of damage that is damage over time (affected by resC) = [PDOT]

[PDD] + [PDOT] = 100% — always.

(([PDD] * [HP]) / (1 + ((([Crit rate] - [resA rate]) * [Crit Bonus]) * (1 - [resB rate])))) + ([PDOT] * [HP] / (1 - [ResC rate])) = [Survivability Post Resilience] (Res A, B, and C)

Solving the point of inflection problem:

The base inflection problem is already in front of us. We’ve dissected how this equation works and how variables impact our outcome. We need to calculate our current survivability and then consider the value of additional stamina or resilience. This means that resA, B, and C’s rates will need to be shown as conversions. Resilience points or rating (as seen in itemization), rather than percentage or rate = [Res].

(([PDD] * [HP]) / (1 + ((([Crit rate] - ([Res] * 0.00025)) * [Crit Bonus]) * (1 - ([Res] * .0005))))) + ([PDOT] * [HP] / (1 - ([Res] * 0.00025))) = [Survivability]

1 Resilience = 1.5 Stamina

We have to solve the problem from the perspective that we have a certain amount of itemization cost available to spend.

X = itemization cost spent on resilience

(([PDD] * ([HP] + (X * 15))) / (1 + ((([Crit rate] - ([Res] * 0.00025)) * [Crit Bonus]) * (1 - ([Res] * .0005))))) + ([PDOT] * ([HP] + (X * 15)) / (1 - ([Res] * 0.00025))) = [Additional HP Survivability]

(([PDD] * [HP]) / (1 + ((([Crit rate] - (([Res] + X) * 0.00025)) * [Crit Bonus]) * (1 - (([Res] + X) * .0005))))) + ([PDOT] * [HP] / (1 - (([Res] + X) * 0.00025))) = [Additonal Resilience Survivability]

(([PDD] * ([HP] + (X * 15))) / (1 + ((([Crit rate] - ([Res] * 0.00025)) * [Crit Bonus]) * (1 - ([Res] * .0005))))) + ([PDOT] * ([HP] + (X * 15)) / (1 - ([Res] * 0.00025))) = (([PDD] * [HP]) / (1 + ((([Crit rate] - (([Res] + X) * 0.00025)) * [Crit Bonus]) * (1 - (([Res] + X) * .0005))))) + ([PDOT] * [HP] / (1 - (([Res] + X) * 0.00025)))

Solve for X.

If you don’t feel like doing it, I have an excellent spreadsheet available. Put in your stats, how much itemization you have available, and it will show you what you can gain in your specific circumstance.

Conclusions:

Resilience extends your survivability in long-term, healing intensive and high crit rate battles. The shorter the battle, the less effective resilience will be.

Melee classes are affected the most by this stat.

Healers that are self-healing will draw the greatest gains from resilience. You need only enough HP to get the next heal off. For a common Focus Fire target, with a full-time heal bot, and a very high virtual HP, resilience is a bomb stat.

For classes that aren’t focus fired as often, HP DOES offer higher initial survivability. But, why stack HP at all if you aren’t even being focus fired? We can pour our itemization into damage, because we know we aren’t going to be focus fired. This, of course, makes us better targets to hit, because we are easier to kill than everyone else.

It stands that resilience acts as a bluff stat on a non-focus fired target in a team with a healer. It basically allows you to pour most of your points into damage, enough resilience to act as a deterent to being FFed, and almost no HP/stamina.

For classes with low or no-healing circumstances, as found in 1v1, 2v2, and several 3v3 groups, HP/stamina is strictly a better survivability stat. The question becomes: is survivability important for those circumstances? Perhaps, due to your class matrix or circumstance, you find yourself never being FF’d until you’ve already lost the battle. Maybe it is rogue/priest and the priest is FF’d every single game. Would the rogue really care about his survivability? If FFing the rogue from the beginning of a fight is an autoloss for a team (because tactically it would enable the priest to do his thing), then the priest will be the FF target. Therefore, the rogue is free, in itemization to stray away from survivability in favor of damage. You want to create teams where every target is a bad target to focus. But, you want to know who they will focus and bluff in your itemization.

Several teams don’t even heal (2 or 3 DPS matrices) enough for resilience to matter enough. Stack stamina.
