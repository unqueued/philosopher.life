* Confirm My Bias
** https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2017/12/06/facebook-already-won-the-war-for-your-mind-now-it-wants-your-children/
*** Finally, a "for the children" argument I actually buy. They are so rare. I originally put this in Stunning! It's damned good.
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTWM7HV2UI
*** Nothing new. I've seen it before. It's a good one. Capitalism is shifting more and more to dominating the market share of attention. Much of the web has become a massive direct marketing platform.

*** Some interesting claims in here.
** https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/7j5dov/what_should_we_think_about_transracialism/
*** I still have plenty of mixed thoughts on this issue.
** https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/7j70r8/discussion_are_introverts_the_perfect_capitalists/
*** What an odd question. I also want to point out that there are extroverted proles who support capitalism (but aren't exactly capitalists) that survive better because they are extroverted.

* Fishy

** http://www.weareresonate.com/2017/12/just-waste-money-chinese-students-regret-enrolling-in-us-universities-ivy-league/
*** I agree with much of their thinking. I am convinced this is a form of propaganda though.
