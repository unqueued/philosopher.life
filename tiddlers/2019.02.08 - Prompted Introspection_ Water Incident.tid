title: 2019.02.08 - Prompted Introspection: Water Incident

!! Describe an incident that had something to do with water.

I have responded to this in [[2017.12.04 - Prompted Introspection Log: The Water Incident]], and arguably here as well: [[2019.01.31 - Prompted Introspection: Fish or Swim]].

It was the summer between 8th grade and 9th, and I was at the city pool. Some of the cheerleaders were there wrestling and playing in the water, including one who was clearly a D-cup (especially absurd for our age). Her top came off right in front of me as she was horsing around. My god, her tits were amazing. It felt like an 70s or 80s movie. We laughed, I spanked.
