* Zucchini and Squash.
* Laundry piles up again, and your offspring need to clean their rooms.
** Bathrooms should be set.
* Maybe see if you can hunt down the new maintenance man you met. 3-4 books a week is a lot. He sounds insanely busy.
* Your offspring think you're sleep schedule is getting crazier. Your eyes and head hurt a lot. Dude. Wake up: get to sleep.
* I need to fuck.
* Keep hammering at your letters.
