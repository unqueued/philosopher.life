I've quietly debated whether or not I should {[[Contact]]} you for some time. It has been quite a while since we last talked in depth. I was in crisis, and I've been clawing my way out for years. You seemed to be doing well when we talked several years ago. I'm sorry to hear that life isn't going exactly as you'd [[hope]]d.<<ref "i">> I know precious little about who you are now and what you are up to, but I would like to know. We can't sit across the table or in the classroom together in dialectic, but I'd like to maintain an actual relationship with you over the interwebs. =)

I have seen there aren't many people I hold in high regard after years pass. It is true that I don't know who you are now, but the man I knew years ago is undoubtedly a person I still respect. Looking back these years later, I want to say thank you for being my friend. Whether you realized it or not, I learned a lot from you. You never seemed to have a problem with my autism,<<ref "a">> and you were absurdly charitable (like any good philosopher). You helped me better appreciate epistemic humility,<<ref "s">> and I'm grateful to you. Thank you! 

I've been drafting a weird piece of philosophical artwork for a couple years now.<<ref "w">> Perhaps it is absurd or bad philosophy,<<ref "c">> but I work hard on it. Even though it's just in its infancy, it means a lot to me. I hope it will take me a lifetime to complete. I want you to know that I'm dedicating part of it to you: {[[Help]]}. I think I had the will-power to start creating it because of several conversations we've had over the years. It's been a journey. Even if you hate what I'm doing here, I want to say thank you because I wouldn't be walking this path without your help.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
