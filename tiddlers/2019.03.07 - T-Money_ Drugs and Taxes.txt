WED 5:37 PM
Thank you.
THU 12:17 PM
It's neat to see two people send me links about this. Lol.
THU 12:18 PM
I like the idea of the FDA identifying depression as a major mental illness and often the leading cause about suicide. With that being said attempting obviously very unique and different ways of treating it
THU 1:25 PM
I hear ya.
THU 1:25 PM
I guess something can also be said for the fact that we have so much Leisure Time so much luxury then we have the opportunity to be that depressed however I'm not sure that it really works that way
THU 1:26 PM
My opinion is that esketamine is not as effective as ketamine, but it is being heralded because the original and more effective drug cannot be patented. This is about making money, not about treating people.
THU 1:26 PM
I cannot speak to causes and meaning of depression well enough. There is likely something right about the claim.
THU 1:27 PM
Perhaps when the issue isn't about survival but staying on the hedonic treadmill, blinding ourselves to what is actually valuable, depression is a kind of loss of value that spurs us to search. Anxiety has something similar going on.
THU 1:28 PM
Here is a good one for you. I can't be diagnosed with any type of mental illness. Or see a psychiatrist using my health insurance, because I have a security clearance
THU 1:31 PM
That is evil.
THU 1:31 PM
So believe it or not I get prescribed Valium by my urologist. It is used to treat chronic non-bacterial prostatitis
THU 1:32 PM
The doctor is not dumb he knows it benefits me in other ways and I've said as much. I've also identified exactly what I told you. He's a very cool urologist
THU 1:32 PM
I left work early today because I have a I left work early today because I have a urologist I left work early today because I have a urologist appointment. I go every. I go every 6. I go every 6 months to get my Valium script refilled. Clerk Kentucky state law I have to be seen every 6 months and I'm only allowed 6 refills
THU 1:34 PM
For some reason this causes me great anxiety.
THU 1:34 PM
I actually asked him to take me off Valium for about 6 months. I only lasted about five before I moved my appointment up I had to go back in and ask for Valium again. He was very cool and gave me back my original dosage am my original quantities
THU 1:35 PM
I made a point not to not to use every single refill. And I'm very particular about the words I use on the quantities I take how often and when. I'm also very adamant about my job what I do in the fact that I cannot take them while at work
THU 1:36 PM
But I do genuinely have chronic non-bacterial prostatitis that causes pain in both my perineum my epididymitis and in my whole left groin area
THU 1:37 PM
You worried some day you will be cut off?
THU 1:37 PM
I definitely am sometimes worried about that. But I don't take it every day so I'm not addicted to it so I really have nothing to be worried about
THU 1:38 PM
Hopefully, you have enough saved to bridge the gap.
THU 1:38 PM
I still take Kratom everyday. But generally I save my whole week's dosage of Valium for my weekend
THU 1:39 PM
I apologize I kind of just unloaded a bunch of b******* on you and I haven't even asked how you're doing
THU 1:39 PM
You think it will be difficult to come off Kratom if they ever schedule it?
THU 1:39 PM
Rofl. No, don't feel bad. You have to talk about it with someone. I'd like to hope I'm a good ear for this particular subject.
THU 1:40 PM
It's hard to find medicine in a world that aims to exploit you.
THU 1:40 PM
No on two separate occasions I force myself to come off of it. There was some slight discomfort for about 2 to 3 days. But I used my Valium to substitute and by the third day I had zero cravings other than psychological cravings.
THU 1:41 PM
I wouldn't even compare the detox to even nicotine or anything like that it's I don't know about as minor as you can get
THU 1:41 PM
Good
THU 1:42 PM
Don't get me wrong there where are withdrawal symptoms. But I'll call Shannon hoon I have never met nothing that my spirit couldn't kill.
THU 1:43 PM
I came off of long nights and weekends of cocaine use. I've came off of crack. I came off of long periods of painkiller abuse. I came off of 3 years of everyday use of Xanax. I have a couple of days of discomfort and irritability from Kratom with a walk in the park
THU 1:44 PM
I agree that's very good. Valium scares me and Xanax scares me in terms of withdrawal symptoms. I quit Xanax cold turkey and probably almost put myself in the hospital. I ended up weaning myself off of them thankfully I had enough stash back
THU 1:45 PM
But the last two and a half years of college I was given a large doses of Xanax by the doctor at Health Services
THU 1:45 PM
I strongly prefer cannabis to benzos. I have lifetimes of benzos, but they aren't for me. They scare me too much too.
THU 1:46 PM
I will continue to sing the praises of legalizing weed.
THU 1:46 PM
Is it the withdrawal symptoms that scare you?
THU 1:47 PM
Yeah benzos are so highly addictive is it is scary. That's why I usually go all week without taking any then I take my benzos on the weekend and then Monday I'm a little grouchy and I go all week again without taking them
THU 1:47 PM
I learned my lesson after Xanax
THU 1:47 PM
My benzos are research chemicals. .6ml fluid lasts at least 18 hours. High physical dependence rates. You can't mix it with anything, and if you were to use it multiple days in a row, you simply cannot cold turkey it.
THU 1:49 PM
I touch that one only with a 10-foot pole.
THU 1:50 PM
Oh you can mix it with anyting but you are playing with fire
THU 1:52 PM
In excess usually just put people. They nsleep. I think benzos are safer than opium. Based drugs.
THU 1:55 PM
Agreed.
THU 1:56 PM
Heroin is how I aim to go out.
THU 1:56 PM
Will be the last thing on my bucketlist, I hope.
THU 1:56 PM
I apologize. I just did one of the dumbest things I've done in a long time. I filled my car up with gas and while the car was pumping went inside to buy something. Came outside didn't unhook from the pump and drove about 10 ft forward and yanked the pump from the quick disconnect at the top of the pump
THU 2:05 PM
Rofl
THU 2:06 PM
Noice
THU 2:06 PM
pretty funny actually. I was in a rush to go to my doctor's appointment and I was on E. So I coil the hose back up on the ground go to the store and tell the girls what happened. They took my name and number and I went ahead and wrote a short explanation of quote accident, no spillage, sincerest apologies. Then when I went back out to the pump I realized since I hadn't hung the pump back on the receiver that it was still recognizing my card as being utilized. So I had to stop at the pump then I just rip the f****** handle off of. Put the handle on the pump station so it would clear it get my receipt so I know what are the hot f***** up at. Are they closed the hose back up on the ground.
THU 2:07 PM
A quick examination it appears that they deliberately install a pull out fuse in the hose so that scenario does not cause injury to the car or the pump
THU 2:08 PM
Hopefully they don't try to charge me for repairs. But at least they have me on camera going back into the store and a handwritten apology. Which is probably would a lot less and they would get for most people
THU 2:09 PM
Hopefully it works out, lol. I bet this kind of thing happens often enough.
THU 2:11 PM
I'm obviously just anxious and ready to get this stupid doctor's appointment over with. Maybe I should have not have dosed Kratom after work. LOL. It gives me the feeling of like cannabis and half a Percocet
THU 2:11 PM
lol
THU 2:11 PM
That is insane.
THU 2:11 PM
Which part?
THU 2:12 PM
LOL
THU 2:12 PM
Kratom before heading to the doctor
THU 2:12 PM
When I'm not at work I do very little sober
THU 2:13 PM
And because my doctor knows Valium helps with anxiety. It's pretty easy to be anxious for me and to exacerbate the obvious symptoms of anxiety.
THU 2:13 PM
Really I I don't have to even fake it. If you've ever met me and talk to me you know I'm pretty high-strung all the time. I talked a lot. It's obvious and I'm a little uncomfortable and nervous most of the time. So yeah. I suppose I am surprised that you would think it was insane for me to do something that I do every day
THU 2:14 PM
I take my kratom in the parking lot at work. Right after my shift ends. So it kicks in before I get home
THU 2:15 PM
Do you not venture into public after a toke or you just stay home?
THU 2:26 PM
I'm a homebody.
THU 3:33 PM
I have been in public while high though.
THU 3:33 PM
In the end, I prefer just to be with my family when I'm high. I need to have someone to talk with most of the time, lol.
THU 3:34 PM
I'm a home body too, but being in public gives me anxiety. Anything I can do to assist it's reduction I will. I have also had a few more years and alot more practice being highly intoxicated and not showing signs.
THU 3:35 PM
I drive, I shop, I interact with strangers. I go to doctor appointments.
THU 3:36 PM
I pick my kid up from school. I dgaf.
THU 3:36 PM
Ive learned to function stoned without anyone noticing. Half the time. My wife doesn't even know.
THU 3:37 PM
If I take too much Valium my speech will slur sometimes.
THU 3:37 PM
Alcohol is a different story. That stuff turns me into a different person.
THU 3:38 PM
I hate drunk T-Money. But he csn be alot of fun.
THU 3:38 PM

Hahah. Truf
THU 3:42 PM
I don't recall meeting drunk T-Money too often in college.
THU 3:43 PM
Is that sarcasm?
THU 3:43 PM
No. I legit don't remember.
THU 3:45 PM
I remember you smoking more than drinking.
THU 3:46 PM
I probabaly respected you enough to avoid you while I was really drunk.
THU 3:46 PM
I did smoke alot more.
THU 3:46 PM
Becuase if I drank I usually couldn't make it to class.

THU 4:15 PM
The wall is ridiculous. It's trumps pyrimid. It's his ACA. It's dumber than shit.
THU 4:16 PM
I think we need to secure our boarders. Using improved technology. Hire more broader guards and improve relations with both Mexico and Canada.
THU 4:17 PM
But for. Some reason  alot of conservatives have made this assumption that ever boarder jumper is a murderous rapist with a duffle. Bag of meth
THU 4:18 PM
Like drugs aren't coming in on 18. It's all in backpacks on wet backs.
THU 4:18 PM
18 wheelers.
THU 4:18 PM
I do not see why we need to secure our borders.
THU 4:20 PM
I'm OK with open boards if we eliminate the drain on the welfare state. Stop using federal funds to prop up the illegals.
THU 4:22 PM
We can't financially afford it.
THU 4:22 PM
That does not seem obvious to me.
THU 4:22 PM
The US would be overrun with illegal. Immigrants looking for free Healthcare.
THU 4:23 PM
Is their a country with complete open boarders?
THU 4:24 PM
Can't think of one.
THU 4:24 PM
We don't even have free healthcare for own citizens
THU 4:24 PM
Though, that could be easily fixed as well
THU 4:25 PM
Google says their are aom counties that have open agreements between the two.
THU 4:25 PM
Aye.
THU 4:25 PM
I don't see how we could. Have free Healthcare and the innovation. Without massive tax increases.
THU 4:26 PM
I suppose you would. Cut the military budget to $0?
THU 4:26 PM
You sure you're looking hard for it?
THU 4:26 PM
Maybe I'm missing something. Government spending is not the most effective way to reduce health care costs and increase coverage
THU 4:28 PM
I look to the private market.
THU 4:28 PM
But now with the ACA. We are almost there anyway. But I'm paying alot. Of. Money for it. To offset the costs of those who get it for free.
THU 4:29 PM
ACA isn't even close.
THU 4:30 PM
Many nations appear to do a much better job than we do in healthcare, many of them not privatized.
THU 4:31 PM
With income taxes that are double. Ours.
THU 4:31 PM
I'm not opposed to that. It's pretty clear that the wealthy should be pay far more than they do.
THU 4:32 PM
I think you feel the squeeze in your tax bracket far more than the wealthy.
THU 4:33 PM
I see it as a rhetorical sleight of hand to convince reactionaries to be against taxation.
THU 4:33 PM
I think the idea if taxing income is absurd. Tax consumption with increasing taxes on luxury goods. Like if you gonna buy a yatch. It's gonna be a hefty federal sales tax on it. Vs a Jon boat.
THU 4:35 PM
I think the idea of power centralization is absurd.
THU 4:35 PM
If you really care about the theory of utility, you are going to take diminishing marginal utility seriously enough to recognize that global utility is maximized by bringing the bottom up.
THU 4:36 PM
After ~115k a year (average), there aren't utility gains for the average person.
THU 4:37 PM
Term. Limits for congress.
THU 4:38 PM
Lol
THU 4:38 PM
Audit the fed.
THU 4:38 PM
Decentralizing power is the only answer.
THU 4:38 PM
How best to do that, I am sure, is contextual.
THU 4:39 PM
I. Agree with you there.
THU 4:39 PM
I can't wait to get out of this Dr office. I'm. Always an anxious. Mess here.
THU 4:39 PM
I'm sorry. I hope it goes by quickly for you!
THU 4:40 PM
How are you? How has your week been? Do you guys have any plans for the weekend?
THU 4:40 PM
(I think. I'm his last pacient and he's running behind) he will Prolly throw my scripts at me and roll out. I'll talk. About. My last severe flare up and job location change and stress increase. And he will write that shit.
THU 4:41 PM
We're doing well enough. Working my butt off on the wiki. Work has been decent, talking with the kids. My kiddos have been productive, and they've been happy. It feels like autopilot but also a whirlwind.
THU 4:41 PM
I am. Impressed by your ability to be so productive.
THU 4:42 PM
I suppose I Produce. Just differently.
THU 4:42 PM
High praise, thank you.
THU 4:42 PM
I cannot stay thay mentally focused on intense philosophy or economics.
THU 4:43 PM
I think it happens in spurts for me. I like to walk, that seems to get the juices flowing for me.
THU 4:44 PM
In the cold?
THU 4:45 PM
With my wife, yeah. We suit up and walk around the mountain top.
THU 4:45 PM
She hates the cold.
THU 4:45 PM
I'm fat. I can deal better with it than her.
THU 4:46 PM
Lol. That is nice. I spend so. Much time on my feet I csn barely walk when I get home.
THU 4:46 PM
Lol
THU 4:46 PM
Cause I'm overweight!
THU 4:46 PM
I easily see how people get big and just never lose the weight.
THU 4:47 PM
Preach.
THU 4:47 PM
I hate doing the calorie counting thing so much.
THU 4:47 PM
It works, but it's hell.
THU 4:47 PM
Yeah. Torture. It is defiantly a self. Control. Thing.
THU 4:48 PM
And I have little of it when it comes to food.
