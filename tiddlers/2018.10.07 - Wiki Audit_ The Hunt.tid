title: 2018.10.07 - Wiki Audit: The Hunt

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

Part of the hyperbeast is in my own wiki. I'm here to hunt it down internally before I could hope to hunt it down externally. 

[[Wiki: Mechanics]] and [[Tags]] are of paramount importance to the [[Wiki Audit]]. I need to grow these carefully and well. I am going to make big mistakes, and that is okay. I need to write it out and keeping digging for [[diamonds]], [[redpills]], and [[predators]]. I need to follow increasingly valuable rules, and I need to explain them to myself and others as effectively as possible.

[[Link Log]] is a sick project. God damn it is [[Leet|Wiki: Leet]]. It would be nice if I could stop commenting. I need to stop hoarding them in my browser. I need to let it go. Collect links, read, and just dump 'em. Right? Ehhhh...that sounds like a mistake; it needs more signal.

Try this with the kids this week. Let them write whatever they want to say; see if that works. Say absolutely nothing negative in Family Meetings about it. If they do a good job, say it.
