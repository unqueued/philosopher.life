Son:

Mountain, caverns, lackey, vial, inc, SGC, chieftain. Fuck yeah, I'll keep that. He mulls on the play. Mountain, lackey. I mirror. Mountain, vial. I inc his lackey, connect->SGC. He matrons->STING!? I chieftain, swing unblocked, lackey->SS, SS the matron. He stings SGC(?), matron->inc. I crater his sting and ping, then I swing. GG. We talked about the game for a bit.

Daughter:

2 mountain, waste, port, vial, inc, crater. Heavy control. Let's do it. I mountain, vial. She mountain, lackey. I mountain. She drops mountain, swing, I inc (draw another ;P). She doesn't port me, I waste her port (she still doesn't port me). She drops double vial, EoT->vial->crater. I waste her caverns, drop skirk, swing with crater. She drops skirk. I swing with crater unblocked. Port her on upkeep. I swing with both unblocked, drop another port. Upkeep port. She drops chief, EoT->inc->chief (I think she's going to win; I win now or never given her hand and vials). I top matron->kiki->matron->trash, swing with clone and crater unblocked. She leaders->(chieftain, driver, trash), chieftain, inc->kiki->skirk and crater her chieftain. I swing unblocked, vial->trash before damage, sac to trash to take vials. I port her completely on upkeep, and she wastes a port. I top leader->(chieftain, instigator), drop em and swing unblockable lethal. Taking both vials was the only reason I was in the game after she showed me her hand; if she skirked more aggressively, I would have lost.

Daughter:

Neither of us love our hands. I keep: 3 mountain, caverns, 2 lackey, matron. She goes port, vial. I mountain, lackey. We joke about lands, she drops waste, vial. I drop mountain, lackey, swing->Krenko. She drops caverns, vial->driver. She doesn't port me, I crater->driver, swing, matron->kiki. She incs KRENKO, I don't kiki before krenko activation on purpose, activate krenko, EoT->kiki->matron->trash. I trash, swing, clone trash. GG.

Two hour discussion of control role and the little things branching heavily into [[The Existential Game]], master/slave dialectics, wiki as autonomy tools, and preparations for the desert.
