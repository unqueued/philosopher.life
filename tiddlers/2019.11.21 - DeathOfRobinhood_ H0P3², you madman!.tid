//XD. Honorary [[Antineoplastic Analysis|Antipleonasm Analysis]]!//

Just when I thought you were getting to the end of 06.25 you go and tack on the last letter I wrote you in order to respond to that too!

Oh well. Call me up when it's time for the book tour!

My attempt at an Anti-neo...plastic...um...:

I often tell people that films are something that exist not in your mind, but somewhere above you [points above head]. Once you've decided to make a film and put the process in motion, [...] well, there is only one ideal way for you to carry out your work, [...] and the trick thus becomes finding it.

What I'm trying to say here is that, when you create your scenarios, there is always only one ideal scenario. There is always something with a particular motif that may not be in you, but will always be somewhere here [points above head]. To write a scenario means to search for this.

Yes! You have infinite leeway in arranging the starting conditions, but once you tip over the first domino, there is only one way the the circumstances ought to play out. I am free to get it wrong of course, and I often do, willfully; because I decide to forego the necessary wrestling with the material out of laziness, or else, a desire to meet the expectations of convention (which may or may not align with the ideal outcome depending on how novel the arrangement of particulars or how frayed (I imagine) the aesthetic perceptions of my (imaginary) judges).

I love the gesture of pointing above the head. Wherever the objective (morally and aesthetically necessary) sum of your given variables, that's kind of where it is. 

I wish I had the credibility to just point sagely, and people would nod and put in print my proverbial ad-libs. It would save us from so many awkward conversations about how, because in doing, reflecting, repenting, and repeating, I have climbed, and my GUT is now more closely aligned with the best possible version of this cartoon picture than the upper regions of the conceptual airspace over your head.

Oh that the 'up there' would be my ally! That the conflict would be ended by the opening of a shaft of light from heaven (to the sound of the Looney Tunes brrr-OW) and a voice declaring that I was the beloved - Listen to me!

With my ACME rocket, I will ascend to the highest heavens; I will raise my seat above the stars; I will sit on the mount of assembly, and will rise up above the top of the clouds; I will be...disqualified.

There is one Sun, but I do not have a monopoly upon its rays. It would be enough if, by its light, I may be permitted to do the best work I can.
