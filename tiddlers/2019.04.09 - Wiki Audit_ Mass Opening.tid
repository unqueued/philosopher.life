Edited [[$:/core/macros/timeline]] and [[$:/language/RecentChanges/DateFormat]] to make the open-full-day links. I can explain the bit of code here, so why not? Here's all it does:

#Create a button (that does all the stuff below)
#*Style it like a link
#*Color it footnote green
#*Make its text a date, the one that would normally go above every day in New and Recent
#List all the tiddlers for that day, and open/go to them all, one by one
#List the first tiddler for that day, go back to it (aka the top of the list)

The rest was already in timeline, such as the links below each date. Also, had to move the cool fade-bracket-things into timeline itself, so they wouldn't become links.

In other news, created [[The 1000]] (list of the last 1000 modified tiddlers, I don't suggest going there), and stuck it in the More tab in the sidebar.

I'm shocked that I've touched 1k tiddlers in the past month. That's insane.

Why is [[.i3/config]] missing? Ugh.

I'm in lurv with EditButtons. I feel like a fucking idiot (but, cmon, I am an idiot with respect to this and so much more) for not having used them before. It's not just control of the story river either (which is outstanding). I like being able to force saves on my phone. Just now, I was swapping out unicode symbols in [[Firmcoding Macros]] and it bypasses how slow Bob can be (I only wish I kept my place like an anchor), and it was rapid.
