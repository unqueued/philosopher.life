!! Audit:

* My children are worried about their schoolwork. I'm glad to see them taking it seriously. I hope that I am asking the correct amount of effort from them. I will strive to make sure that we seek the practically ideal rather than the ideally ideal.
* I feel like there is a giant lag spike between when I first set out to do something in our family meetings and when I actually do i
* I fear I am a terrible role model for our children. Fuck me. =/ Well, I must try to do better!
* Heachaches disappeared, but I'm having a harder time sleeping.
* Everyone has been fairly healthy. 
* I really enjoy our compliment-giving time. 
* It's clear that the bulk of our family meeting just isn't captured by this log. This is merely a ritual we complete after the family meeting, in a sense.
* We had a very productive month. I think we continue to move in the right direction. We are beyond recovery stages now; I believe we are actually building to greatness.
