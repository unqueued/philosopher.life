Have a great day [[h0p3]]
WED 8:47 AM
You too =)
WED 8:47 AM
Will be thinking about your paper.
WED 8:47 AM
What you looking forward to today?
WED 8:47 AM
Thanks! It’s still a rough draft so don’t worry about ripping it apart. I know you’ll help me keep the facts straight.
WED 8:50 AM
The pot of curry we’ll be making tonight is what’s going to get me through today. :joy:
WED 8:50 AM
Noice.
WED 8:50 AM
What about you?
WED 8:50 AM
Just grinding away today.
WED 8:51 AM
I hope your reading and writing will be bountiful!
WED 8:52 AM
Thank you! =)
WED 8:52 AM
Gonna rapidfire thoughts.
WED 10:39 AM
I'm not convinced individuality is the fitting word.
WED 10:40 AM
Identity is likely a better cluster. I usually think of postmodernism as hyperindividualistic.
WED 10:41 AM
You do speak of identity though, but I would wrestle more with that.
WED 10:42 AM
Love the discussion of schizophrenia. It should be noted that MPD and schizophrenia are not the same thing. It's an interesting issue.
WED 10:43 AM
I see a lot more doubts about MPD, but schizophrenia is a more understood notion, imho.
WED 10:44 AM
"another aspect of Postmodernism is trying to uncover a distinct and universal truth." -- I'll argue that postmodernism can be understood taking modernism to its Nth degree limits. In the end, I think most postmodernism is the denial of such a truth. Even when it starts from a place seeking it truth, the inconsistent resulting claim there is no truth.
WED 10:47 AM
I wish you had 20 pages.
WED 10:48 AM
The fragmentation argument is good, and I wish you had more space for it.
WED 10:48 AM
I'm working with what I got, hahahaha. I want to go deeper into detail, but I can't...
WED 10:48 AM
I think the story has a clear metanarrative.
WED 10:50 AM
I think the goal is to cut through illusion to get to what is real. The story is optimistic about there being a truth to matter. Those 4th wall breaks are wake up calls.
WED 10:51 AM
It's saying we swim in a sea of illusions, but there is something to know and experience which isn't mere illusion.
WED 10:51 AM
It doesn't celebrate postmodernism, it condemns it.
WED 10:52 AM
(I think you'll get a top score with the paper as you've got here, btw. It's good work. I'm still going to argue against some of the positions because it matters ;P.)
WED 10:53 AM
You can shrink your block quotes for more space if you need, btw.
WED 10:54 AM
I'll after Fight Club is about using violence wisely, but I'm not convinced the only way out is through the development of a personal army.
WED 10:56 AM
Just a heads up: postmodernism and Marxism can and should be decoupled.
WED 10:57 AM
To be against the commodification of our lives is to deny that postmodernism is justified.
WED 10:59 AM
That's the difficult part of this work. It uses postmodern techniques to explain what's wrong with postmodernism. Postmodernism used modernism to explain what was wrong with modernism too.
WED 11:01 AM
Yeah it's super ironic, because it really dismantles itself and undermines ALL of its points.
WED 11:02 AM
Which oddly enough, is another theme of postmodernism lmao
WED 11:02 AM
Do you think there is no message that comes out of the story?
WED 11:02 AM
I don't think it undermines everything.
WED 11:02 AM
Do you think any metanarrative survives the work? Or does it really reduce itself and everything else into absurdity?
WED 11:04 AM
Capitalism alienates us from ourselves without justification; it uses us as mere means. There is no consent to the process. //Fight Club//, even as an army, does not share those characteristics so clearly. I think those men find far more purpose and meaning in their lives, especially through the denial of at least some aspects of individualism.
WED 11:09 AM
I'll write up some responses for you. These are interesting points to meditate on. Part of the issue is the lack of space to properly convey everything, but I'm also not arguing that Fight Club is supportive of post modernism as a whole, merely that they are themes that make an appearence.
WED 11:13 AM
Oh man, I know. It's ridiculously unfair to try to solve this problem in 5 pages. Lol!
WED 11:13 AM
Your draft is solid. It's good work.
WED 11:13 AM
Thanks! It sounds like I need to tweak it more and clarify my stance a bit. x)
WED 11:14 AM
I'm passionate about the subject, so I want to talk about it even beyond the scope of what is going to get you an A. I want the truth, not just an A. At this point, I'm not convinced the grade is what matters here (since I'm convinced you have the A already).
WED 11:15 AM
I hope it's the kind of paper that sticks with you for a few years.
WED 11:15 AM
Me too. I really enjoyed revisiting the movie and thinking about these concepts.
WED 11:19 AM
Thank you for trusting me to think about it with you. It's always a pleasure to reason with you about what matters.
WED 11:19 AM
Of course! I know how much these schools of thought mean to you, so I know you'll be raw with me. :D
WED 11:21 AM
Looking through your rapid fire thoughts: TL:DR I'm not really arguing in favor of Fight Club being a movie about Postmodernism, just that it highlights themes in a way that alludes to the ideology. I could do a whole paper on the schizophrenia alone, and I really wish I could go more into detail. xD Yes, the movie is totally a metanarrative that makes fun of metanarratives with it's fourth wall breaks. I wish I could talk more about consumerism, but the big point I was trying to make is that capitalism and consumerism reduces the individual to a mindless, nameless drone, which Tyler also does with the Fight Club in the last act of the movie.
WED 11:31 AM
If I had my way, I'd wanna point out the irony of it all, but I'm afraid it would undermine the whole essay.
WED 11:31 AM
Fuck I want 20 pages!
WED 11:32 AM
lol
WED 11:33 AM
I do think what I have is good, but it could be GREAT
WED 11:33 AM
Write the 20 pages
WED 11:33 AM
I can't. xD
WED 11:33 AM
No time, eh? I hear ya.
WED 11:33 AM
That, and my professor would likely be annoyed lmao
WED 11:34 AM
It will crystallize better for you that way, but you only have so much time in the day. I get that.
WED 11:34 AM
Well, don't turn in the 20-pages. You can squeeze a 10 page paper into 5 with some tricks, but you can also cull 20-pages down to 10 with careful work.
WED 11:34 AM
I also had to cut Marla entirely, which hurt. Haha
WED 11:35 AM
I see that, lol.
WED 11:35 AM
But she isn't as important as giving Tyler a fair shake
WED 11:35 AM
Oh, and, to be clear: I'm arguing against your big point.
WED 11:35 AM
Individualism?
WED 11:35 AM
That capitalism and //Fight Club// conceptually must reduce individuals to mindless drones.
WED 11:36 AM
So the whole idea of capitalism is that it takes advantage of the lower working class, turning them into a number on paper, doing a job they must do in order to survive with the hope of giving their lives greater meaning in the long run.
WED 11:38 AM
Not exactly.
WED 11:38 AM
Tyler's army loses their names, takes advantage of people like Ed Norton, weaponizes their aggression to do what Tyler wants, with the hope of giving their lives greater purpose in the long run
WED 11:38 AM
Capitalism does take advantage of lower working class people, and it's by alienating people from their labor (labor is an extension of our identity). Capitalism is a form of slavery.
WED 11:39 AM
Capitalists only care about the appearance of meaning in people's lives (even if only illusions) insofar as it is necessary or more economical for exploiting others.
WED 11:40 AM
Oof. they're both exploitation too. That's a really good point.
WED 11:41 AM
They don't have to become a "number on paper" in capitalism, but you are commodified to the point that it doesn't matter if you have a name or not.
WED 11:41 AM
Right, so the only thing that matters is being able to do the job you're required to do.
WED 11:42 AM
People can be interchanged as long as they can do the job
WED 11:42 AM
Aye, that is true.
WED 11:42 AM
WAIT
WED 11:42 AM
That's another ironic twist
WED 11:42 AM
Tyler wants to restore individuality by erasing everyone's debt, but if they're all his thralls, then they are already equal in that regard.
WED 11:43 AM
Equal and nameless
WED 11:43 AM
I think you are going to have to do more work to show how Tyler's Army is taking advantage of people.
WED 11:43 AM
I would probably start arguing that it is cultic.
WED 11:44 AM
It seems like those who join //Fight Club// have far more choice in the matter. They also at least appear to have more purpose and meaning. There is a difference between choosing to live namelessly and being forced to live namelessly.
WED 11:45 AM
I see collectivism in //Fight Club//
WED 11:46 AM
Naming is a hard problem. I think that our behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and desires help form descriptive names of who we are (though I do not claim this is complete).
WED 11:47 AM
Some of the best people I've ever met chose to live in a way that they were functionally nameless. They still chose to be saints even when it meant losing out on uniqueness or recognition.
WED 11:49 AM
What made them who they were was the ability to locate themselves in the world, to have an actual purpose which they pursued and identified with/as.
WED 11:50 AM
Destroying capitalism was meaningful. Being an insurance claims adjuster was not.
WED 11:53 AM
I see far more validity and meaning in the lives of those who chose to participate in //Fight Club//, even when it came with sacrificial costs. That said, I'm also not claiming the club was excellent or the most effective means by any stretch.
WED 11:53 AM
I'm not willing to reduce //Fight Club// and Capitalism down to the same meaningless postmodern object here.
WED 11:54 AM
Sorry in class, I'll get to this soon!

Loved it.

I don't watch much youtubes, but this is on topic and about gaming too.
WED 12:35 PM
Ewww Fortnite
WED 2:43 PM
hahaha
WED 2:43 PM
Also, I think I worded my claim badly. I'm not claiming that they are 100% the same, but they share the same line of thinking and similar estranged beats.
WED 2:44 PM
Can I bug you about a book? I bought it, and it'll be here Friday, but I could use it tonight/ tomorrow, hahaha.
