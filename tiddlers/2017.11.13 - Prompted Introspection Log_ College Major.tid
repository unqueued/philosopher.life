title: 2017.11.13 - Prompted Introspection Log: College Major

//I dedicate this page to my first History and Philosophy teachers. I am forever in your debt.//

!! What was your major in college? How did you choose it?

Initially, I was going into Business Administration because I didn't want to be poor. I really hated not having money growing up. Then I took my first philosophy class. The world started coming alive, monsters came out of the depths, the existential trinkets around me stirred. That which didn't make sense started to make sense. There were official terms for concepts and issues I had struggled and dealt with my whole life. My extreme religious heritage all of the sudden didn't seem so insane at all. There were reasons for reasons for reasons, and so on, for my existential anxiety. It was beautiful to see.

When I transferred to Berea, I believed I was going to be an economics and philosophy double-major. While I enjoyed my economics classes, I felt what we learned was evil. The more I learned about the world of commerce, the less I felt inclined towards it (icky). Some of my best history classes were taught by people who really appreciated philosophy, and this solidified it for me. Philosophy was my drug of choice.

Additionally, while I was always a stand-out student, I was a shark in philosophy (official meme terminology is: philosoraptor). I was very opinionated, and I loved a wide variety of topics. I realized that philosophy was the fundamental academic discipline. Coming to appreciate the shoulders of giants I stood upon was very satisfying.

I started college fairly young. I graduated at 19. I clearly didn't know much of anything about the world (and perhaps, to a large extent, still don't). I had shit for guidance. Philosophy was a way to make sense of my parents and religious upbringing. It took a very long time to eventually release me of both. Eventually, I went through 6 years of graduate school in philosophy, since it was the only place that ever gave me answers. Charity's a bitch sometimes, eh?

I was baptized by fire. Now, I take my redpills, jumping from reality-map vortex to vortex. I have hope.
