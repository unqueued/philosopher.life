!! Self-found Twinked Solo Speedrun

I intend to make at least 50 speedruns given self-found twink gear. I don't need to do these runs right this minute though, so I'm going to plan for it. This is exciting to me because I adore creating perfect twinks. Twinking is fun.

My goal is to not run multiple accounts or gamestates. I'm trying to play this single player, for realsies. Otherwise, what's to stop me from multiboxing? Why not macros or bots? Necromancers would enable me to control most screens without any difficulty. I'm trying to play it the hard way. So, given that I have access to the vast majority of the gear in the game, what the best solo twink speedrunner? 

The correct answer is either: Sorceress or Assassin. Note the difference between rushing the Socketquest for just Normal and going all the way to Hell mode HF run. The answers to each may differ. 

Untwinked, Assassin is the obvious choice to me for the normal Socketquest. It's probably why I went Assassin as my first character, since farming Nightmare Baal is the primary marker from the Early to the Midgame. He actually drops a majority of items in the game, including some end game items. Sorc's teleport can simply never be discounted. Assassin is faster for the first 10-15 levels, sure. But, teleport (which the Assassin has a conditional version of) is very powerful. Twinked, which I get to do here, it's not so obvious. 

The answer becomes clearer to me when I take both twinking and playing through Hell mode into account. The sorc has an easier time wearing her end game gear, and Nightmare is instagibbed with her TP and one-shotting. Neither love the immunities in hell mode, but the sorc's Orballer build is effective enough to deal with single immunities. The sorc is the way to go through Hell.

I'm hunting for odd items that wouldn't normally be important, but happen to be the perfect twink items for 1.13 (I don't have access to Ravenclaw 1.09, etc.). I will build a full twink set for all levels of the sorc, and I will also make at least a partial leveling set for an A2 Merc. 

I believe the goal is to go pure caster as early as possible. Unfortunately, I cleared out my very large collection of twink charms. I rashly assumed I wouldn't want to make more characters (part of me knew better). Elemental one-shotting for the first 30 levels is very nice. Alas, I'm kind of sad that I didn't think about this from the beginning. I've probably farmed and gambled thousands of rare jewelry that might fit this perfectly. There are lots of little things that I would have kept.

I need +Str charms for Sigon's Guard. Unfortunately, I don't have tons of Envy jewels. I may want to abuse sets, but frankly, it seems better to just go pure caster. Basically, I'll stock up on Stamina potions, and push as hard as I can into progress (I don't care about quests or levels), melee when I must, and cast when I can.

I'm not looking for perfect gear, but damn near it. Technically, there are steps in between these, but I'm fine with good enough.
