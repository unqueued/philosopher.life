[1:33 PM] robotic_scarab: not a problem! I'm not worried about instant replies :)
[1:33 PM] h0p3: :smiley:
[1:33 PM] h0p3: I adore that.
[1:33 PM] h0p3: Hard to break myself of the habit.
[1:35 PM] robotic_scarab: yeah, it's a tough one. I felt so much anxiety during high school and college around waiting for replies to texts and messages and such
[1:39 PM] robotic_scarab: mm, and for me discord is mostly a matter of comfort...it's where I talk to a few other people & I always have it open + web app. not that that is a good justification!
[1:40 PM] robotic_scarab: i wish the signal desktop app wasn't as slow for me as it is...it crawls loading up which makes me not want to open it at all
[1:43 PM] h0p3: Makes sense to me. Plus, Discord has a lot of nice features. I'm hard-pressed to name a more feature-complete chat client.
[1:45 PM] robotic_scarab: that's true - I use the emoji reactions a lot in some contexts
[1:45 PM] robotic_scarab: I appreciate the ease of voice chat and screen sharing too
