title: 2020.02.06 - Prompted Introspection: Talking About Problems

!! When you have a problem who do you talk to? Why?

It depends on the problem and the circumstances. I talk because I'm trying to solve the problem or adjust my feelings/reasons about it. I talk to myself more than anyone else. My wife next, my offspring after that, and so forth. Some problems are specialized though, and I seek an authority to help point me in the right direction or more.

Even [[Prompted Introspection]]s are problems, and I sometimes speak to specialized interlocutors for various purposes in that log as well.
