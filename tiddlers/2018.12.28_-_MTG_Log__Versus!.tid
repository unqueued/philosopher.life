//Going back to pure Goblins mirror for a bit. I made the initial construction dialectic point.//

Daughter:

Mull: mountain, waste, 2x matron, trash, SS. Possibly liveable (no whammies, no whammies, no whammies). Mountain, pass. She mountain, vials. I waste, lackey. She incs. I mountain, SS. She wastes my waste (that BITCH! :P) and drops another vial. Oh, god. Huzzah, topdeck vial, play, and pass. She reaches critical mass before me; chieftain and whirler, shoot her in the face, she swings. I ramp and pass. She drops port, krenko, lackey, activate, swing for the lethal. GG!

Daughter:

Mull 7 lander into this hot garbage: 2x mountain, caverns, waste, matron, leader. That is still better than the average 5, imho. Mountain, pass. Mirror. Mirror (on the wall). She caverns, crater. I waste her caverns, lackey. She drops port. Upkeep port, drop a lackey. She drops port. Upkeep ports me, matron->krenko, swing with both lackeys UNBLOCKED, I put Crafter and Krenko into play. She wastes my cavern. Upkeep ports me, I crafter her crater (NO RESPONSE), Krenko too early (doh), lackey->leader->inc, pass. She drops waste. Upkeep, she only uses on port(?, inc?), swing for 8 (holding krenko and crafter back), GG.

Daughter:

Keep: 2 mountain, waste, lackey, vial, leader, matron. She goes mountain, lackey. I mirror (she says, "thanks for that" nonchalantly). She swings, I block, no land drop (OUCH!). I mountain, vial. I matron->krenko. She discards down a matron (lulz). I drop Krenko, swing for 1. She drops port, inc->matron (I vial in instigator ;P). Waste her port, swing with instigator->leader->(trash, chief)->trash, vial chief, crafter(leader), pass. She plays vial, EoT I Krenko and crafter. Drop whirler and SS, style and showboat until she concedes.

Son:

Mountain, port, vial, 2x chief, matron, kiki. He drops port, pass. I drop my topped lackey. He drops caverns (no inc for him), pass. I lackey (he asks if he can inc), I lackey->chief, vial. He matrons->chieftain. I vial->lackey, inc->matron, swing->(SGC, Kiki). He incs kiki, I clone SGC in response. I matron->krenko, swing->(krenko, chief). He Krenkos, I activate, state-based sac. GG.

Son:

He mulls, so I keep this: mountain, port, caverns, inc, sting, leader, crafter. He drops skirk. I mountain. He drivers. He sacs skirk, chief, NO SWING?, I inc his chief. I waste his waste, sting his driver. He mountains, driver. I chief. He drops 2x vials. I leader->(matron, whirler). Swing with all, pass. He chiefs, no swing. I crafter(leader)->chief, matron->kiki, swing with chief. He craters->matron. I play vial, kiki, kiki->crafter, shoot driver before saccing, waste his port, swing. He incs kiki, EoT->crafter him in the face. I leader->(krenko, driver), driver, swing for lethal.

Talked about tilt (ty [[Sphygmus]]). Yay for lectures! =)
