There are few institutions I hold in such high regard.

Would you be willing to move to accommodate this position?
MON 10:36 AM
Yes. I don't even make a living wage.
MON 10:45 AM
I would choose to be homeless to take that position. It's almost my dream job.
MON 10:45 AM
What do they pay for this position? I didn’t see anything at a glance.
MON 10:45 AM
No idea.
MON 10:45 AM
Lol. It sounds like it’s right up your alley!
