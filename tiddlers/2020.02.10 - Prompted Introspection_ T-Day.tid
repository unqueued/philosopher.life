title: 2020.02.10 - Prompted Introspection: T-Day

!! Which holiday has the most meaning for you-Canada Day, Thanksgiving, Valentines Dayâ€“and why?

//Meaning for me// determined by what standard? Presumably, to the extent it is subjectively determined by me, yeah? Alright.

Thanksgiving. I've never observed Canada Day, and I don't know anything about it. I'd like to celebrate the ancient sort of VDay (there's just not enough sex in the world), but it's never been terribly relevant to my life. I generally get to spend a day with people I [[love]] and like on Thanksgiving, and we get to eat. This one is a no-brainer for me.
