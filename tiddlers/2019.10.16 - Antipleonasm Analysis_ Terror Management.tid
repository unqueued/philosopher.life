title: 2019.10.16 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Terror Management

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
"Terror Management suggests that human nature is actually wired towards self-deception: In order to avoid facing terrifying concepts like death, most of us live in a state of self-delusion." I very early on in life recognized this as a primary principle of human psychology. As soon as we begin to understand the concept of death, we unconsciously develop this as our primary defense mechanism. It's what all religious and spiritual belief systems are founded on.
<<<

It's a terrifying fact that our amygdalas override the rest of us more than we'd like to admit. The brain is trying to protect itself. Political discussions, for example, are going to light-up them existential-threat networks in us like a Christmas Tree.<<ref "e">> Truly, we are cornered animals. Of course, death is a crucial topic, and it's something we all need to wrestle with. Someone thinking about living enough is likely going to think about dying too.

Religious or spiritual beliefs systems, however, are not conceptually bound to believers having access to the concept of one's own death (though decay, entropy, or destruction of instantiations of [[The Beautiful]] or [[The Right]], yes). I'm convinced I've met children who had non-trivial religious belief systems who have never encountered the notion of death (a profound disservice to them). It seems reasonable to imagine, for example, a civilization living in an experience machine in which no deaths ever occurred, but people still develop religious beliefs. The claim might be some empirical one about actual religious and spiritual beliefs in our world, but it still steps over the bounds of justification. Thinking about death often spurs existential reasoning. [[Awe]] can be had without thoughts of death (even if there is an element of egodeath in it), but it may require terror and suffering.

Clearly, most people I've met take up religious beliefs, like any other sort of beliefs, from psychologically egoistic motivations (even if it appears their molecular beliefs aren't egoistic at face value). Death is fucking scary, no doubt. Shielding ourselves from feeling bad is what many people consider 'healthy', and, of course, inspecting that too closely also makes us feel bad, so it's unhealthy to think about thinking about it as well. Self-deception is often part of happiness, and few kinds of optimism I've encountered are justified (and I say this as a delusional madman, ofc).<<ref "d">> 

Let's see, likely intertwined ingredients for religious belief include: self and [[other]] (including at least prereflective cogito and reflection), change, and perception of [[salience]] (you know, all that Dasein junk). No problem, it's probably just some useless process theology bullshit. Just ignore it: you got this, bro. You've clearly got a solid primary defense mechanism.

<<footnotes "d" "If you aren't at least mildly depressed, you either don't give a shit about people everywhere or you've deluded yourself (which is often in virtue of not giving a shit about people everywhere). This isn't to say you can't be the sort who also finds [[beauty]] and meaning even in suffering, and I'm not implying you must be melancholic at all times, and so forth.">>
