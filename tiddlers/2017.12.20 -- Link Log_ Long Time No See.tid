*** The threat is not contained.

* Think About It
** I agree with much of what he says. Except, it is clear to me that some ideas are simply better than others. I'm a culturalist too. Some memetic networks really are better, and not simply because they are merely more addictive, but addictive in the right way, for the right reasons, and so on and so forth.

* Fishy

*** Why? This is a serious turn. Is it a competitive advantage thing? Is it even more sinister?

*** I point to TheATL often. This is an odd piece. It sounds even a bit accelerationist.

*** I find this article's treatment to be fishy. You can accuse me anytime, so feel free. I am not convinced this is a standard cognitive bias though. I think it is all too often practical and correct to admit zero-sum games play majors roles in large swathes of our lives. Obviously, one can be biased in this direction. However, I think people also make the mistake of being "biased" in other direction as well. It's interesting, to say the least. I will think more about it.

** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_choice
*** An interesting idea. Seems far too abuseable. I would accept this from the bottom up. It reminds me of Lessig's approach to campaign finance reform. The goal, then, is to allow perhaps the first $10k to be distributed as the taxpayer sees fit. That said, closing the loopholes for abuse would itself likely solve the problem. Need to think more.
