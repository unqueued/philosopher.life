title: 2019.11.22 - Prompted Introspection: Safesex

!! What makes you feel safe?

Thinking about [[2018.04.06 - Prompted Introspection Log: Feeling Safe]], I believe that was part of the tipping point of creating [[dok]]. Yeah, yeah, that answer is correct. Sucking the oxygen right out of it.

Alright, for the feelings now: sex.<<ref "d">> Laying naked (preferably when it is cold enough to have heavy blankets for le autists), shitting the breeze, usually a minor discussion about economics or cats, ticklish nipples, I'm going to say something disgusting,<<ref "l">> retributive elbow, giggles, sandwiches are completed, skin contact, cognition lost, where the fuck else would I want to be except right here? Lol. Everything else fades. It's just us in this space. I'm not me; we're us. We accidentally forgot the world.
