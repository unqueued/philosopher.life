*** Not convinced by the "more attached not less" at all. I am convinced mobility is dying.

*** I'm not worried about the legal positivists. Positivism, in its various philosophical incarnations, open a hole they can't close; it destroys itself. Realism is hard work, folks; we can't get lazy. I think legal conventions are social conventions of some [[dok]]. Legal positivism is correct that "valid" government given conceptual analysis alone requires we say Nazi Germany had a "valid government" even if not a morally justified one. But, that rabbithole opens us to far more attacks than we'd ever have dreamed, imho. Everyone agrees that governments, by definition, are about law construction, enforcement, and adjudication, and usually that it's coercive, but validity as moral and epistemic justification beyond that, they cannot (not even the logicial positivists).

*** I'm honestly truly awful at this. I never fucking know what's going on locally (I'd say take to the bank, but even my bank has no branch in the area). I applaud those who do care for the local while still giving a shit about the cosmopolitan; it's wildly harder than it looks.

*** If you can't say "the workers must own the means of production" with sincerity, I don't trust you. You better mean your decentralization game.

*** You will need to pay attention to linguistics and cultural communication sciences, structures, and oddities that others do not in order to socially code with/against other humans. You will need to be cognitive (developing the affecting) about areas that others are naturally affective about.
