!! Castle Rock: S01E01

Love the frozen desert thing.

Pangborn. Last day. Her body language feels odd to me.

Stephen King show. Shawshank. Meh.

Jumpscare.

Do I like Zawinski? Prison guards are not like this, ofc.

I <3 the lawyer. I don't think those people exist, but I love this fiction.

First memory, wtf is happening on that lake?

Resurrection.

Deaver, Castle Rock namedrop.

What. The. Fuck. I hate spooky anything. I'm watchin', god damnit.

Yes, I am going to continue watching. I'm almost hooked. =)

!! Castle Rock: S01E02

Went to Geometry class with a soccer player named Deaver. Complete asshole. Thus, I will irrationally impart my feelings towards that debacle here.

Every inch is stained with someone's sin

I feel lost, but idiotically so.

Acts 16:33-34 New Living Translation (NLT)

33 Even at that hour of the night, the jailer cared for them and washed their wounds. Then he and everyone in his household were immediately baptized. 34 He brought them into his house and set a meal before them, and he and his entire household rejoiced because they all believed in God."

He knew the kid was locked up. That's messed up.

Reappearing cake joke is relaxing.

...I'm done writing about the show. Watching it extremely casually with my wife now. I don't care for it enough to write about it.

!! Castle Rock: S01E07

This is the episode my brother has hyped, and I can see why. It is a powerful episode! My wife and I both felt it was the highlight of the show thus far, being moving and clear horror.

As someone feeling major psychological distress, I felt quite connected. The anchoring is outstanding.
