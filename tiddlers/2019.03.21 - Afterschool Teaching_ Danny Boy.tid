title: 2019.03.21 - Afterschool Teaching: Danny Boy

Daniel wasn't able to come today. =( I think I'll see him next week. I'm going to miss him. I hope to see him in the Fall, but I doubt I will.

Whitney and I talked about books. She's sorting through what we have. We talked about 6HM and 7Cm; she adores these students as well. It seems like they have fallen through the cracks. I'm not sure how best to serve them, but I brought the Satrapi's Persepolis graphic novel (my wife reminded me this was a banned book...I could lose my job for this one) for C6HM and a book about mathematical discoveries for 7Cm. They might not care, and that's okay.

I hunted 5th graders down in the hallways since the normal announcement didn't go down. 5NP2 was straight up conversational with me. Have I graduated from the father figure he fucking hates to a friend? For a few minutes I did.

I'm getting better at helping new students join us. Good.

I praised 5CM for how hard he has been trying. I hope he keeps it up.

Some of the 8th graders had their phones out in the cafeteria (omg, that is a thoughtcrime, we need to arrest them). I've been telling them how to wear their headphones and use their phones out in the open without looking like the are violating the rules (6CM especially appreciates it: she knows I'm looking out for her). One of my rambunctious students, 8TA, was in trouble and suspended because he refused to hand over his phone (I've taken his and placed it on the desk in front of him, but he has to do his homework). The 8th graders agreed with him, and they said the teacher who wanted his phone would have forced him to unlock it so she could go through his shit. We talked about that, and I suggested they  use multiple accounts so they can unlock and hand the teacher a perfectly benign plausible deniability account. I also suggested just flat out hiding their apps/data and using killswitches. I cannot protect them from everything, but I need them to start thinking more effectively about defeating unjustified variants of authority.

Matt called Whitney up. He has a short story he made copies of, and he wanted us to find them for him. I have no idea why, but that's fine with me. He's probably taking most of next week off too. He's busy, no doubt.

I took the older kids again. I asked Whitney to send me any kids she wants me to handle. 7Cm read through the mathematics history book, and we talked about math for a bit. He still wants to work on algebra. He's being practical. 

8Gf took my Landscape of History book, and she wants to continue reading it. She is also looking for a device for learning to program. We talked about qualia and experience.

6HM has the right to take my book home with her. It's what I would want for my own child stuck in this prison. I hope it will be a moving experience for her. The star of the book is a smart girl caught between worlds. I hope it serves her well. It is so weird to have to trust a kid so much. If her parents hate muslims (and they very likely do), and they find out, I'm toast. There are discussions of sex, drugs, and existentialism in that book. It's amazing. I'm holding my breath: it's a risk worth taking. Like a virus, I must awaken minds. I'll have to start teaching basic Marxist theory soon.

I heard a rumor from the kids that the library is now off limits. This does sound Delplike. I went straight to him to ask if I could use the library. He had to pause to think about the fact that I don't care for his use of deception, and then he tried to word it carefully to me. We can use the Library, he just wanted to wield it as a behavioral control device.

I am, of course, profoundly in favor of a very particular range of thinking and behavior, and I think I even have radical permissions to implement my obligations to push for that range in many contexts. I'm not convinced Delp is playing the game for anything beyond mere authoritarian control though.

Later in the day, Delp explained he would be providing provisional access to the computer lab again. We talked about whitelisting, and he claimed Dorsey knew what he was doing (omg...the incompetence is staggering). I think the library discussion has him rethinking the computer lab. 

The library was wonderful, as usual. The girls played with gak, then they played pretend games using the smart and whiteboards. We did some arithmetic as they taught class. The girls like to quiz me on mental math problems and use calculators to check; I am apparently the fact dispute settler too. I helped 7Mf with her social studies. It was plug and play fact-finding. There was nothing else relevant in the process besides learning how to find information (which is not nothing). 6CM seems even more off to me today; she seemed distressed. I talked to her about it, but she dismissed me (understandably, I have that kind of face). 

Why do so few boys come to the library? Normal gender conditioning?

The janitors and I didn't have much to talk about. We are both waiting for the weekend.
