Only if it were free and you didn't want it. Otherwise, don't bother. Save money. Keep the book. It was given to us for free as well.

We are moving in July there’s no doubt about it-
Tue 5:54pm
It's interesting how they attempt to gamify, market to, and commodify further their tenants.
Tue 6:12pm
I'm glad you are all moving.
Tue 6:15pm
Not even I’m more concerned that they are doing this in a time when people are struggling to figure out how to afford everything
