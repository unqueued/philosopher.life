title: 2017.06.02 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.06.01 - Link Log]]
** I have a backlog in my browser. That's fine though. I was very busy yesterday.
* [[2017.06.01 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** Sometimes introspection doesn't seem to immediately benefit me, but there is a get to know me effect. Those records are worth keeping.
* [[ARAM: Velkoz]]
** I can't help it: Rod of Ages seems like the best first item on almost all AP champs in ARAM.
* [[2017.06.01 - Wiki Review Log]]
** I worry that talking about ARAM and MTG makes it so I don't talk about it in their respective pages. I don't know though. We'll see. It could be digesting here first.
* [[2017.06.01 - Pipefitting Log]]
** I think it was the kick over the edge to help me realize I just want to get a job at this point. I'm glad it happened.
* [[ARAM: Annie]]
** And, yet, I suck at Annie.
* [[ARAM: Swain]]
** I wonder what else I should consider putting in these pages.
* [[ARAM: Sona]]
** Edited.
* [[2017.05 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** It looks much prettier. I'm glad I'm taking the time to make it look decent.
* [[2017.05 - Diet Log]]
** I should consider weighing myself at this point. I'm was at 208 pounds at my brother's house. I should be losing weight still. Although, it has slowed down considerably.
* [[2017.05 - Link Log]]
** Edited.
* [[2017.05 - Wiki Review Log]]
** Heartbeat is correct. I need to work on my {Focus} page. It has to be updated each month. The Wiki Review Log only gives me partial perspective. Perhaps I should wait until Sunday to do this part. I don't know.
* [[2017.05 - Pipefitting Log]]
** It feels weird to congratulate yourself. It's uncouth. But, I think it is fitting here, and I will learn not to be ashamed of it.
* [[2017.05 - DCK Meditation]]
** k0sh3k got me thinking that I should have a memoir kind of log. In a sense, these aren't logs, but they are something I should do weekly or maybe even daily. I need to record the past. I want to put it together.
* [[2017.05 - k0sh3k's Wiki Log]]
** We will see if these logs continue to be worthwhile in themselves. They are obviously instrumental in accountability mechanisms for myself, in forcing myself to do the tasks I need to do.
* [[2017.05 - 1uxb0x's Wiki Log]]
** I desperately hope to help my son here. This is hard for him, and he need this badly.
* [[2017.05 - j3d1h's Wiki Log]]
** I hope to see more technical work, art, and more personal work on her wiki. She needs to embrace the tool.
* [[2017.05 - Family Log]]
** Btw, I was wrong about the compliment section initially. I'm really glad we stuck with it. It's one of my favorite parts of the week.
* [[2017.05 - Homeschooling Log]]
** Bringing order to the chaos. It happens bit by bit.
* [[2017.05 - h0p3's Log]]
** I've not written here recently. I'm not sure what that means.
* [[2017.06.01 - Diet Log]]
** I've not been holding back.
* [[2017.06.01 - Philosophy Probe Log]]
** I'll get used to having such unsatisfactory answers eventually, right?
* [[Philosophy Probe Log]]
** I am worried that I won't be able to keep up this log. It is a serious amount of work.
