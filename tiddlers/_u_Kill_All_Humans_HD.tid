Love your username. I'm a misanthropic autist too. I legitimately don't want to hate people, but I've found the vast majority of people suck. I know that feeling of alienation.

From the sounds of it, you are in the middle of hell. I've not experienced your hell, but I've certainly been on the edge of taking my life several times. I have no idea if I can be of any use to you, but I'd like to be your friend. Let's be aliens together.

Yeah, you don't know me. We're strangers in the desert, nomad. I'm just some insane person contacting you out of the blue. I understand I must earn your trust. I'll let you see who I am (I play with my cards face-up on the table) before you decide to engage with me:

If you need someone to talk to, I'm here. Please read the {Contact} section carefully. Protonmail is a safe bet; you will need to be thoughtful about what metadata you reveal to me.

I've seen that you don't look at your messages. Hopefully you see this anyways.
