!! Audit:

* Link heavy month! 
* Comments clump in //Think About It// and //Fishy//, which is normal.
* //Vidya// is a fine addition. Pile on the garbage. I might as well pick some out. 
* As usual, I watch the world burn. It is incredibly painful.
* It's a good thing I've already done a first pass before I move onto my second; it makes it easier on drunk me.
* These small notes reminds me of [[Wiki Review]]. I'm writing to myself almost entirely.
* It sucks to see how poorly I fit into the map.
* It feels like there's a marked decline in computing content. [[Computer Musings]] and [[Wiki Audit]] have pretty much dropped off the map too.
* 90% hate machine. I was lucky to experience [[awe]] though. Still reading. It was interesting to see [[kicks]] respond almost instantly, and I'm still mulling his response around.
* I have had some links sitting in my browser for almost half a year now. Ugh. That is terrible.
* Even though I have almost nothing to say, this log consumes ridiculous amounts of time. It's hard work, but I'm glad I do it.
