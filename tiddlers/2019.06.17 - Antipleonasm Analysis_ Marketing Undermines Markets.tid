title: 2019.06.17 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Marketing Undermines Markets

!! Respond to the following gem:

...evidence-based approach, the U.S. negotiators argued, is interference with free markets, because corporations must have the right to deceive. [...] The claim itself is kind of amusing, I mean, even if you believe the free market rhetoric for a moment. The main purpose of advertising is to undermine markets. If you go to graduate school and you take a course in economics, you learn that markets are systems in which informed consumers make rational choices. That's what's so wonderful about it. But that's the last thing that the state corporate system wants. It is spending huge sums to prevent that, which brings us back to the viability of American democracy. For many years, elections here, election campaigns, have been run by the public relations industry and each time it's with increasing sophistication. And quite naturally, the industry uses the same technique to sell candidates that it uses to sell toothpaste or lifestyle drugs. The point is to undermine markets by projecting imagery to delude and suppressing information, and similarly, to undermine democracy by the same method, projecting imagery to delude and suppressing information. The candidates are trained, carefully trained, to project a certain image. Intellectuals like to make fun of George Bush's use of phrases like “misunderestimate,” and so on, but my strong suspicion is that he's trained to do that. He's carefully trained to efface the fact that he's a spoiled frat boy from Yale, and to look like a Texas roughneck kind of ordinary guy just like you, just waiting to get back to the ranch that they created for him...

I will grant that individuals have the political (though not necessarily moral) right to deceive those in authority or to close the gap in [[power]] differentials. I can provide no justifying argument for why corporate bodies of any size have such a right over individuals. Further, I agree: the primary purpose of //marketing// is to undermine markets. It's a form of [[Memetic Warfare]], and those who are honest will get crushed by those who aren't. Perhaps more [[salient]]ly, as [[Saint Marx]] points out, free markets undermine themselves; this is simply one method.

The "rational agent" is whatever psychological model enables economists (but actually the elite) to maintain their convenient faith in capitalism. Even Economics as a discipline is a form of marketing.

The subversion of the election process is extremely dangerous. It continues to get worse. I'm all in favor of giving individuals a voice, campaign finance reform, and educating people to generally not trust those who have money. Most of the poor don't even have time to participate, and that's on purpose. As to candidate training, most people think I'm a conspiracy theorist on the topic, or they don't think it's [[as bad as I say it is|2019.04.15 - L: Curation]]. [[Saint Chomsky]] nailed Bush. It's yet another "deplorables" idpol consideration which allows Overton [[pleft]] to ad hominem without recognizing the reality and a false virtue signal to the [[pright]].
