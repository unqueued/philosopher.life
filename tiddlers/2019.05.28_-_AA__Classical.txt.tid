How's it going?
TUE 7:09 PM
Itâ€™s going well â€”got caught up and am working ahead now. I would really like the feeling in my face to come back though (dentist)
TUE 7:11 PM
How are you?
TUE 7:11 PM
Ah, you saw the butcher. Hopefully not too many puddles of drool, lol.
TUE 7:12 PM
I'm doing fine.
TUE 7:12 PM
Chugging along.
TUE 7:12 PM
The school I teach at is looking at changing to more of a classical approachâ€”greek, latin, logic, rhetoric...I have not taught any of those. What do you think?
TUE 7:17 PM
Why do you think they want to change? How many of the other teachers would feel comfortable with it?
TUE 7:20 PM
I have no doubt you would be a good logic teacher, and I would not be surprised to find you as a natural with latin given your science background.
TUE 7:20 PM
Rhetoric is a swear word to me, but I agree everyone must learn it.
TUE 7:21 PM
I took some Latin, and I thought it was useful for reasoning about English. I'm terrible with grammar though.
TUE 7:22 PM
I donâ€™t know that they will pull me from math but logic does sound fun. I know you have taught it on a  college level. Is there a curriculum you preferred?
TUE 7:22 PM
By 8th grade, most of our kids have had grammar beaten into them (ok not beaten but ...itâ€™s just repeating for 9th-12th)
TUE 7:23 PM
It depends on the students. Most logic courses for those age groups are not going to be symbolic. I'm a huge fan of symbolic logic though. This is by far the best book I've ever used on the topic: https://www.amazon.com/Language-Proof-Logic-David-Barker-Plummer/dp/1575866323
TUE 7:24 PM
They would like to increase critical thinking and reasoning ability
TUE 7:24 PM
They have studied the schools around that are doing well and claim the classical schools are doing the best...looking specifically at Highland Latin
TUE 7:25 PM
I shall have to look at that
TUE 7:25 PM
It will be much stronger preparation for mathematics, linguistics, computer science, and philosophy than what I've seen for high schoolers, but it's not easy (still doable; [[j3d1h]] passed my class at 7, and [[1uxb0x]] at 9). There's a lot of content to cover.
TUE 7:25 PM
It requires a computer to do the homework, and that is a good thing in this case.
TUE 7:26 PM
Yeah but I figured I would ask because I know you would be the expert ðŸ¥°
TUE 7:27 PM
Computers would not be a problem
TUE 7:27 PM
Your kids are brighter than the average high schooler :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
TUE 7:27 PM
They might be. We will see! They at least shamed the college students to try harder (hilarious watching little kids asking and answering questions in class). Gonna be focusing on socializing, rhetoric, and human psychology more, I hope.
TUE 7:29 PM
All good things
TUE 7:29 PM
I'm not convinced Greek and Latin are ridiculously important. There are some concepts that are easier to point to with the original words. Those key terms for a discipline are worth learning, but that's because the concepts are worth learning. This is what I've been working on the past week for the kiddos: https://philosopher.life/#Greek%20%26%20Latin%20Roots
TUE 7:29 PM
I know it helped me a ton. Can't shut me up now.
TUE 7:30 PM
Haha :joy:
TUE 7:30 PM
I am interested to see how they do it â€”itâ€™s going to take more discipline and a different caliber of student than we generally attractâ€”neither is a bad thing
TUE 7:31 PM
Love the new library room btw â€”itâ€™s a great place to math it up
TUE 7:32 PM
I bet! =)
TUE 7:32 PM
Hopefully, it blocks everything else out so you can focus in comfort.
TUE 7:32 PM
I find that the animals come in because itâ€™s quiet and peaceful
TUE 7:32 PM
Yes Itâ€™s great
TUE 7:33 PM
Except the cat on my laptop
TUE 7:33 PM
Image attached to message
TUE 7:33 PM
Claims he is editing
TUE 7:33 PM
It's such a good thing cats are the cutest of all creatures. No other animals are allowed to do that with my keyboard.
TUE 7:34 PM
One day, when I'm like, all wealthy and have everything in the world I could dream of, I would have this for a pet: https://philosopher.life/#Bobbit%20Worm%20Tank
TUE 7:34 PM
Yeah Crumbles is my kitty â€”He is so low key and cuddly
TUE 7:35 PM
That would go well in the library.
TUE 7:35 PM
Um bobbit worms are terrifying....just looked
TUE 7:36 PM
:eyes:
TUE 7:37 PM
:flushed:
TUE 7:37 PM
This forum-story is a keeper: http://www.michiganreefers.com/forums/advanced-topics/84173-bobbit-worm-chronicles.html
TUE 7:37 PM
Oh my
TUE 7:38 PM
Creepy ....
TUE 7:38 PM
We just need very strong aquariums. Like, what's the worst that could happen? The Aliens never escape their prisons, right?
TUE 7:39 PM
Suuuuurrrre
TUE 7:39 PM
Sounds like something Steven King would have a ball with
TUE 7:40 PM
/shivers
TUE 7:40 PM
I cannot read him anymore. Terrifying accounts of human beings. I nope right out of there.
TUE 7:40 PM
[[k0sh3k]] has me reading Circe. It's fun.
TUE 7:41 PM
How's [[AG]] and [[UJ]] doing? Are they enjoying their summer?
TUE 7:42 PM
Circe by who?
TUE 7:43 PM
[[UJ]] is still teaching â€”school is not out for him yet.
TUE 7:43 PM
[[AG]] is trying to eat better and get outside more
TUE 7:43 PM
Oh, snap. I thought it was over.
TUE 7:43 PM
I have read that one! It was fun
TUE 7:43 PM
The Song of Achilles by her is good too
TUE 7:44 PM
Thank you for the recommendation.
TUE 7:44 PM
May pick that up too.
TUE 7:44 PM
So far [[AG]] has had one good day â€”encouraging her to have more
TUE 7:45 PM
Didnâ€™t pick up a bunch of junk food either
TUE 7:45 PM
It is so crazy hard to do.
TUE 7:45 PM
At least for me.
TUE 7:46 PM
Yeah â€” food is my bane
TUE 7:46 PM
A day without goodies is joyless :confused:
TUE 7:47 PM
Ok maybe not that bad but still
TUE 7:47 PM
Lol, aye. The craving is so strong.
TUE 7:47 PM
Yep
TUE 7:48 PM
Can't be easy for her, and by extension you all either.
TUE 7:48 PM
No but we all need to do better
TUE 7:48 PM
