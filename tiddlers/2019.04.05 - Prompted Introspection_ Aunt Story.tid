title: 2019.04.05 - Prompted Introspection: Aunt Story

!! Tell a story that you have had with one of your aunts.

I'm terrible at this. I don't have stories so much as facts; there is something profoundly wrong about the way in which I tell the stories of our lives because they aren't normal functioning stories at all. That says something quite sad about the nature of my own narrative that I tell myself; I'm not just incomplete, I'm brokenly incompetent. My brain don't work right.

Alright, so a story about Aunt Mary. I remember heading up to a funeral, and she threw a lavish party for us. She must have bought $500 worth of lobster. I've never had a meal of just lobster (actually, it might have been the first time I ever had lobster). This broken woman who my donors regularly attacked in private went beyond hospitality. I've worked to see her mental status and history differently. I'm probably of no use to the woman, but I am grateful to rethink who we are through her.
