title: 2020.03.07 - Sphygmus: Diagramming

"""
[1:17 AM] robotic_scarab: completely random, and this might not be a part of grammar - have you tried sentence diagramming with 1uxb0x?
[1:17 AM] robotic_scarab: I only ask because I vaguely remember it being a thing my mom did with me for at least long enough for me to still remember it :P
[1:17 AM] robotic_scarab: not sure it solves "finding grammar errors while rereading writing" tho
[1:19 AM] h0p3: Thank you. It is something we will need to try again. [[k0sh3k]] and I were just talking about this on our walk tonight.
[1:19 AM] h0p3: We've tried a lot of ways to teach grammar to him. I think my favorite has been this series: https://jackrispublishing.com/collections/growing-with-grammar
JacKris Publishing
Growing With Grammar
This program is easy to use for both students and teachers. Students can work independently. Plenty of review along with fun workbook lessons.
[1:21 AM] robotic_scarab: those workbooks look good
[1:22 AM] robotic_scarab: I wouldn't know where to begin teaching grammar, lol. "indefinite pronoun" wat? I skate by with my reasonably habituated feel for it. XP
[1:23 AM] h0p3: Part of the issue is that he's just not a native speaker of any language. He doesn't get to rely upon how it sounds to him all too often. He seems to make quantum leaps though, it's hard to predict, and it's hard to know what worked.
[1:24 AM] h0p3: My brother had a class in college specifically on teaching grammar. He said the literature suggests that our current standard methods (including that jackris series) aren't generally effective.
[1:26 AM] h0p3: I don't have much room to talk. My Kentucky-boy grammar blows, and my writing has to be mediated through tooling most of the time.
[1:27 AM] h0p3: It's a mountain to climb. At the moment, walking line-by-line through his writing is what we're trying.
[1:30 AM] h0p3: This might be a place where he would benefit from going to school as well.
[1:30 AM] h0p3: Typing in video games turned out to be a good motivator for him.
[1:32 AM] robotic_scarab: I hear you. I wish I had a better response than that..
[1:33 AM] robotic_scarab: I think my grammar has gotten worse over time. I know I have bad habits (passive voice?!), and I don't particularly put in a lot of effort to address flaws. also, meme-ing on purpose is fun, but do it too much and watch me slide...
[1:35 AM] robotic_scarab: I think a large majority of people aren't well versed in grammar, though, so one goal is likely to aim for better than the majority and hopefully hit the target right there with the rest of them
[1:39 AM] h0p3: I'm feeling hopeful that we can do that. If you asked me 8 years ago, I would not have thought that was a reasonable possibility. Who knows who he will be 8 years from now. He's an enigma to me.
[1:40 AM] h0p3: If and when you have children, do you think you will homeschool?
[1:40 AM] robotic_scarab: oh lawd, no idea
[1:41 AM] robotic_scarab: I think the ideal is to homeschool, for me personally. I believe it had a strong positive impact on me, especially after experiencing a little bit of public school and hearing stories from other friends
[1:43 AM] robotic_scarab: even the schools in districts with lots of money aren't going to have the same "learn to love learning" focus -- certainly there's people who appear to have that drive naturally and so the school environment didn't beat it out of them but the context doesn't seem to build it
[1:43 AM] robotic_scarab: but I feel completely unqualified compared to my parents, and I (selfishly) am not sure I would want to take the time to do the job with the dedication it requires / deserves
[1:45 AM] h0p3: More time and energy than I knew. It's easier with two though. I don't know how people do it alone.
[1:46 AM] h0p3: Your parents were teachers, right? Did their co-workers find it odd that you were homeschooled?
[1:46 AM] h0p3: Most of the time when I spoke with other teachers, they felt like I was betraying the cause or lacked loyalty in some sense.
[1:54 AM] robotic_scarab: when I was still a baby/toddler, yes, they were both english teachers. to my knowledge, that didn't pan out likely for the same reasons they started homeschooling me (finding the public schools to not be about learning but just hitting test scores, that sort of thing, push-back from collegues along the lines of betraying the cause etc). at some point before I would have gone to 1st grade they made the decision that my mom would stay at home & teach my brother and I, and we skint by on my dad's income pretty much until I went to college (my mom was 23 and my dad 24 when they had me; he'd taken the bar exam twice but didn't pass/// REDACT PLZ/// [[REDACTED]] /// END REDACT /// unfortunately I think those struggled contributed to pushing them away from each other rather than together.)
[2:02 AM] h0p3: It could not have been easy for any of you. It sounds like they stayed together, in part, to make sure you and your brother received good educations. I could imagine that it may be fairly difficult for your mother in the workforce after having stayed home, perhaps setting her behind in her career in a radical way.
[2:29 AM] robotic_scarab: Yes, they prioritized our educations heavily. I think they saw it as our best chance to "do better" than they had done (and that appears to be relatively correct so far, along some normative scale of "doing better"). 

I have the sense that it was definitely tricky for my mother once we started public school; feeling lost and very stuck. Thankfully she was able to get her master's online in, hrm, I'm going to forget the term - basically curriculum development focusing on the tech side (learning management software etc). 
==== PLEASE REDACT ====
[[REDACTED]]
==== END REDACT ====
I'm hoping it works out for her!!! I feel like she has serious imposter syndrome when it comes to her assessment of her own work and if this works out it would be more evidence against any imposter syndrome. :)
[2:36 AM] robotic_scarab: I don't usually ask for redaction but - well, I feel comfortable with you knowing more details about my family, less comfortable with that being open to the internet given that I don't have their implicit or explicit consent here.
[2:39 AM] robotic_scarab: this is where privacy becomes really tricky for me -- to what extent do I have the right to talk about other people and share their stories in the open without their prior consent? :S
[11:03 AM] h0p3: I'm glad to hear your mother is doing well there. I hope it works out for her too. I can imagine her imposter syndrome feelings; it's easier for me to see from way over here that she's clearly talented. Her market value is a poor indication of who she is.
[11:05 AM] h0p3: Feel free to ask for redactions, please. You have the rightful power to change my wiki and what comes out of my mouth.
[11:09 AM] h0p3: Consent will not always give you the right to share information either, and consent is not a clear notion, unfortunately. I think individuals have a morally justified right to a legal right to free speech which would enable them to share that information. I take your worry to be the broader or deeper question of what our moral obligations are more generally though. My usual unfortunate answer: it depends on the context.
[11:11 AM] h0p3: This is one of the reasons that I push so very hard for people to take up pseudonymity and better tooling. We have to be able to talk about the truth of who we are (which includes what we know about others), especially with strangers.
