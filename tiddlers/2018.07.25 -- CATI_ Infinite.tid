title: 2018.07.25 -- CATI: Infinite

We can make a dual statement about
zero or nothing. There is a duality
between zero and infinity, expressed in the
elementary identity 1/0 = âˆž. If one side of
the duality does not occur in nature, also
the other side ought not to. Thus, properly
interpreted, zero cannot exist
