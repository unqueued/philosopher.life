Hi Leon,

I had to look Milan Kundera up, and I went through some quotes of his (https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Milan_Kundera). Is there a particular book of his you think stands out? Why?

Yes, my site runs on Tiddlywiki. It isn't heavily modified. I rabbithole and jump around a lot inside the wiki, and it gives me a nice workflow. I agree, it is nifty. Why did you end up moving away from Tiddlywiki?

Russell's Paradox is an excellent version of the problem. I'm being pulled, kicking and screaming, into https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/. I feel compelled to conceive about (although not "of") the inconceivable. At the end of your argument, I have a hard time understanding if you are agreeing to Platonism or a skeptical internalist constructivism on which representations do not ultimately correspond to anything external to the mind.

I'm walking through your Deep Focus music list. That's a project I've been working on in the past couple weeks myself: https://philosopher.life/#:Music.
