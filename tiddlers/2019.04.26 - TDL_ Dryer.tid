title: 2019.04.26 - TDL: Dryer

* Dryer. We probably have a week.
** Probably can't have a date. That's okay.
* Bliss sounds good.
** But, maybe can't.
** I think I want to continue DCK usage on Sundays.
* I have no idea what we are eating. Grits sound good to me.
* I need to clean.
** I'm grateful for working bathrooms.
