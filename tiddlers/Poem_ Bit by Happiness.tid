title: Poem: Bit by Happiness

```
bit by bit,
0 by 0,
1 by 1;

byte by byte,
object by object,
abstraction by abstraction.

Data-structure by Algorithm,
Tool by Telos,
Narrative by Number;

Develop and Optimize.
Reduce and Emerge.
Construct and Deconstruct...

{Evolve}
Software eats The World;
The World is Software.

Being and Becoming,
Existence and Freedom,
The Good and The Right.

Welcome to the Plight of Dasein!
Survive, nay: /[(Thr|L)ive] in the [Maelstrom_Machine]!
Find the Way and the Others!

Be Happy and hence Wise:
Bite into the red Fruit of Eudaimonia;
Let it byte you.

/[P(r|l)ay] & [Celebrate]: [The_Computer_Game_of_Life]
```
