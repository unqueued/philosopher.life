title: 2018.12.01 - Polymath Craftsman: Catdoor

Catdooooooor, catdooooor.<<ref "catdog">>

My son retrieved the petdoor from the mini-shed behind our apartment. With his help, I was able to install it. Hopefully, this will help my wife sleep just a smidge better. I realize it endangers our cats and perhaps our housing safety. But, my wife is adamant about her cats, even if it is catastrophic for us. This is the best option I have in my situation, I believe.

I'm still concerned about it leaking our temps in/out. I don't have the necessary insulation foam. I have a different way I'd apply it this time around too. We'll see if I can scrounge some up.
