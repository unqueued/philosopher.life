title: 2019.06.18 - Wiki Review: Rescheduled

* [[2019.06.17 - Computer Musings: Tabs]]
** Keep blowing through 30GB of RAM. Too expensive to re-use ECC off the rack server.
* [[2019.06.17 - Link Log: Bleh]]
** Basically, zero discussion. Drop it like it's hot.

** They rescheduled for tomorrow; I don't know why they moved it up, but that's fine with us. I shouldn't get my hopes up. This is just a {[[dream]]}! Who knows what will happen? I'm not much of a weeb, but I've had a lot of fun just fantasizing with my wife about what it might be like.

** Completed. Unfortunately, I can't remember all the tidbits of the day. 
** I'm lucky to be able to snuggle with my wife so much.

** Waiting on the money to come in first. I don't want to jump the gun.

** This is too much repetition!

** I'm running out of quotes from [[Saint Chomsky]]. I kind of want to do Marx or perhaps aphoristic writers. I'm glad I have some other things lined up.
