//My son, brother in autism.//

My son is truly damaged, and it is largely my fault, both genetically and memetically. My son does not believe in himself, he does not have hope, and he is a boy in pain. Not every circumstance is in my control, but I can see how I have contributed to his suffering and created a sad child. 

I must help him become happy. I must give him hope. I must protect him. I must cultivate him. I must be a good rolemodel for him. I must empathize with him deeply. I need to make up for my mistakes, and I can. It may never be perfect, in fact it could be a series of crises, but I must. My son needs me to be a good father, or at least the best that I can be.
