title: 2019.09.19 - Afterschool Teaching: Damned Good

Damned good to be back! Whitney is late, as usual. Delp called in all the reinforcement to replace me. Good. Prep was fast. Whitney interrogated me about my own children, and I'm happy to explain; I am surprised she showed interest (I also cannot tell if she knew the answers [several bits she should know in advance, having heard them before] beforehand, but her facial expressions registered legitimate surprise).

I continue to compliment my high schoolers who are not here for any other reason than they want to help (rather than meeting their volunteer hour requirements). We talked about moral motivation.

My angel, Madame Bacon reigns tonight. She da bes. The woman is generous, honest, and funny. My wife says I must not inspect her too closely since I will eventually be disappointed; it is true, few escape my scrutiny. I will keep my image of her for a long as possible.

My children were not thrilled with the veggies, but I'm paying attention to who is eating them. Some are hungry, hungry. Maybe I need to start tracking this.

One-on-one's were exceptionally warm and fuzzy for me. That is not why I am here, but I am grateful for the dancing light. 5CM even came up to hug me because she missed me (ya weirdo ;P). I got a ton of handshakes from the boys, and several were comfortable reaching for my shoulder or arm to grab my attention. This is not my standard bubble at all. It's odd to have people tell me they missed me (and, I missed them too). That is not how my life normally goes either. While these aren't the most rigorous and in depth conversations I get to have with my students, opening with this practice is still my favorite part of the day. It's guaranteed "gerome gerome the metronome" results. Maybe I'm like their weird neighbor, uncle, or rando-adult checking in each day? I don't know who I am to them except Mr. Gandalf, of course (today they were bringing me lots of fantasy novels). 

5E and I talked about his reading. I'm asking him to take Matt's reading lists more seriously. The man has a minor passion for children's fiction, and they'd do well to read everything in his library. I'm also pleased with the material he is teaching. He might be wrong about a fuckton, but he does teach English in a significant way. I'm going to keep pushing every child I have to pay attention to him in this space. We talked about his parents; his dad read a lot when he was still alive. I saw the pain in his eyes and barely held it together. Read on, son.

5DB2 and I talked about being poor. Ridiculously well-mannered kid. That kid needs a fucking computer. Most of my children do. This is insane. What are we doing? 

8HM and I talked about her book. I hope she begins to identify as a reader. It's one of the things which distinguishes her, and she does almost as an escape. She doesn't do high volume or anything I consider radically salient, but she is methodical, close, and takes on material well above her pay grade. 

6NP and 6KM seems to have normalized more with me after our boundary disputes. You know, when I was there age, we had literal pissing contests. It's not good for your urethra to do what we did, but we could make it soar 15 feet and hit the teachers' cars (I am SO sorry, Mrs. Moseley <3).

5DB1 and I talked about the history of wealth in the US. He talked me through some historical figures. He asked to lookup information on his phone (which is not like this rule-follower at all). We talked about that as well. He's getting it. We talked about Bezos and capitalism. The boy still has too much Trumpism and Rande-Locke memeplex in him, but we're going to work on our critical reasoning some more.

I'm honored to have the chance to just say "go ahead, you can, I trust you" to some of my students before they reach me. I'd rather get to a point where they know they deserve it.

To the lab! Let's see if Delp is going to recognize. I'm not allowed to explicitly say I'm going to break the rules. He's either going to catch the tacit drift and accept it, or I will eventually lose the job. Passive resistance is my only hope for buying my children open time in the lab.

My namesake and I talked about high heels and the incentives for wearing them. She keeps stumbling on excellent [[redpill]] material, such as record breaking fingernails. I keep catching her reading way more too. Falling head over heels for her when I see a book in her hands. GO! GO! GO! I am her clown cheerleader. At least a town retard like me has a purpose.

Oh noes, there are swearwords in some of my songs. Let us wink and then jam. 

6JR worked on python with me today. I don't think his heart is in it. I hear ya. There's something to having tangible, immediate results. My method of teaching is likely garbage here. 

Overall, I feel more comfortable smalltalking with my children than adults. My children break all my rules. Welp, good.

Whitney left the library destroyed. I am glad I caught it in time. 5Am and I are rumbling. That kid is profoundly dishonest. We got it clean.

The Janitors and I shot the shit for bit. Easy going fellas. I hope I am useful to them and/or put them at ease as well.
