!! Audit:

* I've not been diligent enough in searching. I'm disappointed in myself here.
** Eventually, I'd like to get to a point where I'm searching beyond [[Prompted Introspection]] as well. 
*** Surely, there is never enough dot-connecting in here. I make it reasonable to do so, but I don't engage in the practice directly enough. I need to do that. 
**** This is another way of saying I need to eventually get back to [[The Remodeling]].
***** I adore the way [[Sphygmus]] is smashing through her wiki too.
* I will reaffirm this attempt to answer questions from different angles and interpretations. 
* This seems like an inescapably necessary kind of [[PSM]] work, or even just self-modeling in private must engage in it.
** My offspring must become adept at telling themselves the stories of who they are, which includes vanilla interrogation. They heard it from me a 1000 times. I hope the practice will eventually demonstrate the obvious to them.
*** There's a gut instinct developed through habituation and rehearsal. There's a calm lightning here.
** The [[CDR]] offers a number of standing threads which intuitively slot my memory and calculation. I think that braid is so strong, I could do only that, and this wiki would still be extremely fit. [[Prompted Introspection]] forces me to contend with something outside in a reliable manner, and it's a doable amount of work.
*** I think this log does the most work of any [[CDR]] in [[DOR]]ing [[Root]], or at least paving the way for it. It's an overlapping stream of updates, my tentpegs evolve and grow here (they are tested, and my vocabulary is used).
* I have to stand back from myself, especially my desires, to describe them here.
** [[CTS]] and [[TDL]] are more [[/b/]]ish and don't aim for broader timeslices or emergence.
* It's a great place to be silly-serious. I adore attacking the question in a way it was not meant to be taken.
** I feel like a child when I get to do that.
* I'm tempted to just copy [[Sphygmus]] here.
** Would be a shame to break my objectivity goal. Maybe I've earned the right to do it like she does though.
* Ugh, I fucking that I'm saying this, but I feel like I need more questions which ask me how I'm feeling or how I feel about X.
* My wife enjoys these far more than my offspring. She regularly laughs.
** I talk about her way more in these too though.
* Heavily qualified to particularism 
** Some thing cannot be answered to my satisfaction. I don't like that, but that's the truth and I need to advance it.
* These are short. I can feel my lack of time this month in my writing.
