I hope you can get some solid sleep and have a break!
Dec 15, 2019 7:45pm
We're doing well. Getting everything packed and what not.
Dec 15, 2019 7:45pm
Lots of logistics in the move to work out.
Dec 15, 2019 7:45pm
I was thinking about having a pizza party with you guys at our place this week, if yall had time.
Dec 15, 2019 7:46pm
Yea that sounds Good let me talk to Esteban in the boys and I’ll get back to you
Dec 15, 2019 8:01pm
What night were you thinking? I definitely would like to hang out more before you guys move. I already know how much it takes to  make a big move- coming from CO was no joke! But we’d love to spend as much time as possible together we are going to miss having such awesome neighbors. Definitely leaving this community in July you all were one of the factors in resigning our lease
Dec 15, 2019 10:30pm
I'd prefer not Saturday, since we're going to busy packing hard that day. Any other night (including tomorrow) would be great!
Dec 15, 2019 10:34pm
Hey I’m so sorry trying to get back to you as fast as possible a lot going on so I’m thinking that we can do Thursday or Friday I’m so sorry that it’s so close to Saturday I have to take the boys to the vet tonight I’m on my way to pick them up right now and then tomorrow I have a charity Christmas thing to wrap presents and prepare then Wednesday night is the actual night that we give the kids their presents so I’m really not open until Thursday or Friday so let me know which day or evening would work for you
Dec 16, 2019 4:06pm
Naw, no reason to be sorry! Thursday would be amazing. How about 6? We'll have pizza and beer, chillax.
Dec 16, 2019 4:10pm
This month is always insanely busy.
Dec 16, 2019 4:11pm
Yes it is what do you think I can bring to help?
Dec 16, 2019 4:12pm
Totally up to you. You don't have a bring anything. 
Dec 16, 2019 4:13pm

Dec 16, 2019 4:14pm

Dec 16, 2019 4:15pm
Hey there sorry for the late message? Curious to know if they finished the work in your place today?
Dec 17, 2019 9:18pm
We came home to a notification on our door that work was completed but we still have holes in the ceiling?
Dec 17, 2019 9:19pm
I think they did? They left holes and came back though. Might need to bug them.
Dec 17, 2019 11:23pm
They seemed to be fairly rushed when they were here.
Dec 17, 2019 11:23pm
See you in 30 minutes
Dec 19, 2019 5:30pm
Aww seeing the u packs make it real for sure
Dec 20, 2019 5:41pm
Sorry I was on the phone with an upset esteban when we first pulled up trying to chill him out
Dec 20, 2019 5:42pm
Forgot my card so we pulled off to run up to subway- Matthew & I
Dec 20, 2019 5:42pm
I know! It's surreal. Don't worry about the phone. Sorry I interrupted you. I just didn't want you to have to worry about that forklift (though that driver was very skilled).
Dec 20, 2019 6:25pm
Ha no you didn’t interrupt me I was actually hoping to tell esteban I had to go unfortunately just nothing I could do with his issue!
Dec 20, 2019 6:27pm

Dec 20, 2019 6:27pm
All good tho!
