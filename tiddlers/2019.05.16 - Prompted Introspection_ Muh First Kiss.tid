title: 2019.05.16 - Prompted Introspection: Muh First Kiss

!! Tell about your first kiss.

I have responded to this before: [[2018.03.21 - Prompted Introspection Log: First Kiss]]. Since that one handled the first sexual kiss, I will move onto broader homo sapien kissing behavior. I am sure I was kissed by my donors within the first day of being alive. I don't remember it obviously, but I assume it made my donors feel warm inside. I was a confabulated triumph of their allergies.
