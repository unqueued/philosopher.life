Hey!
SUN 12:09 PM
I haven't heard from you in a long time.
SUN 12:09 PM
Snow?
31 MIN AGO
Isn't it wonderful?
31 MIN AGO
We're all sitting in the same room, listening to music, talking, and working on our education projects (primarily on our computers).
30 MIN AGO
You guys have a lot of snow over there?
30 MIN AGO
A micron
30 MIN AGO
lol
29 MIN AGO
Rain here
28 MIN AGO
I'm hoping it freezes over so we get out of school/work.
28 MIN AGO
Only a minor possibility
27 MIN AGO
=(
27 MIN AGO
that is a shame
27 MIN AGO
Wind turbulence says no
26 MIN AGO
Upper air friction won’t allow the snow to reach the ground
24 MIN AGO
`/sadface`
23 MIN AGO
Global warming has odd effects
23 MIN AGO
What do you think will be the result of global warming for the next 100 years? (feel free to make as many assumptions as you feel necessary)
22 MIN AGO
If co2 emissions are not reduced unbreathable
20 MIN AGO
Acid rain and no oxygen
19 MIN AGO
Good times.
18 MIN AGO
Lol.
18 MIN AGO
Do you think CO2 emissions will be reduced (including how developing nations develop)?
18 MIN AGO
Ω
17 MIN AGO
Do you mean it will be greatly reduced?
16 MIN AGO
No!
15 MIN AGO
Ah, your forecast isn't so pleasant then.
14 MIN AGO
Great for mask makers
13 MIN AGO
China has them already
13 MIN AGO
Aye. I've seen people in the states wear them too.
12 MIN AGO
Not a surprise
12 MIN AGO
Do you believe global warming will wipe out most of the human species?
11 MIN AGO
(or, how confident are you?)
11 MIN AGO
No cooler heads will prevail
11 MIN AGO
What steps will be taken?
11 MIN AGO
Clean air in smart nations
10 MIN AGO
It seems to me that some nations will have no power over it. Emissions from one country have profound effects on the air quality of other nations.
9 MIN AGO
That is the problem
9 MIN AGO
Do you retract your claim that cooler heads will prevail, or what do you see?
8 MIN AGO
Domes
7 MIN AGO
Only the wealthy will survive is what you just said.
7 MIN AGO
right?>
7 MIN AGO
Smart ones
6 MIN AGO
I am not seeing why it is not the case, on your view, why "global warming will wipe out most of the human species."
5 MIN AGO
Not unless we pack like enslaved sardines.
5 MIN AGO
I already look at high population density areas as moving toward that.
5 MIN AGO
Smart ones will build domes
4 MIN AGO
Smart and wealthy*
4 MIN AGO
It sounds like there will be islands of livable space within a dystopia of unbreathable, unsafe "outside the dome" area for most humans to suffer and die in.
3 MIN AGO
(There are lots of good science fiction stories about this, imho)
3 MIN AGO
Yes but not simple
2 MIN AGO
Agreed.
1 MIN AGO
Well I need to go back to work good talking
NOW
Aye. TTYL! Thanks for chatting.
NOW
