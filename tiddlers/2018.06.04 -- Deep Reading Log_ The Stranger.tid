I summarized The Stranger a long time ago, with a remark I admit was highly paradoxical: 'In our society any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death.' I only meant that the hero of my book is condemned because he does not play the game
<<<

This is a crucial issue. Mere social games, be they legal or social conventions that we've constructed, aren't necessarily universal norms. Unfortunately, this book appears to glorify dark-triadic traits, psychopathy in particular. I agree to the arbitrariness and unjustifiable aspects of most human beliefs and desires. Humanity is the way it is, but it ought not be. The "ought" here, of course, is likely absurd to Camus.

//Apatheist// is an awesome word, btw.

I cannot embrace the meaninglessness of the universe, if indeed it is meaningless. I can't lie to myself about it like that. 

I must admit: I'm desperately uncomfortable with engaging in the most serious kinds of philosophy in mere narrative, novel form. Mixing rhetoric with argumentation is dangerous in my experience. I realize the power of narratives, and I'll be interested to see how it plays out here.

His work sounds excellent.

Excellent. I recognize the uncertainty and absurdity issues; I'm a dialetheist. It seems kind of obvious to me why Camus is eschewing formal, rigorous philosophy...

<<<
The laws of God, the laws of man,
He may keep that will and can;
Not I: let God and man decree
Laws for themselves and not for me;
And if my ways are not as theirs
Let them mind their own affairs.
Their deeds I judge and much condemn,
Yet when did I make laws for them?
Please yourselves, say I, and they
Need only look the other way.
But no, they will not: they must still
Wrest their neighbor to their will,
And make me dance as they desire
With jail and gallows and hell-fire.
And how am I to face the odds
Of man's bedevilment and God's!
I, a stranger and afraid
In a world I never made.
They will be master, right or wrong;
Though both are foolish, both are strong.
And since, my soul, we cannot fly
To Saturn nor to Mercury.
Keep we must, if keep we can,
These foreign laws of God and man.

The book was ridiculously short. It was absurd. It oversimplified to the point of breaking our backs. I liked it more than I thought I would. It was visceral for book trying to be so flat in affect most of the time. These moves are on purpose. I suppose that makes it a kind of art.

I have to say this, I don't think Camus is much of a philosopher. He's making philosophical art, but he isn't even trying to put forth a major theory. He's avoiding it and just pointing. I'm appreciative that he did. Of course, I'm asking for the thing he says is impossible. I understand why he wouldn't take a step in my direction here.

I'm looking for reconstruction after this deconstruction. It's not there.
