title: 2019.01.21 - Meditation: Hard

I did some yoga. I hate to say it, but the physical part might be the most enjoyable part to me. I like a good stretch, balancing (it's like fidgeting with my body), and movement (yeah, I need to do more). My meditation is much harder. I want to write things down as I trail off, and I have a hard time not thinking of anything. Concentrating on my breathing is my only hope (though it can't be to that point where I only breathe because I'm consciously willing each breath; my son has that too, it's hard to let go). I tried for over an hour. At least it was relaxing on a fairly unrelaxing day.
