title: 2020.01.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Gorgeous Sleep

* Woke at 11
** Gorgeous sleep. Thank the maker.
* Read+Write
* Cleaning
* Offspring and I thought more about what they will do with their rooms. Partial lists drawn up.
** We need to continue this.
* Organizing house
* Did NOT head over to see the car because the guy couldn't tonight.
* Called [[Charlie]]
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** Moving to another spot on the jobsite. He considers this a bad sign, and it likely is. 
** That kid who pulled a knife on him eventually told people about it. That kid also didn't get into the army because of a gun-related felony, and he dropped out of the apprenticeship program. Oof.
** Even though it sometimes makes me giggle in despair, I despise that my brother is surrounded by evil men. Even the chill guys are evil once you look inside. =/.
*** My brother deserves good friends. He's a man of integrity, and that does not bode well for him. Fuck.
** Told me a story about meeting the firefighter (wife is cop) who closed their doors to fostering after a tragic fuckup in the legal system. 
*** He felt bad that the man felt compelled to say such painful things in the grocery store to him.
** Told my brother about the knife (thought he would appreciate me telling him about the gift before I gave it, lol). Came up in a discussion of safety.
** He's doing alright today. I think he was in good spirits.
*** This is hard to achieve given how honest he is. He doesn't pull any punches with himself in most cases, and I'm glad that he's increasingly resilient in many respects. 
** I like the way he and Rebecca cooperate and signal together with the baby. 
* Walked with wife
** So fucking tired looking, my wife was thinking we shouldn't walk. I'm glad I went anyway.
** Hat seemed to work well. 
** Tried on a skirt. We are fat. So, of course, we got moar cookies.
** Her day was busy today, but I like that it was sane. She's not pushed over-the-top.
*** I also like that her co-workers immediately recognize my wife's raw competence. She's skilled with her systems, picks 'em up fast, and does well with relationships despite her autism (I'm beyond jelly).
* Soup, salad, and sandwiches from my offspring.
* //Psych//
* Spooned with wife until I just passed right out. 
* Sent offspring to bed (worried about their sleep schedules at this point).
** We are still so discombobulated. 
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 2?
