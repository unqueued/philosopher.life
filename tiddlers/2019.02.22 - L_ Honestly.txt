How's your Friday going? What you up to today?
FRI 2:01 PM
Pretty well actually, just working but enjoying the company of some friends from out of town :3
FRI 2:03 PM
Noice. =)
FRI 2:03 PM
It is wonderful that you have so many friends to see. Company is good to have.
FRI 2:07 PM
It is! I honestly love it.
FRI 2:18 PM
I think it may be driving [[K]] crazy though... >_>
FRI 2:18 PM
Why do you think that is?
FRI 2:22 PM
Would you prefer 5 deep friendships for 50 shallow ones?
FRI 2:25 PM
I would prefer the 5 deep ones, personally, but the more we spend time with people the more we see sometimes they just need a good friends and not necessarily a deep one (if that makes any sense). There are a lot of people we interact with who just need someone with a level head to listen to them and give them good advice. I suppose in a sense that is a deep friendship, but it’s more just an honest one.
FRI 3:38 PM
[[K]] and I don’t make it a habit to call people good friends unless we truly know they would drop everything to help us. Everyone else is just an acquaintance.
FRI 3:39 PM
As for why it’s driving [[K]] crazy, he just hasn’t had a lot of alone time which is very important for him to “recharge” so to speak. I as an extrovert love every second of it because just being around people is good for me.
FRI 3:42 PM
That definitely makes sense to me. There is, of course, a difference between our preferences and obligations.
FRI 6:14 PM
I suppose there is a difference between being a friend //to// (or for) someone and being friends //with// them. I get the acquaintance thing.
FRI 6:16 PM
It must be a difficult balance to strike for both you and [[K]] there, lol.
FRI 6:16 PM
Yeeeaaaaaah.... I feel like I have to ask him “Are you okay? Do you need a break?” every two days
FRI 6:31 PM
