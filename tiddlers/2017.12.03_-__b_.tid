I wouldn't call myself a racist, but I do think some memetic heritages are definitionally better than others. I'm a culturalist. 

This is similar to how I think adoption demonstrates the real definition of being a parent, and it highlights how passing genetic material is conceptually irrelevant. I think what really matters is what memes use, act upon, and pass on, not our genes (well, an exception might be having a child knowing it would be genetically doomed given your DNA).

I am, aware, of course, that our conditioning is not "up to us," in many or most cases. I will call The Good as I see it, though.

I will admit, sometimes I perform //Premeditatio Malorum//, and other times not. I need to think more about how things can go wrong not just on the macro scale, but also micro scales. This is difficult as an autist, but I can still do my best.

I am part of the input streams you phenomenologically receive, but I am not the deciding force in how you think, feel, and behave; we might say, you are.

Stoicism helps you dismiss and reframe, but it does not solve any philosophical problems directly.

This may be another way to think about it. Set aside moral responsibility: you are bad for your children. It's that simple.

I am far less moved this year. I'm on cannabliss rather than post-K. I was a far more broken man last year though. I am enjoying it, but there are fewer cracks for it seep into me. I am increasingly redpilled about it. I would say I oscillate and move glacially on the redpill path. I am not committed to it. I resist it. But, it chinks the cracks, binds me, and makes sense of the world. They are goggles that reveal who and what we are. I must now become stoic about it.

My brother is very worried about Drinking-the-Koolaid (too late!). But, unfortunately, it means he will never be able to set his tent pegs down in the deep desert. He is stuck. He has the gift of deconstruction, but no willpower or hope to construct. He is swept by the postmodern bug. I know what it is like to be there, and I don't blame him. He's been burned before, and now he sees the real philosophical mountain we are climbing, the real endlessness of the desert we wander, etc.

GÃ¶del suggests If you can explain all the [sufficiently complex] rules; your system is inconsistent (contradictory rules are true).
If the rules are consistent, some things can't be explained.
