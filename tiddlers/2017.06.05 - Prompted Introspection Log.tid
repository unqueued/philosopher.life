!! If You Had To Choose To Live Without One Of Your Five Senses, Which One Would You Give Up?

There more than five senses. 

I'll do you one better. I'll rank them from most important to least.

# Sight (vision)
# Touch (somatosensation)
# Hearing (audition)
# Taste (gustation)
# Smell (olfaction)

Duh. I can barely smell in the first place, and I don't find it terribly useful most of the time when I can. The times I would miss it might actually be outweighed by the times I'm glad I couldn't. The rest of the senses I would miss dearly in almost all cases.
