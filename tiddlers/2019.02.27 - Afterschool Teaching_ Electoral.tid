title: 2019.02.27 - Afterschool Teaching: Electoral

Phone was dead on arrival. I charged it with my emergency charger.

Whitney and I talked regular shop. She is hoping one of the kids isn't gay. =/ 

I took the older kids today. We had our come to jesus talk, several kids started working right on the spot on electives. 6Bm made good progress today in python. I had to explain a lot of concepts very quickly for him (he had never heard of browser bookmarks...). Some girls are working on foreign languages. 7Jm claims to want to learn poetry so he can rap better. We'll work on that. Someone wants to learn anatomy as well. I hope to make progress on this front.

We talked about what learning was like as an adult. Teaching ourselves is hard work.

Admittedly, I'm putting myself at risk by going against the grain by allowing my kids to use their phones for learning. I simply don't have the resources to do this any other way. I'm in "asking for forgiveness is easier than asking for permission" territory. The fact is that if I ask, they will see themselves as liable for it. I just need to take the liability quietly and if it succeeds, then they can take the credit for it.

I talked with 9Tm about fitting and pipewelding. That's what he wants to do. I asked him to start reading about electricity and studying geometry. The academic prep will be useful to him. I know TCAT's waitlist is over a year, so I told him when he needed to apply.

One of 7Jm's teachers came to speak with me about how she would signal to me that he had homework. The kid is a liar (stronger than most of these kids) and lazy as fuck. With a little bit of interrogation, I've determined she deserves to my backing.

Delp and Matt were screwing around in the office and decided it was time to do surprise Yonanas. I did all the prep while sat in the office. They required the kids to sit in the cafeteria. This prep should have been done much earlier, and the kids paid the price. Eventually, I convinced them to let me take most of the kids to the gym while they took turns serving the treats.

I got some reading done today. Apparently, students and teachers know what books I'm reading. That's weird. I'm not flashing it. I do make a point to worship reading in front of everyone though. I talk it up. I'm hyping that shit, yo. Bitches need to fucking read. PLEASE.

Matt and his fiance (both teachers in training) asked me about what I felt about the "would you be willing to coach?" on the job applications. I explained why it was there and what it meant; I explained how sports were used in these schools, the financial and social roles it played. He think he'll do it until tenure. I think he's actually a climber though. He claims to care about academics instead of sports. I'm pretty torn. I've not seen him teach. His ridiculously authoritarian while also being deadwrong in his ethics and political philosophy. 

Matt's fiance talked to me about his personality. He's obviously an only child. She added that his mom had 6 miscarriages before him. Yeah, I can see that.

Delp asked if I would be here next year because he was going to rely upon me with Matt leaving. I know. We talked about where we come from. Sounds like he had a stable childhood. I see his conservatism.

5LL has been pulled by his mother from the program (he continues to lie to her). She gave me a thumbs though and said I raised his math grade from failing to a B. I said that was pretty good. What I didn't say: that kid could do way, way better. I know it when I see it. The kid looks at me like I'm the reason his daddy don't love him though. I can't fix that shit.

I'm doing what I can with what I have. I'm a good slave. 

I can say I wouldn't want any of these people teaching my offspring.
