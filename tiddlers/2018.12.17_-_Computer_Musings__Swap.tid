title: 2018.12.17 - Computer Musings: Swap

We swapped the Archer router in on a whim. It worked. Gigabit speeds again, and I can feel it between HTPC and [[m10]]. Had to call Spectrum to reset the modem (since our resets weren't working, and they wouldn't assign automagically). [[j3d1h]] is doing a fine job.
