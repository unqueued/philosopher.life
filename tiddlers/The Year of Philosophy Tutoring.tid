title: The Year of Philosophy Tutoring

I can show you the world

Shining, shimmering, splendid

I can give my children a worldclass education in this topic. They need to be older, and they need to know how to work hard. I can cram 10 years into 1 in some respects, and frankly, we've already started. I can show them what it means to really read a text, to study it, to interpret it, to be charitable, to understand, to know. I can show them the world of philosophy, the most important world of ideas. They will have the lense I never did.

This is a way for us to earn a low enough amount that my daughter can also get into Berea. Although, this is really just an afterthought. I expect she can get into much better schools.

We can easily find a way to afford not working for a month, but a year: that's way harder. This will require the stars to align and very hard to work. This is a goal that matters to me!
