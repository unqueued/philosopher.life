title: 2017.04.29 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.04.28 - Diet Log]]
** It's clear to me that vegetables and fruits are very filling. They don't have the satisfying feel of meat or grains, but these healthy foods still fill the volume-space of my stomach up preventing me from eating more. It's a placeholder.
* [[2017.04.28 - h0p3's Log]]
** Edits and restructuring.
* [[2017.04.28 - Seizing the Memes of Production]]
** Goes to the ideabag
* [[2017.04.28 - Link Log]]
** Fewer technical links and more social ones. Interesting.
* [[/a/ - Attic - Graveyard - Storage]]
** Renamed from "/v/ - Old - Meh - Graveyard"
** I kind of need a place to store stuff that I don't find useful. I don't want to erase it. I don't know where to put it. We'll see what I do with it.
* [[2017.03 - Family Log]]
** I really didn't say much.
* [[2017.03 - Homeschooling Log]]
** I really didn't say much, 2.
* [[2017.02 - Homeschooling Log]]
** I really didn't say much, 3. kek. I moved mountains yesterday. I have be okay with starting small. Look at all of my initial logs. They are always brief to begin with. Start small and work your way up.
* [[j3d1h: Autobackup to USB upon Mounting]]
** Talked to j3d1h about it. She thinks it is an interesting idea. We'll see. She has plenty of projects to work on already.
* [[Old random precursor document I found a copy of]]
** Garbage. Lol.
* [[2017.04.28 - Wiki Review Log]]
** Let me reiterate what I said before in the previous review (as a review of [[Wiki Review Log]]), I'm glad I'm doing this.
