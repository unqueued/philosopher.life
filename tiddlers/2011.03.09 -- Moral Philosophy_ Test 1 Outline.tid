```
1. (a) Explain meticulously any three cardinal features of the Function Argument Aristotle presents in Book I of the Nicomachean Ethics. (b) Provide one powerful argument against any aspect of the Function Argument. You may, if you wish, present one of the objections detailed in the lectures. [30]

[a]

    Aristotle’s Teleological Framework

        All things and activities have an end.

        An end of a thing is the good of a thing.

        For humans, the highest good, the end which isn’t a means to something else, is eudaimonia.

        To know what consists in eudaimonia, we need to know the function of humans.

    The function of humans will be distinctive and unique to humans.

        Parts of the soul (I’m not sure how to work perception in here)

            Rational (the unique aspect of humans)

            Appetitive

            Vegetative

        Human excellence consists in proper relationship between parts of the soul, particularly between reason, desires, and emotions.

        Each part of the soul must function properly for the whole to function properly.

    Leading a good human life:

        Living in accordance with reason

        Living in accordance with human virtues

        Biological conception of humanity

            Flourishing as a thing if it lives a life appropriate to that species.

        Social conception of humanity

            Ethics is part of politics

            Humans are social

            Being a good human requires living as a good citizen in society.



[b]

    Deny his teleological framework or at least some crucial part of it.

    Deny the uniqueness of reason





2. (a) Taking “Honor as a good” as the example of the field – as Michael Pakaluk describes it in a table his book, Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics: An Introduction – explain in careful detail Aristotle’s Doctrine of the Mean as outlined in Book II of the Nicomachean Ethics. (b) It was argued in the lectures that Aristotle’s doctrine could be construed as leading to relativism. Explain carefully and in detail why that claim was made and how it was substantiated. Finally, (c) defend Aristotle against the charge of relativism, citing and explaining the crucial passages from the Nicomachean Ethics that were also pointed out and discussed in the lectures. [35]

[a]

    The virtuous state is a mean/intermediate between states of excess and defect

        The mean is closer to one end of the spectrum than another.

    Honor as a good

        Excess: over-ambitiousness

        Mean: Not clearly named, but it is about having the correct measure of ambition.

        Deficiency: unambitiousness

[b]

    In some sense, the table of virtues isn't relative to any object, it is relative to us.

    It seems possible to construe the virtues as lacking objectivity.

Or

    The mean isn’t clearly an exact point on the gradient, but a small section of points on the gradient. Depending on the situation, the virtuous agent will fall within the bounds of that section.

    But, this seems to lack accuracy of a strict point on the gradient.

    It seems there are many things which count as virtuous on the gradient.

[c]

    (1109a33) – it is better to push towards the extreme which the mean is closest to than the other extreme, particularly when habituating virtue?





3. Write a fairly comprehensive essay on the relationship between choice or prohairesis, on the one hand, and felt desire or appetite, on the other hand, as Aristotle expounds it in Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics. In dealing with this issue, your essay must explicitly follow Pakaluk’s procedure delineated in his book, Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics – a procedure that was outlined in the lectures, too. You should also pay very close attention to Aristotle’s text; correct citation is quite crucial. [35]

    Prohairesis is the most distinctive mark of virtue (1111b5–6).

    He goes on to try and define Prohairesis, in part by showing what it is not.

    Aristotle shows a distinction between Prohairesis and Appetite by showing that the attributes of these two things are different.

    Prohairesis is not found in non-rational animals, but felt desire (appetite) is.

        (1111b12-14)

        Prohairesis is connected to rationality.

    Prohairesis does not govern the action of someone who shows weakness of will, but felt desire (appetite) does govern such action.

        (1111b14-15)

        Prohairesis isn’t an effective governing capacity in the akratic because it is replaced by felt desire.

    Prohairesis governs the action of someone who shows willpower, but felt desire (appetite) does not govern it.

        (1111b15-16)

        Agents with self-control are governed by prohairesis (pretty vital for the virtue agent).

    Prohairesis is found in opposition to felt desire, but felt desire (appetite) is not found in opposition to felt desire.

        (1111b16-17)

        A direct way to talk about how prohairesis and felt desire aren’t identical.

    Prohairesis is properly for things not insofar as they are either pleasant or painful, but felt desire (appetite) is properly for things only insofar as they are pleasant or painful.

        (1111b17-18)

        You can only feel desire for or desire against something which is either pleasant or painful. Prohairesis isn’t concerned with pleasantness or painfulness like felt desire.
