title: 2018.09.28 -- Le Reddit Log: Seeking Open Penpals

https://www.reddit.com/r/misanthropy/comments/9jp0vc/seeking_open_penpals/

To my understanding, misanthropy doesn't mean one is asocial/anti-social by choice, nor does it make one dark-triadic. There are good justifications for being profoundly unhappy with human cultures and society. Skepticism is often an insistence upon high epistemic standards. I admire it. I think misanthropes tend to see a reality that others hide from (especially since people conveniently hide from themselves). I appreciate your honesty.

My (untestable?) hypothesis is that about 3% of human specimens are decent persons. Only a fraction of those 3% are compatible with me. Finding the sliver of people I enjoy spending my time and energy engaging isn't fun or easy, but I think it's a worthy risk. I aim to employ a tit-for-two-tat golden-rule strategy in seeking relationships that matter.

I see a lot of suffering people in this community. But, I think the members of this community tend to treat each other fairly respectfully. In a sense, I wish more communities were like this one.

I'm looking for penpals who wish to transparently write out in the open. Please consider using a pseudonym with me (I suggest tools like https://protonmail.com as well). I will listen very carefully to you, and I hope you will do the same for me. I play with my cards face-up on the table. You can think about whether or not you wish to engage me (for all I know, I'm just one of the kinds of people you dislike): https://philosopher.life/.
