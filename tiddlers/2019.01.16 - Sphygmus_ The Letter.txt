I'm curious where k0sh3k sees the grammar error in "And these are the things I put in it."?
To my eye/ear, "these <the words below> are the things I put in it <this page>" which makes grammatical sense to me.

"Ah, well—so this page is my box. And these are the things I put it in it."

It's the "it in it" I believe.

This letter is taking it out of me.

oh my word I kept looking for a grammar error and kept blindly reading what I assumed it said :sweat_smile:

I can feel your effort and emotion when reading the letter! I'm in awe.

Imho, to have predictive coding that corrects errors is a sign of a profound sign of linguistic empathy. To literally perceive the world as it was meant to be by the [[other]] rather than the mere syntax requires habituation.

I'm grateful to have you reading, feeling, and thinking about the letter with me.

I have no idea how to explain to jbaty and dziggetai what we're doing.

I guess they just have to read and do their thing at the table. If they join, they join.

for many number of assorted reasons, I don't think many people are aware of their ability to be aware, or to exercise that awareness. I'm not sure what we're doing //can// be explained to those people.

I also agree -- in at least one way this is something they have to join and experience to understand; they can't just sit outside the sandbox and watch the children playing in the mud and think they understand, they have to jump in and play with us.

obviously we're doing much more than playing, but yeah.
