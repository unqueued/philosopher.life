[[2018.11.23 - Sphygmus: Whoa, Dude]]

I am pleased that you noticed! You were the only person outside of my immediate family that did.

I can mostly answer your question here: [[2018.11.23 - Computer Musings: TiddlyBackup Clusterfuck]]. I was pretty horrified when I realized that my work may have been lost. I touched about 150 tiddlers in that time frame.

This is not the only time I have had to rescue lost or even purposely deleted work.

Woot for Linux! =) Why are you making the jump? It is a vortex!

I adore Manjaro because it's so batteries loaded (I like Arch, but I'm too lazy for Arch<<ref "l">>). KDE is a powerful ecosystem;<<ref "k">> I would argue it is the most complete desktop environment available on linux, and it's very customizable. I think that's one of my favorite functional aspects of linux; I like tinkering and tailoring my digital home. I hope you love it. I'm interested to see how far you might go to tailor your system. You might even like ricing your system. If you keep a log of your exploration of it, I would like to see it one day. I like to look at screenshots too (blackout whatever is sensitive). I'd like to know how you feel and think about it.

You might also consider hopping around distributions (though, I'm a Manjaro fanboi<<ref "n">>). I like to try them out in virtual machines for a while, though somehow that's really not the same as living in the environment.

Ha, I'm glad you like the favicon. It was fun to make. [[j3d1h]] and I have been thinking about how to incorporate it into an ASCII art piece for [[Root]] or even as an animated replacement for the background of the wiki.
