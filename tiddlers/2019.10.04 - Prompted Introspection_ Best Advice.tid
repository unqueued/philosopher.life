title: 2019.10.04 - Prompted Introspection: Best Advice

!! What is the best advice you ever received?

Originally, it was stated to me by my donors as:

<<<
Do your best and have a good attitude.
<<<

It has taken on new meanings for me again and again. "Best" by what standard, [[gfwiwcgws]]? "[[Good]] attitude" according to whom, [[gfwiwcgws]]? My donors' standards and targets have been right and wrong in a variety of circumstances, and I consider them generally exploitative in most cases where they utter this phrase. The words, however, can point to a sentiment which objectively matters, but the interpretation is not simple. 

Doxastic voluntarism is usually indirect (one fundamental window into speaking about who we are is in virtue of an emergent disposition or character written over time by the choices we make), and similarly, our immediate feelings aren't often up to us in the moment. We have some control over what we do with our emotions, and our [[SO]] volition selects which [[FO]] desires we will act upon to some extent. We are accountable for holding [[The Right]] attitude in our context (which, of course, may include the option to arbitrarily select from up to an infinite set of morally equivalent imperfect duties after the CI computation). Insofar as our past choices define our circumstances, our [[4DID]] is responsible, but in pure [[phenomenology]], we are only responsible for what is up to us in the moment. Using one's Reason to compute, override, and bind or apply principles over one's sentiments [[irwartfrr]], a process paradoxically reliant upon sentiment to some non-trivial [[dok]], just is what it means to simultaneously //do your best// in dialectics with the fitting attitude [[irwartfrr]].
