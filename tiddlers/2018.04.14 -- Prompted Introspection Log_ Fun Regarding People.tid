title: 2018.04.14 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Fun Regarding People

!! How do you have the most fun–alone, with a large group, with a few friends–and why?

* Substance use, masturbation, reading, writing, listening to music, etc. when I'm alone.
* Leaving large groups is the most fun part.
* I like talking with friends, watching shows together, walking.
