Thank you for the gifts you sent us.<<ref "wf">> I hope the depth of my response demonstrates how seriously I take your gesture.<<ref "d">> I apologize for rudely taking entirely too long to respond, especially to family. If you care to look in this wiki,<<ref "g">> you will see I have been thinking about how to respond for a while. I can wait no longer. Thank you for reaching out to us. You all have been kind to us many times: thank you! We appreciate your gifts and hosting us in your thoughts, and I hope you know you are in our thoughts as well. 

I know the gifts are from your family as a whole, and that is how we accepted them. We feel your love in them. I also must recognize, meaning no offense to my favorite Uncle (a man I'm truly proud to call my Uncle<<ref "s">>), having watched AA's employment and gifted gift-giving talents for decades, I suspect she is more likely the primary force behind their choosing (I could easily be wrong, of course<<ref "wg">>). I have paid attention to your hospitality, and I wish I had the gumption to send you a gift first! Maybe [[Finding The Others]] is a graceful skill I too will acquire with age. In any case, I [[hope]] to repay your kindness.

I've been trying to reconnect with many people (e.g. [[2018.07.14 -- L&K: Let's Reset!]]), but I'm still not sure how to connect with you. I hope you will thoughtfully consider the kind of relationship I aim to have with you and others (see: {[[Contact]]}). Let me warn you in advance, this wiki is much larger than it appears.<<ref "t">> I upload my mind into this self-representation. I hope in time, you will appreciate the method to my madness. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say. {[[Help]]} may be a useful introduction to this wiki for you. Please feel free to engage me in words because this is who I am to some [[dok]]. 

Indeed, through your book as proxy, you have engaged us with words. My brother [[JRE]] and [[L]] were talking about this book you wanted him to read a while back, so I was not shocked to receive a copy. Thank you. I value the written word greatly. I appreciate the opportunity to examine your words spoken through these authors. Letterwriting and bookgiving can be powerful, and they're meant to be. Now I must ask you a question to which I somewhat fear the answer: do you really want to know what I think and how I feel about this book?<<ref "w">>

It matters to me that you are actually interested in what I have to say about the book you sent.<<ref "f">> Do you really wish to incur the cost of engaging in this text with us?<<ref "c">> If not, I would like to understand why. I want to understand your motivation and goals in our relationship.<<ref "y">> I'm using a [[T42T]] (Golden Rule-based) strategy with you, and I hope for us to be transparently explicit out in this open desert.

Despite how weird or stupid I may look in this wiki, I legitimately aim to make {[[My Faith|Principles]]} as rational as I possibly can.<<ref "r">> I will wrestle hard with the book you sent us.<<ref "n">> Even a cursory glance through this wiki should demonstrate to you that I am clearly open to the possibility that I am radically wrong. Are you? Will you pay the same price of openness to being radically wrong on our behalf? You test all of our faiths in this gift. Thank you for the opportunity.

Here's where I'm working on it: [[Jesus Among Secular Gods: The Countercultural Claims of Christ]]. My [[wife|k0sh3k]] asked me to stop at the first chapter, since it's a fine stopping place to see what you think. This is me taking you and your beliefs very seriously.<<ref "i">> I want you to see that I've fired up my CPU on all cores for you, and I'm not playing a game here. I don't expect you to try as hard as I have, necessarily, but I do expect you to at least charitably attempt to understand where I'm coming from. 

We should also address another 900-pound gorilla in the room: we may be involved in a social triangle which includes my donors, [[MWF]] and [[SLT]]. My dispute with them is not with you. I do not wish to interfere with your relationship with them. I appreciate your desire to reach out to us despite this complication.

I suspect you have only heard their side of the story; I'm trying to give you the chance to hear mine as clearly and kindly as I can say it.<<ref "l">> Given what may be completely unfounded suspicions,<<ref "x">> I ask you to forgive me for not knowing if you act on my donors' behalf or to what extent they influence your perceptions of reality here. You have been kind to us, and I seek to repay you in kind. Thinking about your book and writing this letter has been no small task.

It's no accident that all three of their sons, the people who know them best, actively avoid them to varying [[dok]]. I'm not sure how you interpret the situation or who we are.<<ref "a">> It's likely the case we have radically different experiences and understandings of the events and people in question. I suggest you put on your charity lenses, even if that means calling into doubt what you thought you knew about people you love.<<ref "z">> Of course, that doesn't mean you will agree with me. This side conflict is inevitably integrated into our relationship though, and so we have to look at it together.

My transparency is no accident; in their case, it's partly a matter of vindication.<<ref "m">> I'm not here to convince you, but I do aim to give you a bridge to see it from my side. You should know: this wiki actually started two years ago as a letter to my donors: [[2016.10.17 -- Letter to Mom and Dad]].<<ref "h">> Since then, I have written at length about these issues. If you intend to step in between as a middleman proxy or third-party, rather than watching on the sidelines, I hope you are prepared to reason extremely carefully with me.

I beg you to be incredibly honest with yourselves and me. I'm going to wager I've spent far more time thinking about this issue than you have, and so I ask you address my argument carefully if you think it is wrong (which it very well may be). Tell me what you're thinking.<<ref "k">> You are hereby granted the right to say exactly what you need to say, the right to have the last word between us, and the right to demand my charity or re-evaluation (tell me I've strawmanned you, that I'm radically wrong, that I've misrepresented the facts, or that I need to get my head on straight). I'm listening. 

Ask yourself how many letters like this you've received in your life. This is an important moment in our relationship. It's possible you'll never receive another one like it again in your lifetime, and I'd like you to think about the nature of that uniqueness. Please take as much time as you need to respond. I aim to give you a bridge to cross, even if you can't cross it right now.<<ref "v">> I really do love you. 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]

<<footnotes "wf" "You can find my wife's response here: http://bookwyrm.philosopher.life/#JASG%3A%20A%26J">>

<<footnotes "d" "For the record, this letter (and wiki more generally) is meant to be read on a desktop or laptop. It's not very mobile friendly, and I apologize for the inconvenience.">>

<<footnotes "g" "Knowing you are both highly intelligent people (who downplay it) possessing excellent research skills, I know that may be something you elect to do.">>

<<footnotes "s" "I've said exactly that on this wiki before: [[2018.03.25 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Uncle Memory]].">>

<<footnotes "wg" "I suppose I'm also open to the possibility that [[MWF]] and [[SLT]] have sent this through you. I do not know. I don't think you would send us anything you didn't really believe and agree to though.">>

<<footnotes "t" "You would not believe how much time and energy has gone into this wiki. Consider Everquest to have been a timesink teaser compared to this one. I throw down in this space. By line count, this wiki is about 6 times larger than //War and Peace// (I'd wager it only has 3% of the quality though, lol).">>

<<footnotes "w" "One could offer the argument this book was strictly intended for my wife. I think that would be disingenuous, especially since you also suggested it for my brother [[JRE]].">>

<<footnotes "f" "Perhaps I am paranoically judgmental. Please call me out on it. I apologize for even being worried about the possibility that you might fire-and-forget a preachy salvo to us without actively listening. I suggest it would be difficult to preach to my fairly complex context without understanding it first.">>

<<footnotes "c" "This book is in my academic wheelhouse/bailiwick. I would offer chemistry books to you AA and music books to you UJ with epistemic humility because I suspect you have been down these paths far more than I.">>

<<footnotes "y" "I suggest that while we care about each other, there's a sense in which we barely know each other. I can't even recall the last time I revealed myself to you, and that's despite my fairly strong memory. Of course, I am in no small part to blame for this. Relatedly, I hope you don't believe I'm abusively sarcastic, as the shirt you sent me might unintentionally imply (or even passive aggressively be wielded as tone policing). As an autistic man, I would argue I tear flesh (σαρκασμός) with my exacting literality rather than sarcasm.">>

<<footnotes "r" "Which is far from the claim that I'm doing a good job in my context.">>

<<footnotes "n" "Will you think about my terrifying wrestling? Will you attempt to empathize with my position? If not, why should I empathize with yours?">>

<<footnotes "i" "I would argue I've intensely approached these issues for decades.">>

<<footnotes "l" "I think you should take the time to hear what my brothers have to say as well.">>

<<footnotes "x" "For example, I grievously suspect you would prefer your daughter not visit or maintain physical ties to at least two of your nephews in some respects, and I wouldn't be surprised to find you've been influenced to do so.">>

<<footnotes "m" "Matthew 18:16">>

<<footnotes "a" "I can only assume that the truth between such disputes lay somewhere in between the opposing parties.">>

<<footnotes "z" "If you would like, I could walk you through my understanding of a couple of your past relationships as a guide to what I'm talking about. We have all been wrong before at this level. It's possible I am wrong here too.">>

<<footnotes "h" "Although, you can certainly find much older writing of mine which has been grafted into this tree.">>

<<footnotes "k" "If you think I'm crazy, evil, wrong, or confused, then show me why. Everyone thinks they're right because it's so difficult to act on the assumption they aren't.">>

<<footnotes "v" "This wiki is contained in a single html file. You can save it for offline viewing and your records.">>
