!! What kinds of thoughts help you fall asleep at night? 

Any which don't require any real thought. Anything exciting, anxiety-inducing, or sensitivity-triggering is off the list. I have always had a very hard time falling asleep. For many years, I slept very few hours, and it was one of the causes of my psychosis. Sleep helps me so much. I've tried many tactics and substances. Few work at all.

At the moment, the best thoughts are stories from shows that feel benign and I've watched a thousand times. Watching Futurama, Venture Bros, The Office, etc. allows me to relax. I can drift off into the story. As long as I shield myself from the blue light, I can fall asleep. I eventually wake up just long enough to hit the spacebar to turn it off and go back to sleep. This is the most consistent way of rocking myself to sleep.

In other words, I need to forcibly distract myself with these stories so that I don't think. Once I'm thinking, I can't sleep. I have a strong psychological dependence and reaction to thinking. I have to pacify myself. At this point, I'm going to stick with what works.
