title: 2019.04.16 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Intellectual Servility

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
The intellectual tradition is one of servility to power, and if I didn't betray it I'd be ashamed of myself.
<<<

That is how writing began. We kept financial records. Memeplexes that were previously passed down exclusively through oral traditions became encoded on paper, and realpolitik writing enabled new and more timely distributions of ideologies. Entire empires have been built upon communication networks.

I'm not sure how to define intellection, even though [[Saint Aristotle]] has so kindly pointed the way. I think the notion of "intellectual tradition" is specified here well past intellection onto rather a class of individuals who are paid to use their intelligence generally in service to those who pay them. There are exceptions; it has been dangerous to be a Leftist academic in some contexts.

It's pretty easy to see how most scholars end up serving the powerful. [[Saint Chomsky]] is a shining example to us all of spending his social capital for what is [[right]].
