title: 2018.07.11 - Deep Reading: Lost in the Cosmos

I'm stuck thinking about 102 and 103. Most of this book is flying by, but once we start hitting his take on semiotics, and imho, the post-Kantian tradition, I have to slow down. Maybe I'm just bad at this. That's okay! I'll do my best. (I suppose it doesn't help that I don't take but 5 minutes [sometimes 30 seconds] to take a dump anymore...all that fiber).

The world of signs. I keep hearing about Joyce's //Finnegan's Wake// fucking everywhere. My wife is going to kill me. I think we need to read this book together. I need us to think about H.C. Earwicker's world.
