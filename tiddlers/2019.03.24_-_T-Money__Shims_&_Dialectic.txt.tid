I removed too. Much material. When making cigar box guitar and change the string to neck highght way to high.
SUN 2:42 PM
Ah.
SUN 2:42 PM
Well, I'm sure you'll get it where you want it. =)
SUN 2:42 PM
Made some metal shims and was able to bring it back to "low" action limits. Where is where I like to play my electrics.
SUN 2:42 PM
Thankfully no tapered shim necessary those can get a pain. They sell these shims (in wood) online for like $10 a piece. Lol.

SUN 9:00 PM
It lives. Sounds good.
SUN 9:00 PM
More of a show of guitar. Not. My skillz. But had a few question. If it worked.  Lol.
SUN 9:02 PM
Wanted to. Show off the guitar. And that it works. Lol.
SUN 9:03 PM
Not. Like. I work. On helicopters or anything.
SUN 9:03 PM
Lol
SUN 9:03 PM
How r u? Weekend coming to an end.
SUN 9:03 PM
Getting sick, but otherwise, it was relaxing and productive.
SUN 9:04 PM
What kind of sickness? Allergies? It is that time. Of year.
SUN 9:38 PM
No idea.
SUN 9:38 PM
Hoping allergies.

I sent kilcoyn this meme and I sware to God we have been arguing for the last hour.
SUN 9:39 PM
I love that guy. But I don't get it.
SUN 9:40 PM
I've been there. But I can't stay there.
SUN 9:40 PM
I don't get it.
SUN 9:40 PM
And using scripture to justify just as quickly as I quote gospel to rectify.
SUN 9:41 PM
I appreciate his passion? Lol
SUN 9:41 PM
SUN 9:41 PM
This if for you though.
SUN 9:42 PM
Lol
SUN 9:42 PM
Aye, you sent me both before. =)
SUN 9:42 PM
Damn it.
SUN 9:42 PM
Forgive. Me. I'm. Bored. Drunk high.... You know the drill. Baiting folks into arguments.
SUN 9:42 PM
Cigar box guitar was still cool. I am proud of that
SUN 9:43 PM
It's a shit job. But. My first try.
SUN 9:43 PM
I will. Make. Another.
SUN 9:43 PM
I had fun doing it despitey back pain.. Something to do. Other than watch TV.
SUN 9:44 PM
Gonna try to read tomorrow.
SUN 9:44 PM
Seems to work well. Why build more?
SUN 9:56 PM
What you going to read?
SUN 9:57 PM
I have a Vonnegut book. I have Thomas. Jefferson book. I have tons of books I bought to read but haven't.
SUN 9:57 PM
I. Love Christopher Moore. He is the funniest I've ever read.
SUN 9:58 PM
I think I have a new one of his. My wife buys then all
SUN 9:58 PM
I gotta get back into reading books more as well.
SUN 9:58 PM
Sometimes I'll a run, but then it just dies on me.

SUN 10:11 PM
Aye. That's not socialism or communism.
SUN 10:11 PM
Socialism is when the workers own the means of production.
SUN 10:11 PM
MF you ain't gotta tell me.
SUN 10:12 PM
Clarifying, just in case*
SUN 10:12 PM
I'll draw you a graph and run a regression model.
SUN 10:12 PM
Sweet
SUN 10:12 PM
Either way. I got a million dollars  idea.
SUN 10:13 PM
Shoot
SUN 10:13 PM
Boat engines. High hp.
SUN 10:13 PM
Even the jap engines yamaha and honda are running in the double thousands for 200+ hp
SUN 10:14 PM
In competition with mer, Johnson, evinrude
SUN 10:14 PM
I don't believe there is a direct tarrif on boat engines.
SUN 10:14 PM
This is an extension of the auto industry.
SUN 10:15 PM
Most boats are cheap, the engine is twice or more the costs of the boat.
SUN 10:15 PM
Why isn't kia, or a Chinese mfg capitolized on this untapped market.
SUN 10:15 PM
The mechanics are the same as a 4-6cyl engine. Either 2 stroke or 4 stroke (4 being the new phase)
SUN 10:16 PM
For boats. It's a automotive engine upright withba a shaft to a lower gear box to propeller 90 degree turn.
SUN 10:17 PM
It is not fuxking rocket science. But find a 250hp boat engine for less than 20k.
SUN 10:18 PM
Hell. Half the bass boats are giving away the boats to just buy the engine.
SUN 10:18 PM
You can get boats on the reg for cheap with no engine.
SUN 10:18 PM
The tiller style. Engines are opening up to cheapwr and cheaper replacements.
SUN 10:19 PM
But the big engines are not competitive.
SUN 10:19 PM
Make a 200hp engine that is less than $5k new with wsrrenty.
SUN 10:20 PM
And you will undercut all competition
SUN 10:20 PM
Neat.
SUN 10:20 PM
Sounds like you have a logistics problem to solve now.
SUN 10:22 PM
I have already lost interest. There is a reason why. I suspect tarrifs, subsidies, or the like. Whatever protection measures they can. Also a boat is strictly a luxury item. Very elastic with markets.
SUN 10:27 PM
Sales are up for now, I believe.
SUN 10:28 PM
But, I anticipate a deeper recession/depression.
SUN 10:28 PM
That is going to tank.
SUN 10:28 PM
If the research and development isn't cheap, and I can't reverse engineer a Honda or yamaha engine. I don't know it Is worth the efforts.
SUN 10:28 PM
Sounds like you need more experts to work with you.
SUN 10:29 PM
Most 4cyl small automobile. Engines do. Not exceed 200hpnwithout super charger or turbo charger.
SUN 10:29 PM
A 6 cyl. Is not what the market isnot competitive wi th.
SUN 10:30 PM
I've thought it about as far as I want to go. I would like to look at it with another good. Mind.
SUN 10:30 PM
This could not/ would. Not be a garage style. Endeavor.
SUN 10:31 PM
No doubt, lol
SUN 10:31 PM
But I think there is a huge market for cheap. High hp marine engines with good service and warranties.
SUN 10:32 PM
Because currently the big contenders have no competition
SUN 10:32 PM
Image attached to message
SUN 10:35 PM
When a 10+ year old. Engine bring more than a 10+ year old automobile. There is an obvious overprice
SUN 10:35 PM
Aye.

SUN 10:39 PM
It's a fine idea.
SUN 10:39 PM
It does with me. Kia has the technology. So does Tesla and cherry in. China. And BMW or VW
SUN 10:39 PM
Dies with
SUN 10:40 PM
Not enough dealers. You would. Have to get boad mfg to sell with their boats the new engines and have local service techs.... It's simply le in. My head.
SUN 10:41 PM
Oh well
 I don't have hea desire it the capitol. Someone willl steal. My idea and beat me to. It.
SUN 10:41 PM
Aye.
SUN 10:42 PM
The high hp ratings are reached in aircraft engines that are horizontally opposed. Usually air cooled and easy to work on with high rate of reliability.
SUN 10:46 PM
Maybe utilizing a aircraft engine mfg who is better suited for reliability may be a suitable match for the engineering. And just created a new name but use cheaper Chinese parts.
SUN 10:48 PM
Assemble in USA to help. Establish sales.
SUN 10:48 PM
Meh
 It has potential.
SUN 10:48 PM
I can see the potential. So many missing pieces, and even if you put them together, I'm not convinced you would be the one reaping the rewards.
SUN 10:49 PM
Your right. With that become a special. Patent, logo, and hardcore marketing.
SUN 10:50 PM
Need a pretty face and a good salesman.
SUN 10:50 PM
Or just a. Good salesman.
SUN 10:51 PM
And a good bluffing laywetm
SUN 10:51 PM
Could always half assed the idea get a prototype and sell to one of the big mfg. To keep you put in f the market.
SUN 10:52 PM
Selfish but profitable.
SUN 10:52 PM
Out of *
SUN 10:52 PM
Shit, I could start the marketing before the prototype existed.
SUN 10:54 PM
Much profit to be made off cheap labor.
SUN 10:55 PM
Or good marketing. Quality commercials. A badass looking "cheap" engine.
SUN 10:56 PM
Pretty guys and girls. On a boad going fast.
SUN 10:56 PM
Price named on website. Taking order. Warrwntly clear. Notify dealers in certain regions as sellers for the release...
SUN 10:57 PM
Then sell the company
SUN 10:57 PM
Lol
SUN 10:57 PM
The American way.
SUN 10:57 PM
Thanks for entertaining my hair brained idea. Lol
SUN 11:01 PM
Lol. It's interesting. Not a problem. I like thinking about it.
SUN 11:02 PM
The ideas keep me from pure craziness. Lol. If I had the balls I could follow my dreams.
SUN 11:03 PM
Rite aide shut down due to wall greens buying them out. Awesome plays for a party city style store.
SUN 11:03 PM
Children's BDay party locations is a great idea. A warm po for winter pool parties would be a $ maker.
SUN 11:04 PM
Jump. House here is booked months in advanced.
SUN 11:05 PM
It's of potential if I had capitol
SUN 11:05 PM
I believe that information will be handed out in return for privacy losses.
SUN 11:05 PM
Lots*
SUN 11:05 PM
(and primarily for the sake of more effective marketing in general)
SUN 11:05 PM
Potentially. My anxiety will always keep. Me making the jump untill forced.
SUN 11:07 PM
But Im not dead in the water. Lol
SUN 11:08 PM
Options, always.
SUN 11:08 PM
I've seen car washes go from zero to multiple employees. And electricians grow too big and decide to downsize because to toocuh work and toany workers.
SUN 11:09 PM
That's why I love capitolism.
SUN 11:09 PM
I can see that about you.
SUN 11:10 PM
It's ok. I make my lively hood off the government. I'm a box of contradictions.
SUN 11:11 PM
Lol
SUN 11:11 PM
Attempting to resolve the contradiction may be your epistemic duty.
SUN 11:12 PM
I think that's part of integrity, in constructing ourselves, in trying to make sense of who are and should be.
SUN 11:12 PM
My duty is to my family. All else be damned.
SUN 11:13 PM
Very Christ-like of you
SUN 11:14 PM
Not at all. Selfish nonsense.
SUN 11:14 PM
That is why I adore you btw: you are often a man of profound honesty. It is a rare attribute.
SUN 11:15 PM
Thank you. Lol. Life. Is hard enough. Truth comes much easier than a lie. At least by my own account.
SUN 11:17 PM
I don't believe the truth will set you free, or if your honest with yourself, you csn lie to no one
 Both rubbish.
SUN 11:18 PM
But being honest with yourself feels better and is easier.
SUN 11:18 PM
Emotion driven. Guilt. Is a bitch.
SUN 11:19 PM
I suggest telling you the truth sets you free of some things. I agree that lying to the ax-murderer or Nazi at our doorstep is sometimes our moral duty.
SUN 11:19 PM
I think it's especially valuable to be honest with ourselves when it hurts and isn't easier.
SUN 11:19 PM
"aye" but that lie come easy for self preservation.
SUN 11:20 PM
Some of the most talented sociopaths have learned to lie to themselves in just the right moments, and then they can tell themselves the truths everywhere else.
SUN 11:20 PM
It is why I believe that even evil can be well integrated to a large extent
SUN 11:20 PM
Indeed.
SUN 11:21 PM
Economics shows is that I. Public policy. Gone wrong
SUN 11:21 PM
Us... In*
SUN 11:21 PM
Continued forceful policies with great intent but horrible results.
SUN 11:22 PM
And lies to overshadow the truth.
SUN 11:22 PM
And why every realan should despise any who claim to be a politician..
SUN 11:23 PM
We may disagree on the efficacy of economics as the tool of political enlightenment in many contexts. I am a fan of game theory though.
SUN 11:23 PM
But what do I know? =)
SUN 11:23 PM
My son and I have been discussing this game theory strategy called Pavlov. If always defect and Tit-for-two-tats had a baby, it would be Pavlov.
SUN 11:24 PM
Is not Pavlov conditioning?
SUN 11:26 PM
Aye, that's a related subject, but this is just the name of a strategy.
SUN 11:26 PM
Economic game. Theory. Is very interesting. Probabaly the. Most Influwntial of all. Is that of altruism.
SUN 11:27 PM
The idea is that it plays T42T, but it will randomly elect to vampirically drain highly cooperative players until they start to defect in retaliation, then they reset, and then somewhere down the random road, they start the Pavlovian Vampiric Defection again.
SUN 11:27 PM
Altruism is a learned trait. Not innate.
SUN 11:27 PM
That is not so clear.
SUN 11:28 PM
Case theory says otherwise.
SUN 11:28 PM
I'll. Have to find. My source. I wrote papers on it.
SUN 11:28 PM
Evolutionary Biology says otherwise.
SUN 11:28 PM
Go for it. I think you're wrong.
SUN 11:29 PM
Caryn Vazzana had her phd in game theory.
SUN 11:29 PM
I was well taught. Imho
SUN 11:29 PM
Worth thinking about. =)
SUN 11:29 PM
It is specific. To age.
SUN 11:30 PM
I. Have the papers. I kept. Everything from. College.
SUN 11:30 PM
I disagree with many of my papers from college.
SUN 11:31 PM
Many things change, progress is made. It's been a while since we were both in college.
SUN 11:31 PM
As do I, but the research still is there
SUN 11:31 PM
Cool. Show me.
SUN 11:32 PM
It is a valuable subject to me.
SUN 11:33 PM
Let me say up front: I am not convinced we are not free to escape psychological egoism.
SUN 11:33 PM
It's a good article. I'm reading it now.
SUN 11:33 PM
But I. Will. Send you a. Link. Since you read so. Much quicker than me.
SUN 11:34 PM
I recognize the author. I "think" this. Is the article
SUN 11:34 PM
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.08.023.2009/full
SUN 11:34 PM
So, why should we think there are no innate altruism traits from this paper?
SUN 11:39 PM
Are some people not genetically predisposed?
SUN 11:39 PM
I'm still reading. You. Can't old. Me. To one source I read a decade ago.
SUN 11:39 PM
Hold
SUN 11:39 PM
Lol
SUN 11:40 PM
Many of the algorithms we cognitively run become embedded in our limbic system, and some of those eventually find their way in our genes too.
SUN 11:40 PM
Gimme. A. Break speed. Reader.
SUN 11:40 PM
To. Summerize, my previous research, potentially. Not. Quoted in this article.
SUN 11:41 PM
Young children play economic games.
SUN 11:41 PM
With m&ms. They take as. Much as they can
SUN 11:41 PM
As they grow. And learn. They share ewually.
SUN 11:42 PM
Equally.
SUN 11:42 PM
It was a repeatable event of. Economic game behavioral. Theory and it includes the ever present free rider condition which has and will always keep. Me from appriciating socialism at its. Most basic of terms
SUN 11:43 PM
That some altruistic behavior is learned does not mean there are no innate or genetic predispositions.
SUN 11:44 PM
I think your selfishness is the root of that, homie.
SUN 11:44 PM
Even though despite the altruism shines thru, the free riders are always there.
SUN 11:44 PM
Enough T42T will defeat free riders.
SUN 11:45 PM
That is also game theory.
SUN 11:45 PM
We just have to punish selfish people effectively.
SUN 11:45 PM
I agree it is unlikely to succeed.
SUN 11:46 PM
Does. Capitolists. Not already. Do. That?
SUN 11:46 PM
But, what makes something morally obligated is not necessarily about picking the side most likely to win.
SUN 11:46 PM
Capitolism
SUN 11:46 PM
It. Punishes free riders as well as dumbasses.
SUN 11:47 PM
I don't claim to. Be selfless. By no means.
SUN 11:47 PM
Are you asking if capitalism effectively punishes selfishness?
SUN 11:47 PM
I asked the question. Then answered it as in it punishes free riders and dumbasses alike.
SUN 11:49 PM
I suppose we may have differences of opinion on what counts as freeriding and being a dumbass.
SUN 11:50 PM
I. Don't think. We do. But you are. Much more passionate than I. Am. About. This subject.
SUN 11:51 PM
We probably don't, lol. But, I may be more passionate about it.
SUN 11:52 PM
The disagreement isn't worth an emotional impact to our friendship. I will. Gladly give you. What you want to. Hear to move on.
SUN 11:53 PM
Oh no, I prefer your honesty.
SUN 11:54 PM
I am that convinced you need to see what I'm saying.
SUN 11:54 PM
I'm. Not.
SUN 11:54 PM
It is a costly thing to see.
SUN 11:55 PM
It is irrelevant.
SUN 11:55 PM
Hardly, it is The Moral Law.
SUN 11:55 PM
We. Live. In. A dog. Eat dog. World
SUN 11:55 PM
And, we don't have to. It's a choice.
SUN 11:55 PM
Sharpen your teeth good. Sir.
SUN 11:55 PM
=)
SUN 11:55 PM
You missed your age of reason and intellect. Just as I missed the age of honor and integrity.
SUN 11:57 PM
I don't follow you.
SUN 11:57 PM
We live in. Memea and 140 charters.
SUN 11:57 PM
Memes
SUN 11:57 PM
And, we don't have to!
SUN 11:58 PM
You cannot change the mind if the masses. If you plan to, how so?
SUN 11:58 PM
Our children?
SUN 11:58 PM
We had to few.
SUN 11:59 PM
A cult?
SUN 11:59 PM
It is extremely unlikely that I will change the minds of the masses. Impossibility is another matter.
SUN 11:59 PM
I think some portion of the population is fighting to be moral though. Even our own age group is waking to socialism.
SUN 11:59 PM
"aye" and this disagreement is all for naught.
SUN 11:59 PM
(some more effectively than others)
SUN 11:59 PM
What is any disagreement ever for?
1 HR AGO
Once we determine the ends, perhaps you'll find the means aren't for naught.
1 HR AGO
The division is absurd. In our own age group. Individuals waste time whining and crying and protesting rather than logic reason, economics and mathematics.
1 HR AGO
Hm.
1 HR AGO
That might be right. =)
1 HR AGO
If I cannot argue my case for. Free market economics with a small safety net, without absurd insults, why waste my time?
1 HR AGO
If the socialist chooses reading over. Mathematics. Has he not lost?
1 HR AGO
And I am afraid that is where we stand. Not you and I... But the motivated
1 HR AGO
The masses are ignorant on. Both fronts....
1 HR AGO
Aye, Virtue is Knowledge. It's very hard to distribute it.
1 HR AGO
Why the fuck are we so deep on a Sunday night?
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
Lol.
1 HR AGO
That's where I usually am every night.
1 HR AGO
Just popped up here for us. Lol.
1 HR AGO
I am. Not. I "spent my time" mired in the belly of the beast. Crunching the numbers.
1 HR AGO
And this is old conversation for us. On many accord.
1 HR AGO
It is the hazard of being my friend.
1 HR AGO
There is a common misconception that capitolism. Is a fixed pie.
1 HR AGO
It. Is not.
1 HR AGO
That one must suffer for the other to gain.
1 HR AGO
This is not true.
1 HR AGO
And the biggest fallacy of socialist.

Damn it [[h0p3]].
1 HR AGO
That's unfair.
1 HR AGO
You took the inebriated articulations. Of a cornered aircraft mechanic. And attempted to rial. Me. Into. The same discussion we are having now.
1 HR AGO
To be fair, I'm inebriated too!
1 HR AGO
Hazards of being your friend.
1 HR AGO
"aye"
1 HR AGO
I'm quoting thay becuase it's dumb
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
Let me ask you this honest question.
1 HR AGO
Shoot
1 HR AGO
Does it matter that I care nor about you and your families wellbeing and happiness than I do arguing over economics and politics? Thay I genuinely want to. Learn mor about you and not the inebriated ramblings of a washed up philosopher vs economist.
1 HR AGO
We we taught in undergrad by a butler who did her undergrad in economics and Steele who did his undergrad in philosophy
1 HR AGO
Steele doesn't even work in the business department. Cause he couldn't do the math
1 HR AGO
Great at public policy though. I learned alot from him.
1 HR AGO
He works in student life
1 HR AGO
I care more *
1 HR AGO
I think well-being and happiness are keywords in philosophy. I do not reduce them down to mere hedonia. I think eudaimonia (something like "flourishing") is far more accurate.  More importantly, I'm interested in justified eudaimonia. What does it mean for us to be concerned with each others' identities? What does it mean to want the best for the other?
1 HR AGO
I am convinced it is valuable to your persistent identity to wrestle with me on this.
1 HR AGO
I'm convinced it's valuable to the people around you too, including your family.,
1 HR AGO
I can't wrestle my back. Is Injuried.
1 HR AGO
I do not disagree with people for fun.
1 HR AGO
rofl, that's true.
1 HR AGO
I've seen the smirk. You. Enjoy a good. Debate.
1 HR AGO
Ah, it's not like I don't have fun, but that is not worth my time.
1 HR AGO
I have much easier ways to achieve pleasure.
1 HR AGO
No, I actually give a shit about you, T-Money.
1 HR AGO
I love you.
1 HR AGO
I love you to. Man.
1 HR AGO
And that's why I. Don't give a shit about big words and justifying. My. Emotion.
1 HR AGO
Lol!
1 HR AGO
I feel, my brain says, my heart says. Text [[h0p3]], how is he doing.
1 HR AGO
I run into this exact problem constantly. I can appreciate how love is going to rely upon significant non-cognitive components.
1 HR AGO
https://philosopher.life/#Love:Love
1 HR AGO
You attempted to quantify that in your article. On love.
1 HR AGO
Yes.
1 HR AGO
I already read it.
1 HR AGO
And, it is pertinent here.
1 HR AGO
Its identifies the irrational. Behavior of love.
1 HR AGO
In the same way economista cannot exist lain honor, integrity, and the anomalies.
1 HR AGO
So we kick them out of the theory.
1 HR AGO
Run the model. And bam. Opportunity costs. Makes sense
1 HR AGO
But not about the guy who. Won't sell out cause. His grandpa. Started the business
1 HR AGO
I think economics as a perfected science, in its ideal form, is a complete description of the possible variations and probabilities of human psychology (likely multi-disciplinary look using a computational theory of mind).  It aims to eventually take into account and describe honor and that guy who won't sell out (among many other appearances of exceptions to their current models).
1 HR AGO
Note, of course, that description is not the same as prescription.
1 HR AGO
I think your love isn't just an emotional desire; it's got significant cognitive components. That's why love exists in virtue of autonomy. It's a whole-brained activity.
1 HR AGO
Economics It is not a perfect science. Even in its ideal form. It is a social science. It is why there is only one scientific law in economics.
1 HR AGO
The law of supply and demand.
1 HR AGO
Everything else is pure theory.
1 HR AGO
I agree it will likely never be perfected, but I will agree to that about every science.
1 HR AGO
Physics had laws
1 HR AGO
Still does.
1 HR AGO
They are repeatable and proven.
1 HR AGO
We're trying to model the laws of physics. And, no, physics is in deep trouble.
1 HR AGO
Still, it is arguably has the best p-values of any of the sciences.
1 HR AGO
tested into oblivion
1 HR AGO
I never studied physics. But I know 9.8mps^2

Maybe it's not squared.

I don't disagree with your wealth of knowledge. I don't claim to know more than you on any subject. But I have my opinions. And. Like everyone, opinions change as do People. I have no Interest in reatusying. Economics if I only have one person to talk about it with.
1 HR AGO
I cannot waste my free. Time. Buried in calculus and algebra and drawing delta chages to graphs of theory to attempt to justify to anyone my opinions.
1 HR AGO
justification is very expensive, I can appreciate that.
1 HR AGO
On capitolism. In reality. It would. Be just regurgitation of my previous learnings.
1 HR AGO
That is an opinion.
1 HR AGO
(I am the worst, I know)
1 HR AGO
Much smarter men have dedicated their lives to a subject that I am. Unqualified to talk to except in the aircraft hanger in the masses.
1 HR AGO
There is so much to. Learn. Why go back?
1 HR AGO
I soaked up what I could.
1 HR AGO
Nows it's time. I practice and study. My golf swing?
1 HR AGO
Lol
1 HR AGO
I spend a great deal of time revisiting my previous beliefs; it's been invaluable to me in learning all the new stuff too.
1 HR AGO
You must forgive me but I aim to learn more, and do more.
1 HR AGO
In mechanics, in fixing my home, making guitars look. Like. Something they aren't.
1 HR AGO
I realize you want to think about and work on different things.
1 HR AGO
I do not see the value in challenging you.
1 HR AGO
Aye. I can see that.
1 HR AGO
Donald trum. Is president. Where do we go from. Here?
1 HR AGO
I have lost faith in politics. In economists.
1 HR AGO
In businessmen.
1 HR AGO
What do you have faith in?
1 HR AGO
I had faith in my ability. And that has been robbed of me.
1 HR AGO
I have faith in my wife and my child.
1 HR AGO
And I try to have faith in God
1 HR AGO
I have lost a lot of faith too. =/ It's hard to have hope. I'm sorry.
1 HR AGO
I still. Have faith in myself, but it is changing as I learn more about my diagnosis and my ability to work with it.
1 HR AGO
No need to apologize. It is not our fault.
1 HR AGO
Greed and corruption has ruined this world. America. I. Have ideas. But they are short sighted and not nearly as radical as you desire.
1 HR AGO
But again, it is all for naught when the masses keep flocking to the very stores they complain are too big.
58 MIN AGO
I am at fault too.
58 MIN AGO
I suggest I am as pessimistic as you are. I agree I'm at fault too.
57 MIN AGO
There can be only one permanent revolution — a moral one; the regeneration of the inner man...How is this revolution to take place? Nobody knows how it will take place in humanity, but every man feels it clearly in himself. And yet in our world everybody thinks of changing humanity, and nobody thinks of changing himself.

– Leo Tolstoy, Three Methods Of Reform
57 MIN AGO
Kinda an empty observation?
56 MIN AGO
Not to discredit it.
55 MIN AGO
But he did that already.
55 MIN AGO
Maybe not empty, but somehow rare common sense.
55 MIN AGO
It is easier to keep quiet and wait for the moment. Teach the children. They are out home. No change is coming in this decade.
54 MIN AGO
Opinion.
53 MIN AGO
I agree it is easier.
53 MIN AGO
I ask you, why have you not taken up the sword and shield and climbed the proverbial ladder?
52 MIN AGO
=)
52 MIN AGO
Give me time.
52 MIN AGO
I have faith in you. But sober and focused.
51 MIN AGO
Even now, I spearfish.
51 MIN AGO
My work on Atropos is non-trivial.
50 MIN AGO
The Original Position
50 MIN AGO
I certainly aim to be practical, including transparently building a model of my mind in a wiki. May it serve many purposes.
49 MIN AGO
But your presence makes those who know you cower. Is it wise to sit at the desk? Is the battle won in the tent or on the battle Field?
47 MIN AGO
Those in power sit at desks.
47 MIN AGO
I have many enemies to slay.
47 MIN AGO
As Voltaire says: "To hold a pen is to be at war."
46 MIN AGO
If I am correct in my predictions of the future, it will not be me fighting, it will be an machine-learned model of my wiki which fights against all the others.
45 MIN AGO
I will need to be a very dangerous 1v1 PvP artist to survive.
45 MIN AGO
"Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger not to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay"
44 MIN AGO
I will continue to persuade and identify to the emotional side.
39 MIN AGO
I am reading your wiki on 1v1 and pvp
39 MIN AGO
And I'm confused.
39 MIN AGO
Do you expect robots with artificial. Intelligence will. Be the fight aganist?
38 MIN AGO
There will be robots, but I assume the most powerful AI's will require far more space than a humanoid form (though, bodies can just be remote shells).
37 MIN AGO
I anticipate that one day I will be able to build a machine-learned model of my wiki to speak with. Perhaps, if I'm lucky, it can teach me in my own language, scour the web for information, improve itself given my own principles, and act as my proxy and representative.
35 MIN AGO
One of the problems with general AI is that we can't trust what's inside the blackbox.
34 MIN AGO
I, however, can trust a model that is built upon a corpus of my writing.
34 MIN AGO
If I trust the process and the writing (and I think I could manage both), then I will be able to have faith in that blackbox.
34 MIN AGO
Too much asimov
34 MIN AGO
=)
33 MIN AGO
Well, I'm here to fight for the zeroth law.
33 MIN AGO
I am too broken to look back or forward.
31 MIN AGO
I just watch my next step.
31 MIN AGO
And keep my family close in tow
30 MIN AGO
I can appreciate that. In many practical things in life, we barely hold on.
30 MIN AGO
Hope is a dream.
29 MIN AGO
h0p3 is a dream.
29 MIN AGO
But I did just open my FB. And this popped up

29 MIN AGO
Getting me rock hard again
29 MIN AGO
I'm feeling good about my odds.
29 MIN AGO
Terminator. Robots.
28 MIN AGO
Bad joke.
28 MIN AGO
lol
28 MIN AGO
I suspect mechanical. Knowledge will. Be a lot art. And in the event of an EMP. I have many ideas of sustaining life without that which requires electronics.
25 MIN AGO
Lost*
25 MIN AGO
How do. Robots survive a EMP?
24 MIN AGO
Build biological machines.
24 MIN AGO
I'll play chess against a creature with 1000 raven's brains hooked together.
23 MIN AGO
Get my ass handed to me.
23 MIN AGO
Are we not biological. Machines already?
22 MIN AGO
I cannot guess as to the mechanical. I suspect large swathes will be lost, but I assume some of it still has to exist. It is likely which more and more people will not learn though.
22 MIN AGO
Aye. I agree. We are. I assume AI will move that direction as well.
22 MIN AGO
Rare metals are rare. Biological computers can be farmed.
22 MIN AGO
Your paranoia gives. Me a. Headache.
21 MIN AGO
Lol!
21 MIN AGO
I'm sorry.
21 MIN AGO
I can't imagine how it. Makes you feel.
20 MIN AGO
A wide range of strong emotions constantly in flux.
20 MIN AGO
I get paranoid sometimes. So I practice my shot.
20 MIN AGO
I csn hit a telephone pole from 50 yarda away with a marble. And a sling shot. Did it twice in a row in front of my wife and kid. Like. Right after I said. Watch this.
19 MIN AGO
Lol
 I stopped and put it. Down.
18 MIN AGO
You won the day.
18 MIN AGO
Can't do that again
18 MIN AGO
Lol
18 MIN AGO
I worry more about the exhaust manifold leak on my truck (which is quiet tick and harmless) than I do AI.
15 MIN AGO
I worry. More about the biological People misguided by a false promise.
14 MIN AGO
I can appreciate that.
14 MIN AGO
I am convinced that machine learning will be used to centralize power in the hands of the corrupt. Those who climb the ladder of power without being moral will always have the competitive advantage. That misguidance is going to grow even more radical.
12 MIN AGO
It is possible to win though.
12 MIN AGO
I wouldn't play the game if I didn't think it was possible.
11 MIN AGO
Probably go out in the blaze of glory as some delusional schizotypal-autist, but that's okay too.
11 MIN AGO
I can only do my best.
10 MIN AGO
"Do you think... that men have always massacred each other, as they do today? Have they always been liars, cheats, traitors, brigands, weak, flighty, cowardly, envious, gluttonous, drunken, grasping, and vicious, bloody, backbiting, debauched, fanatical, hypocritical, and silly?"
10 MIN AGO
You can't keep quoting candid and leave me. Out
10 MIN AGO
=)
10 MIN AGO
Certainly anyone who has the power to make you believe absurdities has the power to make you commit injustices.
9 MIN AGO
Oh, I like this one too:
9 MIN AGO
A witty saying proves nothing.
9 MIN AGO
That dude was a beast
8 MIN AGO
Indeed. And the above quote by. Him. Is. My fav. The following line as well. I have it underlined in the book. But can't find it online
7 MIN AGO

5 MIN AGO
There it is. The response is the most powerful.
4 MIN AGO
Truly, the best of all possible worlds.
4 MIN AGO
It is the animal instinct that he identifies. But people always forget that part of the quote
4 MIN AGO
It's been an excellent discussion, T-Money. I have to get to bed so I'm not too sick to take care of kids tomorrow. TTYL.
1 MIN AGO
Good talk. Ending on a positive note. Hope you feel better. Night sir.
