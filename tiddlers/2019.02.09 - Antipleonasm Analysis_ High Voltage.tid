I'm shocked. I tell you. In part, Marx refers to this as the army of reserve labor. Say what you want about the transformation problem, for which I have no effective answer, this quote is beautifully [[redpill]]ed. We're lucky to have so many skeptics, satirists, jesters, revolutionaries, and spiritual guides. The Human Pyramids emerging out of the state of nature eventually collapse. Can we save ourselves?

This can be fixed. We can win. It's just incredibly unlikely.

I suggest revolution will eventually become technologically infeasible. That, in fact, is my prediction.<<ref "2020.02.10">>
