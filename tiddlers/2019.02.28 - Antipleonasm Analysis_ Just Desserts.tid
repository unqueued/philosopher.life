You wouldn't know the concept of merit if it slapped you in the face.  

The girl drowning in the pool next to you has a moral right over your body. You are her slave in that moment. You haven't "earned" the right to yourself. Moral earning is far more complex than you'd ever wish to present. We start out with maximin-patterned distributivist means and ends relationships in our current Hohfeldian rights. It is not apparent to me that our obligations will ever be met. You simply don't have the moral right to wealth when other people are starving (or even less extreme suffering on the maximin). Property rights to  yourself and other objects do not obtain in virtue of Libertarian acquisitions and transfers until after every Rawlsian and Marxist proviso has been met (and continues to be maintained). That's a tall order.

Self-ownership first obtains in virtue of the recognition of the [[dok]] to which you owe your life to the service of [[others]]. It's [[The Golden Rule]]. You only appear to be a moral realist in order to conveniently attempt to confabulate a justification for egoism. Indeed, I have the moral right to ensure that you are following [[The Golden Rule]]: that too is an exercise of [[The Golden Rule]]. 

You don't deserve to live. Your life is invalid to the point that we have a right for you not to exist. Congratz: you've earned a throat-slitting! Let's eat the rich.
