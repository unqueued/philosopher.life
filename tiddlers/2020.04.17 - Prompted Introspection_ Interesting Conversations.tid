title: 2020.04.17 - Prompted Introspection: Interesting Conversations

!! Did I recently have an interesting conversation?

It's cool to see how [[Weekly Family Log.tmpl]] has evolved to include a variation of this question since the last time I answered it: [[2018.07.23 - Prompted Introspection: Recent Conversation]]. //Interesting// is an awkward word. There are few humans who hold my attention for long without my purposely seeking to find our conversation interesting (I consider it part of the art of relationships, even if I'm awful at it). 

Part of my oddness is that I aim to track my conversations with people as a whole conversation. They are all interesting, although some are more interesting to me than others. Even when there's a pause or a silence in the conversation, that's part of the conversation. It's a rolling release.
