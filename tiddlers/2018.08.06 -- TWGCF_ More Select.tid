title: 2018.08.06 -- TWGCF: More Select

<<<
I actually want to go further with this keyboard-centered approach. There's the sidebar that can be made key-boardable, too... basically everything that forces me to use my mouse where under i3 I'd always just press a shortcut is a target for select-mode.

I think you're right that something like this should be in TW's codebase.

Agreed! We've talked about the sidebar before. I have very strong opinions about the sidebar. 

I know how I would like to navigate my sidebar right now (although, I'd probably change my method with more complex tooling), but I fear I am too specific (and don't know how to generalize it for everyone's usecases). 

I want to use a hotkey to enter "sidebar mode," select tabs from hotkeys, and perhaps have a mode for each tab. For example, on my Hub (https://philosopher.life/#Hub:Hub), I want to step up and down through the major sections, and then select from the links inside those lists. 

As far as I'm concerned, the sidebar is fundamental to navigating the wiki, and salient navigation of complex structures is what a wiki is all about. Keyboard control of it is necessary to allow me to "load" tiddlers into my story river.

I tried that nodejs-approach but the missing live-reload killed it for me.

YES! There are a lot of problems surrounding it.

To me, this is the one of the key areas in which Tiddlywiki could make a quantum leap. The browser's VM continues to be tightened again and again, and running a server is literally the only option around it. Unfortunately, I believe it's computationally unoptimized. I blow a whole core just to recompile every minute with nodejs. JS makes this beautiful in the browser, but the server itself needs another language, imho.

I'd want edit priority given to the CLI. 

This is no small task though, and I think most people have no use for it (at least initially).

@DemoniWaari also mentioned this search-functionality. I think I'll add the quick-search by keyboard function and then we can discuss the content of the search results...

Thanks for your feedback and thoughts!

I am very excited by this. I think it is actually an entirely different problem than keyboard navigation, and arguably an even larger problem. It would, of course, be an enormous contribution. Advanced search that a user can easily tailor to the structures they build in their own wiki is necessary. This is where the flexibility of Tiddlywiki may continue to shine for a long time to come.
