Got the sync figured out. Had to update. Delete, re add, look into archives. But all is good on pc and phone now. I admit I hadn't used hit in a few months since I got hurt.
TUE 6:34 PM
I thank you though. It has allowed me and the wife to file share large videos easily. Still not sure on how to download them and have them separate from sync.
TUE 6:37 PM
I'll get there.
TUE 6:37 PM
I apologize my letter was not engaging. It was honest and simple
TUE 7:50 PM
After I read it this morning it reminded me of a letter my grandma would send me
TUE 7:50 PM
:joy:
TUE 7:50 PM
Once you've downloaded it, use a file manager to copy it to a place separate from the sync.
TUE 7:59 PM
Your letter was fine. Thank you! =)
TUE 7:59 PM
Also, my wife adored //Nailed It//. Thank you for the recommendation.
TUE 8:34 PM
I'm glad she liked it. I thought the kids and you might to.
TUE 9:02 PM
It is family friendly.
TUE 9:02 PM
They enjoyed it too.
TUE 9:03 PM
I don't know what counts as family friendly. There was plenty of sexual humor, for example.
TUE 9:03 PM
It doesn't matter to me though. They watch everything. Hope to finish Breaking Bad with them soon (currently on the TV right now).
TUE 9:04 PM
I don't censor.
TUE 9:04 PM
Yeah, I am growing less censor. I thought the sexual humor was above most youngsters heads.
TUE 9:34 PM
Well most that aren't less censored.
TUE 9:34 PM
My child still doesn't comprehend fully how babies are made.
TUE 9:35 PM
And that is OK. She is on oar with 80% of her peers.
TUE 9:35 PM
She will begin her cycle soon as and early bloomer and the discussion will be had.
TUE 9:35 PM
Par*. I made up that #
TUE 9:36 PM
Lol. I am shocked!

In case this is ever useful: https://philosopher.life/#Phrasing%2C%20Boom%3A%20That's%20What%20She%20Said.
TUE 9:36 PM
She is isolated in a predomently white Anglo-Saxon Christian county... For us I think it's a fair #
TUE 9:37 PM
It will change in middle school.
TUE 9:37 PM
A non-trivial percentage of my students are sexually active.
TUE 9:38 PM
You lost yours young too.
TUE 9:38 PM
Still gotta ask. So you are talking with kicks condor? I watched his 10min YouTube video. Then you posted about it and he took it down quick.?
TUE 9:38 PM
It's still up.
TUE 9:39 PM
Oh. I clicked said unavailable earlier.
TUE 9:39 PM
Your both weird. But I know and like you. So it's different.
TUE 9:40 PM
Lol.
TUE 9:40 PM
I only discovered him, like I said. When googleing you and the kiddos S/Ns.
TUE 9:40 PM
I like that you are weird too, perhaps not as weird as we are.
TUE 9:40 PM
And then he popped up. I went into dad protect mode.
TUE 9:40 PM
Then I realized he is not going anywhere but enthralled with your family.
TUE 9:41 PM
Doesn't seem that he has a family.
TUE 9:41 PM
I am not surprised?
TUE 9:41 PM
Lol
TUE 9:41 PM
I am unable to determine that.
TUE 9:41 PM
He has suggested he has children, and I am convinced he is a teacher.
TUE 9:42 PM
Indeed my weirdness  is beyond me.
TUE 9:42 PM
I was going to say something to you him directly. In my nonsense letter. But all things in my head came out mean. Better I didn't. No malicious intent  have seen yet. A d you monitor much closer Tha. I have, do, or will
TUE 9:43 PM
I hear that.
TUE 9:45 PM
Also, I adore that you call it nonsense. I really liked it, and I thought it made good sense. Sincerity is going to feel like nonsense sometimes, imho.
TUE 9:47 PM
Indeed. Thanks for the encouragement.
