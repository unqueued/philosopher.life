What made the week hectic and weekend good but busy?
SEP 8 2:37 PM
Interviews and duplex shopping. Realtors and loan officers. Then we went camping this weekend and took the boat, the golf cart and the camper.

Lol. My idea. But glad to be home. And relaxing. Turned down the duplex, and logged off while fishing on the lake. Didn't catch much. Just a few bluegill. But fun no less.

How about you?

That does sound hectic. I hope the interviews went well. Hopefully, you'll find the right duplex.

Fishing sounds relaxing especially. Glad you had some fun.
