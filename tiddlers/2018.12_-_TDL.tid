!! Audit:

* I can tell I'm trying not to be monotonous here.
* This place is a source of shame, and I just need to continue being honest about it. Don't hide it. Try not to make excuses. Continue to improve. You are not absolutely helpless, sir.
* The amount of failure in here is heartbreaking to me.
** `/facepalm`
* Don't make plans with Brad. He has failed enough [[T42T]] tests.
* I even taunted myself. Lol. This is pitiful.
* This was far less job-oriented than I hoped.
** That was a mistake, dude.
*** I'm sorry.
**** You are forgiven, sir.
