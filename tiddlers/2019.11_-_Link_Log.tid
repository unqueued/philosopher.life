!! Audit:

* [[Family Time]] is more interesting for my family when I have rich link logs.
** They have to purposely set them aside to read (and, I know, there are usually at least a couple delicious things in here).
* My god, I'm holding far too many tabs. 
** Load average sits above 4, lol. That's mostly FF chewing through it (but, I'd prefer to burn the resources to limit latency and open up extensions which won't play nice together). That's fucking crazy.
* No, you should have just written the script for it. It made your first-round cut. You are wasting your time.
* I think if I did this right, I wouldn't use TW. I'd need to grow a giant ball in a real database.
* I'm glad I at least got something on the page. That's better than nothing.
** I highly doubt I'm going to get anything done this coming month though (or the next). Moving is consuming.
* What's interesting is how few links make it. 
* One of the most important skills in the world is the ability to look through a list of things which might initially appear equal and quickly pick out which ones really matter. Virtue.
