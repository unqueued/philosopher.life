How's your week going?
Mar 19 11:56am
Pretty good â€”I work for 4-6 hrs and then go home
Mar 19 11:57am
I see maybe one person each day besides Family. I think we have enough stuff so I donâ€™t need to go to the store anymore
Mar 19 11:58am
And...I think I enjoyed Enderâ€™s Shadow more than Enderâ€™s Game
Mar 19 11:59am
Howâ€™s you?
Mar 19 11:59am
Ender's Shadow is outstanding. I agree with you: it's better than Ender's Game.

Bean is a character I admire.
Mar 19 12:03pm
Yes ðŸ˜Š

Admin just decided to give us a 2 week spring break weehooo
Mar 19 4:28pm
Woot!
Mar 19 4:29pm
I hope it will be relaxing and wonderful.
Mar 19 4:29pm
Me too
Mar 19 4:30pm
Sorry I didn't answer your question, btw. I'm doing well. It's been intense. The world is in flux, and I am quite anxious.
Mar 19 4:30pm
I understand that

Also sent me down a rabbithole with Ender's Shadow: https://philosopher.life/#Identifying%20With%3A%20Fictional%20Characters

I am in denial and [[AG]] is in a mess of nerves
Mar 19 4:31pm
Even the atmosphere as I walk in the stores just feels different.
Mar 19 4:32pm
I am glad that you have a big spring break. I hope it will be exceptionally useful.
Mar 19 4:32pm
Me too
Mar 19 4:33pm
Thinking about raising a few hens for eggs
Mar 19 4:34pm
I appreciate that. Yeah, that is the feeling I have too. My predictions and reading are terrifying. I very much hope I am wrong.
Mar 19 4:36pm
Yeah just some assurance... at least we would have eggs?
Mar 19 4:37pm
Love ur list if characters! ðŸ˜Š
