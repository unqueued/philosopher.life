title: 2017.06.18 - Carpe Diem Log

* I woke up at 8ish today. I sat there for a bit. It was nice.
* Fireman time, per my new usual. I don't know why I've switched to/added mornings. What better way to start the day, eh?
* My family went off to church, and I took my DCK. 
* I tried to play a game of League before it kicked in. Towards the end, I actually just AFKed and went to lay down.
* I wrote. I was surprisingly lucid although disoriented.
* My meditations were basically completed at about the same time my family came home. We talked.
* We made chili while the kids cleaned the bathrooms.
* Instead of doing schoolwork, I cleaned my kids' room with them. 
** They still need my help, and I'm there to do it. I hope it will just click one day.
* I talked with my wife about writing. I think she has something to say. I think this is part of that vocational problem for her. I see it as part of her purpose.
* She took a nap (period, headache talking to me, plus bad weather), and I cleaned. 
* We didn't go swimming because it simply got too late. The family meeting matters.
* I surfed some.
* I wrote in my wiki.
** I may back off using "Bobert" so much since I generally want to be speaking to myself. That said, sometimes I need a different kind of adversary (Samwise Gamgee!).
* We read each other's wikis and talked quite a bit. There were several excellent discussions. 
** I'm extremely happy to see that our wikis provide a significant jumping off points for discussion and debate on top of being useful windows into each others' inner lives, etc.
* ALM called, but I didn't call him back until later since we were in the middle of our family meeting.
* We did our Family Log
** It went quite well. 
** We considered having a constructive criticism section, and I hope to get there. I don't think we are ready for it. I need more time to reflect on how to implement it wisely and kindly.
* My wife went over their school structure while I returned ALM's call.
** We talked about Hack, Slash, and Crawl.
** We shot the shit about our lives, the wedding, cars, computers, etc.
** He had sent me an e-mail, and I sent one back. Hopefully, we will connect over qTox and Pidgin. 
** He may be switching to Linux again. That would be awesome!
* I've surfed and wrote a bit while watching TSM destroy nV.
