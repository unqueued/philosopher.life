title: 2018.10.03 - Prompted Introspection: Best Season

!! What season do you like best?

Depends on the context. Thus far in my life, on average, I will guess: Fall. I've spent an enormous amount of my time in school or teaching in one, and it has often been a the start of the new school year. It's just a marker though. Spring or Fall seem like the most likely candidates. 

I have answered this kind of question before:

* [[2018.09.21 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Season]]

I still agree with past selves. Go me.
