[15:36:51] Tjandamurra: G'day there. Interesing website but a bit confusing to navigate my way around - mostly ancient I be.
[02:11:39] Tjandamurra: I cannot believe the wage theft that is now being reported. The bastards should be jailed in the same way if a worker stole from the till. I would be there with them but too far away. 
[12:24:29] Why, Hello!: I don't know which particular instance you have in mind. It is a huge deal though. Makes me sick to my stomach.
[18:14:55] Tjandamurra: What I think is worse, is the unpaid overtime that is expected now in order to keep your job.
[18:24:36] Why, Hello!: It becomes hypernormalized, built into the fabric of how people perceive what should be expected and predicted. 
[18:24:59] Why, Hello!: Like, we're supposed to just man up and get over it. This is the way the world is, and surely it could not possibly be any different.
[18:28:06] Tjandamurra: It is wrong. If everyone stopped doing it, there are not enough un and underemployed people to fill the gaps. 
[18:29:16] Why, Hello!: I am not sure that is true.
[18:29:48] Why, Hello!: Un and underemployment are much higher here in the states than the government numbers tell.
[18:29:50] Tjandamurra: I saw some research a while ago stating that fact. I will have to rediscover it.
[18:30:02] Tjandamurra: It is the same here in Oz
[18:30:25] Tjandamurra: Only have to work 1 hour per week to be classified as "employed"
[18:30:32] Why, Hello!: ugh
[18:31:09] Tjandamurra: And the government funds programs to do just that, in order to make themselves look better.
[18:34:52] Tjandamurra: That original line I put up was for another friend discussion we were having! My apology.
[18:36:36] Why, Hello!: Oh, no problem! I'm glad to hear from you. Good accidents.
[18:37:11] Tjandamurra: https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/dec/19/the-new-normal-no-recession-but-high-underemployment-and-flat-household-incomes - news story from one of the only trusted news sources, one not owned and operated by Murdoch
[00:22:08] Tjandamurra: Happy new year.
[pending] Why, Hello!: Belated (this has been an insane time for me, we've been moving): Happy New Year.
[pending] Why, Hello!: You spoke about fires earlier with me. How you thinking, feeling, and doing about that atm?
