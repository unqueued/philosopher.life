title: 2020.02.13 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Fingerless Gloves, So Badass

* Woke at 7:30
** Wife woke me, and I stayed that way. Not bad.
* Meditation
* Offspring on tasks
* Read+Write
* Talked with mechanic. Scheduled for check up on Monday.
* Pizza
* Had to drive around to several places to try and get the key replicated. It was a chain of references.
** Laser-cut. Two smiths walked me through why it was so hard to pick.
*** I've never seen one before, never read or watched about 'em either.
*** Ancient lockerpicker was not as interesting as the Frenchman. Frenchy talked to me about trainings and his job (almost completely mobile).
*** Talked with a black kid dressed to the fucking nines about his therapy, gentrification of the building we were in, and what he liked to read. He was hilarious.
** $75 for a fucking key. Jesus.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Made brownies for my wife's co-workers.
* Walked with my wife. 
** Damn good walk. 
** I found a dress for her. Cheap, very flattering, in the right colors, and she likes it a lot. I do too. 
*** Neoprene, I think. The lines though, damn, they do a good job.
*** Cannot wait to fuck her in it, lol.
** I found a $7 of gloves that actually fit. I'm finicky. I've tried 3 times to get a pair of gloves, and nothing worked right.
** Got a $15 coat. The buttons on mine are now gone, and it's not in good shape. I am glad to be warm.
* Cut the tips off the gloves. 
** I am now super tuff, and I can type with them. 
** I'd rather keep the house at 55 and wear gloves than spend more money on electricity.
* We scrounged.
** Mostly fruit for me.
