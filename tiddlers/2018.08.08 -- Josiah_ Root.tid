//Que s√ßay-je?//

Hey Josiah,

<<<
I read a lot of your wiki. Its interesting because its "prolix". By which I mean the thoughts develop though iteration. Its one of the very few wiki I ever bothered reading through.
<<<

Thank you for reading and making sense of it. That's one of the reasons [[you have root|Root Users]].<<ref "r">> I want to say I appreciate your positive spin on that word "prolix," which is often a word that has negative connotations.<<ref "p">> I talk about the negative side of it often enough.

Iterative development is exactly what I'm forced to do. I'm still looking for ways to improve on this front as well. Currently, I'm migrating {[[Axioms of h0p3]]} into {[[Principles]]}. I believe it will take many years to have something stable and relatively clean (or, I hope so). Growth is a process, and I'm glad to have a flexible tool for it.

<<<
It is different than much stuff on the net which tends to "the statement", not "the exploration".
<<<

I consider that high praise, thank you. I also think there's a fundamental problem of philosophy embedded in it which I can't quite tease out (although, I'm working on it). It may be another way of talking about the dialectic. The exploration is the statement, and perhaps we hit a kind of [[infinigress]]. Maybe one can be primitive to the other. I actually do [[hope]] to have a statement that acts as a reasonable foundation for myself in the end.

<<<
You writing style very much reminds me of writer-philosophers who consider self-reflection the essence of both life AND writing.

The closest analogy I can think of is Montaigne.
<<<

Indeed, that is what I hope to practically teach my children too.<<ref "c">> Iteratively building ourselves and self-reflective tools in order to model ourselves and the world with increasingly accuracy is //how// we find out //why//.<<ref "e">> [[Montaigne|2018.08.08 -- PPP: Montaigne]] is a rolemodel; I do want to be myself for a living. He seemed to think his writing and himself were unified in a profound way. 

Do you think I should make a special study of his writing? I finished [[Infinite Jest]], and while I see some commonalities, I hope to escape some of those trappings (he never did defeat the postmodern beast, I fear). I want to improve at my art, and looking at close analogies may be useful to me. I want to learn from their successes and mistakes.

<<<
Your approach is really good. You comments, at points, about some people who "don't get it", are accurate. But, IMO, you don't need labour those points. Readers will get it. People not into it are unlikely to ever get it.
<<<

I will refrain then. Thank you for the saying this (you have a right to speak more forcefully and negatively if you wish). There's a weird problem which arises in [[Find The Others]] that makes me feel obligated to apologize and explain that problem (pretty often). I also think it's important that I lay out the rules and justifications for myself. I have gotten far enough. I'm probably going to have to come to grips with the need to lower my expectations/predictions/hopes on this front.

Part of the issue is that I hope to build a bridge back to family who really haven't taken the time to get to know me. They really might not ever want to "get it." I will try to find the center of your advice here. I appreciate your willingness to give it.

<<<
On the tech side, maybe, in time, you could offer visitors a notification system for updates they could sign-up to?
<<<

You're not the first to ask for this. I responded to this request before [[2018.07.09 -- Mark Slater: RSS]]. Perhaps this is a sign that I really don't understand what I'm making or my process, but I'm having a hard time understanding what kinds of updates would be worth notifying others about. I mean, I know what excites me, but as an autistic person, I'm pretty awful at making that determination for others often enough. There's 10-15 [[New]] and twice many which have been edited each day. Should I just give then an RSS firehose they regex through? I suppose I should think about it and plan: [[h0p3's Wiki Updates & Notifications]].

Once again, thank you for taking the time to speak with me about this. On a side note, I was wondering if you had any wikis (of yours or others) which I can or should learn from. I can't say I'm the best learner, but I will give it my best effort.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
