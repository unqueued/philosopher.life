!! Provide a Redpilled explanation for the genetic existence of Dwarves.

This sent me on a hunt online for research.

** Insular dwarfism is fascinating. Evolution, of course, innately is about selfishness. This is quite a redpilled explanation.

I take the question, initially, to be how dwarfism continues to spread through genetic inheritance rather than phyletic dwarfism. What explanation can we give? What should we see in the lives of modern Dwarves?

Mating with dwarven females (little people, whatever the word needs to be here) would have its own allure for novelty seekers. Short males do not get to mate as often in human societies, and extremely short men are even less likely. It seems unlikely that females would select dwarven men for breeding purposes, especially since this is the wrong set of novelties they are generally inclined to pursue.

I posit that dwarves, especially dwarven men, like many of those who experience impairments (I'm not calling dwarfism bad or an impairment, objective fitness is deeply contextual), must often become fit appearing and virtue signal more heavily than the average homo sapien in order to be chosen for breeding.
