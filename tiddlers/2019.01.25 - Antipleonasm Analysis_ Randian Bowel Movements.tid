Objectively, objectivism is a movement which advocates, implements, defends, and overtly (not merely reactionarily) maintains laissez-faire capitalism. I gotta hand it to my enemies: sometimes they come out and speak their evil better than I ever could.

That is their praxis. They aim to revert us to the dog-eat-dog state of nature as much as possible. Their "civility" is anything but. They are radicals for the slavery of capitalism. Egoism doesn't even take [[T4T]] to be necessary; it's simply the most direct back-sliding from [[T42T]] they can trick others into accepting. 

The remainder becomes complicated on philosophical grounds. There are those who will not peel ethics apart from political or social philosophy. I think it's perfectly fair to paint objectivism as a primarily political ideology and practical movement in both [[The Great Human Conversation]] (the memetic dialectic) and the material dialectic (behavioral, power structures). 

Are they conservatives? I'm not sure how to define a conservative so cleaning. It is very much like the word "liberal." I tend to use the phrase "hedged-conservative" to talk about what it means to pursue the center of the [[Good]]will (wherein it is better for us to sacrifice inefficiently to make sure we have fulfilled our end of the [[T42T]] bargain). I don't think conservativism is a meaningless word though. Outgrouping, social dominance prescriptions, lack of openness, higher degrees of dark-triadicism and selfishness (though I can point that out across the spectrums), preferences for the status quo or traditionalism, xenophobia, dehumanization, unjustified hierarchical reasoning, anti-intellectualism, poorly reasoned exclusionary fideism, lower IQs, etc. are common trends and tendencies. Of course, I can point out exceptions and parallel flaws in almost all of us. This is still a matter of [[dok]] and looser tribalisms to me (don't get me wrong, I clearly have my own stakes and flaws here as well).

It is my opinion that Randianism represents a fairly pure form of rudimentary egoism and a psychopathy which has crossed the self-integration threshold to the point it can articulate a coherent vision of how to build systematic oppression which a Petyr can climb and manage with efficiency and a veneer of validity. These are the kinds of people which make it ever so clear to me that relativistic tolerance spirals into a toleration of evil itself. My tentpegs are deadset against this memeplex and genetic hardcoding in our species to whatever extent I can.

My friend Shelley is a genetic psychopath. I love that she can be so open about it sometimes, and I'm glad she has the rationality to recognize she should not reproduce. I have no idea if she is a killer; her lies against us all are simply too effective. I don't believe she is though. I think she attempts to live a moral life despite lacking even the hardware necessary to experience the affective portions of moral motivation. Even she can see I'm correct at this level from a cold-hard calculation perspective.

On these grounds, it's clear to me that Randians only harness conservative movements. They hollow them out and steer them. They inject themselves at the right chokepoints, fund the right structures, shake the right hands, and build loose mutual associations necessary to enable the elite to own us. The elite are happy to fight amongst each other for the pie, especially if they only have to fight each other rather than with the entire world. Randians are only conservatives when it benefits them: which is often. They can play the right cards against conservative playerbases with greater consistency (though I can see they so against broad swathes of the population to various [[dok]]). This is a classic playbook which has had different names through history. Marx called it.

Listen carefully to the final lie. Capitalism is doomed to perish without intervention (but it's not via objectivists). Its survival rides upon not being capitalism. It is clear that our species has a penchant and disposition for existing being vicious on this end of spectrum: individual selfishness. Well-reasoned collectivism, which is a form of decentralization, is simply the more computationally complex side of the equation. It is no wonder that one has prevailed over the other in the computational dialectics of our world. Oh no, Rand, it is //my idealogy// that has any chance of defeating the contradictions which give rise to the Crises of Capitalism. I say this as a man who genuinely loves the beauty of markets and competition. We have to aim radically higher.
