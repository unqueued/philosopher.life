title: 2017.11.22 - Carpe Diem Log: Arrival

* Woke at 8. I slept really hard last night. Excellent sleep.
* Wife promised to bang me tonight. I am quite excited.
* Woke kids
* Cleaning
* Baking
* CS intro for my son
** He's now using vim and programming in Python
* Daughter is working on the world of IRC
* Cannabliss
* Talked to JRE
** Interesting conversation about D3 Difficulty Setting, Skinnerboxes, and Experience Machines (and the redpilling of skinnerboxes). It turned into a wrestling match, and I don't think he found it worth his time. I'm not sure if it is up to me. I'll keep thinking about it without him. Perhaps it is not an area I should talk about with him so much if it makes him feel bad.
*** Talking to me is often not fun. I must remember that. That doesn't mean I'm a bad person for it, but it does make it difficult to maintain relationships at times. I can only do my best here.
* Talked to my daughter about the argument for perspective. 
** We talked about a bunch of things actually, and we read over [[j3d1h]] together. I had much to say, line-by-line. We got back to //Dune//. 
* MB&A came!
* Indian food
* Talked late into the night.
