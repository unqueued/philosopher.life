title: Life of Fred: Cats (Elementary Series)

What an amazing mathbook. I so wish I had this book growing up. Set theory and proofs keep showing up from the beginning. We get to connect this content to our work in symbolic logic very nicely. He keeps planting these fucking seeds, and I'm so excited to see them grow.

Today, we also solved how to find the length of the corner of a cube to absolutely opposite corner of the cube knowing just the length of an edge. This was necessary for thinking about our art project that we are making. It was good to see math come alive for us. 

Oh, yeah...Our art project may be evolving to be a demonstration of hypercube dimensionality. It's an interesting concept.
