Oh, I forgot to say, our sync has three things for you: Fleabag (show), The Boys (show), and a Birbiglia broadway-ish comedy special that was very moving to [[JRE]].

How's today going?
Mar 13 1:14pm
Sorry I didn't have a chance to respond and by the time I got home from work I forgot you had messaged me.
Mar 14 10:12pm
No worries.
Mar 14 10:14pm
How's it going?
Mar 14 10:14pm
Not bad. Tired as fuck worked a double today. [[JRE]] came and visited me at work was a very happy surprise
Mar 14 10:17pm
Sorry that you are tired. Double blows. =(
Mar 15 6:58pm
I am super jelly that [[JRE]] gets to see you in person.
