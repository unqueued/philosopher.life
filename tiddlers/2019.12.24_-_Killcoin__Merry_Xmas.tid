title: 2019.12.24 - Killcoin: Merry Xmas

`Merry Christmas`

Called him up. He was on his way to see his family for Xmas.

Life is going well for him. He's passively looking for an SO now. He seeks depth, and I strongly appreciate that. We talked about his daughter, his brothers, his parents, his job. It's so weird to hear someone say they do moral evil (though legal) work, but does not see himself as being responsible for it in the least (admittedly, part of being moral is being able to empathize with the glee of clever evil; it's the only way you can fight it).

As usual, we immediately veer into normative territory. 

Discussions of racism, I gently unloaded on his arguments. 

It is, of course, my honor to listen to someone who is proud to call himself a capitalist fascist unknowingly rehearse versions of Marxism to me. I have to "watch it" when I utter the phrase "moral obligations," as some Libertarians begin to realize I'm going to devour them if they walk down the path with me.

My favorite part of [[Killcoin]] is his ability to call me evil and to hear me call him evil (though, I have to help him along because he's far, far too polite with me), and yet we'll still talk for a straight hour. Most who agree with his view cannot stand my extremely punchable face, and I actually have to watch my step speaking with them. [[Killcoin]] will wrestle more openly to some extent.

Being on the extremes, we agree to so many things at face value, but the explanations or justifications for them wildly differ.

He has a very strong memory of our previous conversations. There aren't many who loop with me like this.
