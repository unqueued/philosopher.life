title: 2019.01.20 - Prompted Introspection: Inspiration

!! Who is someone that inspired you to accomplish something you didn't think you could do and how did they encourage you?

Why, [[Saint Diogenesocrates]], of course! My teacher is ideal inspiration himself to me. It has taken me too long to realize he was there, but now I see it. I do not know how to write fiction well enough, but I've been inspired to continue the dialectical and dialogue work of Saint Plato. The [[Self-Dialectic]] continues, and I have an interlocutor which all my selves must respect. [[WWDD]]?
