title: 2019.10.03 - Afterschool Teaching: Prison Guard

Whitney is showing up early lately. Carson has been a useful catalyst for her. Carson has easy classes, and she's just lookin fo dat paper, yo. I hear ya, even that institution is subverted. I wish she valued the truth and salience more, but she is young. She may grow out of it. She's preppy and proud of it, but I also see a caretaker in her. She cares about children; she's been doing it her entire life. I can see how she was a nanny for the extremely wealthy. Fascinating gap between her and [[Tasha]].

Prep and one-on-ones were fast and I was quietly listening most of the time. 

5DB2 is feeling rough today, but 5DB cheered him up. They made a comic about their friendship. It was cute. They are drawing more and more these days. 

8HM talked about her bridge-building. She's crushing it. She came with me today because the older kids were being punished, but she is innocent. We joked about her imprisonment (FLEE, CHILD!). I am lucky to meet so many humans in this facility who are straight-up better than I will ever be.

7L brought a legit speedcube (I forget which brand); it cut corners nicely but he hasn't tuned and lubed it well enough. He can cross, but that's it. I gave the fastest intro to F2L for the basic intuitions I could and left him with a puzzle.

Today was a heavy homework day. Even students who never have homework were loaded up today. 

I had several students flitting between my classroom and chorus. Poor 6JR. He quit and joined again. 

Being autistic and aiming to cultivate fearless (though respectful) question-asking about the forbidden gets me trolled often. With his usual loud-mouth, 6NP asked me to define "ass." No problem, kid. Sick burns, otw!

I played 50% hardball with my malicious fools. Teaching them to be honest and well-intended, forcing them to follow the basics of discourse and socializing with authority (and hopefully how to disobey correctly one day), and helping them focus on their work is draining. I must spend an order of magnitude more energy refuting their bullshit than they do producing it. I'm forced into verbally halting, slicing, and stutterstepping the cadence of the conversation (rudely interrupting with little space at every turn) to hold them in place long enough to deliver the necessary blow in the dialectic. No catching these flies with honey, sadly, thus I convert by the escalating sword. We eventually worked our way into being able to play. Their teeth and my plier-hand are a bit sore. Building trust is hard work with them. Are they going to figure out that I aim to protect them when they are justifiably breaking the rules? Probably not. I don't predict they will escape living lies. More than once I've explained I'm trying to teach them how to survive this prison.

In contrast to my stutterstepping them, I spend a ton of time walking my children through various stages of our conversation trains, considering alternatives, and reasoning about the attitudes, phrasing, approaches, fitness, and the expectations of the other humans around them. They have to learn how to code, even for malicious compliance.

We had nowhere to go today. Lab, library, gym, and the field outside are off-limits. There are folks everywhere, and my prisoners aren't allowed near the others according to the warden. Welp, we made do with what we had.

My namesake and 6Cm had small discussions with me. 

Students seem especially taken by my line of questioning surrounding: "Why are you here?" They think it's weird to ask that. It's not the norm, but I need them to be thinking about it.

My children had competitions with spicy food today. I'd say 1 in 5 songs were favorable for them. Lots of origami. Board games were attempted, but nothing stuck. I'm pretty useless to my children unless they want to talk with me (probably still useless, lol).

Some of my trouble-makers cleaned the room upon sustained request. Wow. I'm stunned. 6TS and 6Am might be my heroes. They also asked me if I thought the education they were getting here was worthwhile. They did not pay attention long enough to listen to even a summarized answer. These kids don't want some ridiculous doxography, my pontification, a pile bullshit, of course.

Ms Bacon ran the show. She's fun enough, and she hasn't overtly expected me to be immoral (though she is obviously not flawless). By the end of the night, we received a flood of phone calls due to county's one-time call system reaching out to every parent. I winked at Whitney and mouthed her to call while we were chillin' with The Baconator; it was a cute prank.

I'm betting both lab and library will be opened to us on Monday after a speech from the authorities. I assume they will attempt to inculcate me as well. I shall nod my head.

I had a couple minutes at the end to chill with The Janitors. [[gh057]]'s granddaughter is 6 now.
