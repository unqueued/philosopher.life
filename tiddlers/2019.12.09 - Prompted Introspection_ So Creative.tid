title: 2019.12.09 - Prompted Introspection: So Creative

!! What quality do you like about yourself?creativity, personality, appearance?why?

~~Well, it's veiny, leans to the left (it's not [[pright]]ist scum!), a little bit sore at all times, rakishly good-looking, cynical, it's the real brains of the operation, sports an earth-toned or purple turtleneck, and is constantly puking...~~

Oh, I'm supposed to choose from that list.

Creativity. I don't think I'm terribly creative, but I like making stuff. Usually, I'm the only person who is going to laugh at my joke. That can't be terribly creative.
