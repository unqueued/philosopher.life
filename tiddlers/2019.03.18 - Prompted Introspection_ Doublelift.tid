title: 2019.03.18 - Prompted Introspection: Doublelift

!! Who is your all-time favorite sports player?

Thus far, Doublelift. He gets me to leap out of my seat, laugh, feel something, think, and even provides (and talks about) a model to emulate when I play the game (though it has been a long time now). His imagecrafting is actually interesting. However shallow: it is theater, drama, and narrative. I have learned a lot about the nature of sports in thinking about Doublelift.
