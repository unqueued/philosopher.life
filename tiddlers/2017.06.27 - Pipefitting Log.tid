title: 2017.06.27 - Pipefitting Log

Today was interesting. I started highlighting my book. I hit the headers and quantities for both chapters. I finished highlighting the first chapter. I hope to test on it tomorrow. It is a huge fucking chapter; both are. Once I've passed them, I'll be done with the book. I won't be doing the 4th NCCER book. That's okay. The field experience is more important at this point, and the NCCER certs were only a way to get my foot in the door to my first job anyways. Also, I'll be completing the last year at the union anyways.

I asked my teacher what he thought I was missing for the job I would be doing. He felt like I would be in great shape except for pipe hangers and supports, which just so happens to be the chapter I'm working on. Lol. I don't believe he was fucking with me either. It makes sense. I see these devices all the time when I'm looking at pipe installations in my everyday experience. 

I was interrupted by the thought that I needed to fix my lack of tools issue. My teacher came to talk to me about it after I had started too, so this is important. I started going through the list of tools that the class/school suggests for general pipefitting. There is a new gangbox instead of an awkward tool chest that should work nicely in my backseat. I went to the office to find out when the earliest I day would be that I could order it. They said the absolute earliest if I'm lucky, would be two weeks into July. That's too late! So, I'm going to see if I can go around this process by having AB&T purchase it directly rather than through a school voucher that won't be processed on time. I'm going to explain my situation. I need the tools before then, not later. I need it for this job. We're talking about $800 of tools just to start me out and another $1,000 of specialized tools I need for the specific work I'd be doing. God damn is it expensive!

I spent quite a bit of time sifting through pipefitter tools that would be useful for the job I'm going to have. I asked my teacher about them. He said I could get by with just the initial tools, but he could see tons of cases where I'd benefit from the extended tool list. He also gave me a few more suggestions for a list which I did not consider (he even brought his own toolbox out to show me). He said that if I'm going for raw speed, there are times where foregoing the clamps are best. That said, when accuracy matters, nothing beats them. I'll sacrifice 1 minute to improve my hi-lo's and angles. He told me to be careful with these tools as well; he said they would 'grow legs' (be coveted + stolen). I'm going to engrave my tools on the outside and the inside, and I'm going to watch over them. They matter to me.

In any case, assuming my teacher won't just hand me 6 months of "time in the shop" for free, instead of using AB&T's money to get a useless piece of paper for completing the degree (which aren't the certs; I've already earned those), I want to use the money to get a full set of tools. I worry they will think it is unwise to dump school here, but I'm done with the program (and completed work beyond the standard coursework). School isn't what I need right now (even if I love it), the actual field experience is though. I'm hoping they'll buy them and have them for me. If not, maybe I can buy them and be reimbursed. I know I absolutely need tools though. There isn't much time. Let me say, I'm very doubtful this is going to work. I shouldn't be too disappointed. I'm really grateful for what they have given me. While this is perfectly rational, they may not see it that way. Red tape abounds. 

I tried calling AB&T today, but couldn't get ahold of them. I will try again tomorrow. Their fiscal year begins in a few days, and that's when the money comes in. I have a very narrow window to succeed here.

My teacher also had me weld something he was fabricating for his swimming pool. The welds turned out nicely. He asked me if I wanted to complete the 1.5" simulator with a random welding student today. I said I'd rather study for the test. He definitely wants me to finish it. Lol. It will get done.

This is the second day I've swung by the union to see if Randy was there. He wasn't. I need to talk to him about the situation.

I need to get the car looked at. I need to talk to the electrician's union too!
