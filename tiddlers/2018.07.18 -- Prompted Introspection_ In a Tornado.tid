title: 2018.07.18 -- Prompted Introspection: In a Tornado

!! What would it be like to be in a tornado?

I've been in buildings being hit by them before. It's freaky. I've written about it before. I don't care to rehearse it. 

To actually be in a tornado by myself would probably be a surreal ride and likely death. I assume my perception of time would slow down, adrenaline would be pumping, and I would be forever altered (whether through death or somehow living through it).

There is something about these proverbial acts of god that cause us to see ourselves and the world in a different light. It's visceral.
