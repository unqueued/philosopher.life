title: 2018.04.27 -- Le Reddit Log: Democrats Are Dangerous Too

https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8fahr6/the_republican_party_not_trump_is_the_real_threat/

Yes, Trump is a symptom. Yes, the RNC is extremely dangerous, and that's because they are blatantly owned by powerful interests. But, what I find troubling is that too few people have the integrity to admit the Democratic party has also been hollowed out. Power is centralized, and they own both parties. We've been in a constitutional crisis for quite a while, and more importantly, we've not actually had any representation for decades!

This isn't a "threat" to democracy. We don't have one to threaten. We have to recreate democracy at this point. The threat is now against people actually taking back their right to be represented. This threat isn't merely due to the Republican and Democratic parties: it's due to capitalism. We have to decentralize power as effectively as we can; that's what democracy is all about.

The Democrats are subverting Leftist movements as we speak. They are trying to replace socialists with pro-capitalist candidates for the midterms. This is a false compromise and yet another shift in the Overton window to the Right. The Democrats are conservatives, and they are working to centralize power. Democrats are just slightly more sane appearing versions of Republicans, but they are still wolves. Democratic complacency is not an accident; they don't actually wish to represent the people. So, let's not merely blame the Republicans because they are all at fault (even if some are more evil than others).
