You hanging in there?

Hey [[h0p3]]! Oh geez I missed a lot of messages this week. Itâ€™s been a long one.
OCT 5 12:30 PM
Heyas. I bet it has been a long one.
OCT 5 12:32 PM
It doesn't help that I haven't opened my laptop in a hot minute -- that's usually where I catch your messages!
OCT 5 12:32 PM
You must have been slammed and drained this week. I'm sorry. =(
OCT 5 12:33 PM
One of those weeks where I feel the need to distract myself from distress with excessive gameplay
OCT 5 12:33 PM
I am super ahead on my weekly items in FFXIV >_>
OCT 5 12:34 PM
"Some such patients keep diaries recording meticulous details aobut their everyday lives." Who wrote this article about you?
OCT 5 12:34 PM
I know the grind. Lol. [[JRE]] and I do daily quests for our gear and other resources.
OCT 5 12:36 PM
Trying to keep how much time I spend down. 2 hours is my max, except on weekends.
OCT 5 12:36 PM
Good!
OCT 5 12:36 PM
I should probably do the same. FFXIV has lured me in with in-game housing and an absurd amount of furniture to mess around with. For some reason I REALLY enjoy designing spaces in that way.
OCT 5 12:38 PM
I have spent most of this week either grinding or derping around in our guild house. Needless to say I have spent way more than two hours a day in game.
OCT 5 12:38 PM
I know the feeling. Easy to drop everything into it, to be lost in the virtual world.
OCT 5 12:40 PM
That is my life, lol.
OCT 5 12:40 PM
The distraction from the intensity of real life woes is always welcome
OCT 5 12:40 PM
And, yes, I'm blown away, I finally have another piece to the puzzle. I'm convinced Geschwind Syndrome is on the money.
OCT 5 12:40 PM
So now that I've gone down several Wikipedia rabbit holes to catch up mentally, this Geschwind syndrome definitely sounds like you.
OCT 5 12:40 PM
HA! Took the words right out of my mouth.
OCT 5 12:41 PM
It always helps to be able to put a name to it.

Excuse me while I go through all of Wikipedia trying to understand the different types of seizures... lol.

So does this mean that seeking treatment for localized seizures would potentially help?
OCT 5 12:49 PM
I do not know. 
OCT 5 12:51 PM
It seems like depression is a major symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy. Hm.
OCT 5 12:52 PM
I can't say I've experienced seizures, or it is not obvious how they operate in me.
OCT 5 12:52 PM
But, the seizure aspect is something which appears to be a matter of controversy. Some people exhibit it without from what I can see.
OCT 5 12:53 PM
If Wikipedia is to be a trusted source here, it is entirely likely that they would not manifest in a "typical" way. Some of these symptoms of localized seizures could very easily be dimissed as something else, I think.
OCT 5 12:53 PM
Interesting.
OCT 5 12:53 PM
Brains are fuckin weird, man.
