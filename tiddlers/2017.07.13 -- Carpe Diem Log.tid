title: 2017.07.13 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up a couple times in the night, as usual. I keep checking the alarm clock to make sure it is working (paranoid). My last time was 10 seconds before the alarm went off. I was getting up to turn it off when it went off. Impeccable timing.
* I took a bit longer to get ready (5 more minutes), but it didn't matter.
* I worked very hard today.
* I talked to my teacher.
* I got even closer to Jaye (Jihad!)
* I figured out that I really do despise the office employees (quickly becoming a blue collar worker, it took no time, because I already hate people in general, especially white collar workers in my experience). 
* I got some medicine for my face. It looks better, and maybe it feels better. I think I caught it early enough to do something about it.
* My hand's allergic reaction has no subsided.
* I talked to my wife twice, my children, and my brother JRE. 
* My roommate offered me a shitty tether, and he claimed he would do something about the interwebs problem with the ISP. I'm not holding my breath. I'm hoping in 2 months I won't be here anyways, maybe sooner if I can help it.
** Jihad could house me, right?
* I love showers after work. The cleansing is very satisfying.
* I didn't eat so much today until after I got home. Then I decided to try and not waste my food. I brought too much, I think.
* I cleaned my room, did the dishes, got everything packed and ready to go.
* Maybe some fireman time? Definitely some Mr. Robot. I watched part of episode already.
* My links have become unmanageable. I should bring my computer with me at work. Hit the BK and read/write. That's what I'll do for lunches!
