Have a great day [[h0p3]]
Nov 5, 2019 8:10am
You too, homie. 
Nov 5, 2019 10:05am
How do you predict your day will go?
Nov 5, 2019 10:05am
Iâ€™m fighting dissociation with three shots of espresso.
Nov 5, 2019 10:06am
So pretty good! ðŸ˜‚
Nov 5, 2019 10:07am
Gonna finish my short story today and jump straight into editing. Iâ€™m behind.
Nov 5, 2019 10:07am
That is a fascinating claim, btw. I suppose everyone must be their own judge to some extent on dissocation (who else could do it? :P). I need to get some coffee too.

Iâ€™ve some weird abdominal distress for about a week? I have no idea whatâ€™s wrong and we havenâ€™t found a doctor yet so Iâ€™ve just been monitoring it and trying to cut down on physical exertions. I have hypochondriac tendencies so Iâ€™ve run from appendicitis to a pulled muscle to stones to cancer and more. The last time this happened (2-3 years ago?) I also dissociated hard.

Until something literally hurts, no news is good news.
Nov 5, 2019 10:13am
Life goes on. Iâ€™m going to graduate if it kills me
Nov 5, 2019 10:15am
I hear that.
Nov 5, 2019 4:36pm
You sound stressed to me, homie.
Nov 5, 2019 4:38pm
Hahaha. Thatâ€™s my life story. :D
Nov 5, 2019 6:33pm
Have a great day today!
Nov 6, 2019 7:08am
You too, homie. 
Nov 6, 2019 7:09am
Alright, so how many more days of class do you have left?
Nov 6, 2019 7:10am
Including today? 16
Nov 6, 2019 7:14am
Yikes I have a lot to do. ðŸ‘€
Nov 6, 2019 7:14am
Lol
Nov 6, 2019 7:14am
Business as usual
Nov 6, 2019 7:15am
It's been a long time coming. Kinda surreal to be 16 days of class away.
Nov 6, 2019 7:15am
Yeah. Itâ€™s crazy. Iâ€™m finally almost done (for a little while).
Nov 6, 2019 7:15am
How goes your day? 
Nov 7, 2019 12:22pm
Itâ€™s going! And my short story is nearly finished.
Nov 7, 2019 12:23pm
Noice. 
Nov 7, 2019 12:24pm
Reading now
Nov 7, 2019 12:24pm
Hope you like it!

It's descriptive. Reminds me of horror film quite a bit. The reason I care about the character is in virtue of what is happening to the character. I think it's visceral.
Nov 7, 2019 12:29pm
Iâ€™ve been working really hard on narrative through description and just augmenting my ability to write interesting description in general.
Nov 7, 2019 12:30pm
[[L]] doing okay?
Nov 7, 2019 12:39pm
Now that her work event is finished, sheâ€™s doing a lot better.
Nov 7, 2019 12:40pm
Oh, good. =)
Nov 7, 2019 12:43pm
Her department is going through a massive shakeup. I only hope it renews her resolve to get out of there.
Nov 7, 2019 12:58pm
It's gotta be painful for her.
Nov 7, 2019 12:58pm
I never thought a person like [[L]] could fall victim to depression. Fuck Humana.
Nov 7, 2019 1:14pm
What are all the things remaining for you to graduate?
Nov 8, 2019 10:29am
Iâ€™ve got five papers to write haha and one final exam.
Nov 8, 2019 11:23am
Cap and gown are ordered already. :)
Nov 8, 2019 11:23am
Lol. Notice. That is a ton.
Nov 8, 2019 11:24am
Iâ€™m going to try to know out two of those this weekend if at all possible. ðŸ˜‚
Nov 8, 2019 11:38am
Good. Hard to keep ur head above water.
