Hey how’s it going?
TUE 1:07 PM
It goes. My penis is normal again. It lives, thus I'm not ded.
TUE 1:08 PM
Landlords have electricians working on running wire in our apartments. Working with the kids otherwise.
TUE 1:08 PM
How about you? What are you up to?
TUE 1:08 PM
I’m glad your penis works. :joy:
TUE 1:11 PM
Running errands for [[L]]! Can I send you something NSFW?
TUE 1:11 PM
Of course, lol.

Stunning!

Snapchat has a filter that gender swaps your face.
TUE 1:12 PM
I took these with it.
TUE 1:12 PM
[[JRE]] said I needed to send them to you too. XD
TUE 1:12 PM
Lol. Well, you look gorgeous.
TUE 1:13 PM
Thanks! Not gonna lie, this kinda makes me wonder “what if?”
TUE 1:18 PM
But periods sounds gross and so does childbirth therefore penis master race!
TUE 1:19 PM
Sound*** words are hard
TUE 1:20 PM
Keep the penis, go for the lipstick and tits. Perfect compromise.
TUE 1:20 PM
Excellent. I will delve down the rabbit hole to becoming a trap. :joy:
TUE 1:20 PM
I’ve been writing a lot more this week. Feels good.
TUE 1:20 PM
Awesome. I assume you are in heavy planning stages at the moment.
TUE 1:21 PM
Most definitely! I’m excited to see if I can slot into fantasy more nicely.
TUE 1:21 PM
And yet, I’m thinking about another horror short story too...
TUE 1:22 PM
I really wanna encapsulate the feel of a monster stalking someone and I think there are a lot of neat tricks that can accomplish that in bone-chilling ways.
TUE 1:26 PM
I don't see why you can't import horror into fantasy.
TUE 1:26 PM
Or, at least the kind which is about that chilling feeling of the other.
TUE 1:27 PM
There’s definitely a uniqueness to the concept. It’s why Pan’s Labyrinth is so great
TUE 1:27 PM
Yes. Perfect example.
TUE 1:27 PM
In terms of fantasy, I think helplessness is a concept that should be at the forefront. It’s more difficult to do with conventional fantasy since magic and weapons are so prevalent. It needs a delicate balance.
TUE 1:30 PM
Fantasy-horror***
TUE 1:32 PM
I feel like I can make reasonable judgments about science fiction (though I'm hardly well-read). Fantasy, however, is completely out of my league. [[k0sh3k]] is arguably well-read in Fantasy and some horror (almost all of Stephen King, for example); I am surprised you don't pick her brain on it. She's good at picking out books too. There might be particular Fantasy-horror books worth reading.
TUE 1:33 PM
I think the last fantasy book I read for The Goblin Emperor. It didn't have much magic in it, and it was more introspective and court intrigue than anything else.
TUE 1:34 PM
That book definitely had helplessness in it though.
TUE 1:35 PM
It was profoundly concerned with power dynamics beyond what "magic" can buy you.
TUE 1:35 PM
You ever considered going for a New Weird style?
TUE 1:37 PM
I'm usually a stickler when it comes to superpowers, as I expect the world to demonstrate the profound logical consequences of how those powers play out (and they almost never do). New Weird seems to bypass my instinct on that one (perhaps I'm just inconsistent). It might also be a wonderful place to play out fantasy-horror and helplessness.
TUE 1:39 PM
Ill look into “new weird”! I’ve never heard of it before.
TUE 1:46 PM
I should bug [[k0sh3k]] too. :)
TUE 1:46 PM
You wouldn't be bugging her (and you aren't bugging me either). She lives for it.
