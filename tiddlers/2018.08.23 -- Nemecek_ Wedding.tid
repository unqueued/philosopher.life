You psyched about it, or is it more of a hoop to jump through?
adamnemecek

The older I get, the less I enjoy doing anything with the vast majority of folks (with some very clear exceptions). 
I hope it goes smoothly and without stress for you, and I hope it's a good memory for you.
as to your question, I'm doing well enough. I've been busy reading and writing, as usual.

I'm annoying people by being very transparent with my wiki. It has sparked several serious conversations. I'm making slow progress towards my goals with the wiki in general though (replacing my old {Principles} with my Axioms of h0p3). It's weird building something for which there aren't many other examples to reasona bout. 
Been spending a lot of time homeschooling my children as well.
Reaching out to old family members through my wiki as well. It's been difficult, but I'm glad to do so.
Nothing cool, I'm afraid. I think it will be a while before I have anthing substantive.
Linear logic keeps popping up for me again and again now that my eyes are peeled for it.
It will be a while before I can throw myself into it.
