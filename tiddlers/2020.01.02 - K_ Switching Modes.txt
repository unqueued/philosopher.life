On the road now.
Jan 2 11:24am
Been kinda crazy past 24 hours, but that's okay.
Jan 2 11:24am

Jan 2 11:24am
Aye I feel that.
Jan 2 11:24am
me too =)
Jan 2 11:25am
Had our water pipes burst on us while removing washer connection, so no water for cleaning (and giant mess). Didn't losing anything to it though.
Jan 2 11:25am
Cat escaped while we were just about to leave, and was scared. got all cut up in thorns trying to find and catch her.
Jan 2 11:26am
Iâ€™m at the doctor now. Hoping for good news. Haha
Jan 2 11:27am
Back to the rest of reality, lol.
Jan 2 11:27am

Jan 2 11:27am
No doubt.
Jan 2 11:30am

Jan 2 11:31am
So far so good. Weâ€™re going to meet some friends today for dinner get some shopping done too
Jan 2 11:31am
Right out of the light fixtures, electric sockets, fire alarm, lol.
Jan 2 11:31am
Noice. Sounds like a solid day.
Jan 2 11:32am
Whatâ€™s your current ETA?
Jan 2 11:33am
Well, we are stopping at Halfway, Maryland (almost exactly halfway in terms of time traveling) for the night. 4.5 hours left to get there.
Jan 2 11:34am
Like a motel or something that allows our cats.
Jan 2 11:34am
Playin' it a bit by ear for the time being.
Jan 2 11:35am
Oh thatâ€™s not too bad. Good good.
Jan 2 11:58am

How's your day going?
Jan 3 1:31pm
A little dizzy but Iâ€™m okay. Got appointments scheduled for allergy testing and asthma testing too. So thatâ€™s nice.
Jan 3 1:37pm
How are you guys? :)
Jan 3 1:37pm
Good
Jan 3 1:37pm
Sorry about the dizzyness. That is unpleasant, demotivating for me.
Jan 3 1:38pm
We're doing well. Still traveling.
Jan 3 1:38pm
Everyone seems to be in good spirits, though the cats are stressed (understandably).
Jan 3 1:38pm
Aye Iâ€™m still having abdominal issues but the nurse practitioner seems unconcerned so I guess time will fix everything.
Jan 3 1:39pm
Good and that makes sense. Poor things just wanna roam haha.
Jan 3 1:39pm
Yeah, hopefully eating your own food, drinking your own water, and chillin' in your own home will alleviate that.
Jan 3 1:43pm
Aye Iâ€™m relaxing. Hot drinks and fiber too
Jan 3 1:47pm
There might be some kind of metal block adding to this too. Iâ€™m trying to figure it out.
Jan 3 1:48pm
But I am in high spirits.
