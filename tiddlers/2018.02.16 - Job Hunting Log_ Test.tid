title: 2018.02.16 - Job Hunting Log: Test

I checked jobs online. Nothing new.

I went to the union and took the test. It took several hours. It was a basic verbal/quant test. I'm sure I aced it. I expect a letter in the next 3 weeks scheduling an interview. The coordinator and I talked for a while. He seemed interested in having me. He also called me up because he didn't receive my e-mailed transcripts. I e-mailed again and he told me he received them. I talked to my brother about it. He might see if he can help nepotistically.
