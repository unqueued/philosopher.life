title: Live Each Day Like Itâ€™s Your Last

//Carpe diem//

Obviously, it would be insane to take this too literally. We are, however, seeking the kernel of truth embedded in these words. Let's find the [[The Way]]. That obviously sounds like some spooky insanity. Get past the metaphysics, the spirituality, the religiosity, the cultish scamosity, the ironically absurd jargon and doubletalk. Who gives a shit? Be practical! Everyone must write their own list of reasons to get out of bed (frame it for yourself).

* Are you happy to wake up each morning?
** Are you bursting with ideas?
*** Which ones matter the most to you today, and why?
*** Forget that extroverted-brainwashing, what do you want from the day?
** Do you know where you are in your plan?
*** Are you taking time to re-evaluate your plan?
****Doubt is a valuable tool.
** Is life feeling like a [[plight|Human plight]], an awe-inspiring opportunity, somewhere in between, all at once, ??

* Are you the author of your life?
** Does life feel like a video game (in a non-derealized way) for you?
*** Are you excited to explore, to plunder, to be the mastermind of your happiness?
**** What are your goals?
*** Are you kicking ass and taking names?

* Do you have "...'like'<<ref "1">>...10 million things to do" in a good way or a bad way?<<ref "2">>
** What is the grid of your objectives and the tree of your decisions?
** What are the moral boundaries, mechanical limits, and keys to victory?
***You must organize! But a good organizer must organize their organizating. //ad infinitum ad absurdum ad nauseum//.
****Play the game! You love games! (Be skeptical, but fucking play!)

*Do you feel Tookish today?
** Are you making your own luck today?
** Go on and confabulate your purpose, your divine path, until you don't have to. What else should you do?

* What is your purpose?
** Can you identify it? Can see the means to those ends?
* Can you be addicted to Eudaimonia?
** Is that definitionally impossible?
