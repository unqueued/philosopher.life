`/raises-his-hand` - I will, faggot^^tm^^. Rather, I will try. It turns out I'm going to have a difficult time stopping you without becoming you (or like you) in the dialectic. I have to swallow you up, digest you, and shit out a better version.

The literal interpretation is odd. What say you, Hobbes? This appears to be one way of talking about political autonomy. It has no regard for [[The Moral Law]] whatsoever. That hyperindividualistic "who gives a fuck what anyone else thinks by definition" mentality isn't [[The Golden Rule]]; it's probably not even [[T4T]] (though you might be able to bend it that direction).

Don't get me wrong: I consider most humans be to an impediment to what is morally owed to each of us. It's clear that people choose to be selfish assholes in the majority of cases. That does entail that we have the right to trample over them in particular cases [[irwartfrr]]. Rand isn't talking about justice here though.

Her point of view is a disease in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. There's not much I can do about it. I can't be in charge of solving that obviously: that would be absurd. I can only do my best to offer what I take to be the truth, defend it, and be a good rolemodel.

This reminds me of what it's like to be a dad. The difference, of course, is that I didn't create the 100 billion specimens, just 2. I have no idea how much influence I have, but it is quite small. I must wield myself, my tool-based extensions of my identity, and the way in which I engage [[others]] wisely. It is unfortunate that justice is not prudent all the way down.
