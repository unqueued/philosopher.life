Morning, [[h0p3]! How's your week been?

It's been good. Reading and writing.

Fri 9:37 AM
 That reminds me, I have some catching up to do on your wiki...
Fri 9:37 AM
 My friend Sphygmus has done something I've never seen before; she has taken my aesthetic signature look from my wiki and written a stylesheet to make my letters to her (in her tiddlywiki) present in my style. Gonna be doing the same for her.
Fri 9:37 AM
 That’s really cool.
Fri 9:38 AM
 Does that make the entire little tiddler appear differently?
Fri 9:38 AM
 Cause I’d be interested to see how that works.
Fri 9:39 AM
 the way she has done it, it makes all of the tiddlers tagged "from h0p3" have my style. Everything else is the same.
Fri 9:39 AM
 Oooohhh
