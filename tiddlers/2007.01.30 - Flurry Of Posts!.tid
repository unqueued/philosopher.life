title: 2007.01.30 - Flurry Of Posts!

I apologize for not posting in the past week or so...but, I have been thinking and writing. I've also been over at roguespot.com and wowglider.com working away at what I'm going to do in WoW. And, I've been busy reading and considering themanadrain.com's content (as well a one &quot;Smemnen&quot; 's articles which are very well written). k0sh3k and I have even discussed selling my character and botting another back to 70 in 5 weeks (now that I know exactly what to do). Hell, we could even make a business of it...if we got it down pat, and could sell them 1k a piece, I could bot a network at home, and just bot'n'sell accounts all day.

But, eh, for now, I am really enjoying my rogue. I just hit 70, and I might just keep him (especially as Ebay just banned the sale of intangibles).

Mom and Dad's laptop has been stolen...the brand new one I believe. That sucks! They are good otherwise, I'll have to see how their visas are going. Speaking of which, JRE got his passport in the mail...I wonder if he will really stay in Thailand.
