Time only trickles in one direction, and the same for causation, and thus also moral responsbility.

Sometimes I feel like the dialectic of the wiki, between [[RPIN]] and [[ehyeh]] right now, is an expression of my empathization with Humanity, or at least given my interpretation of the Great Human Conversation.

My wife said that my children were not allowed to use their phones to my donors. This was not true. I asked the kids before my wife to verify. They said I hadn't barred them from using their phones, except they weren't allowed to have them in bed (I want them to sleep). Unfortunately, she made a bad situation arguably worse. I expressed my overexcited grief and anger by pointing out the mistake, and telling her not to make it again, please. She refused to speak with me after that, and I went full frontal lobe filter to inspect and interpret the events with her. My goal, of course, is to be constructive. High anxiety in our house mixed with the explosive emotions of being a wounded animal do not help us.
