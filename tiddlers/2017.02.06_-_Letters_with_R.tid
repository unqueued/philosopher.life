I am so sorry about your Mom's health. 

I was very close to my parents. We had different views on some things, but I always felt heard and respected. I don't have a lot of regrets. It is hard to regret the things that formed you without regretting that you are who you are, and I am okay with who I am. I want to say that I regret staying in an abusive marriage for ten years, but I have three amazing daughters that I wouldn't have had otherwise. I want to say that I regret not being more present in my daughters' lives, but the full court press for survival, when plunged into poverty, is a consuming activity. And we survived. I own that and all that it implies. There are parts of that story no one else knows or needs to know. 

Does it get easier? No. It gets different. I am not sure it gets harder, but the focus changes as we age. Family means something else and time replaces a chunk of responsibility with respect. We may regret what we built (or failed to build) into our families, but we recognize that our power to heal or wound them is diminished. We are no longer the critics of society (or family) but the ones under indictment. The saddest part is that we are usually judged and sentenced before any inquiry begins. The sweetest part is that the most important judges are usually prejudiced in our favor, at least a bit.

My tiredness is a pure form - I go to bed too late and get up too early, and do too much between the two. I don't know how or why others experience tiredness, but mine is not due to being worldworn if I understand the term. When I am tired, I am  not usually missing my youth or the age to come - just my pillow and my sheets. 

If there is anything we can do to be of help to you and your brothers right now, we are here. Also, if you need anything tangible, please let us know. Don't do without.
