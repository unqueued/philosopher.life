title: 2019.05.11 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Class Consciousness

!! Respond to the following gem:

In the United States you're not allowed to talk about class differences. In fact, only two groups are allowed to be class-conscious in the United States. One of them is the business community, which is rabidly class-conscious. When you read their literature, it's all full of the danger of the masses and their rising power and how we have to defeat them. It's kind of vulgar, inverted Marxism. The other group is the high planning sectors of the government. They talk the same way â€” how we have to worry about the rising aspirations of the common man and the impoverished masses who are seeking to improve standards and harming the business climate. So they can be class-conscious. They have a job to do. But it's extremely important to make other people, the rest of the population, believe that there is no such thing as class. We're all just equal, we're all Americans, we live in harmony, we all work together, everything is great.

I've seen capitalists, wealthy people, and to some extent their reactionaries who mis-self-identify themselves as temporarily embarrassed millionaires that aim to virtue signal and protect their delusion who are clearly allowed to in-group and be class-conscious in the open. I see many proles who are wildly misdirected as well.

Peer pressure and status jockeying (among Boomers especially) create solid and predictable sociopolitical structures and incentives to enable the elite to enslave others to varying [[dok]]. They form a significant portion of openly accepted class-consciousness. I do not anticipate the success of the proletariat waking up and congealing enough to do anything about it. I pray to the void I'm wrong.

Vulgar inverted Marxism often takes up obviously Marxist descriptive positions in order to recognize threats to centralized power. They have to couch it a bit differently since they need to despise Marxism as Leftism, but they still harness the basic concepts. 

I simply haven't seen enough high planning sectors of government to speak about the other group. I would be shocked if it weren't conservative (which includes neoliberals) and well within the overton window though. Our current government serves the interest of the elite, though conceptually it need not.

Indeed, it's important to those in power to push enlightened-centrism (reactionary false compromises) and various political-right movements to silence, quell, restrict, confuse, demoralize, hollow out from the inside, make fun of, or splinter effective opposition to the centralization of power. I see it clearly even in nice or otherwise intelligent people. Few recognize the necessity of violent kindness in various contexts.
