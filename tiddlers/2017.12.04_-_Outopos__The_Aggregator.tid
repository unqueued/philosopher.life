We have not incentivized thinking about it as much as we could. These aggregators are strong, but they could be wildly stronger. We want to tune the signal-to-noise ratios up very high. Forced participation may be key. Perhaps we should be required to comment in various ways. Perhaps there would be a useful way to rank users publicly for ourselves. We can tune what we see. We should all be running our own filters programmatically (with help, perhaps).

This is a forced cooperation problem, a prisoner's dilemma solving the issue.
