title: 2020.03.03 - Prompted Introspection: Hateworthy Disease

!! Which disease known to humankind do you hate the most? Explain why.

Oh, [[Saint Diogenesocrates]], I am lucky to meet you again. I'm sorry that I've not been able to attend to my [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] project for quite some time. For now, this is what I have for us. 

Of course, it's sometimes delicious and perhaps even more rarely useful to directly answer questions about what I hate the most [[2018.04.28 - Prompted Introspection Log: Human Disease]] in a given context.

[[Virtue is Knowledge]]. Epistemology cannot be peeled apart from moral duty (it's incoherent or hypothetical at best). Willful ignorance and choosing not to intend to be wise is the disease I hate the most. Maybe that is not much of a standardly conceived disease, but memeplexes can be much like viruses. I do not seek the end of suffering tout court, but I seek reasonable suffering.
