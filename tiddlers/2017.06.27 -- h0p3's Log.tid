!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

My health has been fine. I've been having intense dreams, which is often a sign of stress for me. I am sleeping though. The chest tightening of anxiety is there too. The lack of cannabis of the past months has been workable, but it would help now. No go, however. I must continually pass drug tests for the foreseeable future.

!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

My parents contacted us yesterday. They want to talk. Our last meeting went poorly. I'm really tired of being hurt. I can't afford it at this point. I don't have Cannabis as a tool to overcome it, and I've got a ton on my plate. I can't afford to be affected by their lack of empathy and sensitivity at this point in time. There is too much riding on the next few weeks going smoothly to risk it.

I also had a vivid nightmare about being in the car with my parents. 

I have to say, I think it may just be better not to call them.

!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

I'm at a crucial point in my life, and they emotionally hinder rather than help me. They are vampires, and that's just not what we need right now. I'm not here to feed their Baby boomer narcissism and acquiesce to their delusional feelings of entitlement to biblical parental worship (beliefs and feelings which they cannot hide from me).<<ref "1">> I'm sure they would have some parallel remark, as they despise millennial culture and their own children to boot.<<ref "2">> Ultimately, I don't have the energy for them, and that's in no small part their fault. I wish it were otherwise. I only have so many spoons to go around, and that is not a wise investment of myself right now. It is far from obvious to me that their memetic infection is useful to my children, and their half-assed attempts at a relationship with my children (let alone foregoing the duties to their own children) is only marginally better than what I had with my own grandparents.<<ref "3">> I hope that changes in time, but it won't be this month.

!! What are you going to do about what happened?

I'm going to ignore it and focus on what matters. I'm not convinced the risks are worth the rewards at this point.
