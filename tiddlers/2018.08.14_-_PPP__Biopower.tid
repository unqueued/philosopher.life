* social power as forming strategies embodying intentions of their own, above those of individuals engaged in them
* an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugations of bodies and the control of populations”
* power over life
* [power] that gave itself the function of administering life
* power to foster life or to disallow it to the point of death
* Two Poles
*# Anatomo-politics; individuation; disciplinary power over body, but also physician's individuated care to foster health (isolated from collective)
*# Bio-politics; category called "the population" as distinct from a simple aggregate of individuals????
* It contrasts to coercive death threats from sovereigns. 
* Species-preserving practices are exercises of biopower.
* power to enhance life
* softpower of decentralized network of self-sustaining relations
* that endeavors to administer, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations
* effective administration of bodies and the calculated management of life through means that are scientific and continuous.
* the power of experts and administrators.
* individuals work on themselves in the name of individual or collective life or health.
* Biopower thus names the way in which biopolitics is put to work in society
* an ensemble of institutions, procedures, analyses, reflections, calculations, and tactics that allow a complex power to be exercised with its target as the population at large
*  individuals for Foucault are as much products of as participants in games of power.

So you have a period characterized principally by sovereign power, then the "rise" of disciplinary power causes some displacement but sovereign power still operates there alongside it, etc...

Sovereign Power:

# The relation between the sovereign and the non-sovereign is an unequal relation of levy-expenditure. The sovereign takes whatever the sovereign likes from within his territory, but gives back in an unequal way as well. Sovereign power is only felt in the extraction of resources in the levy-expenditure system.
# The sovereign power has a "founding procedure," meaning that there is some external principle by with the sovereign relation is authorized.<<ref "c">> 
# Relations in sovereign power aren't "isotopic," which means that relations of sovereignty between different elements within a society aren't the same; sovereign power operates largely in relation to different groups of people rather than individuals.

Disciplinary power:

# Disciplinary power exercises a "total control" rather than levy-expenditure. e.g. instead of beheading, you could be imprisoned.
# Disciplinary power is "continuous[ly]" operating on the body.
# Relations in disciplinary power are isotopic; they are individuating, rigid, and replicated throughout society.

Biopower:

# If sovereign power is characterized by letting live and making die, and disciplinary power is controlling life, then biopower is making live and letting die. The mechanism of sovereign power is deprivation, disciplinary power is mastery, and biopower is fostering.
# If sovereign power is discontinuous reauthorization, and if disciplinary power is continuous control, then biopower is invisible regulation (perhaps a panopticon)
# Biopower's innovative function occurs at the level of the "population."

Leper Example:

# Sovereign power places levy on diseased body; you are forced to leave upon infection.
# Disiplinary Power totalizes control and monitors individuals; everyone is quarantined?
# Biopower would have us first vaccinate the most vulnerable populations, fostering life through calculative logic, bringing the riskiest populations closer to that normalized position. Low-risk innoculation losses are acceptable insofar as they are the effect of a process that otherwise fosters life.<<ref "u">>

It remains unclear to me why I should buy these distinctions. It's pretty easy to point out contexts in which different forms of power might actually be best. Why not use all three to varying [[dok]], depending on the circumstances? Not having read his body of work or the large body of literature surrounding it, I'd be surprised if these weren't contentious issues. Lots of problem may arise: it seems the mechanics of biopower need not actually be used for [[The Good]] or [[The Right]] at all. I'm not convinced this theory really has access to objective normativity.

What capacities of society? What is [[The Good]] of society? What is the purpose of being human? You literally have to be teleological to know what you are computing towards. What is human flourishing? If you hold differentiationist vs OOO stances, you may walk away with radically different thoughts on what we ought to do too.

Biopower/politics (however it is best to distinguish them) sounds like an empirical investigation, but you have to define, explain, and justify the goal before you can talk about the means. This looks like handwaiving consequentialist reasoning that doesn't remotely try to solve the real metaethical foundational problems. It borders on saying the obvious to me, and so I'm worried that I must missing something huge!

I hate to be an asshole, but I'm worried this is buzzword. I don't see what this solves or what's new about it (of course, I think Plato and Aristotle are still gods among men).
