title: 2017.10.13 - Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up at 9:30. I'm going to try to normalize my schedule. 
* Routing Morning Routine.
* Cleaned up and prepped to leave.
* Gave my brother the $500 back. He gave a gift to me (so as to not have any hard feelings if I didn't pay the loan back), and I am incredibly grateful to him. We really fucking needed it. He really helped us out.
* Traveled.
** Son puked. Carsickness. Been a long time since that has happened. We need to get meds and prep more for this. I felt really bad for him.
** Good news though, my daughter (and perhaps son) are hooked on //Dune//. Woot!
* Inform the Men!
* Uh....unexpected hard sleep until 1:30am.
** #rekt; amazing sex.
