!! Audit:

* Metacognition about my desires are cordoned off. They could technically go in [[CTS]], but they shouldn't. You are literally this fucking awful at executive functioning. <3.
** What's weird though I'm reliving the month through this thing of what I want or felt I needed. 
* It's so weird to see the last days of being in JC. It feels like so much has happened since then (though, it has also flown by...and I will never understand how to make those coherent).
* You feelings about the interwebs were wrong! =) It was better than you felt.
* So many small jokes for me. Delicious.
* My offspring haven't really been wandering.
** They've not really been doing their work either. Give it time.
* You did the big things in the right order. 
* You can tell when I got sick. I'm not bursting with thoughts in [[TDL]]. Just trying to survive.
* We still never quite got the room the way my wife wants. Not much I can do solo though. 
** It it much, much better though. She has lots of little things she has to make purty.
* Lots of me telling myself to rest.
* Ended up having to buy a modem anyway. Womp womp.
* Part of me wanted to attend, but I am convinced it would have been a waste of my emotional energy.
* I'm sad to see the same things on the list over the course of weeks. Not all of it was up to me though.
