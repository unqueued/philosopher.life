title: 2019.07.28 - Prompted Introspection: Time Capsule

!! What would you put in a time capsule to be opened by the next generation?

I have no idea how many generations will be left. I don't know what will be useful to them. Times are a'changin'. I'm open to the possibility the next generation(s) will be post-extinction, but I have no idea how long it would take for resources to develop again for them to modernize like us. That would have to be a special time capsule for them to find it so deep in the Earth. I suppose it might be safer on the moon, with radioactive signaling in some symbol to point.

I'll go with some uber [[5D-Glass|https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2016/02/5d-data-storage-update.page]], lots of duplicates, and 100MB from every person on the planet (although, obviously, that which could enable this cooperation to prevent the extinction). I'd have my wiki on there. Doy.
