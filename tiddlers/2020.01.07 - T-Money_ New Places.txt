How was your weekend?
Jan 7 4:23pm
It was a shorter weekend. Two days instead of my 3. It was good. We went out to eat. Went to a movie. It was good. How is camping indoors?
Jan 7 5:07pm
Cool. What movie did ya see?
Jan 7 5:25pm
Camping indoors has been good. I've been sick, so that sucks. Hopefully, the pods come tomorrow.

Everyone looks happy in that vidya

Have you be able to do any exploring? How is the new place? Students are back in Berea. (it gives me an odd feeling of regression and anxiety I hope I can overcome quickly)
Jan 7 6:42pm
We hit the ground running, and even our exploration has mostly been for survival (figuring out my wife's work route, whether or not she'll take the buses, finding the nearest walmart supercenter, etc.). I am surprised by how much is in walking distance of our home. Fairly heavy traffic, and nervous about sending my offspring on their own onto the streets (they traveled to Goodwill and back today, and we practiced getting to the grocery store and what not).
Jan 7 6:45pm
That is your goal and focus. I'm glad you can concentrate on your priorities more.
Jan 7 6:51pm
Doing unschooling with them the past month.
Jan 7 6:52pm
Unschooling?
Jan 7 6:52pm
Unprogrammed. They choose what they are doing. Have to provide me proof of work. Only so much I can get them do while cracking a whip. At some point, they have to give a shit. Lol.
Jan 7 6:53pm
I'm sorry that spending time at Berea gives you mixed feelings which include anxiety and a feeling of regression. I am sure it must be surreal too.
Jan 7 6:55pm
Think they could switch you to 13h shifts?
Jan 7 6:55pm
I bet it will grow on you some. How much travel time does it save you?
Jan 7 6:57pm
I am lucky to have a flexible 10hr schedule.  It cut my time in half. I haven't been here long enough to truely explore again. I plan on getting the alumni Seabury gym membership. I have alot of plans. My one way is about 45min. So round trip is down to 90min approx.
Jan 7 6:59pm
Much better
Jan 7 7:00pm
I could have got an apartment closer. But I am still doing alot of what you guys are doing. Hanging a picture right now. Trying to make it as homely as possible. I think the isolation kinda brings back a little Berea sorrow. Lol. Hopefully I can dive into some things in the community. I'm trying to do alot at once. But slowly. Moving toward sobriety. Losing weight. Finding happiness. Paying off bills. Lol.

My wife has never had to really move out of her comfort zone. So I'm trying to show her. It can be done. Health insurance is my biggest. Frustration right now. I could. Live and work near my family for less if the costs of Healthcare was actually affordable.
Jan 7 7:03pm
Aye, we both have had a ton of transitions these past few weeks.
Jan 7 7:04pm
Preach, dude. Absurdly expensive. =(
Jan 7 7:04pm
And, you guys have been using your healthcare this past year.
Jan 7 7:04pm
Hopefully, she'll be able to spend some time with you at Berea during your time off, and she might change her mind about that comfort zone.
Jan 7 7:05pm
Hard to imagine she wouldn't like Berea. Very pleasant place in general, but it gets harder to handle that kind of change as the years go on.
Jan 7 7:06pm
They came up new years eve. It was nice. And I got a sweet mouintan bike to start getting healthy. I'm so put of shape small rides and walks get me down.
Jan 7 7:07pm
Out*
Jan 7 7:07pm

Aye, looks solid.
Jan 7 7:26pm
Thanks. It's not cheap but cheaper than most places. It includes all electric, water, and wifi included. And free washer and dryer in the middle of the house for all tenants. So once you consider all the costs of water, electric, sewer, internet... It is a cheap 1 bedroom.
Jan 7 7:33pm
A house that was divided into 4 units. Actually owned by a BC grad.
