Got a couple this morning when i collected my jugs. So we had a fish fry. Subsidized with store bought cod. The girls say they like the cat fish better.

Sounds like fun and good eating.

We're doing well. We've been staying really busy, but I feel like we've been productive and not too frenetic this week.
FRI 9:08 PM
That's is awesome. I am envious of your productivity. Other than my job I have been  kinda a slob around the house.

I bought this from my neighbor. But the engine is shot. It had an electric start but that was shot too.
FRI 9:39 PM
So I'm entertaining ideas of how to convert it to electric using a drill. As the drive motor.
FRI 9:40 PM
That way it would be rechargeable, silent, and fun. Something good at the campgrounds and random other events.

I also have an old weedeatwr and an old backpack blower that have that style engine. They could work with alot of modification.
FRI 9:42 PM
I bought it for $25. So I'm not out alot of money. Lol

I found a $25 electric pink razor today for Samantha. She is in love. Still planning on fixing mine with a drill modification.
