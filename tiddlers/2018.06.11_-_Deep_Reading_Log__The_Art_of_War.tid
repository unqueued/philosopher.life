title: 2018.06.11 - Deep Reading Log: The Art of War

I'm pleased to have the historical context.

This concubine story is famous. =)

Meritocratic. 

It is gross how this is used for things I disagree with.

Interesting to see how the military strategist/metagamer takes himself to have the status of a philosopher.

Ch 1 - Calculation before War

Ch 2 - Risks of military operations

Ch 3 - Most to least efficient strategy spectrum (violence last refuge of the incompetent)

Ch 4 - ...

Trying to invent new models of warfare.

Honesty, on this commenter's argument, is not for the sake of the moral law.

Clear virtue theory.

Plenty of Dao related ideas going on here.

The lecturer is clearly head over heels in love with Capitalism.

Jesus. He idolizes Ford's ability to extract maximize value from others for his own ends.

It seems to me that the Art of War gives people excellent aphoristic wisdom bones to which the speaker adds the meat.

The way the lecturer puts it, this seems to give some ancient credibility to our cutthroat modern world. Like, he's moved beyond description into prescription, and not merely the instrumental kind.

Alright, I've had enough. This just isn't my style generally.
