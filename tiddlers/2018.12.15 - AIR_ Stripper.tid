My brother called me on his break at work. Seems like it's okay. He told me about talking to his roommate about getting a male stripper for X-mas (she sounded enthused with her date right there; he attempted twice to avoid saying it). 

Also, my brother wrote in his wiki (we are the only two people who can see it; though my wife and daughter could find it on my machine if they chose). He's written 3 days in a row. That borders on being a habit. =)

He's reading [[Borne]]. That is awesome. It may be the best book I've read this year.

Most importantly, my brother is clearly digesting his situation. I ''echo'' my brother's concern on the 14th!!
