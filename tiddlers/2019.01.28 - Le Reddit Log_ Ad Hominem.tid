Reactionaries are selfish and they conveniently rationalize their way to whatever is necessary for their hedonic pleasure. They don't owe you a fucking thing, mate. That little girl drowning in the pool next to them: who gives a shit? It's much better to just play vidja games and ignore her. Just do whatever makes you feel happy; surely that is the right thing to do.
