!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family?

* 1uxb0x
** It's wonderful to see you happier with your tools, with your verbosity, with your expressiveness, your thoughtfulness, with your interest in appearance, and that overall you seem more hopeful. Good job; that is hard work.
** It's cool that you keep trying to make things and are curious about how things work.
** You've been keeping your phone with you more, maintaining reachability.
* j3d1h
** It fills me with joy to see you take your unschooling seriously. I hope you find things you can be passionate about.
** You responded to adults as a peer, and not merely as a kid. We appreciate that you communicate with us. 
** I appreciate the way you follow the church service.
* k0sh3k
** I feel stupid saying it, but you taught me to take care of myself, to be my own advocate, to actually pursue it. I know I made fun of your webMD syndrome, but you were right. Thank you for teaching me what it means to heal myself, to pursue it, etc.
** You took our mistake and made it better: the salad. 
** Thank you for not being a bitch on the rag. (translated version of my daughter's compliment..."heavily" paraphrased)
* h0p3
** Thank you for taking care of me while I was on the rag.
** Thank you for worrying about us.
** Thank you for giving me good suggestions for unschooling.
