title: 2017.10.16 - Pipefitting Log

Our car is dead. We are trading it (hopefully for the full value we paid) for a different one. I want one with fewer miles. Now that I know that I will be dividing my toolsets into smaller compartments so that I can move them more effectively, I can also afford to have a smaller vehicle. This is a good thing. 

We will get another vehicle on Wednesday. I was thinking we would do our shopping that day as well.
