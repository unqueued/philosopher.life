title: Unethical Hacks and Tricks

This is scumbag territory, no doubt. However, there is something inside each of us which at least appreciates cleverness. The cracks in the system are there. We are all deeply manipulable. Obviously, I don't intentionally engage in this behavior. I'm not condoning it either. As an analogy, I can appreciate Nazi blitzkrieg without actually attaching any positive normative force to it. These ideas can be hilarious and intriguing to think about. 

Aphorisms, Truisms, and Social Facts:

*Sometimes it's easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.
* Look like you belong.
** Corollary: look busy.
** It's easy to trespass with maintenance crew gear, an orange safety jacket, a clipboard, etc.
* The first person to talk loses.
** Humans have a hard time dealing with silence, social awkwardness, etc. 
** As an aside, direct multi-second eye contact is a strong social catalyst
* People will remember not what you said but how you made them feel.
* Most people like talking about themselves so ask lots of questions about them.
* When a group of people laugh, people will instinctively look at the person they feel closest to in that group.
* Always be honest so when you have to lie, people will believe you.
* You can judge the character of a person by how they treat people who can do absolutely nothing for them.
* The key to confidence is walking into a room and assuming everyone already likes you.

Getting a job:

*Get a burner phone and use yourself as a reference on job applications. 
*If you have gaps in your résumé, fill your work history with fake freelance computer work or renovations.
** International work and references you control may help
* Use tiny, white font (or black on black lines/objects) to pack keywords into your résumé in order to trigger automated parsing/searching 
** From what I understand, they are getting better at catching this.
* For interviews, the Primacy Effect: schedule interviews early, since items are more memorable if they are presented earlier. 

Saving money (i.e. theft):

* Continental breakfasts at hotels are there for the eating.
* Most paid car parks have a 'lost ticket' button which is the maximum daily fee. If you feel like parking for a week or so, just press that button instead of paying for the week.
* For a show/game/etc., buy cheap tickets, research empty/unused/unsold expensive tickets, and act like you belong where you don't.
* If something you own breaks, just buy a replacement and return the broken one to the store.
** Watch for serials, make sure they have relaxed return policies, etc.
* Similarly, liberal return policies can essentially act as free rental policies.
* Get free food at any fast food restaurant by calling or pulling up and saying they forgot a burger or fry in your order
* Complaints in the service industry (whether in person or over the phone) will often result in having your service comped. 
* Self-checkout is exactly what it sounds like.

Saving Time:

* Want something on Craigslist from another town but dont want to travel? Ask them to meet you half way, but claim to live in a place twice the distance that you actually do from them. You live at the midpoint now.
* Print out your own handicap permit.

Social Engineering and psychological hacks:

* At a crowded bar, and can't get a seat? Go up to the hottest woman there, and hit on her. She'll leave in disgust, and you can take her seat.
* Unexpected, raw, open aggression, particularly for one-time meetings, causes flight mechanics. 
** You can also use it privately and be two-faced in public settings. That will drive them insane.
* Simply say "Thank you to compliments" and freely offer compliments when it benefits you.
* If someone doesn't completely answer a question, just keep eye contact and don't say anything. They will eventually complete the thought.
* If you want to make someone do something make them chose between two things (a.k.a False Dichotomy).
** False compromise does something very similar. Take a more extreme position than you need, and act like you've compromised when taking up your original position.
* When walking into a crowd, don't make eye contact with oncoming people. Look past everyone, and they'll move out of your way.
* If you want someone to do something, ask it in question form rather than giving it as an imperative order. 
* If you want to convince someone it's not the facts that matter but the confidence with which they are presented.
* Saying someone's name improves their opinion of you. 
* Repeating back what someone says in a different way ("so what you're saying is,") after they say it makes them think you are a good listener and a good person.
* Touch someone's right arm when suggesting they should do something for you, they're more likely to do it.
* If you really want something from someone, frame it as an offer rather than a request.
* Foot-in-the-door/gradual commitment phenomenon: people are more likely to agree to do a task for you if you ask them to do something simpler first.
** This is a form of false compromise
* If you get yourself to be really happy and excited to see other people, they will react the same to you.
* If you have a warm hand when you shake somebody's hand, you immediately become a more desirable person to get along with.
* People have a certain image of themselves and will fight tooth and nail to cling to it. You can avoid insulting someone by not saying anything that shows you perceive them differently than what they're trying to present.
* Romance: Look up the false attribution of arousal. Basically, if you want to make someone like you, get their heart rate going.
* Attractiveness: Wearing red. For women, the color red makes them exponentially more attractive.
* Seeking Approval: Body mirroring. Works well for interviews.
* In debates, do not state or stance or background (since this induces your audience to see you as biased), instead just give your argument.
* Reminding people of their death will make them more likely to follow a charismatic leader.
* The placebo effect is actually more powerful than some medications. 
* Pay attention to people's feet. If you approach two people in the middle of a conversation, and they only turn their torsos and not their feet, they don't want you to join in the conversation.


Work hacks:

* If you want to sound sick when calling into work, lie on your back while hanging your head over the edge of the bed. You will sound congested.
* Many employers legally cannot call you into work if you claim to be intoxicated.
* Shit at work, not at home.
**Just don't shit yourself out of a job.
* Live-booting drives, USB-Wireless adapter, any source of interwebs, and a smart desktop appearance allows you to own most machines without detection
** There are definite exceptions. You'd have to know what you are doing.
