title: 2017.12.27 - Prompted Introspection Log: Weather

!! What is the weather like today? How do you feel about it?

Oscillates between shorts weather and being cold enough that I wish I could cover my nose. I don't go outside as much as I should. I need to. I know it's important to get outside and exercise. I'm being irrational and unwise when I don't. 

My mother-in-law seemed worried about bad weather during my trip next week.<<ref "2018.12.24">> I think we'll be okay. I hope so, at least. What's the worst that could happen? =)

I guess I don't have enormous feelings about the weather in a micro sense. Macroscopically, I feel like these are the warmest winters I've ever experienced. I remember it being a hell of a lot colder when I was a kid. I remember snow in October. That would be unthinkable at this point. 

I'm fine consuming the planet in a way that most Leftists are not. It is clear that we are in a race to become cybernetic before we destroy the planet and ourselves. We are clearly consuming ourselves very inefficiently and immorally. Jon Snow is right about the fact that we are sending our armies entirely in the wrong direction.
