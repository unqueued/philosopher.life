*** Knew it was going to happen. Let us see how it goes through execution and adjudication. I am quite worried.
*** Kill monopolies and oligopolies, make this public infrastructure, jail those who lied and stole, etc. Lol. Nope, not going to happen. We must win this virtually and eventually by mesh.

* Preach, yo!

*** You put it on the interwebs, public by definition. Scraping, pinging, and DDOSing are not crimes. Wake up.
*** Don't you see the implications of this? This is just anit-competitive practices, centralizing silos and protecting them, etc. The hypocrisy is also incredibly hard to bear. Do you know LinkedIn became what it did? And now they litigate for the same thing.

*** I should add this is too gorgeous, and that is a reason not to trust it. Obviously, it gets a lot right.

*** Of course, I think this was brilliant.

*** Sounds about right.

* Think About It

*** I fucking hate these people, and I think they continue to confuse prescription and description. Yet, I must have the integrity to admit they are sometimes right.

*** That doesn't make any sense. It's so damn expensive. Is this what the world will continue to become? Is infrastructure, legal compliance, and logistics in general so complex that we must centralize this hard? I am very worried. Admittedly, few people can do full stack development for even small things. Why aren't we building better open tools? There are no incentives. This is what governments are for, you stupid pieces of shit. May you all burn in hell. How else will you break the prisoner's dilemma?

*** Why so late to the party? I believe MS is ceding ground. They cannot control the ecosystem and compete like they want. They can't have the lock-in monopoly they desire. I trust it not (even though I may use it).
