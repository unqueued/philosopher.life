Summaries (NOT ALL MY WORK!)

Are laws to be conceived of as coercive orders or as moral commands?

Hart claims there is no logical connection between (1) law and coercion or between (2) law and morality.

Laws can have different purposes, functions, content, modes of origin, and ranges of application. Hart is a legal positivist, in part, because otherwise (he thinks) we’re oversimplifying, mischaracterizing, and overgeneralizing the law.

I must ask, if law and morality have no connection, why should I care about law? Why is it important? Why should I follow it? Why does it matter? What makes laws meaningful? How should we create or change laws? I wish to note there is a huge difference between prescribing law and describing it. I can see a Kantian explain that laws which are not in accord with morality have no meaning, although we might describe them as laws, they aren’t prescriptive in any sense. A “good” or “right” law, however, seems entirely tied down to having some notion of morality. Anytime we might approach prescription, rightness, goodness, or significance, I just don’t see how we aren’t asking something moral (I have moral rationalist intuitions though). To claim that laws are some relevant standard of conduct when they aren’t necessarily connected to morality must be justified. If legal positivism is true, they have to show me why laws are any more significant than some standards of conduct that I pulled out of my ass. He’s doing descriptive sociology, badly.

Laws do at least one of the following:

    forbid action

    impose obligation

    require punishment or the exertion of coercive powers over those who do not comply with the law

    specify how official documents are contracts are to be arranged and created

    specify how legislatures and courts are to be assembled and function

    specify how new laws are enacted

    specify how old laws are to be changed

    confer powers or privileges to individuals or institutions

Not all of these seem directly coercive, but they all seem indirectly coercive, no?

Hart critiques Austin’s claim in “The Province of Jurisprudence Determined” that laws are the coercive commands of a legally unlimited sovereign which impose duties or obligations on individuals. The criticism is that a law may always be imposed to the sovereign (who is thus not legally unlimited), and that conferring powers isn’t coercive (I wish to add, “not directly” – since I’m not convinced it is true otherwise).

Laws which impose duty or obligation are primary rules of obligation (first order laws). Secondary rules are rules of recognition, change, or adjudication (resolving disputes over interpretation and application) regarding primary rules (second order laws).

Both kinds of rules must be clear and intelligible since vagueness and ambiguity create uncertainty. (Ha, our system doesn’t seem like that. So, to what extent? In what ways? Etc.).

Legal systems can’t live on primary laws alone. Secondary laws advance us from a pre-legal stage to a legal stage. Neither primary rules nor secondary are (by themselves) sufficient as a system of laws, and while it isn’t clear that Hart thinks they are each necessary (I assume he does though), he does think that together (in “union”) they are sufficient for having a valid and established legal system.

There are two aspects or points of view for describing or evaluating a law: external and internal. The law applies to the internal, but it doesn’t to the external observer. Hart seems to think those ruled by and making laws must take on the internal view and take laws to be normative…so…in order for there to be laws, most people couldn’t be legal positivists, since they don’t take laws to be normative, else there wouldn’t be laws.

“Hart argues that the foundations of a legal system do not consist, as Austin claims, of habits of obedience to a legally unlimited sovereign, but instead consist of adherence to, or acceptance of, an ultimate rule of recognition by which the validity of any primary or secondary rule may be evaluated” (1994, pg 110). Wtf is an ultimate rule of recognition?

If (1) people don’t obey the primary rules and (2) legal officials don’t accept and obey the secondary rules, then there isn’t a legal system (although primary rules are sufficient for a pre-legal system – wtf pre-legal means, I don’t know).

First, (1) and (2) should be true at all. I think even if most folks don’t obey a law doesn’t mean it isn’t a law, by description. Adding this “obeying” requirement is just ad hoc. If I’m going to accept the pure descriptive nature of laws, why should I take this obeying requirement? Why does it matter whether or not it is obeyed? A law is a law, even if most people disobey it, on a descriptive (positivist) account, right? It doesn’t seem like enforceability should matter. If it does, where do we draw the line? How many people have to not obey the law? Do laws come in degrees? The lines seem arbitrary here.

Further, in this light, I admit that laws merely seem descriptive, in the same way as how moral propositions aren’t really prescriptive, but rather descriptive, in the context of cultural moral relativism. But, I don’t see why laws matter then.

As far as I can tell, GOOD or RELEVANT laws are a subset or product of morality (although, not all real laws are good laws). The normativity of laws isn’t separate from morality, but only morality can confer normativity on law. Maybe the descriptive definition of law doesn’t have to be logically connected to morality, but I don’t see why prescriptive law which has any normative force couldn’t be logically connected to morality. Maybe Hitler made some deeply immoral laws. Sure, I’ll call them laws, but they aren’t the kinds of laws which necessarily have any direct normative force. Maybe we should follow certain immoral laws because the coercive/punitive consequences of not following them are so awful that we should follow the law, but again, the source of “should” is not legal, but rather moral. We’ve taken an awful situation, applied moral reasoning, and come out with a moral answer.

Maybe morality doesn’t ground all laws, but it must be the ground of any laws that matter. That’s just the definition of something mattering – it is grounded by morality. Nothing is normative without the ‘say so’ of morality. Hardcore moral rationalism begs the question to save the day again!

Admittedly, laws change, but it isn’t clear that morality (I so want to call it moral law) does.

Hart is a soft positivist, as he thinks rules of recognition may consider the compatibility and compatibility of a rule with morality for determining validity.

I fear that legal positivists might run the risk of thinking that when I say “civil laws must be based on moral laws” that I’m saying that civil laws are directly compatible with moral laws. For example, maybe a utilitarian knows that certain laws won’t be followed (let’s say intellectual property laws) by the vast majority of individuals (which means they aren’t laws…which is weird), and actually that making it illegal to even visit a piracy website, like the Pirate Bay, actually increases the likelihood that individuals would visit and use TPB. Maybe increasing the usage of TPB and piracy would maximize utility, and so the creation of intellectual property laws would actually be a good thing, since people would go out of their way to disobey it. The letter of the civil law contradicts the purpose or aims of moral reasoning in this case, but as you can see, the civil law is still based on moral law.

“Hart criticizes both formalism and rule-scepticism as methods of evaluating the importance of rules as structural elements of a legal system.” He thinks formalism is too rigid and inflexible, being unable to adapt rules to particular cases. Rule skepticism produces uncertainty in the application of rules to the point that all cases must be adjudicated. Both criticisms seem to think there is a goldilocks virtuous measure of the mean of adjudication which occurs in real law (it can’t be none, and it can’t be all). I don’t see why. This seems to be a discussion of what makes a good or useful law, but why should we important prescriptive notions into a descriptive theory? This seems ad hoc. Even if you want just an ounce of prescription built into your conceptual analysis of law, then you bite the prescriptive bullet, and the legal positivist game is over.

International laws aren’t really laws, due to unenforcability, sovereignty issues, etc. Why not just say they aren’t very effective laws? They still seem like laws to me.

Judicial interpretation, via clarification and adjudication, can essentially create laws.

Chapter 1 –

Hart address three questions:

    How does law differ from and how is it related to orders backed by threats?

    How does legal obligation differ from, and how is it related to, moral obligation?

    What are rules and to what extent is law an affair of rules?"

In answering these questions, Hart addresses the question “What is law?”.



Chapter 2 –

Hart examines laws, commands, and orders. He pays particular attention to coercive orders. He discusses the variety of laws.



Chapter 4 –

Hart addresses the relationship between sovereign and subject. He discusses the habit of obedience and the continuity and persistence of law, and examines legal limitations on legislative power and the sovereign behind the legislature.



Chapter 6 –

The foundations of a legal system are rule of recognition and legal validity.



Legal Positivism (NOT ALL MY WORK!)

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/

Law is a social construction.

Positivism seems to have its roots in Hobbesian, Humean, and Benthamian thought. It started with the notion of law being the command of a sovereign back by force. My view: Why should it be anything else on a descriptive account? Why isn’t everything else ad hoc?

Imho, a legal positivist is in no position to ever say: “law should be applied, made, or enforced” - “should” is a powerful, normative word which belongs to the domain of morality. Now, maybe the argument against me is that I’m begging the question about a relationship between morality and law, but I think I can say the same thing to the positivist. They’ve made assumption, and I don’t think they can back it up.

Worse, I don’t see why positivist’s law isn’t an important distinction from other kinds of norms, habits, or institutional requirements (maybe Tulane’s code of conduct, for instance). Laws are just the commands of sovereigns, and the definitions of sovereign and command seem quite large and inclusive. I see no reason to pick a very selective set of those definitions out to define law. Just as Hart criticizes Bentham and Austin for having a definition of law which is arbitrarily narrow, I think Hart’s positivist definition of law is also arbitrarily narrow. It is all arbitrary without a moral compass or measuring stick. I don’t see how anything is separated from morality, even description seems implausible to me without bringing a set of values to the table.

Where does the authority of law come from? Real authority, to me, seems definitionally a moral issue.

Hart thinks the authority of law is social. “The ultimate criterion of validity in a legal system is neither a legal norm nor a presupposed norm, but a social rule that exists only because it is actually practiced.” Practiced to what extent though? Without that standard, we still don’t have an answer.



http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/

Bentham and Austin’s Sovereign is too monistic and reductivist. Too monistic in that it makes laws with a single form, and the authority doesn’t seem to have laws that can be made about him. Too reductivist in that it attempts to reduce law and its other concepts, rights, dutities, etc, down to power and obedience, making no room for other normative concepts.

In advanced societies, maybe no single individual or monolithic entity can be said to have all the characteristics sufficient for sovereignty.

Why is legislative authority so much different from having a great social power? Ok. So, it is a specific kind of social power, maybe. What makes that authority so unique.



I have a problem calling thinking that one of the most distinctive features of law is that it is normative, but that it somehow isn’t connected to morality (logically connected). That normativity is no different than just me making rules up. It only has real normativity in virtue of morality.
