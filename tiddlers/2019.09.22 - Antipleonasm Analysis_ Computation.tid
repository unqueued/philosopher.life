title: 2019.09.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Computation

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Being able to use a computer is like being able to drive a car. After a little practice and learning a few rules most cars are pretty easy to just get in and drive. It takes a little more effort to learn to drive stick, and formula one cars are only driven by professionals.

Computer programming is like building, modding, or repairing your car — you can learn but it’s an activity done basically only by hobbyists and professionals.

Troubleshooting computer issues is like car maintenance. Everyone can fill the tank with gas, most people can change a tire, fewer can change their oil, and fewer still can jump a battery.

For the love of all that is holy, stahp with the computer/car analogies. It is a dangerous sentiment, and I hold you morally accountable for rhetoric which serves to centralize power and enslave our species. 

I grant that virtue of a practice can be analogized to others. I grant that both tools can be used for transportation, and they both drive our economy.<<ref "i">> I agree variations of both devices are crucial to navigating our infrastructures, being mobile enough to connect to many social spheres, and are direct or indirect necessities in the 21st century. I can even see truth in the above analogies, but the problem is the implication of a reduction. It's a mistake to conflate and lump these together in most cases. I swear up and down to goddess, if you utter the phrases "competitive advantage" or "specialized knowledge" unironically one mo' time, I'm gonna slap you.<<ref "a">> They are radically different tools for Dasein.

Computers inform our practice and theory; they are philosophical tools like none other. Dasein emerges from a computer inside computers (though I do not claim //mere// computers). There is no cognition and existential [[phenomenology]] without computation. Computers are ethically far more complex than cars because you can nest and represent //virtually// anything^^tm^^ with them. A computer is philosophically a special kind of object; it's instrumental in a way that non-turing machines cannot be. The very idea of a computer is fundamental to everything, including that which dialectically cannot be computed in spacetime (or at all, perhaps). Using and learning about computers should alter how you perceive reality again and again. We build entire worlds within nested worlds with computers, and no motor vehicle (excepting the hundreds and perhaps thousands of computers we now place in them) can do anything of the sort.

Your ability to build, mod, repair, and drive isn't necessarily relevant (though it is helpful to some [[dok]]) to being able to significantly understand the concepts, capacities, and implications of a motor vehicle. You can understand how the world works qua car without being a competent owner of one. The pilot's seat of a computer is another world. It is a moral imperative that everyone becomes as competent as they can with computers they own<<ref "t">> (to whatever [[dok]] we can) because computers are eating the world, because the [[power]] structures of the world evolve in virtue of them, because we can only have a functioning democracy in the 21st century with a radical and ever-improving literacy in the nature of computing (it's part of why I predict we are so screwed), and, finally, because we cannot understand ourselves and [[The Telos]] effectively enough without at least computing about the limits of computation.
