I got turned d down for 6 jobs with lockheed martin. A company I already work for.
SEP 30 2:18 PM
Ouch. That is frustrating.
SEP 30 2:18 PM
I am surprised.
SEP 30 2:19 PM
Why do you think that occurred? 
SEP 30 2:19 PM
I am qualified to work on their aircraft. The bread winners of their dollars but they don't want me as a planner. Discussion is most likely my current salary is more than the level 2 planner and they can find more qualified personnel who will accept less.
SEP 30 2:19 PM
Like. This was discussed in 3 interviews.
SEP 30 2:20 PM
I have been to halve a dozen interviews this year give or take. And not a single offer.
SEP 30 2:20 PM
It is not the norm for me. Generally if I can get a interview people want me.
SEP 30 2:21 PM
Did you show them your mantitties?
SEP 30 2:21 PM
Sweeten the pot.
SEP 30 2:21 PM
I found out this am I was turning d down for yet another job. That, I'm over qualified for, but I agreed to a lateral move...
SEP 30 2:22 PM
So I said fuck work and took the rest of the week off.
SEP 30 2:22 PM
Haha
SEP 30 2:22 PM
noice.
SEP 30 2:22 PM
How far would you have to move up the ladder to make what you currently do?
SEP 30 2:23 PM
Literally. I didnt make it about being turned down. I said other things to my boss. But as a mechanic no one cares. We are replaceable. Mostly.
SEP 30 2:23 PM
They skew the wage range to make you think you can move laterally. But really they just pay shit wages to everyone else.
SEP 30 2:23 PM
We are protecting cred by the govt due to the fact we are legit military contractors. And they are required to pay a oevaling wage.
SEP 30 2:24 PM
Prevailing
SEP 30 2:24 PM
A mechanic at delta, ups, or FedEx makes twice as much.... It's still bottom of barrel for what we do.
SEP 30 2:25 PM
End rant. Sorry. =) life is ok. I promise.
SEP 30 2:25 PM
How are you good sir. And the fam?
SEP 30 2:27 PM
Reasonable rant. I'm pissed off for you.
SEP 30 2:28 PM
We're good. Had a party last night, very much unlike me.
SEP 30 2:28 PM
Nice. Friends and everything?
SEP 30 2:31 PM
Sunday is an odd day for a party.
SEP 30 2:31 PM
Cause most work on Monday. Is is super bowl or something l
SEP 30 2:31 PM
?
SEP 30 2:31 PM
Sorry, work.
SEP 30 6:12 PM
Aye. Friends. Sunday was the day we could meet; the work absurd hours for the elite. They are The Help.
SEP 30 6:12 PM
I spend too munching time trying to figure out what's next. And I fail to be in the moment. There is no pride in what I've done.
