title: 2019.04.30 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Family Dinner

!! What is your favorite family dinner?

The kind where we sit together and eat with nothing to worry about beyond connecting. We've been heading down to a Mexican restaurant for molé, ceviche, and tacos al pastor on Christmas. Nobody speaks English, y nuestro español es horrible. We take off our coats, the offspring grab whatever sugared drinks they desire, and we feast together. Given the rest of the pressures in our life, it's wonderful to kick back and enjoy being with each other.
