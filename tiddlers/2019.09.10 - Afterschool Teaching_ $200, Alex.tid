title: 2019.09.10 - Afterschool Teaching: $200, Alex

Whitney has convinced me to stop caring about being accurate at all on the paperwork. Yeah, she's right, this is pointless. Will paperpushers be satisfied? Yes. Her prep was as easy at it gets; I've not seen her do it in weeks. I think fastfood has taken it out of her. Our conversation was pleasant. She is increasingly open to hearing my point of view, which I'm grateful for. 

One-on-ones went well. 8L is feeling better, and she even thanked me. She's been more talkative with me. 7CM is barely holding it together, and a social worker came to see her too. Her sister was on edge too. =( 

My quiet girls, 8Af and 8HM and I joked about their standard responses. 8Af talked about her mother's insane schedule (and I suggested her mother loved her a great deal and to let the woman sleep); 8HM talked to me about her routine and how she feels like she has no time to do anything on her own (I can see that). I'm as awkward as it gets.

6JR and his sister are so different to me. He's been swearing a lot (we talk about context, as usual), and I see that farmboy meets geek mentality. He's hilarious. She balances his explosiveness, but she throws the zingers. Their grades might not be topflight, but they are bright. Few maintain eye contact with me like she does; she is searching. Nurse cleared his hand, but he's been complaining for two days now. Hrm.

I have many students who are out sick, and a few who were sick here today (their parents are working their second jobs). I've been coughed on a lot today, but so far no puke. `/fingers-crossed`. Looks like a stomach bug and strep making the rounds.

Magic was fun. I played with 5DB with some watchers. 6JR and 7L are now able to play without too much intervention. Just as answering "Jesus" in church will net you 50% of the correct answers, "it depends on the context" or "read the ~~fucking~~ card" will get you there in beginner magic.

It was interesting seeing Whitney play the bulldog on my behalf with some of these children. Well, that's mighty kind of you.

Tragedy of the commons with our board games. Herding cats. Doesn't matter how many times I speak with them. I have had some improvements. We'll see if I can get there. I highly doubt it.

In the lab, we talked about private browsing modes and clearing our data off our machines. We talked about the nature of using public machines, but I don't think most were listening (who would? I'm boring as fuck). My boys, of course, snickered, understandably after a few of my lines. No, no: that's exactly why you need a browser history on a machine you trust. You see, how are you going to find that vidya again?

Clearly two kissing cousins here. Cute. Hopefully, second, please, or wrap it up. Things I may never utter in person for $200, Alex.

7C was talking to me about using his wiki at home. Neat. I'm not convinced it is working for him, but we'll see. 7L has been into magic but has been heading to the gym. Yeah, just a toy for most of them. Telling ourselves stories is hard work. I don't have anyone who I've found writing fictions yet.

5AO never wants to go home. Most of my students are relieved at least some of the time. Why is she never interested in going home? Her stepdad told her she couldn't have the books at home. We made a place for her. 

7C asked me why I was having each student practice clearing their browser history. I gave him a sardonic answer and he laughed with me. I'm now teasing him way harder because I know he'll find it funny. Also, it's interesting the way he tracks his family through his phone. 

I have a couple children who refuse to leave until they have the chance to say goodbye to me. Melting me fast.

I popped my head in to see [[gh057]] right before I finished off our paperwork and cleanup. He's totally alive when talking about music and concerts.
