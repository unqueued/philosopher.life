My daughter is helping me think about/spot elements of bottom-up and top-down reasoning (she's been reading about the topic) in this wiki and life in general. We talked a great deal yesterday, all 3 of us, about the fact that I lack the aptitude to help them learn how to engage in effective top-down modeling. I might be better than the average person at it (with tons of work still), but it's really very poor compared to my bottom-up reasoning. I'm a bad role model, and they will have to make up for my deficits through their own hard work.

I've been thinking the {[[Projects on this Wiki]]} page, the original gangsta on this wiki, and how it seems to have split into the present {[[Focus]]} and future/nebulous {[[Dreams]]}. I'd like to understand how the hierarchies I've built are a form of top-down vs. bottom-up reasoning. I'm desperately trying to organize myself, and I'd argue I'm doing it poorly.

One good example of my problem, as I've known for a long time on this wiki, is how to effectively use the Tag mechanic in a way that is meaningful to me. I do a lot of work in my Titles. If I understood what I should do and why, I would do it.

I gave {[[Focus]]} a reorganization. I now have an "Obsessions" category, peeling it out of "Projects." Some of this is shorter term. Those projects are big ones that will last a long timeframe, imho. The others are important, but they aren't meant to last in focus as long.

My son and I discussed woodworking quite a bit yesterday. It turned into a couple hours of conversation. I hope I can help him find himself in something that he loves, to help him learn to love himself.

!! PAY ATTENTION GENIUS IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Decentralizing power can be interpreted as decentralizing the power of [[The Good]], as distributing God or God's Will, in a sense. Marxist thought is the pursuit of the Hegellian God.

The Libertarian and Socialist Materialist Dialectic needs to engage in metaphysics more effectively to appreciate [[The Good]].

---

Like a magnet, a whitehole vortex, The Good, God, or whatever, pulls me. I feel compelled to extract, purify, and crystallize the true substance, [[The Good]], from my reagent, Christianity.

Every model can't prove itself. You must write your first compiler by hand. You must bootstrap your way into computation.

Disjunction Elimination on Meaning, The Fork of Objective Truth, Defeating Nihilism through Pascalian Wager:

Either objective truth obtains or it doesn't. If it obtains, then it obtains. If it doesn't obtain, then it doesn't matter that I think it obtains. This is like saying: 

There exists at least one necessary truth, or there doesn't exist at least one necessary truth. But, for there to be not be a necessary truth is logically equivalent to the claim surd. Thus, Necessary, Objective Truth obtains or Surd. From logic, if we take it to be objective truth, we beg the question in doing so, of course, we then can logically deduce that Objective, Necessary Truth obtains from both disjuncts. The first disjunct can be reiterated, and the second disjunct allows us to deduce anything (all sentences are the logical consequence of absurdity), including our goal.

There is objective truth, which is either necessary or contingent, or aburdity. Without being careful, it's something like this:

∃x(□(x)) ∨ ∃x(◇(x)) ∨ ⊥

AI really is the tower of babel in a way. It is a very weird dialectical creature emerging. 


You want to agree to the certainty that moderns are looking for, and postmodernism attempted to do that in good faith, with integrity, and therefore by defintion cannot achieve it. This is Godel's incompleteness theorem in action. You can never have a single language which can prove everything which is true. You can only infinigress into languages, and that eternal, infinite body of computer is God.

The seek certainty requiring logical proof, which Godel imposes the limits on. That is why there are vortexes. Husserl is somehow truly an empiricist in trusting only what he can sense.


Empiricism is fundamentally concerned with bottom-up reasoning, but it looks good when it has good top-down reasoning (science that models is the most effective kind, but science is still fundamentally about starting with sense perception data). Rationalism is concerned with Top-down reasoning, imposing models on the data. Trascendental reasoning occurs here openly.

One of the flaws of Rationalism is the tendency to think everything is necessary. They are so systematic in their top-down modeling that they fail to account for the thing in itself, the sense-perceptions, the way it can be otherwise, etc. Possibility is somehow narrowed out of their scope without enouhg reason.
