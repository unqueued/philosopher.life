I had planned on doing the rest of my studying and interview prep while she drove. Instead I just called into work and said nope... Lol. Not tomorrow. Try again Tuesday.
JUL 14 6:21 PM
That sucks! =(
JUL 14 6:21 PM
She feeling any better with the bed?
JUL 14 6:21 PM
Makes sense to call in.
JUL 14 6:22 PM
She was scheduled to take Samantha to Indiana Tuesday to visit her other grand parents. Which is now postponed and we have a $100 in 2 concert tickets for a local musical festival this coming weekend and we're suppose to take all week off work next week and camp for a 10day Vaca.
JUL 14 6:22 PM
*life throws monkey wrench!
JUL 14 6:23 PM
=(
JUL 14 6:23 PM
BTW, a 10 day childless Vaca! Hahah
JUL 14 6:23 PM
It's all good. She is exhausted from lack of sleep. The ability to raise her head and legs and remove the strain on back in a $5k memory foam mattress is a plus
JUL 14 6:24 PM
She is doing better. Thankfully my grandparents are in their 80s and I was immediately like OK where are the good meds. Break them out. Wife is broke. So we got a small handful of good painkillers.
JUL 14 6:25 PM
Funny though, cause you know if you that old you got everything mecicine wise.
JUL 14 6:26 PM
Medicine
JUL 14 6:26 PM
It eased the pain enough to get her back home and we plan to call physical therapy tomorrow. She has already had one back sugery. The last MRI was if it goes out again it's a fusion
JUL 14 6:27 PM
Yikes.
JUL 14 6:28 PM
It's raining and pouring.
JUL 14 6:28 PM
She can still walk, so the nerve is not completely smashed. Hopefully we can get the disk to pop back in.
JUL 14 6:28 PM
On a lighter note. My younger cousin. By 3 years. Got married and this weekend was his reception/celebration.
JUL 14 6:29 PM
Unfortunately Kathy was stuck at Nana's and couldn't visit. =/.
JUL 14 6:29 PM
Kid had a great time at camp. I told her if she felt called or compelled to "be saved" then do it. But if you don't feel it don't do it. She didn't feel it, so she didn't do it.
JUL 14 6:30 PM
I like that she didn't blindly follow her friends and other campers.
JUL 14 6:31 PM
And tomorrow I interview for a dream job.
JUL 14 6:31 PM
So all is not lost!
JUL 14 6:31 PM
True.
JUL 14 6:31 PM
Jampacked.
JUL 14 6:31 PM
Win some lose some.
JUL 14 6:31 PM
I'm glad she had a good time at camp.

Shaving cream fight. There is a lake with a big dock you get to jump off. Lots of fun.
JUL 14 6:33 PM
They had big slip and slide, and all the ball games ypu could play.
JUL 14 6:33 PM
I wanna go again! Lol
JUL 14 6:33 PM
=)
JUL 14 6:34 PM
Well that's me and mine right now. How are you and yours?
JUL 14 6:34 PM
Doing fine. Had our family time remotely again. Went smoothly.
JUL 14 6:37 PM
Nice. Are they with your uncle or your brother?
JUL 14 6:38 PM
Their uncle
JUL 14 6:38 PM
Very little contact with them. Mostly testing what it is like through their wikis from afar.
JUL 14 6:38 PM
My brother.
JUL 14 6:38 PM
A good experience for him too.
JUL 14 6:39 PM
My week was productive and unstressed.
JUL 14 6:39 PM
That is good. I met your brother a few time. He was a good guy.
JUL 14 6:40 PM
Not nearly an ass like you.
JUL 14 6:40 PM
=)
JUL 14 6:40 PM
It is true
JUL 14 6:40 PM
Lol. I kid. I honestly have no idea. I just remember you spoke very highly of him.
