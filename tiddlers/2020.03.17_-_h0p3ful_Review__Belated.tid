** Here be low-hanging fruit, darling. Show us what you got. Do it your way, if you prefer.

** I admire your willingness to do it both ways and delete this rubbish that your asshole of a father requires of you at the earliest opportunity. <3.

** If you prefer, we can avoid reading aloud. I think it's good practice. Most youth have way more practice reading aloud in front of their classes. It's an immediate virtue signal (which is not the claim this is fair or used wisely). You will often be on a stage or forced to stand in the pocket trading blows or tokens in life, and habituating rhetorical skills (even the microexpressions embedded in reading to others counts) will allow you to focus on content rather than translating how it should sound.
*** I would like you to read your papers to us. You can read on your own though. I'm strongly recommending you start racing now. You understand the structure of what our teacher requires. Do not let the boys hold you back. Race like the wind against everything.

** I think it's okay that our memory palaces are incredibly messy. We also have context, the opportunity to clean it up, to retell it from various angles, and I think you are increasingly better at having organized it decently the first-time. I think getting it right the first time with consistency requires having practiced knowing what you want and don't want.
** Nested parentheses are considered poor form (though they may be necessary in some cases [sparingly, I assume]). For my formal writing, my drafts may have lots of them that I have to disentangle. I hope you and your brother both learn how to organize your writing in a more natural-sounding way the first time like your mother's.

** Indeed, this is one of your greatest talents. Add executive functioning, and you're cookin' up a storm.

** Have you been doing your [[Fitness Routine]] in the morning?
** Kinda hard to talk to people outside at the moment, but I get where you are coming from.
*** Yeah, talking over the phone makes good sense too.
*** I also think you should begin looking for groups/activities which interest you. It's a great way to make friends who share your interests. 
**** Bonus ~~Asian~~ Cracker Tiger Round: Pick at least one activity which will also perform well on applications to universities. Two birds, one stone.
