title: 2017.05.03 - Pipefitting Log

Today was a long day, but productive. I took out my 1.5" simulation drawing, which clearly didn't have correct initial measurements (hence the drawing was wrong). If you recall, we had to unmount and fix it twice on screwpipe. Luke and I measured it by hand as best we could (center-to-center measurements, unfortunately, can't be made with precision). I edited the drawing, including the valve that wasn't there before (if you recall, the teacher had us stovepipe it in there later). I did the math, and then I went over it with Luke. 

Luke did the cutting, and I did most of the rest. Luke's cuts, for once, were on point. That made me happy. We both did the tip-grind work. We worked hard because Luke was leaving early at 11:00. I had to remind Mel that I would need his help. Technically, he is in my group, but he obviously doesn't want to be. He always wanders over to Nash to sit there. Lol. Good for him. Less competition in the market for me.

Luke and I completed an arm before he had to leave. I wish I could have worked with Luke the entire time. The work we did was good.

After lunch, I gave Chris a bit of help since Nash was absent (as usual, Mel as well). Chris rejoiced+complained that he actually generally works faster without Nash and Mel (but our teacher doesn't like letting us work alone; in fact, I was forced to stop working on my project because Mel wasn't there). That may sound odd, but it's true. They make things worse, not better. Case in point, Nash and Mel made a huge mistake on the one thing they did on Chris' project which required them to take it apart (used the wrong pipes). Anyways, Mel eventually came back, and so we went back to my/our project. 

Mel is a terrible fitter. He barely understands what we are doing sometimes. He doesn't understand the order of what we doing. He often can't mentally rotate the objects or understand the isometric drawing very well. He also just "wings it" on things we shouldn't (although, I wing it when I have to). Working with him is not a pleasure. Nothing looks right with him, and when it comes to fitting, he never has it fucking level. I'm a fast tacker too (unlike his lethargic, unskilled ass), so there is no excuse. We had to recut the tacks several times to make up for his mistakes, and a couple we just let go.

I must say, I find it difficult to use socket weld fittings which are so chewed up. We have very little to level off of, and we can't use the weld-area sides at all (which really sucks). This will be much easier, I believe, in the field with new parts. 

We were interrupted to help Chris and Nash mount their simulation piece. It fit quite well (1" pipe was the easiest). Chris and Nash then came to help us finish our project. We just needed to put the last pipe on and the flanges.

We had a hard time with the last flange. There wasn't a good way to put it on. The teacher pointed out that we should have looked ahead to see it. Basically, there was no way to rotate the fabrication in the vise so as to be able to two-hole the flange. I should have done it in advance. 

What we did was take the entire fabrication off the table, and let it rest on a flange and stacked steel plates underneath the other side to make it level. Then we made the vertical plumb and lucky to strap it to the vise (1" off the vise, but good enough). Then we could two-hole.

Also, I learned a neat trick from my teacher today. He showed us how to use the square against the flange face and measure from the side of the pipe. As long as it has the same distance from the square to the pipe all the way down, you know the flange is perpendicular (hold the square flush against the flange, obviously). 

It fit well, if not tightly (we thought it might do this since Nash had fitted a flange a bit too far out, and because I had aimed for slightly larger heat expansion gaps to compensate for how I was fitting yesterday). We got it all mounted, and then the teacher came by. It was obvious that it wasn't perfectly level. It was level enough to mount it just fine, but still not great. We want it to look good! So, we busted out the measuring tapes and checked each pipe to see how much we'd need to take out and where. 

We measured from the top of simulator down to each end of the horizontal pipes (parallel to the top of the simulator). We found the difference to be 7/8" and we found a single pipe to take it out of. This was frustrating. The 1.5" has been flawed in both screwpipe and socket weld.

The teacher said it's not a problem as long as we fix it. It happens on the job often enough. I felt better about it. 

We took it apart, Chris and I, and I cut the pipe. To add to the frustration, the cutting disk snapped on me mid grind! That shit can fuck you up. I was lucky it didn't hit me. I grabbed another disk and made the cut. I found that I could just take the tacks off one side, then use the bandsaw to cut the 7/8" off it. 

Mel eventually decided to help me tack it back on. We did wing it here, but it was late and I simply couldn't find another way to do it. We had to do the same ghetto steel plate trick to raise it. I then winged it on the rotation and used two levels at once to try and have it plumb 360 degrees around. Mel doesn't put enough tack material for this. So, I did it. Afterward, Mel left to use his phone. 

Nash, Chris, and I brought it over to mount it. Chris and I did the actual bolt work while Nash went to play on his phone. Thank goodness Chris is there. Without him, I don't think it would have been finished by the end of the day. I apologize to him for my mistake (ultimately, I take myself to be responsible for what happens to this fabrication, even if I didn't directly make the mistake in the fitting) causing him to have to work extra instead of being able to screw around like the rest. He said it was nothing. 

I'm okay with having to redo it though. I've completed about 2 projects in the time that the other group took to do 1, and I had the more difficult pipe and drawings to work with.

As to my fitting, I think I overcompensated for the 1/8th inch for heat expansion. I know we weren't doing enough yesterday, and I think I went a hair over too many times. It adds up. This showed in the tight horizontal fitting. It also may be part of the reason it was 7/8" off (although, it could only be part of that problem). 

* I am pleased that steel is so flexible. The pipefitter alignment-pry bar (or whatever the tool is called) is just amazing. I desperately need one.
* I need to finish my envelopes for AB&T. 
* I need to talk to the electrician teacher again.

Also, we finally have all the parts for the second simulator. I'm hoping we get to start making that. It will be weird that we would do that as our first buttweld project though since it is permanent and we can't replace the parts. It's super important that we do a good job on it, and I don't think our first time doing buttwelds is the appropriate time to do it. We'll see what the teacher thinks.

Note, the teacher didn't assign any 3" simulator project. I take it we won't be doing one.
