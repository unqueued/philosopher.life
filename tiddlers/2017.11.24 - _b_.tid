It is clear that sex is about power. Ass and tits are wealth displays. Fucking that evolutionary money. Domination is common in sex, and submission another form of empowerment as well. We tell ourselves power stories in addition to the ones embedded in us through evolution. The mating game itself, shaping behavior through withholding sex, partner selection, etc. are all displays of power. Here is my problem with Feminism: it fails to appreciate how women play these games of power every bit as much as men. It is NOT one-sided; every member of the human species vies for power. I think feminists are fundamentally blind hypocrites. They will falsely cede ground here, but I think they are not redpilled nearly enough. Humans use each other. I've yet to see a reason to think women are magically less motivated to use men as mere means than men are of women (or whatever gender and sex case may be).

Again, even like Racism, what is fundamental cannot merely be the institutional considerations. While consequences are incredibly important, racism is fundamentally about one's maxim, in particular, one's motivation is a necessary consideration. The same with sex.

We are very good at telling ourselves stories since that is what consciousness is. I think people are exceptionally good at deluding themselves into thinking they are good people. They may be unified, but that doesn't make them not unified evil.

People try to escape Westworld. Some literally try to get off the grounds. Some find themselves. Some find The Other. Some play the game deeply, knowing they can't escape the black hole take the opposite tactic and plunge so deep into the game they hope to find the secret keys and answers that let them out on the other side. Some are tied to it, even knowing it isn't objective truth, still must find their subjective desires and beliefs entangled in it, caught in the purgatory of oscillating between accepting and rejecting the moral medium of Westworld itself. These are all redpills, they are all stories we tell ourselves about the world around us and who we are.

Experience machines are fabulous mechanisms for metanarratives, for seeing stories embedded in and emerge from other stories.
