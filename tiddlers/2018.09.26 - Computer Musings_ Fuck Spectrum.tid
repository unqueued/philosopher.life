title: 2018.09.26 - Computer Musings: Fuck Spectrum

This is getting ridiculous. Our interwebs connection is dropping multiple times a day. It's beginning to affect my children's ability to complete their schoolwork. This is not acceptable. 

They claimed to have brought us //up to// 100mbps....but it's actually dropped to 30-35 on top of outages. I know they don't like how aggressively I use my connection. I've been throttled many times in my life. I'm a barrel of redflags to their DPI and trafficshaping.

Talking to their techies is often disheartening (what happened to the techies that one could shibboleet with? They are a dying breed). Had one as a neighbor when we first moved here too. They have no fucking clue what their company policies are, what's actually happening on their network, etc. They "mindlessly" look away. Absolute garbage. I can even walk them through demonstrations of the throttling and disruption, and it doesn't matter. Reproducing the behavior just doesn't matter to them. Deny, Deny, Deny!

The amount of fucking ipv6 rollBACK and NATing makes me sick. There's a non-zero chance that NAT traversal might actually get harder (it's impossible for a small percentage) for some segment of the population by design. I already have to fight firewalls on other networks, and now my ISPs may be conveniently shaping me into a consumer they can pin into a narrow tunnel that they squeeze and toll. I'm already forced to relay and holepunch my way out of this bullshit, and I think that may be a permanent problem for me. Will I always be forced to rely upon proxies, even if I'm the one rolling it out? We shouldn't have a Matrix server model; even that metadata should be [[T42T]] held by other peers on your behalf. This is only getting worse for my area. Am I going to have to rely upon steganographically masking my traffic over 443 to ipv4's of untrusted VPSs hosted on Google and Amazon's infrastructure just to even have a chance of using my own software on the "open" internet? Will I be gated out? The Western Great Firewall is already here, and the squeeze is happening on a number of political and technical fronts. Power continues to centralize, at least for Spectrum in my region. They have no real competition here. Where are my ivp6 gods?
