title: 2018.10.19 - Prompted Introspection: Life Soundtrack

!! If you could build a soundtrack to your life, who would be on it?

I think you literally want to know which artists represent me. None well enough, imho. This is a dumb question, Samwise. I'm going for songs for the soundtrack instead of artists, and even that is stupid. So,  [[Music: Library]] or John Cage's 4'33". Boom!
