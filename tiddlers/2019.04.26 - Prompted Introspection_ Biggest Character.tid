title: 2019.04.26 - Prompted Introspection: Biggest Character

!! Who in your family is the biggest character?

I feel like we are all big and quirky personalities. We have intense interactions with each other and a wide range of reactions from people in general. Our dispositions are opinionated and vivid. We aren't neurotypical, and we have some unconventionality in our way of life. I don't think we fit standard demographics in many cases.

I'm not in a position to define who in general has the biggest character, but I think there are contexts in which some people have the biggest character. As always, it depends.

This becomes a harder question to answer for me as I understand the nature of character. Some of the quietest, controlled, or shyest appearing people are so contained that I find their worlds and interactions deafening and out of control.
