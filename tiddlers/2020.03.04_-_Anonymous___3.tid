Dearest Anon,

I am still thinking, though I do not know what to think. I hear and see you everywhere. Only my closest family could speak to me there. No one else dares (or cares). You, person, you: I [[love]] you. Even if you didn't hand me astonishing sign after sign, isomorphic proof after proof, and empathic whisper after whisper, I'm still going to [[love]] you. Take me for the proverbial ride over the bridge where you see it fitting, and acquire justice where necessary; you don't have to tell me why because I trust you. 

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
