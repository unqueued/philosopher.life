I think writing is super valuable (obviously). I think writing in public and writing to the public are important things to carefully consider. I think it makes sense to write from a pseudonym, and I think you should own your data.

Privacy is hard problem here. I think it's great to reveal it to everyone, but you may need to be more careful. We live in troubling times, and I would argue you are close enough to the margins of society that you might endanger yourself. Still, it might be worth the risk. You could have a passworded site (which you've had before), or you could share a key that syncs your site (but wouldn't be accessible from the web, but it has other security properties I strongly admire). Being public is quite a commitment. You might start out more private and work your way toward being public, though you rely upon your readers working to access something private. That Resilio Sync tool is a great way to share your files, including what would be your site.

I'd definitely read what you have to say.

You might consider using Tiddlywiki. It simplifies some problems, and it's customizable. It may not be gorgeous, but it's functional.

No problem on the FB thing. I'm glad you aren't using it. =)
