title: 2018.11.08 - Prompted Introspection: Seasons, Again.

!! What is your favorite season? What is your best memory of something that happened in that season?

I'm so tired of this question, Samwise:

* [[2018.01.27 - Prompted Introspection Log: Fav Season]]
* [[2018.09.21 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Season]]
* [[2018.10.03 - Prompted Introspection: Best Season]]

I'm more interested in seasons of life, but I think those seasons deal with more important aspects of my context than the weather given how the Earth is positioned against the sun.

Alright, `/cointoss`: Spring is my favorite season this moment. Best memory is the beginning of my marriage! 

This is nostalgia. I think it is a dangerous drug to dwell upon without any objectivity. I think it will be interesting to try to have nostalgia regarding any portion of my life with the wiki. Obviously, I have very mixed feelings looking back at my [[Hypercynic]] days (just as an example of a time long ago that I actually have some writing from). I am lucky to have my family.
