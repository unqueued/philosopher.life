Sounds like it will be a good time. How many people will you be going with?

Morning, [[h0p3]]! Um... I’m not sure how many people decided to be a part of it. 6 or so?

Cool. =)

Blahs, gahs, and not enough ahhas.

It seems like [[K]] and I both slept so well over the weekend, then Sunday evening rolls around and we’re tossing and turning. Yeesh.

hehe, exactly

There's gotta be a name for that phenomenon. The anxiety of trying to fall asleep when you starting the work week up again.
MAY 6 9:59 AM
I miss sleeping like a kid so much.

Don't forget that not sleeping is bad for you as you try to fall asleep, thinking about it will lower your anxiety, help you bust out of the thought-loop, and enable you to fall asleep faster, lol.

Sorry, had a long string of meetings. I assume that last bit was sarcasm because the more I think about how much I need to sleep the more anxious I get lol
MAY 6 1:51 PM
Oh, more absurd than sarcasm, I hope.
MAY 6 1:52 PM
Trying to be ironic while being empathic. I know the pain of not being able to sleep quite well.
MAY 6 1:52 PM
That works hehe. Honestly I find that if I just take my sleep patterns as they come instead of freaking out they tend to even out.
