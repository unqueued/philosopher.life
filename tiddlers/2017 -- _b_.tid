!! Audits:

* I'm not sure when or why I started it exactly. It kind of blossomed. I saw what it was and embraced it.
* Redpilled, honest, and brutal.
* Plenty of wrestling and veil piercing to be found.
* Interestingly, I feel less moved by my older work on average than I expected. There are gems, of course. 
* I feel like I need to preserve some of this work, particularly my redpilled socialist work.
* Inserting/reformulating them into [[Redpilled Socialist Quips]]
* I have surprisingly little to say, but I'm thoroughly glad I said what I did.
