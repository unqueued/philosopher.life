title: 2020.01.23 - Wiki Audit: Antipleonasm Analysis

* Removing [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] from [[CDR]]. I have other things I need to {[[Focus]]} on, particularly in [[Recent Obsessions]]. 
** I need to lower the cognitive load for now. No reason to have a backlog at this point, and it won't kill me to wait. [[Hope]]fully, I'll come back to it in good time (and, if I don't, it was an excellent project).
* I've a host of yearly audits to complete. I'm still only doing the logs at this point.
* I'd like to get back to [[The Remodeling]], and perhaps that requires setting up the [[Yearly]] timeline correctly.
** That might be a ways off. I still have a fuckton to do offline and [[FTO]]-wise.
* I finally decided to just de-dup [[Generic Prompts]]. Eh, it fucked up the order. 
** I need to get to narrowing it down anyway. I'm excited by that.
