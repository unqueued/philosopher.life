title: 2018.08.01 -- Wiki Audit: Monthly Audits Are HERE!

Let's knock it out of the park today. [[Computing]] never got reorganized.

I also want to finish {[[Help]]} and work on [[Be a Good Dad]] today.

* [[2018.07 -- To-Do-List Log]]
** Omg, we did a lot, and I tell can a lot of it would not have happened without at least some planning. I'm proud of my TDL.
* [[2018.07 -- Carpe Diem Log]]
** I'm not sure why I have so very little to say. That's okay.
* [[2018.07 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** As usual, this was a wild ride. I've covered a ton of ground this month.
* [[2018.07 -- /b/]]
** With the habit of just firing new tiddlers up without having to name them, I've made serious reductions in [[/b/]]. That's a good thing.
* [[2018.07 -- Wiki Audit]]
** It's what I'm doing right now. =)

I've noticed that I'm fleshing out the deets of the [[Axioms of h0p3]]. I think this is fantastic. Interestingly, these principles are being applied real time as I develop them, and it's not just in {[[About]]}. I've been redoing a lot of {[[Root]]} lately.
