title: 2018.08.31 -- Deep Reading: LOTR:FOTR

I want to smash through this with my children as well. We'll go through these books together. I need to make sure they are writing about it. Kids are in for a real treat too. Phil Dragash has an absolutely sick audiobook here. I'm blown away it. 

As a fat man, I adore elevensies and filling up the corners.

The spiritual dimension is very loud.
