title: 2020.04.19 - Family Log: Eh.

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week given the wikis:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** It was a bunch of ups and downs, I had deep and light works. I can imagine it like a fort with two trenches at the sides. I'm surprised I did so well in Dialectical school. I'm also surprised that I had an okay week because I expected a much worse response. I didn't get my Carpe Diem work done.
** j3d1h
*** Your notes on the upgrades weren't perfect, but you got down the parts that fill in the blanks. Bob and TW both have their own pages with upgrade commands, but you wrote down why you have to do it in the order I did. Also, your logs are getting wittier for some, and deeper for others. Your sentences have much better structure, and it's looking great. I think you do need to hold off on saying your work is bad, and instead try to see why it was good work - it often is (IMO)!
** k0sh3k
*** I really did like your chapter 6 rough draft - you're getting much better at writing! I appreciate that you're both critically analyzing the questions in your prompted introspections and answering them in the spirit intended - both are good skills to have. I noticed that the middle of the week seems to be more productive for you; why do you think that is? I love you, little man, and I hope you remember that even at your lowest points. You're getting better little by little; we'll get there together, ok?
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] marches toward finding his routine for the fall semester. The beginning and end of [[1uxb0x]]'s week, in terms of schoolwork, were rough. There were some highlights though. He wrestled with some deep philosophical and emotional concerns. He tackled some practical CS problems, and took notes while shadowing his sister. In particular, he worked on add-ons, our Bob tooling, upgrading TW, and understanding the basic idea of Git. He was instrumental in planning and preparing the garden. He was generous to his sister, doing the kitchen on her behalf. It's been a joy to play //Dominion// with him (I was telling [[JRE]] about his bluffing antics). It's shocking to see how far he has progressed since last year.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I find that your wiki, like mine, had ups and downs. I think you had a very good week compared to your average week. I'm suprised with your writing style for The Lightning Thief. I find that you have good responses to dads h0p3ful reviews. I also find that your Carpe Diems and TDLs are pretty good.
** j3d1h
*** Bob has not been very nice to any of us. My logs get eaten, the update simply doesn't save files, and it never really worked for k0sh3k. Maybe we have a few bugs to report. I am pretty happy with my writing, but I don't like how slow I am when I write. I should get more into VIXI as well.
** k0sh3k
*** I'm really glad to see you getting stuff down again! You've got a good voice, and I like seeing you use it. You're very thoughtful and critical while being gracious, such as when you discuss the good and bad sides of your friends. You need to find out what's going wrong with your wiki and fix it - there shouldn't be empty duplicates and multiple versions. I think you can work your way up to being ready for Fall semester, but you need to be more self-disciplined to get there. We'll work on it!
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]]'s talents are sometimes disgusting, and (when she chose to engage in it) her writing this week has been insightful, well-organized, process disciplined, rhetorically piercing, and antipleonasmic. I'm hoping to see her engage the arguments in [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] at a higher rate and depth. She's been working on her posture, and she had more physical labor than usual this week in preparing the terraces, picking up garbage, and getting her hands dirty in the dirt. She's dabbled in a variety of CS practices (I am glad that I do not need to intervene so much), and slowly (very slowly) she is proving to me that her laptop's hardware is in need of replacement. I feel like my daughter is still learning to narrow the 10,000 things of life into a prioritized stack. Telling the truth has been expensive this week.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I think Bookwyrm, my mum, has been trying to be kind with others, including your family around you. I'm happy that you answer both bad and good questions. Thank you for keeping our work scheduals in your wiki. I didn't know why you hated the giving tree so much; now I do. I find that your RCL for this week was shorter than normal.
** j3d1h
*** Your narrative-style life logs are very nice! The rest of us try to describe everything in terms of the exact tasks and events, but you have more about how you felt. Your prompted introspections are also a different style, though I'm not sure exactly //what// makes them different. RCLs and home services are, as always, wonderful. You're getting a lot more headaches and health problems recently..
** k0sh3k
*** I did a good job connecting with people I haven't talked to in a long while this week. I liked my RCL this week, although it was a short one. I think I did a good job this week balancing my work with my life; I managed to keep busy and get some things done, but I recognize when I was getting too stressed and took more breaks. I liked my classes this week, and I'm going to keep looking for classes/webinars that interest me without raising my stress levels. I am glad the days of my hips needing to bear children are over. 
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has been thoughtfully dealing with her anxiety (I believe she has a growing tolerance to her current meds); I am so glad that we can stop, acknowledge her anxiety, be safe with each other, and keep working on the causes. I'm grateful that she empathizes with me, especially because my anxiety is anxiety-inducing for her. She's also generous with her time and spoons in speaking with people coming out of the isolated quarantined woodwork who otherwise don't seem to give her the time of day; she is a mother to all, even the undeserving. She's been working toward adjusting her sleep schedule, building processes and routines for the fall with our offspring while she is here at the house, looking ahead (which has been scary in some respects), and working with me to build our meager safety measures. We've had fun this week too, and I am, as always, lucky to walk with and fuck her. I can see she's been giving the science of well-being a lot of thought.

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I'm happy that you care enough to make a ark and garden for our survival. I think I'd like to let my money be available to you for emergancy needs. I think you should add numbers into your prompted introspections so that you can pull one or so numbers out your ass to hand them to somebody. Another reason I think you should have numbers is so that you don't need to highlight the sentance, hit ctrl and c, then click on the search bar, and hit ctrl and v. Instead you need to click on the search bad and hit the numbers in. I think h0p3ful review should have a short check to make sure the person actually did their work for the day, just opening one or two tiddlers would work.
** j3d1h
*** The ark is going very well, and the garden was a great idea, too. We should probably set up a nice path up to those ledges. Reading through your chat logs (and chatting with friends myself), it's odd how little Covid-19 is affecting us. You and k0sh3k don't have the same dates, k0sh3k works from home. Otherwise, nothing is all that different. Your prompted introspections don't seem to be working the same for you since you started working back through the list.
** k0sh3k
*** I like your old fool macaroni art (Kintsukuroi); you did a good job. I like that you put a lot of work into learning new skills, just for the knowledge of it. I love that you are looking out for those around us who can't prepare for what's coming, even while preparing here. I like that you put so much time and thought into how you communicate with others, whereas I feel like I just shotgun it, often. 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] has been struggling to complete everything he needs to get done. He's made significant progress in building safety for himself and [[others]]. He needs to be more careful in his drinking; he fell asleep on Friday before he should have. He's been working to find a groove for everyone, and he's having to make uncomfortable guesses about the state of affairs. The garden, the arks, computing infrastructures, cleaning, playtime, [[vidyas]], [[h0p3ful Review]], and presentations have been generally successful. His bussy has been stretched trying to connect with people and figure out what is needed. He's not been doing a good enough job on his wiki though. Overall, it was a productive week with buzzes of activity.

!! What is one valuable thing, thought, or contribution we ought to give or say about each person's [[TTP]] (including our own)?

* 1uxb0x
** Make sure you change the times in your Morning Routine to match the new routine.
** Anything that isn't important should come out.
** Make sure you put the due dates for this week in your calendar.
** Your morning routine should be in your daily template.
** Going outside.
** Before bed template.
** Change the order on .tmpl so that More is the last one.
** Maybe Philosophical Analysis should be in More?
** Look at h0p3's More so you can see how it's supposed to be used - for things that aren't priorities but are still being done.
** Use tagging to generate the structure, rather than having to add by hand - it's easier to edit that way. (Check Discord for the code.)
** Your .tmpls are very detailed.
* j3d1h
** I'm probably going to combine morning daily and before noon
** Put your homework dates in your calanders
** Change your wake-up dates
** Yet again, you need to work on your plan
** I don't see a template for the morning, I don't see it in more. I don't see it called in daily, and I don't see a before bed.tmpl and I don't see a hair routine
** I need a school day template I can see that makes sense
** Your monthly and yearly templates should be in more
** Should we be able to put stuff into your tdls? I think that since you'd be looking at them we should be able to change them.  
* k0sh3k
** Make sure you all set your alarmclocks up.
** I'm thankful mom is keeping our work schedules in her wiki.
** The way she does templates with a different kind of scope is something we need to look at.
** You do tdls very differently.
* h0p3
** My TDLS are still shambles
** Why do you have an empty .tdls (and .plans) more section?
** You may want to make sure you keep everything in PA if were going to go over it.
