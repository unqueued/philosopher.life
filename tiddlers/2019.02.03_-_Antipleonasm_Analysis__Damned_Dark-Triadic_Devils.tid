Rand has mastered the rhetorical art of begging the question in the traditional weasel words, including "Rational." She will accuse me of the same. Anything which stands in opposition to making herself a god is definitionally irrational. This is the danger of relativism, internalism, and believing our model is the only normative one all the way down. However internally coherent her perspective, she is unified evil incarnate. Her individual house is not divided, but it divides our collective houses.

What does one say to the dark-triadic devil themselves? 

''I'm coming for you.''
