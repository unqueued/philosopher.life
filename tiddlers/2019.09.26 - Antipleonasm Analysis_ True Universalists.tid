title: 2019.09.26 - Antipleonasm Analysis: True Universalists

!! Respond to the following [[gem]]:

<<<
True universalists are not those who preach global tolerance of differences and all-encompassing unity, but those who engage in a passionate struggle for the assertion of the Truth which compels them.

''PREACH, YO!'' 

With some qualifiers, I call those people //philosophers//. I'll take attempts at justified religious zealotry for $100, Alex. By this token, I'm mostly quixotic, retarded, and [[arrogant]]. 

Those who seek unprincipled peace likely reject justified ideological struggle. While I profoundly admire henotic reasoning as a Platonist, denying the necessity of violence in the material dialectic is privileged decadence; they are traitors to actually pursuing what is universally valuable. Moral relativism and absurd pluralism is a sleight of hand from capitalists and reactionaries. Go forth and kick their asses.
