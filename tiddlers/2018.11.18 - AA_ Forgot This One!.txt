How’s your weekend going?
NOV 18, 2018 2:46 PM
It goes. Had the worst migraine/headache I've ever had yesterday, but it turned out to be a good day still.
NOV 18, 2018 3:09 PM
Today's family day. Just got back from our walk. Now we spend an hour in our wikis, then we will read each other's wiki work for the week and talk. We'll finish off the with log, then have our roast.
NOV 18, 2018 3:10 PM
Oh no —is your head better?
NOV 18, 2018 3:10 PM
We enjoyed the day with [[L]] and [[K]] yesterday. It was great to see [[JRE]] too!
NOV 18, 2018 3:12 PM
Yeah, my head is better. It start subsiding last night. I think sleep helped a ton.
NOV 18, 2018 3:12 PM
Sometimes that’s the only thing that helps
NOV 18, 2018 3:12 PM
True dat.
NOV 18, 2018 3:13 PM
It sounds like you had a good time. [[JRE]] said the roast was very good.
NOV 18, 2018 3:13 PM
I am glad they enjoyed it! :blush:
NOV 18, 2018 3:13 PM
Need to head out soon to get all the stuff for Tday...
NOV 18, 2018 3:13 PM
I bet it's extra busy with the power outage too.
NOV 18, 2018 3:14 PM
Everyone get their power back?
NOV 18, 2018 3:14 PM
Yeah I think most did
NOV 18, 2018 3:14 PM
I have a few on fb that still say they are out
NOV 18, 2018 3:14 PM
I dread the packed store.... but it’s only gonna get worse

I lost the recipe for your cookies (I don't know where it is). I'm sorry. Can you send me the lemon cookie recipe again?
NOV 18, 2018 3:18 PM
Yep
NOV 18, 2018 3:18 PM
I bet you a shopping for the moder lode for the literal feast you are creating this week.
NOV 18, 2018 3:20 PM
Yep at least I have the meat
NOV 18, 2018 3:20 PM
Two 20ish lb turkeys and two hams
NOV 18, 2018 3:21 PM
This recipe works for any cake mix. For the lemon cookies, I zest 1/2 a lemon into each cake mix and squeeze in the juice (not so much that the cake mix is too wet)

You can use margarine instead of butter for [[k0sh3k]]
NOV 18, 2018 3:24 PM
They are super easy
NOV 18, 2018 3:25 PM
Can't even use margarine, sadly (somehow still has milk product in it). But, the fake butter seems to substitute well.
NOV 18, 2018 3:25 PM
Awesome.
NOV 18, 2018 3:25 PM
That should work great then
