how goes it, homie?
Fri 7:05 PM
 Hey man.  It is going well.  Just got home from work.  How about you?
Fri 7:22 PM
 It goes well. School with the chillun, walked with wife, read and write
Fri 7:24 PM
 applied for a fact checker position with WikiTribune
Fri 7:24 PM
 would be neat to land that
Fri 7:24 PM
 what you up to this weekend?
Fri 7:24 PM
 Cool beans.  I might get started on putting my computer together tonight.
Fri 7:24 PM
 Pics!
Fri 7:25 PM
 Right now I'm trying to figure out where the wifey is.
Fri 7:25 PM
 Pics will come once I get started.  Fo sho!
Fri 7:25 PM
 I am very excited!
Fri 7:26 PM
 I am too I've been sitting on the part since Wednesday and haven't had time to get started yet.
Fri 7:26 PM
 
Fri 8:09 PM
 It's alive!  But won't install Manjaro lolz
Fri 10:27 PM
 Yay!
Fri 10:45 PM
 What's manjaro doin?
Fri 10:45 PM
 The usb media has old kernel and wont boot on my system
Fri 10:46 PM
 lol
Fri 10:46 PM
 I've never had that happen before
Fri 10:47 PM
 Yeah, it sux the install hangs
Fri 10:47 PM
 I'm sorry =/
Fri 10:47 PM
 huh
Fri 10:47 PM
 Currently trying to think of other options that would be available
Fri 10:47 PM
 wait, you can get into live manjaro?
Fri 10:47 PM
 I can get to the grub splash, when it hands I can get into a CLI
Fri 10:48 PM
 hangs
Fri 10:48 PM
 =/
Fri 10:48 PM
 I wish I knew what to do about that.
Fri 10:49 PM
 I have no idea
Fri 10:49 PM
 I can think of some very ugly hacks, like installing debian and then doing an arch install in-place (seen some neat VPS hacks like that too).
Fri 10:50 PM
 you might just go straight for arch too
Fri 10:50 PM
 Antergos makes it simple
Fri 10:50 PM
 My Google search seems to show that if I use Manjaro architect I can choose the needed kernel on that during install.
Fri 10:52 PM
 aye
Fri 10:52 PM
 that's worth trying
Fri 10:52 PM
 Do you think I could do it?
Fri 10:52 PM
 yes
Fri 10:52 PM
 I think you don't have enough confidence in yourself.
Fri 10:53 PM
 have a computer running next to it, google as go
Fri 10:53 PM
 as you go
Fri 10:53 PM
 You got an HDD, eh?
Fri 10:53 PM
 It might take a couple tries to get it the way you want
Fri 10:54 PM
 Yes and I also got an nvme Drive
Fri 10:54 PM
 I did go for the 16GB of memory though
Fri 10:55 PM
 you won't regret it
Fri 10:55 PM
 why nvme?
Fri 10:55 PM
 S**** and giggles mostly
Fri 10:56 PM
 lol
Fri 10:56 PM
 Have you looked into Type 1 Hypervisor?
Fri 11:00 PM
 Also, now that you have a sick machine, you sticking with XFCE?
Fri 11:00 PM
 never heard of it
Fri 11:00 PM
 it's like a baremetal VM host, very thin
Fri 11:01 PM
 I really hate KDE.  I like xfce and cinnimon
Fri 11:01 PM
 You could also go for a hackintosh
Fri 11:02 PM
 I have looked into elementary, which is based on looking like mac, and I dont like it either
Fri 11:02 PM
 I've tried elementary many times...not a fan
Fri 11:03 PM
 I didn't like my hackintosh either though
Fri 11:03 PM
 I am going to try Manjaro Architect and see how that turns out.  I am flashing it as we speak
Fri 11:05 PM
 noice
Fri 11:06 PM
 I have learned that cable management is a bitch and that I should have bought a modular power supply
Fri 11:07 PM
 It does look way nicer, and if you are constantly in  your machine, it makes sense.
Fri 11:08 PM
 I don't care for my machines anymore.
Fri 11:09 PM
 ...
Fri 11:09 PM
 I don't open them up.
Fri 11:09 PM
 Ah
Fri 11:09 PM
 I've opened m10 once...that was to replace the RAM.
Fri 11:09 PM
 My struggle is almost always software. Trying to find the exact environment I love.
Fri 11:10 PM
 The part I was most worried about was putting the motherboard standoffs in and then screwing the mobo down.  Never done that before
Fri 11:11 PM
 aye, especially since you can short the board if you screw that up
Fri 11:11 PM
 ok the flashing is done and now it is time to try it
Fri 11:11 PM
 When you have the curiosity/freetime you will need to try a tiling manager again (openbox was also nice). It has changed my life.
Fri 11:12 PM
 I know you don't think of yourself as a multi-tasker. I suggest that with 16GB of memory, you will have the opportunity to change your mind.
Fri 11:13 PM
 how goes it?
Fri 11:54 PM
 No luck yet.  The architect is difficult
Fri 11:54 PM
 yeah, it makes you specify way too much, imho
Fri 11:54 PM
 but, I suppose that's the point of it...reminds me of Ubuntu Server edition
Fri 11:55 PM
 You mentioned antergos earlier what is that?
Fri 11:56 PM
 https://antergos.com/
Fri 11:57 PM
 EZ Arch
Fri 11:57 PM
 Ah
Fri 11:57 PM
 it's an arch installer
Fri 11:57 PM
 I still prefer Manjaro.
Fri 11:59 PM
 I feel like a beta tester with Arch. I know it has gotten better/less breakage.
Sat 12:00 AM
 Hell yes!  Manjaro running on the new machine after using the architect.  It took several attempts but it works!
Sat 7:47 PM
 yay! =)
Sat 8:06 PM
 Indeed
Sat 8:06 PM
 inxi -Fi
Sat 8:25 PM

Sat 8:25 PM

Sat 8:32 PM
 Hopefully this may be of use to you, filling out the corners: https://philosopher.life/#Linux%20Tool%20Collection:Root%20%5B%5BLinux%20Tool%20Collection%5D%5D
Sat 8:41 PM
 I will look into that
Sat 8:41 PM
 I am indeed setting the desktop up and getting programs installed
Sat 8:41 PM

Sat 8:43 PM
 not adding old SSD to this system?
Sat 8:46 PM
 I might at a later time.  The kids are gonna be using the old system and it is less work to work with it as it is now.
Sat 8:46 PM
 I think you should leave the SSD in for them instead.
Sat 10:26 PM
 Yeah
Sat 10:25 PM
 they'll try a computer with just an HDD some day and it will blow their minds
Sat 10:26 PM
 hahaha
