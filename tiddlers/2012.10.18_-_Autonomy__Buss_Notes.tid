title: 2012.10.18 - Autonomy: Buss Notes

Summary:

Buss is largely interested in avoiding the regress problem. She believes the regress occurs directly because we expect the agent to be active in deliberation, evaluation, and endorsement. Avoiding the regress, and establishing self-determination, requires dropping a model of the active agent in favor of a passive agent.

The kernel of her argument begins with a virtue-theoretic intuition that an agent is autonomous when his intentions are caused by (or are an expression of) his stable and constitutive character/personality. I believe, on this theory, one is accountable iff one is autonomous. There are two ways in which one is accountable: (1) an act reflects the agent’s character or personality, or (2) an act was caused by a psychology/physiological condition (normally thought of as external?) that is not at odds with the minimal flourishing of the agent. Conversely, to be non-autonomous requires that one formed an “intention under the decisive nonrational influence of conditions that are elements or symptoms of human malfunctioning,” by which I take malfunctioning to be the opposite of human flourishing (660). Only those extreme anti-flourishing conditions which override our rationality can cause us to (generally temporarily) lose our autonomy – and we lose our autonomy only because those conditions are so deeply incompatible with our being a good human specimen or good representative of humanity.

I think the idea is that even when we aren’t actively choosing, but only passively acting, we are still autonomous agents because it is a part of our flourishing.



Thoughts:

    I’m not sure if I understand how the human flourishing condition determines the boundaries of a person’s character and personality.

    Human flourishing seems to be a kind of precondition to agency/autonomy. It seems to me that she may need to separate flourishing as a human from flourishing as a person.

    It seems hard to not be autonomous agent, requiring fairly extreme conditions. I’m not exactly sure what I think about this asymmetry.

    While Buss just might defeat the regress problem, I don’t see how Buss defeats the mad scientist problem in pg. 688+.

648 – It is unclear what it means to accountable for something but not blameworthy.

654 – Why should we say that passive or non-autonomous agents aren’t agents at all? We can say they are agents, they just aren’t the authentic agents.

656 – “the distinguishing feature of autonomous agents is neither their special capacity for deliberation and self-reflection nor any particular attitude they take toward their actions”

656 – She denies that self-relation necessary for autonomy is a relation between a privileged self and another self – by this I assume an Order-based conception of autonomy. She wants to truly avoid any makings of the regress.



657 – The regress occurs directly because we expect the agent to be active in deliberation, evaluation, and endorsement. Avoiding the regress requires dropping the active agent in favor of a passive agent. Buss claims it is necessarily “self-determination in the passive mode.”

658 – “someone is an autonomous agent if her intention is the direct effect of—and is thus an expression of—her character or personality; if, that is, it reflects whatever relatively stable psychological traits are constitutive of the particular person she is.”

Is stability like coherence? No. One can be stably incoherent.

“Out of character”

Akrasia

659 – “someone is accountable for what she does if her intention to act this way either reflects her character or personality or was directly caused by a psychological and/or physiological condition that is not at odds with minimal human flourishing”

659 – how does the human flourishing condition determine the boundaries of a person’s character and personality?

660 – “a human being fails to act autonomously if and only if she forms her intention under the decisive nonrational influence of conditions that are elements or symptoms of human malfunctioning.”

660 – “To be a human agent is to be a representative member of a species. This means that there is an important respect in which even well-integrated, long-standing psychological and physiological conditions are external to a human agent’s identity insofar as they are causes or symptoms of human malfunctioning”

662 - There is an asymmetry. Very positive, flourishing kind of conditions enable us to still be us, but very negative and anti-flourishing conditions do not.



This reminds me of Korsgaard. Instead, I must ask, what is extremely defective action? What does it mean to choose extremely negative actions?

667 – “The key to autonomous action, I will argue, is the deep connection between who we truly are and who we are when we are not sick or in great pain or the victim of some other form of pathology or disability. On my account, when pain, fear, and the like qualify as the elements or symptoms of pathology—when they are extreme enough or exceptional in some other way that renders them at odds with minimal human flourishing—and when, furthermore, they exert a decisive nonrational influence on our intentions, then and only then, they prevent us from determining our actions in the way that we must if we are to be account-able for what we do.”

668 – Yes, it is difficult to accept that some traits are more human than others. In fact, the instinctual “overcome” with fear, etc. are the kinds of things which are most human of all. Isn’t instinctual human also truly human? Yes. Perhaps we need a distinction between human and person here, where it may be a trait of humans, but it is not a trait of persons, i.e. agents.

669 – “The point is simply that even under these circumstances, the conditions are afflic-tions—the sort of conditions whose long-term influence is typically crippling and, hence, the sort of conditions that are incompatible with a human being’s identity as a representative of her kind”

Flourishing as persons distinct from Flourishing as humans? To what extent? What does that mean?

671- Human Flourishing is a precondition to Agency.

I don’t see how Buss escapes the mad scientist problem in 688+

690 – “(1) if we play a special causal role in the inten-tional actions for which we can be held accountable, this cannot be because these autonomous actions involve a more complete expression of our agency, (2) our autonomous actions differ from our nonautono-mous actions because when we act autonomously we play a decisive causal role in our capacity as nonagents, (3) the relevant aspect of our identity as nonagents is our identity as representatives, or exemplars, of our species, and (4) this normative aspect of our identity consists of whichever psychological and physiological conditions are not at odds with functioning minimally well as a humanbeing.”
