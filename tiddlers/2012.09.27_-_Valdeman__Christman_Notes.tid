John Christman’s “Autonomy and Personal History”


A standard objection to views like Frankfurt’s and Dworkin’s is that, because they are ahistorical, they cannot account for the problem of manipulation.


Christman’s account, by contrast, is historical. On his view, a desire is autonomous only if it came about in the right sort of way – only if it had proper origins. On his view, a desire had proper origins if its bearer approved of the process by which it was acquired (or she would have approved had she attended to its acquisition).


Christman presents his view in opposition to Gerald Dworkin’s view, which is quite similar to Frankfurt’s in that it’s a version Frankfurt’s “hierarchy of desires” model.


Dworkin: “An autonomous person is one who does his own thing,” where “the attitude that [the] person takes towards the influences motivating him…determines whether or not they are to be considered ‘his.’”


To be autonomous, on Dworkin’s view, you have to identify with your desires via your second-order desires, and you must be procedurally independent, which requires that the relevant second-order desires not have been produced by manipulation, deception, the withholding of relevant information, and such.


Dworkin’s theory seems susceptible to the same objections leveled against Frankfurt: manipulation, regress, and the ab-initio problem/problem of authority. Perhaps he escapes the problem of manipulation but only via assertion.


Christman argues that Dworkin’s model confronts a trilemma. To generate it, we can ask: on Dworkin’s model, must the relevant second-order desires themselves be autonomous? If not, then we have the ab-initio problem. If so, then how do they become autonomous? If it’s in the same way as one’s first-order desires, then we face a regress. But if they become autonomous in some other way, then Dworkin’s theory is incomplete because he hasn’t specified the method.


So Dworkin’s theory, argues Christman, confronts either the ab-initio problem or the regress problem or it’s incomplete.


Dworkin later modified his view. He gave up on procedural independence and just defined autonomy as a “second-order capacity of persons to reflect critically upon their first-order preferences, desires, wishes, and so forth.”


But this new account seems to change the subject from the nature of autonomy to the capacities one needs to have it.


Christman’s theory


Both Frankfurt’s and Dworkin’s theories are ahistorical, current-time-slice views of autonomy. Christman thinks that that won’t do – that we need a historical approach. And so he proposes the following:


    A person P is autonomous relative to some desire D if it is the case that P did not resist the development of D when attending to this process of development, or P would not have resisted that development had P attended to the process.

    The lack of resistance to the development of D did not take place (or would not have) under the influence of factors that inhibit self-reflection.

    The self-reflection involved is minimally rational and involves no self-deception.

    The agent is minimally rational with respect to D at t (where minimal rationality demands that an agent experience no manifest conflicts of desires or beliefs that significantly affect the agent’s behavior and that are not subsumed under some otherwise rational plan of action).


Put plainly, the idea is that you’re autonomous with respect to a desire D if you attended to, and didn’t resist, the process of its development and if you’re at least minimally rational, self-aware, and have a stable self.


Some worries


    Are these conditions necessary for autonomy? Can’t we be autonomous with respect to desires whose origins we did not at the time endorse?

    Are these conditions sufficient for autonomy? Can’t there be “recalcitrant” desires – i.e. those whose acquisition we endorsed for good reasons but which are now alien to us? Frankfurt’s model seems much better with respect to those.

    Does this account fare better than either Dworkin’s or Frankfurt’s at handling the three aforementioned problems (i.e. manipulation, the regress, and the ab-initio problem)?


The worry about the regress is as follows: if not resisting a desire’s development is a choice, we can ask whether that choice was itself autonomous, which presumably would require postulating yet another such choice to make the first choice autonomous, ad infinitum.


Christman responds that the regress is cut off at the first level. If the appraisal of the process by which a desire developed is carried out with sufficient self-awareness and minimal rationality then the act of appraisal, he thinks, is sufficient for the autonomy of the desire.


But minimal rationality is a purely formal notion. And self-awareness, it seems, is entirely compatible with having a thoroughly manipulated self. In any case, isn’t the appraisal to be done in terms of the agent’s existing desires, and don’t these need to be autonomous to confer autonomy upon the appraisal?


Christman attempts to avoid this problem by noting that so long as an agent’s reflective capacities remain intact we needn’t worry about the autonomy of the guiding desires. But that seems unconvincing. Minimal rationality and a lack of self-deception don’t seem capable of warding off manipulation all on their own.
