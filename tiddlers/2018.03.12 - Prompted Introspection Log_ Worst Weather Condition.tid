title: 2018.03.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: Worst Weather Condition

!! What is the worst weather condition you have ever experienced?

I was heading up to the board of education to fill out some paperwork regarding our healthcare. I was about to pickup my wife and newborn daughter from the hospital to take them home. As I stepped out of the car, my ears started popping, and I looked up and a funnel cloud was descending upon me. I shouted to the others in the parking lot to run for the building. Car windows were shattering around us. We got in and immediately yelled for everyone to get to the bathrooms. It was intense.

10 minutes later, we walk outside, and the gas station next to us is gone. The tornado wiped away everything except the walk-in beer freezer (including the pumps). The people in the gas station were huddle in the freezer. It was pretty crazy.

That is not the only +150 mph wind I've encountered, but it's the one that sticks out to me.
