The cane is a symbol of my honor, not yours.

I have told the story, but you are too old to read it.

It's difficult to take pity on humanity when it is currently hurting you. Is humanity a cornered, frightened creature lashing out, or is it the xenomorph freely being psychopathic? Ultimately, I can see both so clearly in my longstanding problem in defining freedom. If you are wrong, you run the risk of being the Gimped Stockholm Rape Victim Submissive of Humanity or you delusionally engage in an unjust war against not a creature which merits empathy instead of our hatred. 

Was Humanity Free? Insofar as it is free, it is clearly evil. Insofar as it isn't, then have I done something morally unjustified in treating it like it wasn't evil? Surely I cannot be held accountable for it since I am human, and I am not free. Ah, you think I have made the Good vs Right Slip (a variant of the Is/Ought problem), but I have not. Why should I care about the good if there is no right? You cannot beg legitimate, objective, unconditional normativity in your question.

Hence, I am at Just War with Humanity.

It is not clear to me that psychopathy is conceptually wrong. Lying to the axemurderer is not only good but also right! You should empathize with Hitler to some extent, but there are places where you should not live in his world. When following the golden rule in this most objective sense, you must choose not to empathize, in a sense, with many. The de se de re problem is one of the primary issues here. 

You have to empathize in the right way, for the right reasons, at the right time, and so on. Essentially, by that definition, you must be psychopathic (non-empathic) in the right way, for the right reasons, at the right time, and so on.
