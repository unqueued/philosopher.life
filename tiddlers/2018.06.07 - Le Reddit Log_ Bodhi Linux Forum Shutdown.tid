Who isn't disappointed? This sucks. Even you think so. This must have been a very hard decision. Sorry, bro.

While I think every human is obligated to significantly contribute to the welfare of humanity to the extent they can, I also don't see why this project is the only way in which you can contribute. In other words, you are volunteering, right? I don't see why we should expect you take on the risk (I'm open to the possibility, but I don't see the argument).

Perhaps I am ignorant (most likely the case), but I am confused about why you didn't try harder to find a way to allow someone else to hold the legal responsibility for this project. There are people who clearly have no problem taking that risk. I think we lost something we didn't absolutely have to lose, especially if you were willing to cede control of it to your community. Of course, I may be missing a piece of this puzzle, so take it with a grain of salt.

In any case, thank you for your contribution. I hope you find other meaningful ways to contribute to humanity. Hit me up if you want to talk.
