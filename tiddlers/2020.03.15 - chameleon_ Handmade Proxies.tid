[2:20 AM] chameleon: Makin' proxies ;)

[2:42 AM] chameleon:

[10:42 AM] h0p3: Delicious
[10:45 AM] h0p3: Not everyone appreciates playing with proxies (too much of the trading card mentality in some cases), but I like to explore with them.
[10:45 AM] h0p3: At the very least, no reason to buy a card I've never played with.
[12:37 PM] h0p3: Your commander looks like it makes for a beautiful control deck.
[12:37 PM] h0p3: Maybe with a combo finish.
[2:08 PM] h0p3: Also, I don't know if Derrida is something you would be interested in speaking with me on. I am not as allergic to that man as many analytic philosophers tend to be. I'm a huge fan  of (even in disagreement with) Husserl and Hegel, so Derrida and I have that in common.
[2:10 PM] h0p3: I'm a sucker for some of the Continentals too. It is one place where I push hard back against the analytics I know; they unacceptably underappreciate Continental philosophy for considering themselves people in pursuit of wisdom.
