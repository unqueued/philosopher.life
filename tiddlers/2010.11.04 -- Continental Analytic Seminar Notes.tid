Notes- August 24

Articulating Reasons:

    Assimilation vs. Differentiation of the conceptual



Differentiation-Animals don’t have language, thus humans are diferent. Animals don’t “feel” like Humans.

Parrot is like a thermostat. It says “red” like a machine.



What is unique about humans?



Assimilation explains conceptual show similarities between animals and humans.



    Conceptual Platonism vs. Pragmatism

Pragmatism explains concepts in terms of use. Heidegger and Pragmatism relates hammers to the actions.

Pragmatism seems to fit with assimilationism.

Platonist is like Descartes, and starts with representation. If you see a desk, you compare it to a representation in your head of a desk. Explaining something in terms of something which is a lot more complicated (the forms).

Galileo and Descartes used proofs about numbers to prove things about numbers. Equations represented space. The representation had many properties that had nothing to do with what they were representing, and that makes people nervous (as perhaps those non-shared properties may infect).

Pragmatists dissolve representation. Instead, you start as a creature in the world with various intentions and desires, and you just use the desk naturally, and that is how you come to understand it.

Practical inferences is parasitic on theoretical inference (like logic). This is different from practical pragmatism, rather than theoretical inference pragmatism, which does not emphasize deduction.

    Mind vs. Language as the locus of intensionality. (Prof things that Intensionality is based on action).

Language is primary to understanding the world. What differentiates us from animals is theoretical pragmatistic logic in our language, which we use to understand the world.

    Genus of conceptual activity

Representation or Expression (author is Expressivist)

Implicit in use, language allows you to convert implicit into explicit.

For example, Truth tables in Logic can be representational explanation of what “and” means in logic.

What is the status of the truth table? One might say it represents, the other says it is a shortcut??

Author wants to start with proof rules and then build up to the table. (implicitly known into Explicitly stated tables).

    Distinguishing the conceptual:

Intensional or Inferentialism

Morning Star = Evening Start

“Believes that”

“is necessary that”

A context where co-referring terms don’t substitute.

Author thinks that what distinguishes the conceptual are inferences.

    Bottom up vs. Top down Semantic explanation

Author says we start with sentences and then through inferential patterns we understand the sentences.

What makes something conceptual in that you are able to make many inferences about it.

    Atomism vs. Holism

Semantic Atomists thinks that Gary can have meaning outside of language and meanings, while Semantic Holists think that Gary can’t have meaning outside of other words and meanings.



Notes - August 26th

Recognizing something isn’t understanding it. Why is it reasonable to infer that something is a something (the input to Sellar’s model) – what sorts of premises are acceptable?

Practical inference is fundamental to the conception. This is pragmatism.

Brandom denies it. He think theoretical inferences come before practical inference.

Notes – August 31

Monotonic logic shows that if P then Q, if P and C, then Q is entailed. That is monotonic, but not very natural. Material conditionals are somehow non-monotonic.

Red isn’t just something we respond to, it also in our space of reasons.

Animals don’t have desires because they don’t have beliefs.

Enthymeme is a suppressed premise.

Davidson says, Belief + Desire (+ Rationality) -> Action

Brandom says, Belief + Action are used to explain Desire

Heideggerian , Desire + action explain belief.

Flexible adaptive richness is something that NPCs don’t have because you can kite and trap them in/against the geometry of the game.

Only doing x brings about y, so I shall do x. The desire is y.



Notes – September 2, 2010

Premises (entitlement) -> P -> Conclusions (commitment)

World -> P -> Act

Premise -> P -> Act  this is desire

Brandom claims that Reliable processes aren’t enough. A reliable indicator still doesn’t understand the concept of whatever they indicate. They need that concept in the space of reasons.



Notes – September 9, 2010

Only doing X will result in Y.

So I shall do X

Where, preference for Y if inference holds for best of X’s.



Brandom – A desire’s fulfillment condition Y is that condition which, combined with the belief that only “something” it a beat. That X produces Y, leads to the belief that X.-for a wide range of X.

You have to have beliefs to have desires.



Pragmatism is that truth is related to usefulness in some way.

P-True  Helpful in actualizing desires; Brandom thinks it leads to false action.

P-False  unhelpful



Conflicting desires.

The content of the belief that only doing X will result in Y is that condition which, combined with the desire that Y --- to result in bringing it about that X.

I desire Y

So I shall bring it about that X.

X’s truth condition function of this with wide enough variety Y.



Notes – September 14

Frank believes that the inventor of bifocals invented the lightning rod. (de dicto)

Frank believes of the inventor of bifocals that he invented the lightning rod. (de re)



R believes that the X is Y.

The X is such that R believes it is Y.



Notes – October 7, 2010

Belief can be false = Goal can be unattained

Notes – October 12

Brandom:

Representationalism – Platonism

Inferentialism – Pragmatism

Brandom departs from pragmatism in terms of his differentiationism. Sapience vs. Sentience. Sentient creatures aren’t in the space of reasons.

Brandom thinks practical inferences are parasitic on the primal theoretical inferences. Okrent denies this.

Goals don’t require rationality. You don’t need theoretical inferences for goals.

Physical-

Design-e.g. thermostat or computer

Intentional-



Martians, Dennett, understanding the physical algorithms of chess. Martians can predict and understand all of it at the atomic level. But, they are said to miss something about the game.

Intentionality, then, can’t be described purely in physicalist’s terms.



Boostrapping process:

Goal->Language->Rational Goals
