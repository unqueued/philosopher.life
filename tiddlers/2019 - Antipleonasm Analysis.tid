!! Audit:

* GATDAYUM! We got a badass over here. Look at them blademarx.
** [[Arrogant]] fool that I am, I'm proud of plenty of the work in here.
** Sadly, I perform this Yearly [[Audit]] while having paused this project.
* There aren't a lot of fiction characters I want to respond to. They didn't stick.
* It is exceptionally rare that I directly engage in [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] of writing from someone I know. I'm willing to be violent, but I don't want to be. It's much easier to talk shit about people who aren't living anymore.
* Part of the problem is that I know who actually said it. I'm not good at refraining from taking into account who said it. 
** I still have mixed feelings about decontextualizing and New Criticism.
*** There's something to be said about trying to just attack the idea de-coupled.
* Yes, this can be used for thinking about [[/b/]], but I think [[Retroactive Footnotes]] are better.
** This did teach me that [[/b/]] was leaking. It's everywhere now.
*** More importantly, it's about more explicitly embracing my affectation, even in cognition. 
** Dealing with other interlocutors is a much better use of my time too.
*** I still have to take breaks from some interlocutors. 
* This log infected the rest of the wiki too. Moral philosophy, especially politics, as {[[Focus]]} continues to become embedded throughout. It put me in a different mode.
** [[Good]] and [[Right]] are crucial topics. I can't answer these questions without reference to them, even if indirectly.
* I enjoy re-reading these. There's meat to chew on.
** It's also very expensive. That's why I've had to pause for now.
*** Look, I've had to drop tentpegs here. Good. 
** In a search, I tend to attach higher weight to these.  
** I have some visceral reactions to many of these.
*** Though, not all, and it's sometimes difficult to predict. Sometimes they are dry analytic exercises in a way. I didn't find a [[gem]] or something moving.
**** I wish I had more to say about my prediction inaccuracy.
* Sadly, the remember to remember of the [[title.Tag]] isn't so strong. Only some of them pop for me. That said, with [[Yearly X-Section]], that number will improve with these footholds.
** I'm still trying to convince my offspring to do this as well.
* There are no large interlocutors that escape unscathed, even when I'm fanboiing and dickriding. Good.
** I am bored when I agree too strongly. =/.
*** Mmmm...but, boredom is not a good enough reason, right? Even for a log that aims to be visceral.
** In any case, I like that I have some small systems of dialectics with particular authors (or cultures). 
*** I wonder if I should eventually tag them as such. 
* It's true: I wish I saw everyone engage in this practice. But, even I can't afford to do it at the moment. 
* I think I take it harder in this log when I feel like I've not said something relevant.
** That's okay though, right? You should have some places on the wiki like that.
* It's clear that precision is something I value highly in [[Antipleonasm]]s. A solid percentage of the time, my problems with the quote are that they've left too much out, and the ambiguity ruins it. Unfortunately, making it more precise would often make it too long for it to be quotable.
** The questions are often hilariously too large though, as I've mentioned many times.
* This log has crystallized for me the necessity of violence and clarified interpersonal dialectics to some extent.
** And, yeah, it's preachy AF too.
* [[Zizek]] has been quite a figure for me. He doesn't get a postmodern pass from me, but I admire his work still and a chance to be [[Straussian]] with him.
** Yeah, I also think the parasocial unidirectional relationship problem gets ugly here. 
*** As I've uttered elsewhere, I probably need to find some qualified interlocutors to wrestle with. That is missing in my life.
* This project makes me really sad sometimes, almost [[hope]]less. Facing the music is really painful. [[ridtyawtr]].
* I'm surprised by my informality at times. I don't know if that is really what I want for this project.
* One fascinating issue about the [[Monthly Audit]]s: the nature of the project crystallized, and there was little to say about it (or so it felt).
* Very weird to have anyone add their own work directly to my project. That so rarely happens on this wiki.
* I have really mixed feelings about famous aphorisms. [[Latin Proverbs]] had such a huge range. 
** I still don't know what to make of it.
* For now, it seems like I'll spin it up to point out what kind of work I'm doing when I need to do it. It's a workspace and a signal.
