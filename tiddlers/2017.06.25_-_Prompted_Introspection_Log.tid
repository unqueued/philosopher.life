!! Respond to the following quote: 

<<<
I have always imagined that Paradise will be some kind of library.
<<<

Paradise is an idea, nothing more. That said, a library does sound like paradise! What could be better than the joy of learning, thinking, reading, watching, and being philosophical? Add in some drugs, music, food, and worthwhile company, and you've got yourself the most badass party I could ever imagine. 

Honestly, that's what I hope to turn my home into. That's the contemplative life of paradise I want to live with my family. Seriously, it's my goal. I think I can make my children's lives meaningful, enriched, and fulfilling by trying to make their lives like a library. My wife is literally a librarian, and I think of myself as a guerilla librarian of sorts. That's what I want to do!

Also, just as a reminder, my wife owes me a roll in the librar'hay.
