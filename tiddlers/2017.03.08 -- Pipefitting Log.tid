title: 2017.03.08 -- Pipefitting Log

Today I barely even started on my Y-piece when my teacher told us we had another project to work on. We had to install regulators on the flow hoods for the grinding stations used by the welding class. It was cool. We took apart the pipe system and finally got to use unions. The math worked perfectly. I was quite pleased. 

My teacher attempted to convince me today instead to rethink the local union, particularly if they allow me to jump to 3rd year apprentice out of the gate. That would be a significant jump in pay, no doubt.
