Anonymity against whom? Relatedly, privacy against whom? It comes in many [[dok]].

Do you anonymize parts of yourselves against other parts of yourselves? How will you tell yourselves the stories of yourselves, and what makes the story [[Good]]? This is [[Self-Dialectic]]. I don't see any simple answers. I suggest [[T42T]] must be played even at that fragmented, Frankfurtian personal identity level. This is what it is like to game-theoretically constitute yourself with your self-chosen principles to generate what Korsgaard roughly calls an integrated self. The various kinds of denial of one's [[4DID]] is a hard problem.<<ref "5">> It's Parfit, Ship of Theseus, Buddhism, etc. Those structures define a great deal about [[The Existential Game]].
