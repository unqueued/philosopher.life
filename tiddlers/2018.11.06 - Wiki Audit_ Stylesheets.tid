[[Personal Stylesheets]] is now a thing. [[kickscondor]] ignored my question, so he gets what he gets until he says otherwise, lol. [[j3d1h]] added [[Sphygmus]]' fix to the stickytitles too. We're still not sure how to separate the text more. I don't mind them as they are, but I think others may find them unappealing.
