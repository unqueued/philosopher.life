title: 2017.06.09 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.06.08 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** I have been more depressed this week. I can see it. Speaking with my friends makes it even more obvious. I had to dredge up quite a bit and explain much of my new point of view (since they last saw me). I think I'm seeing part of that expressed here.
* [[2017.06.08 - Diet Log]]
** Edited and summed.
* [[2017.06.08 - Link Log]]
** Edited.
* [[2017.06.08 - Wiki Review Log]]
** Visitors and EQ.
* [[2017.06.08 - Pipefitting Log]]
** I feel like my pipefitting logs have been remarkably short. Why? One reason may just be that I'm not doing anything new. When I have new things I feel compelled to digest them. Another possibility is that I'm avoiding it. That is something I don't want to do. I'm not sure what else there is to say though. I feel like have a far more stable understanding of my environment.
