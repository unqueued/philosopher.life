It's a very weird feeling to be sending my children and wife into the arms of my enemies. My wife is capable and prepared, and it is a valuable experience for them all. I'm also glad that I won't be spending that time alone, being able to spend that time with my brothers will make it easier.

I think Android is an exceptional ecosystem of externalizing costs. That hardware is far more capable than what you get out of it. It could be far better. Applications in that ecosystem are designed to quantify your existence for the developers/owners.

One of my primary arguments against tags is that the ability to search for strings of text is often the more powerful and effective way to search through my wiki. When is a category worth a tag but not a directory/link structure? I would like to see example uses of tags that demonstrate why it is the superior tool for that particular context or usecase.
