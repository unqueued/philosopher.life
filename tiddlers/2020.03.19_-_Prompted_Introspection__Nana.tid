title: 2020.03.19 - Prompted Introspection: Nana

!! Think of a loved one that you have lost. If you could ask this person one question, what would you ask, and what do you think they would say?

[[2018.06.03 - Prompted Introspection Log: Lost Loved One Question]] has all the expected content. I'm not interested in asking them questions at this point, and that's a shift since having written it. I've done what I could.

I've lost my grandmother. Nana. It's been interesting to see the interpretations of her life from people after her death, including how she affected my still living grandpa.<<ref "a">> As a child, I  loved and liked her. As I have aged, I've grown to not like her nearly as much as I once did, but I still [[love]] her or images of her.

I don't know what one question I would want to ask her. I'm sorry, interlocutor. That's not a simple problem. I have propositions about her that I'd like to know the truth or falsehood of to enable me to make better predictions about the world, to understand my own stories with security, and to have just known the truth (which I obviously hold as a kind of end in itself). 

I also don't know how my grandmother would react to me asking the question. She has never firmly grasped who I am, and it would be like an alien asking her the question at this point. I think her reaction to the appearances of who I am presented to her hypothetical [[phenomenology]] would be generally one of horror. She was a controlling woman, and I cannot say she was wise about it. What do you think of my post, Nana?
