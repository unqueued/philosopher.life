title: 2018.08.08 -- Cogburn: First Contact

Hey Jon,

This is just a message out of the blue to establish contact. I'm reading your excellent book; I hear your open voice like I've been sitting in your classes again.

I know you have interests in paraconsistent and intuitionist logic. I think you should take a(nother) look at Linear Logic (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-linear/). It keeps popping up everywhere for me, including the thing we're pointing at, and it may help us more safely ask better questions about the infinite and multi-threaded processing. This adversarial logic of resources might be a key in 21st century logic, especially as we continue to define the dialectic and semi-humbly engage in realism about metaphysics. I could be entirely wrong, of course. Hopefully, it's worth your 5 minutes. 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
