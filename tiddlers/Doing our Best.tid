title: Doing our Best

What does it mean to "do your best?" 

I take the goal of this sentiment to point out our innate finitude and fallibility. Essentially, we only have control over so much. We are only capable of achieving so much. We are only human. 

Doing your best at X does not make you good at X. Being better than other people at X does not make you good at X. You can do your best and be terrible at X. Doing you best at X means you can't be blamed, in that instance for X.

But, when are we not doing our best? The small things I want to point out seem to be part of a larger problem that I didn't have control over.
