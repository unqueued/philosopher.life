Am I the only one who will admit the really obvious solution to this version of utilitarianism?

It's not really about maximizing happiness; it's about maximizing my happiness. And if that means everyone else gets to benefit, hey, cool.

There's no "repugnant conclusion" required. An infinite number of people who are one red whisker shy of committing suicide don't improve my happiness, so it's not actually within the universe of desirable outcomes.

You aren't the only person to consider that move. I see no reason to think it's an obvious solution, but it's an interesting move. 

Egoism is often considered even more repugnant since it generally doesn't fit standard concepts of justice (it's fairly easy to come up with counterexamples which don't fit most intuitions). Moral philosophy, at that point, is no longer a question of what we owe to others in virtue of their otherness and who we ought to be beyond some trivial game about how to be the most effective sociopath possible (including learning how to lie to oneself in particular ways, conveniently choosing to turn off one's empathy in select moments, and exploiting how our awareness of others' happiness plays a functional role in our own happiness).

Obviously, there are possible worlds in which any number of people one red whisker shy of committing suicide would improve your happiness. Even capitalism in the actual world appears to be a pyramid scheme that benefits those at the top, and both of us appear to be parasitic beneficiaries.

Minimizing the scope of whose good is being weighed even down to the individual might not buy you what you hope either. Parfit is also concerned with the problem of identity, and it appears even egoism falls to the repugnant conclusion which applies to one's own timeslices. Even the egoist suffers from the problem of identity. Which self is the real you? Why should you care about your future timeslices, and which parts of you ought to sacrifice for the others, including one's [[4DID]]?<<ref "d">> Similarly, if our human brains each contain collections of minds, we may be left with some version of the repugnant conclusion about our constitutive parts. 

It turns out that what's repugnant about capitalism, amoralist anarchism eschewing the rule of law, and the will to power of collective identities is parallel to and found in the individual human as well. 

I think the Parfitian repugnant conclusion is suspiciously (perhaps artificially) set up to avoid the causal forces between two or more sets of persons, and it can be easy to misapply. Usually, there's a methodological reason that allowing inequality is immoral and not merely a particularist one pointed out by the utilitarian. When you attempt to justify most appearances of the repugnant conclusion methodologically, you arrive at egoistic answers: the Rand-Locke memeplex. If happiness is taken to be the end, egoism that doesn't aim to dissolve itself into [[Others]], an identity which prizes itself above all others by definition, a self which believes it is the exception to all rules, the ego which assumes it is justified in privileging itself above all others perspective tout cout, will devolve into psychopathy. Ethical egoism cannot remain either ethical or egoistic for very long.
