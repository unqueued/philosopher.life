title: 2017.02.24 - Realpolitik Speculation: The Militarization of Police

//There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people. - Commander Adama//

When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. The state should not be solely comprised or even run by those who are trained to hunt enemies of the state. Everyone looks like a nail to those who lack the sufficient empathy necessary to commit regular violence against human beings.

When Libertarians and Socialists agree to the same thing, you know it's profoundly important. The 'U' symbol of the political horseshoe theory is obviously false in crucial ways, but I think it also has a rule-of-thumbness to it that is remarkably accurate in other ways. They are mortal enemies in metaethics (I realize there are people who consider themselves Libertarian Socialists, but I do not think they understand Libertarianism), and yet they have a profound common ground in their appreciation for idealism. There is a deep clarity with which both ideologies can interpret and explain the relationship between human rights and property rights. These extreme political ideologies are right about the dangers of the police state and the militarization of the police. When they agree on a political and metaethical claim, the rest of us should be paying attention. This is no accident.

Wikipedia says:

<<<
Militarization of police refers to the use of military equipment and tactics by law enforcement officers. This includes the use of armored personnel carriers, assault rifles, submachine guns, flashbang grenades, grenade launchers, sniper rifles, and Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams. The militarization of law enforcement is also associated with intelligence agency-style information gathering aimed at the public and political activists, and a more aggressive style of law enforcement...[Police militarization is] "the process whereby civilian police increasingly draw from and pattern themselves around, the tenets of militarism and the military model."

There are ways to confabulate into believing this is not a problem, ways to see a positive spin on this definition. I see people actively ignore the actual consequences of it, who purposely fail to see the implications of it. Allow me to flip your conceptual analysis around and prevent your Slip into rationalizing the existence of militarized police.

We all have such an easy time pointing out the obvious flaws in military coups d'Ã©tats. That's the Policification of the Military unchecked (or poorly checked) by other political forces. I think the militarization of the police and policification of the military are working towards the same goal. They obviously are working at it from different angles. The subject and modification swap, but both combinations pursue and mix into being the same end. If you are vehemently against policification of the military, and you should be, then you also have a strong //prima facie// conceptual reason to think the militarization of the police is a really bad idea.

Militarism, by definition, is the theory and practice of fighting against enemies of the state (and all that is entailed). The militarization of the police, like the policification of the military, makes civilians and everyday citizens the enemy of the coercive arm of the executive branch of the state, a.k.a. the police. The enemies of militarized police are the very people they were meant to protect.

Plato was right about this; Marx and Orwell, too. Hobbes, Machiavelli, and Rand were too (descriptively, not prescriptively), but they can go fuck themselves. Socialists and Libertarians everywhere see it plainly. These idealists tend to be more likely to clearer explanations for the appearances of this flaw in societies. When they both agree, you know something is really up. 

Police officers obviously favor the increase in power through militarization, in the threat they pose, in the fear they strike into people, in the "safety" they earn for themselves through improved physical and mental weaponry. 

American police:

* have official political structures and relationships similar to the military and their respective politicians.
* have enormous ties and shared social networks with military culture.
* are classic "good ol' boys' clubs" and self-protective brotherhoods.
* worship the military.
* style themselves as being as cool and alpha as the military.
* tend to be conservatives, Christian, and nationalists. They are famous for being racists as well.
* suppress high IQ recruits from joining their ranks, but have an average IQ of 104 (slightly above average).
* form capitalist havens and are deeply corrupt. Quotas, theft of civilian property, and corporate/wealthy influence are profound examples. 
* promote and execute the enforcement of law insofar as it maximizes their profits, job security, and power (but not necessarily otherwise, except for the sake of appearance). They use us as revenue streams.
* literally bribe politicians through campaign contributions and whatever insider lines of credit (be they social, financial, or otherwise) to maximize both their militarization and the mass-imprisonment of the U.S. population.
* act as a domestic standing army.
* really do commit serious acts of violence against innocent people. Police brutality, harassment, profiling, and unjustified coercive practices are very real.
* protect wealthy and powerful people but rarely the poor; the enforcement double-standard is tremendous.
* almost always do not respect the exercise of constitutional rights, not only frowning upon it but actively punishing it insofar as they can get away with it.
* often do not care about being philosophical about the law, in knowing why they do what they do and how to do it well. They do not understand the nature of the executive branch and regularly remain ignorant when it benefits them to do so.
** Respectable-appearing lawyers, consequently, can actually intimidate them to some degree in unexpected contexts.
** The AM-I-BEING-DETAINED-activists might be crazy, but they have a point. 
* should be feared when legal scholars and lawyers regularly tell you not to talk to cops without representation.<<ref "1">>
* will act as if you have no rights unless you express them.
* are deeply hostile to being filmed, recorded, and other transparency mechanisms (ironically, they fear being held accountable).
* are themselves often illegally immune to the law.
* are perpetrators of enormously high rates of domestic violence.

The laundry list is long. Police militarization is a classic problem. We're just seeing our own implementation of it. 

On a more personal note, I literally don't know a single good cop.<<ref "2">> Everyone I've known who became, are, or were cops hovered between ignorant and malicious. They certainly do not fit Plato's Guardian class; that's a bad sign.

I'm an educated white boy. My car is ugly, and so am I. But, I look and sound educated. My children do me great service as emotional evidence to others that I'm a decent human being. I'm generally not too stupid around cops. Essentially, I often have less reason to personally fear cops than others. But, I am still afraid of the militarization of the police. Here's why:

* Police enforce capitalism, and therefore, are deeply involved in the enslavement of the masses. They do the dirty work. They are the most physically reified whip of capitalism.
* Fascism thrives on the police militarization. 
* They are beholden to almost no one and have the "legal" rights (full or grey) to beat your ass. If in practice, possession is 9/10ths the law, then we must deeply fear when police aggressively pursue the possession of the public. 

Police abuse their powers. Our military is a psychopathic force in the world, and when we militarize our police, we turn that psychopathic force upon ourselves. We must empathize with ourselves (and the world). We the people must keep coercive powers (and power in general) in check by whatever means are available to us. Yep. Fight the power, bitches.
