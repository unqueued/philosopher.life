title: 2019.01.27 - Meditation: No Race

I stretched, did some yoga, and even did some push-ups. Stretching is the easiest part, and it helps me get rid of my shoulder pain. I want my yoga to expand. I want the lowest-hanging fruit and nothing else. Some basic strength work would be fine with me too. In the end, I want to build up and then rest.

Meditation was dope. I concentrated on breathing and releasing my chest/shoulder tension. I didn't feel like I was racing today. I enjoyed it this time.
