title: 2020.04.20 - Wiki Review: Catholics R Addicted 2 Cats

//Nested completion failures in my [[review]]s.//

** Deconstruction without reconstruction. Sneering is necessary, often enough, but rarely sufficient. I doubt their motives at the end of the day. 
*** I can appreciate the [[pleft]]ist diaspora, especially given how much spectrum space sits on that side of the Overton window.

** I'm glad we moved to the next day. I've "got people" as he says.
*** He does too though, but in a more disconnected fashion. =/

** Rousing success. I adore this multi-angle summary thing. 
*** I'm so grateful my son can participate in this. It's been a difficult climb.
