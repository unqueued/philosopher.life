*** Excellent argument. Index funds work, but they might not give us a say in the same way (kinda defeats the point they are making though). This seems to be an attempt at arguing for the socialist prescriptive of decentralizing power. Unfortunately, that war cannot be won on capitalist terms. The article does not recognize that.

*** Ah, now this is an argument! Strawman the fuck out of them, but I want to see it. I love ad hominem because all too often, it reveals something crucial about at least one intercolutor or the other.X
*** It's fascinatingly wrong on many fronts, but it also poses important questions. I must spend more time thinking about it.

*** Disgusting. Paying for your militarization so directly, it's slapping us in the face to normalize it.

*** The barrier to entry is only going to get higher and more selective as the crisis of capitalism looms.
** http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmh.1395/abstract
*** On average, women really are more social, capable of empathizing, and I think less susceptible to psychopathy. Like IQ, I assume there is also higher variance that pushes men to the extremes of both ends; men are the testing grounds for human evolution.

* Think About It
** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/03/opinion/the-macroeconomics-of-trade-war.html
*** Well...except I disagree that we are near full employment. I disagree with you radically on that, and your argument is much weaker without that assumption. Protectionism might actually have some profoundly useful effects, although I'm still against it! The retaliation issue is hard to even predict; it's going to be a catastrophe perhaps even bordering on overt, explicit world war III (not that we aren't already engaged in something like that already, but less pronounced and not accepted outloud).
*** I just noticed this is Krugman. I should have ecognized your foul stench when I was brought on board (jk). Lol. Well, look I realize how decorated you are on the topic. It's absurd in the eyes of any sane person to think I have a right to disagree with you. Sorry, bro. Even you can be paradigmatically wrong in this respect. We often don't see eye to eye on the nature of capitalism.
