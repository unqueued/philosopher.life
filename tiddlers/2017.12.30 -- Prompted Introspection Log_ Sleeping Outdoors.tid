title: 2017.12.30 -- Prompted Introspection Log: Sleeping Outdoors

!! Tell about a time you slept outdoors.

My favorite was sleeping on the back patio with my wife. I know you didn't ask about my favorite, but this one just jumps out at me. I treasure it. We layed down blankets in very late fall, cold enough that it was almost winter. We snuggled, banged, and I felt alive outside with her.
