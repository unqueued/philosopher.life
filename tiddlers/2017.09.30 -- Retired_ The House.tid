title: 2017.09.30 -- Retired: The House

The Fremen saved for generations to transform the face of Arrakis into their paradise. I hope to save for mere years to achieve a plot of land and house that I can legitimately call my dream home.

---

One story
--OR two stories, but w/ balcony
Extra wide doors
Signs for all the rooms
Excellent soundproofing 
A musical wall where instruments are stored
Desks w/ comfy seats
Three or four bedrooms + a barracks
**Barracks: Beds to the ceiling; each bed w/own drawers & electrical outlets/psuedo desk (little Japanese containers)
***The barracks should be technically long-term livable; up to 12 ppl
All around the house porch - maybe part should be shutterable - comfy seats
3 bathrooms - one large Master, one general, one barracks
Combined living room/study/library
**Pool table in the living room
A badass aquarium, designed into/part of the house, like in the wall, and you need like a scuba suit to clean out, that [[h0p3]] is responsible for taking care of
Tiered theater - giantass tv/projector, comfy sofas &/or recliners

* Rooms
** Foyer/lobby
*** Store shoes, coats, umbrellas, etc. Take a load off, or get ready to go.
** Basement
*** Easy place to create our own secret space after the home has been built.
*** Laundry Area
**** Laundry chutes from bathrooms and rooms. Make life easy.
**** Two washers and dryers.
**** Altneratively, we build the Laundry area at the center of the house and have chutes in that direction.
** Kitchen+Dining Area
*** Stainless, longlasting appliances.
*** Industrial dishwashing
*** Deep freeze
** Living Room
** 3 Bedrooms
** Barracks
*** 3-Tier Custom Bunks, with bottom mattress literally being on the floor.
**** Very sizable gel-based twin mattresses
*** Two sets of bunks. Tiny room.


* Aesthetic, Details, etc.
** Walls
*** Prefer minimal walls, more open spaces.
*** Obviously, we're going log cabin all the way. So, wood.
**** Don't forget to store extra wood of the same kind/type/batch
*** Could have modular kinds of walls. We build the house perimeter, and walls are something we construct later. 
** Floors
*** Hardwood, stone, or very nice mixed stone/concrete. 
** Doors
*** Cat doors on all doors that allow cats to get through. I want nice heavy doors.
*** Red Front Door
*** Indoor are all Long-handled
**** Lockable with simple picks
*** Prefer doorless in most walkways
*** Cat Doors
**** Autolocking catdoor that can only be unlocked with RFIDish collartag. 
** Windows
*** Polarized to block all light
*** Mirrored for privacy
*** Shutters
*** Massive in size; could even take up entire walls for all I care.
*** Very sturdy
*** Needs to be highly insulative. Perhaps 3-trip pane with vacuums in between?

* Laundry Chutes
** I want it to be easy to move laundry. Make life easy.

* Heat/Cooling
** I want a wood stove to heat the house incase fo the apocalypse. I don't need a fireplace, hearth, etc. I just want the backup.
** Amazing Central Aircon
** Are there natural, low cost ways to cool houses? What are they?

* Security
** Solar-powered security cameras, motion sensors, etc.

* Networking
** Network/Server/Control/Security Room Closet
*** Locked, requires a real key
** 10GBit Ethernet throughout the house
** A solid wifi system with major coverage.
*** Spend some serious time and money on it.
** Preferred VM Firewall, transportable to new hardware, etc.
** Check to see if we can run fiber to the house.
** Long-range wifi anywhere on the property
** Mile-long connection to remote router/modem (gives us options for where we live, although makes us dependent)
** 4G/5G access. Failover and binding.

* Bathrooms
** 3 Full
** Urinal - automated
** Long toilet (fat people in my family)
** Built-in Bidet (in one of them)
** Flowing sinks with deep basins.
** Floor drains
** Laundry shoot
** Serious cabinetry and storage
** Easy clean surfaces
** Giant vertical drop down shower
** One-way mirror/glass or "opaque" color on outside but still seethrough from the inside, large for the bathrooms.

* Roof
** Appearance is irrelevant. Function is absolutely everything
** Solar where possible
** I want it to last forever and be easy to repair.
** I want to avoid cleaning it as much as possible.
** Funnel water into cistern or other. Make use of the rain. 
** Would love a rooftop guardtower/belltower/lookout area.

* Geography
** Preferably in/next to the woods. Few if any neighbors, but just enough that we can get utilities.
** Living next to a body of water would be amazing.
*** Pond for fishing
*** A lake would be insane. Maybe expensive. 
*** Creek/River for mobility, power generation, water source, and because it is cool
** Preferably on top of a hillside
** Would be great to have goats, bees, and cats (cats a must)
** Prefer the chance to purchase more land if we wanted

* External aesthetic and utility
** Electrical outlets scattered around outside. Built-in retractable extension cords even better.
** Patio entrance

* The Shop
** Wildflowers or Vines externally
** Fuel tanks
** Prep storage
** Safehouse/basement for Tornadoes
*** For funnsies could have secret tunnel =)

* The Greenhouse

* The Pool/Garden

* The Yard
** Rainwater can be automatically directed to our trees, bushes, and used to irragate our garden.
** Significant tree line. Perhaps plant quite a few of our own. 
*** Would love to plant trees that grow fruit and nuts especially. A pseudo-orchard would be nice.
*** Oaks, cherries, mulberries, walnut, etc. 
*** 1 maple
*** Must be hardy through different seasons. Preferablly can live without much water or in intense heat, global warming.
** Vineyard area.
** Corn, X, tomatoes (three sisters)
** Berry bushes

* Driveway
** Automagically lit
** Prefer something resistant to ice. Treelines help. Severe treeline or bushes is nice too.
** Parking should be double lane and circular.
