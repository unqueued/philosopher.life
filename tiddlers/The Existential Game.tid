Life is not some mere language game. It's meaningful beyond words. Itself ineffable except perhaps to itself, [[The Good]] is what bestows meaningful meaning to all meanings. The [[Eudaimonic Lifehacker]] is whom I believe to be the most virtuous of virtuous agents. It's about doing your best to be the best version of you that you can be.

At this level, Game Theory is not merely about utility maximization inside of various rulesets/mechanics. You have to, in faith, establish your "Bob" turtle of "turtles all the way down." There is a game to understanding the utility calculus which supercedes all others but is self-referentially tied to itself.
