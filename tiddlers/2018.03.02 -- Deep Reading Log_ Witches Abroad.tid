title: 2018.03.02 -- Deep Reading Log: Witches Abroad

Classic LoTR feel to it in the travels.

Nanny's made up foreign-language approach is hilarious. She does have language skill, but it presents oddly. This book is funny.

Have you brushed your tooth?

Lol. =) This is slapstick.

My wife should write fiction like this. /roll on tvtropes and just make a story with it.

<<<
Grey. One eye. The left one...

I love the absurd overspecificity. 

It's interesting how Granny is not a person of doubt. She does not doubt herself or find herself when she wakes up, she knows who is doing the looking. Foreshadowed hard.

<<<
Proper meals...with gravy!
<<<

I've got some gravy for these slaghags. =)

...Interesting that "affecting the laws of chance" is wicked. These are witches. Magrat is naive.

Witches are conscious of stories.

Kind too children if they've been washed... rofl. =)

Love Oggs gyrating bosoms. =)

I think this book's notion of Voodoo is fun.

I'm still not understanding the ontology of the "Disc World." I need help, please. 

<<<
I am the good one.

Everyone thinks they are good. Know Thyself.
