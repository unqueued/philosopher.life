title: 2019.01.15 - Prompted Introspection: Homeless Game

!! What would you do if you were homeless?

It depends on whether or not I wished to live. I think you need to tell me what I have to work with, where I'm at, etc. There are immediate safety concerns, but after those have been addressed, I'd be in a position to try to bootstrap. 

This is a game I think about. It's a stoic exercise. I often look at where I'd sleep, sources of food, etc. I grew up poor, but never homeless. I'm still aware of some aspects of it, especially having grown up a PK. 

This is one place that I can say the Christians I know have a higher chance than the average population to be a decent person. That said, they are doing it for the immediate gratification, for prosperity teachings, and because it signals to others. They don't do it from duty. Move to a larger topic in justice, and you will see they tend to be terrible humans. My wife is the gorgeous exception. She really does give me [[hope]].
