title: 2012.10.08 - Epistemology: Doxastic Voluntarism

Doxastic Voluntarism may be important for those who hold robust moral realist theories, particularly those which rely upon metaethical ideas of libertarian freewill, etc. 

The inability to control what one believes makes



Doxastic voluntarism seems untenable with respect to all my beliefs. I can't make myself believe the sky is green (when it is blue), and I just don't seem to have any control over the belief that 2+2=5. I don't have direct control over many of my beliefs. 

Conversely, it does appear that I do have indirect control over many of my beliefs. In many cases, it seems as though I am able to  induce, cause, or bring about the circumstances which lead to a particular belief. Isn't that what learning and education are often about? I may want to believe something, but I don't know why I should believe it, and in researching and learning about the issue, I eventually come to believe due to my own course of action. I may not believe the claim that 42 * 42 = 1764, but I may wan to believe it, I may sit down to work the problem out or use a calculator that I trust, and cause myself to believe it. An indirect form of doxastic voluntarism, at least with to respect to many of beliefs (perhaps not all), does seem to fit my intuitions. This, of course, doesn't seem to be a freedom of belief, but a freedom of action to induce belief. So, do I not have any control over my beliefs?

To deny that I have direct control over some of my beliefs (as I will readily admit), of course, is not to deny that I have direct control over all of my beliefs. I have to ask: Are there some cases where I have direct control over my belief? I'm not sure. It seems to me that if there are any cases, they require a very specific kind of context. I can't just be offered a million dollars to truly believe something, particularly about those things of which I have a strong conviction, and there seem to be some beliefs over which I will never have direct control over, as the evidence is that powerful.

What about an epistemic dilemma which practically requires an immediate decision? Let us say I have equal evidence for P and for ~P, and I have a choice to make right now that requires that I have a believe about the truth of P. It seems to me that I can freely take up either P or ~P in that moment - I'm driven to do so, and I am not driven to choose either option by evidence. The choice of this belief does seem to be directly up to me. Isn't this a direct form of doxastic realism that fits our intuitions? Now, maybe the initial criticism of this example is that it is puruposefully not about the evidence, and that might be missing the real debate. Perhaps that's true, but I'm not convinced of it (yet).

It seems that the kinds of examples I'm considering which favor doxastic voluntarism the moast are the kinds where I lack strong evidence to persuade me, and yet have practical needs which drive me to form a belief. Note that this requires a specific context. In most cases, if I don't have strong enough evidence for P or ~P, then I claim some kind of agnosticism (for lack of a better word) about the issue. I can say I don't have a specific belief on that matter. I don't always have the luxury to be agnostic, however, practical matters may force me to make a choice. These seem to be strongest cases for the possibility of doxastic voluntarism to me, there may be others. 

Interestingly, it seems that all the cases which favor doxastic voluntarism (that I can see) are not the kinds of beliefs which are justified enough to call knowledge. If this is true, then having knowledge, in this context, is not directly up to us, only indirectly. Even worse, it seems as though the beliefs which are directly up to me are not epistemically justified, or at best, very weakly epistemically justified. 






Enriches moral life and enhances moral responsibility. 



Where and when am I in control of my beliefs?

Why is it important for me to be control of my beliefs? What are the ethical implications to it? 

What are some beliefs over which I believe I have control over? I think we need to add, in what circumstances do I have control over my beliefs?

Doxastic Voluntarism doesn't have to be 'All or Nothing,' and Moral Considerations

A kind of overstated doxastic voluntarism, where I have control over absolutely all of my beliefs, seems untenable. I can't make myself believe the sky is green (when it is blue), and I just don't seem to have any control over my belief in 2+2=4. I don't have direct control over many of my beliefs. I especially agree that I cannot choose to believe just any arbitrary proposition for just any reason(s), which appears to be the initial strawman that opponents of doxastic voluntarism might be tempted to attack. 

It does appear, however, that I have indirect control over many of my beliefs. In many cases, it seems as though I am able to induce, cause, or bring about the circumstances which lead to a particular belief. Isn't that what learning and education are often about? I may want to believe something, but I don't know why I should believe it, and in researching and learning about the issue, I eventually come to believe due to my own course of action. I may not believe the claim that 42 * 42 = 1764, but I may want to believe it. I may sit down to work the problem out or use a calculator that I trust, and cause myself to believe it. An indirect form of doxastic voluntarism, at least with to respect to many of beliefs (perhaps not all), does seem to fit my intuitions. This may be a kind of control over some of my beliefs, but only in a weak sense. Perhaps I am actually considering freedom of action rather than freedom of belief - it is not very clear to me.

To deny that I have direct control over all of my beliefs (as I will readily admit), of course, is not to deny that I have direct control over any of my beliefs. I have to ask: Are there some cases where I have direct control over my belief? Maybe. It seems to me that if there are any cases, they require a very specific kind of context. I can't just choose to believe something because I was offered a million dollars to believe it, particularly about those things of which I have a strong conviction, and there seem to be some beliefs over which I will never have direct control over, as the evidence for those beliefs are so powerful. 

What about some kind of epistemic dilemma which practically requires an immediate decision? Let us say I have equal evidence for P and for ~P, and I have a choice to make right now that requires I have a believe about the truth of P. It seems to me that I can freely take up either P or ~P in that moment - I'm driven to do so, and I am not driven to choose either option by evidence. The choice of this belief does seem to be directly up to me. 

It seems that the kinds of examples I'm considering which favor doxastic voluntarism the most are the kinds where I lack strong enough evidence to decisively persuade me, and yet have practical needs which drive me to form a belief. Again, this requires a specific context. In most cases, if I don't have strong enough evidence for P or ~P, then I might usually claim some kind of agnosticism (for lack of a better word) about the issue. I can say I don't have a specific belief on that matter. I don't always have the luxury to be agnostic, however, as practical matters may force me to make a choice (or perhaps by whim in some cases). These seem to be strongest examples for the possibility of a direct doxastic voluntarism to me. 

One might counter that I'm merely 'acting as if' I have a belief, but I don't really have that belief. I'm not convinced this is always the case, but I don't have a nice argument against this criticism. 

Interestingly, it seems that all the cases which favor direct doxastic voluntarism (that I can see) are not the kinds of beliefs which are justified enough to call knowledge. If this is true, then having knowledge, in this context, is not directly up to us, only indirectly. Further, it seems as though the beliefs which are directly up to me are not epistemically justified, or at best, very weakly epistemically justified. Rather, it appears as though I justify the beliefs that are up to me through practical reasons instead of epistemic reasons. 

I don't find this particularly worrisome if we buy into something like Haack's 'special thesis,' the claim that epistemic normativity is a subset of moral normativity, that the force of epistemic normativity essentially exists virtue of its contribution to moral normativity, and that other considerations of morality may override epistemic considerations. 

If we don't buy into this 'special thesis', I do have worries. It seems as though beliefs which we have chosen are necessarily blameworthy choices - we've done something epistemically irresponsible and wrong. Essentially, we would be right in saying "You should never choose to believe."
