title: 2018.08.17 - Prompted Introspection: Scary Weather

!! Write about the last time weather scared you.

How badly? I always have a tiny hint of fear with lightning, but it quickly subsides and is overridden. I'm worried about my children whenever it's really hot out. I absolutely hate driving in snow and rain, although I do it. The obviousness of global warming scares me long-term. Drought reminds me of waterwars and exploitation. To various [[dok]], weather scares me in different contexts in different ways.
