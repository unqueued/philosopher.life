title: 2020.04.22 - TDL: Fluxx

* [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]: [[Economic Justice]] presentations
* Meatballs, red sauce, linguine, veggies
* I think people are tired of //Dominion//. Let's try Fluxx?
* I'm not in a rush to plant, but she might be for particular things. 
** We follow her timing.
** It's so cold out, nearing freezing temps at times.
* [[AIR]] and [[Sphygmus]] have been incommunicado.
** Not sure if there is anything I should do here. These are not fun times. Defensive curl.
* [[Link Log]] would be nice. 
** Piles are ridiculous.
