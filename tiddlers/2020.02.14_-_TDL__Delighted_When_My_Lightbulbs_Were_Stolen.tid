title: 2020.02.14 - TDL: Delighted When My Lightbulbs Were Stolen

* Date
* Chores, my ninja
* Make sure your son finishes his construction projects. 
** He's eating into space, and he's taking longer than he ought.
* Daughter has a make or break day tomorrow. 
** Encouragement and accountability is all I got sometimes.
* I'd like to see some cleaning and organizing in the house.
** Bathroom and garage especially.
** Offspring need to get them rooms cleaned up.
* Make sure your wife gets some chill time, including that awful Dr. Who show. 
* We could get a dining table, maybe? 
** I think my wife is tired after work. Spoons. Already trying to conserve them for her, sending off on her own after work to gather. 
*** Maybe the room should be for something else? 
*** Fact is, most of us just want to sit in comfy seats and snuggling while we are talking.
** Can't invite strangers to eat dinner with us in a way that will make them comfortable without a table. 
*** There's that cheap set on CL that's been up for a while.
* Need a light for my desk, and need to add bulbs to lamp.
* Bliss? 
** It's fuckin' dope, yo.
* Some1 is DTF in the morning. Blood plasma and mucus, let's do this shit. Be there, or be square. 
* Time to start cold-brewing again.
