title: 2018.08.28 - Deep Reading: Dune

The significance of the social interactions in this book was fantastic for an autist. I'm still in awe these decades later. I would like to thank my //father// [[MWF]], acting beyond mere donor, for having read this book to me.

OMG I LOVE THE JAMIS FIGHT!!!

The mother guilt-trip scene always struck me as bullshit.

It's always interesting reading this as a father. What a powerful story! The reverend mother test with the water of life, the ripping away the veil, the forced loss of innocence, the whirlwind they experience in that moment. It's insane. It feels like my own life as a father.

I definitely feel like Jessica at times. 

I have to say, after reading this book for the umpteenth time, I find the latter third of the book less moving than the first third. The resolution is less interesting to me.
