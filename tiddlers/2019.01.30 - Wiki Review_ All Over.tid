title: 2019.01.30 - Wiki Review: All Over

* [[2019.01.29 - Computer Musings: SYU]]
** Lazy bum. =)
* [[2019.01.29 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Power Functions]]
** There are those who take up the classic mystical perspective who might still disagree with my critique. I cannot define power at that level.
* [[2019.01.29 - Prompted Introspection: Odd Transport Is Away!]]
** Edited.
** You know, I feel like I've halfway even stopped trying to answer the questions, and I just run with whatever matters to me. I'm okay with that.
* [[2019.01.29 - Wiki Review: Be A Man!]]
** It's okay. In time, this will smooth out. I'm hoping TW just takes off!
* [[2019.01.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Snowday!]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.01.29 - TDL: Snowel]]
** Yeah...right. ROFL. Well, that's okay. Keep proving it to yourself.
* [[Unboxing Turing Test]]
** Rambly, and that's okay!
** I definitely see the schizotypal differences in how I speak here. I'm not comfortable with it, but I don't see a better route. If I look stupid, then I look stupid. `/shrug`
* [[2019.01.29 - BDS97: Control Mode]]
** I am ridiculously excited. This has at least a chance in hell of working.
* [[2019.01.28 - BDS97: bye tokio]]
** As usual, I question whether or not I am of any use to this man. I'm honored to have to chance to speak with him about it. It's so very clear I'm out of my league and I'm not the partner he really, really needs. But, I will do what I can!
* [[2019.01.29 - chacham2: First Contact]]
** 99% sure they didn't see it.
* [[chacham2]]
** I can't tell if they are joking or not. That's fascinating.
* [[AI: T42T]]
** Unfortunately, I have no idea how to extend the notion.
* [[2019.01.29 - k0sh3k: Notes]]
** Thank you, love.
* [[2019.01.29 - Tri-Force Spamming: Muh Tags, Yo]]
** I ended up just asking the chat channels...
* [[Tri-Force Spamming]]
** Something is right, but it isn't quite operational.
* [[Prayer]]
** Preach.
* [[Moth Languages]]
** Perhaps this will be expanded. It's one of those things that may be nothing, but may turn into something. It's a good point.
* [[2019.01.29 - Wiki Audit: crypto]]
** Meh. I don't see the point.
* [[Seeking The Dialetheia]]
** I'm mystic. I don't enjoy accepting it.
* [[2019.01.29 - Self-Dialectic: PD]]
** Edited.
* [[Process Discipline]]
** Bye. I don't have enough to say right now.
* [[2019.01.29 - Sapphomo: Taking Forever, Sorry]]
** I'll get there.
* [[2019.01.29 - Charlie: Human Forecasting]]
** I'm pleased to hear from him. I wonder if he was asked by Missy and Carl?
* [[Our Numbered Days]]
** I'm going to take a break.
* [[2019.01.28 - Le Reddit Log: Ad Hominem]]
** Yeah. That tends to be right.
