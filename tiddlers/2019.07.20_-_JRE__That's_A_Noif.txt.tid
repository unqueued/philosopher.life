I saw my coworkers knife to sharpen it, really liked how it felt and thought of you, so I ordered a new one for me to modify for you.  The old knife was my coworker's that I returned to him after it was sharpened

Uh, the knife you made for me is gorgeous.

I'm slow.

Hi slow, I'm high

That is awesome.
SAT 12:15 PM
Thank you, btw.

It's amazing.

I love the size of it too.

I liked the look, and got it because I was more certain I could take it apart

If you tap each wooden side you will notice one has a hollow sound

That is where the spring for the opening assist is located
SAT 12:17 PM
Also, I think I did a shitty job peening the brass, and I think the only thing holding the two halves together is the epoxy on the pins.  Peening turns out to be harder than I thought
SAT 12:18 PM
Love death and robots was approved for a second season
SAT 12:19 PM
I can't notice the difference in sound. But, I can't pick out watermelons either.
