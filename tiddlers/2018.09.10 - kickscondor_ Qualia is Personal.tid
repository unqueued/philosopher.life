title: 2018.09.10 - kickscondor: Qualia is Personal

Dear [[kickscondor]],

I cannot in good conscience wrestle with you until you explicitly ask me to do so at this point.<<ref "s">> If you wish for my analysis of your post, I will give it as kindly as I can. I've been struggling with what you have said for quite a while now.<<ref "w">> To my horror, I only now see the open wound you point to, friend.

I want you to know I'm literally crying as I write this letter. I believe I have oafishly stumbled over what you might be saying to me,<<ref "l">> and I will not speak it outloud any further than I must to make an apology.<<ref "p">> I said before that I am a poor interpreter of poetry, including your own. I [[hope]] you will forgive my brutality. I have no idea what you are experiencing.

//Fire// is fully real, sir. I did not mean to even remotely imply otherwise. I believe you point me to something very //pure//. I suggest you will never be able to fully reveal the meaning of such suffering, not even to yourself.<<ref "g">> I can see you are trying to express it, which takes a profound [[dok]] of courage. If I could give you a hug across the internet I would. I do not understand [[The Good]], sir.

I am sorry. I hope you know that my generating a model of you (reductive by definition) is not equivalent to the claim that I take you to be my model. It is only the best representation I can see. Your qualia and pain are not things I wish to diminish in the least, but I do hope to understand you as best I can. I do not make light of suffering, but I will recognize it out loud; it is my duty-privilege as a witness of Humanity.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
