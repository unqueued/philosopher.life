title: Principle: /b/

[[/b/]] has been a useful experience for me. It has been a gateway and a vehicle for interpreting myself in several dimensions of this wiki. I aim to amply use the "+" button to just make a new tiddler, not worry about naming it or thinking meta about it, and just jumping into it. This is the stream-of-consciousness ready-to-hand mode where I must minimize communicational friction from my present-at-hand's feelings towards an object. 

So, now [[/b/]] can make tiddlers on command with "New Tiddler," and I will just leave the mess for my future self to cleanup. It's better to say it without an idea of how to organize it, than not say it at all. As my daughter points out: "It's better than nothing."
