Jan 29 1:34pm
Well, it just so happens that, barring Ed, she is currently the most knowledgeable/up to date human on the State of Sho 👀
Jan 29 1:40pm
Been thinking about that FB replacement for you. Maybe you should try out Tiddlywiki and Resilio sync like we do.
Jan 29 1:41pm
(I know you can set it up, and I think it would fit your writing style, part of which is rapid and prolix, very well)
Jan 29 1:42pm
Better than e-mail, by miles
Jan 29 1:42pm
Take you ten minutes to have one up and running
Jan 29 1:43pm
How's Ed's music going?
Jan 29 2:23pm
Dude, I'm EXHAUSTED. Very emotional and mentally questionable day/s I've been having.
I will get back to you... 

Hug that fantastic human you've got for a wife for me, please, okay?

At least, I think she's human. 
Dinnae think it'd put me off if she weren't, though...😂
Jan 29 2:28pm

She might be an angel. =)
Jan 29 2:28pm
I'm sorry you are exhausted. =(
Jan 29 2:28pm
Get some rest!
Jan 29 2:28pm
(if you can)
Jan 29 2:28pm
so, just talk to [[k0sh3k]]. she kens everything.

I mean, about me, and Ed's music, actually, at this point. Apart from everything else lol

Friends... things are very grim here, today. Being taken out of the EU (against our democratically-expressed will) is going to have serious and seriously-negative repercussions for many people - including me and Ed. The degree to which availability and affordability of fresh food, medicine and other items is in doubt. That's not even considering the degradation/removal of workers rights and environmental standards that the English government has planned. That's not even considering their imminent selling of our National Health Service to private (and mostly american) interests.

We are scared. We are sad. We are angry.

But I know a lot of you are curious as to what, exactly, is going on... so all I can do, at this point, is share with you the communication today from the Scottish Government.

Thank you for your support to us, personally, and for your general support for Scotland to move forward in the world and improve, becoming more like our scandinavian neighbours, as opposed to going down the fucking toilet with England because the 1% will benefit.

I feel a bit foolish for getting excited about the ScotGov stuff that was released earlier. Just desperation, really, and the tiniest seed of hope that hasn't QUITE died.

We've long feared that the SNP are a 'toom tabbard' - empty jacket - mere facade - based on a lot of what's happened since 2014.

There's an article - which you should read if you're really interested, although I don't blame you if you're not - https://wingsoverscotland.com/the-betrayer/
which pulls together everything we knew, and a lot of stuff I didn't know.

I reached out earlier because, in all honesty, I (and Ed, also) am just desperate to feel a bit of solidarity, I suppose. And hope.

I'm sorry, if this is nothing to you, sorry I wasted your (and my) time.

But this is all very real, here, and it just got much, much scarier. Ed has been wanting to explore options... in terms of, can we get oorselves settled in Europe in the next 11 months so that we don't spend the rest of our lives in what is literally one of the worst countries on earth in which to live.

Thank you. Just, thank you.
♥️

Yeah, shit is fucked.
Jan 31 12:27pm
I hate that you might have to move away from the country you love. =/.
Jan 31 12:28pm
That is literally just sinking in. Started to cry and panic and Ed was like, just don't. We have to be strong. We have to.
Jan 31 12:47pm
I know you have sacrificed to be there. It's a part of who you are.
Jan 31 12:48pm
ach, we're not gonnae fucking leave. I mean, i doubt we'll 100% rule it out until it's too late lol

But still. We've got to be prepared for some hard times. We need to get oor house built so we have a base, and then we can make some lifestyle adjustments. Make a move towards growing some of our own food, and buying things like organic flour in bulk so we can make our ain bread, shit like that. I mean, on one hand, I cannae be arsed... but on the other, foodstuffs are getting/are likely to get SO expensive... and of course, without EU regulations, the quality will go downhill, too. 

But anyway, potatoes will grow and the summer sea is full of mackerel. We'll survive.
