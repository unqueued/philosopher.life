Well met, nomad! It is a pleasure to read your words.

Besides my family, you are the first person to ever send me TWcode to place [[directly into my wiki|2018.08.29 -- Sphygmus: Find The Others]]. You give me a gift! Your empathy is an unpredicted surprise to me, stranger.<<ref "d">> I spent an hour last night speechlessly thinking about it.<<ref "s">> Thank you for taking the time to speak my language and to reach out to me from my own medium. I do not know if you use Tiddlywiki or some other tool, but I wish to repay you in kind.

Your name means //pulse//.<<ref "g">> That is a fascinating choice. Please tell me the origins of it in your mind and what it means to you. Why do you choose this name for yourself? Perhaps it is meant exclusively as poetry, and I apologize for being the unsophisticated literalist who wants to make it explicit. I want to know you.

<<<
Today, when I was catching up with your wiki, I noticed you emailed a professor at my hopefully-soon-to-be alma mater. I read the article you'd mentioned and realized - I had taken a class from this professor.
<<<

I can only guess at this point. I assume Maryanne Wolf or Lisa Ruddick. I would be interested to understand your interpretations of any of these articles.<<ref "a">> Also, if either guess is correct, I'd like to say I'm also jelly you were able to learn from these teachers. It may be the case you know quite a bit more about what they are talking about than I do, and I would like to understand your perspective.

It's neat to be connected by this thread.

What do you enjoy studying? What's your major? What occupations are you looking into?

<<<
You have become entangled in my mind, alongside my many other unsuspecting mentors, both well-known and obscure. The lives of so many people intertwine in weird and intricate ways, braiding together and apart.
<<<

Perhaps you are experiencing serendipity or the sublime. There are more words and phrases for it. It's an overwhelming thing. I should begin an entry for it in my [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]]. What should I call it?

I [[hope]] to bind us together. I see it as our moral duty to braid our society together; we need it now more than ever. I experience a painful awe in thinking about the interconnectivity within and emergences from the hyperobject of Humanity (and beyond).

Who are your mentors, idols, and people who shape you the most? 

<<<
At some moments I check your site from a distraction-impulse, seeking either to avoid some emotion or fill some unconscious need. At other moments it stems from a desire to reach out and connect, to spend some time contemplating the thoughts of a fellow nomad.

[footnote "LG"] I am taking on and using some of your vocabulary - this is something that happens to me, I notice - my voice and dreams are malleable, molded by the books or people or voices or games or obsessions I immerse myself in.
<<<

I am glad you reached out! It is a lonely desert. I hope to be of use to you. Let us wander together.

Your footnote describes something I strongly agree to!<<ref "lg">> I think it's part of who we really are. When I taught philosophy, I often knee-jerk-reaction peeled apart the argument from the person for my students.<<ref "h">> Looking back, I think I did this to ask them to be more open to parting with the components that comprised them (that may be unacceptable); charity often demands it. Whatever it means to say it, I actually think our books, people, voices, games, obsessions, ideas, desires, behaviors, and principles we bind ourselves to are the most constitutive parts our unified identities. I'm glad we share these parts of ourselves with each other, and I think empathy is literally about constituting ourselves with the other, empathically transmitting, weighing, and integrating ourselves with each other's identities.

I apologize if I'm preaching to the choir. I don't know when I'm repeating something you've already read or understood from my work (even if I should be able to infer it from your writing). As you know, I have a tendency to be verbose and redundant,<<ref "r">> but I do so to extend and connect. I don't fully understand the process, but I aim to demonstrate what you say matters to me.

Let me add, while I had a profoundly religious upbringing, I don't consider myself qualified to speak as a deeply spiritual person. I have been told many times over the decades I have a "cold" faith. I use the only language I have to attempt to express something which I believe is ultimately ineffable (the irony of the contradiction is something I wrestle with a lot).

<<<
I was turned off by the language in your top level directories when I first followed a link from kickscondor to your domain, but returned to dig deeper. I feel a resonance, something that pulled me back and keeps me returning.
<<<

I apologize for turning you off. That's not my intention. I am glad you resonate with me still! I appreciate your willingness to empathize with me, even if I am obnoxiously disagreeable. As you have seen, I may be a madman in the desert. Your demonstration of empathy in [[T42T]] and joining me in [[Find The Others]] is not lost on me, and I hope to better understand your perspective on it.

If and when you feel willing and able, I would like to know how to improve my top level directories.<<ref "e">> I appreciate your honesty. To come back is a commitment. I'm not able to clearly explain how moved I am that you don't throw me away. I'm curious what parts of my wiki you have read.

<<<
I have many thoughts about things you have written, that I have read. Many of those thoughts do not feel fully formed, or I worry that they would not stand up to your scrutiny. 
<<<

I hope you will forgive my often inappropriate scrutiny. Like a dumb brute, I often fail to be kindly shrewd in my transparency. I'm a mean wrestler, even with those I love. I do not want to extinguish the flame inside you. I understand very well what it's like to not have fully formed thoughts (that's just what my wiki is, I think). I hope to find a good middle ground for thinking about your thoughts with you.

What is most salient to you? Where do you hope to go in the desert, and why, nomad? Perhaps it is not my destination, and I may not understand it, but I will try to help you none-the-less. 

<<<
Forgive my fumbling first attempt at reaching out.
<<<

I think it has to be one of the kindest letters I've ever received. I wish I could "fumble" my first contacts like that. =)

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
