title: 2019.11.04 - Prompted Introspection: Early Bird

!! What does "The early bird gets the worm" mean to you?

Success is your destiny, of course. You just need to reach out and take it.

We live in a just world in which all you need are guts, moxy, taking initiative, first-mover advantage, and discipline to get yours. I need to pull myself up by my bootstraps. Working 120 hours a week instead of 40 will certainly enable me to accomplish a year's worth of full-time work in 4 months. 

With a few qualifiers, this isn't reducible to mere prosperity gospel, but who wants to be exacting with their words here?
