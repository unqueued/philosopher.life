My brother went to see some friends out in the woods. They gave him a knife and a blanket. That's awesome. He had some car trouble, and the host drove out to pick him up. 

He has 4 more days of hell in the kitchen, and then it will get easier for a few weeks.

My brother had a panic attack when his roommate left for a trip.

I was asking about why he was angry with his roommate, and then he abruptly ended the call. But, then we called back with what he wanted to say.

My brother advised his roommate not to drink when she is stressed.

We talked about our relationships. He promised to consistently connect with [[JRE]] IRL.
