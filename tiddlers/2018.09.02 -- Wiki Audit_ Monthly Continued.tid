title: 2018.09.02 -- Wiki Audit: Monthly Continued

Upon my [[Wiki Review]], I decided to continue to give some touchups to [[Wiki Review]], lol.

[[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] also a couple touch-ups. This is good to give it another once over. I'm glad to see this shit crystallizing. I'm also happy to see it integrating further into the rest of the wiki.

[[/b/]] had a couple nitpicks

[[Prompted Introspection]] is reworked. I've added an interlocutor too. It's much cleaner. I had a lot of errors in there. jesus.

!! I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS MONTH'S AUDIT QUA WIKI AUDIT.

Admittedly, this is a lot of work. It's right on the edge where I feel like I should consider Retiring to mark the occasion. I'm going to try now to though. I hope to really integrate this into my auditing without it actually being seen as radical shifts for me.

[[Wiki Audit]] had a small botox injection. It was already very well-made, imho. Cleanup was easy!
