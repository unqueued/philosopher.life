How's your week? Have you given more thought to the housecleaning?
2 hours ago
 Week was stressful.  I am glad that this is going to be a long weekend.  I have done some housecleaning but there is quite a bit more to do.  I have an easyish time making plans but have a hardish time following through on them.
2 hours ago
 Intimate time with the wife with the kids away has helped.
2 hours ago
 aye

 Work has been much more stressful than I ever anticipated.  I have been getting some overtime in to stay above water.  I need to learn to relax I think.  I seem to be running circles around the others that were hired the same time I was.
2 hours ago
 I'm sorry. That sucks.
2 hours ago
 Good to know there are people who aren't doing as well.
2 hours ago
 I hope you find a space to relax.
2 hours ago
 Yeah, don't have to beat everyone just the ones that are gonna get eaten by the bear
2 hours ago
 hehe
2 hours ago
 a fine analogy

 No communication from my boss in this case is perhaps a good thing.
2 hours ago
 hopefully
2 hours ago
 The other guy from my old department has missed lots of work recently.  The stress is making his migraines flare up.
2 hours ago
 He very well could be the one eaten by the bear
2 hours ago
 They own ya
2 hours ago
 But I could be making this all out to be mountains when they are not but mole hills.
2 hours ago
 Who knows.
2 hours ago
 Anywho, I have my IA cert and I can go to another firm if SHTF with this one.
2 hours ago
 noice
2 hours ago
 I have three in total now.  Anything short of management of other investment advisor representatives is available to me.
2 hours ago
 Management would require two more certs, which are a total pain in the ass to get.  Gotta know your shit when it comes to options trading.  Now that is some complicated shit.
2 hours ago
 I splurged and bought a computer by the way.
2 hours ago
 ha
2 hours ago
 what'd you get?
2 hours ago
 I'm surprised you didn't say anything while you were getting it.
2 hours ago
 Ryzen 2400g w/ a b450 mobo.  The parts should be arriving mid next week.
2 hours ago
 Nice. You going for Windows?
2 hours ago
 We will see.  I'm gonna do some messing around and see what falls out.
2 hours ago
 I hope all has been well with you and yours?
2 hours ago
 aye, you can see on the wiki
1 hour ago
 it goes well
1 hour ago
 Yeah, I took a look at the wiki earlier.  It just feels odd finding out about what is going on with you by reading about it.
1 hour ago
 Why's that?
1 hour ago
 But hey, I'd be reading about it here if you answered by texting it to me.  Must be an information flow thing.
1 hour ago
 That is a good point.
1 hour ago
 I like that my wiki allows me to give structure to the story. I think it gives you a chance to hyperread me like we hyperread the web. Technically, you could read everything I write (probably take an hour of time each week to do it though...which is a lot, imho, even for an old friend). I hope you find increasingly better ways to navigate and skim my self-representation.
1 hour ago
 There may be hope yet for being able to effectively digest it.  I keep coming back to it.

 I got to talk with some of [[Jop]]'s family this morning.  Very interesting.  I was not having issues understanding them as much as in the past.  Her brother was playing DOTA on a handheld device.  He was laneing.  I heard that and burst out laughing.  They are expecting a daughter in October.  [[Jop]]'s grandma is not doing well.  Kinda emotions all over the place.
1 hour ago
 rofl, handheld sounds like hell...I know people who play with a touchpad, and that is fucking insane.
1 hour ago
 Yeah, I agree.
1 hour ago
 [[Jop]] was telling me about that. Must be difficult.
1 hour ago
 Yeah, I have been expecting her to come into health issues for years now.  She is a tough cookie.  It would be very excellent to be able to have the kids and [[Jop]] be able to see her next year if she makes it to then.  Shit will get real real real fast if the worst comes to pass.
1 hour ago
 aye
1 hour ago
 It's cool that you are understanding them. You are clearly training yourself to live in Thailand.
1 hour ago
 I know your life is crazy right now, and with your new computer, will are going to be tempted to live in your vidya, but you may consider systematically learning Thai
1 hour ago
 I don't know if I would go that far.  I want to be able to do all I can to comfort [[Jop]] and make things as easy for her.to live here as I can.
1 hour ago
 learning to read and write it would be worth your time
1 hour ago
 fair enough
1 hour ago
 We have agreed that we are in the US for the kids and to get them a good education.  Until they are done I don't see us going anywhere.
1 hour ago
 that is settled then
1 hour ago
 That makes sense to me (but, you know that...I debated that with you in Metairie often enough).
1 hour ago
 Having Sarah going into the Gifted program at school as well puts the pressure on us to make sure we give them the tools and the discipline to best use them.
1 hour ago
 yes
1 hour ago
 gifted or otherwise, gotta give em the best you can
1 hour ago
 The biggest issue is that I have been a big failure at discipline myself.
1 hour ago
 I'm right there with you. I'm always in "as I say, not as I do" territory
1 hour ago
 Yeah, and those conversations with you in Metarie cemented this into us both.  We thank you.
