title: 2017.04.04 - Pipefitting Log

I read some of the Union history book before class started. We jumped into our project. The guys immediately went for grinding. Since there are 3 of us and only 1 piece, I decided to try and find something else to do. I decided it would be reasonable to cut the final hole in the "trunk." I asked my teacher to make sure this was reasonable. It was.

So, I drew the hole (outside and in, but "in" is what mattered). I used the hole-puncher (wears on my hands, I tell ya what) around the bright soapstone circle I made. I then grabbed the oxy-fuel cutting torch and cut it out. I didn't go too close to the line. I'd rather grind than completely fuck it up on the initial cut.

I ended up using an actual grinder to do the majority of the shaping on both pieces. Nash and Chris were lazy today. That's fine with me. I'll take the practice. I'm going to be excellent at this. The inner edges were tight and hard to grind cleanly. We eventually found rock grinders that did the trick (I forget the exact name, but they are literally made of a rock-like substance). I thought I may have ground the reinforcement plate down a bit too much. Turns out, the teacher said it was just right or that in the field I'd find I may need to go even further.

They went on break, and I finished it. The high-lo was clean. The pieces fit. I was pleased.

Afterward, I asked my teacher if we could actually try to weld it (and not merely tack it). I knew my teacher was running out of things for us to do (I saw his wandering), and it's clear he doesn't want us to move onto socket welds (I think he knows we are going to smash it). Since I'm less interested in hashing content I feel very comfortable doing, I'd rather work on things I suck at.

Further, Nash had been saying all morning he wanted to weld. It seemed like a good thing to do. Ultimately, Nash didn't really want to do that much welding. He wanted to screw around for a few minutes posing as a welder-in-training. He didn't really want to practice. The welds took hours. Chris did some, but he was clearly discouraged as well. I was doing half and letting them do the other half. I ended up doing the vast majority of it. Not a problem for me though, lol. This was some fairly expensive jumbo (as far as the shop goes) pipe to be practicing on. I doubt I'll get the opportunity to do that often.

As to the weld, it was tricky. Pipe welding is its own art/subfield of welding. I have much to learn. I fucked up grinding a non-root bead. I didn't realize it was a no-no. I don't see the difference between the root and others on this matter, but I'm going to take my teacher's word for it. He may not have explained why, but at this point, I'm sure he correct. It was very difficult to make clean welds. I tried several techniques. Eventually, I went with the large rods for the final caps. The teacher was pleased enough with them. More importantly, I was pleased enough with them. It wasn't perfect. It wasn't even respectable for a professional. It would have worked in a pinch though, I tell ya' h'what.

We also got our study points. I'm about halfway through them. We were talking later in the day about how we have 3 more books to complete after this one. I need to keep pushing hard. Certifications, homie: get 'em. I need to find out if there is an NCCER practicum aspect of the curriculum. Basically, I would be unhappy going through the extra books not to be certified (although, I'd still do it).
