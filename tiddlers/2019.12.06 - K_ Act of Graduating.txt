It‚Äôs going to take all weekend, but I‚Äôm gonna finish this project. 

Hope you have a good day :)

What's the project on?
Dec 6, 2019 10:53am
One last push toward! =)
Dec 6, 2019 10:53am
I‚Äôm translating the Wanderer from the Exeter Book into modern day English. Just the first 25 lines. Then I just have to write about the process. :)
Dec 6, 2019 10:56am
Oh, you got this, homie.
Dec 6, 2019 11:05am
That's your cake class, right?
Dec 6, 2019 11:06am
Aye. I‚Äôve already done most of the translating too. I just need to turn it into prose.
Dec 6, 2019 11:06am
That has to be the hard part.
Dec 6, 2019 11:06am
This is old English haha
Dec 6, 2019 11:06am
Honestly it is, but because you got me the e-book it takes almost no time. :)
Dec 6, 2019 11:06am
Ctrl+F is powerful
Dec 6, 2019 11:07am
haha
Dec 6, 2019 11:07am
e-books are sometimes wildly better than print, that in particular
Dec 6, 2019 11:07am
The prose part is the artistry, the magic. Some people do that for a living, if I understand correctly.
Dec 6, 2019 11:08am
I'm the wrong sort to do that. I'm so literal, and I want to peel apart different interpretations. 
Dec 6, 2019 11:09am
If it were a medievalist, I could see myself at least entertaining different ways to take these pieces. That‚Äôs what my prof does for a living haha
Dec 6, 2019 11:10am
You get to make art for last project. Pretty killer, dude.
Dec 6, 2019 11:10am
After that, you is done, right?
Dec 6, 2019 11:10am
You have all the paperwork necessary for graduating completed, all that stuff?
Dec 6, 2019 11:11am
(your professors have likely already said you will be passing to the admin)
Dec 6, 2019 11:11am
Correct! To my knowledge EVERYTHING will be ready for graduation. I need to do exit counseling so the financial aid office will fuck off with their ‚Äúdaily reminders.‚Äù But that can wait til the project is done. Haha
Dec 6, 2019 11:12am
I pick up my cap and gown Thursday and graduate Friday.
Dec 6, 2019 11:12am
You have kicked so much ass, dude.
Dec 6, 2019 11:12am
Also... I think I‚Äôm going to graduate with a 3.0
Dec 6, 2019 11:12am
Thanks :)

Dec 6, 2019 11:14am
(it's longer than it looks, and don't trouble yourself with it until you have free time, and only if you want to)
Dec 6, 2019 11:14am
Oh is this your letter?
Dec 6, 2019 11:18am
Yes. More effort than I know how to explain went into it.
Dec 6, 2019 11:19am
(which doesn't make it good, but I'm glad I did it)
Dec 6, 2019 11:20am
I‚Äôll definitely check it out for you. What kind of feedback do you want?
Dec 6, 2019 11:27am
I don't need any feedback. It's totally up to you if you want to say anything. I'm just sharing who I am with you.
Dec 6, 2019 11:28am
Gotcha gotcha :)
Dec 6, 2019 11:32am
It‚Äôll make a nice palette  cleanser from my project.
Dec 6, 2019 11:33am
Congratz on finishing, btw.
Dec 8, 2019 7:16pm
Thank you. Now I just need to see these grades...
Dec 8, 2019 8:33pm
I'm sure it will be fine.
Dec 8, 2019 8:33pm
I‚Äôm also anxious about the actual act of graduating. Like can I just skip it? Haha
Dec 8, 2019 8:39pm
Ha, you can.
Dec 8, 2019 8:39pm
Reminds me of this:
Dec 8, 2019 8:41pm
College students don't want to go to graduation ceremonies, but they go to please their relatives, while relatives don't want to go but go to support the students; we should all just be honest and skip that ceremony and go out for pizza...Watching a graduation ceremony is like sitting through a movie that's entirely end credits...Everyone hates being sung happy birthday, and everyone hates singing happy birthday, so what the fuck are we doing here.
Dec 8, 2019 8:41pm
It makes no damn sense. Hahaha
Dec 8, 2019 8:42pm
Thank goodness I‚Äôm not alone. üòÇüëÄ
Dec 8, 2019 8:42pm
Have a great day!
Dec 9, 2019 10:05am
You too. What you up to?
Dec 9, 2019 10:34am
I‚Äôve got work from 10-4 today and tomorrow. Wednesday I have nothing! Thursday is rehearsal and Friday is graduation. :)
