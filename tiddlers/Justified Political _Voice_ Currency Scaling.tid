title: Justified Political "Voice" Currency Scaling

Okay, crazy idea: what if we tuned the amount of "Voice" you are given based upon your demonstration of competency. This may feel like eugenics and eumemics. So, let's just consider it hypothetically.

We could voice to those who deserve it the most conceptually. The poor, the philosopher kings, the young, etc. Those whom are affected most by the laws, those who are most vulnerable, those in most need, those who are most exploited, etc.

Scaling "Voice": meritocratic political capital

Is this really an application of [[The Golden Rule]]? Maybe. The contextualist and the anti-luck epistemologist can easily show us how.


Those who demonstrate themselves to be exceptionally knowledgeable in political wisdom, in Statesmanship, in empathizing with others (we could test this!), in not being a psychopath (we can develop better and better tests for it) who elects not to empathize with others, etc. might be given bonus credit. We want to reward people who are legitimately trying to follow [[The Golden Rule]], to implement [[The Original Position]], or at least effectively codeswitch into appearing like they do.
