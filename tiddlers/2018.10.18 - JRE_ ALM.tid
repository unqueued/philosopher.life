He called me up. He said this second draft is more civil, though still obviously angry. I am grateful to have him to think about it with me.

We talked about Wiki Apostleship. My brother says he is too lazy to engage in it. I know how much work it. I also tried to explain that I don't want to compete with him or be a backseat driver. This is one of the reasons I think he should keep it private like [[Sphygmus]]. 

My brother is concerned about being too honest at work. People don't like him. The furlough was a warning shot/sign. 

We talked about the Saudi journalist, how this problem is widespread.
