title: 2004.10.12 -- A Feminist’s Critique of Nozickian Entitlement Theory

	In her critique of Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia, Susan Okin explains an absurdity that follows from Nozick’s conception of justice. Nozick attempts to form a system in which a “society is best and most morally arranged when it leaves each to produce what he can by the use of his own talents, and to enjoy the produce of such labor and luck combined” (88). Nozick’s entire theory assumes that people “own” themselves. If people did not own themselves, then there wouldn’t be much sense in the idea that people could be entitled to other holdings (which is the whole point of entitlement theory). Under Nozick’s conception of justice as entitlement, all persons are “entitled” to the products created from their own capacities and labor. Okin explains that since all human beings are the products of female capacities and labor, then all human’s are owned by their mothers. Okin uses a reductio ad absurdum to defeat Nozickian entitlement theory. Nozick is unable to sustain the two propositions that 1.) All individuals own themselves and 2.) All individuals are owned by their mothers. 

	Nozick holds that “individuals’ entitlements to things they own take precedence over any other rights” (77). Nozick seems to prefer legitimately acquired property rights over rights to life and basic necessities. With an understanding of the primary significance of legitimate entitlement Okin walks her audience through a possible objection to her own argument. She defends against the idea of motherhood monopolies violating ownership rights of men and infertile women. The rights of non-owners are violated iff they are left worse off than they would be in a “baseline” situation. Okin states, “these women do not ‘worsen the situation of others; if [they] did not [produce children] no one else would have, and the others would remain without [them]’”(84). We can see that in the Nozickian world all people can “be in the market” for buying and selling children and persons. Thus, there is no monopoly created by mothers because all people still have the possibility of legitimately acquiring children. Unfortunately, Nozick’s system appears to devalue personhood while uplifting something even greater, entitlement and property. No doubt, I am pleased that my mother has yet to keep me in a cage for her own amusement, sell me, or kill and eat me as any Nozickian mother could. 

In defense of Nozick one could argue a distinction between infants and persons. If all infants are products of female reproductive systems (natural capacities and labor), then all infants are the “property” of their mothers/owners. Thus, infants do not own themselves. This does not explicitly necessitate that people do not own themselves. Nozick could argue that infants are not yet persons. Surely the mother is entitled to whatever or whomever is excreted from her womb as a product of her “natural assets.” But if a product evolves and develops into something as unique as a true person, does the mother still actually “own” that newly developed person? Nozick may have the position that only a person can be entitled to something. Otherwise, one could argue that an environment, a world, a universe, or some other inanimate object which “put its labor and effort” into creating all things within and from it, would also be owned by that environment or object. The universe would then own all within it, creating another absurdity. If Nozick proceeded to argue that infants were not persons, then obviously infants couldn’t own themselves (even if a person could be owned in the first place). Mothers (and fathers) could “own” their children. Nozick’s escape is in the notion that the very moment in which an infant is no longer an infant—where one “becomes a Nozickian person,” that person acquires himself or herself. Is it possible that the sudden appearance of a newly created person with autonomy, intelligence, rationality, moral agency, and free will gives that new person an entitlement to his or herself at that moment? Is the act of becoming a person also a part of legitimate acquisition of one’s self? People lose and gain holdings legitimately all the time; “losing” a son or daughter for that son or daughter to be entitled to themself may just be a part of the entitlement theory. Losing the rights of entitlement to a child, when that child becomes a person, may simply be a part of parenthood as a business venture—parents are just taking an economic “loss” when children become Nozickian persons. Even if infants come into the world already as holdings of their parents, persons that develop from infants are not necessarily holdings of their parents. 

On a different note, Okin’s argument appears sexist for neglecting the role of men in the process of procreation. Although she briefly goes over ways in which women acquire sperm, she merely assumes that women are freely given sperm or buy sperm. Women can and do legitimately acquire sperm, but Okin neglects the possibility that certain couples work together to produce a child. Thus, in at least certain circumstances, a child could belong to more than just its mother. Especially, if no contract of legitimate transfer is made other than that both parties wish to “own” a child, and then both parties not only play a role in the production, but are also joint “owners” of that child. One could argue that women play the most extensive and difficult roles in reproduction, but certainly the male played a vital role in conception as well; maybe ownership could be disproportionate. Even if mothers are entitled to the greatest proportion of ownership, many fathers would still hold at least some entitlement to a child they have labored to produce. Given that some sperm is “donated,” freely given, or legitimately transferred without asking for entitlement to products from that sperm (beyond payment), one could say that at least under certain circumstances, both a woman and man both “own” a child within a Nozickian world.

Okin fumes about pronoun usage, but we can’t hold that against her; she makes an excellent case against Nozick’s entitlement theory. Nozick doesn’t fail to take into account women; he simply neglects the truth that under his theory his own mother “owns” him; he cannot be entitled to himself. Nozickian entitlement theory is injured when people cannot “own” themselves because they did not produce themselves.
