title: McManus: On Bias and Truth in the Public Sphere

https://merionwest.com/2018/06/21/on-bias-and-truth-in-the-public-sphere/

Expertise and virtuous perception are biased lenses. I aim to pay you a compliment here when I say you tend to be biased [[irwartfrr]].

<<<
 Left-leaning activists, allegedly inspired by relativistic post-modern philosophies, accuse their opponents of any number of different biases in their reporting of “facts” and “truth.”
<<<

Pomo does have something to say about this. Philosophy of language is a quagmire, but I remain hopeful in the possibility of objective meaning and communication. Perhaps I'm a pragmatist who despises the term.

Marxists point out the legit gaslighting.

<<<
This has since become known as the problem of induction: just because things have happened one way before does not mean we can be certain they will again.
<<<

It probably balloons up into the problem of probabilistic reasoning in general. Induction is our plight.

<<<
Since then, we have become increasingly aware that the way to determine empirical facts, and what those facts suggest, is a rather complicated process.
<<<

Preach. 

I should add that much of induction relies upon treating others as my reliable indicators and experts. It's a network of social signals and probabilistic trust. Those networks are crashing against each other.

<<<
From a moral standpoint, if we believe life has unique value, it would be a tremendous catastrophe. Hume believes that we should give the latter moral standpoint more weight in our lives.
<<<

That isn't quite how I understand Hume's point of view at large, and I am not convinced he is ever in a position to wield the word "should" with any realism. I think some values, like [[The Golden Rule]] are facts.

<<<
Eventually, Hume moved away from scientific and philosophical research to attempting to discover what brings about happiness for himself and others.
<<<

A great way of saying he's a hypocritical piece of shit, god among skeptics. Dennett is the second coming.

<<<
I have posed two problems with getting rid of bias in the public sphere, posed by a great and scientifically minded philosopher.
<<<

ROFLMAO. I think you are joking with me, e.g. you know, one of the problems with finding peace in the middle east is the result of solipsism; I'm not convinced the external world is real. I think Hume destroys the world; there is no philosophy if he's right. If you are really going to take him seriously here, if you think there's a chance he's even right, you've got radically bigger problems than getting rid of bias in the public sphere. There's a big difference between the radical skepticism of Hume and worries about the limits of probabilistic reasoning in [[fff]] across the variegated spectrum of human brains.

You aren't going to be able to link Hume effectively enough, and yes, I'm taking into account the virtue-theoretic move you make here.

<<<
 On both ends these accusations are chalked up to the other side simply not “understanding” the way the world really is. I find this a largely a misguided way of looking at things. Great minds have spent lifetimes trying to “understand” how the world really is, and the issue remains perplexing
<<<

No, see, you must be misguided in your way of looking at things. Clearly, you don't see the way the world really is in this regard. =)

<<< 
 The issue is not a lack of understanding how the things are, but rather, how they are interpreted.
<<<

Suit up, son. It's time for you to start defining your terms so that I can ~~understand~~ interpret them. 

<<<
Moreover, even if I were to use what the New Science called “acts of imagination” (fantasia) to situate myself in another’s interpretive framework, there is no guarantee that I would agree with it.
<<<

A very serious problem indeed. Moving past the problem of other minds, qualia, etc. your point still stands. There's a problem in virtualizating another's mind without losing my own. 

<<<
My intention is not to endorse relativism of any sort. Indeed, I find the growing subjectivism of post-modern culture—particularly the rise of post-modern conservatism—to be deeply troubling. 
<<<

Preach.

Hey, this might be your weakest article I've read, but it wasn't awful. You make some damned good points!
