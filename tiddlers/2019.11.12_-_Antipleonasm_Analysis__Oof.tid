!! Respond to the following gem:

There is something about spending too much time on the same problem that may drive a person insane. I think it might create deep valleys over certain neural pathways that are shared with other important functions. For example after a year of grinding on the same problem of "get job" my mind has become hyper sensitive to patterns and hidden meanings like never before. I'll see a leaf blowing in the wind and my mind will sometimes slip into interpreting it as some symbolic message from the universe to help me find a job. In a way I can sort of understand these homeless guys that walk the streets talking to themselves - they might just be further along, so deep in this pattern recognition psychosis from trying to survive that their brains are telling them the whole world is talking to them directly.

Oof. That is, like, my life, dude. I have many huge projects, several of which are just {[[Dreams]]} I'm morally obligated to pursue in the desert. I am a madman. Literally, crazy person talking here. 

Take the common example: trying to [[Be A Good Dad]] drives me insane. It's an enormous set of problems for any man. It's a high-calling for me. My identity is at stake all the way down in whether or not I hand my creations the best I can with what I have. Despite what I've been told by folks over the years, I wasn't born to live in the world. Teaching my offspring to live in it is almost a cosmic joke; I'm grateful they know. I'm an exceptionally poor motivator, and understanding how to remove roadblocks for them is a nightmare. I can't show them the desert fast enough. My brain is melting itself trying to translate for them. 

It's not the leaf blowing which triggers my [[Straussian]]ism. Often, it's people, their processes and structures, tech, patterns in their behaviors, residue, markings, etc. The pursuit of [[salience]] comes with allergies, obsessiveness, depression, anxiety, and many other unpleasant features. It's difficult to build trust (never certainty, obviously) at some levels, but it's the risk we have to bravely take.

Further, I will rabbithole on damn near anything toward [[The Good]]; I'm constantly asking myself the question. I'm still hunting for some elusive hacks we need in this giant stack. I must dive into a lot of deep pools at once, more than a sane man would attempt. Here's where everyone would or does call me insane (perhaps excepting a few dozen people I've known): I think catastrophe is coming (I'll need to get my sign out and start marching on the streets), and I think people like me to have to start quadratically spending their lives in wild pursuit of outlandish answers. There's no small patches for this kind of fuckup. That's some sort of paranoic narcissistic messiah complex, I'm sure. Right, like "who the fuck am I?" I get it. I'd much rather just follow a routine with my eyes-closed, drown myself in vidya & drugs, and so forth. I don't see enough people stepping up (could just be where I live), so I don't have much of a choice. 

If you take the world's problems to really be your own, you are going to be marred and insane. Empathizing with a world in crisis (obviously an absurd claim to this hyperobject) is going to set you on fire. I wish the world would talk to me. Lol. How fucked up is that? I straight-up envy some of my brethren's ability to perceive a unity between themselves and the world. I still perform chemical surgery on myself to attempt to balance the autistic equation. Harrowing though it may be, I'm still in a race to find it.
