title: 2018.12.07 - Wiki Audit: Nope on 18

So, I tried it out. I saw that Bob is fine off CLI (just not the executable). Turns out, my [[Title of new journal tiddlers]] doesn't work. That saves me a fuckton of time. No thx. Also, have to figure out how to add loading splash. The instructions were not as clear as I'd have liked. It looks like the migration to 5.1.18 will actually take time. This is the first time that updating my wiki could not be blindly. =/ Welp, this is what committing to TW really looks like. It means that if I want nice things, I'm going to have to pay that kind of upkeep cost.
