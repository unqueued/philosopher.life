title: 2018.11.24 - Wiki Audit: Links

I'm holding off on how I'm going to fix broken links until I understand the goal and the method I want to use to fix it. Another serious problem I need to find a way to handle is just generating links correctly. I have plenty of tiddlers that use a word that isn't linked. I don't have well-formed principles for why something is linked or it's not. [[Letter]]s shouldn't be touched because I'm doing something extremely specific in my linking, but other times I think I've just been lazy or the reference didn't even exist at the time I wrote it.

I am through 2017.06 into 2017.07. [[The Remodeling]] is tagging and editing right now. My grammar is awful (surprise!). I definitely have places that I want to mark, but they aren't really a [[Relic]]. What am I supposed to do? I don't even know what I'm marking for! I'm just moved by it. I'm already halfway into 2017 though. I think it is better to leave this to another [[Audit]] run through.
