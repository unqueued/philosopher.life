I have no idea if this is a true Dalai Llama quote. But I like it no less. It is indeed a depiction of my own short comings.
THU 9:58 PM
Doesn't matter who said it to me (I'm radical about how much I think information should be free, all the way to attribution). It's a fascinating quote.
THU 10:01 PM
I think it doesn't hit the most important aspects of existentialism, but it's a good start.
THU 10:02 PM
I suppose I am conditioned to recognize the source. And thus day in age far to often the source is lost, mis quoted, or some ME thing of the like.
THU 10:03 PM
Some might think the author is actually necessary to interpreting the words. I am not convinced that is the case in all contexts. It is one of my favorite aspects of aphorisms: they tend to be easy to interpret and reason about more universally.
THU 10:05 PM
It's a cool quote. Where'd you dig it up?
THU 10:05 PM
Da face book...
THU 10:06 PM
Cool beans.

Two cannibals are eating a clown. One cannibal turns to the other and says, “Does this taste funny to you?”
THU 10:07 PM
I'm googling Existentialism but I don't know that I am that involved in self awareness to read it more throughly.
THU 10:07 PM
Lol. America has a hard on for serial killers.
THU 10:08 PM
You definitely like existentialist literature.
THU 10:08 PM
The technical, analytic, philosophical discipline makes that literature enjoyable too.
THU 10:10 PM
Agreed on the hard on. It is almost fetishized.
THU 10:10 PM
I heard the phrase restless soul in a song this morning on the way to work. I usually listen to audio book, npr, or no sound. But it's Friday and I wanted to sing. The phrase stuck with me. It is appearant that some. People roam the earth mildly satisfied in their ignorance and dig deep into the ruts of routine.
THU 10:14 PM
I hear ya. Routines are necessary, but only in moderation. You can't grow much if you aren't willing to change. Building routines that help you build more routines and change seems to be one of the goals.
THU 10:16 PM
Friday is a good day to sing. +)
THU 10:16 PM
Another joke:
THU 10:17 PM
What did the cannibal do after dumping his girlfriend?
THU 10:17 PM
Wipe his butt.
THU 10:17 PM
Those all the cannibal jokes I know.
THU 10:18 PM
Speaking of singing!
THU 10:19 PM
What’s the difference between a four year old and a bag of cocaine?
THU 10:19 PM
Eric Clapton would never let a bag of cocaine fall out the window.
THU 10:19 PM
I'm in a dark humor mood tonight. Met my daughter's boyfriend. Hilarious kid.
THU 10:19 PM
That is awesome you enjoyed him! I am afraid I would want to cause harm. I like the butt wipe joke. Took me a split second. Lol
THU 10:21 PM
What did Cinderella say when she got to the ball?
THU 10:24 PM
“Ughhghghggghh”
THU 10:24 PM
Hahaha. Again. Took a sec.
THU 10:25 PM
How bad do you want me to go here?>
THU 10:25 PM
Yo’ mama so unfamiliar with the gym, she calls it [[JRE]].
THU 10:26 PM
I'm literally laughing. Oh, fuck. Jokes are good.
THU 10:26 PM
(This one works better if you say it out loud. It seems to require a certain kind of inflection.)

What do gay horses eat?
THU 10:27 PM
Haaaaaaaay
THU 10:27 PM
Dalai Lama probably loves a good joke too. He likes keepin' it real.
THU 10:28 PM
Haha.
THU 10:28 PM
I was laughing until. I discovered my laptop. Doesn't have a microphone imput!
THU 10:29 PM

Guitars and computers deserve to sit side-by-side. I'm convinced.
THU 10:30 PM
I was in Tokyo getting looked at by a doctor. He said, “You have to stop masturbating.”

I said, “Why?”

He said, “Because I’m trying to examine you”.
THU 10:30 PM
Attempting to run the phone jack to the mic jack on my laptop and then run the Bluetooth on my headphones. So I can record, play, and be mostly cordless without making noise
THU 10:31 PM
Ah. That makes sense.
THU 10:31 PM
=)
THU 10:31 PM
I am glad you are in a good mood! Do you consider this your Friday as well?
THU 10:32 PM
Naw, I have work tomorrow.
THU 10:32 PM
Where do you work at?
THU 10:33 PM
Afterschool ~~teaching~~ babysitting.
THU 10:33 PM
Been a while, but you saw the link to the log of it.
THU 10:34 PM
Will be applying this one: https://www.eff.org/opportunities/jobs/privacy-and-surveillance-activist
THU 10:34 PM
Would be a sick job to land.
THU 10:34 PM
Wow. Indeed that would be awesome! I scanned it quickly. You definitely meet their requirements.
THU 10:36 PM
I can't imagine living in California though.
THU 10:37 PM
Yeah.
THU 10:37 PM
It is the EFF though. There are few institutions I respect. I strongly doubt I'd get the job, but it would be neat. Still, it's an opportunity to at least speak out of my wiki to whoever is in charge of hiring over there.
THU 10:39 PM
Yeah job wise sounds awesome. My buddy at UPS in Louisville has got my resume sent into the hiring manager using a coworker who "has gotten alot of guys hired"
THU 10:41 PM
Woot. =)
THU 10:41 PM
I'm afraid I will actually get it.
THU 10:41 PM
Lil
THU 10:41 PM
Lol
THU 10:41 PM
Well, you can always cross that bridge when you get to it.
THU 10:44 PM
My brain would rather be anxious. I can't control that sumabitch
THU 10:44 PM
Haha
THU 10:44 PM
Yeah, I hear ya.
THU 10:45 PM
I am reading your wiki about after-school.
THU 11:12 PM
You poor soul. Lol.
THU 11:12 PM
I am enjoying this window.
THU 11:12 PM
Neat.
THU 11:13 PM
It's an interesting job.
THU 11:14 PM
It is terribly difficult to find a job that suits a... Restless soul. =)
THU 11:21 PM

THU 11:21 PM
John Boehner (former spear if the house) has joined the board of directors of one of the largest marijuana companies in the US.
THU 11:29 PM
What do you think of that?
THU 11:30 PM
wishful thinking.
THU 11:33 PM
appearently that is old news. last summer.
THU 11:33 PM
prior to canadas nationwide legalization.
THU 11:33 PM
im afraid I am fixated being able to smoke cannabis and my life getting better. or enjoying it more.
THU 11:34 PM
I hear that.
THU 11:35 PM
Even with risks, cannabliss can be medicine, imho.
THU 11:35 PM
i feel like i succesfully self medicated with it for years.
THU 11:52 PM
i dont wanna take valium, kratom, or drink alcohol.
THU 11:52 PM
Preach. I'm in the same boat.
THU 11:52 PM
