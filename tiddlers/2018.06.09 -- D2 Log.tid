Made it to 52, found unique bec-de-corbin, my merc can't even wear it yet. I may be pushing too fast through content. My necro hasn't had a single emergency for quite a while. Mastery and Skellies are maxed. I could do Hell, but the lack of resists alone are a no go. Plus, I want to farm Baal really fucking hard. 

Diablo was much, much easier this time around. I did have to head to town once. Cold mages lived, triple slow #rekt. I love how revives hold aggro so effectively at times, they are exactly who I want tanking. I'm going to be relying upon my p-Gems for quite a while. 

The lightning ghost things are really nasty for me, and I don't have enough in my blind curse to blanket the screen. This is one of those things which feels so crazy different on a well equipped necro.

Lvl 56, need leech on merc badly. I'll be in NM for another 16-18 levels. Clearly, I must work towards getting a sorc ready. That's what matters. She does all the major grinding for gear and runes. The necro is the slow grind to it.

Lvl 60, took down Baal. I'm not able to use my unique bec-de-corbin, which means I only have a third of damage I want on my merc. I'm not spending a socket on this bullshit. I could technically do The Hole. It would be very rough though, and I don't think the risk is worth it. I believe I will run Baal until 72ish, and then I'll grind The Hole, which may be the safest grind in the game for me. The necro can safely run it, and it can drop almost everything in game.
