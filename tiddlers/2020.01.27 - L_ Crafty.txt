I've No More F***s To Give!

[9:43 AM] Sohalia: Here’s a fun little diddy for you
[9:43 AM] Sohalia: It cheers me up when work is being dumb and I just want to laugh
[11:38 AM] h0p3: She has planned to do a video chat with me. Will get there, I assume.
[11:39 AM] h0p3: Writing is an excellent outlet and place to digest. I don't know if I would set an end date or even deadlines either. Seems like a place to go with the flow to some extent.
[11:38 AM] h0p3: How's your day going?
[3:24 PM] h0p3: How's your weekend going?
[3:31 PM] Sohalia: Not too shabby! Had some peeps over yesterday for D&D and it was gewd. No [[K]] and I are just being bums.
[3:31 PM] Sohalia: How about you?
[3:32 PM] h0p3: Sounds like a lot of fun.
[3:33 PM] h0p3: DMV was frustrating for me, but a date, napping, and some chess made it much better.
[3:41 PM] Sohalia: Good good
[3:41 PM] Sohalia: What did you go to the DMV for? a healthy dose of fury?
[3:42 PM] h0p3: Need licenses, need to register vehicles.
[3:42 PM] h0p3: Will be another week, likely.
[3:44 PM] h0p3: How's the writing going?
[4:06 PM] Sohalia: I haven’t gotten a ton done this week, but I did manage to write the backstory for my main character. :smile:
[4:08 PM] Sohalia: I’m also becoming incredibly involved in random craft things... the past few were for Christmas gifts, but this one is a one-off thing I’m trying. No clue if I’ll even like it. :laughing:
[4:09 PM] Sohalia: It’s a recycled clothes rug where you cut the fabric into strips, braid the strips together, form a coil with the long braid, and sew the coil in a circle.
[5:59 PM] h0p3: Ah, nifty.
[2:56 PM] h0p3: If it comes to fruition, I'd like to see it.
[2:56 PM] h0p3: You having a decent Monday?
