title: 2017.08.17 - Pipefitting Log

Chris picked me up. We arrived later, but plenty of time. 

No concrete today! We demoed pipe. Honestly, not much to say. We used a lift and a grinder. I did some driving. Eventually, the riggers came to help us. 

Also, I helped D-Mull do a layout of measurement lines for the supports on A5 at the end of 309. I keep volunteering to work with him. We do actual pipefitting work, and I like picking his brain. I got to rummage through his toolboxes. He has many tools I clearly need and didn't realize I did. We talked about them. It was great learning from him today. 

I got use my radius marker to fabricate a template to draw on the pipes. It was wonderful. 

D-Mull is a libertarian nut. Good fitter though. Militia leader, prepper, and fails to decry nazis. I'm a socialist nut to him, I'm sure. I have no reason to make a militia, but I am prepared to engage in terrifying violence against those who would significantly harm my family. Prepped, yeah, we agree on many aspects of this, I believe. The right-wing insanity, no thank you. I'll keep my left-wing insanity. One of them has to be correct, I am convinced. The left seems the obvious best choice.
