title: 2017.08.08 -- Prompted Introspection Log

!! In what ways do you participate in a social game at work?

* Every conversation means something.
* First impressions matter.
* Appearance matters.
* Being short doesn't help. 

My teachers liked me because they think I'll be someone. I'm given that extra something that other students didn't get because of that. It wasn't just my attitude. They have something to gain by my success. They want me in their social networks.

I am going to find ways to be useful to others. Why? Because I need them to need me because I need to climb at least high enough to bring happiness to my family.

I need to take the opportunity at this job to build a network, to become competent (fake it till you make it), and to understand the landscape. I will build a name for myself. I think Industrial makes by far the best money, has the most interesting work, and is bound to continue. It's the hardest version, and someone with that experience can walk in and do something else because they know it will be easier. 

I want a long-term position at Yates, I believe. I need to impress them if they are going to invite me to work with them again. I need to dissect the anatomy of a thriving company from top to bottom. I need to learn the roles. I need to see the system inside and out. Only then can I hack it. 

What can I do with my boss, David?

I need him to know my goal. I want a long-term position. I need to tell him I'm ready to learn. I need him to personally and professionally like me. I need him to see that I am a valuable asset to him, that I maximize his capital, that he can rely upon me, that I am worth the effort, that it is in his best interest to maximize my success.

Let's wait until next week until we plant that seed. Let's build some rapport, background, context, and then I can show him. It took a while to win Tim over. It may take a while to win David over. I should study what we are doing. I must ask tons of questions. I must read those drawings. I must understand. I will cultivate a relationship with this man.
