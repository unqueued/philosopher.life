Agreed. I wanted to talk so much more about that stuff. ðŸ˜­ I think my professor was afraid my topic was too broad because she urged me to just focus on weaponization.

Have a great day!
OCT 14 9:37 AM
You too! =)
OCT 14 9:38 AM
I have no work today, and it's awesome. Lol.
OCT 14 10:29 AM
YOO! You have extra vidja time!
OCT 14 11:03 AM
Hope you have a wonderful and relaxing day off.
OCT 14 11:03 AM
Oh, I could, lol. I quit over a week ago though.
OCT 14 11:03 AM
Kids and I have work to do in the house and wikis. But, I don't feel crunched for time. I'm sure it will be wonderful.
OCT 14 11:04 AM
OH
OCT 14 11:18 AM
Did something bad happen?
OCT 14 11:19 AM
Nope. It always occurs with me in a game. I eventually see what is left of the hedonic treadmill, and I usually find injustice or a lack of novelty or meaning in it.

In this case, my character was fleshed out to play every role, and all that was left was grinding raids in AQ and Naxx until I had gear that made it viable to PvP with the dozen or so people who actually PvPed on the server. Much rather fight naked or with preset gear options; I want my choices not how much time I sink into it to matter.

Absolutely fascinating game, and it was one of the highlights of my year to play it with [[JRE]].
OCT 14 11:22 AM
My wiki is the vidja game which never ends in the pursuit of justice and novelty though. Trying to dive back in.
OCT 14 11:23 AM
At least you donâ€™t have weekly currency to worry about with your wiki. ðŸ™ƒ itâ€™s a damn part time job. Haha
OCT 14 11:28 AM
Lol. I hear ya.
OCT 14 11:28 AM
I've been there. That is one of the reasons I bot many games.
OCT 14 11:28 AM
Project Ascension was not worth botting, interestingly. 
OCT 14 11:29 AM
The wiki is definitely a part time job though. I write the equivalent of a 100k word novel every 2 months.
OCT 14 11:29 AM
Why you gotta call me out like this? ðŸ˜‚
OCT 14 11:30 AM
Iâ€™m joking. Haha
OCT 14 11:30 AM
Have a great day!
OCT 16 9:29 AM
Heck yeah. [[k0sh3k]] is back. Gwarunteed.
OCT 16 11:56 AM
You hope your day is productive and fun too.
OCT 16 11:57 AM
You have any grades posted now, btw?
OCT 16 11:57 AM
Got a 92 on my old English midterm! And weâ€™re doing Beowulf next
