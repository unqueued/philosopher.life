title: 2019.04.10 - Wiki Review: Edited

* [[Boogerpicking]]
** I adore it.
* [[.i3/config]]
** I have no idea why this was missing. Meh. It's back now!
* [[2019.04.09 - Wiki Audit: Mass Opening]]
** I love this tool. I think it's going to make reading my wiki during Family Time significantly easier, and I assume anyone else reading may find it useful.
* [[The 1000]]
** [[Sphygmus]] told me she used [[Wiki Review]] to catchup. This may be another kind of tool for those who wish to reason about larger blocks of work that may span of months.
* [[2019.04.09 - Afterschool Teaching: Fridge]]
** Edited.
** I'm bringing some tools. Let's hope this goes faster.
* [[2019.04.09 - Prompted Introspection: Handholding First]]
** Edited.
** I'm increasingly a fan of handholding too.
* [[2019.04.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Amazing Start]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.04.09 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Evil Empire]]
** Edited.
** This was fairly blah to me. I don't know if that is a bad thing though. It's important that I only dick-ride where necessary.
* [[2019.04.09 - Wiki Review: Smother]]
** It might be a beast to read, but I hope it a resource we study and reason about. I see a lot of ugly in the world.
* [[2019.04.09 - TDL: Parts]]
** We tested it. It's suspiciously loud from the outside, but it would work for us on the inside. My wife has to make the call.
* [[2019.04.09 - JRE: Mini-Strike]]
** I think I abruptly ended the conversation. I shouldn't have done that. 
* [[2019.04.09 - Killcoin: Karma]]
** This was a fascinating conversation. I'm particularly harsh with those who claim to be Christian.
