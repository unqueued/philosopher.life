Hey! I've been quarantined in my bedroom for the last week and it has been wonderful!!!!! I legitimately have just been sleeping 12-15 hours a day and binge watching dumb TV any time I'm awake. 

I feel a lot better. Which is good bc I'm headed back home and into the thick of it in a week or so. 

How are yall??

Yeah, I've been home in NOLA a few days. I'll be here thru hopefully the end of Oct and then I'm headed back up to Houston for a few weeks until my aunt can come back up from the coast. My aunt and I are trading of weeks sitting with paw paw while mom goes back to work full time.

I'm a kind of tired I didnt even know was possible. My grandpa is far enough along in alzheimer's that he doesnt really speak anymore so I just read or do crossword puzzles when hes settled. The reason we are having to sit with him is that he stands up and tries to walk constantly. So every five minutes or so you have to push him back in the bed. But he has no short term memory so he forgets and stands up again. So it's just hours and hours of arguing with him for him to not try to walk.
