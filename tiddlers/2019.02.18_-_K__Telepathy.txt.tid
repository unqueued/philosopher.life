Morning
MON 8:28 AM
;P
MON 8:28 AM
I think it’s great that you guys have this break down time to talk about what has happened and plans for the next week. :)
MON 8:28 AM
Morning to you too
MON 8:28 AM
Nice timing. Haha
MON 8:28 AM
The "telepathy" mechanic in IMing.
MON 8:29 AM
I'm glad we do it too. Sometimes it's easy and wonderful, and sometimes it is the most draining part of my week.
MON 8:30 AM
Oof
MON 8:36 AM
I feel it though.
MON 8:36 AM
Some days are easier than others just because other obligations aren’t so in the way.
MON 8:37 AM
What you up to today?
MON 8:52 AM
Work and school. [[L]] and I started Buffy the Vampire Slayer last night. :)
MON 9:33 AM
What about you?
MON 9:33 AM
I hope it is excellent for you. I will pray for your souls.
MON 9:52 AM
May the camp be delicious.
MON 9:52 AM
Wait what?
MON 9:53 AM
:skull:
MON 9:53 AM
lol!
MON 9:53 AM
Had to look up “camp” lmao
MON 9:54 AM
[[k0sh3k]] adores the show. I think it's proper braincandy for her.
MON 9:54 AM
I mean Buffy is in some ways.
MON 9:55 AM
I love Buffy. I just want [[L]] to love it too.
MON 9:55 AM
In a lot of ways, it stood as the antithesis to how she grew up viewing women, particularly in terms of modesty and traditional Christian values.
MON 9:55 AM
Aye. I can appreciate the feminist aspects of the show.
MON 9:56 AM
I guess I find Cersei Lannister a more convincing feminist than Daenerys Targaryen or Buffy.
MON 9:57 AM
Buffy's various kinds of powers (including social ones) aren't convincing enough to me, but I adore how they point in the right direction.
MON 9:58 AM
"It could be bunnies" is a meme that gets dropped every 3 days in our house.
MON 9:59 AM
Needs to go in the family meme tiddler.
MON 9:59 AM
Anya gives me life. :joy:
MON 9:59 AM
Also the musical episode is the best one (which is where that game from).
MON 10:00 AM
I agree. The musical episode is among my favorites.
MON 10:00 AM
How does [[k0sh3k]] feel about the reboot?
MON 10:04 AM
For the love of god, I hope she doesn't know about it.
MON 10:04 AM
Googling my worst nightmare right now.
MON 10:04 AM
:P
MON 10:05 AM
Lmao
MON 10:05 AM
There’s not really a lot of info just yet. :woman-shrugging:
MON 10:33 AM
It's possible it might not work out.
MON 10:34 AM
We'll see.
MON 10:34 AM
I am sure we will watch it if and when it comes out.
MON 10:34 AM
I hope it does. Buffy deserves to live on!
MON 11:45 AM
I will pray for more tiddies.
MON 11:46 AM
:joy:
