Anecdote time. Ketamine was the only substance to take me out of my depression. I'm only alive because of that substance. 

If you are using ketamine on a regular basis to treat depression, you probably aren't using it correctly. In my experience, it pulls you out of depression immediately after coming down (or up), and that state lasts for several days. It seems to have weaker effects that last longer too. It buys you a space of time to develop the right habits to keep the wolf of depression off your back. Once a week is heavy usage of ketamine as a medicine. There are people who find it addictive, but most people I've met have no interest in regular use of it. The experience is beyond disorienting, and even for experienced users it can have nightmare phenomenology (a price I'm glad I've paid more than once).

The comparison to opioids is insane. I question the motives of that article. Recall the intellectual property considerations which prevent people from price-gouging with this medicine.

I have access to nearly an unlimited supply of both (although, it's been a long time since I've used them since I've not had the need). Ketamine is a radically different substance. Psilo has a lot in common with LSD and DMT, and I think most people should experience it; it's a good start, but it doesn't solve everything. Ketamine (and other dissociatives), however, is in it's own league, and it helped me with depression where the other psychedelics failed.

I think you should reconsider the risk management issue here. Sometimes medicines will be dangerous but still offer the highest average utility to the patient. Depression can be so severe that these risks are normatively correct.
