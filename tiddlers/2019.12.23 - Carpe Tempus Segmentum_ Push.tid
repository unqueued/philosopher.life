title: 2019.12.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Push

* Woke at 9
* Woke everyone up
* Packing and cleaning
** We only have pillows to sit on for the next few days. It's like a kid's fort in here now.
** Internal measurements on the pod are not 8', found that out with the couch. Sad, but glad we had it while we did.
** Proud of how my son kicked it out.
** We are on schedule. 
* Laundry and suitcases.
* Hit the office. 
** We're all set. All utilities are being turned off (and the technicality is being handled).
** Can slide the keys under and just leave they said. 
** She seemed to want to appear more lenient and trusting given that we've lived here for so long.
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** Someone has removed the rods from my brother's bore gauges and put them back together. Only one j-man even flinched. I hate that he's getting fucked with.
*** This was the tool used to demonstrate the pipe spacing problem with the cop (who just dug in even deeper). My brother casts pearls before swine, and it's costly.
** Despite this, my brother was in good spirits. We laughed several times.
** My brother pointed out that [[AA]] occupies a special place among the people in my life. I'm excited to see her on the trip. 
* Haircut
* Shower
* Stirfry, Butter chicken curry
* //Psych//
* Fell asleep at 9?
