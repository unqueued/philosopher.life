Currently, I write down what I hope to accomplish each day. I readily acknowledge this isn't perfect, but it is a good start. I'm trying to develop good habits. This started out as a tool I used on the weekends. Now, I use it daily. I hope this will be a fundamental tool in my habit formation.

!! Principles:

* Write simple lists.
* Write your To-Do-List for the next day before you go to sleep (it may [[help|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29058942]] you sleep).
* Work on least fun to most fun when possible. Do the hardest lifting first, and as your emotional muscles weaken, your tasks get easier and easier. 
* Don't expect yourself to complete everything. You aren't perfect. Prioritize and triage.
** Eventually, you'll acquire the skill of knowing what you can expect of yourself and improve from there.
* On your [[Wiki Review Log]], compare the previous day's [[Carpe Diem Log]] and [[To-Do-List Log]].
