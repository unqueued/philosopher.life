title: 2020.01.08 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Game

!! Explain how to play your favorite game.

[[2018.04.21 - Prompted Introspection Log: Howto Play My Fav Game]] is about right. Some days I just want to dive into having fun, but I think I already have too much. Life is the game of games for me to play. Is it my favorite though? Sometimes. Usually, it's a subset that I like to play. The word //favorite// is difficult because, at least as far as how I normally see the word wielded, it doesn't capture all of my preferences. Favorites are often overidealized, they are for contexts in which time and resources don't matter, where wisdom is irrelevant to some [[dok]]. It feels like I have to specify the context further for favorite to become pragmatized.

The questions "what gets you out of bed in the morning?", "what ought get you out of bed in the morning?", or "what's worth living for?" are just different from "what do you enjoy the most?" in my book. I don't have a satisfactory answer.
