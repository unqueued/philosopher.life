Hope you have a great day today!
MON 8:40 AM
Morning! =)
MON 9:21 AM
You too.
MON 9:21 AM
I want to send in my cover letter today, unless it needs to be drafted again. Would you mind taking a look at it? https://philosopher.life/#EFF%3A%20Cover%20Letter
MON 9:34 AM
Of course. I’ll be off work in an hour. What kind of feedback would you like?
MON 9:35 AM
The kind that is more than willing to hurt my feelings. I want the job, and I'm almost guaranteed not to get it, imho. This is like a hail mary letter to me.
MON 9:37 AM
You got it dude. :skull:
MON 9:40 AM
lol
MON 9:41 AM
I will give all the feedback!
MON 9:40 AM
Thanks
MON 9:41 AM
Of course. Is it okay if I pull the text into a google doc so I can list out comments and suggestions?
MON 9:44 AM
You do it however works best for you. A lot of the formatting is embedded into the TW. I ask you read it in the TW itself (since that's the medium I'm sending), but write however is comfortable.
MON 9:46 AM
Understood. I’ll write my comments and suggestions separately. o7
MON 9:46 AM
Looking forward to reading it. ^_^
MON 9:47 AM
I have read it. Please allow me a few minutes to proceed and organize my thoughts. :)
MON 10:41 AM
Process***
MON 10:41 AM
I think your wiring style is exceptionally strong first and foremost. I should have known that I wouldn’t need to correct grammar or syntax!

I feel like despite that, there is a possibility that the informal way that you are delivering it might keep you out of the running. If you plan to export the cover letter to a word doc file or something similar I think that will be fine. My experience working with a literary journal like I did last semester taught me that people who try to deliver their cover letters outside of the box are ultimately ignored in favor of others who adhere to more traditional means. 

That being said, it is strongly written and I’m a little bit concerned that the language might be a touch too lofty for the average reader. I just imagine some intern getting ahold of this and not giving you a fair shake because he can’t understand some of the things you are trying to convey. It might be worth it to slightly dumb down the writing. I could read and understand it fine, but I think it’s because of our relationship that I’ve learned how to interpret you better. I’d put some thought into that. 

But overall your passion and credentials ring loud and clear. I’m fully convinced that you would be right for the job.
MON 10:48 AM
Does that feedback help you out? It’s also super organized which is awesome. Forgot to mention that...
MON 10:49 AM
That is indeed the problem I am facing. It's informal yet technical.
MON 10:50 AM
You are probably right that it will take me out of the running.
MON 10:50 AM
I don't know  who is going to read this document.
MON 10:51 AM
That makes it difficult for me to tailor it.
MON 10:51 AM
I think if the right person reviews it, then my issues won’t matter, but I’m not willing to trust that this specific person will do so.
MON 10:51 AM
Exactly. XD
MON 10:51 AM
I think it’s easier to read than other parts of your wiki
MON 10:51 AM
No offense!
MON 10:51 AM
Part of the issue is that I don't have actual credentials or people they know and trust to vouch for me.
MON 10:51 AM
Oh, no, I agree. There are sections of my wiki which only I can read, imho.
MON 10:52 AM
I think your work experience that you included speaks volumes for how capable you are for the position.
MON 10:52 AM
That’s the part that our dear reviewer needs to get to!
MON 10:52 AM
I would encourage [[L]] to read it too and see what she thinks.
MON 10:53 AM
I have. I think she might be busy.
MON 10:53 AM
My original idea was to send two covers letters, lol. One being the standard boiler plate, and the other revealing who I am.
MON 10:54 AM
I think it would be to your benefit to make this work into a standard cover letter format, but encourage the reader to use the link instead in your opening.
MON 10:55 AM
That way both bases are covered.
MON 10:55 AM
The more I looked at it, the more I'm convinced the only reason I have a shot is them taking the informal+technical cover letter seriously in the first place.
MON 10:55 AM
Should I ask who will be reviewing these?
MON 10:56 AM
I can ask anonymously.
MON 10:56 AM
I think that would help!
MON 10:56 AM
I agree [[h0p3]]. That’s the biggest worry for me.
MON 10:56 AM
Now that I’ve seen the other side of reading cover letters I feel like you stand a better chance if you play by the standard convention.
MON 10:57 AM
Alright, so I'm going to keep pressing you.
MON 10:57 AM
(I promise I have put a great deal of thought into it)
MON 10:58 AM
Sure thing! I’ll do my best to respond.
MON 10:58 AM
My writing samples are on my wiki. That means they need a doorway/intro to what it is,  how it relates to them, what it means for this job.
MON 10:59 AM
Part of what makes me qualified just is the wiki, imho.
MON 10:59 AM
From the technical details all the way to what it means to engage in effective hypertext writing.
MON 10:59 AM
I'm looking at the job description and trying to see how I fit it best.
MON 11:00 AM
That's why I think including the link and encouraging it's use would be a good compromise from both sides. :D
MON 11:00 AM
its**
MON 11:00 AM
Well, I'll start working on it.
MON 11:03 AM
I am a nobody to them. In their shoes, I would discard the standard cover letter I would send them.
MON 11:03 AM
I hope my feedback doesn't frustrate you!
MON 11:03 AM
I tried really hard to word it properly. xD
MON 11:03 AM
No. I greatly appreciate it!
MON 11:03 AM
I personally think standard convention is BORING
MON 11:03 AM
I hate that society plays by those rulesa
MON 11:04 AM
You have empathized with the fundamental problem I'm facing.
MON 11:04 AM
rules**
MON 11:04 AM
Which boils down to: the reason I merit this position isn't going to shine in standard convention. I ain't normal enough. =)
MON 11:05 AM
Alright, I appreciate it.
MON 11:06 AM
Fuck normies
MON 11:06 AM
;)
MON 11:06 AM
Will jump into the standard
MON 11:06 AM
I wouldn't scrap what you have right now, I would instead view it as a mega outline.
MON 11:06 AM
You've already done most of the work imo
MON 11:07 AM
Are there sections of the real letter that you think deserve to go in the standard?
MON 11:07 AM
And it should be used :D
MON 11:07 AM
What are*
MON 11:07 AM
Also, rickrolling twice in a cover letter is standard practice, I'm pretty sure.
MON 11:07 AM
Your list of work that applies to the position, a small bio about yourself, and how invested you are in the company.
MON 11:08 AM
You've more or less already written a lot of that :D
MON 11:08 AM
Should the real cover letter be one of my writing samples?
MON 11:12 AM
Make no mistake: most of my writing samples share a great deal of writing style in common with the real cover letter.
MON 11:13 AM
I am going to be judged by it.
MON 11:13 AM
The standard cover letter is simply a trojan horse.
MON 11:13 AM
Where can I find these samples again? xD
MON 11:19 AM
They are in the cover letter. I talk about why I chose those writing samples.
MON 11:20 AM
Oh those samples!
MON 11:20 AM
Gotcha gotcha
MON 11:20 AM
I wanted to be sure that we weren't talking about different ones.
MON 11:22 AM
Yeah, I think including links to those will be a big help in your favor.
MON 11:22 AM
Keeping those should be okay.
MON 11:22 AM
They may only click one or two, but as long as those one or two accurately represent you, that will be beneficial overall!
MON 11:23 AM
There's kind of the problem: the standard cover letter is just to get them to read those links, but those links are the writing style of the real cover letter (excepting my dissertation chapter, but even that is a slog). How long do I wait to tip my hand, to force us to face the music? The real cover letter is a real representation.
MON 11:28 AM
I'm going to write the trojan horse, but I'm not convinced that increases my odds at all.
MON 11:28 AM
My advisors will have to advise me. I obviously don't know enough, lol. As you speak of learning how to decode what I say (and having to get to know me to understand me), I think that is excellent evidence that I'm not fit for the job, lol!
MON 11:29 AM
Thank you, btw. I know offering advice and giving me perspective isn't fun. Your honesty means so much to me. I consider it one of the hallmarks of a deep friendship that we spend our social capital with each other to literally help the other. It's a recurring proof of love.
MON 11:30 AM
I think you are fit for the job!
MON 11:33 AM
It's convincing them that's the hard part
MON 11:34 AM
That's what the job is: being good at convincing people with my writing style, lol.
MON 11:34 AM
Obviously, I can clean it up and modify it. I will attempt the normie tone! =)
MON 11:35 AM
Awesome. I'm on standby to review the new version!
MON 11:36 AM
o7, thank you, sir.

MON 12:24 PM
Normification drafting commenced.
MON 12:26 PM
[[h0p3]] this is GREAT!
MON 1:07 PM
Thank you.
MON 1:08 PM
This is the best possible way you could have transformed your old draft as well as presented your skills with the original
MON 1:08 PM
No problem, this is the best way to go about it, I think.
MON 1:08 PM
I would be interested enough to click the link too.
MON 1:08 PM
Thank you for taking the time to wrestle with me about it. I know I'm not easy to convince. I agree. The trojan horse is correct.
MON 1:09 PM
No problem. This is a good looking cover letter. It's short and sweet, but intriguing enough to draw the reviewer in to look at the nitty gritty of it all.
MON 1:10 PM
Good job
MON 1:10 PM
