title: 2018.07.31 -- Wiki Audit: Connect

Edited {[[Connect]]}. I can see I have more work to do in this domain. My [[Standing TDL]] page is making that even clearer to me. I want to abuse the fuck out of my [[Pin]]. I can see it does something special, a different kind of meta navigation of this wiki.

I want to wake up in the morning with the wiki opened and ready to input all of my logs. I don't want to do anything by hand. 

# Close Browser
# Generate Log .tid files, insert names into parsed Log .tids (lose title.Titles)
# Generate URL of this log, open in browser...
# Voila
# ???
# Profit
