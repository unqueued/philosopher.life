title: 2018.08.13 - Ed: Hi!

Hey Ed,

This letter is out of blue, but approved by your wife. I'm a friend of hers. We sat in Professor Hoag's Ethics class together, although I'm not sure if she remembers we had class together. My wife, [[k0sh3k]], talks often with your wife. I'm [[h0p3]]! It's a pleasure to meet you.

I'm a weird dude, but I heard we might get along. I'd like to get to know you better. You can inspect who I am here: https://philosopher.life/ if it helps. Your wife also has my number for Signal, which is how I chat with her. I don't know how you prefer to connect.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]] (h0p3)
