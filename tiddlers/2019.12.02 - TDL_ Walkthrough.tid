title: 2019.12.02 - TDL: Walkthrough

* Walkthrough/Interview
* Check on money status
** Then just go for the pod, if so. Solves a lot of problems.
* Finally, eat the ribs, dude.
* [[JRE]] sounds bushed. The man is working hard, and his boy is sick. I'm not sure how to be helpful. 
* Wait to shop one more. Take the vehicle in first, then shop right after.
* Sort and box.
* [[Project Ascension]] for [[1uxb0x]] sounds like a fascinating use of his time. There's a ton to think about in there; it would be good practice.
