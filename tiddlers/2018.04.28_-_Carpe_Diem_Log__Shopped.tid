title: 2018.04.28 - Carpe Diem Log: Shopped

* Woke at 9 in my bed.
** I got up in the middle of the night to piss and lay in bed.
** Vivid dream-like state.
* Shopped for several hours
** I helped my daughter, and my wife helped my son. My daughter and I had to take measurements and lookup on our phone. 
** My daughter picked it all out (she was price conscious, which I'm glad); I just offered my assistance. She has to learn to do this on her own. We don't go shopping often, and it's important that she engages in the process herself as much as possible.
** We picked up things that we'd not want from thrift stores: underwear, socks, bath suit, shoes, etc. We had money left over for other things. My daughter ended up being picky on this end (cool), and I helped her scour the area for clothes that seemed to suit her aesthetic. We had the usual redpilled talk. I continue to press the necessity of practicing the art of appearance upon my daughter given our contexts while also pointing out the Kantian and virtue theoretic issues surrounding it.
