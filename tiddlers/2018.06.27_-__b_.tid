I've been called an intentionally obscurantist (could be borrowing my words) Heideggarian. I've been assumed to be Kantian. They didn't mean it as compliments. To be thought of as a confused interpreter of anyone is at least to posit that I'm an interpreter. Even if I can't say it clearly, at least I'm on the right track.

I have to remind myself that DFW also splits people like this. You either really love his work or hate it. DFW both have the fragmentation problem.

The Democrats refuse to do what it takes to defeat the psychopathic Republicans. Unfortunately, that means Democrats are reactionary servants of psychopaths, i.e. psychopaths themselves.
