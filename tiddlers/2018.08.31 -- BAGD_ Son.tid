You have to believe you can do it (even if you can't) to have a shot at succeeding. The edges of what you are capable of achieving are only available to you if you're going to believe you can reach them. Call it placebo, mind-over-matter, or whatever. There's something right about this aspect of autonomy. You have to actually try.

You have to go 80%. You have to force yourself to do it.
