* Stunning!

*** Obviously, fishy too! I am worried about how much time I have left. I do not know when to start joining the fray. I'm NOT ready, but I'm never going to be. Gonna be arrogant-appearing: there is no corpus on the planet like this wiki. It is unique to the point of being esoteric in how it models me. I must be patient. What do I do!? I already need to speak with the experts to know when and how I should speak with the experts. 
**** Will I regret or praise myself later for this move?
*** I still don't understand why people aren't losing their shit over this. What is wrong with me or them?
**** http://approximatelycorrect.com/2019/02/17/openai-trains-language-model-mass-hysteria-ensues
*** It is my guess that Google already has something significantly better than this; we've just never seen it.

*** https://www.sciencealert.com/neural-networks-performance-increases-if-they-re-allowed-to-sleep-and-dream
**** Perhaps the most beautiful part of the whole shebang, and I'm increasingly worried they are sentient. If they are, I am opposed to generating slaves.

*** That sounds too obvious.

*** Yikes! Why am I never skeptical enough?

* Think About It
** https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/arxhv1/chinese_social_credit_mass_surveillance/
*** It is inevitable that we assign trust and social credit in our empirical, [[fff]] strategies of modeling others in dialectics. The whole fucking point of implementing [[The Original Position]] is to do it [[irwartfrr]]. You have to decentralize that accrediting power. Trust virtually begins face-to-face, P2P. You have already lost the war if you cannot build molecules from those dialectical atoms. China Brain begins to say it.
** https://highexistence.com/panpsychism-3-reasons-why-our-world-brimming-sentience/
*** I hear ya, OOO. Look, I need evidence. That is [[The Golden Rule]]. Certainty cannot be achieved either way on the hard problem. I aim to be humble in de-anthropomorphizing [[The Good]] (which internalists find absurd, ofc). I'm fine with the possibility of denying emergentism at some Bob turtle because I simply can't know, and of course, I aim to resoundingly defeat epiphenomenalism as best I can.
*** Obviously, my faith in [[The Good]] has something to say here. Unfortunately, I don't know what it is. I need to talk to an expert.
*** I can't answer the functionalist well enough. Too many things are just game-theoretically evolved in their teleology without being a language user with itself. I don't see awareness

*** I think [[Atropos]] could not come sooner. Of course, no government is going to support it.

** https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-cloud-is-just-someone-elses-computer/
*** I desperately wish we could anonymously put hardware into datacenters. Gonna have to virtualize it over [[Atropos]]. All the other methods fail to decentralize fittingly.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/opinion/esquire-american-boy-cancel-culture.html
*** Right to be forgiven, not forgotten. You are responsible for building [[Atropos]].clone. Indeed. You must own your identities wisely.
** https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-10-accessory-proves-smartphones-are-too-big-11550412000
*** I've only recently seen these since working this job. My case has long had it because I like my stand. It works for me! I don't think it means my phone is too big at all. I don't know how big I want my phone, but I fucking hate my phone.

*** Or...we can blame a hyperclass that has no interest in the truth or enabling others to pursue it. This is a mass education problem that is radically larger than the youtubes.

*** Perhaps.
** https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/02/14/millennial-socialism
*** I must pay attention to my enemies, especially when they attempt to use and model me out loud. Capitalism is an emergent corruption of collective action to centralize power [[irwrongfrr]].
