title: Differential Equation Advice

* Some problems simply have no solution.
* Some problems have no simple solution.
* Some problems have many solutions.
* Determining that a solution exists may be half the work of finding it.
* Solutions that work well locally may blow up when extended too far.
* Boundary conditions are the hard part.
* Something that starts out as a good solution may become a very bad solution.
* You can fool yourself by constructing a solution where one doesnâ€™t exist.
* Expand your possibilities to find a solution, then reduce them to see how good the solution is.
* You can sometimes do what sounds impossible by reframing your problem.
