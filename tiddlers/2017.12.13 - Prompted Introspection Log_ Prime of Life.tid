title: 2017.12.13 - Prompted Introspection Log: Prime of Life

!! What age would you consider the prime of life? Why?

By prime of life, I take you to mean "the best years of one's life." This is obviously contextual. It depends on your era, geography, sociopolitical status, and a host of particularities. Samwise, are you retarded? What kind of overgeneralized question is this? Are you just fishing for me to say 'my current moment will always be the prime of life for me'? Seems like it.

The best years of your life for whom? Yourself, right? I think prime slavery ages are easier to settle, of course. Back to the matter at hand, why should we think the prime of your life lasts for years?
 Take the sequential chunk of time with the highest average utility, and you've got it. For most, if not all, the prime might not even be years; it could literally just be minutes. Oh, you don't like that, you fucktard? Fine, artificially grant us limits, apply the utility rule, done. 

Yes, my Tolkientard, even the Good Life, Eudaimonia itself, must ultimately be quantifiably reducible to some utilitarian expression. Virtue Theory can never escape consequentialism and teleology; it's the only meaningful normative foundation upon which it can stand.
