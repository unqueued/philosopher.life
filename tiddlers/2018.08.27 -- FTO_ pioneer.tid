Participating in this thing. It's clear that the initial reviewers do not hold my work in higher regard. I dropped from among the highest placed contestants (from the quant IQ score) down to 900? Lol. They likely find it useless, and if they looked, I think they'd realize they can't monetize what I'm doing (since it's purposely copyleft to the extreme). 

Apparently, some people did like what I was doing though. We'll see how that goes. Maybe someone will reach out to me after this thing is over? I don't know.

Comments from today:

* "I admire your self-reflection!"
* "This idea of radical transparency is very close to my heart as an artist much of what you do is show your mind to the world. "
* "I try to document myself a lot and I'm curious about the results when you take it to the extreme "
* "Has a project"
* "Wow, there's a serious attention to transparency with your project that I'm sure extends through your life. All your content is compelling."
* "Super interesting project!"
* "Applicant A might be the unibomber without (I hope) the violence."

ROFL

Btw, [[Invisign]] looks useful here. Le secret message passing.
