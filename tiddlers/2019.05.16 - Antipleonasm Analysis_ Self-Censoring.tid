title: 2019.05.16 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Self-Censoring

!! Respond to the following gem:

I don't say you're self-censoring - I'm sure you believe everything you're saying; but what I'm saying is, if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.

The human brain is extremely effective at both protecting itself from truths that would hurt it and egoistically adapting to structures in the world. This is why I don't trust the emotions of almost anyone I meet; they aren't morally virtuously trained emotions. People are excellent at lying to themselves, confabulating narratives, putting things out of sight and out of mind, conveniently forgetting, and being directed by what feels [[good]] rather than doing what is [[right]]. I think most humans are garbage; it's true. I have been fortunate enough to meet examples of those who merit living their lives, and we must aim to become virtuous agents like them.

So, of course, plenty of people in power believe what they are saying, see themselves as the heroes of their own stories, hold tremendous bias, and don't even attempt to overcome it. It is extremely rare for me to find humans who aim for accountability and integrity all the way down. Nobody wants to admit that portions of their lives have been invalid through their own choices or the choices of others (and, of course, we can empathize with that to a large extent, especially with victims). People will generally slip into anti-realism before accepting the reality of their own invalidity.

It's crucial to see that people do construct large portions of who they are. We have freewill. People choose to shape themselves into who they are to a non-trivial [[dok]]. We do "censor" our thoughts and self-shaping. We select our [[FO]] desires with [[SO]] desires. We habituate our dispositions. 

It's also crucial to see that how we fit into the world is largely a result of the choices of others (and primarily an elite percentage of the human population). Capitalism's centrality of power sifts with the efficiency of a collective psychopath for those who have defined and habituated themselves in a manner which supports the elite at the top. Psychopathy is the primary trickle-down effect in perfect competition.
