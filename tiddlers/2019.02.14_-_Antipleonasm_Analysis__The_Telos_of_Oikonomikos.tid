!! Respond to the following gem:

Economics in the 20th century “lost the desire to articulate its goals”. It aspired to be a science of human behaviour: a science based on a deeply flawed portrait of humanity. The dominant model – “rational economic man”, self-interested, isolated, calculating – says more about the nature of economists than it does about other humans. The loss of an explicit objective allowed the discipline to be captured by a proxy goal: endless growth.

Indeed, psychopathy rates are higher than average among economists. It is no accident they seek the means to whatever arbitrary ends they selfishly select. That doesn't mean their portraits are entirely wrong, but the motivation and Overton windows they generate have an obvious egoistic bias that never aims to prescribe anything beyond selfishness. They get paid handsomely to think inside that one particular box. Losing the desire to articulate [[The End]] beyond some subjective preference is quite convenient.

The proxy goal is really just an intermediate end, which is just to say: it is a means. But, it is a means to what? Insofar as those in power can refrain from giving a soup-to-nuts explanation and justification of metaphysics, metaethics, and the material dialectical implementation (for which we could hold them accountable), they can quietly choose where that growth is directed and who benefits from it. Some trickle-down rhetoric, effective ~~altruists~~ reactionaries, misdirecting otherization, and transnationally-generated double-standards which allow them to skirt the rule of law provide all the cover necessary to fight for endless power for power's sake.

Indeed, once you start to articulate [[The Moral Law]] in any of the standard moral theories, the contrast makes it is obvious that economics as a dismal science in the 20th and 21st centuries have sought accurate models only insofar as those in power benefit from the modeling as the unarticulated goal. That lost desire is a realpolitik sleight of hand.
