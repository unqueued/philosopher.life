After doing //Life of Fred// with you, and teaching while I'm happy and not depressed, I can see that I have held you to extremely high standards. I've not been fair to you. I've expressed disappointment when I never should have. You are smart. You are good. You make mistakes, and you pick yourself back up. You do work hard. I know you do your best.

I want you to know I expect great things of you because I know you are capable of them. I also know I've made huge mistakes in how I push you to grow. I'm not a good parent. I am sorry. I am doing my best, but that doesn't make it good enough.
