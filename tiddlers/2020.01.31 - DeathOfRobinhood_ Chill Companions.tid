Just hangin' with this good girl
Jan 31 10:55pm
:o. Neat. Is she your doggo?
Jan 31 10:55pm
Not quite. Spiritually maybe? We got her a couple years back from a foster home after she'd been rescued from a mill. Between three of friends, she's probably with me the least, but I take care of her at least a few times a year.
Jan 31 10:58pm
She's ooold but a sweetie
Jan 31 10:58pm
Gonna go out for a before bed pee
Jan 31 10:59pm
That is interesting. It's not common for people to share a pet like that.
Jan 31 11:02pm
I think I prefer older dogs more; they tend to be more mellow.
Jan 31 11:02pm
Yeah. She's the chillest.
Jan 31 11:20pm
You have/had any animal companions?

Cool

I'd be okay without pets, but my wife would not be. I'm glad we have them though.

That's good of you to accommodate your wife's desire for pets :)

I always liked animals, but my mom had had a dog before and was so devastated by its death that she never wanted any other pets to get attached to.

A couple years ago, God gave her a dog which has been a huge blessing to her

Some days, my wife has no more fucks to give, except with her cats. Cats have been exceptionally important in her life.
Feb 1 2:48pm
One stands out in particular to me. Her early life was difficult. After realizing her biological father was a rapist, and after a miscarriage, her sister and brother-in-law drove across the country (Arizona) to pick her up and bring her back to Virginia. She was so depressed that she just wouldn't get out of bed, and didn't have much light in her world. It was her cat (I believe the cat's name was Shadow) who would just lay there with her day and night. I am lucky and grateful for Shadow's existence. I don't think my wife would be here without the help of this animal.

I'm not sure what to do with that attachment-suffering problem. It makes sense to me on either side sometimes. I'm very glad that your mom has a dog too. It's important to have company. We are not meant to be alone. Dogs are exceptionally good in that respect.
Feb 1 2:54pm
Thank you for that insight into [[k0sh3k]]'s life. Shadow seems an exceptionally apt name for that which accompanied her through the night.
