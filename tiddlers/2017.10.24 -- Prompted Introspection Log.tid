title: 2017.10.24 -- Prompted Introspection Log

!! Why is the [[Yearly Audit Log]] taking so long? Why aren't you smashing it?

Samwise, I think you aren't being fair to me. I've been planning it for quite a while. This is merely the end of October. If anything, I'm early in the endeavor. I'm still working out the kinks, and this is my first time. I'm still developing my vision, and I don't think I'm being lazy. 

Let me agree to this point though, I'm not spending enough time. If this is what you mean by //smashing it//, then you have a fair point. I'm not obsessed enough with it. This is my video game, and I need to play it hard. I should give up D2 to concentrate on this. I have a lot I need to accomplish before the next job. This is the most important project. I must not forget that, and I need to act on that belief.
