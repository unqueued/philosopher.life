<<<
one of the main maxims of category theory is that a mathematical object is completely determined by its relationships to all other objects. To put it another way, two objects are essentially indistinguishable if and only if they relate to every object in the category in the same way
<<<

Are properties considered relationships? If so, then this seems to be a discussion of the semantics of everything. Does category theory point to the universal context of all particular contexts: [[The Good]]? 

[[Sir Oliver Sensen]] never cared for my worry that the logical truth of [[The Categorical Imperative]] makes it semantically equivalent to all other logical truths as far as we can know. I understand how this is bothersome because it appears most logical truths aren't [[Salient]] enough to [[The Right]]. His argument was that the content of [[The Moral Law]] is different from logical [[Truth]] itself. 
 But, we aren't in a position to say otherwise, right?

All logical truths are logical consequences of all other logical truths, and therefore, it is a logical truth that all logical truths are logically equivalent. Even this is part of that giant ball of [[The Truth]]. 

The only thing which can peel [[The Salience]] out of [[The Salience]] is [[The Salience]] [[Itself]], right? How can I, an [[fff]] mind, possibly make sense of such a transcendently unified [[Thing]]?

I took an extensive evening nap today. My wife kindly allows me to just fall asleep in her lap while she watches TV. Like walking with her, sleeping with her is one of the highlights of my day. She doesn't have the same interest in doing so with me. Is this a mistake on my part?

I dreamt of something important to say in the wiki, but it disappeared too quickly in the fog of waking up. Now, I doubt I had anything valuable at all. Either I didn't, and that means I'm not wasting my time, or I did, and that means my brain is actually doing work while I sleep (hopefully training itself?). I have no idea. Sleep is something I simply don't understand though I clearly need more of it.
