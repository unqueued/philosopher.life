It drives me insane that you think we deserved to be poor. You really taught us to hate ourselves, and that's in part because you didn't empathize with yourselves. You are rationalizing on purpose. Your brain, these decades later, is confabulating to protect itself; and, you may accuse me of the same (note, however, I have this vindicating mirror). You are trying to protect yourself from the regret of not having recognized it earlier; the mistakes you have made are huge in that respect.
