* I didn't write [[AIR]], although it appears completely unnecessary. My other gut instinct that I wouldn't really have any serious time with him was accurate.
* I did take my trip.
* I did not visit the hall, but it's at the point that if I signed the book, I'd have to turn it out down and sign it again.
* I did a good job encouraging my children. I'm actually proud of myself and them in this respect.
