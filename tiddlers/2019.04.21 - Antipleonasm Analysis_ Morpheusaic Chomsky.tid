!! Respond to the following gem:

Naturally, any conqueror is going to play one group against another. For example, I think about 90% of the forces that the British used to control India were Indians. [...] It was true when the American forces conquered the Philippines, killing a couple hundred thousand people. They were being helped by Philippine tribes, exploiting conflicts among local groups. There were plenty who were going to side with the conquerors. But forget the Third World, just take a look at the Nazi conquest of nice, civilized Western Europe, places like Belgium and Holland and France. Who was rounding up the Jews? Local people, often. In France they were rounding them up faster than the Nazis could handle them. The Nazis also used Jews to control Jews. If the United States was conquered by the Russians, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Elliott Abrams and the rest of them would probably be working for the invaders, sending people off to concentration camps. They're the right personality types.

Capitalists use reactionaries to control the rest of the proletariat. Reactionaries come in various [[dok]], of course. I find few who are unblemished here (including myself). The dialectic between the reactionaries and the rest of the proletariat is materially sublated by the elite. Unification of the two-ish misdirected groups could form a dialectical whole against the elite, and if automation isn't too powerful, there is a reasonable chance the proletariat could successfully revolt. I do not predict it, of course.

I am reminded of [[The Matrix]]:

Morpheus: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. [Neo's attention is drawn to a passing attractive woman wearing a red dress] Were you listening to me, Neo, or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?

It's fascinating to see different parts of the movie scream louder and softer to me over the years. This paranoic quote only seems to get louder for me.
