title: 2019.10.13 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Strange

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Here is an old phrase I like: “The only way to the universal good is that we all become strangers to ourselves.” You imagine looking at yourself with a foreign gaze, through foreign eyes. I think this is something that could be the greatest thing in humanity. You are never really limited just to your own perspective. I don’t like the false identity politics of multiculturalism which says that “you are enclosed in your culture.” No, we have all this amazing capacity to be surprised, not by others, but by ourselves seeing how what we are doing is strange.

The old phrase is a goldmine, but not for the reason you've stated. I agree that alienating, otherizing, empathizing with, and transcending a version of yourself is what we're doing in the acquisition of knowledge, in changing who we are, in becoming the next stage of our being. Deanthropocentrifying one's perspective has its limits, and ego death can never be complete. It is certainly a necessary condition for being a moral agent, the greatest thing in [[Humanity]]. There is no philosophy without it. However, this is not simply the pursuit of the strange. Daseinic self-awareness of [[The Telos]] and our relationships over time to it in both instrumental and categorical reasoning is the strangeness which matters here.
