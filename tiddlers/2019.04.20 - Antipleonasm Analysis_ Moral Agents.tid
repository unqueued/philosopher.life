!! Respond to the following gem:

I don't know if it's a hundred years, but it seems to me if history continues—that's not at all obvious, that it will—but if society continues to develop without catastrophe on something like the course that you can sort of see over time, I wouldn't be in the least surprised if it moves toward vegetarianism and protection of animal rights. In fact, what we've seen over the years—and it's hard to be optimistic in the twentieth century, which is one of the worst centuries in human history in terms of atrocities and terror and so on—but still, over the years, including the twentieth century, there is a widening of the moral realm, bringing in broader and broader domains of individuals who are regarded as moral agents.

Variants of Object-Oriented Ontology, advances in exploring the psychology of animals, a focus on utilitarianism, and progressive virtue-signaling seem to be some of the largest factors. Note, of course, that one can broaden the Walzerian spheres of justice to include higher animals without radical moves toward vegetarianism or even extensive animal right. The weird move here is at the end, where it's not clear to me that respecting moral agency and broadening those definitions have what may be significant conceptual links implied in the quote.  

Of course, I want a balanced, safe ecology, lab grown-meat, and respecting moral agency.
