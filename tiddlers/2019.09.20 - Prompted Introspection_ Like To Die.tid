title: 2019.09.20 - Prompted Introspection: Like To Die

!! How would you like to die?

I answered this one a long time ago: [[2017.05.24 - Prompted Introspection Log]] (or so it feels). Yeah, going out not only in a painless but a blissful fashion is my preference. But, I suppose that's what I'd generally like for most of my living too. This is not my prediction, but it would be amazing. Dying is pretty traumatic; it's meant to be painful. Our body structures and processes have been selected for their ability to signal something is wrong just on the chance there is something we can do about it. We weren't born to die though; nature hasn't historically been able to give much a shit about that part (though it appears that is temporarily changing). I'm so ready for not existing anymore, but I am not looking forward to that pain at all. I'm a pansy.
