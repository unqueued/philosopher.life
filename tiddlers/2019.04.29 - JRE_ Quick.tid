My bro called me back after his shower. He's trying to stay awake. He found out his T is low. We joked around some.

He put up a rack for his wood on the concrete wall. It looks outstanding.

We talked about GoT. He's watching from S3 onward at the same time. We also talked about BB; I'm surprised he didn't finish that show. He said it was too dark for him. Something is unreliable about my indicator with him because a show like [[Sharp Objects]] is insanely dark, but IASIP or BB not so much. I don't understand, but that's normal.

Greyhound won't allow my son to go, and they are supposed to be accompanied by an adult. We'll meet halfway. He offered 1 week and a second optional (he'll work during that). I think they will have a blast, and it will be good for them to see how it's done outside our house.
