!! Audit:

* I need to continue going to bed as early as I can, taking naps, and getting as much sleep as I need. I'm still way off.
* Yet again, not much commentary or thought in here. I am, however, grateful for what I have, and I'm glad to accomplish what I do.
* I did lay off it more than usual, and my wife is exceptionally generous as well.
* I'm disappointed to see how many of them are incomplete.
** Cmon, dude. You can do better.
* I've been sick this month. It's clear. Something is off with my body's temperature regulation, and my gut isn't right. 
* I've simply not walked and talked enough with my wife.
* Been in a rice and beans mood.
* I don't think you are calling enough people up (though, ofc, they could call you, lol). 
* Of note, I've been shitting less. I do not know why.
* Drinking appears up.
