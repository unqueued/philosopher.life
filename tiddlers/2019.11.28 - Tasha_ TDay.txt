Will be able to see my uncle-in-law (<3) on Saturday, so I'm very excited about that.

How about you folks?

Right on! Well Iâ€™m home this year so Iâ€™ll be cooking a feast for these boys! They have put a lot of thought into all the dishes they want to over stuff ourselves with ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m glad though itâ€™s going to take a lot of work but Iâ€™m grateful I get to be home this year! Very happy now that Iâ€™m out of my friends house/job. Sounds like itâ€™s a good time with the uncle in law!

Dec 1, 2019 2:17pm
Lol. That sucks. [[k0sh3k]] is allergic too. I forget what part she is allergic to, maybe aluminum? I don't know. 
Dec 1, 2019 2:17pm

Dec 1, 2019 2:18pm
Hopefully you can lay back with your arms "up" ... I hope it heals fast. Uh, [[k0sh3k]]'s took a couple days to heal.
Dec 1, 2019 2:18pm
Yea itâ€™s possibly the baking soda cause we switched to aluminum free after the cancer article on deodorant with aluminum
