!! Audit:

* I think I'd actually have to try another kernel. I think that's such a pain in the ass, I'm not going to do it unless I'm forced. That sucks because I really love VMWare's performance.
* This is the first time I've ever loved having Lutris. It worked nicely.
* It appears bypassing my ISP's DNS servers helps me a fuckton. Packetloss is gone when I do that. 
* I've clearly tried to get back into gaming, but it's just not catchy to me. I clearly love the wiki. =)
* I need a new router. 
* We had no emergencies, though there were some frustrations.
* I presume I'm going to stop giving a shit about
* I've been feeling the pressure in my RAM a lot lately. There's not much I can do about it at the moment. I do hope to eventually move up to 128GB of RAM on a server.
* I've been looking at routers; I'm pretty set on OpenWRT. My previous was hacked together, and I never got to really make use of the package manager. That's really what we need.
