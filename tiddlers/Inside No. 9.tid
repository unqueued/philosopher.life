title: Inside No. 9

Shakespeare would approve. Dark, dry, and the cringe is so hard we have to pause the show to recover and remind ourselves it isn't real. STAHPSDFL:ISDF:LJKSD omg. The Freudian slips are fucking killing me. The show is bloody dreadful. I lurv it. The sexual tension only has a humorous release. That's the only way I fuck: like a total clown. The show helps me remember why I'm so afraid of intimacy. It stabs me over and over again. I'll never keep my butthole clean enough for them. Hate almost everyone, cool.

Perfect ending.

Elegantly moronic: pure art. Gorgeous song, ofc. If something can go wrong, it does. Love how they don't take the whole painting with frame. I'm a kid watching Pantomimed Pink Panther. Dogthrow is best. Hypocrisy is lit. I'm slapping my stick to this. Painful giggles. The show is normal. Onions and nobody wins. This is anglophilic IASIP justice.

Perfect ending again.

Oof. This one hits home. Talking to a fellow human makes me feel like I exist. Schizophrenic M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist. Aesops mindfuck-fables. Predictable but still wonderful.

The commodification of pain and suffering. All staged. This is satire. It's a critique of our darkened and dark-triadic existence. Oh, the [[Humanity]].

This is exactly what I think of actors (sorry, love, but there's a reason you couldn't be an actor).

Occult. Hitchcock.

I bet she does have good tits.

Good, and I'm glad it is short.

I can't put my finger on what this anthology reminds me of. Pan's Labyrinth here. Not coherent.
