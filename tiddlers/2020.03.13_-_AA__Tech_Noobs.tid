How's your week going?
Mar 13 1:15pm
Well they are closing schools and doing online learning for at least 2 weeks....and then Spring break
Mar 13 1:19pm
For an introverted tech person â€”thats not too bad
Mar 13 1:20pm
Haha. That is outstanding.
Mar 13 1:21pm
I am happy for you. I hope it will be a good time to charge batteries.
Mar 13 1:21pm
(though, obviously, that schools have to be shut down is not outstanding)
Mar 13 1:21pm
My stress will be helping the tech noobs
Mar 13 1:21pm
Lawd.
Mar 13 1:21pm
Sorry.
Mar 13 1:21pm
Itâ€™s all good
Mar 13 1:22pm
At least my college classes are being helpful
Mar 13 1:22pm
Ah, yeah. Cool part is that those classes shouldn't be effected much. Business as usual there. Are you enjoying those classes?
Mar 13 1:23pm
I am â€”they arenâ€™t effected much but many of the teachers are working to help others do online learning as is the instructor...so she is being understanding
Mar 13 1:24pm
Colleges are going to online too
Mar 13 1:25pm
ðŸ˜¥ whew
Mar 13 1:25pm
It might be the first time in human history that societies could make such a transition.
Mar 13 1:25pm
Thatâ€™s true
Mar 13 1:26pm
How are [[AG]] and [[UJ]] doing?
Mar 13 1:26pm
They are doing ok
Mar 13 1:26pm
The county schools are not sure how this will look because the governor keeps changing but it will work out
Mar 13 1:27pm
Hey nice hair/beard cut
Mar 13 1:27pm
ðŸ˜Š
Mar 13 1:27pm
Lol. Trying not to be carrier if I can help it.
Mar 13 1:33pm
[[1uxb0x]] did the shave.
Mar 13 1:33pm
Nice!
Mar 13 1:33pm
I am glad they are doing okay. Hopefully, the governor's plans won't make [[UJ]]'s life too difficult.
Mar 13 1:33pm
I told Gpa to stay home...he isnâ€™t likely to take my advice but I tried
Mar 13 1:34pm
It is good for him that he is as healthy and fit as he is at his age.
