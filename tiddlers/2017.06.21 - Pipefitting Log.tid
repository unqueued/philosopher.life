title: 2017.06.21 - Pipefitting Log

Today was fairly different from the usual. When we got there, I heard that we would be cleaning the pipeyard. That's exactly what we did. It took a while. It looks better, but it is still a bunch of piles. Hopefully, we won't have to do it again. I'm thinking we had to clean because it is approaching July 1st, which is the beginning of the fiscal year for the school. Thus, my teacher will have an influx of money. He doesn't seem very good with money, and I'm betting he already knows how he's going to spend large chunks. He's told me a couple of the things he wants to buy so far. Assuming that money is already spent, burning a hole in his future pocket, I can see why he wanted the pipeyard cleaned up.

As part of our cleaning, we had to use the oxyacetylene cutting torch to break down some 14"+ carbon steel pipe for recycling. I got some more practice in. I'm always the first in the class to do something. This is often because I want to make sure I get my hands dirty, but it is also when the others don't feel confident. That art piece for names on a plate, I'm thinking about doing it. I was able to cut an "M" just fine freehand. I need to find some fonts, make some stencils, and do it. My cutting is looking a lot smoother this time around. I get myself comfortable, and I "draw" with it. 

I also cut 4 more alignment dog slabs. The teacher saw me doing it, and for the second time in two days, he asked me what I was doing. I explained. He said they should be taller. I asked why. He said because they can break (enormous pressure on these sometimes). He said he would show me his. Eventually he was able to get them out of another instructor's office (who was on vacation). He showed me them. They are half an inch taller than mine, but mine are over half an inch thicker steel plate than his. Lol. If his were fine, I think mine are going to be just fine as well. Frankly, the welds look more likely to break/bend than the carbon steel, and that's even accounting for the fact that the welds are stronger metal than the plate. So, in total, I expect to have 8 alignment dogs. I think they'll be pretty and effective. I'm going to build a few hundred dollars with of tools in the shop. Why not?

I helped both JR and Matt today with their screwpipe projects. Matt had the dominoes effect problem. It was a very simple spool, and I quickly fixed it for/with him. JR needed some counterweight, and he also failed to listen to me on the flange. I told him to tighten it more. He didn't. The teacher checked and the flange made it too long. I keep telling these guys to check their lengths before they ask the teacher to check. They know he's going to do it. Why not nip it in the bud first?

The teacher pulled us all together to show us a jackstand that Chris or Luke had put up on our spool. It was completely extended, and thus it wasn't stable. We fixed it.

We moved onto finishing our 1.5" spool (the first one). One of the flanges wasn't perfect, and the teacher could see it. It may have been that we didn't tighten the bolts enough. We'll see. It was generally level and plumb though. It went on without a hitch. The teacher came by and said, "I guess you are field welding," since we didn't put a flange on the last valve. He said this was actually a good idea in the field anyways, and that we should make our next piece just a tad longer so that we could cut it to fit. He said that cushion can be useful. It sounds to me like he's talking about stovepiping in a minor degree. Ha! That said, I think this is completely reasonable. To my eyes, you do as much of the math as you possibly can, and when the rubber meets the road, that's when you pull your bag of stovepiping tricks out. We constantly do it with our slip-on flanges (which even the book suggests).

As I was worried before, the teacher did notice that pipe that wasn't level on our second 2" buttweld spool. He said that when we field weld our next spool to cut the tacks, adjust it, and retack it. He said to do it on the pipes on both sides of the valve to make sure. 

I asked him if we were going to do screwpipe for the last. He said yes, and that we were going to take a picture of our work. I was right.

At the end of day, I called TEC for Wes. They said Wes doesn't answer on that phone, but they gave me his mobile (why?). Wes answered and he said he didn't have work for me. He gave me another number of a guy at Thompson. I've already applied to Thompson, but I will call the guy tomorrow. /fingers crossed. I found a sprinkler fitter position on CL. I think it will pay very poorly, but work is work, eh? I'll apply asap.
