title: 2018.08.05 -- KMEC: Autism

I recall in Thailand a family with an autistic son. You thought it was a good idea that they hid it. I think you were trying to convince us to do the same. I also think you did the same with me as much as you could. I am kind of shocked that someone with a Masters Degree in "Counseling" clearly knows jackshit about autism. You really didn't try to understand or solve it. Let me remind you, my youngest brother didn't learn to read until he was 13. You really didn't give a shit, and it's clear you still don't. Proud dark triads, imho.
