title: 2018.08.13 -- Prompted Introspection: Last Lie

!! When was the last time you lied and why.

I have never lied.   <---NAILED IT!

Why?...because I thought it would be funny.

Alright, actually the problem of lying is a very difficult one. Deceiving others is treating them as mere means. They are computers we aim to manipulate through falsely crafted information sets and behaviors. This is a failure to respect their dignity, their autonomy, their reason, their personhood (Humanity in this case). 

Manipulation is a very complex topic. I think wearing makeup, clothes, and signaling are forms of manipulation. What exactly are we manipulating? Whom? When is it wrong? Obviously, even deception through omission is something that I would consider to be in the same league. Do you really think lying is when we boldly contradict what we know to be otherwise? Ah, even that is trickier than you might initially suspect. 

I think my lies begin and end with how I talk to myself. Even when I lie to others, I must first lie to myself to accomplish it, imho. I wrong myself in wronging others. There's plenty wrong with how I talk to myself, but I'm trying to fix it. That's one of the wonderful things about using a wiki.
