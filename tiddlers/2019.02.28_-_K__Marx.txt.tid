Morning, [[K]]. =)
THU 8:20 AM
Morning! Have a good day!
THU 8:45 AM
You too.
THU 8:57 AM
What you up to today?
THU 8:57 AM
Work and class. Haha. And you?
THU 9:15 AM
Same. =)
THU 9:18 AM
What you covering in your theory class now?
THU 9:19 AM
We’re moving into Karl Marx!
THU 9:52 AM
And his views on capitalism and capitalist readings.
THU 9:52 AM
/dance
THU 9:53 AM
Are you guys covering Hegel first?
THU 9:54 AM
(You can't understand what Aristotle is saying without understanding how he is replying to Plato. The same problem is found in Marx.)
THU 9:54 AM
We kinda had an overview of the way that capitalism works in regards to society.
THU 9:55 AM
I’m not sure where its heading today.
THU 9:55 AM
Well, I hope it will be a solid introduction. I can see why that would be in a theory class.
THU 9:57 AM
(I'm not sure how capitalism works in regards to anything other than society, even if it affects more than people.)
THU 9:58 AM
How about your other classes?
THU 9:59 AM
Started a new book in American lit. It’s a book. Native American religion is currently focused on healers and diseases and my Greek mythology class finally got to some female deities.
THU 10:00 AM
Lol. It's a book.
THU 10:01 AM
You are not loving that class.
THU 10:01 AM
Greeks, 2 Americans, and the relationship between modern and postmodern theories.
THU 10:02 AM
Honestly I love my American lit class, but the books have been hit or miss for me.
THU 10:02 AM
Your semester needs a punchline.
THU 10:02 AM
My two humanities classes have been VERY disappointing. :(
THU 10:02 AM
It does. XD
THU 10:02 AM
Uh, I'm slow: those all sound like humanities classes to me.
THU 10:03 AM
No worries. I didn’t clarify.
THU 10:03 AM
American lit and theory are both core English classes.
THU 10:04 AM
What makes the non-English humanities classes so disappointing?
THU 10:05 AM
My Native American religion class is brain dead simple and doesn’t really reward studying outside of class. There are also guys in the back that whisper the whole fucking time.
THU 10:06 AM
It’s just an easy class and I’m getting nothing out of it.
THU 10:06 AM
Greek myth has really cool material, but my professor is so laid back that it lacks proper engagement.
THU 10:07 AM
We’re basically just listening to stories about the gods.
THU 10:07 AM
Theory sounds far more challenging.
THU 10:07 AM
American lit has an engaging teacher and the material is presented in a way where it’s all interesting and the focus of the class really helps which is analyzing hybridity in text.
THU 10:08 AM
Theory is definitely challenging.
THU 10:08 AM
I can tell that she’s super smart and really understand the material, but she doesn’t sugar coat anything.
THU 10:08 AM
Understands*
THU 10:08 AM
So a lot of times it’s confusing.
THU 10:09 AM
Hm.
THU 10:09 AM
She’s also kinda blunt, so she gets annoyed easily which makes some classes interesting. Haha
THU 10:10 AM
If we’re not getting it, she gets worked up quickly while she tries to reexplain it.
THU 10:11 AM
I like her.
THU 10:11 AM
Hahaha
THU 10:12 AM
I do too
THU 10:12 AM
This is an aside, but I'm interested in the way you said that. Some thing can't be packaged up nicely. It is in the dialectical wrestling that you come to understand it. It's the process, the experience that you can't just teach in bite-size, easy-to-swallow sequences. It's being lost in the desert and learning how to survive. You cannot sugar coat struggles with meaninglessness without deceptively defeating the purpose.
THU 10:13 AM
I'm reminded of this too: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar
THU 10:14 AM
There are limits to it.
THU 10:14 AM
She’s also one of the prettier professors I’ve ever had. I have a feeling that she doesn’t want to be the “hot teacher” so she steers into the “I’m stern and strict” mentality so she’ll be taken seriously.
THU 10:15 AM
Does that make sense?
THU 10:15 AM
More seriously***
THU 10:15 AM
lol
THU 10:15 AM
She just kinda gives off that vibe to me.
THU 10:15 AM
She very much seems like a hard ass, because my study group talked about how stern she would be during office hours.
THU 10:17 AM
And yet. I’ve almost had perfect scores on the material so far.
THU 10:18 AM
Congratz! =)
THU 10:18 AM
I don't think that hardass assproaches to classroom dialectics need be linked to fairness in grading procedures.
THU 10:19 AM
I think I’m trying to say that there’s a dissonance between personality and grading.
THU 10:20 AM
Or I’m completely misreading her.
THU 10:20 AM
My other professors are pretty spot on with a correlation between teaching style and grading.
THU 10:21 AM
It's been a while for me, I guess.
THU 10:23 AM
Off topic. My theory class is my favorite because it feels fair and challenging and it’s shaping the way I view literature.
THU 10:23 AM
And film!
THU 10:23 AM
We're directly taught not to care about grades in grad school. 6 years of grad school taught me look for something else in the relationship with my teachers. I cannot say I succeeded.
THU 10:24 AM
I'm glad it is shaping how you view communications.
THU 10:25 AM
That rabbithole runs deep.
THU 10:25 AM
I'm glad you like theory. It is the part of English I respect the most as a philosopher.
THU 10:26 AM
I wish I didn’t care about grades. :joy:
THU 10:57 AM
Engineering ruined my GPA forever.
THU 10:57 AM
=(
THU 11:12 AM
I'm sorry.
THU 11:12 AM
I'm glad you jumped into the humanities though.
THU 11:12 AM
STEM will only ever give you instruments and means, but it will never be able to define [[The End]].
THU 11:13 AM
Exactly so it’s fine!
