Hope your drunkshot kicked ass.

Actually that was last weekend and it was a disaster. :D yesterday was my primary campaign and it went VERY well!

I clearly misunderstood, lol. I thought you were just going to wait to start drinking until after you'd already started the game, since you only got like 15 minutes into the content.
8 HR AGO
I am glad it went well!
8 HR AGO
What are you finding novel about it?
8 HR AGO
Nah. We’ll do another drunk shot one day but hopefully after this semester. 

Thanks!

You feeling any better?

So I basically surprised my player with her BBEG who in the past supposedly killed her, so he was surprised to find that she was still alive, and he intends to finish what he started.

I'd say I'm at 90% and stuck. The coughing, soreness, and chest aren't quite right just yet. But, I'll take 90%,  gladly.

He’s also the leader of a shady mercenary organization that pretty much burnt the entire city they’ve been hanging out in to the ground just to find one of the other party members because she’s a secret princess. :eyes:

Do you think the premade material provides a solid scaffold or a box to limit yourself (which can be excellent for creativity sometimes)?
8 HR AGO
Like a barebones thing, and you flesh it out. You grow the seed, but you don't have to conceive of it.
8 HR AGO
Not all of it* or something like that.

So the game I ran yesterday is all homebrew, but I’m running my premade next Saturday. 

I already don’t like the premade because I feel really constricted/ compelled to follow along when I’d like more freedom. After the introductory chapter I plan to diverge slightly so I can make it feel more unique.
8 HR AGO
It’s not bad, but I just feel like I’m using someone else’s work. :joy:
8 HR AGO
Uniqueness and authenticity.
8 HR AGO
I'm still fleshing them out.
8 HR AGO
I think the premades are useful for showing budding DMs how to make their own stories.
8 HR AGO
Well, I will think more about it.

We are having birthday lunch with [[AA]] and [[AG]] after church then we’ll be doing laundry and watching Buffy while I work on my Fight Club paper. Later we’ll probably play FFXIV.
8 HR AGO
I see almost all of my ideas and re-using ideas of others, extensions of others, I'm just part of the evolution of [[The Great Human Conversation]].
8 HR AGO
Noice!
8 HR AGO
I’m hoping we can sneak IT Chapter 1 into our day somewhere but [[L]] is having second thoughts about watching it.
8 HR AGO
Yeah I feel it! :)
8 HR AGO
It’s one weird idea hive mind.
8 HR AGO
I do not know.
8 HR AGO
But, I'm struggling to see the value in uniqueness and authenticity in a lot of cases. I like authenticity in terms of trust. I like uniqueness when it is conceptually necessary for novelty and not being bored.
8 HR AGO
It sounds like your day is packed! =)
8 HR AGO
(Good) Uniqueness is hard to come by in media these days.
8 HR AGO
Definitely! You guys having a family day?
8 HR AGO
Aye.
8 HR AGO
Like a pulse in our lives.
8 HR AGO
Computer clock cycles have a tick and a tock.
8 HR AGO
Like a heartbeat.
8 HR AGO
Oddly enough. That’s the theme of the sermon we’re listening to right now.
8 HR AGO
Taking information to process, and spitting out the digested material.
8 HR AGO
I will leave you to! May your [[Straussian]] goggles pick out the [[salience]].
8 HR AGO
to it*
8 HR AGO
Gracias! And likewise. :>
