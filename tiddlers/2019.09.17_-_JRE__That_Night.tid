title: 2019.09.17 - JRE: That Night

My brother called me up while I was speaking with [[GB]]. He called me again later. He made me laugh talking about a guy giving him shit for using a unique measuring tool to match the pipe offsets (I think my brother has this down to an art and a science at this point). He kept walking the guy down his shitty arguments, and it got better the next day when the guy realized my brother knows exactly what the fuck he is doing. That's exciting, of course, but I find his moral boldness and sacrifice moving. 

He was telling me about how his foreman was talking about my brother just thinks about everything differently, always forcing the guys around him to look at something from another angle. It's as dialectical as it gets.

Told him that [[GB]] contacted me out of the blue. We talked about 2018.07.02. My brother was horrified to hear it. He knows I've been doing better.

God damn, those are some heavy lyrics.

aye, i loved the song when i first heard it back in college.  Thought it was about as christlike as a non-christian's love could be

I know it might come across as manipulative, in the existential panic that I found myself in, you are definitely one of my reasons to live
SEP 17 8:44 PM
I think that's my goal, as much as it makes me shudder. No matter how much I have a problem with Christianity and those who call themselves Christian, and even though I know Jesus Christ isn't any more divine than any other homo sapien, I still hope to live up to Christ.
