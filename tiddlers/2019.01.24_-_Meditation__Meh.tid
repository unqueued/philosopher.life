title: 2019.01.24 - Meditation: Meh

I slept forever to the point of being sore. Stretches were outstanding, and the yoga woke me up some. I'm probably not pushing myself hard enough. I hate to say it, but I think the stretches do more for me than the yoga. This is likely due to my incompetence and poor fitness.

Meditation wasn't so great. I raced and looped the entire time. I'm trying not to kick myself. I'm also terrible at recognizing when my shoulders and chest are actually released. I believe I can tell very quickly with everything else, but I'm always tight up top to the point of it appearing normal. That can't be good. I suggest I will need a great deal of practice to even get myself to a place where meditation will be a skill. This is an important ability, and I also shouldn't expect too much of myself (I worry I'm not expecting enough though!).
