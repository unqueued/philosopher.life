!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I did a good job installing my OS.
** You did your OS installation and configuration all by yourself. You had to set it up from scratch. I'm really proud of how hard you worked. You worked until 8pm that night. I know it was a difficult day, and I'm glad you are still working on it. Keep going.
** Your room has been the cleanest it has been in a long time. Thank you.
** I appreciate your quirky sense of humor, and you frequently make me laugh.
** You do a good job trying to make friends with other kids.
* j3d1h
** I did a good job getting into the OS and not making too much of a fuss about it.
** I'm impressed by how you didn't want to try i3, you argued carefully with me, and you agreed to try it. I think your choice was rational, and I think you've been charitable and constructive in trying to "make it work." It seems like you already understand it better than I do, and I'm pretty envious about that. Keep going.
** You did a good job on the tub. It looks really nice.
** I had fun doing Aisle 8 stuff with you. I miss our mother/daughter time.
** Thank you for helping me with the charger.
* k0sh3k
** I did a good job surviving "oven" hell at work.
** Thank you for carrying about the cat enough to look for a flea collar.
** Thank you for helping me get coffee.
** I want to say thank you for graciously thinking about where I'm supposed to be. I feel torn between staying with the kids and making money, and I'm really glad that you don't make me feel like less of a man, husband, or dad about it. I appreciate your supportive and constructive reasoning with me about it.
** I'm really proud that you are starting to stand up for your human rights at work, that you are building space for yourself, your sanity, your professional development, etc. I'm glad you are learning to say "no" or to at least passively set it aside. Resistance! Revolution!
* h0p3
** My letter to L was effective, well conceived, and I'm really glad I spent the emotional energy to do it.
** Thanks for getting my salad dressing. That's the thing I'm most proud of you about this week.
** Thank you for getting so many watermelons. They work well as fake boobs.
** Thank you for thinking about my religious beliefs with me.
