title: 2017.05.02 -- Pipefitting Log

Today was more productive than yesterday. Mel and Luke did most of the cutting. This, of course, meant that the lengths tended to be wrong. They do not check their work after they produce it, and this means that patterns go unnoticed and therefore uncorrected. I checked the pipes later and kindly pointed it out. I did some grinding to fix it.

The welding teacher stopped by to see about welding. He wants me to do a 2G weld, since it counts as a 1G on the tests. I felt like I would be abandoning my group to do this. I asked to do it on Thursday. I went to change my mind, but he was at that point too busy. He wanted the bevel to be more precise, so that's what I did.

They had some problems with the bandsaw, but fixed it. It was clogged and not draining the oil. During that time, I went to the financial services office. I got my tuition taken care of, since AB&T was going to pay for tools and part of the tuition, leaving me stuck with a $500 I couldn't pay. I told them to forget the tools (especially since their new fiscal year starts in July, and my funding jumps to $2100 for the last semester). I could use it.

I got the fittings and flanges set, and I finished off the last third of the cuts. Luke and I did the tip-grind work together. Luke sits at about 80% of my speed. Mel just sat around.

Anyways, we started fitting. I'm unofficially the group leader. We do it my way, although I regularly ask for suggestions and their thoughts (sometimes they see something I don't, particularly Luke). It is possible Mel wasn't pleased possibly because I'm a trimester behind him, but clearly better than he is (I've heard a few comments from him). Ultimately, he did jack shit today. TJ was right about him. He is lazy as fuck (and that fits what I've seen in the shop for the past 4 months). Turns out that Mel doesn't even like physical labor at all (what is he doing in the pipefitting program?). Luke at least will work (although he screws around too often enough [less so with me]). He at least enjoys working when he does though. Mel, on the other hand, did some tacking (and even decided to tack for the other group for a while) and made 3 cuts.<<ref "1">> That was it. He wanted to "study" for a test because Nash was avoiding work by studying as well. They really just want to sit in the classroom doing nothing but play on their phones. Idiots.

Chris was all by his lonesome while Nash screwed around. I helped Chris a few times when I felt he needed the extra hand to get stuff done. Some stuff just requires two people, and it sucks that my leaving his group meant that he is forced to do so much on his own. The difference showed. Luke and I (and technically Mel, although Mel also "worked" with Chris) finished our project and had it mounted by the end of the day, and Chris/Nash are maybe 60% of the way through.

Chris needed my help with the redrawing. If you recall, my teacher threw us a curveball at us by having us install valves after we had already mounted fabrications on the simulator. That meant that the 1" drawing wasn't accurate. Chris was using this drawing, and he needed to do the math for it. I did the math last time. This time he had to, but he was struggling and didn't want to get it wrong (that would be a lot of lost effort). So, we sat down together and worked it out. Although, now that I'm thinking about it, I forgot (like I asked myself not to, lol) to tel him about the extra 1/8th of an inch for the heat expansion. We took those into account in the math for my project, but I think we forgot for his. 

Luke and I spent a lot of time leveling and plumbing today, and I think it paid off. Luke and I use an interesting trick sometimes. When we feel we can't quite get a fitting on level, we will put a pipe on it first and then attach that fitting+pipe to the main construction, since this gives us a point to level/plumb off, and it is the ultimate test. I don't always like this trick, but sometimes it really fits the problem for us. I need to think more about it.

Anyways, when we went to mount it, it looked to be off by a solid 3 inches. Nash wanted to help us mount instead of working on his project. Lol. Anyways, we had run into this before on screwpipe, and instead of being disheartened, we just tried to make it work. It fit just fine when we went to tighten the bolts on the flanges. There is going to be a serious element of experience that I must acquire to know if and when a fabrication is going to mount-worthy or not. It is simply not obvious enough by getting it into place. Steel is flexible. It isn't clear how flexible, but flexible enough that an inch per ~7 feet can be squeezed out. Clearly, even when you do everything as carefully as you can, you still only get "close." The goal, I take it, is to get close enough.

I must say, I'm glad we put 4 tacks on. There is clearly serious pressure on it. I wonder if we would normally weld it before mounting it in the field. I need to ask my teacher. I think it would be wiser to fit it first.

Luke said that we won't be doing any of this in the field (my teacher says otherwise, and I take my teacher's claim to be more authoritative). Yes, some people in the field stovepipe. I do not want to. Math makes my life easier. Oh yeah, several times, including today, my teacher told me not to listen to Luke. I generally don't, but sometimes Luke is right. My teacher has a bad habit of marking someone as X in his head and being unable to see them as being anything other than X in all contexts. Granted, we all must rely upon rules of thumb, but even our rules of thumb must be empirically verified from time to time.

At the end of the day, the teacher told us to move onto replacing the 1.5" screwpipe. Chris laughed, claiming he anticipated this. Reasonable enough. He then became somber as he realized that the 3" pipe, for which we couldn't find screwpipe flanges, could easily be his next project (after his 1" pipe), since we likely have 3" pipe socket weld or slipon flanges.
