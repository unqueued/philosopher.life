title: 2017.10.31 -- Yearly Audit Log

* I want to point out that "Syntactic Construction" in the Focus of {[[Principles]]} continues to shrinks. I feel like everytime I have an idea of what I'm trying to accomplish syntactically that I've actually figured out what I'm really trying to accomplish semantically. When I don't know, then all I have is syntax.

* [[Wiki: Tiddlers of Note]]
** Directorified and filled out.
* [[Wiki: Tiddlywiki Howto's]]
** Ditto.
* [[Wiki: Tiddlywiki Resources]]
** Renamed. Sticking with "Wiki:" [[Titletag]] unless I have a reason not to. It's important to immediately identify it.
** Directorified and filled out.
** Organized links and listified them.
* [[Wiki: lost+found]]
** Renamed, directorified, and filled.
** Admittedly, I'm not even sure what I'm doing with this. I need an outlet for "not knowing," and this is one of them.
* [[Wiki: Directory File Structure Template]]
** I've gone back to templating the template. I absolute must think about why I'm using it. I need to define it. I've done a poor job. I still don't know, but I think I will find out as I continue to do this Yearly Audit.
* [[Wiki: PH]]
** Minor Edits. 
** This doesn't feel like it merits Directorification templating
* [[Wiki: Literal Programming of the Wiki]]
** Buried in [[Wiki: Dead Principles]]
