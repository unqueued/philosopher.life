title: 2020.01.12 - Prompted Introspection: Ayyyyy

!! I wish to be a when I grow up. Then I will?.

Well, there are many symbols you could wish to be when you grow up. I don't know what //a// refers to in your domain. I would offer a snarky: "good for you," but that could be inappropriate (depending on its resolution). Well, yeah, dude, cool, like, that would be, uh, interesting to be, when ya grow up, and what not, err, unless, you know, that isn't preferred. Then you will...have been "a" after having grown up, my dude. I bet that is quite an accomplishment, and surely it means something important to you. You'll have to let me know what you mean by it when you get the chance.
