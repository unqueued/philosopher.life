!! Who's or what's approval should you seek?

I consistently see existentialist and psychological advice that boils down to the claim that one is better off refraining from seeking the approval of others. Often, this can be very good advice. It rids us of the pain of futile pursuits. But, I am deeply worried that this isn't an unconditional principle by any stretch. 

I suppose I should ask what is meant by Approval? Do we mean some form of Appraisal Respect (AR) or Recognition Respect (RR)? It seems like is a variant of respect. Friendship, authority, and perhaps all relationships require at least some degree or kind of respect/approval, however, we might define it. It seems as though this is both a practical and ethical matter.

Perhaps we must seek the approval of Humanity, The Rational, The Wise, The Right, The Good, or even ourselves. What is the standard we take to be fundamentally normative? We seek the approval of a standard, essentially, right? Even if I am only seeking my own approval at first glance, don't other standards constitute my own personal standard? Obviously, I have not peeled anything apart. I seem to be saying things I already know. On that note:

I must say: I feel rejected by Humanity.
