*** I'm not buying your bullshit. I disagree with my Leftist brethren here; I think Babyboomers are responsible for the world I live in (as are their forefathers, and so on). You made your bed. When I meet Babyboomers who deserve my respect, I will surely give it to them.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/world-asia-42009839
*** Having traveled a bit, I've seen public transportation systems of varying effectiveness. It's hard for me to fathom expecting 20 seconds of accuracy in my country. We suck.

* Think About It
** http://www.eweek.com/security/schneier-it-s-time-to-regulate-iot-to-improve-cyber-security
*** I'd love to understand what that regulation looks like. Please tell me you hold corporations accountable /pipedream. That is literally the only out that works. 
*** I'm extremely worried that there isn't a serious difference between IoT and the rest of my devices...whatever you do to regulate one will regulate the other. That I cannot abide by.
*** Here's my prediction of what actually will happen: the average user is about to get royally fucked over by their ISP as they lose the ability to upload and send outbound traffic not carefully controlled by the ISP. No potential for abuse there, right? ROFLMAO, KYS. 
**** DPI is going to be my bane.
** https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/brotherhood-of-losers/544158/
*** Yet another article trying to nail it down. They get closer to it. You still do not understand what counts as the Left, clearly. You continue to alienate.
*** "a generation of young white men now harbor the dangerous belief that they have no futureâ€”a belief that will be that much more dangerous if it proves to be true."
**** Keep going. Don't you see that such a backlash will be harnessed by those in power again and again? Don't you see that decentralizing power (wealth) through extreme means is the only answer? You are too late as it is, but now your vision will always be one step behind too late. You will never realize it in time; the game will have already been lost because you've rationalized your libertarianism. 

* Fishy

*** Lol, like Golang, crowdsourced development of the ecosystem. Psychopaths don't give things away for free. Why would they willingly give up their competitive advantage?

***  Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) knew what she was doing. This is very curious.
