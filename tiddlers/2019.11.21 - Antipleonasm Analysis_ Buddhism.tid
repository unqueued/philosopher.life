title: 2019.11.21 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Buddhism

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
After all, what Buddhism offers as a solution is universalised indifference - a learning of how to withdraw from too much empathy. This is why Buddhism can so easily turn into the very opposite of universal compassion: the advocacy of a ruthless military attitude, which is what the fate of Zen Buddhism aptly demonstrates.
<<<

As a solution to what? Philosophical problems of ontology, meaning, selfhood, perspective-taking, and desire are non-trivial. I am a terribly unfun person to speak with on the topic. I am also not an expert in Buddhism.

Note, as always, that empathy is not the precise measure of being moral, and "too much" is incorrect (but, you are in trouble with me on metaethics too, Sir [[Zizek]]). It is still only instrumental as an epistemic device, and it can be misused even by a psychopath (that's in fact what sociopaths are engaged in). Roughly, moral motivation is concerned with the principle with which we weigh and compute our various streams of empathy [[irwartfrr]]. Sure, plenty of Buddhists I've encountered are selectively empathic in a convenient fashion. For example, I've watched them feed dogs instead of hungry children. But, I don't think this clearly picks out a problem with Buddhism, but rather some so-called practitioners (and I would levy the same argument against most religious and philosophical bodies of people).

I consider this a fairly standard critique. My primary exposure has been through Americanized Buddhism(s), the Theravādist sects of Thailand, and some analytic philosophers who translate, dabble, and syncretize. As I have grown older, I've come to appreciate paraconsistent approaches to The Dialetheia, and, to my poor understanding, Buddhism is more comfortable with and equipped to handle some kinds of paradox than many other systems of thought.<<ref "g">>

Having seen Buddhism misappropriated as an ideological tool of the elite in Thailand, I'm well aware of the ruthlessness which can emerge (and, again, I'd say the same about how any major system of thought can be twisted and abused). While I still hold the kernel of the desire for radical pacifism in high regard, I have little sympathy for anti-realism and political apathy; plenty of Buddhists I've met are essentially reactionaries and capitalists (a minor percentage of the offenders I know). Some of the best people I've met are Buddhists though; in my experience, they've had to do some serious wrestling with their faiths. I'm happy to shit on people and roll my eyes all day, but I'm uncomfortable making claims about the limits of Buddhism as a belief system; I'm [[Straussian]]ly open to its ability to transform like so many other memeplexes in history. As always, a [[good]] philosopher pursues what is [[salient]]. Like a broken [[Straussian]]ly Salafistic record, I'm still going to point everyone to [[Saint Plato]] and Saint Kant.
