!! Audit:

* It feels like I actually covered less ground this month. I still did plenty of reading. It's fine if this goes on the backburner.
** The fact is that I'm sifting, and I want to get better at it. For every article I picked out, there are 10-20 that I didn't (and mind you, those are 10-20 that I've curated).
* Missed a title.Title. I left it though. That's okay. I don't require it.
** Speaking of, You can tell I'm kind of burnt out. This is a chore-drug.
* This is a practice that I want my children to become habituated virtuously in. Shaping your input and consuming what matters, it changes how you perceive everything.
* I'm obviously pissed in the majority of cases.
* I very much appreciate my commentary. I need to continue writing more.
* I like that I SCWR. I've been doing it more across the wiki.
* I've been keeping a lot of FF windows open this month. Hundreds of tabs. It works.
* My longest posts have been this month. 
* My head always spins when I go through these. It's too much information.
* I think my point of view is crystallizing. On one hand, I think that can be a good thing, especially if it builds a foundation for moving onto the next step. On the other hand, inflexibility at this stage prevents me from redpilling into the next stage gracefully (assuming there is such a thing).
