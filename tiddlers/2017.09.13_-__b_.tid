Caloric and reproductive egoism. We are lazy because we are evolutionarily selected for being lazy in the right way, at the right time, etc. Those who don't waste calories, who are calorically efficient are more likely to survive and reproduce.

My father is a drug addict. Food was one obvious example, which he only admits because he wears the evidence. What he won't tell you is how he was an incredible asshole when he was hungry. Prone to abuse when he was "hangry." Of course, this is the obvious one. The one he simply must admit to some degree because the evidence hangs on him. There are far more dangerous addictions of his to be known.

Willful ignorance is almost always malicious selfishness.

I feel even more like an alien to my own wife. I believe she feels the same way toward me. It isn't strong, but it's there (however slight).

What is alienness?

Lacking shared values, goals, beliefs, feelings, understandings, experiences, etc. to the extent that one is "other" even without being otherized.

This isn't on purpose. Far from it. We have both worked very hard to empathize with each other. Yet, we don't succeed, or at least not to the extent we yearn for.

The house is divided. We keep it together the best we can. Generally, our goals and views align. To the untrained eye, it may not even be obvious. To us, the gulf feels wide sometimes.

I can see it is broken. How can we fix it? We each have hope for the other and for us. Even the semblance of unity seems better than the alternative.

Some memes leave a lasting mark. Their infection can be so deeply rooted that the scars leave us hollow.
