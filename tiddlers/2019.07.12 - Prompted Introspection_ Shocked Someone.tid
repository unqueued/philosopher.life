title: 2019.07.12 - Prompted Introspection: Shocked Someone

!! Tell about a time when you shocked someone.

Meh, I shock enough people with being someone they don't like. I'm going literal here.

It's 1994, the Christmas Tree is up with our broken lights. I accidentally touched one. It electrocuted me a little bit, but it wasn't bad (I have no idea how it was only "a bit"). I think there is something off about my skin conduction (my aunt also can't wear watches with batteries in them), but I don't test it. I enjoyed the feeling of this shock; it can be tantalizing to this idiot. I tried it several times, and I eventually put my tongue on it. To this day, I still enjoy the feeling of 9V batteries on my tongue, and I also like the taste of metal. However, static shocks and those electrical shock gag lighters are painful, and I hates them, my precious.
