title: Voting: Quotes

<<<
Choosing not to vote is a vote for the status quo.
<<<

Agreed only insofar as your vote actually matters. If you can demonstrate that votes count, that they really shape the world, that Bayesian predictions somehow aren't relevant, that we are actually in a representative democracy, then yes. Unfortunately, you are fucked.

Note the difference between apathy and disgust at your lack of power.

<<<
Democracy doesn’t work unless you participate.
<<<

It is also up to us to make sure your voice is heard, that you can voice it effectively, that we remove barriers to expression and maximize our expressivity. Don't blame suppressed voters.

<<<
If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal.  
<<<

ROFL!

<<<
Voting is a civic sacrament 
<<<

Political animals.

<<<
Constantly choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil.
<<<

Hursthousianly Marred.

<<<
The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.

-- Winston S. Churchill
<<<

Education is the only option.

<<<
If you are bored and disgusted by politics and don't bother to vote, you are in effect voting for the entrenched Establishments of the two major parties, who please rest assured are not dumb, and who are keenly aware that it is in their interests to keep you disgusted and bored and cynical and to give you every possible reason to stay at home doing one-hitters and watching MTV on primary day. By all means stay home if you want, but don't bullshit yourself that you're not voting. In reality, there is no such thing as not voting: you either vote by voting, or you vote by staying home and tacitly doubling the value of some Diehard's vote.

― David Foster Wallace, Up, Simba! 
<<<

Agreed on the assumption of a functioning democracy, but I otherwise disagree. Purely simulated, meaningless appearances of democracy are quite real today. Paradoxically, it can only be solved by us working together regardless of those in power or whatever political structures of the day obtain.

<<<
Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely. The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education.

-- Franklin D. Roosevelt 
<<<

Preach, yo!

<<<
Representative government is artifice, a political myth, designed to conceal from the masses the dominance of a self-selected, self-perpetuating, and self-serving traditional ruling class.

-- Giuseppe Prezzolini
<<<

Agreed insofar as you are describing what obtains rather than the ideal prescription available to us.

<<<
I'm all in favor of the democratic principle that one idiot is as good as one genius, but I draw the line when someone takes the next step and concludes that two idiots are better than one genius.

-- Leo Szilard
<<<

Who draws the lines of genius and idiot? You are correct objectively, but game-theoretically, decentralization is the best and only stable equilibrium available to us.

<<<
There are two political truisms: Old people vote and Republicans eat their young.

-- Eddie Whitlock
<<<

Yup

<<<
Always vote for principle, though you may vote alone, and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost.

-- President John Quincy Adams.
<<<

Preach, yo!

<<<
Every election is sort of an advance auction sale of stolen goods.

-- H.L. Mencken in “Prejudices: First Series,” published 1919.
<<<

Indeed, most governments are illegitimate for this reason. We have to repattern ourselves.

<<<
A vote is like a rifle: its usefulness depends upon the character of the user

-- Commonly attributed to President Theodore Roosevelt
<<<

Everyone must arm themselves and enforce the rule of law from top to bottom of society. True democracy is our safeguard against the psychopaths among us.

<<<
It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.

-- Winston Churchill, on the floor of Parliament in November 1947.
<<<

Classic.

<<<
If voting changed anything, they’d make it illegal.

-- Commonly attributed to anarchist Emma Goldman.
<<<

Thus, we must make legitimate democratic voting as legally obligated, expressive, and protected as we can.

<<<
The ballot is stronger than the bullet.

-- Abraham Lincoln
<<<

Pen is mightier than the sword; memes are the software running on genetic hardware. We must be good algorithms all the way down.

<<<
Politicians are like diapers. They both need changing regularly and for the same reason.
<<<

Preach!

<<<
Suffrage is the pivotal right.

-- Susan B. Anthony
<<<

Say it again, girl.

<<<
 The ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all. 

-- John F. Kennedy 
<<<

Virtue is knowledge.

<<<
Democracy is a form of government that substitutes election by the incompetent many for appointment by the corrupt few.
<<

Burn.
