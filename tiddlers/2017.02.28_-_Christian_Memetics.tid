title: 2017.02.28 - Christian Memetics

//In name and partially content, Christian Memetics reminds me strongly of "Christian Mimetics," a subdiscipline of Religion one of my professors claimed to study.//

It's clear that Christian churches are a special kind of community. There is a mental virus that continues living because it serves to help those who participate in the church community. It is far from obvious that most churches have a significant impact on the happiness of those around them, but it is obvious that many stay in the community itself directly because they have something to gain from it. Whether it is calming their fear of death, prosperity delusions, or social networking, churches exist because they are practical utility-generating centers for their members. 

They are filled with conservatives. Let me define conservative for you: I will only sacrifice for you insofar as you are willing to sacrifice for me. Not everyone is 100% conservative. There are parts of their lives which contradict their conservatism. But, it is obvious that the Church has always existed qua conservative utilitarian economic incentives. 

It is a network of tit-for-tat trust generation games where people feel each other out and learn who will sacrifice for them. They build mutually beneficial relationships. It is very rare, however, to see unidirectional relationships, especially from the powerful to the poor and needy done quietly and anonymously (except for the warm fuzzies). Here is what conservatives ask themselves subconsciously: Can you sacrifice for me? What can I get from you? Can I socially bootstrap myself up the ladder through you? Are you worth my time, energy, or investment? 

The hypocrisy reaches far beyond the fact that no one in the church is a decent human being. These people don't even want to be decent human beings, but they act as they do. It's an act. It's a lie. It's virtue signaling.

Religion was the original social regulation instrument used to control the public consciousness. It's the opiate of the people. People are gullible, and religion comes preloaded with ideal mechanisms for centralizing power structures, enslaving the masses, and teaching people to blame invisible creatures and dimensions for the problems in our world instead of the psychopaths in power.
