Hey, you! I'm {[[contact]]}ing you out of blue like a shameless clown-alien [[human|Humanity]]-stalker.<<ref "b">> I can see you have already {[[help]]}ed yourself (awesome), but please let me know if I can serve you any further, nomad.<<ref "i">> It's my pleasure to meet you.

I've been thinking about you this evening, [[Kevin|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DgbUBoxa48]],<<ref "m">> by way of Sir [[kickscondor]] the Librarian.<<ref "l">> You have the ~~displeasure~~ honor of receiving my letter written while I'm ~~250ml~~ ~~500ml~~ 750ml into ~~a fancy~~ an empty bottle of "Wild Irish Rose: Wild Grape" (I've only recently discovered this godsend), which I affectionately refer to as my //purple drank//.<<ref "r">> It is an //elixir// I recommend for only the most ~~curious~~ impoverished palates.

It's fascinating to see clusters of folks I've seen online mesh together. There are some visible and probably some invisible threads there. You are decentralizing your [[self-modeling|Public Self-Modelers]] interestingly. I [[hope]] to learn from you! I will need to think about it, and I appreciate your openness and honesty. You make me think I'll need to start more seriously setting up multi-stop shops to interpret [[others]]. Also, I may not be the kind of madman you'll want to associate with, so I'll let you figure that one out. In any case, my door is always open, and please let me know where to look, in case there is some particular place I should.<<ref "q">>

In some ways, I'm actually having a difficult time piecing together who you are in my first pass, so I'm going to stick to media for the most part.

Thank you for providing a window into your tastes and media diet (a great phrase for it). I'm working my way through your recent [[music]] (I'm not so good at finding music). So far, it says nothing to me about you other than the fact that you like [[good]] drugs (right on). I'm a dozen songs deep into Maggie Rogers, and she's wonderful. I'm exploring [[here|2019.02.05 - Music Exploration: Humdrumming]]. I almost drunkenly cried to the //Africa// cover; it's like being transported to the re-telling of part of my childhood. I wouldn't have found this Weezer album without you. You make me feel happily old. Thanks! =) 

Muh Possibly Irrelevant Questions:

* Why do you think Jim Jefferies is funny (if you do)?
** Jim Jefferies looks like my male biological donor, and I'm a huge fan of the former (but only as a comedian).
* How do you curate the [[links|https://tiv.today/links]] for your [[Link Log]]?
** I'm always on the hunt fo' dat [[S2NR]].
** S-s-senpai, please, I will be forever in your debt.
** Also, the commentary is wonderful.
* What do you think about your [[now|https://tiv.today/now]] section?
* Where would you point a fool to learn how to meditate?
** I ain't so good at it.
*** Medding up should grant you mana rather than literal headaches, right?
* You watch Star Trek as a kid? What are you thinking about //Discovery//?
** No whammies, and please say TNG.
* Am I mistaken in getting the New Yorker vibe off you?
* What are you thinking about the value of making nested lists?
** I don't run into it often enough.
** I think some people find them too ugly.

Some of your posts standing out to me:<<ref "w">>

Rando Calrissian's comments:

* I'm fascinated to know the ways in which you feel it necessary to demonstrate your value to the homo sapiens in your life.
** Speaking of, I'm going to sit on this to see if you read it before I DM you.
* I love your liberal use of footnotes.<<ref "fn">>
* One thing I like about your humdrum blog is the ability for me to use my extensions to open all of your posts per page with a single highlight. I might need to afford the same to my own guests.
* I won't press you too hard on robotics processing automation. I have plenty of questions.
* If I could somehow impose a letter onto you, it would be "K" for the shiggles.
** I'm rapidly advancing my splendid [[KKK]] concepts and projects as fast as humanly possible. 
* Your pix, particularly the grass, remind me of some [[replication images|https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/06/20/algorithmic-reduction-of-psychedelic-states/]] I've seen.

Alright, it's late, and I'm avoiding my actual work (thank you). I need: a Diogenic whiskey-dick wank; to put my flu-infected, sleep-resistant wife to bed; and to pass out in front of another (probably 30th pass) [[Rick & Morty|TV: Library]] lullaby which, lawd willing, will quiet my ~~machinegun~~ squirt-gun mind into the oblivion of sleep. See you on the flipside, homie.


Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
