title: 2019.02.01 - Prompted Introspection: Best Restaurant

!! Tell about the best restaurant you have ever been to.

I haven't been to many fancy restaurants. I'm not sure how to pick "best" in this case. Right now, I want Captain D's or the Brooklyn style pizza in town. Probably the most relieving and enjoyable restaurant has been the Lebanese restaurant we visited in Bangkok (very expensive) when we were so sick of the Thai taste. 

I adored the mom and pop seafood restaurant we often visited in Chonburi; that was the best soup I've ever had in my entire life. We ate like royalty. [[j3d1h]] used to pick out the fish herself; she'd eat the eyeballs too. I miss it a lot.
