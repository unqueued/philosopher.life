title: 2018.12.02 - MTG Log: Daughter

Played Dark Depths vs her build of Affinity. I walked through the game again with both offspring present. I explained my thoughts about every single step she took (T1 TS allowed me know what she needed to do). My son blurted out my hand, but not before I had already revealed just to give my daughter an idea of what I was doing. In a few turns, the game was obviously over. I made a bunch of Marit Lages for fun and the server started complaining because we cloned and spammed "gave" each other so many permanents that our clients showed less than a letter for each card. My son was laughing the whole time.

I made several errors. I'm beyond rusty.
