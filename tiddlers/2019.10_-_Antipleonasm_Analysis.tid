!! Audit:

* And, this is why no one likes you. =) lol.
** Here's your sign.
* Oh, yeah, that Banksy skirting around copyright was on my mind too.
* There comes a point where I must question someone's helplessness.
* I've had games on the brain quite a bit.
* Oh, I liked that you did a joke. Further, I like that you went loosey-goosey and more stream-of-conscious. Some of that may be valuable, and you still don't know where this log is going.
** Yeah, that one is gunky and free-associated.
* Lol, I see one of my [[Nostradamus]] claims popping up here.
* Fleshing out a vile point of view which must despised or ignored. Lol.
* Lawdy, some long and technical ones here (I'm sure it looks like blather).
** I wish I had a formally trained Kantian or Platonist (preferably both) to speak with. 
* Easily my favorite over [[Prompted Introspection]]. It should be though, I get to go with my own flow on it.
** Speaking of which, you've gone off the beaten path and just started selecting from your hyperreading.
*** [[Link Log]] is damned good for this project.
* Lots of virtue theory this month.
* My wife regularly likes the [[Saint MX]] quotes the most. It's blind too. Neat.
* Straight-up mean to Continental sometimes. 
* Clearly, you have politics on the brain 24/7.
** Will there come a day where you've said what you must, and there's nothing else?
*** I doubt it.
