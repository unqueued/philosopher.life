type: text/plain

1:14 PM] robotic_scarab: I am slowwwwly catching up on the wiki through your reviews again :)
[1:14 PM] h0p3: Hey! How are you doing?
[1:14 PM] robotic_scarab: it sounds like you had a rough weekend last week
[1:14 PM] h0p3: Yeah. Lol.
[1:14 PM] h0p3: I have been better.
[1:14 PM] h0p3: But, it turned around well enough.
[1:15 PM] robotic_scarab: being able to still have your family time space despite circumstances sounded good(?) to me.
[1:16 PM] robotic_scarab: idk how to phrase it, just that i can imagine it would be a comfort/nice/something to have that despite unpleasant circumstances
[1:16 PM] h0p3: Yes. It was wonderful. Sitting in the hospital bed is definitely not normal, but family time made it instantly home.
[1:18 PM] h0p3: Have you been able to make any more art pieces?
[1:18 PM] h0p3: I haven't started the book yet, btw. I just found out ILL failed to go through, but I've got a digital copy now.
[1:22 PM] robotic_scarab: I have made a few more! I did a lot of digital sketching and transferred them to the rubber but have only carved one of the three so far
[1:23 PM] robotic_scarab: glad you got a copy! Re-reading it is on my list of things to think about doing soon, ha
[1:23 PM] h0p3: Lol. "Things to think about doing" I like it.
[1:24 PM] robotic_scarab: it seems like things to think about doing are most of my to-do list these days XP
[1:24 PM] h0p3: Mine too.
[1:24 PM] h0p3: If possible, I'd like to see the soup to nuts process you go through to make your art. I'm curious to see how the pieces come together to make the final thing.
[1:27 PM] robotic_scarab: hm!
[1:27 PM] robotic_scarab: I'm not sure how I would share that :)
[1:27 PM] robotic_scarab: I will ponder this
[1:27 PM] h0p3: Oh, I have no idea either, lol.
[1:28 PM] h0p3: It might not be something easily described.
[12:45 PM] robotic_scarab: oh no, the wiki review for 5.5.19 is one of the missing Bob ones!
[12:45 PM] robotic_scarab: this might be an instance where I go back to backups then using kick's tool :)
[11:47 PM] h0p3: Not even in my backups.
[11:47 PM] robotic_scarab: really??
[11:47 PM] h0p3: Savetrail is the only thing which caught it.
[11:48 PM] robotic_scarab: goddamn I wonder what happened to them
[11:48 PM] h0p3: I have no idea.
