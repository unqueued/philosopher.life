title: 2019.05.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Democratic Postulate

!! Respond to the following gem:

Perhaps this is an obvious point, but the democratic postulate is that the media are independent and committed to discovering and reporting the truth, and that they do not merely reflect the world as powerful groups wish it to be perceived. Leaders of the media claim that their new choices rest on unbiased professional and objective criteria, and they have support for this contention in the intellectual community. If, however, the powerful are able to fix the premises of discourse, to decide what the general populace is allowed to see, hear, and think about, and to “manage” public opinion by regular propaganda campaigns, the standard view of how the system works is at serious odds with reality.

This is why I'm still such an idealist about the wild-west incarnations of the internet. P2P relationships and aggregation form better foundations of trust and memetic rhizomes to explore in some cases, and in capitalism, it is the saving grace against the centralization of memetic power. Until then, I'm still forced to [[Straussian]]ly reason and read between the lines of mainstream media as best I can. Capitalism subverts everything through commodification and the centralization of power.
