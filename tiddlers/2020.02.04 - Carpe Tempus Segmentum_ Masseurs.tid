title: 2020.02.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Masseurs

* Woke at 10:30
** Prolly ~4 hours. But, sweet baby jesus, them was some good four hours.
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
** Daydreamt of a family of masseurs owning me.
* Shower
** I've never had a shower head like this one. It's like it rain downs. Fancy. 
** My favorite part of the shower itself is the floor. It's a stand-only shower, and the curvature drains well. Most importantly, the texture is profoundly no-slip. I like firm-footing so much.
* [[Fitness Routine]]
* Dialecture
* Cleaning
* Read+Write
* Worked on my offspring's rooms since they won't without me.
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Tuna sandwiches, long grain rice, apples
** Hit the spot.
* //Battlestar Galactica//
** My offspring are finally interested.
* Awful coughing fit. Destroyed the evening.
* Read
* YT spiral
* Fireman Time!
* Tried sleeping multiple times...=/
