I bet having 2 DMs is an interesting experience, but a very productive one too
2 hours ago
 I actually really like it — [[K]] and I bounce off of each other pretty well
1 hour ago
 And it means one group can roleplay with one DM while the other deals with the rest of them
1 hour ago
 ah
1 hour ago
 that makes sense
1 hour ago
 Also, I’ve thought about your desire to respond to my parents’ gift. I’ve decided I don’t have a problem with you responding or think it will do any harm truly. 

I do think there’s a part of my mom (who really sent it) that wants you to respond but in the way SHE wants.
1 hour ago
 But I also don’t think she will respond to your response necessarily. She may just view it as a “well, I tried” sort of deal.
1 hour ago
 Hopefully what I said makes sense?
1 hour ago
 Aye, that makes sense.
1 hour ago
 I will hold them accountable for their response on my wiki. I morally expect T42T. If she doesn't respond (that doesn't mean she must agree), then she hasn't tried. The bridge will remain, but I have a feeling this will end our relationship.
1 hour ago
 I still feel like I owe it to her though, to give her the chance.
1 hour ago
 I appreciate that, because you extended the same grace to me.
1 hour ago
 Or a similar one at least.

Hey, you're on Signal! =) Now I can bother you and stuff.
2 hours ago
 Yeah. I didn’t wanna hit you up on google hangouts anymore since you don’t like it. Since it seems like Signal is working well for y’all and [[L]] I downloaded it last night.
2 hours ago
 Noice
2 hours ago
 Let me know if you need any books for class (or otherwise), btw.
2 hours ago
 I assume that's starting up here in a couple weeks fo ya
2 hours ago
 Your brothers getting settled too?
2 hours ago
 Thank you! Yeah. Two more weeks. I’ll definitely be asking for help. Emoji image of 'joy' Hopefully the books are more accessible this semester. I feel like they will be.
2 hours ago
 More or less. We’ll see for sure once they get here!
2 hours ago
 How are you guys?
2 hours ago
 If your brothers need books too, the offer is there for them as well*
2 hours ago
 Doing well, kids are playing outside right now. Working on our wikis. They are exceptionally excited about DND.
2 hours ago
 Thanks! I’ll let them know. 

That’s good to hear. [[L]] is working very hard on it. I’ll likely be helping her too once it starts rolling around.
2 hours ago
 I'm sure it is interesting to collaborate as DMs
2 hours ago
 Ain’t that the truth. Haha
1 hour ago
 I think it's awesome that you spend time figuring out how to tell stories together. Unifying your voice may serve you in many ways, imho.
1 hour ago
 How goes your book, btw?
1 hour ago
 I agree. 

It’s going. I’m taking a small break by writing a short story in my own dnd universe. It’s going to be a gift to my players and I think it’ll be really fun.
1 hour ago
 Actually I think the correct term is “Novella” because I’m aiming for around 100 pages.
1 hour ago
 nice!
1 hour ago
 My daughter has secretly been doing the same. She just showed me the other day.
1 hour ago
 I'm hoping that the DND game we are playing will be a place for us all to start writing stories. I know they won't be as good as yours, but I still want to try.
1 hour ago
 To expand a little bit. I started officially writing my novel almost a year ago and I’ve written 6-7 chapters with my old outline and one massive chapter with my new. It’s amazing to see the difference I’ve made between my writing class I took.
1 hour ago
 That’s wonderful to hear for her! :)


I don’t think I’m a particularly good writer but I appreciate the thought nevertheless.
1 hour ago
 Maybe one day. ;)
1 hour ago
 Are you considering writing DND fiction for pay?
1 hour ago
 I've run into a number of writings from these universes. Admittedly, I don't have the skills to appreciate them.
1 hour ago
 I want to write fantasy one day. I think this might be a good day to start flexing those creative muscles. I don’t intend to publish this but never say never. I may feel differently once it’s complete.
1 hour ago
 right
1 hour ago
 Good way**
1 hour ago
 that makes sense
1 hour ago
 Using the mechanics of dungeons and dragons to create characters and weave story seems like a very interesting way to write a story but I feel like within the constraints of the fantasy genre as a whole that writing a book entirely using character sheets and a d20 would be extremely unorthodox.
1 hour ago
 But very interesting and tempting at the same time. Haha
1 hour ago
 aye, perhaps rules must be bent and broken harder for this activity
1 hour ago
 we are leagues beyond my ability to see here, I am excited though
1 hour ago
 Imagine having pages of build up just for the bad guy to roll a one and fall into a volcano.
1 hour ago
 rofl
1 hour ago
 yeah, somehow stories can't afford to be too random
1 hour ago
 I would be pissed if I read that book. Emoji image of 'joy'
1 hour ago
 Exactly.
1 hour ago
 I’m also structuring this story loosely enough that it isn’t necessarily dnd fan fiction just in case I change my mind. I haven’t done enough research to tell if specific races and terms are copyrighted by WotC and I wouldn’t want to get super attached just to have to go back and change everything because of a technicality.
1 hour ago
 Like, goblins, elves, dwarves all have root in fantasy and mythology and they are more than fair game.
1 hour ago
 aye
1 hour ago
 I wouldn't be too worried on that front.
1 hour ago
 But are Kenku and tabaxi and other races? I’m unsure. So I’m trying to be careful.
1 hour ago
 Agreed. This is just for fun. ;)
1 hour ago
 Be careful with lifting proper nouns and complete story lines
1 hour ago
 otherwise, you are in fair use territory
1 hour ago
 Exactly. And the world is already of my own creation too. This will just expand on the overall canon of my dnd game.
1 hour ago
 You can always replace race names with your own anyways...
1 hour ago
 That too!
1 hour ago
 In fact, I would probably borrow from  lots of games and stories to build the race exactly as I saw fit, if I were in your shoes
1 hour ago
 plus, if you were going to publish, you'd probably redraft it anyways
1 hour ago
 you are probably more in the planning and path of least resistance stages right now
1 hour ago
 Exactly. Right now this is being built for an audience of 5. That’s bound to have some great fan service but narrow appeal.
1 hour ago
 Yup! I’m about 1/4 of the way done with my outline bible
1 hour ago
 Hey, I'm a broken record (a.k.a. an asshole who always thinks he is right), but I'd like to recommend Tiddlywiki once again for outlining. It's the most flexible writing tool I've ever used. You should try it (even if only to shut me up). It's not difficult to get started. You just need a blank tiddlywiki (tiddlywiki.com) and an addon for auto-saving (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/file-backups/). I honestly believe that once you use the tool, you'd never go back to anything else for these stages of writing.
1 hour ago
 Ew Firefox.
1 hour ago
 Kidding! Emoji image of 'stuck_out_tongue'
1 hour ago
 I see that there is also something called “tiddlywiki for scholars” that seems neat
1 hour ago
 I should start by downloading Firefox I think.
1 hour ago
 You can do use Chrome/Chromium/Opera (the blink engine browsers) if you prefer.
1 hour ago
 I find it best to have a browser exclusively set aside for the wiki
1 hour ago
 I was joking. I know Firefox is dope. I just like Chrome a lot.
1 hour ago
 =)
1 hour ago
 Can I access it from any device or just where I have it saved?
1 hour ago
 currently, browsers are forcing users/extensions/sites to only have access to specified parts of the hard drive (for security reasons...not all users are as wise as you are), so Tiddlywiki will be stored in ~/Downloads
1 hour ago
 It's entirely self-hosted
1 hour ago
 although, you can use other hosting services if you prefer
1 hour ago
 There are other options besides using a browser (TiddlyDesktop, I believe)
1 hour ago
 nice part is that the wiki is incredibly portable
1 hour ago
 it's all stored in a single html file
1 hour ago
 I use Resilio Sync between my devices for multi-device editing
1 hour ago
 Oh yeah. I forgot that was a thing. Emoji image of 'joy' actually Resilio is on this computer too.
1 hour ago
 I also store it on Dropbox and Git for versioning.
1 hour ago
 (Resilio Sync in .sync stores versions for you as well)
1 hour ago
 You will have race conditions if you try to edit from two devices at the same time. This  may require a bit of legwork on your end, but it's no different than trying to edit the same word document from two devices. Google docs is probably one of the better collaborative editing tools i can think of (but, I strongly prefer to own my own data for a number of reasons).

1 hour ago
 Thanks for the help! I’ll look into it all and see what I can do with it.
1 hour ago
 I do like google docs. But I understand why you don’t.
1 hour ago
 I'm here to help; [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]] too!
