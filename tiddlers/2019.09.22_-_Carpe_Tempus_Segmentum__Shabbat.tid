title: 2019.09.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Shabbat

* Woke at 11
** My dreams are still out of control, intense, aggressive, anxiety-inducing, vivid, surreal. They merge the past with fantasy.
* Fireman Time!
* Read
** I've given up on writing. [[JHBFC]].
* WoW
* Family Time!
* We opened with a walk.
** My wife had a huge showing again. She is in her element again. $10 says it's the best Sunday School class in the state.
** My offspring reflected on their experiences with us. It reminds me very much of my own upbringing, but without rhetoric and malicious apology. 
* Began writing our [[Family Log]]
* My wife needed a nap. We all took a nap! Lol.
* Finished the log, this took us a long time. It kept spawning conversations out of quiet periods.
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the Gods!
* Hummus, deli, fruit, coffee, and I've been on a water kick.
* One-on-one's
* Wikis
** Oh man, absolute garbage from my offspring. Thankfully, my wife cheers me up with her wiki. Delicious.
* WoW
* Read
* Walk and talk with myself.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 3:30
