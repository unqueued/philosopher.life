title: 2016.12.07 - Keeping My Enemies Closer: We are Intelligent

Don't we love this section? Let's pat ourselves on the back.

A strong habit and meme that permeates our family is having the wisdom to recognize how often and to what degree we’ve failed to be intelligent or wise over the course of our lives; we evaluate ourselves and see our limits in an honest way that others often do not and very often cannot. Sometimes we are too critical, and sometimes we think too highly of ourselves or thoughts. In my opinion, having the humility to consistently recognize this flaw in ourselves has been one of our family’s greatest assets (and sometimes source of pain).

Our overexcitable sensitivity to the world around us is the first step in a psychological equation describing why we are relatively smart (let’s keep patting ourselves on the back). That sensitivity, to being wrong for example, has led to our intermittent ability to be humble enough to honestly evaluate ourselves. It is the fundamental, evolutionarily selected-for, underlying physiological explanation of our intelligence.

Being smart means our sensitivity causes us to generate very specialized, highly information entropic, yet deeply patterned ideas, beliefs, and inferences. Essentially, being smart means we have very specified reality maps, and it makes sense that we are mathematically more likely to clash, find incongruence, or feel incompatible.
