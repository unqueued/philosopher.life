[11:48 PM] h0p3: I have no idea.
[1:47 PM] h0p3: How's life going?
[8:55 PM] robotic_scarab: (it's going! some days are better than others.)
[8:55 PM] robotic_scarab: HOLY SHIT the ascii art on your home page is incredible
[8:56 PM] h0p3: Ups and down, I hear that!
[8:56 PM] robotic_scarab: it's yin and yang and roots and trees and BRAAAIIIIINNNNSSS :smile:
[8:56 PM] h0p3: I love that you see brains in there. That's exactly what I see. Yin yang, yggdrasil, and brains.
[8:58 PM] h0p3: I think there are dolphins or fetuses in there too. I added eyes for fun, but it takes away from it.
[8:58 PM] h0p3: (also, I am drunk, lol)
[9:00 PM] robotic_scarab: ooo yes I can see the fetus resemblance too
[9:00 PM] robotic_scarab: the roots look like blood vessels
