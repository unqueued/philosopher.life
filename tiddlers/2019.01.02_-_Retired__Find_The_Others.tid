//Develop a profoundly moral relationship with Others, [[h0p3]]. Make The Others a part of you deep down. Humbly construct yourself with The Other as yourself.//

Hello Other, stranger, outsider, foreigner, alien, and possible friend:

Well met! Are you okay? Tell me what's wrong. Do you need my help? Let me help you. Are you in danger? Let me succor you. Are you hurt? Let me heal you as best I can. Are you hungry or thirsty? Here, take mine. Welcome, weary traveler or angel! Come in, please. Would you like a place to rest? Let me shelter you. Allow me to wash your feet. Let us break bread together. Please accept my hospitality and sign of peace! 

At once, you are my tribe, my family, my Humanity, my Otherest of Others! We stand on hallowed ground. I seek myself and the world in you. Let us [[righteously|The Right]] come bearing the message of ourselves with each other. Let us passionately empathize with each other; let us never treat each other as mere means to anything except [[The Good]] itself.<<ref "ni">>

I invoke [[The Moral Law]] on your behalf! I [[hope]] to treat you as though you're a stranger I paradoxically know to be [[myself|h0p3]] or greater. You are my honored guest. I hope to be humble and kind to you. I beg you forgive my rudeness, illiteracies, lack of grace, and ignorance. Please, be at home with me. I don't even know how much I don't know you, but it is my pleasure to meet you.

This wiki is a sign of many things, and I [[hope]] peace is profoundly one of the signified. I freely offer you my hospitality without predicting your reciprocity.<<ref "e">> I aim to be anciently hospitable to you out in this desert, fellow nomad. I'm here to help you even if you can't help me; it's [[The Golden Rule]]. I blindly and nakedly search for The Others. I [[hope]] you define me.

Yes, it is true: not everyone deserves my personal hospitality. I have failed to offer hospitality to those who deserve it too. Furthermore, I have failed to be truly hospitable if I have not unconditionally offered it to everyone I meet in the digital desert.<<ref "i">> The remnant of Humanity distributed in the human species is exactly who deserves my hospitality. For the sake of the moral law, It/They,<<ref "m">> and hopefully you, are why I must: be radically hospitable, freely and anonymously offer my generosity, provide my Straussian steelman charity, forgive transgressions and miscommunications, heap burning coals, let the guilty go free in doubt, and bend over backwards to empathize and cooperate.

//Find The Others//<<ref "t">> is one of the [[Axioms of h0p3]]. I hope to help the helpless (may you call forth my very best!), and if you aren't helpless, then I [[hope]] to have the chance for further cooperation and building trust with you in xenial [[T42T]] fashion. Seriously, let's form a friendship that matters by mystically transcending mere reciprocal altruism. Let us learn from each other, experience the world through each other's eyes, empathize, and truly love //The Other// as best as we can not just for ourselves but for each other. 

This is a [[diamond]] in the [[redpill]]ed art. This is where I find and demonstrate merit in constructing society, in being social, in being a good citizen of humanity. This is about finding the Kantian flavors, neurotribes, and cultures residing in humanity, those meme-carriers who are truly doing their moral best, separating the sufficiently virtuous wheat-angels from chaff-thieves. I'm sifting humans, including myself, for persons; I sift persons for friends or those who need my help.<<ref "bg">> This is a method for participating in [[The Original Position]]. 

In my [[fff]] pursuit of those ends in themselves, I can only be so forgiving. There is a point where I must stop turning the other cheek; I owe that to myself as a consequence of rationally respecting my own human dignity. I aim to be both hospitable to and suspicious of all strangers I meet. In part, this wiki is meant to be a reified instrument for that task. I flee from or fight those who consistently make me feel all alone. I want to be your friend, and this wiki is meant to be a bridge between us.

It's just a fact that I can't ultimately care what everyone thinks. I have to pursue the approval of those whose approval (whether they literally approve, understand, or recognize me or not) actually has merit, particularly in my context. I'm seeking the approval of ideal persons, however impossible that may be. I hope to scale and mold myself all the way down to the particularities of the moral requirements of our shared context.

Admittedly, only a narrow scope of humanity really speaks my language. I tend to be profoundly illiterate as an autist. Our models are different. I hope you can forgive me because I try to forgive you for not speaking my language. I believe that by honestly uploading my mind into my wiki, we both have access to an enriched network of references for generating accurate theories of each other's minds. I don't know of a better way for an autist to Find The Other in themselves and the world.

I'm listening, nomad.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
