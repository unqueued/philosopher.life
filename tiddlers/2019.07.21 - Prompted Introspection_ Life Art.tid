title: 2019.07.21 - Prompted Introspection: Life Art

!! What kind of art is your favorite? Why?

I'm afraid I still don't know how to satisfactorily define [[Art]]. As [[chameleon]] points out, I've a maximalist interpretation. In practice, using my wiki is my favorite; it is a type of art I would argue (and [[others]] seem to agree with as well). I can't say it's always enjoyable, but it is transformative, [[power]]ful in my life, and important to me. I like thinking about other people's wikis and personal sites as well, especially since I don't quite know how to do this well enough (and, I suspect I never will).

Of course, I could go broader and say [[Computing]], which includes this [[monster]]. It's hard not to see this as definitionally better. The origins of my favorites, particularly insofar as they are necessary, seem to snowball into my next favorite.

Life is my favorite art, but I have mixed feelings about it, no doubt. Sir Nietzsche would be proud, right?<<ref "n">>
