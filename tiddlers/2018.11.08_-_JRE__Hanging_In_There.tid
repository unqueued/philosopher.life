Hey dude. I know today's the day. I am here to listen.
WED 3:43 PM
I hope it goes well.

I called my brother up. Apparently, he called last night, but it still didn't go through. I wish I knew; I know he could use someone to listen to him. I was lucky enough to be able to listen today.

He walked me through the courtroom trial. Raylan (he corrected me for going too "lin" before, but now it is too "lan" -- I will find the right middleground soon enough!), was an added on case. Their departure was heartbreaking. The boy wouldn't even let my brother give him a kiss goodbye, said he wouldn't cry about it, etc. Of course, he had no idea what he was saying, and my brother knew that. It was a painful day. That boy is a billion times better off because they helped him, even though he'll never know it. 

My brother's boss is an asshole. That goes for both my brothers. Capitalism and people in general suck. =(

My brother was interested in my new friend. We talked a bit. 

My brother is very sleepy. He can feel the depression, and wants his meds upped to max. I'm hoping that the pain will start to pass some here. I think the freedom will do him a lot of good; he could use a breath of fresh air from the surface (he's been drowning for a while). There is another hurdle with Rebecca, and I suppose a lot of how things play out rest upon her shoulders here.
