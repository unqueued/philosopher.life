It's a pleasure to meet you. I [[hope]] we'll become [[good]] friends.<<ref "g">> I'm {[[contact]]}ing you out of the blue because I'm moved by several of your projects. Please let me know if I can {[[help]]} you, [[nomad|Find The Others]].

I'm openly pre-registering with you a future letter about your work.<<ref "r">> You can watch how I model you and draft my letters to you here: https://philosopher.life/#MPXN.<<ref "t">> Go ahead and hold me accountable to it. Despite what may be significant disagreement, I think we share a great deal in common. It appears we share similar visions. I need some time to think about who you are and what you've said, sir. In case it would matter to you, I wanted to give you the same opportunity.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
