title: 2017.12.09 -- Wiki Audit Log: About+Vault Split

!! SO:

* My brother is not enjoying the story river visual mechanic. I'm making it cleaner. I think we will all appreciate the functionality improvement, even if it is doesn't look as beautiful.
* I feel like I want to do both {[[About]]} and {[[Vault]]} 1-depth. I'm going to try and do both today, starting with the vault. 
* Uh, I feel like I have to repeat this: you have the energy to do this work while you are high.

!! FO:

* [[Chicago]]
** Done.
* [[Louisville]]
** More work to do, but it now has at least a minimal narrative flow.
* {[[About]]}
** I figured out that I need to be more aggressive about pasting in the old copy bits at a time. I have a scaffold, and I should climb it.
** I keep condensing my random thoughts into the germs of important topics.
** So far, I'm extremely pleased with my work in this section. 
** The good part is that when I feel stuck, I have so much to do that I can just go work elsewhere in the document.
