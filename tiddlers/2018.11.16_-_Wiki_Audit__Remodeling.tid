title: 2018.11.16 - Wiki Audit: Remodeling

I continue to break a lot of linkage. I think I should be even slower to use [[Alias]]es than I have been. I'm going to let [[Wiki Review]] go. Things change too much for me to try to continually fix that. I think this is likely something which should be automatically fixed if it is ever fixed.

Tagging proving itself necessary yet again: [[2017.04.26 - Philosophipolitical Prescription: Social Networks Worth Joining]]. Clearly, this is a precursor to [[FTO Log]].

I have pseudo-orphans that are basically only linked to by a [[Wiki Review]]. Perhaps I need an automated tool to check for pseudo-orphans. This is a shortcut and a necessary thing to look for. [[Wiki Review]] cannot be the anchor because it is just a loose grid/spiderwebbing that should only sit on top and never beneath.

[[2017.04.27 - Wiki Review Log]] comment at the bottom. /smh. Omg. I feel so dumb.

2017.04 is complete. I am, of course, moving glacially through this.
