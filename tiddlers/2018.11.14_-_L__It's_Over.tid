title: 2018.11.14 - L: It's Over

```
You did it! =)
WED 2:37 PM
It's over.
WED 2:37 PM
How you feeling?
WED 2:37 PM
Hmm.. like I need a vacation.
WED 2:38 PM
Good thing one’s just around the corner! :D
WED 2:38 PM
:D
WED 2:38 PM
You feel some weight life off your shoulders?
WED 2:39 PM
Also, the people I held the event for said that was the best one they’d been to yet. So fuck everyone who complained about it the whole time.
WED 2:39 PM
Somewhat yeah. My department still seems frantic.
WED 2:39 PM
Lol
WED 2:39 PM
But that’s on them now. My part is done.
WED 2:39 PM
Time to look for a new job...
WED 2:39 PM
You tell your boss already?
WED 2:40 PM
Not yet. She’s out sick so she missed our 1-on-1 today.
WED 2:40 PM
-_-
WED 2:40 PM
You able to work from home today?
WED 2:41 PM
Two side notes: 
(1) [[K]] got a raise today — a whole extra $1/hour
(2) I haven’t forgotten about our D&D game but I DID forget to update you and [[k0sh3k]] cause I’m a dingus.
WED 2:41 PM
Noice!
WED 2:41 PM
Ah, don't worry. You've been insanely busy.
WED 2:41 PM
It's a long-term project.
WED 2:41 PM
For our D&D game, I want to hold it in January. I think by then I should have enough laid out we can get somewheres
WED 2:41 PM
That sounds good.
WED 2:42 PM
Also, [[K]] and I have decided to connect our worlds so that should be cool. >:3
WED 2:42 PM
Plus, I'm going to be getting cheap gaming machines for the kids setup to run alongside their linux machines (I believe...may still do all-in-one).
WED 2:42 PM
Back to your question: yes, I am working from home. No fuckin way am I coming in the office lol
WED 2:42 PM
So, that may ease some of the burden.
WED 2:42 PM
Noice :3
WED 2:42 PM
I am glad you are home. Fuck the office.
WED 2:42 PM
Lol, I will be interested to see how you weave the worlds together.
WED 2:43 PM
You have signal on your desktop/laptop?
WED 2:43 PM
I have no idea how it’s gonna work, but I think it’ll help.
WED 2:43 PM
I do!

WED 2:43 PM
[[j3d1h]] helped me do the art.
WED 2:43 PM
Oh man
WED 2:44 PM
I tried opening it on my phone anyways. That was a mistake. XAd
WED 2:44 PM
XD*
WED 2:44 PM
Imma stop being lazy and actually open it
WED 2:45 PM
Been trying more keyboards out to become a better typist on my phone. Ran across a hilarious one called Minuum. You should check it out. The ultra-slim keyboard has like 9 keys on it with massive prediction. It's a weird experience.
WED 2:46 PM
I despise relying upon prediction, but I'm pretty sure it's my only option.
WED 2:46 PM
Well, I hope life slows down considerably for you. Past couple weeks have been hellish for you.
WED 2:54 PM
I also hate prediction because I spell words SUPER weird on purpose sometimes.
WED 2:57 PM
Also, that text art is AWESOME
WED 2:58 PM
Like, damn
WED 2:58 PM
And I hope it does too. If it doesn’t, I’m taking a vacation to force it to slow down lol.
WED 2:58 PM
Have you heard word back about your after school job yet? :o
WED 3:04 PM
Not yet.
WED 3:05 PM
=(
WED 3:05 PM
It's okay. I'm still applying. I'm actually feeling better about it.
WED 3:05 PM
I've got a process that I can optimize and grow.
WED 3:05 PM
I totally understand the weird spelling thing. I have no idea how to improve the interface in that respect.
WED 3:06 PM
I'm using gboard, and you have to choose the predictions, they are never forced on you.
WED 3:07 PM
I think that is the best middle ground I can find.
WED 3:07 PM
I am surprised work is still frantic after the big presentation.
WED 3:08 PM
I’m glad you feel better about it and that you’re still looking. I may need to borrow some of that feeling here soon.
WED 3:11 PM
And, they’re frantic because apparently an update we made to the system recently broke the whole thing
WED 3:12 PM
And it’s affecting others too.
WED 3:12 PM
Ah, lol. Yeah
WED 3:12 PM
QA is shittin bricks
WED 3:12 PM
Totally.
WED 3:13 PM
We only had to shut down one portion, but it’s a SUPER important portion.
WED 3:13 PM
But there’s not a ton we could do to catch it. We have a lot of processing that has to occur over the weekend and it apparently broke then. We don’t do stress tests on new functionality when we test them before releases...
WED 3:14 PM
We SHOULD, but we don’t. It’s stupid.
