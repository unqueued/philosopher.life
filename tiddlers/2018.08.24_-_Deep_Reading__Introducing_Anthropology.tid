title: 2018.08.24 - Deep Reading: Introducing Anthropology

I'm glad they talk about postmodernism and the historical roots of it in their discipline. It's clear me that this field has shaped the conversation I've heard quite a bit. 

As usual, we've started to hit the philosophical points where anthropologists and I disagree. Ethics ain't easy, homie.
