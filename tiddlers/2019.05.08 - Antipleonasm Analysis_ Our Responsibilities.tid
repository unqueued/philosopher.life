title: 2019.05.08 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Our Responsibilities

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
We're dealing with real human beings who are suffering and dying and being tortured and starving because of policies that we are involved in, we as citizens of democratic societies are directly involved in and are responsible for, and what the media are doing is ensuring that we do not act on our responsibilities, and that the interests of power are served, not the needs of the suffering people, and not even the needs of the American people who would be horrified if they realized the blood that's dripping from their hands because of the way they are allowing themselves to be deluded and manipulated by the system.

I agree those in power are profoundly responsible, including how they manipulate [[The Great Human Conversation]]. But, I'm also going to emphasize our collective responsibility to push back against memetic warfare and the centralization of power. I find very few people who don't ultimately bury their head in the sand and conveniently convince themselves they are powerless. If you have an internet connection, you have the ability to explore to get closer to the truth. People are maliciously, willfully ignorant to non-trivial [[dok]]. [[Saint Chomsky]] is correct: people are allowing themselves to be deluded.

A sufficient percentage of people have to value the truth so highly that they reshape their lives, engineering completely different versions of their extended material identities. I'm aware that the odds are ridiculously slim, but that is the only [[hope]] I see for our species.
