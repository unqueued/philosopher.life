title: 2013.02.28 -- Moral Psych: Week 7 Reading Notes

Cognitive science is vindicating sentimentalism in metaethics.

Neurosentimentalism – moral judgment depends on tacit affective processes

Kennett and Gerrans argue against neurosentimentalism, claiming it divorces moral/practical judgment from moral/practical agency.

Amnesics display decision making based on rules application which they can’t recall previous applications of, and employ acquired information that is no longer explicit to them.

ventromedial prefrontal cortex - a mechanism forassociating tacit affective responses with explicitly-represented information, thereby enabling the formation of preferences and decision making

judgement synchronic theories – includes explicit procedural reasoning or tacit affect processing

Agency requires episodic memory and imaginative projection into the future- to have intertemporal perspective on actions

Why must “A moral agent needs to be able to conceive of herselfas a temporally extended entity as a necessary condition for moral reflection and decision-making.”?

Dilemma: “Neurosentimenal-ism requires that eithermoral judgement does not require agencyor amnesics and ventromedial patients can be moral agents.”



Dual Processing Theories

Iowa Gambling Task – learning and retrieving value of decks involves tacit processes

Tacit and explicit processes dissociate, and the tacit processes might be cognitively impenetrable (unable to be to explicated or modified by explicit reasoning processes).

Sentimentalists vs Externalists – The role of affective processes is high in one, but limited in the other. Vice versa for procedural rationality.

“Sentimentalists and rationalistexternaliststhus disagree on where in cognition moral judgement occurs but they agree on the cognitive impenetrability of the automatic processes which provide motivation.”

Rationalistinternalists hold that the link between moral judgement and motivation is necessary

“A person, such as an amnesic, who cannot incorporate procedural judgements or affective preferencesas her ownis not an agent. The reason is that she cannot represent the results of these processes to herself, because she is not a diachronic self but a bundle of habits linked to a synchronic reasoning system”

Autobiographical memory is different from pure episodic memory

Autonoesis - that aspect of self consciousness which annexes experience to the self not just at as ime, but over time. We might describe it as awareness of diachronicselfhood.

Autobiogrpahical requires “feeling o rightness” – requires affective processes?

Planning is the activity of a diachronic self.

Prospection - the future-directed analogue of episodic memory - imaginative rehearsal

mental time travel does not exploit different systems for memory and imagination

“essential feature of mental time travel is theability to create and recreate these experiences under voluntary controlrather than via the presentation of an eliciting situation or object”

“decision-making involves mental time travel. That is to say the subjectremembers what happened last time and uses that information tocreate and inhabit a future scenario. In contrast a patient with ventro-medial damage cannot perform mental time travel. Not because she lacks an episodic database but because she cannot make use of it”



Bratman’s agency, we are temporally extended agents, planners and commitment makers.

Diachronic reasons compete with synchronic desires. Diachronic reasons are normative for us.

Moral judgement can only be made by those who meet a threshold of moral agency

“Where the capacity for mental time travel is seriously damaged there is no sense in which the individual might besaid to be shaping her own life or acting on the basis of reasons over enough time so as to satisfy the threshold for moral agency.”

Patient M.L., N.N.



I grant, agency is impaired for these folks – moral planning is significant. Is it agency all gone though? Are they implying these people aren’t moral agents at all? Where emotional valence is no longer associated with reasoning processes, I can see where rational deliberation might be impaired.

They do seem to be minimal moral agents, possibly.



“Mental time travel is the mechanism by which we acquire the phe-nomenology of a temporally extended self with an integrated past,present, and future. What ventromedial patients lose is not just the ability to plan but the prerequisite sense of diachronic selfhood intim-ately connected with an autobiography with a distinctive emotional character. This provides an explanation of the observed incapacity of ventromedial patients to translate their impersonal social judge-ments — the products of explicit reasoning — into personal practical judgements. They have lost the sense of the ‘I’ to whom the judgement is to be indexed so they literally don’t know what to do.”
