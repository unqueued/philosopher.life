!! Tell about one of your father-daughter/son activities.

I adore [[Family Time]], and I'm grateful for the opportunity to homeschool. Yes, my offspring sometimes drive me insane (probably into psychosis). We have an incredible range of emotions with each other. Our lives are intense together. I believe I've already spent more time with my children than most parents do over the course of their lives. We have sacrificed to be here, and we've been absurdly lucky to have the chance at all. 

My brother, [[JRE]], sometimes feels sorry for them. They are trapped in a house with me every day. I'm a savage, a tyrant, and an absurdist fool. But, my children have a sick introduction to a world most people never even get to see. My brother says he would not been willing to help my son as much as I have; I do not know if that is true. It's true that [[1uxb0x]] requires just as much energy to interpret as I do, and I'm uniquely positioned to help him in the way that I do. I think my brother is clearly better at being a parent to my son than I am in several respects; we'd get different results because we have different material to work with.

I'm trying to figure out the right balance. Hopefully, I can find it in time.
