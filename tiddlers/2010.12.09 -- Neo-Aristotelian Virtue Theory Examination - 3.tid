title: 2010.12.09 -- Neo-Aristotelian Virtue Theory Examination - 3

''[1][a]''

McDowell argues against the codifiability of the virtuous agent’s views as universalized principles or rules which serve as the major premise in his hypothetical syllogism. He asserts an internalist view of ethics, whereby the justification and explanation for ‘what is right’ flows out from the virtuous agent into the external world. From this view, it seems that if anything or anyone could serve as an objective mechanism for universalizing principles it would have to be the mind of the virtuous agent. McDowell argues that the mind of the virtuous agent is not this mechanism and that the virtuous agent’s complete set of thoughts and views cannot be universalized. Consequently, given both his internalism and anti-codifiabilism, McDowell is pointing towards the impossibility of universal, independently objective moral truth. He defends this thesis:

<<<
As Aristotle consistently says, the best generalizations about how one should behave hold only for the most part….If one attempted to reduce one’s conception of what virtue requires to a set of rules, then, however subtle and thoughtful one was in drawing up the code, cases would inevitably turn up in which a mechanical application of the rules would strike one as wrong—and not necessarily because one had changed one’s mind; rather, one’s mind on the matter was not susceptible of capture in any universal formula.<<ref "1">>
<<< 

	The very nature of the virtuous agent’s mind and reason cannot be algorithmically captured and defined. Even if one were to attempt to algorithmically explicate the virtuous mind, or even if the virtuous agent were herself to provide accurate generalizations of morality, one would somehow find exceptions in these mechanistic rules. The rules would not, in all possible cases, match what the virtuous person would actually do. Likely, this isn’t a practical point either, whereby he is claiming we simply lack the ability to physically formulate universalized morality - this is a much stronger point about theoretical possibility. Namely, no matter how complex and detailed the algorithm or set of rules generated, one can never possibly capture all of moral reality or what is inside the mind of the virtuous agent. Virtue, as far as it can be conceptually abstracted from the Virtuous person, is not algorithmic. (That strikes me as saying that morality, in some sense, isn’t rational! I’m sure he thinks this article is meant for someone like me.)  

Note the order of this argument (as from what I can see, it is different from the Wittgensteinian argument presented later) – it is because the mind of the virtuous person isn’t algorithmic or mechanistic (I’m not sure how you can be a naturalist if you believe this – nature, from this view, should be reducible to one gigantic physical algorithm), in conjunction with the rightness-making primacy of the virtuous character inhering in the virtuous agent, that we can know that there isn’t a universal, algorithmic formula which can flow out to the external world. 

McDowell continues to argue against universal formulas and externalism, but via a different route. This one is not founded on the idea that the virtuous mind isn’t algorithmic directly (which may simply be a brute fact in his pseudo-naturalistic philosophy of mind and intentionality), but rather on the notion that the psychological state in the mind of the virtuous agent doesn’t correspond to anything universal and independent of the agent. There is no universal algorithm, and consequently, no need for the notion of a corresponding rule in our minds. He says:

<<<
Rationality requires consistency; a specific conception of rationality in a particular area imposes a specific view of what counts as going on doing the same thing here. The prejudice is the idea that acting in the light of a specific conception of rationality must be explicable in terms of being guided by a formulable universal principle. This prejudice comes under radical attack in Wittgenstein’s discussion, in the Philosophical Investigations, of the concept of following a rule.<<ref "2">> 
<<<

	McDowell wishes to attack the very notion of following a rule. In demonstrating skepticism of rule-following in general, he can establish why universal moral rule-following is fundamentally flawed. He uses an argument from Wittgenstein to smother the possibility of consistently following objective universal rules.  McDowell explains:

<<<
Consider an exercise of rationality in which there is a formulable rule, of which each successive action can be regarded as an application, appropriate in the circumstances arrived at: say (Wittgenstein’s example) the extending of a series of numbers. We tend to picture the understanding of the instruction ‘Add 2’---command of the rule for extending the series 2, 4, 6, 8,…---as a psychological mechanism which, aside from lapses of attention and so forth, churns out the appropriate behavior with the sort of reliability which a physical mechanism, say a piece of clock, might have.<<ref "3">>
<<<

	The mathematical, universal rule of ‘add 2’, which is paralleled to the notion of a universal moral rule, is captured and instantiated with in a mind, what he terms as a ‘psychological mechanism’. This is a particular person’s attempt to apprehend, interpret, mimic and ‘follow’ that independent universal rule. The psychological mechanism is our personal rule which is supposed to mirror the universal rule; the universal rule is an abstract blueprint of the engine, and the psychological mechanism is an instantiation of it.

The process starts with a specific circumstance, namely your location on the number line (the minor premise in the syllogism), input into this psychological mechanism (a cognitive imprint of the abstract universal major premise) which serves to digest the circumstantial input and consistently produce the appropriate answer (conclusion), in this case a mathematical computation to the next point on the number line (parallel to a moral theory taking an input of the circumstances and outputting the right moral decision/action). The psychological mechanism, if it correctly mimics the blueprint of the universal rule, will mechanically output the appropriate answer. 

There is a normative relationship between the psychological mechanism and the universal rule. Correctness is judged by the accuracy of a particular psychological mechanism’s mimetic relationship to the blueprint of the universal rule. If the instantiation fails to mimic the blueprint with all possible inputs, then one is said to have the ‘wrong rule’ in mind. If you have the right rule in mind, whereby your instantiation mirrors the blueprint completely, then your psychological mechanism is correct, and it will always produce the appropriate answers.

Note how McDowell’s choice to use Wittgenstein’s example and criticize the foundation of following a simple mathematical algorithm, if successful, would undermine the following of moral algorithms as well. Surely if one can be skeptical about psychological mechanisms being justified in ‘following rules’ of mathematics, what is usually considered an exemplar subject matter for what is patently obvious and clearly universally true, the same can be said of the uncertainty of rule-following for any psychological mechanism, including some subject matter as difficult and (I suppose for some people) unobvious as universalized ethics. The attack goes:

<<<
Suppose the person says, when asked what he is doing, ‘Look, I’m adding 2 each time.’ This apparent manifestation of understanding (or any other) will have been accompanied, at any point, by at most a finite fragment of the potentially infinite range of behavior which we want to say the rule dictates.<<ref "4">>
<<<

	There are an infinite number of possible instantiations, and this person has but one. His instantiation, namely his psychological mechanism, may or may not match the universal blueprint. How would we know if his psychological mechanism follows the universal rule? Furthermore, from this one of infinitely many possible instantiations of the universal rule, it is clear that any particular iteration, application, or computation cycle may produce any possible result. It seems that with an infinite number of instantiations of the universal rule, there will also be an infinite number of possible answers that might be given in a specific circumstance. This makes it tricky to compare instantiations, as perhaps given an arbitrarily large finite series of tests they will appear to employ the same algorithm, given an infinite series of tests, we will find they don’t. McDowell continues:

<<<
Thus the evidence for the presence of the pictured state is always compatible with the supposition that, on some future occasion for its exercise, the behavior elicited by the occasion will diverge from what we would count as correct.
<<<

	From outer appearances and testing, someone might appear to have a psychological mechanism which matches and acts in accordance with the universal rule, in this case ‘add 2’.  But, since we aren’t testing his psychological mechanism at every possible circumstance (every point on the number line), testing a finite set of points on the number line rather than the infinite set of points, we can’t really know if a person has objectively ‘followed the rule’ by having matched the blueprint. Perhaps, in the future, a person’s particular psychological mechanism may not result in acts in accordance with the universal rule ‘add 2’. How are we to know? McDowell continues:

<<<
Wittgenstein dramatizes this with the example of the man who continues the series, after 1,000, with 1,004, 1,008,…If a possibility of the 1,004, 1,008, …type were to be realized (and we could not bring the person to concede that he had simply made a mistake), that would show that the behavior hitherto was not guided by the psychological conformation which we were picturing as guiding it. The pictured state, then, always transcends the grounds on which it is allegedly postulated.<<ref "5">>
<<<

The man is //apparently //matching the blueprint of the universal rule, ‘add 2’, in each circumstance up to 1000; when he begins to diverge, we would be tempted to say he is //wrong//, that his psychological mechanism is incompatible with the blueprint of the universal rule ‘add 2’.  He insists, however, that he is correctly following the rule ‘add 2’, that his psychological mechanism really matches the rule ‘add 2’, and he will claim that we are the ones who lack objectivity.  If, then, we can have been wrong in our belief that this person, whose behavior has become aberrant, was previously following the rule, how can we be sure that another individual, whose behavior has not (so far) strayed is, in fact, following the rule as we have conceptualized it. 

If we can doubt other peoples’ minds, then McDowell believes we can doubt our own. Why should we think that we are adhering to a universal rule? Furthermore, we have confidence in our expectations of peoples’ behavior, even without relying upon a psychological mechanism. The entire process of having a psychological mechanism which is supposed to mirror universal rules and dictate correct behavior is an illusion, or is, at least, untrustworthy. He continues:

<<<
[O]n reaching 1,000, the person goes on as we expect, with 1,002, 1,004,…, but with a sense of dissociation from what he is doing. What he does no longer strikes him as going on in the same way; it feels as if a sheer habit has usurped his reason in controlling his behaviour. We confidently expect that this sort of thing will not happen; once again, postulation of a psychological mechanism does nothing to underwrite this confidence.<<ref "6">>
<<<

We don’t need the psychological mechanism to be confident of the consistency of anyone’s behavior. Even a person who appears to be ‘following a rule’ may not – perhaps it just habit (exactly how this isn’t a type of psychological mechanism is very unclear to me). 

McDowell’s point is that the actuality of the circumstance transcends our rule-making capability.  That is, there is an infinite range of circumstances (each point on the number line) which we want to cover with a universal rule.  McDowell believes there will always be, however, possible circumstances along that range that do not fit within the boundaries that can be covered by a universal rule.  The idea is that the same holds true for our conceptions of universal ethical standards – the reality of the situations we face will always be beyond our ability to formulate rules. 

According to McDowell, we can’t have confidence in the psychological mechanism to adhere to the universal rule. There is no universal rule to which to adhere. The hypothetical existence of the psychological mechanism does not save us from ‘vertigo’ (discussed further below). Our confidence in others’ actions are based on something else entirely, namely the forms of life. McDowell’s coup de grâce:

<<<
[There is] a congruence of subjectivities, with the congruence not grounded as it would need to be to amount to an objectivity. So we feel we have lost the objectivity of (in our case) mathematics (and similarly in other cases). We recoil from this vertigo into the idea that we are kept on the rails by our grasp of rule. This idea has a pair of twin components: first, the idea (as above) that grasp of the rules is a psychological mechanism which (apart from mechanical failure, which is how we picture mistakes and so forth) guarantees that we stay in the straight and narrow; and, second, the idea that the rails—what we engage our mental wheels with when we come to grasp the rules—are objectively there, in a way which transcends the ‘mere’ sharing of forms of life…This composite idea is not the perception of some truth, but a consoling myth, elicited from us by our inability to endure the vertigo.<<ref "7">>
<<<

	All that rule-following, McDowell says, is just an illusion. There are no universal principles, and we can’t follow them. The psychological mechanism is unnecessary. He claims that his challengers may not like that fact, and they might undergo ‘vertigo’, feeling unable to make sense of objectivity, truth, and rationality.
  
Somehow his challengers are wrong about the nature of reason, about what counts as ‘consistency’, and about the primacy of the external, objective world. His vertiginous challengers are artificially imposing this algorithmic conceptual framework on rationality. 
If there is no psychological mechanism necessary to apprehend correct behavior in a given situation, how does one acquire an ability to do what appears like ‘adding 2’?  If a student is taught, through the use of specific examples, how to ‘add 2’, how does that student then go on to other situations in which it is necessary to ‘add 2’ and do so correctly?  One might assume that the student infers from the given examples a universal rule of ‘add 2’ that is later applied to appropriate situations.  McDowell argues, however, that this deductive paradigm is unnecessary; rather, the student, through the given situations, develops a sensitivity to similar situations, and understands that the appropriate thing to do is to add two.  The student does not need some psychological mechanism to apprehend some illusory universal rule; instead, the student develops the sensitivity necessary to act in given situations through involvement with the shared forms of life.<<ref "8">>  How this sensitivity isn’t still a form of pattern recognition and abstract rule-formation, perhaps even a well-hidden psychological mechanism in his theory, is very unclear to me (I stand rightly accused of this vertigo; I bask in it). I’m unsure how a congruence of subjectivities will result in a form of objectivity, as well. Regardless, McDowell believes has a better conceptual framework for the nature of reason, maintaining its consistency without resorting to objective universal rules. He plows forward:

There is nothing but shared forms of life to keep us, as it were, on the rails.<<ref "9">>

The truth is that is it only because of our own involvement in our ‘whirl of organism’ that we can understand the words we produce as conferring that special compellingness on the judgment explained.<<ref "10">> 

Contemplating the dependence should not include vertigo at all. We cannot be whole-heartedly engaged in the relevant parts of the ‘whirl of organism’, and at the same time achieve the detachment necessary in order to query whether our unreflective view of what we are doing is illusory. The cure for the vertigo, then, is to give up the idea that philosophical thought, about the sorts of practice in question, should be undertaken at some external standpoint, outside our immersion in our familiar forms of life.<<ref "11">>

	Instead of relying upon some illusory objectivity and rule-following, McDowell presents us with the real conceptual framework, the ‘whirl of organism’ and the ‘forms of life’. Only in these subjective contexts does he believe we can muster a sense of true objectivity and consistent reasoning, particularly for morality.

Circling back, by attacking the notion of rule-following, McDowell believes he’s demonstrated why ethics is uncodifiable, and how his internalism and the reliable sensitivity of the virtuous agent, as a subjective approach within forms of life, make sense. In the ultimate analysis, McDowell thinks there is nothing that transcends one’s particularities and form of life. Morality is not independently objective; it is subjective to the forms of life. Rule-based thinking requires justification for why things are right, in some way, while McDowell believes the Virtuous agent, as he lays the notion out, is a much better justification for why things are right. 

'' [b]''

Part of McDowell’s argument is spent attempting to secure his theory against the accusation of non-cognitivism, that ethical statements aren’t the sorts of propositions which are either true or false, and that consequently, virtue ethics isn’t moral knowledge and the decision procedure of virtuous agent aren’t really rational and objective. The cognitive process he claims the virtuous agent employs is //reliable sensitivity//:

<<<
[V]irtue, in general, is: an ability to recognize requirements which situations impose on one’s behavior. It is a single complex sensitivity of this sort which we are aiming to instill when we aim to inculcate a moral outlook.<<ref "12">>
<<<

<<<
It is by virtue of [the virtuous agent’s] seeing this particular fact rather than that one as the salient fact about the situation that he is moved to act by this concern rather than that one.<<ref "13">>
<<<

The virtuous agent’s reliable sensitivity serves a sort of perceptual cognitive device which can consistently pick out what is relevant in a situation. For example, the virtuous agent encounters a circumstance which contains some number of relevant and irrelevant moral factors. What counts as being relevant seems to vary between circumstances, and so it takes a special sensitivity to know what matters. The virtuous agent’s reliable sensitivity allows him to focus his concern upon only the salient factors of the circumstance, and it is from the recognition of the salient factors that the virtuous agent can understand how he should act. Again, this reliable sensitivity is somehow the sort of reasoning which can’t be captured within an algorithm (it’s super special somehow). The cognitive moral outlook of the virtuous agent is his reliable sensitivity. McDowell offers the object of this reliable sensitivity:

<<<
If we resist non-cognitivism, we can equate the conceptual equipment which forms the framework of anything recognizable as a moral outlook with a capacity to be impressed by certain aspects of reality. But ethical reality is immensely difficult to see clearly.<<ref "14">>
<<<

	Ethical reality is the set of salient features which a virtuous agent picks out in a circumstance. Assuming virtuous agents are rare, it really should be difficult to see ethical reality clearly because only the virtuous agent can see it clearly. When we join this argument with McDowell’s implementation of Wittgenstein, we see that the ‘form of life’, insofar as it is a normative description of circumstances, is part of the analysis of ethical reality. McDowell employs Stanley Cavell’s interpretation of Wittgenstein’s ‘forms of life’:

<<<
We learn and teach words in certain contexts, and then we are expected, and expect others, to be able to project them into further contexts. Nothing insures that this projection will take place (in particular, not the grasping of universals nor the grasping of books of rules), just as nothing insures that we will make, and understand, the same projections. That on the whole we do is a matter of our sharing routes of interest and feeling, modes of response, senses of humour and of significance and of fulfillment, of what is outrageous, of what is similar to what else, what a rebuke, what forgiveness, of when an utterance is an assertion, when an appeal, when an explanation—all the whirl of organism Wittgenstein calls ‘forms of life.’ Human speech and activity, sanity and community, rest upon nothing more, but nothing less, than this.<<ref "15">>
<<<

The ‘forms of life’ are the social spheres in which agents live. The norms, social cues, and mores of the society which surrounds an agent compose a form of life. A Catholic in Massachusetts has a certain form of life, and a Buddhist in a province of China has another form of life. Each form of life has its own expectations and controls which dictate for the virtuous agent what counts as salient ethical features of any given circumstance. The virtuous agent is the person who can recognize and be ‘impressed by’ the relevant factors of a situation from within his or her own form of life. A particular agent’s ethical reality is relative and subjective to whatever form of life in which he or she lives.

From what I can see, McDowell’s denial of rule-following does not sit well with his notion of ‘ethical reality’. First, I have no idea how McDowell can claim that reliable sensitivity isn’t a psychological mechanism (even if he wants to say there is only an illusory relationship to a made-up, non-existing universal rule). Reliability, by its very nature, points to ‘rules’. It is about a pattern. It is about following a certain expected order. Let him attempt to deny the existence of objective universal rules, but I don’t see how he can honestly say that the virtuous agent employs a cognitive process which isn’t a psychological mechanism. Of course, inherent to being a psychological mechanism is trying to follow rules; it is algorithmic in nature. I can’t make sense of something that is rational, and therefore consistent, but not algorithmic. I don’t see how the rational mind escapes being at least under the illusion that it follow rules – I think he must posit the existence of the psychological mechanism if he wishes to posit rationality. Of course, this doesn’t necessarily force his hand into postulating an actual universal rule; it can remain a mere ‘illusion’ for now. He claims his theory is cognitivist, but he did not maintain and support; I’m convinced his peddling disguised non-cognitivism.

My second problem is that I think he is assuming a type of universal rule, even when he thinks he isn’t. Ethical reality, as it is based on a form of life, still seems external. Sure, whatever the virtuous agent says is salient is what is salient, but what is salient to the virtuous agent is conditioned by a form of life. I believe we can solve this ‘chicken or egg’ problem; the form of life, insofar as it is an environment for social conditioning, is primitive to the virtuous agent in this process of reliable sensitivity. The form of life defines what does and doesn’t count as salient in a circumstance because it defines the virtuous agent, and whatever agents happen to be sensitive to the norms of a form of life are said to be virtuous. The society, the form of life, defines what is right. Here’s the kicker: each form of life is really its own sphere of rules, it has its own justice, and its own code of conduct.

By connecting the forms of life to ethical reality, McDowell has simply narrowed ethical objectivity from the universal scope to the subjective form of life. While he denies universal rules, the form of life serves as the new grounds of objectivity and the new ‘universal’ for McDowell’s theory. It seems that since the form of life is composed of rules and norms and mores, which in turn goes on to help define salience in this process of reliable sensitivity, then the virtuous agent is applying rules derived from his particular form of life to any given circumstance.  McDowell denies the ability to follow rules, but I believe he ends up with the virtuous agent following rules within a form of life. 

If virtuous agents are following rules, whereby there is psychological mechanism (reliable sensitivity) and some ‘universal rules’ (contained, conditioned, shaped, and defined by the forms of life to which virtuous agents belong), then I think McDowell’s notion of ethical reality does not sit well at all with his opposition to rule-following.

''[c]''

	McDowell’s Wittgensteinian view, specifically the use of the ‘forms of life’, seems deeply misguided to me; the form of life is just another way to explain moral relativism. I actually like the descriptive capacity of the notion of a ‘form of life’ because it requires us to recognize cultural differences, social conditioning, memetics, sociocybernetics, and many other complex and interesting things that go into making individuals and groups who they are. Just because ‘forms of life’ may have this descriptive capacity does not mean, however, it should serve in a normative capacity. 

	He thinks they serve in some normative capacity. A universal, objective moral reality is denied by McDowell. Reality, instead, is a set of forms of life, each form of life acting as a moral reality to its constituents. Reality is a bag of marbles, and each marble is a form of life. The bag says nothing universally normative, only the marble is normative within its own sphere. No form of life overlaps another, and each set of ethical values are independently justified.

It seems McDowell doesn’t believe we can normatively compare the values of one form of life to another. Each form of life is its own socially constructed moral system. Each form of life has its own way of doing things, and rightness-defining/salient factors of circumstances will vary based upon in which form of life an agent happens to find themselves. Perhaps a virtuous Buddhist from China will find some features of a circumstance salient where a virtuous Catholic from Massachusetts will not. Both are virtuous in their own forms of life, and neither can be said to be vicious, as we can only judge them according to their own form of life.  How is this not pointing to moral relativism? 

McDowell isn’t very clear about what separates one form of life from another. There may be an infinite number of possible forms of life. Couldn’t any action or belief be justified by some of the infinitely many forms of life? If so, this seems like moral relativism.

I have other questions too. What constitutes being in one form of life rather than another? What is the minimal scope of a form of life? How can you justify that scope – would you do it from within your own form of life? Even the mechanism of being in a form of life isn’t well described. For example, it doesn’t make sense to be in more than one form of life – salient features of different forms of life can be contradictory. Can you switch forms of life? I don’t know, perhaps some forms of life are ‘switchable’ and others aren’t. 

While no form of life has a universal scope, we aren’t sure exactly how particular a scope we can use in pointing out a form of life. Consider an example of the problems this creates. Being an American might be a broad form of life. What does it mean to be a Texan? That would be a narrower form of life, right? It would be overly simple, however, to assume that since Texas is a part of the United States that the Texan form of life is a subset of the American form of life. Note, perhaps being a virtuous Texan might be contradictory to being a virtuous American. For example, it might be a virtue of the American form of life to oppose the secession of any state from the United States. Being a virtuous Texan, on the other hand, may require that you are in favor of Texas’ secession from the United States (take current legislation of some hardcore Texans). 

It seems that we can narrow the scope from Texas to Houston, and from Houston to a certain section of town, and the section to a certain block, and so on, until the scope of the ‘form of life’ reaches the individual person. Why can’t each individual have their own form of life? It seems perfectly reasonable to justify their beliefs as moral if they are really their own form of life. I see no good reason to think that there aren’t an infinite number of diverse forms of life, covering pretty much every configuration of norms and beliefs possible, which leads to the justification of pretty much anything. I also see no reason why the scope of a form of life can’t be reduced to an individual, or why there can’t be just one individual in a possible form of life. As far as I can see, this would also justify moral relativism.
 
	If moral relativism is to be denied, then I think McDowell’s use of ‘forms of life’, which is innately relativistic, fails. But, why should I think that moral relativism is to be denied?

Internalists require a way to draw pseudo-objectivity out of essentially subjective systems, and the ‘forms of life’ do just that (it comes at a great cost). Who doesn’t ‘like’ subjective moral systems? They are easy to swallow. They pose no problem for the rest of our beliefs; in fact, they justify what we believe and how we behave, no matter what that ends up being. The moral relativism which flows from the ‘form of life’ argument is ridiculous (I can’t overstate this – the concept makes me physically ill). Moral relativism is not an adequate theory of ethics (it isn’t even ethics to me; it swims with its other useless brethren, moral skepticism and nihilism).

Everything is relative to its ‘form of life’. What counts as virtue, eudaimonia, the virtuous agent, etc. are all pseudo-objective within the subjective forms of life. These notions, which otherwise could have remained pure and unblemished, have been infected by moral relativism. They are meaningless. 

''[2][a]''

	In Chapter 8, Hursthouse defends her thesis ‘the virtues benefit their possessor’. She spends much of the chapter fleshing out what this thesis really means. It isn’t straightforward; a great deal of context and argumentation is used to qualify it. In order to demonstrate what I consider to be two fundamental pillars which support this thesis, I’ll need to explicate her overall argument so we can see how and why she arrives at her conclusion. 

	Hursthouse lays out her major concern in the preamble, a concern which requires several chapters:

<<<
Can we hope to achieve a justified conviction that certain views about which character traits are the virtues (and which not) are objectively correct?<<ref "16">>
<<<

	This is the objective which the claim ‘the virtues benefit their possessor’ will partly answer. Importantly, in her view, this thesis is a component of a larger argument which justifies the virtues but does not necessarily provide motivating reasons for practicing them. I find that an odd division, but so be it; this is part of the conceptual framework she provides, so let’s run with it.

Her argument at large rests upon a fundamental assumption. She explains that, “a virtue is a character trait a human being needs for eudaimonia, to flourish to live well.”<<ref "17">>  The word ‘benefit’ in her thesis is directly linked to the notion of flourishing and eudaimonia. She wishes to demonstrate how the virtues lead to eudaimonia. Eudaimonia is the primary goal and ‘end’, in some sense, and the virtues are a means to that end.  [Pillar Argument #1] Eudaimonia is foundational to justifying the virtues. This is a long-standing assumption in her book, but it is perhaps most prevalent in this particular chapter. Without this pillar, we could make no sense of what she means by ‘the virtues benefit their possessor’.

	Hursthouse attempts to answer a really important question about the relationship between virtue and eudaimonia. Are the virtues sufficient or even necessary for eudaimonia?<<ref "18">>  She employs the analogy of the doctor in determining the sufficiency and/or necessity of virtues for achieving eudaimonia. She also says:

<<<
The claim is not that possession of the virtues guarantees that one will flourish. The claim is that they are the only reliable bet—even though, it is agreed, I might be unlucky and, precisely because of my virtue, wind up dying early or with my life marred or ruined.<<ref "19">>
<<<
<<< 
To claim that the virtues, for the most part, benefit their possessor, enabling her to flourish, is not to claim that virtue is necessary for happiness. It is to claim that no ‘regimen’ will serve one better—no other candidate ‘regimen’ is remotely plausible.<<ref "20">>
<<<

	It seems clear that virtue is not sufficient for eudaimonia. Moral luck can easily override virtue’s contribution to attaining eudaimonia. Circumstances out of our control can impact the possibility of eudaimonia. Having a virtuous character isn’t enough to attain eudaimonia. But, is it necessary? She seems to waffle on it above, but I don’t think she really means it; in fact, I think the correct interpretation, given the rest of her argument at large would be ‘yes’.
 
	Life is a gamble, and virtue, as a regimen, provides the highest chance for eudaimonia. In fact, she calls it the “only reliable bet.”  This is a very strong statement. In decision (game) theory, given choices with only probabilistic outcomes, the appropriate strategy for achieving the goal will be the choice with the highest chance of achieving the goal. Virtue is the best strategy for achieving eudaimonia. She goes even further though in claiming its status as the ‘only reliable bet’, implying that the other choices don’t even appear to have close to the same chance in the overall reliability calculation. This is argument is about maximizing odds, and so, at this point it isn’t yet directly explaining that virtue is ‘necessary’ for eudaimonia. 

If, in her theory, virtue does attain the status of being ‘necessary’ for eudaimonia (and I think it will), and if eudaimonia is the ‘end’ we seek, then virtue becomes justified as a necessary means. For now, virtue is only probabilistically justified by eudaimonia as a strategy. Her case for virtue’s necessity, in my view, becomes much stronger though. Before she provides us this notion, she tackles a few obstacles. Hursthouse continues:

<<<
Those who draw attention to the fact that my virtue may lead to my downfall and/or the fact that the wicked sometimes flourish like the green bay tree are, perhaps unconsciously, thinking of these as the obvious responses that would be made by the wicked or ‘the moral sceptic’ if we were to recommend the life of virtue to them on the grounds of the benefit that it will bring. They foresee that, if we tried to convince them that the life of virtue was worth the risk, whereas the life of vice (which clearly carries its own risks) was not, we shall fail. They will just laugh at us and go their merry wicked way, finding our answer completely implausible.<<ref "22">>
<<<

	Hursthouse realizes that her previous point about virtue as the ‘best bet’ to achieve eudaimonia may be criticized as being unjustified and lacking objectivity. How can she convince the vicious and the wicked from an empirical, neutral point of view (she’s going to deny this is possible later on) that the virtues are the ‘best bet’ for achieving eudaimonia? How does Hursthouse handle cases that seem contrary to her view of this ‘bet’? It does seem as if there are several counterexample situations which demonstrate that virtue isn’t the best bet for flourishing (e.g. sensible knave). She explains:

Suppose…we fall under a vicious regime in which…[it] cease[s] to be true that those who have and exercise the virtues characteristically achieve //eudaimonia//, and thereby, virtue can indeed cease to be a reliable way to achieve it…But, even in such times, it is still not the case that there is some //other //reliable way.<<ref "23">>
<<<

	I think this isn’t a very satisfactory answer. Why should I believe that there aren’t times in the world in which the most reliable way (or in fact a highly reliable way, not just the ‘most’) to achieve eudaimonia will be vices? It would seem she needs some empirical evidence which she hasn’t provided in order to say this.

	As well, we must really wonder: what is reliability? What is reliable in the short term may not be what is reliable in the long term. Perhaps over the course of just my individual life, there really is a tactic more reliable than virtue for achieving eudaimonia (for reasons we’ll see later, she will deny this). It seems as if it would have been better to have explained that the overall course of human history, despite some dark times, demonstrates the long term reliability of virtue – and in that fact, perhaps the reliability of virtue should be measured over all lifetimes. Note, this is an empirical issue for her critics. Any attempt at an empirical, objective justification, we shall see, has been in vain:

<<<
Our answer to the question ‘Why should I be virtuous/moral?’ may be ‘I want to be—that’s the sort of life I want to live, the sort that I think is a good and successful and rewarding one.’<<ref "24">>
<<<

	Virtue, as Hursthouse specifies it, is justified from the perspective of the virtuous agent. [Argument #2] An internalist view of ethics is foundational to Hursthouse’s justification of virtue ‘benefiting’ the possessor. If this is the case, the empirical claims about the flourishing are in a great deal of trouble because the very definition and metric of ‘flourishing’ is subjective, only the virtuous agent knows these things. Much of the rest of the argument is framed such that there isn’t a ‘neutral view’ between the virtuous and the vicious, and this demonstrates her internalism. She gives us an example:

<<<
[Hare] describes all…[claims] as ‘empirical’ claims about the way human life works (‘the way the world goes’) and regards them as providing reasons ‘of a non-moral sort’ for not choosing to be an amoralist ‘from the point of view of an egoist’, and I do not agree with him that they have this status. When Hare makes these claims he does not, it seems to me, speak from a neutral point of view he might share with an egoist, but from the point of view of the humane, high-principled man that he is.<<ref "25">>
<<<
<<<
There is no possibility of ‘justifying morality from the outside’ by appealing to anything ‘non-moral’, or by finding a neutral point of view that the fairly virtuous and the wicked can share.<<ref "26">>
<<<

	Hare has incorrectly thought that he has an objective ‘neutral’ position from which he justifies the virtues. He really can only begin to justify them from his own perspective. He has a specific ethical outlook which will act as a bias in any of his explanations. Of course he would see the world that way, he’s got a specific moral outlook, and he can’t escape it. He can never be truly unbiased and objective. 

The fundamental answer to the objections of the wicked and vicious is this: there is no neutral position. Hursthouse claims we don’t need to justify virtue to the vicious because to some extent they simply can’t understand it. Virtue must be justified by Hare’s reasons, but can only be done so from a virtuous perspective. From here, Hursthouse provides the framework for understanding how ‘the virtues benefit their possessor’. 

#It is only from within the outlook of the (at least moderately) virtuous that the truth of ‘the virtues benefit their possessor’ can be discerned.
#From the perspective of this outlook it is necessarily or infallibly true that the virtues benefit their possessor, because
#The virtuous have a conception of eudaimonia, of benefit, advantage, harm and loss, of ‘profit’ and ‘what pays’ such that nothing gained by action contrary to virtue pays or is a genuine advantage or benefit, and no sacrifice necessitated by virtue counts as a loss. In virtuous action one ‘accomplishes all’, achieves ‘moral benefit’, and since the virtues, uniquely, enable one to act virtuously, and never fail to do so, they are, indeed, guaranteed to benefit their possessor, enabling her to achieve eudaimonia, namely, a life lived in accordance with the virtues.<<ref "27">>

In (3) she claims a ‘guarantee’ which is quite strong. I think this is in conflict with her ideas of moral luck and tragic dilemmas. This passage strengthens her probabilistic claim to one of necessity. The virtues are necessary to enabling an agent to achieve eudaimonia. However the virtuous agent might conceive of eudaimonia, the virtues are certainly a necessary condition to the achievement of eudaimonia.

We can also see the dominant strand of internalism in her argument. Defining and justifying both virtue and eudaimonia are accomplished by those who are virtuous alone. Only the virtuous can understand and achieve these things for themselves. The wicked are left out in the cognitive cold; there is no complete explanation for them. There is no objective, external standard by which to judge, define, and justify Hursthouse’s conception of virtue and eudaimonia. 

Hursthouse doesn’t deny the possibility that ideas of the virtuous can overlap, to some extent and not completely, with the ideas of the vicious.  The overlap, however, seems quite coincidental. The focus of justification of the virtues, in part, will be something which the vicious will find implausible. Her internalism remains very robust.

	Hursthouse disagrees with the idea that “morality is a form of ‘enlightened self-interest’ specified from the neutral point of view,” and instead believes “morality is a form of ‘enlightened self-interest’ specified in a ‘value-laden’ way, from within an ethical outlook.” 

	Clearly, the internalism of her theory plays a huge role in defining eudaimonia. The virtuous agent is the only source of describing eudaimonia, as in some sense, eudaimonia acts as the end goal of the agent. The virtuous agent, perhaps not consciously, but according to this internalism, sets the metric to gauge not only which characteristics are most likely to bring about eudaimonia, but even which characteristics are always necessary to the achievement of eudemonia - namely the virtues. Thus, from an internalist point of view, employing a certain virtuous perspective, it is eudaimonia, as an end, which justify the virtues.

''[b]''
''[Criticism of Pillar Argument #2]''

Hursthouse holds what might be a slightly softer version of internalism than McDowell does, but she is an internalist. As an internalist, she thinks there is no neutral, independent (of character) way to understand virtue. The virtuous person is supposed to be the place/person we look to in order to answer ‘what should we do?’ (which I take to be the primary question of ethics, even if they might argue this is a secondary question). The internalist view relies upon the primacy of the virtues and the virtuous character, and, in this, virtue ethics does not collapse into any other approach to ethics (which should be important to a virtue ethicist). 

If internalism fails, then her notion of how the ‘virtues benefit their possessor’ also fails. I think her internalism does fail (probably because I’m an externalist), so I’m not convinced by her thesis.

The domain of the external is the domain of the rational. If there isn’t an independent, objective standard of morality, if we can’t hold the externalist view, then morality isn’t rational. Irrational ethics is no ethics at all. Subjective, internalist ethics is no ethics at all.

Clearly, if we take down this pillar argument, the conception of how ‘the virtues benefit their possessor’ crumbles. Her argument would need to become externalist, and demonstrate an objective set of reasons for her thesis. She doesn’t seem to believe this is possible. 

''[Criticism of Pillar Argument #1]''

Eudaimonia is foundational to justifying the virtues in her argument. If there is no eudaimonia, then the virtues can’t be justified in Hursthouse’s theory. My problem with using eudaimonia to justify the virtues is that she hasn’t really justified her conception of eudaimonia.

My first problem is eudaimonia’s primacy to the virtues, whereby virtue is necessary for eudaimonia, but eudaimonia isn’t necessary for being virtuous, demonstrates that Hursthouse’s virtue theory collapses into eudaimonic ethics. And, what is eudaimonia? It is a teleological end of mankind. It is the definition of flourishing as a human. I’m convinced that teleology is a consequentialist variant. Virtue theory seems to be a form of consequentialism. So, ‘the virtues benefit their possessor’ conflicts with Hursthouse’s overall assumption that virtue ethics is ‘the way to go’, that it offers something truly unique that other theories can’t. 

The second problem is even worse, in my view, and it extends to most consequential theories, including Hursthouse’s virtue theory. Hursthouse has yet to convince me that ethics is about flourishing and about eudaimonia. Why should the virtues, that is, ethics, be defined and justified by what is ‘beneficial’ to me? What does my happiness have to do with what I ought to do? Ethics isn’t about happiness or eudaimonia. It is strictly about what is right for the sake of rightness. Whatever results, whatever the consequences, they are incidental to rightness. 

Lastly, I can’t help but think her virtue theory isn’t completely circular. It seems that the internalist view infects the definitions she uses. Eudaimonia is a circular concept. Both eudaimonia and the virtues, in the end, are justified by the virtuous person, and the virtuous person is defined in terms of what he justifies.

Clearly, if we take down this pillar of eudaimonia, the conception of how ‘the virtues benefit their possessor’ crumbles. Nobody cares if ethics benefit their possessor if eudaimonia isn’t the end.

''[3]''

In the last chapter of //On Virtue Ethics//, Rosalind Hursthouse presents an argument against the moral skepticism of Bernard Williams. In my arbitration of these arguments, let me first say that my representation of Williams’ view is based upon Hursthouse’s depiction of him. To make up for any bias and lack of argumentation from the side of Williams, as presented in Hursthouse’s book, I’m going to represent the naturalistic moral skepticism where Hursthouse may not have. 

These two naturalists clash, one saying that morality does not exist in naturalism (Williams) and the other claiming morality does exist in naturalism (Hursthouse). Within this larger debate are several related arguments, particularly the relationship between Darwinism and Aristotelian Teleology, and also the nature of man and its relation to eudaimonia and ethics. 

Ethics, to Williams, is a product of evolution. It is a social virus. It is selected for. Humans who have certain mental states are more likely to pass on their genes and produce more viable offspring than those who don’t. Sometimes ‘virtue-like’ mental states are what win out in the memetic wars, and for Williams, it seem that most of the time, they don’t. Ethics is merely a phase in the evolving human nature; it is merely an illusion. His attack on Hursthouse’s theory is even more specific:

<<<
Aristotle’s conception of nature, and thereby human nature, was normative, and that, in a scientific age, this is not a conception that we can take on board…Aristotle’s conception of nature is teleological, whereas our modern scientific one is not.<<ref "30">>
<<<
<<<
The idea of a naturalistic ethics was born of a deeply teleological outlook, and its best expression, in many ways, is still to be found in Aristotle’s philosophy, a philosophy according to which there is inherent in each natural kind of thing an appropriate way for things of that kind to behave.<<ref "31">>
<<<
<<<
The first and hardest lesson of Darwinism, that there is no such teleology at all, and that there is no orchestral score provided from anywhere according to which human beings have a special part to play, still has to find its way into ethical thought.<<ref "32">>
<<<
 
	Williams contrasts Aristotle’s teleology with the Darwinism of modern science. Aristotle’s sciences are teleological, and modern science isn’t. What is so different about Aristotle’s view of the species and the view derived from Darwinism?

For Aristotle, each species has its own end, its own purpose, and a special place in the cosmos. Aristotle believed the species to be eternal; it seems reasonable that he would have opposed the possibility of evolution; it didn’t fit in his teleological framework. What is very powerful about Aristotle’s teleological and essentialist views is that there is specific definition of ‘human’ (and specific definitions for all the species), with a specific view of flourishing for the species, and individual humans could be judged on a normative gradient on the degree to which they exemplified the characteristics set out in that definition.

	Darwinism includes the concept of evolution, and denies the teleological ends and eternal definitions of species. Without these definitions, it seems that Darwinism is devoid of normative claims. My guess is that Williams prefers Darwinism to Aristotle’s teleology because Darwinism can explain the world and make it intelligible, arguably more intelligible than Aristotle’s, without having to resort to what he might consider awkward, abstract, and overly complex theories requiring the specialness of things or the ends of substances like Aristotle’s teleology. Perhaps he has employed Occam’s razor and believes Darwinism comes out on top.

	We might even argue there is a deeper question in his naturalism. Namely, what is ‘meaning’ or what is an ‘end’ in naturalism? Perhaps he believes there isn’t such a thing in naturalism. Teleology, perhaps, is beyond naturalism in some sense, and if this is the case, then, of course, as a naturalist, Williams would deny Aristotle’s teleology off the bat. Darwinism, however, is clearly reducible to naturalistic terms. 

Whatever his reasons, Williams believes that Darwinism has defeated Aristotle’s teleological worldview. As well, he thinks denying Aristotle’s teleology is a ‘hard lesson’ to be learned for those who think there is a purpose to the things in a world. Humans, as a species, aren’t working towards some perfection of an end. There is no normative conception of humanness. Humans are simply objects in a naturalistic world which do as they must, nothing more.

Williams also thinks that because humans live very dynamic and unpredictable lives you can’t say they demonstrate the same sort of regularity that other creatures in nature demonstrate. Either Hursthouse will have to restrict the viable options available to humans or say that biology lacks some explanatory power to define why there is so much variation in humanity.

Hursthouse, however, does maintain a type of Aristotelian teleology. Humans, in particular, have a very special place in the world. All the species are said to have some paradigm definition which they are attempting to attain, and to which they are compared, and from which normative claims can be made about members which partake in that definition. 

Clearly, Hursthouse as a naturalist must deny the possibility that Aristotelian teleology is in any way going to contradict the fundamental restrictions of naturalism. Her teleology must be expressible in naturalistic terms; she must claim that the only things ontologically available to her teleology are things defined by what is ordinary, natural, or observable. She must claim that ‘flourishing’ is a natural concept. The connection between the biological and the ethical will require an impressive explanation (I don’t see how she can do it). She replies to Williams’ view: 

<<<
[Darwinism] sets its own standards for what is right and wrong, and the most Darwinism could do is show that, for whatever purposes we hitherto used those standards to identify the good and the defective, we would serve them better by setting Darwinian ones.<<ref "33">>
<<<

	Hursthouse thinks she can use Darwinian terms and explanations to make moral claims about the ‘goodness’ or ‘badness’ of human beings. Hursthouse believes that the Darwinian threat is really inert at the worst; and at best, it would actually help qualify the standards and metrics of her own teleology. To her, Darwinism is not incompatible with Aristotelian teleology. She thinks the naturalistic ends she had previously laid out are reasonable measurements that even Darwinism might employ. She says:

<<<
I have found in discussion that many people imagine that Darwinian evaluations would either rely solely on the second end (continuance of the species) or replace that, as the sole end, with ‘replication of the individual’s genes’. But human being are not the only species in which the female members have a ‘characteristics life expectancy’ that extends well past the age in which they are replicating, or even nurturing, their genes…But scientific ethologists are not considering giving up on the idea that there must be something defective about a female member of such a species who dies well before her allotted span for no external cause. On the contrary, they are trying to figure out whether, and if so how, the presence of these elderly females contributes to the good functioning of the social group and thereby to the continuance of its members and thereby, as an evolutionary strategy, to the replication of the elderly females’ genes.<<ref "34">>
<<<
 
She thinks that current Darwinian standards aren’t such that her Aristotelian standards would collapse into mere ‘replication of the individual’s genes’; rather, it seems that Darwinian evaluations are pointing towards similar standards to her Aristotelian ones. If Aristotelian standards aren’t correct, then we should replace them. At this point, however, we don’t have reason to do so. So, insofar as Darwinism is compatible with Aristotelian teleology, she doesn’t seem to worry much. 

I think Williams would want to point out here that Hursthouse doesn’t make a good case for the compatibility of teleological definitions and a Darwinian view of species. What is ‘human’ if it is something which has evolved from the primordial? Where and why do you draw the lines of species? Darwinism is descriptive, rather than normative, and more capable of handling these continuums of species. A strict Aristotelian definition of species doesn’t seem capable of handling much of a continuum at all. If it can, Hursthouse really should have explained it more clearly.

Hursthouse thinks the teleological ends of humans are more complex and difficult to define than the other ends of other animals. She explains:	

<<<
If the grammatical idea behind ethical naturalism is right, namely that our terms ‘good’, ‘bad/defective’, ‘well’ do not suddenly start being used in a totally new way when we start using them in relation to ourselves, then our concept of living well, or flourishing (or eudaimonia, when we use it in relation to ourselves), is connected to our evaluations of human beings as good or bad. But that concept, used in relation to ourselves, is indubitably also connected to eudaimonia, the Good Life that we all seek, the life that is of benefit to the individual whose life it is, as it appears in thesis (i). The other animals cannot form their own conceptions of living well, cannot say to themselves ‘That’s the sort of life I want to live, the life in which . . . ‘ and consciously aim to live it; they live as nature determines. We can.<<ref "35">>
<<<

She believes eudaimonia and ‘evaluations of human beings as good or bad’ form a feedback loop; they modify each other. Somehow they are separate, but they are highly connected to each other. The other animals don’t have this loop because their species don’t have the same sort of purpose - something like human eudaimonia. This eudaimonia belongs to humans and any species which evolves to have human-like reasoning. These special properties of the complex minds of naturalistic beings imbue them with the ability to control the definition of their own ends, in some sense. Eudaimonia, to some extent, is determined by human beings who consciously decide what it can mean in some way. Given the feedback loop, human beings in some way determine the evaluations of what counts as good or bad qua human being. Likely, the notion that ‘virtues benefit their possessor’ only applies to beings that have a concept of eudaimonia. The other animals don’t have reason or the same individualistic requirements as part of their ends.

She is pointing out how Darwinism alone may fail to capture these ends and the complexity of eudaimonia in the case of human flourishing. Defining ‘human’ flourishing, eudaimonia, isn’t easy to do in Darwinism. Perhaps Hursthouse is suggesting the limits of Darwinism. I think Williams would reply that the notion of human ‘eudaimonia’ is normative, that it begs the question of teleology and normativity in an unnaturalistic manner.

Williams might not consider the diminution of Darwinian influence on the standards of eudaimonia to be a strong argument because of other reasons as well. What makes humans so special? Reason? What is reason to Williams? It is just a very complex network of chemical and electrical reactions in a brain. Why is that so special? Why does that change the normativity of humanness? It seems that the end of all species is to become the top of the food chain, to evolve into something with human-like reason. Aren’t the ends of non-human animals false? Shouldn’t other animals seek to become special like humans?

What if an evolutionary accident occurred tomorrow, whereby a strong beneficial mutation occurs in a monkey, a crow, a dolphin, or an elephant, such that this highly evolved animal has human-like reason. Wouldn’t we say that this animal (we’ll say monkey) is really better than other monkeys? That monkey, however, didn’t adhere to the definition of monkeyness; it isn’t flourishing as a monkey. This is a bad monkey, right? I’m not sure why Hursthouse can claim that the highest hope of any monkey isn’t to evolve and morph into something with human reason rather than adhere to the definition of monkeyness. This ‘ends’-based reasoning seems flawed in and of itself.

Williams provides a serious attack on the fundamental notion of human nature, the notion of its ends, and the possibility of ethics:

<<< 
The [fact] that human nature is not harmonious ‘still has to find itself into ethical thought’.<<ref "36">>
<<<
<<<
[H]uman beings are to some degree a mess, and…the rapid and immense development of symbolic and cultural capacities has left humans as beings for whom no form of life is likely to prove entirely satisfactory, either individually or socially…[T]hose who have tried to reach a naturalistic morality which transcends it have had to read the historical record, or read beyond the historical record, in ways that seek to reveal a partly hidden human nature which is waiting to be realized or perfected.<<ref "37">>
<<<

Williams believes that from an evolutionary, Darwinian perspective, human nature is flawed. Science and history present us with a very negative view of humanity. He thinks this idea is not understood by the proponents of naturalistic morality. Humanity lacks any real sense of ‘hope’ to him. It seems impossible to be ‘entirely satisfied’ as a human, and extremely unlikely (mere happenstance if it does occur) and entirely out of the hands of the agent to somehow reach or attain the status of eudaimonia. He thinks the idea of naturalistic morality rides upon an unscientific and inaccurate historical account of humanity and its nature. He would explain:

<<<
[The naturalistic concept of eudaimonia] takes for granted…’a strong view of the harmony among themselves of human capacities and need’. ‘This assumption does…seem to me more plausible if you can help yourself to Aristotelian cosmology, than if you regard it as an open question whether the evolutionary success of humanity, in its extremely brief period of existence, may not rest on a rather ill-assorted bricolage of powers and instincts.’<<ref "38">>
<<<

The naturalistic concept of eudaimonia is implausible because it assumes an unrealistic and overly optimistic ‘harmony among humans’ which is not rooted in science or history. Without the ingrained possibility of ‘harmony’, Williams thinks the notion of eudaimonia is failed from the outset, and that morality doesn’t exist.
 
Hursthouse defends her argument:

<<<
We could make [the view that virtues on the standard list benefit the possessor] ‘more plausible’ to the immoralist if there were some (unimaginable) scientific, even cosmological, facts we could appeal to…But we didn’t even try, for to do so would, yet again, be attempting to justify morality from the outside—as, in a final vestige of his earlier view that ethical naturalism is supposed to base itself on a ‘scientifically respectable account of human beings’, Williams seems to be supposing we must do if we are aiming at ‘plausibility’.<<ref "39">>
<<<

	Hursthouse thinks she doesn’t need to demonstrate the plausibility of the notion of eudaimonia. She thinks she can assume it. Her internalist leanings allow her to denounce external justification of her theory of ethics. It seems that the external view has implications for how we might come to know what counts as virtue and its naturalistic ends, but it doesn’t justify virtue. But she does take on the historical and scientific record to demonstrate a hope for ethics that Williams lacks. Then she provides her counterstrike:

<<<
Any human being who, at the end of her life, is able to look back and say, sincerely, ‘That was satisfactory; I lived well’, has been astonishingly lucky, and no inculcation of character traits, no supposedly rational plan of one’s life or attempts at supposed self-improvement or supposed improvement of our societies can make anyone one whit more likely to be lucky; all such attempts are futile…this amounts to complete moral nihilism.<<ref "40">>
<<<
<<<
The belief that harmony is possible for human beings, that we have the virtues neither by nor contrary to nature, but are fitted by (our) nature to receive them, is, I think, an essential part of the ethical outlook even of the minimally virtuous—any of us who think that being right about ethics matters…We manifest it by going in for ethical thought and talk at all.<<ref "41">>
<<<

	Honestly, this section made me chuckle because I can’t tell if this is meant to have an edge of sweet, sweet ad hominem attack or not.  Perhaps the reason behind Williams’ pessimism and moral nihilism, which are “as old as misanthropy and despair,”<<ref "43">>  is his vicious nature. If only he had some minimally virtuous outlook, he could understand why ‘being right about ethics’ matters. This does match up with a great deal of her book – of course the vicious agent, Williams in this case, can’t see the value of virtue. He lacks a belief in this harmony (a necessary component to having the outlook of one with even trace elements of virtue), thus he lacks the ethical outlook of even the minimally virtuous. It does seem as if she is claiming he doesn’t understand or agree with her argument because he is evil—that’s not something you see every day in formal philosophy.

	There is something more profound to consider - namely that ethics requires assumptions, leaps of faith. People assume that ethics exists, that value and meaning are real, that there are things actually worth pursuing in this world, else they wouldn’t continue manifesting moral beliefs in various aspects of their lives. Hursthouse finishes:

<<<
[T]he idea that we are just a mess is a particularly global form of moral scepticism, one which not only dismisses the whole ethical outlook of the (even minimally) virtuous as mere optimistic fantasy but simultaneously rejects the idea that practical rationality has anything substantial or long-term to do…As such it would be akin to other forms of global scepticism about, say the possibility of scientific knowledge (based, as it is, on the non-scientifically validated assumption that nature is intelligible), or even the possibility of knowledge of the external world or other minds.<<ref "44">>
<<<
<<<
The practice of ethical thought, as we know it, has to be based on the assumption that human beings, as a species, are capable of harmony, both within themselves and with each other. If we suppose they are not, the whole practice collapses. There is no refutation of scepticism about this assumption. But the practice is worth going in for, there is no practicable alternative for us, so we have to take the assumption on board.<<ref "45">>
<<<

Hursthouse considers Williams’ argument to be a form of global skepticism. It isn’t just ethics that requires assumptions and leaps of faith to even begin their topics. There are few topics which can survive a corresponding form of global skepticism. Given just this argument, I’m not sure why Williams simply can’t claim to make the assumptions necessary to do science and not make them for ethics.
 
Hursthouse believes that Skepticism about the objective nature of morality is partly answered by the Neurathian procedure. The hull of the boat of ethics is an assumption that the boat can exist.

''Conclusion''

I’m convinced that Williams is the much more consistent naturalist of the two. I have absolutely no idea how naturalism is compatible with any adequate theory of ethics. In my view, naturalism requires the denial of free will, moral responsibility, meaning and value in the world. I agree with Williams that if naturalism is true then teleology is really dead. Ethics is an illusion for a proper naturalist. If naturalism is true, then Williams is right. Hursthouse’s objective can’t be achieved in the naturalistic framework. Hursthouse never adequately addressed these issues.

I am not a naturalist, however, so I think Hursthouse’s objective is still a reasonable (even worthy) pursuit. I have other issues, though. Exactly why is it necessary that 'human nature is harmonious' in order to do ethics? It seems integral to assumptions about naturalistic ethics theory, but I’m not sure why this should worry the non-naturalist. I can at least claim that humans are generally disharmonious, and still claim an ‘ought’ and the reality of ethics. 

The fundamental point of this argument didn’t appear until the very end of this argument though. I appreciate what Hursthouse has to say. We naturally assume that ethics is real. This is a foundational assumption. She’s right about tackling global skepticism. You have to make some unprovable assumptions about the world to either deny or agree to the existence of ethics. 

	I think there is a slightly stronger argument to give than she did. I think value and ethics share primacy with logic and God in this world – they’ve always co-existed in some sense. The sorts of assumptions we make about ethics are parallel to assuming the laws of non-contradiction or excluded middle. 

I don’t think anyone pursues anything unless they think they want it. Whatever they want has value to them, and in this way, they think they ‘should’ pursue it. Value, by definition, is something worth pursuing, and value is really just another way of claiming ‘ought’ and reality fo ethics. Value is primitive to the world, and whatever is worth doing is really worth doing. If a person denies value, then how could they rationally pursue anything? The pursuit of anything assumes the object of pursuit is worth pursuing, that the object has value in some sense.

The fact that Williams took the time to write his paper, claiming that ‘value’ doesn’t really exist in the world, that nothing is really worth pursuing, demonstrates a contradiction with his intentions. He set out to do something; he pursued something - namely saying there wasn’t anything worth pursuing. I’m sure he pursues other things. And why does he pursue them? Because he wants something, because they are in some sense worth pursuing, because they have value to him. If ethics is an illusion, even Williams is under its spell.
