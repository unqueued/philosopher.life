title: Smalltalk

//I'm not literally alien, but I'm functionally similar to one all too often. Smalltalk is [[esoteric|Straussian]], aiming to be superficial, cheap, and empty: that's exactly why it should not be taken lightly.//

Smalltalk can be a choreographed energy-efficient stealthy feeling-out process bypassing information exchanges which may jeopardize our happiness or safety, a networking skill for making an acquaintance or minimally catching up with someone, a conversation opener or closer, a time-passing silence-gap filler, an unspoken game of validating each other on the surface, a confabulated fiction we've connected with someone we simulate for endorphin rewards, and a method of appearing to temporarily equalize status in various spheres. 

Non-autistics (with respect to a given population) possess an especially broad kaleidoscopic lens of social hierarchies (which is not the claim these perceptions and inferences are justified), and without smalltalk, they would be affectively blind in many contexts. As an autist, both as a survival skill and as a kindness to [[others]], I am required:

* to work overtime to take the perspectives of the neuro majority
* to be interested in the person, even if not in the content of what is communicated
* to socially spy for the sake of updating my models of normies
* to cognitively and empirically reverse-engineer socialization, including the flows of conversation
* to sacrifice being myself to put others at ease, walking on eggshells and avoiding minefields with almost everyone
* to exhaustingly employ and practice blending, masking, and codeswitching as a stranger in a strange land.

The favor is very rarely returned offline.<<ref "i">> [[T42T]] failure modes with [[others]] are more common with me when I'm being fair to myself. These experiences have helped me as a moral philosopher, as it has been necessary to peel apart layers of mere social convention from categorical normativity in both explanation and justification. Politeness and civility are non-trivial problems to me.

I am not wholly against phatic expressions, but I find the way people wield and reason about them dubious at best. What is the [[gfwiwcgws]] point of "polite" conversation or informal discourse about unimportant, uncontroversial matters, and why should we think these don't actually have transactions embedded in them which need to be addressed? 

Insofar as smalltalk is a conversation starter, an ignition for building up something far more substantial, I don't have a problem with it. You gotta start somewhere, right? When smalltalk becomes the crux of our bonding rituals, especially insofar as the practice is strategically used for egoistic social positioning dances meant to scan, define, categorize, and manage status and relationship distance for the sake of using others as //mere// tools in our lives, it merits intense scrutiny. Further, insofar as language is not used to mean what it says, and instead, trivialities are abused as a veil for invisible social signaling, I aim to enforce high expectations on justifying that deception.<<ref "k">> Even in caution: plainness, honesty, and directness are the prima facie starting positions. 

I generally hate smalltalk; I despise burning my computational energy on what is not usually justified. It doesn't feel real at all, and I see no reason to play along in many cases.<<ref "t">> Smalltalk is all too often a language game in which we casually, openly, and immorally-civilly create spaces for dishonesty necessary to hide from an opponent how much we really don't give a shit about them (which is radically different from saying we don't agree with them). It is a game that allows us to appear to like someone without giving away the fact that we don't love them. Here's what smalltalk usually means to me: you aren't interested in me or what I'm saying directly. You are interested in how effective a tool I can be for your happiness.

[[k0sh3k]]'s notes:

There are those who will find you intimidating b/c you don't play the social niceties - especially, that you don't shut your mouth when you think they are doing something morally wrong or are saying something hypocritical/unfounded, because it's socially expected that you would not confront someone directly unless your intention is an attack on their person.

<<footnotes "i" "It has to be one of my favorite aspects of having my own wiki. You're on my turf, in my own model. Socializing will generally be difficult no matter what for me, but the norms are different in this space and practice. The failure modes are easier to pick out, and the odds of success are higher.">>

<<footnotes "k" "Don't get me wrong: Kant is straight up wrong about the axe-murderer at your doorstep. You better fucking lie to the dark-triad when it is morally required of you; that's the [[T42T]] rule-of-thumb. If you don't have [[salient]], openly defensible positions deviating from what is obviously [[T42T]], if can't spend your social capital sacrificially for the [[other]] (thus, from duty), then you probably don't have justification to deceive. Smalltalk is generally not universalizable, imho.">>

<<footnotes "t" "I don't play social nicety games for the sake of being nice. I aim to be kind regardless of niceness; niceness is [[FO]], and kindness is [[SO]] over those desires and beliefs (into [[infinigress]]ive faith on the Frankfurtian model).">>
