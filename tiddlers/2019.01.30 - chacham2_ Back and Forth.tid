First off, the format of this message is annoying. The type of links, the non-wrapping lines, and the nonstandard font just make it uneasy to read. I am sure that was not your intention, but please bear it in mind.

The main archetype being the shadow is from Jung's writings in one or two places that three (?) archetypes are special, or first or something. Shadow, anima/animus, and old man (senex?). I would have to search for the quote. Regardless, everyone hits the shadow first because the shadow defines/creates the personal unconscious. Jung speaks of the personal unconscious in the Tavistock lectures, and in response to a question explains a "complete" person would be boring. If you have not read the Tavistock Lectures, i strongly recommend doing so. They are lectures Jung gave explaining the basics in an overview he gave to medical doctors. It's the easiest of his writings. The reading group just finished it.

As for us being more than computers, i just used the term computer to get the point across quickly. I would suggest you read the lectures and then ask the question again. I cannot explain better than Jung himself.

Sure.

I admit i am intrigued by finding someone else who likes both of those. Though, if we are both INTJs, it should not be so strange. You have few comments here. I assume this is not your main account, or are you just new here?

Anyway, if you care to understand Jung, read the Tavistock lectures and we can take it from there.
