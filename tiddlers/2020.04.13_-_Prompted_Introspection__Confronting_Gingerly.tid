title: 2020.04.13 - Prompted Introspection: Confronting Gingerly

!! What situation has caused you to confront your ethics recently?

[[2018.07.15 - Prompted Introspection: Confronting My Ethics]] is correct. I confront it every day. I'm a philosopher, [[WINTCIS]]. Lately, I've been confronting how to reason wisely and hedge-conservatively about preparations for what may be the beginning of a New Great Depression. It'd be easy to say the sky is falling. I'm having to take risks that I'd rather not take, running with a gut I can barely trust (or don't want to), and speaking with others about something that's so big, none of us can predict it well enough (I'm doing what I can to state my deep anxiety with some caution). I do not like giving advice here, especially because I have no idea how to even advise myself.

I'm trying to find people on the margins in my immediate area that may need help. I'm thinking about how we might garden (though there's just not space for us). We're thinking about different stages of how bad it might get. I'm trying not to freak out in full panic mode, gingerly escalating.
