* [[2018.12 - Antipleonasm Analysis]]

!! Audit:

* This is such a weird experience. I have a [[Core Daily Requirement]] (exceedingly rare for me to even attempt to add one) which is two weeks old here. Even my first [[Monthly Audit]] is all over the place trying to figure out what the fuck I'm doing. 20 seconds later, I'm supposed to provide a yearly [[audit]] of that monthly. ROFL! 
** `/wojack-mentally-masturbating/fucking-female-form-extending-from-his-noggin`
* I'm going easy on myself here. This is just plain funny to me, even if I take this log quite seriously.
* Also, can't use [[AA]] to shorten this one.
* I'm worried this isn't exactly analysis, or it isn't any objective kind.
** That's the point though, right?
* I've really enjoyed this log. These might be short answers, but I love having something that gets my goat, sticks a quarter in me, or makes me wrastle. So far, there's nothing that makes me want to give a dismissive non-answer like [[Prompted Introspection]].
* I'm proud of myself for continuing to experiment. This wiki has started to become saturated and sprawling, and it is extremely heavily lifting to continue making new things when I'm in the process of [[remodeling]] and responding in [[FTO]] (on top of life in general!).
