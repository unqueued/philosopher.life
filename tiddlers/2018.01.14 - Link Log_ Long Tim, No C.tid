*** What it confirms for me is how little (if any) space there is between what we value and believe and what we actually do. Desires really do seem to function like beliefs all too often. Virtue is Knowledge space is odd like that.

*** Might not be a good organization, but this has been accurate for us.
** https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/opinion/sunday/kids-would-you-please-start-fighting.html
*** Dialectic.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** http://nautil.us/blog/the-real-difference-between-you-and-a-plant
*** Okay, this is interesting. But, it's not a good argument. Metacognition, volition, abstract reasoning, self-reflective awareness, and higher-order cognitive processes that result in Dasein seem to be a clear line in the sand for differentiationism.

*** I should know better by now. I didn't realize how far this went.

*** Blows my mind.

* Think About It

*** Trusting trust.
** http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/terry-gross-in-conversation.html
*** Kind of meta. I have long listened to her. Empathy nails it.

*** Part of the problem in modeling is that it grants significant competitive advantages to those capable of understanding and harnessing it. It can be a source of parasiticism, macroecon insider trader, and rent-seeking. That isn't to say I'm against modeling, but rather I think we need to be aware of the issue. There may be mitigating factors available to us.
*** Obviously, failing to model accurately is a huge problem in itself. 
*** Might I suggest that an update requires distributing power through decentralizing power structures and protocols? Re-envisioning socialism, attempting to really make it work, throwing your engineering behind that is what is really worth your time.<<ref "2019.03.21">>

*** Complex topic, no doubt.
** https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/01/why-humans-need-rethink-their-place-animal-kingdom
*** I'm open to the possibility. There is a reason I would not harm a dolphin, ape, elephant, cat, dog, etc. without significant due cause (approaching how I feel about humans; but, I think even human life is not as sacred as I once thought). Differentiationism, however, still seems philosophically impossible to move.

*** There are kernels of intellectual integrity here that we should think about. I doubt we will reach the conclusions the author does.

*** I'm looking the gifthorse in the mouth. Is this a human capital problem? What is the best selfish explanation for it?
*** https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/business/economy/labor-market-inmates.html
**** Related. Marx has something to say, yo.
** https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Improving-Global-Health
*** Optics, giving the wealthy a good name and attempting to make trickle-down appear viable through charity rather than taxation, developing human capital, finding cures for things that might ultimately affect him, and what other reasons?
** https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21734454-should-worry-both-government-and-companies-india-has-hole-where-its-middle-class-should-be
