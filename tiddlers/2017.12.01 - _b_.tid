Your conscious awareness of an emergent belief you have is not the same thing as your foundational subconscious beliefs and motivations for that emergence. Just because you say to yourself something is right or wrong doesn't mean you actually fundamentally believe it all the way down in the Frankfurtian sense, and it doesn't mean you are committed to it or that you are really motivated by it. You can trick yourself very easily. Recall, of course, that consciousness is an illusion; we are mere observers. Problematically, you are fairly egoistic (if not psychopathic) at the bottom.
