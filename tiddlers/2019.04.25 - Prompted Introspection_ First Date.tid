title: 2019.04.25 - Prompted Introspection: First Date

!! Describe your first date.

Uh, did I have to know I was on a date for it to count as a date? Samwise, I'm autistic and socially retarded. I know girls enjoyed talking with me, and I always thought we were friends. I never understood that one liked me beyond friendship without a 3rd party intervening (or, in the case of my wife, directly being told).

I actually don't know what counts as a date either. 

I don't even remember the girl's name. Ugh. That is embarrassing. All I have left are impressions, feelings, guttural theories of mind, tidbits of who she was and who I was in virtue of her. I can barely trust my models and memory in this area. 

Long dark hair, glasses, pointy face, slender, taller than me, ~120 verbal IQ, ~110 quant, not shy at all, straight-shooter, argumentative, kind, gorgeous sarcasm. She was a hard worker, lower class, had good manners, and everyone liked her. She worked the register at McD's and often closed with me. I worked the back because I'm a brute, swore a lot, etc. I enjoyed talking with her, and she was my friend (I'm ashamed that I don't know her name; it's not even on the tip of my tongue).

She had asked me to go places more than once. I'm an idiot, and I'd rather play Everquest, ROFL. I think I should have gone for some pussy instead, but I would never have done so.<<ref "s">> I think she liked talking with me, found me respectful but quite combative, not boring, and I can guarantee I was the weirdest person there. Same ages, but I was in college while they were in high school, so that might have been part of the allure. My sideburns were pretty bitchin' at 16.

She eventually asked me to go to the movies with her. We saw //The Ring//. She held onto me during the movie. I thought she was scared, so I tried to comfort her. I hate scary movies too. I'm an idiot.
