title: 2012.12.06 - Autonomy: Oshana Notes

Summary:

Oshana argues that autonomy does not necessarily require libertarian freedom of will. She isn’t arguing against libertarianism; she thinks it just isn’t important to Autonomy. She refers to autonomy as being agnostic to the issue of determinism, which seems related to Mele. Autonomy, she thinks, requires both freedoms to take those actions which are vital to living one’s life and to reflect upon, choose, and change one’s values, motivations, and life.

Autonomy is not necessary for responsibility. Frankfurt’s notion of acting freely isn’t sufficient (although it may be necessary) for self-determination. Classic conceptions of positive and negative liberties, likewise, may be necessary, but aren’t sufficient for autonomy. 

Thoughts:

I don’t know what to say. I’ve nothing directly to say about her argument. I don’t even share her starting intuitions on the topic, and so I’m not really able to put myself in her shoes. I could rehearse the libertarian intuitions here, as that’s exactly what I think counters her argument. This is the second time reading her paper, and I find it disappointing. Someone who argues that incompatibilism is irrelevant to the issues of autonomy and moral responsibility needs to provide me arguments and juice my intuitions about why compatibilism can make sense of autonomy and moral responsibility (even if her theory can ultimately remain agnostic), not why compatibilism doesn’t matter either.
