!! Audit:

* Some of these I just jump into off a whim. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.
** Hrm...I think it's important to have that whimsy at some point.
* I clearly have a lot of plans.
* [[The Remodeling]] is treacherously slow.
** I need to be forgiving. I think it is completely fair to say I work ridiculously hard on this wiki.
* I'm thinking Bob is going to become a real thing for me. I will be peeling apart of my development environment, but I can turn it off and work without it whenever I wish.
** And, I will preserve the performance of users.
** I think this will enable the hardcoding I desperately seek as well. 
** I am excited.
* I'm clearly having to make judgment calls in [[The Remodeling]].
** I'm trying to be conservative about it, but sometimes I need to just take the open leap.
* This may have been one of the most emotional months in the [[audit]] I've experienced since the beginning of this year.
* The neat part is that [[Wiki Audit]] is often making long-term comments and analyses I'd normally see in my monthly audits. Something is working!
* I keep seeing places to build logs. I wish I had clearer notion of how to do so effectively. This needs to become second nature to me; I shouldn't have to reason about how to solve this problem.
** In fact, I'd like an automated way to do this. I just don't know all the rules of how to model doing this right now.
* I'm still learning how to tag. It's a very slow process, and that's okay!
* As my daughter points out, we've been messing with our git process quite a bit.
** In fact, we've been working on the infrastructure a good deal.
*** https://philosopher.life/ now serves about as fast as it's going to serve.
**** 5.1.18 will possibly bring the "loading" image, so that may be one of the only other improvements I can make.
*** I'm still heavily decentralized, it's real-time, it's basically free (though I still use to smooth some problems out), it's backed up and versioned hard, I can rebuild from a variety of failures, I do not rely upon or have to trust servers outside of [[m10]], and it's automated. 
* I'm still balls deep in [[Alias]]ing.
* Clearly, I have skipped a few days. =/
** That's okay. You are forgiven, sir!
* Again, I'm very proud of my work this month. I've been kicking ass in this log.
