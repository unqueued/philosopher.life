title: Cry Log

I'm started this log because crying is a unique and particularly strong kind of emotional reaction which I must catalog and analyze. I started it during a week in which I cried 3 times. That is far above average. I want to understand why I cry. Crying isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is a powerful thing. My gut says it is a good thing to let it out, but I fear that I do not have control of my emotions. 

I will write a short ditty about the episode, cause, and my thoughts on it. It may not go anywhere, and that's fine. For now, I will assume it is valuable to capture at least something. I'm doing ghetto science.

What causes me to cry? Being overwhelmed, especially via profound existential cognitive dissonance, frisson, catharsis, and/or woe.

This does appear to have significant overlap with the duties I've assigned to [[h0p3's Log]], but my gut says there is something specific here worth categorizing in itself.

I have stopped crying. I think the stress has eased up a bit.
