title: 2017.09.02 -- Carpe Diem Log

* Woke up late. Quite sleepy. Late night with cannabliss taken at 6pm.
* Fireman Time!
* Took the kids to a trampoline park. I think they enjoyed it a bunch.
* Donuts!
* My son and I went to Harbor Freight and Wal-mart. 
** We got tools for both of us and some shoes for him.
** He wants to make a picture frame. This is awesome! It's right in the vein of where I want him to go. I need to make this happen for him.
* Cannabliss

* Cleaned living room.
