As you can guess, I'm trying to "Find The Others." I have two approaches:

* Sift Humanity for those who speak my dialects and values.
** I have a narrow scope of humanity that really speaks my language, that are composed in such a way that we can both effectively empathize with each, that are people that I can be deep friends with. I'm looking for meaningful friendships, those which define who I am. Sometimes it's only one way though (e.g. they might be dead). This is definitely an oddity.
*** This is clearly focused on the rational in me; rationality as I see it as directly as I can.
* Actively and hospitably pursue the rational aliens (not literal aliens, obviously) among us.
** In the humble pursuit of the Original Position, I pursue "The Others." I'm the corrected Bene Gesserit: I sift humans for persons. I seek the Rational in all of us.
*** This is clearly focused on the rationality in others, trustingly accepting their hearsay and providing them shelter, having faith in those I meet.
