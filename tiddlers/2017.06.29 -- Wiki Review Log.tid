title: 2017.06.29 -- Wiki Review Log

* [[Mugeye the Tinkerer]]
** I really did love the spirit of that show. I wish I was that cool.
* [[Tobfub the Pacifist]]
** I think this is such a hilarious character. It constantly breaks the fourth wall into OOC and does genuinely good things for the group. I like it. It's trolly, but not in a terrible way.
* [[Snowball the Myrmidon]]
** I worry this character is broken strong. It is the quintessential tank, and it scales hard.
* [[2017.06.28 -- Carpe Diem Log]]
** It was a good day. I assume I won't usually have days like these very often. That's okay. I will be productive and earning money to stabilize our happiness, to secure our futures, and to improve upon myself.
* [[2017.06.28 -- Prompted Introspection Log]]
** I should stop talking about social media.
* [[2017.06.28 -- Diet Log]]
** God damn, fatty!
* [[2017.06.28 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** I really am eating too much.
* [[2017.06.28 -- Pipefitting Log]]
** The transition is something to behold. I've come a really long way in 6 months. I'm legitimately proud of myself.
* [[Euphemism Collection]]
** They aren't exactly euphemisms. What are they?
