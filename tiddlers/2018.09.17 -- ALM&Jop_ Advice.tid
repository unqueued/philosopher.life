 Alright, I'm calling in a favor (I cannot recall the last time I did).
Mon 11:35 AM
 I am considering reaching out to my donors. Not sure if I should, and I'm not sure how I should do it. I'd like your digested advice. Give me something to think on. Be prepared for me to wrestle with your claim, please. Take your time in formulating your thoughts, please.
Mon 11:36 AM
 For some more context, please read through this: https://philosopher.life/#2018.08.11%20--%20AA%26UJ%3A%20Thank%20You:%5B%5B2018.08.11%20--%20AA%26UJ%3A%20Thank%20You%5D%5D

 I will work on that for you.  Send me your thoughts on the subject now and a little most recent info on your interactions with them and your thoughts on why you might or might not reach out now.  I am not up to speed.
Mon 12:04 PM
 Missed the link sorry, mobile.  Will read it and then reply with my thoughts for you.
Mon 12:04 PM
 Do you have a deadline on this request?  I want to know how long I have to formulate a response.
Mon 12:05 PM
 It will take you a while to read it. You will perhaps need to hyperread my wiki to appreciate the issue. https://philosopher.life/#Help%3A%20On%20This%20Wiki:%5B%5BHelp%3A%20On%20This%20Wiki%5D%5D would also be a key thing to read.

 I think you should take as long as you need. I think it is unlikely that you could give an informed answer in a couple days because there is a lot to read and think about it. I know your work schedule is significant too.
Mon 12:31 PM
 I ask you give me the best possible answer you can in month?
Mon 12:32 PM
 in a *
Mon 12:32 PM
 if you can give an answer sooner, I would appreciate it
Mon 12:32 PM
 It will probably take some doing to formulate something that I can wrestle with. I leave it up to you.
Mon 12:33 PM
 I appreciate your willingness to work hard on my behalf and well-being here. It is not a fun task.
Mon 12:34 PM
 Thanks for the pointing in the right direction.  I will get started on it.

 What kind of donors?
Mon 1:11 PM
 I used to have this concern too. I think I should do it if the program will benefit many  people, but try not to make it personal so the person who gets the message won't feel the pressure. For example I could do on a Facebook specific group for the donors only. I know you don't like Facebook. You could try others group message.
Mon 1:20 PM
 my donors = my parents
Mon 2:10 PM
 sorry, I should have made that clearer
Mon 2:10 PM
 There is a leap there that isn't easy to see. Also, I appreciate your answer to a different question. =)
Mon 2:11 PM
 I don't know all the situation but I think your parents are great people. I think it's good for you talked to them humbly.
Mon 2:20 PM
 I ask you give it some thought.
Mon 2:21 PM
 I would be speaking with them through my wiki; it would be out in the open.
Mon 2:21 PM
 Their replies as well.
Mon 2:22 PM
 I did
Mon 2:23 PM
 Okay. Thank you. =)
Mon 2:23 PM
 I don't have any fancy words but I confirm the same answer.
Mon 2:24 PM
 I'm fine with plain words too. I appreciate your honesty.
