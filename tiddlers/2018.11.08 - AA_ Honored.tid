It is nice —they lay on me or [[UJ]]. It’s cat tennis!

Hehe

Every time one of us rolls over they switch

How’s your day today?

Applying to jobs. Working with the chillun. Read+Writing. I got the best sleep I've had in a while last night, so overall: really good.
9 HR AGO
Very nice! I sleep much better now that I have a big weighted blankie
9 HR AGO
I have never tried that.

It makes me less anxious...now I just need to keep the house cold at night

You are really the first one I have talked to about depression (including [[UJ]]). First thank you for letting me without judging —it’s nice to be understood. Second I know it has to be weird not to talk about it after having it so long but I was raised in a house where we don’t talk about problems ...which only makes them worse not gone
7 HR AGO
I have to work on that ...
7 HR AGO
Lace, [[AG]] and I need to have some conversations about this and other things
7 HR AGO
I am honored to be a person you feel comfortable talking about depression with. It's really hard. I can appreciate what it's like being raised in a household where we don't talk about certain kinds of things, depression included. I appreciate that you let me be so ridiculously honest too (I know the wiki appears to be an act of lunacy). We'll fight the beast together.
7 HR AGO
Sounds like a great plan! It certainly is a dark beast.
7 HR AGO
Thank you :heart:
7 HR AGO
I know that you are one that would call me on any “bs” and I expect you to.. I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to be yourself
7 HR AGO
They are both rare gifts in people today
7 HR AGO
That is some high praise. Thank you. I will do my best.

Also, [[j3d1h]] setup a VM on our home server with Windows. She's gonna try setting up some private WoW and EQ servers.
6 HR AGO
Woohoo
