title: 2017.04.28 -- Wiki Review Log

* [[Fun Word Collection]]
** Added a tiny intro. Collections should express an intent other than what is being catalogued. You should see why it matters to me, even if I only briefly explain it.
* [[Art of Living]]
** Edits. It is a placeholder. I'm still learning. Maybe it is just a joke. I don't know. I'm leaving it for now.
* [[Wiki Theory, Questions, Problematics, and Investigations]]

* [[Wiki Review Log]]
** Added content. I'm glad I'm doing this. I hope it won't be too much work. We will review.
* [[Dave Chappelle's Redpill Conversion]]
** Digested it more.

** Tidy it up
