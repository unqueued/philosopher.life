title: 2019.07.02 - Wiki Review: Meta

* [[2019.06 - Wiki Review]]
** This ability to be meta, to speak from the outside of the piece is something I want for my daughter in her own art.
* [[2019.06 - TDL]]
** Perhaps meal prep for my wife could be streamlined further. 
* [[2019.06 - Prompted Introspection]]
** It's grindy. I can see there are diminishing returns, but it also captures my evolving opinions. I've said this before as well. =)
* [[2019.06 - Link Log]]
** Fascinatingly, I still have almost half as many outbound links. That is surprising. I assumed internal links would trounce outbound.
* [[2019.06 - Family Log]]
** I continue to push for ways in which my offspring build things with others that matter. My son is going to be helping his sister with an [[Art]] page. She hasn't done it out of sheer laziness. 
* [[2019.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]
** I looked up the stats. I'm on the far end of that bellcurve. Druguser! Lol. Pocket pussies are the best. 
* [[2019.06 - Antipleonasm Analysis]]
** Just enough, just enough.
* [[2019.07.01 - Ovy: Frustrated]]
** Jumping into the deepend has been frustrating. He's pulling back some. 
* [[2019.06.30 - Ovy: Discord]]
** I'm doing what I can. I can't see enough of what is missing to connect the dots, and the dots I'm trying to connect aren't always. I am blind, as usual.
* [[Wikilosophy]]
** My wife looks at it and say: "Yeah, that's what you do. So?" It says nothing new.
* [[SS;WR]]
** I still don't understand why firmcoding isn't working for this. My fear is that I allow just any characters into names.
* [[2019.07.01 - Wiki Review: Pieces]]
** That said, I don't think the meta discussions On Marxism did anything beyond crystallize interpretations.
* [[2019.07.01 - TDL: Trip Prep]]
** I think I'm not going to be doing much of those today. It didn't strike me.
* [[2019.07.01 - Prompted Introspection: Season, Winter This Time]]
** I haven't snuggled enough with her lately.
* [[2019.07.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Incomprehensible World]]
** People look at the task of trying to find the truth, recognize the impossibility of perfection, and thus they give upon trying to be [[good]] and [[right]] with false justification.
* [[2019.07.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Grind]]
** Completed. My [[Monthly Audit]] wasn't bad. That said, I still feel like I'm spinning my wheels. That's okay. I suggest it is an immediate gratification pursuit problem.
