title: 2017.08.07 -- Pipefitting Log

Showed up early. Chris was waiting in a dark smoking booth. He let me wander in the rain before coming to get me. Lol. We caught up. We didn't need to be there until 7:30. We talked for an hour. 

The instructor for our Eastman safety class was an old man who looked a heck of a lot like my grandfather (MWF side). His conservativism bled through. The presentation slides on terrorism and IP rights were among the worst. He gave us the answers to our test.

Afterwards we called Christina, our local hr rep. She is a fat bitch, classically insane. An old new Yorker came to give us the Yates (and contractor at Eastman) orientation. Ditto on the test. He was a decent guy.

We eventually followed him in our vehicles. A shuttle took us to the jobsite inside the large Eastman campus. They told us not to bring our tools and lunches, but then we had nothing to eat later when they wouldn't shuttle us back ( not until quitting time).

We sat in the trailor as Christina abused us. She assumed I was stupid for a while, until she asked standard hr questions. Drug test passed. We sat around for hours.

Sam is a black carpenter. He has the uneducated jibberjabber manner of speaking.

Chris was Chris.

David is journeyman fitter. He graduated from Tim's class 4 years ago. I asked lots of questions. Seems smart. His whole family works on this site with Yates.

The day was long and exceptionally disorganized.

I bought a toolbox because I have to.

Most of this was written on my phone. Meh.
