title: 2018.05.10 - Wiki Audit Log: Axioms

* I clearly need to develop my [[axioms]]. I need an [[Axiom Log]] to demonstrate I'm working on that project. Working there.
* It's [[Positive Disintegration: Cheatsheet]], not Personality (thinking shaping). Fixed that sad state of affairs for the most part.
* It's weird, but in creating [[Axiom Log]], I feel like I've offloaded work that belongs in this wiki into another. Did I just make a gigantic mistake? Is this really what I should be doing?
