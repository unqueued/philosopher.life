title: 2018.09.17 - h0p3's Log: Reaching Out

I have clearly been struggling for a while, especially since the recent contact with [[SLT]]. I am considering reaching out to try to reconcile, yet again because I am feel the pull of [[Find The Others]], [[T42T]], and [[The Golden Rule]]. I strongly predict we will fail to make peace. We're both probably going to screw this up. The risk to my person is enormous. But, I am worried that the [[The Moral Law]] requires it.
