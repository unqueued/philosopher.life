I suppose that means you cannot even demand I compute the meaning of your demand. That costs me something; it's a sacrifice to understand and wrestle with you. Further, you cannot demand that I respect anything you have to say, since that is a sacrifice. I should not have to sacrifice my desire to do anything immoral at any time, right?

To never sacrifice anything to anyone means we don't take the time to address, understand, empathize, help, or fulfill obligations to anyone. It is fascinating to attempt to empathize with someone who denies the necessity of empathy, and actively pursues to disable it in us. 

[[Ayn Rand]] is a quintessential example of denying [[The Moral Law]]. There is no [[Golden Rule]] on her view, but she attempts to make it look like she is being fair. Justice as fairness is irrelevant to her. The only justice, in her eyes, is no justice. Ironically, the state of nature is radically more coercive than [[The Original Position]]. She intends evil.
