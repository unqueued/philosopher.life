title: 2019.03.04 - kickscondor

Dear [[kickscondor]],

I am honored and grateful to see you again in the desert. [[I|h0p3]] have not fully felt [[my name|hope]] without you.

<<<
Got damn generosity! Can’t believe you went through all these links, brother. I was watching this go down many weeks ago and just in awe. I mean it’s taken years to collect these links. Now you’re slamming them down like cans of baked beans.
<<<

ROFLMAO. 

`/wipes-tears-from-his-eyes`

It's mighty kind of you to feed this homeless trollbear. Thank you. I was hungry, and you fed me. You nailed [[it|https://href.cool/]], sir. With erotic guts, I [[/b/]]ishly slam food, pogs, bodies, vodka, and links. 

`/giggle`, [[Kickscondor]], you're my kind of gentle riot. Even with a light touch, you lay it on thick. Forgive my [[title.Title]]s; it's how I talk about drowning in my [[Link Log]]s in general. It's a firehose, and like an animal, I just push my whole face into it (my poor eyelids, nostrils, and asshole). 

I have some minor qualifications to make, so please bear with me. I dislike beans,<<ref "y">> so clearly it must be some other food (I have no idea how you did it).<<ref "b">> If we are to stick with the very important common food experience, I might initially suggest they were luxury [[hotdog|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVhOPiM4mk]]s (I do love a good hotdog). It wasn't a common experience at all though! I feel the weight of trying to model it; I'd prefer to stand in silent observation until I couldn't stand it any longer.<<ref "g">> No, as usual, I am obligated to babble about that which is obviously beyond my comprehension. I'm not sure what to call it, friend~~o~~. I am not someone who understands the nature of your artwork enough to tell you what it is all the way down.<<ref "fr">> Cornered, I am forced to [[name it|Alias]]. I box, pigeon-hole, and dub thine work: sifting the common sands for [[diamonds]] and [[redpills]] of [[The Beautiful]] among equals. Your art's gazing reflection reorders the first and the last among us. You do teach me the meaning of [[awe]].

It is obvious your work as a whole is a stunningly delicious [[gem]]. It's antipleonasmic, [[salient]], and robust, with a bouquet of fire, and hints of grace. I appreciate your hospitality, boss. I gobbled up 'em gems-all-night-long-for-breakfast. I adore buffets, banquets, and trying new things. Of course, the impoverished never quite learn how to savor. In addition to my uncouth [[smell|Poem: Scent of Man]] and arrogant posture, I'm afraid my loud mastications and messy, illiterate face don't make for the most pleasant table manners. Even my ugly beard collects food for second-breakfast and elevensies. This untamed, rough, hairy beast is grateful to you!<<ref "hb">>

You serve us a miraculous Dionysian meal. It is elegantly savage and lit. I'm a glutton and an addict; like swine, I gorged myself on your pearls. You've seen my epic lack of self-control and incompetence.<<ref "l">> However, I am not done consuming your years of cultivation and curation. No, this {[[existential beast|About]]} is always hungry. I'm sure you saw that I have not rounded the tail end of yonder holler just yet. As you intend by necessity: some of your links take much, much longer to emotionally reason about than others.

Admittedly, we may have different approaches to how links should be consumed, curated, and organized; I simply don't have nearly as much practice as you do in modeling. I think the balanced organization and modularity are wonderful. Perhaps you slice and dice the gunkiness [[irwartfrr]]. Your work screams the old web reborn to me, but souped up in the right places. It evolves. It's nostalgia done right, and I could only [[hope]] to honor my Saints the way you have honored [[The Great Human Conversation]] on the web. I do not know how one makes something appear like a mere playful toy, but act as a profound tool as you have. It's a hypertext experience hand-picked and hand-crafted for the people and by the people; I hope pyramids grow in its likeness. 

In digesting the contents of the transcendent bangers and beans, I'm convinced you must be a spellcaster who turns trash into treasure and common table water into wine.<<ref "bo">> Even the dining table, cutlery, and marble floors of the catalog are divine. How does one capture the fundamental essence and [[phenomenology]] of Dasein? I do not know. Your artful hospitality to [[Humanity]] is astounding. Clearly, you do a great service to both yourself and [[others]] in your [[existential art|The Existential Game]]. I see transfiguration in the humility of your quadratic sacrifice.

I know little of the information science of categories, let alone the mathematics, let alone the philosophy. I love the way you wrestle, quite effectively, to tell the story. There are functions I didn't expect, and it's a joy to consume; it clicks with me. It reminds me of some of the books I have owned which were so aesthetically pleasing, I would come back to them just to relive and evolve the image I thought I knew. With quiet roars, maybe you have built an icon.

You likely know how we are meant to reason about your own art better than any of us. Ignorantly, I'm doin' it like my pappy taught me, as his pappy taught him. I'm not quite sure how you wished me to systematically baptize myself in your art. I aint so bright, so I usually start off my ritual by baptizing myself with fire before submerging myself in the still waters. As usual, I have no idea what I'm doing. I just dove in.<<ref "k0">>

Of course, just because I've seen it once doesn't mean I'm not going to see and think about it again. No, my mind wanders, sometimes into extrema, and it has to come back. I often find I must iterate over concepts to grow my representations of them; repetition is necessary for memory and evolution. This is what my hyperreading toward deepreading sometimes feels like. Sometimes it has to sit with me, and I have to come back for seconds (and thirds). Even my second pass was fast; it sat with me in my belly, I puked it up in the ayahuascan vomitorium (even my puke was delicious to me), and then I went to feast again. Give me time; some kinds of work take years to process. I'm sure it took you quite some time to reason your way to it as well.

Obviously, you are the got dang generous one in sharing yourself and your stunning work with us! With hinting commentary, updates, posh art, and marvelous categorization, you served us yourself via others as yourself. I so rarely get to say it to anyone: I see [[The Golden Rule]] in your [[art]]. [[YWSOAM]]. Librarians pick out [[salience]] in us for us. Indeed, even a blind prophet can see you are a [[Public Self-Modeler]]. You do know how to point to the oasis in the desert, nomad.

<<<
You passed off a bunch of the zine and lit mag stuff to k0sh3k. This got me to pay closer attention to her wiki. Friend-o, I think I’ve bailed on yours to read hers. It’s a trove!
<<<

Passover my wiki as you please, Sir [[Kicks]]. I am sure you know how to pick out the [[salience]] like none [[other]]. Please, feast away, angel.

As you've seen in the consumption of my [[Link Log]]s, I pass food around the table to her and others. I hope to see through her eyes; I simply cannot afford to trust my own eyes in too many areas of the desert. 

It's fascinating that this is what caused you to pay closer attention to her wiki.

I [[hope]] yall hookup; I have no idea why we've taken this long. She is my best friend in the world, so I bet you both have enormous bridges in common. It would be quite an opportunity for me to see you more directly through the [[diamond]] of my life. 

She is treasure beyond my {[[dreams]]}. I would joyously sell my possessions to purchase the rights to be in her field of vision. It is serendipity that I have enough room in the cybernetic city of log-towers jutting out of my vision-perception organs to see the world and myself in and through her dazzling reflections. She is like an eternal well in the desert and a gift to all who know her. She is living proof of [[The Good]]. I know I wrestle a Heaven-on-Earth angel.

<<<
This is XD. Love her quotes collection—it rivals yours. I appreciate the papers she links to, and I’ve liked discovering things like [[John Ayliff’s site|http://www.johnayliff.com/]] and the [[Dante’s Inferno Topography|https://www.alpacaprojects.com/inferno/en/]]. Tell her I’d be interesting in seeing more of her fiction recommendations—not just novels, but any short stories or poems she’s encountered.
<<<

I am, of course, flattered to have the opportunity to pass messages to you both. We are often each others' lookouts, couriers, and proxies in the desert. Blest be the tie that binds. Say "hello" to each member of your family for me as well. XOXO.

One of my more egregiously effective teachers would selectively smile in the classroom, and that's when you knew you were reductio-toast.jpg (henceforth //reductioast//).<<ref "h">> I can almost smell the burning stroke coming on. You have my attention, and I am wet with paranoid anticipation. Among the many questions I'm supposed to know the answer to already: why didn't you just address her directly? 

I have attempted to speak on her behalf as best I could. I aim to be her fitting vessel. Whether or not she chooses to engage isn't up to me (which is not to say she has no obligations to do so). I asked my brother [[JRE]] for you too. Sometimes indirectness and proxying is the morally best option available to me; sometimes that is all I have to give. I beg you forgive our rudeness. Each in the household has answered you.

<<<
//(Actually, for both of you: what would you add to href.cool—like given everything else I’ve linked to, what notable omissions are there??)//
<<<

I am not qualified to know. I don't have what it takes to build what you are building. You've seen the giant heap I have. I can't model it like you can. This is one of those long-term goals in overcoming my retardations. I will be on the look-out though. We had a few bits of overlap between my links and yours too, so surely I should be able to find more in time. Part of the issue is that you have an eclectic and massively open-ended taste, and I'm not sure what foods suit your palate and why.<<ref "es">>  

Are you asking for a "For [[kickscondor]]:"? Hey, I'll try, as long as you don't mind even more of me being constantly wrong (you must be used to it by now). I don't think I'm going to succeed, but hopefully you'll signal to me how to shape it. 

<<<
Oh and I am most intrigued (and grateful) for her pages on homeschooling.
<<<

She does a good job. I'm grateful too. There are some topics she is wildly more qualified to teach.

<<<
For me, this is an ideal.
<<<

You will have to slow down even further for me. I'm a slowpoke. There is a robust asymmetry (though not a bottleneck) in our communications.

I wish to appreciate why you think it is the ideal. For me, it is only the practically ideal (there are likely many technical problems with this word) insofar as it is up to us. I see far more possibility in the world, but very little is up to me. I think my children would benefit from far more than I can provide them. Perhaps more ideally (as you may imply), the ~2 billion children on the planet would receive world class educations. I am, of course, bound by [[The Moral Law]] to be unsatisfied by the injustice.

<<<
I don’t work in public school because I feel it’s an ideal—it’s just the common experience, so it’s very important.
<<<

[[YWSOAM]], but I don't know what you mean.<<ref "da">> Schools are important to me too! Unfortunately, you have lost me, teacher. I am sorry. Common among what population? Teaching in public schools is not exactly a common experience, but learning in them, yes. If common experience is what you're after, I suggest hard labor and exploitation. I agree that empathy with common experiences is very important, especially in virtue of attempting to map out the instrumental means to achieving the ideal particularized to the contexts which are up to us. I make no claim to excellence here, but I do try. I ask you to elaborate. It is likely the case we agree to an enormous amount, though perhaps from different approaches.

One day, one of my favorite teachers, Sir Duane Smith, picked up his books, slammed them on the ground (or was it the table?), and screamed at me: "[[h0p3]], you are the most arrogant person I've ever met in my entire life!" He stormed out of the room; class ended early that day. My [[wife]] started laughing uncontrollably (my teacher might have been a tad arrogant himself once'd in a while...them Harvard Theological men): several students did.<<ref "gt">> I was stunned. That day, my wife and I took a walk. I had no idea she liked me at the time (oh, I miss all the signals when I don't even know I'm supposed to be looking for them); we were thinking about class together. I eventually went to apologize to this teacher, even though I still felt I was correct. I still do. The argument was about what it means to "box God in." Of course, I have always been a foolish, hardheaded manboy who never quite understood what transcendence means. My argument was basically:

"God is Good. Since you agree that proposition is true, then you agree to boxing God in. That's what names and predicates do. We're trying to speak about the ineffable."

I don't [[right]]ly know how to speak about [[The Good]] good enough. I am afraid it is necessary though insufficient to box, sir. I do [[hope]] to pursue that which is important by definition as best I can: that would be the ideal for me. I am, of course, interested in what you believe is important and why.

<<<
But if every kid could have the freedom to learn at home and have the guidance of their parents—man, that is a dream.
<<<

To some huge extent, I agree! That is much, much closer to the ideal.  

<<<
I do follow a similar schedule to hers during the summer with my kids.
<<<

I have no doubt all your children are extremely lucky to learn from you. 

<<<
(I must highly recommend Kieran Egan’s //The Educated Mind//—this book is not some tips-and-tricks book, it backs you out from all that to look at wtf we’re doing. I would bet it’ll confirm some things for her.)
<<<

Thank you for the reading recommendation! It's on the way.

<<<
I also love that she says “blargle” just like you. Come on—she writes it in the same way with the same letters. It hits with the same quality.
<<<

Ack. XD. Got damn, I tell yahwat. Blargle. In order to increase my ability to actively empathize, I am taking on and using some of the vocabulary of [[others]]- this is something that happens to me, I notice - my voice is malleable, molded by the books or people or voices or games or obsessions I immerse myself in.

I could only [[hope]] to speak the languages of others, including my wife's, as well as they speak mine. It is a constant [[disintegration obligates reintegration|Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]] effort. I'm pretty bad at learning languages in so many cases, so it is such high praise to say it hits with even a faithful semblance of her quality!<<ref "r">>

One day, I will be able speak yours more clearly. As usual, I'm not much of a modeler (I really do look like an ape typing on his keyboard about [[The Infinite]]). In likely multiple senses, with your got damn modeling generosity, I assume you're learnin' me your blargles as we speak.

<<<
Feels weird that I’m addressing you rather than her.
<<<

I'm sorry. That's my fault. I have clearly misunderstood. [[House_h0p3]] has been rude and lacking hospitality.<<ref "vpn">> Let's fix that!

<<<
I figure that if she wants to reply on her wiki, then it’ll be a real conversation. Otherwise, you can just pass on my sentiments. (This is one of the interesting things about this format where we’re openly conversing—not on a forum or on an e-mail list, but just by loose association on the web—this isn’t a conversation where I can sense who’s in on it. Compare this with some of the conversations that your bookwyrm has had lately—with people dropping in and chatting her face off from [[time to time|http://k0sh3k.philosopher.life/#Friday%2C%2015%20February%202019]]. She can choose to read this on her own time, listen to it or ignore it, maybe continue it. That such an advantage and I will gladly trade that for the uncertainty of whether it actually ever reaches her.
<<<

Conversations are complicated even when they are face-to-face. More fully virtualizing them adds many complexities. I can appreciate your desire for real conversation. Like so many things, I do not know how to define "conversation" well enough. Conversational conventions and implicatures are not easy for an autist to understand; obligations are even harder.

If I may add, even your own writing appears to have so many loose associations and references (a good thing!). As my wife will attest, subtext is not my skill, but I'm trying to learn. I certainly appreciate uncertainty to some [[dok]]; it can enable open progress. Even [[hope]] arises from uncertainty.

<<<
I also feel a bit like I end up talking about you and Sphyg and the other self-modelers out there, without considering that this is a family effort for you all. And your whole house is doing a bang-up job showing how to participate in each other’s lives in this way.
<<<

That is high praise. We are doing our best. I think we have a lot of room to grow, of course. 

<<<
Can you tell me—am I okay to link to the other wikis in your family? Like on href.cool and on my home page? I feel like they are designed to be a bit more private, but perhaps I’ve invented that.
<<<

Go for it! I trust you to be fair. As I have said to you before, even concerning your own children, privacy obligations are contextual. Being in public is quite a commitment. Of course, there is much to lose, but we must all learn how to fittingly participate as ourselves in public dialectics.<<ref "hs">>  I know you will be a wise friend, teacher, librarian, and interlocutor with and regarding my children, [[kicks]]. I jealously grant it to few. Bubbles grow and pop. 

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
