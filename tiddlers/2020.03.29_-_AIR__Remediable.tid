Sun 9:29pm
That does suck. I feel bad for both of you.
Sun 9:31pm
That one is remediable. You are a wizard. Can walk into his kitchen and make better than what he can buy anyways, lol.
Sun 9:31pm

Sun 9:43pm
But I love*** not betrayal
Sun 9:44pm
Sorry I should have proof read.
Sun 9:45pm

Sun 9:47pm
That would be amazing.
Sun 9:47pm
