"""
2:01 PM] robotic_scarab: glad to read about AIR talking with you yesterday! reading about your losing touch with him last year was painful/worrying.
[3:11 PM] h0p3: I'm relived and happy. It's awful asking: Is he alive? Is he healthy? Is he hungry? Is he cold? Is he alone? Sounds like a year of hard work and transformation for him. Time away from everyone may have been exactly what needed. I'm grateful he's come out on other side intact.

[1:28 PM] h0p3: I have no idea if one should go to the cuddle party either in our case, but if you do go, I hope it's excellent. It's been on your calendar for a while now. I assume that sucks to miss.
[1:29 PM] robotic_scarab: I'm likely not going :(
[1:29 PM] h0p3: :frowning:
[1:29 PM] h0p3: I'm sorry.
[1:29 PM] robotic_scarab: was feeling pretty mucus-y this morning, and given that the facilitators are traveling in & also spend time in NY (where there's a lot of it going around) I'm not sure it's wise to participate
[1:30 PM] robotic_scarab: it does suck to miss though -- I was hoping they would postpone and reschedule it, but it looks like that won't be the case as of right now
[1:35 PM] h0p3: Quarantine isn't so bad for me. I naturally practice it, lol. I'm hoping this mess will pass and it can be rescheduled.
[1:38 PM] h0p3: Btw, neither here nor there, if you ever want or need to visit us (any time or day) you are welcome.
[1:40 PM] robotic_scarab: yeah, I don't feel particularly affected by staying away from other people, lol. Coding, video games, wiki -- lots of things to do on my computer -- and since the weather is getting nicer there's no reason not to go hiking or walking too.
[1:41 PM] robotic_scarab: thank you! I would extend the same offer but it's not really possible when I'm only renting a room and not a full apartment space or house :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
[1:41 PM] robotic_scarab: hopefully next year or the year after I'll be making an east coast trip and get to drop by and say hello :)
[1:41 PM] h0p3: That would be rad.
