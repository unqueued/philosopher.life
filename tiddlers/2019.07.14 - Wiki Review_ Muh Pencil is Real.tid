title: 2019.07.14 - Wiki Review: Muh Pencil is Real

* [[2019.07.13 - /b/]]
** That was a thought I forgot to write down, and then it came back to me. I am reminded of a famous pragmatic answer to the external world problem in analytic philosophy.

** I regret he thinks our discourse is a burden. Yeah, it's something I'm wrestling with. It's expensive. But, I aim to give him my best correspondence. 
*** Now I'm worried that I'm being a burden on him. I am a terrible interpreter.

** Bad sleeping schedule, but much lower stress. It's hard to complain, lol.

** Doing okay today. It ain't perfect.

** Odd event today. Someone responded to me and deleted their account after I saluted them (of course, I read through their account; I was curious about why they were an asshole to me).

** That question should have been phrased differently.

** Completed. My schedule, of course, is bonkers. I'm enjoying it well enough though.
* [[2019.07.13 - 4GAA: A Letter]]
** I need to finish it quickly. There's no reason not to deliver asap.
* [[2019.07.13 - 4GAA: Opening Sequence]]
** I got downvoted throughout that thread (and so were the people being nice to me). I thought I offended her somehow. Awesome to see it may be a real connection. Those are quite rare for me.

** I'm vain enough to shorten for the ASCII art.

** Still evolving quickly. It's going to take some time to get something functional. I'm getting hits on things which aren't relevant, and the F5Bot is not functioning according to the specs. It's by far the more performant of the options though. I'll train up a fit list here soon enough though.
