title: 2018.01.18 -- h0p3's Log: Handle Bars

I flew off the handle bars today. For the umpteenth time, my son has left his area of the living room a pigsty. It feels like it doesn't matter what I tell him, he's not going to try to care about his environment. I roared at him, and obviously, I scared him. I think we both feel incompetent.

I think I've finally understood that my brother doesn't want to chat with me. If he wanted to chat with me, he'd keep that line of communication open. He elects not to keep it open, whether he realizes it or not. I have no control over that fact at this point; I've asked many times (well past the point of rudeness). That's okay.

He has no interest in any of my written communications. Edit: take that back, he actually spent 40 minutes reading {[[About]]}

It is possible that he has unkind reasons for this, but I think he's depressed. =(
