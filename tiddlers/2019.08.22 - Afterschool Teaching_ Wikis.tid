I did all the prep and even had treats for my children. I also brought the Persepolis book I promised 8Gf; [[redpill]] hard, my dear.

Matt stopped by the office to talk. I poured my praise for his reading program. He's brought his own giant library for them. Rock out, sir. He's gotta be part of the reason for what I see, and I [[hope]] he doesn't lose the spark.

Madame Bacon slices and dices. For a second, I was worried I had offended her, but she doesn't give two shits what I think except when she does. I adore her. Her sarcasm is gorgeous, and she aims not to do bullshit. I think found an[[other]]. Jackpot. I know she [[love]]s the children too. She and VPParker are handling 5th together each day, and they are revamping what occurs. I'm excited to see these elementary school at-risk kids getting tag-teamed by the likes of her and Mr. backup. It is here that codified anticodificationism becomes so salient. 

I did the [[Fitness Routine]] with my students. It was like pulling teeth.

Nobody could get the consoles to work with the old TV. =/ 

7CM's mom is giving her cigarettes to calm down. =(

Multiple games of magic playing, and it was awesome. 7L has a solid attention span. I'm pleased with his work. Dredge is a terrible deck to learn with, lol. 

7L+C were talking to their parents and said I'm their favorite teacher this year. Well, we'll see after I start pushing them, lol. Our wrestling has only started.

6NP is living in the corner, having our come to Jesus discussions, and I'm going break him. Hate me all you want; your easiest way out is to follow the basics of [[The Moral Law]] here. Lots of people are having trouble with him again. 

5AO and 7NS joined us at the wiki roundtable. I couldn't convince 8G, and I don't understand why. In any case, people are excited about building their own wikis. I have 4 students who want to do this. Neat. I don't care if I lose my job for it. It's the best tool I know.
