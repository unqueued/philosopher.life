!! What is the redpilled prediction of cryptocurrency?

Governments will try to stop it. Unless darknets can be killed, I don't see that happening. As wireless takes off, mesh will eventually prevent the prevention of darknets on a physical basis, imho, unless we are truly under totalitarian fascinate regimes.

The next cutoff is exchanging. That will be a lot trickier. That said, the war on drugs failed crazy hard. A war on bits of data will be even more futile.

Of course, there is a possbility it will be consumed and integrated into mutli-nationals. There is litttle we can do to stop that ecause they are politically supreme.

I worry that the tool we use to defeat and sidestep those in power will eventually be used against us.

I am convinced crytpocurrencies are inevitable until the fall of humankind. However, I am not convinced we the people ing eleral will be the beneficiaries. 

I do not buy the Libertarian paradise, just as they do not buy into the concept of communist paradise.
