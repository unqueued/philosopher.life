title: 2019.11.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Fascism

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Fascism has shown that it can gather mass support. In many nations the far right, including fascism, has become a popular oppositional force to the new globalized imperialism. In many countries the far right has replaced the left as the main political opposition. It doesnâ€™t get more critical than this. This stands the old leftist notion about fascism on its head.

Globalized imperialism seems fascist to me. I'm not opposed to globalization conceptually, of course (far from it), but it's pretty obvious a tiny fraction of a fraction of our population hoards most of the political [[power]] for the sake of continued power centralization. Under the correct conditions, an oligarchy can be totalitarian. Capitalists violate the rights of persons on a scale so breathtaking, I don't have another word for it beyond fascism. 

I'll agree the far right is politically opposed to the will of the average person, and I would argue moreso than the far left. The far right, however, appears to be enforcing, protecting, and cultivating select forms of fascism. I'll agree that many people have started voting far right, even for clowns, because they believe they are fighting the establishment, but I'm not sure why I should consider it political opposition.
