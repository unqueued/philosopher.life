title: 2018.09.15 -- Deep Reading: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

Kreecher's loyalty and rulebreaking reminds me of Lying Cat in [[Saga]]. It bends the rules given to us by Rowling. 

I adore how Rowling shows us different [[dok]] of reactionary political ideologies.

I adore the juridical aspects of this book.
