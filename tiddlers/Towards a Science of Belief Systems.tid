title: Towards a Science of Belief Systems

//Lawd, this text is stunningly gorgeous. It's amazing, even if wrong.//

Descriptivist, moral anti-realist, physicalist logical positivism. Empiricism's quant. The neutrality of "belief system" is acceptable, just as "government" for the legal positivist cannot, by definition, speak of justification (even if it clearly plays a conceptual role in such a thing). This book explicitly aims for empiricism's annexation of rationality, and as such, it must fail to reason about the ideal wisely enough. Some version of Saint Kant is correct here. The ultimately unjustified elitism of science rears its ugly and necessarily insufficient head yet again in philosophy of mind, epistemology, metaethics, etc.

[A] remark like //I don’t have any belief system,  I  just  accept the evidence//  does  sound  rather  similar to //I don’t have any false beliefs, I only believe things I think I have good grounds for believing// – which is not unrespectable, but is hardly distinctive.
<<<

I have false beliefs which is exactly why I aim to only believe things I think have good grounds for believing. That is a belief system, and I accept evidence in virtue of it.

<<<
Science is neither the only kind of knowledge in existence, nor the only valid kind... A science of belief systems, then, must be general. Precisely for this reason, it must steer clear of a priori constructions or premature generalizations.
<<<

It cannot by definition steer clear of them all. I'm still not sold that you see what consists in valid justifications for and definitions of knowledge. Seems like a token phrase.

<<<
Instead of issuing arbitrary diktats, the science of belief systems must be concerned to find out what things people have actually believed
<<<

What makes you think you don't have arbitrary diktats in developing your epistemic method around the science of belief systems? You can't escape this problem, and I think it would be best if you tried to say it up front.

<<<
We  would  not  be  justified  in imposing a division between ‘ethical’ and ‘ontological’ propositions onto belief systems where no such division is actually made or felt.
<<<

Oh, I'm sorry, can you justify why we aren't justified in this? We do not escape this problem.

<<<
The  science  of  belief  systems  is  interested  in  those  beliefs  that  cohere into systems rather than in beliefs indiscriminately.
<<<

Seems like any arbitrary set of beliefs can be called a system. What standard are you going to be able to justify for us?

<<<
An objective science of belief systems can neither presuppose nor establish the truth or falsehood of any particular belief.
<<<

[[ITS]] self-reference applies Standard logical positivist failure, right? You are developing the science from the outside. What then is the non-scientific aspects of your method?
