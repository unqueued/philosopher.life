title: 2017.05.06 - Realpolitik Speculation: Russian Intervention in French Elections

For at least the past few months, Russian actors have been interfering with the French presidential election. The French have been subject to similar Russian intervention tactics that the Americans experienced. Russia has done this over the decades (France was targeted in 1974), as have the hypocritical Americans. 

We've seen the same kinds of "fake news" propaganda injections into French memetic networks. Macron's computing infrastructure has been the target of significant hacks, with sensitive private data released into the wild. Russian news for Russians favors Le Pen as well.

Russia, or at least the Kremlin, obviously wants Le Pen to win. There is a famous picture of Le Pen and Putin shaking hands, and the PR moment means something. She's yet another alt-right insanity candidate which Russia wants to see elected. Russia wants that triple crown: Brexit, Trump, and Le Pen. 

If France were to elect Le Pen, there is a good chance they would Frexit the EU, and with it, bring the entire EU down. That would be the last straw. Similarly, Russia wants to damage NATO. Recall, of course, that these are significant competitors and opposers of Russian interests. Russia would benefit, however much they claim they wouldn't, from the lifting of sanctions. 

Putin may be to blame, but he's not the only sinner here. Vitally, I'm not accepting Russia as the bogeyman which we must fear so greatly that we give up our freedoms. I am convinced that our deep government is every bit as evil as Putin, only they are more successful in forcing their vision upon the world. First and foremost, I blame those in power.

However, I also blame ourselves for creating uneducated masses that can be swayed like this, for lacking a bullshit-detector, for people being unable to curate information for themselves, for anti-intellectualism, and for a lack of critical reasoning. I blame ourselves for building insecure infrastructures with built-in backdoors instead of going for publicly funded maximum security opensource software and hardware. I blame humanity for being human.

My hope is two-fold:

* The French aren't as stupid as the Americans. I predicted Trump would win the election in early 2016 (long before the election), despite mainstream predictions finding it unthinkable. This time, I believe the mainstream predictions are likely correct: Macron will win.
** I would like to add that Macron is still likely a terrible choice in the end. I'm not saying the French are brilliant. They clearly fucked up in the first stage of their elections.
* If we are exceptionally lucky (and we won't be), the American people will see what Russia has been doing and realize that our government is playing the exact same game. Cliché time: we must revolt against those in power. Get woke, sheeple. Fight the power. Take it back while you still can.
