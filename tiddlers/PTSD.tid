title: PTSD

DSM-5 defines PTSD as follows:

Criterion A (one required): The person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence, in the following way(s):

* Direct exposure
* Witnessing the trauma
* Learning that a relative or close friend was exposed to a trauma
* Indirect exposure to aversive details of the trauma, usually in the course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, medics)

Criterion B (one required): The traumatic event is persistently re-experienced, in the following way(s):

* Intrusive thoughts
* Nightmares
* Flashbacks
* Emotional distress after exposure to traumatic reminders
* Physical reactivity after exposure to traumatic reminders

Criterion C (one required): Avoidance of trauma-related stimuli after the trauma, in the following way(s):

* Trauma-related thoughts or feelings
* Trauma-related reminders

Criterion D (two required): Negative thoughts or feelings that began or worsened after the trauma, in the following way(s):

* Inability to recall key features of the trauma
* Overly negative thoughts and assumptions about oneself or the world
* Exaggerated blame of self or others for causing the trauma
* Negative affect
* Decreased interest in activities
* Feeling isolated
* Difficulty experiencing positive affect

Criterion E (two required): Trauma-related arousal and reactivity that began or worsened after the trauma, in the following way(s):

* Irritability or aggression
* Risky or destructive behavior
* Hypervigilance
* Heightened startle reaction
* Difficulty concentrating
* Difficulty sleeping

Criterion F (required): Symptoms last for more than 1 month.

Criterion G (required): Symptoms create distress or functional impairment (e.g., social, occupational).

Criterion H (required): Symptoms are not due to medication, substance use, or other illness.

Two specifications:

* Dissociative Specification. In addition to meeting criteria for diagnosis, an individual experiences high levels of either of the following in reaction to trauma-related stimuli:
** Depersonalization. experience of being an outside observer of or detached from oneself (e.g., feeling as if "this is not happening to me" or one were in a dream).
** Derealization: experience of unreality, distance, or distortion (e.g., "things are not real").
* Delayed Specification. Full diagnostic criteria are not met until at least six months after the trauma(s), although onset of symptoms may occur immediately.

------------------------------

My plain, visceral thought: anyone who has seriously and consistently contemplated suicide to escape pain has experienced real trauma. Call it PTSD or whatever you want. 

Let's walk through this list and see if I have PTSD:

''Criterion A ''

I've never been exposed to "death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence" in any of their ways, from what I can tell. The 4th way in the criterion seems philosophically important to me (as well as the difference found between DSM-4 and DSM-5), since it demonstrates that the very definition of PTSD is becoming more inclusive and capturing a broader spectrum of people. I believe they are onto something there. Trauma is a broad concept, and I think it may include more things than death and violence. I think I fall on the PTSD spectrum. 

I did see terrible accidents in Thailand (some included children). While extremely painful and difficult to process (because it's truly fucked up), I don't think that has been the real or sole cause of my crisis. In a way, it was my plight to navigate these roads (I used a dirt-bike with street wheels for fat farang). I couldn't fully empathize with myself, the danger I was in, since it wasn't practical. 

As far as the images I've seen, jesus. I've been a 4chan user since college (around 2004, about a year after the site came online). I've seen some vile shit on the internet. Definitely traumatic. Enough to cause PTSD? I don't think so.

These experiences may have added to my problems, but I don't they are the core issues. My problem probably didn't crescendo and peak into PTSD territory until these past couple years. 

My hypothesis is that I decided I wanted to kill myself about two years ago. Some part of me threatened myself. It was a serious. Hating yourself, your life, and your world so much that you threaten yourself with harm may be a source of trauma. 

Further, I don't want to be enslaved by a God I don't believe in (as my tattoo, which literally says "Slave to the God," suggests). I also don't want to be enslaved by the ruling class. I'd prefer death to slavery. I think my belief that the world is coming to an [[end|The End of Humanity]] is also traumatic. I deeply believe people suck down to the core; I think they are fundamentally selfish. It has been a real loss of innocence for the gullible, autistic fool that is me.

Lastly, I take having been wrong about value, freedom, and purpose as something which has caused me to curl up into a defensive ball. It is hard to rationally accept the irrationality of our existence. As a friend of mine used to say, we're a "box of contradictions." I have a hard time living with that. My logical options are being sealed up, one by one. I feel like I'm trying to escape a rational hell using reason. Lol. Anyways. I do think I have serious trauma, enough to cause PTSD.

''Criterion B''

Intrusive thoughts, check. They are less common and far more controllable now! I have the power to dismiss it more effectively. I am so thankful.

Nightmares. What is a nightmare? Do I have dreams that I despise, that prevent me from having a good night of sleep? Yes, all the time. I have a very difficult time falling asleep, and my dreams often interrupt my sleep (makes it hard to want to go back to sleep).

What are flashbacks? Am I constantly reminded of past events where I humilitated myself (these aren't mere shower-thoughts moments) throughout the day? Yes. Do I relive what I have seen? Yes. Am I faced with the same existential questions hour after hour? Yes. Is there a single moment that I focus on? No. 

Does talking with my parents, or even the thought of talking with them (particularly when I find myself in a thoughtloop of engaging in hypothetical conversations with them) count as a reminder? I do get panic attacks (I've never had a heart attack, but it feels like what I imagine it would be to have one), although I've learned to control them more (and cannabis helps me swallow it).

''Criterion C''

I don't know. What counts as avoidance? Does finding myself unable to communicate with my parents (who I dearly love) count as avoidance of trauma-related stimuli? My job/location history might signify it, but it's actually fairly normal migration for a millenial and an autistic person.

''Criterion D''

Nuh-uh. No, I don't have overly negative thoughts and assumptions about oneself or the world. Lol. I hope I do. I need to be wrong about it.

Fuck, this criterion pegs me hard. The entire list.

''Criterion E''

Ditto. I don't know what to say. I fit the description, at least to some degree, of every condition. I feel sad and relieved when I see this list.

''Criterion F''

Check.

''Criterion G''

Check.

''Criterion H''

This one is less clear. I have gone for months without substance use (because I was afraid that was the problem), but still experienced the negative effects, suicidal ideation, etc. Further, maybe autism, depression, and anxiety explain the symptoms better.

''Dissociative Specification''

I do not think I fit this one. It all seems very real to me. I feel a split in myself, but I see myself as possessing both intuition networks.

''Delayed Specification''

I might fit this one. As I said, this issue has crescendoed.
