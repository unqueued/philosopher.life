I am liking [[Root]] as a tab!
MON 11:40 PM
Oh wow. Thank you for posting this. You're lettin' it hang out =)
MON 11:44 PM
Also, the domain reminds me of "Crucible"
MON 11:50 PM
Also, draft tag is dropped: https://philosopher.life/#2018.11.21%20-%20Sphygmus%3A%20Thanksgiving:Root%20%5B%5BLegal%20Notice%5D%5D%20%5B%5B2018.11.21%20-%20Sphygmus%3A%20Thanksgiving%5D%5D

thanks! I keep associating "Root" with your Hub/Pin pages instead of your actual [[Root]] page, so that's why it's a tab.
TUE 1:34 AM
Agreed!
TUE 1:35 AM
I've not figured out how much I want to share yet, and my system consists of a "shared" folder in my main wiki that is symlinked to my sphygmus wiki that I then build into a single file and WinSCP to my desktop and then to //sphygm.us from my desktop :joy:
TUE 1:36 AM
(I put the individual tids into the shared folder)
TUE 1:36 AM
So, hence the various not-linked links.
TUE 1:36 AM
Sometimes I like to think of [[Hub]]/[[Pin]] as bookmarking and sidebar tooling of a file manager/browser (Dolphin is exceptional in this respect). [[Root]] represents a virtual filesystem for me.
TUE 1:36 AM
Ah, that makes sense.
TUE 1:37 AM
Someday I'll figure out rsync and cut my desktop out of the picture but I'm not there yet, lool
TUE 1:37 AM
It is possible that Bob will be a good tool here for you (I do not know).
TUE 1:37 AM
I imagine (though I do not know how) that one can tag the public subwiki within your private and have Bob export it.
TUE 1:38 AM
I haven't gotten to the point where I've built a bookmark/sidebar in my wiki yet - I think of my root both as my file system and my navigation, ish. Though there are definitely links I will make a bookmark section for someday.
TUE 1:38 AM
yeah Bob would be a huge step up I'm sure
TUE 1:39 AM
It's just not been on my priority list yet
TUE 1:39 AM
slash it doesn't make any sense to me yet XD
TUE 1:39 AM
me neither! I'm still figuring out what it can do...it's hard for me to see it all.
TUE 1:40 AM
It seems like a very large...thing, with lots of moving parts. My setup hasn't caused me enough pain to overcome the inertia against changing, lol
TUE 1:41 AM
With Kin and powerful filterlists, I think something like Tiddytool will make tagging very powerful (even automated tagging for extracting out your public wiki).
TUE 1:41 AM
Aye. You are in good shape starting with node.
TUE 1:42 AM
It will slot straight into Bob.
TUE 1:42 AM
what is Kin? and I'm curious how the domain reminds you of "Crucible"? I'm not sure I see the reference.
TUE 1:42 AM
lucible
TUE 1:42 AM
ahhh yes
TUE 1:42 AM
also not sure if it was obvious in the update scanner or not, but my buttons are now version 2.1 :)
TUE 1:43 AM
I added a "new tiddler here" button based on the <<currentTiddler>>
TUE 1:43 AM
It's that linked box button, lots of details in its own tab in the plugin
TUE 1:44 AM
I cannot say I understand Kin. I am not there yet. It appears to enable one to recursively (which has been half my problem with js in a wiki my size) traverse relationships among tags (and I see possibly titles coming in the near future).
TUE 1:44 AM
Kin looks insanely powerful.
TUE 1:44 AM
ohhh like "Kin of this tiddler"
TUE 1:44 AM
I'll have to look at it, sounds useful
TUE 1:44 AM
I noted that. I haven't yet pushed to my wiki yet. [[j3d1h]] and I didn't have much time to explore it today.
TUE 1:44 AM
Yes. It looks OP. I've not benchmarked it yet.
TUE 1:45 AM
But, I've not moved to 5.1.18 either
TUE 1:45 AM
and, for the time being, I'm not going to.
TUE 1:45 AM
Reading about the new button now.
TUE 1:47 AM
sounds good! I changed a few small things in the buttons from the weekend but the new button is the biggest change. I only really made it to my specs, but I think I fleshed it out enough that you should be able to change it to suit whatever your needs are.
TUE 1:47 AM
The icon doesn't show up for me (I get some gibberish characters as a placeholder instead).
TUE 1:47 AM
:)
TUE 1:47 AM
hrm
TUE 1:47 AM
issue with how I made the .tid, probably
TUE 1:48 AM
The Unicode showed on my non-updated machine so I hoped it would be visible everywhere else :P
TUE 1:49 AM
Thank you for the detailed explanation of the tool (and why you went the direction  you've gone).
TUE 1:49 AM
damn Unicode rendering! I never can tell which devices icons will show up on (not visible on my phone at all x_x)
TUE 1:50 AM
I figured by explaining how I got to where I went, changes could be made to go other directions!
TUE 1:51 AM
For example if the tag date rendering isn't necessary then tm-new-tiddler is all that's needed to make the new one
TUE 1:52 AM
and it changes too, the brackets: "⦗⦘" didn't show up in all my browsers until recently
TUE 1:52 AM
O.o
TUE 1:52 AM
Yes, those breadcrumbs will be useful. We will continue to try to engineer it.
TUE 1:52 AM
I am convinced that some version of this tool should be in a default TW.
TUE 1:53 AM
I have no idea how to go about talking to the devs about it :sweat_smile: (or my flexbox for that matter) but I'm grateful for your encouragement in the matter!
TUE 1:54 AM
hmu if you want, when you're engineering / if you run into trouble. It took me all day to work out the kinks in the button
TUE 1:55 AM
The invisible incremented tiddler stumped me for like...at least 30 minutes and I was the one who made that choice! Felt so silly when I figured that out.
TUE 1:56 AM
Aside: I've been seeing a lot of incremental talk on the forums recently too.
TUE 1:57 AM
(I've been dreaming wiki code the past couple days :joy:)
TUE 1:57 AM
It still feels like I'm reading gibberish on there, sadly.
TUE 1:57 AM
Lol, like Tetris.
TUE 1:57 AM
exactly like Tetris!! XP
TUE 1:57 AM
I dream about writing in my wiki too. I'll have a thought and see myself traversing the sidebar and writing it out. Tetris-Wiki 4 Life.
TUE 1:58 AM
2017 is ending?? :joy::stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
TUE 10:38 PM
OH I'm dumb ignore me you probably meant 2017 in the remodeling (I got confused reading your TDL haha)
TUE 10:40 PM
You are correct. It should say 2018. I had the remodeling on the brain, but you saw that too. Feels like I have so much to get done before the year is up.
