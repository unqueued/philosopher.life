title: Recurring Patterned Redistributivism

//Pay no attention to this crackpot insanity. Gonna break a billion theorems and rules in here to explore.//

!! Problems

* Decentralizing the means of highly complex productions can't always be atomized sufficiently without stock-based abstractions.
* Taxing the wealthy, especially the transnational elite, is highly improbable and currently ineffective.
* Corporations aren't people, but we give them the powers without the responsibilities; this enables them to be unaccountable psychopathic emergent agents which centralize power and exploit the world.
* The rules of taxation are too complicated, the public taxation infrastructure is too sparse.
* Both wealth and the means of productions have to be decentralized as a necessary condition to defeating capitalism's corrupting influence on political systems.

!! Openness & Security

* Auditability, provability above performance in practice
** Though high-performance simulation platform
* Zero-IP, FOSS
** make it easy for the world to transition
* Bug-bounty
* Postquant+25519

!! Money Agent Identity

* Identities/accounts are nationally registered on the distributed ledger.
** Money is public knowledge, period.

* Ledger government pays no transaction fees, obviously.

* Atomic/individuals get one account, free, real-ID.
* Complex/molecular/corporate accounts aren't free, but atomic and complex can form complex.
** Nestable, shellable, stackable
** Proxyable multi-sig
** Proportional ownership
** Complete trail of proportional ownership back to individuals

!! Taxing Money

* Complex
** Exponentially scaling, progressive, marginal tax per complex account registration, ownership modification
** Flat monthly molecular account maintenance fee.

* Transaction (Automated Payment Transaction tax)
** Bare minimum flat transaction fee for infrastructure (a la stamps)
*** Everyone should pay their fair share here, right? 
*** Those who make a bunch of transactions should pay for it. Bye, bye automated trading, short-term currency speculation, and microtransactions.
** Exponentially scaling, progressive, marginal tax on sum of total transactions from an account over time periods
*** Anti-trust built-in; it doesn't pay to get too big for your britches
*** No nickel and dime hacks
*** Forced large gift taxation
**** Decentralized giving will be more price-efficient than centralized
*** The wealthy and corporations will unavoidably have to pay their fair share of taxes to some extent
** Radically alters supply chains and contracting
*** Centralizes them under one roof
** Pigovian transaction taxes 

* Holdings
** Progressive, marginal tax on holdings in an account over time periods
*** This is an incentive to decentralize
*** Commodity and alternative currency sellers would not want to hold onto the digital fiat
**** Large enough purchases are going to require actual money, and they will be taxed by the commodities market who has to hold enough cash to purchase, right? 
** Pigovian holding taxes
** The velocity and demand for money are both taxed, pitted between transaction and holding costs. This gives us a knob to control them a bit. Money is a hot potato, but you have to get rid of it efficiently; the Fed can have influence on this process.


!! Taxing Real Estate

* Georgian Free Market taxation
** Prevent monopolies, pay the fitting value
** Efficient distribution of land
** Can be strictly tied to the digital currency.
** Real Estate accounts for over half of wealth today.


!! Taxing Other Capital

* ???


!! Taxing Unmet Obligations and Externalities

* Additional pigovian taxation
** Legal liabilities should cost a fuckton.
* Severance taxation on non-renewable, pivovian on renewable.
* Progressive scutage taxation for failing to fulfill citizenship obligations
** Alternatively, a minimal Corv√©e tax


!! Patterned Redistribution

* Pigovian externality repayment
* Progressive monthly redistribution of taxed money to individuals based on total money and capital assets.
** It's more than UBI. This is closer to comeback mechanics in LoL. It's anti-snowball. It's about forcing decentralization again and again.


!! Anti-Corruption

* Campaign Finance Reform from tax proceeds
* Able to trace money and voting systems to some extent.
** ?? Maybe not

!! Junk


I hate this concession as much as I despise Nozick. It might be a middle way for abstraction necessary for decentralizing the ownerships of complex means of production. This isn't new at all, but I don't recall the name.

What about a decay on cash and capital? Remove the exponential snowballing and centralization while maintaining markets capable of complex ownership of huge objects. Perhaps the poorest receive the greatest portion of the redistribution of the decayed returns to the pool. Monthly.

This is taxing capital of publicly traded companies, which means it will privatize ownership. Everything will have to be made public. Over half of all wealth is in real estate. Fucking radical markets book is still infecting me.

How do we prevent people from hiding wealth necessary for taxation? Classic problem. I have no idea how to eliminate dark capital and black markets. Privacy differentials only go so far.

Digital fiat makes sense to me. Cut out private banking and finance as much as possible. They are the most effective middlemen in history. This is how to do monetary policy well, especially by not handing out the freebies to the top so it "trickles." 

Taxation on transaction costs and holdings would be unavoidable in many cases, especially if the purchases must be state-sanctioned through the digital fiat currency. Nobody wants to hold onto cash with that kind of built-in inflation. Easy to redistribute, including UBI. You want money to be a hot potato to some extent.

One of the goals is to radically simplify taxes to make it seamless for average people (fuck off Turbotax) and unavoidable for the wealthy through loopholes and shells. Another goal is to be able to reverse payment, identity theft, etc.

KanuKISS?


Eliminate tax resistance, evasion, avoidance, protestation, and havens. How do you build a taxation system in which complex financial instruments and loop holes can't answer? We have to tax wealth, including hidden wealth. Being wealthy is practically a sin, and it needs to be taxed. ;P This is hard to do.
