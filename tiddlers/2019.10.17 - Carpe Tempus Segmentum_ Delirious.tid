title: 2019.10.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Delirious

* Woke at 8
** Noooooope.
* Read
* Cracked whips
* Read+Write
* Nobody wanted to shop with me: just school work. 
** <3
** Still, they need to practice shopping with me. Lasers, offspring, LAZRS!
** $230 today. Cheapest in town, but prices are still going up. Kids are larger too.
* I took a fucking nap straight from heaven.
** Delirious. {[[Dream]]}s were unstoppable. I woke up refreshed, though it took me a while to wake.
* Walked with my wife. Gawgeous.
* Talked with [[Levi]].
** Hope we get together. I will then have two neighboring households that are neighborly, right? Not just unidirectionally where I listen (and I'm lucky to listen), but friends with each other. 
*** Wat. Impossible. This is America. 
**** Fucking shame that we may be moving in that regard. I'm fucked with the yuppies: with one exception, the Yaleholes I've met don't get along with me (but, they like having me in class). Doesn't matter if I have a place. It's wildly the best option for my offspring.
* Pizza, Beer
* //Love Island// with my wife. She too appreciates what matters about it. 
* Read+Write
* Walk and talk with self
* Read+Write
* OMG, how the fuck did it turn to 5AM? 
** Shit.
