WED 8:09 AM
How do you predict your day will go?
WED 8:09 AM
Did you effectively assassinate the arduity of yesterday?
WED 8:10 AM
Nope! It was a terrible day. :joy:
WED 8:22 AM
/cry
WED 8:22 AM
I'm sorry =(
WED 8:23 AM
What made it terrible?
WED 8:23 AM
It was a long and physical day at work and time was at a crawl.
WED 8:24 AM
It happens. Weâ€™re about to do more renovations.
WED 8:25 AM
Aye. I hate the crawl when it is most painful.
WED 8:28 AM
Time appears to move by slowest when it takes more energy reason about what we are observing and interacting.
WED 8:30 AM
Some kinds of novel experiences can slow time down, but in a good way.
WED 8:31 AM
Often, when I'm just happy and chillin, it takes little energy to be there, in the zone (ready-to-hand). My brain is able to make accurate enough predictions about what's occuring, and so the phenomenology of it passes by quickly.
WED 8:32 AM
Boredom, on the other hand, sometimes feels like there's something wrong because nothing appears to push my chemical buttons well enough.
WED 8:33 AM
Unsolved, I think that makes a kind of feedback loop too, where pouring more brain power into trying to solve my boredom will not only slow down the experience of time for me further, but perhaps even increase the amount of brain power I will try to use to solve it, and so on.
WED 8:35 AM
Well said. Hahaha
