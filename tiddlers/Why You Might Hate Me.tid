title: Why You Might Hate Me

//Yes, I am forced to often seek the salience in the zoo of myself, blindly desensitized to my own odor. Yes, I am salty about the world, but that's what [[The Salience]] does. I'm convinced given enough time, most people grow to dislike me enough to dislove me. My honesty, even when articulated kindly, is often socially unacceptable. Everyone believes they are the hero of their own self-authored story. Everyone believes they are right because it's impractical (and sometimes too selfless) to act on the supposition they are not. I do not hope to cast pearls before swine, especially not to the pig inside my humanity. Only wisdom can define wisdom; and I am not wise in the totalitizing dialectic. I [[h0p3]] not to be a hypocrite. Do you have a charitable beef with me? Must we wrestle? Perhaps you are trying to kindly call me out on my bullshit (of which there is plenty!). Are you ready to wander the vindicating rabbithole with me?//
