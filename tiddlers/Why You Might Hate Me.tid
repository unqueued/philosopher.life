title: Why You Might Hate Me

//In time, most people grow to dislike me. My honesty, even when articulated kindly, is often socially unacceptable. Everyone believes they are the hero of their own story. Everyone believes they are right because it's impractical (and sometimes too selfless) to act on the supposition they are not. I do not hope to cast pearls before swine.//

I always hear "punch me in the face" when you're talking, but it's usually subtext.

Just a few of the excellent reasons to dance on my grave:

# I'm legitimately a dick.
# I'm forcefully denying the objective validity of your subjective perceptions of reality. I'm rejecting a non-trivial part of who you are by refusing to play along in what I take to be the crucially unjustified aspects in your particular language game. Unfortunately, interacting with me requires defending yourself, your version of reality, in a dialectic with me because I'm not convinced: (1) your identity or view of reality is nearly as meaningful as you seem to think and/or (2) you are justified in your belief/desire/action. You have a right to improve your model, but that doesn't give you the right to maintain your model otherwise. I charge you with lacking the integrity to sufficiently question the nature of your beliefs and your reality.
#* Do I send the sanctuary of your ignorance crashing down around you? Do you hate me just for considering that possibility?
#* You despise that I do not respect the non-rationally necessary parts of your identity (which I believe I can rationally demonstrate to you) except insofar as it is necessary for your rationality.
# You self-defensively disagree with me to the point of violent existential disgust.
# You dismiss me as a smarmy, unbearable, arrogant, hypocritical, petulant, delusional, insane, and/or dark-triadic edgelord.
# I'm not a member of your ingroup; I'm outside your neurotribe, political party, clique, the people who make you feel the good about yourself via immediate gratification (which is not the same thing as empathizing with your [[4DID]] or humanity), etc.
