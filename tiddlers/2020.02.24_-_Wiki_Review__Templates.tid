title: 2020.02.24 - Wiki Review: Templates

* [[/b/.tmpl]]
** Just to have an outlet. I don't want to lose what I'm holding in memory if I can't find a place.
* [[monthly.tmpl]]
** Good luck, kid. 
* [[2020.02.23 - Prompted Introspection: Field Trip]]
** Edited. Well, at least we're getting close to the end of the list.
* [[2020.02.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Shabbat]]
** I am happy to see things lighting up for my offspring. 
* [[2020.02.23 - Wiki Review: Over Half]]
** Achually, recall that time appeared to pass slower in the earlier half, so it isn't as true in some respects.
* [[2020.02.23 - TDL: Favela]]
** I'm loving being a quasi-student of my wife's with my offspring. I get to masquerade, goof off, and point the direction. I'm a retarded plant.
* [[daily.tmpl]]
** I like your daily template, homie. That is quite an opportunity.
* [[Maps: More]]
** Hide stuff away I'm not convinced by.
* [[.tmpl]]
** It's an experiment. I have no idea if it will help enough. I need my offspring to be able to model like this, to see the more static parts of their timeslices. I don't know if this will work, but we've gotta keep trying.
* [[weekly.tmpl]]
** I need to flesh out the links.
