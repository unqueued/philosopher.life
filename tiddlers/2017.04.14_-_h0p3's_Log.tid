!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

I'm spending more time sleeping on the couch. It's the only place I can sleep. I should go back to the more standard routine. Healthwise, I heard my first direct auditory hallucination today with an abnormally large hit. I've had augmented music so many times, but never anything so direct. I've yet to hear something that wasn't actually there (or, rather not beyond the usual spectrum of how ears and our brains fill in the gaps of soundwaves and do pattern matching, although I'm likely experiencing a variant of that). What did I hear? My phone was ringing while I was cooking, or I thought so. It was the sound of vegetables cooking a pan that triggered it. The sound literally emanated from it. I think I was mishearing the sound of the cooking and translating it into hearing my phone ring. It was quite weird. 

Also, I've been feeling more anxious and depressed in the past few weeks. I can see the spiral. 


!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

It was a bit shocking, like the first time I saw a visual hallucination. I quickly understood what was happening though. 


!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technologic, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

Altering perception can feel traumatic. It doesn't have to.


!! What are you going to do about what happened?

Monitor it. Pay attention to it. Give more thought to it.

I will be giving up cannabliss for 2 weeks anyways, per my usual 2-month-on-2-week-off cycle. DCK meditation on Sundays will keep you in order.
