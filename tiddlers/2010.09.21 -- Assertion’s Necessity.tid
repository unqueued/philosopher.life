title: 2010.09.21 -- Assertion’s Necessity

Brandom interprets Heidegger’s Being and Time to demonstrate elements of his notion of pragmatic expressive inferentialism. The use of assertions is an important aspect of Brandom’s interpretation of the Heideggarian social ontological world.

We are primed with vital definitions concerning Heidegger’s distinction between ‘vulgar’ and ‘fundamental’ ontology. There are two ontological categories. Zuhandensein (readiness-to-hand) is the subjective, human value imbued on the world. It is the world of equipment, in which a thing’s significance is derived from its practical role and use. Vorhandensein (presence-at-hand) is the objective, independent world and the domain of science. We might understand vorhandensein to be the vulgar ontology which is the “cataloguing of the furniture of the universe.”1 An essential claim is that zuhandensein has ontological priority over vorhandensein, which is something along the lines of saying that the social, subjective values we imbue on the world have primacy to the objective, independent values.2 This ontological view revolves around social and practical consciousness.

Crucial to the discussion of ontology is how it is for ontological categories “to be” in the first place. We might ask how categories classify or draw boundaries over themselves. Categories are about identity and individuation, but we don’t know how they apply to themselves. This is a problem of self-adjudication in ontology.3 It is this discussion which is called fundamental ontology. Dasein is the being which exists in the domain of fundamental ontology, being “self-adjudicating, anthropological” in nature.4 We, of course, have great difficulty in even understanding fundamental ‘Being’ because it precedes and adjudicates us as ‘beings’. Brandom says:

The ontological primacy of the social can be justified by appeal to a more specific thesis, pragmatism concerning authority. This is the claim that all matters of authority or privilege, in particular epistemic authority, are matters of social practice, and not objective matters of fact.5

The social nature of ontology defines knowledge and meaning. Significance is derived from a thing’s practical and social roles. Properties, as pursued by epistemology, might be things true before humans attach significance (the realm of science), but they lack the significance of the practical, agent-useful and social aspects of zuhandensein. Social recognition of a thing’s appropriateness or inappropriateness for practical use is what classifies it. Brandom continues:

Social object types are then instituted by social practical types of the performances in which they are appropriately used or produced.6

Practical, social object types are extremely relevant to Brandom’s interpretation of Heidegger’s ontology. The critical social object type is assertion. Brandom says:

[Assertion is] the category of the present-at-hand [which] consists of ready-to-hand things which are appropriately responded to by a certain kind of performance.7

Asserting and the practices of giving and asking for reasons which make it possible are themselves a special sort of practical activity…[which] puts us in a position to understand the category of the present-at-hand.8

Brandom thinks practical and social activity of assertions are necessary for us to understand vorhandensein.
