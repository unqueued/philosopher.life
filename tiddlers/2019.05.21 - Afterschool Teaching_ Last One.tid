title: 2019.05.21 - Afterschool Teaching: Last One

Everyone is late, but the prep was fast. 

The last day is barren. The school stays open to receive funds, and this isn't even the last day. Nobody shows up unless they just want to hang out with friends. I have 7 students today!

Delp took multiple copies of my information. It's interesting to see that teachers may have to undergo repeated background checks. 

Whitney has her ACT test in two weeks. She hasn't studied, and she made 15 then 19. She needs a 21. I'm picking out test prep sites and pirated books for her. I'm asking her to study 6-8 hours a day. She needs it, and if she doesn't get the score she needs, she just doesn't move on.

The janitors and I talked. They are getting squeezed on supplies and time. The paperwork doesnt match the reality here either. These men serve these children.

We jammed to music. I am clearly out of the loop, but what's new? I've never been in it, I suppose. I'm glad they still like my music. It was a serene lab even for my standard problem children whom I love.

The Janitor and I talked until it was time to go.
