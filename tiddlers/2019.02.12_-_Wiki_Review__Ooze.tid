* [[The Strange Bird]]
** I have more to say about the fact that I have so little to say about this book than what I actually directly said about the book.
*** Fix it.
* [[2019.02.11 - Music Exploration: KGP]]
** Dun.
* [[2019.02.11 - Link Log: Roaring Regurgitation]]

* [[2019.02.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Flying Pigs]]
** Completed.
* [[2019.02.11 - TDL: Madcap Mudkips]]
** So ready for the pizza! =)
** I'm already making progress. These TDL's feel like they are about tomorrow and I'm "sneaking" in work-ahead on the day-of. Will I be able to continue my momentum? I'm loving what I'm doing here. What the hell am I doing here? It's somehow super cereal.
