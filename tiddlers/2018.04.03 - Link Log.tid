**** The Globalists vs Nativists is very odd. Why should we agree? What happened to the Intellectual Elite who are also not wealthy? Are they smothered out? This move he doesn't seem to have great support for.
**** He's correct that it isn't simply rich vs poor, but that is obvious. Why does he think this will shift? It needs to, and we are definitely already in the crisis.

*** I actually think its crucial that lay people understand machine learning as much as possible in order to make informed decisions. I do not think political consent is possible without it. I highly respect this call, but as the article points out, this is not a simple discipline to successfully implement. All the more worry, in my mind.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://psychologycompass.com/blog/overcoming-learned-helplessness/
*** And, yet, there are some people who truly are helpless. This reads like pseudo-science to me. =/ I think there's something right about the fact that optimism and hope are necessary, and it's clear that shaping our perceptions is absolutely crucial to changing who we are, our habits, etc. Unfortunately, they do not turn a critical (pessimistic) eye to their own work. That's intellectually dishonest. I'm deeply annoyed by this, as I think the stoics are sometimes correct in pointing out that in order to preserve our sanity we must separate that which we don't have control over from what we do. I can see you want to give us prudentially-justified goggles, but that doesn't make them alethically justified (nor am I convinced you are effectively prudential either). This is not merely some mind-over-matter problem.

** http://therealnews.com/t2/story:21466:Trade-War-Greatly-Exaggerated
*** If it were too big, those in power would fight Trump much harder on it. Clearly, this is distraction. I'm not paying enough attention. I know this too. I should at least. This is classic xenophobic capitalism.

*** Always had my doubts, but assumed there were elements that may be applicable in select contexts.

* Think About It
** https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/
*** I wonder what he'd think about my work. I definitely have paranoid tendencies, but I'd argue they've been well-earned (which I'm sure he is expecting). That said, he's targeting another group. I clearly have the tenacity and hedgeability of conservatives; I suggest that my fMRI even looks conservative. I think it's part of the reason SDO tests are extremely conflicted for me.
** http://nautil.us/issue/58/self/the-surprising-relativism-of-the-brains-gps
*** My male donor has a ridiculously strong positioning system in his mind. It's absurd. I always joked he had 200 Tracking skill; should have been a ranger.

*** Some excellent points in here. I'm not sure they've given a satisfactory answer.
** https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism
*** Yikes. The truth will be persecuted in many contexts.
** https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/4/2/the-death-of-the-newsfeed
*** Seems obviously wrong. I think you've pigeon-holed what counts as a newsfeed. What if I told you that computers are feeds (or at least, that's a necessary part, even if it isn't sufficient)? We clearly seek salience (which you do realize).
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16721690
*** This is insanity. HN is a form of RSS, and Reddit's founders helped invent the fucking protocol. Look, RSS isn't curated enough. Even if you Regex and create your own search, even if are vigilant, it just isn't curated enough. It doesn't have the signal to noise ratio you are looking for, and it lacks the commentary that you need to develop a rounded perspective of things. Why do you think I'm on HN and Reddit? You can't escape the need for it, and I'm kind of shocked that people don't get it. Look, I still use RSS feeds, but I strongly prefer more curation than that.
** http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/01/the-hour-i-first-believed/
*** April Fools, I realize.
*** This is odd. I happen to think the ability to simulate another's mind completely requires being the superior mind in the dialectic. Perfect theories of mind cannot be simulated unless you host them as VMs. Lossless compression doesn't change this, and lossy doesn't give you determinism. At best, you only have heuristics (which is extremely Rawlsian: Hello, Reflective Equilibrium).
*** The Rawlsian point is interesting. Reducing morality to acausal trading is odd. I'm not sure if it is right or wrong, so that is very interesting.
** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16721364
*** The Hardly Quiet comments are odd.

*** You aren't pessimistic enough. This kind of ignorance is malicious.
** https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/be-skeptical-of-anyone-who-tells-you-they-know-how-democrats-can-win-in-november/
*** It seems pretty obvious to me, and mind you, I predicted Trump winning 7 months in advance of the election. It's very clear to the Leftist that the DNC could win with even mildly Leftist candidates (Social Democrats) instead of Neo-liberals, but they aren't going that direction because of those in power who have hollowed out the party (if it wasn't always hollow; I'm being generous). I do know how they can win, but it wouldn't "be them" anymore, now would it? The moment they move the overton window away from the false compromises of neoliberalism/progressive ideologies, we aren't even stepping in the same river twice.
