title: 2018.10.16 - Prompted Introspection: A Secret

!! What is a secret about you?

It is a fact about me which is not known, seen, or not meant to be known or seen by others.<<ref "p">>

Alright, you want me to provide a secret that hasn't been revealed on this wiki. Huh. I go out of my way to reveal as many secrets as I can. Some kinds of information, like a password, can't be just handed out. So, I don't speak extensively about my sexual preferences, though I should. I try to say all the crazy stuff that people keep or even hide from themselves. I speak of my intrusive thoughts, my failures, and my shame fairly consistently. I speak of my anger, hatred, and profound disdain that most people hold back. 

Perhaps secrets are things which I don't uncover as clearly as I could. Secrets steganographically come in [[dok]], right?

I suppose I could make one up right now on the spot too. But, that is also not the point of this exercise. The point is to open myself up, particularly to myself. Put a name to what I fear most, make myself vulnerable, etc. 

My stress rash is back on my right arm in the "elbow pit" or whatever it's actually called. I'm using coconut oil to try to solve it.
