* Disconfirm My Bias

*** This has several points in disagreement with my understanding. Perhaps the Positive Disintegration problem is the important divide. There are sociopaths successful at making good first impressions, but others not so. I'm also not impressed by the Dark Triad tests I've seen, and I wonder if people really know what it means. Dark Triadicism has to be measured against an external standard which I'm not so convinced psychology is in a position to have. That is to say, measuring what others think about others has all the flaws of subjective idealism.

*** I'll continue to watch Macron. I didn't like him before the election, and I'm not too surprised so far by who he has shown himself to be. It is important, none-the-less.

*** You need to read the essentials. It will be invaluable to you to see how different internet communities are organized, their conventions, their law enforcement, their power struggles, their owners, their biases, their natures, etc.

*** Given the group you led at Berea, I think this might be of interest to you.
