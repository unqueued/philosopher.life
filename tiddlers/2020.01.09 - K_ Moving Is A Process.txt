Gotta move the stuff into the house, but I feel pretty awful today. This cold is kicking my butt.

Keep drinking water and take plenty of breaks. The most important things are stuff that do badly in the cold.

Moving is a process hahaha

No doubt. Doing what I can to just get sleep where I can.

As long as [[k0sh3k]] doesn't get sick, we'll be okay.

I'm grateful that my offspring are filling in the gaps for me in my absence. I don't get sick too often, but when I do, I'm borderline useless.

How's your day going?
Jan 9 12:53pm
Not too bad. Tomorrow is allergy testing. Am nervous haha

I'm not a fan of needles. Is this the one with a bunch of tiny little needles in a panel?
Jan 9 12:59pm
That sounds right. I’m not totally sure.

It’s going to be on my back.
