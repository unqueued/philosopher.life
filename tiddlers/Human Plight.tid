title: Human Plight

I expand on this term borrowed from Christine Korsgaard. She may be deeply right.

It is not easy to see how our agency exists. The coherentists and constructivists who define agency in terms of constitution, psychic unity, and self-integration seem completely unable to call morally wrong things, people, choices, actions, maxims actually morally wrong. There is only good action. My truism that we all [[do the best we can with what we have]], in conjunction with this neo-Kantian, neo-Aristotelian view of agency, results in the fact that we only do good. Insofar as we are good, do right, we are agents. Otherwise, we are not.

Do I need to be able to hold someone morally responsible for doing evil? It seems necessary to have the yang to the yin in this moral equation. Perhaps not. Maybe noone is blameworthy. If so, do I even really care about freedom? I don't think so. All I care about is being constituted in a way that makes me happy. Presumably, being "morally virtuous" (even if morality doesn't obtain) is something that would constitute me and make me happy in many ways.

[[RPIN]]: Ah, friend. It is obvious that moral people are not happy people. Don't you see? You can either be moral, or you can be happy in this life. You are, essentially, Hursthousianly marred at the very least. It seems perfectly obvious that bad people are some of the most integrated as well. What say you now to your psychic unity? You yourself, [[KIN]], know it. See your previous work in [[Summa Theologica]].

[[KIN]]: To be clear, we are deep into constructivist territory here. We've already begged the question that our view doesn't spiral into moral relativism. We create our own value. It's standard looking existentialism. Once you beg that first question, are we really going to be unwilling to beg a lesser question such as the non-existence of rationally justified, objectively true blame? You've already thrown out the baby, does the bathwater really matter?
