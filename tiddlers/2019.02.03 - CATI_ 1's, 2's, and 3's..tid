One thing, [[The Good]] has priority over all else. It is objective. It is the axiom of [[Itself]]. It is [[The Infinite]] unified context of all contexts. It is the greatest commandment because it necessarily is and ought. It is the alpha and omega flatness from which difference arises. In fact, that is what Rawls' Difference Principle is about: diminishing marginal utility equations of calculating [[The Good]] after we have agreed to [[The Right]]. The [[CI]], [[The Golden Rule]] is embedded in Principle of Equal Liberty. It is lexically ordered interestingly. It is the second greatest commandment which through trascendental deduction necessitates the second. There is no [[The Right]] if there is no [[The Good]]. Contingency rests upon necessity, necessarily. [[The Good]] appears to be [[FO]] content over which we are [[SO]] Rational about, even if the [[FO]] must give rise (recursively, in binary dialectics) to the emergent [[The Right]] which is contextualized.
