title: 2019.05.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Library

* Woke at 7:30
** Ugh. Welp, I'm awake.
* Med
* Saw my family off to the library
* Read+Write
* Continue to work on the door. It's looking much better.
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Spent time with a lady at the IRS. She is pushing paperwork through (or so she says). It appears there is a hold from 2016, and they'll be taking $800 off the $7k, but that is taking forever. She also advised me to continue bugging them. That is good news in my book.
* Walked with wife
* Minor shopping
** I have sandals again! Yay! These appear sturdy, fit snug, my preferred single-strap. They feel good with socks too; I am, ofc, Polish.
*** My love, my toes are red already. =)
* Went to the party
** Something felt off about this one. My wife thought so too. We've been to David's party several times at this point. Librarians are already fairly odd yet vanilla people, but I'm still a fucking lunatic compared to them. I'm grasping for anything meaningful to speak about with these people. 
*** I think my wife is beginning her standard cycle. Perhaps we will move in a year or two. Normally it's every 2-4 years. We are nomads in the desert, forever the aliens. Her work is excellent, satisfying, moral, and profoundly valuable. She's the fucking workhorse master of that library; they've all said they would be dead without her (and it's true: they also exploit her). The school is also absurdly immoral. We've been horrified each passing year to realize what it is. She's begun to agree with me about each of her co-workers too. It sucks.
**** She's been feeling off on church too. She is an excellent teacher, and she has had to triage her time. I think certification, the interim priest, and her students have changed her opinions in some respects as well. 
* BB and other shows.
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by midnight?
