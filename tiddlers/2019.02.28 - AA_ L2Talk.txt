How goes it?
THU 12:06 PM
It goes pretty well —after yesterday’s grading fest (during the inservice) I am completely caught up except for the papers from today weeehooo!
THU 12:44 PM
Outstanding!
THU 12:44 PM
I actually got more from the talks because I could listen and do something—usually I am fighting to stay awake hehe
THU 12:45 PM
Finals are next week!
THU 12:45 PM
How is your day :blush:
THU 12:45 PM
That is fast!
THU 12:46 PM
My day is going well. Bought a used server for $350. I'm very excited to finally have enough RAM again.
THU 12:48 PM
Ooooo very nice

[[AG]] is funny. She has chatted a little with [[1uxb0x]] but was concerned that she wouldn’t know what to talk to you about
THU 1:25 PM
Lol.
THU 1:26 PM
Well, I'm going to try anyway. We'll find things to talk about.
THU 1:26 PM
I told her to answer your questions and ask some of her own ...like “how are you” hehe
THU 1:26 PM
It is good —thank you for helping her to learn and get to know you :blush:
THU 1:28 PM
Aye. It's excellent. I hope to gently make up for lost time. I should have been trying the entire time, lol. Life has been a whirlwind.
THU 1:29 PM
It goes by quickly

Especially as our predictive coding becomes more accurate and we spend less energy trying to reason about the world. It's why the phenomenological experience of time slows down in emergencies. Time, as it appears to consciousness, is the result of how much brain power we're using in the time slice. It's part of why time appears to be faster and faster as we age: there is less novelty.
THU 1:31 PM
:hushed:
THU 1:32 PM
Makes sense
THU 1:34 PM
I see less aging on myself but my kids age way too fast
THU 1:35 PM
Proportional differences?
THU 1:35 PM
[[L]] is supposed to be a boney little thing running around after her sister
THU 1:36 PM
lol!
THU 1:36 PM
Why is the world not as it is supposed to be? What happened?
THU 1:36 PM
Stop blinking.
THU 1:36 PM
And [[AG]] is supposed to be a sassy little red head running from her sister
THU 1:37 PM
Yep gotta enjoy the moments I am given and make new ones
