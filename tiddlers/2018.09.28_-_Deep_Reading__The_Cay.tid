title: 2018.09.28 - Deep Reading: The Cay

A book from my boyhood. What a powerful book to me! It floods back. I think this is right up there with //Hatchet// for me. Lots of detail and context I enjoy about the book today. The noble savage, black mystic thing is a worry. The coming of age and humanization of the characters is moving. I still find Phillip annoying, but that's the point; glad to see his growth, gratefulness, and maturity here. I am so excited for my son to read this book.

Blindness, of course, is the ancient symbolic curse. The love, respect, trust etc. screams out of the book. I submit. 'Tis an outrageous novella. It is uncommon for me to accept the happiness in books. I treasure the opportunity to experience it here. I am indebted to the author.
