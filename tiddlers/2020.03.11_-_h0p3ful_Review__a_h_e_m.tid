** There's definitely some crying in the corner.
** Wait, why isn't philosophy practical? 
*** We have huge sections of philosophy devoted to pragmatism, practical wisdom (Phronesis), applied ethics, and basically any intersection with any other topic is practical (given that we are about as theoretical as it gets).
** I agree that it can't "just be practical." You agree. Why is that?
** "Practical" is a word I often despise watching other people wield. 
*** It's also one that I still can't define well enough from a theoretical perspective.

*** Spending 30 minutes a day for several years will alter the course of your life here.
** I agree on the [[vidyas]] problem. We have to get back into the groove here, btw.
*** Do you have any subjects you want to learn? I think probability would probably be worthwhile.
*** For the record, your attention span is outstanding. 
** I like how the gallery will convince you that I am not awful. =)
** Your mother has her own shorthand too. It's important to be able to glance at it and know.
** Variations of the [[ROG]] are extremely common throughout literature (and, for a [[Straussian]], we never escape seeing it). Mind you, [[Saint Plato]] is one of the most quoted authors in human history. We are footnotes, madame.
** Bootcamps were a cool idea that didn't pan out. Unschooling might be the same? I hope you'll see the light.

** You are saying many words I don't know. =).
