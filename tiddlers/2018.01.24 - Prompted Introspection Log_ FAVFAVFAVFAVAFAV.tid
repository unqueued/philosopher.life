!! What is one of your favorites favorite sayings? Tell how they used it and when.

You need to lay off the sauce, kid. Frankly, Samwise, you make me question my sanity when I'm taking the time to even consider your meaningless question. It's like you didn't even try. Okay, we both probably have serious verbal deficiencies, and it's not fair for me to judge your semantics by your syntax. I know you have something important to ask. Alright, let's see:

Maybe you meant "favorite's favorite," at which point I'd need to think about what you mean by that generic "favorite's." Presumably, the kind of thing in question can have a favorite, a preference. The last sentence points to language user as well. Okay, let me just simplify this mess and say you meant to ask about my favorite saying and its history.

Presumably, I cannot choose my own words. In fact, a saying must have a certain following. There must be enough people actually saying it for it to be a "saying." I won't go down that rabbithole either for your sake (you poor bastard). 

I collect these issues in [[Antipleonasmic Catholicon]]. I cannot choose one, unless is it the [[Axioms of h0p3]]. These aren't the usual things we mean by saying, although they are aphorisms. [[Know Thyself]] is quite the commandment. So, there is my non-answer. Congratz!
