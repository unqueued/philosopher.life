title: 2020.04.04 - Wiki Review: Better Late Than Never

* [[2020.03.07 - Sphygmus: Diagramming]]
** I'm so grateful to have her reflect on homeschooling my offspring with me. There aren't many people who are able to see what she does.
** There aren't many people who ask for [[REDACT]]ions, and it's my honor to do so. I appreciate how hedged-conservative she is about it. She clearly appreciates the freespeech and privacy tension.
* [[2020.03.10 - Sphygmus: Villager Creator]]
** I'm feeling relieved for her. She has good options. 
** She's feeling anxious too.
* [[2020.03.13 - Sphygmus: AIR]]
** Dude, it would be so amazing to see her.
** There aren't many people who realize how awful it's been not to be with my brother [[AIR]]. 
** I don't have the opportunity to read her in the same way. It is what it is.
* [[2020.03.17 - Sphygmus: Donations]]
** Fuck yeah. I adore how [[Sphygmus]] actively seeks to help people who need it. 
*** I admire how she uses what privilege she has available not for herself. Not a lot of people in her position aim to be rational in this way. I usually find egoistic ratinalization and selfish confabulation.
* [[2020.03.25 - Sphygmus: Animal Crossing]]
** Animal Crossing has been a phenomenon. 
*** It would have drawn me more heavily before. I am not sure what has changed in me. Even [[Magic]] has not had the same hold on me.
** I take it that escaping is her best route right now. I hope she's doing okay.
*** I am not a pleasant man to speak with about the state of the world either.
* [[2020.03.27 - Sphygmus: ACNH]]
** I saw some other Animal Crossing related tooling, but my assumption is that she has tracked down everything that matters and works best.
* [[2020.03.22 - AIR: Dicksword]]
** Glad he's joined us. Haven't heard much from him. I'm happy to hear anything at all.
* [[2020.03.14 - BCS: Intro]]
** I'm glad I tried to reach out. He's growing something, but it feels pretty darn infected by capitalism. Hopefully, I'm wrong and he's being super practical.
* [[2020.03.15 - BCS: VC]]
** Unfortunately, it appears that VC is the price I have to pay. I'm just another crazy person to most. =)
* [[2020.03.19 - BCS: National Lockdown]]
** Interesting to see his work/vocation balance.
* [[2020.03.18 - dziggetai: Grandmother]]
** I have this in common with many people, except the giving a shit about my grand-anythings part. I'm happy he has someone he loves.
** Haven't seen him online much more either. 
* [[2020.03.13 - Tasha: Stores Are Chaotic]]
** I feel honored that she would install it again. I assume I'm the only person she speaks with over Signal.
* [[2020.03.16 - Tasha: Shit is Stressful]]
** My English is getting even worse. People are filling even more gaps than usual for me.
** I am glad they have an income wholly separate.
* [[2020.03.25 - Tasha: Barbie]]
** She speaks in pictures very effectively. It does all the talking. 
** It's interesting how little depth is achieved in our conversations over IM compared to being in person for a few hours (although, we usually still smalltalked more than anything).
* [[2020.03.28 - Tasha: Book & Virus]]
** That was kind of her. Never did find out what the book was. They don't seem the sort to care too much for books. Hopefully, it will be of use to them (internet is hard to beat, ofc).
* [[2020.03.10 - JRE: Prep]]
** My brother changes topics with me a lot. He has to herd his retard older brother, lol. I get it. 
* [[2020.03.13 - JRE: Lack of Sleep]]
** I don't have a lot of fun things to connect with my brother about. Shit's all serious these days.
*** He's trying with IASIP? I've not been a good chatmate about the show (despite watching it many times).
**** I don't know what got him over the hump into the show.
* [[2020.03.16 - JRE: Cute AF]]
** Yeah, I'm Charlie. Hell, I'm [[Charlie]]. I'm a special kind of idiot. A wildcard.
** I'm bad at picking out who other people are in stories. =/. 
*** Hell, I'm just bad with understanding characters.
* [[2020.03.18 - JRE: IASIP's Charlie]]
** I require my brother to tell me who I am sometimes. I appreciate it.
* [[2020.03.21 - JRE: Urgent Care]]
** That kid keeps gettin' sick. They are also hypervigilant (I'm hypervigilante). Rebecca is exceptionally sensitive and perceptive in many cases. She can be so pragmatic too; they make a damn good team sometimes.
** I hope his sleep schedule normalizes for him. I know that's hard.
* [[2020.03.22 - JRE: Lil Dicky DAVE]]
** My brother isn't going anywhere near that place, lol. I can appreciate his hesitation, resistance, and even disgust. 
* [[2020.03.23 - JRE: Crawling]]
** I wonder if this is also part of his stomach problem.
* [[2020.03.31 - JRE: Pillerflies]]
** Lol. That is an excellent joke. I think our wives are horrified by who we are.
*** I've had the opportunity to be this way longer with my wife. It's more normal for us.
* [[2020.03.11 - Sho: Spill On Laptop]]
** That must be super frustrating, especially if it is her only major computer (I despise using my phone for tech support).
* [[2020.04.03 - Sho: Ask k0sh3k]]
** I'm not good at predicting when she is interested in speaking with me.
* [[2020.04.03 - TDL: Catchup]]
** No shopping. But, we got most everything else done. 
*** Gonna wait until Monday.
* [[2020.04.03 - Wiki Review: <3 My Friends]]
** These are heavy work, and yet they are super important. I'm glad I do them.
* [[2020.04.03 - Prompted Introspection: Something Beautiful]]
** I think that one can grow. I hope so.
* [[2020.04.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Wealthy Are Just Waiting To Buy More Of The World]]
** I was obviously tired. I barely remember whatever happened. Fek.
* [[2020.04.03 - Ph03niX: Follow-up]]
** Nope. Guess not? Well, if he decides to change his mind, I'll be here.
