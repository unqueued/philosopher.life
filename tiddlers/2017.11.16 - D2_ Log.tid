title: 2017.11.16 - D2: Log

Completed Anya quest with Zon. You just slowly push through that zone, it doesn't matter what class you are playing. Worst quest in the game, but one of the best rewards in the game. Hilariously, it is the reward which is so useful for even doing the quest itself.

I immediately started Pindleskin + Eldritch runs. I usually give up on D2 at this point. Farming can be really boring. This is a skinnerbox though. That's the point. It's a gamble of my time for some digital nothings that send pleasure chemicals coursing through my brain. You could say it is a waste of time, but then I ask you: what is your time good for? Ultimately, dem pleasure chemicals, yo. That's really all there is. The good part is that it is affordable, ethically defensible, and logistically feasible in almost all contexts. It's hard to find drugs that do that. 

In any case, I've cleared my inventory out enough to do this:

# Enter Game
# Malah only if exceptionally useful
# Stash only if exceptionally useful
# Summon Valk
# Eldritch
# Deckard Cain
# Anya
## Sell
## Shop 
##* +3 Skill/+20% IAS Gloves
##* +2 Assassin, +3 Skill Claws for prebuffing or perfect traps, etc.
# Pindleskin
#* Leave on Immune Light or after looting
# Rinse and Repeat
