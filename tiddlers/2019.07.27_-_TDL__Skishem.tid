* Family Time!
* We'll shop. 
** My wife slept awfully, and she didn't want to shop (but wants to go with me).
*** Keep trying to get her to bed earlier. She wants to read, understandably. Her sanity is the rock of everything in our family though, and no sleep is a recipe for disaster.
* We have a lot of stuff in the freezer still, but our veggies are plumb out. 
** We'll figure it out. Maybe sushi?
* [[m16]] is going too slowly. It's time to grind. Don't wade through the molasses any longer than you must.
* Your daughter is drawing. I would like to have the chance to honor her work each week, if she wants. Find out how to do this well.
* Hey, you need to contact folks. Don't leave them hanging. Some people will take your pings even if they don't care what you say on your wiki. Do your part. Relationships must not fail on your account, sir.
