Figure things out in CT. Try to make unschooling work. Take my offspring to cool places, teach them how not to be a hermit like me.

No but hopefully he does soon I’d like to have children and be more permanent to work on himself though to At least that’s what he always says so hopefully he’ll do that and it’ll all work out
