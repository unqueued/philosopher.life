Your summer will be a new beginning, but for now, I assume it's a surreal ride.

What's suckin' the most about it?
MAY 7 8:25 PM
Yeah

Sucking the most —people that are angry about us closing and yelling at those of us losing our jobs...comforting those that are sad about us closing ...10 times a day :confused:

People are thoughtless

Oh and not enough to do..I am creative about coming up with things to do but it’s getting harder to do

I feel better now :blush: thank you !
MAY 7 9:16 PM
How’s your day?

That is intense.

I am not a people person (though I try), and it sounds a bit like a nightmare to me.

I'm sorry about the thoughtless ones.

My day has been solid. Teaching children and myself (*still basically a kid). Reading and writing my butt off (*still there).
MAY 7 9:22 PM
It’s ok as long as they don’t yell at my people...My tactic is to commiserate with them...it generally works
