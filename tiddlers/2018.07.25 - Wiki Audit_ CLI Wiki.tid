title: 2018.07.25 - Wiki Audit: CLI Wiki

I'm considering going something like this:

dotfiles -> Sanitizing Script -> NPM Tiddlywiki

I don't love doing it by hand. I don't actually modify my dotfiles often though. The setup could be important for a lot of things though. In the end, I may end up doing a significant portion of my editing in CLI rather than the browser (a souped up VM GUI terminal)
