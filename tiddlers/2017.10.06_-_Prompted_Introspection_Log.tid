//Making up for a failure.//

!! Why didn't you write your [[Prompted Introspection Log]] yesterday?

I certainly had the time to do it. I worked quite a bit yesterday, and I did get a lot accomplished. I spent a ton of time talking with people besides myself. Sometimes, other things come up: opportunities. That said I shouldn't have made the mistake. I could have finished this off last night. This is still part of the lifeblood of the wiki. Let us not fail today.

Note, I didn't make a [[To-Do-List Log]], which I actually did write previously, but I don't feel bad about it. I knew what I wanted to do with the day.
