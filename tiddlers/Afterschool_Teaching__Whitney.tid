title: Afterschool Teaching: Whitney

Dear Whitney,

I didn't know if I could say it in person, so I wrote a note for you. I've been going through my daily notes and memories of our work together; it's an emotional experience. In our brief time together, I've watched your struggles and growth through your transitions in life and college, and I [[hope]] you will continue to work hard and persist through life's many challenges. It's been fascinating watching you step up and take on more responsibility. I'd like to encourage to continue to pursue what matters most with our public children.

Enclosed, you will find a book and bookmark-card (trivial things, perhaps). I have searched what remains of my physical library for you. Sandel's //Justice// is practically a modern introductory classic in my field of inquiry. Every student of life should read a book like this one, and I want to make sure you've had to opportunity to wrestle with it. The problem it examines is fundamental to your vocation as a teacher, a high calling if I ever saw one. I hope it serves you well.

It's been my honor to work with you. You have no idea what it has meant to me, and I scarcely understand it myself. Thank you for putting up with me. I wish you the best.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
