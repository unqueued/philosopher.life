title: 2019.11.14 - Afterschool Teaching: Day of Tears

I brought all the books in today, cards tucked in the back of particulars. 

Carson and I talked. She has been very busy during the break getting her classwork done. Awkwardly, I asked to read her my letter since I never printed it. She cried. It was a moving moment. I was supposed to give her more time to compose herself and react in words, but, instead, I talked about the books with her. I hope she will excuse my autism.

I didn't get to complete my one-on-ones despite heading earlier. I started handing books out to individual students. I'm glad they all knew why I was giving them their particular book. Unfortunately, I have some that are missing. I'm glad I took the time to speak with my students Monday; I wouldn't have time to reach out effectively enough otherwise.

Before he left, I ran to Matt's room. I talked with him a bit and gave him his books as well. I hope his library grows out of control. 

I took my kids to Mr. Jones' room. Jones and I talked at length about a variety of topics. I rabbithole naturally with the man. He likes quant and standard geek stuff, so there's enough commonground for us to have something to say. He seems not to mind when I wander with him either, even on modal logic and coherence in fiction. The students joined us here and there.

The boys and I had conversations about respect, rule-following, appearances, and more. I adored when 6KA carefully argued on behalf of his friend for a plea-deal; he earned leniency for his friend simply in virtue of him being the one asking like he did (well done, sir! so much better than mutter-cussing me out). They were still crazy, as predicted. Many teachers said it was a second Monday.

The two best 6th graders girls spoke with me about homeschooling and college. That is what I want for you girls. They recognized immediately everything I had to say. My new and stunning student, 6KS, asked me to speak with her mother (whom I've heard a good deal about, and apparently, she's heard about me several times too). Carson and Whitney were waiting on me to take folks to the lab, so we went. 6KS said her mother couldn't come tonight, but she asked me to speak with her over the phone. This is highly irregular, inappropriate in the eyes of some, but it's my second to last day. I pay no price to do so.

I cried for half an hour on the phone with this woman, speaking with her in the hallway outside the lab. A teacher hid behind a wall and listened. Several students saw me crying. I saw 6KS hiding by her shadow on an adjacent wall. I hear her braced in her opening words, assuming I'm either talking down to her or getting her daughter's hopes up on something she can't afford (like I'm shaming or reminding her of her poverty). She thinks I'm judging her to be a failure because she got pregnant as a teenager, has no high school diploma, a single mom to three multiracial children (11, 9, and 6), she works construction at all hours (extremely rare for a female in these parts), and she has no life of her own. She raises Humans with so little. She doesn't even know half the injustices committed against her. You are right, woman, I am judging you. I'm garbage compared to you. No matter how hard I try, I'll never be half the person she is. What do I say to this angel? Like I have a right to say anything. All I can do is apologize, acknowledge, express my [[awe]], thank her. As is my duty, I walked her through who I thought she was, her position in the world, her offspring's disposition and options, recognizing what she has accomplished with what she has. She is sobbing on the other end, and so am I. 

She wants her GED, but she can't attend nightclasses. She makes sure her daughter has a laptop even though she can't afford Christmas presents, can barely pay the bills, and they don't have internet access until maybe January. We talked about the limitations of homeschooling (6KS could do it; I would trust very few children her age with such a task), and we walked through a gameplan for trying to get 6KS through college (which I think is doable). At first, she misunderstood me when I suggested a particular college that gives free tuition to all students who attend (I was quite unclear). There was a moment where she believed I was asking her to part with her 11yo daughter, she pauses and then wails at the thought, and when I realize why, the terror of the moment is overwhelming. My god, woman, now that is love. She is living proof of [[The Good]]. 

I have so little [[hope]] to give her. 6KS escaped before I could give her my card. I'm hoping she will call me, and we can find a way. 

My students interrogated me on why I was crying. I tried to explain. How does one describe the closest one gets to an angel? I don't know.

Delp called us to the gym (the teacher who hid was in the office with him). 8J and I talked at length. I told him how it was, holding nothing back. I hope he hears me.

I spoke with 6BG's mom about working at McDonald's. We talked shop.

I asked Carson to stay in touch if she wanted.
