I want a tree structure:

* http://treeview.tiddlyspot.com/
* http://listtree.tiddlyspot.com/

Also, want to be able to collapse it like the right side:

* http://tw5topleft.tiddlyspot.com/ 
* http://leftbar.tiddlyspot.com/

I also want to make it so collapsing doesn't change the center text at all.

---

* A menu
** Tree or other.
* 5-day streak topics
* A compilation of the top 10 recently edited links in the past 100 (or 1000) links which are not on the streak list.
* Start New Log, button?
