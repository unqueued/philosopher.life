title: 2019.04.02 - Wiki Audit: Accumulators

It's been interesting going through the [[Monthly Auditable]]s to see how [[/b/]] and [[Computer Musings]] really didn't need it. We're switching up some of the directories to "accumulate" from a specific date. When they get big enough, or if I decide to start using them often again, then I'll change back. This isn't the first time I've encountered it, but I'm not sure what else to do. I guess some logs should have their own timeframes.
