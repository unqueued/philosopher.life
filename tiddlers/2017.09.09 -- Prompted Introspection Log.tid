* Hyperclass:
** Those in direct power over the majority of humanity.
** The elite of the elite of the elite.
** The ruling class.

* Upperclass: 
** Those above the diminishing marginal utility for income line.
*** It is not clear that power has such a line, but money obviously does.

* Middleclass:
** Those between the DMU for income and the minimum functioning, healthy, basic cost of living requirements.

* Lowerclass: 
** Anyone who doesn't have enough to live a functional, healthy, life....i.e. doesn't meet the basic cost of living requirements.
** Note the difference between //Living// and //Survival//.
