Sometimes I get the urge to respond to a post on reddit. I think I have something valuable to contribute to the conversation often enough, but I'm not sure how to say in a way that isn't going to just be attacked or misunderstood. It's not worth my time, nor my emotional energy. For the past year, for the most part, I write out my response, but I never submit. I just close the tab. Lol. That's sad.

That is one weird part about this wiki. At the same time, I feel quite safe to say what I want to say, but I also see myself as attacking myself (in love, generally). It's the dialectic.

It is weird to be sorry and not sorry for something. It is obviously true that I am allergic to you. I wish it were not the case. I don't even want to say it to you. But, it's true.
