!! Insofar as it can be generalized, what is your favorite role, method, or strategy in gaming?

I prefer the control role. I like to choreograph everything to the last detail. I love having just the right combination of tools to imprison my opponent and expose their weaknesses. I like to troll and style on my opponent as they sit there helplessly dominated. The beginning may be rocky, but as I tighten my grip, my win becomes inevitable.  

I think the zerg mentality is the worst kind. Even as you add intelligence to the aggressive style, as you slip through the cracks in your combos, it doesn't feel as satisfying as control. Finding the path of least resistance is child's play compared to understanding how to build and maintain resistance and immunity.

I love the extremity of the pure control approach. You win in virtue of planning and out-thinking your opponent. Your actual win condition is often irrelevant because the control itself was what won it for you. Control requires appreciating the particularities and specialized details, footholds, and weaknesses in a metagame. Control is reactive in how it plays out, but it actually requires far more pre-game planning and understanding than all other approaches, as far as I can tell. Control requires appreciating the strategy and framework of the opponent. It makes for a fun game.

That said, when I play //life// as a video game I cannot do that to my "opponents." The only thing I really must control is myself. Translating the control role to playing life as a video game is difficult, particularly for someone interested in being good. I am not my own enemy, or I hope not to be.
