title: 2019.04.11 - Antipleonasm Analysis: War Criminals

!! Respond to the following gem:

If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged.

Went to find where this was from, and it was a fine argument. I can find people who will call one side or the other war criminals, but not many interested in calling them all war criminals (well, I'm actually not sure about Carter; I'm simply too ignorant, but I wouldn't be surprised). That isn't to say we can't have leaders who won't be war criminals. We've never really had much of a choice though. I throw a small party (an excuse to drink!) when politicians I despise die. I wish justice obtained.
