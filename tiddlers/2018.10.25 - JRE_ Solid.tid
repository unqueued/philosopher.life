My brother and I spoke for a solid chunk today. He was telling me his project manager had praised him and that the dude was a decent human. My bro double-parked (because the lot at work required it), and teased an apprentice, forcing the apprentice to listen to my brother's life problems before he'd unpark. He got a good reaction from the sounds of it.

We talked about [[AA]]'s letter. It's a touching letter, and we wrestled with a few points in it. He said he would be willing to go with me on Thanksgiving, but he also doesn't want to miss out what may be his last Thanksgiving with Rebecca. I will likely stay with [[L&K]] if I do have the chance to go.

Rececca's Brother-In-Law is an idiot. My brother revealed himself to this idiot in a series of comic exchanges. This did not make Rebecca happy. They both see themselves in slowest-motion breakup of all time. He said he doesn't feel trapped, like he's scared to be alone. He's motivated to stay with Rebecca simply because he loves her.

We talked about tits and buttholes for quite a while. This took us down many valuable paths (literally). 

I'm actually failing to remember everything we talked about (or I sense that I have).
