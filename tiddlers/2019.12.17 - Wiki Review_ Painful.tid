title: 2019.12.17 - Wiki Review: Painful

* [[Poem: Good Bones]]
** This is a painful poem. It's a fundamental problem I've been wrestling with for over a decade. There are some differences between me and the author.
*** I've nearly drowned my offspring in the deep awful pools. 
*** I tell them exactly how awful I think the world is and the nature of their circumstances. 
*** I parade my vices and mistakes constantly. We even record it. Honesty is so painful.
**** I even hand them hedonic addictions in media consumption on purpose to force them to practice. Digital crack to children.
*** I'm not trying to sell the world. And, I constantly tell them (at least once a week) that even if they do everything right (which is highly unlikely), it still might not (and maybe even probably not) work out. There is only so much which is up to them.

** It's so hard to resist the temptation of centralizing [[power]]. It has to be an ingrained habit and widely recognized social virtue (which, of course, is not my prediction).

** I think we're on target for +80% on Saturday. 
*** Thinking we may keep the couch in the living room until last minute though. I'd prefer to limit how much time we live on the floor. We'll see.

** One of them questions that's taking the entire wiki to answer in a sense.

** Completed. I'm thinking that Levi and his family still won't make it. 
*** It sounds pretty rocky over there for him too. Well, I'll give him my card and hope he'll stay in touch.

** The gap between the most literal interpretation and the intended is often crucial to explore.
