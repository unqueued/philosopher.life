title: 2019.06.05 - Prompted Introspection: Charity

!! If you were given a huge amount of money, but had to give it away, who would you give it to?

Thank you, Lady Melisandre. IIRC, Warren Buffett gives his own offspring $1 Billion to give to charity since that will give them all the connections they need (though I'm sure they receive far more than that). It depends on what counts as a huge amount of money, and you need to define "giving it away." Let's assume my family and I cannot benefit, and I can't give it to anyone I know. I'd setup a foundation for generating [[The Original Position]], [[Outopos]], [[AIoutopIA]], and a Rawlsian-Marxist thinktank.
