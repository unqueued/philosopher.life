I'm not a fan of nvidia, but I almost always buy nvidia. Resolution was all wrong, and it took a while to prove to myself it wasn't xorg but nvidia. Realized I wasn't using nvidia-lts, and I've got hooks for both now. Interesting to see power savings mode works on this arch install but not manjaro. I do not know why.

We can leave [[monster-10]] running, and I can begin just migrating over now. As long as I have a terminal, browser (with all my tabs), and can reach Bob from across the network, I should be in okay shape.

Pushing a fuckton of files over. There's over a million sitting in home alone (:P). I'm rock hard looking at 100mB/s throughput on the network. Well, hopefully, I'll have no reason to keep most of the millions of files.

Trying to sync firefox windows/tabs as a full session. None of the tools work correctly. Set up nomachine on both ends. Nested i3 is fucking hilarious. MySessions just werx.

dmenu, I'm leaving you. Goodbye. Rofi is the tits. Can't get Rofi to play nicely with terminator for SSH.

Still working on sound before almost everything else, lol.  ~~On one screen, but I'm more than happy to do that in i3.~~ After the 50th reset on i3, it magically has them both working. Looks clean enough, but will probably do more font work. plasma-pa is no go.
