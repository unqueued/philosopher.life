title: 2020.04.21 - Prompted Introspection: Shivved

!! Who would you most like to be like if you could change your personality?

`/sigh`, upon reflection, I've decided this is not as dumb a question I initially claimed, Samwise: [[2018.08.04 - Prompted Introspection: New Personality]]. Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. I'm glad you asked it. Thank you.

[[Saint Diogenesocrates]] is one of my answers, though the man is idealized beyond my ability to even put my finger on it. That's okay with me. Those are places in me I [[hope]] to grow, lenses I aim to wear, and methods for approaching some of the harder problems I've faced in both theoretical philosophy and its application, being a political animal. [[Straussian]] myths, the lot of them (as with any ancient figure), I admire that Saint Diogenes and [[Saint Plato]] didn't get along. I need that. From the [[KIN]], [[RPIN]], [[ehyeh]] approach, I still see [[Self-Dialectic]] as requiring internal opposition to reconstruct, and, ofc, [[gfwiwcgws]]? I suggest my personality-shaping may be positive, objectively (and subjectively for me), while still just appearing kooky, cranky, absurd, and worthy of laughter (and, indeed, we must learn to laugh to some [[dok]]) to lots of people. Yes, [[IA2DYJ]], but I also seek to learn how to be shivved gracefully and safely (in some sense).
