title: 2019.04.25 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Beneficiaries of War

!! Respond to the following gem:

A good way of finding out who won a war, who lost a war, and what the war was about, is to ask who's cheering and who's depressed after it's over - this can give you interesting answers. So, for example, if you ask that question about the Second World War, you find out that the winners were the Nazis, the German industrialists who had supported Hitler, the Italian Fascists and the war criminals that were sent off to South America - they were all cheering at the end of the war. The losers of the war were the anti-fascist resistance, who were crushed all over the world. Either they were massacred like in Greece or South Korea, or just crushed like in Italy and France. That's the winners and losers. That tells you partly what the war was about. Now let's take the Cold War: Who's cheering and who's depressed? Let's take the East first. The people who are cheering are the former Communist Party bureaucracy who are now the capitalist entrepreneurs, rich beyond their wildest dreams, linked to Western capital, as in the traditional Third World model, and the new Mafia. They won the Cold War. The people of East Europe obviously lost the Cold War; they did succeed in overthrowing Soviet tyranny, which is a gain, but beyond that they've lost - they're in miserable shape and declining further. If you move to the West, who won and who lost? Well, the investors in General Motors certainly won. They now have this new Third World open again to exploitation - and they can use it against their own working classes. On the other hand, the workers in GM certainly didn't win, they lost. They lost the Cold War, because now there's another way to exploit them and oppress them and they're suffering from it.

Who benefits from war? Some people clearly have much to gain from it, even those who appear to "lose." It's pretty clear to me the elite are working to shelter themselves from the catastrophe they've induced. They are probably going to succeed. I feel like an idiot for having so little to add or subtract from [[Saint Chomsky]]'s words. He [[right]]. 

War, of course, can be justified. I'm at war with capitalists and reactionaries right now, but I'm forced into guerilla tactics.

It drives me insane that most people favor and reason about war via nationalism, conservative tribalism that can't be justified, and identities that were corrupted or falsely constructed to begin with.
