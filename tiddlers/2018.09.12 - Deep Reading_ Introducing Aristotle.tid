title: 2018.09.12 - Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

Again, I spend my time dwelling on 1-2 pages. What a comic book! This thing just owns me sometimes.

Thank goodness, finally some light on Aristotle's Religion. I understand your desire not to say that word out loud, the aim to respect his attacks on sophistry, etc. If you are going to own his systematic view, then you need to just come out say it. He obviously believed in [[The Telos]]. I am amazed at how truly fit his memeplex has been. How could you not show this? He's so right that it makes me cry. I cannot destroy it without losing destroying everything. He's right!!! IT SCREAMS OUT OF THE PAGES!! ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION!? GOD DAMNIT PEOPLE! How do these people just "gloss" over it, like it's quaint? I drink that koolaid, and they don't.

Almost no discussion of the pinnacle of the metaphysics here. I don't understand why! It's literally the centerpiece of everything in his theory. It IS his fucking theory. You people disgust me! Confound it. 

I do appreciate the Russel quote though. It's handwaiving towards it, and I understand that's sometimes all we can do.

My first philosophy teacher divided ethics into: Teleology and Deontology. There is an elegance to it. Turns out, I think even Deontology is Teleological! "Humanity as ends in themselves"...They give the classic tripod distinction here. I'm fine with that. I'm glad it follows immediately after his religion. Aristotle's Ethics is profoundly teleological. Virtue of the practice is functional.
