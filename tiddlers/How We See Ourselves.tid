title: How We See Ourselves

Everybody thinks they are (epistemically) right. If they think there are limits to their knowledge, they think they are right about that limit (and the various implications of that limit). People trust themselves too much. It is easy to see how the beliefs and arguments of others are flawed, but we cannot see where we fail. 

Most people think they are the heroes in the stories of their own lives. Most people believe they've overcome real adversity, that they are the victims, that they generally behave according to what they (subjectively) see as what is morally right. Nobody thinks they could possibly be evil. People believe they are as they ought to be, but they are quick to see how others are not as they ought to be. People do not reflect over their own lives very much.

People are hypocrites. We are arrogant; we think we are better than we really are.
