I am calling in a favor, [[Jop]] (I want your personal opinion).

 I am considering reaching out to my donors. Not sure if I should, and I'm not sure how I should do it. I'd like your digested advice. Give me something to think on. Be prepared for me to wrestle with your claim, please. Take your time in formulating your thoughts, please.

 What kind of donors?
Mon 1:11 PM
 I used to have this concern too. I think I should do it if the program will benefit many  people, but try not to make it personal so the person who gets the message won't feel the pressure. For example I could do on a Facebook specific group for the donors only. I know you don't like Facebook. You could try others group message.

 my donors = my parents

 sorry, I should have made that clearer

 There is a leap there that isn't easy to see. Also, I appreciate your answer to a different question. =)
Mon 2:11 PM
 I don't know all the situation but I think your parents are great people. I think it's good for you talked to them humbly.
Mon 2:20 PM
 I ask you give it some thought.
Mon 2:21 PM
 I would be speaking with them through my wiki; it would be out in the open.
Mon 2:21 PM
 Their replies as well.
Mon 2:22 PM
 I did
Mon 2:23 PM
 Okay. Thank you. =)

 I don't have any fancy words but I confirm the same answer.
Mon 2:24 PM
 I'm fine with plain words too. I appreciate your honesty.
