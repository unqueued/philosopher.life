Fuck yo' rules. =) 

Heated up in microwave, applied long-term heat-pad, put in my pouch. When I got to the union center, I stuffed it into my snug underwear. I filled out a bunch of paper. The contractor was there, I found out later he is also a member of the union (I believe the "technical term" is "suck ass"). 

Only one other person from the pool of applicants for apprenticeship was there. Everyone else appeared to be in the union as an apprentice or journeyman. 

Jonathon walked us through our time cards.

We went to the hospital to take our drug test. I was the last person to be tested (sucks).

I'm glad I hid it in my underwear. I was required to empty my pockets. I "pissed" into the cup, and gave it to her. She said the test was having trouble and she needed another. For a moment, I thought I was dead in the water, but then I saw she had poured the contents into a new test. It worked (or so it appeared). She gave me my checkmark and I was done.  

From now on, I will only empty half into the cup. Just in case I have to try again, I'll have extra to squirt out. This gives me a small second chance, however, minimal. I'm keeping the bottle. 

I called JRE about it. He seems torn/worried that I'm using fake urine. I gotcha. I think he'd make the same choice standing in my shoes. 

I'm getting paid for 4 hours of work. I'm cool with that.

So much crafting...

Actually, I'm hoping my son will have the large closet ready for me to help him setup his tools and workshop.

[[Electricianship]] is something I need to dive into. It's time to build something beautiful.
