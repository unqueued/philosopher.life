"""
[6:49 PM]  h0p3: How was your day?
[8:27 PM]  Sohalia: Phone totally didn’t show me your response. I actually have all your wiki links saved and will poke through them periodically >_>
[8:27 PM]  Sohalia: Especially [[k0sh3k]]’s recipes <_<
[8:28 PM]  Sohalia: And my day wasn’t bad! Going to try this new game out that is basically a fitness RPG? We’ll see if I can convince myself to do it enough to get in shape lol
[8:28 PM]  Sohalia: Hbu?
[9:54 PM]  h0p3: Lots of talking today.
[9:55 PM]  h0p3: Super sad about finding out that what was wrong with the car is a $4k battery that would need to be replaced (feel lied to, as well, by the people who sold it to us).
[9:55 PM]  h0p3: It's been a really good day though.
[9:55 PM]  h0p3: What fitness RPG?
[9:56 PM]  Sohalia: It’s called Ring Fit
[9:56 PM]  Sohalia: It’s a “level up in this game and fight monsters by working out” type of thing
[9:56 PM]  h0p3: Watching vidyas now.
[9:56 PM]  h0p3: Keep the hikkis in shape.
[9:57 PM]  Sohalia: Hehehe
[9:57 PM]  Sohalia: Yikes about the battery :frowning: that seems absurdly expensive...
[9:57 PM]  h0p3: Can be done cheaper, still thinking about it.
[9:58 PM]  Sohalia: I’m sorry dude :/
[10:00 PM]  h0p3: Yeah. Disappointment, lol. I'm glad that we have room for error. That is not usually what I've had available. The car was $1.3k, and I'm grateful that it won't sink us, we can afford to eat it (lumps and all).
[10:00 PM]  h0p3: Offspring did well in school today, imho. I'm feeling optimistic (quick, take my temperature, I might be dying)
[10:01 PM]  h0p3: Short term*, small things, lol
[10:01 PM]  h0p3: You have a good time playing DnD last night?
[10:51 PM]  Sohalia: These are all good to hear! And yes, tons of fun
[10:52 PM]  Sohalia: My character almost suffocated after being buried alive. It was the first time I’ve been genuinely afraid to lose my character.
[12:49 AM]  h0p3: Have you ever lost a character?
[9:54 AM]  Sohalia: I have not actually
[9:54 AM]  Sohalia: I have come VERY close, but not actually ever lost one.
