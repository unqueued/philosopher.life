title: 2018.08.16 - Wiki Review: Number Doesn't Matter

* [[2018.08.15 - Computer Musings: Whonix]]
** It is pretty.

* [[2018.08.15 - Deep Reading: JASG]]
** Ugh, I got nothing done today on this.
* [[2018.08.15 - Self-Dialectic: The Grand Dialectic]]
** Renamed. This is a project.
* [[2018.08.15 - BAGD: Wikis]]
** I'm glad I have something to say. I need to transcribe.
* [[JASG: Chapter 1]]
** It's coming along, slowly
* [[2018.08.15 - AIR: Visit]]
** He bought the computer today!
* [[2018.08.15 - Wiki Audit: Finish]]
** But I really hate it now. =/
* [[2018.08.15 - Deep Reading: Introducing Alain Badiou]]
** At least I'm having reactions to it. That is better than nothing.
* [[2018.08.15 - Prompted Introspection: Non-Earth Habitat]]
** Still get muh interwebs.
* [[2018.08.15 - Wiki Review: Minimal]]
** I have to stop thinking of these as minimal. I really am still throwing myself into this wiki. I need to stop worrying about the notion that I'm not trying. I really am. It's obvious. Keep going!
* [[2018.08.15 - Carpe Diem: Computery]]
** Completed
* [[2018.08.16 - Daily TDL: Groceries]]
** Doing a decent job, thus far. This is a weird check btw...I love that the [[Wiki Review]] and [[TDL]] logs are intermingled way harder now.
