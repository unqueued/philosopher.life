Necessitations:
Logical necessitation
Causal necessitation
Rational necessitation
...

Human being ____ acting

Even choosing not to act is an action.
This notion of action can't be reduced to any of these three necessitations.

There is no logical contradiction when we say a 'human does not act'.
And so on for both causal and rational necessitiation.

It is our fate/destiny to act. 

Our action is necessitated. Sarkar calls it "metaphysical necessitation".

Norms - provide a normative compulsion. 

A person has, in his mind, a variety of desires and inclinations, but he also has reason. 

Duties and obligations only fit for humans. There isn't for God or angels (acc. to Sarkar). Duties and obligations only apply to individuals who are tempted away from the moral law. If there is no temptation, then there is no necessitation. For God and angels, there can be no necessitation (assuming angels are perfect).

Necessitation, as it occurs in Kant...

Groundwork, 4:414, 4:412.

Necessitation. Law commands certain actions - it is objectively necessary that "one ought to...". The perfect being whose will is infallibly rational, that would be a subjective necessity as well. He (God) would never dream of doing anything else. If the Will is subjective conditions which aren't in accord with objective ones, such as desires and inclinations over-riding our reason, then you have the concept of necessitation.

There is no imperitive for the Holy, Divine, solely rational Will. 

The whole idea of necessitation is important because what is at stake is self-constitution. 

When you do what is wrong, your 'self' becomes fragmented. A fragmented self cannot properly act. Changing the fragmented self into the self-constited is the change from an immoral person to a moral person, and a change from ingenuine action to genuine action. Without self-consistution, we cannot genuinely act.

Being evil is failing to have genuine action, which is failing to be a good (self-constituted) human.

-What is the source of normativity, the grounds of its authority? Is it possible that the psychological mechanism of necessitation which compels us is only part of what grounds the authority of normativity? Even if all humans died out today, wouldn't we want to say normativity still exists, it just so happens that no beings exist under which it is applicable?  



Jan 20

Hume, sentimentalists --Human standard of values

"spectator point of view"
If A is nice to B, and I am sympathetic to B, then I regard A's act as good.
Normative standards play no role in the actions of A, then they are naturally virtuous. Otherwise, there is self-hatred which forces the normative standards to play a role.

An act is virtuous if it is useful or pleasant to us or to others. The spectator approves (acc. Sarkar) because of this, but is not (acc. Kors). If Sarkar is right,t hen Sentimentalist is externalist, not internalist.

In order to be good, you don't necessarily need to be like the conditioned 'Good dog'. 

"third-person point of view"

She's claiming that normativity isn't a psychological force.


Dogmatic rationalists (Kant? might be included, controversial - Sarkar doesn't think inclusion)-- External, objective standard of values

Objective values (ethical) - every bit as objective as "my coat is brown"
The claim is that the invidiual who has reason has a 'module' to see clearly what those objective values are...and then they can act on that. 


How are we necessitated? The sentimentalist and dogmatic rationalists cannot answer.

Categorical Imperitive is a "synthetic a priori" proposition, like 2+3=5 (but not just A=A, as it is necessary, but not informative). If it is necessarily true, then it isn't made by the individual (subjective), thus it is objective truth/value. 

What principles generate self-constitution? Will it be relative and subjective or will it be objective?

Act and Action are different

Purpose is not normative (acc. Kant and Aristotle)

Maxim->CT function check (can it be universalized?)--> yes or no? - if yes, use the maxim.


Jan 25

Aristotle and Kant's view on what counts as the right act are structurally similar. 

Kant maintains that the form of the maxim is very important. If the form of the maxim can be universalized, then it is a morally acceptable maxim.

You find the same thing, acc. to Kors, in Aristotle. 

Action is a comprehensive description, both act and end. Aristotle argues for this, and she thinks Kant does as well.

form of maxim, the way in which the purpose/end relates to the act in an Action.

Kors is against moral facts (for Dogmatic Rationalists) but is not against maxim's being correct internal to it itself.
The correctness of the maxim is not dependent is not dependent on something outside the agent. Is morality subjective from this point of view? 

The objective law, for Kant (acc. Sarkar), is independent and it is the Categorical Imperitive (synethetic a priori). Kors has painted morality such that there isn't an objective law. The CI from Kant's perspective demonstrates that the objective law should have impact on the moral agent, which is opposed to Kors' view. 

Why subscribe to an objective law? Her criticism of the rationalists will come down on any objective truth she attempts to reach.

1.4.1 - For descartes there is an "I" could not exist unless it is "thinking" and vv. Kant thinks this idea was a mistake. The "I" does not need to exist, yet the individual will an important role. 

If there is no "I" separate from beliefs and desires, then it seems that 'action' is caused by the remainder, namely beliefs and desires.

There must be a self. Unification comes in degrees. Some selves will be more unified than others. There are degrees of action. The degree of unification correlates to the degree of a self which correlates to the degree of 'genuine' action. 

Aim is not to be good, but rather Unified. Goodness is a secondary effect of being unified. 

Not being unified is a choice, yes? Isn't every action based upon the choice to be unified? Can't you have someone who is unified in evil? Is she begging the question about what counts as unified? She removes the agency of evil people. 

Disunified people have things (desires) acting upon them which forces them to do acts that are evil.

1.4.2 - t0, there is you, t1, there is action from you  [She says this is mistaken]
At time t1, there is both you (whole self) that is action

One is making one's identity in ones Actions.

Practical identities are contingent. The contingent identities give us reasons to do things. We should have 'contingent identities' of necessity. We can have, adopt, or shed these.

You can have many contingent practical identities, and sometimes they will conflict. You have to unify them.

Our practical identities help us decide what actions we will choose and which ones we won't. Actions are expressions of practical identities. They give you more than reason for doing something, but also principles for determining what it is that you should.

What happens when my practical identities and principles they give me conflict? What happens when my moral principles conflicts with these practical identities?

If the maintainence of our practical identities is up to us? How should our practical identities be guided? Will she need objective laws to identify this guidance?

Read up to page 46




Jan 27

We all have varieties of practical identities. Our task is to unfiy these various practical identities, with dedication and integrity. Only then we can have reasons for our actions. Unless you have these practical identities, you won't have reasons. Actions are directed by reasons which are provided by your practical identities. 

The kinds of obligations and duties you have are 'up to you'. 

It seems as if (acc. Sark) every practical identities have objective duties bound to them. Whereas I can choose my contingent identity, it isn't up to me to choose my obligations and duties. But, this isn't Kors position.

It seems that Kors is saying that both contingent practical identities and the obligations are up to you. 

THis is probably the interpretation we want to have of her because she would be against the objective nature of the obligations and duties which might be part of the first interpretation, as this would conflict with her argument against the dogmatic rationalists.

In choosing our contingent practical identities, we are 'valuing' ourselves. There is no other way to value ourselves besides espousing the practical identities and following the obligations/duties. I choose to value myself as "X" identity.

if obligations/duties are objective, then it is too "third personal" - she must hold that the duties and obligations are "first-personal"

Problematically, not all "valuings" are alike. Are the values objective? If they are, then dogmatic rationalism problem, and if not, then it isn't very clear how one couldn't have a 'bad identity' which they also pursue with integrity and dedication.

If the individual who has the contingent practical identities is 'rational' but also has certain 'non-rational aspects' to them as human beings, then it seems that we need to be --COMMITTED-- to whatever 'rational principles' there are. Who knows what these 'non-rational principles' might entail...

You must be committed to your identities.

Once you adopted an identity, you must treat that identity as the 'source of absolute inviolable laws'. 

As a human, are there any duties from being human? Duties qua human? Stripping all other practical identities which are contingent, are there any 'necessary' practical identities, like being human? If so, it seems that these sorts of necessary practical identities are objective. You can de-commit yourself via suicide...perhaps. Even human identities seem contingent for Kors (pg 23.).

'Being a father' is not a fact about the fact that you've procreated, but more of a role. 

Kors thinks the 'dedications and integrity' clause is what prevents me from 'giving up my fatherhood' as an identity at whim. But, then it is not 'up to me' in some sense whether or not I can take up or drop off my practical identities.

"up to me" is an important phrase here. It is part of avoiding the dogmatic rationalists? 

Degrees of unification, agency, and action.

Moral principles go towards the constitution of your agency. 


Constitution of Agency - Ch. 1

REgarding Groundwork first:

Section 2 of Groundwork, there is a distinction between categorical imperative (3 imperatives are mentioned, but they all point to the same one, apparently) and hypothetical imperatives (note the plurality). 'If you want to be a lawyer, you need to do well on the LSAT' counts as a hypothetical because it doesn't apply to those who don't want to be lawyers.

In the hypothetical imperative: When you will an end, you automatically will the means which would produce that end. You don't have to will the end, so you don't have to will the means, necessarily.

As to categorical imperative, as an agent with reason, you can't choose the end.

Whereas everyone applauds the hypothetical imperative, Kors thinks the hypothetical imperative must be questioned. She thinks you can't have the hypothetical imperative unless it is underwritten by the categorical imperative.

There is only one principle of practical reason, to Kors, the categorical imperative (end of the Ch. 1, pg 68).


Kors argues that Hume cannot be for the hypoethcal imperatives (and then she will argue against the dogmatic rationalists).

Instrumental Reason - 

Even the principle of prudence requires a foundation, despite the fact that many people assume it doesn't. 

If X is a practical reason, it must 1) motivate you, and 2) it must serve as a guide. If it can motivate, but doesn't guide (as in empiricism) -or- If it can guide, but can't motivate (as in rationalism), then it fails to be a practical reason. She thinks we can have both, but must deny that Humean empiricists and rationalists can do it. 

She thinks we must focus on the individual and his or her will to solve this problem.

We need to understand the pitfalls that the empiricists and rationalists are facing in this argument. When we are confronted with her own theory, we have to know if her own objections to these two theories apply to her own theory or not. 

Phenomena (in our understanding) where we see laws of physics, etc. - It is only in the "noumena" (not in our understanding) which is outside the phenomena, only there can freedom (and the laws of it) exist. 

Laws of freedom are based on rationality, to be autonomous is to be rational. To be autonomous is to say that your actions are determined by beliefs or desires, only by you and your reason.

Your will is free, but there are laws (of freedom) which applies to it. 

Necessitation is understood as the 'desires' in the Phenomena are in conflict with 'rationality' we see in the noumena. The "I" of the noumena legislates for the "I" is the phenomena. 



Feb 1

pg. 20 Groundwork - 'all rational beings' - demonstrating some element of objectivity

Kors., of course, believes that the categorical imperative is 'constructed' by our reason/autonomy in some sense. It lacks objectivity.

Hume is unable to defend the instrumental principle, nor can he defend the principle of prudence. He can't maintain them if we go strictly by his philosophy. 

--------------------

Hume's metaphysics of the mind - 
-impressions
-copies of impressions (he calls them 'ideas')
-belief+desire (model)

The issue of causation. He believes:

We observe impressions, corresponding, over time. I.E. i1 to i2, etc. Constant Conjunction

The mind has the propensity to move from i1 to i2. 

His contention is that 'there is no necessity' in nature. We have neither an impression nor an idea of necessity. It is an illusion, this constant conjunction. Spatio-temporal contiguity is causation, but these connections are not necessary.

All empirical claims and causal connections are contingent and merely synthetic. It is logically possible that gravity won't have its affect on an object. The ideas are not contradictory.

Ideas of relation / Analytic - Truths of arithmatic, bachelor's married men
Matters of fact /Synthetic - everything else

-----------------------------

Hume believes you can't explain action if you don't have both belief and desire. You can't act just from one or the other. 

Belief + desire => rational act
Conditioned to laugh with a pen in hand + want cucumbers => laughter is rational act? (no)

There seems that there must be a conceptual connection between belief and desire. 

Acc. Kors., the self must make the conceptual connection between belief and desire.

If you can be conditioned to act well or badly, but this isn't enough for good rational action. 

She says, there must be a 'recognition', that the self recognizes that the beliefs and desires are appropriately connected. 

Belief and desire, but need recognition within mind of that connection. 

Hume has the 'bundle theory of self'. You never encounter yourself when thinking, only ideas and impressions. So, what is the self from the Humean perspective? He insists there is no self. You'd think that the self, if it were experiencable, would be either an idea or an impression.

logical necessity - all men are mortal type arguments
Proposition attitudes "I believe all men are mortal..." are different. 
Principles of inference, that is the objective basis of our thoughts.

Should not the principles of morality be similar? If they are deducible and discoverable, should we say that morality has the objective basis as that of logic?

34-Imagine myself, and an observer watching me. They might see that I have certain beliefs and dispositions. Acc. to Kors. Inter of Hume, there is input into me, and an outpout. I am not, somehow, really a part of what decides the output?

35-if instrumental rationality includes ends, then fine, if not, then you are stuck with merely a belief. How will ends be incorporated into instrumental rationality.

Reason is a slave of the passions, it gives you no ends. But passions show desire. Belief has the ends. There is no 'ought', only an 'is'. 

Can't derive an 'ought-statement' from an 'is-statement' - an 'is-statement' is descritive, while the 'ought' is prescriptive. Hume thinks you are committing a fallacy to from the is to ought. 

Instrumental principles can't be 'normative' in Hume.

If prudence were a rational requirement, then you couldn't do what is in the passage of 36. He thinks reason can't tell you that your particular choices are imprudent. Why? The principle of prudence is not a rational requirement. He can't use
 the princple of prud. normatively, but he can't demonstrate 'how' people are prudent through evolution and nature descriptive statements.

Human nature, constitutionally, is prudent (hume thinks). Not as a normative statement, but rather as a descriptive one. As a matter of brute fact, we are so constructed, and our original construction is such that 'we can't help but be prudent'. This isn't a normative fact though. There is no irrationality to doing something different. Behaving imprudently can't be condemned on the grounds of reason.

Reason is more of a calm passion, to Hume.

We are genetically prudent. Not rationally.

Hume can't make descriptive claims about prudence because it relies entirely upon descriptive (is) claims.

People can have turbulent or calm passions. On occasions when you act prudently, your calm passions have been dominant, and vice versa. It isn't a rational issue, merely a passionate one. This is a description, and thus we can't get normativity.

Normative principles must guide and motivate>...

Suppose two actions, a1 and a2. A1 is for your good and a2 is not. In order for Hume to maintain that prudence is a normative principle, he'd need to maintain that you need to prefer a1 over a2. But, he is emphatically against the idea that a person who 'prefers' a2 to a1 is somehow irrational.

Reason cannot supply us with normative claims.  



Feb 3

Hume can't make a difference between actual desires there is and rational desires. 

If the end is dictated by virtue, it has to be normative. You ought to prefer a virtuous end than not. But, how do you get to the 'ought' in Hume?

The problem that Kors has with Hume is that a 'person' is guided entirely by desires and beliefs, not by 'themselves' as a 'self'. 

Unfortunatley, Kors, thus far, has failed to give us an explanation of the 'self'. 

who is doing the recognizing between belief and desires? She might either need to postulate a distinct entity for this recognition, or it isn't very clear how her view doesn't collapse into her criticism of Hume's view of the mind.

Hume's perceptions, ideas and impressions, we never stumble upon an "I"...There is no I' that has the impressions and ideas, it is like a bag of marbles. 

Descartes says that there must be an I, in which the various properties, inhere.. The "I" does the recognizing of the Beliefs and desires. Kors is against the explicit Cartesian "I", then what is doing the recognition between the 'ends'a nd means'...the recognition of a belief.  

What makes for her understanding of a 'personal identity'?

Kant thinks that if there is an "I", then it must transcend the phenomena. 

Kant thinks the Will must endorse your desires for anything to occur. Volition/desire distinction.

If you want X, you must do Y. These are hypothetical imperatives. 
Prudence is an HI. "If you want to be happy, then Y." 

The HI: "Given your end, follow the best means available" - it towers above all the particular HI's. 

Particular HI's can be normative because you can violate them. You can't violate "The HI", however, thus Kors thinks it is n't normative. THE HI is descriptive, not normative. 

How does a principle become normative for a rational will? Kant and Kors wish to explain this. 

Normativity requires guide and motivation.

If there is no possibility of failure, it can't be a guide.

If it is analytic, then how is failure possible?

The caveat trivializes the syllogism. It does not explain 'why?'. 

Kors thinks Freedom to do either A or B, as so long as you have freedom, then you have normativity in place.

Necessitiation, as Sarkar understands it, only our desires and feelings and phenomonological self is what brings us away from doing what is right.

How is there normativity for God? 

What is the motivation for me to accept a bland fact about normativity. 

How do moral facts motivate us? Can we simply say "that is just what it means to be rational?"



Feb 8

Take an agent, and then take independent reality, Kors believes the dogmatic realist fails to give a proper account of how the independent reality is normative and motivating for and to the rational agent. What is it about the rational agent that motivates him to follow independent moral reality. The dogmatic rationalist seems to give guidance, but not motivation.

The empiricist, it seems, can give you motivation, but not guidance. Desires act as a motivator, but it seems to lack guidance.

Motivation seems begged by the dogmatic rationalist. Why should i do X? "because x is what you should do" begs it.

If instrumental principle is embedded in independent reality, what is the motivation to accept the instrumental principle? You can't use the instrumental principle to justify the motivation for usingthe instrumental principle. Instrumental principle seems to be a part of independent reality, like mathematics. 

She is a constructivist. She isn't lookin for objective, independent reality. 

How can she say we are motivated to believe that 2+2=4? or even more complex deductions of mathematics?

Goldbach's conjecture is either true or false. How can we be motivated to believe it?

She draws a distinction between Rationality and Reasons. She says that dogmatic rationalists begin with reasons, and then we 'go up' to rationality. She thinks we have to go from top/down instead to avoid problems. 

Because rational will is connected to rationality, it is then connected to reasons. 

Rational will proposes laws, rationality is the law, 

If the "will" postulates instrumental reason, then she can bypass the criticism of DR's. 

She does not disconnect Will from Principles in order to avoid DR's independent reality criticism.

In the very act of willing the end you are willing the means, in an analytic sense. The instrumental principle is analytic. 

There might be many means to a single end. Rationality seems require we pick the best of the means to the end (efficiency, maybe?). 

In order for something to be a requirement, there has to be a gap. If you cannot in principle violate a moral code, can it be a geniune moral code?

Will ---- Gap ---- Principle

Mental act of willing end --> Mental act of willing means
There seems to be a gap for the empricist.
She doesn't have a gap though.

She needs one, otherwise there doesn't seem to be a requirement. 
If she hasn't willed the means, you haven't even willed the means. 

If it is a matter of commitment, can't I just choose not to be committed? 

Commitment to the ends is a commitment to the means.

How is she not violating, for instrumental principle, in a similar argument on pg 51 towards another argument?

You make things normative for you. Constructivism. Normativity of a principle depends on your subjective commitment to it. 

Principle K*: Realize this end

Kors can't have this principle in the independent reality. Since it isn't then principle K seems something which we are committed to. Why should we be committed to principle K?


pg. 59 - 

Consider an individual through different time periods.

t0, t1, t2, t3...tn  for time
d0, d1, d2, d3...dn  for desires which constantly change
d0, d0, d0, d0...d0  for desire which never change

but, what about:

d1, d2, d2, d2...d2  for a single change

From d1 to d2 seems like the person in the noumena is legislating for the person in d1. 

Why can't I make and throw off my duties at whim?
 
You can't have a will without assuming the instrumental principle. But, if you can't, then it seems you can't violate it. 
If you can't violate it, then it isn't normative, is what she says.

How can you be necessitated if you get to make up your own moral reality? It seems that it isn't just applicable to the instrumental principle, but to nearly all principles, even the categorical imperative.

CI->identity->actions

 

Feb 10

Parallel/analogy between Acting and Believing

Acting is constitutive - you must be guided by fundamental, practical principles. Instrumental principle is a part of this.

Believing is also constitutive - Law of Excluded Middle - Our beliefs, however, are not always a perfectly consistent set, but we won't consciously, explicitly agree to a contradiction. 


It seems, Sarkar, that the law of excluded middle is objective in the dogmatic rationalist sense. If the act of believing includes being committed to the law of excluded middle....why should Kors think we must committed to this one in particular? Constructivism seems like it wants this to be true, objectively. 

But, why shouldn't the Categorical Imperitive and the Principle of Instrumentality which are constitutive of actions, then why can't we also say they are part of the independent reality just the law of exlcuded middle - it can be a synthetic a priori proposition, right?

If you want to be moral, and you aren't committed to the CI, then the dogmatic rationalist/Kant might say that your action lacks moral worth. So, they are interested in committment, but not to the idea that there isn't an objective reality like the constructivist.

Baking a Good cake is analogous to acting witht he CI and PI, or Believing consistutively with the law of excluded middle.

But, Kant would say that 'building a roof on a house' is not consistutive of the act of building a has. It seems that there are actions which are both good and evil, but it doesn't seem possible for Kors.

Categorical Imperative
Principle of Prudence - take into account your overall good
Hypothetical Imperative
Principle of Instrumentality 

Each of these seems to be constitutive, in Kors eyes. 

Degree of action sucks because we want to hold evil people responsible...for their actions.


An individual has a free will. "Laws of freedom" are necessary. A genuinely autonomous will is completely free of his desires, etc., but it still obeys the laws of freedom. Kors thinks that 'the moral law' is an expression of an 'autonomous agent'.

The law is not intended for you to test the maxim, for Kors. Acting from a maxim, constitutively, is necessary. You can't act not from a maxim, because it isn't an action.

The rational will (pg 39 in Kant) makes and wills 'universal laws', not just for themselves, but also for all rational beings.

Kant thinks we are committed to universal laws...not any old thing you like. For Kors, exactly what does she think we are committed to?

It seems difficult to commit yourself to these major laws, but also to commit ourselves (in the same sense of committment) to our contingent practical identities. It seems like one sort of commitment (the 1st) really can't be broken.

pg 63 - Your having a 'will to do x' doesn't seem to be enough. First she had said that: Can't be just your end, and your desire, but you must have the will, and only then does it become your reason. Now, the "x" must be good. If you are really committing yourself, then X must be good. 

We must ask though, musnt' that "X" which must be good also be independent of us? It must be independent of desires, and it must be independent of our will. She must give us an account of "what is good". If she has a theory of the good which is independent of these things, how does she not fall prey to the same problems as the dogmatic rationalist?

X is like a desire, btw.

existentialist heroic person says that the "good" in "will to do X" and "X is good" because of will. And, she thinks this would be arbitrary. The same seems to go for the X, desires. Whatever grounds "good" will make this non-arbitrary. But, without being able to define good in terms of will and desires, she needs the objective good in reality.


Actin for a reason--

Do you do something because you desire to do it or because there is a property of what you do that is good, and you do it because it is good?

Why do you X?
--"Because I desire X"
WHy do you desire X?
--....

This is the issue.

Is an act good because of what it promotes, or good in itself?

Empricists claim that the connection between a persons action and desires is a causal one. But, if you are a rationalist says that your reasons sees the good-making properties of action, and that is what causes you to choose the act.



Feb 15

Good-making properites of action-- Debate between: Williams and Raz

Williams: Desire based
Raz: objective fact based - moral facts provide motivation

Kors: 

As a Kantian, she's against Williams. As desires and inclination are "alien" in the sense that they don't essentially belong to the person. If you are governed by your desires, then you are being governed by something alien and not essential to you. You don't to be governed to yourself. Reason, however, is not alien to you. 

She thinks that the 'moral realism of Raz doesn't seem to motivate at all, unless you have an appropriate corresponding desire. Why should you 'listen' to the moral facts without a subjective state to motivate you?  

Her contention is that the motivation might be based on the objective facts, but what makes it morally right is that we are able to 'self-reflectively' see that this is the right motivation for us to have. We are motivated by acknowledging the rightness of our motives. It has both the subjective and objective parts, it seems.

Note that it is no longer an 'alien' thing, but rather it is 'you' that are endorsing it. The self must 'endorse' a desire. 

The difference between her and Hume is that in Hume there is no 'self' that is doing the endorsing. You (and your reason) are a slave to your beliefs and desires. Desires and beliefs are not absolutely dictating to you in Kors. The "I" gets to endorse, and you get to choose whether or not your desires and beliefs motivate you. 

Does the noumenal self which legislates for the phenominal self use its free will to choose whether or not desires and beliefs will be motivating? She doesn't have that distinction, acc. Sark.

Self reflexivity

Her "self" is entirely phenominal...

Is the "self" a distinct identity?

Act / Actions

Actions = [1, 2, 3], where 1 = end, 2 = logos or principle, and 3 = purpose

The logos/principle part is bothersome. My principle might be the CI, and that which makes this action a legitimate action. 

She thinks certain actions are eligble and others aren't.

It seems then, that without the CI, you cannot even have an action. 

The hypothetical imperatives would seem to demonstrate action, but she wouldn't think so. you can't have an HI by itself, it must be underwritten by the CI.

The CI is too essential to what counts as an action.

Your self-reflexive nature of your thinking that your 'X is right' is what makes something right.

If it is truly objective, it seems there shouldn't be a distinction between the 3rd and 1st person (the one she endorses) point of view on the rightness of an action.

kant: Respect is based on reason which apprehends the objective law. REspect is different from the other subjective feelings in this way. You are motivated out of respect for the law, not just some random subjective feeling. Respect is self-wrought in reason. Respect is not subjective in the same sense as the other feelings. 

Is your principle true or false, and if you pursuing it, it is because it is true, and because you have respect for the law. Self-reflexivity seems to lack worth if it is not anchored in the objective law. 

'endorse desires'
'respect laws'

Mind of a person: Reason and will .... there is an 'uptake'

Action of agent has 'good making properties' and these properties are determined by the law. There is a certain 'uptake' where we acknowledge the law's relationship to our 'good making properties'. pg 211 - Moral realist says the uptake doesn't play any part...

facts1.....actions
facts2.....motivation for action
facts3.....motivaton for motivation
etc.
pg 212

Aware (214) getting towards the notion of self-reflexivity

The lioness is conditioned. It seems the human isn't. The lioness, it seems isn't aware of the good-making properties, and thus it doesn't have those properties for the lioness. The normative force isn't objective it seems, only a subjective mental state.

What makes you believe something is a good action? (which is different from 'what makes an action good')

You are motivated by awareness of the right motivation. You aren't motivated by good-making properties, but by awareness of that you good reasons to be motivated.

Why isn't the 'awareness' also attackable as the 'motvated' in the facts...actions framework? It seems that if the definition isn't self-defining, then she may be subject to this criticism herself.



Feb 17

Action - [Act, principle, end]

Motivation -> Reason       (this is what Kors is interested in)

The full action, via the principle expresses motivation.

When an agent sees that an action is intrinsically worthwhile, then they are motivated. Kors thinks that the Dogmatic Rationalists make too strong a distiction between motivation and the action. 

On Kors view, in the very recognition is the expression, and that expression will be the action itself?

WHen you perform action, you are really appreciation that what you are motivated to do is really the good thing to do. ?? (225)

Logos is prescription (only one right way)

"Choice" that I make is mine. Without that choice, the agent can't say it was his. Belief and desires can't dictate it.

Attraction to and end may not be your choice, but 'acting upon that desire, and to pursue end' is your decision.

What makes something an 'activity' is my 'choice'.

Kors lays out a formal theory of action, which she conflates with a 'substantive theory of action'. 

The dogmatic rationalist can agree with Kors that about the formal theory of good of action, but that will not be able to explain 'what makes an action good'. What the agent can't do is 'by choosing a principle' then make 'the principle true'. Choosing a principle does not make it true, for the dogmatic realist. Kors thinks it does make it true, it seems.

226 - if they 'action as a whole is 'good'' then why must she disagree with the dogmatic rationalist?

Kors doesn't think your 'motivation: reason:: act: end' 

So, what is the relationship of motivation and reason?

227 - Rational agent is one who acts only on principle. How is this different fromt he Dogmatic rationalist's view? 

Kors doesn't think she has a difference between formal and substantive, but I think she really only has a formal and not a substantive.

"heap"
"organic unity" - physical things, but also living things

obstacles, fears

"manifold" - it is natural, somehow that you can distinguish between different entities.

"Natural Kinds" - Quine - How do you parse nature at its joints? How do you make natural classifications? What makes it so natural?

Living organisms - acts to sustain itself; produces things similar to itself   [these are important for Kors]
In the ultimate analysis, Living organisms have a unity of their own, and their function is to maintain themselves in that organic unity.

This seems true of humam living things. 

There are principles which guide non-human living thing. But, then so are we have humans.

What differentiates us is our rationality. That rationality enables us to sustain ourselves as human (very Aristotelian).

All non-human animals are 'agents'. They act in purposeful manners. They have biological principles (not normative principles) which determine how they act. Note, they don't have choice. They must do as they do; they must act on those principles.

Human principles are 'motivating' and 'guiding', but there is no such thing for the animal. There aren't options for animals. 

If the bio-principles are fundamental to the teleology of a non-human living thing, they are about the flourishing of those creatures, and biological determined, and the complete fulfillment of these principles turns out to be the paradigmatic case of that species.

The same is for humans, it seems. If the teleological principle applies to animals, then it applies to us. Our principle is the CI. And, complete fulfillment of it, show paradigmatic case of human. If our actions don't follow the CI, then we aren't flourishing as a human.

The CI is the unifying principle of our activity. 

------------
 
There are constitutive standards for what makes a good house.

Defect in your form, and by the constitutive principles, and you can't carry out your activities, will be a defect in your action.

In order to have action, there is a constitutive principle which guides it, and that principle exists in virtue of constitutive standards which make you what you are.

"It is the same activity, badly done" - but this seems odd ... Are the bad and good persons really doing the same activity, only the bad person is doing it badly?

Constitutive standards of a house give rise to the normative standards of a house.


Good activity 				
Done for Principle P			
Virtuous moral person, constituting yourself well. 
Following the principle.

Same Activity, badly done.
Done for principle P, but not following the principle very well.
Not constituting yourself well.

CI is the ultimate principle that is guiding/motivating action.

Conforming to the CI is the fate of the human. Activity at a human is CI. Constitutionally, you cannot be said to have performed an action if you haven't followed CI. Defect humans, disunified humans, are not perfectly following CI.

Have property P & Q - of the same kind
A
B
'A' is a defect instance of B.

Of different kinds
Y
Z
Might have all the same properties except Q, where Y has Q and Z doesn't. 


Kors needs a 'defective act' or a 'defective instance' for her theory to make sense. If we don't say A is a defective instance of B, then why shouldn't we just say it is a different kind of B (like Y and Z)?

It seems that 'kind' is a property. 

Virtuous activity is being paradigmatic of a kind, while vicious is being a defective instance of a kind.

Unity is the goal; the only way to achieve it is by using the CI in my actions. There is no other way to perform the action. 

"For the sake of the moral law" - She can have her cake and eat it too. You act for the sake of the moral law, and it gives you the constituional correctness and the normative correctness. 

Following CI is the same as Unification. This isn't cause and effect. They are equivalent to her. 


Why should I be motivated to be human? "That's just what it means to be human"

Human principles are biological, CI isn't a bio principle. This is in contrast to the giraffe.



Feb 24

Paradox of self-constitution:

Time-0: Dude, with beliefs and desires, and an "I" in the middle.
Action
Time-n: Dude, with beliefs and desires, and an "I" in the middle.

Is it the same "I" in the middle? 

If there is no "I", no single identity, and the issue of personal identity is at stake, then it seems that there are really two different individuals. Their identities don't seem to match.

Giraffe's and non-rational animals cannot take on identities. They have their natural identity, and nothing more. We as humans also seem to have natural identities, but we are unique in that we can take on and shed other identities.

Ch. 3

Formal principles: Kant
Substantive (Substantial?) principles: 

Substantive must be derivable from formal in order them for to be 'binding on the will'. 

Williams' position: 'How should we live'? shouldn't be confused with 'How should we live morally?'

It seems that morality is only one institution; one might, for example, devote oneself to arts or music, or sports, etc.
He thinks morality has been ballooned out of proportion of importance. 

'sub-deliberations' and 'weighing'

in contrast to 'weighing', Kors thinks we have testing



Mar 1

'moral ought' in contrast to the 'should'
This 'should' is the all things considered point of view.
While 'moral ought' is on element in the testing model.

Weighing Model
------------

[A1, a2, a3,...,an]
[w1, w2, w3,...,w3]

A's being moral considerations
W's being the weights, and the one that is the highest weight, will demonstrate a correspondingly highest moral consideration

It is not true, acc. to WIlliams, that your 'moral ought' will triumph over your 'should'

W stands for the weight, and that weight is 'how valuable it is to you'.

-----Paper to read: Ethics as a system of hypothetical imperatives


Testing Model
-------------

{Act, principle, end,....all the other consideration} = Maxim, our subjective principle

Together, the entire maxim, the proposed action, is my reason.

I then take this maxim, and see if it satisfies the categorical imperative.

If you can't act on it though, if it doesn't pass the test, then this maxim is no maxim at all. It is no reason at all.

her contention that these don't even now count as reasons is totally different from William's, who will still count the 'non-should' things as still reasons. Those moral considerations are still reasons enough, in his view. 

Korsgaard has a much higher standard as to what can possibly count as a reason.

There is still weighing and balancing going on inside the maxim, but only of the commensurable. The testing model incorpoates the weighing model, but not the other way around.

Oddly, it seems that, unbeknownst to Kors, in some way, there seems to be a weighing of universalized, competing maxims. It seems then, that even the testing model may not tell us what to do, in the ultimate analysis.




Mar 3

Prudence - Kors thinks there is a missing principle. Without this missing principle, she thinks that none of the other principles can be put to use. We must identity this principle. As I said, because without it, neither the hypothetical imperative nor the principle of prudence can 'get going'. This missing principle is a 'substantive principle'. 

principle of prudence (which is also a type of hypothetical imperative)-- act in such a way that you maximize your happiness

It is inevitable that you can't fulfill all your desires. She says "Why should we be prudent instead of imprudent?" Why should one desire, contradictory to the others, not get fulfilled instead of fulfilling those other desires?

This is bad for the empiricist. 

The instrumental principle (HI) doesn't select the end. It doesn't say which desire is really the best end. The IP? (or maybe the PoP) can't even tell us that we should prefer even combinations of desires as ends, not unless we have some missing principle.

Formal principles give you enormous scope. Substantive principles don't. Kors thinks the missing principle is substantive. But, why must it be? It seems that there might be formal principles, broad ones that don't really tell us what to do directly, that might work, but not be substantive.

For example: "Choose any desire" might be the missing, it is formal, but it isn't substantive, but it does somehow activate the principle of prudence and the instrumental principle.

How does Kors maintain her own normativity? it seems that the agent, inevitably, will always do what is right...eh? She thinks that if they can't really fail, then they aren't normative.

Mill analogy:

Question, 'Why should I be prudent?'

Person in society - a Single desire

The missing principle is what the PoP hooks onto in order to provide an answer to this question.

In the absence of th emissing principle, why should it be obvious to choose one desire over another? The missing principle is substantial enough to tell what which desire to choose over another. 

All hypothetical imperatives are: if P, then Q. 
The substantive missing principle is what makes a hypothetical imperative 'hypothetical'. 
PoP would be like a HI, if you could define happiness, but Kant thinks we fail to do that. Unlike for HI's ends, there seems to be an actual end of PoP. 

P is the missing principle of the "if P, then Q" of the hypothetical imperative. THe missing principle gives a reason to choose P. the HI will not be activated unless there is a principle which is offering which input should be P, which is end we should choose.

The HI can't guide, by itself. It needs an input to become activated. You require a battery of other principles to start activate and input into the HI, and to have normativity.

You need a substantive principle because it allows you to produce a nice unity, Kors thinks.

Why is one way of unifying to be more preferable than another? (Sark)  

The CI makes you a unified person, and if there is a formal missing principle, then we need to ask if there are a number of ways of unifying oneself.

The possibility of balancing does not come from the theory of good, but rather the possibility of balancing precedes the human good. I wonder, can we have a proper theory of balancing without a proper theory of good? It still seems like there are a variety of unities. How do we know which unity is best? Is there a highest good for Kors? 

Kors says she doesn't have a formal missing principle, but it were, then it would be for unification...But, she thinks it should be substantive. 

------------
DR
Circularity

P -> Q
P
Then, Q

If in our justification of this argument is the argument of itself, then we are begging the truth.

The same for the HI. It seems that in order to justify the HI, we must invoke the HI, and only someone who already accepted teh HI coudl understandt he justification of the HI.

She doesn't like this circularity.




Mar 10

Particularism - eschews any kind of rule-governed morality. Reasons are never based on generalities and rules. 

FOr Kors, the 'you' disappears if it is exclusively desire moving to yuor action. In order to preserve the 'you' in 'you, you have to preserve the CI. And, that is what willing is all about.

Not to will the HI is not to will an end at all. When you accept the HI, what youa re doing is saying that the HI constitutes your willing. The CI makes you the cause of your action. 

Hypothetical reason is important because unless you are looking to take the means to an end, you haven't really adopted that end.

The HI emphasizes the causal forces within you. The CI emphasizes that it is 'you' who is the cause.

WHat is the difference between 'being constitutive' and 'being definitionally true'?

Kant says, you can give up the means if you give up the end. The HI is analytic in this sense. 

Kant says that an evil person has evil principles (which is contradictory to Kors doctrine).

For Kors, any being not following the HI is not said to be willing. Willing and HI are tautologically related.

Kors thinks we determine our mind - You can't act unless you are guided by HI and CI. In the same way you constitute your mind for logic, you constitute your mind for action by HI and CI.

How can this be descriptive, but also normative (69). If HI is going to be constitutive, well how can you violate it? If you can't violate it, then Sarkar thinks it isn't normative. 

How is action and willing normative? It doesn't seem possible to transgress the HI, as it is constitutive of willing. If you haven't follow the HI, then you haven't willed. 

Can you satisfy the HI in terms of degrees? If it is analytic, you'd think not. If it isn't analytic, maybe. What does that look like. Have an end, and many means to it. Some means are better than others.

Sark: it seems that the "I" plays a full role or none at all in willing.

"I" possesses the will, reasons...it is supposed to be above the desires, but not dictated by desires.

Action/Maxim - [act, principle, purpose]

You test this entire thing in the CI to see if it is universalizable. Note that the CI defines what really counts as action or maxim, and so HI and maxims are playing a very subsidiary role.

Kors thinks that the HI can only be used when its end is morally endorsable. 

------------

What does it mean to operate 'as a whole'? (72)

Beliefs and desires, summed, can't constitute you. It seems that the whole, includes beliefs and desires, is what might count as you. 

provisionally universal is intended to be absolutely universal, but it is provisionally because you might be able to see otherwise, at this point in your thinking process. 

She beats particularism because desire doesn't consistute you, but rather 'you' are over your desires. And, 'you' includes being under the operation of CI, a general rule, which is contrary to particularism.

Kors says, if the principle is objective and out there, like desires are independent of you, then the principle independent of you is dictating you, and you are governed by the principle. Then, it seems like we have that problem that you aren't really doing it, it is the principle. But, since she identities the principle with you, as you, as constituting you in some way, then you are governing yourself. The principle isn't independent of you, for Kors.

---------

Deciding and predicting.

77, 'good reason' - how is this not objective? DR can say that there are objectively good or bad reasons.


Mar 15

In determinism, esp. the laws of nature, it seems that the past determines the present. 

Efficacy is affected by other agents/circumstances. They may frustrate you, prevent you from doing your action. 

CI, Highest Good- good and happiness are the two parts. One's goodness should be maintain an equivalent ratio with happiness. CI = practical reason.

Theoretical postulate - theoretical reason doesn't lead us to it (not a cognitive claim)
-happiness/goodness equivalence
-God must exist
-freedom

Kors thinks Kant won't be able to maintain the good/happiness ratio. She thinks that either God plans everything or the Laws of Nature do.

Autonomy - CI
Efficacy - HI

The future can render my action ineffective.



Mar 17

5.3 onward is really about Action.

Continuum of action
 
On one end, the lowest kind of animal, on the other end, man

Properties of humans (Sark. Good bad or otherwise)
(1) intention
(2) representation of environment
(3) form

Are all of these properties attributable to an evil person? It seems that an evil person, with an evil will and evil principles, can have an evil set of properties. Why should we not say that an action includes these properties?

It seems that the CI and HI play an important role in defining what consistutes an action and the properties.

Sarkar believes that animals have intention, and some sense of agency. They bring aobut things in the world that is somehow different than the rock.

Laws of Freedom, what are they like?

Kant is unable to explain why bad action occurs.

If the will is constituted by the CI, then how can you perform a bad action?

Given her solution, is she able to escape the problem that Kant fails to escape?

It seems that plants have representation for the same reason that animals might.

THis continuum demonstrates 'Degrees of Action'

There seems to be a broad continuum of Degrees of action, including plants, animals, and humans. It seems that when we get to the human endof this continuum, there is a very unique subcontinuum of this self-concious action which matches the sort of Action she spoke about earlier in the book..

Reversing causation - not psychology of agent causing action, but instead, somehow the action is causing the psychology of the agent. 


Mar 22

Non-Rational Animals, on the one hand, and Rational Animals, Humans, on the other.

Kors. compares and contrasts these.

The world, for the animal, is determined by the 'form' of the animal. The animal has a certain kind of instinct or perception. The laws of causality tell the animal what to do given their instincts. And, from this picture, Kors thinks this constitutes the will of the animal. This is the autonomy of the animal. 

'This is typically what X non-rat. animal does'

NRAnimal have action. The animal's perception of an object is motivationally loaded. 

A snake does not respond to a flower in the same way that a bee might. There is something in the bee that is interested and appealed to the flower.

Salivation is a movement, it is causally determined.
You going to the fridge, that requires deliberation and knowing the incentives-- that is action.

Sark crit: It seems that there isn't a difference between the "I" of the animal and the "form" of the animal. How does the animal act? If the animal isn't acting in terms of representations or perception, what does it mean for the animal to act? It seems that the form of the animal isn't distinct from the perception, instinct, and laws of causality. It seems that her distinctions don't demonstrate that animals have action.


RHumans, have principles, which tell you what constitutes reason. THe human must decide which incentive or inclination or desire it will act upon. There are alternatives, and you get to choose which alternative you choose, and you do that upon the basis of a principle, and thus there is a special sort of 'deeper' action than the animals. 

Animals are 'acting' because they act in accordance with their own laws of causality. Humans have deeper forms of action because the 'desires, inclinations, and incentives' are detached from the "I" (unlike the animal), and that you somehow choose between them. The animal, on the other hand, really doesn't seem to have a 'choice' in the same way.

Animals aren't self-conscious and self-determining like humans.

My Crit: Animals aren't self-determined, the laws of physics are external to animal. The laws of nature forces the animal. No animal doesn't act autonomously.

instinct:laws of causality::incentive:principle (CI)
 
Sark: it seems there is a strong deterministic, causal relationship between instinct and laws of causality, but there is a sharp divide between the incentive and principle, as there is free will.

Kors doesn't think there is a 'neutral world', our physical and psych. endowments shape our perceptions of the world for us.

Kors has a majoritarian view of animal form. 

For humans, the degree to which you are acting is isomorphic to the degree of good

Sark Crit: it doesn't seem the animal can possible transgress its principle, its instinct.

Bad action for animal is failing to meet the ojbecti measures of the action. if you can't attribute the action to the roach, then you can't say it failed. She does att. the action though.

Sark Crit: pg 113, it seems the animal is programmed to 'extend his repertoire'. 

pg 114. "Detachment" is about removing the teleological implications of an object, the 'loaded' part, in order to see it scientifically.



Mar 24

intelligence connectted to HI, to causal relations

Reason
Self-consciousness

Self-consciousness comes in Degrees

Self-consciousness comes in different forms
-physical space
-social space
-mental space

Do the forms of self-consciousness come in degrees?

Fears form the basis of our inclination

IF the animals of have degrees of self-consciousness, then it seems the animal should be able to separate itself from its instincts and incentives. If they are self-conscious, it doesn't seem they can be determined by their instinct. 

It seems that there is a weighting from D1 (desires) D2, etc. to W1, W2, etc. That weighting is based upon the laws of causality. To be genetically conditioned then, s to see an animal in asituation, whereby D2->W2 becomes the one which action comes from instead ot he others.

Kors thinks that humans are different though. THe rational principles is the space between desires and Will. 

What is the role of self-consciousness in animals? Kors doesn't tell us, it seems.

Reflective Distance is the space between the incentive and the response (pg116). It seems essential to have this space in order to nurture reason. If the animal doesn't have reflective space, then it can't reason as humans can. "How large does this space need to be?" What is the point of giving the animal a tiny bit of space if it can't do anything? How much space does it need to be efficacious? THe "I" is in the reflective space. From that vantage point, we can see what are our desires want, and thus the reason and the "I" in the space can govern these things. The principles within you will give you an explanation of why you should accept one inclination rather than another.

What can replace the instincts of animals?

This reflective distance should let you do something metaphysical. In that distance, we have our reason, and reason comes up with our principles, and so our principles are made within this space. Our free will is in this space. 

Imagine:

An animal that has a variety of alternatives, its intelligence gave it many hypothetical imperatives. How does it know what to choose? If it can choose, how is it genetically determined? The animal doesn't seem to have reason, so what is guiding it? How do we explain animal behavior.

Reflective Distance:
-experience, memory, imagination --Kors thinks this is in animals' Reflective Distance...

I think those qualities can be understood simply in terms of desires and so forth. It doesn't seem to do any real metaphysical work in the animal.

When you adopt your principles, you change the relationship between incentives and inclinations.

If self-consciousness is significant in order for us to have part of the soul, then it seems that whenever there is self-consciousness, there must be distance. 



Mar 29

Inside or outside - 

Individual ----------------------    and over here Object,: with objective properities (P1, p2,...,pn)

That object provides an incentive for part of the individual. And, that incentive is turned into an inclination. And, the self-conscious must choose among the various inclination, choosing which to act upon. 

The realist says that if your incentive is based upon the objective properties of an object, such that value is one of the properties of the object, then you have objective realism. 

Anti-realism obviously doesn't agree to what the realist thinks. They don't think that objects have the property of value.

Kors thinks that the realist and anti-realist are both wrong (no idea how). She thinks it is a combination of both. She thinks that property of objects are not irrelevant, but rather only relevant as related to the human condition. Again, 'up to us' becomes important. She thinks there are properties of an object which create an incentive, but those properties are moral ones.

You confer value on the act of dancing because that is what you want.

What is the role of inclination (124)? Sark doesn't see the point of it. 

Deliberation is a action, right? It seems difficult to have an "I" and to deliberate outside of pre-extant unity. (125)

130 - I personally like to identity agents by their choices and actions, I think that is part of their identity in some way. But, not in the way that Kors thinks.

Deliberation (131) must be guided by CI and HI, and if my action isn't different from my decision, then there doesn't seem to be a possibility that I've done an evil act. 



Mar 31

Reading: "Of the Standard of Taste" - nature of moral and aesthetic properties

Reason and Animals- "Treatise of Human Nature" - Book 1, Part 3, Section 16


Ch.7

Combat Model - comes in two versions(I and II)

I. Reasons v. Passions

In Hume, reasons have no role to play. Really, just a conflict between desires. Reason is impotent to choose between desires. Its task is activated in understand the means of a desire which has already been chosen. 

Kors thinks in this case that the agent has no role at all. 

II. Does the agent identify himself with the reason.

Of course, the question is...? (he left the topic)


In the Consitution model, from Plato, we get the analogy between the city and the soul.

In the City, there are, on the top guardians (philosopher kings), and then auxiliaries, and then the craftsmen and workers. THe guardians identify themselves with the city as a whole. They unify the city. The guardians identify their good with the good of the city as a whole.

Corresponding to the workers are the appetitites, corr. to auxiliaries are 'high spiritedness', and corr. to guardians is reason. 

If there were no consistution of the city, then things would be a mere heap. 

The appetities make a proposal, and then reason must intervene to know what is and isn't acceptable. Once reason makes its decisions, then the spirit, which is always allied with reason (and never with appetites), executes and carries out what reason has decided.

When you act, your action then is not just by the appetities or high spirit or reason, any of them alone, but rather by 'the whole person', with all 3 of these things. This is the consistutive look at the soul.

Reason which leads to consistution of the Soul is based upon the CI/HI. 

Crit of Kors: How can the self-conscious count as the "whole"? The whole doesn't seem capable of being self-conscious. 

Constitutonal ModeL-- Crit of Kors: What is the identity of the agent which is over and above the parts?

What is the essence of the agent that allows her to say that the agent can identify themselves with consistution?

Hview either.

her argument against II (that if an agent selects reason, then they can never select passion), then it seems that the same can be said against th constitutional argumented. It seems that you can't select anything but reason in her constitutional. Why must the constitution identify with any one part of the soul instead of another? She would be completely against consistuting onself with passions. 

City is identified with the constitution. To overthrow the rulers doesn't follow the constitution, and it is no longer a  city.



April 7

Plato's republic - 500d
 What is the objective of the guardian in settin gup the republic? If it is only setting up the right procedure, then Korsgaard is correct. 
The philospher is trying to translate the ideal model of a city into reality for his city.

If they are going to figure out the constitution, ...?

504d - 506a

If GOodness is at the top of everything, including knowledge of particular things, and if the city is supposed to be well organized by a constitution, how could the philosopher king, having full knowledge (including of the good) not adequately use the good to construct the consistition?

Good is the goal of all their activities, including building the constitution.

The principle of pure procedural justice seems at the very least connected to a substantive one. But, it might go further, it seems that the substantive good is the foundation that precedes any procedure we build upon it.

517b

THe knowledge of good is required to comprehend and define what is right because the right participates in the good, it is perceptible only because of the good. Acting right requires being in the visible realm of the good.


Kant - -37

Metaphsyics of Morals - 6:376 "subdue Vice-breeding inclinations" 6:418 "the homo noumena puts the phenomona under obligation"

The CI can't be connected to the inclination. Wouldn't a moral agent be better off without inclinations? If we had none, we would be pure moral, autonomous agents.

We must 'curb' our inclinations, we need to harmonize them into a whole called happiness. Principle of prudence, but it isn't an end. Pursuing happiness is not a duty. Everyone has the natural inclination to pursue happiness. 

Kant's picture has changed, substantially, it seems. He didn't abandon his idea. Inclinations don't have absolute, unconditional worth. 

kORSGaard is arguing that, inclinations->will->reason....

Desires and will needs a harmony, 

Passages that conflict with what she is saying: 61

Sarkar can't believe that reason isn't in the ruling sphere, that inclinations dont' have to be under the jurisdiction of reason if you are going to be a moral agent. 

If reason/inclinations/desires are equal, then why should i disagree and disregard my inclinations and desires when I need to do moral action?

61 - there are no inclinations/desires in the intelligble realm because they are governed by nature.

How is he a proper self if he isn't identified with his reason?


7.5.3
Legislative authority is given toa sovereign (either one person or many) - 1 person a monarchy, a few an aristocracy, and all a democracy. The individual has a right to the extent that he can enforce it. The state and its individuals are 'coercive' - there is mutual coercion, as all the individuals equally coerce each other to respect their rights. 

legitimate governments arise when everyone gives authority to a sovereign, regardless of which size is chosen. Legimaticy requires approval of all individuals. Each size has its own virtues and vices. 

Kors cites the republic as the true constitution

MM 6:340 - plato would not accept this. Kant would not accept the idea that someof the people chose the autocrat without the others, and some were against it, then it would be legit. The workers might be against the philosopher king, and be illegit. Likewise, it doesn't seem that the inclinations should be in a position to tell us what we should do...Kant would be against Plato's city, possibly. Reason pushes down and orders the inclinations about...Reason does play a dominant role in Kant's moral philosophy. But, he would be for the king (reason) ruling the workers without the workers consent.

imagine 3 cities, one each happy with a different constitutional setup....it seems that you can be unified in different ways. It seems that the different constitutions allow any type of action. You can be unified to do any action, as you might theoretically have a city unified under any constitution (it would be legit/they are happy, etc.)

if moral principles give you unity, and there is only one moral principle, then her analogy seems to break down. Does that mean that the multiple types of constitution can't adhere to morality>?

Plato doesn't think that these size/forms of gov are equal. Kant is open to them being equal.



April 11

Action 
Only Good action are actions - in which case, it isn't clear how bad actions are possible.
This isnt' a black and white, good and bad actions. There are degrees.

Bad actions- 
Continuum- Aristocracy on the least bad side of bad, and anarchy, worst side.
(Aristocracy)'timocracy', 'oligarchy', 'democracy', 'tyranny' (Anarchy) 
Anarchy is like a mere heap
Degrees of bad action.
Anarchy is the complete non-action, but everything better than it is still action, just bad action.

As you go down the continuum, you are go losing constitution.

Sark: acc. Kant, we don't need degrees of action. What we need is a more plausible idea of goodness, and therefore degrees of goodness. 

MM - part 2 - Doctrine of virtue
+a----------------------(-a)
Virtue------ (0) -------Vice

The least degree of goodness is the most evil. It is actually evil/vice. 

Degrees of action seem less plausible than a degrees of goodness

Kors must defend bad action, or her theory is in jeopardy.

Sark: Why should a person side with reason? Reason might command us to constitute ourselves in a certain way, and constitution might involve reason, but there seems to be a circular justification of reason...

I'm not sure if Sarkar's question is important.

Groundwork: pg 24 - Human will (unlike God's) is not infallibly governed by reason. This is Sarkar's interpretation.
pg 27 - the conclusion of a practical syllogism is not an action (countering Kors) 
-- it leaves open that an action can be performed even where the will is contrary to the CI. 
pg 26 - the poisoner is really performing an act.

I see a form/content distinction here. Pure procedural justice - the content flows as a consequence *unintended* from the form. 

Form/content of person
Form/content of action (think this through)
Form/content of movie
CI/Maxim (Form/Content)

A tyrannical person really doesn't seem to be like the mere heap. 

Must fit "Dr. Evil" example in next test.

pg 162 - 

Ex:

1 Take an individual who subscribes to the CI (Good person, right?)
2 Take an individual who subscribes to the principle of self-love (Bad person, right?)
3 Take an individual who subscribes to some other principle that isn't the CI, let us say principle of sympathy (Bad person, right?)

3 should be applauded, but his action has no moral worth. Kant isn't saying the actions are bad, and he isn't even saying the person is bad, all he is saying is that their action lacks moral worth. The action is done in conformity with the CI, but not for the sake of the CI. But, if that is the case, perhaps it is difficult to maintain Kors' thesis.

She has to call this person a bad person. But, Kant doesn't.

Work: pg 11 - talks about different between what deserves encouragement, but not esteem.

Degrees of action which describes these example individuals don't seem plausible explanations, nor satisfactory.

Work, pg 26-27 - someone can genuinely act on the principle of prudence

A person is by definition an organism constituted by the CI. I really think there are persons which don't follow this narrow definition, nor has she given us good enough justification for her narrow definition.

Various types of Soul:
Aristocratic/Monarchy
timocratic
oligarchic
democractic
tyrranical 

Top being most unified and moral to the bottom, beng least unified (heap-like).

Concepts of unity/agency are different notions. Why should we equate unity with agency? 

We see that the strong thesis that only the CI can unify you is diluted in this chapter. It seems that other principles might unify you to some degree, but never to the same degree as the CI. 

Agency and Unity by definition. 

She is being slick in transferring the connotation of 'tyrrany' as being bad to the badness of the person who is so disunified. It isn't so obvious for things like democracy at all.

The stages of various types of the soul is about 'usurping the role of reason' - reason seems, to some extent, be replaced by a doppelganger or another thing. What is that thing?

If she is Kantian, she'll need to agree that reason plays the central role. Any practical identity which doesn't square with reason is not allowed. It seems that 'reason' has a tyrranical role!!

Timocratic person mistakes what is moral for what is honorable. They lack flexibility, is their problem. Your sense of honor may mislead you, it may seem that something is moral but it is not. Reason, however, does not mislead you. Reason also seems to have a certain sort of flexibility that is needed for you to act correctly in your circumstances. Honor lacks that flexibility.

Aristocratic - CI
Timocractic - Honor
Oligarphic - ...

Note that they constitute themselves with different principles

This whole analogy seems so forced.

IN aristocracy, the various desires are so beautifully structured by the CI, that he is more than a person in self-control, he will be a virtuous person. A self-control person will suppress the right desires and let the right desires rule, but the virtuous person doesn't even have these problem because the CI has arranged everything to the point of the unity that this civil disunity/ internal-conflict doesn't occur.

In a democrotic person, each desires has its own proper say. A minimal, formal procedure will just pick out which desires to pick out. This is absurd in some sense. It is like randomly choosing what to do. The democratic unity is filled with accident, action is happenstance and accidental. Someone governed by the CI, however, has the resources with which to order his desires and govern his soul. 

How can you be unified by a principle, without degree...but then go on to say that there are degrees of unity, which based upon what you unify yourself with? This is an ambiguity.

How can a tyrannical soul to be consistently ruled and unified, but not governed, but then not really be choosing actions or performing action? (pg 171-172)

How is the tyrannical person who is 'ruled' by something else any different than the aristocratic person who uses his contingent practical identity as invoilable law (pg 23)?

Paradox creeps up. 

You must make yourself into an agent. Are you an agent before that? I think you have to chronologically be an agent before 'making yourself an agent'. She holds you responsible for what you do and don't do, even when you aren't an 'agent' as she defines it...but the usual definition of agency starts at where you hold someone responsible.

The pure procedure in Plato does the job of unifying. In Kant, it is the CI that does the unifying. Unified agents perform action.

Inward justice is contrasted to outward justice. Inward justice is about how a state is related to its citizens. Outward is about the state relates to other states or non-citizens agents.

Russian noble. [Reminds me of the compatibilist argument: where a machine predicts what you will do, and if you would do evil, then it prevents you from doing it, and if you would do what is right, then it 'lets' you do the right thing]. The Kantian notion of marriage is introduced. Unity of wills. There is an exhange of ownership of person, body, and will; and a unification of it. Shared property, including not just their bodies here, but also their wealth - which is the very thing they are making a pact about.

City relating to City
Person relating to Person

(here is that mesh between the platonic issue, and this marriage, russian nobleman issue)

We have questions about the persistence of personal identity. Like, the young man being different or same as the what he will be when he grows up. 


The poorly unified cities requires specific external circumstances, or they will disintegrate.

Glaucon:

GOod soul->good conseq. (doesn't require much justification)
Bad soul->good conseq.
Bad soul->bad conseq.
Good soul-> bad conseq. (seems to require justification; what is the 'good' here)

You might be a good quarterback, but that doesn't mean you will be a quarterback for the saints. You can reasonably say you won't make it through torture.

Action, Unity, and GOodness must be separate (sark. crit.)

181 - how do you get from the purely formal principle of morality to a substantive notion of what to do?

Disunification is really having many parts which are unified - at least for cities. 

Just as city might be smaller cities, the noble many is disunified...into many smaller wills, which aren't unified.

If you make a promise to take care of a man's children after he dies, then after he dies, it isn't like those obligations to take care of those children some how disappear. You still, in some sense, have a duty to fulfill the promise to the past man. 

It seems to me that there really are two different types of promises. The normal promise can be relinquished. It seems that there is only the claim of the man that he holds on his wife. Assuming the young and the old have the same identity through time, and it is a normal promise, then it seems he can relinquish it. But, why must this be a normal promise? It seems that there is such a thing as a promise that the man also has himself made a promise. A covenant. A promise to respect the fulfill of a promise, a promise that he can't be allowed to relinquish the promise. A promise that if he asks to relinquish, it is not legitimate. No legit relinquishment.

Nozick, identity. Series Person, person-Series. Continuing connection. 

WHen Kors says 'integrity' Sark think she means 'unity'. We mean 'moral integrity' by integrity, but she doesn't. 

Kors takes it as obvious that the young and the old are different, that He himself doesn't know who he is. The wife finds herself in a puzzling situation. This is parallel to how it is diffcult for a well-ordered state to deal with a 'state' in anarchy.

She isn't wronging john, but she may or may not be wronging Jack. Probably not wrong Jack though, because they aren't even married.

Obligations through time become incoherent if we lack a consistent, stable identity/self/agent through time. Duties or rights of the person do not pass through time to whomever they 'evolve' into, whatever contingent practical identity they eventually take on, sheds all obligations.

But isn't agency the very type of things that remains table, it is that which enables obligations to pass through time, from one contingent practical identity to another. Agency isn't a choice, it lasts a lifetime. To say that 'killing yourself' is a way to shed your agency is tongue and cheek; that is obvious, but it isn't obvious how one might actually 'choose' to shed their agency otherwise.

WHile I agree that obligations might disintigrate with their identities, I don't think obligations actually disintigrate - this is far too arbitrary. 

Parfit's view of successive selves is quite different from her understanding. Her's includes a division of the self, an internal conflict. His isn't...

Does the wife know that John is turning into Jack when she makes the promise? how does this change her responsibility? Also, how does this operate within marriage? Doesn't the promise she makes with john rely upon the future obligation of marriage?

Unity of will seems to break. How can she say that she needs to do what John asks her to do? 

Her promise seems to be in limbo, the obligation is in limbo. It exists, but it isn't fulfillable. In some sense, there isn't anyone to hook that obligation to... Can you really have an obligation to something or someone who doesn't exist? Maybe. This needs to be hooked up. It seems that we want a strong, simultaneously link between duties and rights. This seems to sever that connection in some way, to say that a duty can exist where a right doesn't. Unless, you want to sever the rights-holder from the right itself in a stronger way, and then that might also work. 


public/private reasons, about taking someone elses reasons as being normative for us. 

negative and not a positive agreement with humanity....unless everyone...tries to further the ends of others (KANT) - 39.

To treat someone as an end, we have to treat their ends as our ends also. We must accomodate, as far as it is possible, someone else's ends. 

How does this play out in the context of the personal identity through time? What is it that the young couple/agreement are doing? What is the public/private reasoning going on here. 



May 3

Private reasons
Public reasons
Shared deliberation
Shared Good

Shared interaction and deliberation relies upon public reason to link together to people.

Your private reason, at least in the form of a question, can have normative force, only ofr you. Public reason, however, can have normative force for many people. That is what it means to say that it is public reason. Public reasons are objective (agent neutral, agent relative).every

There (Sark) seems to be a middle territory between public and private reasons. Cricket example. Not everyone will use it as a reason. 

The self in the present is fighting the future self. This is odd. He seems unified on both ends. Unification through time. Is he really not interacting with his wife? 

It seems that she wants to cheat like I do. She wants personal identity, consistency, stabilityt hrough time for the "I". Only agents who do that are actually that. But, if you change too much, then it seems you aren't unified. 

There is a 'present' unfication.
There is a timeA-timeB unification.

Reasons must be compatible for there to be interaction.

Private reasons are like particularistic willing.

It seems very dificult to show why there are different unifications. Particularly, I don't see how we can switch between different contingent practical identities. If we lose one set of practical identities for another, and we can be 'unified' in the present with both, but we can't be unified from timeA-timeB, then are we really unified?

Why should one contingent practical identity be given precedence over all the others? It seems that is what she is really wanting to have.


May 5

Kors says that if you argue that 'if you can pick and choose who you will interact with', then you have to be able to choose how you will pick and choose how you will interact with yourself. 

Interacting with himself (the younger with the older) is the precondition to be able to interact with others.

Young is treating older as an ally, and thus not as an end in himself. A means to an end. 

Pathological love is something you can't command - pg 13 (Groundwork) - it seems, for Kant, that you really do choose to have love.
I
Don't you want to say that person time-t0, with contingent practical identities x-z, is a different 'person' a different 'agent' than the future being, time-t1, with contingent practical identities a-b (and not x-z). 

Can you show respect for someone without taking their reasons for yourself? If not, it seems that for the younger man to show respect for the older, then he must respect the reasons of the older.

203- He makes a law for himself that he will be a socialist, even though he thinks full well that he won't agree to this in the future. The reason he is proposing to act on now has normative standing (it can universally applied>?). If that is the only way in which it is normative, then he isnt' really respecting the older persons reasons. If the older person is his own set of values and identity, then we need to respect it, right? How can the younger honestly thinkt he older is irrational? What counts as irrational? 

t0--------------------------tn

A set of values at t0 - v1
A set of values at tn - v2

The younger nobleman, can regard his reasons, v1, as normative, provided it can be universalized to include the guy at tn too. Except when he says that he will be irrational at some point. Instead of treating tn-guy as being irrational, if that guy has normative reasons as well, then her contention does not hold, because the normative reasons can't be universalized, it seems that they can be changed.

pg 202, how will t0 see that there is a 'good reason to change it' at tn. That is part of the exception clause.

I can agree to persistence of personal identity, of the ontological object we call an agent. But, strictly because I don't hink you can give up your agency, it is just one of your necessary attributes. I can't agree to a unification through time. 


Last chapter

Are values entirely reducible to desires? It seems that there would be no objective values then (this is a subjective account). Values which are independent of desires have an objectivity to them. 

Sark:

(1) Value- Desire-relative (subjective account of values)
(2) Value- Desire-neutral  (objective account)

There is a difference between human 'creation' of value, and the human 'recognition' of value. It may be the case that only humans have values, but the original of the value is different from the possession of them.

We dont' create the value of the rational nature, however. The rational nature, acc. to Kant/Sark, is an end in itself - objectively@!
