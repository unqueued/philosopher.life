!! Audit:

* First, it's clear that I have far more time to even write this list up this month.
** Second, it has been instrumental in making sure that I do not waste my precious "free time" off of work. I've been quite productive with it.
* Eh, strikethroughs. I'm not ready for them yet.
* It would behoove me to articulate quantified goals rather than nebulous ones.
* This is the first time I've really even made this a habit.
* I did a good job of accomplishing what I set out to do.
** I need to make sure I set out to do stuff that I really should do, to the degree I need to do it, and so on.
* I nixed //The Nix//
* I develop new routines and monotonies.
* I like that I talk about sex, sleep, food, work, small things, socializing, errands and other drugs/play. This is an interesting mix.
