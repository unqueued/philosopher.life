title: 2018.08.06 -- Computer Musings: VMWare

Fucking keys. I'm a skiddie. I literally trust the AUR implicitly. It is pretty uncommon for me to read, let alone edit the packaging (although, it does happen). 

`gpg --recv-keys C52048C0C0748FEE227D47A2702353E0F7E48EDB1`

The fact is that VMWare is very performant. I require performance at times.

Had to uninstall. I accidentally installed 12 (specifying it) instead of 14. Silly goose.

Freenode is now scanning users for vulnerabilities. Hmm.. Sent me down a quick rabbithole.

Desperately trying to get custom shortcuts in Firefox to work through an extension.

I've been reading the Tiddlywiki-dev forum more. In fact, this firefox browser has now become my Tiddlywiki browser; it's where I keep the [[h0p3]] identity compartmentalized/containerized in some respects.

Fuck Firefox. i3 time...took a script to use xdotools correctly...tough titties. [[ff_url_copy.xsh]]...Some bitchiness to deal with on this front as well.
