title: 2018.09.05 - Deep Reading: Introducing Aristotle

Whoa, slow down, bucko. You can't deliver induction to us like this. And, you move so fast that when you paint Aristotle as an empiricist you've really failed to capture the elegance (and primacy) of his primary propositions effectively. He's right. You agree Hegel can be seen as working towards completing Aristotle's project. The induction and the acquisition of nous, the foundation problems at the beginning and end of time, metaphysics itself, is where his empiricism takes us. Aristotle's a boss, and you aren't painting it well enough.
