*** They pulled this shit in Louisiana too. Fuck that bullshit. I've seen multiple kinds of suppression tactics this year. I am truly disturbed.

*** So kindly said, and it lacks the justification and explanatory powers I demand. That said, this is only one step towards exiting the cave. You're jumping from own psychopathic ecosystem to perhaps a slightly less psychopathic ecosystem. You have more ecosystems hops to make than you realize.

* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://theoutline.com/post/2596/when-news-breaks-google-still-can-t-separate-rumor-from-fact
*** While I expect not to be manipulated by Google, I don't think I can expect them to have perfect algorithms. This is where human epistemology practices become our responsibility, not Google's. And, I say that as someone who profoundly fucking hates Google.

* Think About It
