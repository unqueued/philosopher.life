!! Audit:

* This was the first month in which I've consistently taken DCK every week. 
* My meditations are clearer and more developed this month than they ever have been.
* It is clear I've spent more time reflecting upon them.
* While DCK seems to even me out and offer serious moments of reflection, I'm not sure what counts as my next stage of progress with it. It certainly provides me with ample opportunities to think and make progress on its own, but I'm wondering how to improve the process itself. 
* DCK Meditations often seem to set the tone for the week.
* I feel less hindered and more open in them than I otherwise would.
