title: 2019.03.27 - Prompted Introspection: Stranger Foods

!! Tell about the strangest food you have ever eaten.

Food to whom? Strangest to whom? What counts as eaten? Half the shit I eat isn't even good for my body; it's a drug. I've ingested plenty of objects which have calories, minerals, and fiber which aren't normally considered food that could be considered food. How many kinds of bugs have I swallowed accidentally, let alone on purpose?  Fried crickets in soy sauce are like popcorn. My cum verifiably tastes better after eating pineapple. Does toothpaste count as food? How about tree bark, dirt, foil, plastic, chalk, paper, my wife's fingernails and breastmilk? You know, it's good for kids to eat their own boogers, right? Think about how many humans ingest dog slobber on the reg? Some kinds of things I taste and consume are for novelty or non-digestive reasons. I'm an animal who sometimes explores the world through his mouth.

I've eaten my words too. Dialectically, I think of my conversations as soundwaves or digits which echo around the mediums and with [[others]] around me; I receive feedback that morphs who I am. Consumption and taking inputs to my various bioware and computing systems is how I locate myself in the world, sculpt, and discover. Smith is right: I am a virus.
