title: 2019.09.23 - Afterschool Teaching: Prisoners Talk

I walked in and saw a random child, 8J2m (I will not forget your name, brother), sitting there next to VPParker's office. I axed him how he was doing. He's sat in the hall all day and was been suspended for another two for telling a joke about President Trump last Friday. He was, of course, right. We talked for quite a while about the value of free speech, codeswitching, the nature of his prison (his eyes lit up), and the meaning of education (oh, he was surprised about that part [surely I would conflate and hate education with this institution as my example too, and yes you will need scientific notation, homie], and I'm glad I could point him in the right direction). He comes from a rough background, and his parents are too poor to fight back on this one. We talked about the repercussions he may suffer here, and I spoke with him about his book. We talked about the fact that I cannot say what I think either. He seemed to have a reasonable attitude about what was in his control. Read with everything you have in you, son of mine.

Whitney was late again, but she did her half of the prep. She was somber. She was sick yesterday. Something is spreading. She left within 30 minutes again.

My high schoolers talked with me about their classes. They seem to be doing well enough, but they seem drained (understandably). 

One-on-ones flew by. I assumed I would be pressured for time again, so I came out of the gate fast. Everything seemed kosher to me. There's a lot of homework for my younger students. My prediction was correct, Delp is now cutting my time in half here (proud of it too). It's interesting to see him change something which he's held to be standard for years for this. Yessir, I am speaking with them, and if crowd control is what you are after, then stand out here with us instead of sitting on your ass in the office climbing social ladders, looking at pictures of the house you pay your exploited labor to flip, and playing on your phone. 

The library was reasonable enough. Plenty of students had the opportunity to sit with mean old Mr. h0p3. Homework got finished (some extra was assigned), there was some reading, people cleaned their instruments (I had to help 6CM with his clarinet), and we had a ton of board games. Delp is unhappy about anyone sitting on the couch, so we avoided it. Access to our technology, however, I enabled and hid from the adults as best I could. My children and I continue to think about this together. I voice explanations of risk and plausible deniability while making fun of bullshit.

6KM scratched 6CM's belly. Unjustified violence already crosses my line, but I'm livid to see 6CM hurt. He has been blameless before [[The Moral Law]] every step of the way so far.

My namesake said this place is a cruel jailhouse, she is trapped here. You aren't wrong, child. I want to scream.

8HM and I talked about her honor's work (though they do not call it that) and the book she finished this weekend. 

8Jm and I talked about his father's work and drug rehab. It was fascinating to see 6JR and 8Jm speak about their cultural differences, a country boy and a hoodrat figuring it out together. 

We talked about the etymology and shades of meaning in swearwords. I continue to talk about codeswitching, growing up and breaking rules, etc. I have no idea if I am of use to my children. 

I continue to preach the word of safe sex to my active students. You can't get in trouble with me or hear a negative word from me for talking about sex (unless you disrespect a person, including yourself). I thought I was going to have to intervene on students who obviously felt the urge to slut-shame 7CM who decided to go over-the-top provocative today (she dropped in just to pick up her sister), but they did not disrespect her and they had a right to voice their opinion in the manner in which they did. 

My geek squad were disappointed that I took everyone to the gym today (me 2). 5DB2 especially, and we talked a lot about it. I feel terrible for the boy. I totally get it, homie. We listened to music, talked, and read while watching the other humans play. My children did a fine job DJing for us (my high schoolers had to give me the double take because these songs are explicit and will make you a bad person if you listen to them at all). Many danced and sang. I walked around and talked with my peeps. I am the annoying old man who looks at you and tells you to get something to drink if he thinks you look like you are overheating. My geek squad got some good reading in. Rock on.

I had an incident with 6KM who got hit the face with a basketball. It was an accident that she was responsible for avoiding, but she was shook by the fact that 8Am said she deserved it. I did my best to comfort her, and we found a way to get back into having fun.

5DB2 breaks my heart, 6JR too. Both want computers so badly. Their parents don't value it.
