title: McManus: Who is Afraid of Cultural Marxism: What the Frankfurt School Can Still Teach Us

<<<
the essential contribution of Western Marxism was to move Marx’s theory away from its scientific and economistic pretensions, and more in the direction of philosophy and cultural analysis
<<<

I'm fine with this move, at least temporarily. It seems that an analysis of the metaethical foundations designed to support dark-triadicism in pro-Capitalist is necessary. In fact, that's where I intend to go in [[T42T]]. I think theory has to be put into practice though. I'm not okay with mere cultural analysis as description; I think we're forced to give prescriptions. It turns out that prescription requires that metaethical foundation, but applied ethics is definitely necessary.

<<<
They felt that within modernity, rationalism had become flattened and instrumentalized, blunting its power and critical edge
<<<

Preach. Rationalism which doesn't point to the structure, nature, and telic unity of [[The Good]] is barren flatness which lacks all salience. It becomes a tool to say whatever you want it to say.

<<<
Despite adopting this subjectivist position, Kant still argued that we should orient our will to act in conformity with the moral law because God would reward use for doing so. 
<<<

I cannot abide by that subjectivism. I really do aim for transcendental realism. I seek the eternal, infinite, transcendent externality (however impossible it may be).

<<<
Individuals saw themselves as capable of doing anything, yet bound by nothing. The consequence of this was the gradual emergence of a capitalist society which was designed to cater to the private pleasures and desires of such flattened individuals. The instrumental pursuit of each person’s private self-interest became the highest goal we could aspire to.
<<<

A gorgeous claim. 

Flattening is an important concept to me. I'm not sure your claim is accurate. It seems to me that [[The Original Position]] attempts to flatten each of us and force an emergence from the collective. I visualize it the other way. I think subjectivism, egoism, etc. actually results in unflattened individuals competing against each other rather than cooperating. 

I have likely misunderstood what you mean, though I obviously agree to the gist (even if not the metaphysics and metaethics at stake here).

<<<
Since the pursuit of pleasure was now the highest goal, forms of art and entertainment which projected different ideals than just getting the girl or making one’s millions became increasingly abstract and unprofitable.  Moreover, the culture industry also increasingly turned politics itself into a form of entertainment 
<<<

Preach.

I love to see a Marxist moral realism. Marxists, in focusing so heavily on the material, often fail to give an effective account of the metaphysics necessary for intrinsic value. I cannot abide by the destruction of metaphysics. I'm glad to see your defense. Not enough people seem aware of it.
