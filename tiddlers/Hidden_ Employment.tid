!! About:

//Obstacles can be stepping stones or stumbling blocks.//

If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep [through theft or inheritance], you will work until you die.

--Warren Buffet

Money is useful. I'm nowhere near the diminishing marginal utility rate of income, let alone possessing the wealth to passively maintain that rate.<<ref "1">> I need to embrace the love of money wisely, to set aside footgun ascetic approaches,<<ref "2">> and to empathically seek wealth for the sake of eudaimonia.<<ref "3">>

Employment is a game I must play. Currently, I'm playing with the profound handicap of the [[The Categorical Imperative]] against a psychopathic playerbase.<<ref "4">> I desperately want to keep my Golden Rule Gloves on in order to preserve my integrity. 

It's time to fight! I might not win, and it might not be up to me. Like any game, I can only do my fallible best given the mechanics and circumstances in which I find myself. I want to be proud of how I played the game, especially because I despise both the nature of the players and the unfairness of the game.

I must always be aware of the distinction between my justified expectations of entitlement, of what we morally owe to all persons, and my justified predictions of how humans in the world actually think and behave.<<ref "5">> It is a toxic dog-eat-dog world, even if it ought not be. I will pursue my idealism despite the hyperreality induced insanity of everyone around me.

I'm an autistic savant with a unique reality map radically incompatible with almost everyone else's, especially those in power. I do not take my employer's ends to be my ends, and vice versa. This does not benefit me given the asymmetry in the power dynamic and my handicap. Employers exist to use their employees as mere means. Essentially, my professional life is complicated by the fact that I both avoid being exploited and refrain from participating in the exploitation of others. Few fare well in late stage capitalism, especially those with a conscience.

From a meritocratic standpoint, I often deserve to be hired. I am extremely capable. The market, however, is irrational because it can never be disentangled from politics and human bias. The market is not a meritocracy because success in the market has far more to do with your initial circumstances and dark-triadic manipulation skills than your functional potential or competency in the labor position itself.<<ref "6">>

Problematically, I don't know why psychopathic employers would hire me, and once they understand who I am, I don't know why they would keep me. As a matter of dyadic meta-accuracy, I believe in their eyes, at best, I'm unpredictable or unwilling to allow them to exploit me to the absurd extent they feel entitled, and at worst, I am a danger to their existence or way of life. Also, I disgust them, I stick out like a sore thumb, and they take pleasure in punishing deviation from the norm unless it is exploitable. They will not accept someone who challenges their reality map, motivations, methodologies, or their bottomline. It's not a matter of reasoning or compromising with these people; they are fundamentally vicious.

Unfortunately (in a sense), I'm not a talented deceiver; socially-unacceptable honesty is hard-coded into who I am. I'm reduced to playing checkers when I have to form effective deceptions because I lack the gutteral abilities to affectively form accurate theories of minds on the fly.<<ref "7">> My virtualization of their minds is slow, and thus I cannot inject deceptive memeplexes into individuals (let alone organizations) with any significant depth. My potent opinions about the truth is all I have, but that is not what employers want. Unfortunately, I cannot hide it, even if I have a right to.

The adversarial relationship between employers and employees justifies Just War Theoretic deception as a pre-emptive strike.<<ref "8">> Sadly, my social talents are simply too limited to safely operate in sophisticated warzones. Not only cannot I hide who I am, I also cannot maintain //false// professional relationships or psychopathically-based "trust" games. I can't win, thus it is time to Kobayashi Maru this bitch. I must engage in guerrilla tactics and strategies. I must find the cracks in the system to survive and thrive. It is my experience that game winners bend or breaks the mechanics of the games; they don't play by the rules. I need to how best to apply that fact.

My goal is to find moral methods of earning money which require limited human interaction. Insofar as I can extract or play around the social elements of the employment game, I have the freedom to excel. This is the puzzle. There are endless paths before me, almost all of them evil, some of them I am incapable of walking due to my autism, and I must search for the righteous and practical path for my character.

I need to confidently take more risks, enthusiastically stand back up when I fall, boldly escape my procrasturbator perfectionist tendencies, and constantly build my own opportunities. I play this lifewiki game hard, and now it's time to play the money game hard as well.

!! Dreams:

* Make it easier to modify my resume on the fly. I can build cover letters very quickly in a sense, but the resume is such a pain to edit.
* Find any source of income to stabilize our savings. From there, be yourself on the job interview. Find a place where you get to do and say exactly what you think. You aren't going to be happy otherwise.
* I want to be my own boss, to have flexibility, and to generate income passively.

<<footnotes "2" "The saying 'Money is the root of all evil' must be unpacked carefully. //Power// rather than mere //money// is more accurate. But, even the claim 'Power is the root of all evil' is not correct, even though it houses a kernel of truth. Power is a two-edged blade; it is the root of both good and evil. Thus, one should not eschew power, but instead the use of it for evil.">>
