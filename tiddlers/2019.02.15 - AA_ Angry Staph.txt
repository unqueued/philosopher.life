How's it going?
FRI 4:17 PM
Itâ€™s good â€”had a high school field trip today I was in charge of organizing and it went pretty well. Two hours at the trampoline park and them Gattiâ€™s pizza buffet!
FRI 5:02 PM
That sounds amazing.
FRI 5:02 PM
Only two very minor injuries and everything was good at the pizza place. The kids did so well
FRI 5:03 PM
One kid bounced weirdly and smacked his nose with his knee. (That may have hospitalized me because I donâ€™t bend like that :grinning_face_with_one_large_and_one_small_eye:)
FRI 5:04 PM
And the other was a girl that twisted her ankle on the way out â€”seriously we were loading the bus :woman-facepalming:
FRI 5:05 PM
How has your day been? Do you have Monday off?
FRI 5:06 PM
Lol. You have me trying to touch my nose to me knee. I've been stretching everyday for a while now...yeah, I think I would be hospitalized too.
FRI 5:09 PM
Two minor injuries sounds worth.
FRI 5:09 PM
Uh, I don't know if I have Monday off. I need to find out.
FRI 5:09 PM
I'm going to bet "no" because of all the snowdays.
FRI 5:09 PM
My day has been good. Reading and writing with the kiddos.
FRI 5:10 PM
At 18 maybe I could but now no way does my nose get there
FRI 5:10 PM
We have it off but county schools are using it as a make up day ([[UJ]] is grumbling)
FRI 5:10 PM
hehe
FRI 5:11 PM
ðŸ¥°
FRI 5:11 PM
Trying to decide what sounds good for dinner. (Still warm and cozy in my nap blankie)
FRI 5:12 PM
Fried Chicken, Hawtsawce, Beer, and Show!
FRI 5:13 PM
Oooooo
FRI 5:13 PM
(that is not what we're having...I'm dreaming)
FRI 5:14 PM
I was thinking :rooster: fried :rice:
FRI 5:14 PM
That sounds good. I think we're doing the stirfry thing tonight too. I believe the fish is thawed. [[k0sh3k]]'s not as much a fan of fish as I am.
FRI 5:15 PM
:takeout_box::chopsticks::fortune_cookie:
FRI 5:15 PM
Yeah [[UJ]] loves fish â€”[[L]] is his fish buddy cause I donâ€™t like it and [[AG]] only likes it battered and fried
FRI 5:16 PM
Omg. That's what I want.
FRI 5:18 PM
Captain D's
FRI 5:18 PM
Forget the chikin
FRI 5:18 PM
Texting [[UJ]] to see what he wants... I could get up but I am warm â€”so lazy hehe
FRI 5:18 PM
I don't understand why I only ever see geriatrics at Captain D's.
FRI 5:18 PM
You'd think it would be opposite right? It's supposed to kill you.
FRI 5:19 PM
True true!
FRI 5:19 PM
Texting someone in the next room is fun. =)
FRI 5:19 PM
It's weird: we DM all the time even 4 feet away from each other...but usually passing links, reminders, memes, or whatever.
FRI 5:20 PM
Yeah [[UJ]] and I have done that playing WoW and such
FRI 5:22 PM
He has a staph infection on his knee â€”it looks :rage: angry. He went to the Dr today. Hopefully the meds kick in so he will stop hobbling around.
FRI 5:24 PM
Maybe we do one of those huge zit popping videos that are gross but you canâ€™t stop watching!
FRI 5:24 PM
Lol, gross!
FRI 5:24 PM
I can't watch them.
FRI 5:24 PM
:face_with_open_mouth_vomiting:
FRI 5:24 PM
I wish I was that cool, but as I get older...I have to look away.
FRI 5:25 PM
Same for the ones where insects embedded in their flesh worm their way out.
FRI 5:25 PM
Yeah canâ€™t do the insect ones
FRI 5:25 PM
50 degrees yesterday and now itâ€™s snowingâ€”Woot Kentucky
FRI 5:34 PM
