How's your past couple weeks been?
THU 1:48 PM
Doing good —healed well and convinced Gpa to have his surgery I think . Painting and playing FF with [[L]]
THU 1:49 PM
How are you doing?
THU 1:49 PM
Yay. I'm glad to hear you've healed up well. Sounds like a solid mix of work and fun for you.
THU 1:50 PM
I'm doing well. Grinding away on the wiki and school.
THU 1:50 PM
My two classes are done...at least until the fall. Book store closed last Friday so I am lazy and slowly working on the house
THU 1:52 PM
How’s the kidlets?
THU 1:52 PM
They are having a fine summer. They've been doing well in school, and I'm grateful. Been a fast-paced grind for us all.
THU 1:58 PM
How are [[UJ]] and [[AG]] doing?
THU 1:58 PM
You can see a solid portion of what they are up to here: http://j3d1h.philosopher.life

THU 2:07 PM
What will be your next classes in the Fall?
THU 2:16 PM
Two more math classes —I have to look up their names
THU 2:16 PM
[[UJ]] is struggling to get interviews for Asst Principal or Principal :confused: —they look at music teacher and don’t give him a chance
THU 2:17 PM
=/
THU 2:17 PM
[[AG]] needs some motivation :blush: but otherwise is ok
THU 2:18 PM
I don't think they value the humanities nearly enough. They often want coaches too. I think orchestration/conducting music is just as difficult as getting kids to play sportsball (maybe even harder because he doesn't always get students who want to be there).
THU 2:19 PM
Once he gets his foot in the door, I assume it will be a much easier climb for him.
THU 2:21 PM
Some of the principles and assistant principles I've met had to be teachers for decades.
THU 2:21 PM
A lot of them are old, unlike [[UJ]].
THU 2:22 PM
Algebraic Reasoning and Number Concepts/Number Theory
THU 2:22 PM
I am envious of that latter.
THU 2:22 PM
Your degree sounds like a treat (hard work, but fun)
THU 2:23 PM
Yeah and he is able to deal with issues without getting his feelings involved
THU 2:23 PM
Yeah I have enjoyed it so far
THU 2:23 PM
He is good with the kids —he was a poor kid from a broken home too
THU 2:24 PM
He knows what it do.
THU 2:24 PM
Yeah
THU 2:24 PM

THU 2:24 PM
This is our lap dog
THU 2:24 PM
I see that, lol.
THU 2:25 PM
What a beast!
THU 2:25 PM
She is sweet and still a puppy but has no idea how big she is
THU 2:25 PM
She was trying to fit on the loveseat between Jer and I
THU 2:25 PM
Uh, is that dog going to get bigger?
THU 2:25 PM
Maybe?
THU 2:25 PM
Gonna be a horse.
THU 2:26 PM
She’s just 13 months
THU 2:26 PM
Have you heard recently from [[AIR]]? Looks like maybe he moved jobs?
THU 2:27 PM
I don't know what his new job is. I've not heard from him.
THU 2:27 PM
He asked me back in May? Which hospital he was born in —but I didn’t know
THU 2:29 PM
I don't remember which one either. I remember visiting him the day after his birth in the hospital, but I don't see which hospital.
THU 2:29 PM
I assume he needs his birth records.
THU 2:30 PM
Yeah —I told him I could ask but he said no
THU 2:30 PM
You can order your birth certificate from Frankfort online
THU 2:31 PM
Times are a changing. I had to go in person for [[1uxb0x]]'s (though it was rushed to get his for the passport).
THU 2:32 PM
Right —I ordered [[AG]]’s and also got an official marriage license
THU 2:33 PM
Not sure how to get [[L]]’s actually—her birth certificate would be Indiana but her name change is in Kentucky
THU 2:34 PM
:woman-shrugging:
THU 2:35 PM
Sometimes they don't change the birth certificates for name changes, if I understand correctly. You might have to petition for that in some cases.
THU 2:36 PM
I don't know how it works. That is above my paygrade.
THU 2:36 PM
Yeah —so far I have just used her original and the name change paperwork
THU 2:37 PM
I guess it is her issue now and she hasn’t needed it?
THU 2:37 PM
The only thing I needed it for was insurance—to prove she was a dependent
THU 2:38 PM
