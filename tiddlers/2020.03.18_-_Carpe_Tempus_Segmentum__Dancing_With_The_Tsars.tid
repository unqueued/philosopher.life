title: 2020.03.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Dancing With The Tsars

* Woke at 11
** Groggy, actually. Hrm.
* [[Morning Routine]]
** Feeling the heat on [[Fitness Routine]] now that I'm back to some weight resistance. Knee aint perfect, but it's good enough to do something.
* My offspring did a poor job. =(.
** Shit got real.
* Dialecture
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
** Some difficult parts, but I'm glad we did it.
* Dialectures
* Offspring read [[The Lightning Thief]] and did their own work.
** Let's see.
* We spent more time thinking about [[k0sh3k]] working from home. She poses quite a model for us to inspect. 
** Helped my wife think about setting up more remote communications tooling. They don't even have IM in the office.
** My wife is beautifully competent.
* Addresses reset, Paypal drained, and my wife is hunting for care.
** We are very lucky to have access to the healthcare we have. It is absurd.
* Debugging RSS script with [[j3d1h]].
* My son has some computer problems to fix. Snowballing into other problems.
* //1984// down, they have it on their phones. They cover ground, regardless of writing. I'll take it.
** Not my preference, but I'm doing a shit job myself. No room to talk there. =)
* Wife and I went on a walk
** It felt off. Am I off, is the world off, or both? The anxiety is electric, hair-raising.
** Picked up notebooks and pencils. Nobody could produce an extra notebook today (not even me).
*** A girl my daughter's age was with her mother. I saw pain and fear in both.
** Stores are closing much earlier.
** You could feel the tension in the atmosphere everywhere. More cops, a loudness and bravado as protective behavior, darting eyes, paranoic behavior, masks and gloves, aggressive stances.
*** Nobody was hungry from what I could tell, and I did not see any homeless today (though, on average, folks seemed poorer). Unpredicted. 
**** What am I missing?
*** An elderly woman held my eyes and solemnly nodded outside the W-entity.
*** Perhaps it is only my delusional eyes.
*** Even met a handler who told me to be careful as I was speaking with the handled. He was jumpy.
*** The dollar store clerk explained how it's worse than Christmas. People are exceptionally mean to her lately. She laughed with us, but she's in trouble.
** I continue to believe times are going to get much tougher. I don't know how people are going to pay rent and buy food.
*** A 20% jump in unemployment (not including underemployment) would put us at ~45%. Most people can't cover a month. The elite are going to sacrifice the poor even further.
**** Not all schools paying to support their students. Not all schools are providing meals.
***** Mutual aid will not be enough. 
***** Ought we carry survival care packages with us? Even drops would work. Anonymous.
*** My wife is shaking. We had to stop walking right before we could enter our home. I hate that my opinion and feeling causes her to shake. I desperately don't want to be right about this. I hope I cannot trust my feelings. 
**** I hope a year from now I can look back and laugh at my stupidity. 
**** Even my brother has asked me if I have one of those feelings. Yeah. Fuck.
*** The election is slipping again.
*** My reading is terrifying. I don't just hate it; I'm actually scared.
* Chili
** My wife cooked for us. Delicious.
* [[MTG]] with [[j3d1h]]
** Her Affinity vs MUC, +2 turns my favor. No explosion, O-Stone, Shackles, hardlock clinic. 
*** She could tell the story. Good!
** Her Affinity vs Dredge. She did not understand what was the most powerful card in my deck, thus she did not know the most powerful card in hers. 
*** Lots of theory discussed to explain the story.
* [[vidyas]]: Sapolsky and more game theory
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 3
