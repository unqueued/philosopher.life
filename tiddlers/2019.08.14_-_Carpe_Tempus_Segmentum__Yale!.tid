title: 2019.08.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Yale!

* Woke at 9:30
** Crazy dream. My offspring got into a row over trying to achieve equal amounts of beverage in their classes. It was obviously imbalanced, and they drove me insane. I sipped some out of the fuller glass and spit it into the emptier in frustration.
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
* Dialecture
* Yale asked for my wife's references! Uh, did we just make the cut to the final round? I think so.
** We kinda freaked out, lol. This is awesome.
* LOTR
* Read+Write
* Worked on training for work.
* Work
* Beer run with wife. Talked.
* Ribs, baked fries (my daughter has a new method for coating them in seasoning), salad.
* WoW
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
** I b0rked it. Maybe 50 uses for $10. That is acceptable.
** Order another one, and a different that reminds me of my old favorite. 
* Sleep by 3
