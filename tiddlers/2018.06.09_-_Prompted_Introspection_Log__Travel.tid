title: 2018.06.09 - Prompted Introspection Log: Travel

!! Where would you travel, if you could go anywhere?

Melisandre, I would likely head to a place that allows me to shift balances of power in our lives (there are numerous possibilities here). 
I would love to stand on Everest or see the extremophiles living in the ocean's depths. The obvious choice is obvious though: I'd take a spacewalk. There would be nothing else like it.
