How was your weekend?
Feb 23 5:45pm
Good so far ‚Äîslept most of Saturday, got to play with [[L]] and Koby and now to actually do the paper I have been putting off
Feb 23 7:02pm
How are you?
Feb 23 7:02pm
Sounds like a good one.
Feb 23 7:11pm
Super chill.
Feb 23 7:11pm
I wish you luck on the paper too.
Feb 23 7:11pm
I'm doing well. Feeling good and functional. Climbing again with offspring, so I am happy about that.
Feb 23 7:12pm
Oh good
Feb 23 7:12pm
I am struggling with the pit lately ‚Äîcan‚Äôt seem to get anything done
Feb 23 7:12pm
=/. Yup, I know that feel. I'm sorry.
Feb 23 7:13pm
No problem‚Äîthink losing Mary is sucking me in
Feb 23 7:13pm
Sometimes, I think the pits are many pits, climb out of one to see I'm in a bigger one or a sequence of them.
Feb 23 7:13pm
I agree
Feb 23 7:14pm
Every one of them has a different monster than the last
Feb 23 7:14pm
I can appreciate that. I assume it takes a long time to deal with loss of that magnitude. Lots of energy necessary to think about who they were and who we are.
Feb 23 7:14pm
Yep but I still need to function‚Äîand I am but just barely ‚Äînot giving up
Feb 23 7:15pm
Reminds me of that some video games which are heavily boss-oriented, and the point of the games is practically the bosses themselves. Have to learn the new choreographed dance to beat the mob, sometimes.
Feb 23 7:16pm
I am glad you are not giving up.
Feb 23 7:16pm
Yep gotta dance the dance üòä
Feb 23 7:16pm
I hope in time, the dance will be easier to do and that you'll feel better. Pit is worst.
Feb 23 7:17pm
Yeah but sometimes its part of life ‚Äîwill be ok
Feb 23 7:17pm
We have been through many pits. We can do it again.
Feb 23 7:18pm
Lucky for me ‚Äî[[UJ]] is understanding
Feb 23 7:18pm
Yes. Very important.
Feb 23 7:18pm
Yep yep ‚ùÑÔ∏è I need a snow day again
Feb 23 7:18pm
Anytime now /pray
Feb 23 7:18pm
We have good partners
Feb 23 7:18pm
Had the best anniversary ever yesterday.
Feb 23 7:18pm
Ooooo happy anniversary!
