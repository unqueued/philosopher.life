!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
I've had enough of someone else's propaganda. I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against. I'm a human being first and foremost, and as such I am for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole.
<<<

I'm stunned. It is rare that I do not correct someone's sentences. Of course, I have some questions, like:

* Why not "propaganda" in general? 
** Or, how do you define it?
* You don't just mean truth, but [[salient]] truth, right?
* You mean "person" not merely homo sapiens, and you mean [[Humanity]], right?

I suggest he answers the questions correctly. The odds are wildly against him not being able to sort these out with me. MX > MLK in too many arenas, particularly those recognized as arenas. It's so broad, everyone thinks they can agree to it, and that is the sign of virtuous circularity. I suggest this is not more memetically viral simply because of who said it, and that's ironic given the claim.
