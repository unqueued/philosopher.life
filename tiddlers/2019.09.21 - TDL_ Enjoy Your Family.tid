title: 2019.09.21 - TDL: Enjoy Your Family

* Family Time!
* Okay, I have no idea what we will eat. We keep changing our minds. We have a decent amount of food in the house, so maybe we should just exercise that freedom? 
* You know, naps have been kicking serious ass. It's cash money or the spiral into depression. What could go wrong? =)
* Bathrooms should be cleaned. They aren't trainwrecks, but better safe than sorry.
* Lemme guess: you are going to play WoW. What prize do I win?
* Well, write what can. 
* You've been itching for background esque youtubes and podcasts. Maybe find a way to improve it.
** It's weird that listening to randos in Discord has been not boring for you.
