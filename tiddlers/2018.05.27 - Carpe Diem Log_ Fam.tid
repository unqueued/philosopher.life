* Woke at 9ish?
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Talked to JRE
** The conversation went poorly. It is clear that he actively avoids talking about the wiki. Does he think I find most of his life interesting? Only insofar as I elect to. I actually think he's wasting it, and he's not even good at using his drugs. I'm still supportive of his vision of himself and what matters to him, even when I think he is wrong. I do my best. I'm sure he must feel the same way. It sucks since it feels like the harbinger.
* Called Charlie
* Bliss
* Family Time!
** Went fairly easily. In part, I did my best to say positive things. I think may have helped.
* Salmon Stir Fry
* Beer
* Watched
* Read+Write
* D2 HC mode for a teensy bit
