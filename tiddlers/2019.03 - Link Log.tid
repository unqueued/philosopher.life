!! Audit:

* Feels like way more than usual.
* The Youtubes infects this log. 
** I feel unclean.
* that ":=" is going to be a pain in the butt for parsing sometimes, possibly, maybe.
* [[kicks]] has provided few or no direct signals. That's up to him.
* Everyone reads the maymays. It's high [[S2NR]] for the family. It's also my least favorite section (despite the high count).
* I'm surprised by how rarely I need to have overlap. Folders rather than tags work here.
* I talk to people who aren't going to listen all the time.
** What else can I do?
* It's a beautiful hate machine, lol.
* There are some huge dumps in here.
* This was a productive month.
