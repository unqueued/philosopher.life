title: 2014.03.26 - Dignity and Respect: Respect for the Environment

Hill is a breath of fresh air to read. If hip-hop artists read philosophy papers, they’d say he has “flow.” Admittedly, I fear Hill has opened 10 Cans of Worms, piling sets of problems on top of other sets of problems, and has resolved very little. He seems aware of it too. That may be okay though. For example, the relationship between the Good and Right (and the Beautiful, if that is any different from the Good) is a timeless, crazy hard problem. I take Hill not to be saying “this is certainly correct,” but rather offering us his honed intuition on the matter, beckoning us to look and see if we see what he sees. Traditionally, that is a bad argument style, but sometimes that is the best one can do.

    The appreciation of the good immediately rang alarms in me as being a kind of appraisal respect to me (which is not a good sign for this theory). It may be relevantly different though.

    If values do not preexist the human world, how are they “not simply things we create or mere reflects of our subjective tastes?” He rails against this false dichotomy, but I don’t really get his argument. I fear we are engaging in the internalist/externalist debate in virtue ethics.

    His claim that ‘there seems something missing in those who ignore, dismiss, or remain indifferent to the things that are sources of joy, inspiration, and value to others, and potentially for themselves’ seems problematic. This sounds like a means argument. Why is this a “for its own sake” argument?

    He claims not respecting nature is a systematic lack of appreciate is a defect of character. Why? That isn’t necessarily true. The reason some people dismiss nature may have to do with lacking a proper education, and sometimes that isn’t their fault. They weren’t habituated correctly, and thus they lack the correct beliefs and attitudes. Sometimes the ideal beliefs and attitudes aren’t available to them. They have no reasons to have them. Why would I hold them responsible for that? How can this be a duty of theirs?

    This seems to talk about what the ideal human is like, but isn’t ethics mostly concerned about being a good moral agent rather than good human? Granted, omniscient moral agents are more ideal than limited and finite moral agents, but there is an ideal for each context, right?

    One of the many things I don’t like about so many virtue theories is that what the virtuous agent would do is so ideal that I definitionally have no access to making the choices he makes, for the reasons he makes, with the attitudes he makes, in the way he makes them. I can’t really do what is right, and no one else can either. That is not an accurate portrayal of the moral lives we have or can have. Moral life is about doing the best you can with what you have, and virtue theory fails to appreciate that fact. Virtue ethics fails to be agent-context-sensitive. I don’t blame my children for not understanding complex moral problems, and similarly I shouldn’t be blamed for not understanding really complex more problems. The language of Virtue ethics is a beautiful song of the sirens, beware!

    He claims the most controversial issue is whether or not the virtue of appreciating the good has any special application to our attitudes about the natural environment. I happen to think all the dirty work, the heavy lifting, happens before that – in explaining that virtue and why that virtue is a moral requirement.

Respecting nature is essential to the human virtue of “appreciation of the good.”

Explain how this is different from appraisal. Seems prudential. Seems like we may need to talk about intrinsic human good, so there may be metaphysics of intrinsic value at work here.

Why is ethics not all about humans rights and welfare? It depends on how you cash out Rights and Duty correspondences? Do rights-bearers need to be moral agents? If not, I agree.

Asking the Virtue question: what sort of person should I be?

Bad, objectionable attitudes are immoral.

Wrongness of most wrong acts and attitudes are overdetermined. There isn’t just one reason which makes something wrong most of the time.

Imho, Rights may propagate from a duty.

“We can expect that virtuous persons will value nature for its own sake—at elast they will not regard the natural environement merely as a emans to human welfare or as asomething who treatment is constrained only by human rights.” (97)

If values do not preexist the human world, how are they “not simply things we create or mere reflects of our subjective tastes?” (97-98)

It is valuable because we value them? It is valuable because the virtuous agent values them? Internalism vs. externalism debate. I am might suspicious of any such moves. They are anti-realist.

“it is good to value certain natural phenomena for their own sakes and to recognize and respond appropriately to the value they have, in a sense, independently of human rights and welfare.” (98)

Just because it is good, does that mean we ought. Lots of good things aren’t necessarily right or required.

Theory of aesthetics is required. Hardly a settled matter, and may be a rocky foundation for any theory of ethics. Beauty, good, and right. 3 things. Plato.

If we don’t agree to intrinsic value, what else is there? That is the plausible intuition, obscure as it may be.

Manifest readiness to appreciate the good. (99) Not as an means, but as an end in itself then?

It is a means to humans still on his argument.

Systematic lack of appreciate is a defect of character. Why? That isn’t necessarily true. The reason some people dismiss nature may have to do with lacking a proper education, and sometimes that isn’t their fault. They weren’t habituated correctly, and thus they lack the correct beliefs and attitudes. Sometimes those beliefs and attitudes aren’t available to them to choose. They have no reasons to have them. Why would I hold them responsible for that? How can this be a duty of theirs? This seems to talk about what the ideal human is like, but isn’t ethics mostly concerned about being the a good moral agent rather than good human? Granted, omniscient moral agents are more ideal than limited and finite moral agents, but there is an ideal for each context, right? Moral character vs. other character. Why is this a moral vice?

One of the many things I don’t like about so many virtue theories is that what the virtuous agent would do is so ideal that I definitionally have no access to making the choices he makes, for the reasons he makes, with the attitudes he makes, in the way he makes them. I can’t really do what is right, and no one else can either. That is not an accurate portrayal of the moral lives we have or can have. Moral life is about doing the best you can with what you have, and virtue theory fails to appreciate that fact. Virtue ethics fails to be agent-context-sensitive. I don’t blame my children for not understanding complex moral problems, and similarly I shouldn’t be blamed for not understanding really complex more problems. The language of Virtue ethics is the beautiful song of the siren, beware!

Provisionally good, conditionally good, not absolutely good. Only the good will of course.

He claims it is more controversial whether the virtue of appreciate the good has any special application to our attitudes about the natural environment. I happen to think all the dirty work, the heavy lifting, happens before that – in explaining why that virtue is a moral requirement.

I’m not sure if the desire/value is necessarily right. There may be different kinds of values or valuing. It is unclear why valuing must be a stable attitude.

That we value something gives us a reason to act in that way. Maybe. Necessarily? I don’t know.

It is valuable even when it isn’t valued.

Would ALL moral agents, even non-human ones, value Earth? Would all of them see it as beautiful? Maybe, maybe not.

I did not understand the move that claims a false dichotomy between moral realist value-theory and “creating or inventing” value on 104.

Ordinary language arguments, yuck. He sounds like a virtue ethicist. Are you sure he’s Kantian?

I fear Hill has opened 10 Cans of Worms, piling problem after problem, and has resolved very little.

The relationship between the Good and Right (and the Beautiful, is that is any different from the Good) is a timeless, crazy hard problem. I take Hill not to be saying “this is definitely correct,” but rather offering us his honed intuition on the matter, beckoning us to “look and see if we see what he sees.”
