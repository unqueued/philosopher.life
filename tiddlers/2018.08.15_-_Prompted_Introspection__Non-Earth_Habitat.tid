title: 2018.08.15 - Prompted Introspection: Non-Earth Habitat

!! Where would you want to live if Earth was uninhabitable.

Melisandre, my dear, would you give me a list of other habitats? I'd strongly consider choosing them even if Earth was habitable. I love the interwebs too much to leave though.

Alright, I would choose the moon. Done.
