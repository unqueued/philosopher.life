* Received letter from Union. I am officially on the list now, with 90 out of 100 score in the interview. Will find out more.
** It's weird because the lap before we got the mail, we were talking about the fact that it might be better if I stay at home as much as possible for the kids. They really do much better when I'm there to help them.
