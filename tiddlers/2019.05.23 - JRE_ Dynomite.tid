title: 2019.05.23 - JRE: Dynomite

Called my bro up a bit early today. He's heading to do more PT. He thinks [[j3d1h]] should try it. He says it would make life much easier for her. I'm hoping he'll show her (though he did send us the images of the instructions). 

I recommended [[Black Dynamite]], and we talked about some shows.

Besides applying for jobs and swimming, there isn't much new around here. I suppose that's good.

We talked about the note I received from [[SLT]] yesterday. My assumption is [[AA]] let her know I had been in the hospital.<<ref "2019.05.26">> My brother had little to say about the letter to [[SLT]]. It doesn't sound like he went through the linking, but there's a lot. He said he'd be interested in knowing the links to word ratio in the document. I appreciate his thinking about it with me. I am glad to be done with it for as long as I can.

My brother has been feeling pretty tired lately. He's getting 5 hours of sleep, and when he gets home from work he's so bushed that he's a bit of a zombie until later in the evening.
