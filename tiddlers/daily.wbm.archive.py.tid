# This script requests TheWayBackMachine, archive.org, take a snapshot of the wiki.
# I use it as a daily backup/snapshot tool. I hope not to abuse their service. I also hope they diff/delta store it (sorry if you don't, bro).

# For Debian/Ubuntu:
# sudo apt-get install python-pip
# sudo -H pip install --upgrade pip
# sudo -H pip install requests
import requests

# Sexy one-liner
