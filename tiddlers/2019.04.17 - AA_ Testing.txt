How's your day been?
TUE 7:34 PM
My days have been crazy.... the accreditation team for school leaves this morning! Woot woot
WED 8:49 AM
/high 5
WED 8:49 AM
Awesome.
WED 8:49 AM
The kids asked me if I was worried about being observed and I told them my biggest worry was remembering to keep my shoes on :blush:
WED 8:50 AM
Lol!
WED 8:50 AM
And...I can’t tell you if I had them on or not when she was in here
WED 8:50 AM
I hate being observed.
WED 8:51 AM
/sigh —I am what I am whether being observed or not
WED 8:51 AM
But! School is whizzing by and I am grateful. Testing is next week and I have the ninth grade boys
WED 8:52 AM
Yup. Plus, you are good at what you do. You should feel confident in it.
WED 8:53 AM
They test for about 3 weeks here, which is kind of insane to me.
WED 8:53 AM
[[AG]] has Peter Johnson for testing and I deliberately took the boys because I don’t want to administer her test and I don’t want her to feel pressure because of mom
WED 8:54 AM
Makes sense to me.
WED 8:54 AM
That would be awful
WED 8:54 AM
We have 3/4 days —and only really in the morning
WED 8:54 AM
I try to bring breakfast snacks or food
WED 8:54 AM
Err fruit that is
WED 8:55 AM
How are you doing?
WED 8:55 AM
I suppose life will start slowing down for you by the time summer hits (hopefully).
WED 8:56 AM
Yes! I hope so too
WED 8:56 AM
I'm not sleep well enough, but I'm working hard.
WED 8:56 AM
I teach kids and myself all day, erry day.
WED 8:56 AM
I'm enjoying my job.
WED 8:57 AM
Good good that’s awesome —more kids should have people like you investing in them
WED 8:57 AM
I feel like I'm given more latitude to just do the babysitting my way, which has been useful. Lots of one-on-ones, serious discussions, and subverting that prison.
WED 8:57 AM
Sleep machine has changed my sleep and my mornings—I have to run to the bathroom in the morning because I no longer wake up 3 times during the night to pee
WED 8:58 AM
That is outstanding.
WED 8:59 AM
That’s great that they aren’t micro-managing you
WED 8:59 AM
I've never tried one of machines, but I know people who swear by them.
WED 9:00 AM
[[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]] are reading Sophie's World. I am super excited by it. Teaching my kids the subject I value the most is the highlight of school for me.
WED 9:02 AM
I hate doing the same thing at the same time with them when they are different ages (unfair to either or both of them in some respects), but sometimes it's the most feasible option.
WED 9:03 AM
Yeah it’s hard when its a mixed crowd
WED 9:04 AM
I have not read Sophie’s world but I see why you would love it
WED 9:05 AM
It’s like having [[AG]] in math :blush:
WED 9:06 AM
Yes!
WED 9:06 AM
[[AG]] is starting to get used to you poking her which is great
WED 9:22 AM
Oh, good! Lol.
WED 9:23 AM
I'm an annoying poke monster. But, that's my best option for developing a relationship with her. =)
WED 9:23 AM
She is afraid of saying/spelling things wrong. Maybe I should teach her to talk to her phone. Dyslexia sucks
WED 9:23 AM
She is starting to text some...not a bunch though
WED 9:24 AM
The flood will come.
WED 9:24 AM
Yes! We are slowly growing up —I am trying to let go but its hard
WED 9:26 AM
Sometimes I just close my eyes to the fact that her clothes aren’t the best match and her hair is less than wonderful because those are choices she made
WED 9:28 AM
And she really doesn’t want my opinion
WED 9:28 AM
Lol!
WED 9:28 AM
Well, I'm glad you thoughtfully listen to her anyway.
WED 9:29 AM
Now if she would wake up on her own and clean up after herself we would have something going
WED 9:29 AM
If you find the magic pixie dust which helps with that, let me know. Like pulling teeth for me.
WED 9:29 AM
The Lois in my head is screaming at me about my nappy wrinkly child out in public
WED 9:29 AM
Lol.
WED 9:30 AM
But I talk back to the voices and tell them to back off —which makes me look weird too
WED 9:30 AM
Preachin' to the choir. I'm just grateful I don't literally hear the voices, but I feel them. Very hard to turn off. Sometimes I can tell them to shush, but sometimes I have to drop tentpegs and wrestle. It is a draining experience.
WED 9:32 AM
I admire how much you respect and prepare for the autonomy of your daughters. I hope to do the same. I'm lucky to have your modeling.
WED 9:33 AM
It’s hard and the nagging in me wins often but I am trying. I value your encouragement. It helps so much
WED 9:34 AM
I an Naggy!
WED 9:34 AM
I am Naggy that is

WED 9:36 AM
Lol!
WED 9:36 AM
I am a tyrant and helicopter parent enthusiast; I'm trying to figure out how to let go. Ugh. They have to make the mistakes and learn how to take risks. A beautiful nightmare.
WED 9:37 AM
I think it's harder with [[1uxb0x]] because I'm scared for his survival.
WED 9:37 AM
Yeah I have the same fears (to a less degree) with [[AG]]
WED 9:55 AM
She is not as self-motivated as [[L]] but she is more intuitive
WED 9:56 AM
I love the way she processes and puts things together
WED 10:11 AM
Just thinking... maybe ask [[L]] about Seth. He is really autistic and yet functions really well. He has found his people and is successful at U of L. He joins [[L]] for game nights and other things
WED 11:11 AM
But... she would know more both about Seth (he is our nephew—[[UJ]]’s brother’s son) and she has spent time with [[1uxb0x]] more recently than I

His degree will be in Biology—he wants to work in a lab
WED 11:20 AM
