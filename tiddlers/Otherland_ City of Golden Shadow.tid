title: Otherland: City of Golden Shadow

Preliminary Work:

* https://wikivisually.com/wiki/City_of_Golden_Shadow

This is now a classic. Several of these moves and tropes can be found in the literature that comes after it. e.g. Renie reminds me of the new Bladerunner sequel. [[The Matrix]] comes after this. This book is of the Neuromancer lineage.

Preach. That is exactly what the real world is (yes, Marx), and that is exactly where I fear wetware is going. [[The Matrix]] fails in thinking we'd be used as batteries; we'd be used as biological computers meant to be harnessed by AI (rather than as biological computer capital of the ruling class who happen to be human today). That would be the real ironic twist of fate right thar.

I am absolutely enthralled by [[The Other]], of course. I could not be more excited to explore this angle.

The "dying in simulation thus dying IRL" is always a bit suspect, but I think there may be ways to make sense of it.

The war on death, VR, brains in vats, simulation, and how we tell ourselves the stories of who are here. My wife may have handed the best book of the year. My body is ready. Come, take me there.

The issues of compatibilism and agency are alive in this book too. I feel like I'm about to get my dick sucked off in this book. Ah, I better lower my expectations! (But, it's Tad Williams).

The [[Straussian]] undertale, deeper narrative, revelation may be here. I will look closely, sir! Speak to me! Reveal yourself!

Uploading one's mind, of course, is a serious philosophical matter. This book and my wiki have a fuckton in common.

Of course, I cannot help but wonder what such an infrastructure would require. I am not convinced that those inside the simulation can effectively control what is outside. It just seems infeasible (though obviously logically possible).

Transhumanism cool. Malebranche and The Other for questions of idealism also cool.

Do I want to be T4b? =) Lol

I do not understand why this story really needs Paul and this intro. Nightmare with the bird-woman (all I can think is IASIP or Bird-Person in Rick and Morty).

Fascinating to see what teaching digital literacy is like in this world. "As a parent," I feel this pain too. =)

ROFL. The raw addiction/dependency. I'm there now!

Being a dancer or singer on the net. Lol! This book is prescient. Half the children I've met want to be a "youtuber." ROFL.

I realize this is LOTR in Cyberspace with allusions to lots of famous literature. I am surprised by how much poetry there is as well. Maybe it's just the motif, but I think the poems may be enigmatic.

What does "ghost" mean on the net in this book?

At the table, the discussion of appearance and interaction limits are interesting. This is imaginative for when the book was written, but I might have other things to say about the limits and abilities I'd expect in this cyberspace given what I know now. But, again, Tad can do whatever he wants since this may just be fantasy (and magic).

Falling down into the depths is Alice in Wonderland territory.

It feels like Tad Williams has played Everquest.

Admittedly, I'm looking forward to any and all sexual content in this book. Pleeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaseeeee.

I am a netboy.

I think Tad Williams may be prescient. This is ridiculously accurate in a number of respects.

The use of "RL" is gorgeous. I still use the nomenclature today, e.g. [[IRL Users]]. It's weird to see how this is //speculative// fiction. So much of this book just feels //normal// to me.

Williams clearly demonstrates class warfare, the crisis of capitalism, the fundamental problems of virtualization and simulation, and SCREAMS to us about the centralization of power (including informational).

It's interesting to see that the GPU rendering is not done client side. They are using thin clients. I am surprised that the wetware of the individuals aren't more openly exploited (though, the kids in comas are obviously experiencing something like this).

One thing Williams does poorly in thinking about the range of sensory experiences that could be "injected" is just raw bliss itself. The perfect hedonic algorithm could be tailored to each individual; it's hedonic heaven.

But, but...the children!

Also love the "Netflick" name.

Unfortunately, this book's novelty has worn off entirely for me. Is it too slow? Is it too spoiled for me? The narrative itself is not compelling. The tidbits of what virtual life is like, the anticipation and speculation, the lineage of this book...those are interesting to me. The story itself is a bore.
