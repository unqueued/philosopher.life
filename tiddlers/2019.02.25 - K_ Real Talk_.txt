Have a great day [[h0p3]]! ^-^
MON 8:36 AM
Hey, you too. =)
MON 9:50 AM
How was your weekend?
MON 9:50 AM
Busy busy. But enjoyable.
MON 10:35 AM
What about you?
MON 10:35 AM
It was busy, busy, but enjoyable for me as well.
MON 1:09 PM
What did you enjoy most about it?<<ref "2020.02.26-1">>
MON 1:09 PM
Being able to see my out of state friends. And our dnd campaign continuing despite her move.
MON 1:23 PM
That sucks that she had to move. It's cool that it can continue.
MON 1:24 PM
That's a powerful moment in the story of telling stories to me.
MON 1:24 PM
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
MON 1:25 PM
Also, what was the story we set a date for?
MON 1:27 PM
Dunno. THat would be a question for [[L]]... I shall ask her.
MON 1:27 PM
What you up to today?
MON 1:33 PM
I assume school and work.
MON 1:33 PM
I have asked her
MON 1:33 PM
Yup!
MON 1:33 PM
Mythology got cancelled though
MON 1:33 PM
So that's a thing
MON 1:34 PM
Your midterm go alright?
MON 1:34 PM
Real talk?
MON 1:34 PM
the first half was great
MON 1:34 PM
Realized I had 15 minutes left and rushed the fuck out of my essay
MON 1:34 PM
I hate that feeling so much.
MON 1:34 PM
I hate writing in-class essays though.
MON 1:34 PM
And, yes, I'm always down for realtalk. =)
MON 1:35 PM
Hahaha
MON 1:37 PM
Yeah, but he's a super cool professor and the first half was really good
MON 1:37 PM
I think I'll be just fine
MON 1:37 PM
Good.
MON 1:37 PM
This could have been a ten page paper basically
MON 1:38 PM
ended up with 2.5 written
MON 1:39 PM
I think my favorite in-class written exams gave us the chance to pre-write from a list of study questions.<<ref "2020.02.26-2">>
MON 1:41 PM
It sounds like one of those unfair, impossible tasks which give you the chance to show off as much as you possible can in a narrow window of time.
MON 1:42 PM
So for this one, we were allowed to bring whatever we wanted into the exam, just no electronics, so I just made an outline and brought my book
MON 1:43 PM
My outline was too long apparently
MON 1:43 PM
I loved grading logic so much more than the rest of philosophy.
MON 1:44 PM
I could design 1-page (front and back) with objective, easy-to-grade, complete content-coverage, obvious partial-credit-policy generating tests.
MON 1:45 PM
Grading was a mindless task at that point.
MON 1:46 PM
Written tests are almost impossible for me to grade without bringing my own bias to the table.<<ref "2020.02.26-3">>
MON 1:47 PM
undue* bias
MON 1:47 PM
i totally see what you mean
MON 1:48 PM
haha
