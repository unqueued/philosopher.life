title: 2020.02.15 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Toy

!! Think of your favourite toy. Why do you like it best?

It's either my penis or my computer, probably my computer. My computer isn't a mere toy, but it does act as a toy (or a window into a toy). Sometimes I think my computer is a miniature dollhouse (creepy, I guess). It's got so many worlds in it or access to them. It's such a strong tool and toy that it overrides my interest in non-digital parts and possibility of my life. I think it has, on average, competitive advantage and the least regret of so many possible toys in my life. It's a gift that keeps on giving (though, it is always pleasant or happy, and I do not claim to use it wisely enough). 

My [[monster]] is something that radically defines me. It's fascinating to watch the digital revolution continue to worm its way through our species. It's been surreal watching people glued to their phones, seeing it become normalized, having our machines eat our worlds, and this is me coming from a time when using your machines obsessively was still unacceptable nerd territory. I feel bad that they use inferior tools/toys (though, for most of the world, this is not up to them directly at all), like the console plebs before mainstream mods. I do not know if people will eventually migrate to [[monster]]s in general either. I'm a terrible judge here. For instance, I think Redditors are normies (even back when it first started), but that's not accurate enough (though this is changing as well).
