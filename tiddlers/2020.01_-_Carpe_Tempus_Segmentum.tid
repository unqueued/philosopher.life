!! Audit:

* I reliving it. It lights up. =)
* Sleep schedule has been stabilizing, but it's my usually 3am bullshit.
** Though, I was sleeping earlier during our move. I was exhausted.
* I've been more explicit about what I'm shopping for. 
** Although, it's not like I'm used to shopping so damn much. It's ridiculous.
* I've been cleaning a lot. But, that is the nature of moving. 
** We make a pass, clean-up, rinse and repeat. It slowly, maybe even organically(?) grows. Not been easy while sick.
*** I'm not disappointed with my work, but I'm disappointed in how little progress I've made.
* My offspring have had to make a lot of adjustments. I've not been too hard on them though. We're thinking hard to take that into account.
* I've been in a dazed state. Evenings have been far more passive than I'd prefer. 
* [[JRE]] has been significantly happier! =)
** His mind changed this month, and I think discussions with Rebecca have been fruitful for him. I'm worried now about him losing his //son//. =(. Matthew is his son, innit he?
*** He's not just a thread now. He's a pillar of meaning for my brother, and I'm worried for his safety. I don't know what to do if it falls apart.
* I appreciate that we maintain our dialectures habit even through the turmoil. So many habits were thrown out the window, but that one has been consistent enough.
* Dude, I really like it when you go in-depth here, and I disappointed when you only provide a skeleton. You should work on your [[Sphygmus]]-imitation.
** There's more colorful comments and offshoots, I think. Rock on.
* The move would have been much, much harder without my wife careful work to secure our finances.
* Hey, you've been sick. You did a good job while being sick.
** You did find some meds which make it bearable. Your productivity went up.
* I'm still surprised by how much stuff we have. It's amazing that we made it work so well in JC.
** I'm spoiled by having so much space here. 
*** I'm excited that we may finally have a dining table again.
* Still haven't made brownies for neighbors. [[TDL]]in that shit. 
* I'm not talking with [[DeathOfRobinhood]] enough.
** Although, he also could call me. It's not like it's all on me to connect here.
* I'm grateful that my daughter is getting on the Reddit train. I need to help my son do so as well. 
** Next step: controlling our drug use, shaping it. Eventually, we will [[Link Log]]. I'm so excited. I've been trying for years, and it might finally be happening.
* Kintsugi has been on hold. In fact, I've had to figure out what I need to do and in what order more than usual. 
* I need to stop watching so much. My wife needs to help me out here. If something is on, all I want to do is curl up with her. I need to fucking write.
* Your wife is more exhausted. Her energy has ran out. We know sleep is the fundamental force here, but maybe the meds also did something else during the day.
* Once you started sleeping again, you started dreaming more than usual, imho.
