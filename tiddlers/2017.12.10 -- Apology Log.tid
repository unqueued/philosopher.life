title: 2017.12.10 -- Apology Log

Son, I am sorry that I snapped at you while you worked on your laptop. I handed you a job more difficult than it appeared to me, and I made poor assumptions about your motivations. You are doing a great job. Thank you for trying so hard. I am sorry that I even had the feelings of frustration. That wasn't acceptable. I am trying to become someone better.<<ref "1">>
