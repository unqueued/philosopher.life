* Fek, we didn't know we needed a bill of sale. Welp, need that paperwork first. 
* I'd like to see you complete your living room and begin setting up your garage.
** Lots of wiring to do. 
*** Could use the coax as fishtape for ethernet for the offspring...What do they want? I think they'd be just fine with wireless.
* Need to buy batteries for laptops
* You seem to be feeling better (2 steps forward, 1 back). Get yo' sleep, but you should push now.
* You are running out of time on the modem. 
** At least you found it (exactly where you put it, and, ofc, in the last place you looked).
** Still don't know if it is the right version. Needs to be solved asap.
* Chops, veggies, potatoes, and perhaps that melon.
* Dat chalkboard, yo. It will finally be adjacent to you. Just to need to mount the bastard correctly.
** Kinda want a very, very thin shelf (but longcat long) next to me. It can't eat into my manspreading space though.
