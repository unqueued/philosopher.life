* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0552-2
*** That is significantly worse than I'd hoped.

* Think About It
** https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/theforum/faulknerproblemoftrust/
*** Yeah, but why should I think that empirical data is reliable indicator of all of the other [[dok]] of trust games?
*** Not convinced that Williams' argument works (even though I'm sympathetic), but obviously taking up psychological egoism as the sole explanation of our motivations is far more problematic.
*** The trusting trust problem still doesn't get resolved for the philosopher. Even your own epistemic status must be called into question.
** https://egtheory.wordpress.com/2019/08/31/web-of-c-lief/
*** I agree the c-lief gives you an initialization or a threshold of what you don't know. I consider it only the beginning of a set of much harder problems into metaphysics. I agree it offers higher confidence, and even certainty in some cases. The epistemic standard is simply higher.
**** Let's be clear though: you've still got to give some foundation to the c-liefs which aren't so clean.

*** Can you learn something about the nature of what it is like to be conscious, or the conditions of consciousness, or for there to be anything at all through the examination of dreams? Yes. Perhaps drug-use has something similar to provide.
*** Same problem. I feel that pain. My "solution" is not the same though, but I appreciate that prudential justification.
** https://philosophynow.org/issues/126/On_Non-Existent_Objects
*** Not much space there. Good work. Would like to see him target [[Meinongianism|2019.10.14 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Meinongianism]] directly. We're forced into conjecture.

*** I doubt they can pierce without centralization. This problem should be free and open sourced. I'd like to see defense funds spent toward it.

*** Of course, I have super mixed feelings about it.

* For my offspring:
** https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2019/09/heidegger-homesick-philosopher
*** You are going to have to face the fact that some of the most important thinkers in the world have been radically wrong in so many ways. Generating a steelman interpretation of Heidegger requires setting aside a great deal.
