title: 2017.03.12 - Realpolitik Speculation: Generational Enslavement

//Society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.//

I realize many sane people are quick to put down generation hit pieces. I can only say: be honest. Do you really believe people are responsible for their actions or not? If no, then you have no rational grounds from which to complain that I write this. If yes, then show me I'm wrong in how I've pointed my finger.

I see why I have duties to the generations after me (that's fundamental golden rule work behind the Veil of Ignorance). I'm quite unclear about why I have duties to the generations before me. It's a world of their creation. Of course, you can claim, "Not all baby-boomers." And, to that I say, I'll forgive the leftist Boomers and to a lesser extent the disenfranchised. Sanders may be wrong, but he is wrong for the right reasons. They at least tried, and they didn't give up. But, why should I forgive the rest? Isn't it obvious they have fucked us?

I think Boomers are the most psychopathic generation we've ever seen.<<ref "1">> Their personalities, values, beliefs, and behaviors demonstrate a clear distortion into the dark triad spectrum. Their hypocrisy is legendary. I'm pissed off at them, and I have been for years. I've seen plenty of Millenial hate, and I took it very seriously.<<ref "2">> Now the tables turn. Be prepared to be judged, assholes. I am entitled, and rationally so! I am convinced that Boomers have attempted to enslave and exploit the world and future generations.<<ref "3">> Why should I empathize with those psychopaths?

Baby-Boomers:

* pulled up the ladder behind them.
* are usurers, pimps, and loan-sharks.
* seek order at the expense of justice.
* destroyed the environment and do not seek to curb it.
* openly enabled capitalists to rape us.
* gave our freedom away, support and uphold the Establishment. deregulated the market and financial industries, and centralized power in the hands of the Hyperclass.
* deconstructed The New Deal.
* are war-mongers (I've lost track at this point).
* systematically choose to be misinformed and ignorant.
* did not earn their wealth, but act like they did.
* allowed our infrastructure to fall apart or become privatized.
* lived in a bubble and do not empathize with future generations.
* blindly believe that if they are happier then everyone else will be happier as if the point of justice is to make them happy.
* heavily engage in Rent-Seeking behavior, especially towards later generations.
* are the primary actors/causes of our national, medical, and educational debts.
* either have no concept of real unemployment, buying power, upward mobility, the nature of the standards of living over the course of human history, and worker rights, or they don't care.
* are hugely responsible for why suicide rates, depression, and mental illness have been on the rise.
* are completely responsible for the lack of medical care available to everyone in the US. The number of deaths and amount of suffering on their hands is mind-boggling.
* are conservatives. Please, burn in hell.
* are the most racist, sexist, discriminatory generation alive.
* generated and maintained safety-nets only for themselves while simultaneously off-loading the risk and debt to younger generations.
* aggressively sought to enslave us through food addictions, advertisements, IP-regimes, and censorship.
* do not pay their fair share, and completely fail the "to whom much is given, much is required" test.
* complain about the generation they raised.
* are the first to bemoan the loss of family values while having the highest rates of divorce of any generation ever (among many other "family values" and dysfunctional family sins).


Oh, they aren't solely responsible for these problems, and they aren't the only people who believe and behave in these ways. They are still thoroughly and profoundly guilty though.

The fact is that generations tend to prey upon weaker, younger, powerless generations. Baby-boomers did not fight that urge, and it shows. 

I have no idea how the grandchildren of Millenials will feel about their predecessors. But, I'm not even convinced we will survive to have grandchildren at this point. Even if we did, even if we could fix these problems in time, I doubt my age-peers will do anything. 

The iniquitous consequences of the sins of the father last for generations. I'm done making excuses for you. I'm fed up with your abuse and gaslighting. I'm ready to fight back. So, officially, to most baby-boomers: suck my dick and please KYS.<<ref "4">> The world would be better without you.

<<footnotes "3" "Although, let's be clear, there is plenty of blame to go around. I really do hate most people.">>

<<footnotes "4" "The good news is that without healthcare or any savings (because, why plan for the future: you're a psychopath towards yourself too!), Boomers are going to start dropping like flies. Rejoice!">>
