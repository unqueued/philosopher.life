title: 2020.02.14 - Prompted Introspection: Smoke & Drink

!! Why do you think adults smoke/drink?

Oh, shit, Samwise, this is a much more involved question to answer than it looks. I've also answered this tangentially:

Drinking, presumably alcohol here, is something which began even before civilization, but it definitely marks the beginning of settled civilization (and may even have been one of the primary incentives for putting down roots). The drinking I do, however, is functionally alcoholic. It's cheap, it numbs and slows things down, it disinhibits, and there are so many reasons that I choose to drink. I think the same can be said of almost anyone who has imbibed.

Presumably, you mean smoking something which contains nicotine. Nicotine is a nootropic, insidiously. Why someone began smoking is often a different matter than why they continue. Nicotine addiction is incredibly strong (average 25 years to break). Taxation, education, and regulation (particularly of [[Memetic Warfare]] waged by the psychopathic salesmen) is morally obligated.
