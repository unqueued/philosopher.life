title: 2020.02.08 - Wiki Review: Taken Me Years To Admit I Have A Stutter

* [[2020.02.07 - chameleon: Open Expression]]
** Completed. The shoji metaphor is something I would like to explore further. I'm not doing a good job of describing it. 
* [[2020.02.07 - DeathOfRobinhood: I find DOR's dialogue the worst]]
** It's surprisingly [[TLDR]]-esque. 
* [[FTO: Seemingly One-Off Online Encounters]]
** Yeah, I didn't do it right the first time. I'm in [[The Remodeling]] kind of mood, thankfully.
* [[2020.01.13 - shawwwn: GPT-2]]
** I don't think my wiki is worth it yet.
** I can do this for free right now (in the future, it probably won't be free). Seems like the results aren't going to be stellar enough. Better to wait for more tooling and a larger corpus.
*** Also, need to find a way to scrape text effectively out of the links in [[Link Log]] (and continue scaffolding off it) to generate the secondary part of the corpus. 
* [[2020.02.07 - TDL: DMV]]
** DMV and Date took most everything. I didn't do a great job today. =(.
* [[2020.02.07 - Wiki Audit: The Remodeling]]
** I can see that //Dreams://[[Wiki Audit]] is going to fill up with big things I just can rewrite in a day or fix over the years.
* [[2020.02.07 - Wiki Review: Never Listen To But Always Imitate My Elders]]
** Yeah, I think the [[Yearly Cross-section]] is something my offspring should start engaging in. Purposely reorganizing, bit-by-bit, retelling the story, accountability, seeing the grander timeslicing...can't teach it fast enough.
*** It's going to be important to friend and mate selection+development too.
* [[2020.02.07 - Prompted Introspection: Exciting Quality]]
** It's not like I don't have boring aspects of my life either. There's plenty of tedium too. I'm usually just surprised by what people find interesting.
* [[2020.02.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Ur a 9/10 & I'm the 1 U need]]
** She needs space after work. She really needs to sit alone upstairs, but she doesn't want to either. It's an interesting conflict in her.
*** I'm not convinced vegging out has been a worthy use of our time. 
*** I am convinced getting to bed earlier has been useful to her.
* [[2020.02.06 - BDS97: Witcher]]
** There's something missing inside me. I'm just not compelled by the stories of video games. I don't understand why they don't click with me like other kinds of stories.
