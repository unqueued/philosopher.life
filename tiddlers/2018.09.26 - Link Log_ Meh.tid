*** The problem, of course, is that there is almost no space between [[The Good]] and [[The Right]] on utility. It really does appear like you can make it say just whatever you want to say. [[The Golden Rule]] is a vote on [[The Good]]; it's the only right way to calculate the context of all contexts in a fair heuristic.

*** Ofc, I've always been taught to despise central planning like this. I am fine with central-planning as long as the voting process is decentralized correctly. Rule of Law can do a great deal. That isn't to say, ofc, that China implements anything like [[The Original Position]].

*** As long as "workers own the means of production" is a decentrality principle that leads to Golden Rule hegemony, the justified Rule of Law, cool.

*** Wonderful read.
*** ‘what equilibria there are that can withstand examination’ - Depends on what you mean by examination? Does that claim live up to itself? It does appear metamodernish
*** This philosopher is decorated as fuck, lol.
*** Philosophy is the highest IQ Humanity (Economics is also quite high). I do not know why gender gap is there.

*** Fascinating claim. The gold standard crowd is always interesting. I do not know enough to say anything other than: you should think about what they have to say. I think you will find the Fed to be a super complex institution.
