title: 2020.01.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Favor the Accused

How much doubt, doubt about what, and does favoring come in [[dok]]? This is [[FTO]] territory, and at the heart of justice as victim-preserving (or restoring) even as prevention.  That comes at the cost of other victims, but it's easy for evil to beget evil. We have to stop the spreading disease of injustice, and this is a fine rule-of-thumb (even if it doesn't address how to draw lines finely enough). We are never certain though, and we are going to make mistakes even with ideal methods. The hard problem is knowing when to take the risk (since there is always doubt; even our [[phenomenology]] must be doubted), and there's not always a good feedback mechanism for enabling us to update the parameters of our principles here.

How do we construct power structures that are radically difficult to corrupt and owned by everyone? That's actually the practical problem to solve in order to empirically navigate the problem of doubt in justice down to all the various lines in our contexts.
