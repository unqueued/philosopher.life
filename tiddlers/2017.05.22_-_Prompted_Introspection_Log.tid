!! What historical figure do you most identify with?

Am I not a historical figure? I suppose I'm not because I'm not famous. Of course, fame is an arbitrary set of lines we draw. I don't mean to say I deserve to be a legend (not even in my own mind). I mean to say that I existed in the past, there's even writing about me (and we can continue down the path of defining "historical"), and I am a figure (however unnoteworthy). Obviously, I'm not anything like what is commonly thought to be a historical figure. Inspecting the limits, of course, is ultimately useful. Words are simply made up, and we should test their boundaries and the reasons for why they have the shape and semantics they do.

I can tell you that I aspire to have the characteristics I imagine many historical figures have. I'm not sure how much I really am like them.

The very concept of "identifying with" is murky to me.<<ref "1">> There is clearly a kind of fad mixed with an important sequence of philosophical considerations in the phrase. We can do some handwaving and say "you know what I mean" or "stop being a lawyer" or "stop playing semantics,"<<ref "2">> but I have legitimate concerns about how we wield these politically significant words. This neologism has a lot of connotation embedded in it. 

In a very general sense, I guess it means I am like them or feel as they do, or see as they do, or can empathize with them in a strong or natural sense. Honestly, I feel like an alien. I'm an outcast, somewhat a hermit, and someone who people ultimately do not want to get to know most of the time. I consider that to be a defining feature of who I am, and it makes it difficult for me to find people who I ultimately "identify with." I don't really belong anywhere, and historical figures tend to belong somewhere. 

What then is left? What I value? What I think? What I practice? I mean, I'd straight up love to be anything like the philosopher gods I idolize. Beyond an issue of moral luck, I don't have what it takes, I think. My brilliance is fading; it has been wasted tracking down the wrong life. Who has a wasted life in the desert, trying to rebuild from shattered pieces of who he was? I'm sure there are many. I can't think of any remarkable "historical figures" off the top of my head like that (although, I'm sure I could easily be convinced, and maybe my memory is just failing me here). I think we tend not to remember or care about those kinds of people. We don't want to empathize with those losers, lol. 

I have to say: this question turned out to be sad to me.
