!! What TV or movie star would you like to invite to your birthday party?

Surely, Samwise, you must think I'm a grumpy cynic of this collectively simulated appearance of kindness; I am my own party-pooper for a reason. I don't have birthday parties beyond a dinner with my family (which is what I aim to do every night).<<ref "c">> For the love of all that is holy, please don't throw me a birthday party unless we're just going to get blasted out of our minds on safe drugs. Don't make me uselessly spend my spoons. There are too few people I believe really mean it as well (and they would know not to throw me a party); I don't want to sit there just contemplating the mockery of the event into hyperreal psychosis. I have recognized many counterfeits in the world, so it's extremely expensive to demonstrate to me that you actually give a shit about me. That's why I ask for what is pragmatic as best I can. Cleaning our digital and physical homes, realtalking about what matters with each other, and existential wrestling is the only proof or validation I want. Cake is rhetorical gravy, almost always a lie. I do not wish to calculate my participation in it, so don't drain me with deceptive bullshit (I don't want to have to think about how to simultaneously both morally and socially acceptably play along with the group's selfish delusion that they actually care). If my birthday party is actually just for everyone else (and I realize, people need to party), then let's not call it a party for me.

Oh, I did answer this: [[2018.04.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Celebrity B-Day]]. Lol, and in keeping with [[chameleon]]'s answer too: [[Keanu|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.10.30%20-%20star%20shines%20in%20all%20of%20us]] seems like a reasonable pick. We'd talk about [[The Matrix]]. I wouldn't mind picking the actor's brain, but I assume I might be disappointed.
