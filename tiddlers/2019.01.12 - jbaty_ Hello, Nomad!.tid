It's a pleasure to meet you, nomad. It is not often that I am called out of the desert by name. I [[hope]] you don't mind me {[[contact]]}ing you, and please let me know if I can {[[help]]} you.

Hi, I'm Jack Baty and after a number of failed attempts to adopt TiddlyWiki over the years, I've recently fallen deeply for it. I'm now practically living in my new wiki at https://rudimentarylathe.org/ and have a dozen more running locally for work projects. Lots to learn!
<<<

You have inspired me to create a new subproject of [[FTO]]: [[Public Self-Modelers]]. I still don't know what it means. 

I'd love for us to have a [[hyperconversation]] over our wikis like I do with [[Sphygmus]], [[kickscondor]], and possibly [[dziggetai]]. Come, join the round table in the desert with us. There aren't many kids speaking our language playing tag out here in the desert, but we seem to get along exceptionally well. Let's eat, drink, be merry, talk about what matters to us, think about who we are (and will be), blindly wander, and figure out how to find the dragon's treasure in the mountain beyond the desert.

I would love to know more about how you use TW in general both privately and publically. I've very much enjoyed [[this post|https://jack.baty.net/2019/tiddlywiki-is-changing-how-i-think-about-writing-online/]]. I love your site's domain name; there must be dozens of us who giggle with your dank maymay!<<ref "i">> Also, your avatar is genuinely adorable.

<<<
I want to thank @h0p3 for philosopher.life. It's what finally got TiddlyWiki to "click" for me.
<<<

You are welcome for whatever I have offered you that helped. I appreciate you taking the time to think with me. That is high praise. Thank you. I would love to know what clicks for you in TW too. I am still learning about how to reason with and about this tool.<<ref "r">>

In any case, even if for some sad reason you wouldn't be joining me in a conversation,<<ref "s">> I will be reading and thinking about you and your wiki.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]

<<footnotes "i" "Excellent movie. Also, on a tangent (which is one of many annoying things I do at the table), apparently there's an uncut version of this movie. I have failed to find a copy; I can only ever point to a reference. Hence, my life is incomplete. It's a shame we cannot [[haz some|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zutbCKoL5xA]] cheeseburger.">>

<<footnotes "r" "Aside, I almost responded to this: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tiddlywiki/PiUwdVpdyzQ. I wasn't sure if I would be of any use to you though. I am, of course, intrigued by it.">>
