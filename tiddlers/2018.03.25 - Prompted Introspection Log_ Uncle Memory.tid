title: 2018.03.25 - Prompted Introspection Log: Uncle Memory

!! Tell a memory you have with one of your uncles.

One time, my uncle touched my no-no place. JK!

My favorite Uncle, without a doubt, is my Uncle J. He's the one I'd choose to remember. Our last interaction was kind of pitiful though. He was very kind to invite my family to his Thanksgiving feast (a large event amongst several of their related families in the basement/kitchen area of one of the churches my donors pastored for many years). I was sitting with my brother talking, and he joined us. He decided to share his faith with us, bring us back to God, etc. 

My brother JRE and I both knew the deal, and we were geniunely touched that he reached out to us. We knew, at least to some significant degree, he was "coming from a good place," that he "had the right intentions," etc. I legitimately think my Uncle J wants us to be happy, and I am grateful to him for that. Uncle J is a hard man to describe. He's very intelligent, has an odd sense of humor, and is generally a good human being. He doesn't care about being philosophical (a huge strike), but I like him anyways. Uncle J really does not understand me very much at all, but that's also okay. He is who he is, and I feel honored to call him my Uncle. He still merits the honorific (which I am loath to address anyone by at this point). 

Uncle J tried talking to us, and the sad part is, he had absolutely no idea that he was a fish swimming with sharks. Our cynicism has been learned from having walked down roads he won't have the power or time to understand. He wasn't in a position to argue or discuss the matter meaningfully with us because he literally isn't capable of empathizing with us enough. I'm slow to hold him accountable for it though (which is rather unlike me), especially because he really was doing the best he could with what he had. We politely offered counters to his poor mushy argument, and thanked him for taking the time to talk with us about it. I think he realized in my final shooting down of his argument that I thought he was stupid in that moment. I wish it weren't the case. I legitimately love the man. I wish him no ill-will, and I want him to be happy. I'm thankful, but I'm also not interested in what I know to be poison.
