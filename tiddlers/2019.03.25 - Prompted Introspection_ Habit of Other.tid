title: 2019.03.25 - Prompted Introspection: Habit of Other

!! Tell about a habit that you picked up from a family member or friend.

It's pretty hard to find habits which I didn't pick up from others. Social conditions tend to be like that. Feral children never learn to speak, almost all social interactions rest upon a set of habits we've trained with each other, and even sexuality is non-trivially conditioned.

I have the habit of hugging the people I love. It's a wonderful habit-rule in our household too. We hug when we first see each other (unless we are sick), and we hug before we depart for bed. I usually get more hugs throughout the day too. If I have not seen you in a long time, I may stand and embrace you for a minute or two (gets awkward for some folks). I am lucky to have anyone to hug.
