!! How is your health? Daily routine? 

I'm doing well. I think I'm getting fatter again. I feel like I'm eating more. My sleep schedule is decent enough. I feel physically less strong. Perhaps I should work out and write about it (accountability) on Bobert the Wiki. 


---
!! What happened? How do you feel about it? What made you feel this way? Does it make you happy or unhappy? Why or why not?

I feel like a useless asshole. I've been off this week. I think I've been "off" because I'm not playing EQ. I'm glad I'm not playing EQ. It is obviously not what we need.


---
!! Can you better explain what happened? Do you have a technological, philosophical, empathic, or redpilled story to tell about the phenomenon? Clarify the narrative you just told yourself. 

I think I'm also feeling anxious about searching for a job. I'm feeling desperate. I'm feeling a procrastination element mixed with the desire to chill or give up in the face of adversity and setbacks. I want it to be smooth-sailing, obviously. I can't allow my frustration to control me. I must control it. I am in command of myself (right!?), and I will force myself to do what I need to do.


---
!! What are you going to do about what happened?

My goal is to be empathic with my family and myself. I need to have the right attitude. I need to continue to work hard, and I cannot give up. I am so close I can taste it. I need to keep the ball rolling. 

You can do it, h0p3!
