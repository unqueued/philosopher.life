title: 2019.08.17 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Privilege

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
When youâ€™re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.

If you are not justifiably self-reflective, if you do not aim to walk behind the [[VOI]], if the [[ROG]] modifies your behavior, or if your fundamental principle isn't [[The Moral Law]], then your egoism in the will to [[power]] within material dialectics facing [[The Other]] will inevitably be a choice to conveniently rationalize self-serving biases. 

I'm profoundly privileged. No, I don't come from money, and I had a fucked up childhood in some respects. I came from the ghetto, and it's been a steep fucking climb. I have, however, had parents who valued education to a non-trivial [[dok]], I didn't miss meals, I had margins of errors most humans on this planet have never had, I've been able to take huge risks in the pursuits of {[[Dreams]]}, there are vanishingly few people with a formal education like mine, I've won lottery after moral luck lottery, and while my balance sheet looks awful, the actual quality of my standard of living is extremely high. I have options that many of my age group in my own local community and nation will never have. From a global and historical perspective, I am the elite. I have been hunting since I was a young lad for the practical answer to defeating the centralization of power. I do not know what else to do.
