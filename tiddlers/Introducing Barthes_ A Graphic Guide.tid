title: Introducing Barthes: A Graphic Guide

Oh no, the entire book is based on the word "natural." Your first job, Barthes, is to define what it means for something not to be natural. I tend to avoid the word. The keyboard I'm typing on is the result of natural material dialectical processes, right? Humans are natural, and   I don't see why what humans do can't be called natural in every single case either. Your best bet is talk about the supernatural to me. But, I'm still not convinced that is an amazing use of the word.

The problem is that we beg the question too often in our use of the word "natural." What conclusion do you want? Either call it natural or unnatural, and boom, you've got an assumption that buys you a lot. I'm sure my contention with the meaning of //natural// is ironically half the point.

Socializing is natural. Social constructions appear natural as well.

Why should I think there are signs with no actual content? Is that even a sign? Moreover, even if there were such a thing, why should I think the actor or the all-in-wrestler provide contentless signs to us? Is it deceptive? Maybe. It's a question of whether or not signs can ever be the things they represent; most would say no!

Sign and signified. Beetlebox. I get it. Be careful in how you apply it to the very signs of all perception. 

Why should I think all language is artificial? Several of their lines are not carefully created: they appear to denying F-ness, essentialness, etc. It grows until the deny the signified in some cases.

---

I'd love to hear a treatment on what is not constructed. I can appreciate Saussure's desire to speak of the arbitrariness of signs which only have meaning in the differentiation. 

Barthes divides signs into: iconic, motivated, and arbitrary. It's a spectrum (sounds like golden mean territory).

One of my concerns is that divisions of signs will require making divisions of meanings too. I'm concerned about anti-realism here.

Here's the deal: you can say we [[fff]]ingly never have access to the thing-in-itself with certainty. You do not get to say there is no thing-in-itself with certainty. To say there is no outside, authoritative, objective meaning is absurd; even the meanings of your words destroy themselves. There is a difference between existence and access to that existence. You deny your access, and then make The Slip into denying the existence of that which you cannot (completely) access.

You can say none of us can see the object in question the same, but the emergent properties and relationships of what can and cannot be seen are still the culmination of objectivity. If it is a fact that I interpret that text as meaning this, and you interpret it as meaning that, there is still something objective to be said even if only in virtue of the differences in our subjective interpretations which resides outside us (though I'm convinced it is far more extensive than that given modality).

Meaning is not the result of simply how words are used by minds. Even the hypothetical and potential has meaning long before there were any minds to think it. I am open to the claim that meaning requires simulating, even hypothetically, a mind in relation to the signs and signified; that may be a conceptual necessity. Physicalism, however, is an abject failure. Never forgetti.

Yes, motivation is part of the context of meaning at all. The meaning is still outside.

---

I adore the irony of using language to define paradigms of the ultimate meaninglessness of language. I get it: you are building Wittgenstein's ladder. You're scared to have faith in any realism: it's just not cool to believe anything is real in the end. I've been burned too.

<<<
The semiology of everyday life, of which Barthes can be seen as the founding father, is above all else a school of intellectual honest. It involves first and foremost the recognition that nobody should be unaware of the fact that the signs whereby they project their self-image onto the world are the expressions of a conscious choice.
<<<

Yikes! Surely, they can't mean that.

---

I agree that people lie all the time in their signaling. I agree that Sartre's bad faith obtains all the time. I deny this "artificiality" claim though. I am, of course, interested in the nature of deception.

---

I agree that we are never fully aware of ourselves, and I'm open to the author never fully understanding their work. However, Barthes has to show me what it means to have awareness or understanding at all. I think he aims to deny freedom in a way.

---

I can't claim to have solved the author/audience problem at all. I'm still doubtful of Barthes' hardlined eisegetical interpretive constructivism, especially since he continues to jump into what appears to be a meaninglessness relativity, exceptionally blind internalism (into almost pure observation), and ironic inability to define authenticity (despite what appears to be a sincere concern for the issue).

---

The S/Z problem just is the Ghettier Problem. Epistemic justification is simply more complex than it initially appears. Barthes does not abolish epistemic justification in toto. He does not destroy meaning from authorship as fundamentally necessary to the faith between [[Others]].

---

The notion that the author is the sole constructor of meaning is absurd. There is an external standard which picks out the meaning of however we interpret texts. The infinite problem is computationally infeasible for anything except [[The Infinite]]. He skips right over this possibility since it is clearly enormously damaging to his preference.

---

As usual, I'm interested in what someone thinks of my wiki. Barthes would find the counting and self-containment fascinating. Would he think this is semiosis, like Sade, or mimesis? I think I have a solid mix of both.

---

Why should we think there is no "final" interpretation of a text? Let me say, I see final interpretation as an eternal function which maps contexts of a text to sets of meaning. I recognize it might be possible to say every text can mean any possible thing that can be meant in all possible worlds (any text can be interpreted to mean any thing, depending on the rules of inference). Henosis can only end in [[The Infinite]], and I'm fine with that. 

I grant that there are limitations on how humans can interpret a text, and I grant there is always another interpretation available to us as the [[fff]]. To say there is no final interpretation for us as humans is not to say there is no final interpretation in [[The End]]. Barthes does not get to help himself to the denial of Platonism without a fucking argument. He's begging the question against objectivity. Fuck that shit. Have the balls to state that assumption up front so we can ignore you.

The author's argument at the end is outstanding. He aims to do Barthes justice. =)
