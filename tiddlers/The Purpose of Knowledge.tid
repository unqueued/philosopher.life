title: The Purpose of Knowledge

I should answer this question for myself in a practical way when it comes to my rationality. Being practical about knowledge just is, by definition, the most rational thing I can do. What counts as pragmatism? That seems to define much about knowledge for me. There is so much I don't know about knowledge, and thus I must be practical about it. What could be wiser?

Phronesis means practical wisdom. Practical wisdom is a whole brained activity. Essentially, the frontal lobes are not a dictator. It is necessary to have unification, a smooth running system as a whole, and maximizing frontal lobe production isn't necessarily the sole right or good thing. If we are take separate the physical parts of ourselves, we realize also learn how best to make them function together as parts of a whole. 

I tell you, practical wisdom is fundamentally about good executive decision making. Thus, I know how fundamentally important the frontal lobes are to my existence. I'm saying they are a very necessary part of achieving happiness. 

Oh, I forgot to tell you? Bless my soul. //The Purpose of Knowledge is Happiness. // You are welcome. Seriously. You're totally welcome. One day, you'll thank me again. And, seriously, you are totally welcome. I love you because I love me.<<ref "1">>

<<footnotes "1" "I'm having a conversation with myself. It's okay to say it. I'm not going to feel bad to say that I love myself. Any rational person should to a significant extent. I wasn't raised in a way that allowed me to really believe that. I was raised the wrong way with a fairly rare combination of mental capacities and limitations. I have to forgive my parents for being shitty parents. They're as bad as the rest of us, and that means I must treat them like the rest of us. They could not have helped you, even if they knew how. Ah, you're probably thinking the good and right have a ton in common because you are so practically wise. ">>
