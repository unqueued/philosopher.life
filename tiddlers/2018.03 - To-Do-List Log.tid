!! Audit:

* My son's writing didn't improve that much, but it has been improving. We continue to grind grammar with him.
* My daughter didn't really improve at all. I failed.
* IRS is as resolved as I could get it in that scope. I just received more paperwork.
* I hope to have a job with them in a couple months!
* [[Employment]] is not operational. I failed.
* I read several books.
* I've been slow in digging through rabbitholes. I've grown more interested in SSC.
* I did complete that Link Log!
* I didn't make sure headway anywhere on the wiki, sadly.
* I'm doing a shit job finding a job.
** Being the stay at home dad has its other pressures. I can't expect myself to be superman either.
* I tried be complimentary. That is not my skill.
* I have been fortunate enough to be able to walk with my wife quite a bit. 
* I've had a lot of paperwork to do this month, and I think still more this month.
* I'm excited by the electrician union.
* The last week of the month, my priorities shifted.
* I've been doing most of the grocery shopping on my own. This eases the burden on my wife. I will continue to aim to do this.
* My lists are brief
* I've failed, noticeably, to complete my tasks. That said, I've also found we've needed to shift gears on the fly sometimes.
* The house has been cleaner, on average. I'm grateful for this.
* These To-Do-Lists remind me of how much a whirlwind this month was.
* I do much better with my donors out of the picture.
* Planning "Informing the Men" more often.
* I feel burned out. These lists are so minimal. Is it because I'm tired of failing to accomplish what I really want to accomplish?
* I desperately need a modularized Resume. That is one of the few missing pieces.
* Some days just seem to knock me on my dysthemic bordering on dysfunctional ass.
* I failed to schedule dental appointments!
* I feel like such a failure this month.
* We should add "pulled pork" to the meals we make.
* I'm glad we purposely sat down and set aside time to watch //Westworld//. My daughter liked it more after she understood it.
* I'm proud that I did prep for the interview. I felt far more confident walking into it than I would have otherwise.
* I'm pleased to have scheduled my wife's books. I wish I would do the same for my own!
* Still getting m14 and m15 to be what I want them to be.
* There were several points this month that I didn't feel good.
* Ah, yes, I tried Pork Stir Fry instead beacuse my wife really doesn't like fish =(...I wish I could make the meat have more texture.
* Also, I'm feeling a bit chili'd out. Kids aren't really eating it much either. 
* Ah, yes, we had technical problems to work throug this month as well.
* I will admit, I worked really hard to get my children to work hard this month. It's been a rough month on that front (although, it always is). 
* Well, overall, I give myself a C-. I feel like a fucking idiot.
