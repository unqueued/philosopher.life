title: 2019.07.19 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Ought to be Content

!! Respond to the following gem:

<<<
Man ought to be content, it is said; but with what?
<<<

Content with the choices we've made, to some non-trivial [[dok]], yes. We ought to be content with doing what we ought for the sake of doing what we ought. Justified eudaimonia, of course, is not necessary eudaimonia to any significant extent in all possible cases. The problem with "ought" is that one's happiness is not conceptually linked all the way down. The sad philanthropist may not be content with everything, but is content with respect to his choice which has moral merit. The [[gfwiwcgws]] is already embedded in oughtness itself, and hence so is the standard of contentment.
