title: 2020.03.02 - Prompted Introspection: Old Hands

!! When you look at an elderly person's hands what do you see?

It's fascinating to see [[2018.04.27 - Prompted Introspection Log: Elderly Hands]]. This topic has come up with [[T-Money]] a bit as well.

I tend to see evil in most hands, especially the elderly's. It's a thought I've had many times over my life. I think a lot of "the good ones" were less likely to survive. They were trampled over, ignored, punished, or even converted. I see selfishness in most old people, even when they are quite talented at hiding it. Of course, there are exceptions. I wish there was a clean way to take out the garbage.
