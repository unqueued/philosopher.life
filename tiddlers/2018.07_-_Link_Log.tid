!! Audit:

* During the m10 migration, I basically did nothing. I have a giant backlog to go through. It will have to wait.
* I'm doing a better job setting things aside for my family. I hope to continue.
* I wish I didn't rely upon my categories as a crutch as much as I do. I have more to say about these links. But, you know what, the flood of information is already too much. I'm proud of my work, even if it's not what I was hoping for. I'll see what I can do though.
* You can tell I'm not enjoying this log. That's okay.
* This log is a ton of work. It's interesting to see that my links don't always end up here. That's a good thing.
* Also, note, there has been upheaval on the main //Focus://[[Link Log]]. There is more structuring to do. We will get there.
* I left some jokes for myself. =) I love having breadcrumbs. It makes it more fun to review, audit, and reason about later. I hope that it may even act as a mnemonic device to some extent.
* I hope this link log will pick up the pace again soon.
