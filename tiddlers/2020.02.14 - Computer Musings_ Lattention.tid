title: 2020.02.14 - Computer Musings: Lattention

People better with their {[[focus]]} than me sometimes use tools to block, or now, slow their connection to distractions. That does not work for me, lol. Even locking me up and throwing away the key isn't going to work in too many cases. I'm a pure addict of the internet. The idea of hooking my body up to a digital machine and living in a virtual world seems great. That's practically what I've been ghetto-building toward most of my life. 

The need for speed never ends. I've made lots of leaps for it. I wonder if the population can retrain itself to be more willing to wait. Can patience and even extremely brief inconvenience with technology, knowing what kind of space is opened up because of it, become a publicly recognized virtue of consumers? It must if we are to make progress in the decentralization of power. It's like I choose not to have self-control in this myself.

In construction, sometimes a tool takes a while to be initiated, boot-up, or be ready-to-go. I often thought of many of my older computers as engaging in this warm-up process, and hell, even [[m16]] can take its sweet time to reboot (there are some pieces of software I'm just not going to take the time to make speedier to come up and down), and I didn't think twice about it. Push the button, walk away for a minute, get some food, or take shit, whatever, and come back when it was ready. I do this for so many of appliances and processes in the house. I wait for my water to warm up, my stove, food preparations, for a garage door now.<<ref "m">> There's plenty of things which take time on my computer, but surfing is not one I'm willing to sacrifice much on usually.

I still wait on sites more than most people with a solid internet connection. Firefox is slicing and dicing through bullshit for me, picking up extras, re-writing some of it, adjusting my sessions, etc. I'm still annoyed when I have to wait. Sit 11yo [[h0p3]] in front of this contraption, and he'd be shocked (shocked, I tell you) by the experience, including how fucking snappy it can be (you'd have to bend over backward to explain anything to the idiot, ofc, as always). 

I remember routing my traffic over Tor for a while. Terrible experience (and it has vastly improved over the years). I still hate pushing through a VPN or socksproxy. I'm part of the latency attention problem.
