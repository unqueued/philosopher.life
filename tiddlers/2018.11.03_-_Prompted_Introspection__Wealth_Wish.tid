title: 2018.11.03 - Prompted Introspection: Wealth Wish

!! How would you spend your time if you were wealthy?

Melisandre, you give me yet another variant of this wish. How wealthy? I realize that most people reach diminishing marginal utility at ~3Mil Capital they've earned living off ~110k/year interest. I am extremely thrifty and I can live with very little. After the Maslowian needs of my family (which are fairly significant in my eyes), but before having a harem and traveling the world, I'd be working on [[Outopos]] and likely pushing muh socialist agenda.
