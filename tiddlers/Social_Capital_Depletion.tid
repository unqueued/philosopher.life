title: Social Capital Depletion

[[T42T]] appears to generate an emergence of trust and cooperation that should not otherwise exist in the standard State of Nature. I think [[T42T]] is actually the minimum that I owe to strangers. That said, signals of betrayal are all over the place. This is a truly ugly principle to attempt to understand all the way down, but I suppose any principle would be. I'm trying to be a codificationist here, and it ain't easy. 

My exploiter, MWF, has long been correct in his analogy of social bank accounts. Here, I attempt to explain how my accounting system works and why.
