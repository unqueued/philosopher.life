title: 2019.09.26 - Prompted Introspection: Being Alive

!! What is your favorite song and why?

This question is answered: [[2017.05.20 - Prompted Introspection Log]]. If I'm forced to give an answer that just sticks with me, it's Bach's Prelude from Suite No.1 in G major for Cello. [[Music]] is a drug for me, and that is the closest to consistently causing me to feel [[awe]] of any of my music through the decades. Music that makes me cry is a release, an invocation, and a doorway. Too often, I feel dead, and it's good to remember even for a few minutes what it's like to be alive like that again.
