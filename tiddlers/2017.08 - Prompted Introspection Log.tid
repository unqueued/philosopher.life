!! Audit:

* Okay, I miss responding to images. I need to do that more. I've just not been surfing enough to find images I think are really worthy.
* I believe you do get a feeling for who I am through the introspections.
** Does this simply stroke my ego, or does it help me more directly?
* They are now quite short.
* I notice that I am more likely to re-read these over the course of the month than any other log. I personally enjoy reading what I wrote, thinking about it, and wondering, etc.
* This log and [[h0p3's Log]] evoked the strongest reactions from your parents.
* Some of the work is lame, of course. 
** But, I can't expect myself to provide gold the entire time. There has to be a happy medium, particularly contextualized to the amount of time and energy I can pour into this.
* Sometimes I feel like I already know what I want to say, it is just a vehicle to say it.
* I actually used my Ideabag a ton.
** Filling the ideabag while high was a great idea.
* It has a kind of /b/ thing going on in how random and off the wall it can be. It can be about anything. Often it isn't directly introspective either.
* Several of these started out as notes I wrote down on paper first. 
* Several of these prompts and answers are humorous. To what extent does this mean I don't take it seriously?
* I am clearly interested in reading the blogs of my friends and family. I don't want to participate on awful social media sites, but I do care about how they are feeling, what they are thinking, where they are, what they are doing, etc. I wish everyone had a wiki, seriously. It would make life better for us all.
* I think this log is changing, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think I'm getting a hold of it, but now I need to steer it more (but, that's hard to do without knowing the destination). So, keep it afloat?
