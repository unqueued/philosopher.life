I wonder how much Rowling sees herself in Hermione. Hermione is likely the least flawed character in the entire series.

I think I'm most like Luna Lovegood! Ugh. Lol. I am that weirdo.

Love the "attention seeking" line. It's a line I've seen my donors use about others, and it's helped me see who they are. Writing in one's own blood is gorgeous. She's so fucking literal. Fascinating how HP keeps it under wraps. In fact, holding back his scar hurting and not talking to Dumbledore is a common theme.

Love owl interception. I knew that was real too. 

Fred and George test the concept of consent, ofc.

Percy the Piece of Shit. Love to see what "real family" looks like.
