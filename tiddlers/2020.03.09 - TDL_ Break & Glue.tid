* Offspring and I will craft tomorrow.
** Going to bust out the hand grinder for polishing.
* Will she be DTF? 
** Hope so. Far too long.
* We did a good job in the dining area. Despite our effort, it's still not organized top to bottom. Maybe that will be a different project.
** Let's see what we can do, eh?
* We aren't drafting for chapter four. Instead, we have our feedback, so let's redraft our first three chapters first.
* I'd like to see you bang out your side of the school work early again. Waiting until the evening to watch [[vidyas]] is fine, but not preferred. 
** I'd rather given them their time off.
