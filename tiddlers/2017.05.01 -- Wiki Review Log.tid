title: 2017.05.01 -- Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.04.30 -- Link Log]]
** Inspired me to revamp [[Link Log]]
* [[2017.04.30 -- Family Log]]
** Not convinced the compliment section will work out.
* [[2017.04.30 -- k0sh3k's Wiki Log]]
** I don't have much to add, but I want to force myself to say something. I want to encourage [[k0sh3k]] to continue writing about her day. I want more than just her link log. 
* [[2017.04.30 -- 1uxb0x's Wiki Log]]
** My son's wiki needs serious work. I can't say I'd have done any better at his age. I dont' know. I know I was much lazier in many ways. Regardless, we'll keep pushing. This is a skill he needs.
* [[2017.04.30 -- j3d1h's Wiki Log]]
** She's spending a lot of time structuring, which is excellent. She needs to spend time filling it with content.
* [[Philosophipolitical Prescription: Videos]]
** I want to set of videos to convert others. To help unfuck their minds. 
* [[Homeschooling Log Template]]
** I'm still figuring out how I want it to fit on my wiki. Wha tis the best practice. I want to make sure that I'm not overbearing and that this is constructive.
* [[2017.04.30 -- Wiki Review Log]]
** My worry about my Wiki Review's being enough of a burden to cut down on my actual work on the wiki has lessened. Lol. That's fine.
* [[2017.04.30 -- Diet Log]]
** DCK almost forces me to fast. I just don't feel like eating, sex, drinking, video games. I still like to think and write though. I actually cleaned the house yesterday too. I did all the laundry. I'm productive as fuck (attitudinally, even if I'm not 100% up to it physically).
* [[Beware of those who say "X has no class"]]
** Added some. It's generally correct.
* [[My Wife]]
** A dream-section needs a dream. Added.
* "Fred de Rosset"
** Deleted and moved to DCK. Clearly DCK ramble.
* [[The Pinnacle of Parental Sacrifice]]
** Slight Edit
* [[Dreams of h0p3]]
** This section needs a lot of work if it is going to be so highly placed. Let us see if it survives.
* [[2017.04.30 -- DCK Meditation]]
** You will note there are section written after the DCK meditation. I had definitely come down. Hence, I take these to be the standard afterglow which I use through the week. 
* [[Sanity: What Standard To Use?]]
** My continued mistrust. What can I say. I don't think I'm the crazy one. My derealization is from being redpilled, and from accepting truth backed by enormous evidence that I didn't want to believe for the longest time. I think the rest of the world is far crazier.
