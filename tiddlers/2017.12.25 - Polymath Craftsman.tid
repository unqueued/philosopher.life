* I got a rubber mallet to round out my hammer collection.
* I grabbed a moldable (internally) socket. It's an ugly hack, but a man needs hacks.
* I grabbed some grabbers and magnets.
* Mostly for lockpicking, but I grabbed a yellowbelt ([[/r/lockpicking|http://reddit.com/r/lockpicking]]) brass lock. (It's definitely harder to pick than what I have).
* Put my tool collection away, but I think I'll be taking it upstairs tomorrow.
