title: 2020.02.21 - Prompted Introspection: Bike Helmet

!! Should you be required to wear a bike helmet? Why or why not?

Only under certain conditions. I generally don't find wearing a bike helmet to be useful, and, in fact, it can be a detriment or become hazardous to one's health in many contexts. I wouldn't, for example, find it useful (or worth requiring) for when I'm sleeping on the couch (except in very rare circumstances). However, when I am riding a bike, skateboarding, etc., then a bike helmet is mandatory. I've broken a helmet before, and it would have been my skull that took that hit (and, my brain has already suffered plenty of damage).
