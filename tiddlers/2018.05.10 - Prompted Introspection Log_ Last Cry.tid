title: 2018.05.10 - Prompted Introspection Log: Last Cry

!! When was the last time you cried?

I do not recall. There are also different degrees and kinds of crying. I'm sure to have shed tears from beautiful, hilarious, sad, highly emotional moments in the past few months. I don't keep a log anymore about it. I've not found it worth my time other than to see when I've been extremely stressed. I'm not feeling ridiculously stressed though. 

I've somehow let some of it go, I think. 'What happens' happens, one day at a time, not worrying about what isn't inside my control, and the usual stoic mentalities have crept into my basic emotional states more than usual. I'm appreciative of that when done [[irwartfrr]].

That I've not had to cry, or that I can't remember it, is likely a good thing. Life moves very quickly though, and my memory continues to fade. I think I'm becoming far more normal in my abilities. I've lost threads of genius I once had. I think this is likely part of the pruning process I've undergone in stripping out my residual Christianity. Restarting aspects of one's identity at that level makes it so you no longer have access to all the mental work I've habituated and accumulated over the decades. I'm not only getting dumber, but I've lost the most crucial decades of my life to absolute garbage and bamboozlement. 

I'm grateful to survive, bitter as I am about it. I'll find a way to make it work, I hope. If not, so what? I hope my kids live fulfilling lives. That would be enough for me.
