title: 2017.06.04 - Wiki Review Log

* [[2017.06.03 - Homeschooling Log]]
** I've noticed that when one does well, the other often does poorly. I wish I understand what this meant.
* [[2017.06.03 - Philosophy Probe Log]]
** Informal Logic, as my wife pointed out, sounds like an oxymoron. Formality is about following rules, ultimately. Logic is about following rules too. Obviously, it isn't an oxymoron, and that's exactly why we need to pry it apart very carefully, formally, logically even. =)
* [[2017.06.03 - Cry Log]]
** I'm glad to see times where I cry happily.
** This reminds me, I cried today with my wife. Not a lot, but I shed tears.
* [[2017.06.03 - Prompted Introspection Log]]
** I actually liked this prompted introspection question. I thought it was dumb. Like it was some "business" seminar to get us pumped and shit. Ah, maybe it was. 
* [[2017.06.03 - Link Log]]
** Short KYS section. Umm...good job? 
* [[2017.06.03 - Diet Log]]
** Edited and summed.
* [[2017.06.03 - Wiki Review Log]]

* [[ARAM: Miss Fortune]]
** This needs to be filled out. Next time I play MF, I guess.
