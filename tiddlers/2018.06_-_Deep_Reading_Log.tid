!! Audit:

* This log seems to have something profoundly in common with my [[Link Log]], but I hope that my commentary tells a more effective story.
* This is much closer to my note-taking style; in the end, actually generating an official point of view may be the ultimate goal. I feel like I have to take more information in though. It's super important to feed my neural networks as much data as possible before attempting to derive anything. More importantly, the wiki itself is what I'm trying to write. That's why I'm reading these works in the end.
* It's interesting to see the timings on these readings, and the overlap is neat too.
* I won't be able to keep up this pace once I get back to work.
* Am I really reading the most important books that I can find? I want to point out how so many of these books aren't serious enough in a way. Ugh. If I had a compass for this already, then I probably wouldn't even need to read. I must continue to shape this compass. This is the kind of curation and salience pursuit that will take my entire life.
* Some of these books I finished in a single day! Huzzah!
* Some of these books I had the will power to put down. I'm glad I did.
* Some of these books I failed to continue, but I hope to come back and pickup. I feel like a real failure here.
* You can easily see which of my books are bathroom reading.
* One of my favorite parts of this deep reading is reading the commentary, reviews, and hyperreadable literature surrounding the original. My verbal reasoning is very poor, and these are huge "speed ups" for me. I can't say I always agree to the meta body, but I'm glad I investigate it.
* Most of my time is devoted to fiction. 
* I need to get over the fact that I'm clearly illiterate; I must keep making mistakes and improving. It doesn't matter that I'm ignorant; it matters that I'm trying to do something about it.
** KEEP GOING!
** I need to be a better role model for my children.
* I am proud that I read my enemies here. I'm glad that I extract what they've done right, adding their distinctiveness to my own, etc.
* I see philosophy, economics, politics, and postmodern fiction. Perhaps I've chosen poorly. Forgive me! I will continue to try to do better.
