//Statements// are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value while //Expressions// evaluate to a resulting value. 

`5 + 6` is an expression that evaluates to the value 11. Expressions can be part of statements: e.g. `let y = 6;`, `6` is an expression that evaluates to the value 6. Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. The block that we use to create new scopes, `{}`, is an expression too.

```cpp
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1 // notice the lack of a semicolon
    }; // The scope of { ... } is an expression that evaluates to 4

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

The `->` arrow points out the type of value that is returned.

```cpp
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

The `x: i32` shows us what kind of input is expected and assigns the value to a variable name that can be used inside the function.

```cpp
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1   // note the lack of a semicolon 
}
```

If there was a semicolon on the expression, it would fail to compile, since it would be returning `()`, the empty tuple instead of an i32.

Condition //If// branches:

```cpp
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

You must always provide `if` with a boolean as its condition, and each arm of the if must be the same type. Note that `match` is a more powerful branching construct.

Because `if` is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a let statement:

```cpp
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition {
        5
    } else {
        6
    };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

Loops example:

```cpp
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    } // note the lack of break, so this goes on forever
}
```

Classic while loop:

```cpp
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index = index + 1;
    }
}
```

This is slow though. It is much better to use the for loop over each element in a collection:

```cpp
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```

Here's an example of `rev` over a range, which iterates in reverse over the range:

```cpp
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

Code homework problems they gave me.
