title: 2018.12.20 - Be A Good Dad: Wikis

I continue to argue in full that learning to use your wikis is like learning to read and write all over again. There is an executive functioning, note-taking, and flexibly dimensioned literacy in this practice that cannot be replaced. This is a tool (or type of tool) you can (and should) use for the rest of your life. It is an amplifier to learning all the other tools. Master your wikis. By the time you are in your 20's, you will be an expert in something which most people are only beginning to wrestle with.

My son learned to import from savetrail. I'm glad he installed that when I asked him to, and I'm glad we caught the error.

My grammar sucks too. This is a hoop we have to jump through while we still can. It's absurdly hard for an autist, but we don't have a choice.

I think large sections of his reading and writing time should just be devoted back to it again.
7 MIN AGO
I'm fine if that's all he does for a year.
7 MIN AGO
His writing is the only communication tool he's going to have.
6 MIN AGO
I don't care about history, reading, geography, social sciences, etc. if he can't write.
6 MIN AGO
He needs to become an expert in grammar.
2 MIN AGO
There are many weaknesses we will not be able to overcome with him, but this has to be one.
2 MIN AGO
He doesn't have the affective, gut instincts about whether or not a sentence is grammatically correct. That is going to have to be cognitively reverse engineered and habituated until he can emotionally intuit that something isn't right about his writing.
```

Syntax is often rhetoric because it masquerades as semantics (particularly to our lizard brains for signaling). I told my son that his grammar must be the tits.

We had a long conversation about the evolution of language again. The philosophical implications are crucial to understand. I must motivate learning this difficult practice for my son.
