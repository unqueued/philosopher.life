* House is looking okay. Quick chores is all we have left.
* Jobbos, sir. Sorry about your luck. I wish they called back.
* Keep grinding through the music collection.
** Btw, I still like that idea of embedding the torrents into the wiki. That is so badass, but it will cost you to do it safely.
*** Set your vanity aside. Right now, you have to build what matters.
* I'll keep saying read and write, but you'll do whatever fits, right? XD
* Your brother is doing well. I don't know if you actually were any help, but keep it up. He has no one else who's thinking about his thoughts with him like you do, so make yourself useful to him.
* I'm also sorry to hear about the bills. There's only so much in your control. If it falls apart, then it does. Being moral doesn't mean you survive or justice obtains. `/salute`
* You are a shit interpreter as always, [[h0p3]], and never forget it. But, you need to understand what [[kicks]] is [[saying|https://www.kickscondor.com/what-draws-me-to-surrealism/]].
