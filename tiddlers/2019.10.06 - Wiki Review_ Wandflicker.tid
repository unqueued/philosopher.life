* [[2019.10.05 - Wiki Review: DeVito Go For It]]
** Ummm...you got any more of that forgivenness?
* [[2019.10.05 - TDL: Familia]]
** Yay! =) - It was a solid day, and it was productive.
* [[2019.10.05 - Prompted Introspection: Groundhog Day]]
** Completed. `/sigh` You know.
* [[2019.10.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sphygmus]]
** It was a bustling day. Why the fuck am I drinking alcohol again? Oh, I don't have much cannabutter left. My last 2 ounces I prepared lasted me 10% of my lifetime, lol. I can't wait to get to a point where I can use with regularity: sooper good for schizotypal people like me, ofc.
*** Going out in style.
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: Maymay Library]]
** Turned out I wasn't satisfied just hunting for maymays. Will probably die, sadly. Let's see how this week goes.
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: Iframe Curated Directory of Windows]]
** Now, this does something interesting. I have begun work on it.
*** Oh, what about [[Sphygmus]]'s workspace hack? We have been planning that forever, but she actually did it. Will graft and play. Virtualized storyrivers or storage (or what have you) may go much further than I can see.
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: Placard: Title Sign]]
** Bye.
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: Wear'em Out, Bois]]
** I keep changing it, Bob keeps changing it back. Love/hate relationship. Bob is muh buddy.
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: Big, Bad, Banned, Burn'em Dark Arts]]
** I've never burned a book in my life. Need to hit Mr. K's. 
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: Tyler & Taylor Price's Library]]
** We've got a cool sign to start with. Print out a name, and voila.
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: LiLBucfk]]
** However, we have to compile something anyway!
*** My daughter suggested just using git for it. She's probably right.
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: Placard: Library]]
** Thus, Ditto.
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: USB]]
** Ditto.
* [[Buxe & Braincandy: QR-Sites]]
** Cute, but I'm not convinced this is going to be worth the effort.
* [[Buxe & Braincandy]]
** I should use cannabliss more often. It's been months.
* [[Anonymous]]
** Practicaly [[PH]]. Might as well.
