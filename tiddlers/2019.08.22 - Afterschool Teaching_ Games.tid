title: 2019.08.22 - Afterschool Teaching: Games

Sonya showed up today. I've been following the letter, and my routine didn't need to change. She glad hands around the school. It was interesting to see a portion of my students understood it was an inspection and behaved differently. It feels like Thailand. My students even said I wasn't so blind today.

Matt talked with me about the students reading and his becoming a coach. I think he is pushing our students to read. Bless him. I'm going to continue to pour my praise out to my readers and be the backup.

5IK has me worried. Weird hippy PBS ego mixed with a laziness to match my own, but I believe she is experiencing something very large at home. She knows she can talk with me, but I'm convinced she is not going to speak with anyone. Can-openers do not work.

I think I need to go even slower in my 1-on-1s. I'm lucky to be able to do them everyday, but I should find a way to make these more useful to the children. They must dance with a monster for a little while. I must train wrestlers in computational existentialism.

I didn't have to blow my whistle up front. I asked for their attention and got it. Noice. As planned, Bacon takes 5th, and unplanned: I take everyone else. Eventually, I ended up with everyone. Herding cats again, and I have no idea what Whitney is doing. We had fun, but I was drained of my spoons.

I played a few games of magic, and there were lots of people reasoning about it. I played Dredge today. Lots of questions from passers if this that Dungeons and Dragons game their parents warned them about. No, Dobson, it's not, but I may teach that one as well (focus on your own family, fool).

6CMm is so quiet and kind, and he's observant too. I'm lucky he came with us today. He allows students to walk over him, and I need to teach him how to fend for himself against the psychopaths among us.

5ANf is hilarious in interactions. She ranges from flat deadpan to internet meme, and she lives up to her tropes. At least she responded with a passing zero eye-contact nod when I wished her a good evening, lol. I think she doesn't hate me, so I must be something decent. My daughter stabs much harder, and with crazy accuracy which only comes from profound empathy.
