title: 2007.02.22 -- Rogue Update 1.1

Rogue is slowing progressing. I got some x-52 pilot pants and the 30stam/10agi enchant for it. Picked up a really awful looking Helm of the Claw, threw a crafted running speed 24AP meta gem in there (had to use an orange gem for the effect) so I have +12 stam on boots. I did get my Vindicator’s brand (sweet) and the r14 pvP gloves for the kickilicious deadly throw now.

I need 5kg for a mount, and this is rough to get. I had to glide for marks/fels, and I used a SWEET tunnel in BEMountains for it. It is so good, and so bottable, that I grabbed two demonslayer enchants (hard to come by now and days) and I’ve been there ever since. Hopefully I’ll have the cash in 2 more weeks of botting. It all depends on how well marks/fel arms will sell. I could easily be sitting of 500 and 50 of those. We’ll see.

My dueling guide has progressed. I still need to write a few more sections, and then I’ll be done. I want to make sure I’ve got all the fights down correctly. The paladin fight is the one I have the least experience with, but I’ve had plenty more experience now that I am back on a PvP server and Horde also have pallies now.

The hourglass of the unraveller really sucks. It is simply overrated. At a 20% chance to crit, I’ll have a 2% chance to proc it. 300AP for 10 seconds. There are alot of problems with it…With resilience and defense it gets even worse. Certainly a dagger rogue’s item at best.

I’m going for the Ring that costs 50 Spirit shards and a better chest slot in the short term.

Long term–Gladiator’s gear.

Zombienoir and I have been pwning up the 2v2’s pretty well…although we’ve had a 50/50 streak as of late (zombie wasn’t really on the ball that night).
