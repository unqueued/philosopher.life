title: 2018.09.22 - Computer Musings: m14 Root

[[monster-14]] is the best phone I've ever had, and yet it, it's a pile of shit. It does the job, barely. 

A lot of software on my phone just doesn't work without root.

I lost root (I'm guessing through some kind of update, probably LineageOS'); Magisk is not automatically working. If I have to manually patch the boot image more than once, something is wrong. I'm such an entitled asshole, I realize. It drives me fucking insane that I do not have automatic root on any device I've bought. I'm grateful to those who do the hardwork of decrappifying my device for me, allowing me to skiddie my through the hell that is my phone. Thank you!

I know I never have full control too, and in a very important sense, I don't want to have to control it all the way down. I just want something I can trust and reliably skiddie on.

Fresh drive is dying on HTPC, or the SATA port is going bad. I've not looked into it yet (and, I may have j3d1h do this). I'm concerned we have an electrical problem in the apartment (which is my job to look into).
