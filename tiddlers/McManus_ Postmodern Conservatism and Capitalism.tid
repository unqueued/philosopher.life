title: McManus: Postmodern Conservatism and Capitalism

http://newpol.org/content/postmodern-conservatism-and-capitalism

<<<
  For some conservatives, post-modernism is signifies everything that is wrong with contemporary society. 
<<<

I was definitely raised on this myself. Pomo is humbling when you take it in, but I think [[Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]].

<<<
Conservative critics often take various social groups who advocate for postmodernism to be responsible for social fragmentation and the alleged collapse of the Western tradition and its values.  
<<<

I feel like I know what I'm saying when I distinguish the following:

# Group X identifies as postmodern
# Group X is postmodern
# Group X posits postmodern ideas
# Group X advocates postmodernism
# Group X points out postmodernism
# Group X is a response to postmodernism
# Group X is influenced by postmodernism

But, you know, some of this is fuzzy and hard to wield. Perhaps I'm missing the obvious.

I think postmodernism is clearly a crucial problem that seems to deconstruct my epistemology and identity, and I think it's a supercharged retelling of some very ancient problematics. I advocate taking into account postmodernism in constructing metamodern systematic philosophy; we have to respond wisely! Postmodernism is dangerous exactly because it is so damned right about a number of problems. We don't stand on the solid, certain, constructive ground we hoped. 

I do think it's fair to say postmodernism, postmodernists, or our responses to postmodernism have been fragmenting (even fragmentation to some [[dok]] may itself be postmodern). 

I'll agree pomo is the conservative's handwaving bogeyman. It's not about philosophical integrity in their case. It's just an outgroup to blame. They haven't even attempted to be charitable to the pomo arguments to recognize their own hypocrisy, though: I think they may still be correct that postmodernism is easily wielded in such a way that it flattens everything into anti-realism. It's a very difficult vortex to escape. I blame Kant; that brilliant bastard fucked us.

Postmodernism is a form of skepticism; it has an incredibly high epistemic standard. Conservatives decry even basic skepticism though, since tradition into doubt is already a failure to respect the authority they've begged.

I want to add that I think there is an element of analytic xenophobia to continental philosophy here. It's pretty clear to me that pomo is easily found in both; they have a hell of a lot in common, even if they have different styles.

The collapse of Western trad is insane. Setting aside Orientialist worries for a moment, pomo just IS Western tradition in action.

<<<
I want to discuss how capitalist societies actually produce the kind of social fragmentation and atomism these conservative critics decry
<<<

Preach.

<<<
Moreover, I would claim that since we frame our identity in relation to the world around us, these new values and commodities lead to social fragmentation through the creation of new identities. 
<<<

Capitalism drives us to stop playing [[T42T]] and move to [[T4T]] or worse, making it a zero-sum perfect competition when it could have been an emergence of radically forgiving cooperation instead. It rewards psychopaths who can take the evil means to their ends. Capitalism grants innate competitive advantages to those who have no moral qualms in favor of pure selfishness. Dark-triadicism inverts and collapses the power structures which were built on trust. It may just be moral decay itself. Our new identities are disenfranchised victims, unwittingly reactionary, hopelessly gaslit,  simulated, drug-seeking, isolated, migratory, survivalist, and themselves fragmented into lacking unity/integrity on even an individual [[4DID]] basis.

<<<
 Postmodern conservatism is highly dangerous because, rather than critically examining the root causes of social fragmentation in capitalist processes, it directs its rage against the most vulnerable in society.
<<<

See, here I want to say they "practice" postmodernism, but have no interest in solving it. Admittedly, I know a lot of Leftists who ultimately slide into anti-realism too (even when they claim not to). I'm a Platonist though; anything less is already admitting defeat in my extremist view. We're in a race to solve this crisis in philosophy.

<<<
 In its place, they erected a kind of atomistic individualism, where each person was concerned to pursue their own desires without interference from others or respect for traditional values. 
<<<

The local vs. global problem continues to crop up. I think Liberalism is generally individualistic. The conservatives are not 100% wrong here. If the tradition we aim to preserve is [[The Golden Rule]], and nothing less, then I'm fine with tradition (but, that isn't really the tradition, even if it should be); of course, that's not what they mean at all. I don't think we own ourselves; we owe each other a great deal. Our think our Hohfeldian moral rights molecules are profoundly entangled, and I do have a problem with those who think they can own themselves all the way down. That's insanity.

<<<

DING DING DING DING DING! And, I think we should add that it INTENDS to do that, to subvert others to do so, to take the subjectivist point of view up to be conveniently egoist, selfish, and dark-triadic.

<<<
 Postmodern conservatives want their values accepted because that is what tradition dictates and what most “regular” people value (though apparently not enough to win a majority of votes in the United States).
<<<

Mmmm...I think that is far too charitable. I think these people are far more evil than that.

<<<
Postmodern conservatives such as Donald Trump
<<<

He's not a conservative precisely. He's whatever he thinks serves his selfish aims. He's an egoist. It just so happens that conservatism strongly tends to be that identity most of the time.
