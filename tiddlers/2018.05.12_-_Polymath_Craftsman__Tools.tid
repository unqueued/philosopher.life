title: 2018.05.12 - Polymath Craftsman: Tools

Went through my tools with my son. All of them. We talked about what they are called, how they work, what they are used for, etc.

We also setup my toolbox for work. It's fucking gorgeous, by autistic standards! It is the most well-rounded toolbox I could conceive, and it's not too heavy or big. I'm consider getting a strap for it anyways. I have really nice tools, and I'm glad that I'm prepared to do business.
