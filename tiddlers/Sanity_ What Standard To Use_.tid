title: Sanity: What Standard To Use?

* Deviance - "Other humans aren't like that?"
** Several fallacies.

* It isn't Good.
** What isn't good? Define it. Why should we agree to that standard. What makes you the boss of "what is good?"
** Good of humans? Naturalistic fallacy. etc.

* It isn't Good for you?
** How do you know the standard of good for me? 
** Even if we agree, just because X something is good for Y doesn't mean X is normatively right for Y. 
*** Stealing money from poor people is good for me, but that doesn't make it right for me to do.

* It isn't likely to be good for you?
** See all three problems above.

There's no escaping doing metaethics here. The problem is that I know how poorly justified all the arguments are at the very bottom. These arguments are like houses of cards.

I'm not saying you can't find a measure, but I'm saying there aren't strong points of objective reference to lay out tent pegs down. It's a postmodernist quagmire. It does deconstruct. When we go to build a metamodern reconstruction, I don't see why I have to buy your opinion.

That isn't to say I'm buying into relativism. I legitimately don't think your opinion is more justified than mine. 

Even if you were a "trained" psychologist, psychiatrist, therapist, or counselor, I know enough to know how little you know. I also know that you aren't going to be able to escape a number of metaethical problems (or numerous other philosophical problems either). It is always the problem of authority.
