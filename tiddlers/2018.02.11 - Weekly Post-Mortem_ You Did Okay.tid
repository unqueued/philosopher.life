{{2018.02.04 - Weekly To-Do-List Log: On the Road}}

---

* I did reach out to family. I would not say I was terribly successful, but I don't think it was up to me. 
** I suppose at this point L&K may not be talking to me. I do not know why. I've done my best to reach out to them. Welp, not much more I can do. We'll play it on their terms.

* I am pleased we lent books to our homeschooling neighbors. We don't have much of a relationship, but that's okay. I'm not expecting one.

* I did reach out the union, but Monday is the earliest I can apply
* Milligan is no-go. I won't go down that path again.
* CL has been the most promising thus far.
* I think my [[Job Hunting Log]] sucks right now. It's okay. Forget it. Move on and do your best this week. =)

* I think we achieved quite a bit this week, even if it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. I pleased with the progress my children are making in school. That is not nothing! I am, essentially, a homemaker and teacher right now.
